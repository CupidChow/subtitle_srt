think about our families...

00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:06,806
Would you
get back together with me?

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:07,774
[Max] I don't know.

4
00:00:07,907 --> 00:00:09,208
Because of what's happening,

5
00:00:09,342 --> 00:00:12,512
I keep seeing things about you
that make me reconsider.

6
00:00:12,644 --> 00:00:15,814
You always get jealous,
you don't trust me--

7
00:00:15,948 --> 00:00:17,617
Anything else
you don't like about me?

8
00:00:17,751 --> 00:00:20,253
[Dale] Maybe because
I came so close to death...

9
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:22,121
it's like I've been given
a second chance

10
00:00:22,254 --> 00:00:23,690
and I'm running out of time.

11
00:00:23,823 --> 00:00:26,626
And if I don't do something now,
I'll never be able to do it.

[Dale]
Dom, what are you doing here?

13
00:00:29,062 --> 00:00:30,230
One day, I have a girlfriend...

14
00:00:30,362 --> 00:00:31,263
[Dale] You just vanished!

15
00:00:31,397 --> 00:00:33,133
I came back to be with you.

16
00:00:33,265 --> 00:00:35,268
Michiko,
I want to be your boyfriend.

17
00:00:35,402 --> 00:00:37,103
Can we watch the whole video?

18
00:00:37,237 --> 00:00:38,537
[Max]
I wanna find out the truth.

19
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:42,107
I believe that video will prove
Uncle Boyet's innocence.

22
00:00:49,783 --> 00:00:53,219
[Randy] That's Boyet
who just entered the frame.

23
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:57,057
As you can see,
he didn't take the gun.

24
00:00:58,625 --> 00:00:59,926
This was when
the blackout happened,

25
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,326
but the dashcam
was still recording.

26
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:05,097
You can see the gang
leaving without Boyet.

27
00:01:06,165 --> 00:01:10,602
Boyet said he called
the ambulance and left.

28
00:01:11,103 --> 00:01:14,239
Tiago said Boyet went with them.

29
00:01:14,373 --> 00:01:17,376
Even at this point, we can see
who's telling the truth.

30
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:21,680
Then, after less than a minute,
the syndicate came back.

31
00:01:22,147 --> 00:01:27,219
Somebody pulls out a gun.
It's Tiago, not Boyet.

Tiago exited the van by himself.

34
00:01:35,528 --> 00:01:38,197
He's holding the gun, not Boyet.

35
00:01:39,731 --> 00:01:42,367
We should now discredit the
testimony of Santiago Notarte.

36
00:01:42,968 --> 00:01:45,105
[Randy] He cannot claim to be
a mere witness to the crime

37
00:01:45,237 --> 00:01:47,507
when he's obviously the shooter.

38
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:50,009
This is still not solid proof.

39
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:52,278
But this is the best evidence
we have so far!

40
00:01:52,412 --> 00:01:54,947
And it proves
that my client wasn't lying.

41
00:01:55,447 --> 00:01:56,549
[Randy]
Boyet's story is consistent

42
00:01:56,683 --> 00:01:57,549
from the very beginning.

43
00:01:58,117 --> 00:02:01,453
He didn't shoot Dale Enrile.

44
00:02:01,987 --> 00:02:03,222
I swear, I didn't.

00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:07,326

47
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:11,965
I believe Uncle Boyet.

[emotional music playing]

49
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,570
I also believe Max.

I...

51
00:02:25,677 --> 00:02:28,381
would rather
take the word of Boyet

52

but kind to Deib

I...

55
00:02:50,402 --> 00:02:52,372
I want justice for my son.

56
00:02:56,008 --> 00:02:59,145
But not at the expense of
putting an innocent man in jail.

57
00:03:04,283 --> 00:03:05,951
So, I agree with my wife.

58
00:03:06,786 --> 00:03:09,455
[Daniel] I believe
this is enough evidence...

59
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:13,893
to prove that Boyet
didn't try to kill my son Dale.

60
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:17,229

00:03:18,397 --> 00:03:19,365

179
00:11:10,668 --> 00:11:11,570
Space.

180
00:11:11,903 --> 00:11:14,306
[somber music playing]

181
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,942
I need space and time to heal.

182
00:11:19,711 --> 00:11:23,081
And to make sure
that if we get back together...

183
00:11:23,481 --> 00:11:24,216
If?

184
00:11:25,183 --> 00:11:26,184
Not when?

185
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,389
If we get back together,

186
00:11:32,591 --> 00:11:34,759
it has to be with our eyes open.

187
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:38,798
We cannot get blinded
by our emotions

188
00:11:40,732 --> 00:11:42,735
or too swept up
in the romance again.

189
00:11:44,269 --> 00:11:46,905
I want us to be
more accepting of each other,

190
00:11:49,307 --> 00:11:51,110
including our flaws.

191
00:11:54,212 --> 00:11:58,216
And Deib, we can't heal
if our families don't.

192
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:14,432
Grams...

193
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:19,138
[Maxim] Doc!

194
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:20,572
Hello!

195
00:12:20,706 --> 00:12:21,373
[Maxim] Thanks for inviting us.

196
00:12:21,506 --> 00:12:22,274
Yes, of course.

197
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:23,109
Doc!

198
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:25,376
Dale!

199
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:29,048
Max, I'm really sorry.

200
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:31,317
-[peaceful music playing]
-I'm sorry, too.

201
00:12:38,423 --> 00:12:39,191
Boyet,

202
00:12:40,091 --> 00:12:44,230
I'm sorry for everything
I said and did,

203
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:47,700
for causing you
and your family pain.

204
00:12:48,366 --> 00:12:53,205
I was angry. I wanted justice
for my son Dale. I'm sorry.

205
00:12:53,938 --> 00:12:55,841
I understand, sir.

206
00:12:56,774 --> 00:13:02,014
If I were in your shoes,
I'd be angry, too.

207
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:04,649
If someone hurt Max,

208
00:13:05,049 --> 00:13:09,421
I won't stop
until they're punished.

209
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,024
I'm sorry for it all, sir.

210
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:13,424
Okay.

211
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:17,462
Dale...

212
00:13:19,764 --> 00:13:21,667
Dale, I hope you can forgive me.

213
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:24,570
If I could go back
to that night,

214
00:13:25,037 --> 00:13:26,839
I wouldn't leave you
and Deib behind.

215
00:13:27,873 --> 00:13:30,275
[Boyet] I was a coward.

216
00:13:31,943 --> 00:13:33,312
I'm really sorry, Dale.

217
00:13:36,381 --> 00:13:37,416
It's okay, Uncle.

218
00:13:38,082 --> 00:13:39,451
[Dale] Everything worked out
in the end.

219
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,788
[Dale] If you didn't leave,

220
00:13:43,855 --> 00:13:45,624
they would've killed you too.

221
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:47,960
[Dale] This case
would've never been solved.

222
00:13:49,827 --> 00:13:50,995
[Boyet] Thank you, Dale.

223
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,735
Deib! Come here!
I've missed bonding with you.

224
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,104
Sorry, Uncle.

225
00:14:03,075 --> 00:14:04,143
Grandma Bhaves,

226
00:14:05,043 --> 00:14:06,879
I'm sorry for how I acted.

227
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:09,114
All is forgiven.

228
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,017
[Daniel] Max...

229
00:14:13,318 --> 00:14:17,121
I said a lot of things
that hurt you...

230
00:14:18,957 --> 00:14:21,393
because I was angry
about what happened to Dale,

231
00:14:23,461 --> 00:14:24,596
but I was also...

232
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:28,234
concerned about Deib.

233
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:34,240
I didn't want his feelings hurt.
I was protecting him.

234
00:14:35,774 --> 00:14:37,375
And I questioned his loyalty.

235
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:47,519
Mr. Luna, I'm sorry
for everything I did

236
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:48,354
to your daughter.

237
00:14:54,225 --> 00:14:58,096
Yes, I admit
I was hurt for my daughter.

238
00:14:58,697 --> 00:15:00,298
But I understand, Daniel.

239
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:03,369
Parents will do anything
and everything

240
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:06,871
to protect their child
and defend their family.

241
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,140
[Daniel]
Thank you for understanding.

242
00:15:09,674 --> 00:15:12,211
Again, I'm sorry for all of it.

243
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:14,178
Me, too.

244
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,783
I'm sorry that Deib and I
kept things from you.

245
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:23,755
I'm really sorry
about our decisions

246
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:25,256
that complicated the situation.

247
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:27,659
[Max] I'm sorry.

248
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:35,100
Yeah, I'm sorry, Dad,
Mom, Dale. Sorry.

249
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:40,139
Well, I don't think any of us
wanted to hurt each other.

250
00:15:40,605 --> 00:15:44,475
So, I hope we can all try
to put this in the past,

251
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,912
rebuild, and restart.

252
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:48,514
Yes!

253
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:49,815
[Boyet] That's right, Doc!

254
00:15:49,947 --> 00:15:54,086
So get back together,

I really miss her.

260
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:14,673
I don't know what to do.

261
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:16,975
I want us back.

even about the project.

I really feel bad
after I broke up with her.

the text by mistake.

Are you an egg?

Because with you, my world
is always sunny side up.

361
00:22:06,991 --> 00:22:08,059
Very funny.

00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,028

Stop.

ice cream and he doesn't.

[Bhaves] You should've
brought him to Mindoro.

391
00:24:11,316 --> 00:24:13,785
So he could've met your friends.

Wait, where are your friends?

They're supposed
to help us clean, right?

394
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:20,090
They have practice in school.

395

They'll come right after.

00:24:23,327 --> 00:24:26,798

The university in Japan
that I applied to!

402

Look, Grams!

403
00:24:46,617 --> 00:24:48,686
You scared me. Let me see!

00:24:49,287 --> 00:24:50,422
Congrats, Max!

Congrats, darling! You did it!

407
00:24:59,263 --> 00:25:01,333
Wait, you said this is in Japan?

408
00:25:01,465 --> 00:25:02,400
Yes.

409
00:25:02,534 --> 00:25:04,068
Do you know
how to speak Japanese?

410
00:25:04,201 --> 00:25:07,739
They have English courses.
That's why I want to go there.

411
00:25:08,339 --> 00:25:11,710
Your Uncle Boyet will save up
to visit for sure.

412
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:16,480
He's been wanting to visit
your mother's grave.

413
00:25:16,615 --> 00:25:18,983
Yes, Grams.
That's also why I applied there.

414
00:25:19,116 --> 00:25:19,917
[Bhaves] Really?

415
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:22,887
Yes, so I can visit
Mom's grave often.

416
00:25:24,288 --> 00:25:28,359
So you and Deib
are gonna do long distance,

417

418
00:25:32,696 --> 00:25:34,633
Are you back together?

Uh, no, but...

420
00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:43,173
Hopefully.

00:25:44,808 --> 00:25:46,278
You don't look so sure.

422
00:25:47,913 --> 00:25:50,115
We need to fix
some things first.

423
00:25:50,915 --> 00:25:53,117
I don't wanna rush
getting back together

424
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:56,186
because
I don't want us to implode again

425
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,855
when we face another problem.

426
00:25:58,289 --> 00:25:59,691
That's right, darling.

427
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:02,394
Take it slow.

428
00:26:02,527 --> 00:26:09,733
Feel things out and get to know
even each other's flaws,

429
00:26:09,867 --> 00:26:12,569
so your relationship
will be stronger

430
00:26:12,703 --> 00:26:16,340
when you get back together.

431
00:26:17,308 --> 00:26:18,276
Yes, Grams.

432
00:26:19,344 --> 00:26:22,247
I'm worried about
doing long distance though.

433
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,449
[Max] We were both bad at it.

435
00:26:29,153 --> 00:26:32,123
Grams, your granddaughter
seems to be scared

436
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:34,858
that if she goes to Japan,

437
00:26:35,559 --> 00:26:36,428
her relationship with Deib

438
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,295
will suffer
the same fate as ours.

439
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:38,096
Gotta think about
the scholarship.

440
00:26:39,364 --> 00:26:42,467
[Bhaves] She's not scared.
There's no cowardice in her DNA!

My granddaughter is brave!
She's a Del Valle!

What are you doing here?

449
00:27:19,636 --> 00:27:21,239
I wanted to make sure
you're okay.

450
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:24,174
Your head still hurts?

I don't want her to think

456
00:27:36,855 --> 00:27:39,324
there's still something
going on between us.

457
00:27:40,057 --> 00:27:42,861
Dale,
I'm just concerned about you.

458
00:27:43,827 --> 00:27:47,198
[Dom] You shouldn't
push your body too hard.

459
00:27:48,032 --> 00:27:49,733
That's why
you keep getting headaches.

460
00:27:50,201 --> 00:27:51,068
Dom, just go.

461
00:27:52,503 --> 00:27:54,305
Just leave. Please.

462
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:58,476
Just leave!

00:27:58,609 --> 00:27:59,411
[Michiko] Dale?

464
00:27:59,544 --> 00:28:00,679
Dale!

465
00:28:01,278 --> 00:28:02,313
Dale, what happened?

466
00:28:04,148 --> 00:28:04,915
I'm fine.

467
00:28:05,784 --> 00:28:06,785
Is she gone?

468
00:28:09,186 --> 00:28:09,854
Huh?

469
00:28:11,423 --> 00:28:12,323
Michiko...

470
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:15,859
I don't wanna
hide anything from you.

471
00:28:16,627 --> 00:28:17,429
But Dom...

472
00:28:18,829 --> 00:28:20,164
Dom was just here.

473
00:28:20,298 --> 00:28:21,499
[somber music playing]

474
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:24,234
I don't wanna see her anymore,
but she just keeps showing up...

00:28:27,204 --> 00:28:27,939
Dale...

476
00:28:28,338 --> 00:28:29,874
But I promise you:

477
00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:32,943
there's nothing going on
between me and Dom.

478
00:28:34,011 --> 00:28:36,480
[Dale] I'm happy with you.
I've moved on--

479
00:28:37,714 --> 00:28:39,317
What do you mean you see Dom?

480
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,820
She just visits me here.

481
00:28:43,922 --> 00:28:46,023
I keep telling her
I don't wanna see her anymore.

482
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:48,859
Dale...

483
00:28:50,295 --> 00:28:52,063
It's not possible.
You can't see Dom.

484
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:53,865
What do you mean?

485
00:28:55,432 --> 00:28:56,334
She's gone.

486
00:28:58,001 --> 00:28:59,837
She's been dead
for quite a while.

487
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:03,807
No...

488
00:29:04,442 --> 00:29:05,210
No...

-[dramatic music playing]
-[Evita] Dale...

490
00:29:23,327 --> 00:29:26,931
Dom visited you
when you were in a coma,

491
00:29:28,098 --> 00:29:29,000
but...

492
00:29:29,933 --> 00:29:32,103
her body was weak then.

493
00:29:36,007 --> 00:29:38,509
[Evita] She apologized
for leaving you so suddenly

494
00:29:38,643 --> 00:29:40,077
because her cancer came back

495
00:29:40,211 --> 00:29:42,413
and she didn't want
to burden you.

496
00:29:43,914 --> 00:29:48,987
When you got shot,
she had to come and see you.

497
00:29:54,025 --> 00:29:56,426
A few weeks
after she visited you,

498
00:29:57,662 --> 00:29:59,096
she passed away.

499
00:30:02,099 --> 00:30:03,867
Wish I was there for her.

500
00:30:04,868 --> 00:30:06,304
[Dale] Wish
I could've been there for her.

501
00:30:06,436 --> 00:30:07,438
I know.

502
00:30:08,573 --> 00:30:10,340
[Dale] She wouldn't have
to go through that alone.

503
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:12,809
But if she's dead...

504
00:30:14,546 --> 00:30:16,247
why do I keep seeing her?

505
00:30:17,682 --> 00:30:19,083
[Dale] Am I seeing her ghost?

506
00:30:20,084 --> 00:30:21,286
What's wrong with me?

507
00:30:24,855 --> 00:30:26,857
You said
you've been getting headaches?

508
00:30:29,493 --> 00:30:32,230
I think it's time we have you
checked again, son.

509
00:30:33,463 --> 00:30:34,164
Okay.

510
00:30:34,298 --> 00:30:35,098
[Evita] Okay?

511
00:30:35,232 --> 00:30:35,967
Yeah.

512
00:30:36,567 --> 00:30:37,301
[Dale] Let's do it.

513
00:30:42,874 --> 00:30:43,708
Dale,

514
00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:46,778
you have what we call an AVM.

515
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,114
[doctor] Blood vessels
in your brain got tangled up,

516
00:30:50,582 --> 00:30:53,417
disrupting the normal flow
of blood and oxygen.

517
00:30:54,152 --> 00:30:56,988
Hallucinations
are a symptom of that.

518
00:31:00,124 --> 00:31:01,526
But why Dom, Doc?

519
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:05,663
Why do I keep seeing the
same person over and over again?

520
00:31:06,163 --> 00:31:07,565
[doctor] I'm sorry, Dale.

521
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:11,868
Human brains are unique
and I can't tell you exactly

522
00:31:12,002 --> 00:31:13,471
why you're seeing this person.

523
00:31:14,204 --> 00:31:16,406
[doctor] But this I am sure of:

524
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:20,310
you need to undergo an operation
as soon as possible.

525
00:31:20,912 --> 00:31:22,913
We can't have your AVM rupture

526
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:26,384
and you just die
all of a sudden.

527
00:31:27,652 --> 00:31:29,519
All operations have risk.

528
00:31:30,087 --> 00:31:32,457
If the operation is successful,

529
00:31:32,589 --> 00:31:37,228
you either go on living
or you might become a vegetable.

530
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:38,997
If it fails...

531
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:41,665
well, you won't wake up.

532
00:31:42,634 --> 00:31:43,534
Let's do it, then.

533
00:31:44,535 --> 00:31:45,803
Let's do the operation.

534
00:31:45,936 --> 00:31:47,271
[emotional music playing]

535
00:31:47,404 --> 00:31:49,574
[Dale]
If I die or become a vegetable,

536
00:31:51,375 --> 00:31:52,277
sorry, Mom.

537
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:54,244
Sorry, Dad.

538
00:31:55,145 --> 00:31:56,247
[Dale] Sorry, bro.

539
00:31:57,448 --> 00:31:59,549
[Evita sobbing]

540
00:31:59,983 --> 00:32:01,219
Dale...

541
00:32:02,252 --> 00:32:03,820
[Dale]
But there's a chance I can live.

542
00:32:03,954 --> 00:32:05,823
[Dale and Evita crying]

543
00:32:05,957 --> 00:32:07,125
[Dale] That's what's important.

544
00:32:22,539 --> 00:32:25,143
I don't think
I can go to the ball with you.

545
00:32:27,577 --> 00:32:31,182
I don't know how my surgery
will turn out.

546
00:32:33,084 --> 00:32:35,118
The ball doesn't matter, Dale.

547
00:32:35,886 --> 00:32:36,621
You.

548
00:32:37,755 --> 00:32:39,123
You matter.

549
00:32:40,424 --> 00:32:42,160
[Michiko]
So don't think about that, okay?

550
00:32:43,361 --> 00:32:44,261
Just...

551
00:32:45,529 --> 00:32:47,597
promise me
you'll take care of yourself.

552
00:32:49,666 --> 00:32:51,435
Take care of Bogz.

553
00:32:52,703 --> 00:32:54,505
Don't talk like that.

554
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,109
Your surgery will be successful.

555
00:33:01,778 --> 00:33:02,613
Hopefully.

556
00:33:04,915 --> 00:33:07,085
Because
I still wanna be with you.

557
00:33:09,721 --> 00:33:10,288
[kisses]

558
00:33:11,088 --> 00:33:11,722
You know what?

559
00:33:12,856 --> 00:33:14,325
Before coming here,

560
00:33:15,727 --> 00:33:17,327
I wanted to ask you...

561
00:33:18,261 --> 00:33:19,998
if we could be together
officially.

562
00:33:22,599 --> 00:33:23,701
But I realized,

563
00:33:24,868 --> 00:33:26,304
that's so selfish of me...

564
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:30,474
because
there's a chance I can die.

565
00:33:33,478 --> 00:33:35,445
Then,
you'd be losing two boyfriends.

566
00:33:36,413 --> 00:33:39,349
Me and Tob in just one year,

567
00:33:40,617 --> 00:33:43,421
if ever I don't make it.

568
00:33:46,124 --> 00:33:47,592
I love you, Michiko.

569
00:33:48,393 --> 00:33:50,795
[emotional music swelling]

570
00:33:50,928 --> 00:33:52,630
You don't have to be
my girlfriend.

571
00:33:55,866 --> 00:33:57,300
Loving you is enough.

572
00:34:22,527 --> 00:34:25,797
Should I tell Max, Baby Kiah?

573
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:37,875
[line ringing]

574
00:34:38,009 --> 00:34:40,545
[phone ringing]

575
00:34:44,148 --> 00:34:45,115
Hey, Deib.

576
00:34:45,817 --> 00:34:46,851
Update on Kiah?

577
00:34:47,818 --> 00:34:48,820
He's okay.

578
00:34:49,152 --> 00:34:52,289
Just a bit sad and anxious.

579
00:34:52,789 --> 00:34:53,757
Why?

580
00:34:56,827 --> 00:34:59,496
He doesn't know what
he can do for his brother.

581
00:35:00,998 --> 00:35:03,534
Deib, what's the problem?

582
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:08,206
Max,
Dale needs to undergo surgery.

583
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:10,574
And I'm scared.

584
00:35:11,675 --> 00:35:13,443
What if
he doesn't make it this time?

585
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:15,445
Deib...

586
00:35:16,581 --> 00:35:19,416
Don't worry. Dale will make it.

587
00:35:20,016 --> 00:35:21,018
He made it out of his coma,

588
00:35:21,152 --> 00:35:23,121
he'll make it through
the surgery.

589
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:26,123
Wish I was there
so I can hug you.

590
00:35:28,992 --> 00:35:32,929
If you need someone to talk to,
I'll be here.

591
00:35:33,364 --> 00:35:34,798
You can just call me anytime.

592
00:35:38,768 --> 00:35:39,871
Why are you still here?

593
00:35:40,505 --> 00:35:43,039
You'll be late for class.

594
00:35:43,608 --> 00:35:45,409
I'm not going to school,
big bro.

595
00:35:46,077 --> 00:35:47,311
This is more important.

596
00:35:49,947 --> 00:35:51,815
Take care of Mom and Dad, okay?

597
00:35:52,382 --> 00:35:53,583
Just in case...

598
00:35:54,117 --> 00:35:54,818
you know.

599
00:35:54,952 --> 00:35:55,652
Big bro,

600
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:58,188
there's no "just in case."

601
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:01,525
The operation
will be successful, okay?

602
00:36:02,092 --> 00:36:03,193
You'll make it!

603
00:36:03,827 --> 00:36:06,097
Don't leave me
with the parentals.

604
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:07,565
[both chuckle]

605
00:36:07,697 --> 00:36:09,000
[Deib]
I can't handle them alone!

606
00:36:09,132 --> 00:36:11,568
Two on one?
They'd eat me alive!

607
00:36:12,936 --> 00:36:15,940
Besides,
you're better with them.

608
00:36:17,074 --> 00:36:19,943
You know exactly what to say
to make them happy.

609
00:36:22,213 --> 00:36:24,447
I only know
how to make them angry.

610
00:36:25,215 --> 00:36:26,483
Don't say that, bro.

611
00:36:27,184 --> 00:36:28,552
Mom and Dad love you.

612
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:31,289
You make them so happy.

613
00:36:32,222 --> 00:36:33,490
[Dale]
Even if you don't believe it.

614
00:36:37,295 --> 00:36:38,362
[Dale] Mom and Dad,

615
00:36:39,329 --> 00:36:40,565
whenever they're sad,

616
00:36:41,798 --> 00:36:42,833
just make them laugh.

617
00:36:44,268 --> 00:36:45,202
[Dale] Love them.

618
00:36:45,969 --> 00:36:47,538
Even when it's tough.

619
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:50,106
We will love them, big bro.

620
00:36:50,407 --> 00:36:52,409
Together, okay?

621
00:36:52,976 --> 00:36:54,411
[Deib] The two of us.

622
00:36:54,945 --> 00:36:55,913
Love you, bro.

623
00:36:56,414 --> 00:36:58,315
I love you so much, big bro.

624
00:36:59,583 --> 00:37:01,485
I want you to promise me...

625
00:37:02,519 --> 00:37:04,621
that you'll make sure
that Michiko's okay.

626
00:37:05,255 --> 00:37:06,856
[Dale] She deserves to be happy.

627
00:37:09,025 --> 00:37:09,860
[Dale] You, too.

628
00:37:10,827 --> 00:37:12,329
You deserve to be happy.

629
00:37:14,431 --> 00:37:16,567
[Dale]
Get back together with Max.

630
00:37:16,833 --> 00:37:17,835
I know you want to.

631
00:37:19,302 --> 00:37:21,005
If not,
I'll haunt you as a ghost.

632
00:37:21,137 --> 00:37:22,440
Big bro!

633
00:37:23,239 --> 00:37:25,509
[roughhousing]

634
00:37:32,382 --> 00:37:34,318
[Mr. Mancol]
When you had your egg babies,

635
00:37:34,452 --> 00:37:36,387
you learned
how to show compassion

636
00:37:36,519 --> 00:37:37,989
and take responsibility.

637
00:37:38,989 --> 00:37:41,291
I'd like to hear from this class

638
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:44,427
what your insights are
after this activity.

639
00:37:45,996 --> 00:37:46,764
Anyone?

640
00:37:50,467 --> 00:37:51,402
[Mr. Mancol] Yes, Michiko?

641
00:38:06,083 --> 00:38:07,952
I broke my egg baby yesterday.

642
00:38:10,153 --> 00:38:11,289
His name was Bogz.

643
00:38:13,423 --> 00:38:14,592
I cried so hard.

644
00:38:16,827 --> 00:38:18,496
I realized...

645
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:22,632
no matter how much I try
to take care of something,

646
00:38:24,434 --> 00:38:25,670
it can break,

647
00:38:27,038 --> 00:38:27,972
it will end...

648
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,474
And that's life.

649
00:38:31,641 --> 00:38:33,010
[Michiko]
You can be gone in a minute.

650
00:38:34,344 --> 00:38:36,313
You may not wake up
the next day.

651
00:38:37,047 --> 00:38:38,048
We're just passing by.

652
00:38:39,884 --> 00:38:41,786
And the people we meet
along the way?

653
00:38:45,722 --> 00:38:49,092
What if this is our only chance
to be with them?

654
00:38:50,527 --> 00:38:52,063
So we always
have to seize the day,

655
00:38:53,297 --> 00:38:54,632
embrace the moment...

656
00:38:55,532 --> 00:38:56,833
before it's gone.

657
00:38:58,335 --> 00:38:59,804
Don't let fear stop you.

658
00:39:00,637 --> 00:39:01,771
If you love someone,

659
00:39:02,907 --> 00:39:03,907
show them.

660
00:39:05,041 --> 00:39:06,010
Tell them.

661
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:10,014
[Michiko] I don't wanna
have regrets and what ifs.

662
00:39:10,815 --> 00:39:14,351
Life is short.
And death will surely come.

663
00:39:15,052 --> 00:39:18,356
But I choose to live.

664
00:39:19,123 --> 00:39:20,657
And I choose to love.

665
00:39:21,659 --> 00:39:24,494
Because
I'm not afraid of life ending.

666
00:39:25,896 --> 00:39:29,367
I'm afraid of never truly living
because I didn't love at all.

667
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,067
Dale...

668
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:30,768
[door opens]

669
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:31,469
-Are you ready...
-Hi, Mom.

670
00:39:31,601 --> 00:39:32,936
for the surgery tomorrow?

671
00:39:33,436 --> 00:39:34,038
Feeling good.

672
00:39:35,572 --> 00:39:36,606
Michiko, come in!

673
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:38,809
[Dale] You're here early.

674
00:39:44,081 --> 00:39:44,882
Dale,

675
00:39:45,483 --> 00:39:46,684
I know...

676
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:50,588
you don't want us to be a couple
because you're afraid

677
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:52,822
I'll be in so much pain
after you're gone.

678
00:39:53,657 --> 00:39:55,458
[Michiko]
But I can handle the pain.

679
00:39:57,260 --> 00:40:03,501
I'd regret it more if this would
be the only time we have left,

680
00:40:04,668 --> 00:40:06,936
and I still didn't choose
to be your girlfriend.

681
00:40:08,172 --> 00:40:08,806
[exhales]

682
00:40:09,639 --> 00:40:11,541
I love you so much, Dale.

683
00:40:14,512 --> 00:40:16,045
Will you be my boyfriend?

684
00:40:18,148 --> 00:40:22,585
It will be my life's biggest
honor to be your boyfriend,

685
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:24,054
Michiko Tarranza.

686
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:27,090
I love you.

687
00:40:27,224 --> 00:40:29,559
[applause]

688
00:40:29,693 --> 00:40:30,927
Let's go, big bro!

689
00:40:33,963 --> 00:40:34,998
Love,

690
00:40:35,932 --> 00:40:37,768
there's something I wanna do...

691
00:40:38,668 --> 00:40:39,769
What is it, Love?

692
00:40:40,971 --> 00:40:42,039
Dale Enrile,

693
00:40:43,974 --> 00:40:45,041
dance with me?

694
00:40:51,648 --> 00:40:52,916
You're gonna dance, boy.

695
00:40:55,018 --> 00:40:56,554
[Deib] 3, 2, 1...

696
00:40:56,686 --> 00:40:57,987
[Deib grunting]

697
00:40:58,956 --> 00:40:59,824
[laughing]

698
00:41:00,623 --> 00:41:01,692
Thanks, Dad.

699
00:41:01,826 --> 00:41:04,494
["Hindi Kita Iiwan"
by Sam Milby playing]

700
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:06,197
-[Deib] You take it from here!
-I can do this.

701
00:41:06,996 --> 00:41:08,231
-I got him.
-Slowly, big bro.

702
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:09,967
[Daniel] You good?

703
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:12,670
Thank you. She's got me.

704
00:41:13,369 --> 00:41:13,971
[Dale] Thanks, Dad.

705
00:41:14,103 --> 00:41:14,737
[Daniel] Okay.

706
00:41:17,373 --> 00:41:18,074
[Dale] You okay?

707
00:41:18,509 --> 00:41:19,108
Yeah.

â™ª I'll never hurt you â™ª

00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,882
â™ª Please be mine â™ª

â™ª I'll never leave you â™ª

â™ª Please be mine â™ª

712
00:41:46,536 --> 00:41:48,204
I love you so much, Dale.

713
00:41:51,007 --> 00:41:53,277
I will love you
for the rest of my life.

714
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:57,581
So come back to me.

715
00:42:01,217 --> 00:42:02,353
I love you, Michiko.

716
00:42:04,588 --> 00:42:06,090
[Dale]
I'm gonna keep loving you...

717
00:42:10,728 --> 00:42:12,295
until my last breath.

718
00:42:12,695 --> 00:42:15,798
â™ª I'll never leave you â™ª

719
00:42:15,932 --> 00:42:18,902
â™ª I'll always take care of you â™ª

720
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:25,809
â™ª I'll never make you cry â™ª

721
00:42:25,943 --> 00:42:28,913
â™ª I'll never leave you â™ª

722
00:42:29,045 --> 00:42:32,650
â™ª I'll always take care of you â™ª

723
00:42:32,782 --> 00:42:35,619
â™ª I'll never hurt you â™ª

724
00:42:35,753 --> 00:42:39,489
â™ª Please be mine â™ª

725
00:42:39,623 --> 00:42:43,226
â™ª I'll never leave you â™ª

726
00:42:46,429 --> 00:42:48,599
â™ª I'll never leave you â™ª

727
00:42:48,731 --> 00:42:49,766
Dale...

728
00:42:50,668 --> 00:42:51,635
Love...

729
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:54,271
The sun's up.

730
00:42:55,505 --> 00:42:56,706
Wake up.

731
00:42:57,541 --> 00:42:59,677
You told me to wake you up.

732
00:43:01,711 --> 00:43:02,780
It's time.

733
00:43:03,681 --> 00:43:04,681
Dale.

734
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:09,753
Dale.

735
00:43:12,188 --> 00:43:12,956
Dale?

736
00:43:17,695 --> 00:43:18,762
[Michiko] Dale...

737
00:43:21,231 --> 00:43:22,032
Dale?

738
00:43:22,833 --> 00:43:26,003
["I Just Miss You"
by Andreah playing]

739
00:43:28,038 --> 00:43:28,905
Dale.

740
00:43:32,309 --> 00:43:32,943
Dale!

741
00:43:33,077 --> 00:43:33,978
Big bro?

742
00:43:35,378 --> 00:43:36,413
-Big bro?
-[Michiko] Dale!

743
00:43:38,581 --> 00:43:39,817
[sobbing]

744
00:43:42,186 --> 00:43:43,052
Dale.

745
00:43:45,021 --> 00:43:45,822
Big bro?

746
00:43:48,492 --> 00:43:51,195
â™ª I'm counting down the hours
'Til I see you â™ª

747
00:43:51,327 --> 00:43:54,431
â™ª But what do I do
When you're gone â™ª

748
00:43:54,565 --> 00:43:57,300
â™ª I'm counting all the seconds
In the minutes â™ª

749
00:43:57,434 --> 00:44:00,737
â™ª But I'm all alone â™ª

750
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:08,144
â™ª What do I do â™ª

751
00:44:09,445 --> 00:44:11,849
â™ª To get through the day,
Every day â™ª

752
00:44:11,981 --> 00:44:14,952
â™ª So I don't have
To miss your face â™ª

753
00:44:15,552 --> 00:44:20,257
â™ª What do I do â™ª

754
00:44:21,391 --> 00:44:23,726
â™ª To keep being strong
And carrying on â™ª

755
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:26,463
â™ª So I see another day â™ª

756
00:44:26,597 --> 00:44:27,864
â™ª I just miss you â™ª

757
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:30,934
â™ª I just miss you â™ª

758
00:44:32,369 --> 00:44:33,836
â™ª I just miss you â™ª

759
00:44:37,807 --> 00:44:46,750
[sobbing]

760
00:45:04,501 --> 00:45:05,436
It's okay, baby.

761
00:45:05,802 --> 00:45:11,375
â™ª What do I do â™ª

762
00:45:12,476 --> 00:45:14,878
â™ª To get through the day,
Every day â™ª

763
00:45:15,012 --> 00:45:18,449
â™ª So I don't have
To miss your face â™ª

764
00:45:19,083 --> 00:45:20,284
We love you, Dale.

765
00:45:51,148 --> 00:45:53,916
[Deib] This is the hardest thing
I'd ever have to do.

766
00:46:07,998 --> 00:46:09,967
Max, can I talk to you?

767
00:46:10,099 --> 00:46:11,969
[Deib] I'm sorry.
I can't go to the ball with you.

768
00:46:12,101 --> 00:46:13,804
[Deib] I feel like there's
no space in my heart

769
00:46:13,936 --> 00:46:14,737
for anything else.

770
00:46:14,871 --> 00:46:17,074
The ball. College.

771
00:46:17,206 --> 00:46:18,208
Us.

772
00:46:18,541 --> 00:46:20,878
Even for us?

773
00:46:21,344 --> 00:46:22,980
[Max] It's hard
when there's nothing you can do

774
00:46:23,112 --> 00:46:24,681
to help someone you love.

775
00:46:24,815 --> 00:46:26,617
No matter
how much you love someone,

776
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:28,184
sometimes
you have to give them space.

777
00:46:29,719 --> 00:46:30,721
It's our last week at school.

778
00:46:30,853 --> 00:46:31,521
What will happen
to our friendship

779
00:46:31,655 --> 00:46:33,157
once we go our separate ways?

780
00:46:35,224 --> 00:46:37,427
[Lorde]
Benisonians, it's time to party!

781
00:46:37,561 --> 00:46:39,496
[friends] Hoo-hah!

782
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:43,333
Thanks, Lee. You've made another
dream of mine come true.

783
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:45,969
I got a text saying
"meet me outside."

784
00:46:46,103 --> 00:46:47,838
-Stop me!
-It must be Tob!

785
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:52,775
Tob, I read your email.
I understand now.

786
00:46:52,909 --> 00:46:54,344
You still don't want to go?

787
00:46:59,016 --> 00:47:01,351
[Maxim] Are you volunteering
to be Max's date?

788
00:47:03,519 --> 00:47:06,956
[Max] To the person who gave me
his whole heart, I love you.

789
00:47:08,324 --> 00:47:09,559
[Max] I hope you know that.
