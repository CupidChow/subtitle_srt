00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:06,538
[Deib] James Baldwin once said,
"Love is a growing up."

2
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:08,875
When you love someone,

3
00:00:09,708 --> 00:00:12,978
you want to grow up.
You want to be better.

4
00:00:14,446 --> 00:00:16,449
You want to become
the best version of yourself

5
00:00:16,582 --> 00:00:19,118
because you know they
deserve that version of you.

6
00:00:21,221 --> 00:00:24,724
And when you really
love someone, you don't stop.

7
00:00:26,458 --> 00:00:28,460
You don't stop
thinking about them.

8
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:31,164
You don't stop caring for them.

9
00:00:31,998 --> 00:00:33,500
You don't stop trusting them.

10
00:00:34,734 --> 00:00:36,268
You don't stop loving them.

11
00:00:37,404 --> 00:00:41,106
You just don't stop. Ever.

12
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:45,210
Life will always
challenge that love.

13
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,381
And just when you've conquered
one challenge,

14
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,551
you're faced with another,

15
00:00:52,819 --> 00:00:54,154
and another...

16
00:00:55,121 --> 00:00:56,256
and another.

17
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:58,625
Life isn't perfect

18
00:00:58,758 --> 00:01:00,627
and you can't stop it
from happening.

19
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:03,195
You just have to go through it.

20
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:06,132
There is no telling
what will happen.

21
00:01:07,299 --> 00:01:09,569
No matter how much
you prepare for the unexpected,

22
00:01:10,602 --> 00:01:13,338
life will always find a way
of surprising you.

23
00:01:19,344 --> 00:01:22,748
[Deib] This is the hardest thing
I'll ever have to do.

24
00:01:24,683 --> 00:01:25,751
So please bear with me.

25
00:01:29,588 --> 00:01:31,224
-[Deib] While writing this...
-[somber music playing]

26
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:34,828
I knew that there were no words

27
00:01:35,561 --> 00:01:40,299
that can describe fully how
my brother Dale was as a person.

28
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:43,736
Just how amazing he was...

29
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:45,737
How loving,

30
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,474
and perfect he was

31
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:50,742
as a son...

32
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:54,546
as my brother.

33
00:01:58,218 --> 00:02:00,352
I didn't choose him
for a sibling.

34
00:02:03,322 --> 00:02:05,492
But if I had a choice,
I would still choose him.

35
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:08,828
[Deib] I would choose him
over and over again.

36
00:02:12,931 --> 00:02:14,167
He was a great teammate

37
00:02:16,002 --> 00:02:17,336
and an even better friend.

38
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:19,305
[Deib sniffles]

39
00:02:20,105 --> 00:02:21,373
[Deib] He was there for you...

40
00:02:22,641 --> 00:02:25,211
He made sure to be there for you
even at your lowest point.

41
00:02:27,312 --> 00:02:28,448
If he loved you,

42
00:02:29,681 --> 00:02:31,751
he made sure
you knew it and felt it.

43
00:02:32,585 --> 00:02:34,419
He really made you feel
his love.

44
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:40,492
I imagine, he would have been
a great husband and dad, too.

45
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:44,796
Though his life was short,

46
00:02:45,931 --> 00:02:50,569
Dale's life, until the very end,
was filled with love.

47
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:55,341
Loyalty,

48
00:02:56,876 --> 00:02:57,644
trust,

49
00:02:59,812 --> 00:03:00,513
honor,

50
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:02,681
joy,

51
00:03:04,383 --> 00:03:05,384
and wonder.

52
00:03:07,219 --> 00:03:09,187
These are all the words
my brother lived by.

53
00:03:10,723 --> 00:03:13,425
[Deib]
He may not be with us today,

54
00:03:15,895 --> 00:03:18,431
but his legacy
will remain with us forever.

55
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:28,307
-[Elle] My condolences.
-Thank you.

56
00:03:31,176 --> 00:03:33,045
[Deib sniffles, exhales deeply]

57
00:03:34,212 --> 00:03:36,248
[Deib] The greatest thing
that my big brother taught me...

58
00:03:39,018 --> 00:03:41,520
The greatest thing that my big
brother taught me about love...

59
00:03:44,924 --> 00:03:46,459
is that love is staying.

60
00:03:52,131 --> 00:03:53,265
[Deib]
The love that conquers all

61
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:54,901
is the love
that stays through it all.

62
00:03:56,536 --> 00:03:58,805
Just as those we love
never truly leave us.

63
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:03,842
We are just waiting for the day
we get to be with them again

64
00:04:05,877 --> 00:04:06,746
in another place,

65
00:04:10,182 --> 00:04:11,217
in another time.

66
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:16,488
To my brother,

67
00:04:20,158 --> 00:04:21,326
my mentor,

68
00:04:25,163 --> 00:04:26,432
my forever idol,

69
00:04:29,101 --> 00:04:30,235
my best friend,

70
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:34,740
I love you.

71
00:04:37,509 --> 00:04:38,778
I'm gonna miss you.

72
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:41,848
â™ª I'm trying to hold on â™ª

73
00:04:42,814 --> 00:04:45,651
â™ª I'm trying
To catch my breath â™ª

74
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:50,355
â™ª I'm trying to swim,
But I just sink â™ª

75
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:54,593
â™ª I'm trying to keep my faith â™ª

76
00:04:54,726 --> 00:04:57,829
â™ª I'm trying to find my way â™ª

77
00:04:57,963 --> 00:05:02,668
â™ª But what do you do
when you've got nothing left â™ª

78
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:07,372
â™ª I'm counting down the hours
Till I see you â™ª

79
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:10,475
â™ª But what do I do
When you're gone â™ª

80
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:13,146
â™ª I'm counting all the seconds
And the minutes â™ª

81
00:05:13,278 --> 00:05:16,382
â™ª But I'm all alone â™ª

82
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:24,357
â™ª What do I do â™ª

83
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:27,526
â™ª To get through the day,
Every day â™ª

84
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:31,163
â™ª So I don't have to
Miss your face â™ª

85
00:05:31,297 --> 00:05:36,569
â™ª And what do I do â™ª

86
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,538
â™ª To keep being strong
And carrying on â™ª

87
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:42,208
â™ª So I see another day â™ª

88
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:52,317
â™ª I just miss you â™ª

-[inhales, exhales deeply]
-[footsteps approaching]

90
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:14,507
[housemaid] Ma'am?

91
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:16,375
How is he?

92
00:06:16,975 --> 00:06:18,478
Still not eating.

93
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:20,646
Okay, just put it there.

94
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:26,752
[housemaid 2] Ma'am?

95
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:27,319
Hmm?

96
00:06:27,452 --> 00:06:28,788
Max is here.

97
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,055
Max...

98
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:31,124
Good morning, Auntie.

99
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:34,459
How are you?

100
00:06:35,427 --> 00:06:37,463
Okay. Coping.

101
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,632
[Evita] But Deib,

102
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,769
ever since his brother
passed away...

103
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:44,803
[Evita sighs]

104
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:46,706
Has he opened up to you
about it?

105
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:48,975
Not really.

106
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:52,512
That's why I came here.
I'm worried about him.

107
00:06:53,512 --> 00:06:55,648
I hope you can make him
open up to you.

108
00:06:57,016 --> 00:06:58,084
[Evita] Thank you, Max.

109
00:07:01,954 --> 00:07:02,922
[door opens]

110
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,735
[door closes]

111
00:07:52,204 --> 00:07:52,838
Deib?

112
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:55,675
Deib?

113
00:07:55,807 --> 00:07:56,608
Wake up.

114
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:58,177
You have to eat.

115
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:01,180
Deib...

116
00:08:05,851 --> 00:08:06,552
Max?

117
00:08:10,355 --> 00:08:11,557
What are you doing here?

118
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:14,125
I was supposed to go to school

119
00:08:14,259 --> 00:08:16,928
but I knew I won't be able
to focus out of worry for you--

120
00:08:17,062 --> 00:08:18,163
You cut class?

121
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:20,365
[Deib] You might miss out--

122
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:25,004
It's just clearance today.
Optional college prep seminars.

123
00:08:26,504 --> 00:08:27,540
Max, your dad might get angry--

124
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:29,141
I asked Dad for permission.

125
00:08:30,776 --> 00:08:32,510
I'll be spending this day
with you.

126
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:34,080
Ah!

127
00:08:34,212 --> 00:08:34,947
By the way...

128
00:08:37,682 --> 00:08:38,618
What's that?

129
00:08:40,285 --> 00:08:41,553
Here...

130
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,755
I saved all the notes
for the classes you missed.

131
00:08:44,456 --> 00:08:46,625
I also put the schedules
and requirements

132
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:48,693
for the different university
entrance exams here.

133
00:08:49,427 --> 00:08:50,629
I know you wanna
take Engineering

134
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:52,163
at Stella Orientis University,

135
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:53,932
and you're gonna pass for sure,

136
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:55,234
but just in case,

137
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:58,604
I also saved application forms
for other colleges.

138
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:01,039
And I opened online
application accounts too.

139
00:09:01,173 --> 00:09:06,479
This is your password for all
accounts - all caps SENSUI2022.

140
00:09:06,611 --> 00:09:07,980
Cheesy, I know,
but I couldn't think of--

141
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:09,715
You did all this for me?

142
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:13,785
What a hassle for you, Max.

143
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:16,788
I'm sorry.

144
00:09:17,756 --> 00:09:19,591
It's okay, I wanted to.

145
00:09:20,225 --> 00:09:22,528
I should be the one
doing all of this, not you.

146
00:09:24,496 --> 00:09:25,130
I will...

147
00:09:25,664 --> 00:09:26,765
I just...

148
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:28,033
[Max] You're not
in the right headspace yet.

149
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,201
I understand.

150
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,773
Thank you for doing all of this,
Max.

151
00:09:35,106 --> 00:09:36,042
You're welcome.

152
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:38,811
[Max] Come on. Eat.

153
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:44,984
You know,

154
00:09:46,184 --> 00:09:49,522
I've been feeling the energy
shift at school lately.

155
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:53,058
[Max] You can feel that the
school year is about to end.

156
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:55,528
Max, how did you feel when
your mom passed away?

157
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:57,129
[melancholic music playing]

158
00:10:09,841 --> 00:10:10,809
Mixed emotions.

159
00:10:13,645 --> 00:10:14,312
But above all,

160
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,783
it was painful...

161
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:26,192
It was painful because I wasn't
there for her last moments.

162
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:30,096
I wasn't able to say goodbye.

163
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:34,200
I couldn't tell my mom
"I love you"

164
00:10:34,332 --> 00:10:35,067
before she passed away.

165
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:38,604
It's difficult because...

166
00:10:39,871 --> 00:10:41,706
no matter
how much time has passed,

167
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:44,376
the pain is still with me.

168
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:47,679
I still feel the loneliness.

169
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:52,618
I'm grateful that I have
Grandma Bhaves and Uncle Boyet.

170
00:10:55,587 --> 00:10:57,155
We leaned on each other
for support.

171
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:02,128
Having each other
makes it less painful.

172
00:11:02,794 --> 00:11:04,697
RJ's friendship helped too.

173
00:11:06,698 --> 00:11:10,302
You learn to live with the pain
after some time.

174
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:12,772
[Max] Deib,

175
00:11:13,972 --> 00:11:16,274
I know you're in so much pain,

176
00:11:17,743 --> 00:11:19,110
but I hope you know...

177
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:22,648
that I'm just here for you.

178
00:11:23,481 --> 00:11:24,716
I will be with you.

179
00:11:25,884 --> 00:11:27,253
I will support you.

180
00:11:36,961 --> 00:11:38,297
[Naih] I'm worried.

181
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:39,230
[school bell rings]

182
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:44,035
Deib, Michiko,
and Max are all absent.

183
00:11:44,702 --> 00:11:46,471
Max just visited Deib, Naih.

184
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:50,308
Besides,
I'm more worried about Michiko.

185
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:53,645
Actually, I've been checking
the group chat.

186
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:55,681
She's been completely silent.

187
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:58,451
Yeah, I haven't seen her online.

188
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:02,053
I'm sure, just like Deib,
she's still mourning Dale.

189
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,221
Yeah.

190
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:07,259
Hey, look! The time capsule!
It's been filled!

191
00:12:13,698 --> 00:12:14,799
Oh, yeah.

192
00:12:15,366 --> 00:12:17,903
I still don't know
what I'm putting in.

193
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:19,337
What are you putting in?

194
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:23,808
-Here's mine.
-[poignant music playing]

195
00:12:23,942 --> 00:12:26,278
This is what I wanna remember
25 years from now.

196
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:32,551
You might forget about us
when you become a top vlogger!

197
00:12:32,684 --> 00:12:33,384
Of course not!

198
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,621
I'm gonna set a hangout for us
every Saturday

199
00:12:36,754 --> 00:12:37,822
at Master Deib's house!

200
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:41,360
We can even carpool if we all
study at Stella Orientis!

201
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:42,227
Nice!

202
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,462
Master Deib can be the driver.
Fun!

203
00:12:44,596 --> 00:12:49,268
I'll carpool with you since I'm
also going to Stella Orientis.

204
00:12:49,534 --> 00:12:50,668
How about you, Madam Elle?

205
00:12:50,802 --> 00:12:51,971
What course
are you taking in SOU?

206
00:12:52,671 --> 00:12:56,207
Well, I already got accepted
to the Fashion Design program

207
00:12:56,341 --> 00:12:58,943
in Parsons, New York.

208
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:01,947
Congrats, Elle!

209
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:04,450
I also got accepted to Parsons,
in their Fine Arts program.

210
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:05,817
I'm just waiting to hear
from NABA

211
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:07,886
'cause that's the school
I really wanna to go to.

212
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,855
Where's NABA, Master?
What does NABA stand for?

213
00:13:11,389 --> 00:13:13,859
NABA?
Nuova Accademia di Belle Arti.

214
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:15,961
It's the best arts
and design school in Italy.

215
00:13:16,394 --> 00:13:17,763
Are you applying there, too,
Ysay?

216
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:19,398
Yeah, I applied to NABA, too.

217
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:23,369
And the Design Program of
Australian National University.

218
00:13:24,102 --> 00:13:28,106
Most likely, I'm going to ANU.
Their program suits me better.

219
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,408
Wait a minute.

220
00:13:29,774 --> 00:13:30,942
My brain is buffering.

221
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:32,745
We'll have different time zones!

222
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:35,214
Philippines,
Europe, America, Australia.

223
00:13:35,847 --> 00:13:36,782
My gosh!

224
00:13:37,448 --> 00:13:40,052
President Migz, don't tell me
you're studying in Africa!

225
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:40,519
[chuckles]

226
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,453
You're so extra!

227
00:13:42,587 --> 00:13:44,756
No, actually,

228
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:47,692
I'm going to Pharos University.

229
00:13:47,826 --> 00:13:48,726
[friends gasp, exclaim]

230
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,261
-Congrats!
-[Migz] Thank you!

231
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:54,600
Max and I are going to be
classmates in Japan!

232
00:13:54,732 --> 00:13:56,168
[Ysay] Sounds fun!

233
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:59,504
Bro, you okay?

234
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:02,908
No, Master.

235
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:04,409
Just worried.

236
00:14:05,076 --> 00:14:05,878
What will happen
to our friendship

237
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:07,413
once we go our separate ways?

238
00:14:10,014 --> 00:14:11,049
[phone pings]

239
00:14:13,652 --> 00:14:15,019
Guys, I got a text from Max.

240
00:14:15,153 --> 00:14:15,988
[Naih] What did she say?

241
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,188
She needs our help.

242
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:24,062
[gentle music playing]

243
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:53,558
[Lee] Bro, Lee here.

244
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:56,861
I know you can hear us.

245
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:58,964
[Lee] The gang's all here.

246
00:14:59,631 --> 00:15:00,231
[Lorde] Master,

247
00:15:00,832 --> 00:15:01,933
I brought treats!

248
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,168
[Lorde] Eat up!

249
00:15:04,068 --> 00:15:06,337
Or else I'll eat it all up.

250
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:09,008
Including you!

251
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,942
[friends laughing]

252
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:17,416
[Ysay] Deib, that's my drawing.

253
00:15:18,683 --> 00:15:22,354
Your smiling face
was the easiest part to draw.

254
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:24,255
[Ysay] We hope to see it again.

255
00:15:24,389 --> 00:15:26,125
It's okay not to be okay, Deib.

256
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:29,727
We know you're sad...

257
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:31,562
and that's okay.

258
00:15:32,096 --> 00:15:33,432
It's okay to be sad.

259
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:35,200
[Naih] Deib...

260
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,037
I'm here for you.

261
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:40,972

We're all here for you, Deib.

Michiko, where have you been?
We've been worried.

265
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:46,605
[Migz] Are you okay?

266
00:16:47,905 --> 00:16:49,441
Yeah. Still fighting.

267
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:53,245
As we always say,
we're here for you, Michiko.

268
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,514
How's Deib?

269
00:16:56,914 --> 00:16:58,082
Holed up in his room.

270
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:00,184
[Lorde] Max is there, too.

271
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:01,552
Think they're doing
some funny business?

-Hey!
-Lorde!

273
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:09,294
What's up, girl?
Did something happen?

274
00:17:10,461 --> 00:17:13,164
I lost the letter Dale gave me.

275
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:15,433
And this.

00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:54,913
You'll make a great nurse.

359
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:56,248
[Daniel] Mhmm.

360
00:21:56,381 --> 00:22:01,353
Deib mentioned that you wanted
to be a nurse. Is that true?

361
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,388
Uh, before.

362
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:07,425
Now I wanna be a lawyer.

363
00:22:07,558 --> 00:22:09,493
[Evita] Ah, well.

364
00:22:09,627 --> 00:22:10,695
[Daniel]
You'll make a great lawyer!

365
00:22:10,828 --> 00:22:12,263
-[Evita] Yeah! [chuckles]
-[Daniel] Definitely!

366
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:13,999
[Daniel] So you're planning
to take pre-law

367
00:22:14,132 --> 00:22:15,933
at Stella Orientis with Deib?

368
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:20,105
Uh, I'm still thinking about it.

369
00:22:20,872 --> 00:22:23,575
I also got a scholarship
in Japan.

370
00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:24,710
[melancholic music playing]

371
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:27,746
-[Evita] Oh.
-[Daniel] Japan. Wow!

372
00:22:27,878 --> 00:22:28,613
Japan?

373
00:22:30,281 --> 00:22:31,682
Pharos University?

374
00:22:33,785 --> 00:22:36,988
I got the acceptance letter
when I was in Mindoro.

375
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:39,691
[Max] I couldn't find the timing
to tell you...

376
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:41,792
because of what happened
with Dale.

377
00:22:43,662 --> 00:22:47,766
Congrats, Max. I think
you'll do so well in Japan.

378
00:22:58,242 --> 00:22:59,443
You're varsity-level now!

379
00:23:04,415 --> 00:23:05,916
[RJ] You're in a mood.

380
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:07,885
What's wrong?

381
00:23:09,887 --> 00:23:10,588
Nothing.

382
00:23:14,526 --> 00:23:15,126
Give...

383
00:23:16,528 --> 00:23:17,596
me the ball.

384
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:20,164
Why are you in a mood?

385
00:23:22,032 --> 00:23:24,502
I think Deib and Max
are back together.

386
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:28,105
[Kim] So there's no way
he'll take me to the ball.

387
00:23:29,273 --> 00:23:29,974
[scoffs]

388
00:23:30,107 --> 00:23:32,778
As expected.
So you're giving up?

389
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:34,179
How about you?

390
00:23:34,613 --> 00:23:35,814
Have you accepted the fact

391
00:23:35,946 --> 00:23:38,415
that you can't have
another chance with Max anymore?

392
00:23:38,549 --> 00:23:40,419
[pensive music playing]

393
00:23:40,551 --> 00:23:43,721
Well, I've already accepted
my own fate

394
00:23:43,855 --> 00:23:47,192
after Max came back
from Mindoro.

395
00:23:48,292 --> 00:23:50,961
[Kim] I remember thinking
this could be my chance--

396
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:51,663
[Max] Deib.

397
00:23:53,298 --> 00:23:57,269
[Kim] I was there for Deib
and Max was not.

398
00:23:57,402 --> 00:23:59,336
But then you guys showed up...

399
00:24:00,238 --> 00:24:04,910
That moment I knew -
they were meant to be together.

400
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:07,746
When I saw
how much Deib needed her,

401
00:24:07,878 --> 00:24:10,015
I just knew
I had to take a step back.

402
00:24:11,215 --> 00:24:16,253
I knew I couldn't love or care
for Deib the way Max does.

403
00:24:17,521 --> 00:24:18,155
Wow.

404
00:24:19,857 --> 00:24:21,058
You're like a different person.

405
00:24:22,661 --> 00:24:23,761
You're becoming nicer.

406
00:24:24,328 --> 00:24:25,196
[scoffs]

407
00:24:25,329 --> 00:24:26,964
Well, it's your fault.

408
00:24:27,598 --> 00:24:30,868
You told me to try to be nice.

409
00:24:31,001 --> 00:24:32,971
So I'm a good influence on you.

410
00:24:35,073 --> 00:24:35,740
Whatever.

411
00:24:39,577 --> 00:24:40,945
Do you want to go to the ball?

412
00:24:42,413 --> 00:24:43,214
[Kim] Just for fun?

413
00:24:46,183 --> 00:24:48,953
Okay, I see.

414
00:24:49,753 --> 00:24:50,989
[Kim]
You're still in love with Max.

415
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:57,929
She's so lucky to have
two guys so in love with her.

416
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,835
I just hope that you find a girl

417
00:25:03,969 --> 00:25:06,704
who loves you
just as much as you love Max.

418
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:24,756
[Karlie] Naih,
the test won't be about makeup.

419
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:27,992
Try studying! Though you're
gonna fail the exam for sure!

420
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:29,394
Just shut up, Karlie.

421
00:25:30,494 --> 00:25:31,663
It's our last week at school,

422
00:25:31,796 --> 00:25:33,198
can't everyone
just try to be kind?

423

Max!

427
00:25:47,178 --> 00:25:47,846
Where's Deib?

428
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:51,048
At home.

429
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:54,219
He'll take the exam
some other time.

430
00:25:55,519 --> 00:25:56,820
I'm worried about him, Max.

431
00:25:57,855 --> 00:25:59,190
I hope he's okay.

432
00:25:59,857 --> 00:26:00,858
Thanks, Kim.

433
00:26:01,625 --> 00:26:02,861
I'll tell him.

[door opens]

435

Good morning, class!

[students] Good morning, sir!

437
00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:14,071
I will give you 45 minutes
to take the exam.

438

-After you finish the exam...
-[inspirational music playing]

439
00:26:16,674 --> 00:26:19,576
you have to fill out
the Benison Brave ballot

440
00:26:19,711 --> 00:26:21,078
attached to the exam paper.

441
00:26:21,846 --> 00:26:23,548
[Mr. Mancol] It's for
the Benison Brave award.

442
00:26:24,449 --> 00:26:27,952
You'll have to nominate who
you think deserves the award.

443
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,387
You can even nominate yourselves

444
00:26:31,355 --> 00:26:35,125
if you think you've displayed
courage and leadership

445
00:26:35,259 --> 00:26:36,126
throughout the year.

446
00:26:37,127 --> 00:26:39,064
No-brainer,
I'm voting for Master!

447
00:26:39,864 --> 00:26:43,101
Oh my God, Maxie! You got this!
Stop me!

448
00:26:43,969 --> 00:26:46,637
True!
After all the changes in school,

449
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:48,973
you deserve the Benison Brave!

450
00:26:49,406 --> 00:26:50,775
You brave queen!

Sure.

I feel like I just need to be
alone with my family.

00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:20,117
don't worry.

00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,701
just say it.

539
00:30:37,535 --> 00:30:38,269
Please.

540
00:30:41,138 --> 00:30:42,839
I feel so selfish...

541
00:30:43,607 --> 00:30:44,675
for saying this,

542
00:30:47,111 --> 00:30:49,948
especially because I see how
much you're taking care of me...

543
00:30:52,683 --> 00:30:53,984
I'm sad, Max.

544
00:30:54,484 --> 00:30:55,752
[heart-wrenching music playing]

545
00:30:56,487 --> 00:30:57,955
I'm really sad.

546
00:30:59,289 --> 00:31:00,258
[Deib inhales deeply]

547
00:31:02,759 --> 00:31:04,962
In ways
I never thought possible.

548
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:08,432
[Deib] I feel like there's
no space in my heart

549
00:31:08,566 --> 00:31:09,666
for anything else.

550
00:31:11,501 --> 00:31:12,237
[Deib] The ball.

551
00:31:13,637 --> 00:31:14,838
Graduation.

552
00:31:16,307 --> 00:31:17,008
[Deib] College.

553
00:31:18,542 --> 00:31:19,243
Us.

554
00:31:20,178 --> 00:31:20,979
[sniffling]

555
00:31:23,114 --> 00:31:25,083
Even for us?

556
00:31:26,416 --> 00:31:27,184
[Deib] Max...

557
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,890
Before my brother died,

558
00:31:34,992 --> 00:31:36,728
all I wanted was to be with you,

559
00:31:38,829 --> 00:31:39,931
to get us back.

560
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:45,303
I want to give you
my whole heart.

561
00:31:47,372 --> 00:31:49,773
[Deib] But after the hell
I put you through, Max,

562
00:31:53,443 --> 00:31:54,679
you deserve better.

563
00:31:57,382 --> 00:31:59,450
[Deib] You deserve so much
better than this person

564
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:00,751
in front of you right now...

565
00:32:01,219 --> 00:32:01,786
Deib...

566
00:32:03,153 --> 00:32:04,055
I wanna be better.

567
00:32:05,789 --> 00:32:07,157
[Deib] I wanna be okay again.

568
00:32:09,493 --> 00:32:10,761
I wanna be with you.

569
00:32:14,365 --> 00:32:15,365
Just not like this.

570
00:32:18,769 --> 00:32:19,770
Not right now.

571
00:32:24,241 --> 00:32:25,343
I understand.

572
00:32:29,212 --> 00:32:30,048
Thank you, Max.

573
00:32:33,417 --> 00:32:35,252
I'm sorry I'm hurting you.

574
00:32:35,752 --> 00:32:37,221
Shhh. Don't worry!

575
00:32:38,088 --> 00:32:38,855
It's fine.

576
00:32:42,059 --> 00:32:42,826
It's okay.

577
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:49,666
[sad music playing]

578
00:32:51,669 --> 00:32:52,670
[Max sniffles]

579
00:33:03,714 --> 00:33:04,715
[RJ] Are you okay?

580
00:33:08,786 --> 00:33:10,221
[sighs]

581
00:33:11,255 --> 00:33:12,990
It's hard not being able
to do anything

582
00:33:13,124 --> 00:33:14,892
to help the person you love.

583
00:33:17,761 --> 00:33:18,462
Sometimes,

584
00:33:20,263 --> 00:33:22,133
no matter
how much you love someone,

585
00:33:23,433 --> 00:33:24,935
you have to give them space.

586
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:30,708
That's how I felt
when I was in the US...

587
00:33:31,108 --> 00:33:33,009
when depression
was eating me up,

588
00:33:34,444 --> 00:33:35,480
but I didn't tell you.

589
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,249
[RJ] Deib's better...

590
00:33:39,616 --> 00:33:41,318
because he explained to you

591
00:33:42,185 --> 00:33:44,255
that he needed space and rest.

592
00:33:45,556 --> 00:33:47,157
Sorry you guys broke up.

593
00:33:49,126 --> 00:33:50,494
We didn't.

594
00:33:53,163 --> 00:33:55,333
Because we didn't get back
together in the first place.

595
00:33:57,402 --> 00:33:58,236
So...

596
00:34:01,905 --> 00:34:03,173
You're not
getting back together?

597
00:34:04,442 --> 00:34:05,410
Maybe if...

598
00:34:06,978 --> 00:34:08,913
I push through
with my scholarship in Japan.

599
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,382
Deib won't be okay with it
for sure.

600
00:34:13,184 --> 00:34:14,751
We've both been traumatized
by long distance relationships.

601
00:34:16,586 --> 00:34:18,755
You're not pushing through
with your scholarship in Japan?

602
00:34:19,623 --> 00:34:21,525
I need to give an answer

603
00:34:22,326 --> 00:34:24,228
about the scholarship
the day after the ball.

604
00:34:25,496 --> 00:34:26,931
[Max] I might decline.

605
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:31,402
I feel like it would be better
for Deib if I stay here.

606
00:34:32,936 --> 00:34:35,373
[Max] Remember
what he said at Dale's memorial?

607
00:34:36,541 --> 00:34:37,507
That "love is staying"?

608
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:42,380
So I think
I should stay here for him.

609
00:34:44,382 --> 00:34:45,483
[Boyet] Uh, excuse me...

610
00:34:49,052 --> 00:34:51,922
-I just wanna thank you all.
-[poignant music playing]

611
00:34:52,056 --> 00:34:55,893
Thank you, Zell, RJ, Randy...

612
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,161
Mom...

613
00:34:58,195 --> 00:35:00,764
Maxim, thank you for everything.

614
00:35:00,898 --> 00:35:04,302
Elle, thanks for accepting
and loving Max.

615
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:06,436
Of course, Max,

616
00:35:07,538 --> 00:35:09,206
thanks for fighting for me,

617
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:12,309
believing in me,

618
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:15,146
and never leaving me behind.

619
00:35:22,186 --> 00:35:26,490
Thanks
for enduring so much for me.

620
00:35:27,824 --> 00:35:29,327
Thank you so much.

621
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:31,862
[Boyet] Don't worry.

622
00:35:31,996 --> 00:35:34,264
Uncle will do better,

623
00:35:35,298 --> 00:35:39,536
especially now that Maxim gave
me a job at the Luna Factory.

624
00:35:39,871 --> 00:35:40,704
Wow!

625
00:35:41,204 --> 00:35:43,407
Treat me with
your first paycheck, okay?

626
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:45,242
Of course! Anything for you!

627
00:35:45,775 --> 00:35:46,811
I want you to be proud of me.

628
00:35:46,943 --> 00:35:48,211
[phone rings]

629
00:35:48,913 --> 00:35:51,548
Uncle, I'm very proud of you.

630
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:53,751
[Elle]
Hi, Mom! Yeah, we're done.

631
00:35:53,885 --> 00:35:56,521
Promise
I'll always be here for you.

632
00:35:58,155 --> 00:36:01,492
Dad, Mom said I have to go.

633
00:36:02,492 --> 00:36:03,094
Let's go.

634
00:36:03,427 --> 00:36:04,561
Grams,

635
00:36:04,695 --> 00:36:06,463
thank you. We'll get going.

636
00:36:06,597 --> 00:36:07,498
I'll go ahead, Attorney.

637
00:36:07,632 --> 00:36:08,331
[Randy] Take care.

638
00:36:10,735 --> 00:36:13,003
Bro, thank you again.

639
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:16,773
I hope we get to meet Macy
someday

640
00:36:16,907 --> 00:36:18,376
so we can thank her, too.

641
00:36:19,476 --> 00:36:20,244
When all's well.

642
00:36:28,385 --> 00:36:29,452
[Max]
They look good together, huh?

643
00:36:30,788 --> 00:36:32,190
Dad's smiling from ear to ear.

644
00:36:32,856 --> 00:36:33,490
True.

645
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:36,893
They didn't know how much pain
they would go through.

646
00:36:38,161 --> 00:36:40,398
They were just two kids in love.

647
00:36:41,565 --> 00:36:44,402
They're still in love.
They're just hurting right now.

648
00:36:46,971 --> 00:36:52,443
[distant conversation, laughter]

649
00:36:57,782 --> 00:36:58,615
Are you sure?

650
00:37:01,585 --> 00:37:02,552
So what do you think, huh?

651
00:37:03,521 --> 00:37:05,255
Good preparation so far.

652
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:08,192
I didn't disappoint you?
I can have that in writing.

653
00:37:09,527 --> 00:37:10,193
Auntie,

654
00:37:11,195 --> 00:37:12,630
can I talk to you?

655
00:37:16,934 --> 00:37:18,235
We'll talk later, Mace.

656
00:37:21,338 --> 00:37:22,273
Yes, Max?

657
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:24,976
Auntie...

658
00:37:25,943 --> 00:37:29,112
[Max] Moving out of Mindoro...

659
00:37:30,181 --> 00:37:33,150
was one of the hardest decisions
I ever made,

660
00:37:34,351 --> 00:37:36,353
but
it's also one of the happiest

661
00:37:37,355 --> 00:37:39,222
because it gave me a new family.

662
00:37:40,056 --> 00:37:45,061
I know you don't like me because
I remind you of an old wound,

663
00:37:48,398 --> 00:37:51,302
but I never meant
to ruin your family.

664
00:37:53,103 --> 00:37:55,172
[Max] Believe it or not,

665
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:59,510
I never thought that Mom
was Dad's great love.

666
00:38:01,378 --> 00:38:05,016
[Max] I've always known that
you're Dad's great love

667
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:08,318
because he's happiest
when he's with you.

668
00:38:09,353 --> 00:38:11,222
[Max] And the love
you have for each other,

669
00:38:12,155 --> 00:38:14,257
the one strengthened by time

670
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:16,693
and grace to forgive,

671
00:38:20,231 --> 00:38:22,532
that's the kind of love
I want for myself.

672
00:38:27,003 --> 00:38:28,005
[Max] Auntie,

673
00:38:29,507 --> 00:38:30,775
-I'm sorry.
-[touching music playing]

674
00:38:32,309 --> 00:38:34,277
[Max]
Sorry that my mother hurt you.

675
00:38:36,614 --> 00:38:38,048
Sorry, Aunt Macy.

676
00:38:39,282 --> 00:38:40,751
[Max] I'm really sorry.

677
00:38:53,431 --> 00:38:54,065
Max!

678
00:38:54,465 --> 00:38:54,798
Wait.

679
00:38:59,436 --> 00:39:02,039
[touching music swells]

680
00:39:02,572 --> 00:39:03,606
I'm so sorry.

681
00:39:04,942 --> 00:39:06,309
[Macy] Thank you for that, Max.

682
00:39:07,844 --> 00:39:09,780
I'm sorry that I hurt you.

683
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:12,248
[Macy] You didn't deserve that.

684
00:39:14,885 --> 00:39:16,420
It's not your fault

685
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,222
and you don't need to apologize.

686
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:25,396
[Macy] I am so sorry.

687
00:39:31,034 --> 00:39:31,768
-[Elle] Mom.
-[Macy] Come here, darling.

688
00:39:34,704 --> 00:39:36,407
[kisses]

689
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:43,313
Hi, Deib.

690
00:39:43,947 --> 00:39:44,581
You okay?

691
00:39:45,615 --> 00:39:46,117
Dad.

692
00:39:47,518 --> 00:39:48,085
Yeah.

693
00:39:51,588 --> 00:39:52,123
Sip?

694
00:40:06,771 --> 00:40:07,405
Thanks.

695
00:40:08,204 --> 00:40:08,938
Deib,

696
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:11,375
why don't you wanna go
to the ball?

697
00:40:11,509 --> 00:40:12,675
[Daniel] Be with your friends?

698
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:17,547
Are you trying
to get rid of me already?

699
00:40:18,081 --> 00:40:19,115
No.

700
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:24,621
I just thought it would be good
if you'd be with a happier,

701
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:25,789
livelier company.

702
00:40:25,922 --> 00:40:27,123
Be with the gang, you know?

703
00:40:27,891 --> 00:40:28,726
I wanna be here...

704
00:40:29,827 --> 00:40:30,494
with you guys.

705
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:32,496
I wanna be a better son.

706
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:35,599
I wanna make up
for all the times when...

707
00:40:37,534 --> 00:40:39,369
I wasn't the son you wanted...

708
00:40:41,572 --> 00:40:42,405
or deserved.

709
00:40:45,342 --> 00:40:46,309
Don't say that.

710
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:52,682
You're not the only one
with a lot to make up for.

711
00:40:55,351 --> 00:40:56,186
[Daniel] I'm...

712
00:40:58,556 --> 00:40:59,322
sorry.

713
00:40:59,856 --> 00:41:02,159
Sorry that I haven't been
a good father to you.

714
00:41:03,293 --> 00:41:05,195
[sentimental music playing]

715
00:41:05,596 --> 00:41:06,163
Dad,

716
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:10,800
I should be the one
saying sorry.

717
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:14,938
[Deib]
I've been a lot to handle.

718
00:41:16,306 --> 00:41:17,373
I'm sorry...

719
00:41:21,045 --> 00:41:23,547
I wasn't like my big brother.

720
00:41:28,018 --> 00:41:29,253
Like I said, he's like...

721
00:41:30,253 --> 00:41:31,889
this perfect son--

722

Come here.

723
00:41:44,768 --> 00:41:46,570
Your brother Dale
wasn't perfect.

724
00:41:47,938 --> 00:41:48,905
He was just...

725
00:41:50,139 --> 00:41:50,940
easier.

726
00:41:51,442 --> 00:41:52,610
[Daniel]
I knew how to handle him.

727
00:41:54,878 --> 00:41:55,545
With you,

728
00:41:58,114 --> 00:41:59,983
I felt incompetent.

730
00:42:04,722 --> 00:42:05,456
Stupid.

731
00:42:07,490 --> 00:42:10,327

right as your father.

732
00:42:12,061 --> 00:42:12,996
[Daniel] I felt lost.

733
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:17,701
I thought you hated me
or something.

734
00:42:21,304 --> 00:42:23,407
That's crazy 'cause
I felt the exact same way.

736
00:42:30,313 --> 00:42:30,914
[Deib] Dad,

737
00:42:31,547 --> 00:42:33,349
I'm trying to be a better son.

738
00:42:35,286 --> 00:42:37,521
[Deib] If you feel lost,

739
00:42:39,856 --> 00:42:40,757
we can talk.

740
00:42:44,427 --> 00:42:45,862
It could be our little secret...

741
00:42:47,764 --> 00:42:50,601

what you're doing.

And I promise I'll do better.

I'll be here for you
when you need me, son.

745
00:43:07,483 --> 00:43:08,619
[Daniel] Don't ever forget:

746

your father loves you very much.

[Daniel] We were just...

752
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:31,507
I was just talking to him
about the Benison Ball.

753
00:43:31,641 --> 00:43:33,242
I'm trying
to convince this boy to go.

754
00:43:33,376 --> 00:43:34,277
Aw.

755
00:43:34,411 --> 00:43:35,846

00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:27,498
I have a dress for you and
I'm sure you're gonna like it.

00:51:48,304 --> 00:51:50,574
Not you, Khloe my love.
You look like an angel.

903
00:51:50,706 --> 00:51:51,474
[Lee] Nice one, Lorde!

904
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:53,510
You delusional loser!

905
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:56,746
As if
you have a chance with Khloe!

906
00:51:57,914 --> 00:51:58,447
-Maybe.
-[sweet music plays]

907
00:51:58,581 --> 00:51:59,248
What?!

908
00:51:59,715 --> 00:52:00,416
[Karlie] Why?!

909
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:01,751
[Lee] Bro, you have a chance!

910
00:52:01,885 --> 00:52:02,652
Thank you, my Namesake!

911
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:04,887
You're the best Wingman!
Love You!

912
00:52:05,021 --> 00:52:07,456
Guys, stop squabbling.

913
00:52:07,757 --> 00:52:08,791
It's our last party together.

914
00:52:08,925 --> 00:52:11,327
Max's right. Let's enjoy it.

915
00:52:12,061 --> 00:52:13,762
Lee, have you seen your cousin?

916
00:52:13,896 --> 00:52:14,931
We were supposed
to come together,

917
00:52:15,065 --> 00:52:17,434
but we couldn't contact her.

918
00:52:18,501 --> 00:52:21,471
I haven't seen Kim.
But yeah, where is she?

919
00:52:26,775 --> 00:52:29,246
I honestly have no idea
why I'm doing this.

920
00:52:32,282 --> 00:52:34,351
This is the only way I'm
coming with you to the ball.

921
00:52:35,885 --> 00:52:37,086
[RJ]
But you don't need to do this.

922
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:40,556
Wanna get off?

923
00:52:42,025 --> 00:52:43,425
I didn't say that!

924
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:46,096
You really think
this is gonna work?

925
00:52:46,896 --> 00:52:48,097
At least we tried.

926
00:52:49,132 --> 00:52:50,567
So you really think
this is gonna work?

927
00:52:56,139 --> 00:52:57,206
[soft chuckle]

928
00:53:00,110 --> 00:53:02,913
[navigation] Keep straight then
exit right in 1.4 kilometers

929
00:53:03,045 --> 00:53:04,581
to Lipa, Batangas.

930
00:53:04,713 --> 00:53:06,248
[Max] So, Mom,

931
00:53:06,382 --> 00:53:08,818
does this mean
you're going back home?

932
00:53:09,786 --> 00:53:10,487
[Maxim chuckles]

933
00:53:10,619 --> 00:53:11,588
Of course, darling!

934
00:53:11,922 --> 00:53:12,489
Right, hon?

935
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:13,722
Hmm?

936
00:53:14,657 --> 00:53:15,692
Yes, hon!

937
00:53:16,293 --> 00:53:18,295
Elle, Maxrill,
and I miss you guys.

938
00:53:18,427 --> 00:53:20,463
Thank God
we're finally coming back home!

939
00:53:21,164 --> 00:53:23,099
I won't be alone
when you study in New York

940
00:53:23,233 --> 00:53:24,534
and Max studies in Japan.

941
00:53:26,936 --> 00:53:28,438
I might not go to Japan.

942
00:53:29,572 --> 00:53:30,773
Why not?

943
00:53:31,942 --> 00:53:33,275
Maybe I'll go next year.

944
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:36,146
I think
I need to study Japanese first,

945
00:53:36,278 --> 00:53:37,646
so studying there
won't be so difficult.

946
00:53:38,681 --> 00:53:39,682
-[pensive music playing]
-But darling...

947
00:53:39,815 --> 00:53:41,451
you're enrolling
in Pharos University precisely

948
00:53:41,585 --> 00:53:43,652
because
they offer courses in English.

949
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:45,688
You don't have to be fluent
in Japanese.

950
00:53:46,222 --> 00:53:47,157
Yes, but--

951
00:53:47,289 --> 00:53:48,592
You might be wasting
the opportunity.

952
00:53:49,259 --> 00:53:50,793
Will that still be
available next year?

953
00:53:53,096 --> 00:53:55,164
I don't know.

954
00:53:55,731 --> 00:53:56,800
Elle's right, Max.

955
00:53:57,367 --> 00:53:59,568
Not everyone
gets that kind of opportunity.

956
00:54:00,269 --> 00:54:01,570
[Macy] What's you holding
you back, sweetheart?

957
00:54:02,038 --> 00:54:03,139
Uh...

958
00:54:03,773 --> 00:54:04,507
The thing is...

959
00:54:07,409 --> 00:54:09,311
I don't wanna leave...

960
00:54:10,413 --> 00:54:11,648
if Deib's not okay.

961
00:54:12,148 --> 00:54:13,449
[Max] If we're not okay.

962
00:54:14,416 --> 00:54:15,117
[Maxim] Darling...

963
00:54:17,721 --> 00:54:19,389
I know you love Deib.

964
00:54:20,690 --> 00:54:22,259
[Maxim]
I know you want to help him

965
00:54:22,391 --> 00:54:23,626
through this difficult time.

966
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:26,695
I know
you want what's best for him.

967
00:54:27,864 --> 00:54:28,797
[Maxim] But the question is:

968
00:54:29,965 --> 00:54:31,268
what's best for you?

969
00:54:31,967 --> 00:54:33,436
What if...

970
00:54:33,570 --> 00:54:37,806
Deib decides that what's best
for him is not to be with you?

971
00:54:42,077 --> 00:54:43,313
[Lorde] Beautiful people!

972
00:54:43,445 --> 00:54:44,481
Please vote for me
as Benison King and of course,

973
00:54:44,614 --> 00:54:47,717
vote @KhloeGomez as my queen!

974
00:54:48,184 --> 00:54:50,519
Lorde,
what did you send in the group?!

975
00:54:50,987 --> 00:54:52,422
You as ball king? As if!

976
00:54:52,554 --> 00:54:54,190
Shut up!

977
00:54:54,324 --> 00:54:56,326
Quit crushing my dreams!

978
00:54:56,458 --> 00:54:58,862
Just vote for me! Or else Karlie
the curly troll is gonna win.

979
00:54:58,994 --> 00:55:01,563
And vote for Khloe my love
as well!

980
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:03,432
Simp!

981
00:55:03,565 --> 00:55:07,670
Your audacity is hilarious!

982
00:55:08,938 --> 00:55:10,373
Let him be, Naih.

983
00:55:10,507 --> 00:55:12,175
Let him believe
that he can have his dream.

984
00:55:14,643 --> 00:55:15,210
Um...

985
00:55:18,248 --> 00:55:18,882
Naih,

986
00:55:19,815 --> 00:55:21,318
thank you
for being my date tonight.

987
00:55:22,217 --> 00:55:23,152
Thank you as well, Lee.

988
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:26,789
You made another dream of mine
come true...

989
00:55:27,389 --> 00:55:28,657
to be your date at the ball.

990
00:55:29,759 --> 00:55:30,693
And because of that,

991
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:32,961
I'll let Lorde have his dream.

992
00:55:41,905 --> 00:55:42,771
[Lee] Let's vote for him.

993
00:55:44,139 --> 00:55:45,641
Fine, I'll vote for Lorde!

994
00:55:46,576 --> 00:55:47,177
-[playful music playing]
-I'm so cute tonight. Look!

995
00:55:47,309 --> 00:55:48,244
I dressed up for this--

996
00:55:48,378 --> 00:55:49,713
Lorde! Lorde? Hello!

997
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:50,547
Say hi! You wanna say hi?

998
00:55:50,679 --> 00:55:51,815
Send some Lechon,
beautiful people!

999
00:55:51,947 --> 00:55:54,117
If I win here,
I'm gonna make it rain!

1000
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:55,518
Don't forget:

1001
00:55:55,652 --> 00:55:58,121
Lorde for Benison Homecoming
Ball King, Kumunizens!

1002
00:55:58,253 --> 00:55:59,889
-Let's go!
-Okay, Mr. Energy!

1003
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:03,193
I want everyone to comment
#GoLordeFightAndWin!

1004
00:56:03,326 --> 00:56:04,126
Hoo--

1005
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:04,994
You didn't say it with me!

1006
00:56:05,128 --> 00:56:06,429
-Hoo-hah!
-Everyone, join him!

1007
00:56:06,563 --> 00:56:08,465
-He's got it!
-[laughter]

1008
00:56:09,632 --> 00:56:11,266
-Hi, Kumu!
-Hi, guys!

1009
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:13,369
Yeah, let's go!

1010
00:56:13,969 --> 00:56:15,804
Michiko! You okay?

1011
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:18,574
I got a text.

1012
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:19,976
It says, "Meet me outside."

1013
00:56:20,110 --> 00:56:21,744
Huh? Who's it from?

1014
00:56:22,978 --> 00:56:24,012
Unknown number.

1015
00:56:24,146 --> 00:56:25,280
Maybe it's a scammer.

1016
00:56:25,981 --> 00:56:26,849
[Migz] OMG!

1017
00:56:26,983 --> 00:56:27,851
Maybe it's...

1018
00:56:28,784 --> 00:56:29,853
Tob!

1019
00:56:29,985 --> 00:56:31,887
Stop me! Oh my God!

1020
00:56:33,722 --> 00:56:37,025
OMG!
From ghosting to zombie-ing!

1021
00:56:37,893 --> 00:56:39,128
Need support?

1022
00:56:39,596 --> 00:56:40,829
If you need backup,
I can go with you!

1023
00:56:40,963 --> 00:56:42,398
I miss Master Tob.

1024
00:56:43,365 --> 00:56:45,034
It's fine, guys. I got this.

1025
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:48,838
Wow! Ghost fighter!

1026
00:56:48,972 --> 00:56:51,641
Strong, independent woman!

1027
00:56:53,041 --> 00:56:56,445
Go Michiko!

1028
00:56:56,579 --> 00:56:58,081
-We love you!
-You can do it!

1029
00:56:58,213 --> 00:57:00,115
[inhales, exhales deeply]

1030
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:00,817
Tob,

1031
00:57:01,885 --> 00:57:02,719
it's okay.

1032
00:57:03,385 --> 00:57:04,686
I read your email.

1033
00:57:05,355 --> 00:57:06,456
I understand...

1034
00:57:08,291 --> 00:57:10,393
But I wish
you said it in person.

1035
00:57:11,795 --> 00:57:12,494
[sighs]

1036
00:57:16,766 --> 00:57:20,103
[Michiko]
I'm here. Where are you?

1037
00:57:21,905 --> 00:57:22,472
[man] Michiko.

1038
00:57:24,173 --> 00:57:24,740
Tob?

1039
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:31,014
[sighs]

1040
00:57:32,849 --> 00:57:33,550
Nurse M?

1041
00:57:34,217 --> 00:57:35,418
What are you doing here?

1042
00:57:36,251 --> 00:57:37,387
You left this at church.

1043
00:57:38,855 --> 00:57:42,592
[Nurse M] You left in a hurry,
so I couldn't give it to you.

1044
00:57:43,659 --> 00:57:44,994
Dale gave this to me.

1045
00:57:46,663 --> 00:57:48,063
I thought I lost it.

1046
00:57:49,965 --> 00:57:51,400
[Michiko]
Thanks for giving it back.

1047
00:57:53,101 --> 00:57:53,836
Thanks...

1048
00:57:54,971 --> 00:57:56,539
for all your help with Dale,
too.

1049
00:57:57,239 --> 00:57:57,907
Don't worry about it.

1050
00:57:58,740 --> 00:58:00,210
It's my duty as a nurse.

1051
00:58:00,777 --> 00:58:03,780
Yeah, but you were
a friend to him, too.

1052
00:58:05,248 --> 00:58:06,916
Thank you
for being Dale's friend.

1053
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:11,753
Thank you for being our friend.

1054
00:58:13,655 --> 00:58:14,657
Thank you as well.

1055
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:22,197
Now that we're friends,
I'd like to know...

1056
00:58:22,699 --> 00:58:23,699
What does M stand for?

1057
00:58:25,235 --> 00:58:25,835
Miguel.

1058
00:58:27,135 --> 00:58:27,936
Miguel Rizal.

1059
00:58:33,208 --> 00:58:34,443
Props to you Mace!

1060
00:58:35,177 --> 00:58:36,813
This party's rocking!

1061
00:58:37,213 --> 00:58:37,947
Thank you.

1062
00:58:38,081 --> 00:58:39,215
Congrats, Mace!

1063
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:41,117
You did a really great job
organizing this homecoming.

1064
00:58:42,385 --> 00:58:43,452
And congrats to Maxim

1065
00:58:43,585 --> 00:58:45,521
for finally taking Macy
to the ball!

1066
00:58:46,021 --> 00:58:46,856
[chuckling]

1067
00:58:46,989 --> 00:58:47,923
Well, thank you.

1068
00:58:48,690 --> 00:58:51,693
Yes, you took Macy
to the ball 25 years ago,

1069
00:58:52,394 --> 00:58:54,864
but she left the ball with me.

1070
00:58:54,998 --> 00:58:56,164
[chuckling]

1071
00:58:56,298 --> 00:58:58,668
That's because 25 years ago,

1072
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:00,802
I gave way to who I thought
was the better man, Maxim.

1073
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:02,704
I hate being wrong, so...

1074
00:59:03,405 --> 00:59:04,507
be better, Maxim.

1075
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:05,173
I will.

1076
00:59:06,175 --> 00:59:07,777
But not to prove you right.

1077
00:59:08,244 --> 00:59:08,744
[Maxim] But...

1078
00:59:09,211 --> 00:59:11,648
because I love my daughters

1079
00:59:12,447 --> 00:59:14,617
and I'm obsessed with my wife.

1080
00:59:15,451 --> 00:59:16,184
Boom!

1081
00:59:16,318 --> 00:59:18,153
-Mic drop!
-Oh stop!

1082
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:23,326
That's so Benison '97
and so 25 years ago.

1083
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:25,929
You're both grown-ups now.

1084
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:29,498
Quit the pissing contest!
Shake hands and make up!

1085
00:59:29,632 --> 00:59:30,833
[playful music playing]

1086
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:34,971
[scoffs]

1087
00:59:35,103 --> 00:59:39,742
Admit it, you miss
being the best of friends.

1088
00:59:40,009 --> 00:59:41,177
[both] You were best friends?

1089
00:59:42,010 --> 00:59:47,951
Yes, darlings. Dad
and Uncle JP were best friends.

1090
00:59:59,394 --> 00:59:59,996
Ah.

1091
01:00:00,128 --> 01:00:01,931
[chuckles]

1092
01:00:03,298 --> 01:00:04,266
[both] Eh.

1093
01:00:06,034 --> 01:00:06,668
[Macy] Boys...

1094
01:00:07,235 --> 01:00:08,170
Come here!

1095
01:00:13,009 --> 01:00:14,811
I know that look on your face,
Max.

1096
01:00:15,777 --> 01:00:18,213
You're probably thinking
Deib and Randall

1097
01:00:18,347 --> 01:00:19,648
can be best friends, too.

1098
01:00:20,315 --> 01:00:21,985
When pigs fly!

1099
01:00:23,318 --> 01:00:25,922
But in 25 years, who knows?

1100
01:00:27,356 --> 01:00:29,192
[Mr. Mancol over PA] Last call
for your time capsule entries,

1101
01:00:29,324 --> 01:00:30,092
Batch 2022!

1102
01:00:30,226 --> 01:00:31,360
Michiko,
where's your time capsule entry?

1103
01:00:32,260 --> 01:00:33,795
Here. Take my picture!

1104
01:00:34,262 --> 01:00:35,030
Sure.

1105
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:40,268
1, 2, 3. Smile!

[polaroid clicks]

1107
01:00:41,371 --> 01:00:42,237
-[Ysay] Nice!
-Okay.

1108
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:46,342
Is that what you're putting in?

1109
01:00:46,476 --> 01:00:47,076
Mhmm.

1110
01:00:51,114 --> 01:00:53,583
-[hopeful music playing]
-[Michiko] Dear 2047 Michiko,

1111
01:00:54,650 --> 01:00:59,856
I hope that when you see this
picture again, you're happy.

1112
01:01:01,123 --> 01:01:02,724
As happy as the day of the ball

1113
01:01:02,858 --> 01:01:05,327
when you realized
that you could do it.

1114
01:01:05,460 --> 01:01:06,228
You did it.

1115
01:01:08,030 --> 01:01:11,434
[Michiko] You failed,
but you eventually graduated.

1116
01:01:14,570 --> 01:01:17,139
You found new and true friends.

1117
01:01:20,143 --> 01:01:24,347
You got swept up your feet,
fell in love,

1118
01:01:25,847 --> 01:01:28,083
then got your heart crushed
when that love left.

1119
01:01:30,887 --> 01:01:32,755
But someone
came back into your life.

1120
01:01:35,190 --> 01:01:36,059
Dale.

1121
01:01:38,728 --> 01:01:41,230
And he taught you
to trust again.

1122
01:01:43,498 --> 01:01:46,436
The two of you proved
that forever is possible.

1123
01:01:48,204 --> 01:01:49,172
He loved you.

1124
01:01:50,239 --> 01:01:51,340
You loved him.

1125
01:01:52,541 --> 01:01:54,876
Because of Dale's love,

1126
01:01:55,010 --> 01:01:57,179
you learned
how to love yourself again.

1127
01:01:58,815 --> 01:02:03,318
But love left again.
You were hurt again.

1128
01:02:04,887 --> 01:02:08,291
But all that pain
made you stronger.

1129
01:02:09,257 --> 01:02:10,226
Made you whole.

1130
01:02:10,893 --> 01:02:12,594
And it prepared you
for everything

1131
01:02:12,728 --> 01:02:13,929
that life has in store for you.

1132
01:02:14,963 --> 01:02:17,199
Love yourself, Michiko.

1133
01:02:21,570 --> 01:02:26,742
"I love you, Michiko 2022."

1134
01:02:27,309 --> 01:02:28,311
Aww!

1135
01:02:29,244 --> 01:02:34,851
Ysay 2022
is so proud of Michiko 2022!

1136
01:02:36,018 --> 01:02:40,289
I hope Ysay 2047
would still be proud of me.

1137
01:02:40,422 --> 01:02:42,557
Of course, silly!

1138
01:02:42,958 --> 01:02:44,559
Look at this. You look so cute!

1139
01:02:44,693 --> 01:02:45,327
[laughter]

1140
01:02:45,728 --> 01:02:46,829
Let's go!

1141
01:02:46,963 --> 01:02:49,398
Let's put our entries
in the time capsule!

1142
01:02:49,532 --> 01:02:50,500
Let's go!

1143
01:02:50,632 --> 01:02:51,300
Okay.

1144
01:02:51,567 --> 01:02:52,201
Let's go!

1145
01:02:56,105 --> 01:02:59,141
[sentimental music playing]

1146
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:06,114
[Deib] I promise

1147
01:03:06,916 --> 01:03:08,483
to always be your best friend

1148
01:03:09,952 --> 01:03:11,987
through good times
and bad times.

1149
01:03:13,523 --> 01:03:17,393
I promise to try to be
a better person everyday...

1150
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:20,163
so I can be
the best version of myself

1151
01:03:20,295 --> 01:03:22,063
because
you truly deserve the best.

1152
01:03:23,699 --> 01:03:24,500
[Max] Deib changed...

1153
01:03:25,568 --> 01:03:26,702
and continues to change.

1154
01:03:27,702 --> 01:03:30,273
His transformation is evidence
of the power of kindness

1155
01:03:30,405 --> 01:03:31,007
and friendship.

1156
01:03:31,139 --> 01:03:33,509
If we just open our hearts,

1157
01:03:34,943 --> 01:03:36,878
we can actually
learn from each other

1158
01:03:37,512 --> 01:03:39,481
and help each other
become better people.

1159
01:03:41,284 --> 01:03:42,451
Even though you piss me off,

1160
01:03:43,652 --> 01:03:45,420
even though you don't trust me,

1161
01:03:47,056 --> 01:03:48,590
even though you hurt me,

1162
01:03:50,492 --> 01:03:51,427
I love you.

1163
01:03:52,228 --> 01:03:53,461
[Max] When you love someone,

1164
01:03:54,664 --> 01:03:57,266
you'll always look
for what's worth loving in them.

1165
01:03:58,467 --> 01:04:01,570
And I always find something
worth loving about your son.

1166
01:04:03,539 --> 01:04:05,041
You make my life better.

1167
01:04:06,275 --> 01:04:08,244
You made me believe in hope,
Deib.

1168
01:04:09,311 --> 01:04:11,581
You made me believe
that kindness

1169
01:04:11,713 --> 01:04:13,516
can turn an enemy
into a friend.

1170
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:16,351
[Max]
You made me believe in miracles.

1171
01:04:16,786 --> 01:04:17,954
And what we have...

1172
01:04:21,257 --> 01:04:22,657
What we have is a miracle.

1173
01:04:23,925 --> 01:04:25,293
[Evita] Things will get better.

1174
01:04:26,929 --> 01:04:28,331
Life will get better.

1175
01:04:29,664 --> 01:04:30,867
[Evita] You will get better.

1176
01:04:31,467 --> 01:04:33,735
[Evita] Don't be afraid
that you might hurt her, son.

1177
01:04:34,570 --> 01:04:38,074
You know, her love might just be
what you need right now

1178
01:04:38,206 --> 01:04:39,507
to get through this.

1179
01:04:40,208 --> 01:04:41,476
[Evita] Be brave, baby.

1180
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:47,115
Get back together with Max.
I know you want to.

1181
01:04:48,117 --> 01:04:49,485
[Dale] You deserve to be happy.

1182
01:04:51,820 --> 01:04:52,454
[Dale] Love you, bro.

1183
01:04:53,054 --> 01:04:54,422
[Deib]
I love you so much, big bro.

1184
01:04:59,527 --> 01:05:00,128
[man] Bro...

1185
01:05:10,972 --> 01:05:11,474
[Kim] Hi!

1186
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:14,510
What are you both doing here?

1187
01:05:14,643 --> 01:05:17,579
Well, you're stranded
and we've come to save you.

1188
01:05:19,481 --> 01:05:20,382
I'm not stranded.

1189
01:05:20,983 --> 01:05:22,117
[Kim] Not physically, no.

1190
01:05:22,684 --> 01:05:23,251
Emotionally.

1191
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:26,722
[RJ] I'm not here for you.

1192
01:05:27,989 --> 01:05:30,192
I'm here for my best friend Max.

1193
01:05:31,626 --> 01:05:33,396
[RJ] I know you're
going through a hard time...

1194
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:36,498
but Max would be happy
if you come to the ball.

1195
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:39,601
And you can forget all those
problems for just one night.

1196
01:05:41,036 --> 01:05:46,409
You'll be happy
to see Max happy.

1197
01:05:47,576 --> 01:05:49,110
[RJ] And she'll be happy
because you're there.

1198
01:05:50,646 --> 01:05:54,250
Yeah, Max doesn't deserve
this version of you.

1199
01:05:56,184 --> 01:06:00,356
But she loves you,
even at your worst.

1200
01:06:01,389 --> 01:06:02,692
[cathartic music playing]

1201
01:06:04,226 --> 01:06:05,460
That's how Max loves, right?

1202
01:06:10,065 --> 01:06:11,266
She won't give up on you.

1203
01:06:15,670 --> 01:06:19,375
We both know Max
is willing to wait for you,

1204
01:06:21,443 --> 01:06:25,047
but it might affect her future.

1205
01:06:26,715 --> 01:06:29,284
[RJ] She's thinking of declining
her scholarship in Japan

1206
01:06:31,554 --> 01:06:32,755
because she wants to make sure
you're okay first.

1207
01:06:34,956 --> 01:06:35,623
[RJ] She wants to be here

1208
01:06:36,692 --> 01:06:39,461
when you need her.

1209
01:06:40,362 --> 01:06:42,565
I never told Max to put her life
on hold for me.

1210
01:06:43,298 --> 01:06:44,599
Has she decided?

1211
01:06:47,202 --> 01:06:48,204
Looks like it.

1212
01:06:49,472 --> 01:06:50,773
Why didn't she tell me?

1213
01:06:52,307 --> 01:06:54,443
[RJ] She doesn't wanna add
to your burdens.

1214
01:06:56,112 --> 01:06:57,780
She's putting your needs first.

1215
01:06:59,949 --> 01:07:00,715
She can't do that.

1216
01:07:01,851 --> 01:07:02,650
She won't do that.

1217
01:07:03,786 --> 01:07:04,686
I'm gonna talk to her.

1218
01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:05,653
I'm going to the ball.

1219
01:07:05,788 --> 01:07:07,722
Just like that?!
You're going to the ball?!

1220
01:07:08,824 --> 01:07:10,358
[RJ] That was easy.

1221
01:07:11,092 --> 01:07:12,927
Wracked my brain for ways
to convince you.

1222
01:07:13,061 --> 01:07:14,764
Even psyched myself up
for a fist fight.

1223
01:07:15,864 --> 01:07:18,534
Actually, I came
to the same realizations...

1224
01:07:19,367 --> 01:07:21,103
before you guys arrived.

1225
01:07:22,637 --> 01:07:24,739
I was already
about to call Max...

1226
01:07:24,873 --> 01:07:27,143
and ask her
if I could take her to the ball.

1227
01:07:28,010 --> 01:07:29,445
So, I'm gonna go--

1228
01:07:29,577 --> 01:07:30,311
Wait, no!

1229
01:07:31,414 --> 01:07:33,849
You have to go to the ball
and seem like

1230
01:07:33,983 --> 01:07:36,418
you actually
wanna be there with Max.

1231
01:07:37,853 --> 01:07:39,355
I know Max is gonna love you

1232
01:07:39,487 --> 01:07:45,260
even though you look like
a dirty old rag, but come on!

1233
01:07:46,195 --> 01:07:47,730
Max deserves better than...

1234
01:07:48,230 --> 01:07:48,898
this.

1235
01:07:50,132 --> 01:07:50,699
Fine!

1236
01:07:51,867 --> 01:07:53,001
But Kim, I have no suit.

1237
01:07:53,135 --> 01:07:54,036
Yes, you do!

1238
01:07:54,969 --> 01:07:59,074
I prepared a suit,
just in case by some miracle

1239
01:07:59,208 --> 01:08:01,376
you decide
to go to the ball with me!

1240
01:08:03,945 --> 01:08:04,847
Good idea, right?

1241
01:08:07,315 --> 01:08:08,317
[Kim] What do you think?

1242
01:08:09,885 --> 01:08:12,521
After a closely contested fight,

1243
01:08:12,655 --> 01:08:16,826
the King and Queen
of the 2022 Benison Ball are...

1244
01:08:19,161 --> 01:08:21,596
Lorde Dawatap and Khloe Gomez!

1245
01:08:21,729 --> 01:08:22,664
[cheers, applause]

1246
01:08:22,797 --> 01:08:23,565
Yes!

1247
01:08:23,698 --> 01:08:24,966
-Is this for real?!
-[Naih] Rigged!

1248
01:08:25,100 --> 01:08:26,569
You bought the votes for sure!

1249
01:08:26,702 --> 01:08:28,604
[cheers, applause]

1250
01:08:43,219 --> 01:08:45,354
Thanks to everyone
who voted for me.

1251
01:08:45,488 --> 01:08:48,390
Not that I'm surprised...

1252
01:08:49,291 --> 01:08:51,327
[Lorde]
And for those who didn't...

1253
01:08:51,961 --> 01:08:53,194
Khloe is the ball queen,

Naih...

1257
01:09:01,302 --> 01:09:02,537
I'm sorry for everything.

[Lee]
I'd like us to start over again.

1259
01:09:06,809 --> 01:09:07,542
You sure?

1260
01:09:08,243 --> 01:09:09,744
We're so different.

1261
01:09:10,712 --> 01:09:11,380
I know.

1262
01:09:13,582 --> 01:09:14,449
But...

1263
01:09:17,118 --> 01:09:18,988
But maybe
we can find things in common

1264
01:09:19,488 --> 01:09:20,756
and figure it out together?

1265
01:09:22,091 --> 01:09:22,992

But I want a long courtship.

all sorts of obstacles
and challenges,

1290
01:10:45,873 --> 01:10:50,878

to greater heights

If I displayed bravery
this year,

1306
01:11:34,555 --> 01:11:36,759
it's because of the people
who helped me be brave.

1307
01:11:37,525 --> 01:11:38,527
And stay brave.

to the person
who gave me his whole heart,

1318

to the person
who made my life better,

I remember
telling him before that...

1320
01:12:32,113 --> 01:12:33,649
what we have is a miracle.

01:12:35,917 --> 01:12:37,920
And up to this day,
I believe that.
