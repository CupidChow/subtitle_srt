with a plan.

to do?

Wait, I have a super brilliant
idea!

212

What if we just invent an award
that the three of us could win?

213

some food.

I'm hungry anyway!

Uh... uhm...

218
00:14:11,616 --> 00:14:13,184
I was just thinking of, uh...

219
00:14:13,318 --> 00:14:15,453
of how I could use
Randall to my advantage,

220
00:14:15,587 --> 00:14:18,023
maybe taking him to the ball...

221
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:20,960
so I can get on
Max and Deib's nerves.

Are you sure?

223
00:14:24,929 --> 00:14:27,166
I think that will only work
if Max and Deib

224
00:14:27,298 --> 00:14:29,067
still have unresolved
feelings for you guys.

225
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:33,471
Or maybe you just want to ask
Randall to come to the ball

226
00:14:33,605 --> 00:14:35,173
because you think he's cute!

227
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:39,510
What?! Absolutely not!
He is not cute!

228
00:14:40,412 --> 00:14:42,114

What? How did that happen?

239
00:15:02,467 --> 00:15:05,537
This witness identified the
shooter.

240
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:08,240
He says it's your client,
Christopher Santos.

00:15:09,975 --> 00:15:11,644

do you recognize this man?

00:15:35,533 --> 00:15:37,836
That man was present when
Dale was shot.

Yeah, Dale was shot
by one of his companions.

365
00:21:02,259 --> 00:21:03,060
Don't forget...

366
00:21:05,029 --> 00:21:06,030
never forget...

367
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:11,036
that I love you, too,
with all my heart.

372
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:48,105

[Boyet] Hello!

Max!

378

Max, Tiago's turned on me!

He says I shot Dale!

-[Evita] the guy who shot
Dale...

It's Boyet!

385
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,067
Hello?

386
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,067
[Boyet] There's a warrant
for my arrest already!

387
00:22:16,201 --> 00:22:18,636
If I go to jail,
the syndicate will make sure

388
00:22:18,769 --> 00:22:20,238
I never get out alive!

389
00:22:21,605 --> 00:22:23,040
Max, hello?!

390
00:22:23,474 --> 00:22:23,974
[Boyet] Max?

391
00:22:24,108 --> 00:22:24,710
Hello?

392
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:31,682
That was my mom.

393
00:22:35,386 --> 00:22:36,688
She just said...

394
00:22:37,888 --> 00:22:40,224
Uncle Boyet was the one
who shot my brother.

395
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:44,195
Max,

396
00:22:45,262 --> 00:22:46,330
tell me that isn't true...

397
00:22:48,365 --> 00:22:49,300
Uncle Boyet...

398
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:54,338
Is he Christopher Santos?

399
00:22:58,509 --> 00:22:59,310
Yes...

You knew?!

404
00:23:22,099 --> 00:23:22,401
Deib...

405
00:23:23,634 --> 00:23:26,171
-I was gonna tell you--
-Max, you've known all this
time?!

406
00:23:27,271 --> 00:23:28,405
I was going to tell you...

407
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:30,409
-Max.
-I didn't know how...

408
00:23:30,541 --> 00:23:31,609
Max,

409
00:23:32,611 --> 00:23:33,711
answer me.

410
00:23:34,712 --> 00:23:35,946
You knew this whole time?!

411
00:23:36,647 --> 00:23:37,548
Deib--

412
00:23:37,682 --> 00:23:39,151
You've been hiding this from
me?!

413
00:23:40,719 --> 00:23:42,253
I wasn't hiding it,

414
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:44,256
I just didn't know how...

415
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:45,790
I couldn't...

416
00:23:46,657 --> 00:23:47,959
[Deib starts panting]

417
00:23:48,727 --> 00:23:50,494
Why didn't you tell me
that Uncle Boyet

418
00:23:50,628 --> 00:23:51,630
was the one who shot
my big brother?!

419
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:53,865
Shot your brother?!

420
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,602
Deib, Uncle Boyet is innocent!
He didn't--

421
00:23:57,736 --> 00:23:59,203
Deib, wait!

422
00:23:59,336 --> 00:24:00,806
Wait, Deib! Please!

423
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:03,141
Please, Deib! Please!

424
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:04,241
What?!

425
00:24:04,375 --> 00:24:05,376
Listen to me, Deib!

426
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:06,577
Please listen!

427
00:24:06,711 --> 00:24:07,345
To what?!

428
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,213
How you lied to me?!

429
00:24:10,582 --> 00:24:11,782
How you're still lying to me?!

430
00:24:11,916 --> 00:24:14,118
Deib, I'm not lying to you!

431
00:24:14,251 --> 00:24:16,387
Uncle Boyet is not a bad person,
Deib.

432
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,321
Deib!

433
00:24:17,823 --> 00:24:19,223
Deib, please!

434
00:24:19,356 --> 00:24:20,325
Max, he's a carnapper!

435
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:21,026
Deib!

436
00:24:21,593 --> 00:24:22,693
[thunder grows louder]

437
00:24:22,827 --> 00:24:24,229
He shot my brother!

438
00:24:24,362 --> 00:24:25,696
He didn't shoot Dale!

439
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:26,798
Please, Deib! Please!

440
00:24:26,932 --> 00:24:28,933
Stop lying to me, Max!

441
00:24:29,067 --> 00:24:29,634
Stop!

442
00:24:29,768 --> 00:24:30,969
-Stop!
-I'm not--

443
00:24:31,102 --> 00:24:32,636
-I'm not lying! I am telling the
truth!
-Are you?!

444
00:24:33,104 --> 00:24:34,573
When have I ever lied to you?!

445
00:24:34,705 --> 00:24:35,373
When?

446
00:24:36,273 --> 00:24:37,008
When?

447
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:38,143
Now!

448
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:39,877
Now!

449
00:24:40,444 --> 00:24:41,278
You're lying to me!

450
00:24:42,547 --> 00:24:43,515
And it breaks my heart

451
00:24:43,647 --> 00:24:44,849
that you would hide
the truth from me!

452
00:24:45,349 --> 00:24:46,084
Please

453
00:24:46,785 --> 00:24:47,919
believe me.

454
00:24:48,053 --> 00:24:48,752
Yes.

455
00:24:49,753 --> 00:24:50,788
It's true.

456
00:24:52,089 --> 00:24:54,425
Uncle Boyet was one of the men
who tried to steal your car.

457
00:24:55,059 --> 00:24:57,194
But he didn't shoot Dale!

458
00:24:57,528 --> 00:24:57,962
Please!

459
00:24:58,096 --> 00:24:59,498
He didn't shoot Dale!

460
00:24:59,631 --> 00:25:01,766
He couldn't hurt you!
He was afraid!

461
00:25:02,133 --> 00:25:03,567
He called an ambulance
to help you--

462
00:25:03,701 --> 00:25:05,537
Max, how are you so sure?!

463
00:25:05,903 --> 00:25:07,439
How are you so sure
he's telling the truth?!

464
00:25:07,571 --> 00:25:08,339
I just know!

465
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,773
I know because I know him!

466
00:25:09,907 --> 00:25:13,144
And I know you know that
he would never do that, Deib!

467
00:25:13,644 --> 00:25:14,511
I know you know.

470
00:25:16,981 --> 00:25:18,182
believe me.

471
00:25:18,316 --> 00:25:19,284
Please.

472
00:25:19,584 --> 00:25:20,417

475
00:25:23,654 --> 00:25:24,855
Please.

-[rain starts drizzling]
-Deib!

477
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:29,894
Deib, I love you so much.

478
00:25:30,528 --> 00:25:31,930
I love you so much.

479
00:25:32,797 --> 00:25:35,133
I could never lie to you.

480
00:25:35,634 --> 00:25:36,535
You would though.

481
00:25:37,769 --> 00:25:38,502
-You would.
-Deib!

482
00:25:39,804 --> 00:25:40,872
You would, Max.

483
00:25:41,006 --> 00:25:42,740
Why are you so sure?!

484
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:44,541
Because you protect
the people you love!

485
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:47,378
You protect the people you love.

486
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:49,513
That's how you love!

487
00:25:50,714 --> 00:25:52,217
That's how I love, too, Max!

488
00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:53,351
Deib...

489
00:25:53,817 --> 00:25:56,820
I'd do the same if I were
in your position!

490
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:59,089
I wasn't covering for him!

491
00:26:00,025 --> 00:26:03,193
I'm standing by him because
I know he's a good person!

492
00:26:03,327 --> 00:26:06,030
I believe him because I know
he's not a bad person!

493
00:26:06,163 --> 00:26:07,531
I know he'd never do that!

494
00:26:07,665 --> 00:26:09,166
Call it whatever you want!

495
00:26:09,567 --> 00:26:10,301
Okay?!

496
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:13,471
You're lying, you're not lying,
I don't care!

497
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:16,007
I get what you're going through!

498
00:26:17,107 --> 00:26:19,176
That doesn't lessen the pain,
okay?!

499
00:26:22,446 --> 00:26:23,548
It breaks my heart.

500
00:26:26,351 --> 00:26:29,287
And what hurts the most
is that we made a promise.

501
00:26:30,087 --> 00:26:31,455
We made a promise:

502
00:26:32,923 --> 00:26:33,924
no lies,

503
00:26:36,294 --> 00:26:37,295
no secrets.

504
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:42,067
But you broke that promise.

505
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,501
You broke that promise.

[Daniel] Answer me!

551
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:02,160
Yes, Dad.

552
00:31:06,564 --> 00:31:09,634
Did you tell her anything
about our investigation?

553
00:31:11,469 --> 00:31:12,170
No.

554
00:31:12,636 --> 00:31:13,704
No, Dad.

555
00:31:13,837 --> 00:31:14,638
[Daniel] Here's what I think:

556
00:31:16,607 --> 00:31:21,846
it's impossible that Max
hasn't known for a while

557
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:24,781
that her Uncle Boyet shot Dale.

558
00:31:25,549 --> 00:31:27,618
Is it possible
she's just using you, Deib?

559
00:31:29,153 --> 00:31:32,056
Maybe she's just
manipulating you so she can

560
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:35,727
alert her Uncle Boyet
and help him get away?

561
00:31:35,859 --> 00:31:37,894
[Daniel] Do you think
I could be right, Deib?!

562
00:31:39,096 --> 00:31:40,365
Answer me!

563
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:43,500
I don't know.

564
00:31:45,103 --> 00:31:46,136
Sorry, Dad.

567
00:31:58,449 --> 00:32:00,617
You were just trying
to protect them both.

568
00:32:01,184 --> 00:32:02,686
You didn't do anything bad.

569
00:32:03,621 --> 00:32:05,455
You didn't do anything wrong.

570
00:32:07,525 --> 00:32:08,259
Dad,

571
00:32:10,193 --> 00:32:12,797
I don't think I can face Deib.

572
00:32:14,231 --> 00:32:14,832
Why not?

573
00:32:16,867 --> 00:32:18,502
You're telling the truth.

574
00:32:19,903 --> 00:32:21,538
Don't be afraid.

575
00:32:22,406 --> 00:32:24,174
I can't face him

576
00:32:26,678 --> 00:32:29,180
because I can't bear to see him
hurt.

577
00:32:33,084 --> 00:32:35,752
And he's hurt because of me...

[Max] Where's your big brother?

582
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:19,963
I heard you didn't win the
championship last year

583
00:33:20,097 --> 00:33:22,266
because he got hospitalized.

584
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:23,567
Yeah.

585
00:33:25,236 --> 00:33:26,371
My brother is in the hospital.

586
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:28,405
He's in a coma.

00:33:33,144 --> 00:33:34,144
I hope whoever did it

590
00:33:34,278 --> 00:33:35,546
pays for what they did
to your brother.

591
00:33:41,586 --> 00:33:44,388
[Max] What happened to your
big brother wasn't your fault.

592
00:33:45,423 --> 00:33:48,492
It's the carnapper's fault,
not yours.

593
00:33:49,426 --> 00:33:51,028
[Max] You're not a bad person,
Deib.

594
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:01,605
[Deib] I didn't find whoever
did this to my brother...

595
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,442
but I found you.

596
00:34:05,742 --> 00:34:07,612
And you make my life better.

597
00:34:08,746 --> 00:34:12,817
[Deib] I just can't help
but feel responsible.

598
00:34:13,784 --> 00:34:19,623
I would only be able
to forgive myself

599
00:34:19,757 --> 00:34:22,092
if we find the person
who shot my brother.

600
00:34:22,793 --> 00:34:24,762
What if that person is never
found?

601
00:34:25,963 --> 00:34:26,797
[Deib] No lies,

602
00:34:28,032 --> 00:34:29,400
no secrets.

603
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:31,536
No lies,

604
00:34:32,969 --> 00:34:33,905

609
00:35:23,387 --> 00:35:25,922
Max said Uncle Boyet is
innocent.

610
00:35:28,826 --> 00:35:30,862
She said he didn't shoot Dale.

611
00:35:35,432 --> 00:35:38,568
Mom, I don't know who to
believe.

613
00:35:41,038 --> 00:35:41,873
Deib...

614
00:35:44,541 --> 00:35:46,710
I understand, son.

615
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,750
But there is evidence against
Boyet.

616
00:35:55,786 --> 00:36:00,257
Attorney said the syndicate

617
00:36:00,391 --> 00:36:03,527
could be arranging Boyet's
escape...

618
00:36:10,101 --> 00:36:16,072
Max told me her mom was a
member of a gang in Mindoro.

619
00:36:17,974 --> 00:36:21,778
But Uncle Maxim
said that Uncle Boyet

620
00:36:21,913 --> 00:36:24,614
is one of the kindest people
he's ever known...

621
00:36:25,483 --> 00:36:27,585
He's the kindest and not like
that.

622
00:36:28,318 --> 00:36:33,023
Maybe he didn't know that Boyet
was a member of the syndicate.

623
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:35,760
Because if he did,

624
00:36:35,893 --> 00:36:39,096
he would've made
Boyet stay away from Max.

625
00:36:41,831 --> 00:36:45,936
Deib, we didn't know that the
person we've been looking for

626
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:48,539
was right in front of us all
along.

627
00:36:50,141 --> 00:36:51,576
I don't know what to feel.

628
00:36:54,711 --> 00:36:56,213
I don't know what to do.

629
00:36:59,916 --> 00:37:02,152
It's hard for me, too, Deib.

630
00:37:03,987 --> 00:37:08,059
I still can't believe that
Boyet shot your brother...

631
00:37:08,192 --> 00:37:10,094
No, Mom... No...

632
00:37:11,596 --> 00:37:13,764
And just like you, baby, I...

633
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:17,534
I feel betrayed by Max.

634
00:37:18,835 --> 00:37:21,038
Because she didn't tell you the
truth.

635
00:37:22,706 --> 00:37:25,108
And she knew what you
were going through...

636

00:39:49,219 --> 00:39:52,322
I think Max and her uncle
are telling the truth.

667
00:39:53,824 --> 00:39:57,762
I saw Uncle Boyet with one
of the suspects before.

668
00:39:58,728 --> 00:40:00,831
He lied and said
he didn't know the guy.

669
00:40:02,166 --> 00:40:04,568
Max should've told Deib
the truth immediately,

670
00:40:04,702 --> 00:40:06,137
so things wouldn't get
this complicated.

671
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:10,740
But speaking from experience,

672
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:12,543
I think Max just got scared,

673
00:40:12,675 --> 00:40:13,777
so she couldn't say
anything immediately.

674
00:40:14,277 --> 00:40:16,614
And of course,
she wanted to protect her uncle.

675
00:40:16,746 --> 00:40:18,949

00:42:13,664 --> 00:42:14,632
â™ª I will love you â™ª

726
00:42:14,764 --> 00:42:21,105
â™ª Even though, even if, even
though â™ª

727
00:42:22,172 --> 00:42:28,545
â™ª Our love for each other
Will get us through â™ª

728
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:31,981
â™ª You and me together â™ª

729
00:42:32,115 --> 00:42:34,818
â™ª What matters now
Is we have each other â™ª

730
00:42:34,952 --> 00:42:40,456
â™ª Any burden is light with us
two â™ª

731
00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:45,161
â™ª So I'll be here for you â™ª

732
00:42:45,295 --> 00:42:48,398
â™ª I'll be beside you Â´til the
end â™ª

733
00:42:48,532 --> 00:42:54,871
â™ª We can wipe our tears â™ª

734
00:42:55,005 --> 00:43:01,744
â™ª Whatever happens
In the coming years â™ª

735
00:43:01,878 --> 00:43:06,583
â™ª Even though, even if, even
though â™ª

736
00:43:06,717 --> 00:43:07,751
So you don't believe her?

737
00:43:07,885 --> 00:43:09,085
[Deib] I don't know what
to believe anymore.

738
00:43:09,219 --> 00:43:11,855
All I know is I wanna find
the person who hurt you.

739
00:43:11,989 --> 00:43:12,989
[Dale] What if that's Uncle
Boyet?

740
00:43:13,123 --> 00:43:14,824
How did you guys become friends?

741
00:43:14,958 --> 00:43:15,726
She got a crush on me.

742
00:43:15,858 --> 00:43:17,695
[Michiko] You got a crush on me!

743
00:43:17,827 --> 00:43:18,728
[Lee] Am I boring you?

744
00:43:18,862 --> 00:43:19,929
Mine, what do you want?

745
00:43:20,063 --> 00:43:21,197
When I speak, I'm wrong.

746
00:43:21,331 --> 00:43:22,865
When I don't speak, I'm still
wrong.

747
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,601
Deib and Max
are not on good terms

748
00:43:24,735 --> 00:43:27,871
and we finally have a chance
to get them back.

749
00:43:28,005 --> 00:43:29,773
Thanks for being one of

750
00:43:29,907 --> 00:43:32,009
the only things in my life
that never changed.

751
00:43:33,876 --> 00:43:35,045
[Deib] Why do you keep
going to him?!

752
00:43:35,179 --> 00:43:36,579
He's your ex! I'm your
boyfriend!

753
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:37,581
Are we still together?
