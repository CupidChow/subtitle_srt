1
00:00:01,701 --> 00:00:04,104
[Deib] Your ex seemed to enjoy
dancing with you!

2
00:00:04,237 --> 00:00:05,270
Did you guys kiss?

3
00:00:05,405 --> 00:00:06,639
I deserve the truth, Max.

4
00:00:06,772 --> 00:00:08,073
And I deserve your trust!

5
00:00:08,208 --> 00:00:09,175
If that's what you think,

6
00:00:09,308 --> 00:00:10,577
then you never
trusted me at all!

7
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:13,545
We found the private
investigator that Deib hired.

8
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,716
We also found out
that he's in this hospital.

9
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:17,783
[Evita] This is my patient!

10
00:00:17,917 --> 00:00:20,286
-What room?
-What are we standing here for?

11
00:00:20,652 --> 00:00:21,888
[Evita]
He died of cardiac arrest.

12
00:00:23,088 --> 00:00:25,524
[monitor flatlining]

13
00:00:25,992 --> 00:00:27,594
Max, I was part of the gang

14
00:00:27,727 --> 00:00:29,396
that attempted to carnap
Deib and Dale's car.

15
00:00:36,936 --> 00:00:38,237
Max, I was part of the gang

16
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:40,439
that attempted to carnap
Deib and Dale's car.

17
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:42,442
[Bhaves] What?!

18
00:00:49,082 --> 00:00:50,817
[stutters] What?

19
00:00:53,051 --> 00:00:54,253
Max, I'm sorry.

20
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:57,856
[Bhaves]
Why did you need to carnap?

21
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:01,226
Mom, do you remember when...

22
00:01:02,128 --> 00:01:03,595
Max had dengue?

23
00:01:04,664 --> 00:01:07,634
We didn't have money
to pay the hospital.

24
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,469
The doctor said...

25
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:13,972
he wouldn't help Max

26
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:19,646
until we paid the 75,000
we already owed the hospital.

27
00:01:21,346 --> 00:01:23,415
[Boyet sniffles]
I tried getting a loan,

28
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:25,617
but nobody wanted
to lend me money.

29
00:01:26,152 --> 00:01:30,689
That's why I went
to my friend Tiago.

30
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:34,760
He said he knew
a good side hustle.

31
00:01:35,795 --> 00:01:40,700
I'd get the money
even before doing the job.

32
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:46,206
But I had to do a
carnapping job with them.

33
00:01:47,373 --> 00:01:50,843
[Bhaves] That's how
your sister's old gang worked!

34
00:01:51,343 --> 00:01:54,614
She got in trouble--
I can't do this, Boyet!

35
00:01:54,746 --> 00:01:57,983
Why would you...
Did you join them?!

36
00:02:00,552 --> 00:02:01,620
No, Mom.

37
00:02:01,987 --> 00:02:04,090
I didn't join the Siko Gang.

38
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:07,927
It was just that one job
to pay for Max's bills.

39
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:10,497
Uncle Boyet.

40
00:02:12,598 --> 00:02:15,467
Kid, sorry,
I know it was wrong, but...

41
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:19,838
I feel like such a hypocrite
for always saying that...

42
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,311
I'd rather die in debt
than live off stolen money,

43
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:29,248
but it was your life
on the line.

44
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,519
I couldn't live with myself
if something happened to you.

45
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:34,920
But...

46
00:02:36,788 --> 00:02:38,358
on the night of the carnapping,

47
00:02:39,192 --> 00:02:40,659
the gang could tell
my conscience was eating me up,

48
00:02:40,793 --> 00:02:45,198
so they had me be the lookout
along with Tiago.

49
00:02:45,998 --> 00:02:47,834
When it was just me
and Tiago in the car,

50
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:50,736
I told him
I really couldn't do it.

51
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:53,939
I was about to leave,
but he stopped me.

52
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:55,942
He told me...

53
00:02:58,144 --> 00:02:59,378
to think about you

54
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:05,350
and the money I got from them
to pay your hospital bills.

55
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:07,854
But I still left.

56
00:03:09,021 --> 00:03:11,657
Then when I got out of the car,
I heard a gunshot.

57
00:03:12,491 --> 00:03:13,492
I went there

58
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,596
and saw Bok and Ute
running away.

59
00:03:18,097 --> 00:03:21,366
Deib's brother was already
lying on the side of the car.

60
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:26,506
The gang left in a hurry
and I was left alone.

61
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:29,943
I immediately called
for an ambulance

62
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:33,712
to help Deib's brother,

63
00:03:35,314 --> 00:03:36,515
then I got scared.

64
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:40,687
I was afraid of going to prison
and leaving you guys.

65
00:03:42,487 --> 00:03:44,324
So I left after calling
the ambulance.

66
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,330
I regret everything
that happened that night, Max.

67
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:52,899
Especially now that...

68
00:03:53,432 --> 00:03:56,235
I know our victim
was Deib's brother.

69
00:03:56,936 --> 00:04:00,639
I used to tell myself
I would never be like my sister,

70
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,543
but I still became a criminal.

71
00:04:04,843 --> 00:04:06,312
[Randy]
You're not a criminal, Boyet.

72
00:04:06,712 --> 00:04:08,580
You didn't shoot Dale.

73
00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:10,582
Even so.

74
00:04:11,283 --> 00:04:13,019
Sorry... Sorry...

75
00:04:13,385 --> 00:04:15,020
I hope you can forgive me.

76
00:04:17,689 --> 00:04:19,559
-[Bhaves sighs]
-[phone rings]

77
00:04:23,428 --> 00:04:24,831
[stuttering] Deib is...

78
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:28,334
Deib is calling...

79
00:04:28,767 --> 00:04:30,970
Max, please don't tell Deib.

80
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:32,504
Not yet.

81
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,874
I'll make sure first
that it's safe for Boyet

82
00:04:35,007 --> 00:04:37,276
to give his witness testimony
to the police.

83
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:39,711
We need to ensure
Boyet's safety first.

84
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,148
Do you understand?

85
00:04:42,581 --> 00:04:45,050
-[phone continues ringing]
-[tense music playing]

86
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:54,961

playing]

87
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:51,951
[song ends]

88
00:05:54,586 --> 00:05:56,355
[melancholic music playing]

89
00:05:56,488 --> 00:05:57,889
[Deib] Max, call me back ASAP.

90
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,959
I have bad news
about Dale's case.

91
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:01,226
Agila's dead.

92
00:06:03,829 --> 00:06:05,997
And we still don't have
the CCTV footage.

93
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:12,904
Sh*t! I should have made him
send me the video immediately

94
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:14,240
when he got it.

95
00:06:18,577 --> 00:06:20,713
Or met up with him.

96
00:06:20,846 --> 00:06:22,382
Then we'd have the evidence
right now

97
00:06:22,514 --> 00:06:24,716
to send Dale's shooter
to prison.

98
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:30,589
I hate myself so much right now

99
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:33,860
for putting that party
at The Barb first. Argh!

100
00:06:37,829 --> 00:06:40,098
Anyway,
I won't go to school today.

101
00:06:40,899 --> 00:06:43,201
The lawyers want to talk to me
and go over the case again.

102
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,819
Sorry, my first text to you
is bad news.

103
00:07:04,857 --> 00:07:07,192
Good morning, MOO. I love you.

104
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:21,540
[melancholic music continues]

105
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:24,944
[Max] Sorry, Deib.

106
00:07:26,245 --> 00:07:28,648
I couldn't answer your calls
last night.

107
00:07:30,048 --> 00:07:33,052
I stayed up all night thinking
about how to talk to you.

108
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,555
I couldn't sleep.

109
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:40,326
I felt like puking every time
I thought about what happened.

110
00:07:43,028 --> 00:07:43,963
Sorry, Deib.

111
00:07:44,596 --> 00:07:46,098
I just found out last night.

112
00:07:47,132 --> 00:07:49,634
Uncle Boyet admitted
he's one of the carnappers

113
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:51,303
the night your brother
got shot...

114
00:07:58,511 --> 00:07:59,478
[Deib] Let's go!

115
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,480
You don't have serious damage.

116
00:08:01,613 --> 00:08:02,982
Please, I'm in a hurry!
How much?

117
00:08:03,682 --> 00:08:06,218
- Seriously? How much?
-[phone rings]

118
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:07,920
What?!

119
00:08:08,053 --> 00:08:09,855
Wait, I'm on my way.
Stay there!

120
00:08:10,622 --> 00:08:12,190
Bro, you have a new visitor.

121
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:13,625
This is Max.

122
00:08:14,226 --> 00:08:16,696
She's the girl who's been
making me really happy.

123
00:08:17,295 --> 00:08:18,396
Hi, Dale.

124
00:08:18,997 --> 00:08:20,333
[Deib] When we first met,

125
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:22,000
I was in a hurry, because...

126
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:23,668
I got a tip

127
00:08:23,802 --> 00:08:25,036
that my big brother's shooter
had been found.

128
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:28,608
But because we got
into that accident...

129
00:08:29,274 --> 00:08:30,175
Sorry.

130
00:08:31,343 --> 00:08:32,611
If I only knew...

131
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:34,947
Max, you always tell me

132
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:39,384
that what happened with Dale
wasn't my fault.

133
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:42,788
But Mom always hinted that...

134
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:46,392
it was my fault.

135
00:08:47,092 --> 00:08:49,294
[Max] You have
to forgive yourself .

136
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:51,129
Deib...

137
00:08:52,264 --> 00:08:53,533
It's not your fault.

138
00:08:53,765 --> 00:08:55,735
I promise

139
00:08:56,101 --> 00:09:00,172
I won't hide anything from you.

140
00:09:00,572 --> 00:09:01,740
No lies,

141
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:03,909
no secrets.

142
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:07,879
[Max] No lies, no secrets.

143
00:09:09,514 --> 00:09:10,783
[sighs]

144
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:15,254
[melancholic music continues]

145
00:09:21,226 --> 00:09:23,296
[Max] Sorry for not answering
last night, Deib.

146
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:25,798
Slept early.

147
00:09:26,465 --> 00:09:27,866
I'm not feeling well.

148
00:09:28,533 --> 00:09:29,835
I'll be absent today, too.

149
00:09:37,509 --> 00:09:38,811

Hello, Deib?

153
00:09:58,464 --> 00:09:59,298
MOO!

154
00:10:00,231 --> 00:10:01,200
Good morning!

155
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:03,201
Still not feeling well?

156
00:10:03,735 --> 00:10:05,937
I can send you food or drinks...

157
00:10:06,438 --> 00:10:07,405
It's okay.

158
00:10:08,673 --> 00:10:09,942
Don't worry.

159
00:10:11,009 --> 00:10:13,712
Probably just a headache
because of dysmenorrhea.

160
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,749
Just tell me how I can help.

161
00:10:17,316 --> 00:10:19,250
Any cravings,

162
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:21,153
maybe scented candles,

163
00:10:21,854 --> 00:10:23,221
or extra napkin...

164
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:26,258
Thank you.

165
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:29,894
I'm getting better. Don't worry.

166
00:10:30,028 --> 00:10:31,831
I already took some medicine.

167
00:10:32,331 --> 00:10:33,865
You sure, MOO?

168
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:36,268
Yeah.

169
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:38,004
Okay.

170
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,572
Just text or call me anytime.

171
00:10:41,173 --> 00:10:43,842
I'm just a call or text away.

172
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:46,144
Okay.

173
00:10:46,711 --> 00:10:49,148
Alright, MOO.
You should get some rest.

174
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:51,716
Catch you later.

175
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:52,817
Bye!

176
00:10:52,951 --> 00:10:54,086
Deib, wait!

177
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:55,921
Yeah?

178
00:10:57,956 --> 00:10:59,125
I love you!

179
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:02,995
I love you so much.

180
00:11:05,063 --> 00:11:06,831
Don't forget that, okay?

181
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:09,835
I love you!

182
00:11:12,538 --> 00:11:14,005
I love you so much, MOO.

183
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:17,009
Bye.

184
00:11:19,778 --> 00:11:20,879
[exhales]

185
00:11:22,847 --> 00:11:24,082
[Randy] How well do you know

186
00:11:24,216 --> 00:11:25,750
the people you carnapped with,
Boyet?

187
00:11:26,451 --> 00:11:30,990
I just met Ute and Bok
that night.

188
00:11:31,756 --> 00:11:33,525
Tiago and I go way back.

189
00:11:33,658 --> 00:11:35,226
He's from Mindoro, too.

190
00:11:36,595 --> 00:11:39,298
[Randy] Does anybody else know
about your carnapping plans?

191
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:42,467
No, it's just us...

192
00:11:43,501 --> 00:11:44,503
and Boss.

193
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:46,871
The CCTV video's gone.

194
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:48,506
Apparently,

195
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,476
they make it a point to erase
footage every few months,

196
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:53,511
which makes sense, but...

197
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:57,015
But it's confirmed:
Agila sent someone

198
00:11:57,149 --> 00:12:00,452
to get a copy of the CCTV
footage of Dale's shooting.

199
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:03,188
Deib, think.

200
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:07,927
What did Agila say to you
about this CCTV footage?

201
00:12:09,195 --> 00:12:10,830
[Agila] There's CCTV

202
00:12:10,962 --> 00:12:14,399
where the suspects parked
the getaway vehicle.

203
00:12:14,866 --> 00:12:16,802
We may be able
to see their faces.

204
00:12:17,035 --> 00:12:18,336
Okay, please update me.

205
00:12:18,703 --> 00:12:22,240
[phone ringing]

206
00:12:26,611 --> 00:12:28,681
-[cheering]
-[phone ringing]

207
00:12:28,813 --> 00:12:30,349
-I'll just take this call.
-Okay.

208
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:32,150
[Agila] Hello?  Hello, sir!

209
00:12:32,283 --> 00:12:34,886
- Sir, I got the CCTV footage!
- Alright.

210
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:36,989
Just send it to me.
It's too loud in here.

211
00:12:37,755 --> 00:12:39,158
- I'll watch it later.
- [distant cheering continues]

212
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:40,558
Okay, bye.

213
00:12:41,192 --> 00:12:43,062
[Deib] The night of the
Interhigh championship,

214
00:12:43,729 --> 00:12:44,730
he called me,

215
00:12:45,029 --> 00:12:45,998
but I had to end the call

216
00:12:46,131 --> 00:12:47,500
because we couldn't hear
each other.

217
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:50,602
I told him to just send me
the video. Had I known that--

218
00:12:50,735 --> 00:12:53,739
If this Agila was calling you,
then of course, it's important.

219
00:12:54,105 --> 00:12:55,274
You shouldn't have
disregarded that call.

220
00:12:55,407 --> 00:12:56,975
You should have asked
to meet with him right away

221
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:58,409
to get that video.

222
00:12:58,543 --> 00:12:59,577
Daniel,

223
00:13:00,145 --> 00:13:02,914
Deib was busy celebrating
his win that night.

224
00:13:03,048 --> 00:13:04,182
He couldn't have known

225
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:06,784
that Agila would get run over
that night.

226
00:13:07,285 --> 00:13:09,889
And it's a good thing
they didn't meet up.

227
00:13:10,022 --> 00:13:13,259
If they did, your son would've
also been in danger.

228
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:14,927
I'm sorry, Dad.

229
00:13:15,727 --> 00:13:16,595
Baby.

230
00:13:17,562 --> 00:13:20,166
Are there any other witnesses,
Attorney?

231
00:13:20,298 --> 00:13:23,134
Yes, our investigators are
trying to find other witnesses.

232
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:26,004
They talked
to the CCTV technicians...

233
00:13:26,337 --> 00:13:28,640
Can't the CCTV technicians

234
00:13:28,774 --> 00:13:32,043
and Agila's associate testify
about what they saw?

235
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:34,947
Yes, but the best they can do

236
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,448
is describe the faces
of the suspects.

237
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,083
The police can sketch them,

238
00:13:39,217 --> 00:13:41,787
but it's not going to be an
exact rendition of their faces.

239
00:13:42,254 --> 00:13:46,491
Our best and most reliable
witness is the CCTV.

240
00:13:47,025 --> 00:13:49,094
[Randy]
If Boyet went to the police

241
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:51,897
or Deib's family as
a witness to the crime,

242
00:13:52,697 --> 00:13:56,067
he needs to be able
to identify who shot Dale.

243
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,770
That's the problem.

244
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:02,374
I'm not sure whether it was
Ute or Bok who shot Dale.

245
00:14:03,841 --> 00:14:05,043
Randy,

246
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:08,447
if we went to the police,

247
00:14:08,846 --> 00:14:11,015
would they charge me
with carnapping?

248
00:14:11,149 --> 00:14:13,619
[Randy] The carnapping fell
through,

249
00:14:13,918 --> 00:14:15,486
so they can't charge you
with it.

250
00:14:16,187 --> 00:14:18,323
The only crime that took place

251
00:14:18,456 --> 00:14:20,826
was the serious physical injury
of Dale.

252
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:25,397
Depending on the fiscal,
it can be attempted homicide...

253
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:29,201
or murder.

254
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:31,236
[tense music playing]

255
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,370
[Daniel]
It's been several months

256
00:14:32,504 --> 00:14:34,807
since my son Dale
was almost killed.

257
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:38,344
Here's an idea: why don't we
set up a cash reward

258
00:14:38,476 --> 00:14:41,480
for whoever has information that
can lead us to find this killer?

259
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:43,315
That would speed things up,
wouldn't it, Attorney?

260
00:14:43,448 --> 00:14:45,350
-Yes, it would, but...
-Well?

261
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:48,687
I'm afraid what happened
to Agila was a hit.

262
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:51,256
If the Boss of the syndicate
ordered it,

263
00:14:51,389 --> 00:14:54,826
what's to stop him from doing it
also to our other witnesses

264
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,028
even before we can get
any testimony?

265
00:14:59,965 --> 00:15:02,668
Randy, I'm worried
about everyone's safety,

266
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:05,037
including Deib's family.

267
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:09,240
Tiago said
Boss has men everywhere.

268
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:10,643
Even the police.

269
00:15:11,277 --> 00:15:13,345
We can't trust anyone.

270
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:24,756
[door opens]

271
00:15:45,076 --> 00:15:46,177
Dad...

272
00:15:47,011 --> 00:15:48,179
Dad, don't worry,
we'll find the--

273
00:15:48,313 --> 00:15:52,717
That night Agila was supposed
to send you the CCTV video,

274
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:55,921
didn't you worry when you
didn't hear from him?

275
00:15:56,054 --> 00:15:57,255
I did.

276
00:15:58,356 --> 00:16:01,427
I called him immediately,
but he didn't answer.

277
00:16:02,794 --> 00:16:03,961
Then what did you do?

278
00:16:04,429 --> 00:16:05,563
I called him again.

279
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:08,267
And again. But I got nothing.

280
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,034
So I gathered all my information

281
00:16:10,168 --> 00:16:12,270
and turned it over
to the attorney.

282
00:16:12,403 --> 00:16:16,207
I even gave the suspect's name:
Christopher Santos.

283
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:18,143
And that was it?

284
00:16:20,645 --> 00:16:23,349
I promised Mom I wouldn't get
involved in the case anymore.

285
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:26,784
Don't kid yourself, Deib.

286
00:16:27,885 --> 00:16:31,322
Whatever you do or don't do,
you're involved in this case.

287
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:35,094
Ever since you were little boys,

288
00:16:36,327 --> 00:16:39,465
your big brother Dale has
always watched out for you

289
00:16:39,731 --> 00:16:40,698
and protected you.

290
00:16:40,832 --> 00:16:44,202
Whenever you got in trouble
and you needed him,

291
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:46,471
he was always ready to help you.

292
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:48,706
And...

293
00:16:49,841 --> 00:16:51,844
And that's why he was
with you that night...

294
00:16:52,811 --> 00:16:53,912
the night he got shot.

295
00:17:00,385 --> 00:17:01,452
I'm sorry...

296
00:17:05,223 --> 00:17:06,825
Now it's your turn, Deib.

297
00:17:08,126 --> 00:17:10,128
Now your big brother needs you.

298
00:17:10,561 --> 00:17:11,930
Because of this trauma,

299
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,932
his life is not going
to be the same.

300
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:17,502
You do realize that,
don't you, Deib?

301
00:17:19,738 --> 00:17:20,705
So you--

302
00:17:21,105 --> 00:17:24,108
we must do all we can

303
00:17:24,675 --> 00:17:27,980
to make sure he gets justice
for everything he's lost.

304
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:31,250
Can you understand that, Deib?

305
00:17:34,118 --> 00:17:35,220
Yes, Dad.

306
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,388
I understand.

307
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:41,759
-[Bhaves groans]
-Get some rest, Grams...

308
00:17:43,327 --> 00:17:45,564
Slowly.

309
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:49,867
Max, I can't stop worrying

310
00:17:50,368 --> 00:17:52,304
about your Uncle Boyet.

311
00:17:53,505 --> 00:17:57,843
I hope Deib's family understands

312
00:17:58,544 --> 00:18:02,548
why your uncle couldn't tell
the truth immediately.

313
00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:06,652
[phone chimes]

314
00:18:11,522 --> 00:18:12,758
[Deib] How are you, Max?

315
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:14,759
How do you feel?

316
00:18:17,962 --> 00:18:19,263
Hang on, Grams.

317
00:18:29,307 --> 00:18:35,380
[sad music playing]

318
00:18:57,102 --> 00:18:59,403
[exhales sharply]

319
00:19:17,288 --> 00:19:20,526
[sad music swelling]

320
00:19:50,888 --> 00:19:52,723
Nice! Good shot!

321
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:53,991
Layup!

322
00:19:56,728 --> 00:19:57,628
Come on!

323
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:01,599
Mhmm! Fun, huh?

324
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:03,801
Stress relief!

325
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:21,987
Thanks, RJ.

326
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:26,991
I know...

327
00:20:28,926 --> 00:20:30,429
I know I hurt you

328
00:20:31,696 --> 00:20:33,131
and you still hate me.

329
00:20:37,868 --> 00:20:40,605
All that went away when
I saw you crying last night.

330
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:46,044
No matter how much I tell myself
to stop loving you,

331
00:20:47,112 --> 00:20:48,680
that I don't wanna be friends
with you,

332
00:20:50,949 --> 00:20:52,517
we've gone through
so much together

333
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:53,884
and I can't just
throw it all away.

334
00:20:56,555 --> 00:20:57,990
You're my friend, Max.

335
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:01,826
Best friend.

336
00:21:03,628 --> 00:21:05,696
Thanks for still being
my best friend.

337
00:21:12,436 --> 00:21:15,874
[monitor beeping]

338
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:17,108
Thanks.

339
00:21:17,675 --> 00:21:19,678
-I'll take it from here.
-Alright.

340
00:21:31,355 --> 00:21:33,959
[Deib] "Did the Warriors lose?
Why the long face?"

341
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:35,727
[chuckles lightly]

342
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:40,832
It's nothing, bro. Sorry.

343
00:21:42,099 --> 00:21:43,868
Just bumps in the case.

344
00:21:45,936 --> 00:21:48,406
But promise, we'll find
the person who shot you.

345
00:21:48,539 --> 00:21:49,641
Okay?

346
00:22:04,556 --> 00:22:05,891
I'm so sorry, bro.

347
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:10,494
If I didn't get wasted
that night,

348
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:12,730
you wouldn't be here.

349
00:22:13,932 --> 00:22:16,634
We'd be playing basketball now.
You'd be outside...

350
00:22:17,301 --> 00:22:18,202
happy.

351
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:23,240
You'd hang with your teammates,

352
00:22:25,143 --> 00:22:26,744
go on road trips with me,

353
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:32,116
or be the boyfriend
of the girl you wanted to court.

354
00:22:34,819 --> 00:22:36,520
I'm sorry I ruined your life.

355
00:22:46,097 --> 00:22:46,964
[Dale sniffles]

I feel like my "Dear Babu"
emails to you

362
00:23:33,711 --> 00:23:35,614
wouldn't be comforting enough
for this situation.

[sighs]

364
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:41,086
I owe you a lot, RJ,

365
00:23:42,887 --> 00:23:44,890
especially for opening your home

366
00:23:45,022 --> 00:23:47,592
to Grams and Uncle Boyet
here in Manila.

367
00:23:47,992 --> 00:23:48,926
No, Max.

368
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,096
I have much to make up for.

369
00:23:53,664 --> 00:23:55,666
I regret...

00:23:56,701 --> 00:23:57,635
not being there when
you were in the hospital

372
00:24:00,771 --> 00:24:02,039
I should've been there for you,

00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:07,878
even just through email,
text, or call.

374
00:24:11,615 --> 00:24:12,917
What if you didn't survive?

375
00:24:14,251 --> 00:24:16,821
I wouldn't have been able
to forgive myself, Max.

[bittersweet music playing]

377

Sorry.

378

Sorry for what I said
that night, too.

is your first boyfriend?

No.

You count!

00:24:38,742 --> 00:24:39,845
You were my first love...

You're my first boyfriend.

384
00:24:44,615 --> 00:24:46,317
I just meant that

385
00:24:47,219 --> 00:24:49,587
it's my first time

386
00:24:49,721 --> 00:24:51,923
having a boyfriend
I can be with everyday.

387
00:24:53,525 --> 00:24:55,125
Deib and I are always together.

388
00:24:56,795 --> 00:24:59,064
It was different for you and me.

389
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:02,433
We were so far away.

390
00:25:05,871 --> 00:25:08,973
I didn't get the full experience
of a relationship.

[exhales deeply] Sorry, RJ.

392
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:19,884
I'm really sorry.

393
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:28,425
RJ, I love Deib...

394

I know, Max.

395
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:33,131
I'm not asking for anything
in return.

396
00:25:34,332 --> 00:25:36,367
I'm not asking
to get back together.

397
00:25:37,935 --> 00:25:39,770
I just wanna be
your friend again.

398
00:25:40,672 --> 00:25:42,807
I wanna be there for you
when you're having a hard time.

399
00:25:43,741 --> 00:25:45,442
It hurts that you don't
love me anymore,

400
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:49,180
but it would hurt more
if you're not in my life.

401
00:26:01,593 --> 00:26:04,762
You think Deib would understand
this situation with Uncle Boyet?

402
00:26:06,865 --> 00:26:08,199
If he loves you,

403
00:26:09,334 --> 00:26:10,402
he would understand.

I'm Tochiko's number one fan,

Have you moved on?

[Naih live-selling

433
00:27:20,105 --> 00:27:22,539
How do you know
if you've moved on, Lorde?

434
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,275
How do you even move on?

435
00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:25,777
Why are you asking me?

436
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:28,212
Let's ask Ysay,
the "moving on expert"!

437
00:27:28,346 --> 00:27:29,681
-Ysay!
-Yeah?

438
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:31,449
How did you move on from Hunter?

439
00:27:34,118 --> 00:27:35,220
We were never officially
together.

440
00:27:35,353 --> 00:27:36,755
-[Elle] Really?
-[Migz] True!

When Hunter moved
abroad with his dad,

442
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:43,028
we knew we wouldn't survive LDR.

443
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:46,830
So we ended things
before anything became real.

444
00:27:46,964 --> 00:27:48,400
-That's it?!
-Yeah!

445
00:27:48,532 --> 00:27:49,467
It's that easy?!

446
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,238
It's easier to move on...

447

when there's nothing
to start with.

448
00:27:57,275 --> 00:27:58,410
Ooh.

449
00:27:58,977 --> 00:28:03,013
But I heard the fastest way
to move on is...

450
00:28:04,115 --> 00:28:05,583
find someone new!

451
00:28:05,717 --> 00:28:07,451
-Is that so?
-Really?

Khloe's livestreams.

I won't move on from Khloe.

to do all that.

534
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:36,453
Don't blame yourself.

535
00:32:37,821 --> 00:32:38,823
It's my fault.

536
00:32:40,157 --> 00:32:42,226
If I'd been more responsible,

537
00:32:42,359 --> 00:32:44,295
I would've had money ready

538
00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:46,297
for when you needed to go
to the hospital.

539
00:32:47,765 --> 00:32:49,099
If I had a decent job,

540
00:32:49,232 --> 00:32:51,602
I would've been able
to give you a better life.

541
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:54,739
I'm sorry.

542
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:58,476
Sorry for all my flaws.

543
00:33:01,511 --> 00:33:04,816
Because of what I did,
you and Deib will be affected.

544
00:33:06,017 --> 00:33:07,218
I'm really sorry, kid.

545
00:33:09,753 --> 00:33:10,654
Uncle.

546
00:33:12,222 --> 00:33:16,326
Thank you for everything you did
to take care of me and raise me.

547
00:33:17,595 --> 00:33:19,329
I love you very much, Uncle.

548
00:33:20,298 --> 00:33:21,898
I love you very much, kid.

549
00:33:22,165 --> 00:33:25,403
[poignant music swelling]

550
00:33:36,913 --> 00:33:38,548
Thanks for bringing me home, RJ.

551
00:33:39,217 --> 00:33:40,951
And for comforting me.

552
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,921
I got no one to talk to
about this.

553
00:33:45,256 --> 00:33:46,324
No problem.

554
00:33:47,557 --> 00:33:49,594
I won't get tired
of being your friend.

555
00:33:50,994 --> 00:33:51,962
But, Max,

556
00:33:52,596 --> 00:33:54,298
I'm just worried
about your safety.

557
00:33:55,365 --> 00:33:57,434
Maybe you should tell
Uncle Maxim about this?

558
00:33:57,934 --> 00:33:59,269
If Dad finds out,

559
00:33:59,703 --> 00:34:02,105
he'll surround me
with bodyguards.

560
00:34:02,539 --> 00:34:04,107
Remember when my head got hit?

561
00:34:04,241 --> 00:34:05,710
He got bodyguards
for Elle and me.

562
00:34:05,843 --> 00:34:10,614
I don't know how to explain
that to people.

563
00:34:11,248 --> 00:34:12,949
I don't want to have
to lie to Deib.

564
00:34:14,818 --> 00:34:19,757
I hope your boyfriend
understands you...

565
00:34:20,925 --> 00:34:22,326
and doesn't explode.

566
00:34:23,193 --> 00:34:24,996
He might think you're lying.

567
00:34:25,362 --> 00:34:27,565
I'll tell him, RJ.

568
00:34:27,998 --> 00:34:29,300
Just not now.

569
00:34:30,534 --> 00:34:33,637
I have to consider
Uncle Boyet's safety.

570
00:34:42,512 --> 00:34:43,981
I thought
you weren't feeling well?!

571
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:46,751
You went out with Echavez?!

572
00:34:47,351 --> 00:34:49,920
Deib, we didn't go out.

573
00:34:50,521 --> 00:34:52,090
[RJ] Bro, chill out.

574
00:34:52,222 --> 00:34:53,291
Don't tell me to chill.

575
00:34:53,423 --> 00:34:54,692
I'm not talking to you.

576
00:34:55,059 --> 00:34:56,327
Deib, can you please calm down?

577
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:57,561
I'm calm, Max.

578
00:34:58,161 --> 00:35:01,331
But very confused why you're
with Echavez yet again.

579
00:35:02,199 --> 00:35:04,735
And on a day you told me
that you're not feeling well.

580
00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:07,038
Grandma Bhaves also
wasn't feeling well,

581
00:35:07,505 --> 00:35:09,172
so Max visited her.

582
00:35:09,306 --> 00:35:10,373
Is that true, Max?

583
00:35:12,043 --> 00:35:12,943
You should have told me.

584
00:35:13,744 --> 00:35:15,179
I would've brought you there

585
00:35:15,512 --> 00:35:16,880
if you just told me.

586
00:35:17,215 --> 00:35:19,851
Oh! Boys, you're all here.

587
00:35:20,117 --> 00:35:21,518
-Hi, Dad!
-Sir!

588
00:35:22,385 --> 00:35:23,588
Good afternoon, sir.

589
00:35:23,721 --> 00:35:25,856
Well, boys, why don't you both
join us for dinner?

590
00:35:26,724 --> 00:35:27,625
Uh...

591
00:35:28,759 --> 00:35:31,329
I'll pass, sir.
I need to go home.

592
00:35:31,461 --> 00:35:34,197
Oh. Okay. Sure.
Next time, RJ!

593
00:35:34,565 --> 00:35:35,666
How about you, Deib?

594
00:35:37,068 --> 00:35:38,603
Yeah, I'll join you, sir.

595
00:35:39,369 --> 00:35:41,105
Good! I'll see you inside.

596
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:42,606
Okay, sir.

597
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:45,076
-I'll go now.
-Okay.

598
00:35:45,208 --> 00:35:46,677
Thanks. Take care!

599
00:35:47,878 --> 00:35:48,579
[car door shuts]

[utensils clanking]

601
00:36:04,427 --> 00:36:06,063
Are you two okay?

602
00:36:07,864 --> 00:36:08,798
Yeah.

603
00:36:08,932 --> 00:36:10,101
Yeah. We're okay, sir.

604
00:36:11,536 --> 00:36:13,871
You both look stressed out.

605
00:36:17,608 --> 00:36:19,643
I'm just worried about
my brother's case, sir.

606
00:36:22,445 --> 00:36:24,081
Our lawyer said a while ago

607
00:36:25,483 --> 00:36:28,052
that a carnapping syndicate
could be involved.

608
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:30,887
They're also suspected
to have ambushed

609
00:36:31,021 --> 00:36:33,090
the private investigator
working on the case.

610
00:36:35,458 --> 00:36:38,728
Apparently,
the crime scene was a hotspot

611
00:36:39,563 --> 00:36:41,998
for carnapping by the
Siko-Siko Syndicate.

612
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:45,835
[Maxim] Siko-Siko?
Sounds familiar.

613
00:36:46,637 --> 00:36:48,306
Yeah, now I remember.

614
00:36:49,005 --> 00:36:53,177
When I was assigned in Mindoro,
I only heard about Siko Gang.

615
00:36:53,744 --> 00:36:55,846
It's a gang
of wet market snatchers

616
00:36:55,980 --> 00:37:00,016
where Max's mom, Heart,
was a member.

617
00:37:00,818 --> 00:37:04,588
But Heart got out
when we became friends.

618
00:37:06,923 --> 00:37:09,860
Could it be the same gang, sir?

619
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:12,496
[Maxim] That I don't know, Deib.

620
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:16,032
If anybody knew

621
00:37:16,166 --> 00:37:20,438
how Siko Gang evolved
to Siko-Siko Syndicate,

622
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:22,139
it would be Boyet.

623
00:37:23,273 --> 00:37:26,811
[tense music playing]

624
00:37:26,943 --> 00:37:27,945
Uncle Boyet?

625
00:37:29,646 --> 00:37:33,416
Is it possible he's a member
of the Siko-Siko Syndicate?

626
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:35,619
[Maxim] No, no.

627
00:37:36,052 --> 00:37:37,255
That's impossible.

628
00:37:37,722 --> 00:37:40,590
Boyet's the kindest person
I met in Mindoro,

629
00:37:40,724 --> 00:37:42,592
even when he was young.

630
00:37:42,726 --> 00:37:45,329
In fact, Max's mom
stole my wallet.

631
00:37:45,695 --> 00:37:47,998
It was Boyet
who gave me back my wallet.

632
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:49,800
Honestly, Deib,

633
00:37:50,635 --> 00:37:52,536
if Boyet were a bad person,

634
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:54,304
he would've taken advantage
of my being a Luna.

635
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:55,639
He could've bled me dry

636
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:57,907
by asking me to repay him
for raising my daughter.

637
00:37:58,275 --> 00:38:00,945
But Boyet isn't like that.

638
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:05,215
He's a man of integrity
and honesty.

Mhmm.

so you can forgive.

If that's the case,

Did he hurt you?

710

No.

711
00:42:45,429 --> 00:42:47,097
I hurt him.

712
00:42:47,463 --> 00:42:49,166
I didn't mean to...

718

I don't have my S-pen with me.
Can I borrow yours?

[chuckles softly] Max, S-pen...

721
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:28,505
S-pen.

722
00:43:31,976 --> 00:43:33,077
You okay?

723
00:43:34,711 --> 00:43:35,878
Are you okay?

724
00:43:37,815 --> 00:43:38,882
You wanna talk?

725
00:43:40,650 --> 00:43:41,985
I'm okay, Elle.

726
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:46,456
[softly] Okay.

728
00:43:53,963 --> 00:43:56,000
Bro, good morning!

729
00:43:56,132 --> 00:43:57,967
[Michiko] Good morning, Deib.
Good morning, Lorde.

730
00:43:58,101 --> 00:44:00,603
Good morning, guys.

731
00:44:00,737 --> 00:44:02,271
I'll leave you guys alone, okay?

732
00:44:10,614 --> 00:44:11,648
Good morning!

733
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:14,451
Hope you feel better!

734
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:19,456
Hope you're okay now.

735
00:44:21,425 --> 00:44:22,358
Did you miss me?

736
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:24,894
I missed you.

737
00:44:31,635 --> 00:44:32,536
Okay...

738
00:44:34,070 --> 00:44:35,972
So, about what you wanted
to tell me...

739
00:44:37,041 --> 00:44:38,275
you wanna tell me now...

740
00:44:39,409 --> 00:44:40,177
or later?

00:44:42,478 --> 00:44:43,347
After school?

743
00:44:45,181 --> 00:44:46,650
Okay, after school.

744
00:44:46,784 --> 00:44:48,818
But I have after-school service,

745
00:44:48,952 --> 00:44:51,320
so I might be late
going to The Barb.

Come, let's run away.

You said
you're not sick anymore.

I'm not sick, Deib.
Let's run away. Now!

755
00:45:14,010 --> 00:45:15,512
Wait a sec, Max.
Are you serious?

756
00:45:15,646 --> 00:45:16,447
You want to cut class?

I can handle it now.

00:46:42,932 --> 00:46:45,101
Yeah, Dale was shot
by one of his companions.

785

Do you recognize this man?
