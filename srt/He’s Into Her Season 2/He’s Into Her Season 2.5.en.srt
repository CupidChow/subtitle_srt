1
00:00:01,266 --> 00:00:02,569
[RJ] Because you chose Enrile,

2
00:00:02,702 --> 00:00:03,903
I don't count anymore?

3
00:00:04,036 --> 00:00:05,605
You said
you don't want to be friends!

4
00:00:05,738 --> 00:00:06,972
Because I still love you!

5
00:00:07,107 --> 00:00:09,509
I broke your heart?
You're still breaking mine.

6
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:10,910
That's why I hate you.

7
00:00:11,044 --> 00:00:13,179
It's nice to have someone
who takes what I say seriously

8
00:00:13,313 --> 00:00:14,480
and doesn't turn everything
into a joke.

9
00:00:14,747 --> 00:00:15,881
[Naih] You're annoying.

10
00:00:16,015 --> 00:00:18,251
You sided with Ysay
instead of me.

11
00:00:18,385 --> 00:00:19,919
I'm your girlfriend!

12
00:00:20,652 --> 00:00:23,690
When are you paying
your 75K debt?

13
00:00:24,089 --> 00:00:27,160
I can lend you the money
if you need it.

14
00:00:28,228 --> 00:00:30,629
Now, I have the money with me.

15
00:00:31,797 --> 00:00:32,298
Hey!

16
00:00:32,564 --> 00:00:34,768
Snatcher!
Come back here!

17
00:00:34,901 --> 00:00:37,469
I don't believe that bullying
should be tolerated.

18
00:00:37,603 --> 00:00:40,906
Expulsion is the only
proper course of action.

19
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:42,207
[board member 1] I agree.

20
00:00:43,143 --> 00:00:44,143
[board member 2] So do I.

21
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:48,081
[board member 1]
I think expulsion

22
00:00:48,213 --> 00:00:50,616
is the only proper
course of action.

23
00:00:50,984 --> 00:00:51,784
[board member 2] I agree.

24
00:00:52,185 --> 00:00:53,253
[board member 3] So do I.

25
00:00:54,219 --> 00:00:56,121
[Headmaster]
I think the board is ready

26
00:00:56,256 --> 00:00:57,656
to decide on this matter...

27
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:02,328
[suspenseful music plays]

28
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:03,862
[Max] Excuse me, Headmaster.

29
00:01:09,835 --> 00:01:11,304
May I speak?

30
00:01:13,873 --> 00:01:15,207
Go ahead, Ms. Del Valle.

31
00:01:18,778 --> 00:01:20,180
Max, what are you doing?

32
00:01:23,081 --> 00:01:23,816
[sighs deeply]

33
00:01:25,451 --> 00:01:29,055
If Elle was expelled
for what she did,

34
00:01:29,855 --> 00:01:33,793
and Deib would be expelled
for what he did,

35
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:38,164
shouldn't I be expelled as well?

36
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:41,935
I reviewed
the student code of conduct.

37
00:01:42,067 --> 00:01:43,802
And I should be expelled too...

38
00:01:44,736 --> 00:01:46,539
because on my first day
in Benison,

39
00:01:46,673 --> 00:01:49,542
I committed
an act of violence against Deib.

40
00:01:49,843 --> 00:01:50,843
I punched him.

41
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:54,647
[Max] He did nothing to me
to merit that behavior.

42
00:01:55,581 --> 00:01:57,516
So shouldn't I be expelled too?

43
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:58,852
Max.

44
00:01:59,185 --> 00:02:01,287
I didn't like what Elle did.

45
00:02:02,021 --> 00:02:04,656
She wanted to scare me because
she resented me back then.

46
00:02:05,658 --> 00:02:07,293
But Aimee and Choco
were the only ones involved

47
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:08,661
in hitting me with a bat.

48
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:11,865
My sister didn't know
until much later...

49
00:02:11,997 --> 00:02:13,765
that Aimee and Choco hurt me.

50
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,968
They hid it from her.

51
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:18,805
She had no intention
of physically hurting me

52
00:02:19,771 --> 00:02:21,241
nor attacking me.

53
00:02:22,407 --> 00:02:24,711
That's why I don't think
Elle deserves the expulsion.

54
00:02:25,277 --> 00:02:26,812
[Max] What I'm saying is -

55
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:30,349
yes, there should be
consequences for Deib.

56
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:32,585
Even for Elle and me.

57
00:02:33,252 --> 00:02:35,687
[Max] There will be no true
forgiveness or correction...

58
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:38,056
if we just said sorry
and left it at that.

59
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:41,426
But let's not just look
at the bad things people do.

60
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:44,463
How about the things
they did to change

61
00:02:44,796 --> 00:02:47,667
and stop making
the same mistake?

62
00:02:48,367 --> 00:02:50,669
Ever since
our anti-bullying project,

63
00:02:50,802 --> 00:02:52,972
ever since
Deib's public apology,

64
00:02:53,105 --> 00:02:55,375
people here in Benison changed.

65
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:57,743
Bullying stopped.

66
00:02:57,877 --> 00:03:00,546
People have stopped
seeing bullying as cool.

67
00:03:01,213 --> 00:03:03,116
People
have stopped being afraid.

68
00:03:03,616 --> 00:03:05,151
The other day,
people weren't afraid

69
00:03:05,284 --> 00:03:08,187
to tell Deib
that they don't support him

70
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,955
because they were no longer
afraid of him.

71
00:03:10,088 --> 00:03:12,025
And he didn't get mad.

72
00:03:12,491 --> 00:03:15,562
He understood them
and respected their decision.

73
00:03:15,694 --> 00:03:18,764
If Deib continued bullying,

74
00:03:18,897 --> 00:03:21,334
I'll understand
why he needs to be expelled.

75
00:03:22,301 --> 00:03:23,635
But Deib changed...

76
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,104
and continues to change.

77
00:03:26,705 --> 00:03:29,209
I can say the same
for my sister Elle.

78
00:03:29,342 --> 00:03:32,512
I'd like to believe that I am
changing for the better, too.

79
00:03:33,145 --> 00:03:34,146
So please...

80
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:37,449
Please allow Deib and Elle
to stay here in school.

81
00:03:37,883 --> 00:03:40,687
Their transformation is evidence
of the power of kindness

82
00:03:40,819 --> 00:03:41,420
and friendship.

83
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:44,424
If we just open our hearts,

84
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:47,526
we can learn from each other

85
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:50,462
and help each other
become better people.

86
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:53,866
And isn't that
what school is all about?

second chance, okay?

101

Yes, Dad, I will.

00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:51,918
I'm excited for you to be back
in Benison! Come here!

Thank you, Maxpein.

Good job.

108

[Headmaster] Actually,
your defense of Deib and Elle

109
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:07,699
reminds me
of when Maxim defended me

110
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:10,370
many years ago
during my own student inquiry.

111
00:06:10,769 --> 00:06:12,872
You defended
the Headmaster before, Dad?

112
00:06:13,172 --> 00:06:13,872
Well,

113
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:16,242
it was the right thing to do.

114
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:18,745
And because
Macy asked you to do it.

115
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:20,379
Stop.

00:06:21,113 --> 00:06:24,550

I'll just talk to Deib.

but it was almost like

you were lying but not lying.

I wasn't lying.

It is true that Deib is kind.

134
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:16,536
And he deserves a chance
at redemption.

he doesn't disappoint you.

00:09:13,152 --> 00:09:14,653
he hasn't sent an update since--

180
00:09:14,787 --> 00:09:16,989
This Agila,

181
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:18,990
is he a licensed professional?

182
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:22,662
[Daniel] Come on, Deib!

183
00:09:23,328 --> 00:09:26,499
Are you stupid? You didn't
check his credentials?

184
00:09:26,631 --> 00:09:27,399
No...

185
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,769
I was...

186
00:09:33,172 --> 00:09:37,143
Hon, Deib was just
trying to help, okay?

187
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:39,946
This private investigator
of yours,

188
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:44,015
is he the reason why you've been
withdrawing so much money?

189
00:09:44,683 --> 00:09:47,219
[Daniel] The bank's been
flooding me with notifications!

190
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:49,455
Yes.

191
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:55,427
You paid that guy so much money!
You've been scammed, you fool!

192
00:09:56,461 --> 00:09:58,496
[Daniel] When was the last time
you heard from this person?

193
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:00,466
The night of the championship--

194
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:02,835
The night of the championship...

195
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:04,570
That was several weeks ago!

196
00:10:05,037 --> 00:10:06,538
[Daniel] And you just said

197
00:10:06,672 --> 00:10:09,508
he hasn't sent you
any recent update

198
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:11,309
from him.

199
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:12,745
And yet...

200
00:10:13,111 --> 00:10:18,049
you paid that conman
75K just this week?!

201
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:19,317
No, Dad.

202
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:21,486
That was for Uncle Boyet.

203
00:10:22,687 --> 00:10:24,190
Because...

204
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:27,559
They needed some help because
their house in Mindoro...

205
00:10:27,692 --> 00:10:28,494
got flooded.

206
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,162
So I needed to, you know...

207
00:10:31,529 --> 00:10:32,965
Wait.

208
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:36,501
Who's Boyet?

209
00:10:37,769 --> 00:10:39,004
Max's uncle.

210
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:41,573
Max's uncle?

211
00:10:42,073 --> 00:10:43,408
[Daniel] And he came to you?

212
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:45,344
Max's father, Maxim Luna,

213
00:10:45,477 --> 00:10:47,779
is one of the richest men
in the country!

214
00:10:47,913 --> 00:10:49,447
Why didn't Boyet
ask him for help?!

215
00:10:49,581 --> 00:10:52,618
I volunteered to lend him money.

216
00:10:52,918 --> 00:10:55,321
I just wanted to help.

217
00:10:56,187 --> 00:10:57,556
[Daniel]
You volunteered to help?!

218
00:10:57,889 --> 00:10:59,057
Well, Deib!

219
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:01,027
You're so naive!

220
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:05,030
First this fake PI
that has scammed you,

221
00:11:05,163 --> 00:11:10,135
now this Uncle Boyet will surely
take off with your money, too!

222
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:12,638
Dad,
Uncle Boyet isn't like that!

223
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:13,806
He wouldn't do that.

224
00:11:13,938 --> 00:11:15,541
How can you be so sure?!

225
00:11:15,673 --> 00:11:17,043
Because I trust Max!

226
00:11:17,909 --> 00:11:19,177
And Max wouldn't be
the person she is today

227
00:11:19,311 --> 00:11:22,414
if not for Uncle Boyet
who raised her!

228
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:25,017
[Deib] He's not like that, Dad.

229
00:11:25,784 --> 00:11:26,985
Not at all.

230
00:11:27,886 --> 00:11:28,653

-[suspenseful music begins]
-I don't know what to do, bro.

234
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,067
I have a debt with Boss,

235
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:44,336
now I owe the person
I took a loan from

236
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,038
to pay my debt with Boss.

237
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:47,972
Only one solution to that -

238
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,375
carnap again.

239
00:11:51,376 --> 00:11:54,080
But this time,
go through with it.

240
00:11:58,517 --> 00:11:59,350
Bro.

241
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,721
No! I can't do it anymore.

242
00:12:03,221 --> 00:12:06,991
Bro,
remember the man spying on us?

243
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:10,428
Turns out he's not a cop
but a private investigator.

244
00:12:11,096 --> 00:12:13,599
Likely hired
by the victim's family.

245
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:21,173
My God! What if
he's just around, spying on us?

246
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:26,044
Don't panic. We're fine.
Boss's men just texted.

247
00:12:26,177 --> 00:12:29,048
They took care of it.

248
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:33,619
What do you mean?

00:12:44,129 --> 00:12:47,966
He's gone. Dead.
Boss took him out.

252
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,102
I'm at The Barb, Max.

253
00:12:51,236 --> 00:12:53,339
Hi, MOO. Just checking on you.

254
00:12:53,739 --> 00:12:54,440
[Tiago] You better pray...

255
00:12:55,006 --> 00:12:59,110
the PI didn't get anything on us
and gave it to the family.

256
00:12:59,644 --> 00:13:04,482
Because if he did, Boss
will come after the family next.

257
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,952
[Deib] Mom got something
for you. Wait I'll get--

No, bro.
I can't go back to that.

You can't escape Boss.

What if we report him?

You'll drag me down with you!

take as long...

[cop] Here we have four.

309
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:25,224
We'll find who did this to Deib
sooner or later.

310
00:15:25,524 --> 00:15:27,826
Think the two cases
are connected?

No.

Based on their statements,
this seems personal.

Could one of them be Echavez?

No. RJ would never do this.

of such a thing.

from Southbay who hates Enrile.

357
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:45,530
Lots of Benison students...

358
00:17:45,663 --> 00:17:49,268
transferred to Southbay because
of your boyfriend's antics.

359
00:17:49,867 --> 00:17:51,970
What he did to you?

360
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:52,871
That's nothing compared...

361
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:54,940
to what he did
to his other victims.

362
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:58,576
Do you know how toxic
your boyfriend is?

363
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:00,913
Sorry.

364
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:03,015
I just thought--

365
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:04,482
What happened to your arm?

366
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:07,118
Let's get some first aid
upstairs.

367
00:18:07,251 --> 00:18:08,386
I'm fine.

368
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:11,890
Hey, Max, RJ!

369
00:18:12,523 --> 00:18:13,925
[Boyet] What are you doing here?

370
00:18:14,326 --> 00:18:19,064
Deib got beaten up earlier.
Thought the culprit was here.

371
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:20,398
Thankfully, he's not.

372
00:18:20,965 --> 00:18:24,135
Really, how's Deib? Is he okay?
Does he need backup?

373
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:27,506
He's okay now.
No need for backup.

374
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:29,942
By the way,
did you get the money, Uncle?

375
00:18:30,741 --> 00:18:34,980
Um, yes. I got it! I sent it
to our repairmen in Mindoro.

376
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,615
Your Aunt Melba
will oversee everything.

377
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:39,951
The sooner we can fix the house,
the better.

378
00:18:40,085 --> 00:18:41,519
And don't worry, Uncle.

379
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:44,957
RJ and I
found a way to pay Deib.

380
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:46,424
Really?

381
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:48,926
[Boyet] You shouldn't have...

382
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:50,362
but thanks, RJ.

383
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:53,132
My niece is lucky
to have you as her best friend.

384
00:18:53,664 --> 00:18:54,932
No problem, Uncle.

385
00:18:57,301 --> 00:18:58,403
This calls for a group hug!

386
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:00,739
[Boyet] Group hug!

387
00:19:01,205 --> 00:19:02,173
Group hug!

388
00:19:11,549 --> 00:19:14,419
[indistinct nervous chatter]

389
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:15,820
DEIB MADE OUR LIVES HELL!

390
00:19:23,761 --> 00:19:26,097
[Naih]
Stop me! I'm scared, Mine!

391
00:19:31,936 --> 00:19:35,039
-[Naih] Oh my God!
-[Lorde] Oh boy!

392
00:19:35,173 --> 00:19:35,907
The other students are worried

393
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,175
that there will be
more retaliation,

394
00:19:38,309 --> 00:19:39,778
not just against you, Deib,

395
00:19:40,144 --> 00:19:41,246
but on them as well.

396
00:19:41,712 --> 00:19:42,881
I will be calling
a student assembly later

397
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,982
to tell everyone
what I will be telling you now.

398
00:19:49,387 --> 00:19:50,255
What's this?

399
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:53,392
I spoke with the principal
of Southbay.

400
00:19:54,092 --> 00:19:56,595
He's not tolerating their
students' misconduct either.

401
00:19:57,461 --> 00:19:58,997
He got a confession...

402
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:00,999
from the students involved
in the vandalization of your car

403
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:02,267
and our school.

404
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:03,801
As punishment,

405
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:06,238
they will clean up the wall
they defaced.

406
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:07,905
Those are their names.

407
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,409
Echavez is not here...

408
00:20:11,175 --> 00:20:11,910
[Headmaster] They all to claim
to be victims

409
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,779
of your infamous
"Project: Blocked."

410
00:20:15,646 --> 00:20:16,748
For them, it's not enough
that you will just

411
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:19,183
do 40 hours of school service.

412
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:20,786
They want you expelled.

413
00:20:24,122 --> 00:20:26,057
Sorry for dragging the school
into all this.

414
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:28,160
Don't say sorry to me.

415
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:31,028
Apologize to those you bullied.

416
00:20:31,663 --> 00:20:33,265
But what if that's enough, sir?

417
00:20:34,398 --> 00:20:36,167
What if they don't forgive me?

418
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:39,070
Because
if I'm being really honest,

419
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:43,075
I still can't forgive myself
for what I did.

420
00:20:43,808 --> 00:20:45,143
Everything I did.

421
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:47,112
I know how you feel.

422
00:20:47,878 --> 00:20:50,414
And I will tell you
what your grandpa told me...

423
00:20:50,848 --> 00:20:52,817
when I was still studying here
in Benison.

424
00:20:53,518 --> 00:20:54,452
He said...

425
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:59,223
that the past cannot be changed,
forgotten, or edited.

426
00:20:59,924 --> 00:21:03,761
It just needs to be accepted,
as it is.

427
00:21:04,663 --> 00:21:05,931
He told me that...

428
00:21:06,064 --> 00:21:09,534
If you cannot accept your past,
you punish yourself

429
00:21:09,667 --> 00:21:11,603
in ways that hurt more than...

430
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:13,739
any other punishment
the world can give you.

431
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:16,674
Wallowing in shame

432
00:21:16,974 --> 00:21:18,644
will take away your power

433
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:21,212
from the things
you can actually change.

434
00:21:22,213 --> 00:21:25,284
You kids today like saying
people should be cancelled,

435
00:21:26,117 --> 00:21:28,819
as if you can really
cancel human beings.

436
00:21:30,388 --> 00:21:32,190
More than cancelling people,

437
00:21:32,723 --> 00:21:34,925
we should call them out
for their mistakes

438
00:21:35,826 --> 00:21:39,096
while recognizing
their capacity for change.

439
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,303
That was Max's point
at my trial.

440
00:21:44,435 --> 00:21:45,202
Exactly.

441
00:21:45,903 --> 00:21:47,471
Prove to yourself and to them

442
00:21:47,605 --> 00:21:50,474
that everything Ms. Del Valle
said at your trial was true.

443
00:21:51,876 --> 00:21:54,346
Show them you've changed.

444
00:22:04,588 --> 00:22:06,325
[Daniel] Were you so bored
with your charmed life,

445
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:09,326
you just had to create problems
for yourself?

446
00:22:10,761 --> 00:22:14,965
Maybe your mom and I
didn't raise you well

447
00:22:15,634 --> 00:22:18,603
if you're being applauded
for meeting the bare minimum

448
00:22:18,737 --> 00:22:20,337
of being a decent human being.

449
00:22:20,471 --> 00:22:21,272
Well Evita...

450
00:22:22,874 --> 00:22:25,176
we failed as parents.

451
00:22:26,411 --> 00:22:27,112
[Evita] Hon,

452
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,548
let's not rehash that.

453
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:35,086
Your son has apologized
and has changed, right?

454
00:22:38,123 --> 00:22:41,292
And Deib will make it up
to those he hurt, sir.

455
00:22:43,662 --> 00:22:44,762
[Daniel] But, I have to say.

456
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:50,201
My son, for all his faults, is
lucky to have someone like you,

457
00:22:50,335 --> 00:22:52,537
who believes in him
the way you do.

458
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:54,239
But here's my question -

459
00:22:55,339 --> 00:22:58,375
are you like that with everyone?
Or just my son?

460
00:23:00,912 --> 00:23:02,547
When you love someone,

461
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:04,516
you never give up on them.

462
00:23:06,484 --> 00:23:09,587
You will look for
what's worth loving in them.

463
00:23:10,355 --> 00:23:13,825
And I always find what's
worth loving about your son.

464
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:20,898
Well, hon?

465
00:23:30,674 --> 00:23:31,410
You know what...

466
00:23:33,077 --> 00:23:34,445
Headmaster at least...

467
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,982
he believes in me.

468
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:41,952
But my dad...

469
00:23:43,121 --> 00:23:44,756
thinks I'm a lost cause.

470
00:23:45,289 --> 00:23:48,425
Maybe he's just stressed, Deib.

471
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:52,364
Nah. I don't think so, Max.

472
00:23:54,499 --> 00:23:58,303
I sometimes wonder if my dad
ever really wanted me.

473
00:23:59,203 --> 00:23:59,770
Deib...

474
00:23:59,904 --> 00:24:02,039
All I do is disappoint him.

475
00:24:03,107 --> 00:24:05,376
I can't make him happy.

476
00:24:06,411 --> 00:24:08,078
I'm honestly
thinking about it...

477
00:24:09,213 --> 00:24:14,286
even if I cure my brother
or solve his case,

478
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:19,057
it won't amount to anything
in my dad's eyes.

479
00:24:25,063 --> 00:24:27,898
Deib, I'm sure,
you and your dad will be okay,

480
00:24:29,366 --> 00:24:35,707
but I want you to know,
I'm so proud of you.

481
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:37,741
And I'm happy with you.

482
00:24:38,108 --> 00:24:40,545
I have faith
that the people you hurt

483
00:24:41,645 --> 00:24:46,518
will see your sincerity
and forgive you in time.

484
00:24:50,755 --> 00:24:51,623
I hope so.

485
00:25:00,164 --> 00:25:01,266
I'm so sorry, Mr. Quisimbing.

486
00:25:01,398 --> 00:25:02,834
I promise you
it won't happen again.

487
00:25:02,968 --> 00:25:05,170
What's important is they
learned their lesson.

488
00:25:10,741 --> 00:25:11,576
Mr. Enrile,

489
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:13,345
what are you doing here?

490
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:15,180
Sir!

491
00:25:15,881 --> 00:25:17,281
Sir, I got this.

492
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:19,984
It's my fault anyway.

493
00:25:21,886 --> 00:25:23,255
Guys, sorry.

494
00:25:24,823 --> 00:25:26,423
Sorry for all the trauma,
humiliation,

495
00:25:27,491 --> 00:25:29,827
and hurt that I've caused you.
Sorry.

496
00:25:30,494 --> 00:25:33,832
Sorry, too,
for what we did to your car.

497
00:25:33,964 --> 00:25:35,599
I was the one who beat you up.

498
00:25:36,134 --> 00:25:37,602
[Jaybee]
You shouldn't do this alone.

499
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:45,109
[poignant music playing]

500
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:01,326
[Headmaster] Rivalry no more!

501
00:26:01,459 --> 00:26:03,929
Benison and Southbay boys
all grown up!

502
00:26:04,496 --> 00:26:05,262
[Kristine Gelito]
Proud of you, Deib!

503
00:26:05,396 --> 00:26:06,330
[JP Raymundo] Good job, boys!

504
00:26:06,463 --> 00:26:07,265
[Daisy Albano]
A sight for sore eyes!

505
00:26:07,398 --> 00:26:08,599
[Carmel Daza]
Hope this continues!

506
00:26:08,732 --> 00:26:10,201
Guys, snacks...

507
00:26:11,702 --> 00:26:13,337
Bro, thank you!

508
00:26:16,974 --> 00:26:18,242
Bro, thank you!

509
00:26:20,111 --> 00:26:21,278
Here, guys,

510
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,547
cookies.

511
00:26:22,681 --> 00:26:23,347
They're delicious!

512
00:26:24,048 --> 00:26:25,450
It's actually my favorite.

513
00:26:26,785 --> 00:26:28,118
Sure, thank you.

514
00:26:33,357 --> 00:26:34,224
Yummy!

515
00:26:35,894 --> 00:26:37,394
Thanks for earlier, guys.

516
00:26:49,074 --> 00:26:50,575
What did I do to you again?

517
00:26:51,576 --> 00:26:53,010
You tried to fit me
into my locker.

518
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,615
Jaybee Jose, right?

519
00:26:57,749 --> 00:26:58,549
You remember me?

520
00:26:59,084 --> 00:26:59,884
Yeah,

521
00:27:00,818 --> 00:27:03,153
you're the one who talks to
the plants in bio class, right?

522
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:06,257
-[laughter]
-Yeah, actually.

523
00:27:08,425 --> 00:27:09,394
Guys,

524
00:27:11,195 --> 00:27:13,365
I just wanna apologize
to each of you.

525
00:27:15,232 --> 00:27:17,335
It's okay
if you don't forgive me.

526
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:19,403
I get it.

527
00:27:20,771 --> 00:27:23,807
[Deib] I know the apology
is just the beginning.

528
00:27:23,942 --> 00:27:29,047
If I can do anything to help you
guys get over all the trauma,

529
00:27:29,646 --> 00:27:31,415
please tell me.

530
00:27:32,349 --> 00:27:34,118
If you wanna get back at me,

531
00:27:34,786 --> 00:27:35,787
go right ahead.

532
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,688
Really?

533
00:27:37,021 --> 00:27:37,555
[Deib] Yeah!

534
00:27:37,922 --> 00:27:38,589
Game?

535
00:27:39,023 --> 00:27:39,590
[Jaybee] Sure.

536
00:27:40,392 --> 00:27:42,594
[Kurt]
Okay, Deib, if you say so.

537
00:27:42,727 --> 00:27:43,161
[Jaybee] Okay.

538
00:27:43,294 --> 00:27:43,994
[Digz] Your funeral!

539
00:27:44,328 --> 00:27:44,828
[Jaybee] Okay,

540
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:46,431
ready!

541
00:27:46,964 --> 00:27:47,766
Initiate!

542
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:54,806
-[Jaybee] Woo!
-[Kurt] Aahh!

543
00:27:56,907 --> 00:27:57,709
We're okay?

544
00:27:57,842 --> 00:27:58,643
Yup!

545
00:27:58,777 --> 00:28:00,612
[laughter]

546
00:28:00,744 --> 00:28:02,113
You're wet!

547
00:28:05,849 --> 00:28:07,051
Let's get soaked together!

548
00:28:07,184 --> 00:28:08,653
[laughter]

549
00:28:10,954 --> 00:28:12,490
Big bro, I got you this bonsai!

550
00:28:13,357 --> 00:28:16,193
My new friend Jaybee said

551
00:28:17,394 --> 00:28:21,231
it's perfect for healing
and protection from bad spirits.

552
00:28:22,366 --> 00:28:24,134
That's nice, Babybabe.

553
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:25,836
They're your friends now.

554
00:28:26,438 --> 00:28:30,340
I told you. Just show them
how you truly feel

555
00:28:30,474 --> 00:28:33,912
and they'll see you're sincere
with your apology.

556
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:36,448
I'm so happy for you, MOO.

557
00:28:37,182 --> 00:28:38,282
MOO,

558
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:40,785
only because of you.

559
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:42,252
Thank you so much
for always believing in me.

560
00:28:42,386 --> 00:28:45,355
Don't thank me.

561
00:28:45,722 --> 00:28:47,192
This is all you.

562
00:28:48,292 --> 00:28:50,494
It's your choice to change
and be a good person.

563
00:28:51,362 --> 00:28:53,330
It's their choice
to forgive you.

564
00:28:53,798 --> 00:28:55,732
Now, Deib,

565
00:28:58,435 --> 00:29:00,704
you should forgive yourself.

566
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,775
I'll get there, Max.

567
00:29:04,476 --> 00:29:04,875
Deib,

568
00:29:06,076 --> 00:29:10,181
you need to forgive yourself,
not only for your sins

569
00:29:10,615 --> 00:29:15,385
but also for things
that are not your fault.

570
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:18,155
I can tell
you still blame yourself

571
00:29:18,288 --> 00:29:19,656
for what happened to Dale.

572
00:29:21,625 --> 00:29:22,393
Deib,

573
00:29:23,027 --> 00:29:24,628
it's not your fault,

574
00:29:25,063 --> 00:29:26,196
okay?

575
00:29:30,667 --> 00:29:31,603
I just...

576
00:29:33,637 --> 00:29:35,807
can't help but feel responsible.

577
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:38,175
I feel like

578
00:29:38,942 --> 00:29:40,644
I can only forgive myself

579
00:29:40,778 --> 00:29:44,348
if I find the person
who shot my brother.

580
00:29:44,481 --> 00:29:47,251
You can't carry this guilt
forever.

581
00:29:47,818 --> 00:29:50,188
What if you don't find
the culprit?

582
00:29:50,922 --> 00:29:51,955
I don't know, Max.

583
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:55,492
I hope we find him soon.

584
00:29:55,993 --> 00:29:58,563
They need to pay
for what happened to my brother.

585
00:29:59,364 --> 00:30:01,398
Not to take away my guilt,

586
00:30:01,532 --> 00:30:04,635
but to give my brother
the justice he deserves.

587
00:30:09,273 --> 00:30:09,874
[sniffles]

588
00:30:22,119 --> 00:30:24,422
[suspenseful music playing]

589
00:30:29,093 --> 00:30:30,161
Ce... Cell...

590
00:30:30,295 --> 00:30:31,528
What's that?

591
00:30:31,828 --> 00:30:33,096
Go on, sir.

592
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:34,566
Speak slowly, sir.

593
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:37,634
Cell... Cell...

594
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:38,836
Cellphone.

595
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:40,305
Cellphone?

596
00:30:41,205 --> 00:30:42,073
We didn't find
a cellphone with you

597
00:30:42,207 --> 00:30:44,608
when you were brought here.

598
00:30:45,076 --> 00:30:46,144
Even your wallet.

599
00:30:46,277 --> 00:30:48,378
Can you recall your name?

600
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,182
Go on, sir.
Just think it through.

601
00:30:52,317 --> 00:30:54,184
-My... My name?
-Slowly.

602
00:30:54,451 --> 00:30:55,787
Calm down, sir.

603
00:30:58,323 --> 00:30:59,691
I don't know...

604
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:01,593
Can't remember my name.

605
00:31:02,926 --> 00:31:05,829
Calm down, sir.

606
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,102
Are you done? Be quick!

607
00:31:11,236 --> 00:31:13,872
Your inspiration board
is so extra, girl!

608
00:31:14,005 --> 00:31:17,107
Don't be so high maintenance!

609
00:31:17,442 --> 00:31:18,609
If I were Lee,

610
00:31:18,742 --> 00:31:20,178
I'd be stressed
from all the things

611
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:21,278
you want to happen
on your monthsary.

612
00:31:21,412 --> 00:31:23,981
Can't you just be supportive?!

613
00:31:24,115 --> 00:31:25,250
What about you, Max?

614
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:26,917
Do you have a monthsary gift
for Deib?

615
00:31:27,518 --> 00:31:33,590
Think it should be creative
and personalized...

616
00:31:34,925 --> 00:31:37,095
Should I ask Ysay
to draw a portrait of us?

617
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:38,596
Stop me!

618
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:41,965
Oh my God, that's what I was
thinking for our monthsary, too!

619
00:31:42,099 --> 00:31:43,300
Oh my God!

620
00:31:43,433 --> 00:31:47,137
Wait! Speaking of,
where are Ysay and Michiko?

621
00:31:47,271 --> 00:31:49,773
Something urgent came up
with Ysay.

622
00:31:49,906 --> 00:31:53,944
Michiko is at church.
I saw her IG story.

623
00:31:54,444 --> 00:31:56,247
Here, she looks alone.

624
00:31:56,381 --> 00:31:57,281
[Michiko]
Hoping to find some answers.

625
00:31:57,414 --> 00:31:59,250
[gasps]
Oh my God, that makes me cry!

626
00:31:59,384 --> 00:32:02,953
I can't handle it, sis!
Sorry.

627
00:32:03,288 --> 00:32:04,255
What about you, Max,

628
00:32:04,388 --> 00:32:06,490
what did you do
on the first monthsary

629
00:32:06,624 --> 00:32:08,358
after Randall ghosted you?

630
00:32:09,493 --> 00:32:12,963
On the monthsary
after he ghosted me...

631
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:17,669
I sent him texts,
chats, messages on FB.

632
00:32:17,801 --> 00:32:19,671
But I got nothing.
I cried so hard.

633
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:23,040
But the next day,
I still wrote him, hoping.

634
00:32:23,674 --> 00:32:24,575
But sis,

635
00:32:24,709 --> 00:32:27,444
did you ever think about
the possibility of RJ

636
00:32:27,577 --> 00:32:29,146
having side chicks in America?

637
00:32:29,413 --> 00:32:29,846
Hey!

638
00:32:30,347 --> 00:32:30,882
What?

639
00:32:31,015 --> 00:32:32,517
Yeah, at first.

640
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:36,820
But he explained his side
and I chose to believe him.

641
00:32:37,255 --> 00:32:40,959
Oh my gosh!
That touched my heart and soul!

642
00:32:41,092 --> 00:32:42,326
[laughter]

643
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,760
You're so nice, sis!

644
00:32:43,894 --> 00:32:46,463
When Lee doesn't reply to me
within 5 minutes,

645
00:32:46,596 --> 00:32:49,166
I overthink like crazy!

646
00:32:50,201 --> 00:32:52,869
Speaking of - where's Mine?

647
00:33:00,545 --> 00:33:02,814

Lee!

650
00:33:15,192 --> 00:33:15,692
Ysay!

651
00:33:16,626 --> 00:33:18,096
I'm glad you're here.

652
00:33:19,029 --> 00:33:21,798
Let's hurry
before someone sees us.

653
00:33:23,634 --> 00:33:25,001
I want you to read this.

654
00:33:25,369 --> 00:33:26,903
Hope you like it.

655
00:33:29,807 --> 00:33:31,976

"Every look got me mesmerized.

658
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:45,722
My heart is yours now.

659
00:33:46,391 --> 00:33:49,559
But I have no fear somehow.

660
00:33:50,494 --> 00:33:54,365
I say hello
and ask for your name.

661
00:33:55,098 --> 00:33:57,734
We'll go to paradise
and we'll never be the same.

Let's see the world together.

663
00:34:01,271 --> 00:34:06,210
Will you say yes now
so we can start forever?"

664
00:34:17,954 --> 00:34:18,922

665
00:34:20,023 --> 00:34:20,824
Do you like it?

00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:22,659
Yes,

667
00:34:23,427 --> 00:34:24,327
it's beautiful.

668
00:34:24,461 --> 00:34:25,563

-[Ysay] I'm okay. I'm fine.

-[Lee] I didn't mean to.
-[Ysay] It's okay.

before Naih catches us.

We saw your IG story earlier.

680

I'm just here if you
need someone to talk to.

681
00:35:22,353 --> 00:35:23,954
Thank you, Max.

682
00:35:26,757 --> 00:35:31,027
I'm still sad
and confused about Tob.

683
00:35:31,795 --> 00:35:33,597
I understand.

684
00:35:34,965 --> 00:35:36,800
I went through that, too.

685

It's hard
'cause you don't see it coming.

686
00:35:42,706 --> 00:35:44,041
Suddenly, they're gone.

687

You keep looking for answers,
but you can't find any.

688
00:35:57,188 --> 00:35:59,257
This also happened to Dale
before.

689

Dale?

690
00:36:01,626 --> 00:36:03,059
Deib's brother Dale?

691
00:36:04,262 --> 00:36:05,028
Yeah.

692
00:36:05,929 --> 00:36:07,297
We're batchmates, remember?

693
00:36:08,065 --> 00:36:08,865
Yeah.

694
00:36:09,699 --> 00:36:10,835
Were you close?

695
00:36:12,202 --> 00:36:13,304
I don't know.

696
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:15,306
Maybe...

697
00:36:15,438 --> 00:36:19,976
Well, we used to talk a lot
before he got shot.

698
00:36:20,945 --> 00:36:23,614
He liked the carrot cake
I baked for him.

699
00:36:24,282 --> 00:36:26,684
Do you bake
for all your classmates?

700
00:36:26,817 --> 00:36:29,353
Better bake me one
for my birthday, too!

701
00:36:29,487 --> 00:36:31,289
He's my tutor, okay?

702
00:36:31,588 --> 00:36:32,222
Tutor?

703
00:36:32,623 --> 00:36:33,391
Hmm.

704
00:36:35,092 --> 00:36:38,429
Okay, I had a crush on him.
Before Tob.

705
00:36:38,996 --> 00:36:41,298
-Don't tell the others, okay?
-[both chuckle]

706
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:44,668
Anyway,

707
00:36:45,769 --> 00:36:49,373
he got ghosted
by his girlfriend, Dom.

708
00:36:50,407 --> 00:36:52,809
He poured his heart out to me.

709
00:36:55,813 --> 00:36:57,782
His questions then...

710
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:01,918
are my questions now.

711
00:37:03,621 --> 00:37:04,855
Why?

712
00:37:06,824 --> 00:37:08,391
Is there something wrong
with me?

713
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,896
Am I not enough?

714
00:37:13,463 --> 00:37:15,099
Did I do something wrong?

715
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:21,405
Why did he leave me?

716
00:37:26,844 --> 00:37:28,445
Did he really love me?

717
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:52,503
Tiago, let's just run.
Let's run from the gang.

718
00:37:53,137 --> 00:37:54,304
Run?

719
00:37:54,871 --> 00:37:56,072
You're crazy!

720
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:59,043
Help me out here, bro.

721
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,445
Maybe we can hide somewhere?

722
00:38:01,911 --> 00:38:06,016
Boss will be more pissed
if he finds out you ran!

723
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:08,985
Just do what he told you!

724
00:38:15,425 --> 00:38:16,226
Let's go.

725
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,260
Okay.

726
00:38:23,733 --> 00:38:24,768
Uncle Boyet?

727
00:38:30,574 --> 00:38:32,876
Hey, Max! Michiko!

728
00:38:33,411 --> 00:38:35,246
How's it going?
What are you doing here?

729
00:38:36,447 --> 00:38:37,315
Uncle, who's that?

730
00:38:37,614 --> 00:38:38,782
Your friend?

731
00:38:39,182 --> 00:38:41,851
Huh? No. I don't know.
Who's that?

732
00:38:41,985 --> 00:38:45,322
I saw you both here
before talking by the candles...

733
00:38:45,956 --> 00:38:48,458
Yeah! You remember that?

734
00:38:48,592 --> 00:38:50,061
You spying on me?

735
00:38:50,193 --> 00:38:50,994
[chuckles]

736
00:38:51,128 --> 00:38:54,030
He always asks me
for the mass schedule.

737
00:38:54,164 --> 00:38:56,132
Told me
he wants to go to confession.

738
00:38:56,266 --> 00:38:58,835
Heard he scammed lots of people.

739
00:38:58,969 --> 00:39:00,905
He even tried
to sell me insurance!

740
00:39:01,038 --> 00:39:03,074
Just some weird stranger.
Don't mind him.

741
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,875
You, why are you here?

742
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:06,543
Praying that your ex
comes back to you?

743
00:39:06,976 --> 00:39:09,179
Just forgive him.
I'm sure God did already.

744
00:39:09,579 --> 00:39:11,949
Anyway, let's go home!

745
00:39:12,916 --> 00:39:13,483
[Max] Okay!

746
00:39:14,617 --> 00:39:15,418
[Boyet] Okay!

747
00:39:15,552 --> 00:39:17,188
[Karlie] Hot tea, anyone?

748
00:39:18,789 --> 00:39:20,023
[Karlie] New couple alert!

is now playing with someone

750
00:39:21,791 --> 00:39:22,726
who isn't his girl!

751
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:25,028
[Khloe] OMG! Kim-Deib is back?!

752
00:39:25,161 --> 00:39:27,364
[Naih] Stop you!
Max and Deib are solid!

753
00:39:27,498 --> 00:39:29,333
Don't try to ruin my friends,
Karlie the Karen!

754
00:39:29,467 --> 00:39:32,670
[Migz] That's not Max &amp; Deib!
I'll report you for fake news!

755
00:39:33,103 --> 00:39:34,871
[Karlie]
Did I say it's Max and Deib?!!!

756
00:39:35,338 --> 00:39:36,574
[Lorde] Don't beat
around the bush, Curly!

757
00:39:36,706 --> 00:39:39,009
Tell us the truth
or I'll straighten your hair!!!

758
00:39:39,143 --> 00:39:40,443
[Karlie] THE AUDACITY?!

759
00:39:40,577 --> 00:39:42,913
[Karlie] Are you challenging me,
losers???

760
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:45,449
[Karlie] Fine!
Be careful what you wish for!

00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:55,693
[Lee] Sorry.

765

-[Pat] Ysay looks pretty!
-[Ysay] Let's hurry...

768
00:39:58,628 --> 00:39:59,597
before Naih catches us.

769
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:00,697
[Naih] AAAAAAAHHHHHHH!

770
00:40:00,831 --> 00:40:01,898

771
00:40:05,536 --> 00:40:06,771
Lee! Ysay!

772
00:40:06,903 --> 00:40:07,871
-[Lorde] Naih, stop you!
-[Migz] Calm down, girl!

773
00:40:08,005 --> 00:40:11,007
You shameless flirt!
I was right about you!

774
00:40:11,141 --> 00:40:12,742
Wait. What's happening?!

775
00:40:12,876 --> 00:40:13,978
What's going on?

776
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:15,478
Oh?! What's going on?!

[Ysay yelps]

778
00:40:17,148 --> 00:40:18,481
[Ysay]
Naih, what are you doing?!

779
00:40:18,615 --> 00:40:20,217
[Lee] Naih, stop!

780
00:40:20,351 --> 00:40:22,186
-[Ysay] What did I do?
-[Lee] You're acting crazy!

781
00:40:22,318 --> 00:40:25,322
What did you do?!?
You're trending!

782
00:40:25,456 --> 00:40:27,224
[Lorde] Wait, wait!

783
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:29,726
You're defending
your side chick?!

784
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:31,295
[Lee] Side chick?!
What are you saying?!

785
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:32,563
What?!

786
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:34,597
Look here.

787
00:40:38,101 --> 00:40:38,969
[Naih] See,

788
00:40:39,702 --> 00:40:41,105
you've gone viral!

789
00:40:41,938 --> 00:40:45,342
See for yourself!
That's what you're doing!

790
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:48,579
And you're laughing?!
Hold this, Migz!

791

-[Naih] Really?!
-[Lorde] Not my Master!

What?!

793
00:40:51,414 --> 00:40:53,050
Naih, stop!
Calm down and listen to me!

794
00:40:53,184 --> 00:40:55,552
I don't wanna listen
to your excuses!

795
00:40:55,686 --> 00:40:57,487
Stop fighting and listen to me!

796
00:41:01,192 --> 00:41:03,360
Ysay, show it to her please.

797
00:41:07,764 --> 00:41:08,632
What's that?

798
00:41:14,838 --> 00:41:16,239
[Lee]
The video that you just watched?

799
00:41:17,173 --> 00:41:18,708
This was what
Ysay and I were doing.

800
00:41:19,476 --> 00:41:21,911
I asked Ysay to help me write
you a song for our monthsary.

801
00:41:22,713 --> 00:41:23,914
Ysay told me
that you've been wanting me

802
00:41:24,047 --> 00:41:25,715
to write you a song
for the longest time.

803
00:41:29,253 --> 00:41:32,489
Why was Ysay afraid
I'd catch you?

804
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:36,059
Because it was supposed to be
a surprise!

805
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:38,661
It's true, Naih.

806
00:41:38,963 --> 00:41:40,264
Lee asked for my help.

807
00:41:40,396 --> 00:41:43,099
I just wanted to help because
I wanted to surprise you, too,

808
00:41:43,233 --> 00:41:44,668
but this happened.

809
00:41:45,135 --> 00:41:50,407
My God! Sorry.
Sorry, friend. Sorry, Ysay.

810
00:41:51,574 --> 00:41:56,547
Sorry. Sorry, Mine.
I'm just afraid of losing you.

811
00:41:56,981 --> 00:41:59,650
Our monthsary is still on,
right?

812
00:42:02,085 --> 00:42:04,054
Super sorry.

813
00:42:05,054 --> 00:42:09,425
Sorry, too, friend. Sorry.

814
00:42:09,559 --> 00:42:11,695
Mine, sorry!

815
00:42:13,097 --> 00:42:14,465
[Lorde]
No one's gonna say sorry to me?

816
00:42:14,931 --> 00:42:17,601
All your crazy girlfriend's
punches landed on me, Master!

817
00:42:18,601 --> 00:42:19,402
Ouch.

[Deib] Hi, Babybabe!

822
00:42:36,487 --> 00:42:39,523
Just finished
2 hours of school service.

823
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:42,393
34 more hours to go.

824
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:45,362
What did Headmaster make you do?

825
00:42:45,795 --> 00:42:47,697
Clean all the boys' restrooms.

826
00:42:47,831 --> 00:42:49,233
Huh?

827
00:42:49,365 --> 00:42:51,168
But it's okay. I enjoyed it.
It's a different experience.

828
00:42:51,302 --> 00:42:54,771
Wow, Deib Lohr Enrile
cleaning the washroom!

829
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:55,873
Right?

830
00:42:56,172 --> 00:42:57,641
What do you have to do tomorrow?

831
00:42:58,141 --> 00:42:59,443
Tomorrow...

832
00:43:00,277 --> 00:43:06,150
I asked Headmaster for a day off
since it's our monthsary.

833
00:43:06,717 --> 00:43:07,617
He said yes.

834
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:09,052
That's nice, MOO.

835
00:43:09,552 --> 00:43:11,422
But I hope we can hang
with the whole gang

836
00:43:11,554 --> 00:43:14,657
before our romantic dinner
tomorrow.

837
00:43:14,791 --> 00:43:15,626
Yeah.

838
00:43:16,293 --> 00:43:19,496
Let's do something
to lessen Michiko's sadness.

839
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:21,164
Yeah.

840
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:25,603
I think I know what to do
with the gang tomorrow.

841
00:43:25,735 --> 00:43:26,670
What?

842
00:43:26,804 --> 00:43:30,106

has a new karaoke place...

00:43:31,909 --> 00:43:33,010
We should all come!

845
00:43:33,876 --> 00:43:38,282
I think it's a great time for us
to support Kurt and Michiko.

846
00:43:40,384 --> 00:43:42,186
Really? So you're friends
with Kurt now, huh?

Yeah!

00:45:49,813 --> 00:45:54,418
RJ, I just need
to take care of something.

894
00:45:55,385 --> 00:45:56,987
[Boyet]
Take care of everyone for me.

895
00:45:57,887 --> 00:46:02,326
Don't forget
mom's medicine schedule.

896
00:46:02,793 --> 00:46:05,929
And take care of Max, okay?

897
00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:10,534
Uncle Boyet,
why are you saying goodbye

898
00:46:10,666 --> 00:46:12,001
like you're never coming back?

899
00:46:12,869 --> 00:46:13,737
I have to go.

900
00:46:21,844 --> 00:46:28,684
[suspenseful music playing]

901
00:47:03,619 --> 00:47:05,621
[Tiago] If you don't go with us,

902
00:47:05,755 --> 00:47:08,192
Boss will come after you next.

903
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:09,860
Lord, forgive me
for what I'm about to do.

904
00:47:09,992 --> 00:47:12,829
Max and I will go on a date
for our first month.

905
00:47:12,963 --> 00:47:15,599
I'd like to ask
for your permission, sir.

906
00:47:15,731 --> 00:47:17,266
For the girl who never fails
to make me laugh.

907
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:19,036
-[friends squealing]
-[Lee] Naih...

908
00:47:19,536 --> 00:47:22,505
[Deib] Max,
can we reenact our first kiss?

909
00:47:22,639 --> 00:47:25,108
Reservation? I didn't make one.

910
00:47:25,242 --> 00:47:27,978
[receptionist] I think this is
a surprise from Mr. Yanai.

911
00:47:28,411 --> 00:47:29,045
Tob?

912
00:47:30,447 --> 00:47:31,815
[Michiko]
Thank you for coming back.
