[Deib] Love coupons?

00:00:03,269 --> 00:00:05,437
Your wish is my command.

3
00:00:05,972 --> 00:00:07,040
Just because
I'm friends with someone

4
00:00:07,173 --> 00:00:09,041
doesn't mean I always
have to share their opinion.

5
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:10,377
[Lee] And just because
you're my girlfriend

6
00:00:10,509 --> 00:00:12,345
doesn't mean I should
side with you all the time.

7
00:00:12,478 --> 00:00:12,912
Dale?

8
00:00:13,212 --> 00:00:14,814
He's my tutor.

9
00:00:14,948 --> 00:00:15,881
Tutor?

10
00:00:16,015 --> 00:00:17,649
-He was my crush before Tob.
-Mhmm.

11
00:00:17,783 --> 00:00:19,986
I'm so happy I wasn't alone.

12
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,056
And it wasn't
a stranger's face I woke up to.

13
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:25,625
[Max]
Thank you. I know I hurt you.

14
00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:27,160
[RJ] We've been through so much
together.

15
00:00:27,292 --> 00:00:28,361
I just can't
throw all that away.

16
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:32,265
Max, Tiago's turned on me!
He says I shot Dale!

17
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:33,466
[Deib] You've known for a while?

18
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,070

no lies, no secrets.

You okay?

Don't worry, Max.

00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:04,424
Sorry they messed with you, too.

41
00:02:04,557 --> 00:02:05,391
I'm okay.

42
00:02:07,192 --> 00:02:08,828
[Ysay] Are you okay, Max?

43
00:02:09,795 --> 00:02:10,830
I'm alright.

44
00:02:11,163 --> 00:02:12,031
Don't worry.

45
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:15,435
Max, Deib is just talking
to the boys.

46
00:02:15,935 --> 00:02:17,871
[Michiko] Here, drink this.

47
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,240
Thank you.

48
00:02:22,307 --> 00:02:23,610
How is...

49
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:25,544
Dale?

50
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:29,048
We talked earlier.

51
00:02:29,681 --> 00:02:32,284
They're all still pretty shocked
from all the revelations.

52
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:36,656
[Michiko] But Dale is more
concerned about Deib and Evita.

53
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:39,626
How is Aunt Evita?

54
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:41,326
Angry.

55
00:02:42,294 --> 00:02:43,896
Hurt, because...

56
00:02:45,063 --> 00:02:46,399
you lied...

57
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,135
I didn't lie.

58
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:52,504
I was gonna tell them,
but it was too late.

59
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:55,842
They found out
before I got around to it.

60
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:58,044
I hope they believe you, Max.

61
00:02:58,877 --> 00:03:01,080
I hope they believe
that Uncle Boyet is innocent.

62
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:02,848
Is he really innocent, Max?

63
00:03:03,348 --> 00:03:04,751
-Hey!
-Naih!

64
00:03:06,118 --> 00:03:08,221
I was just asking a question.

It wasn't sarcastic!

66
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:12,558
Naih,

67
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:15,929
Uncle Boyet didn't shoot Dale.

68
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:18,897
Don't worry.
I believe you, Maxie.

69
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:23,836
I'm just afraid this would
tear apart our group.

70
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:25,771
You know?

71
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:27,774
I don't know
how Lee and I would...

72
00:03:28,741 --> 00:03:31,711
Naih, I'd understand
if you'd go with Lee.

73
00:03:32,344 --> 00:03:33,346
It's okay.

74
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:36,181
No, Max!
We should all stay together!

75
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:38,550
[Naih]
You and Deib will be okay soon!

76
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:41,587
And girl, we'll never leave you.

We're just here, okay?

want to talk about it or nah?

we can interrogate Maxpein

to get an admission?

I know that feeling.

The feeling of being
in the same space,

112
00:06:29,855 --> 00:06:32,791
breathing the same air
as the person who hurt you.

113

Seeing their face hurts
just as much.

You question everything
you thought

Every moment
you had with that person

the night we broke up.

And it hurt.

132
00:07:36,221 --> 00:07:37,122
I know that...

133
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:39,658
I was the girl who broke you.

134
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,862
But I was also the girl
you ran to

135
00:07:43,995 --> 00:07:46,966
every time you felt like
your world was falling apart.

136
00:07:49,601 --> 00:07:51,036
I can be that girl again...

138
00:07:57,576 --> 00:07:58,845
Kim, I appreciate the honesty,
but--

139
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:01,581
I'm not trying
to be your girlfriend, Deib.

140
00:08:03,815 --> 00:08:05,317
I'm trying to be your friend.

Yeah, Max.

145
00:08:36,448 --> 00:08:37,950
Maybe they're just talking.

146
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:41,287

it's never just "talking."

Sorry, guys, I need some space.

154
00:08:59,971 --> 00:09:02,107
I hope Deib gives Kim
a second chance.

155
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,844
[Karlie] The universe
is giving them a second chance!

156

And Kim didn't even have to do
anything to break them up!

157
00:09:08,179 --> 00:09:09,215

-Yes, future prison inmate?

159

Oh,
you're going to prison with me!

160
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:16,022
Why do you keep messing
with the couples in Benison?!

161
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:19,292
You're just bitter
'cause you're single!

162
00:09:19,424 --> 00:09:21,860
By choice!
Consciously single!

163
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:24,629
Or maybe just unconsciously
undatable.

164
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:26,499
Ha! Burn!

165
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:28,900
Naih,
you don't have to drag Karlie

166
00:09:29,034 --> 00:09:31,703
for giving an honest, no-cap
assessment of the situation.

167
00:09:31,836 --> 00:09:34,105
Slow down, Khloe. Can't keep up!

168
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,375
And besides, Kim and Deib
have a long history.

169
00:09:38,043 --> 00:09:39,312
[Khloe] They are each other's
first love.

170
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:41,379
[Khloe]
Maybe they're meant to be.

171
00:09:41,846 --> 00:09:44,549
Just like Elle's mom and dad
who ended up together

172
00:09:44,683 --> 00:09:46,751
despite
Max's mom getting in the way.

173
00:09:46,885 --> 00:09:49,855
And that squammy Max
keeps getting in the way

174
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:51,624
of Kim and Deib's love story,
too!

175
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:54,826
Actually,
I feel bad for you, Elle.

176
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:56,495
Your family has been torn apart
because of Maxpein--

177
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:57,830
You don't know crap, Karlie!

178
00:09:58,364 --> 00:10:01,232
So shut up! Don't you dare
bring up my family again!

179
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,702
[Migz] And don't compare
Kim to Aunt Macy.

180
00:10:04,269 --> 00:10:07,239
Kim is a cheater!
She's a liar!

181
00:10:07,572 --> 00:10:09,708
Maybe Kim betrayed Deib,

182
00:10:09,841 --> 00:10:10,976
but it's more forgivable
than Max's betrayal--

183
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,278
What Max did wasn't a betrayal.

184
00:10:13,078 --> 00:10:14,312
She was just protecting
her uncle--

185
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:15,780
Do you hear yourself, Michiko?!

186
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:18,317
How would Dale feel
if he found out

187
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:19,485
you're defending the person

188
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,253
who let the man
who shot him get away?

189
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:22,955
You done being stupid?!

190
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:24,756
What did you say?!

191
00:10:24,889 --> 00:10:26,692
-[indistinct quarreling]
-Hit me!

192
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:28,259
[Michiko] Naih, stop!

193
00:10:29,461 --> 00:10:31,163
What's happening here?

194
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,398
[quarreling stops]

195
00:10:33,231 --> 00:10:35,100
Am I going to have to suspend
or detain all of you?

196
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:39,404
No, Headmaster.
We were just playing...

197
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:41,841
"Only Lorde Knows!"

198
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,475
[all in nervous agreement]

199
00:10:45,244 --> 00:10:47,746
We've been playing this
since we were kids!

200
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:53,219
[whispering] Just go with it.

201
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,690
Lorde has to guess
who among us is hitting him.

202
00:10:57,822 --> 00:10:58,758
[Lorde] Huh?!

203
00:10:58,890 --> 00:10:59,557
[Lorde]
What kind of game is that?!

204
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:01,126
[whispering]
Take one for the team!

205
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,697
[Lee] So Lorde
has to close his eyes...

206
00:11:05,063 --> 00:11:05,865
Close your eyes, Lorde...

207
00:11:06,298 --> 00:11:07,932
and then guess
who's gonna hit you, okay?

208
00:11:08,466 --> 00:11:09,301
[Lee] Alright, game!

209
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:12,437
[light slap]

210
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:13,304
Owww!

211
00:11:13,806 --> 00:11:16,609
I the Lorde knows!
That was Naih!

212
00:11:16,741 --> 00:11:17,942
Can't mistake
those heavy hands!

213
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:19,812
It was me...

214
00:11:20,178 --> 00:11:20,879
You?!

215
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:23,115
It's fine then.

216
00:11:23,548 --> 00:11:24,616
Hit me baby one more time!

217
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:25,583
[nervous laughter]

218
00:11:25,717 --> 00:11:27,452
That's how we do it!

219
00:11:27,586 --> 00:11:28,486
Alright!

220
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:29,321
Who's next?

221
00:11:30,855 --> 00:11:31,423
[hard slap]

222
00:11:31,756 --> 00:11:32,424
Ouch! That hurts!

223
00:11:33,058 --> 00:11:34,793
Naih, that's too much!

224
00:11:35,226 --> 00:11:37,129
You said to hit you again.

225
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:38,764
Khloe,

226
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:41,801
if it's you again,
you're paying with a kiss!

227
00:11:41,933 --> 00:11:43,469
[nervous laughter]

228
00:11:43,601 --> 00:11:44,235
Yeah!

229
00:11:44,836 --> 00:11:45,904
[hand slapping head]

230
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:47,306
Ouch!

231
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:48,541
Where's my kiss?

232
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:50,308
[Headmaster] That was me.

233
00:11:50,942 --> 00:11:51,943
Still want a kiss?

234
00:11:52,544 --> 00:11:53,946
You want a kiss, Headmaster?

235
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:55,548
[fake laughter]

236
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:02,388
Attorney,
has Boyet called you again?

237
00:12:02,788 --> 00:12:03,422
No.

238
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:05,791
He hasn't called or texted.

239
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:09,595
I'm worried.
Maybe something happened to him.

240
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:13,499
Dad, what's the latest update
on the case?

241
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:18,604
I got a copy
of Santiago Notarte's affidavit.

242
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:21,005
According to his statement...

243
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:23,509
Boyet shot Dale.

244
00:12:23,642 --> 00:12:25,711
-My God! That can't be true...
-[tense music playing]

245
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:27,278
[Randy] It isn't, Grams.

246
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:28,813
Of course it isn't.

247
00:12:29,414 --> 00:12:33,184
Max,
Deib mentioned a CCTV footage

248
00:12:33,318 --> 00:12:36,087
that his private investigator
got, right?

249
00:12:36,221 --> 00:12:40,458
Agila, yes. He had a video,
but Deib never got it.

250
00:12:41,025 --> 00:12:42,861
[Randy] Our investigators
found the security agency

251
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:44,929
where they got the CCTV footage.

252
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:46,698
The footage has been erased,

253
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:49,769
but the technicians
remember watching it

254
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:51,636
with Agila's associate.

255
00:12:52,837 --> 00:12:54,639
And? What did they say?

256
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,375
We showed them Boyet's picture.

257
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:58,210
Based on what they saw,

258
00:12:59,043 --> 00:13:00,312
Boyet wasn't the shooter.

259
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:01,679
That's great.

260
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:04,015
Can't they testify and say that?

261
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,184
Just one problem.

262
00:13:06,684 --> 00:13:07,418
What?

263
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,154
The CCTV footage was cut.

264
00:13:10,188 --> 00:13:11,923
There was a blackout
on the night of the crime.

265
00:13:12,357 --> 00:13:15,494
But if they're saying
Boyet wasn't the shooter...

266
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:18,429
Based on Notarte's affidavit,

267
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,533
Dale wasn't only shot once.

268
00:13:21,767 --> 00:13:22,934
[Randy] He was shot twice.

269
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:25,403
Max, did you know about this?

270
00:13:27,572 --> 00:13:29,542
[Randy] In the video
that the technicians saw,

271
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:31,811
there was only one gunshot.

272
00:13:32,477 --> 00:13:35,014
Boyet only arrived
after Dale was shot.

273
00:13:35,346 --> 00:13:37,416
Then they saw Boyet
on a phone call.

274
00:13:37,549 --> 00:13:38,216
[Maxim] Okay...

275
00:13:38,884 --> 00:13:40,519
doesn't that corroborate
Boyet's story?

276
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,554
But according to Tiago,

277
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,124
Boyet shot Dale a second time

278
00:13:45,724 --> 00:13:47,759
to make sure Dale died.

279
00:13:47,893 --> 00:13:48,961
[Bhaves]
Boyet would never do that!

280
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:53,065
The CCTV didn't get
the second shooting

281
00:13:53,198 --> 00:13:54,232
because of the blackout.

282
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:59,171
But Uncle Boyet
didn't shoot Dale...

283
00:14:00,072 --> 00:14:02,408
Max, I know
Boyet would never do that,

284
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:05,144
but right now
it's harder to prove

285
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:08,913
because Tiago's story
matches up with Dale's injury.

286
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:12,518
Two bullets were recovered
from his body.

287
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:15,019
That's why the Enriles
are so angry

288
00:14:15,153 --> 00:14:18,557
because the second bullet
means the shooter

289
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:19,892
had the intent to kill.

290
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:24,296
But didn't Uncle Boyet say
he called for an ambulance

291
00:14:24,429 --> 00:14:25,898
to help Dale?

292
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,966
[Max]
Phone records can prove that.

293
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:29,434
[RJ] Yeah, Dad.

294
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:32,504
Uncle Boyet wouldn't call for
an ambulance if he was guilty.

295
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:35,506
[Randy] The prosecutor
can argue that Boyet

296
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:39,110
called for an ambulance
precisely because he's guilty.

297
00:14:39,677 --> 00:14:40,913
Really, Dad?

298
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:42,147
He double-tapped the victim,

299
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,383
then called an ambulance
out of guilt?

300
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:48,386
Where's the prosecutors'
common sense?

301
00:14:48,653 --> 00:14:49,654
I don't get it!

302
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:50,389
[Randy] Sweetie,

303
00:14:50,956 --> 00:14:51,956
you have a point,

304
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:55,159
but right now
we need to find solid evidence

305
00:14:55,293 --> 00:14:59,230
that will show
that Boyet didn't shoot Dale

306
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:01,567
the first time
and the second time,

307
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:05,738
and also to disprove
Tiago Notarte's testimony.

308
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:10,042
I'm scared.

309
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:42,573
How are you?

310
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:46,477
I'm okay...

311
00:15:50,982 --> 00:15:52,116
I'm not sure.

312
00:15:52,684 --> 00:15:54,219
[sad music playing]

313
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,721
So many things have changed.

314
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:02,327
I've discovered so much
about the people I love.

315
00:16:04,562 --> 00:16:05,464
With Dad,

316
00:16:07,432 --> 00:16:08,533
with Mom,

317
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:10,568
with Uncle Boyet,

318
00:16:12,504 --> 00:16:13,438
with Deib...

319
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:17,475
so much has changed....

320
00:16:18,876 --> 00:16:21,080
Even your love for them changed?

321
00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:23,315
[RJ] Because of the things
you discovered?

322
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:27,619
I want to believe otherwise.

323
00:16:30,788 --> 00:16:34,592
But every time
reality slaps me with the truth,

324
00:16:36,528 --> 00:16:39,197
I remember what they did wrong.

325
00:16:40,765 --> 00:16:42,634
I question myself.

326
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:46,739
Was I stupid and blind
about their mistakes

327
00:16:46,871 --> 00:16:48,173
just because I love them?

328
00:16:52,043 --> 00:16:54,113
Zell's right.

329
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:57,682
It's like
I turned my back on who I was

330
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:02,388
and everything I believed in
when I chose to love Deib.

331
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,258
[Max] I also believe that...

332
00:17:06,825 --> 00:17:10,828
love means being faithful,

333
00:17:11,896 --> 00:17:13,164
that cheating is wrong,

334
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:18,770
then I discover
what my mom and dad did.

335
00:17:22,106 --> 00:17:23,241
And I'm...

336
00:17:26,744 --> 00:17:27,813
I'm the...

337
00:17:28,579 --> 00:17:30,715
I'm the reminder of their sin.

338
00:17:32,917 --> 00:17:34,286
Then Uncle Boyet...

339
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,121
[sniffles, exhales]

340
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,722
Sorry, sorry.

341
00:17:37,855 --> 00:17:39,991
[sniffles, exhales]

342
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:41,259
[RJ] Max...

343
00:17:41,859 --> 00:17:43,194
What about you, RJ?

344
00:17:44,663 --> 00:17:46,731
Is there anything
I need to know about you?

345
00:17:49,367 --> 00:17:50,669
[Max] Do you also have something
to tell me

346
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:52,471
that will shake my world?

347
00:17:57,542 --> 00:18:00,645
Who I was when you met me,

348
00:18:01,212 --> 00:18:02,847
[tender music playing]

349
00:18:03,714 --> 00:18:04,750
that's still me.

350
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:06,818
Nothing's changed.

351
00:18:09,587 --> 00:18:10,556
Thanks...

352
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:14,593
for being one of the only things
in my life that stayed the same.

353
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,068
Nothing's changed!

354
00:18:24,702 --> 00:18:27,271
-[Susan] Welcome home, Dale!
-[applause, laughter]

355
00:18:27,405 --> 00:18:30,375
Thank you, Susan, Pia, Lorde!

356
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:31,742
Let's go jogging later!

357
00:18:32,176 --> 00:18:32,845
[laughter]

358
00:18:32,978 --> 00:18:35,513
I've missed you, Dale!

359
00:18:35,646 --> 00:18:39,817
I've been praying
for your healing.

360
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:43,288
And for whoever hurt you
to be caught.

361
00:18:44,088 --> 00:18:45,590
Don't worry, Susan,

362
00:18:45,723 --> 00:18:47,392
I'll make sure that criminal
rots in jail

363
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:48,359
for the rest of his life.

364
00:18:48,493 --> 00:18:52,131
Susan, show the nurse his room

365
00:18:52,263 --> 00:18:53,664
and get him something to eat
please.

366
00:18:53,798 --> 00:18:55,099
Alright, let's go!

367
00:18:55,233 --> 00:18:56,367
[Dale] Thank you, Susan!

368
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:57,970
-Mom...
-[Evita] Yeah?

369
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:00,806
Do I really need
a personal nurse?

370
00:19:01,272 --> 00:19:02,340
Yes!

371
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:05,943
Mom, I can help Dale
with whatever he needs.

372
00:19:06,411 --> 00:19:08,279
Deib, you can't watch
your big brother 24/7,

373
00:19:08,413 --> 00:19:10,015
especially
he's starting his therapy.

374
00:19:10,615 --> 00:19:13,317
Dale,
while you still can't walk,

375
00:19:13,451 --> 00:19:15,854
you'll stay here
on the first floor.

376
00:19:16,721 --> 00:19:18,457
So I'll be down here forever.

377
00:19:19,758 --> 00:19:21,460
-Dale...
-Bro.

378
00:19:21,859 --> 00:19:23,461
Don't talk like that.
You're gonna get well.

379
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:24,630
You're gonna get strong,
you're gonna walk,

380
00:19:24,762 --> 00:19:26,498
You're gonna run everywhere.
I know it.

381
00:19:26,632 --> 00:19:28,366
[Deib]
Exactly, you'll walk soon!

382
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,701
And when we play basketball,
you won't let me score.

383
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:31,103
I know that!

384
00:19:31,236 --> 00:19:32,436
[laughter]

385
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:34,006
-Thank you!
-I know that.

386
00:19:34,138 --> 00:19:34,972
Thanks, Dad.

387
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:38,809
I don't think
I'll be able to walk again, bro.

388
00:19:41,078 --> 00:19:42,513
Hey, don't say that.

389
00:19:43,248 --> 00:19:44,883
Bro, we're not giving up, okay?

390
00:19:46,384 --> 00:19:48,119
I heard the doctors
talking yesterday.

391
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,223
The other bullet
affected my spine.

392
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:57,095
They said the chances of me
walking again aren't zero but...

393
00:19:58,029 --> 00:19:58,931
pretty low.

394
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,701
[Deib] Bro,
you have the best therapists.

395
00:20:04,001 --> 00:20:06,238
You'll walk again,
I'm sure of it.

396
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:08,006
[Deib] You're an athlete!

397
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,241
A much better athlete than me.

398
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:13,612
You won a championship match
with a torn ACL!

399
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:16,114
If that's me,

400
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,517
I wouldn't even be able
to play at all.

401
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:19,984
[exhales]

402
00:20:20,117 --> 00:20:21,118
That's true, but...

403
00:20:21,752 --> 00:20:24,489
I'm going to try to walk again,
Deib.

404
00:20:25,022 --> 00:20:26,424
But it's not gonna be
the end of the world

405
00:20:26,557 --> 00:20:28,794
if I'm stuck in this
wheelchair forever.

406
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:31,096
[Dale]
Yes, it's gonna suck but...

407
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,632
-at least I'm alive.
-Bro...

408
00:20:33,765 --> 00:20:37,001
I'll do whatever it takes
to make sure you walk again.

409
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:40,204
Okay.

410
00:20:40,505 --> 00:20:41,873
Now, some real talk.

411
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,242
[Dale] Don't be afraid
to hurt my feelings.

412
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:48,846
How did you feel when you
learned about Max's uncle?

413
00:20:51,415 --> 00:20:52,017
Hurt.

414
00:20:55,854 --> 00:20:56,821
Angry.

415
00:20:58,390 --> 00:20:59,490
Confused.

416
00:21:00,892 --> 00:21:04,997
Part of me feels like
it's this universe's way of...

417
00:21:06,064 --> 00:21:06,999
making me pay...

418
00:21:08,634 --> 00:21:09,901
for all the bad things
I've done.

419
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:13,137
How are you and Max?

420
00:21:16,407 --> 00:21:17,675
I don't know. We're not talking.

421
00:21:18,644 --> 00:21:21,445
She keeps insisting
that she's not lying,

422
00:21:22,413 --> 00:21:24,148
that Uncle Boyet is innocent.

423
00:21:26,718 --> 00:21:29,121
Bro, I want to believe her.
I really do...

424
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:31,722
but it's hard.

425
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,127
So you don't believe her?

426
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:40,798
I don't know
what to believe anymore...

427
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:43,969
I don't know
what I want to believe.

428
00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:48,205
All I know is I wanna find...

429
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:50,174
the person who hurt you.

430
00:21:52,376 --> 00:21:53,744
What if that's Uncle Boyet?

431
00:21:55,413 --> 00:21:58,150
[suspenseful music playing]

432
00:22:02,453 --> 00:22:04,221
[suspenseful music continues]

433
00:22:10,461 --> 00:22:13,030
[reporter on TV] The police are
looking for the suspected gunman

434
00:22:13,164 --> 00:22:17,969
in the carnapping incident
where a young man ended up shot.

435
00:22:18,103 --> 00:22:20,739
A certain Christopher Santos,
alias Boyet,

436
00:22:20,872 --> 00:22:23,075
is wanted by the police.

437
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:28,012
A reward of 50,000 pesos
will be given to anyone

438
00:22:28,145 --> 00:22:31,717
who can give information
that will lead to his capture.

439
00:22:31,849 --> 00:22:33,984
Mico Biagan, reporting.

440
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:42,059
[tense music playing]

441
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:46,263
Here, try it!

442
00:22:47,231 --> 00:22:48,266
Thank you!

443
00:22:51,236 --> 00:22:52,804
So? How is it? Delicious?

444
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:53,571
It's yummy!

445
00:22:55,973 --> 00:22:56,641
Michiko,

446
00:22:57,776 --> 00:22:59,911
when have you ever baked
anything that isn't delicious?

447
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:00,679
Aww!

448
00:23:01,579 --> 00:23:02,681
[Nurse M] It's delicious, ma'am.

449
00:23:03,515 --> 00:23:04,982
Relieves stress.

450
00:23:05,349 --> 00:23:06,250
-Looks like it!
-[phone pings]

451
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:07,318
Thank you.

452
00:23:07,853 --> 00:23:09,253
[Lorde] It's really yummy!

453
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:13,090
[Lorde] Good thing Dale woke up.
Please visit often, Michiko!

454
00:23:13,224 --> 00:23:13,924
You okay?

455
00:23:14,792 --> 00:23:17,162
It's Max.
She's asking how Deib is.

456
00:23:18,395 --> 00:23:19,564
How is he?

457
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:22,200
Still confused.

458
00:23:23,367 --> 00:23:24,669
He's going through a lot.

459
00:23:25,569 --> 00:23:26,704
The whole family is.

460
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:29,907
Max is worried about him.

461
00:23:30,842 --> 00:23:33,310
Their situation isn't easy.

462
00:23:33,845 --> 00:23:35,780
You two should just
enjoy your situation!

463
00:23:36,314 --> 00:23:37,082
What are you anyway?

464
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,151
-Friends.
-Batchmates.

465
00:23:40,451 --> 00:23:41,219
[Lorde] Master Big Bro,

466
00:23:42,186 --> 00:23:44,189
how did you
and Michiko become "friends"?

467
00:23:45,022 --> 00:23:45,891
How else?

468
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:47,592
She has a crush on me!

469
00:23:48,393 --> 00:23:51,829
What?! Maybe you're the one
with a crush on me!

470
00:23:51,962 --> 00:23:53,832
[Dale] Actually, Lorde,

471
00:23:53,964 --> 00:23:57,269
Michiko was there for me
when Dom ghosted me.

472
00:23:57,402 --> 00:23:58,002
What?!

473
00:23:58,936 --> 00:24:02,073
Someone as handsome
and cool like you got ghosted?

474
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:03,642
[claps] I got it!

475
00:24:04,241 --> 00:24:07,412
[Lorde] When Dom ghosted you,
you needed a shoulder to cry on

476
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:09,079
and it was Michiko!

477
00:24:09,213 --> 00:24:11,817
Michiko, your courting style's
impressive - comflirting!

478
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:15,487
-I wasn't courting him, Lorde!
-[laughter]

479
00:24:15,619 --> 00:24:17,255
And there was no comflirting
whatsoever!

480
00:24:18,323 --> 00:24:19,557
Really?

481
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:22,727
Don't toot your own horn,
Dale Enrile!

482
00:24:22,861 --> 00:24:25,196
[Michiko] Tell them
how we really became friends!

483
00:24:25,963 --> 00:24:26,364
Okay...

484
00:24:28,066 --> 00:24:28,834
You tell them.

485
00:24:29,667 --> 00:24:32,002
[Lorde] You tell it, Michiko!
Don't want Dale to get tired.

486
00:24:33,637 --> 00:24:34,271
Okay.

487
00:24:35,507 --> 00:24:37,808
It's like he said:
Dom ghosted him.

488
00:24:38,242 --> 00:24:41,078
[Michiko] We were groupmates
for a project at the time.

489
00:24:41,212 --> 00:24:43,480
He noticed I was having
a hard time at school,

490
00:24:43,615 --> 00:24:45,650
so he offered to be my tutor.

491
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:46,718
What?

492
00:24:47,352 --> 00:24:49,253
You volunteered
to be her tutor for free, sir?

493
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:52,557
Sir,
you were the one comflirting!

494
00:24:52,691 --> 00:24:53,791
[laughter]

495
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:58,930
He didn't ask for payment, but
he made me bake his cravings.

496
00:24:59,597 --> 00:25:00,999
[Lorde] Ouchie!

497
00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:04,402
The ants have come to bite!

498
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:05,804
Because you guys are so sweet!

499
00:25:07,739 --> 00:25:08,673
Master Big Bro Dale,

500
00:25:09,473 --> 00:25:10,342
I'm curious...

501
00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:12,644
What if you didn't get shot
that night?

502
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:14,679
What would you have done
the next day?

503
00:25:17,582 --> 00:25:21,086
I actually had a plan for what
I wanted to do the next day.

504
00:25:21,219 --> 00:25:21,886
Really?

505
00:25:22,453 --> 00:25:23,153
Mhmm!

506
00:25:23,654 --> 00:25:24,788
You remember, sir?

507
00:25:25,222 --> 00:25:25,957
Of course!

508
00:25:26,557 --> 00:25:27,858
[Nurse M]
What was your plan, sir?

509
00:25:29,594 --> 00:25:30,261
Well...

510
00:25:34,566 --> 00:25:37,234
I was going to ask Michiko
to be my date to the ball.

511
00:25:37,368 --> 00:25:39,503
-[Lorde] Aww!
-[romantic music playing]

512
00:25:39,637 --> 00:25:41,740
Is that so?

513
00:25:43,775 --> 00:25:44,675
Promise.

514
00:25:47,444 --> 00:25:48,346
Why me?

515
00:25:48,779 --> 00:25:51,148
You could've taken anyone
to the ball.

516
00:25:52,284 --> 00:25:53,351
Maybe. But...

517
00:25:54,184 --> 00:25:55,787
there's no one else
I would wanna ask.

518
00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:59,924
I couldn't imagine myself taking
anyone else to be my date...

519
00:26:00,325 --> 00:26:01,326
but you.

520
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:04,328
[Lorde]
Dang, even the ants swooned!

521
00:26:04,996 --> 00:26:09,267
Master, the ants will suck up
all my blood at this rate!

522
00:26:09,934 --> 00:26:10,835
Michiko,
what if he was able to ask that,

523
00:26:10,969 --> 00:26:12,304
what would you have said?

524
00:26:13,137 --> 00:26:16,740
[Lorde imitating
heartbeat sound]

525
00:26:17,474 --> 00:26:18,309
Yes.

526
00:26:18,442 --> 00:26:20,711
[Nurse M and Lorde exclaim]

527
00:26:20,845 --> 00:26:23,013

[Lorde claps]

529

[Lorde] You're my ship now!

530

Dale + Michiko = Dako!
My DaKo ship is sailing!

[Lorde laughing]

532
00:26:31,288 --> 00:26:32,156
I see it!

533
00:26:32,289 --> 00:26:33,391
[chuckles]

534
00:26:41,365 --> 00:26:44,035
Master, your nurse
is a bit of a gossip, huh?

535
00:26:44,169 --> 00:26:45,769
[laughter]

536
00:26:56,914 --> 00:26:58,717
Mine, why are you so chill?

537
00:26:59,384 --> 00:27:02,721
I feel like a nuclear war is
brewing between our friends!

538
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:05,155
This might really be
the end for them!

539
00:27:05,824 --> 00:27:07,959
I'm scared that
if they break up,

540
00:27:08,593 --> 00:27:10,795
they won't just
unfollow each other online.

541
00:27:11,328 --> 00:27:13,397
Our group might unfriend
each other in real life!

542
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:17,102
Mine,

543
00:27:18,336 --> 00:27:19,069
It's their business.

544
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:22,039
We can't do anything for them.

545
00:27:22,874 --> 00:27:24,576
We should just
give them some privacy.

546
00:27:25,076 --> 00:27:26,845
Deib will ask for my help
if he needs it.

547
00:27:27,244 --> 00:27:28,046
Mine,

548
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:30,347
Let's think of a way
to help them!

You can do
your artsy-fartsy stuff later.

550

This is not just
artsy fartsy to me, Mine.

551
00:27:37,188 --> 00:27:39,423
No, no!
I didn't mean it like that...

552
00:27:42,493 --> 00:27:43,294
Sorry, Mine.

553
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:46,931
It's alright.

00:28:05,717 --> 00:28:07,085
What do you want, Mine?

558
00:28:07,719 --> 00:28:09,220
When I speak, I'm wrong.

559
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:11,122
When I don't speak,
I'm still wrong.

560
00:28:13,057 --> 00:28:14,526
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

561
00:28:16,394 --> 00:28:18,395
I don't know why we keep saying
the wrong thing today.

562
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:20,898
I just think
that we shouldn't make

563
00:28:21,031 --> 00:28:22,834
other people's problems our own.

564
00:28:26,104 --> 00:28:27,337
Tell me the truth,

565
00:28:28,006 --> 00:28:29,574
do you think I'm a meddler?

566
00:28:30,775 --> 00:28:31,843
No, no.

567
00:28:33,344 --> 00:28:35,946
Since the beginning, I've loved
how concerned you are

568
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,382
about your friends.

569
00:28:37,981 --> 00:28:39,584
I just wish you had some...

570
00:28:40,785 --> 00:28:41,920
boundaries.

571
00:28:46,423 --> 00:28:47,925
So you're getting irritated
by the very thing

572
00:28:48,058 --> 00:28:49,426
that you liked about me
in the beginning?

573
00:28:52,262 --> 00:28:55,133
[Naih] Mine, I heard that's one
of the factors of divorce!

574
00:28:56,300 --> 00:29:00,038
Opposites have strong chemistry
so they only realize much later

575
00:29:00,171 --> 00:29:01,605
that they're not compatible.

576
00:29:03,942 --> 00:29:06,044
[Naih]
We are compatible, right, Mine?

577
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,646
Of course.

578
00:29:11,215 --> 00:29:12,584
We were made for each other,
Mine.

00:29:19,089 --> 00:29:20,258

Good morning, sir.

What's with the frown?
Aren't you happy?

00:29:46,651 --> 00:29:47,085
Huh?

588
00:29:47,684 --> 00:29:50,188
I mean, Deib and Max
are not on good terms

589
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:53,357
and we finally have a chance
to get them back--

590
00:29:54,291 --> 00:29:57,461
Why would I be happy when I see
that Max is miserable?

591
00:29:58,462 --> 00:29:59,596
You're too nice.

592
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:00,798
You're never nice.

593
00:30:00,932 --> 00:30:02,333
I am nice.

You're not always the one
who's good and right here!

596
00:30:07,939 --> 00:30:12,309
You're actually really weird
for siding with a liar like Max!

00:30:12,876 --> 00:30:14,311
Max isn't a liar.

We got a tip.

00:31:24,348 --> 00:31:26,084
Boyet's been spotted
at Buenavista.

627
00:31:26,851 --> 00:31:29,253
[Attorney] But he was too quick,
the police couldn't follow him.

628
00:31:30,387 --> 00:31:33,758
Kim's grandfather is the
congressman of Buenavista,

00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:34,491
right, Deib?

630
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:37,494
[Daniel] I should ask
for his help. Deib--

631
00:31:37,628 --> 00:31:39,364
-Dad.
-Get in touch with Kim.

632
00:31:39,497 --> 00:31:41,432
Ask her for her
grandpa's contact details

so I can setup a meeting.

634
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:45,737
The local government there
can issue a manhunt.

00:31:45,869 --> 00:31:48,105
That would be the fastest way
to catch Boyet--

Are you sure
you want to do this?

00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:53,711
Why not?

[tense music playing]

This might just be used
for political gain.

And taking such extreme measures
might spin the case

00:32:02,787 --> 00:32:04,422
to make Uncle Boyet
look guilty immediately.

that Boyet is innocent?!

00:32:09,961 --> 00:32:12,931
Are you siding with
your girlfriend's family

instead of your own?

648
00:32:14,932 --> 00:32:15,799

649
00:32:15,932 --> 00:32:18,001

sounds like that, Deib!

I'm sure he wants justice
for me just as much as you do.

if you still don't believe
that Boyet shot Dale,

662
00:32:47,464 --> 00:32:48,598
you should listen to this.

[Max] Okay...

702
00:34:25,797 --> 00:34:28,498

something I don't have?!

It's impossible
that you don't know, Max!

-Where--
-I don't know!

You can pry
my brain out of my skull

be able to tell you!

00:34:51,922 --> 00:34:53,791
when Uncle Boyet escaped,
you knew!

715
00:34:54,458 --> 00:34:55,126
You knew!

716
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:56,927
[Deib]
That's why we left, right?

717
00:34:57,427 --> 00:34:59,797
So I wouldn't find out that
you were helping him escape--

718
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:00,664
No!

719
00:35:01,032 --> 00:35:01,766
No!

720
00:35:01,898 --> 00:35:04,101
I wanted you to know
what happened

721
00:35:04,235 --> 00:35:05,369
the night Dale got shot!

722
00:35:05,936 --> 00:35:07,704
I wanted to tell you
that Uncle Boyet

723
00:35:07,838 --> 00:35:09,907
was going to the police
as a witness--

724
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:11,208
-Witness?
-Yes!

725
00:35:11,708 --> 00:35:12,844
He's the one
who shot my brother!

726
00:35:12,976 --> 00:35:13,911
You're wrong!

727
00:35:14,045 --> 00:35:16,847
Max, he went to the police
with a fake story

728
00:35:16,981 --> 00:35:17,380
to save himself!

729
00:35:17,514 --> 00:35:19,182
You are so wrong!

730
00:35:19,317 --> 00:35:21,786
If his carnapping associate
didn't say anything,

731
00:35:21,918 --> 00:35:25,289
we never would've found out
the truth about everything!

732
00:35:25,422 --> 00:35:26,590
Are you serious?!

733
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:29,494
Tiago is lying!

734
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,695
Why don't you believe me?!

735
00:35:31,829 --> 00:35:33,998
Why don't you believe
Uncle Boyet?!

736
00:35:38,202 --> 00:35:40,438
[Tiago on recording] Screw you,
Boyet! You ran from us again?!

737
00:35:41,105 --> 00:35:42,239
[Boyet on recording]
Tiago, listen.

738
00:35:42,373 --> 00:35:52,349
The guy we shot is the brother
of my niece's boyfriend.

739
00:35:55,085 --> 00:35:56,853
[Deib] That's
Uncle Boyet's voice, right?

740
00:35:58,255 --> 00:35:59,157
Max...

741
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:03,594
My dad wants a manhunt
for Uncle Boyet.

742
00:36:04,394 --> 00:36:05,663
[Deib] Okay? Do you understand?

743
00:36:05,795 --> 00:36:07,965
I don't want anything bad
or dangerous to happen to him.

744
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:09,800
I don't want you to get hurt.

745
00:36:10,333 --> 00:36:11,268
[Deib] So please...

746
00:36:12,135 --> 00:36:13,204
[Deib] Just tell me.

747
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:16,773
I will ask you one last time.
Please...

748
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,577
Tell me where he is.

749
00:36:23,447 --> 00:36:25,215
Uncle Boyet is innocent.

750
00:36:25,882 --> 00:36:27,418
[Deib] If he's really innocent,

751
00:36:28,018 --> 00:36:29,786
then he shouldn't be afraid
to surrender to the police.

752
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:35,960
Uncle Boyet is innocent.

753
00:36:38,461 --> 00:36:40,231
He didn't shoot your brother.

754
00:36:42,465 --> 00:36:44,268
And I don't know where he is.

755
00:36:46,304 --> 00:36:48,306
[dramatic music swelling]

756
00:36:49,407 --> 00:36:50,141
[Michiko] Max!

757
00:36:50,574 --> 00:36:51,041
[Naih] Max!

758
00:36:59,416 --> 00:37:01,452
[Deib on video]
If his carnapping associate

759
00:37:01,585 --> 00:37:03,853
didn't say anything,

760
00:37:04,422 --> 00:37:05,389
we never would've
found out the truth!

761
00:37:05,523 --> 00:37:07,592
He's acting like a bully again,
Max!

762
00:37:07,992 --> 00:37:09,492
[Zell]
Are you sure you're okay?

763
00:37:10,193 --> 00:37:12,396
[Max on video] Why do you
believe the carnapper more?

764
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:13,764
Hi, Dad!

765
00:37:14,297 --> 00:37:17,168
Do you have good news
that can make Max feel better?

766
00:37:17,768 --> 00:37:19,670
Uncle Randy,
did you find evidence

767
00:37:19,804 --> 00:37:22,340
that can prove
Uncle Boyet's innocence?

768
00:37:23,673 --> 00:37:27,010
No. I got a video,

769
00:37:27,612 --> 00:37:29,813
but it wouldn't help
Boyet's case...

770
00:37:30,715 --> 00:37:32,282
[Tiago on video]
Boyet came to me,

771
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:36,420
said he needed someone
to join Siko-Siko with.

772
00:37:37,153 --> 00:37:39,657
I was surprised
that he got involved

773
00:37:39,789 --> 00:37:40,958
with that kind of group.

774
00:37:41,692 --> 00:37:43,427
When we were kids...

775
00:37:44,027 --> 00:37:46,396
he avoided
any kind of shady stuff.

776
00:37:47,565 --> 00:37:51,936
But I needed money
for my kid's hospital bills,

777
00:37:52,902 --> 00:37:55,106
so I had no choice
but to join the carnapping.

778
00:37:55,739 --> 00:37:57,275
[loud bang]

779
00:37:57,407 --> 00:38:00,177
What happened when Dale Enrile
was shot in front of Club Zero?

780
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:04,148
Our plan was just to carnap,

781
00:38:04,815 --> 00:38:06,349
so we were all shocked

782
00:38:07,018 --> 00:38:10,054
when Boyet shot the guy.

783
00:38:11,088 --> 00:38:12,722
[Tiago] I tried to stop him,

784
00:38:12,856 --> 00:38:15,126
but he didn't listen.

785
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:16,893
He wanted to kill the guy.

786
00:38:17,427 --> 00:38:18,896
After he shot him,

787
00:38:19,597 --> 00:38:20,764
we all ran away,

788
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:24,201
but Boyet came back
and made sure he was dead.

789
00:38:24,902 --> 00:38:27,271
I tried to stop him again,
but he didn't listen.

790
00:38:27,637 --> 00:38:28,838
He wanted to kill the guy.

791
00:38:29,873 --> 00:38:31,942
Boyet was high on drugs
that night.

792
00:38:33,277 --> 00:38:35,880
[deep breath]

793
00:38:36,914 --> 00:38:37,981
You okay, Max?

794
00:38:38,648 --> 00:38:41,719
[Randy] Tiago embellished and
lied throughout his story.

795
00:38:42,353 --> 00:38:46,222
I think the Enriles and
their lawyer saw this already.

796
00:38:49,793 --> 00:38:51,862
Max, are you okay?

797
00:38:52,762 --> 00:38:54,297
RJ, can you come with me?

798
00:38:59,036 --> 00:39:02,005
I just spoke
with Congressman Araneta

799
00:39:02,572 --> 00:39:05,443
and he's more than willing
to find that killer Boyet.

800
00:39:06,777 --> 00:39:08,445
And he asked about you, Deib.

801
00:39:09,512 --> 00:39:11,882
[Daniel] He wondered why
you didn't come to him yourself

802
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,516
regarding our situation.

803
00:39:14,552 --> 00:39:17,554
But anyway, the provincial
government and the local police

804
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:19,322
have been mobilized
to track him down.

805
00:39:20,458 --> 00:39:21,224
Dad...

806
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:24,829
something might happen
to Uncle Boyet.

807
00:39:26,163 --> 00:39:29,032
I don't give a damn what happens
to him and neither should you.

808
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:33,269
Did Boyet think about our family
when he shot Dale

809
00:39:33,403 --> 00:39:34,204
and left him for dead?

810
00:39:34,338 --> 00:39:35,206
I don't think so.

811
00:39:36,507 --> 00:39:37,141
[Deib] I just...

812
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:40,443
I just don't want things
to get worse, Dad.

813
00:39:43,481 --> 00:39:45,615
You know what's worse?

814
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:48,918
Not catching Boyet
and more people getting hurt

815
00:39:49,052 --> 00:39:50,554
or dying because of him.

816
00:39:50,688 --> 00:39:51,789
That would be worse!

817
00:39:51,922 --> 00:39:53,523
[tense music playing]

818
00:39:53,657 --> 00:39:55,925
I'm going to invite
Congressman Araneta and Kim

819
00:39:56,059 --> 00:39:57,360
to lunch or dinner

820
00:39:57,494 --> 00:40:00,231
to thank them for all
they're doing for this family.

821
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:02,298
In fact...

822
00:40:03,367 --> 00:40:06,070
Congressman Araneta
even pledged his own money

823
00:40:06,202 --> 00:40:08,539
to raise the bounty for Boyet.

824
00:40:09,539 --> 00:40:10,541
Really, Dad?

825
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:13,443
Yes, the amount
is now five million pesos.

826
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:17,882
That kind of money will motivate
people to keep their eyes open

827
00:40:18,014 --> 00:40:21,251
and come forward
with any information on Boyet.

828
00:40:22,452 --> 00:40:25,054
I believe Boyet's own family
and friends

829
00:40:25,188 --> 00:40:31,829
will do anything to get
their hands on that money.

830
00:40:35,699 --> 00:40:36,900
[policeman 1] Hey, man!

831
00:40:37,034 --> 00:40:37,735
-[tricycle driver] Sir!
-Can I ask you a question?

832
00:40:37,867 --> 00:40:38,369
[tricycle driver]
Of course, sir!

833
00:40:39,302 --> 00:40:40,471
[policeman 1]
Do you recognize this man?

834
00:40:40,804 --> 00:40:41,605
[policeman 2] Boyet Santos!

835
00:40:41,739 --> 00:40:42,405
[suspenseful music playing]

836
00:40:42,539 --> 00:40:43,641
[tricycle driver]
Not really, sir.

837
00:40:43,773 --> 00:40:45,576
[tricycle driver]
I've had lots of passengers...

838
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:49,280

839
00:40:49,612 --> 00:40:52,483
[tense music playing]

840

-[policeman 1] Hey!
-[policeman 2] You!

841
00:40:59,923 --> 00:41:00,490
[policeman 1] Sir!

842
00:41:10,434 --> 00:41:11,101
[RJ] Max!

843
00:41:12,969 --> 00:41:13,503
Yes?

844
00:41:14,103 --> 00:41:15,206
What happened?

845
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:18,608
The reward
for Uncle Boyet's manhunt

846
00:41:18,742 --> 00:41:21,077
has been raised to five million.

847
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:24,181
He's now in the priority list.

848
00:41:25,782 --> 00:41:26,550
[exhales sharply]

849
00:41:29,286 --> 00:41:30,186

[wailing]

856
00:41:53,077 --> 00:41:54,644
I can't do this anymore!

I'm tired...

Max...

RJ...

[Max crying]

870
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:01,110
What's this?!

871
00:43:05,949 --> 00:43:06,817
You brought him here?

872
00:43:08,385 --> 00:43:09,652
This is our place!

873
00:43:10,186 --> 00:43:11,487
I needed to scream,

874
00:43:12,822 --> 00:43:14,358
to let it all out.

875
00:43:15,858 --> 00:43:17,260
Why do you keep going to him?

876
00:43:17,393 --> 00:43:18,795
He's your ex!
I'm your boyfriend!

877
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:21,398
Because!

878
00:43:22,865 --> 00:43:24,134
[Max] Because I don't know!

879
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:25,302
Tell me what to do!

880
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:28,304
You're the one
I wanna talk to...

881
00:43:28,771 --> 00:43:30,740
but I don't know how.

882
00:43:31,574 --> 00:43:33,177
[Max] I can't approach you!

883
00:43:33,911 --> 00:43:35,679
Whenever I talk to you,

884
00:43:36,413 --> 00:43:39,449
you feel like I'm lying. So how?

885
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:44,688
Deib, I'm so tired.

886
00:43:46,956 --> 00:43:48,324
It hurts so much!

887
00:43:50,226 --> 00:43:51,295
I'm tired.

888
00:43:54,664 --> 00:43:56,634
I don't even know
if we're still together.

889
00:43:58,034 --> 00:43:59,235
[Max] Are we?

890
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:00,938
Are we still together?

891
00:44:03,039 --> 00:44:04,675
Why are you asking that, Max?

892
00:44:06,909 --> 00:44:07,844
Are you breaking up with me?

893
00:44:08,911 --> 00:44:12,583
["Did I Let You Go"
by Jon Guelas playing]

894
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:52,289
[Johann]
Sometimes, artists need

895
00:44:52,422 --> 00:44:54,391
to really spend time
with each other.

896
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:57,094
[Johann] Sometimes, even falling
in love with each other.

897
00:44:57,226 --> 00:44:58,728
Break off with that girl.

898
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:00,364
Stop seeing that family.

899
00:45:00,496 --> 00:45:03,634
[Daniel] No phone calls,
no texts. End it.

900
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:05,436
Are you still seeing Deib?

901
00:45:06,369 --> 00:45:07,804
Max, I think it's safer

902
00:45:07,938 --> 00:45:10,074
if you don't get involved
with each other

903
00:45:10,206 --> 00:45:11,407
until the case is over.

904
00:45:11,942 --> 00:45:12,842
What is it?

905
00:45:12,976 --> 00:45:14,510
The head coach
of Stella Orientis University

906
00:45:14,644 --> 00:45:18,047
just invited me to special
tryouts for the varsity team.

907
00:45:18,181 --> 00:45:20,617
[Max]
We don't lie to each other,

908
00:45:20,751 --> 00:45:23,686
but we also can't tell each
other how we honestly feel.

909
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:25,755
Is it only a matter of time
before we break up?
