But I've become fond of you

Even better.

If he played in the championship,

00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:18,284
Master Deib is the kindest!

185
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:21,120
He even helped a blind person
to the elevator earlier!

186
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:23,664
He's so faithful, as straight
as they come! Sir--

187
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:24,790
[Deib] Lorde, stop!

188
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:26,751
Mr. Luna, it's not--

189
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:28,419
Kim, shut up.

190
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:30,421
Deib, I'm just trying to help--

191
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:31,756
Just shut up!

192
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:33,132
Mr. Enrile,

193
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:35,384
I'll talk to you in private.

194
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:48,773
Do you know why I don't
like you for my daughter?

195
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:54,987
Because I bullied her, sir.

196
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,284
But sir, I've changed.

197
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:02,787
I know I was wrong--

198
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,039
But the way you talked to Kim?

199
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:08,376
And the way you treat Lorde,

200
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,128
like he's your servant?

201
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:15,800
I don't think
you've changed that much,

202
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:17,968
Mr. Enrile.

203
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:23,808
You're right.

204
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:28,354
Thank you.

205
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,316
Thank you for pointing that out.

206
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:40,241
I see now that I still do things

207
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:44,662
that show that I haven't
really changed that much.

208
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:49,291
I'm sorry.

209
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:53,462
I'm really sorry, sir.

210
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,135
I promise to try to do better, sir.

211
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:05,182
Because your daughter
deserves a better man.

212
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:13,566
Sorry, sir, I just left something!

213
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:14,900
All set?

214
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:15,985
-Oh!
-[shoulder hitting face]

215
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:16,652
[thud]

216
00:12:16,735 --> 00:12:17,153
Ah!

217
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:18,320
Sorry! Sorry, Ysay!

218
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:19,530
No, no, it's okay.

219
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:20,865
-Wait.
-It's okay.

220
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:21,949
I'll help you.

221
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:23,033
Oh!

222
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:25,786
Lee?

223
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:26,412
It's fine.

224
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,288
Sorry.

225
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:28,831
-[Ysay] Are you okay?
-[Lee] It's fine, it's fine.

226
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:31,333
Sorry.

227
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:34,920
Okay! Sorry about that.

228
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:36,046
[clears throat]

229
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:38,799
Can we start now, Sir Johann?

230
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:39,550
Game.

231
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:40,134
Uh...

232
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:41,385
But call me Johann.

233
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:42,845
Don't make me feel old, guys.

234
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:45,514
[awkward chuckle]

235
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:46,599
Okay, Johann.

236
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:48,017
Sure.

237
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:48,642
Uhm...

238
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:50,561
Did you always want to be an artist?

239
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:53,355
Ever since you were young?

240
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:57,526
I never really wanted to be an artist.

241
00:12:57,776 --> 00:13:00,446
But I guess I believed that I was.

242
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:01,864
I am, I mean.

243
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:04,492
Wish we all had that confidence!

244
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:06,619
But if I were as talented as you,

245
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:09,079
I'd be confident, too.

246
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:12,374
Ysay, you're brilliant, too.

247
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,168
You just need to believe in yourself.

248
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:16,045
Aw, thanks Lee!

249
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:17,546
[Johann clears throat]

250
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:20,841
Anyway, when you were in Benison,

251
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:23,511
were you given a lot of
opportunities to be an artist?

252
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:25,471
Most of the art I did in high school

253
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:26,889
was for my first girlfriend.

254
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:29,099
That's so romantic!

255
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:31,101
She was a great first love.

256
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:33,771
But we couldn't be more different.

257
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:37,399
I mean, she's a chatterbox, I'm quiet.

258
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,527
She's cheerful, I'm emo.

259
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:41,820
She loved to party, I didn't.

260
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:43,697
But she made me laugh.

261
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:45,282
That's why I fell in love with her.

262
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:49,119
Our differences
made our love more exciting,

263
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:52,456
but it wasn't really enough
to sustain the relationship.

264
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:54,583
We really didn't have much in common.

265
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:58,546
So we broke up after graduation.

266
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:00,005
Ah.

267
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:01,131
But...

268
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,841
not all first loves have to end!

269
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:05,386
Who knows? Maybe yours will last.

270
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:06,804
You seem to have a lot of common.

271
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:07,888
Art being one of them.

272
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:12,142
-Ah, no. We're not a--
-We're not together,

273
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:13,686
he's with Naih--

274
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:14,979
Yeah.

275
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:18,107
-Oh, okay! Sorry.
-[Ysay] I'm not his...

276
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,984
-...girlfriend.
-Yeah, I thought you...

277
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:23,529
Yearbook!

278
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:24,530
Almost forgot!

279
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:30,327
[Ysay] So...

280
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:34,206
We found in our research that
your first commissioned work

281
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,125
was this mural in Benison.

282
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:37,918
Who had it made?

283
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:39,461
My classmate.

284
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:43,340
It was for the girl
he was in love with.

285
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:46,135
I had to stay in school
to finish this.

286
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:47,303
Overnight, mind you.

287
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:48,804
Good thing I wasn't caught.

288
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:52,474
Wow! So you weren't punished

289
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,560
for vandalizing school property?

290
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:57,479
People eventually figured out
that I did it,

291
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:00,316
and there was a formal inquiry

292
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:02,818
in front of the whole student body

293
00:15:02,901 --> 00:15:04,862
and the disciplinary committee,

294
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:08,073
but JP Quisumbing defended me.

295
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:12,578
-Headmaster?
-Our new headmaster?

296
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:13,829
Headmaster, we heard you were

297
00:15:13,912 --> 00:15:15,372
the prom king at your senior ball

298
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:18,083
and you were voted
most crushable cutie!

299
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:22,671
Plus, you were the first ever
Benison Brave awardee!

300
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:23,589
Stop me!

301
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:25,507
You got me on fangirl mode!

302
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:29,386
Thanks, I guess, for reading
my batch's yearbook.

303
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,137
But...

304
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:31,972
What is your question?

305
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:33,599
Here it goes, Headmaster:

306
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:36,352
has anyone called dibs
on your heart?

307
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:38,395
Who is she? She's so lucky!

308
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:40,606
-Oh-em, Squammy! Why are you asking that?
-Naih!

309
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:43,442
Headmaster,
Naih's just kidding!

310
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:45,736
Don't deny it, you two!

311
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:48,989
You also wanna hear his answer--

312
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:51,575
Sorry, Headmaster.
She lacks a filter.

313
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:53,160
And good breeding.

314
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:55,287
"Good breeding
consists in concealing

315
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:56,705
how much we think of ourselves

316
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,540
and how little
we think of the other person."

317
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:00,000
Oh my God, period!

318
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:03,045
That was in English, but I got that!

319
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:05,964
Can you say it again,
Headmaster?

320
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:08,384
So I can tweet
your quotable quote?

321
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:11,553
Those were Mark Twain's
words, not mine.

322
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:13,263
Burn.

323
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:15,391
Look, you kids don't seem to get

324
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,809
the point of this exercise.

325
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:19,561
We study history to gain perspective.

326
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:22,690
You're doing these interviews
to learn from our mistakes

327
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:24,608
and to be inspired by our stories.

328
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,319
So please, come back to me
when you have questions

329
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:29,154
that don't read like clickbait titles

330
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:30,656
for a gossip vlog.

331
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:31,699
[all] But headmaster--

332
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:32,658
[knocking on door]

333
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:35,202
Hey, Jayps!

334
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:37,996
Hi, Macy!

335
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:40,290
I'll wait for you to finish.

336
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,960
Oh my God!

337
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:44,878
Isn't that Elle's mom?

338
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:45,754
That's her, right?

339
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:46,588
Yes!

340
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:48,465
I don't know, Jayps.

341
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:51,301
It sounds like too much work.
I can't do it.

342
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:52,928
Come on, Macy!

343
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:54,972
You're the best person
to represent our batch

344
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:56,140
and help the current seniors

345
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:57,808
organize the homecoming events.

346
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:59,393
[school bell ringing]

347
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:00,310
JP,

348
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:02,271
I'd gladly help if my daughter

349
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:03,814
were still studying in this school.

350
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:05,107
Look, Mace.

351
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,191
I've been talking to the board

352
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:07,526
about your daughter's case.

353
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:09,486
I think we can get a formal inquiry

354
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,447
to look into
your daughter's expulsion.

355
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:14,700
Thank you!

356
00:17:15,033 --> 00:17:16,952
Best news
I've heard in weeks!

357
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:19,246
You really are the best!
Thank you!

358
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:20,956
I'm the best, and yet,

359
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:22,916
I didn't end up with the best girl.

360
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:26,920
You're still the best smooth talker.

361
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:28,047
[Headmaster laughs]

362
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,214
Thank you.

363
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:37,890
[Headmaster]
Everything okay?

364
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:39,433
Yeah.

365
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,518
Come, convince me some more.

366
00:17:46,064 --> 00:17:47,858
Thanks for helping us, Elle.

367
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:50,444
Migz?

368
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:51,069
Yes?

369
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:53,322
Can you please lead the interview?

370
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:56,992
Mom is still pissed off
with Max and Khloe

371
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,494
because of my expulsion.

372
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:00,245
[footsteps approaching]

373
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,123
-[Migz] Hi, Ma'am!
-[Elle] Mom!

374
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:04,792
-[Migz] Miss Macy.
-[Elle] Mom.

375
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:05,751
Hello, Aunt Macy.

376
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:07,211
Mom, you can sit here.

377
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:11,590
Good afternoon.

378
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:12,382
Afternoon, Ma'am!

379
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:16,553
Okay! Mrs. Luna,
thank you for doing this.

380
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:17,471
Let's start!

381
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:18,388
Okay then!

382
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:21,725
So, first question: what do you think

383
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:25,103
was the best thing
about studying in Benison?

384
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,649
Aside from the education
that I got?

385
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:31,985
I was able to make lifelong
friends from Benison,

386
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:34,947
like your new headmaster,
Mr. Quisumbing!

387
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:38,534
Oh! So you're close
with our Headmaster?

388
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:41,161
Yes, we're all still pretty close.

389
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:43,455
But yes, John Paul Quisumbing

390
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:46,416
is one of my most favorite
people from Benison.

391
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,919
You know, we were
a pretty small batch.

392
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:49,711
[Migz] We heard.

393
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,004
We were only 55.

394
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,048
Your batch's impressive.

395
00:18:53,131 --> 00:18:55,884
Lots of famous achievers
in such a small group.

396
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:59,555
Like you--
CFFD's best designer

397
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:01,056
for the last three years!

398
00:19:01,139 --> 00:19:03,684
My gosh, I'm so high-key
thrilled right now

399
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:06,478
to be in the presence
of fashion greatness!

400
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:10,858
Thank you, but I wasn't
this put together.

401
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,109
Back then...

402
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:13,485
I wasn't a...

403
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,363
fashionista in high school.

404
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:17,906
Just ask your Headmaster.

405
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:19,408
Or Dad.

406
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:20,701
Well...

407
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:21,785
But Mom, even if you were

408
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:23,620
so fashion-challenged
back in high school,

409
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:25,622
Dad was already
crazy in love with you.

410
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:28,542
It was so obvious in your first
couple pic at your ball.

411
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:34,673
Sorry, I'm confused.

412
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:35,883
So...

413
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:39,887
-You were with Sir Maxim at the Benison Ball?
-[tense music begins]

414
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:41,430
Yes.

415
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:43,265
At the end of the ball,

416
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:46,351
Maxim declared his feelings for me,

417
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:49,313
and he asked
if he could be my boyfriend.

418
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:51,607
We became a couple that same night.

419
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:52,858
Oh...

420
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:59,364
Didn't you start dating
Sir Maxim after graduation?

421
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:01,783
He was already working
at that time.

422
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,493
In fact, he just
came back from Mindoro

423
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:06,580
because of the
family business, right?

424
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:10,626
Where did you get that information?

425
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:14,087
We based it on our research,

426
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:18,133
A.K.A. the life story of Max.

427
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:23,931
Max is older than Elle
by a few months,

428
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:30,979
which means
Maxim and Max's mother

429
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:34,900
met and dated first,

430
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,151
right?

431
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:39,237
No.

432
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:44,618
Actually, Maxim and I
were together seven years,

433
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,329
and we were already engaged

434
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:51,959
when Maxim met
Max's mother in Mindoro.

435
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,711
Maxim's family and I were shocked

436
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:57,089
when he suddenly

437
00:20:57,464 --> 00:20:59,716
broke off the engagement
to be with

438
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:02,511
Max's mother.

439
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:06,682
So, your mother was a mistress?

440
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:08,892
-[Migz] Shh!
-[Khloe] OMG!

441
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:10,185
-[Migz] Khloe!
-[Khloe] What?

442
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:12,312
[Migz] Sorry for that ma'am.

443
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:14,147
Let's proceed to the next question.

444
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:18,360
[Max] Why didn't you tell me?

445
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:24,574
As far as we know,

446
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:28,036
Maxim was not with Elle's mother

447
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,871
when he got together with your mom.

448
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:33,333
Plus, we didn't bombard
her with questions

449
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:37,421
because she was so happy
when she met your father.

450
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:41,216
They didn't look like

451
00:21:41,299 --> 00:21:44,553
they were doing something wrong.

452
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:45,387
[Boyet] Mom,

453
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:48,890
it's easy to pretend
you did nothing wrong

454
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:52,144
if nobody knows about it.

455
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:54,146
What are you saying?

456
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:54,938
Huh?

457
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:57,149
Your sister did something wrong?

458
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:59,401
No, Mom. Did I say that?

459
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:00,527
She's the angel of this family!

460
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:02,070
I'm the black sheep.

461
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,655
You?

462
00:22:04,322 --> 00:22:05,282
How?

463
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:06,950
[makes sheep sounds]

464
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:13,582
Remember, you were
the one who returned

465
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:17,919
Maxim's wallet when
your sister stole it from him.

466
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:21,298
See? Mmm.

467
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:23,008
Uncle Boyet would rather
die in debts

468
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:27,262
than live off stolen money.

469
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:31,183
Your uncle may be silly,

470
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,769
but he's no crook.

471
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:35,479
Right?

472
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:36,772
[phone vibrates]

473
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:38,648
[phone vibrates]

474
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:42,944
<i>Heard you're in Manila, Boyet.</i>
<i>Boss is looking for you.</i>

475
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:47,532
You should let Uncle Boyet
do the cooking

476
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:49,284
so you won't get tired, Grams.

477
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:53,121
<i>Maxim and I were together</i>
<i>seven years,</i>

478
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:56,208
<i>and we were already engaged</i>

479
00:22:56,708 --> 00:23:00,504
<i>when Maxim met</i>
<i>Max's mother in Mindoro.</i>

480
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:02,839
<i>Maxim's family and I</i>
<i>were shocked</i>

481
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:06,927
<i>when he suddenly</i>
<i>broke off the engagement</i>

482
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:09,763
<i>to be with Max's mother.</i>

483
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:12,015
Is it true, Dad?

484
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:22,901
Yes.

485
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:25,737
I hurt your Aunt Macy,

486
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:28,198
but I didn't realize until lately

487
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:30,826
how much I hurt her.

488
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:34,454
You had an affair with mom?

489
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:38,250
I broke up with your Aunt Macy
the moment I realized

490
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:40,502
I was in love with your mom.

491
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:42,337
So technically,

492
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:44,131
it wasn't an affair.

493
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:45,841
But... [sighs]

494
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:47,342
I think...

495
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:51,805
I was already emotionally
cheating on your Aunt Macy

496
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:54,516
before we officially broke up.

497
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,643
So yes,

498
00:23:57,561 --> 00:23:58,478
I did...

499
00:24:00,063 --> 00:24:01,815
cheat on your Aunt Macy.

500
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:04,693
Max,

501
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:10,240
it's not easy
telling your child the truth.

502
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:12,117
I'm sorry.

503
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:14,870
This must hurt.

504
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:16,413
But isn't...

505
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:18,832
it better to be hurt by the truth

506
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:22,627
than to be comforted with a lie?

507
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:24,796
That's true.

508
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:27,132
But choosing to tell the truth

509
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:30,093
is not always going to be easy.

510
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:31,636
Sometimes,

511
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:35,182
it doesn't even feel right,

512
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:38,852
especially when you know
it'll hurt someone you love.

513
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:42,355
So you came back to Aunt Macy

514
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:45,358
because she's the one
you really love?

515
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:47,611
I loved your mom,

516
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:51,031
but life got in the way then.

517
00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:53,575
My dad got sick.

518
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:55,160
He asked me to go back to Manila

519
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:57,162
to take care of the family business.

520
00:24:58,038 --> 00:24:59,456
After a few weeks,

521
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:02,083
your mom broke up with me.

522
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:03,460
She didn't want to be with me,

523
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:05,503
said it was too complicated.

524
00:25:06,504 --> 00:25:09,090
I didn't know that she
was pregnant with you then.

525
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:12,761
-[Max sighs deeply]
-[Maxim tuts]

526
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:13,762
Soon...

527
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:16,723
your Aunt Macy and I
became friends again.

528
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:19,643
When I thought my dad
was going to die,

529
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:21,478
she was there for me.

530
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:27,275
Then I realized
I never stopped loving her.

531
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:29,819
I apologized to her.

532
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,113
And she forgave me.

533
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:35,033
If only...

534
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:38,995
my story with Macy were perfect.

535
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:41,873
If only my story
with your mom were perfect.

536
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:43,750
But...

537
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:47,545
they're not perfect stories.

538
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:49,548
Because your dad...

539
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:53,593
is far from perfect.

540
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:00,767
But you're a good man.

541
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:03,979
And you're a good father.

542
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:07,148
And that is good enough for me.

543
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:10,318
Thank you, sweetheart.

544
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:21,663
And you know what?

545
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:23,290
As a good dad,

546
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:25,166
I should trust you.

547
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:27,794
And believe you when
you tell me that your...

548
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:31,589
that your boyfriend--

549
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:34,050
[both laugh]

550
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:36,636
I can't believe
you have a boyfriend!

551
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:38,596
Anyway,

552
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:40,348
I believe you.

553
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:42,642
Deib Enrile...

554
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:45,729
might not be such
a bad person after all--

555
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:48,606
Oh, thank you!

556
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,108
Thank you, Dad!

557
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:51,693
Thank you!

558
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:52,902
Wait.

559
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:55,947
Before I allow him to date you,

560
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:59,617
he must take me on a date first.

561
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:12,172
[jazz music plays through speakers]

562
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:17,844
Tea, Uncle Boyet?

563
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:19,012
Sure!

564
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,181
[Boyet] There.

565
00:27:21,264 --> 00:27:23,725
[liquid pouring]

566
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:24,684
That's too much!

567
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:25,685
Thank you!

568
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:27,479
How about you, Grandma?

569
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:32,150
[Boyet] Not too much, Mom.

570
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,027
Sir,

571
00:27:34,402 --> 00:27:35,528
would you like some tea?

572
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:37,697
No, thanks.

573
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,325
I'd like some food.

574
00:27:40,658 --> 00:27:41,993
I'm starving.

575
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:45,497
Their service here
is quite slow, huh?

576
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:46,331
Waiter!

577
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:47,582
Follow-up!

578
00:27:47,665 --> 00:27:48,333
[waiter] Yes, sir!

579
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:49,376
Sorry, Sir.

580
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:51,336
Usually, their service is really good.

581
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:52,504
Mm-hmm.

582
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:54,923
Anyway, sorta-brother-in-law,

583
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:56,841
have I told you
what a stand-up guy Deib is?

584
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:57,300
Mm-hmm.

585
00:27:57,384 --> 00:27:58,718
[Boyet] He followed my advice.

586
00:27:58,802 --> 00:27:59,886
I told him that

587
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:04,140
he should also ask you for
permission to date Max!

588
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,058
Good job!

589
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:07,018
-[Maxim] Hmm.
-[Boyet] Yay!

590
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:07,936
Yeah!

591
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:09,646
[Boyet] Hey!

592
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:10,480
Boyet,

593
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:14,359
do you know what
Deib did to Max before?

594
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:18,029
Of course, sorta-brother-in-law!

595
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:20,407
We're up to date
with their love story.

596
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:21,616
[Grandma laughs]

597
00:28:21,699 --> 00:28:26,037
Max was even fighting
her feelings at first.

598
00:28:26,454 --> 00:28:28,123
She was afraid that

599
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:29,290
what happened with RJ
would happen agai--

600
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:30,542
Grams!

601
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:31,960
What?

602
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:33,837
[awkward chuckle]

603
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:35,213
RJ?

604
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:38,133
-Her ex.
-My best friend in Mindoro.

605
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:41,719
So, which is it?

606
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,638
Actually, both.

607
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:46,933
And here he is! RJ!

608
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:49,561
[Boyet] Over here!

609
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:58,111
[Boyet] Thank you!

610
00:28:58,778 --> 00:28:59,571
[Boyet] Uh...

611
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:01,781
We forgot Mom's meds,

612
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:04,033
so I asked RJ to bring them over.

613
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:05,952
Thank you, son. Zell!

614
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:10,540
You haven't met Maxpein's dad.

615
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:12,625
This is Sir Maxim Luna.

616
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:13,877
Hello!

617
00:29:15,753 --> 00:29:16,212
Hello, sir.

618
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:16,838
Hi.

619
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:18,423
Nice to meet you.

620
00:29:18,506 --> 00:29:19,340
Nice to meet you, too.

621
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:20,800
Well, we'll get going.

622
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:22,802
Wait! Why don't you both join us?

623
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:25,388
-Dad, you're on a date with Deib, right?
-[RJ] Sir, I don't wanna intrude.

624
00:29:27,682 --> 00:29:28,308
Darling,

625
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:31,478
I haven't met any of your
friends from Mindoro.

626
00:29:31,811 --> 00:29:35,482
Have you met any of her
Mindoro friends, Deib?

627
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:39,152
[Maxim chuckles] Well...

628
00:29:39,235 --> 00:29:40,445
This will be a
good opportunity for you

629
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:43,656
to get to know Max better, right?

630
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:48,161
[loud slurping, gulps]

631
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:51,873
[RJ] Grandma, here.
Take your meds.

632
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:54,000
Ah. [chuckles]

633
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:57,337
You sweet child,
you never let me off the hook!

634
00:29:57,837 --> 00:30:05,428
You're even more strict
than Max with my meds.

635
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:06,971
[Grandma laughs]
Thank you.

636
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:07,722
Grandma.

637
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,557
Uhm...

638
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:11,392
Before you get back to Mindoro,

639
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:14,145
I'll set up a check-up
for you with Mom.

640
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:16,231
I don't wanna impose...

641
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:18,149
[laughing]

642
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:20,401
and it might be too expensive.

643
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:22,362
Grandma, don't worry about that.

644
00:30:22,695 --> 00:30:24,280
My mom will happily do that for free.

645
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:26,366
[squeals in delight]

646
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:27,700
[Boyet] Look at you, Mom!

647
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:29,994
Treated like a queen by your
granddaughter's two BFs--

648
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:32,121
Uncle Boyet! Deib is--

649
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:36,125
I know!
Your boyfriend--BF #1.

650
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:38,545
Your best friend, he's BF #2.

651
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:39,420
Relax!

652
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:43,591
So BF #2,

653
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:46,010
how did you become friends
with my daughter?

654
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:48,972
Max and RJ are childhood friends.

655
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:50,640
We'd vacation in Mindoro

656
00:30:50,723 --> 00:30:52,684
and they'd always play
basketball and billiards.

657
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:56,062
From summer friends to FB, email,

658
00:30:56,145 --> 00:30:58,356
and text friends
whenever they had school.

659
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:02,527
They were really close even
when they were far away.

660
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:05,488
They even have a yearly tradition.

661
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:08,283
Big bro, what's the date again--

662
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:10,952
the day you'd go by the sea?

663
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:12,036
[Max, RJ] March 11.

664
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:15,790
[Maxim, Deib] March 11?

665
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:19,127
March 11, 2011--

666
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:22,171
the day Max's mom
died in a tsunami in Japan.

667
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:26,593
I'd go to the seaside
in Mindoro while he'd visit--

668
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:27,677
[RJ] Manila Bay.

669
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:30,179
Then we'd eat egg
at the same time.

670
00:31:30,763 --> 00:31:34,309
We'd put ketchup in the shape
of a heart on the egg.

671
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:36,227
Mom taught me to do it like that

672
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:39,606
whenever I missed her.

673
00:31:40,106 --> 00:31:42,900
I promised Max
I'd always go with her,

674
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:45,278
so she'd never be alone--

675
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:48,323
[Max] So I'd never be lonely.

676
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:51,159
Well,

677
00:31:52,118 --> 00:31:52,660
thank you!

678
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:54,203
Thank you, RJ,

679
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:56,748
for being there for my daughter

680
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:59,834
when I couldn't be there for her.

681
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:03,796
Thank you.

682
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,631
Thank you.

683
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:08,760
Thank you, Deib...

684
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:12,388
for lunch.

685
00:32:16,225 --> 00:32:16,934
[Maxim] So...

686
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:17,935
Game!

687
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:19,896
Let's play basketball!

688
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:22,023
I have a court reserved, sir.

689
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:22,940
Good.

690
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:24,984
Why don't Boyet and RJ join us?

691
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:27,236
It'll be more fun. Right?

692
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:30,406
You and Boyet against me and RJ.

693
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:32,075
How about that, huh?

694
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:33,451
[Maxim] Game, RJ?

695
00:32:34,994 --> 00:32:36,037
-[Maxim] Yeah!
-Thank you.

696
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:38,539
[Boyet] Yay! Game!

697
00:32:45,963 --> 00:32:47,465
Stretch like this!

698
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:50,927
Then Warrior 2.

699
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:51,886
Where are you?

700
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:54,514
MOO, I'll be there soon.

701
00:32:54,597 --> 00:32:56,599
I just gotta take care
of Grandma first.

702
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:58,643
<i>She got really tired</i>
<i>from our date earlier.</i>

703
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:01,938
MOO, I need you here.

704
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:05,525
I might end up punching your ex.

705
00:33:05,608 --> 00:33:07,110
<i>He's being such a show-off!</i>

706
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:08,861
MOO, take it easy!

707
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:11,030
<i>Remember, you're still</i>
<i>on a date with Dad.</i>

708
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:12,156
What's our goal?

709
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,616
[sighs]

710
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,326
Get your dad to like me.

711
00:33:15,618 --> 00:33:17,495
Right!

712
00:33:17,745 --> 00:33:19,080
The interhigh championship is over.

713
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:21,082
<i>You're the winner already.</i>

714
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:22,792
<i>You're already the MVP</i>

715
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:24,711
even in my heart.

716
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:26,462
Okay.

717
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:27,338
[Maxim] Deib!

718
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,715
Let's go!

719
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:30,967
Alright. Break a leg! Bye!

720
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:33,344
[Maxim] Game! Game!
Here, Deib!

721
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:35,847
[Maxim] RJ!

722
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:39,767
Deib! Show me
some MVP defense!

723
00:33:40,476 --> 00:33:42,145
Boyet, he's open!
What are you doing?

724
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:46,023
[Maxim laughing]

725
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:48,693
[Boyet] You guarded me well.

726
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:50,069
[Maxim] Defense, RJ!

727
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:58,703
[Maxim] RJ, pick and roll!

728
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:01,539
[Boyet] There!

729
00:34:03,666 --> 00:34:04,333
[Maxim] Go!

730
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:07,462
Nice!
Nice one, RJ!

731
00:34:07,962 --> 00:34:08,921
Nice shot!

732
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:09,881
Come, pick!

733
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:11,632
Roll!

734
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:13,259
[Boyet] Good!

735
00:34:13,342 --> 00:34:14,469
[Maxim] Nice one!

736
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:17,680
[Boyet] We should go home now.

737
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:19,223
[Boyet] We already lost!

738
00:34:21,058 --> 00:34:22,185
[Boyet] Come on!

739
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:24,187
[Boyet] Come on!

740
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:26,147
That's it?
Is this your MVP move?

741
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:27,523
Huh, Deib?

742
00:34:35,114 --> 00:34:35,823
[hand tapping ball]

743
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:43,122
[Boyet] Shoot!

744
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:45,082
-[Maxim] Nice one!
-Yes!

745
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:46,250
[Maxim] Nice shot!

746
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:50,546
[Maxim] Come on, Deib!

747
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,465
Show me some MVP moves!

748
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:55,676
Or maybe you're an MBP--
Most Benched Player?

749
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,260
Come on!

750
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:58,179
Deib, switch!
I'm no match with this.

751
00:34:58,262 --> 00:34:59,096
[Maxim] Switch! Switch!

752
00:34:59,847 --> 00:35:00,973
RJ, make your move!

753
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:02,350
What, Echavez?

754
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:03,810
Are you trying to show off?

755
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:05,478
To my girlfriend's dad?

756
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:07,271
No!

757
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:09,398
You're the one
trying hard to do that,

758
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:11,943
but Max's dad doesn't look
impressed by you at all.

759
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:26,082
[Deib's shoes skidding]

760

-[Maxim grunts]

761

-[Maxim grunts in pain]
-[loud thud]

762
00:35:51,607 --> 00:35:52,775
[Deib] Sir, I'm so sorry.

763
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:54,569
I didn't see you there.

764
00:35:55,444 --> 00:35:57,738
It's okay.
You didn't do it on purpose.

765
00:35:58,072 --> 00:35:59,073
Nice game, boys!

766
00:35:59,156 --> 00:36:00,449
-Nice game!
-Nice game!

767
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:01,659
Nice.

768
00:36:01,742 --> 00:36:03,244
You both played well.

769
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:05,621
Where do you plan
to try out for varsity?

770
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:07,999
[Deib, RJ]
Stella Orientis University.

771
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:12,962
If you both get accepted,

772
00:36:13,045 --> 00:36:14,922
you need to know
how to play together.

773
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:16,757
What course are you taking,
Deib?

774
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:19,010
I think maybe engineering, sir.

775
00:36:19,468 --> 00:36:20,469
How about you, RJ?

776
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:22,263
I plan to be a doctor, sir.

777
00:36:23,055 --> 00:36:23,681
Nice.

778
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:27,101
RJ has wanted to be a doctor
since he was a kid,

779
00:36:27,184 --> 00:36:28,436
sorta-brother-in-law.

780
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:30,605
And Max wants to be a nurse.

781
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:34,192
They plan to build
a hospital in our barrio.

782
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:35,109
Right, guys?

783
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:37,194
[Maxim] Really?

784
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:41,407
There's a lot
I don't know about Max.

785
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:44,327
[Deib] Worst game of my life.

786
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:46,329
Ever.

787
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:49,749
Your ex is so annoying,

788
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:51,125
always showing off to your dad.

789
00:36:51,208 --> 00:36:52,293
MOO,

790
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:54,128
let it go.

791
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:57,381
What matters is you're
on Dad's good side now.

792
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:59,884
He even let you inside the house!

793
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:04,847
Dad also appreciated
how you didn't complain

794
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:07,683
when he asked Randall to lunch.

795
00:37:10,686 --> 00:37:13,648
He was just testing you
and you passed the test.

796
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:20,196
I think Dad is starting to see
what I see in you.

797
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:23,741
I'm so proud of you, MOO.

798
00:37:24,116 --> 00:37:26,494
Thank you
for accommodating Dad.

799
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:34,961
MOO, cheer up! Smile.
Give me a smile.

800
00:37:36,545 --> 00:37:37,380
MOO,

801
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:39,715
what's the problem?

802
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:42,510
There's a lot
I don't know about you.

803
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,638
You had this whole life

804
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:47,640
before me

805
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:50,184
that I know nothing about.

806
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:52,812
You also.

807
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:55,815
You also had a life before me.

808
00:37:57,274 --> 00:37:59,110
Okay, let's do this.

809
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:02,780
If there's anything you
wanna know, just ask me.

810
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:06,158
I'll tell you everything
and leave nothing out.

811
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:08,786
Okay.

812
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:10,830
But it's not just that.

813
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:13,833
I just realized...

814
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:16,085
that you really do have this

815
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:18,879
deep friendship with Echavez.

816
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:21,799
And I get it,

817
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:24,260
he's your best friend.

818
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:30,433
But as your boyfriend now,

819
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:34,270
can't I be your best friend?

820
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:40,026
I wanna be the one
you're with on March 11.

821
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:45,197
I wanna be a part of
your plans to be a nurse,

822
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:47,491
to build a hospital,

823
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:51,120
or whatever other plans
you may have in the future.

824
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:53,497
Okay.

825
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:57,251
Deib Lohr Enrile,

826
00:38:57,877 --> 00:38:59,962
aside from being my boyfriend,

827
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:02,965
will you be my best friend?

828
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:08,929
Of course, Maxpein del Valle.

829
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:10,681
It would be...

830
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:12,391
A pleasure.

831
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:20,524
Promise, the first building
I'll build

832
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:22,109
will be your dream hospital.

833
00:39:22,818 --> 00:39:23,819
Okay?

834
00:39:25,404 --> 00:39:26,947
I'm not sure if
I'll push through with that.

835
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:29,408
Becoming a nurse?

836
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:30,576
Why not?

837
00:39:32,411 --> 00:39:33,496
I don't know.

838
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:35,790
I can't imagine it now.

839
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:37,041
What do you wanna be instead?

840
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:40,878
I'm thinking
what if I became an astronaut.

841
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:43,631
[laughter]

842
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:44,131
Just kidding.

843
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:46,092
Babybabe, anything but that!

844
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:49,053
That's LDR extreme edition!

845
00:39:50,262 --> 00:39:53,057
We've both tried LDR
with different people

846
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,683
and we suck at it, okay?

847
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:55,476
Okay!

848
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:58,312
Don't even try going to outer space!

849
00:39:58,395 --> 00:40:00,314
I love you from the moon.
Why not?

850
00:40:00,397 --> 00:40:02,191
Wow!

851
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:05,653
[laughter]

852
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:07,988
I love you, MOO-n!

853
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:10,908

Love you, Tob...

00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:36,851
[Lee] It's Michiko...

860
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:46,944
It's okay not to be okay,
Michiko.

861
00:40:52,074 --> 00:40:53,325
Michiko,

862
00:40:55,911 --> 00:40:58,122
we're just here if you need
someone to talk to.

863
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:02,293
We'll help you find answers.

864
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:04,587
We all need answers.

865
00:41:06,463 --> 00:41:09,550
It's no use stressing about it.

866
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:11,427
Just be positive!

867
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:13,012
Just think: they're filthy rich.

868
00:41:13,095 --> 00:41:14,513
They can get away with anything!

869
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:15,556
-[Naih] Joke!
-[Lee, Ysay] Naih!

870
00:41:16,682 --> 00:41:17,600
[Naih] Just kidding!

871
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:21,145
Hey, I was just kidding!

872
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:22,646
Just trying to make you laugh!

873
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:25,024
-Michiko, it's just a joke!
-[Ysay] Michiko!

874
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:30,696
She can't just wallow forever!

875
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:33,866
I was just trying to spread good vibes.

876
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:35,242
Sorry.

877
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:41,415
You know, Mine,
there's nothing wrong

878
00:41:41,498 --> 00:41:44,543
with feeling sad, hurt, or angry.

879
00:41:45,544 --> 00:41:47,171
No one's happy all the time

880
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:50,424
and you have to respect
how other people feel.

881
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:53,802
You cannot force them
to pretend to be happy

882
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:54,887
just because you're uncomfortable

883
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:57,389
with pain and sadness.

884
00:41:59,516 --> 00:42:02,811
Sorry, Mine. Sorry.

885

[Lee sighing]

887
00:42:11,904 --> 00:42:13,948
I can't believe he just left like that.

888
00:42:15,532 --> 00:42:18,369
I feel like I've lost a brother.

889
00:42:19,286 --> 00:42:21,330
I wanna hear from Master Tob.

890
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:23,624
I miss him.

891
00:42:24,541 --> 00:42:27,336
Alpha 3 is not Alpha 3
without Master Tob.

892
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,463
I'd trade places with him

893
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:31,423
if Alpha 3
could be complete again.

894
00:42:33,926 --> 00:42:36,971
Don't say that.

895
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:41,809
Alpha 3 is not Alpha 3
without Lorde.

896
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:47,481
Alpha 3 is not complete
without you, okay?

897
00:42:48,482 --> 00:42:52,194
[Lorde giggles]

898
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:54,280
I feel kilig, Master.

899
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:55,114
Kilig how?

900
00:42:55,197 --> 00:42:55,614
Like this!

901
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:56,782
[squealing]

902
00:42:57,449 --> 00:42:58,659
I complete you!

903
00:42:58,742 --> 00:43:01,787
Maxpein, Naih, and Lorde

904
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:03,163
are on the same level?

905
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:04,456
Don't go overboard.

906
00:43:05,124 --> 00:43:06,709
It's the power of kilig.

907
00:43:06,792 --> 00:43:08,502
[giggling]

908
00:43:12,506 --> 00:43:13,632
[Lee] Can you show me
kilig again?

909
00:43:14,174 --> 00:43:15,551
[Lorde] Master, it's easy.

910
00:43:15,634 --> 00:43:18,929
This is how you do it...
