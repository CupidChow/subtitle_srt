1
00:00:01,133 --> 00:00:04,838
Boss is asking when
you'll pay your debt.

2
00:00:04,971 --> 00:00:06,472
It's like we're not even
friends.

3
00:00:06,605 --> 00:00:08,307
I don't wanna be friends with
you.

4
00:00:08,441 --> 00:00:09,808
You don't wanna be friends?
Fine.

5
00:00:09,942 --> 00:00:11,577
[Max] But don't forget:

6
00:00:11,711 --> 00:00:13,413
You're the one who made
that choice, not me.

7
00:00:13,545 --> 00:00:16,048
I think those checklists
only set up

8
00:00:16,181 --> 00:00:18,484
unrealistic expectations
on relationships.

9
00:00:18,617 --> 00:00:19,652
[Lee] I agree with Ysay.

10
00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:21,420
You can't be friends with
the girl who hurt you!

11
00:00:21,553 --> 00:00:23,356
You can't say
you love Deib either

12
00:00:23,489 --> 00:00:25,225
because the truth is
you only love yourself!

13
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:26,826
[Deib] Max, who's the parent
who complained?

14
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,060
I'll talk to them. Who?

15
00:00:28,394 --> 00:00:29,896
[Max] Aunt Macy.

16
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,731
I've been talking to the Board
about your daughter's case.

17
00:00:32,131 --> 00:00:33,566
I think we can get a formal
inquiry

18
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:34,533
to look into your daughter's
expulsion.

19
00:00:34,667 --> 00:00:35,402
Thank you!

20
00:00:36,002 --> 00:00:37,103
Yes, Maxpein?

21
00:00:37,237 --> 00:00:38,438
Deib needs your help.

22
00:00:39,005 --> 00:00:41,841
As president, you can request
a formal inquiry.

23
00:00:41,975 --> 00:00:43,375
Fine. I'll do it.

24
00:00:43,777 --> 00:00:44,476
What's the catch?

25
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:45,844
I want one night with you.

26
00:00:48,781 --> 00:00:49,381
So how?

27
00:00:49,515 --> 00:00:50,850
[Kim] I'm still the president.

28
00:00:52,284 --> 00:00:52,851
[Kim] What?

29
00:00:53,485 --> 00:00:54,753
Don't I get a little
"thank you" from you?

30
00:00:55,354 --> 00:00:56,423
What's the catch?

31
00:00:56,823 --> 00:00:58,857
I break up with Max?
Never gonna happen, Kim.

32
00:00:58,991 --> 00:00:59,926
I know.

33
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,927
That's why I want something
else.

34
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:04,030
So there's still a catch?

35
00:01:04,463 --> 00:01:06,632
I just need a little favor.

36
00:01:10,069 --> 00:01:11,438
I want one night with you.

37
00:01:11,771 --> 00:01:18,510
[friends gasp, indistinct
chatter]

38
00:01:18,644 --> 00:01:19,945
What the hell are you talking
about?

39
00:01:20,245 --> 00:01:20,813
No!

40
00:01:21,447 --> 00:01:22,816
"No" immediately?!

41
00:01:23,316 --> 00:01:25,150
I just want you to be
my date for the night!

42
00:01:25,284 --> 00:01:26,819
To my grandpa's birthday
party this weekend.

43
00:01:28,454 --> 00:01:30,355
You guys thought something
else?!

44
00:01:30,489 --> 00:01:31,825
Get your minds out of the
gutter!

45
00:01:32,191 --> 00:01:33,459
Why Deib?!

46
00:01:33,992 --> 00:01:36,528
Just find a single guy
so you don't look like

47
00:01:36,662 --> 00:01:38,730
a mistress begging for
attention.

48
00:01:38,864 --> 00:01:39,566
She's not talking to you,

49
00:01:39,698 --> 00:01:41,200
you obstreperous habbercock!

50
00:01:41,968 --> 00:01:43,368
Obsershushous haper--
what's that, Master?

51
00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:44,703
The two of you!

52
00:01:45,838 --> 00:01:47,373
[Kim] You know that my
grandpa will look for you.

53
00:01:47,507 --> 00:01:49,209
I still haven't told him
that we've broken up.

54
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:51,144
I'm not gonna do it
if we're going to pretend--

55
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:52,712
[Kim] Look, Deib.

56
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:53,680
After you do this,

57
00:01:53,813 --> 00:01:55,314
I'll tell my family
we broke up already.

58
00:01:55,447 --> 00:01:56,349
[Kim] And...

59
00:01:56,649 --> 00:01:58,852
I'll never ask a favor from
you...

60
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:00,019
ever again.

61
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,026
[Deib] No!

62
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:09,562
[Max] What's the problem?

63
00:02:09,695 --> 00:02:10,729
You'll just go with her to a
party!

64
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:13,098
I don't wanna pretend we're
still together!

65
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:16,269
She said you weren't gonna
pretend, right?

66
00:02:16,568 --> 00:02:17,736
I don't want to be put in a
position

67
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:19,004
wherein I have to lie.

68
00:02:19,438 --> 00:02:21,875
No one wants that, Deib.
Even me.

69
00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:24,443
If Echavez...

70
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:27,947
asked for the same favor,
would you do it?!

71
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,582
If the situation were reversed,

72
00:02:30,949 --> 00:02:33,786
and I had to spend time with him
to save you?

73
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:35,521
Yes.

74
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,959
So you'd let the whole world
believe a lie

75
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,728
to save me?!

76
00:02:42,194 --> 00:02:42,829
Yes,

77
00:02:43,596 --> 00:02:45,264
even though I don't want to lie.

78
00:02:45,865 --> 00:02:49,201
Because what matters
is that I know the truth.

79
00:02:49,701 --> 00:02:51,371
Because it's clear to me

80
00:02:51,937 --> 00:02:52,972
that RJ and I are over

81
00:02:53,372 --> 00:02:54,873
and you're the one I love.

82
00:02:55,608 --> 00:02:58,277
Plus, I won't put myself
in a position

83
00:02:58,411 --> 00:02:59,979
where I have to lie.

84
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,316
Max, how is that even possible?

85
00:03:05,217 --> 00:03:07,387
Well...

86
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,254
I'll find a way...

87
00:03:09,688 --> 00:03:11,324
not to get asked
if we're still together,

88
00:03:11,456 --> 00:03:12,959
so I don't have to lie.

89
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,695
And I won't behave
as if we're still together!

90
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:20,667
Example: I won't kiss him!

91
00:03:22,168 --> 00:03:23,203
Why? Would you?

92
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:25,604
Is that even a question, MOO?

93
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:28,407
See?

94
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:31,777
And I trust you--
I know you won't do that.

95
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:34,080
So, what's the problem?

96
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:38,685
It seems...

97
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:44,122
I'm the only one who gets
jealous,

98
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:46,725
but you never do?

99
00:03:47,492 --> 00:03:48,927
What does jealousy
have to do with this?

100
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:51,965
Don't you care at all?!

101
00:03:52,098 --> 00:03:54,099
Not even a little bit jealous?

102
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,768
No.

103
00:03:56,468 --> 00:03:58,972
Because I have no reason
to be jealous.

104
00:03:59,605 --> 00:04:03,109
I'm sure about you.
About us.

105
00:04:03,575 --> 00:04:04,776
You know Deib,

106
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:06,412
to be honest,

107
00:04:06,545 --> 00:04:08,981
I don't like how jealous
you still get with RJ.

108
00:04:09,581 --> 00:04:12,018
How many times do I have
to tell you that we're over?

109
00:04:15,054 --> 00:04:15,888
Max.

110
00:04:16,488 --> 00:04:17,523
Sorry...

111
00:04:17,956 --> 00:04:20,526
your boyfriend's
such a jealous monster.

112
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:21,860
Sorry.

113
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:24,963
I really appreciate that you
trust me.

114
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:27,934
And I trust you, too, so much.

115
00:04:29,201 --> 00:04:30,403
I just feel like

116
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:34,072
everytime we solve a problem,

117
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:37,843
here comes another one.

118
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:39,911
These trials

119
00:04:40,545 --> 00:04:42,180
make us stronger.

120
00:04:43,649 --> 00:04:46,185
And we won't let go

121
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:48,521
no matter what disaster comes,
right?

122
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:51,124
I'm not letting go.

123
00:04:52,658 --> 00:04:53,992
Just sulking...

124
00:04:54,526 --> 00:04:55,495
a little bit.

125
00:04:55,627 --> 00:04:56,795
[Max scoffs]

126
00:04:58,363 --> 00:04:59,464
So,

127
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:01,701
will you go with Kim?

128
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:06,538
["He's Into Her" by BGYO
playing]

129
00:06:05,831 --> 00:06:06,865
[Headmaster] You failed
four exams this week

130
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:09,634
because you turned in
blank test papers.

131
00:06:10,702 --> 00:06:11,803
[Headmaster] And I'm worried.

132
00:06:12,704 --> 00:06:13,805
I know you didn't graduate

133
00:06:13,939 --> 00:06:15,608
last school year
and had to repeat.

134
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:17,410
But I heard from your teachers

135
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:19,011
that you were doing well this
year.

136
00:06:20,346 --> 00:06:21,379
But lately,

137
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:23,382
they said that you've been
getting low marks.

138
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:27,052
You don't submit projects
on time or at all.

139
00:06:28,053 --> 00:06:30,656
You even zone out during class.

140
00:06:31,357 --> 00:06:33,725
Heartbreak is never easy.

141
00:06:34,526 --> 00:06:35,394
I know.

142
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:38,663
I experienced my first
heartbreak here in Benison.

143
00:06:39,564 --> 00:06:41,800
Look, if your life were a book,

144
00:06:42,567 --> 00:06:44,336
this would just be a chapter

145
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:45,538
in that book.

146
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:49,742
Yes, it's a sad,
painful part of the story...

147
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,043
But the story must go on.

148
00:06:53,278 --> 00:06:54,012
Life...

149
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,814
must go on.

150
00:06:57,182 --> 00:07:00,420
And you can't let this pain take
away

151
00:07:00,552 --> 00:07:02,754
everything you've worked so hard
for.

152
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:07,593
I want you to graduate this
year.

153
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:10,495
The question is...

154
00:07:10,963 --> 00:07:13,165
do you want to graduate?

155
00:07:18,036 --> 00:07:19,605
Given your emotional state,

156
00:07:19,738 --> 00:07:20,673
I asked your teachers

157
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:22,809
to let you retake the exams
you failed.

158
00:07:24,776 --> 00:07:25,911
Thank you, sir.

159
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,346
You're welcome.

160
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,480
Go Michiko,

161
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:29,915
fight and win.

162
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:32,317
Hoo-hah, hoo-hah!

163
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:37,290
Mom, Zell, RJ, let's eat!

164
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:38,156
[phone pings]

165
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:45,697
When are you paying
your 75K debt?

166
00:07:48,834 --> 00:07:52,771
Boss has been patient.
He's given you months to pay.

167
00:07:59,144 --> 00:08:02,615
I have no money yet.
I'm sorry.

168
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:05,718
[phone pings]

169
00:08:06,651 --> 00:08:10,088
When are you paying
your 75K debt?

170
00:08:16,461 --> 00:08:19,165
God! I couldn't do it then,

171
00:08:20,098 --> 00:08:21,233
I still couldn't do it now!

172
00:08:23,101 --> 00:08:24,269
[Boyet sighs]

173
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:28,274
Uncle Boyet,

174
00:08:29,341 --> 00:08:30,076
-are you okay?
-Hey!

175
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:31,744
Yeah, just a bit hot in the
kitchen.

176
00:08:31,877 --> 00:08:33,044
Come on, eat.

177
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:34,779
Did you get bad news?

178
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,216
Uhm, sorta.

179
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,086
Our house in Mindoro
got really damaged.

180
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:42,889
We need a lot of money
to have it repaired.

181
00:08:44,389 --> 00:08:46,792
I've got nothing to lend you,

182
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:50,129
but I'll ask Dad.

183
00:08:50,629 --> 00:08:53,265
No, RJ!
It's more than enough

184
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:54,466
you let us stay with you.

185
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:57,937
I'll handle this. Just eat!

186
00:08:58,303 --> 00:08:59,572
Zell, come eat!

187
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:04,176
Enjoy the food.
I'll get some water.

188
00:09:04,309 --> 00:09:05,677
-[Grandma Bhaves] Wow!
-[RJ] Let's eat!

189
00:09:11,049 --> 00:09:11,683
Max,

190
00:09:12,684 --> 00:09:14,787
I have something to ask you...

191
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:18,857
Do you have money saved?

192
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:20,793
Can you lend me some?

193
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:21,994
How much, Uncle?

194
00:09:23,461 --> 00:09:25,298
[Boyet] As much as you can.

195
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:27,732
Hopefully...

196
00:09:29,634 --> 00:09:30,702
75,000.

197
00:09:30,836 --> 00:09:31,937
-75,000?!
-[Boyet shushes]

198
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:34,240
Don't say it so loud!

199
00:09:35,106 --> 00:09:38,009
Uncle, what are you
gonna do with 75,000?

200
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:42,782
Remember we got hit
by a typhoon in Mindoro?

201
00:09:42,914 --> 00:09:47,186
Our roof and walls gave in.
Lots of repair needed.

202
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:51,389
75,000 for the roof and walls?

203
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:53,658
That's the quote I was given.

204
00:09:54,293 --> 00:09:56,428
[Boyet] We can't move back in
otherwise.

205
00:09:57,462 --> 00:09:58,464
Alright, I'll try.

206
00:09:59,498 --> 00:10:00,865
[Boyet] Sorry, Max.

207
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:02,934
Max, Uncle Boyet.

208
00:10:03,068 --> 00:10:05,770
- Deib, sit down.
- Sorry to interrupt.

209
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:08,106
Sorry to interrupt, but...

210
00:10:09,207 --> 00:10:12,711
but I can lend you the money
if you need it.

211
00:10:13,044 --> 00:10:14,679
No, Deib, we can't take your
money.

212
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:19,150
Deib, thanks,
but Maxpein and I got this.

213
00:10:19,284 --> 00:10:20,285
Max,

214
00:10:21,386 --> 00:10:24,322
what's family for if we don't
help each other out?

215
00:10:26,558 --> 00:10:28,259
Max, I insist.

216
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,365
[Max sighs]

217
00:10:33,231 --> 00:10:36,802
Okay, but we'll pay you back.

218
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:38,236
No, no, it's okay!

219
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:41,206
No, it's a loan. We'll pay you
back.

220
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,441
It's only right.

221
00:10:42,908 --> 00:10:45,610
Okay, fine, but no pressure.

222
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:46,979
No pressure.

223
00:10:47,913 --> 00:10:49,347
Thanks, Deib.

224
00:10:53,785 --> 00:10:55,653
[Migz]
After Deib gives his speech

225
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:58,557
apologizing to those he bullied

226
00:10:58,691 --> 00:11:01,259
we should also highlight all his
traits

227
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:03,395
and achievements, right?

228
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:06,264
[Migz] Lorde and Ysay, can you--

229
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,000
Look, people.

230
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:10,668
I don't think Headmaster
and the disciplinary board

231
00:11:10,802 --> 00:11:12,370
are all that impressed with
Deib.

232
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:13,972
The more that we highlight the
fact

233
00:11:14,105 --> 00:11:16,174
that he's a star
student-athlete,

234
00:11:16,307 --> 00:11:18,711
the more that they'll think
we're trying

235
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:20,913
to give him some special
treatment.

236
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:25,250
[Kim] We have to make Deib
seem like

237
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:27,086
everyone else.

238
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,855
But Madam Kim,

239
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:31,856
Master Deib is not like everyone
else.

240
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:34,326
[Lorde] He's a star! He's
special!

241
00:11:34,692 --> 00:11:36,294
That's why you made him your
boo!

242
00:11:37,062 --> 00:11:39,798
Lorde, that's not how it
happened.

243
00:11:40,198 --> 00:11:42,967
I made him my "boo"
because I loved him.

244
00:11:43,101 --> 00:11:44,437
And because I loved him,

245
00:11:45,437 --> 00:11:46,438
he was special to me.

246
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:49,808
It felt really special when
you kissed another dude.

247
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:51,043
- [laughter]
- Burn!

248
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:55,413
You'll never make me forget,
huh?

249
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:59,085
Anyway, you're special-ness
is not the point.

250
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,754
The point should be: Deib,

251
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:05,557
just like everyone else,
deserves a second chance.

252
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:07,559
Right.

253
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:10,229
Because expulsion means

254
00:12:10,361 --> 00:12:12,364
there's no chance for
redemption.

255
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:13,966
It's just the end of the line.

256
00:12:14,265 --> 00:12:15,201
Exactly!

257
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:17,970
Expulsion is the equivalent
of a break-up.

258
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:19,605
That's a good comparison.

259
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:23,241
Hey, whose side are you on?

260
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:24,509
Aren't you a FOM?

261
00:12:24,643 --> 00:12:26,077
FOM?

262
00:12:26,578 --> 00:12:27,046
What?

263
00:12:27,178 --> 00:12:29,749
FOM -- Friend of Max!

264
00:12:29,881 --> 00:12:32,250
Are you back to being a FOK...

265
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:33,785
-- fan of Kim?

266
00:12:33,918 --> 00:12:35,587
Naih, just because I agree with
Kim--

267
00:12:35,721 --> 00:12:37,155
She's the enemy!

268
00:12:37,288 --> 00:12:38,691
She didn't even let Migz finish!

269
00:12:38,823 --> 00:12:40,392
Naih, calm down.

270
00:12:41,092 --> 00:12:42,495
This is not a competition, okay?

271
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:43,629
We're all here to help Deib.

272
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:47,066
Deib, Max?

273
00:12:47,198 --> 00:12:48,533
What do you think about that
strategy?

274
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:51,403
Good.

275
00:12:51,769 --> 00:12:52,904
Kim's got a point.

276
00:12:53,572 --> 00:12:54,405
[Deib] I agree.

277
00:12:55,106 --> 00:12:57,610
I can't face the board
and the student body

278
00:12:57,743 --> 00:13:00,379
like an entitled show-off.

279
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:04,682
Yes, humility's important.

280
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:08,953
Okay, now that's settled,

281
00:13:09,488 --> 00:13:10,655
I need a break.

282
00:13:10,788 --> 00:13:14,426
[Kim] Khloe, Karlie, get my bag.

283
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:15,394
Let's go to the washroom.

284
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:21,299
I need your opinion on
something really important.

285
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:25,203
Guys, let's all meet here
again in 15 minutes?

286
00:13:25,803 --> 00:13:28,440
[Ysay] Migz, wait for me.

287
00:13:28,573 --> 00:13:30,408
Mine, come on.
Let's get some fresh air.

288
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:36,315
[indistinct chatter]

289
00:13:36,447 --> 00:13:38,250
One of the guys from
the team invited me

290
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:39,918
to a pottery class this weekend.

291
00:13:40,351 --> 00:13:42,187
It's gonna be fun. Let's go?

292
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:46,658
You don't like.

293
00:13:47,692 --> 00:13:48,226
Okay.

294
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:50,162
What do you wanna do this
weekend?

295
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:53,432
There's a mall show for
Kathniel .

296
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:54,432
Go with me!

297
00:13:55,366 --> 00:13:57,202
Didn't we go to a mall show last
week?

298
00:13:57,802 --> 00:14:00,572
Mine, that's for Lizquen.
It's a different fandom.

299
00:14:01,105 --> 00:14:03,475
Keep up with my love
for pop culture please!

300
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:09,682
Why don't

301
00:14:10,014 --> 00:14:11,149
you go to the mall show and

302
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:12,717
I'll go to the pottery class,

303
00:14:13,418 --> 00:14:15,653
then let's just meet for dinner.

304
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:17,956
[Naih sighs]

305
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:20,024
Hey. What's wrong?

306
00:14:21,659 --> 00:14:22,727
You're annoying.

307
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:23,729
Huh?

308
00:14:24,462 --> 00:14:25,530
What did I do?

309
00:14:26,565 --> 00:14:28,967
You sided with your cousin
and Ysay

310
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,201
instead of me.

311
00:14:31,169 --> 00:14:33,205
I'm your girlfriend!

312
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,341
I know that, Naih,

313
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:37,176
but what they were saying made
sense.

314
00:14:37,576 --> 00:14:39,010
And honestly Naih,

315
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:41,113
you don't have to turn
every encounter with Kim

316
00:14:41,246 --> 00:14:43,414
into a low-key bashing of my
cousin.

317
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:45,951
Sorry.

318
00:14:46,518 --> 00:14:48,519
I'm just protective of my best
friend.

319
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:49,788
And...

320
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:52,224
I just want us all to be happy.

321
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:55,326
I know that, Mine.

322
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:57,596
But if they're unbothered by
Kim,

323
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,530
then we shouldn't be
bothered by her, too.

324
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:01,267
Hmm?

325
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:07,339
Master Lee, Master Deib
wants us back in the room.

326
00:15:07,472 --> 00:15:08,673
Let's go!

327
00:15:11,442 --> 00:15:12,778
Are you playing Stop Dance?

328
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,145
Why is nobody moving?

329
00:15:15,547 --> 00:15:19,451
Maybe they're hungry.
I got drained earlier, too.

330
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:22,254
We can be tired and
still keep up the good vibes!

331
00:15:24,255 --> 00:15:25,557
Here, you want?

332
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:27,259
Yes please.

333
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:30,195
Let me.

[wafer crunches]

336
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:44,777
For you.

When will I have
some of that sweetness?

340
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:01,759
True!

341
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:03,562
A pity my love Khloe isn't here.

342
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,403
I'll feed you wafer...

343
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:13,672
as a friend.

344
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:14,807
You're not my type.

345
00:16:23,782 --> 00:16:24,850
You're not my type either!

346
00:16:25,683 --> 00:16:26,150
Hey!

347
00:16:26,284 --> 00:16:28,019
Hey, that's my wafer!

Michiko,

351
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:44,470
are you okay?

352
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:48,606
Sorry, Max.

353
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:51,844
I can't help you and Deib much.

354
00:16:53,077 --> 00:16:56,481
Hey, it's okay!
I understand.

355

363
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:35,287
[Lorde] Sorry, I meant hotdog!
Really!

364
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:37,756
I'm hungry 'cause
somebody ate my wafer.

365
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:41,058
Are you wearing that
to Master Deib's trial?

366
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:42,560
You're so funny, Lorde.

367
00:17:42,693 --> 00:17:43,729
That's the dress she will wear

368
00:17:43,862 --> 00:17:44,896
to her grandpa's party.

369
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:47,365
Do you like?

370
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,169
Does it matter if I like it or
not?

371
00:17:50,868 --> 00:17:55,273
Yes! If you don't have a suit
that matches this dress,

372
00:17:55,406 --> 00:17:57,809
I can totally find another one.

373
00:17:57,942 --> 00:17:59,545
There's another one?

374
00:18:00,578 --> 00:18:03,147
Duh! There are five more
outfits,

375
00:18:03,281 --> 00:18:06,684
they're all fab, and they all
slay,
just like Queen Kim!

376
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,422
It looks good on you, Kim.

377
00:18:10,788 --> 00:18:12,391
Uhm...

378
00:18:12,523 --> 00:18:15,326
Well, now I don't think
I look good in this.

379
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:17,863
Guys, let's find another one!

380
00:18:22,366 --> 00:18:23,301
[phone pings]

381
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:30,642
[Boyet] Max, I've encashed
the money Deib lent.

382
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:33,511
-Tell him thanks again.
- [sighs deeply]

383
00:18:33,644 --> 00:18:35,380
Hey.

384
00:18:35,513 --> 00:18:37,682
That was deep, sis.

385
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:38,750
Why?

386
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:41,987
Do you know any side hustle
I can do?

387
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:42,688
Oh.

388
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,388
That's random.

389
00:18:44,522 --> 00:18:46,023
Why do you ask?

390
00:18:47,192 --> 00:18:49,694
Deib lent Uncle Boyet some
money.

391
00:18:49,827 --> 00:18:52,798
- Stop me!
- Hey, not too loud...

392
00:18:52,931 --> 00:18:55,400
You're legit family now!

393
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,236
It feels kinda awkward,

394
00:18:57,502 --> 00:18:59,438
so I wanna pay him back soon.

395
00:19:00,338 --> 00:19:01,772
[Michiko] Is he asking you to?

396
00:19:01,906 --> 00:19:04,675
I'm sure he doesn't mind
just giving it to you.

397
00:19:06,211 --> 00:19:07,645
Actually.

398
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:11,115
But I don't want Deib's mom to
think

399
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,551
that we're taking advantage of
him.

400
00:19:13,951 --> 00:19:15,686
Do you want me
to lend you some money?

401
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,321
No,

402
00:19:17,722 --> 00:19:19,657
No. I don't feel comfortable
taking loans.

403
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:21,226
That's why I wanna pay
Deib back soon.

404
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:24,028
I'd rather work hard for it.

405
00:19:24,596 --> 00:19:27,098
Naih, how's online selling?

406
00:19:27,231 --> 00:19:29,934
Would I get a commission?

407
00:19:30,568 --> 00:19:36,173
It's okay, but usually the
commission is just 5%.

408
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:39,810
Is there a way to make money
fast?

409
00:19:43,781 --> 00:19:44,282
[gasps]

410
00:19:44,415 --> 00:19:46,951
Stop me!
I got an idea!

411
00:19:47,085 --> 00:19:48,586
My cousin!

412
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,756
Your money problems
are solved now, sis!

413
00:19:52,557 --> 00:19:55,826
Hello, Tiago,
I got the money to pay Boss.

414
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:58,430
[Tiago] That's good, bro.
When are you paying?

415
00:19:58,564 --> 00:20:01,032
Now, I have the money with me.

416
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:02,867
Hey!

417
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:04,303
Hey!

418
00:20:04,435 --> 00:20:06,404
That's my money!
Come back here!

419
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:09,641
-Thief! Hey!
-[dog barks in distance]

420
00:20:11,676 --> 00:20:13,045
How are you, Auntie?

421
00:20:13,178 --> 00:20:14,913
I'm good, Max! How about you?

422
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,015
I'm okay. How's Dale?

423
00:20:17,348 --> 00:20:19,317
Well actually, he's improving.

424
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:20,318
When are you going to visit him?

425
00:20:20,451 --> 00:20:22,988
He gets better when you're
around!

426
00:20:23,121 --> 00:20:24,189
[both laugh]

427
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:26,191
Maybe after Deib's trial.

428
00:20:27,491 --> 00:20:31,128
Thank you for helping Deib, Max.

429
00:20:31,262 --> 00:20:33,832
I hope the disciplinary board
sees that you are

430
00:20:33,965 --> 00:20:36,969
the best testimony
to my son's goodness,

431
00:20:37,102 --> 00:20:40,338
that he's not a horrible
person and he can change.

432
00:20:40,471 --> 00:20:41,006
[Max clicks tongue]

433
00:20:41,138 --> 00:20:42,473
I hope so, too.

434
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:50,115
[romantic music plays]

435
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,807
[Evita] Wow, son!

436
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,942
[gasps] Oh!

437
00:21:18,076 --> 00:21:20,711
You're so handsome!

438
00:21:20,846 --> 00:21:22,748
-[chuckles] Oh!
-[Deib smooches]

439
00:21:22,881 --> 00:21:24,115
I take after you, Mom!

440
00:21:24,249 --> 00:21:25,450
[both laugh]

441
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:27,451
I'm not just saying that
'cause I'm your mother!

442
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:29,954
-[Deib] Hmm!
-[Evita laughs]

443
00:21:30,087 --> 00:21:31,789
Oh, Mom. [smooches]

444
00:21:31,923 --> 00:21:33,959
-Okay, I'll leave you, guys!
-Okay, mom. Love you!

445
00:21:34,092 --> 00:21:35,027
Bye, Max!

446
00:21:35,326 --> 00:21:36,528
Bye, Auntie!

447
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:44,670
Like what you see?

448
00:21:46,837 --> 00:21:48,807
I love what I see.

449
00:21:49,907 --> 00:21:51,410
You look great, Babybabe.

450
00:21:51,843 --> 00:21:53,511
Are you just saying that
'cause you're my girlfriend?

451
00:21:53,644 --> 00:21:55,579
[chuckles]

452
00:21:55,713 --> 00:21:58,016
I don't know how
I got so lucky to have

453
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,251
such a handsome boyfriend
like you.

454
00:22:00,384 --> 00:22:02,354
[both laugh]

455
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:04,288
You should tell me that more
often.

456
00:22:05,022 --> 00:22:09,827
I get butterflies when
you say stuff like that.

457
00:22:11,296 --> 00:22:12,230
Come with me!

458
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:16,134
MOO, I can't.
Let's give this to Kim.

459
00:22:16,268 --> 00:22:17,234
And Naih hooked me up with

460
00:22:17,368 --> 00:22:18,636
a side hustle for her cousin.

461
00:22:19,805 --> 00:22:20,838
Is that tonight?

462
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:22,039
Mhmm.

463
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:26,310
[director] So you're the friend
of my cousin Naih?

464
00:22:26,444 --> 00:22:27,144
[Max] Yes.

465
00:22:27,278 --> 00:22:28,512
Thank you so much.

466
00:22:28,646 --> 00:22:29,548
Thank you, too!

467
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:32,451
It was so hard
to find talents for this.

468
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:34,685
[director]
Done with your release form?

469
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,588
[stutters]
Yes, I filled it up. Here.

470
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:41,859
I'm kinda nervous.

471
00:22:41,992 --> 00:22:44,195
Don't be so nervous, just relax.

472
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:46,131
This is a chill set.

473
00:22:46,431 --> 00:22:47,965
What do I do?

474
00:22:48,733 --> 00:22:50,535
This series is called
"Strangers Try..."

475
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:53,538
It's a social experiment
to see how well

476
00:22:53,672 --> 00:22:56,040
two strangers will get along.

477
00:22:56,173 --> 00:22:59,510
Later we'll be pairing you
with a stranger

478
00:22:59,644 --> 00:23:01,546
and ask you to do things
together.

479
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,615
Nothing sexual or illegal?

480
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:07,051
Nobody told you?

481
00:23:08,787 --> 00:23:11,623
Kidding!
Of course, none, Max!

482
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:16,027
We don't want our account
banned or demonetized.

483
00:23:16,394 --> 00:23:18,797
[director] ID first.
Slate!

484
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:20,332
[clapper clicks]

485
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:22,768
Max, tell me about yourself.

486
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:25,202
I'm Maxpein Del Valle.

487
00:23:25,336 --> 00:23:28,240
I study at
Benison International School.

488
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,409
Senior batch 2022.

489
00:23:30,875 --> 00:23:32,344
[director]
Tell us why you're doing this.

490
00:23:32,477 --> 00:23:33,545
[chuckles]

491
00:23:33,678 --> 00:23:36,781
Need the extra money.
Woo-hoo! Let's go!

492
00:23:37,715 --> 00:23:39,049
Are you in a relationship?

493
00:23:39,951 --> 00:23:41,853
I'm taken.
In a relationship.

494
00:23:42,988 --> 00:23:44,623
[director] Okay. How long
have you been together?

495
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:47,159
Pretty new.
Less than a month.

496
00:23:47,424 --> 00:23:48,226
First relationship?

497
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:52,196
[director] You're not sure?

498
00:23:53,464 --> 00:23:54,598
Uh... [chuckles]

499
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:58,002
Well, I consider him my
first real boyfriend.

500
00:23:58,135 --> 00:24:01,440
The first one I was only with
for a day

501
00:24:01,573 --> 00:24:02,641
before we had to date long
distance.

502
00:24:02,773 --> 00:24:04,576
Then he ghosted me.

503
00:24:04,709 --> 00:24:06,278
Oh, I smell drama--

504
00:24:06,411 --> 00:24:10,115
No drama.
It's been so long, I'm over it!

505
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:11,583
[director] If you say so!

506
00:24:11,715 --> 00:24:13,617
Okay, Max, just wait there.

507
00:24:14,118 --> 00:24:16,054
We'll call you
when it's your turn again.

508
00:24:16,654 --> 00:24:17,556
Is she done, Director?

509
00:24:17,689 --> 00:24:18,423
[director] She's done for now.

510
00:24:21,792 --> 00:24:22,827
[assistant]
We'll call you again later.

511
00:24:24,663 --> 00:24:25,696
Just sit there.

512
00:24:36,473 --> 00:24:40,244
[indistinct social chatter]

513
00:24:41,645 --> 00:24:42,446
Deib!

514
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:43,515
[Cong. Araneta]
Nice to see you!

515
00:24:43,647 --> 00:24:44,481
Sir.

516
00:24:44,615 --> 00:24:46,183
[laughs] You're early!

517
00:24:46,317 --> 00:24:47,719
- [Deib] Yeah.
- [Cong. Araneta] Hi!

518
00:24:47,853 --> 00:24:48,987
Happy birthday, sir!

519
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:50,922
My goodness, look at you!

520
00:24:51,455 --> 00:24:52,223
It's for you.

521
00:24:52,356 --> 00:24:54,092
Thank you!
I bet I know what this is.

522
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:56,294
[both laugh]

523
00:24:56,528 --> 00:24:57,996
It's been too long...

524
00:24:58,462 --> 00:25:01,566
What, since Kim
went to the States?

525
00:25:02,133 --> 00:25:03,567
Yeah, I believe so.

526
00:25:03,701 --> 00:25:07,771
Yeah, but I'm updated with your
life.

527
00:25:07,905 --> 00:25:10,107
Kim doesn't stop talking about
you.

528
00:25:10,241 --> 00:25:11,142
You know that.

529
00:25:11,276 --> 00:25:11,910
Does she?

530
00:25:12,277 --> 00:25:15,480
She also told me
about your case in school.

531
00:25:16,847 --> 00:25:19,683
Your family helped build that
school.

532
00:25:19,817 --> 00:25:21,720
How dare they do that!

533
00:25:22,621 --> 00:25:26,691
Hey, if you need a lawyer,
you should sue them!

534
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:28,393
I've got a lot of lawyer friends

535
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:29,493
I can introduce you to--

536
00:25:29,627 --> 00:25:31,596
It's okay, sir. It's fine.

537
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:32,564
Thank you though.

538
00:25:32,696 --> 00:25:35,299
The school is going overboard.

539
00:25:35,432 --> 00:25:37,903
You were just having fun.

540
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:40,070
Harmless pranks, my son!

541
00:25:40,571 --> 00:25:41,873
Anyway, come!

542
00:25:42,007 --> 00:25:44,576
I want to introduce you
to some people here.

543
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:48,046
Of course, you know my
chief of staff, that's Aldrin.

544
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:50,347
And this is Mr. Sandico.

545
00:25:51,215 --> 00:25:53,351
He will be investing in
Buenavista.

546
00:25:53,484 --> 00:25:55,019
-[Kim] Oh my gosh!
-[Cong. Araneta] He's gonna
put--

547
00:25:55,153 --> 00:25:56,121
Grandpa!

548
00:25:56,253 --> 00:25:57,021
Oh my gosh!

549
00:25:57,154 --> 00:25:58,722
-Darling!
-You're hogging Deib again!

550
00:25:58,856 --> 00:26:00,959
Hi, everyone!
Sorry, I'm late.

551
00:26:01,092 --> 00:26:02,394
-Yeah, it's okay.
-[guests laughing]

552
00:26:02,527 --> 00:26:03,795
You all know Deib already.

553
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:07,164
Grandpa, we're gonna go
get some food.

554
00:26:07,298 --> 00:26:08,700
-[Deib] Yeah.
-Yeah, he's a growing boy!

555
00:26:08,833 --> 00:26:09,901
Deib's a little hungry!

556
00:26:10,035 --> 00:26:10,567
-Go ahead.
-Yeah!

557
00:26:10,701 --> 00:26:11,635
But wait!

558
00:26:11,769 --> 00:26:13,471
You'll be staying until after
dinner

559
00:26:13,605 --> 00:26:14,940
because you'll tell me

560
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:16,708
all about your championship,
okay?

561
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:17,875
Okay, okay.

562
00:26:18,009 --> 00:26:18,843
[chuckles] Yes, sir!

563
00:26:18,977 --> 00:26:19,844
[Kim] See you later!

564
00:26:19,978 --> 00:26:20,778
[Cong. Araneta]
Have fun, guys!

565
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:22,247
[whispers]
Glad you showed up already.

566
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,648
I didn't want to lie to those
guys.

567
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:29,354
Sorry, I had to change
my whole look.

568
00:26:29,487 --> 00:26:31,155
Grandpa didn't like my original
dress.

569
00:26:31,288 --> 00:26:34,326
He still wants me to look like
I'm 12 years old.

570
00:26:34,459 --> 00:26:35,160
[Deib chuckles]

571
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:36,560
This is fine.

572
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:39,130
[laughs] Seriously?

573
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:40,932
You're really hungry

574
00:26:41,066 --> 00:26:43,300
if you think this is
a good look on me.

575
00:26:43,867 --> 00:26:44,669
No.

576
00:26:45,903 --> 00:26:47,404
-[Kim] No!
-[both laugh fondly]

577
00:26:48,506 --> 00:26:49,441
[clappers click]

578
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:50,909
[director] Tell me your name.

579
00:26:51,409 --> 00:26:52,410
Randall Echavez.

580
00:26:52,876 --> 00:26:54,346
High school senior.
Southbay.

581
00:26:55,012 --> 00:26:56,548
[director] It's your first time,
right?

582
00:26:56,681 --> 00:26:58,282
Tell us why you're doing this.

583
00:26:59,049 --> 00:27:00,518
I need the money

584
00:27:02,086 --> 00:27:03,954
to help a family member.

585
00:27:04,088 --> 00:27:07,358
[director] You have a
girlfriend? Boyfriend?

586
00:27:07,826 --> 00:27:08,393
[sighs]

587
00:27:09,928 --> 00:27:11,096
Ex-girlfriend.

588
00:27:11,229 --> 00:27:13,932
Oh. Why did you break up?

589
00:27:19,636 --> 00:27:20,971
My fault.

590
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,509
I became distant from her

591
00:27:27,545 --> 00:27:29,681
and the rest of the world
when I got depressed.

592
00:27:30,714 --> 00:27:31,782
[RJ] When I came back to her,

593
00:27:31,915 --> 00:27:33,218
she didn't want me anymore.

594
00:27:33,351 --> 00:27:34,986
[director] But you still love
her?

595
00:27:35,886 --> 00:27:36,988
I still love her,

596
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:40,125
but I shouldn't anymore.

597
00:27:40,858 --> 00:27:42,460
[director] She's with someone
now?

598
00:27:43,761 --> 00:27:44,729
Yes.

599
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:49,233
And for her,
what we had was nothing.

600
00:27:51,135 --> 00:27:53,070
Maybe that's why
she moved on so fast.

601
00:27:53,872 --> 00:27:55,272
[director] Randall and Max

602
00:27:55,406 --> 00:27:56,875
both have drama with their exes!

603
00:27:57,608 --> 00:27:59,277
[director] Okay, Randall.
Stay there.

604
00:27:59,644 --> 00:28:00,077
Max?

605
00:28:00,211 --> 00:28:01,278
[assistant] Max...

606
00:28:01,413 --> 00:28:03,480
[director]
Max, stand beside Randall.

607
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:08,185
Okay Max,

608
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:09,653
meet Randall.

609
00:28:09,788 --> 00:28:11,722
Randall, meet Max.

610
00:28:12,423 --> 00:28:13,991
Uhm...

611
00:28:14,625 --> 00:28:15,559
See...

612
00:28:16,894 --> 00:28:18,128
We know each other.

613
00:28:18,496 --> 00:28:18,997
What?

614
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:19,730
[staff gasp, chatter]

615
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:20,964
You know each other?!

616
00:28:21,432 --> 00:28:23,601
[director] We need strangers!

617
00:28:23,734 --> 00:28:25,135
You're friends?

618
00:28:26,671 --> 00:28:30,008
Don't tell me you're exes!

619
00:28:30,141 --> 00:28:33,611
[director] Really?
That's crazy!

620
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:37,315
[director] This is good.
I got an idea!

621
00:28:39,183 --> 00:28:42,487
Thank you.
For doing this.

622
00:28:42,619 --> 00:28:44,055
It means a lot to me.

623
00:28:44,689 --> 00:28:45,722
[Kim sighs]

624
00:28:45,856 --> 00:28:51,096
You know how much I hate
being alone in a big crowd.

625
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:53,298
Yeah, I know.

626
00:28:53,897 --> 00:28:58,869
It's weird, for someone
who loves standing out

627
00:28:59,403 --> 00:29:01,372
and drawing attention to
herself,

628
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:04,409
you hate being alone in big
crowds.

629
00:29:04,942 --> 00:29:08,246
I thought you liked it
when people looked at you.

630
00:29:09,814 --> 00:29:15,553
I don't like being looked at.

631
00:29:16,354 --> 00:29:21,826
But I do want to be seen
for who I truly am.

632
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,295
Like, really seen.

633
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:27,565
I thought that you saw me,

634
00:29:28,165 --> 00:29:29,400
the real me,

635
00:29:29,534 --> 00:29:32,903
and understood me,
and got me...

636
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:36,840
but based on your reaction just
now,

637
00:29:38,108 --> 00:29:40,878
well, maybe that's the reason
why

638
00:29:41,011 --> 00:29:42,713
we're not together anymore.

639
00:29:42,846 --> 00:29:45,750
[soft piano music playing]

640
00:29:46,217 --> 00:29:49,586
Nobody likes being alone anyway.

641
00:29:51,021 --> 00:29:52,289
You, especially.

642
00:30:00,397 --> 00:30:02,166
Why are you helping me, Kim?

643
00:30:05,369 --> 00:30:08,772
You didn't want to at first.

644
00:30:10,942 --> 00:30:12,109
What changed?

645
00:30:14,444 --> 00:30:19,550
At first, I thought that by

646
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:23,820
not seeing you and Max
being all sweet

647
00:30:23,954 --> 00:30:25,155
and in love with each other

648
00:30:25,923 --> 00:30:28,792
every single day,
it would be easier for me.

649
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:33,897
If you didn't see each other
everyday,

650
00:30:34,031 --> 00:30:35,232
Max would be miserable.

651
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,268
You'd be miserable.

652
00:30:37,402 --> 00:30:43,141
Then I figured if you're
kicked out of Benison,

653
00:30:43,575 --> 00:30:46,144
I won't be able to see you
every single day...

654
00:30:47,211 --> 00:30:51,915
and I'd also be miserable.

655
00:30:54,085 --> 00:30:55,819
[photographer] Hey guys!
Say cheese!

656
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:58,455
[camera clicking]

657
00:30:59,123 --> 00:31:01,659
Come on, don't be shy!
I don't bite.

658
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:03,961
Loosen up, Deib.

659
00:31:04,095 --> 00:31:05,663
[photographer] One more.
Closer this time.

660
00:31:07,231 --> 00:31:08,333
[photographer]
You look good together!

661
00:31:10,268 --> 00:31:11,134
[camera clicking]

662
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:12,237
[photographer] Perfect!

663
00:31:12,369 --> 00:31:15,940
[director] Perfect!
That was un-EX-pected!

664
00:31:16,074 --> 00:31:18,041
But we came up
with something better!

665
00:31:18,476 --> 00:31:21,378
[director] This is
"Truth or Dare, Ex Edition".

666
00:31:21,511 --> 00:31:24,915
You take turns asking questions

667
00:31:25,048 --> 00:31:26,116
written on the white cards.

668
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:30,221
If you don't want to ask
or answer the question,

669
00:31:30,654 --> 00:31:33,924
you have to do the dare
on the yellow card.

670
00:31:34,325 --> 00:31:35,226
Got it?

671
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:37,961
Okay, let's take this!
It's gonna be fun!

672
00:31:38,096 --> 00:31:39,163
Action!

673
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:41,398
- [Max] You go first--
- [RJ] Ladies first--

674
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:44,234
Okay, I'll go first.

675
00:31:45,002 --> 00:31:45,936
[clears throat]

676
00:31:48,405 --> 00:31:50,741
Did you cry when we broke up?

677
00:31:53,243 --> 00:31:54,645
When you ghosted me?

678
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:58,316
Yes.
You have no idea.

679
00:31:59,182 --> 00:32:00,417
[Max sighs]

680
00:32:03,153 --> 00:32:05,423
Oh! This is juicy!

681
00:32:11,162 --> 00:32:13,263
Can you imagine
how we'd be like today

682
00:32:13,397 --> 00:32:15,266
if we didn't break up?

683
00:32:21,806 --> 00:32:22,941
Yes.

684
00:32:25,042 --> 00:32:26,310
Often.

685
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,314
You?

686
00:32:30,682 --> 00:32:32,517
Why are you asking me that too?

687
00:32:33,017 --> 00:32:34,384
Let's go to the next question.

688
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:36,520
Ooh!

689
00:32:41,092 --> 00:32:42,093
I won't ask this.

690
00:32:42,426 --> 00:32:43,493
You won't answer anyway.

691
00:32:43,627 --> 00:32:45,529
Why?
What's the question?

692
00:32:48,031 --> 00:32:48,865
Get a yellow card--

693
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,568
Wait! What's the question?
We want to know.

694
00:32:52,369 --> 00:32:53,604
[Max sighs]

695
00:32:56,039 --> 00:32:58,343
Describe the first time
you kissed each other.

696
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:00,912
Just get a yellow card!
Hurry!

697
00:33:01,045 --> 00:33:02,880
They don't wanna answer,
my gosh!

698
00:33:05,982 --> 00:33:07,250
Slow dance with each other.

699
00:33:07,384 --> 00:33:10,755
Oh, I have the perfect
song for this! Okay!

700
00:33:10,887 --> 00:33:11,722
You don't wanna?

701
00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:15,026
Should I just ask the question?

702
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:17,394
-["Nag-iisa" by Zion playing]
-[director] So, let's play
this...

703
00:33:17,528 --> 00:33:19,529
Ready, Max? Randall?

704
00:33:41,051 --> 00:33:46,523
â™ª Countless people in the
World yet I met you â™ª

705

â™ª You're the beat of my heart â™ª

706
00:33:53,765 --> 00:34:03,740
â™ª I thought you were my destiny
â™ª

707
00:34:05,143 --> 00:34:10,347
â™ª But now you're gone â™ª

708
00:34:10,481 --> 00:34:14,518
â™ª I'm here alone â™ª

709
00:34:14,652 --> 00:34:24,628
â™ª All alone â™ª

710
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:58,096
You have a ride?

711
00:35:00,164 --> 00:35:01,865
You don't need to give me one.

712
00:35:06,269 --> 00:35:07,170
Here.

713
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:13,610
For Uncle Boyet.

714
00:35:14,846 --> 00:35:15,713
Huh?

715
00:35:17,014 --> 00:35:20,485
He needs the money.
That's why I did this.

716
00:35:25,255 --> 00:35:26,456
Thank you.

717
00:35:27,824 --> 00:35:29,559
I'll pay you back soon.

718
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:33,931
It's not a loan, Max.

719
00:35:35,565 --> 00:35:36,867
I'm helping out.

720
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:41,505
RJ...

721
00:35:43,306 --> 00:35:46,543
What I said earlier...

722
00:35:48,713 --> 00:35:50,581
I just said it because--

723
00:35:51,882 --> 00:35:54,485
Wait!
Wait, let me explain--

724
00:35:54,918 --> 00:35:57,155
[Max] How did we come to this?

725
00:36:07,164 --> 00:36:08,498
I hate you, Max.

726
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:10,768
I hate you.

727
00:36:12,335 --> 00:36:13,603
It hurts, Max.

728
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:16,072
It hurts that everything we
went through together

729
00:36:16,206 --> 00:36:17,041
means nothing to you.

730
00:36:17,608 --> 00:36:20,478
Wait, why are you blaming me?!

731
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:22,079
Was I the one who left?!

732
00:36:22,445 --> 00:36:24,047
Was I the one who disappeared?!

733
00:36:24,815 --> 00:36:27,552
You acted like everything
we had meant nothing!

734
00:36:30,454 --> 00:36:31,489
You...

735
00:36:32,722 --> 00:36:35,559
You broke my heart!

736
00:36:36,594 --> 00:36:38,028
And I regret that!

737
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:41,364
That's why I wanted to be
friends, remember?

738
00:36:41,498 --> 00:36:43,099
You took that back, remember?

739
00:36:44,001 --> 00:36:44,936
Right?

740
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:47,237
You said you don't want to be
friends!

741
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:49,039
Yes because I still love you!

742
00:36:53,277 --> 00:36:55,780
Because I can never treat
what we had like nothing!

743
00:36:55,913 --> 00:36:57,681
[heartwrenching music begins]

744
00:36:57,815 --> 00:37:00,784
Yes, we were only together
for a day,

745
00:37:01,318 --> 00:37:02,987
but even if we were far away,

746
00:37:03,621 --> 00:37:05,188
you're my girlfriend
and I was your boyfriend!

747
00:37:06,123 --> 00:37:07,757
That one day was real!

748
00:37:10,393 --> 00:37:12,163
The days that followed were
real!

749
00:37:13,197 --> 00:37:13,764
What?!

750
00:37:14,297 --> 00:37:17,635
Because you chose Enrile,
I don't count anymore?

751
00:37:22,539 --> 00:37:23,940
Someday, Max,

752
00:37:24,675 --> 00:37:27,978
I'll love someone else.

753
00:37:29,614 --> 00:37:32,483
And if she asks me
if I had a girlfriend,

754
00:37:33,016 --> 00:37:35,853
I wouldn't hesitate to say that

755
00:37:37,021 --> 00:37:39,123
you were my first girlfriend,
Max.

756
00:37:41,891 --> 00:37:43,693
You are my first girlfriend.

757
00:37:48,798 --> 00:37:50,134
I broke your heart?

758
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:55,139
You're still breaking mine.

759
00:37:57,942 --> 00:37:59,643
That's why I hate you.

760
00:38:05,849 --> 00:38:11,021
[heartwrenching music swells]

761
00:38:40,918 --> 00:38:42,952
[Deib] Kim was surprisingly
well-behaved.

762
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,121
We got along well.

763
00:38:46,289 --> 00:38:50,994
Ironic how Kim seems
to be on top of things,

764
00:38:51,128 --> 00:38:54,699
but her whole life is
dictated by her grandpa.

765
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:58,001
MOO!

766
00:38:59,402 --> 00:39:00,237
You okay?

767
00:39:02,706 --> 00:39:04,007
Yeah.

768
00:39:04,775 --> 00:39:06,077
What's that about Kim?

769
00:39:07,378 --> 00:39:08,346
You're not okay.

770
00:39:09,213 --> 00:39:10,146
What's the problem?

771
00:39:12,583 --> 00:39:16,286
Deib, about that
side hustle yesterday...

772
00:39:18,255 --> 00:39:19,422
The pay okay?

773
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:21,958
Yeah, 10K.

774
00:39:22,726 --> 00:39:25,096
Was it fun?
How did it go?

775
00:39:26,664 --> 00:39:27,864
[sighs]

776
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:29,967
Randall was there.

777
00:39:30,768 --> 00:39:32,036
We were--

778
00:39:32,503 --> 00:39:33,737
Echavez?!

779
00:39:34,605 --> 00:39:35,373
Did you know he was gonna be
there?

780
00:39:35,505 --> 00:39:36,172
No.

781
00:39:36,306 --> 00:39:37,742
We were both surprised--

782
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:41,112
["Beethoven's Fifth Symphony"

783
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,014
Sh*t! My dad's calling.

784
00:39:47,351 --> 00:39:48,184
Dad?

785
00:39:52,322 --> 00:39:53,224
Okay.

786
00:39:53,556 --> 00:39:55,092
I'll be there now.
Okay.

787
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:57,360
I have to go. Sorry.

788
00:40:01,264 --> 00:40:03,800
- [door opens]
- [monitor beeping]

789
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:07,538
Mom!

790
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:08,472
Hi, baby!

791
00:40:12,275 --> 00:40:13,043
Hi, Dad.

792
00:40:15,112 --> 00:40:16,347
[Deib] How was your flight?

793
00:40:17,681 --> 00:40:18,449
Fine.

794
00:40:20,351 --> 00:40:22,786
Care to explain to me
why you're being subjected

795
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,021
to a formal inquiry in school?

796
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:28,992
Uhm...

797
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:30,960
about that...

798
00:40:34,431 --> 00:40:35,699
a parent complained...

799
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:41,172
Hon, this parent is complaining
that her daughter

800
00:40:41,304 --> 00:40:46,443
was punished unfairly
while Deib got off scot-free.

801
00:40:46,577 --> 00:40:48,144
But, I don't know.

802
00:40:49,313 --> 00:40:50,146
[Daniel] Hmm.

803
00:40:51,882 --> 00:40:55,286
If my father were alive today,

804
00:40:56,820 --> 00:41:00,157
he'd get a heart attack from
shame.

805
00:41:01,958 --> 00:41:05,628
Imagine: his grandson is the
number one delinquent

806
00:41:05,762 --> 00:41:07,530
at the school he built.

807
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:14,137
It never crossed your mind
how your behavior

808
00:41:14,271 --> 00:41:17,507
could easily destroy this
family's name and legacy?

809
00:41:19,342 --> 00:41:20,510
I'm sorry, Dad.

810
00:41:20,643 --> 00:41:22,847
Sorry is not enough, Deib.

811
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:26,182
I know, I'm sorry.

812
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:29,820
I've changed.

813
00:41:30,554 --> 00:41:31,489
Yeah.

814
00:41:32,456 --> 00:41:33,324
Maybe.

815
00:41:33,724 --> 00:41:35,592
But you can't change the past.

816
00:41:35,726 --> 00:41:38,027
You can't undo what you've done.

817
00:41:38,929 --> 00:41:43,534
So, whatever verdict
you get at your trial,

818
00:41:44,601 --> 00:41:46,103
you just have to accept it.

819
00:41:46,804 --> 00:41:49,940
Because I will not appeal
the decision.

820
00:41:51,375 --> 00:41:55,211
If they decide on expulsion,
then you...

821
00:41:56,045 --> 00:41:57,815
are expelled.

822
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:00,284
You understand, Deib?

823
00:42:01,452 --> 00:42:02,418
Yes, Dad.

824
00:42:02,552 --> 00:42:05,389
[dramatic music playing]

825
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:19,103
[Tob's voice] I love you...
I love you...

826
00:42:19,235 --> 00:42:23,172
I love you...
I love you...

827
00:42:27,811 --> 00:42:29,045
You can do this, Michiko.

828
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:30,614
You'll pass.

829
00:42:31,581 --> 00:42:32,550
You can do this.

830
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:34,617
I can do this.

831
00:42:36,519 --> 00:42:37,621
Hi, Ms. Tarranza.

832
00:42:37,755 --> 00:42:39,322
You'll be taking four tests
today.

833
00:42:39,456 --> 00:42:41,824
You will have 30 minutes for
each test.

834
00:42:41,958 --> 00:42:42,860
Are you ready?

835
00:42:49,967 --> 00:42:50,568
Thank you.

836
00:42:50,701 --> 00:42:51,367
Good luck!

837
00:42:53,570 --> 00:42:54,438
[deep breath]

838
00:43:03,614 --> 00:43:05,583
We'll start in ten minutes.

839
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:07,885
There are two cases
that will be heard today.

840
00:43:08,018 --> 00:43:09,887
The case against Deib Enrile

841
00:43:10,019 --> 00:43:12,889
and the reconsideration
of Elle Luna's expulsion.

842
00:43:16,025 --> 00:43:17,728
Hi, Elle. How are you?

843
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:18,896
I'll just talk to the board
members.

844
00:43:19,028 --> 00:43:20,230
[Maxim] Excuse me.

845
00:43:21,965 --> 00:43:23,900
I feel like everyone's looking
at me,

846
00:43:24,034 --> 00:43:25,568
judging me.

847
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:31,275
Elle, don't think that.
I'm here for you.

848
00:43:35,346 --> 00:43:36,447
[Macy] Hmm.

849
00:43:38,681 --> 00:43:39,483
Hi, baby.

850
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:40,483
Hi, Mom.

851
00:43:40,617 --> 00:43:41,751
Hi, Aunt Macy.

852
00:43:42,552 --> 00:43:45,255
Auntie, just tell me if
there's something I can do

853
00:43:45,389 --> 00:43:47,190
to help Elle come back to
Benison.

854
00:43:47,858 --> 00:43:50,226
If you can show that Deib

855
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:52,663
deserves to be expelled
more than Elle,

856
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:54,565
that would be great.

857
00:43:55,498 --> 00:43:56,532
Better yet,

858
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:58,235
maybe you should find a way

859
00:43:58,369 --> 00:44:01,105
to get yourself expelled, too.

860
00:44:07,911 --> 00:44:08,811
[Deib breathes deeply]

861
00:44:08,945 --> 00:44:10,179
Good afternoon,

862
00:44:11,681 --> 00:44:13,217
my fellow classmates,

863
00:44:14,184 --> 00:44:16,652
parents, the board...

864
00:44:21,557 --> 00:44:24,894
I am sincerely sorry
for all that I have done

865
00:44:25,561 --> 00:44:29,099
that has caused harm to
many of my classmates.

866
00:44:29,733 --> 00:44:31,068
I have no excuses,

867
00:44:31,534 --> 00:44:34,672
nothing to justify my behavior.

868
00:44:35,271 --> 00:44:36,940
I was not bullied by another.

869
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:39,742
I was not doing it
to get any attention

870
00:44:40,309 --> 00:44:41,844
nor was I lashing out

871
00:44:41,978 --> 00:44:43,547
because I had a lot of problems

872
00:44:44,081 --> 00:44:45,181
at home.

873
00:44:47,384 --> 00:44:50,320
I did it because I could.

874
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:52,289
I did it because it was fun.

875
00:44:53,222 --> 00:44:55,958
I bullied because
it made me feel like

876
00:44:56,092 --> 00:44:59,096
I had some sort of power
over everyone.

877
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:03,266
Again, I am sincerely sorry.

878
00:45:04,001 --> 00:45:05,436
I hope that you'd forgive me
and allow me

879
00:45:05,568 --> 00:45:08,204
to make it up to you guys
in any way possible.

880
00:45:09,139 --> 00:45:11,742
Whatever the board's decision
may be,

881
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:14,744
I will respect and abide by it.

882
00:45:16,012 --> 00:45:16,880
Thank you.

883
00:45:17,181 --> 00:45:19,048
That's good to hear, Mr. Enrile.

884
00:45:19,182 --> 00:45:20,184
Because I don't believe that

885
00:45:20,317 --> 00:45:22,286
bullying should be tolerated.

886
00:45:22,719 --> 00:45:24,054
In my opinion,

887
00:45:24,188 --> 00:45:26,556
you really deserve
to be expelled.

888
00:45:27,356 --> 00:45:30,027
Ma'am, if we follow that logic,

889
00:45:30,159 --> 00:45:31,427
we will be having trials

890
00:45:31,561 --> 00:45:33,362
for almost everyone in our
school,

891
00:45:33,496 --> 00:45:37,300
in our batch, and all of
them will be expelled.

892
00:45:37,434 --> 00:45:39,737
This will be the first time
in Benison's history

893
00:45:39,869 --> 00:45:40,804
to have just what--

894
00:45:40,938 --> 00:45:42,739
four students graduate?

895
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:44,907
Precisely.

896
00:45:45,041 --> 00:45:46,175
And that's exactly why

897
00:45:46,309 --> 00:45:48,579
I think we can all agree that

898
00:45:49,045 --> 00:45:51,148
Deib deserves to face
some consequence

899
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:52,382
for his past actions,

900
00:45:52,516 --> 00:45:55,418
but he doesn't deserve to be
expelled.

901
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:57,920
What's the proper
punishment for someone

902
00:45:58,054 --> 00:45:59,922
who not only bullied
other students

903
00:46:00,056 --> 00:46:01,891
but even made it seem cool

904
00:46:02,025 --> 00:46:03,793
to join him in his pranks?

905
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:06,896
Yes. It became part of the
culture here in Benison.

906
00:46:07,364 --> 00:46:10,701
Aimee Jung, Choco Funtales,
and Elle Luna

907
00:46:10,833 --> 00:46:12,235
organized a prank that

908
00:46:12,369 --> 00:46:14,003
landed someone in the hospital

909
00:46:14,137 --> 00:46:17,074
because Deib influenced
them to do it.

910
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:20,344
Also, I find it unfair
that those three students

911
00:46:20,476 --> 00:46:22,579
got expelled but Mr. Enrile,

912
00:46:22,713 --> 00:46:25,114
who has a longer list of
infractions,

913
00:46:25,516 --> 00:46:28,452
never even received
any disciplinary action.

914
00:46:29,052 --> 00:46:30,987
I think expulsion

915
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:33,157
is the only proper
course of action.

916
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:34,690
[board member 1] I agree.

917
00:46:35,391 --> 00:46:36,726
[board member 2] So do I.

918
00:46:37,393 --> 00:46:39,596
[Headmaster] I think
the board is ready

919
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:41,264
to decide on this matter.

920
00:46:41,398 --> 00:46:44,067
[audience whispering]

921
00:46:44,201 --> 00:46:51,307
[dramatic music playing]

922
00:46:56,547 --> 00:46:59,583
[dramatic music continues]

923
00:47:19,536 --> 00:47:21,438
Apologize to those you bullied.

924
00:47:21,572 --> 00:47:22,539
[Deib] But sir, what if
that's not enough?

925
00:47:22,672 --> 00:47:23,974
What if they don't forgive me?

926
00:47:24,106 --> 00:47:26,309
Stop making excuses!

927
00:47:26,443 --> 00:47:28,110
Stop fighting and listen to me!

928
00:47:28,579 --> 00:47:31,148
I volunteered to lend him money.

929
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:33,115
You're so naive.

930
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:35,751
First this fake PI
that has scammed you.

931
00:47:35,885 --> 00:47:38,088
Now this Uncle Boyet will surely

932
00:47:38,222 --> 00:47:39,623
take off with your money, too!

933
00:47:39,755 --> 00:47:42,992
You better pray the PI
didn't get anything on us

934
00:47:43,126 --> 00:47:44,327
and give it to the family.

935
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:45,528
[Tiago] Because if he did,

936
00:47:45,661 --> 00:47:47,831
Boss will come
after the family next.

937
00:47:47,965 --> 00:47:49,532
-[punching sounds from call]
-Deib, hello? Hello?

938
00:47:49,666 --> 00:47:51,934
-[grunts and punches]
-[man] Hold him!

939
00:47:52,068 --> 00:47:53,903
Deib, what's going on?!
