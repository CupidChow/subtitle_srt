[Maxim] And he's been getting
away with his bullying!

00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,139
He deserves to be expelled!

a formal inquiry

Kid, where are you?

50

At church.

51
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,259
[Max] Why, Uncle Boyet?

52
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:17,296
You alone? It's late.

I'm with Deib.

00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:22,268
Huh?

You hurt?

00:03:26,038 --> 00:03:27,606
I'm okay, Uncle.

Are you okay?
Is there something wrong?

We were here...

90
00:05:12,644 --> 00:05:14,447
I think we were getting married.

Married? Already?

I know, I know.

93
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:21,754
People would say
we're too young

to even be dreaming
about marriage.

We're just kids,

96
00:05:26,725 --> 00:05:31,430
we shouldn't be too serious
about love and the future.

00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:41,139
the fact
that I almost lost my brother,

how I'm in the middle of

who hurt my brother Dale...

00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,755

because after all that happened,

worth having

186
00:11:37,529 --> 00:11:38,898
Be careful, bro.

187
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:52,878
Alright,

188
00:11:53,778 --> 00:11:54,480
recording!

189
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:55,181
Yeah!

190
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:56,315
How do I look?

191
00:11:57,615 --> 00:11:58,250
Good!

192
00:11:59,684 --> 00:12:00,285
Okay.

193
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:06,625
In 1997, when he was just
an ordinary Benison student,

194
00:12:07,225 --> 00:12:09,461
Johann Gonzales
created his first mural...

195
00:12:10,361 --> 00:12:11,263
on this wall.

196
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:13,399
It was a painting about love,

197
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,369
for a girl who did not
even know that a boy loved her.

198
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:19,270
[Lee] The mural is gone now,

199
00:12:19,404 --> 00:12:22,408
painted over when the school
was renovated 20 years ago.

200
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:25,410
If 20 years ago,
everyone knew that Johann

201
00:12:25,543 --> 00:12:27,613
would turn into
a world-renowned artist,

202
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:29,581
would they have erased
his mural?

203
00:12:29,914 --> 00:12:31,250
Or would they have
preserved it?

204
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:34,787
Art and love
are the same that way.

205
00:12:35,653 --> 00:12:37,490
[Lee] You sometimes
don't know what it is

206
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:39,390
or how beautiful it is,

207
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,061
until it's gone.

208
00:12:45,563 --> 00:12:46,532
Was that too much?

209
00:12:47,232 --> 00:12:48,600
I just thought of it suddenly.

210
00:12:49,668 --> 00:12:51,437
Were my words too dramatic?

211
00:12:52,238 --> 00:12:55,307
No, no.
They were beautiful.

212
00:12:55,707 --> 00:12:56,442
Deep.

213
00:12:57,308 --> 00:12:58,878
I thought you were gonna say
it's artsy-fartsy.

214
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:03,048
I could imagine
that would be Naih's reaction.

215
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:06,684
It's nice to have someone
that takes what I say seriously

216
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,221
and doesn't turn everything
into a joke.

217
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:13,392
So thanks, Ysay.

218
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:16,261
[phone pings]

219
00:13:16,394 --> 00:13:16,995
Wait.

220
00:13:20,698 --> 00:13:21,966
It's a message from Johann.

221
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:22,567
Huh?

222
00:13:23,201 --> 00:13:25,471
He was so impressed with us that

223
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:28,139
he saved a slot for both of us
at Forever Art Camp!

224
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:29,207
What?!

225
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:31,309
Oh my gosh, I've been
waiting so long to join!

226
00:13:31,442 --> 00:13:31,844
Congrats!

227
00:13:31,976 --> 00:13:33,044
Congrats to us!

Can't wait!

Congrats!

231

[Lee]
At art camp, imagine that?!

232
00:13:44,789 --> 00:13:46,091
I can't wait.

233
00:13:46,225 --> 00:13:47,525
I can't wait to go there!

and fundamentals

from there!

I've been wanting this!

238

[Lee]
I've been wanting to go there.

239
00:13:57,369 --> 00:13:58,504
You know
I've been wanting to learn

240
00:13:58,636 --> 00:14:01,506
how to draw the landscapes
and the emotions.

241
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:04,909
Imagine drawing the landscapes
there, the trees, the mountains!

242
00:14:05,043 --> 00:14:06,412
[Lee] I'm so excited!

243
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:12,551

and medicine for Grandma!

Wow!

247
00:14:20,692 --> 00:14:23,095
Tell him thanks!

248
00:14:26,097 --> 00:14:27,899
Why are you all sweaty?

249
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:30,235
You stink!
I can smell you from here.

250
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:33,239
I don't smell that bad!

251

[Max] Uncle,

252
00:14:36,107 --> 00:14:40,980
thanks for backing us up
at our date with Dad.

253

It's nothing. You know
I'd do anything for you.

254
00:14:47,852 --> 00:14:49,587
Thank you, Uncle. Love you!

255
00:14:49,721 --> 00:14:50,688
Love you, too, kid!

256

Oh.

I'll leave you two.

262
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:13,011
Does his back still hurt?

263
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:15,047
Dad's okay.

264
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:16,615
He got elbowed
'cause you took that game

265

266
00:15:18,716 --> 00:15:19,317

-No. RJ, he said--

I don't wanna be friends
with you.

I don't even know if
we can ever be friends again.

I love him.

288

when you made me feel like

289
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:19,144
I was nothing to you.

311

They're generalizations.

00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:28,881

it's nice because

00:17:29,013 --> 00:17:32,017

of your points for improvement.

You're too nice and beta!

364
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,521
You gotta start fighting
for what you want here!

365
00:20:23,654 --> 00:20:26,290
Quit overthinking, quit
hesitating, and just do it!

366
00:20:26,424 --> 00:20:27,259
Yes, coach!

367
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:28,292
No, seriously!

368
00:20:28,426 --> 00:20:30,362
Like when Max
was breaking up with you,

369
00:20:30,494 --> 00:20:32,763
when she told you
she wanted to be with Deib,

370
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:34,199
what the hell did you do?

371
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:35,601
Let me guess.

372
00:20:35,733 --> 00:20:37,469
You did a sad boi act,
didn't care about your pride,

373
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:40,338
threw your dignity and
self-respect out the window,

374
00:20:40,471 --> 00:20:42,307
and cried
and begged her to stay,

375
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:45,943
"Max, I love you!
Take me back please?"

376
00:20:46,077 --> 00:20:47,346
But in the end, you let her go

377
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:50,481
because you're a nice guy
and you love her, right?

378
00:20:54,385 --> 00:20:55,252
Really?

379
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:57,055
You actually did that?!

380
00:20:58,289 --> 00:20:59,258
See!

381
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:02,961
You suffer
from second lead syndrome.

382
00:21:03,561 --> 00:21:06,964
You're the guy who wants
the girl but never gets her

383
00:21:07,098 --> 00:21:10,134
because you don't fight for her
like your life depends on it.

384
00:21:10,969 --> 00:21:12,770
If it were Deib,
he would have fought with Max

385
00:21:12,903 --> 00:21:15,941
until she gave up
and got back together with him!

386
00:21:16,074 --> 00:21:20,578
And that's exactly what makes
Deib way more attractive to her!

387
00:21:23,981 --> 00:21:25,584
Don't be too nice.

388
00:21:26,684 --> 00:21:27,451
You.

389
00:21:28,686 --> 00:21:30,454
Why don't you try being nice?

390
00:21:34,058 --> 00:21:38,529
Wait! Don't go!
Some guy might harass me again.

391
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:45,436
Didn't you say
I shouldn't be nice?

392
00:21:53,944 --> 00:21:56,515
A parent has filed a formal
complaint against you, Deib.

393
00:21:56,647 --> 00:21:59,451
For all the bullying you did
before I became headmaster.

394
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:01,920
Who, sir?

395
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:04,088
Sorry, it's confidential.

396
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:06,724
[drawer opens]

397
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,528
[drawer closes]

398
00:22:10,561 --> 00:22:12,064
What does this mean?

399
00:22:13,131 --> 00:22:14,066
What's gonna happen?

400
00:22:14,665 --> 00:22:17,102
We will review your case
and conduct an investigation.

401
00:22:18,703 --> 00:22:21,640
Sir, the investigation
will show that I was a bully.

402
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:22,874
Before.

403
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:25,544
But I've changed.

404
00:22:25,977 --> 00:22:26,944
I've changed.

405
00:22:27,078 --> 00:22:31,083
I even apologized publicly
at the student assembly.

406
00:22:31,415 --> 00:22:32,217
I know.

407
00:22:33,117 --> 00:22:33,951
I saw the video.

408
00:22:35,619 --> 00:22:37,088
I wonder
why you were never disciplined

409
00:22:37,221 --> 00:22:39,057
for all the bullying you did.

410
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:43,228
Maybe the previous headmaster
tolerated your actions

411
00:22:43,662 --> 00:22:45,963
because your family founded
Benison, I don't know.

412
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:47,432
But you know,

413
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:49,901
if your grandpa
still ran Benison,

414
00:22:50,367 --> 00:22:53,105
he wouldn't have allowed the
bullying to go on for so long.

415
00:22:53,471 --> 00:22:55,640
He would be fair
and he would sanction you,

416
00:22:55,773 --> 00:22:57,576
even though you're his grandson.

417
00:23:01,413 --> 00:23:03,080
I'm aware. I know.

418
00:23:04,482 --> 00:23:07,085
I'm not gonna avoid
my punishment.

419
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:09,086
Just let me know

420
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,857
if that will be detention,
suspension...

421
00:23:13,491 --> 00:23:15,559
Possibly expulsion.

422
00:23:20,932 --> 00:23:24,068
Friends,
welcome to Project: Save Deib!

423
00:23:24,201 --> 00:23:25,737
I the Lorde be with you!

424
00:23:26,104 --> 00:23:27,638
Wait! Where's Deib?

425
00:23:28,205 --> 00:23:29,708
Why isn't he here?

426
00:23:30,474 --> 00:23:31,742
Plausible deniability.

427
00:23:31,876 --> 00:23:34,045
Just in case we get caught,

428
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:36,781
Deib can honestly say
he's not part of this.

429
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:37,348
Yup!

430
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,250
He's already in enough trouble
as it is.

431
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:41,720
Lorde has come up
with a list of students

432
00:23:41,853 --> 00:23:44,789
Deib bullied
as well as their parents.

433
00:23:45,624 --> 00:23:48,359
Our first step
is to find who the parent is

434
00:23:48,794 --> 00:23:50,828
and convince them
to withdraw the complaint.

435
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:52,696
Madam Max,

436
00:23:53,397 --> 00:23:54,766
I feel like it's your dad.

437
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:58,804
He'll be the happiest if
Master is kicked out of Benison.

438
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:01,006
True that!

439
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:05,009
I asked Dad if he filed
the complaint, he said no.

440
00:24:05,143 --> 00:24:07,945
I think we can all assume
that the student

441
00:24:08,078 --> 00:24:09,881
who complained to their
parent is not in this room.

442
00:24:10,015 --> 00:24:12,584
What if
we can't solve this mystery?

443
00:24:13,384 --> 00:24:14,451
Or if we do,

444
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:17,955
we can't convince the parent
to withdraw the complaint?

445
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:20,826
There's another way.

446
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:23,428
When Ysay and I
interviewed Johann Gonzales,

447
00:24:23,561 --> 00:24:26,631
he told us that the mural he
painted was judged as vandalism

448
00:24:26,765 --> 00:24:28,532
according
to the student conduct code.

449
00:24:28,666 --> 00:24:29,800
He was supposed to be suspended.

450
00:24:30,134 --> 00:24:30,602
But

451
00:24:30,935 --> 00:24:31,869
he didn't get suspended

452
00:24:32,002 --> 00:24:33,704
after they had a formal inquiry

453
00:24:33,838 --> 00:24:35,606
in front
of the whole student body

454
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,375
and the disciplinary committee,

455
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:38,710
like a court trial.

456
00:24:38,844 --> 00:24:41,246
It was even Headmaster
who defended him.

457
00:24:42,047 --> 00:24:44,915
Headmaster proved that
what Johann did was art,

458
00:24:45,182 --> 00:24:46,151
not vandalism.

459
00:24:46,684 --> 00:24:48,452
So, he wasn't punished.

460
00:24:49,287 --> 00:24:50,489
Oh em!

461
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:53,290
I'm crushing on Headmaster
even more now!

462
00:24:53,424 --> 00:24:55,794
Don't be jealous, Mine.
It's just a crush!

463
00:24:56,126 --> 00:24:56,760
Great!

464
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:59,463
What do we do
to get Deib a trial?

465
00:24:59,597 --> 00:25:04,702
The student body president
has to request the inquiry.

466
00:25:05,269 --> 00:25:06,070
[Migz groans]

467
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:07,972
If I knew this would happen,

468
00:25:08,105 --> 00:25:10,575
I wouldn't have given up
the presidency to Kim!

469
00:25:10,709 --> 00:25:12,376
Maybe Kim would help.

470
00:25:15,346 --> 00:25:17,883
Okay, fine!
Let's think of another way.

471
00:25:18,282 --> 00:25:19,150
I know!

472
00:25:19,651 --> 00:25:21,952
Operation Defecationism part 2!

473
00:25:22,086 --> 00:25:23,788
Lorde,
who are you pranking this time?

474
00:25:23,922 --> 00:25:25,856
And how would that help us?

475
00:25:28,393 --> 00:25:32,163
We'll give Baldy,
I mean Headmaster, diarrhea!

476
00:25:32,631 --> 00:25:36,401
Then when he's in the restroom,
we'll go to his office

477
00:25:36,934 --> 00:25:39,270
and steal
the angry parent's letter!

478
00:25:39,738 --> 00:25:41,105
Sound good?

479
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:42,807
I don't like the part where you
give my crush diarrhea,

480
00:25:42,941 --> 00:25:46,912
but stop me!
That gives me an idea!

481
00:25:47,645 --> 00:25:49,713
[Naih] We need to force
Headmaster out of his office.

482
00:25:49,847 --> 00:25:50,714
[door opens]

483
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:51,715
Mrs. Catalan,

484
00:25:51,849 --> 00:25:53,151
I'm going
to my 3 p.m. appointment.

485
00:25:53,285 --> 00:25:54,486
Yes, sir.

486
00:25:54,986 --> 00:25:57,888
[Naih] Then, we bring him
to the mural wall!

487
00:25:58,022 --> 00:25:59,523
[Ysay] Why would he go there?

488
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:02,259
[Naih] For our history interview
with him!

489
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:03,295
[Headmaster] Okay kids!

490
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:05,596
Why do you want
to do the interview here?

491
00:26:05,963 --> 00:26:10,167
This is part of your history
in Benison, sir!

492
00:26:11,169 --> 00:26:12,237
[chuckles]

493
00:26:12,369 --> 00:26:13,404
How did you know that?

494
00:26:13,538 --> 00:26:17,909
Sir, I'm a certified gossip!
I know a lot of things!

495
00:26:18,042 --> 00:26:19,344
Michiko, what's next?

496
00:26:19,477 --> 00:26:20,412
What's next?

497
00:26:21,479 --> 00:26:24,516
Continue my plan, sis! I have
no idea what happens after.

498
00:26:24,883 --> 00:26:25,616
Wait.

499
00:26:26,451 --> 00:26:27,852
Remember that Headmaster's
secretary will still be there

500
00:26:27,986 --> 00:26:31,522
even when
he's out of his office.

501
00:26:31,655 --> 00:26:32,589
True!

502
00:26:32,723 --> 00:26:35,727
We need to get her out, too,
but how?

503
00:26:35,859 --> 00:26:38,096
Time for
Operation Defecationism!

504
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:39,463
Milk tea again?

505
00:26:47,739 --> 00:26:48,772
[Lorde] We'll put laxatives

506
00:26:48,906 --> 00:26:51,142
in Michiko's cupcakes
for instant LBM.

507
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:52,676
Good afternoon, Mrs. Catalan!

508
00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:54,311
I the Lorde be with you!

509
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:58,115
What's the occasion?

510
00:27:00,585 --> 00:27:01,586
Nothing.

511
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,421
We just want to...

512
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:08,093
thank you for being such a great
secretary to our Headmaster!

513
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:21,806
She'll eat the cupcake
and run to the restroom,

514
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:24,009
then we can go inside
Headmaster's office!

515
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:25,242
Yes!

516
00:27:25,376 --> 00:27:29,146
What if she finishes pooping
before you find the letter?

517
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,414
We need to stall her.

518
00:27:31,148 --> 00:27:31,682
How?

519
00:27:31,982 --> 00:27:33,917
Help! Help!

520
00:27:36,653 --> 00:27:38,623
[Lee] When the secretary
is in the women's bathroom,

521
00:27:38,757 --> 00:27:42,292
we can lock it from the
outside so she can't go back.

522
00:27:42,426 --> 00:27:43,862
[keys jingle]

523
00:27:46,698 --> 00:27:48,098
Where do we get the key?

524
00:27:48,767 --> 00:27:51,068
We need to distract the janitor
and get it from his cart.

525
00:27:51,568 --> 00:27:53,538
What do you say, Ysay?
Let's team up?

526
00:27:55,272 --> 00:27:55,539
Game!

527
00:27:56,473 --> 00:27:57,142
Okay.

528
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:58,276
What do I do?

529
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:00,178
Just make sure that Deib is okay

530
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:01,578
and he doesn't know
what we're doing.

531
00:28:05,983 --> 00:28:07,551
Where is everyone?

532
00:28:08,586 --> 00:28:10,387
Maybe they're busy.

533
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:15,359
This is better, MOO.

534
00:28:16,161 --> 00:28:20,030
I actually want some alone time
before everyone arrives.

535
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:21,365
[sighs]

536
00:28:21,499 --> 00:28:23,367
I need to talk to you
about what might happen if

537
00:28:24,402 --> 00:28:25,537
I get expelled.

538
00:28:25,936 --> 00:28:27,739
Don't worry, Deib.

539
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:29,007
You won't get expelled.

540
00:28:29,507 --> 00:28:31,509
Lee gave us an idea
from the time

541
00:28:31,643 --> 00:28:34,011
Headmaster saved his own
classmate from suspension.

542
00:28:34,144 --> 00:28:35,512
I defended Johann

543
00:28:35,646 --> 00:28:37,682
because what he painted
on this wall was not offensive.

544
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:39,217
He didn't ruin anything.

545
00:28:39,817 --> 00:28:42,653
In fact, the school looked
better with that mural.

546
00:28:43,621 --> 00:28:45,056
Headmaster,

547
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:48,093
isn't it unfair that only Johann
was punished for the mural?

548
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:50,595
Not the one who had it made?

549
00:28:51,362 --> 00:28:53,964
The thing is, Johann has
never told anybody

550
00:28:54,098 --> 00:28:57,067
which of our batchmates
had it made.

551
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:57,868
But

552
00:28:58,336 --> 00:29:00,438
I know who the girl
in the mural is.

553
00:29:01,205 --> 00:29:03,708
Who, sir?
Tell us all about it!

554
00:29:05,009 --> 00:29:06,044
Sir,

555
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:09,213
have you seen
Crash Landing on You ?

556
00:29:09,713 --> 00:29:12,616
You look like Captain Ri!

557
00:29:13,617 --> 00:29:16,019
Ma'am, your vision's definitely
blurred without your glasses!

558
00:29:16,153 --> 00:29:18,021
[janitor] Which classroom
did you lose it?

559
00:29:21,125 --> 00:29:22,126
[Ysay] Well, the thing is...

560
00:29:23,494 --> 00:29:25,930
I can't remember.

561
00:29:26,463 --> 00:29:28,465
[janitor]
I'll ask the other janitors,

562
00:29:28,599 --> 00:29:29,768
maybe they've seen it.

563
00:29:29,901 --> 00:29:30,567
[Ysay]
You don't need to do that!

564
00:29:30,701 --> 00:29:33,304
I don't wanna be a bother.

565
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:34,005
[janitor] It's okay, ma'am.

566
00:29:34,138 --> 00:29:36,840
[Ysay] No need, really!

567
00:29:36,974 --> 00:29:38,076
[mop clatters]

568
00:29:39,144 --> 00:29:40,577
[janitor]
Sir, what are you doing there?

569
00:29:47,218 --> 00:29:48,853
You'll ruin my diet.

570
00:29:48,987 --> 00:29:50,355
-It's okay!
-No need to diet, ma'am!

571
00:29:50,488 --> 00:29:52,323
-You deserve it!
-You're motherly but still sexy!

572
00:29:52,789 --> 00:29:53,958
Come on!

573
00:29:54,092 --> 00:29:56,361
It's delicious, ma'am!

574
00:29:58,663 --> 00:29:59,196
Fine!

575
00:30:08,006 --> 00:30:09,173
But you gotta eat with me!

576
00:30:10,174 --> 00:30:11,542
[both] It's just for you!

577
00:30:11,675 --> 00:30:12,576
Come on!

578
00:30:14,011 --> 00:30:16,446
I won't eat if you won't eat.

579
00:30:18,282 --> 00:30:19,750
[thunder rumbling]

580
00:30:20,184 --> 00:30:21,419
Looks like it's going to rain.

581
00:30:21,553 --> 00:30:22,653
Let's continue this
in my office.

582
00:30:23,054 --> 00:30:23,755
[Naih] No, sir!

583
00:30:23,887 --> 00:30:25,589
[Naih, Michiko] Headmaster!

584
00:30:26,624 --> 00:30:28,425
[janitor]
Sir, what are you doing there?

585
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,060
[janitor]
Sir, what are you doing there?

586
00:30:30,194 --> 00:30:31,729
Looking for the restroom!

587
00:30:31,863 --> 00:30:33,096
[keys jingle]

588
00:30:37,734 --> 00:30:38,502
[Lorde] So yummy!

589
00:30:49,713 --> 00:30:52,717
Headmaster, let's continue
the interview here!

590
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:53,951
No, it's okay!

591
00:30:54,085 --> 00:30:54,919
If it rains, it's better
if we're in my office.

592
00:30:55,053 --> 00:30:56,520
Not now, Karlie!

593
00:30:56,653 --> 00:30:57,355
Message the group!

594
00:30:57,488 --> 00:30:57,888
Oh, yes!

595
00:30:58,021 --> 00:30:58,789
Hurry!

596
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,290
Headmaster, your interview!

597
00:31:00,424 --> 00:31:01,925
Headmaster,
the interview isn't done!

598
00:31:02,059 --> 00:31:03,361
No, we can do it in my office

599
00:31:03,493 --> 00:31:04,929
'cause if it rains, it's gonna
be more comfortable there.

600
00:31:05,063 --> 00:31:06,130
It won't rain!

601
00:31:07,097 --> 00:31:08,499
Why are you annoying
Headmaster?!

602
00:31:08,932 --> 00:31:09,634
Wait, bro!

603
00:31:11,935 --> 00:31:13,837
[school bell ringing]

604
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:20,711
[all gagging, farting]

605
00:31:30,153 --> 00:31:32,022
[Migz] Guys, we had to eat
the cupcakes too! Pooping now!

606
00:31:32,155 --> 00:31:33,191
Ah, crap!

607
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:34,558
What's wrong?

608
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:36,361
Is there a problem, MOO?

609
00:31:36,493 --> 00:31:38,796
Nothing! Stay here.
I'll be right back!

610
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:39,529
Where are you going?

611
00:31:40,765 --> 00:31:43,601
[suspenseful music begins]

612
00:31:47,372 --> 00:31:49,606
Sir, let's go back!

613
00:31:49,874 --> 00:31:51,108
Why are you in such a hurry?!

614
00:31:51,241 --> 00:31:52,509
Karlie, not now!

615
00:31:57,515 --> 00:31:58,782
Sir, it really won't rain!

616
00:31:58,915 --> 00:32:02,119
Yes, Headmaster.
Let's go back to the mural wall.

617
00:32:07,357 --> 00:32:10,428
[squirming, farting]

618
00:32:19,671 --> 00:32:20,371
[keys jingle]

619
00:32:22,874 --> 00:32:24,008
[janitor] Sir, wait!

620
00:32:24,142 --> 00:32:25,410
Go Max, hurry!

621
00:32:31,348 --> 00:32:32,250
[door opens]

622
00:32:34,751 --> 00:32:36,253
[panting]

623
00:32:36,386 --> 00:32:37,622

[phone rings]

625
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:49,767
MOO?

626
00:32:50,067 --> 00:32:50,667
Deib,

627
00:32:51,536 --> 00:32:52,936
where's the complaint letter
hidden?

628
00:32:54,038 --> 00:32:55,173
Max, what's going on?

629
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:57,442
I'll explain later!
Where is it?

630
00:33:01,913 --> 00:33:02,747
Upper-left drawer.

631
00:33:05,148 --> 00:33:05,950
[drawer opens]

632
00:33:18,796 --> 00:33:21,298
[Naih, Michiko]
Let's just go back, Headmaster!

633
00:33:21,432 --> 00:33:23,134
[Headmaster]
Settle down! Settle down!

634
00:33:23,267 --> 00:33:28,705
-[overlapping pleas]
-[school bell ringing]

635
00:33:31,075 --> 00:33:34,444
[Michiko] Whoever
is in the office, EXIT NOW!

636
00:33:35,546 --> 00:33:37,515
[Naih, Michiko]
Let's just go back, Headmaster!

637
00:33:38,148 --> 00:33:39,416
Headmaster!

638
00:33:40,317 --> 00:33:41,752
[Headmaster] Ms. del Valle,

639
00:33:42,252 --> 00:33:44,255
what were you doing
inside my office?

640
00:33:45,522 --> 00:33:47,357
Looking for Michiko, sir.

641
00:33:47,491 --> 00:33:50,528
I thought the interview's here.

642
00:33:54,398 --> 00:33:56,099
Michiko, you left your cupcakes.

643
00:33:56,233 --> 00:33:58,769
They're for Headmaster, right?

644
00:33:59,604 --> 00:34:01,405
Yeah!
Headmaster, this is for you!

645
00:34:01,538 --> 00:34:02,306
Yes!

646
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,740
No thanks.
Cutting back on my sugar.

647
00:34:04,241 --> 00:34:05,843
OMG, no takers?

648
00:34:05,977 --> 00:34:06,778
I'll take them!

649
00:34:08,478 --> 00:34:13,451
[Naih] Go girl! Enjoy!
My gosh, have them all!

650
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:18,588
Should I even ask what happened?

651
00:34:19,389 --> 00:34:22,626
Just know I love you, Master!

652
00:34:23,393 --> 00:34:25,396
I don't get diarrhea
for just anyone!

653
00:34:27,632 --> 00:34:28,065
Max,

654
00:34:28,632 --> 00:34:30,201
after all that effort,

655
00:34:30,601 --> 00:34:32,969
please tell me you know
who wrote that letter.

656
00:34:34,704 --> 00:34:35,239
Yes,

657
00:34:35,972 --> 00:34:37,809
but I don't think
we can convince them

658
00:34:37,942 --> 00:34:38,943
to withdraw the complaint.

659
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:40,010
[Lee] What?

660
00:34:40,143 --> 00:34:41,878
Maybe
we should ask Kim for help.

661
00:34:42,313 --> 00:34:43,514
No, Max.

662
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:46,583
I don't want
to owe her anything.

663
00:34:47,351 --> 00:34:49,786
Who's the parent who complained?

664
00:34:50,188 --> 00:34:51,556
I'll talk to them.
Who?

665
00:34:53,391 --> 00:34:54,358
Aunt Macy.

666
00:34:54,492 --> 00:34:55,760

668
00:35:01,731 --> 00:35:02,199
Migz!

669
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:02,900
What happened to you?

670
00:35:03,034 --> 00:35:04,001
[Migz farts]

671
00:35:04,534 --> 00:35:08,472
-That stinks!
-[Lee] Lorde!

672
00:35:08,873 --> 00:35:10,474
Thanks for updating me, Deib.

673
00:35:11,242 --> 00:35:12,809
Your dad and I
will figure it out.

674
00:35:12,943 --> 00:35:13,878
He's coming home.

675
00:35:14,711 --> 00:35:17,081
We'll set up a meeting
with Max's stepmom,

676
00:35:17,215 --> 00:35:18,983
the headmaster, and the board.

677
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:20,418
Don't worry.

678
00:35:20,918 --> 00:35:21,619
Take care.

679
00:35:22,452 --> 00:35:23,588
I love you.

680
00:35:26,356 --> 00:35:27,791

[suspenseful music plays]

682
00:35:38,369 --> 00:35:39,603
Today's full of bad news.

683
00:35:39,737 --> 00:35:42,039
Please tell me we have good news
about the patient.

684
00:35:42,539 --> 00:35:44,208
Good news, Doc Evita.

685
00:35:44,342 --> 00:35:45,976
The patient
regained his consciousness.

686
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:47,043
Great!

687
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:48,813
Have you asked him for his name?

688
00:35:49,146 --> 00:35:51,782
[nurse] He has memory loss, Doc.

689
00:35:52,048 --> 00:35:54,385
Plus, he can't speak yet.

690
00:35:54,518 --> 00:35:56,086
Well, that's to be expected.

691
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:01,224
Don't worry.

692
00:36:01,858 --> 00:36:03,628
[Evita] We'll take care of you.

693
00:36:04,262 --> 00:36:05,663
You'll get well soon.

694
00:36:16,673 --> 00:36:17,942
Are you okay, Max?

695
00:36:20,077 --> 00:36:20,811
Yes.

696
00:36:23,047 --> 00:36:24,849
When you love someone,

697
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:28,552
you'd do anything for them,
right?

698
00:36:29,686 --> 00:36:31,521
Even if you look like a fool.

699
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:33,824
Despite his objections.

700
00:36:35,492 --> 00:36:36,927
Even if you don't want to.

701
00:36:48,271 --> 00:36:48,739
Kim!

702
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:49,106
Max!

00:36:50,106 --> 00:36:52,976
-[Michiko] Max!
-[Naih] OMG! Stop her! Max!

704
00:36:54,177 --> 00:36:55,179
Yes, Maxpein?

705
00:36:56,213 --> 00:36:57,715
Deib needs your help.

706
00:36:58,315 --> 00:36:59,083
[Max] As president,

707
00:36:59,349 --> 00:37:01,351
you can request a formal inquiry

708
00:37:01,786 --> 00:37:04,722
so Deib can defend himself
and not get expelled.

709
00:37:05,188 --> 00:37:06,923
You want me to help Deib?

710
00:37:08,259 --> 00:37:09,693
Fine. I'll do it.

711
00:37:10,161 --> 00:37:11,228
If you break up with him.

-[Naih] Stop me!
-[Karlie] That's right!

714
00:37:13,197 --> 00:37:13,864
[Kim] You heard me.

715
00:37:14,364 --> 00:37:15,398
Break up with Deib

716
00:37:15,532 --> 00:37:17,068
and I'll make sure
he gets a fair trial.

717
00:37:17,467 --> 00:37:18,768
Girl.

718
00:37:18,902 --> 00:37:21,472
[Naih] Are you crazy?!
You're just looking for a fight!

719
00:37:21,606 --> 00:37:23,541
[Karlie] Ew! Squammy instinct.

720
00:37:23,673 --> 00:37:25,175
Always trying to start a fight!

721
00:37:25,543 --> 00:37:27,945
Aren't you the instigator here?!

722
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,614
Naih, Migz, calm down.

723
00:37:30,447 --> 00:37:31,916
Kim,

724
00:37:32,048 --> 00:37:34,217
do I really need to breakup
with Deib for you to help him?

725
00:37:34,351 --> 00:37:35,385
What, Max?

726
00:37:35,518 --> 00:37:36,086
You thought
I was just gonna help him

727
00:37:36,219 --> 00:37:37,655
because you asked me to?

728
00:37:38,188 --> 00:37:38,889
No.

729
00:37:39,556 --> 00:37:40,791
I just thought you'd do it

730
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:42,260
'cause you always say
you love him.

731
00:37:43,159 --> 00:37:46,998
But again, as usual, love means
something else to you.

732
00:37:48,431 --> 00:37:50,333
I won't break up with Deib.

733
00:37:50,467 --> 00:37:51,702
-[Migz] Go, girl!
-[Michiko] Yes!

734
00:37:51,835 --> 00:37:53,103
-[Naih] Period!
-[Ysay] Team TagSen all the way!

735
00:38:05,048 --> 00:38:05,715
Here.

736
00:38:13,456 --> 00:38:14,125
MOO!

737
00:38:14,659 --> 00:38:15,992
You're so silent.

738
00:38:16,494 --> 00:38:17,594
Are you mad?

739
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:23,000
MOO, why would you do that?

740
00:38:23,333 --> 00:38:25,568
I just wanted to try something.

741
00:38:25,702 --> 00:38:27,271
We're running out of options!

742
00:38:27,405 --> 00:38:28,905
You know
I'd do anything for you--

743
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:29,606
MOO,

744
00:38:30,373 --> 00:38:33,077
you know I'd rather get expelled
than ask help from her.

745
00:38:33,643 --> 00:38:35,445
I don't trust her!

746
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:36,880
And neither should you!

747
00:38:37,014 --> 00:38:38,382
Alright.

748
00:38:38,516 --> 00:38:40,083
Calm down. I'm sorry.

749
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:42,420
So you're really willing
to breakup with me?

750
00:38:42,952 --> 00:38:46,190
Of course not!
I said no earlier, didn't I?

751
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:48,092
You said you'd do anything--

752
00:38:48,224 --> 00:38:50,260
Yes, except that!

753
00:38:50,728 --> 00:38:52,829
Not if it would ruin
our relationship.

754
00:38:52,963 --> 00:38:54,331
We're not letting go, okay?

755
00:38:54,465 --> 00:38:56,132
You're asking me?

756
00:38:56,266 --> 00:38:57,233
Promise me!

757
00:38:57,367 --> 00:38:58,202
MOO,

758
00:38:58,635 --> 00:38:59,804
I promise.

759
00:39:00,271 --> 00:39:02,039
No matter what happens
in the world.

760
00:39:02,606 --> 00:39:03,139
Storm?

761
00:39:03,273 --> 00:39:03,574
Yes.

762
00:39:03,708 --> 00:39:04,240
Earthquake?

763
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:04,842
Yes.

764
00:39:04,974 --> 00:39:05,809
Tsunami?

765
00:39:06,443 --> 00:39:07,010
Pandemic?

766
00:39:07,143 --> 00:39:07,478
Yes.

767
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:08,612
Zombie outbreak?

768
00:39:08,746 --> 00:39:09,646
Yes, even zombies.

769
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:10,146
[imitates zombie snarling]

770
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:10,981
Yes.

771
00:39:11,581 --> 00:39:12,516
No matter what happens
in the world,

772
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:14,217
we're not breaking up, okay?

773
00:39:15,318 --> 00:39:16,219
Promise.

774
00:39:18,789 --> 00:39:20,490
-Hey, guys!
-[Michiko] Sign for Deib!

775
00:39:20,623 --> 00:39:22,092
Deib deserves a second chance!

776
00:39:22,226 --> 00:39:24,427
[singsong] We stand for Deib!
Sign for Deib!

777
00:39:24,561 --> 00:39:26,797
Please sign, guys.

778
00:39:26,931 --> 00:39:29,367
Guys, is there a problem
with our WiFi?

779
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:30,534
Why?

780
00:39:31,034 --> 00:39:34,204
I've been refreshing the page,

781
00:39:34,338 --> 00:39:36,039
but the result's the same.

782
00:39:36,574 --> 00:39:37,675
Aside from us,

783
00:39:38,275 --> 00:39:42,445
only three people
signed the petition.

784
00:39:43,012 --> 00:39:44,280
[Michiko] What now?

785
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:47,818
Wait, I got something!

786
00:39:48,652 --> 00:39:50,420
Oops! What's going on?

787
00:39:50,855 --> 00:39:53,724
I thought we had new supporters.

788
00:39:53,858 --> 00:39:56,193
All they did was
write negative comments.

789
00:39:56,327 --> 00:39:57,161
Lemme see.

790
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:01,599
These darn trolls!

791
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:06,771
Who's Ping Germee?
Imma slap him with my slippers!

792
00:40:07,871 --> 00:40:09,273
Ping Germee!

793
00:40:09,606 --> 00:40:12,777
Ping Germee, show your face!

794
00:40:12,909 --> 00:40:14,512
Imma fight you today!

795
00:40:14,644 --> 00:40:17,148
Lorde, stop!
That's embarrassing.

796
00:40:17,547 --> 00:40:18,681
No, Master!

797
00:40:19,215 --> 00:40:20,583
Ping Germee!

798
00:40:20,717 --> 00:40:22,786
Lorde,
they're just trolling you.

799
00:40:23,153 --> 00:40:24,288
Don't stoop to their level.

800
00:40:25,021 --> 00:40:27,123
Keep doing that
but only in your head, okay?

801
00:40:27,724 --> 00:40:29,193
Guys, guys, wait!

802
00:40:29,326 --> 00:40:31,094
We can get more votes!

803
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:32,963
What else can we do?

804
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:34,731
[Michiko]
Second chance for Deib!

805
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:38,335
What if, to get more signatures,

806
00:40:39,235 --> 00:40:41,338
we give away cookies
baked by Michiko?

807
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:45,376
With free kisses from the boys!

808
00:40:46,342 --> 00:40:47,010
No!

809
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:49,246
[Naih] No, no, no!

810
00:40:49,813 --> 00:40:51,715
It's a no from us.
Right, Maxie?!

811
00:40:52,081 --> 00:40:52,849
Mhmm.

812
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:54,717
-[hand slaps table]
-I got it!

813
00:40:54,851 --> 00:40:57,387
I get why it's a prank now!

814
00:40:57,755 --> 00:40:58,889
How did I miss that?

815
00:40:59,023 --> 00:40:59,722
Ping Germee! Ping Germee!

816
00:40:59,856 --> 00:41:00,858
Alright, settle down.

817
00:41:01,692 --> 00:41:02,259
Guys,

818
00:41:03,427 --> 00:41:06,797
what if I throw a party
at my house and invite everyone?

819
00:41:06,931 --> 00:41:09,432
Oh my God, stop me!
I love it!

820
00:41:09,567 --> 00:41:11,367
Sounds fun!

821
00:41:11,501 --> 00:41:14,405
[Naih] Mine, let's organize it!

822
00:41:15,438 --> 00:41:17,273
You know who's good
at organizing parties?

823
00:41:18,641 --> 00:41:19,809
Tob.

824
00:41:20,911 --> 00:41:24,949
If he was here, we'd have
lots of signatures by now.

825
00:41:25,849 --> 00:41:28,152
Sure, let's party.

826
00:41:29,385 --> 00:41:30,753
Want me to bake anything?

827
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:35,025
Wait, wait, wait!

828
00:41:36,025 --> 00:41:37,126
Daisy, Crystal, Maren!

829
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:39,829
Can you sign the petition
against Deib's expulsion?

830
00:41:45,034 --> 00:41:46,336
Guys, you don't have to sign.

831
00:41:46,469 --> 00:41:47,137
No pressure.

832
00:41:48,771 --> 00:41:50,875
Sorry, but I won't sign it.

833
00:41:51,208 --> 00:41:51,608
Me too.

834
00:41:52,175 --> 00:41:54,010
[Daisy] Bullying is not cool.

835
00:41:54,644 --> 00:41:56,480
Same here. Sorry.

836
00:41:57,146 --> 00:42:00,050
[Maren] We like you, Deib.
We just don't like what you did.

837
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:02,987
And if expulsion is the
fair punishment...

838
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:04,521
I understand.

839
00:42:04,954 --> 00:42:06,155
Thanks, guys.

840
00:42:08,826 --> 00:42:11,527
Hey! Do you know Ping?

841
00:42:11,661 --> 00:42:12,663
[Lee] Stop it, Lorde.

842
00:42:12,795 --> 00:42:14,498
[Naih] Please sign, guys.

843
00:42:15,164 --> 00:42:16,132
-[Naih] Don't then!
-Ha! Khloe ignored you.

844
00:42:16,266 --> 00:42:18,034
-There was a big block, okay?
-The curly one?

845
00:42:18,168 --> 00:42:19,068
Yeah.

846
00:42:19,202 --> 00:42:20,036
-[Migz giggles]
-[Naih] We stand for Deib!

847
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:22,373
[Lee] Guys, Deib deserves
a second chance!

848
00:42:32,382 --> 00:42:32,983
Yo!

849
00:42:37,655 --> 00:42:38,755
What do you want?

850
00:42:39,456 --> 00:42:41,025
Deib will be expelled
from Benison.

851
00:42:42,927 --> 00:42:44,561
So, congratulations.

852
00:42:44,929 --> 00:42:46,730
Even if you did nothing at all,

853
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:48,699
you now have a chance
of getting Max back.

854
00:42:49,432 --> 00:42:50,800
It's not like
they're breaking up.

855
00:42:51,335 --> 00:42:54,304
I know, but they won't be going
to the same school,

856
00:42:54,438 --> 00:42:56,974
meaning they won't be able
to see each other anymore.

857
00:42:58,842 --> 00:43:00,543
They'll be
in different worlds now,

858
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:02,713
like
a long-distance relationship.

859
00:43:03,179 --> 00:43:08,052
We both know that doesn't last.

860
00:43:10,219 --> 00:43:12,088
So it's okay with you
if Deib gets expelled?

861
00:43:13,123 --> 00:43:14,525
No, not really.

862
00:43:15,025 --> 00:43:16,994
I could have helped, but....

863
00:43:18,394 --> 00:43:20,630
Max refused to give in to
my one and only condition.

864
00:43:21,431 --> 00:43:22,065
What's that?

865
00:43:23,067 --> 00:43:24,802
She would have
to break up with Deib!

866
00:43:25,369 --> 00:43:27,170
Why do you keep
giving Max a hard time?

867
00:43:27,737 --> 00:43:30,139
You won't stop until
you've really hurt her, huh?

868
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:33,010
She doesn't deserve Deib!

869
00:43:33,344 --> 00:43:34,143
Who does?

870
00:43:34,510 --> 00:43:35,211
You?

871
00:43:35,778 --> 00:43:37,246
[RJ] You cheated on him.

872
00:43:38,047 --> 00:43:39,682
It was just one mistake!

873
00:43:40,083 --> 00:43:41,851
And I regret it!
I said sorry!

874
00:43:41,985 --> 00:43:43,387
Sorry, too,

875
00:43:44,188 --> 00:43:45,389
because
he doesn't want you back.

876
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:46,856
You gotta accept that.

877
00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:48,525
Like how you did?!

878
00:43:49,092 --> 00:43:52,362
I'm not a sore loser
and a coward like you, Randall!

879
00:43:52,795 --> 00:43:53,664
Wow!

880
00:43:54,331 --> 00:43:57,768
Respecting what my friend wants
makes me a coward and a loser?

881
00:43:57,900 --> 00:43:59,268
You're still friends?!

882
00:43:59,769 --> 00:44:00,903
As if!

883
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:03,507
You can't be friends
with the girl who hurt you!

884
00:44:04,273 --> 00:44:06,143
You can't say
you love Deib either

885
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:09,445
because the truth is
you only love yourself!

886
00:44:13,684 --> 00:44:15,552
[Lee] Max! Deib! Look!

887
00:44:15,686 --> 00:44:17,121
"Formal Inquiry Set for Enrile.

888
00:44:17,253 --> 00:44:19,056
Basketball varsity
captain Deib Lohr Enrile

889
00:44:19,188 --> 00:44:20,757
will get his day
in Benison court."

890
00:44:20,891 --> 00:44:23,027
MOO, good news!

891
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:25,061
You can now defend yourself!

892
00:44:25,195 --> 00:44:26,797
Wait, how is this even possible?

893
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:28,431
[Deib]
Migz, did you request this?

894
00:44:28,565 --> 00:44:30,400
You're still
the student body president?

895
00:44:30,534 --> 00:44:31,201
Migz!

896
00:44:31,702 --> 00:44:33,202
I'm still the president.

897
00:44:35,371 --> 00:44:35,838
[Kim] What?

898
00:44:36,407 --> 00:44:37,775
Don't I get a little
"thank you" from you?

899
00:44:38,307 --> 00:44:39,275
What's the catch?

900
00:44:39,809 --> 00:44:41,878
I break up with Max?
Never gonna happen, Kim.

901
00:44:42,012 --> 00:44:42,880
[Kim] I know.

902
00:44:43,012 --> 00:44:45,014
That's why
I want something else.

903
00:44:45,916 --> 00:44:46,949
So there's still a catch?

904
00:44:47,418 --> 00:44:49,485
I just need a little favor.

905
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:54,657
I want one night with you.

906
00:44:54,791 --> 00:44:57,661
[tense music playing]

907
00:45:36,365 --> 00:45:38,802
I have no reason to be jealous.

908
00:45:39,335 --> 00:45:40,903
I'm sure about you.

909
00:45:41,038 --> 00:45:42,739
[Max] I'm secure about us.

910
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,242
[Deib]
I really appreciate your trust.

911
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:47,643
I trust you, too, so much.

912
00:45:47,777 --> 00:45:49,880
When are you paying
your 75K debt?

913
00:45:50,012 --> 00:45:50,947
Boss has been patient
long enough.

914
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:51,681
He's given you months to pay.

915
00:45:51,815 --> 00:45:52,849
75,000?!

916
00:45:53,182 --> 00:45:53,784
[Boyet]  Max,

917
00:45:54,117 --> 00:45:55,418
don't say it out loud!

918
00:45:55,552 --> 00:45:57,887
Care to explain to me
why you're being subjected

919
00:45:58,021 --> 00:45:59,989
to a formal inquiry in school?

920
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:01,291
I'm sorry, Dad.

921
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:03,159
Sorry is not enough, Deib.

922
00:46:03,293 --> 00:46:05,295
What is the right punishment
for someone

923
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:07,396
who not only bullied
other students

924
00:46:07,530 --> 00:46:11,335
but even made it seem cool
to join him in his pranks?
