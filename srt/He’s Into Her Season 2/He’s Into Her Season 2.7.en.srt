1
00:00:01,835 --> 00:00:04,838
[Deib] I promise
to always be your best friend

2
00:00:04,971 --> 00:00:07,240
through good times
and bad times.

3
00:00:07,373 --> 00:00:08,441
[Deib] What's the problem?

4
00:00:08,574 --> 00:00:09,909
[Max] About that side hustle
yesterday...

5
00:00:10,042 --> 00:00:10,944
Randall was there.

6
00:00:11,076 --> 00:00:12,044
Echavez?!

7
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:13,512
[Deib] Shoot. My dad's calling.

8
00:00:14,214 --> 00:00:15,115
I have to go.

9
00:00:15,247 --> 00:00:16,815
You're so annoying!

10
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:19,419
You sided with Ysay
instead of me.

11
00:00:19,551 --> 00:00:20,853
I'm your girlfriend!

12
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,088
Come home.

13
00:00:22,554 --> 00:00:24,923
As long as she's still there,
I'm staying here.

14
00:00:26,024 --> 00:00:28,128
[Agila] It's so hard to follow
this Christopher Santos.

15
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,094
Where the heck are you, Agila?

16
00:00:29,228 --> 00:00:31,064
Can you recall your name?

17
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:32,832
I can't remember my name.

18
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:35,902
Uncle Boyet, remember when
I bumped into Deib in Mindoro?

19
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:39,039
[Max] He was in a hurry then
because his private investigator

20
00:00:39,171 --> 00:00:41,307
found the suspects in Mindoro.

21
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:43,176
Come back...

22
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:49,281
Dale!

23
00:00:51,484 --> 00:00:52,685
Hey, Michiko!

24
00:00:53,051 --> 00:00:54,420
There's an anime like that!

25
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:57,490
The guy woke up from his coma
because the girl kissed him.

26
00:00:58,223 --> 00:00:59,558
I didn't kiss him!

27
00:00:59,692 --> 00:01:01,326
Not yet!

28
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:03,595
But girl, I can so see it!

29
00:01:03,729 --> 00:01:06,599
OMG, I'm excited for you
to move on from Tob!

30
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:10,370
It's not that easy!

31
00:01:10,503 --> 00:01:13,206
Sis, he didn't come
to your date last night.

32
00:01:13,338 --> 00:01:15,808
It's a sign you should move on!

33
00:01:15,941 --> 00:01:18,010
It's over! Period!

34
00:01:18,444 --> 00:01:21,447
Or it's a sign
that Tob really did love you.

35
00:01:22,347 --> 00:01:23,549
[Elle] He made that reservation
a month ago,

36
00:01:23,683 --> 00:01:26,286
the same night
you became a couple.

37
00:01:26,585 --> 00:01:28,054
When he made that reservation,

38
00:01:28,888 --> 00:01:31,825
he had every intention of being
with Michiko on their monthsary.

39
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:34,593
You really think that?

40
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:35,662
Yeah,

41
00:01:36,361 --> 00:01:38,298
I believe
Tob really did love you.

42
00:01:38,897 --> 00:01:40,632
[Elle] Maybe your monthsary
just fell through

43
00:01:40,766 --> 00:01:42,902
because
the universe has other plans.

44
00:01:43,469 --> 00:01:46,772
But what do I know?
I've never been in love.

45
00:01:48,308 --> 00:01:50,376
Good morning, Benisonians!

46
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:55,548
[all] Good morning, Headmaster!

47
00:01:58,718 --> 00:01:59,618
Seniors,

48
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:02,489
time to plan your future!

49
00:02:03,222 --> 00:02:05,125
We'll be having
a career fair this week.

50
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:06,593
[Headmaster]
Universities and colleges

51
00:02:06,725 --> 00:02:08,995
will be setting up kiosks
for you to visit.

52
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:12,498
There will also be booths where
you can talk to various alumni,

53
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:15,367
all experts
in their respective fields.

54
00:02:15,968 --> 00:02:18,471
They'll give you advice
on your chosen career path.

55
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:20,340
-Hey, Ysay!
-[Headmaster continues talking]

56
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:22,975
I'm sure Johann will be there.

57
00:02:23,342 --> 00:02:25,512
We can ask him
some follow up questions.

58
00:02:26,445 --> 00:02:27,546
-Game, Lee!
-[Headmaster continues talking]

59
00:02:28,247 --> 00:02:29,716
Did you see his new--

60
00:02:29,848 --> 00:02:31,484
Headmaster's talking.

61
00:02:31,617 --> 00:02:32,685
More listening,

62
00:02:33,118 --> 00:02:34,687
less gossiping please.

63
00:02:36,855 --> 00:02:37,623
Sorry.

64
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:40,193
[Headmaster]
Before you meet the alumni,

65
00:02:40,659 --> 00:02:44,197
you have to answer an online
aptitude and interests exam...

66
00:02:44,963 --> 00:02:46,098
-[Naih] How to date an artist?
-to determine...

67
00:02:46,231 --> 00:02:46,799
what you're good at

68
00:02:47,332 --> 00:02:49,002
and what your interests are.

69
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:51,638
That exam will also
help you to choose

70
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:54,473
the correct degree
and university for you.

71
00:02:55,207 --> 00:02:57,743
That's it!
But before you go,

72
00:02:57,877 --> 00:03:02,247
I'd like to thank
Ms. Macy Luna from Batch '97,

73
00:03:02,748 --> 00:03:05,318
for not only helping us
set up this career fair

74
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:07,586
but also the homecoming ball.

75
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:09,722
Thank you, Mace!

76
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:14,794
Bears, a Benison hurrah
for Ms. Macy Luna!

77
00:03:14,927 --> 00:03:16,962
[all] Hoo-hah, hoo-hah!

78
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:18,531
[Elle] My mom!

79
00:03:19,431 --> 00:03:20,800
[Deib] Max, I'm telling you...

80
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:23,102
Our new headmaster
has a crush on Aunt Macy.

81
00:03:23,235 --> 00:03:24,403
I swear!

82
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:26,573
-[Max] Deib!
-Deib, how do you know that?

83
00:03:28,373 --> 00:03:31,743
Elle, don't listen to Deib.

84
00:03:31,877 --> 00:03:33,413
He's always saying it.

85
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:36,649
So what if Headmaster
has a crush on Aunt Macy?

86
00:03:36,782 --> 00:03:40,252
What matters
is Aunt Macy loves Dad.

87
00:03:40,986 --> 00:03:41,687
Right?

88
00:03:42,788 --> 00:03:43,622
Yeah.

89
00:03:45,157 --> 00:03:46,192
[Deib] But it's true!

90
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:50,896
["He's Into Her" by BGYO
playing]

91
00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:53,091
[Lorde] Once upon a time,
there's a school bully.

92
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:59,598
And then one day,
a spunky girl cooked up a storm

93
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:01,567
to stop the bully
once and for all!

94
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:04,470
But surprise!

95
00:05:04,603 --> 00:05:09,509
They became friends until...
Aww! They fell in love!

96
00:05:09,641 --> 00:05:11,110
And praise my namesake,

97
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:15,048
because the Max-Deib ship
ended bullying at Benison High!

98
00:05:15,714 --> 00:05:17,250
Motivated by their love,

99
00:05:17,783 --> 00:05:21,553
Master led Benison
to victory at the Interhigh!

100
00:05:21,687 --> 00:05:24,690
Go Bears, fight and win!
Hoo-hah, hoo-hah!

101
00:05:25,324 --> 00:05:27,627
My other Masters
won at life, too!

102
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,262
They got their own love teams!

103
00:05:29,394 --> 00:05:30,762
#Tochiko!

104
00:05:30,896 --> 00:05:32,432
#Leeih

105
00:05:33,098 --> 00:05:37,836
But the best of all is #Khlorde.

106
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:43,843
Khloe chased me around until
I finally returned her love!

107
00:05:44,476 --> 00:05:47,680
[Migz] Khloe did the chasing?
Seriously?

108
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:50,783
It's called manifesting!
Don't question the universe!

109
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:51,884
Shut up, Migz!

110
00:05:52,017 --> 00:05:54,420
I'm updating Dale
so he knows what he missed.

111
00:05:54,553 --> 00:05:56,355
That doesn't include
your love life, Lorde.

112
00:05:56,488 --> 00:05:58,057
Yeah,
your fake news of a love life!

113
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,324
True!

114
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:01,160
Wow! Coming from the
queen of fake designer!

115
00:06:01,293 --> 00:06:02,894
[friends laughing]

116
00:06:03,028 --> 00:06:07,399
-Look! Dale's laughing.
-[friends laughing]

117
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:09,201
-He's the coolest!
-[friends laughing]

118
00:06:09,334 --> 00:06:12,137
Dale, let me introduce
these idiots to you.

119
00:06:12,904 --> 00:06:16,274
This is Naih,
the queen of fake fashion.

120
00:06:16,408 --> 00:06:17,877
Dale, you looked so handsome
in pictures.

121
00:06:18,009 --> 00:06:21,781
But nothing beats
seeing you live and alive!

122
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:26,119
This is Migz,
he replaced Kim as president,

123
00:06:26,252 --> 00:06:28,788
but now she's taken it back.

124
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:33,259
This is Elle,
Madam Kim's ex friend

125
00:06:33,391 --> 00:06:37,596
but now and forever sister
of Madam Max.

126
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,699
This is Ysay,
a former Kim-Deib shipper,

127
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:45,103
now turned Max-Deib fangirl.

128
00:06:45,237 --> 00:06:47,173
Period!

129
00:06:47,305 --> 00:06:49,641
If my cousin had a dollar
every time you said her name,

130
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:51,076
Kim would be even richer.

131
00:06:51,209 --> 00:06:53,079
Sorry!

132
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:55,180
Oh?

133
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:57,516
And this is Michiko!

134
00:06:58,117 --> 00:06:59,752
I think
you already know each other!

135
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:04,990
Michiko and Dale
came up with this idea

136
00:07:05,124 --> 00:07:10,430
for him to type what he wants
to say on the phone.

137
00:07:10,562 --> 00:07:13,865
[excited murmurs]

138
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,769
Dale says,
"thank you all for being here."

139
00:07:17,903 --> 00:07:20,872
[all] Aww!

140
00:07:23,341 --> 00:07:26,579
Dale, what did you miss most?

141
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:30,949
"C-A-R--"

142
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:33,119
Wait, I know! I know!

143
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:34,620
Your car! Champ, right?

144
00:07:35,053 --> 00:07:36,488
-When can we ride it again?
-He says no!

145
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,790
Think I missed it more than you!

146
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:39,826
No?

147
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,226
-[Lorde] Oh, sorry!
-[friends laughing]

148
00:07:43,295 --> 00:07:45,197
"Carrot cake."

149
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,266
My carrot cake!

150
00:07:48,033 --> 00:07:49,901
Promise,
I'll bake it for you next time!

151
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:54,473
Is he Michiko's crush,

152
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:56,675
the one who gave her
the "thank you" card

153
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:58,978
she put in the time capsule?

154
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:02,682
[friends squealing]

155
00:08:02,814 --> 00:08:04,584
-Don't move around too much!
-Sorry!

156
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:10,923
"Someone's missing."

157
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:12,124
[Naih and Ysay gasp]

158
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,261
So extra!

159
00:08:15,761 --> 00:08:17,262
Bro, about that...

160
00:08:18,497 --> 00:08:20,098
Tob... He's... Um...

161
00:08:25,237 --> 00:08:27,206
"I know. Michiko told me."

162
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:34,145
"Sorry, Michiko. I forgot."

163
00:08:36,448 --> 00:08:37,649
It's okay, don't worry.

164
00:08:38,183 --> 00:08:41,153
I'm still getting used to him
not being around, too.

165
00:08:44,956 --> 00:08:48,027
Bro, I know a lot has changed
since you went in a coma....

166
00:08:49,294 --> 00:08:51,663
Some people you know
are no longer here,

167
00:08:52,597 --> 00:08:54,100
including some of your friends.

168
00:08:56,735 --> 00:08:58,169
But I hope you know
I will always be here.

169
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,908
And if you need some,

170
00:09:04,442 --> 00:09:05,878
my friends are your friends.

171
00:09:06,011 --> 00:09:06,412
Right, guys?

172
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:09,682
[all] Yeah!

173
00:09:11,683 --> 00:09:13,586
"Thanks, guys.

174
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:16,989
I need my own phone now."

175
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:21,460
Right! You can't use
Michiko's phone all the time!

176
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,261
That's clingier
than official couples!

177
00:09:23,395 --> 00:09:24,830
You're just bitter, Lorde!

178
00:09:26,197 --> 00:09:28,833
"I have excellent judgment
and management skills.

179
00:09:28,967 --> 00:09:31,971
I am compassionate,
assertive, and persevering."

180
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:33,405
[Deib] That's all true.

181
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,106
What's yours, MOO?

182
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:41,480
It says I'm inclined
to leadership positions.

183
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:44,549
I'm realistic,
detail-oriented...

184
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:47,186
I have strong
critical thinking skills,

185
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,520
and I'm always curious.

186
00:09:48,653 --> 00:09:50,822
I should check out booth 7.

187
00:09:51,823 --> 00:09:53,259
Booth 7 is...

188
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:55,561
Atty. Randy Echavez!

189
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:57,629
Oh? Me, too!
I got Uncle Randy.

190
00:09:59,164 --> 00:10:00,231
Wait, Uncle Randy?

191
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,970
Is he a family friend?

192
00:10:04,669 --> 00:10:08,240
Um, yes. He's RJ's Dad.

193
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:10,109
[awkward coughs]

194
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:12,144
Ahhh...

195
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:14,714
How about you, guys?
What did you get?

196
00:10:14,846 --> 00:10:18,717
It said I'm business-minded,

197
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:21,253
so I should checkout
your dad's booth first.

198
00:10:21,386 --> 00:10:22,087
Mhmm.

199
00:10:22,221 --> 00:10:24,255
Mine said
I'm inclined to culinary

200
00:10:24,389 --> 00:10:27,927
as well as entrepreneurship
so I can also do business.

201
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:30,162
You, Elle?
Fashion design?

202
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:31,163
Yeah.

203
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,065
Predictable, huh?
I'll go to Mom's first.

204
00:10:33,198 --> 00:10:33,832
Okay.

205
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,269
Max, Deib!
I'm also going to Atty. Echavez.

206
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:42,041
My exam results say my skills
and interests

207
00:10:42,173 --> 00:10:45,211
are good for careers
in research,

208
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:46,511
public service,

209
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:48,947
government and law.

210
00:10:49,581 --> 00:10:50,548
Impressive!

211
00:10:50,682 --> 00:10:52,652
Migz for president in 2046!

212
00:10:52,784 --> 00:10:55,287
[friends cheer]

213
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:57,089
You, Lee and Ysay?

214
00:10:57,556 --> 00:10:58,758
[Lee, Ysay] I got Johann.

215
00:10:59,457 --> 00:11:00,793
[Lorde] Nice!

216
00:11:02,827 --> 00:11:04,562
We get it: you're a match!

217
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:05,464
Let's go.

218
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:08,366
-[Deib] Let's go, guys!
-[Lorde coughs]

219
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:10,436
Nobody's gonna ask me?

220
00:11:11,537 --> 00:11:12,370
What did you get?

221
00:11:14,005 --> 00:11:16,042
Ahhh...
I am trustworthy...

222
00:11:16,174 --> 00:11:17,976
-I have a sense of humor,
-[Deib] What?

223
00:11:18,476 --> 00:11:19,345
I'm persuasive,

224
00:11:19,477 --> 00:11:21,813
and-- do I really need
to say it out loud?

225
00:11:22,347 --> 00:11:23,115
I'm handsome!

226
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:24,350
-I could be an actor!
-Let's go, Deib!

227
00:11:24,482 --> 00:11:25,618
You wrote that yourself!

228
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,318
Go find someone who'll buy that!

229
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,123
That is so you, Lorde!

230
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:32,357
Right?

231
00:11:32,758 --> 00:11:33,024
[Karlie] Ew!

232
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:36,928
[Headmaster]
Remember when we were the kids

233
00:11:37,062 --> 00:11:38,163
who can't figure out

234
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:38,864
what we were supposed to do
with our lives?

235
00:11:38,998 --> 00:11:40,365
[Headmaster, Macy laughing]

236
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:42,333
I remember our career fair.

237
00:11:42,668 --> 00:11:44,070
You came drunk.

238
00:11:44,202 --> 00:11:45,937
My God! Yes!

239
00:11:46,337 --> 00:11:48,640
You picked a fight
with Headmaster Enrile

240
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:51,009
and got sent
to a formal inquiry!

241
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:54,447
Shhh! Don't mention that
in front of the kids.

242
00:11:54,779 --> 00:11:55,681
They won't take me seriously

243
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:57,549
if they found out
what a hooligan I was.

244
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:01,586
JP, I'm surprised that you
ended up becoming a teacher.

245
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,322
I thought
that was gonna be Maxim.

246
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:05,524
He's so serious, I also
thought he'd be the priest

247
00:12:05,924 --> 00:12:07,993
to officiate
your wedding with Macy.

248
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:12,998
Just like Alanis Morissette
said...

249
00:12:13,532 --> 00:12:14,933
[both] "Isn't it ironic?"

250
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:16,268
[both laughing]

251
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:26,412
Hi, Sir Johann!

252
00:12:26,544 --> 00:12:28,681
You two again?

253
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:30,515
[Johann]
You're attached at the hip!

254
00:12:31,049 --> 00:12:34,419
Hi, Mom. I got fashion design
as a possible career.

255
00:12:34,552 --> 00:12:37,389
That's nice. Wait...

256
00:12:37,789 --> 00:12:38,923
Johann,

257
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:41,059
this is my daughter, Elle.

258
00:12:41,192 --> 00:12:42,927
Oh! Hi.

259
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:44,830
[Johann] Macy Junior!

260
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:48,333
Do you also have a Maxim Luna
and a JP Quisumbing

261
00:12:48,466 --> 00:12:49,268
fighting over you?

262
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,001
Whoa! Whoa!

263
00:12:50,135 --> 00:12:51,570
[Headmaster] Johann! Come on!

264
00:12:51,703 --> 00:12:52,638
[Karlie] OMG!

265
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:55,039
Headmaster,
spill the tea please!

266
00:12:55,173 --> 00:12:58,711
Mr. Granada,
Mr. Gonzales is kidding.

267
00:12:58,844 --> 00:13:00,111
Don't listen to him.

268
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,681
[Headmaster] By the way, does
no one want to be a teacher?

269
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:04,416
Why is nobody coming
to talk to me here?

270
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:06,217
[Macy] Don't force the kids!

271
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:12,390
[Kim] Atty. Echavez,

272
00:13:12,957 --> 00:13:14,592
you're not a Benison graduate,
are you?

273
00:13:14,726 --> 00:13:17,596
Nope. Atty. Manalo,
who is an alumna of your school,

274
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:20,499
cannot be here, so she asked me
to come here today

275
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,802
to represent our law firm.

276
00:13:23,402 --> 00:13:27,572
Is the Southbay varsity captain
your son?

277
00:13:27,706 --> 00:13:29,008
Yes!

278
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:31,576
[Atty. Echavez] RJ is my junior.

279
00:13:33,011 --> 00:13:34,279
You picked up on that, huh?

280
00:13:34,613 --> 00:13:35,614
Same surname.

281
00:13:35,947 --> 00:13:37,383
And you sorta look alike.

282
00:13:38,116 --> 00:13:39,018
Very observant.

283
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:41,452
You might have a future
as a lawyer.

284
00:13:42,153 --> 00:13:44,190
Sir,
what law do you specialize in?

285
00:13:44,623 --> 00:13:48,293
I specialize in criminal
and civil litigation.

286
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:52,030
Have you ever defended
a criminal?

287
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:54,966
You must be Deib.

288
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:58,102
I hear a lot about you from Max.

289
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:02,207
[Atty. Echavez] Yes, I have
served as defense counsel.

290
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:06,312
And I have successfully
defended all my past clients.

291
00:14:06,912 --> 00:14:08,313
You're okay with that?

292
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:11,049
[Deib]
Defending someone who is guilty

293
00:14:11,182 --> 00:14:13,018
that doesn't bother you at all?

294
00:14:13,384 --> 00:14:14,854
Yeah.
Where is your morality?

295
00:14:14,986 --> 00:14:16,788
Deib! Kim!

296
00:14:16,922 --> 00:14:17,923
[Atty. Echavez] Max, it's okay.

297
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:20,558
Not the first time
I've been asked this question.

298
00:14:21,293 --> 00:14:21,961
Well...

299
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:23,062
Look,

300
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:27,066
it's not my job to judge
whether my client is guilty.

301
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:29,835
[Atty. Echavez]
My job is to represent my client

302
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:32,303
and make sure
he gets a fair trial.

303
00:14:32,437 --> 00:14:32,770
Now,

304
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:36,408
I don't know and I don't care
whether he's guilty.

305
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:37,976
And maybe,
that makes me sound like

306
00:14:38,443 --> 00:14:41,647
I have no sense of morality
or conscience--

307
00:14:41,779 --> 00:14:43,381
Yeah, it kinda does.

308
00:14:43,514 --> 00:14:44,048
[Max] Deib!

309
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:46,451
[Atty. Echavez] Kids,

310
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:48,586
I do my work as a lawyer,

311
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:51,557
particularly
as a criminal defense lawyer,

312
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:52,957
not for the guilty.

313
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:55,727
I do this because
of the innocent person.

314
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,629
I can't allow
a single innocent person

315
00:14:57,763 --> 00:15:00,599
to be convicted
of a crime he did not commit.

316
00:15:00,865 --> 00:15:02,033
When crimes occur,

317
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,836
we often cannot know
for certain

318
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:07,438
if a suspect is innocent
or guilty.

319
00:15:07,572 --> 00:15:10,009
And mistakes can happen
in our legal system.

320
00:15:10,142 --> 00:15:11,342
That's why the expression

321
00:15:11,476 --> 00:15:13,946
"innocent until proven guilty"
exists.

322
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:17,416
It's already an injustice
that a crime has been committed,

323
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:19,418
and it would be
another injustice

324
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:23,855
if an innocent man is punished
for a crime he did not commit.

325
00:15:24,556 --> 00:15:27,326
So, Deib? Have I convinced you
to become a lawyer?

326
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:28,394
[Deib scoffs]

327
00:15:30,361 --> 00:15:34,533
Nah. I can't defend someone
I know is guilty.

328
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:38,504
-I'll just stick to engineering.
-[friends laughing]

329
00:15:43,975 --> 00:15:46,912
[monitor beeping]

330
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:48,212
[nurse] How are you, sir?

331
00:15:49,881 --> 00:15:51,216
I remember now...

332
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:54,552
I'm a private investigator.

333
00:15:55,653 --> 00:15:56,721
I've been working on a...

334
00:15:58,490 --> 00:15:59,424
carnapping case.

335
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:01,527
[Agila] The guy who hired me

336
00:16:01,659 --> 00:16:04,229
wanted to find
whoever shot his brother.

337
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:07,533
I followed the suspects
to Mindoro.

338
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:10,869
[phone dialing]

339
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:15,240
[Agila] The syndicate found out
I was on to them.

340
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:15,807
Come on!

341
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:19,177
Hello, boss.

342
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,312
[Deib] Any update?

343
00:16:20,745 --> 00:16:22,514
I've been found out.

344
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:25,083
I'll need to lie low
for a while.

345
00:16:25,216 --> 00:16:27,653
I'll double your pay.
Just hurry up please.

346
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:29,254
[Deib]
I'll make sure these assholes

347
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:31,724
pay for what they did
to my brother.

348
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:33,024
Alright, sir!

349
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,562
[Agila] I found out
there's a CCTV footage,

350
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:41,332
so I had someone get it...

351
00:16:43,668 --> 00:16:44,970
After that...

352
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:48,072
After months of investigating...

353
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:50,341
I found a solid evidence.

354
00:16:50,475 --> 00:16:52,311
-Boss!
-Did you get it?

355
00:16:52,443 --> 00:16:53,846
I was right on time, boss.

356
00:16:53,979 --> 00:16:55,880
They were about to delete
the footage.

357
00:16:56,481 --> 00:16:58,450
The video's there,
but some parts are missing

358
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:00,284
because there was a
blackout that night.

359
00:17:00,418 --> 00:17:01,653
But the shooting was recorded?

360
00:17:02,053 --> 00:17:04,056
Yes, you can see
the victim being shot.

361
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:05,824
I'll leave you to it, boss.

362
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:08,594
[motorcycle leaving]

363
00:17:16,067 --> 00:17:18,569
[suspenseful music playing]

364
00:17:18,703 --> 00:17:21,606
[indistinct chatter]

365
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:22,307
[gunshot]

366
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:28,513
[carnapper] What happened?

367
00:17:29,847 --> 00:17:31,115
[carnapper] Hey, help me!

368
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:32,651
[carnapper] Sir?

369
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:44,296
[Agila] I called the guy
who hired me immediately.

370
00:17:46,498 --> 00:17:48,232
[Deib] Just send it to me.
I can't hear you.

371
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:49,934
I'll watch it later.

372
00:17:50,234 --> 00:17:51,636
Okay, bye.

373
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:59,076
[Agila] Sir, the video is clear,
but it didn't record everything.

374
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:01,145
There was a blackout
at the scene of the crime.

375
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:02,480
But this is enough.

376
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:04,849
You can see the face
of Christopher Santos,

377
00:18:04,982 --> 00:18:06,384
the guy from Mindoro.

378
00:18:07,152 --> 00:18:08,252
[phone dies]

379
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,255
Crap! My battery's dead!

380
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:12,223
[engine revving]

[tense music playing]

385
00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:27,306
Boss said we should throw him
in the river.

386
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:28,973
Check if he's really dead!

387
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:31,343
Look for his cellphone
and wallet!

388
00:18:35,413 --> 00:18:36,248
There's no cellphone!

389
00:18:36,381 --> 00:18:37,348
Look harder!
It's gotta be there!

390
00:18:39,884 --> 00:18:40,719
[footsteps approaching]

391
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:41,886
[passerby] Hey!

392
00:18:42,019 --> 00:18:43,355
Hurry, someone's coming!

393
00:18:44,155 --> 00:18:45,624
Run!

394
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:46,724
[passerby] Hey!

395
00:18:47,692 --> 00:18:48,660
[Agila]
That's what I remember last.

396
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:49,327
[engine revving]

397
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:51,696
Call the police.

398
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:55,834
[nurse] Okay, sir.
Do you remember your name?

399
00:18:57,134 --> 00:18:57,970
Sol...

400
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:02,941
Soliman Agila--

401
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:04,343
[Agila groaning]

402
00:19:04,843 --> 00:19:06,411
-Sir! Sir!
-[monitor rapidly beeping]

403
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:07,679
-Sir, what's happening?!
-[monitor rapidly beeping]

404
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:08,646
Doc! Doc,

405
00:19:08,779 --> 00:19:10,214
the patient
is under cardiac arrest!

406
00:19:10,348 --> 00:19:13,652
-[nurse] Doc!
-[Agila groaning]

407
00:19:15,787 --> 00:19:18,923
[monitor flatlines]

408
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,429
[Johann] Art is communication,

409
00:19:25,696 --> 00:19:31,036
an expression of loneliness,
longing, courage, love.

410
00:19:31,502 --> 00:19:33,638
Art is taking risks...

411
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:37,709
getting dirty and making
something beautiful

412
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:40,444
out of the mess
and sometimes ordinary.

413
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:42,748
Here you go, guys.

414
00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:45,217
And have fun!

415
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:47,486
Mine, oh my God!

416
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:48,987
[Lee] Naih!

417
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:52,523
Hello, sir! I'm Naih Marchessa!
Nice to meet you!

418
00:19:52,657 --> 00:19:56,361
Can I join even though
I know nothing about art?

419
00:19:56,827 --> 00:19:57,895
Sure! Go ahead.

420
00:19:58,262 --> 00:19:59,330
Oh my God!

421
00:19:59,463 --> 00:20:01,500
Wow, Naih! Are you
taking an interest in art?

422
00:20:01,866 --> 00:20:02,834
[Naih] Me?

423
00:20:04,869 --> 00:20:07,271
Of course not!
I just missed you!

424
00:20:07,405 --> 00:20:09,740
Oh, I thought...

425
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:13,545
Come on,
teach me how to paint...

426
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:15,480
Sure, let's go there.

427
00:20:16,647 --> 00:20:19,483
Wanna be in that
cheap loser's shoes, huh?

428
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:21,118
Don't be such a gossip!

429
00:20:21,252 --> 00:20:22,221
Don't be such a liar!

430
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:25,356
If you like Lee, go for it!

431
00:20:26,924 --> 00:20:27,759
[Karlie] Let's go, Khloe!

432
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:29,461
[Michiko] Auntie,
this is for you and Dale.

433
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:30,561
Aww,

434
00:20:30,895 --> 00:20:32,564
that's so sweet!

435
00:20:32,698 --> 00:20:34,266
[Evita]
Michiko, thank you so much

436
00:20:34,398 --> 00:20:35,701
for being there for Dale,

437
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:36,969
-okay? [chuckles]
-Yes, Auntie.

438
00:20:37,435 --> 00:20:38,869
Thank you, too.

439
00:20:39,003 --> 00:20:39,971
[Deib] Mhmm.

440
00:20:40,471 --> 00:20:42,074
Is this your famous
carrot cake that Dale missed?

441
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:43,709
Yes!

442
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:47,346
Can I have just one little bite?

443
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:49,347
Yes, go!
Just don't eat it all!

444
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,449
Leave some for Dale, okay?

445
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:52,217
Thank you again, Michiko!

446
00:20:52,483 --> 00:20:54,586
And please, visit anytime, okay?

447
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,454
Yes, thank you, Auntie.

448
00:20:56,587 --> 00:20:58,155
Deib, I'll go ahead.

449
00:20:58,289 --> 00:20:59,391
Okay!

450
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:00,491
Bye, Auntie!

451
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:01,226
Bye!

452
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:02,059
Mom, let's try this.

453
00:21:02,193 --> 00:21:02,861
Okay!

454
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:05,864
Mhmm.

455
00:21:06,464 --> 00:21:08,066
Mhmm. It's so good!

456
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,367
It'll make Dale smile.

457
00:21:11,702 --> 00:21:15,339
Hey, I noticed
you haven't been to my booth.

458
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:19,076
[Evita] Don't you wanna be
a doctor, son?

459
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:22,681
Most kids want to be
like their parents

460
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:24,682
when they grow up, you know?

461
00:21:25,483 --> 00:21:26,884
I wanna...

462
00:21:27,152 --> 00:21:28,653
be as wonderful as you mom,

463
00:21:31,222 --> 00:21:32,790
but I don't want to be a doctor.

464
00:21:34,425 --> 00:21:35,493
That's fine.

465
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:39,865
[Evita] I'll support you if you
really want to be an engineer.

466
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:41,432
I'll be there for you.

467
00:21:41,799 --> 00:21:43,134
[Evita] I just wanna know why...

468
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:46,104
Are you afraid of blood?
[laughs]

469
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,142
No actually,

470
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:52,611
I'm afraid of Dad.

471
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:59,817
I'm scared of failing
and disappointing him again,

472
00:22:00,818 --> 00:22:02,688
giving him another reason to

473
00:22:04,021 --> 00:22:06,057
not like me
and not be proud of me.

474
00:22:06,657 --> 00:22:07,925
[Evita] That's not true.

475
00:22:08,292 --> 00:22:09,961
-He's proud of you.
-[Deib] Mom.

476
00:22:10,595 --> 00:22:12,564
Mom, we have lots of doctors
in the family.

477
00:22:12,963 --> 00:22:15,567
I'll just build
a hospital for you guys.

478
00:22:18,936 --> 00:22:24,175
[Evita] Hey, I know your dad
has a hard time showing it,

479
00:22:24,576 --> 00:22:26,310
but he loves you, son.

480
00:22:26,744 --> 00:22:28,547
[Evita] Don't forget that, okay?

481
00:22:32,616 --> 00:22:34,618
Oops, I think I ate it all!

482
00:22:35,019 --> 00:22:36,320
Me, too.

483
00:22:36,755 --> 00:22:38,423
-[Macy] Are you sure?
-[Headmaster] Yeah, it's fine!

484
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:39,825
-[Macy] I'll wait here.
-[Headmaster] Okay, sure.

485
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,394
[Elle] Let's sit there!

486
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:44,195
[Max]
Dad, let's sit with Aunt Macy!

487
00:22:44,563 --> 00:22:46,097
Yes, girls. Let's go.
Let's sit there.

488
00:22:53,904 --> 00:22:54,239
[Maxim coughs]

489
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:55,140
Macy...

490
00:22:57,308 --> 00:22:58,542
We'll sit here with you.

491
00:22:58,910 --> 00:22:59,176
What?

492
00:23:00,211 --> 00:23:01,779
It's been a while since we all
sat for a meal together.

493
00:23:02,446 --> 00:23:03,315
It's about time.

494
00:23:03,448 --> 00:23:04,316
Yeah, Mom.

495
00:23:04,449 --> 00:23:05,884
Here, Max.
Sit next to me.

496
00:23:06,183 --> 00:23:07,285
[Max] Hi, Aunt Macy.

497
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:11,222
But JP was just...
He was just...

498
00:23:12,723 --> 00:23:17,461
Jayps! Maxim, Elle,
and Max joined us. Is that okay?

499
00:23:17,596 --> 00:23:18,596
Sure thing.

500
00:23:21,465 --> 00:23:23,402
So, Maxim...

501
00:23:24,301 --> 00:23:26,238
I was telling Macy that
she should consider teaching,

502
00:23:26,371 --> 00:23:28,105
even just one class,
here in Benison.

503
00:23:29,406 --> 00:23:31,710
I have no patience to teach, JP.

504
00:23:32,009 --> 00:23:33,077
Hon,

505
00:23:33,444 --> 00:23:35,413
you're the most patient person
I know.

506
00:23:35,913 --> 00:23:38,750
Maxim and I don't agree on much,
but we agree on that.

507
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:40,652
Here's your order, sir.

508
00:23:40,786 --> 00:23:43,121
Thanks, Mama Josie.
You're the best!

509
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:44,155
Thank you, sir.

510
00:23:46,057 --> 00:23:46,724
[Headmaster] So,

511
00:23:47,358 --> 00:23:49,394
I ordered our favorite

512
00:23:50,028 --> 00:23:53,298
double patty cheeseburger with
bacon, mushrooms, and onions.

513
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:55,901
Here you go.
Just like old times.

514
00:23:57,234 --> 00:24:00,105
JP, I'm so sorry but...

515
00:24:00,238 --> 00:24:01,173
[Maxim] Quisumbing,

516
00:24:01,906 --> 00:24:04,643
Macy doesn't eat meat anymore.

517
00:24:04,976 --> 00:24:05,477
Since when?

518
00:24:05,609 --> 00:24:06,944
[Maxim] A long time ago.

519
00:24:07,645 --> 00:24:08,646
[Headmaster] You, Macy?!

520
00:24:09,181 --> 00:24:12,451
The winner of the
1997 Benison Burger Binge?!

521
00:24:12,851 --> 00:24:15,452
You're not a meat eater?!
Shocked!

522
00:24:15,586 --> 00:24:19,758
I'm sorry. I didn't know
you ordered that for us.

523
00:24:19,891 --> 00:24:21,092
Wait,
I'll order something else--

524
00:24:21,226 --> 00:24:22,259
No need.

525
00:24:25,363 --> 00:24:26,530
Hon, here,

526
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:28,567
baked prawns.

527
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:31,036
Your favorite!
I asked our cook to make this.

528
00:24:32,369 --> 00:24:33,771
I'll just have this burger--

529
00:24:33,904 --> 00:24:34,506
No!

530
00:24:34,638 --> 00:24:36,575
[Macy] It's high in cholesterol.

531
00:24:36,708 --> 00:24:39,109
The doctor told you
to cut down on greasy food.

532
00:24:39,544 --> 00:24:41,413
[Macy]
Let's just share these prawns.

533
00:24:41,546 --> 00:24:43,181
Of course,
with salad on the side.

534
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:46,317
But Jayps, thanks for ordering
and remembering

535
00:24:46,451 --> 00:24:48,086
how much I loved these burgers.

536
00:24:48,452 --> 00:24:49,054
Yeah.

537
00:24:49,788 --> 00:24:51,823
Well,
you've really changed, Macy.

538
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:53,657
Yes, I have.

539
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:58,096
Marriage and kids do that
to you, Quisumbing.

540
00:24:58,896 --> 00:24:59,998
[Maxim] Speaking of marriage,

541
00:25:00,432 --> 00:25:01,633
why are you still single?

542
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,769
Couldn't sweet-talk anyone
into marrying you?

543
00:25:04,903 --> 00:25:07,005
Is that how you got Macy
to marry you?

544
00:25:07,338 --> 00:25:08,105
Sweet talk?

545
00:25:09,173 --> 00:25:09,473
[Macy coughs]

546
00:25:09,607 --> 00:25:10,375
[Macy] Boys,

547
00:25:11,108 --> 00:25:13,944
let's have a pleasant
and peaceful lunch, okay?

548
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:20,317
[Max whispers] Aunt Macy got
these grown men on a leash.

549
00:25:20,451 --> 00:25:22,186
Impressive!

550
00:25:22,787 --> 00:25:24,722
[Elle whispers]
My mom is a badass.

551
00:25:29,961 --> 00:25:32,029
[Mr. Mancol]
Ms. Del Valle, Mr. Enrile.

552
00:25:32,663 --> 00:25:35,967
Have you considered
Pharos University?

553
00:25:38,603 --> 00:25:39,738
You went to college there, sir?

554
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:42,240
Yes.
I also took my masters there.

555
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:43,942
It's in Japan, right

556
00:25:44,075 --> 00:25:46,443
Do we need to speak
Japanese to study there?

557
00:25:46,912 --> 00:25:49,647
No. They have programs
taught in English.

558
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:51,982
What do you see
for your future career, Max?

559
00:25:53,384 --> 00:25:56,288
Maybe nursing or law.

560
00:25:56,421 --> 00:26:00,357
Pharos has good nursing
and pre-law programs.

561
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:03,228
With your high grades,
you can even apply...

562
00:26:03,361 --> 00:26:04,261
for a scholarship.

563
00:26:04,762 --> 00:26:05,529
[Mr. Mancol] If you want,

564
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:08,133
I can make a recommendation
letter for you.

565
00:26:09,366 --> 00:26:10,201
Really, sir?

566
00:26:11,635 --> 00:26:12,604
Please do!

567
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:14,105
Deib! If I studied there,

568
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:16,708
I'd be able to visit Mom's grave
faster and more often.

569
00:26:18,375 --> 00:26:19,176
Yeah,

570
00:26:19,844 --> 00:26:20,845
that's good.

571
00:26:22,846 --> 00:26:24,115
But how would that work?

572
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:26,750
You'll be in Tokyo,

573
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:28,752
I'll be here in Manila?

574
00:26:29,287 --> 00:26:31,355
I plan to go
to Stella Orientis University

575
00:26:31,489 --> 00:26:32,757
and join the varsity team.

576
00:26:37,061 --> 00:26:40,097
Sir, are there
engineering courses in Pharos?

577
00:26:40,464 --> 00:26:41,833
Um, no.

578
00:26:44,435 --> 00:26:45,804
It's not for me, then.

579
00:26:47,739 --> 00:26:49,106
What now, Babybabe?

580
00:26:49,606 --> 00:26:51,142
[Lorde] Master Deib, Max!

581
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:53,845
Let's check out the
Media & Comm Arts booth!

582
00:26:54,144 --> 00:26:55,246
They have lots of freebies!

583
00:26:56,513 --> 00:26:57,749
-Thank you, Mr. Mancol.
-[Mr. Mancol] Sure thing!

584
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:01,152
[producer] We're going
to show you our latest video.

585
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:03,855
Originally, it was going
to be a "Strangers Try" video,

586
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:06,523
but we found out that
the talents weren't strangers.

587
00:27:09,527 --> 00:27:13,263
["Nag-iisa" by Zion playing]

588
00:27:15,666 --> 00:27:18,103
Describe the first time you
kissed each other.

589
00:27:20,571 --> 00:27:21,506
[friends gasp]

590
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,575
[Karlie] OMG!

591
00:27:23,708 --> 00:27:26,044
[Lorde] Master? Madam Max?
What's this?

592
00:27:27,178 --> 00:27:28,747
[Khloe] What else, Lorde? Look.

593
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:31,115
[Lorde]
What is the meaning of this?!

594
00:27:31,249 --> 00:27:34,551
[Karlie] This is so awkward,
but fun! I'm telling Kim!

595
00:27:34,685 --> 00:27:35,787
[Khloe]
So you cheated on Deib? OMG!

596
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,087
Deib, no! It's not true.

597
00:27:37,521 --> 00:27:38,189
[Max] No!

598
00:27:39,356 --> 00:27:40,025
[Max] Deib!

599
00:27:41,792 --> 00:27:42,493
[Max] Deib!

600
00:27:43,127 --> 00:27:43,728
Deib!

601
00:27:43,862 --> 00:27:45,430
Deib, listen to me. Please!

602
00:27:45,563 --> 00:27:49,334
Deib, just hear me out! Please!

603
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:53,837
You didn't tell me that's
what you did with Echavez!

604
00:27:54,271 --> 00:27:57,575
I tried telling you about it,
but your dad called.

605
00:27:57,709 --> 00:27:59,443
You could have told me after,
Max!

606
00:27:59,576 --> 00:28:00,912
So many things happened after!

607
00:28:01,046 --> 00:28:04,082
Your trial! You got beaten up!
Your brother woke up!

608
00:28:04,449 --> 00:28:07,618
I didn't know how to tell you!
It slipped my mind!

609
00:28:07,951 --> 00:28:09,988
Deib, forgive me.
Please!

610
00:28:10,121 --> 00:28:11,388
So what,
you're dating him again?!

611
00:28:11,756 --> 00:28:12,691
No!

612
00:28:13,057 --> 00:28:14,592
[Max] I'm not dating him again!

613
00:28:14,726 --> 00:28:16,894
I don't know why they
used that title,

614
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:19,663
but I am not dating my ex again
because I am dating you!

615
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:21,799
It sure
didn't look that way to me!

616
00:28:22,166 --> 00:28:24,769
You seemed to enjoy dancing

617
00:28:25,269 --> 00:28:26,438
and holding hands with your ex!

618
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:28,205
Then after that?

619
00:28:28,673 --> 00:28:29,606
Did you kiss?!

620
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:31,108
What?!

621
00:28:31,241 --> 00:28:32,242
[Deib] What? Did you kiss him?

622
00:28:32,576 --> 00:28:33,678
I deserve the truth, Max.

623
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:35,480
And I deserve your trust!

624
00:28:37,481 --> 00:28:40,117
If that's what you think, then
you never trusted me at all!

625
00:28:41,586 --> 00:28:45,423
[melancholic music playing]

626
00:28:46,657 --> 00:28:48,692
[Max] Have you ever imagined
how we'd be now

627
00:28:48,826 --> 00:28:50,595
if we didn't break up?

628
00:28:51,695 --> 00:28:52,463
Yes,

629
00:28:54,432 --> 00:28:55,299
often.

630
00:28:56,201 --> 00:28:56,934
You?

631
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:01,905
Why are you asking me?
Next question please.

632
00:29:05,143 --> 00:29:07,077
Did you ever think about us
getting back together?

633
00:29:07,979 --> 00:29:09,079
No.

634
00:29:10,214 --> 00:29:13,183
[director] Such short answers!
Please explain!

635
00:29:16,186 --> 00:29:18,088
I'm happy with my boyfriend.

636
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:23,361
I love him very much.
And I know he loves me, too.

637
00:29:23,994 --> 00:29:24,962
[director] If you didn't have
a boyfriend now,

638
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:27,265
would your answer be
any different?

639
00:29:27,832 --> 00:29:29,099
I can't answer that.

640
00:29:31,336 --> 00:29:35,973
I can't imagine my life without
the boyfriend I have now.

641
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:45,250
[sighs]

642
00:29:53,758 --> 00:29:58,962
[Deib] I'm sorry, Max. Please
tell me when I can call you.

643
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:17,714
[Deib] I'm sorry, Max. Please
tell me when I can call you.

644
00:30:28,226 --> 00:30:32,696
[tense music playing]

645
00:30:32,829 --> 00:30:36,634
[phone ringing]

646
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:41,138
Hello, Tiago?

647
00:30:41,705 --> 00:30:44,275
[Tiago] Damn you, Boyet!
You ran from us again!

648
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:50,682
Tiago,
my conscience can't take it!

649
00:30:52,916 --> 00:30:54,318
I don't want anyone
to get hurt again!

650
00:30:55,385 --> 00:30:56,320
You're the one
who'll get hurt

651
00:30:56,453 --> 00:30:58,990
once Boss finds out
you ran away again!

652
00:30:59,958 --> 00:31:00,657
Tiago,

653
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:03,161
the guy Ute shot--

654
00:31:03,294 --> 00:31:05,128
Forget about him!

655
00:31:05,997 --> 00:31:07,397
Tiago, listen!

656
00:31:07,832 --> 00:31:10,701
I can't forget about it
because the guy we shot...

657
00:31:11,903 --> 00:31:14,239
is the brother
of my niece's boyfriend!

658
00:31:14,672 --> 00:31:15,707
[glass shatters]

659
00:31:17,674 --> 00:31:18,108
[Boyet] RJ?

660
00:31:22,113 --> 00:31:23,480
[tense music playing]

661
00:31:23,615 --> 00:31:24,582
Uncle Boyet.

662
00:31:26,116 --> 00:31:27,451
Did I hear that right?

663
00:31:28,819 --> 00:31:29,721
You shot someone?

664
00:31:35,425 --> 00:31:36,728
You shot someone, Uncle Boyet?

665
00:31:37,595 --> 00:31:38,528
RJ?

666
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:41,098
Was it Dale?

667
00:31:45,702 --> 00:31:46,537
RJ...

668
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:50,307
We didn't know it was Deib's
brother that my associate shot.

669
00:31:52,277 --> 00:31:54,811
I just found out
through Max's story.

670
00:31:57,147 --> 00:31:59,284
So you weren't
the one who shot Dale?

671
00:32:00,285 --> 00:32:01,318
Of course not!

672
00:32:02,287 --> 00:32:05,656
[Boyet]
I didn't even want to carnap.

673
00:32:05,789 --> 00:32:06,790
I had no choice.

674
00:32:06,923 --> 00:32:10,228
I had to find a way
to pay Max's hospital bill.

675
00:32:13,263 --> 00:32:15,333
[Boyet] I didn't think
someone would get hurt.

676
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,769
It all happened so fast.

677
00:32:19,836 --> 00:32:21,571
I just heard the gunshot.

678
00:32:21,705 --> 00:32:23,407
[Boyet] When I got there,

679
00:32:25,009 --> 00:32:27,111
Deib's brother was already shot.

680
00:32:28,313 --> 00:32:29,113
[Boyet sniffs]

681
00:32:29,547 --> 00:32:30,714
[Boyet] The gang ran away...

682
00:32:31,715 --> 00:32:32,683
and left me there.

683
00:32:32,817 --> 00:32:35,185
I immediately called
the ambulance to help him.

684
00:32:36,186 --> 00:32:37,788
[Boyet] Then I ran.

685
00:32:38,221 --> 00:32:39,757
I was scared for Mom...

686
00:32:40,892 --> 00:32:42,125
and Max.

687
00:32:43,728 --> 00:32:44,729
[Boyet] I couldn't imagine
what would happen to them

688
00:32:44,862 --> 00:32:46,396
if I went to prison.

689
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:50,468
RJ...

690
00:32:51,868 --> 00:32:54,538
I just wanted to get Max
out of the hospital.

691
00:32:56,207 --> 00:32:59,477
I didn't know what to do.

692
00:33:01,144 --> 00:33:04,682
I had nothing and nowhere to go.

693
00:33:06,616 --> 00:33:10,320
I never meant for that
to happen. Believe me, RJ.

694
00:33:11,422 --> 00:33:12,757
[RJ] Relax, Uncle Boyet.

695
00:33:13,124 --> 00:33:14,258
Stay calm.

696
00:33:17,961 --> 00:33:19,230
Who else knows about this?

697
00:33:20,263 --> 00:33:21,365
I don't know.

698
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:24,335
Probably just us...

699
00:33:25,036 --> 00:33:26,002
you...

700
00:33:26,938 --> 00:33:31,909
and Max mentioned that Deib
hired someone to investigate us.

701
00:33:32,609 --> 00:33:34,479
[Boyet] But my associate said...

702
00:33:35,278 --> 00:33:36,913
Boss got rid of him.

703
00:33:44,888 --> 00:33:49,760
[school bell ringing]

704
00:33:50,327 --> 00:33:53,263
This is crazy!
Why would Max do such a thing?!

705
00:33:54,065 --> 00:33:55,133
Wait--

706
00:33:55,266 --> 00:33:55,866
weren't you the one
who recommended her

707
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,201
to that digital shoot?

708
00:33:57,902 --> 00:34:01,705
Yeah! But I didn't know
that she'd be sweet with RJ.

709
00:34:01,838 --> 00:34:03,141
She should've just
answered the questions...

710
00:34:03,273 --> 00:34:06,210
so they didn't have to
hold hands and stuff!

711
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:09,780
But I agree with the questions
Max avoided answering.

712
00:34:10,347 --> 00:34:11,315
If I were Deib,

713
00:34:11,882 --> 00:34:14,418
I'd prefer seeing Max dancing
with the other guy...

714
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:17,755
than Max telling me about how
she felt about their first kiss.

715
00:34:18,188 --> 00:34:20,925
I mean, that's so personal.

716
00:34:22,025 --> 00:34:22,592
Please!

717
00:34:23,094 --> 00:34:25,463
If I were Max, I'd lie...

718
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:30,268
and say I felt nothing when I
first kissed my first boyfriend.

719
00:34:30,668 --> 00:34:31,402
Mine,

720
00:34:31,536 --> 00:34:33,003
Randall
was right in front of her!

721
00:34:33,771 --> 00:34:35,273
I think Max was also trying
to be kind to him,

722
00:34:35,405 --> 00:34:36,706
that's why
she didn't answer the question.

723
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:38,576
Same with Randall,

724
00:34:38,708 --> 00:34:40,378
that's why he also
didn't push the question.

725
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:41,244
Wow!

726
00:34:41,878 --> 00:34:44,382
Why are you more concerned about
Randall's feelings than Deib's?

727
00:34:44,514 --> 00:34:45,949
Whose friend are you?

728
00:34:46,818 --> 00:34:47,751
Naih,

729
00:34:47,885 --> 00:34:48,920
I can already sense
that you will turn this..

730
00:34:49,052 --> 00:34:51,789
into a Randall vs. Deib
issue when it's not.

731
00:34:51,922 --> 00:34:52,856
Defensive?

[gloomy music playing]

733
00:34:55,992 --> 00:34:57,527
Just because
I'm friends with someone...

734
00:34:57,661 --> 00:34:59,496
doesn't mean I always have
to share their opinion.

735
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:01,231
And just because
you're my girlfriend...

736
00:35:01,364 --> 00:35:03,000
doesn't mean I should side
with you all the time.

737
00:35:04,068 --> 00:35:06,369
Huh?
Where did that come from?

738
00:35:07,771 --> 00:35:08,940

740
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:18,548
Hey, that was a little harsh.

741
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:22,085
Yeah, you also picked a fight
about Kim before.

742
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,789
Stop you, Ysay. I know
you're gonna take his side.

743
00:35:25,922 --> 00:35:28,159
Naih,
this is not about taking sides.

744
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,163
Naih, sorry but
I agree with Lee.

745
00:35:32,697 --> 00:35:33,431
[Elle]
Just because we're friends...

746
00:35:33,563 --> 00:35:34,331
doesn't mean
we all have to share

747
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:36,567
the same opinions
about everything.

748
00:35:36,934 --> 00:35:38,436
It's not just that.

749
00:35:39,003 --> 00:35:41,371
We can't get on
the same page about anything...

750
00:35:41,873 --> 00:35:44,208
Now we're not even
on the same wavelength

751
00:35:44,342 --> 00:35:45,742
when it comes to love
and friendship?

752
00:35:46,409 --> 00:35:47,644
How are we gonna work?

753
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:54,050
Did you enjoy studying
in Pharos University, sir?

754
00:35:54,619 --> 00:35:57,155
The first few months,
it was hard to adjust.

755
00:35:57,288 --> 00:35:58,989
I got homesick.

756
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:02,360
Then I told myself to focus
and be grateful that...

757
00:36:02,492 --> 00:36:06,364
I got in a super competitive
international university.

758
00:36:06,764 --> 00:36:07,398
So,

759
00:36:07,998 --> 00:36:08,666
yeah,

760
00:36:09,534 --> 00:36:12,869
I enjoyed studying there.
And I think you would, too.

761
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:16,007
If I want to become a lawyer
here in the Philippines,

762
00:36:16,139 --> 00:36:18,976
wouldn't it be better that
I take pre-law here, too?

763
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:20,478
[Mr. Mancol] Not necessarily.

764
00:36:21,112 --> 00:36:24,181
In fact, you can benefit
from having an education abroad.

765
00:36:24,548 --> 00:36:27,018
You'd see
Philippines' legal issues

766

from a global perspective.

767
00:36:30,054 --> 00:36:32,690
You can count on
a recommendation letter from me

768

Max, please. I'm sorry.

775
00:36:59,349 --> 00:37:02,452
Should I chase after you like
you chased after me yesterday?

776
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:03,887
Maybe.

777
00:37:04,989 --> 00:37:05,690
Dunno.

778
00:37:05,822 --> 00:37:06,523
MOO!

[Deib] Babybabe!

780
00:37:08,291 --> 00:37:09,626
Deib, can we do this later?

781
00:37:10,027 --> 00:37:11,161
[Max]
We gotta go to the career talk.

782
00:37:11,528 --> 00:37:14,130
We need that
to plan for the future.

783
00:37:14,764 --> 00:37:16,800
I can't imagine
a future without you.

784
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,503
So, please, can we talk?

I'm sorry, MOO.

788

-What?

00:37:46,463 --> 00:37:48,032
You're gonna pick another fight?

791
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:52,469
I'll reenact our first kiss.

792
00:37:53,304 --> 00:37:54,972
No barrier this time.

793
00:37:55,905 --> 00:37:57,708
Think you can sway me
with a kiss?

794
00:37:58,943 --> 00:37:59,643
Maybe?

795
00:38:00,411 --> 00:38:01,077

Sorry for overreacting.

00:38:18,461 --> 00:38:19,730
I was hurt.

801

Don't you trust me?

802
00:38:25,101 --> 00:38:28,005
It hurt that you even had
to ask if I kissed him.

803
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:30,141
Ouch.

804
00:38:31,141 --> 00:38:32,208
I'm sorry.

805
00:38:34,045 --> 00:38:34,744
I guess...

806
00:38:36,914 --> 00:38:39,349
I guess a part of me
is still not over the trauma...

807
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:41,152
from what happened with Kim...

808
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:43,253
[Max] I understand.

809
00:38:43,721 --> 00:38:44,889
But I'm not Kim.

810
00:38:46,724 --> 00:38:49,025
And you are not
in that relationship anymore.

00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:58,702

Okay.

825

Tell me you love me
without saying that you love me.

I'll go first.

827
00:39:46,851 --> 00:39:48,786
I'll tell you "I love you"

what if you haven't
moved on from Echavez?

Maybe that's why
he's still in your life.

sometimes,
you're so insensitive...

835
00:40:16,246 --> 00:40:19,083

how I'd feel

when you're with your ex.

Then I realized...

00:40:24,054 --> 00:40:26,023
I'm the one
who can't move on.

839

as if you're Kim.

890
00:43:22,666 --> 00:43:24,134
[Lorde's vlog playing on phone]

891
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:28,038
[Lorde] Tob, Michiko, you're at
a party! Not a Zumba class!

892
00:43:28,472 --> 00:43:30,074
[Lorde] To the left,
to the right, to the left,

893
00:43:30,206 --> 00:43:31,041
to the right, to the left.

894
00:43:31,175 --> 00:43:32,610
[Deib]
Lorde and his crazy antics.

895
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:33,943
[Dale] HAHAHA. Classic Lorde!

896
00:43:34,077 --> 00:43:35,112
[Michiko]
HAHAHA wait 'til the end!

897
00:43:35,244 --> 00:43:36,847
[Dale] You look beautiful!

898
00:43:39,583 --> 00:43:41,318
Exchanging sweet texts already?!

899
00:43:51,461 --> 00:43:51,961
"Awesome!"

900
00:43:52,096 --> 00:43:53,530
[brothers laughing]

901
00:43:53,664 --> 00:43:54,498
[Evita] Look at them.

902
00:43:55,298 --> 00:43:57,534
Look, it's now Deib
taking care of Dale.

903
00:43:58,235 --> 00:44:00,436
I think everything's
gonna be alright, hon.

904
00:44:02,639 --> 00:44:03,206
[door opens]

905
00:44:04,807 --> 00:44:06,476
[indistinct greetings]

906
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:09,079
Atty. San Diego,
you have some good news for us?

907
00:44:09,746 --> 00:44:13,117
Yeah, we found the private
investigator that Deib hired.

908
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:14,050
What?

909
00:44:14,851 --> 00:44:16,119
[tense music playing]

910
00:44:16,253 --> 00:44:17,721
[Deib] Did he send you
the CCTV footage?

911
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:22,860
Unfortunately, no. We found out
that he's in this hospital.

912
00:44:23,226 --> 00:44:23,594
What?

913
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:25,061
Is this him?

914
00:44:28,498 --> 00:44:29,333
Yeah, that's him.

915
00:44:29,699 --> 00:44:30,934
Wait, let me see!

916
00:44:31,534 --> 00:44:32,469
[Evita] Oh my God!

917
00:44:33,403 --> 00:44:37,074
This is my patient!
He was brought here a month ago.

918
00:44:37,807 --> 00:44:39,342
Hit and run.

919
00:44:39,476 --> 00:44:41,277
The people who brought him here
said he was just left for dead--

920
00:44:41,411 --> 00:44:42,211
Mom,
you're telling me this guy...

921
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:43,146
-was here this whole time?
-Yes!

922
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,081
What room?

923
00:44:44,213 --> 00:44:46,949
What are we standing here for?
Let's go!

924
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:49,485
He died of cardiac arrest.

925
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:51,088
[Daniel] He what?!

926
00:44:51,588 --> 00:44:52,121
When?

927
00:44:52,255 --> 00:44:53,556
[Evita] He died yesterday.

928
00:45:05,034 --> 00:45:08,706
What's the urgent matter
you wanna tell me, Uncle?

929
00:45:10,306 --> 00:45:12,141
[Bhaves] Boyet, spit it out.

930
00:45:12,275 --> 00:45:15,579
Boyet, I'm getting nervous.

931
00:45:24,987 --> 00:45:25,655
Max...

932
00:45:27,690 --> 00:45:29,193
The thing is...

933
00:45:31,427 --> 00:45:34,431
The night
Deib's brother was shot,

934
00:45:40,603 --> 00:45:41,538
I was there...

935
00:45:43,139 --> 00:45:45,074
What were you doing there?

936
00:45:47,677 --> 00:45:51,047
I only did it because
we needed money so badly...

937
00:45:52,782 --> 00:45:53,684
[Bhaves] What did you do?

938
00:45:58,288 --> 00:46:00,190
Max, I was part of the gang

939
00:46:00,324 --> 00:46:01,692
that attempted
to carnap Deib and Dale's car.

940
00:46:02,693 --> 00:46:03,559
[Bhaves] What?!

941
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:10,067
[tragic music playing]

942
00:46:49,005 --> 00:46:51,608
Is there anybody else who knows
about your carnapping plans?

943
00:46:51,742 --> 00:46:52,208
No.

944
00:46:52,342 --> 00:46:53,242
It's confirmed:

945
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:55,913
Agila sent someone to get a copy

946
00:46:56,045 --> 00:46:58,181
of the CCTV footage
of Dale's shooting.

947
00:46:58,315 --> 00:47:02,552
I love you so much.
Don't ever forget that.

948
00:47:03,052 --> 00:47:05,389
[Max] Thank you.
I know I hurt you.

949
00:47:06,889 --> 00:47:08,291
[RJ] We've been through so much
together.

950
00:47:08,425 --> 00:47:09,425
I just can't
throw all that away.

951
00:47:09,559 --> 00:47:11,228
Hands off Lee!
He is not for sale.

952
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:15,364
Find your own boyfriend!

953
00:47:15,965 --> 00:47:17,201
How could you lie to me, Max?

954
00:47:17,733 --> 00:47:18,869
I know the truth!

955
00:47:19,001 --> 00:47:21,538
I know Uncle Boyet is involved
with what happened to Dale.
