1
00:00:01,768 --> 00:00:02,902
[Deib] He shot my brother!

2
00:00:03,036 --> 00:00:05,437
Uncle Boyet is not a bad person,
Deib.

3
00:00:05,738 --> 00:00:07,139
Stop lying to me, Max!

4
00:00:07,272 --> 00:00:08,208
So you don't believe her?

5
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:09,708
I don't know what to believe
anymore...

6
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:12,746
[Deib] All I know is I wanna
find
the person who hurt you.

7
00:00:12,878 --> 00:00:13,779
[Dale] What if that's Uncle
Boyet?

8
00:00:13,913 --> 00:00:15,214
It's a message from Johann.

9
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:15,881
[Lee] He saved a slot
for both of us

10
00:00:16,015 --> 00:00:17,417
at Forever Art camp!

11
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:18,617
I want to heal.

12
00:00:18,751 --> 00:00:19,753
Do you want to heal, too?

13
00:00:19,885 --> 00:00:22,121
[Michiko] Let's get better
together, batchmate.

14
00:00:22,254 --> 00:00:23,222
[Maxim] You both played well.

15
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:25,125
Where do you plan to try out for
varsity?

16
00:00:25,492 --> 00:00:27,092
[Deib, RJ] Stella Orientis
University.

17
00:00:29,062 --> 00:00:31,964
Why do you keep going to him?
He's your ex! I'm your
boyfriend!

18
00:00:32,265 --> 00:00:33,165
Are we still together?

19
00:00:37,036 --> 00:00:38,371
Deib, I'm so tired.

20
00:00:40,673 --> 00:00:42,042
It hurts so much!

21
00:00:43,942 --> 00:00:44,777
I'm tired.

22
00:00:45,645 --> 00:00:47,847
["Did I Let You Go" by Jon
Guelas playing]

23
00:00:48,515 --> 00:00:50,383
I don't even know
if we're still together.

24
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,085
[Max] Are we?

25
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:54,753
Are we still together?

26
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:58,024
Why are you asking that, Max?

27
00:01:00,093 --> 00:01:01,161
Are you breaking up with me?

28
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:05,597
I don't know.

29
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:11,504
- [Deib] Let's go talk.
- [RJ] Let's go, Max.

30
00:01:13,605 --> 00:01:14,441
Let's talk.

31
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:16,376
We need to talk.

32
00:01:21,947 --> 00:01:22,748
RJ...

33
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:25,251
I'll call you later.

34
00:01:38,197 --> 00:01:39,364
[both] Are you okay?

35
00:01:40,165 --> 00:01:42,501
[sad music playing]

36
00:01:44,037 --> 00:01:44,671
No...

37
00:01:47,272 --> 00:01:48,441
I'm not okay...

38
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:52,111
I don't know
what to believe anymore.

39
00:01:53,412 --> 00:01:55,248
I don't know what the truth
is...

40
00:01:55,915 --> 00:01:57,216
I'm not okay, Deib.

41
00:01:58,584 --> 00:02:01,254
I want to believe
Uncle Boyet so badly.

42
00:02:01,954 --> 00:02:02,688
But...

43
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:04,990
when you played the evidence,

44
00:02:05,924 --> 00:02:08,561
and I saw the video
of the other carnapper...

45
00:02:09,628 --> 00:02:12,098
I don't know what to believe
anymore.

46
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,735
That's not the Uncle Boyet I
know.

47
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,570
He would never do that, Deib.

48
00:02:21,574 --> 00:02:23,810
You always see the good in
people, Max.

49
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:28,681
You saw the good in me

50
00:02:29,681 --> 00:02:31,550
when I couldn't see it in
myself.

51
00:02:34,219 --> 00:02:37,789
I know that's how you want me
to see the good in people, too.

52
00:02:40,092 --> 00:02:42,829
And I'm trying so hard to do
just that.

53
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:46,399
I want to believe that
Uncle Boyet is innocent, too.

54
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:47,834
I really do...

55
00:02:49,701 --> 00:02:51,304
but it's hard, Max.

56
00:02:52,538 --> 00:02:53,406
It's hard.

57
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:55,908
I understand.

58
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:01,181
Maybe that's why
you always think I'm lying--

59
00:03:02,748 --> 00:03:03,750
I'm sorry.

60
00:03:06,652 --> 00:03:07,387
Deib,

61
00:03:10,455 --> 00:03:12,925
I believe Uncle Boyet is
innocent.

62
00:03:14,993 --> 00:03:16,596
If he confesses...

63
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:19,932
that he shot Dale,

64
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,038
and we find evidence more solid
than the carnapper's testimony

65
00:03:25,671 --> 00:03:27,340
that proves Uncle Boyet did it,

66
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:31,311
then I'd make him surrender
myself.

67
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:34,747
But until that happens,

68
00:03:35,914 --> 00:03:37,483
I believe Uncle Boyet.

69
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:41,221
I understand.

70
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,556
I understand, Max...

71
00:03:44,223 --> 00:03:46,192
But I hope you believe in us,
too.

72
00:03:46,325 --> 00:03:48,193
[hopeful music playing]

73
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:51,463
I want to believe that our love
can survive this.

74
00:03:55,801 --> 00:03:58,403
Your love is the one good thing
about me, Max.

75
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:01,407
I don't want to let this go.

76
00:04:02,641 --> 00:04:04,610
I don't want to let us go.

77
00:04:06,111 --> 00:04:06,913
And...

78
00:04:07,312 --> 00:04:08,914
As hard as it is...

79
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:10,750
to hold on...

80
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:12,985
I'm holding on.

81
00:04:16,088 --> 00:04:17,689
I'm holding on to you.

82
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:21,961
I'm holding on to you, too.

83
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,898
And I'm not letting go.

84
00:04:39,177 --> 00:04:40,779
["He's Into Her" by BGYO
playing]

85
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:44,242
I wonder how
Max and Deib are doing.

86
00:05:44,976 --> 00:05:47,747
Our chat groups
are filled with them.

87
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:51,416
Hope they make up soon.

88
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:53,418
I hope so, too.

89
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,053
But you know,

90
00:05:55,687 --> 00:05:58,324
I'm glad we're far away
from all that noise in Benison.

91
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,526
Yeah, me too.

92
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:04,831
I'm happy that we're learning
a lot from Johann.

93
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:08,367
And that we just get to create
and surround ourselves

94
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,504
with art and other creative
people.

95
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:14,740
Happy to be here with you, Ysay!

96
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:17,910
[Johann] Good morning!

97
00:06:20,346 --> 00:06:21,113
[Ysay] Johann!

98
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:24,850
You're here this early because?

99
00:06:24,983 --> 00:06:27,420
We want to get your feedback
about our work, Johann.

100
00:06:27,552 --> 00:06:29,221
Yeah, here.

101
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:30,923
Hmm...

102
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:33,358
[Johann] Okay, what is this
about?

103
00:06:34,627 --> 00:06:35,827
[both] First love.

104
00:06:36,661 --> 00:06:38,163
There's no cohesion.

105
00:06:38,697 --> 00:06:41,401
It's like two very different
works

106
00:06:41,533 --> 00:06:45,103
of two different people,
forced together.

107
00:06:46,338 --> 00:06:48,473
This isn't anything like a
collaboration.

108
00:06:49,074 --> 00:06:50,041
[Lee] Umm...

109
00:06:50,675 --> 00:06:53,413
You don't think it works, Sir
Johann?

110
00:06:53,545 --> 00:06:55,548
Two people in the same
relationship

111
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,583
can experience love differently.

112
00:06:57,716 --> 00:07:00,552
But the moment two people
choose to love each other

113
00:07:00,685 --> 00:07:02,754
and be in a relationship,

114
00:07:03,288 --> 00:07:06,425
they choose to live
a shared life with each other.

115
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:08,827
There's a sense of oneness.

116
00:07:10,529 --> 00:07:11,898
Look at your artwork.

117
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:14,699
Your work doesn't scream
"in a relationship."

118
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:17,502
Nothing there merges the two.

119
00:07:18,603 --> 00:07:21,774
It's almost as if the artists
were too afraid

120
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:24,509
to really connect with each
other.

121
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:31,050
An artistic collaboration is a
lot like love.

122
00:07:31,817 --> 00:07:34,120
To achieve a sense of
togetherness,

123
00:07:35,053 --> 00:07:38,824
sometimes artists need to
really spend time together,

124
00:07:39,658 --> 00:07:43,095
sometimes, even falling in love
with each other.

125
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:44,896
Umm...

126
00:07:47,098 --> 00:07:50,903
I'm not saying you have
some kind of sordid affair!

127
00:07:52,204 --> 00:07:52,904
Okay,

128
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:55,540
good, 'cause I don't...

129
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:58,244
Yeah, same.
I don't approve of...

130
00:07:58,377 --> 00:07:59,946
[laughs]

131
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:00,980
Okay.

132
00:08:01,112 --> 00:08:03,182
Good to know you kids
haven't lost your way.

133
00:08:03,315 --> 00:08:04,916
[both laugh]

134
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:07,452
You can have a romantic
relationship

135
00:08:07,586 --> 00:08:11,122
with another person
while having a work spouse.

136
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:15,261
You rely on each other
for support and inspiration.

137
00:08:15,761 --> 00:08:19,064
You're so in sync,
it's like you're married.

138
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,201
[Lee coughs]

139
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:23,802
[Naih] We'll handle Max over
here.

140
00:08:23,935 --> 00:08:29,341
We gotta distract her well
so she doesn't notice Deib.

141
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:30,776
[Lorde] Alert us when she
arrives...

142
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:33,346
so we can distract
Master Deib, too! Copy?

143
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:34,947
Copy, copy! Over and out!

144
00:08:37,216 --> 00:08:39,118
Hey, boneheads,
Max is there already!

145
00:08:39,251 --> 00:08:40,852
[Naih] Hey! Deib's arrived, too!

146
00:08:40,986 --> 00:08:42,654
- Deib's there!
- Wake up!

00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:43,956

151
00:08:48,995 --> 00:08:50,629
You look so fresh these days!

152
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:53,164
What's your beauty secret?
Share it with us!

153
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:54,432

155
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,609
[Naih] Oh, it's going down!

157
00:09:05,543 --> 00:09:06,546
[Naih] Hey.

158
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:09,682
[Naih] Oh.

159
00:09:11,783 --> 00:09:12,784
What's happening?

160
00:09:13,285 --> 00:09:14,552
It's so--

161
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:16,054
[Karlie] Oh my God! Look!

162
00:09:16,989 --> 00:09:20,960
[awkward chuckle]
What's happening?

163
00:09:21,092 --> 00:09:22,562
[chuckles]

164
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:24,462
Dang, I lost!

165
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,465
We made a bet whether you broke
up.

166
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:29,335
So, are you still together?

167
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:31,303
Of course!
No one's letting go, right, Max?

168
00:09:31,736 --> 00:09:32,971
No one's letting go.

169
00:09:34,606 --> 00:09:37,976
Well, that's good!

170
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:40,645
-[Migz] Got nervous for a sec!
-[Naih] That's right.

171
00:09:40,779 --> 00:09:41,846
-[school bell rings]
-[Naih] Good!

172
00:09:43,548 --> 00:09:44,817
[Naih] Very good!

173
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:47,720
Are you okay, Kim?

174
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:50,022
What?

175
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:52,892
Atty. San Diego,
can you tell them about this

176
00:09:53,024 --> 00:09:55,695
landmark case 15 years ago?

177
00:09:55,827 --> 00:09:59,398
It's a similar case,
except it was reckless driving.

178
00:10:00,032 --> 00:10:02,268
A six-wheeler truck
plowed down a car...

179
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,605
and rendered the victim
paralyzed from the waist down.

180
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:08,039
He's stuck in a wheelchair
forever.

181
00:10:08,841 --> 00:10:09,808
That's horrible.

182
00:10:10,475 --> 00:10:11,443
[Attorney] It is.

183
00:10:11,576 --> 00:10:14,413
The Supreme Court
ordered both the driver

184
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:16,282
and the company that owned the
truck,

185
00:10:16,615 --> 00:10:17,783
a big pharma company,

186
00:10:18,484 --> 00:10:22,388
to pay not just actual damages,
but also compensatory ones:

187
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:27,225
life care, incapacity to earn,
moral damages, all that.

188
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,394
Just like you, Dale,

189
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:32,264
the victim was a basketball
player
with a bright future.

190
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:35,701
[Dale] But in my case,

191
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:39,004
there's no big pharma company
that we can sue.

192
00:10:40,572 --> 00:10:43,142
Boyet and his family have no
money.

193
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:46,312
If we push for this,

194
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:50,649
we aren't punishing just Boyet
but also his family.

195
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:56,254
If he's proven guilty,

196
00:10:57,188 --> 00:11:00,058
isn't it enough
for him to go to jail?

197
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:02,193
You're too nice, son.

198
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:05,998
I'd like to think Deib
and I got that from you.

199
00:11:06,131 --> 00:11:07,832
[Attorney] Don't worry Evita,
Daniel.

200
00:11:07,966 --> 00:11:10,602
We will make sure we win Dale's
case.

201
00:11:10,735 --> 00:11:11,136
[phone pings]

202
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:14,706
[Kim] Hi, Uncle.
I'm just worried about Deib.

203
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,541
I thought you should see this.

204
00:11:15,673 --> 00:11:16,509
What's this?

205
00:11:16,642 --> 00:11:17,342
What's wrong?

206
00:11:17,475 --> 00:11:18,110
[scoffs]

207
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:18,744
[Dale] What's that?

208
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:21,212
Your pigheaded son. Look!

209
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,885
- [Max] Good morning, MOO.
- [Deib] Good morning, Babybabe.

210
00:11:27,886 --> 00:11:29,187
[Naih] What's happening?

211
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:33,558
I already explained to you that
you have to stop seeing Max.

212
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:37,830
Atty. San Diego warned us:
don't talk to her

213
00:11:37,962 --> 00:11:40,298
to avoid accidentally
leaking information,

214
00:11:40,432 --> 00:11:44,736
which means
you could say something

215
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,905
that would compromise the case!

216
00:11:47,038 --> 00:11:48,506
We have to be strategic about
this!

217
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,542
Don't you get it?

218
00:11:50,442 --> 00:11:51,744
- I know, Dad!
- No!

219
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:53,913
You're acting like you don't
know it!

220
00:11:55,114 --> 00:11:56,649
I have Kim to thank for the
picture.

221
00:11:56,782 --> 00:11:59,918
You're still seeing Max!

222
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:05,524
Maybe their camp thinks
everything's okay now!

223
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:06,692
We're backing off!

224
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:08,961
Case closed! We forgive them!

225
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:11,864
All's well that ends well.
Everything's not alright, Deib!

226
00:12:12,197 --> 00:12:13,966
Of course not, Dad!

227
00:12:14,866 --> 00:12:16,268
They left my brother Dale for
dead!

228
00:12:17,068 --> 00:12:19,038
Precisely my point!

229
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,474
If only you'd just...

230
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:26,578
use your brain and be
considerate of your brother,

231
00:12:26,711 --> 00:12:27,812
you wouldn't even think about

232
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:30,750
having any contact with that
girl!

233
00:12:31,549 --> 00:12:34,754
We don't know where they came
from,

234
00:12:34,886 --> 00:12:36,922
but it probably runs in the
family--

235
00:12:37,623 --> 00:12:39,457
So are you saying
we'll ruin everyone's lives,

236
00:12:39,591 --> 00:12:40,658
even the innocent ones, Dad?

237
00:12:40,993 --> 00:12:42,061
Is that it?!

238
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:43,596
Do they deserve this?!

239
00:12:44,129 --> 00:12:45,464
You don't know them!

240
00:12:45,597 --> 00:12:46,698
And neither do you!

241
00:12:46,831 --> 00:12:48,200
You're blinded by your
infatuation

242
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:49,000
with that girl--

243
00:12:49,134 --> 00:12:52,270
I'm not infatuated with her!

244
00:12:54,005 --> 00:12:55,173
I love her!

245
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:57,475
Max is a good person!

246
00:12:58,677 --> 00:12:59,845
That, Deib.

247
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:02,514
That determination, that
passion?

248
00:13:03,048 --> 00:13:03,948
How I wish you have

249
00:13:04,082 --> 00:13:06,619
the same level of commitment
to your brother!

250
00:13:06,751 --> 00:13:08,287
[somber music playing]

251
00:13:08,419 --> 00:13:10,923
Do you love that girl
more than your own blood?!

252
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:14,626
You know, Deib,

253
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:16,562
your brother Dale,
if he doesn't get...

254
00:13:18,563 --> 00:13:20,566
He might need to have
someone take care of him

255
00:13:20,698 --> 00:13:22,500
for the rest of his life...

256
00:13:22,934 --> 00:13:24,269
thanks to Boyet.

257
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:29,240
What will happen...

258
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:31,976
When your mom and I are gone?

259
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:34,513
You don't care about your
brother.

260
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,182
We can't leave him with you.

261
00:13:38,283 --> 00:13:41,253
As always, you're just
gonna do what you want.

262
00:13:41,386 --> 00:13:42,153
Right, Deib?

263
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:45,557
If this family cannot count on
you,

264
00:13:46,491 --> 00:13:48,326
tell us now,

265
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:50,395
so your mom and I
can make arrangements

266
00:13:50,528 --> 00:13:53,631
to ensure that
there will be people,

267
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,302
or at least
someone in his life,

268
00:13:56,434 --> 00:13:59,672
who can take care
of your brother

269
00:13:59,804 --> 00:14:00,940
because obviously...

270
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,807
you refuse to be a good son

271
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:04,442
and,
even less, a good brother.

272
00:14:06,778 --> 00:14:07,446
Dad,

273
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:10,481
I didn't...

274
00:14:13,485 --> 00:14:14,320
I'm sorry.

275
00:14:19,591 --> 00:14:23,361
Break off with that girl.
Stop seeing that family.

276
00:14:23,495 --> 00:14:27,566
No phone calls, no texts.
End it.

277
00:14:29,634 --> 00:14:30,501
You hear me?

278
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:55,860
[door closes]

279
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:58,129
What are you doing here?

280
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:00,566
We need to talk.

281
00:15:02,701 --> 00:15:04,068
Are you still seeing Deib?

282
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:05,471
[Randy] Max,

283
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:07,740
I know this is difficult,

284
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:10,808
but it's safer that
you don't get involved

285
00:15:10,942 --> 00:15:13,611
with each other
until this case is over.

286
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:14,546
And...

287
00:15:14,846 --> 00:15:17,349
For Boyet's sake...

288
00:15:17,783 --> 00:15:18,517
[Maxim] Sweetie,

289
00:15:19,217 --> 00:15:21,019
I think you and Deib should...

290
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,522
What do you call it
in your generation now?

291
00:15:23,655 --> 00:15:26,825
In our time,
we called it "cool off."

292
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:30,129
[Randy] Maybe, Max,
just put everything on pause.

293
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:33,731
Just resume the relationship
when this is over.

294
00:15:36,501 --> 00:15:40,172
Well, if we get to prove Boyet's
innocence.

295
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:42,341
Not just in court.

296
00:15:42,774 --> 00:15:47,011
Yes, even if we get a
"not guilty" verdict in court,

297
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:52,116
if they believed that Boyet did
it,

298
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:54,153
they'd still be resentful.

299
00:15:55,354 --> 00:16:01,493
In that case, we need proof
to back up Boyet's claims

300
00:16:01,626 --> 00:16:04,797
and a confession
from the real shooter.

301
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:16,774
How are you?

302
00:16:18,443 --> 00:16:20,511
Dad and I fought earlier.

303
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:23,782
He wants me to end things with
you.

304
00:16:25,216 --> 00:16:26,719
[Max] Dad talked to me, too.

305
00:16:27,485 --> 00:16:29,587
He said we should break up.

306
00:16:31,823 --> 00:16:33,591
I know that we must make
the necessary sacrifices

307
00:16:33,725 --> 00:16:34,860
for our families.

308
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:35,660
But...

309
00:16:37,462 --> 00:16:38,931
Max, I...

310
00:16:39,063 --> 00:16:41,466
We shouldn't let this affect
us...

311
00:16:44,769 --> 00:16:45,437
Yeah.

312
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,374
We can respect

313
00:16:48,907 --> 00:16:50,274
their wishes--

314
00:16:50,942 --> 00:16:52,543
But we promised:

315
00:16:53,812 --> 00:16:55,147
no one's letting go...

316
00:16:56,914 --> 00:16:57,883
No one lets go.

317
00:16:59,384 --> 00:17:00,785
We'll get through this together.

318
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,159
I love you, MOO.

319
00:17:08,326 --> 00:17:09,694
I love you, too.

320
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:15,233
MOO,

321
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:18,136
[Deib] we're not breaking up,
okay?

322
00:17:21,105 --> 00:17:22,240

â™ª Our love for each other

â™ª What matters now
Is we have each other â™ª

â™ª Any burden is light with us

359

â™ª So I'll be here for you â™ª

360
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:20,919
â™ª I'll be beside you 'til the
end â™ª

361
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,721
I've missed you, Babybabe.

362
00:20:23,888 --> 00:20:26,290
The day feels longer
when we're not together,

363
00:20:26,424 --> 00:20:27,425
doesn't it?

364
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:29,827
I've missed you, too, MOO.

365
00:20:30,528 --> 00:20:32,096
Now we don't have to pretend.

367
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:47,913
I'm not gonna read that text.

368
00:20:48,512 --> 00:20:49,480
- You sure?
- [Deib] Mhmm.

369
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:51,215
Might be important.

370
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:54,118
Max, what could possibly
be more important than this?

371
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,453
Seriously.

372
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:57,288
What if it's the acceptance
letter

373
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,090
for your college application?

374
00:21:01,492 --> 00:21:03,761
Why do you always have
to make sense?!

[light thud]

376
00:21:15,406 --> 00:21:16,141
Deib.

377
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:19,577
Why don't we just turn off
our phones for now?

378
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:23,648
Let's tune out all the chaos and
noise.

379
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:25,450
Hmm?

I think we should, uh...

[Naih] @Lee @Ysay
When are you coming back?!

386
00:22:04,122 --> 00:22:05,589
Our friends are giving me
whiplash.

387
00:22:05,723 --> 00:22:06,724
One day they're talking,

388
00:22:06,857 --> 00:22:08,426
the next,
they're ignoring each other!

389
00:22:08,826 --> 00:22:11,128
I miss you Lee, get back please.

390
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:13,898
You okay?

391
00:22:14,566 --> 00:22:15,334
Yeah.

392
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:19,738
Naih says Deib and Max
are ignoring each other.

393
00:22:20,071 --> 00:22:23,208
Oh no, my Tagsen shipper heart!

[both laugh]

395
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:28,246
Weren't you a Deib-Kim shipper?

396
00:22:28,579 --> 00:22:30,615
Yeah! Super fan!

397
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:32,183
Imagine their story:

398
00:22:32,317 --> 00:22:36,621
childhood sweethearts
conquering the world together.

399
00:22:37,655 --> 00:22:39,458
I want a love like theirs.

400
00:22:40,291 --> 00:22:43,095
Or you also want
Deib to be your boyfriend?

401
00:22:43,228 --> 00:22:44,128
Hmm?

402
00:22:44,695 --> 00:22:52,837
I already saw you
following us around

403
00:22:52,971 --> 00:22:55,073
before Deib and Kim were
official.

404
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:56,441
Oh...

405
00:22:56,575 --> 00:22:58,743
You've been a fan of Deib ever
since.

406
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:03,382
Fan? Yes. Crush? No.

407
00:23:03,515 --> 00:23:04,715
I thought he was cool,
so I became a fan,

408
00:23:04,849 --> 00:23:07,419
but I never imagined him
as my boyfriend.

409
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:10,188
He was never my crush.

410
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:13,057
You have a crush on someone
else?

411
00:23:15,026 --> 00:23:15,826
Is it Hunter?

412
00:23:16,795 --> 00:23:17,863
That's in the past.

413
00:23:18,864 --> 00:23:20,731

00:23:20,865 --> 00:23:21,967
No!

418
00:23:28,373 --> 00:23:30,208
I'm running out of names here.

419
00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:33,077
Why do you wanna know?

420
00:23:33,845 --> 00:23:35,313
I'm just curious.

421
00:23:36,381 --> 00:23:37,315
Who is it?

422
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:40,618
Is it me?

423
00:23:40,986 --> 00:23:45,056
[sweet music playing]

424
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:47,259
Me?

425
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,828
I'm your crush?

426
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:59,938
It's just a crush.
That's all it'll ever be.

427
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:01,605
Naih will kill me otherwise!

429
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:13,751
Sorry, Lee,

430
00:24:14,185 --> 00:24:16,253
I got a crush on you.
I didn't mean to--

431
00:24:16,387 --> 00:24:17,989
No need to apologize.

432
00:24:20,057 --> 00:24:23,828
And we don't have to
make things awkward between us.

433
00:24:24,863 --> 00:24:26,832
Let's not make it awkward...

434
00:24:27,598 --> 00:24:29,701
Yeah, but...

435
00:24:30,268 --> 00:24:31,068
having a crush on you

436
00:24:31,202 --> 00:24:33,137
makes me feel like
I'm betraying Naih.

437
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:34,839
No, you're not.

438
00:24:36,074 --> 00:24:38,108
You're not doing anything wrong.

439
00:24:38,777 --> 00:24:40,511
We're not doing anything wrong.

440
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:42,881
So...

441
00:24:44,182 --> 00:24:44,982
it's okay.

442
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:46,984
I mean...

443
00:24:47,451 --> 00:24:48,252
We're friends,

444
00:24:48,886 --> 00:24:50,055

445
00:24:50,721 --> 00:24:51,856
Friends.

446
00:24:52,857 --> 00:24:54,058
Work spouses.

The head coach
of Stella Orientis University

453
00:25:29,294 --> 00:25:30,929
just invited me to special
tryouts

for the varsity team.

Dude!

00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:36,268
That's great news! Let's go!

457
00:25:36,401 --> 00:25:39,570
You've always wanted
to play for that university.

-[Evita] I'm so proud of you,
son.
-[Dale] That's insane!

00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:44,976
Good. You have something else
to focus on.

460
00:25:45,242 --> 00:25:46,377
[Evita] Daniel, please, it's--

461
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:48,480
[phone ringing]

462
00:25:49,647 --> 00:25:50,481
Yes, Attorney?

463
00:25:50,981 --> 00:25:52,483
Okay, just give me one second.

464
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:54,318
What's wrong, Dad?

465
00:25:54,451 --> 00:25:56,755
Nothing, son. I just have to
step out.

466
00:25:57,454 --> 00:25:58,789
Why? If it's something
important,

467
00:25:58,923 --> 00:26:00,392
we all want to hear it.

468
00:26:01,125 --> 00:26:02,626
Evita, I'm not comfortable
saying anything

469
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,194
in front of Deib.

470
00:26:04,628 --> 00:26:06,263
You know he talks--

471
00:26:06,397 --> 00:26:09,300
Dad, Deib already said
he hasn't been seeing Max.

472
00:26:09,433 --> 00:26:13,637
Deib promised!
Why can't you trust our son?

473

[sighs deeply]

474
00:26:14,838 --> 00:26:16,374
Okay, fine.

475
00:26:16,974 --> 00:26:18,910
But if the investigation gets
compromised,

476
00:26:19,044 --> 00:26:20,979
it's on you, Deib.

477
00:26:22,614 --> 00:26:23,615
Go ahead, Attorney.

478
00:26:24,648 --> 00:26:26,151
[Attorney] Hi, Daniel.
I just got news

479
00:26:26,284 --> 00:26:28,086
that the police
are closing in on Boyet.

480
00:26:28,787 --> 00:26:32,022
He's hiding in Bantug,
a remote barangay in MuÃ±oz,

481
00:26:32,156 --> 00:26:34,526
the southernmost town
in the province of Buenavista.

[tense music playing]

483
00:26:35,826 --> 00:26:38,730
Congressman Araneta's office
gave me the update.

484
00:26:39,364 --> 00:26:40,365
The police are on high alert

485
00:26:40,498 --> 00:26:43,835
to make sure that Boyet can't
escape.

486
00:26:43,969 --> 00:26:53,545
[tense music escalates]

487
00:26:53,678 --> 00:26:55,246
[music stops]

488
00:27:02,319 --> 00:27:04,388
Uncle Boyet should just
surrender.

489
00:27:04,823 --> 00:27:05,457
Deib.

490
00:27:06,223 --> 00:27:07,358
If he went to prison,

491
00:27:07,491 --> 00:27:09,626
the syndicate would have him
killed on the first day.

492
00:27:10,996 --> 00:27:12,596
Does he know anyone in MuÃ±oz?

493
00:27:13,163 --> 00:27:14,531
Is someone helping him hide
there?

494
00:27:16,534 --> 00:27:17,402
MuÃ±oz?

495
00:27:23,708 --> 00:27:24,576
He's there.

496
00:27:26,577 --> 00:27:29,146
Did he go there
to visit his syndicate boss?

497
00:27:29,713 --> 00:27:32,182
Deib, Uncle Boyet
is not part of the syndicate.

498
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:33,317
He just got involved with them
because--

499
00:27:33,451 --> 00:27:35,753
So your mom was the only one
in the syndicate--

500
00:27:35,886 --> 00:27:37,555
She left all that behind.

501
00:27:37,689 --> 00:27:39,691
That's why she went to Japan
as an OFW.

502
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:40,791
That's your mom.

504
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:43,327
How are you sure that Uncle
Boyet wasn't really involved--

[phone flips]

506
00:27:50,402 --> 00:27:51,269
It's Elle.

507
00:27:52,971 --> 00:27:54,172
I still can't contact Uncle
Boyet.

508
00:27:54,305 --> 00:27:55,306
You don't need to show me that.

509
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,143
You might think I'm lying.

510
00:28:08,118 --> 00:28:09,421
I'm sorry, Max.

511
00:28:11,288 --> 00:28:13,724
I know we promised that
we wouldn't talk about this.

512
00:28:16,461 --> 00:28:17,194
It's okay.

513
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:21,799
Let's talk about something else.

514
00:28:24,469 --> 00:28:28,373
I was invited to try out
for Stella Orientis University.

515
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:30,741
Congrats!

516
00:28:31,041 --> 00:28:32,711
Randall is trying out, too.

517
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,449
Will you watch?

518
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:39,683
I need you there...

519
00:28:40,184 --> 00:28:41,419
to support me.

520
00:28:42,119 --> 00:28:43,387
I want to,

521
00:28:44,355 --> 00:28:46,090
but what about your family?

522
00:28:48,125 --> 00:28:48,727
[chuckles]

523
00:28:55,799 --> 00:28:57,736

525
00:29:04,174 --> 00:29:05,109
Hi, Grams...

526
00:29:08,946 --> 00:29:09,646
What's wrong?

527
00:29:17,188 --> 00:29:18,455
I feel like...

528
00:29:20,391 --> 00:29:24,496
Each text I get, Deib suspects
it's from Uncle Boyet

529
00:29:25,063 --> 00:29:26,765
and I'm just keeping it from
him.

530
00:29:27,965 --> 00:29:29,366
I can't do anything...

531
00:29:30,701 --> 00:29:33,637
for fear that he'd misinterpret
it.

532
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:39,210
Like earlier, he said
Uncle Boyet is in MuÃ±oz--

533
00:29:41,813 --> 00:29:43,847
They've found Boyet?

534
00:29:46,084 --> 00:29:48,752
Grams... um...

535
00:29:49,487 --> 00:29:53,490
I just want to know.
I'm worried.

536
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:56,126
Uncle Boyet is in...

537
00:29:57,694 --> 00:29:59,897
MuÃ±oz, Buenavista.

538
00:30:00,964 --> 00:30:01,833
But Grams,

539
00:30:02,166 --> 00:30:03,233
let's keep this between us.

540
00:30:03,367 --> 00:30:05,603
Don't tell Uncle Randy
or anyone else.

541
00:30:05,737 --> 00:30:06,971
Of course!

542
00:30:07,571 --> 00:30:11,476
I just wanna know
how Boyet is doing.

543
00:30:12,743 --> 00:30:14,778
I didn't ask,

544
00:30:15,547 --> 00:30:18,516
didn't want him to think
I had an agenda.

545
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:23,020
And our conversation kept
escalating,

546
00:30:23,421 --> 00:30:25,490
he even brought up Mom's past.

547
00:30:26,156 --> 00:30:27,525
He's thinking of...

548
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:30,060
his family, too.

549
00:30:30,728 --> 00:30:32,596
We're both tiptoeing
around each other.

550
00:30:33,631 --> 00:30:36,366
We don't lie to each other,

551
00:30:37,801 --> 00:30:41,306
but we also can't share
how we honestly feel.

552
00:30:42,207 --> 00:30:43,173
Grams...

553
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:46,376
Do you think it's only a matter
of time before we break up?

554
00:30:48,212 --> 00:30:50,480
I don't know
what advice to give you, hon.

555
00:30:51,615 --> 00:30:53,750
Your situation isn't easy.

556
00:30:54,885 --> 00:30:58,155
Do you think
your relationship can survive

557
00:30:58,288 --> 00:30:59,624
against all these odds?

558
00:31:04,729 --> 00:31:05,563
[Dale grunts]

559
00:31:05,696 --> 00:31:06,730
[physical therapist]
One step at a time.

560
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:07,664
[Dale grunts]

561
00:31:07,798 --> 00:31:08,766
[physical therapist]
Do it slowly, sir.

562
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:09,601
[Dale] I can do it.

563
00:31:09,733 --> 00:31:10,768
[physical therapist] Slowly...

564
00:31:11,336 --> 00:31:12,069
[physical therapist]
Don't rush yourself.

565
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:14,071
One step at a time.
No need to hurry, sir.

566
00:31:14,204 --> 00:31:14,771
[Dale] I can do it.

567
00:31:15,539 --> 00:31:17,040
You can rest if you get tired.

568
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:18,942
[Dale grunts]

569
00:31:19,076 --> 00:31:20,077
Slowly, sir.

570
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:21,045
[Dale grunts] Ah!

571
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:21,813
[Michiko, Nurse M] Dale!

572
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,082
Want to stop, sir?

573
00:31:24,214 --> 00:31:24,715
I can do it.

574
00:31:25,115 --> 00:31:25,549
[Michiko] Dale!

575
00:31:25,682 --> 00:31:26,718
I can do it. Again.

576
00:31:26,851 --> 00:31:27,652
Sir Dale, are you okay?

577
00:31:27,986 --> 00:31:28,685
I'm okay!

578
00:31:29,186 --> 00:31:29,953
I'm okay!

579
00:31:30,721 --> 00:31:32,257
Dale, you can rest!

580
00:31:32,624 --> 00:31:34,224
Mich, I said I'm okay!

581
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,095
Sorry,

582
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:39,163
I'm just worried.

583
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:41,465
Sorry...

584
00:31:41,598 --> 00:31:43,034
[sweet music playing]

585
00:31:43,166 --> 00:31:44,134
I'm just frustrated.

586
00:31:45,435 --> 00:31:46,471
I'm alright.

587
00:31:47,204 --> 00:31:48,472
Don't pity me, okay?

588
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:51,976
It'll just make me feel worse
than I already do.

589
00:31:53,111 --> 00:31:54,979
I don't pity you, Dale.

590
00:31:55,646 --> 00:31:57,015
I just want to support you.

591
00:31:58,915 --> 00:31:59,683
Thank you.

592
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:01,719
I know that

593
00:32:02,619 --> 00:32:04,888
I'll keep falling,

594
00:32:05,289 --> 00:32:06,691
but I'm willing to keep trying

595
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:09,861
because I really want
to walk again.

596
00:32:11,695 --> 00:32:13,998
I don't wanna be a burden
to my family.

597
00:32:14,999 --> 00:32:15,767
To you.

598
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:19,170
You're not a burden, okay?

599
00:32:19,636 --> 00:32:22,973
Didn't we promise we'd heal...

600
00:32:24,208 --> 00:32:25,843
and stand up together?

601
00:32:26,576 --> 00:32:28,211
I'll never leave you behind,
Tutor.

602
00:32:33,684 --> 00:32:34,652
Let's go again.

603
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:35,553
[physical therapist] Ready, sir?

604
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:37,788
Go, Dale! You can do it!

605
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:39,958
- Go, Sir Dale!
- Go, Dale Enrile!

606
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:42,859
- Go, Sir Dale!
- Go, go, go, Dale!

[competitive music playing]

608

[whistle blowing]

609
00:32:46,564 --> 00:32:48,766
[officiator] First part of the
tryouts is shooting skills--

610
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,169
same points system
as the field points.

611
00:32:51,669 --> 00:32:53,003
Then, we will have a game,

612
00:32:53,136 --> 00:32:58,142
three-on-three
to assess your team play.

613
00:32:59,009 --> 00:33:03,681
Then last part is a one-on-one
to assess how you play defense.

614
00:33:04,281 --> 00:33:06,584
We will be assessing
your overall performance

615
00:33:06,718 --> 00:33:09,019
as well as your team
performance.

616
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:12,222
In the end, we will
select just three players

617
00:33:12,356 --> 00:33:14,692
to be our rookies for next year.

618
00:33:15,692 --> 00:33:16,894
So, three.

619
00:33:18,796 --> 00:33:20,731
Three spots
and you still won't get picked.

620
00:33:21,365 --> 00:33:22,232
Keep dreaming.

621
00:33:22,599 --> 00:33:23,367
[officiator] Okay?

622
00:33:23,734 --> 00:33:24,769

I'm here. Can you take me on?

Shut up and just play.

You got this, bro.

Thank you, sir!

719
00:39:33,336 --> 00:39:35,239
-[Randy] Woohoo!
-[Bhaves] Yes!

720
00:39:38,842 --> 00:39:40,411
Wait, where are we going?

721
00:39:41,911 --> 00:39:44,949
[melancholic music playing]

722
00:40:29,994 --> 00:40:30,760
Are you okay?

723
00:40:30,894 --> 00:40:31,695
Yes, mom.

724
00:40:31,829 --> 00:40:33,630
[Randy] You enjoyed it, huh?

725
00:40:34,431 --> 00:40:35,199
Grams.

726
00:40:36,032 --> 00:40:37,201
[Bhaves] I'll just talk to them.

727
00:40:37,333 --> 00:40:38,001
Grams...

728
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:40,103
- My name is Bhaves.
- Grams, let's go.

729
00:40:40,237 --> 00:40:43,740
I'm Max's grandma
and Boyet's mom...

730
00:40:43,873 --> 00:40:44,742
[Max, Randy] Sorry about this.

731
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:51,014
Please believe me, my son
is really innocent.

732
00:40:51,148 --> 00:40:52,817
Please.

733
00:40:52,949 --> 00:40:54,018
- Grams, don't do this.
- [Evita] Max!

734
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:55,286
We're sorry about this.

735
00:40:55,418 --> 00:40:56,686
Please can we not do this?

736
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:58,322
Excuse me!

737
00:40:58,688 --> 00:41:02,059
Tell your client
to stay away from my family.

738
00:41:02,193 --> 00:41:04,994
We're not getting swayed
by your pity party.

739
00:41:05,128 --> 00:41:07,797
Bhaves is sincere
and Boyet is innocent.

740
00:41:07,931 --> 00:41:10,733
If he's innocent, why is he
hiding?

741
00:41:10,867 --> 00:41:11,936
Where is he?

742
00:41:12,068 --> 00:41:13,137
[Daniel] See what I mean?

743
00:41:14,371 --> 00:41:17,173
You could have fooled Deib

744
00:41:17,307 --> 00:41:18,976
because of this pretend
kindness,

745
00:41:19,108 --> 00:41:22,679
but we're too smart for that.

746
00:41:23,414 --> 00:41:24,949
Sir, we're not trying to fool
you.

747
00:41:25,081 --> 00:41:26,916
We're not pretending--

748
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:28,985
Stop seducing my son.

749
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:30,221
[Evita] Daniel, that's enough!

750
00:41:30,353 --> 00:41:31,554
[Zell] Deib is the one
seducing Max!

751
00:41:31,688 --> 00:41:33,123
I used to think
you were good for my son,

752
00:41:33,257 --> 00:41:34,257
that you set him straight.

753
00:41:34,391 --> 00:41:38,362
But you were just playing him,
manipulating him.

754
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:39,630
That's what you were doing, Max!

755
00:41:39,762 --> 00:41:40,563
Daniel, please.

756
00:41:40,697 --> 00:41:42,967
Sir, I know you're saying these
things

757
00:41:43,099 --> 00:41:44,467
because you're hurt.

758
00:41:44,601 --> 00:41:48,438
So now you're the understanding
and forgiving one?!

759
00:41:48,572 --> 00:41:51,141
You got some nerve, young lady!

760
00:41:51,275 --> 00:41:52,909
[Daniel] You should be asking
for our forgiveness!

761
00:41:53,043 --> 00:41:54,545
Dad, stop. Let's just go.

762
00:41:54,677 --> 00:41:55,579
- [Evita] Let's go!
- [Daniel] Why should we leave?!

763
00:41:55,713 --> 00:41:57,648
[Daniel] They should be ashamed,
not us!

764
00:41:57,780 --> 00:41:58,916
[Deib] Dad, what's this?

765
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:01,585
[Evita] Just... uh...

766
00:42:04,755 --> 00:42:05,588
You okay, Max?

767
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:07,925
I'm okay. Let's go--

768
00:42:08,057 --> 00:42:08,826
-[Max] We're sorry.
-[RJ] You sure?

769
00:42:08,958 --> 00:42:10,793
RJ, I'm fine. Let's just go.

770
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:12,862
You're not okay, Max.

771
00:42:13,163 --> 00:42:14,164
She said she's okay!

772
00:42:14,731 --> 00:42:15,231
[Max] Deib.

773
00:42:15,365 --> 00:42:16,367
Why do you keep asking?

774
00:42:16,766 --> 00:42:17,333
Deib.

775
00:42:17,668 --> 00:42:18,335
Don't.

776
00:42:18,969 --> 00:42:19,836
You can't win it all!

777
00:42:19,969 --> 00:42:21,905
Stop acting like she's still
your girlfriend!

778
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:23,139
She's my girlfriend now!

779
00:42:23,606 --> 00:42:26,443
Deib, we talked about this!

780
00:42:26,577 --> 00:42:28,177
[Daniel] So what is this?!

781
00:42:28,746 --> 00:42:29,980
Don't tell me that this girl
is more important

782
00:42:30,114 --> 00:42:31,248
than your family!

783
00:42:31,581 --> 00:42:35,652
Deib, you told us that you broke
up--

784
00:42:35,786 --> 00:42:38,088
- Sorry, Mom. I'm sorry.
- [phone ringing]

785
00:42:38,856 --> 00:42:39,222
Yes?

786
00:42:39,356 --> 00:42:40,858
You promised.

787
00:42:40,990 --> 00:42:41,724
What?!

788
00:42:42,458 --> 00:42:43,693
[Daniel] Son of a--

789
00:42:44,193 --> 00:42:44,961
Yes,

790
00:42:46,195 --> 00:42:47,097
I'll call you tonight.

791
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:50,800
What is it? What's wrong?

792
00:42:51,501 --> 00:42:53,536
Boyet got away again!

793
00:42:53,903 --> 00:42:54,471
[Evita] My God!

794
00:42:54,605 --> 00:42:55,773
[Daniel] What, Deib?

795
00:42:56,273 --> 00:42:57,675
[Daniel] What did you tell
them?!

796
00:42:59,208 --> 00:43:01,144
Answer me! What did you tell
her?

797
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:07,318
Sir, Deib didn't mean to tell
me.

798
00:43:07,952 --> 00:43:10,186
And I only told Grandma Bhaves.

799
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:11,789
I thought telling her was
harmless

800
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:14,925
because we're not in contact
with Uncle Boyet anyway.

801
00:43:15,059 --> 00:43:16,226
I'm sorry, sir.

802
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,862
You see, Evita?
What did I tell you?

803
00:43:19,362 --> 00:43:23,967
We talked about this, but you
just can't get in your head

804
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:26,202
how important this is for our
family!

805
00:43:26,336 --> 00:43:29,739
For your brother, for his future
that was stolen from him!

806
00:43:29,873 --> 00:43:32,409
[Evita] Okay. Okay. Just stop!

807
00:43:32,543 --> 00:43:33,277
Dad, I know--

808
00:43:33,409 --> 00:43:35,411
No, you don't!

809
00:43:35,545 --> 00:43:39,650
You had a choice and again
you chose to betray us!

810
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:42,152
You know what?
Let's end this once and for all.

811
00:43:42,518 --> 00:43:46,056
Choose -- your own family,
your own blood,

812
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:49,025
or your girlfriend and her
family of criminals?!

813
00:43:49,659 --> 00:43:51,161
Mr. Enrile, that's enough!

814
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:52,596
[dramatic music playing]

815
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:54,130
Calm down. Please, just...

816
00:44:15,753 --> 00:44:18,789
[dramatic music continues]

817
00:44:41,878 --> 00:44:42,746
[Dale] Let's have an adventure.

818
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,380
I wanna live with no regret

819
00:44:44,514 --> 00:44:46,650
and do things that make me
happy.

820
00:44:46,784 --> 00:44:48,485
Your mom told me
that she and your dad--

821
00:44:48,619 --> 00:44:50,753
Stop flirting with my mom!

822
00:44:50,887 --> 00:44:51,454
What?!

823
00:44:51,889 --> 00:44:54,257
I'm really trying, but it's just
not me.

824
00:44:54,391 --> 00:44:55,925
Or you just don't love me.

825
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:58,394
The suspect escaped a couple of
times.

826
00:44:58,528 --> 00:44:59,596
[policeman] We couldn't catch
him

827
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:01,798
because his mom
alerted him about us.

828
00:45:01,931 --> 00:45:04,068
Deib, you know what to do.

829
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:06,503
I just don't know if I can still
trust you.

830
00:45:06,637 --> 00:45:08,605
I love you even if you don't
trust me.

831
00:45:08,972 --> 00:45:10,606
[Max] Even if you don't love me.
