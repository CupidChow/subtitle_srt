00:00:02,168 --> 00:00:04,136
I don't wanna listen to your
excuses!

2
00:00:04,269 --> 00:00:05,972
Stop fighting and listen to me!

3
00:00:06,105 --> 00:00:06,972
[Lee] I asked Ysay to help me

4
00:00:07,107 --> 00:00:08,407
write you a song for our
monthsary.

5
00:00:08,541 --> 00:00:10,210
It was supposed to be a
surprise!

6
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:11,410
[Michiko] Is there
something wrong with me?

7
00:00:11,544 --> 00:00:13,612
Am I not enough?

8
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,749
Why did he leave me?

9
00:00:15,881 --> 00:00:17,350
This also happened to Dale
before.

10
00:00:17,484 --> 00:00:18,684
He got ghosted by his
girlfriend.

11
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:20,420
Were you close?

12
00:00:20,553 --> 00:00:22,155
I had a crush on him.
Before Tob.

13
00:00:22,756 --> 00:00:26,059
Bro, we're not giving up on you.
We'll find who shot you.

14
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:27,559
You have to leave it
with our attorneys.

15
00:00:27,693 --> 00:00:31,931
Let them find Agila and the
CCTV.

16
00:00:32,064 --> 00:00:33,533
[Deib] And Christopher Santos.

17
00:00:33,665 --> 00:00:36,402
[Boyet] I don't know what to do
to pay my debt with Boss.

18
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:38,871
[Tiago] Only one solution
to that: carnap again.

19
00:00:39,005 --> 00:00:39,773
[Boyet] I'll do it.

20
00:00:39,905 --> 00:00:42,042
Just leave my niece out of this.

Sir!

27
00:01:02,027 --> 00:01:02,695
Hello!

28
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:04,998
Why are you here?

29
00:01:05,131 --> 00:01:06,198
Uh...

30
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,435
I wanna give you this.

31
00:01:09,868 --> 00:01:13,439
For good fortune and inner
peace.

33
00:01:15,775 --> 00:01:16,709
-Sir!
-Thank you.

34
00:01:17,609 --> 00:01:18,043
Please.

35
00:01:18,177 --> 00:01:19,144
Thanks.

36
00:01:20,947 --> 00:01:27,186
Also, sir, Max and I plan to go
on a date tomorrow night

37
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:32,025
for our first month celebration
together.

00:01:34,394 --> 00:01:34,993
Uhm...

40
00:01:35,561 --> 00:01:38,298
I wanna ask for your
permission if it's okay.

41
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:45,605
Okay, Deib.

42
00:01:46,772 --> 00:01:47,739
Thanks for telling me.

43
00:01:52,945 --> 00:01:54,246
Sir...

44
00:01:54,713 --> 00:01:55,347
Sir,

45
00:01:56,683 --> 00:01:58,885
I know I haven't apologized
for everything

46
00:01:59,018 --> 00:02:00,787
I did in the past,

47
00:02:01,353 --> 00:02:04,524
so I want to say sorry again.

48
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:07,960
Sorry for all the hurt

49
00:02:08,093 --> 00:02:11,463
that I've caused you,
your family,

50
00:02:12,031 --> 00:02:12,866
Max...

51
00:02:14,834 --> 00:02:16,635
I'm really sorry, sir.

52
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:23,776
I heard what Max said
during your trial.

53
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:28,647
Maybe I've not seen you
change personally,

54
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:32,284
but I trust my daughter.

55
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:34,854
Prove her right.

56
00:02:35,754 --> 00:02:36,756
Don't break that trust.

57
00:02:41,794 --> 00:02:42,729
Yes, sir.

58
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:46,132
Thank you.

["He's Into Her" by BGYO

First of all, to our host
this afternoon, Kurt!

62
00:03:56,235 --> 00:03:57,569
[Deib] Bro, thank you so much!

63
00:03:58,437 --> 00:03:59,938
Guys, I don't deserve it...

64
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:02,508
but thanks for the friendship.

65
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:03,643
Thank you, too.

66
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:08,448
You could've sued us
for what we did,

67
00:04:09,181 --> 00:04:12,352
but surprisingly, you forgave
us.

68
00:04:13,051 --> 00:04:13,853
So...

69
00:04:14,219 --> 00:04:15,020
To friendship!

70
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:15,921

to the most important friendship
in my life right now...

75
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:31,838
the friendship I have with you,
Max.

76
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:34,706
More than friends.

77
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:36,975
Thank you so much!

78
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,177
If it wasn't for you,

I wouldn't have

80
00:04:40,579 --> 00:04:41,947
all these friends I have right
now.

81
00:04:44,149 --> 00:04:45,485
You made me the man I am today.

00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,168
But not everyone here
is in love with me.

182
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:08,173
So today the song I wrote for
you

183
00:10:08,707 --> 00:10:10,942
will be sung by someone
who is objectively,

184
00:10:11,076 --> 00:10:13,278
and everyone
will agree with me on this,

185
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:14,947
a good singer.

186
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,215
Ysay?

187
00:10:16,881 --> 00:10:21,553
[applause and cheers]

188
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:22,989
[Migz] Go Ysay!

189
00:10:23,121 --> 00:10:23,688
[Deib] I thought it was you
Lorde!

190
00:10:23,822 --> 00:10:25,024
[Lorde] No, master!

191
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:27,860
[boys cheering]
Ysay! Ysay!

192
00:10:30,428 --> 00:10:31,663
[Naih] Thank you, Mine!

193
00:10:34,332 --> 00:10:35,768
Happy monthsary, Naih and Lee!

194
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,836
Happy monthsary, Max and Deib!

195
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,337
[giggles]

196
00:10:39,471 --> 00:10:41,206
Ever since, it's been my dream

197
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,142
to have you write a song for me!

198
00:10:43,842 --> 00:10:47,379
Thank you, Mine, for making
my dreams come true!

199
00:10:47,846 --> 00:10:49,148
You're welcome, Yours.

200
00:10:51,082 --> 00:10:54,552
But next time, even if
you sound like a toad,

201
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:56,288
I still want you to sing for me

202
00:10:56,422 --> 00:10:57,756
in front of the whole world!

203
00:10:57,889 --> 00:10:59,924
No way, I'm not gonna do that!

204
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:14,874
â™ª Funny how love comes
When you least expect it â™ª

205
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:27,019
â™ª And when you meet,
You're suddenly complete â™ª

206
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:32,390
â™ª Can we just stay here? â™ª

207
00:11:32,524 --> 00:11:41,600
â™ª I can't go too long
Without your embrace â™ª

208
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:44,470
â™ª I won't ask for anything else
â™ª

209
00:11:44,602 --> 00:11:45,303
â™ª Let's just stay here together
â™ª

210
00:11:45,437 --> 00:11:47,673
Wanna dance? Let's do it.

211
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:57,783
â™ª I can't be without you â™ª

212
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,153
â™ª You â™ª

213
00:12:03,254 --> 00:12:04,289
â™ª You â™ª

214
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:07,793
â™ª You â™ª

215
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:12,130
Let's dance?

216
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,366
Wait!

217
00:12:16,634 --> 00:12:17,836
Where's Michiko?

218
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,240
[receptionist] Hi!

219
00:12:22,674 --> 00:12:23,341
Name please?

220
00:12:23,475 --> 00:12:25,477
Yanai. Tob Yanai.

221
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:27,346
This way.

222
00:12:30,182 --> 00:12:31,450
â™ª You â™ª

223
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:34,820
â™ª You â™ª

224
00:12:36,154 --> 00:12:37,188
â™ª You â™ª

225
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:40,826
â™ª You â™ª

226
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:45,563
â™ª I can't remember the past
already â™ª

227
00:12:45,697 --> 00:12:46,764
[phone chimes]

228
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:52,138
[Migz] Girl, where are you?

229
00:12:53,938 --> 00:12:56,808
[Michiko] A place where
I can find some answers.

230
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:04,616
[Deib] Slowly...
Just keep walking...

231
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,217
[Max giggles]

232
00:13:06,351 --> 00:13:09,020
Three, two, one...

233
00:13:10,355 --> 00:13:11,322
Surprise Babybabe!

234
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:14,426
â™ª Can we just stay here? â™ª

235
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:17,462
â™ª I can't go too long
Without your embrace â™ª

236
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:18,596
- So?
- Wow!

237
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:20,331
â™ª I can't go too long
Without your embrace â™ª

238
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:23,701
-Is this for real?
-Yeah! I worked so hard on this.

239
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:26,205
â™ª I won't ask for anything else
â™ª

240
00:13:26,337 --> 00:13:27,740
Thank you!

241
00:13:27,873 --> 00:13:29,774
[Deib] Look at the heart!

242
00:13:29,908 --> 00:13:36,682
â™ª I can't be without you â™ª

243
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:40,686
â™ª You have such beautiful eyes â™ª

244
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,688
â™ª Every look got me mesmerized â™ª

245
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:47,826
â™ª My heart is yours now â™ª

246
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,895
â™ª But I have no fear somehow â™ª

247
00:13:51,029 --> 00:13:53,798
â™ª I say hello and ask for your
name â™ª

248
00:13:53,932 --> 00:13:56,902
â™ª We'll go to paradise
And we'll never be the same â™ª

249
00:13:57,035 --> 00:13:59,672
â™ª Let's see the world together â™ª

250
00:13:59,804 --> 00:14:02,640
â™ª Will you say yes now
So we can start forever? â™ª

251
00:14:02,774 --> 00:14:05,577
â™ª Can we just stay here? â™ª

â™ª I can't be without you â™ª

256
00:14:26,631 --> 00:14:27,265
Let's go.

257
00:14:30,068 --> 00:14:32,870
â™ª You â™ª

258
00:14:33,004 --> 00:14:38,376
â™ª Let's just stay here â™ª

259
00:14:38,509 --> 00:14:41,679
â™ª Let's just stay here together
â™ª

260
00:14:41,813 --> 00:14:46,251
â™ª I can't be without you â™ª

261
00:14:46,384 --> 00:14:48,120
[waiter] Ma'am, this is
part of the package

262
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:49,554
that Mr. Yanai ordered.

263
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:53,359
When did he make this
reservation?

264
00:14:53,491 --> 00:14:56,195
[waiter] Last month.
Do you know where he is?

265
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:01,634
Thank you.

266
00:15:02,701 --> 00:15:03,601
[waiter] Thank you ma'am.

267
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:07,438
â™ª You â™ª

272
00:15:24,722 --> 00:15:27,558
[gentle music continues]

273
00:15:32,697 --> 00:15:35,768
[waiter] Ma'am,
should we serve the food?

274
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,669
Or should we wait for Mr. Yanai?

275
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:44,809
Let's wait.
He's coming.

276
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:46,245
[waiter] Okay, ma'am.

277
00:15:57,556 --> 00:15:58,323

-Ah!

279
00:16:06,664 --> 00:16:07,599
Aww.

280
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,636
Thanks for the surprise.

281
00:16:12,904 --> 00:16:15,173
Best first monthsary ever!

282
00:16:16,107 --> 00:16:18,376
I love you so much.
Happy monthsary.

283
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:21,046
Happy monthsary.

284
00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:23,349
I love you, MOO.

[both laughing]

286
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:39,731
[waiter] Sorry, ma'am.
We're about to close

287
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:41,432
so we have to serve the food.

288
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:46,337
There's supposed to be
a ring in this cake.

289
00:16:47,105 --> 00:16:49,707
Should we wrap the food
to go, ma'am?

290
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:56,514
I'll leave you to it, ma'am.

291
00:17:01,052 --> 00:17:02,086
[Tob] Ms. Barbie,

292
00:17:03,054 --> 00:17:04,390
do you have some dessert?

293
00:17:05,356 --> 00:17:07,659
I'm craving red velvet macaron.

294
00:17:07,792 --> 00:17:09,528
[Barb] We don't have any.

295
00:17:09,827 --> 00:17:11,396
That's too bad.

296
00:17:11,963 --> 00:17:13,365
I'd love something sweet.

297
00:17:14,532 --> 00:17:16,501
[Michiko] I've been trying
to learn some pastry.

298
00:17:16,634 --> 00:17:17,836
Try it!

299
00:17:18,836 --> 00:17:20,239
[Tob] My favorite!

300
00:17:20,972 --> 00:17:22,007
It's my first time making it,

301
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:23,575
so I'm not sure if it tastes
good.

302
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,376
It's red velvet.

303
00:17:26,711 --> 00:17:27,546
Do you like it?

304
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:30,315
I like you.

305
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:32,183
[Tob] Want me to walk around
with you

306
00:17:32,317 --> 00:17:33,484
wherever you go?

307
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:35,921
If it's not a hassle.

308
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,256
Of course not.

309
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:39,724
Michiko.

310
00:17:40,025 --> 00:17:41,794
I'll drive you home.

311
00:17:42,326 --> 00:17:46,464
You sure?
My house is out of the way.

312
00:17:47,165 --> 00:17:48,333
Don't worry about it.

313
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:52,805
[sad music swells]

314
00:18:07,719 --> 00:18:08,820
I love you.

315
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:12,624
I love you.

316
00:18:38,549 --> 00:18:41,487
[sobbing]

317
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:03,674
Okay, close your eyes.

318
00:19:04,675 --> 00:19:05,309
Close your eyes.

319
00:19:05,443 --> 00:19:07,112
Another surprise?

320
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:09,080
My monthsary gift!

321
00:19:09,213 --> 00:19:10,615
-Close your eyes, come on!
-Okay.

322
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:17,623
Open.

323
00:19:21,792 --> 00:19:22,827
Hey!

324
00:19:22,961 --> 00:19:25,029
-We're too young for this...
-It's not like that.

325
00:19:25,163 --> 00:19:25,797
...I'm not ready!

326
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:27,298
Listen. Listen, first.

327
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:30,469
I asked your dad
if we can start dating.

328
00:19:31,636 --> 00:19:33,538
We're not gonna get married yet.

329
00:19:33,971 --> 00:19:35,406
This is just a promise ring.

330
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:37,342
[Max sighs]

331
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:39,010
You had me there!

332
00:19:39,611 --> 00:19:40,378
Max,

333
00:19:42,814 --> 00:19:43,648
like I said,

334
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:45,917
this is a promise ring.

335
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:51,522
I promise to always take care of
you

336
00:19:52,657 --> 00:19:54,393
even if you don't need me to,

337
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,461
I'll always protect you

338
00:19:58,529 --> 00:20:00,499
even if you can do all that.

339
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:02,634
I know you're strong.

340
00:20:02,768 --> 00:20:04,569
[Deib chuckles]

341
00:20:05,703 --> 00:20:06,805
I promise

342
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:09,508
to always be your best friend

343
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:12,810
through good times and bad
times.

344
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,279
I promise to be...

345
00:20:15,814 --> 00:20:18,016
to try to be a better person
everyday

346
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,286
so I can give you
the best verions of me

347
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,988
because you deserve the best.

348
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:29,827
[sweet music playing]

349
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,936
By wearing this ring...

350
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,941
Deib Lohr Enrile,

351
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:47,578
I promise

352
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:51,717
to do the same for you.

353
00:20:58,222 --> 00:20:59,324
Wait, I got a gift for you, too.

354
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:00,726
Close your eyes!

355
00:21:00,858 --> 00:21:01,926
Is this for real?

356
00:21:02,059 --> 00:21:06,265
It's not as grand as yours,
but it's from my heart.

357
00:21:06,397 --> 00:21:09,734
Max, whatever it is, I'll love
it.

358
00:21:10,067 --> 00:21:10,868

544
00:33:30,741 --> 00:33:31,976
Get well soon.

545
00:33:32,109 --> 00:33:34,878
Deib's excited to play
basketball with you!

546
00:33:35,011 --> 00:33:37,481
[Evita, Max laugh]

547
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:38,682
Michiko,

548
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:40,284
why are you here?

549
00:33:40,417 --> 00:33:42,787
Michiko was here
when Dale woke up.

550
00:33:43,988 --> 00:33:44,788
So...

551
00:33:45,123 --> 00:33:47,491
You came here
when you left the party?

552
00:33:47,625 --> 00:33:48,358
No!

553
00:33:48,792 --> 00:33:50,894
Um, I just suddenly thought of
Dale.

554
00:33:51,028 --> 00:33:52,829
So, I visited him.

555
00:33:53,263 --> 00:33:55,031
Think I woke him up with my
chatter.

556
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:58,135
Whatever you did, thank you!

557
00:33:58,269 --> 00:34:00,538
- Thank you!
- [Evita] Yes, thank you!

558
00:34:00,671 --> 00:34:02,006
Rest well, Dale.

559
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,441
Tomorrow,
we'll be running more tests

560
00:34:03,574 --> 00:34:05,710
to make sure that everything's
okay.

561
00:34:06,277 --> 00:34:08,211
You might be wondering
why you can't move yet.

562
00:34:08,346 --> 00:34:09,780
That's not unusual.

563
00:34:10,414 --> 00:34:12,849
It's likely that you have
muscle atrophy.

564
00:34:13,251 --> 00:34:14,184
Wait! So,

565
00:34:14,684 --> 00:34:16,954
Doc, does this mean
Dale can walk again?

566
00:34:17,088 --> 00:34:17,822
Yes.

567
00:34:17,954 --> 00:34:19,190
Hopefully soon.

568
00:34:19,322 --> 00:34:20,557
[doctor] If his speech
doesn't come back soon,

569
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:21,893
that's normal, too.

570
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,894
He was intubated for a long
time.

571
00:34:24,027 --> 00:34:26,063
Yes. I have this patient,

572
00:34:26,197 --> 00:34:28,298
he was rushed here
about a month ago.

573
00:34:28,432 --> 00:34:29,900
Remember Daniel,
I told you about this?

574
00:34:30,034 --> 00:34:30,802
Yeah.

575
00:34:30,934 --> 00:34:32,369
He just started speaking now.

576
00:34:32,503 --> 00:34:35,472
The nurses said the only thing
he can say is "cellphone."

577
00:34:35,606 --> 00:34:41,378
He doesn't know his own name.

578
00:34:41,512 --> 00:34:42,947
Probably has memory loss.

579
00:34:43,313 --> 00:34:44,715
That's the other thing.

580
00:34:45,282 --> 00:34:47,318
Dale might have
some memory loss, too.

581
00:34:47,452 --> 00:34:49,186
But he seems to know who he is

582
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,221
and who you guys are.

583
00:34:50,353 --> 00:34:51,021
Right, Dale?

584
00:34:51,155 --> 00:34:51,922
[all laugh]

585
00:34:52,056 --> 00:34:53,090
[Deib] Bro, you know me, right?

586
00:34:53,224 --> 00:34:55,226
[laughter]

587
00:34:57,695 --> 00:34:58,963
Son, if you...

588
00:34:59,429 --> 00:35:02,233
remember anything
about the night...

589
00:35:02,365 --> 00:35:03,668
- you got hurt...
- [Evita] Daniel...

590
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:08,139
What about you, Deib?

591
00:35:08,539 --> 00:35:09,840
[Daniel]
Remember something now?

592
00:35:11,641 --> 00:35:13,643
Sorry, Dad...

593
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:16,380
Daniel, Deib has told us
and the police...

594
00:35:16,514 --> 00:35:18,983
everything he remembers
about that night, okay?

595
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:20,650
Yes!

596
00:35:20,784 --> 00:35:21,786
You're right.

597
00:35:21,918 --> 00:35:26,456
Just focus on getting
stronger and healing well.

598
00:35:26,824 --> 00:35:30,061
I promise you:
the scum who hurt you

599
00:35:30,193 --> 00:35:31,762
is gonna get caught and
punished.

600
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:38,402
[monitor beeping]

601
00:35:43,306 --> 00:35:45,208
[Tiago] You coming?

602
00:35:46,143 --> 00:35:48,746
[Tiago]
What's taking you so long?

603
00:35:49,447 --> 00:35:51,581
[Tiago] You shouldn't have
used that car!

604
00:35:52,315 --> 00:35:53,117
[Tiago] Just hurry!

605
00:35:53,784 --> 00:35:55,219
[Tiago] Boyet can do this, bro!

606
00:35:55,786 --> 00:35:56,721
[Tiago]
He won't chicken out this time!

607
00:35:57,889 --> 00:35:58,588
[Tiago] Hurry!

608
00:35:59,222 --> 00:35:59,891
[Tiago] Okay.

609
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,329
[Tiago] All good?

610
00:36:08,231 --> 00:36:09,000
Ah...

611
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,635
Bro,

612
00:36:12,769 --> 00:36:13,838
I gotta pee.

613
00:36:15,606 --> 00:36:17,942
Why now?! Do it later!

614
00:36:18,074 --> 00:36:20,344
[car engine zooming]

615
00:36:20,478 --> 00:36:21,978
I'm about to pee my pants!

616
00:36:24,382 --> 00:36:25,715
Just hurry!

617
00:36:26,083 --> 00:36:26,851
Okay.

618
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:29,253
[Tiago] Hello, boss.

619
00:36:29,387 --> 00:36:31,021
I'm here with Boyet.

620
00:36:32,123 --> 00:36:37,394
[Tiago murmuring]

621
00:36:37,527 --> 00:36:38,929
I got a gun, Boss.

622
00:36:39,063 --> 00:36:41,731
I'll shoot him if he backs out.

623
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:56,780
Big bro,

624
00:36:57,148 --> 00:36:59,684
instead of stalking Max

625
00:36:59,817 --> 00:37:01,518
and just looking at those
photos,

626
00:37:02,253 --> 00:37:03,887
just court her again.

627
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:08,858
She's got a boyfriend now!

628
00:37:09,726 --> 00:37:11,494
They'll break up eventually!

629
00:37:12,028 --> 00:37:13,097
How are you so sure?

630
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:16,400
Because I'm the first
and number 1 fan

631
00:37:16,534 --> 00:37:18,034
of the RJ-Max ship!

632
00:37:19,402 --> 00:37:20,438
Big bro,

633
00:37:21,304 --> 00:37:23,907
if you believe Max
is your true love,

634
00:37:25,041 --> 00:37:26,309
fight for her!

635
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:30,481
Zell...

636
00:37:32,682 --> 00:37:34,719
I can't be the only one
fighting.

637
00:37:34,851 --> 00:37:35,952
[door opens]

638
00:37:39,222 --> 00:37:39,923
[RJ] Oh!

639
00:37:40,291 --> 00:37:41,025
Hey!

640
00:37:41,157 --> 00:37:41,958
[RJ] Uncle Boyet?!

641
00:37:42,092 --> 00:37:43,027
You okay?

642
00:37:43,561 --> 00:37:44,661
-[suspenseful music playing]
-Yes!

643
00:37:44,795 --> 00:37:45,963
You're still up!

644
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:47,998
Excuse me, gotta pee.

645
00:37:57,074 --> 00:37:58,476
[Lorde] Hello,
fellow beautiful people!

646
00:37:58,608 --> 00:38:00,978
I, the Lorde, be with you
for a special update.

647
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:03,514
Benison High's sleeping
handsome is awake!

648
00:38:03,648 --> 00:38:05,382
All hail, King Dale!

649
00:38:05,516 --> 00:38:07,318
[Migz] Wow! Really?

650
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:09,987
Good news and good vibes
to start the day!

651
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:11,621
[Ysay] Is that confirmed, Lorde?

652
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:13,291
[Deib] Confirmed, Ysay!

653
00:38:13,423 --> 00:38:15,726
[Deib] Big bro's back, guys!
Awesome!

654
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,460
[Elle] My gosh, Deib!

655
00:38:17,594 --> 00:38:19,230
So happy for you
and your family!

656
00:38:19,664 --> 00:38:20,398
[Naih] Stop meeee!

657
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:22,300
I'm excited to see big bro Dale!

658
00:38:22,699 --> 00:38:23,701
[Lorde] You guys close?

659
00:38:23,833 --> 00:38:25,402
[Naih] He's like a brother
to my Mine,

660
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:27,338
so he's like a brother to me!

661
00:38:27,804 --> 00:38:29,373
[Lee] YESSSS!!!
Happy for you, bro!

662
00:38:29,507 --> 00:38:30,775
When can we visit big bro Dale?

663
00:38:31,641 --> 00:38:33,143
[Deib] I'll ask mom.

664
00:38:33,844 --> 00:38:35,378
[Naih]  Send us a photo!

665
00:38:36,112 --> 00:38:38,648
[Max] We were so excited,
we forgot to take a pic!

666
00:38:38,782 --> 00:38:40,951
Michiko posted a pic
on her IG though.

667
00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:42,887
[Max] Look at this guys!

668
00:38:43,387 --> 00:38:45,722
[Migz] Why's Michiko there?

669
00:38:45,856 --> 00:38:48,425
[Max] She's the one
who woke Dale up!

670
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:50,161
[Elle] OMG! For real?

671
00:38:50,293 --> 00:38:52,295
[Ysay] That's so romantic!

672
00:38:52,797 --> 00:38:54,764
[Migz] Miiiiichiiiiikooooo!!!

673
00:38:55,532 --> 00:38:56,567
[Lorde] What's the meaning of
this?!

674
00:38:56,701 --> 00:38:58,402
[Naih] Michiko! Answer us!

675
00:38:58,536 --> 00:39:00,871
[Naih] Hey! Where are you?!

676
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,141
[door opens]

677
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:08,945
Hi!

678
00:39:09,079 --> 00:39:09,947
Good morning!

679
00:39:11,548 --> 00:39:13,550
Am I your first visitor?

680
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:16,653
[monitor beeping]

681
00:39:16,786 --> 00:39:18,856
I was gonna bake you
a carrot cake,

682
00:39:18,989 --> 00:39:21,025
but I didn't have the
ingredients.

683
00:39:21,759 --> 00:39:23,159
Are you allowed to eat this?

684
00:39:27,164 --> 00:39:27,931
How are you?

685
00:39:28,465 --> 00:39:29,199
You okay?

686
00:39:36,106 --> 00:39:36,706
Huh?

687
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:37,907
Me?

688
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,043
What do you mean?

689
00:39:42,512 --> 00:39:44,547
Here,

690
00:39:44,681 --> 00:39:46,884
type what you wanna say.

691
00:39:56,059 --> 00:39:57,594
"You okay?"

692
00:39:57,927 --> 00:39:58,596
Me?

693
00:39:59,396 --> 00:40:00,130
Yes.

694
00:40:00,597 --> 00:40:01,766
I'm okay.

695
00:40:03,099 --> 00:40:04,735
I'm happy you're awake.

696
00:40:08,271 --> 00:40:09,139
"Worried."

697
00:40:09,507 --> 00:40:11,074
'You cried last night."

698
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:14,612
You heard everything I said?

699
00:40:15,478 --> 00:40:16,914
[Dale] Yes.

700
00:40:18,715 --> 00:40:19,750
[Michiko chuckles]

701
00:40:22,519 --> 00:40:23,653
Sorry...

702
00:40:24,554 --> 00:40:26,623
I didn't have anyone to talk to.

703
00:40:32,663 --> 00:40:34,697
[Dale] It's okay. Sorry.

704
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:36,634
Sorry?

705
00:40:37,434 --> 00:40:39,202
Why are you apologizing...

706
00:40:39,804 --> 00:40:42,706
when I was the one
who disturbed your sleep?

707
00:40:44,041 --> 00:40:46,076
[Dale] Sorry 'coz Tob
broke your heart.

708
00:40:52,048 --> 00:40:53,117
Thank you, Dale.

709
00:40:59,155 --> 00:41:01,858
[Dale] If Tob were here,
I'd punch him.

710
00:41:05,161 --> 00:41:06,831
Don't worry about him.

711
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:08,932
Just get well, Tutor!

712
00:41:15,338 --> 00:41:17,173
[Dale] Thanks for waking me up.

713
00:41:19,543 --> 00:41:20,777
Thank you, Dale,

714
00:41:21,344 --> 00:41:22,278
for coming back.

715
00:41:23,246 --> 00:41:24,215
- [door opens]
- No matter what happens,

716
00:41:24,347 --> 00:41:25,648
I'm here for you.

717
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:31,222
Sir Dale, time for a shower.

718
00:41:31,355 --> 00:41:31,989
Oh...

719
00:41:32,121 --> 00:41:33,990
Your Princess Charming is here!

720
00:41:34,391 --> 00:41:35,925
And she comes bearing cookies!

721
00:41:36,059 --> 00:41:37,728
You're well-taken care of, sir!

722
00:41:37,862 --> 00:41:39,230
You'll get well soon.

723
00:41:46,237 --> 00:41:46,871
Hey!

724
00:41:47,003 --> 00:41:48,438
Hi, Zell!
Where's Uncle Boyet?

725
00:41:48,572 --> 00:41:49,606
Restroom.

726
00:41:50,139 --> 00:41:51,108
Grandma?

727
00:41:51,242 --> 00:41:52,976
In the kitchen, she made
you some purple yam.

728
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:54,378
Okay.

729
00:41:54,811 --> 00:41:55,378
Hi, Grams!

730
00:41:55,512 --> 00:41:56,280
Hey!

731
00:41:56,413 --> 00:41:58,815
-Max!
-Bless me, Grandma.

732
00:41:58,949 --> 00:42:04,788
Come here!
RJ, get a spoon for Max.

733
00:42:04,922 --> 00:42:07,757
How's your mortuary with Deib?

734
00:42:07,891 --> 00:42:09,193
[laughs] Grams,

735
00:42:09,326 --> 00:42:12,429
It's "monthsary."
Mortuary is for the dead.

736
00:42:12,563 --> 00:42:14,532
Okay, monthsary.
So how was it?

737
00:42:14,664 --> 00:42:17,300
Good.
Deib gave me a ring.

738
00:42:18,501 --> 00:42:21,405
[Bhaves] A ring?
Let me see.

739
00:42:21,704 --> 00:42:22,873
Here.

740
00:42:23,007 --> 00:42:29,280
Nice! Your grandpa gave me
something like this.

741
00:42:29,579 --> 00:42:30,947
Which grandpa?

742
00:42:31,081 --> 00:42:33,117
Mom's dad or Uncle Boyet's dad?

743
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:36,619
Your Uncle Boyet's.
Grandpa Tunying!

744
00:42:37,021 --> 00:42:39,590
Your Grandpa Berto
didn't marry me, remember?

745
00:42:39,722 --> 00:42:41,525
That's why your mom's surname

746
00:42:41,659 --> 00:42:43,927
is my maiden name, del Valle.

747
00:42:44,795 --> 00:42:47,764
Oh, so that's why
you and Uncle Boyet

748
00:42:48,097 --> 00:42:50,000
have Santos as your last name

749
00:42:50,134 --> 00:42:52,302
while Max and her mom
Aunt Heart are del Valle?

750
00:42:52,802 --> 00:42:54,038
[Bhaves] Yes.

751
00:42:54,505 --> 00:42:55,371
My daughter Heart...

752
00:42:55,706 --> 00:42:57,641
was born out of wedlock.

753
00:42:57,775 --> 00:43:02,980
Then she gave birth to Max
out of wedlock.

754
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:06,717
Max, your first kid

755
00:43:06,849 --> 00:43:11,355
better not be born out of
wedlock!

756
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:13,023
Grams, I'm too young for that!

757
00:43:13,157 --> 00:43:15,391
I'll get married before having a
baby!

758
00:43:15,525 --> 00:43:17,561
And before all that,

759
00:43:17,695 --> 00:43:20,496
I'll get a diploma and a job
first!

760
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:21,331
You're right.

761
00:43:21,465 --> 00:43:22,132
Hey!

762
00:43:22,599 --> 00:43:24,335
What's all this marriage talk
I'm hearing about?

763
00:43:25,469 --> 00:43:30,373
What's all this marriage talk?!
You're too young!

764
00:43:30,507 --> 00:43:32,409
Not you, Mom,
you've had too many weddings.

765
00:43:32,543 --> 00:43:33,476
-[Max laughs]
-Just kidding.

766
00:43:33,610 --> 00:43:35,012
Why are you talking about
weddings?

767
00:43:35,913 --> 00:43:41,485
Max was just telling us
about their monthsary.

768
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:42,686
Monthsary?

769
00:43:43,186 --> 00:43:45,255
[Boyet] How was your
monthsary with Deib?

770
00:43:45,389 --> 00:43:47,657
Good, especially because

771
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:48,826
Deib's big brother finally woke
up.

772
00:43:48,958 --> 00:43:51,795
He's been in a coma for months.

773
00:43:53,764 --> 00:43:57,300
Deib had a brother in a coma?

774
00:43:57,601 --> 00:44:00,403
Yes, Dale was shot.

775
00:44:00,938 --> 00:44:03,539
They haven't found the shooter.

776
00:44:04,074 --> 00:44:06,777
Deib's big brother was
the varsity captain, right?

777
00:44:07,344 --> 00:44:10,681
So that's why they lost
at the Interhigh last year.

778
00:44:10,813 --> 00:44:12,849
Deib's big brother was in the
hospital.

779
00:44:14,717 --> 00:44:15,786
When was this?

780
00:44:15,918 --> 00:44:17,655
When you were in the US.

781
00:44:18,121 --> 00:44:21,057
Their lawyer was
Dad's law school classmate.

782
00:44:21,425 --> 00:44:23,027
He had dinner with Dad
here in the house.

783
00:44:23,159 --> 00:44:25,362
He told us about the case.

784
00:44:25,929 --> 00:44:29,699
Likely carnapping gone wrong.

785
00:44:30,166 --> 00:44:34,538
They were parked
outside of a club then...

786
00:44:35,239 --> 00:44:36,672
Yeah. It's definitely Dale.

787
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:39,009
He was with Deib that night.

788
00:44:39,143 --> 00:44:42,246
Dale was shot
and just left for dead.

789
00:44:43,012 --> 00:44:44,114
Uncle Boyet,

790
00:44:44,248 --> 00:44:46,416
remember when I bumped
into Deib in Mindoro?

791
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:50,853
He was in a hurry then
because his private investigator

792
00:44:50,987 --> 00:44:53,257
found the suspects in Mindoro.

793
00:44:54,590 --> 00:44:55,626
Really?

794
00:44:55,958 --> 00:44:58,027
[Bhaves] That's horrible!

795
00:44:58,528 --> 00:45:03,367
They should be caught
and rot in prison!

796
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:05,101
[Boyet chokes]

797
00:45:05,235 --> 00:45:07,403
Uncle Boyet, everything okay?

798
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:08,539
Sorry, sorry...

799
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:11,307
Sorry,

800
00:45:11,442 --> 00:45:14,978
Bathroom break.
Think I got an upset stomach.

801
00:45:15,344 --> 00:45:16,880
[Bhaves]
Must be chronic at this rate.

802
00:45:17,014 --> 00:45:18,949
[Max] Oh, Uncle Boyet.

803
00:45:19,949 --> 00:45:21,719
- [tense music playing]
- [Boyet panting]

804
00:45:21,851 --> 00:45:22,452
[door closes]

805
00:45:30,527 --> 00:45:32,963
[news article] Attempted
carnapping victim

806
00:45:33,097 --> 00:45:34,431
in critical condition!

807
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:37,134
Dale Enrile in critical
condition after getting shot.

808
00:45:37,266 --> 00:45:38,869
Unidentified concerned citizen

809
00:45:39,001 --> 00:45:40,103
called the ambulance.

810
00:45:47,443 --> 00:45:48,344
Mother--

811
00:45:50,514 --> 00:45:51,347
It's him!

812
00:45:51,481 --> 00:45:53,983
[tense music swelling]

813
00:46:22,278 --> 00:46:24,280
Seniors, time to plan for your
future!

814
00:46:24,414 --> 00:46:26,349
[Headmaster] We're having
a career fair this week.

815
00:46:26,483 --> 00:46:28,418
You two again!
You're attached at the hip.

816
00:46:28,552 --> 00:46:31,188
We get it, you're such a match!
Let's go!

817
00:46:31,588 --> 00:46:32,989
[Deib] Defending someone
who's guilty,

818
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:34,423
that doesn't bother you at all?

819
00:46:34,557 --> 00:46:35,525
Where's your morality?

820
00:46:35,659 --> 00:46:36,960
Deib, Kim...

821
00:46:37,094 --> 00:46:39,061
Do you also have a Maxim Luna

822
00:46:39,195 --> 00:46:40,931
and JP Quisimbing
fighting over you?

823
00:46:41,063 --> 00:46:43,699
Whoa! Mr. Gonzales is kidding.
Don't listen to him.

824
00:46:43,833 --> 00:46:44,835
I deserve the truth, Max.

825
00:46:44,967 --> 00:46:46,503
And I deserve your trust!

826
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:47,403
If that's what you think,

827
00:46:47,538 --> 00:46:48,838
then you never trusted me at
all!

828
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:52,041
[Boyet] I just can't forget it
because the person we shot

829
00:46:52,175 --> 00:46:54,177
is the brother
of my niece's boyfriend!

830
00:46:54,545 --> 00:46:55,211
[glass shatters]

831
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:57,414
[Max] Uncle Boyet?
