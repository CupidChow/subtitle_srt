84
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:14,921

Sorry, Uncle Boyet didn't
intend for that to happen.

[Max] He was just terrified.

he would never hurt anyone.

00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:40,032
We didn't even do anything!

176
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:41,951
We got blamed
for pulling the fire alarm.

177
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:45,871
That stupid fire alarm. Hassle.

178
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:48,332
Whoever pulled that prank
better fess up now!

179
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,042
[door opens]

180
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:55,923
Welcome to detention, kids.

181
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:59,593
You know the rules.
Phones, please. First row.

182
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:02,721
Don't you give me those looks!

183
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:04,932
You're not the victim here.

184
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:06,976
I am!

185
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:08,644
I didn't do anything wrong,

186
00:12:08,727 --> 00:12:13,482
but I'm here on a Saturday
watching over you outlaws

187
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:15,234
instead of having a life.

188
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:20,072
Anyway,
a few reminders before I go:

189
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:21,615
you're forbidden to go out

190
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:23,451
unless it's a medical emergency

191
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:25,035
or you need to go
to the restroom.

192
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:29,081
You're supposed to eat here,
so I hope everyone brought food.

193
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:33,335
Just take this time to reflect
on yourselves, okay?

194
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:35,963
If you cause a ruckus

195
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,132
or break the rules,

196
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:42,720
if nobody confesses
about pulling the fire alarm--

197
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:45,764
detention will be extended
for all of you!

198
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:46,807
-[students gasp]
-[Mr. Mancol] Fourth row!

199
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:49,852
What if no one confesses, sir?

200
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:52,521
True! This is so unfair!

201
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:56,233
By the way, I canceled my brow
trimming sched for this! Ugh!

202
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:57,610
[Naih] Shut up!

203
00:12:57,693 --> 00:13:00,321
Who cares about
your bushy eyebrows!

204
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:01,697
I'm not talking to you,
squammy girl!

205
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:06,410
No fighting! Phones, please,
Lorde, Khloe, and Deib.

206
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:08,078
Say bye to my viewers, sir!

207
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:08,871
Bye!

208
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,082
Sir, can I leave earlier?

209
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,001
I just have an important meeting
at 4 p.m.

210
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:17,588
No. Phone.

211
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,050
[sighs]

212
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:24,220
[Deib] <i>Let's move our meeting</i>
<i>to 5:30 p.m. please. Thanks.</i>

213
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:25,930
Sorry, sir.

214
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:32,102
I will see you at 5 p.m.

215
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:36,565
[Lorde] Guys!

216
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:38,901
Don't you worry, don't hurry!

217
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:40,736
Before we know it,
it will be 5 p.m.

218
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:42,821
[Lorde]
Time flies like a butterfly!

219
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:44,949
Look!

220
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:47,201
[Lorde] It's already 10 a.m.

221
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:51,288
[clock ticking]

222
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:02,007
What's with the long faces?

223
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:04,134
Guys, come on, come on!

224
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:08,097
[Lorde] I brought
some rice cake! [chuckles]

225
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:11,850
We got some yummy,
squishy purple yam.

226
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:17,648
And especially for you,
President Migz, banana!

227
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:23,237
And of course, sweet rice cake
for my sweetheart!

228
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:26,240
[Lorde] Come on, let's turn that
frown upside down!

229
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:29,868
I saved the best for last.
Master?

230
00:14:35,874 --> 00:14:36,792
I'm not hungry.

231
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:41,463
Not hungry? No! Here,
have some. It's my favorite.

232
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:42,715
Here.

233
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,260
It's delicious.
You can eat it later!

234
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:49,388
Okay, later.

235
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:51,807
You're so depressing.

236
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:55,102
Why don't we play a little game?

237
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:56,520
What game?

238
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:58,063
[Karlie] A guessing game!

239
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:01,442
Let's guess
what each person is here for.

240
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:05,362
[Karlie] It's so obvious
that we were wrongly accused

241
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:06,196
of pulling the fire alarm.

242
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:09,199
I think the culprit's here.

243
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:15,164
I wonder what Naih and Ysay
are doing here.

244
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:17,791
Yeah, the whole school
saw them fighting.

245
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,251
-Come here!
-That hurts!

246
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:21,795
-Traitor!
-Naih!

247
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:24,173
What were you fighting about?

248
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:29,720
There could only be one reason.

249
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:35,184
Ysay's the reason
why Lee and I fought.

250
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:36,894
You're the other woman, Ysay?!

251
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:42,566
Ysay had nothing to do
with our fight.

252
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:43,776
[friends] What then?!

253
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:45,027
-[Lee] She didn't appreciate...
-[Naih] He keeps talking...

254
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:45,861
-[Lee] my gesture.
-[Naih] about Ysay!

255
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,238
[Lorde] You're making
my head spin! Which is it?

256
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,785
He's always Ysay this
and Ysay that.

257
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:54,787
I don't feel important to him
anymore.

258
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,580
I'm his girlfriend!

259
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:59,708
So I told Lee
that if he really loves me,

260
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,960
he'll shout it out
to the whole world,

261
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:03,587
to the whole campus rather--

262
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:07,883
[Naih]
<i>It was just a little gesture.</i>

263
00:16:07,966 --> 00:16:10,094
<i>All he had to do was say</i>
<i>"I love you"</i>

264
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:10,469
<i>through the PA system,</i>

265
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:13,722
<i>so my followers</i>
<i>and Lee's admirers would know</i>

266
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:14,973
<i>that I'm the only one he loves.</i>

267
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:17,309
<i>Because</i>
<i>I'd do that for him, too.</i>

268
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:34,618
[Lee] <i>Ysay, help! What do I say?</i>
<i>I'm not good at this stuff.</i>

269
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:41,041
[Ysay] <i>Don't force yourself</i>
<i>if you really can't.</i>

270
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,042
<i>Just be you, Lee.</i>

271
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,377
[door opens]

272
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:45,546
What are you doing here?!

273
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:51,343
I'm sorry, Mine.
I really tried, but it's...

274
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:53,095
It's just not me.

275
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,222
Or you just don't love me.

276
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:57,391
[melancholic music playing]

277
00:16:57,474 --> 00:16:58,100
What?!

278
00:16:58,434 --> 00:16:59,685
How could you say that?

279
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:02,104
[Lee]
I show you that I love you.

280
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:03,981
We do what you like together.

281
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:06,859
[Lee] I join you
on your livestream

282
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:07,901
when you sell products.

283
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:11,113
I always show
and tell you that I love you

284
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:12,489
in the way I know how.

285
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:15,409
And now I'm going
to detention for you.

286
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:17,244
And I still don't love you?!

287
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:19,455
[Lee]
It's still not enough for you?!

288
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:31,842
[phone pings]

289
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:45,522
[Ysay] <i>I hope she understands.</i>

290
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:52,196
[Naih] <i>Then I found out</i>
<i>that Ysay discouraged Lee</i>

291
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:55,032
<i>from doing the gesture.</i>

292
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:59,244
What?!
You went through my messages?!

293
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:02,706
She showed them to me
when she attacked me.

294
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:06,335
Here! Evidence! You flirt!

295
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:08,921
And you're adding fuel
to the fire?!

296
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:11,632
Okay, okay! Chill, boss ladies.

297
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:14,885
[Lorde] Let's take a timeout
and ask somebody else.

298
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:17,596
I'm sure everyone's curious
why the star is here.

299
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:20,516
So why are you here, Deib?

300
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:24,978
I cut class the day
the fire alarm was pulled.

301
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:27,481
-I got a text from Dale...
-[Lorde] What?

302
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:30,609
saying I should meet him at home
for something urgent.

303
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:33,779
Huh? I was with Dale that day.

304
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:34,363
[friends gasp]

305
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:36,615
Wait.

306
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:40,619
Why were you and Dale together?
Hmm?

307
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:45,415
[romantic music playing]

308
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:46,375
[Michiko] Dale!

309
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:49,294
What are you doing here?

310
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:51,296
Nurse, thank you.

311
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,589
Alright, sir.

312
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:54,716
[Dale] For you.

313
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:58,303
Thank you!

314
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:01,682
You're always the one
visiting me,

315
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:04,226
so this time I came to you.

316
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:06,937
Let's have an adventure!

317
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:08,981
Adventure?

318
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:11,483
What adventure?

319
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:12,442
Anything.

320
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:16,905
I want to live with no regrets,
less worries,

321
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:20,617
and do more of the things
that make me happy.

322
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,420
Ready for takeoff, ma'am?

323
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,590
[both laughing]

324
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:37,551
[Michiko] Let's go!

325
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:38,594
[Migz]<i> That's so sweet!</i>

326
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:40,846
[Migz] And we're only
hearing about this now?!

327
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:43,390
-[Ysay] Yeah, Michiko!
-[Naih] True that!

328
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:45,601
Because... well...

329
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:47,352
[friends] What?

330
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:52,608
Wait, we're getting off-topic.
Deib, why are you in detention?

331
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:56,486
You're distracting us!

332
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,906
But yeah, Master,
what really happened?

333
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:02,826
[Karlie]
Got a date, didn't you?!

334
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:05,454
[Ysay]
Deib! You went on a date?!

335
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:07,497
Deib! You went on a date?!
You move on fast!

336
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,296
I cut class
because I had a meeting.

337
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:16,798
Not a date. A meeting!

338
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:20,260
I was in a hurry.
I got in a fender bender.

339
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:23,805
The other driver turned out
to be Headmaster's secretary...

340
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,391
[Deib] Worse, I was in uniform.

341
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:28,852
So, detention.

342
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:32,314
Deja vu!
Isn't that how you guys met?

343
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:33,357
Yeah,

344
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,985
he was a yelling hothead
even then.

345
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,446
Didn't think about
other people's feelings.

346
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:43,492
Are you pertaining to
that road accident in Mindoro

347
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,452
that you staged with your uncle

348
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:47,579
so Deib wouldn't catch him
when he went there?

349
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:51,124
-Wow! Brilliant!
-[tense music playing]

350
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,169
If I staged all that,
then I must be a fortune-teller

351
00:20:54,252 --> 00:20:56,672
for me to know
what time he'd pass by

352
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:59,675
and what car
he'd take to Mindoro!

353
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:02,886
I give the Greek oracles a run
for their money! Nice, Kim!

354
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:05,597
[Migz]
Wait, we're getting off-topic.

355
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:09,685
Deib, what was
the important meeting

356
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,812
that you were so anxious
to get to?

357
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:17,567
I was gonna meet
an informant with an evidence.

358
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:20,904
It's a video that can prove

359
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:24,366
that Max's uncle
shot my brother.

360
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:25,117
[Karlie] I knew it!

361
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,996
Or it can prove that Uncle Boyet
did not shoot your brother.

362
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:31,164
Yours seems more likely, Master.

363
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:32,874
Max has a point, Deib.

364
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:36,503
The point is we don't know
anything for sure.

365
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:39,339
There's a witness already.
The other carnapper, right?

366
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:40,590
[Karlie] Kim is right!

367
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:42,092
-Is there a party here?
-[Karlie] Shut up, squammy!

368
00:21:44,302 --> 00:21:45,470
What's with all the chatter?

369
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:48,223
[all shushing]

370
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:52,060
This is detention, not a soiree.

371
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:54,104
[Mr. Mancol]
I'll leave you guys again.

372
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:56,523
If I catch you being noisy
when I come back,

373
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:58,191
I'll extend your detention.

374
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:00,861
[Elle] The truth
will come out soon, Max.

375
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:02,821
You'll make up with Deib.

376
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:05,282
[indistinct chatter]

377
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:06,908
I don't know.

378
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:09,619
It seems impossible now.

379
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:11,413
Not you, too.

380
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:14,166
What do you mean?

381
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:15,917
Mom and Dad...

382
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,210
[somber music playing]

383
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:19,337
I feel like they've hurt
each other too much.

384
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:21,923
What happened?

385
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:23,717
The other day...

386
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:27,012
[Elle] <i>He ended up having a</i>
<i>really bad argument with Mom...</i>

387
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:31,058
If I knew that this is the life
I'll be living--

388
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:31,767
What?!

389
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:34,936
You wouldn't have chosen me?
You'd love someone else?

390
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:37,397
Is there someone else?

391
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:43,195
I'm not anything like you.
Don't even go there.

392
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:46,823
[Macy] I can't do this anymore.

393
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:49,576
[Maxim] What do you mean?

394
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:50,952
[Macy] I can't do this anymore!

395
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:52,871
[Macy crying]

396
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:54,289
[Macy] Let's separate.

397
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:56,458
[Elle] <i>My world fell apart</i>

398
00:22:58,251 --> 00:22:59,503
<i>right then and there.</i>

399
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:02,756
<i>And I knew it was wrong...</i>

400
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:05,509
<i>but I still drank.</i>

401
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:08,762
<i>And I brought some alcohol</i>
<i>to school.</i>

402
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:13,517
<i>And I got caught by the</i>
<i>last person I wanted to see.</i>

403
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:24,903
Miss Luna,
I'm worried about you.

404
00:23:27,405 --> 00:23:29,199
[Headmaster] I know things
are not so good at home,

405
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:32,119
but this kind of behavior
is not going to help.

406
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:35,038
Your mom told me
that she and your dad--

407
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:38,083
Stop flirting with my mom.

408
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:40,168
What?

409
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:43,755
I see what you're doing!
I'm not blind!

410
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:46,091
[Elle] I'm not stupid!

411
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:48,844
You haven't moved on from her!

412
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:51,179
Did you get this idea
from your dad?

413
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:52,013
No.

414
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:54,182
And get that stupid smirk
off your face!

415
00:23:55,016 --> 00:23:57,394
Are you happy
that you ruined our family?!

416
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:00,021
What kind of teacher are you?

417
00:24:00,438 --> 00:24:01,565
Elle, you've completely
misunderstood--

418
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:02,649
[bleep]

419
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,818
[bleep]

420
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:06,778
You cursed him out?

421
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:08,738
I know, I was wrong.

422
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:10,323
I was drunk.

423
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,450
That's why I'm in detention.

424
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:14,953
Things between Dad and Aunt Macy
are that bad?

425
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:17,831
Elle, why didn't you tell me?

426
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,959
You have a lot on your plate.

427
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:23,211
I didn't wanna add to it.

428
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:25,839
[Max] Elle, it will all be okay.

429
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:28,884
Next time there's a problem,
you can tell me.

430
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:35,932
Did you hear that?
Elle was drunk in school.

431
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:38,476
Which means she could've
pulled the fire alarm?

432
00:24:39,102 --> 00:24:39,978
Gotcha!

433
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:43,398
I think we found the culprit.
We can go home!

434
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:45,901
[Karlie] Admit it.

435
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:48,528
You pulled the fire alarm,
right?

436
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:49,446
What?

437
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:50,697
No.

438
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:53,825
"No"?! You were intoxicated
and because of that,

439
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:55,577
you did something stupid!

440
00:24:55,952 --> 00:24:59,372
Yes, I was drunk,
but that was a different day

441
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:01,249
[Elle]
When the fire alarm was pulled,

442
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:04,044
Migz, Lorde, Lee and I were
trying to stop Naih and Ysay

443
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:05,754
from clawing each other's
eyes out.

444
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:08,715
[indistinct arguing]

445
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:09,466
[loud slap]

446
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:11,509
[playful music playing]

447
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:13,345
Lorde! You okay?

448
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:14,179
Hmm?

449
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:17,098
[fire alarm blaring]

450
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:22,145
Right! Madam Elle was the only
one who asked if I was alright!

451
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:27,067
See this? This is where
Naih's punches landed.

452
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:27,901
[Naih] Sorry!

453
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:29,027
Okay, fine.

454
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,445
So who wasn't at the fight?

455
00:25:30,528 --> 00:25:32,072
We should interrogate them.

456
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:37,953
Well, Deib wasn't in school.
So that leaves Michiko and Max.

457
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:42,040
Right, ex-madam Max,
we haven't heard from you.

458
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:44,584
I was at the
Law & Governance talk.

459
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:46,461
Kim's grandpa
was the guest speaker.

460
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:50,006
[Cong. Araneta]
I monitored the manhunt

461
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:52,676
for your schoolmate's
shooter myself.

462
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:59,891
Criminals should go to jail.

463
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:05,355
Those thieves are lazy.
They just don't want to work--

464
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:09,567
A corrupt government official
is also a thief, right?

465
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:11,569
The ones who steal
the taxpayers' money

466
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:13,613
to make themselves rich?

467
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:17,242
Is that the criminal's niece

468
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:22,372
that's really accusing me
of being a crook?

469
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:23,081
Huh?

470
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:26,418
I never said you were a crook,
Congressman.

471
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,461
Why? Are you guilty?

472
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:30,588
[fire alarm blaring]

473
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:32,173
[Lee]
You stood up to Kim's grandpa?!

474
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:34,217
Is that why you're in detention,
Max?

475
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:38,096
I just asked a question.
It's not my fault he got pissed.

476
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:39,889
The shoe fits.

477
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,019
My grandpa is not corrupt.

478
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:45,478
Wait, wait.

479
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:47,814
Didn't you tell us
that your grandpa said

480
00:26:47,897 --> 00:26:50,317
that an elected official's
first term is spent trying

481
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,445
to earn back the money
he spent in the first election

482
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:55,780
and saving up
for the second term?

483
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:57,657
-[Karlie] Yeah, I remember that!
-[Khloe] Yeah.

484
00:26:57,741 --> 00:26:59,701
Then, in the second term,
they have to make money

485
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:01,036
to run for a third term.

486
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:03,121
And it's only on the third term
that they are able

487
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:04,497
to serve their constituents

488
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:06,207
because they already stole
more than enough to--

489
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:09,294
Shut up, Khloe!

490
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:11,338
Whatever!

491
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:13,965
At least my grandpa's
not in a syndicate.

492
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:15,425
Unlike your--

493
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:17,177
We're not in a syndicate!

494
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:18,970
-We're not criminals!
-[somber music playing]

495
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:22,640
My family isn't perfect,
they've made mistakes,

496
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:24,517
but they're not bad people!

497
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:27,062
[Max]
Yes, my mom was once a thief,

498
00:27:27,645 --> 00:27:29,939
but she changed
because she knew

499
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:31,316
that she wouldn't
be able to raise me right

500
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:33,485
if she continued that path.

501
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:39,741
My grandma and uncle couldn't
finish school or earn much,

502
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:42,369
but they never stepped on
others to get by.

503
00:27:43,244 --> 00:27:45,580
The little
that we had we earned

504
00:27:45,663 --> 00:27:48,917
through hard work
and perseverance.

505
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:51,628
When my grandma's body
was giving up,

506
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:54,714
she still worked
to put food in our table.

507
00:27:57,801 --> 00:28:01,179
That's a great sob story, Max.

508
00:28:01,262 --> 00:28:02,764
You almost made me cry.

509
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:07,102
Except it still doesn't explain
why your uncle

510
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:09,771
was there that night
to steal a car.

511
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:13,608
[Kim] You said he's honest,
not lazy, willing to work hard.

512
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:15,193
So tell me,

513
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:17,987
why the hell was he there?

514
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:19,989
[Deib] Yeah, Max.

515
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,284
Why was Uncle Boyet there?

516
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:26,704
Why was he with the carnappers?

517
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:32,877
Because of me.

518
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:35,422
[Michiko] Poor Max.

519
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:38,550
I got dengue. He didn't have
money to pay the hospital bills.

520
00:28:39,592 --> 00:28:41,261
He must've felt like
he had no choice.

521
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:45,432
[Kim]
There's always a choice, Max.

522
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:49,144
And your uncle
chose to shoot Dale.

523
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:49,686
[Karlie] I agree.

524
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:52,439
[Kim] So when are you going
to choose to accept the truth?

525
00:28:55,316 --> 00:28:56,693
[Naih, Elle] Max!

526
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:06,369
Max!

527
00:29:07,036 --> 00:29:07,745
-Max, wait!
-[elevator dings]

528
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:09,038
What? Just go!

529
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:18,214
Max!

530
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:20,967
Max, wait!

531
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:22,135
Max!

532
00:29:22,218 --> 00:29:23,511
Why are you following me, Deib?!

533
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:24,721
Let's talk please!

534
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:27,849
Max, I'm sorry. I didn't know--

535
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:28,808
[power shuts off]

536
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:30,643
[emergency lights whirring]

537
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:31,561
What happened?

538
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:33,646
Blackout?!

539
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:36,733
[both] Help!

540
00:29:37,358 --> 00:29:38,860
[both] Help!

541
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,361

542
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:45,492
-Oops!
-[playful music playing]

543
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:47,202
Are you guys okay?

544
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:49,204
There's a problem
with the fusebox.

545
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:51,498
They're fixing it right now.
Don't worry.

546
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:55,585
Where are Mr. Enrile
and Ms. Del Valle?

547
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:57,587
[Naih, Lorde] Restroom!

548
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:58,588
At the same time?

549
00:29:58,671 --> 00:30:00,632
You can wait for them
if you want, sir!

550
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:01,549
Yeah!

551
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:03,343
Okay, sure!

552
00:30:03,426 --> 00:30:04,219
[phone ringing]

553
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:06,179
[Naih]
He chose to be agreeable now?!

554
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:07,555
Hello?

555
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:09,933
[Mr. Mancol] Yes, sure.

556
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:11,434
Okay, I'm coming.

557
00:30:12,435 --> 00:30:15,813
I will check with the school
engineer regarding the blackout.

558
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:16,898
[Mr. Mancol] I'll be back.

559
00:30:17,273 --> 00:30:20,068
Somebody check on Max and Deib.

560
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:21,694
-[Naih] Perfect, sir!
-[Ysay] Copy, sir!

561
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:24,447
Where could they be?

562
00:30:25,698 --> 00:30:26,533
[exhales]

563
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:30,620
Ouch!

564
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:32,580
Max, sit down.
Sit down.

565
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:33,665
-I'm fine.
-Sit down

566
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:34,666
Please.

567
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:46,386
[Deib] You're hurt.

568
00:30:46,844 --> 00:30:47,971
You have a sprain.

569
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:50,265
I'm fine.
Don't touch me.

570
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:54,269
We have to put cold compress
on this once we leave--

571
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:56,563
I said I'm fine!
Just leave it alone!

572
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:59,399
Just relax your foot, will you?

573
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,277
[Deib] It's useless!
We're stuck here.

574
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:05,071
And I don't like it any more
than you do.

575
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:16,332
[Deib sighs]

576
00:31:21,796 --> 00:31:22,672
I'm sorry.

577
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:26,217
Sorry for what? Deib?

578
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:32,890
Sorry that you chose to believe
a total stranger over me?

579
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:35,435
[Max] That you gave up on us?

580
00:31:36,185 --> 00:31:38,688
That you didn't trust me?
That you still don't trust me?

581
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:41,858
Or that you don't love me?

582
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:45,236
Max, I never said--

583
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:49,532
Love without trust is not love.
Your words.

584
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:52,493
[sad music playing]

585
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:56,831
[sighs]

586
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:02,462
I'm saying sorry
for my insensitivity earlier.

587
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:05,381
I didn't know you got sick.

588
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:11,095
But that doesn't change
what Uncle Boyet did, Max.

589
00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:21,314
[Karlie] I'm melting!

590
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:25,818
Awesome, right?!
It's like we're in outer space!

591
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:28,946
-[Michiko] It's so hot!
-[Ysay] Let's stay cool.

592
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:30,907
You!

593
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:32,909
[Karlie] You did it!

594
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:34,744
You're the only one
without an alibi.

595
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:38,414
I told you I was with Dale.

596
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:40,667
Guys,
let's look for Max and Deib--

597
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,251
Shhh!

598
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:45,296
This is more urgent. I'm sure
they're not waiting for us.

599
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:48,716
Okay wait! Michiko,
you said you were with Dale,

600
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,968
you were supposed
to go on an "adventure,"

601
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:52,345
but you were still in school?

602
00:32:52,428 --> 00:32:53,763
Make it make sense!

603
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,390
We were in
another part of school.

604
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,391
Where?

605
00:32:58,434 --> 00:33:00,687
-[Michiko] Not so fast!
-[Dale chuckling]

606
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:03,356
-[Dale] Turn!
-Look at that!

608
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:06,109
Yeah!

-"Most Valuable Player."
-Wow!

610
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:10,571
But wait,
are you sure about this?

["Hindi Kita Iiwan"
by Sam Milby playing]

612
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:13,950
No, but...

613
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:16,953
we're trying to be young
and stupid, right?

614
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:17,870
Yeah.

615
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:23,292
And besides, we didn't graduate
with our batch,

616
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:26,921
so we're not supposed to be
in their time capsule.

617
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:31,342
Okay, let's just get our entries
and get out of here.

618
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:32,051
Yeah.

619
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:34,262
Hold this.

620
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:41,853
You can do it!

621
00:33:44,897 --> 00:33:46,941
Here's mine.

622
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:52,196
Is that the "thank you" card
I gave you?

623
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:56,784
When you baked me
a carrot cake for my birthday?

624
00:33:58,244 --> 00:33:59,036
Yes.

625
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:01,372
Why did you put that?

626
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:03,791
No reason!
I just wanted to. Why?

00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:04,751
Yours?

628
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:06,669
What did you put?

629
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:09,005
Where is it?

630
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:12,800
A letter!

631
00:34:13,342 --> 00:34:13,801
Here.

632
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:18,473
I wonder who
your "future wife" is, Tutor?

633
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:20,183
[Michiko] May I read it?

00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:21,017
Yes.

most selfless person I know."

00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:43,915

"I don't know if you remember

646
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:59,931
but the carrot cake you baked
for me for my birthday?"

647
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:04,519
"That really cheered me up."

648
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:08,189
It is me.

649
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:11,984
Go on.

00:35:14,987 --> 00:35:16,114

"But thank God
for that heartbreak

"I hope that after 25 years,
as I open this,

How sweet, Dale!

661
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:48,437
[Michiko] Thank you!

662
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:50,773
Can I keep it?

663
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,066
No!

664
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:55,361
It's corny and cheesy.

665
00:35:55,611 --> 00:35:56,237
-No.
-It's not.

666
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,657
It's not!
It's mine now!

667

You sure?

668
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:04,996
Don't want you to be pressured
because of that letter.

701
00:38:54,623 --> 00:38:55,207
Deib.

702
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:57,043
I'm just going to say one thing.

703
00:38:58,002 --> 00:38:59,295
[Deib]
You don't have to respond.

704
00:39:02,965 --> 00:39:04,008
I miss you.

705
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:10,598
[sweet music playing]

706
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:18,564
I miss your smile.

707
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:22,818
[Deib]<i> </i>I miss your laugh.

708
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:25,738
I miss your voice.

709
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:28,240
[Deib]
Your morning wake-up calls.

710
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:31,869
I miss you

711
00:39:32,161 --> 00:39:33,537
singing to me.

712
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:38,334
[Deib] I miss you
telling me you love me.

713
00:39:40,002 --> 00:39:41,462
I miss hugging you,

714
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:43,839
holding your hand,

715
00:39:45,382 --> 00:39:46,675
kissing you.

716
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:52,056
I miss thinking that I can
do anything and everything,

717
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:55,351
just as long as
I have you in my corner.

718
00:39:57,978 --> 00:39:59,730
[Deib] I miss making you happy

719
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:03,275
I miss you

720
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:05,361
so much.

721
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:08,197
[Deib] I miss us.

722
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:11,700
I miss us so much

723
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:14,120
that part of me
just wants to stay

724
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:17,331
in this elevator forever.

725
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:21,919
Away from everything.

726
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:25,965
Right next to you.

727
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:32,179
But you seem so far away.

728
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:44,650
You can have it.

729
00:40:45,192 --> 00:40:46,777
You look like you need it more.

730
00:40:48,445 --> 00:40:49,864
You don't need it?

731
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:52,992
[Deib] You don't miss me?

732
00:40:54,326 --> 00:40:55,995
Do you not miss us?

733
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:28,277
RJ, what now?
This is your chance!

734
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,279
Either make your move
or move on.

735
00:41:30,529 --> 00:41:33,532
I think Max and that bully
are super over now,

736
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:36,827
so grab this opportunity
to get her back.

737
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:37,995
[door opens]

738
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:39,747
Look at this.

739
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:41,957
This was recovered
from the cellphone found

740
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:44,793
where Deib's private
investigator was run over.

741
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:47,171
Now this is the CCTV footage
of the carnapping.

742
00:41:47,254 --> 00:41:48,214
[Zell] Just a sec, RJ.

743
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:49,590
Dad is giving an update
about the case.

744
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:51,675
Wait. That's your brother?
Can I talk to him please?

745
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:55,387
-Son, ask Max where she is.
-[suspenseful music playing]

746
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:57,473
Get her. She needs to see this.

747
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:00,017
[Karlie] My makeup's melting!

748
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:02,311
It's hot, huh?
You can have this fan.

749
00:42:02,394 --> 00:42:03,354
[Naih] It's so hot!

750
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:04,647
-You have it!
-Here.

751
00:42:05,522 --> 00:42:08,108
[Karlie] It's so hot!
Does anyone have a facial mist?

752
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:11,111
-[Migz] Why is it so hot!
-[Naih] I can't take this!

753
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:12,821
[Ysay]
Good thing you brought a fan!

754
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:13,948
[Lee] It's so hot!

755
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:16,825
[Ysay] Here.

756
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:22,164
No, thanks. You might ask
for my boyfriend in exchange.

757
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:26,377
Naih, I know you're only saying
that because you're hurt.

758
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:28,671
[Ysay] But I would never
steal Lee from you.

759
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,381
Look, I'm sorry--

760
00:42:30,464 --> 00:42:31,924
So you admit
you did something wrong?

761
00:42:32,007 --> 00:42:34,760
Alright, boss ladies!
Let's calm down!

762
00:42:34,843 --> 00:42:36,178
Why don't we play a game

763
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:38,097
so you can channel
your energy somewhere else?

764
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:42,017
I know!
Let's play "Only Lorde Knows!"

765
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:43,602
-[cheers]
-[Migz] Perfect. I love it!

766
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:46,146
No!
I'm always "it" in that game!

767
00:42:46,605 --> 00:42:47,940
Let's play a different game!
