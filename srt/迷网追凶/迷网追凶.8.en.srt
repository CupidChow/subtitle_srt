EPISODE 8

00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:52,010
LABORATORY 1

3
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:04,439
Doctor!

4
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:40,475
Why? Why does this always happen
if you live?

5
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:43,019
No! Don't come out!

6
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:48,900
Siwon.

7
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:54,906
Siwon!

8
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:56,533
Siwon!

9
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,619
No! Siwon!

10
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:03,873
You! Why...

11
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:07,168
Siwon. It's okay. It's all right.

12
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:24,102
"D-Panthenol."

13
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:25,395
A vitamin?

14
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:29,606
What must I do?

15
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:34,445
What must I do to change the outcome?
You know the answer.

16
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:36,943
If I save someone's life, 
the Grid disappears.

17
00:02:36,953 --> 00:02:38,283
And if I try to change that...

18
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:40,577
You must know another way.
- WOMAN: I don't.

19
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,537
No, you must know.

20
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,497
Hey! Careful!
- Come down!

21
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:47,125
I did it because it's the only way I know.

22
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:48,793
So this is it?

23
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,923
WOMAN: Don't try to change anything.

24
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:56,885
SAEHA: I teleported many times,
but I'm fine.

25
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:00,680
I'm talking about your damaged DNA.

26
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:03,057
You're not sick.

27
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:04,767
You're perishing.

28
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:06,968
WOMAN: Thanks to you, I got much better.

29
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:09,147
Does the janitor have to die
for you to live?

30
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:11,816
Then what about my father?

31
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:14,819
No, right?

32
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:16,821
You just needed an ID
for the lab, didn't you?

33
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:22,744
That's what I thought.

34
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:28,166
RESTROOM
UNDER THE TRUCK

35
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:33,755
You even burned a man to death
before his child's eyes.

36
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:35,518
Do people in the future
have no conscience?

37
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,133
Don't you feel sorry for the victims?

38
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,597
WOMAN: A lot of people died
during the Joseon Dynasty.

39
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,098
Is that heartbreaking too?

40
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,646
What are you waiting for?
Go save those people.

41
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:52,180
Only then can you
call yourself conscientious.

42
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,817
You wouldn't have gone this far
if it were for the Grid.

43
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,611
This must be to save your own skin.

44
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:59,094
You're going around ruining everything
just to save yourself.

45
00:03:59,113 --> 00:04:00,740
You're the one ruining everything.

46
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:08,623
Stay out of this.

47
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:44,242
WOMAN: <i>Move forward slowly.</i>

48
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:51,708
<i>You're the one ruining everything.</i>

49
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:54,334
<i>Stay out of this.</i>

50
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:08,599
MAY 18, 1997

51
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:12,854
LABORATORY 1

52
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:26,117
CUSTODIAL ROOM

53
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:48,014
Why is it different?

54
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:37,563
Siwon. Go over there. Hurry.

55
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:39,941
Go now!

56
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:50,701
Dad!

57
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:01,878
Get up.

58
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:06,676
Let's go.

59
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:43,373
Mr. Kwon!

60
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:48,713
SAEHA: That's enough.

61
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:54,093
He won't tell anyone.

62
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,720
Don't hurt him.

63
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:03,144
I won't tell anyone. I swear... I won't.

64
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:05,187
I wouldn't be here
if it weren't for his help.

65
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,231
It doesn't matter.
I can always turn back time.

66
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:08,733
Then no one will know.

67
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:14,478
Until someone comes,
he'll be lying here all night long.

68
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,702
Please contact his family.
- I will.

69
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:25,791
It's not your fault.

70
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:28,406
What happened to that child too.

71
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:58,074
YEAR 2000

72
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:11,533
SAEHA: You won't make it home
before sunset at that rate.

73
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:14,798
Who, me?

74
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:16,966
Yes, you.

75
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:18,968
Kwon Saeha.

76
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:20,930
Do you know me?

77
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,684
SAEHA: 
Do you not want to go home quickly?

78
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:29,083
Because your mom drinks all the time?

79
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:44,412
Who are you, mister?

80
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:47,957
I'm a friend of your dad's.

81
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:51,460
My dad passed away

82
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:53,462
a long time ago.

83
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:55,464
SAEHA: Is that so?

84
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:58,718
9-YEAR-OLD SAEHA:
He passed away mysteriously.

85
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:01,345
SAEHA: Mysteriously? How?

86
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:03,513
I don't know.

87
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,979
I heard it was like he got electrocuted.

88
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,649
Who told you that?

89
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:15,901
9-YEAR-OLD SAEHA: I don't know.

90
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:17,862
My uncle.

91
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:20,906
I heard him say that to my mom.

92
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:29,038
Saeha.

93
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:34,545
Hurry up and go home.
I know you want to go to the bathroom.

94
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:36,881
How did you know?

95
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:40,801
Go to the bathroom first
when you get home. Okay?

96
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:08,954
You'll be fine.

97
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:13,209
You'll become a grown-up soon.

98
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:16,754
Let's do...

99
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,090
everything we want to do then.

100
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:25,387
Your mom loves you.

101
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:28,390
She's just...

102
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:32,102
having a hard time now.

103
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:36,857
So don't hate her so much.

104
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:41,695
It's a blue light. Go on now.

105
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:45,866
It's a green light.

106
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,287
Saeha. You aren't home yet, are you?

107
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,422
Are you home, Saeha?

108
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:39,313
GREEN SOUL PSYCHIATRY

109
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:45,069
DEPRESSION IS A COLD OF THE MIND

110
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:47,992
IF YOU DON'T TREAT DEPRESSION,
IT COULD CAUSE PSYCHOLOGICAL DISORDERS...

111
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:07,132
I already injected a lot.

112
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,969
This will be lethal.
- Don't do it, Eojin.

113
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:11,971
If she gets it back, it's over.

114
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:14,098
Don't you know
what we've sacrificed for...

115
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:43,711
What a great persuader.

116
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,260
Why is that...

117
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:59,101
Put that down.

118
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:08,923
SAEBYEOK: You went there, didn't you?

119
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,822
Was this the only way?

120
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:21,373
I saw a world without the Grid.

121
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:29,757
What was it that I saw then?

122
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:40,601
You know what I'm talking about.

123
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:42,728
EOJIN: Saebyeok.

124
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:45,272
When did this happen?

125
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:47,275
Did I see it on my own,
or did you show it to me?

126
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:50,151
Answer me.

127
00:17:57,284 --> 00:17:58,160
CHAE JONGYI

128
00:17:58,243 --> 00:17:59,495
Damn it. What is it?

129
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,288
Eojin, get out of there now.

130
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:04,333
Do you think I want to be in here?

131
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,241
JONGYI (over phone): <i>You must get out now.
On the door, they set...</i>

132
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:07,961
Jongyi.
- Give it back. Who are you to...

133
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:09,045
MAJOR: Back off.

134
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:20,641
What did she say?

135
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:26,313
I'm not sure.
She said "on the door" and...

136
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:29,900
Wait.

137
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:34,113
You stay here.

138
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:51,921
No, don't do that!

139
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:53,506
Hold on!

You're Jung Saebyeok, right?
According to the DNA analysis results...

142
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:21,929
Be careful.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

143
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:23,263
Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.

144
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:24,347
Gosh.

145
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:59,091

I don't know. Saeha suddenly...

153
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:04,114
What about him?

154
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:07,122
It seemed he got into a fight
during lunchtime.

155
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:08,869
Send him to me once he comes back.

What's going on?

159
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:31,724
Hey.

160
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:35,519
Hello?

You're okay, right?

<i>You're safe, right?</i>

164
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:44,029
Why wouldn't I be okay?

165
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:48,742
You sound fine.

166
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:50,326
<i>It's fine then.</i>

167
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,833

WELL DONE! YOUR SAFETY
IS YOUR FAMILY'S HAPPINESS!

169
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:19,688
Hand it over.

00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:57,573
Thank you.

177
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:07,083
Go bring a station worker.

178
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:08,710
Oh, okay.

179
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:13,590
Damn it.

180
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:16,801

00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:29,684
What is this? What happened to you?

185
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,019
Did you have an accident?

186
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:33,021
Are you okay, Mom?

187
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:36,191
I should be asking you. You're bleeding.

188
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:37,400
Who did this to you?

189
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:40,320
Oh, it got on me during
an evacuation drill. It's not mine.

190
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:44,866
What kind of drill makes a person look
like that? For goodness' sake.

191
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:47,368
And why can't I find the ointment?

192
00:29:49,412 --> 00:29:51,122
Did you really not have an accident?

193
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:53,124
My car is parked outside. It's fine.

194
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:55,460
How did you get that scratch 
on your face?

195
00:29:55,543 --> 00:29:57,383
What's the point of giving you
a handsome face?

196
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:23,655
2005 THE HERO OF THE WORLD
THE LATE DOCTOR KWON SUKEUN

197
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:29,051
10TH ANNUAL MEMORIAL CEREMONY
FOR THE DEATH OF DOCTOR KWON SUKEUN

198
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:39,087
Did someone at your company do this?
Is that why you're home early?

199
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:41,130
Who at my company would do this?

200
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:43,675
That viper.

201
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:47,804
Who knows what she has done
to my precious son?

202
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:49,889
Who's the viper?

203
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:05,989
You know this person, don't you?

204
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:10,952
No, I've never seen him before.

205
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:13,788
What's your husband's relationship
with him?

206
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:15,248
Any grudge against him?

207
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:16,833
Sorry?

208
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:19,197
SAEHA'S MOM: <i>"What's
your husband's relationship with him?</i>

209
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:21,087
<i>Any grudge against him?"</i>

210
00:31:21,796 --> 00:31:23,298
<i>They kept asking me those questions.</i>

211
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:27,844
I've really never seen him before.

212
00:31:27,927 --> 00:31:29,804
SAEHA'S MOM:
<i>Even though I clearly told them</i>

213
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:33,433
<i>that I had never seen that father
of a child in the picture before.</i>

214
00:31:38,521 --> 00:31:43,443
<i>I later heard that the janitor
had died, and I went to his funeral.</i>

215
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:49,407
<i>Because the lab people assumed
that my husband had a grudge against him.</i>

216
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:50,950
<i>And it was on the same day.</i>

217
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:54,329
<i>I was afraid</i>

218
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:56,915
<i>that my husband might have killed him.</i>

219
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:58,238
CERTIFICATE OF MERIT
KWON SUKEUN

220
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:00,376
I was afraid your dad
might have killed a person

221
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:03,212
and killed himself as well.

222
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:09,719
But I got kicked out
as soon as I got there.

223
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:13,181
How did the janitor's family
recognize you?

224
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:15,433
The lab people did.

225
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:17,852
She was there too.

226
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:20,772
The lab people and the deputy director

227
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:22,523
kicked you out of there?

228
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:23,900
And watched you too?

229
00:32:23,983 --> 00:32:27,153
At first, I thought they were really
treating my husband like a hero.

230
00:32:27,236 --> 00:32:32,408
And I thought they frequented our house
to check in on you and me.

231
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,244
Regardless of that,

232
00:32:36,704 --> 00:32:39,040
your dad was the one who built the Grid.

233
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:45,505
Then why did you worry
he might have killed himself?

234
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:51,052
I thought it was strange even before
your uncle said it was strange.

235
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,930
He was totally healthy,
but dying from overwork?

236
00:32:54,013 --> 00:32:55,431
How could I not know

237
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:59,268
whether he was in condition
to collapse from overwork or not?

238
00:33:00,603 --> 00:33:02,689
Anyway, they're all liars, those snakes.

239
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:06,192
Don't trust her blindly
just because she's your boss.

240
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:08,318
Okay.

241
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:11,062
AUTOMATED VOICE: <i>The person you have
called is unavailable. You'll be...</i>

242
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:12,072
KWON SAEHA

243
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:14,242
Should I keep calling?
- No.

244
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:16,828
What's with him going AWOL?

245
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:19,038
Maybe he fears nothing
because he's got connections.

246
00:33:19,747 --> 00:33:21,708
He's never flaunted
his connections though.

247
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:25,211
He looks that way to you
because you love people

248
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:27,296
who get jobs through their connections.

249
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,632
But he's like
a pillar of the organization.

250
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:33,011
You two must not fear anything too.

251
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:44,063
It's this way. Please follow me.

252
00:33:57,952 --> 00:34:01,622
My goodness.
She did say she heard something from here.

253
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:04,250
Why did she come down here alone?

254
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:07,378
I feel so bad for her. Poor lady.

255
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:09,881
It's this way.
- How could this have happened?

256
00:34:42,997 --> 00:34:43,997
Let's hear it.

257
00:34:45,958 --> 00:34:47,043
JONGYI: Ms. Choi!

258
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:13,611
Investigator Jung Saebyeok?

259
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:19,033
This is where Kim Manok was
until this morning.

260
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:21,494
I presume that he killed her
during his escape.

261
00:35:21,577 --> 00:35:24,455
Escape? Was he locked up?

262
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:25,665
It seems so.

263
00:35:25,748 --> 00:35:27,875
It's been pulled up and down recently.

264
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:32,213
What about these food packages?

265
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:34,632
He couldn't have ordered them in then.

266
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:37,093
I suppose the woman bought them herself.

267
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:39,595
Gloves are over there.

268
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:41,805
Thank you.

269
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:45,768
Then I guess these were left by the Ghost.

270
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:48,688
Since the murderer must've been locked up
inside the shutters.

271
00:35:48,771 --> 00:35:50,148
Then we'll pick them up.

272
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:51,858
No, don't touch them.

273
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:53,901
It's under their jurisdiction. Let them.

274
00:35:56,612 --> 00:35:58,406
I don't see any of your colleagues.

275
00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:02,952
Manok was caught on camera getting out of
the station, so they're out asking around.

276
00:36:03,035 --> 00:36:04,787
On the CCTV cameras here?
- SAEBYEOK: Yes.

277
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:05,997
But the woman...

278
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:08,249
I have no expectations now.

279
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:11,043
Hold on. What time
was he caught on camera?

280
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:14,297
At 10:00 a.m.
- That was only a few hours ago.

281
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:19,302
Kim Manok was caught on camera getting out
of Gudong Station at ten this morning.

282
00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:21,721
Okay. You can do that.

283
00:36:21,804 --> 00:36:23,890
The police are already
searching for him though.

284
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:26,851
What were you doing
when the detectives found traces of him?

285
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:28,686
AGENT: You may move the body now.

286
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:30,980
PARAMEDIC: Okay, but...

287
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:09,060
Honey...

288
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:14,065
My dear wife.

289
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:33,793
Honey...

290
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:04,448
How did you know Kim Manok was here?

291
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:07,076
SAEBYEOK: I didn't.
- MS. CHOI: Then?

292
00:38:07,743 --> 00:38:10,496
I had no clue, but I had to catch him.

293
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:14,875
So I thought I should start
from where he was last seen.

294
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:18,754
How did you know he was last seen here?

295
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:20,631
When the restaurant owner got hurt,

296
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:23,301
I asked people in the area then as well.

297
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:39,691
Bye, then.

298
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:41,777
Have you been transferred yet?

299
00:38:44,071 --> 00:38:45,156
Mido.

300
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:46,949
It's today.

301
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:48,993
That's right. It's today.

302
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:53,122
And it also happens to be today that
you informed us of what happened here.

303
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:58,127
But that doesn't mean
your relocation will be canceled.

304
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:00,661
I informed you
hoping you would catch the woman soon.

305
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:04,550
Because if she's not caught,
it's pointless to catch Kim Manok.

306
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:09,305
I think you would suit us better
than the police.

307
00:39:09,388 --> 00:39:10,388
The Secretariat.

308
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:17,021
I hope you'll find out for yourself...

309
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:21,776
what she is capable of doing

310
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:24,028
and what technology she uses.

311
00:39:25,154 --> 00:39:27,323
And where it takes human civilization.

312
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:32,328
I truly hope that you'll see for yourself.

313
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:09,698
Wait.
- Sorry?

314
00:40:10,282 --> 00:40:11,992
Please go first. I'll catch up with you.

315
00:41:37,244 --> 00:41:39,330
DO NOT CROSS
UNDER INVESTIGATION

316
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:01,739
DR. KWON SUKEUN TO BE AWARDED THE NOBEL
PRIZE POSTHUMOUSLY FOR THE FIRST TIME?

317
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:05,321
...HAS ALLEGEDLY BEEN NOMINATED

318
00:43:07,334 --> 00:43:08,534
...CANNOT BE AWARDED POSTHUMOUSLY

319
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:09,904
...DONE A GREAT SERVICE TO MANKIND

320
00:43:13,507 --> 00:43:16,051
HOW HIS COLLEAGUES REMEMBER
THE LATE DR. KWON SUKEUN

321
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:21,024
HE DIDN'T STAND OUT, BUT HE DEDICATED
HIMSELF TO RESEARCHING THE GRID

322
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:25,352
When that woman came to take you,

323
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:27,855
I should've thrown salt at her
and kicked her out.

324
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:30,858
Where did she take me?

325
00:43:32,234 --> 00:43:34,194
Where else? The Administration Bureau.

326
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:37,740
Talking about special employment...

327
00:43:37,906 --> 00:43:41,076
If Doctor Kwon's son didn't work
at the Administration Bureau, then who...

328
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:42,619
Goodness.

329
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:45,414
Special employment?

330
00:43:51,712 --> 00:43:53,631
The founder of the Grid has changed.

331
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,258
Does that mean...

332
00:44:54,441 --> 00:44:56,235
SONGJE POLICE STATION, JUNG SAEBYEOK

333
00:44:57,528 --> 00:45:00,823
Feel free to contact me
if you need anything.

334
00:46:10,517 --> 00:46:12,811
I should've killed that jerk.

335
00:46:24,823 --> 00:46:25,823
It's this house.

336
00:46:57,773 --> 00:46:58,941
EOJIN: Earlier, for a moment,

337
00:47:00,442 --> 00:47:03,237
I remembered what we used to be like.

338
00:47:05,697 --> 00:47:07,616
Getting calls from you while at work.

339
00:47:09,451 --> 00:47:11,036
During lunch breaks.

340
00:47:11,787 --> 00:47:13,622
Or before getting off work.

341
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:18,710
We talked about whether we'd be home late.

342
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:23,507
Or where we should meet up for dinner.
Things like that.

343
00:47:25,968 --> 00:47:28,178
We used to talk about such trivial things.

344
00:47:37,896 --> 00:47:39,189
Don't be so offended by it.

345
00:47:39,731 --> 00:47:41,567
It was just for a brief moment.

346
00:47:42,317 --> 00:47:43,569
That's not it.

347
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:54,162
Why did you wonder if I was okay?

348
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,375
I just had a bad dream.

349
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:06,341
It's not that I dream about you
every day though.

350
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:09,719
We'll be late.

351
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:12,555
For what?

352
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:22,149
Why do you think the Ghost locked him up?
She's the one who helped him flee.

353
00:48:23,525 --> 00:48:25,110
What I really don't understand is

354
00:48:26,028 --> 00:48:27,946
why she let him go now.

355
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:34,786
She opened the shutters.
That means she intended to let him go.

356
00:48:36,955 --> 00:48:38,707
Maybe she knew we'd come to get him.

357
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:40,792
How?

358
00:48:47,007 --> 00:48:49,927
I'm sure it's easy for the Ghost
to stop him from running away.

359
00:48:53,805 --> 00:48:55,057
Can I take this off?

360
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:00,604
You've changed a lot.

361
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:04,191
Before, you would have taken it off
without even asking.

362
00:49:14,701 --> 00:49:16,286
That's not what I meant.

363
00:49:21,708 --> 00:49:23,961
Is something wrong with Mr. Kwon Saeha?

364
00:49:24,044 --> 00:49:25,253
EOJIN: How do you know him?

365
00:49:25,337 --> 00:49:26,755
SAEBYEOK: Is he really sick?

366
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:28,715
Is that why he didn't come?

367
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:30,676
How do you know Kwon Saeha?

368
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:32,010
Of course I do...

369
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:37,516
We met the other day.

370
00:49:44,022 --> 00:49:46,191
He suddenly left this afternoon
and didn't come back.

371
00:49:56,535 --> 00:49:58,704
Where are you going now?
- What?

372
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:02,207
Why?
- What do you mean?

373
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:05,627
I mean, why do you ask where I'm going?

374
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:07,629
Can't I ask?

375
00:50:08,964 --> 00:50:10,549
Yes, you can.

376
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:14,386
I should get back to the station.

377
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:16,679
Songje Station.

378
00:50:21,059 --> 00:50:21,977
Okay, then.

379
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:23,478
Thanks for the ride.

380
00:50:56,595 --> 00:50:58,555
That's not the way to the station.

381
00:50:59,681 --> 00:51:01,767
CALLING
KWON SAEHA

382
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:09,149
SAEHA (over phone): <i>Hello?</i>

383
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:15,882
What's going on?

384
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:18,260
Who are you people?
- Hey, don't do that.

385
00:52:34,025 --> 00:52:35,110
Damn it.

386
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:40,115
Gosh, what's their problem?

387
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:48,498
Not here?
- MAN: No, sir.
