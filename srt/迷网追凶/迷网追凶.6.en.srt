1
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:45,170
Hurry up. Which way?

2
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:46,671
- Where?
- In the basement.

3
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:48,548
- The basement?
- The basement.

4
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:52,635
There. Hurry up. Hurry.

5
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:37,889
Where is she?

6
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:44,187
Where is she? Tell me.

7
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,191
I don't know.

8
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:54,405
Where is the woman?

9
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:55,781
I don't know.

10
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,201
I really don't.

11
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:01,621
I don't know who she is.
She's a complete stranger.

12
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:05,917
After locking me up here,
she only comes to give me food.

13
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:08,502
I don't know either.

14
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:09,545
Why did she help you?

15
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:10,713
MANOK: I don't know.

16
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:12,757
I asked her too.

17
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:16,010
But she wouldn't tell me.

18
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:18,388
I've never even heard her voice.

19
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:20,306
I swear.

20
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:28,857
Damn it.

21
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,736
Please go up and call the police...

22
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,030
Please call Songje Station
and tell Chief Go

23
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:38,533
that the convenience store suspect
has been caught.

24
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:39,616
Yes, ma'am.

25
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:51,588
Is he really the culprit?

26
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:53,464
With that woman... What was it?

27
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:54,674
The murderer?

28
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:57,218
Open this!

29
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:58,982
He's been here all along?
In this station?

30
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:04,434
JANITRESS: Detective.

31
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,980
I told you not to come back here.
It's dangerous.

32
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:13,693
Well... Can I have another look
at the picture you showed me?

33
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:14,861
The woman.

34
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:29,417
My goodness. It looks just like her
looking at it again.

35
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:32,253
STAFF: Have you seen her?

36
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:35,548
JANITRESS:
You also saw her earlier, Detective.

37
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:38,509
The lady who was harassed by those guys.

38
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:40,093
What?

39
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:44,307
I thought she was a homeless person
when I first saw her.

40
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:49,479
In this station?

41
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,398
I'm not sure if there is any.

42
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,111
Because she kept washing up
at the station.

43
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:58,821
When did she start... No.

44
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:01,866
Do you know where she is...

45
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,203
Damn it.

46
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:09,874
Well... I don't know where she is either.

47
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:15,546
Where?

48
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:16,881
This way! Please follow me!

49
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:19,884
Hey! Jung Saebyeok!

50
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:23,179
Why did you come here alone?

51
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,348
What if you got hurt, you punk?

52
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:27,892
I'm sorry.

53
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:29,644
- What are you waiting for?
- Okay, sir.

54
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:30,895
Let's go.

55
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:32,229
For God's sake.

56
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,108
Good job.

57
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:38,236
What about the woman?

58
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:42,573
- Please collect the things here.
- Yes, ma'am.

59
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:45,451
It seems that she bought food
from restaurants.

60
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:46,535
What?

61
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,122
- Collect all of them. They're important.
- Yes, sir.

62
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:51,124
We'll have to check the restaurants then.

63
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:52,207
More importantly,

64
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,752
if you take him, she might show up.

65
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:58,673
I don't know why,
but she's been helping him get away.

66
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,509
If she shows up, please catch her.

67
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:03,720
What? Aren't you coming with us?

68
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:08,599
I wasn't mistaken when I said
she disappeared into thin air.

69
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,476
You really need to be cautious.

70
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:11,935
CHIEF: Okay.

71
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:15,398
I don't know how I'm going
to catch such a person,

72
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:16,733
but I'll try my best.

73
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:20,570
Jeez, he's been locked up in a place
that suits him just perfectly.

74
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:21,863
My goodness.

75
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:25,450
EPISODE 6

76
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:31,998
Get in.

77
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:15,833
The clerk said she paid in cash

78
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:18,086
but seemed to be a little short on cash.

79
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:21,871
SAEHA: Everything from here to here?

80
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:24,300
Yes. But she didn't get them to go.

81
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:27,929
She ate them all by herself here.
I thought that was unusual.

82
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:30,098
- Did she speak Korean?
- Yes.

83
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:33,851
Did she stammer when she spoke?
Or did she look like an alien...

84
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:36,604
I mean, a foreigner fluent in Korean?

85
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,732
She said she didn't seem
like a foreigner at all.

86
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:41,692
Nothing peculiar
about her appearance either.

87
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:45,696
I guess she didn't buy that many
for someone else.

88
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,032
- You mean the convenience store murderer?
- Yes.

89
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:49,836
Without weapons
or the teleportation device,

90
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:51,953
she may be just an ordinary person.

91
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:53,329
She eats like us after all.

92
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:56,040
So we mustn't inflict any injuries on her.

93
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:58,042
She may easily get hurt.

94
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,462
We must catch her alive and intact
no matter what.

95
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:05,299
Could sugar be the energy source
that she uses to teleport?

96
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:08,428
Or maybe she can only break down sugar.

97
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,251
The clerk said she ate
through her mouth and spoke Korean.

98
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:14,559
It may not be as it seems. What if she's
equipped with an automatic translator?

99
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:17,478
Like the universal translator
from <i>Star Trek.</i>

100
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:20,064
Maybe she uses holograms
to change her appearance.

101
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:22,233
It's great that we found out about this.

102
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:25,445
Putting out an APB on her paid off.

103
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:26,904
Sure. Good job, Mr. Song Eojin.

104
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:29,072
Thank you.

105
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:30,825
EMPLOYEE: One moment, please.

106
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,956
Jongyi. Please move over a bit.

107
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:48,926
HEAD OF CONTROL: <i>What did you see?</i>

108
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:54,474
Boy, I hope it'll be helpful.

109
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:58,853
Jeez, I can't wait for this to end.
For God's sake.

110
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:00,354
This is a smoke-free building.

111
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:11,115
I heard you used to work
on the Grid Control Team.

112
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:12,824
Yes.

113
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:15,453
No wonder you're different.

114
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,414
- Me?
- Yes.

115
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,167
Who are you comparing me to?

116
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,377
The Deputy Director.

117
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:26,797
And what was his name?
The one with the Grid failure idea.

118
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:29,550
- Kim Saeha.
- Yeah, him.

119
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:32,678
Jeez, that was such an absurd idea.

120
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,057
He knows nothing about our work,
for God's sake.

121
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,351
He used to work
on the Grid Control Team too.

122
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:42,021
- What?
- Only for six months, though. While...

123
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:44,857
I worked there for four years.

124
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:51,614
Then did he also cause trouble
and get transferred to the Secretariat?

125
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:54,075
I didn't cause trouble.
I only pointed out what was wrong.

126
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:57,745
Oh, yes. I know.
I've briefly heard about it.

127
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:05,127
As you know, there are still many people
on my team who got their jobs

128
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:06,921
through personal connections.

129
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:08,005
So I was thinking

130
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:11,509
it'd help me a lot if there were
a senior officer like you

131
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:16,055
who could keep them under control
in the middle.

132
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:20,643
Jeez, kids these days don't step forward
even if they see a problem.

133
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:22,311
What a shame.

134
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:29,901
So...

135
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:33,906
what did you see
in the Deputy Director's office?

136
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:43,583
The founder of the Grid.

137
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:48,462
Who saw the founder?

138
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,340
So? Is it a person?

139
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:39,972
SAEHA: Shouldn't we prepare for it?

140
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:41,473
Prepare for what?

141
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,601
If we're unarmed, we might lose her.

142
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:46,896
Shouldn't we lower the security level
and bring in weapons?

143
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:48,606
Everyone seems okay to you, right?

144
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:53,402
If the operation drags on,
there will be renegades.

145
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:54,612
Among us.

146
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:58,574
Do we have to worry about that?

147
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:01,327
Shouldn't we worry about that?

148
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:04,955
Joining our enemy. Isn't that
the problem with traitors or renegades?

149
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:07,958
If anyone joins her side,
that'll be good news for us

150
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:10,086
since it'll at least form a link.

151
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,310
I guess you've only seen decent lunatics.

152
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:16,217
Fanatical employees that believe
the Ghost is mankind's savior.

153
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:19,011
Applicants who believed
the Grid was created by cults

154
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:20,805
and wanted to blow up the control room.

155
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:24,350
And executives who got caught
selling inside information

156
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:25,993
about the Ghost to magazine publishers.

157
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:28,521
I've seen all kinds of lunatics
in the past 24 years.

158
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:30,523
Among our team members?

159
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:32,233
Those who made it into the AB?

160
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:36,362
There was a time
when we had more freedom here.

161
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:39,907
They keep information confidential
and run many different teams for a reason.

162
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,536
Humans are always the problem in the end.

163
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:49,583
They're all out.

164
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:11,897
<i>Specialists from all fields
are trying to figure out the reason</i>

165
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:14,233
<i>why the Grid isn't working properly,</i>

166
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:16,944
<i>but there hasn't been
any noticeable progress yet.</i>

167
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:21,741
<i>If they fail to figure out the reason
and fix the problem,</i>

168
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:24,910
<i>the magnetic fields of the Earth
will stop functioning properly.</i>

169
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,625
Ms. Choi. Kim Manok has been arrested.

170
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:35,254
- Where is he?
- His arrest was just on the news.

171
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:36,547
He's at Songje Police Station.

172
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:40,259
Damn it. We have everything set up.
Why now of all times?

173
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:44,388
They should've just kept their mouths
shut about it. What terrible timing!

174
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:47,112
The police announced it immediately
because of all the disturbance.

175
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:48,601
To tell us to stop...

176
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:50,551
MS. CHOI: That issue
was brought up from the start.

177
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:52,021
You've never cared about it,

178
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:53,773
but to cover up for your ex-wife now...

179
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:08,037
The only thing the Ghost has done
this time is help Kim Manok.

180
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,080
And he's been arrested,
so she'll come for him.

181
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:11,457
We must make her come here.

182
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,375
Whether it's for the Grid or Kim Manok,

183
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:14,919
she must come to us.

184
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:16,602
EOJIN: Then I'll go and take care of it.

185
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:18,546
Ms. Choi.

186
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:27,640
Where is she going?

187
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,140
Ms. Choi.

188
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:32,672
Stay out of your wife's business.

189
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:43,614
She's my ex.

190
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,908
Ex-wife!

191
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:35,291
I'm on my way now,
so don't hand him over to her, Captain.

192
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:38,419
She's here.

193
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,420
Gosh.

194
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:54,560
I told you to have him ready for me.

195
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:57,771
- Did you guys catch him?
- Did you?

196
00:14:57,855 --> 00:14:59,273
One of my men did.

197
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:03,027
Isn't a felon always handed over
to the violent crimes unit?

198
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:07,406
Inspector Go Hanseung. Answer me.

199
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:10,242
Is it unreasonable to hand him over
to the branch in charge?

200
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:13,787
Come on. You always barge in like this...

201
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:24,214
We do all the hard work,
and you always take the credit.

202
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,840
Good job.

203
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,761
I can't explain the details,
but we have no time to lose.

204
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:30,054
Bring Kim Manok now.

205
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:34,391
If you delay it any longer,
your hard work may be for nothing.

206
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:38,729
Bring him.

207
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:04,796
Hey.

208
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,199
I was wondering why you weren't here...

209
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:16,684
Hey.

210
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,855
Did you think I'd let you
walk all over me again?

211
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:25,484
- Shoot me.
- No.

212
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:26,902
Shoot. We don't have time.

213
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,405
Both you and I know
that I won't shoot you.

214
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,616
It's no use if you don't shoot me.

215
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,412
We could stay like this for good.
Or I could just kill that guy.

216
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:40,749
- Has he opened his mouth?
- Yes.

217
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:43,711
He admitted to his crime
but denied the rest.

218
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:45,004
Then let's just kill him.

219
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:46,880
Hey, Jung Saebyeok!

220
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:51,713
The woman appeared because of him
in the first place.

221
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:56,265
If he dies, she'll leave.
Then everything will go back to normal.

222
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:09,987
Investigator Jung Saebyeok.

223
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,989
You saw the woman with your own eyes.

224
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:17,119
You can't handle her.
You're just wasting our time.

225
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:20,788
Can the AB, then?

226
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:24,877
Why did you lie and say
that the Grid was broken?

227
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:28,088
Are you waiting for her?

228
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:37,097
You've gathered a lot of information.

229
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:39,349
So?

230
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:41,602
If you're taking him
because you can't trust us,

231
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:45,773
I want to see how reliable
the Administration Bureau is.

232
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:50,194
If you want to see that,
put that gun down.

233
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:53,197
We mustn't waste any more time.

234
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:17,471
Hey, you...

235
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:19,431
Be careful. All right?

236
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:21,516
Ms. Choi.

237
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:25,354
- Are you really taking her with us?
- Stop her if you can.

238
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,329
She associated the breakdown
of the Grid with the woman.

239
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,101
That means she knows
the origin of the Grid.

240
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:55,008
My colleague?

241
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:56,593
SAEBYOEK:
<i>Was it Mr. Kim Saeha's idea?</i>

242
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:57,845
How do you know him?

243
00:18:57,928 --> 00:18:59,930
How would an investigator know that?

244
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,141
I have no idea.

245
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,073
How did you catch him?

246
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,367
I assumed that Kim Manok
would be left at the station.

247
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:21,994
Hmm.

248
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:26,039
When we arrive,
I'll introduce someone to you.

249
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:27,523
I'd like you to teach him a lesson.

250
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,794
Oh, you've already met him.

251
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:34,006
You mean the major?

252
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:40,721
I think the Secretariat would suit you
better than Mido Police Station.

253
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:44,433
Would it be awkward
to work with your ex-husband though?

254
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:47,644
I doubt that's what matters.

255
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:49,688
Do you think Mr. Song feels the same way?

256
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:50,856
I didn't mean that.

257
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,610
It'll be bad if the operation fails,
but what if it succeeds?

258
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,031
Whether or not I suit the Secretariat,
will the AB even still be there?

259
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:00,240
That's what I meant.

260
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:02,951
It seems it was established
to find the woman.

261
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:05,996
But once you find her... what next?

262
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,082
Why are you coming with us?

263
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:15,172
Because of your pride?
To see how we handle it?

264
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:17,299
I know it's neither of them.

265
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:20,886
I'm sure you can't forget her because
you saw her with your own eyes.

266
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:25,390
I only sensed her presence
a very long time ago,

267
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:26,808
but I still remember it vividly.

268
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:29,603
Think about it.

269
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:34,650
If we learn the technology she has,
how much will the world change?

270
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:41,114
How much will it help improve human life
and advance human history?

271
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,867
I'm dying to know.

272
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:47,704
And we can lead that.

273
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:51,041
So we must capture her.

274
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,585
We must find out.

275
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:20,319
Yes?

276
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:23,407
It's quiet here.

277
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:25,574
Pardon?

278
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:29,203
Okay.

279
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:33,582
Sir.

280
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:36,962
The Deputy Director
is bringing two outsiders.

281
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:38,171
Outsiders?

282
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:39,548
One of them is armed,

283
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:42,511
so she wants you to make sure the alarm
doesn't go off when they come in.

284
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:13,574
SECURITY: <i>Alpha, 11th floor.</i>

285
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:17,705
Central hallway, 11th floor.

286
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:31,850
Control room, 9th floor.

287
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:35,622
HEAD OF SECURITY:
<i>In front of the door.</i>

288
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:38,499
AGENT: It's not clear which hand
the teleportation device is in.

289
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:04,006
Where'd she go?

290
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:20,606
SECURITY: <i>Alpha is in.</i>

291
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:41,378
MAJOR: <i>On the count of three,
shoot the nearest arm from you.</i>

292
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:47,092
<i>One.</i>

293
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:52,431
<i>Two.</i>

294
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:57,394
<i>Three.</i>

295
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:07,863
<i>Raise it to Level A.</i>

296
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:11,575
<i>Level A. We've been exposed.</i>

297
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:18,622
Leave your gun here.

298
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:20,615
SAEBYEOK: As a police officer,
I'm supposed...

299
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:21,877
Do you want to leave?

300
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:35,432
- Yes?
- JONGYI: <i>The Ghost.</i>

301
00:24:35,515 --> 00:24:36,795
They're not tranquilizer rounds.

302
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:17,265
Ms. Choi!

303
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:58,598
Ms. Choi...

304
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:18,618
Come on.

305
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:29,712
It's cold.

306
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:38,637
Mr. Jo.

307
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:40,014
Mr. Jo!

308
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,269
She's really dead.

309
00:26:58,325 --> 00:27:01,536
JONGYI: You guys killed her. You...

310
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:07,334
- You fired live ammunition!
- Hey!

311
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:11,254
She was aware
that the Grid hadn't broken down.

312
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:14,341
It was a miracle that she showed up again
in the lobby instead of vanishing.

313
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:15,467
We didn't lose her.

314
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:18,261
A miracle? A person just died.

315
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:21,556
Ms. Choi is your superior.

316
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,267
Are you going to leave her
on the cold floor like this?

317
00:27:25,518 --> 00:27:27,558
Hurry up and call an ambulance.
Call her family too.

318
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:29,856
And take the culprit now.

319
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:31,733
- And Major.
- Yes, sir.

320
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:36,863
Give me your guns, both of you.

321
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,574
- Are you crazy?
- One of them killed Ms. Choi.

322
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:41,117
Give me your guns.

323
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:42,827
They were carrying out an operation.

324
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,456
If a cop kills
an innocent citizen by mistake,

325
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:48,625
will you let it slide like this?

326
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:51,586
Tell me who killed her. Give me the guns!

327
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:55,423
They all use the same guns and bullets.
Can you tell whose bullet shot her?

328
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:59,052
Every bullet and gun gets
a unique scratch when fired.

329
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:01,054
It's distinctive like fingerprints.

330
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:02,889
Don't treat us like idiots.

331
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:06,142
Did you order them
to use live ammunition, Mr. Jo?

332
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:10,897
If you let them leave,
they'll switch their guns around.

333
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,941
Ms. Choi has passed away!

334
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:20,990
Give it to him.

335
00:28:22,158 --> 00:28:23,326
Now.

336
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:25,954
This is an important time for us.
Why did you...

337
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:28,747
Give it.

338
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:38,091
MR. JO: Everyone,
let's sort this out and move.

339
00:28:38,174 --> 00:28:39,174
Let's go.

340
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:41,052
Who's that?

341
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:47,183
I'm a detective from Songje Station.

342
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:49,310
I brought the culprit.

343
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:52,981
Security Manager, escort this detective.

344
00:28:55,316 --> 00:28:56,735
Take the culprit too.

345
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:04,617
- I'm...
- Let's talk later. All right?

346
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:06,703
Not now. Take good care of her.

347
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:10,081
I'll take that.

348
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:16,379
Please follow me.

349
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:09,932
The bullet.

350
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:18,441
Wait. Please open the door.

351
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:57,206
I'm sure she's gone to a better place.

352
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:00,919
Because she was a good person.

353
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:07,133
Well, the minister will be here soon.

354
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:10,970
So I'd better go.

355
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:31,822
- MINISTER: How is it going?
- MR. JO: We're scanning her now.

356
00:33:31,884 --> 00:33:34,220
We got her ready,
so you can see her when you get there.

357
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:38,099
I didn't expect this day would come.

358
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:41,227
Ah! I'm sorry, sir.

359
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:46,441
- Were you at the scene?
- Yes, sir.

360
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:51,029
- You were at the meeting too, right?
- Yes, sir.

361
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:14,969
You're the one who suggested
luring the woman here, right?

362
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:16,679
Yes, Minister.

363
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:22,185
Anyway, the operation was a success
although the sacrifice was great.

364
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:24,604
Don't blame yourselves.

365
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:25,688
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

366
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:29,817
What was the name of the Deputy Director?

367
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:33,112
MR. JO: It was Choi Seonul, sir.

368
00:34:40,828 --> 00:34:41,828
This way.

369
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:47,668
What did she say?
Has she said anything yet?

370
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:50,421
She hasn't yet. But she will soon.

371
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:56,511
Did you feel hopeless
now that Ms. Choi is gone?

372
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:58,596
Are you going to empty
their trash cans too?

373
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,431
Are you even human?

374
00:35:13,569 --> 00:35:15,363
- Thank you, Minister.
- What?

375
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:17,532
What for?

376
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:21,410
If you hadn't given us permission then,
we couldn't have come this far.

377
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:22,494
Don't mention it.

378
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:32,879
This way, sir.

379
00:35:57,446 --> 00:35:58,447
You can see her up close.

380
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:21,489
We found it from a gamma-ray scan.

381
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:26,869
MINISTER: It's a chip.

382
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:30,039
A chip?

383
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:41,592
MR. JO: This is what we presume
the role of the chip is.

384
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:44,762
It seems that the chip

385
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:48,349
transforms nerve signals from her brain
into electronic signals.

386
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:53,396
And this metallic device seems
to transform them into motor signals.

387
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:56,607
However,

388
00:37:57,566 --> 00:37:59,777
what is inside the metallic device

389
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,904
or what functions it has

390
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:04,407
is still a mystery.

391
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:10,662
Hmm.

392
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:41,193
Since the President is waiting,

393
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:44,947
I'll go and brief him on this.

394
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:46,615
Hmm...

395
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:50,786
I think he'll come here in person
within a few days.

396
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:55,708
Don't you think
you should have better results by then?

397
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:58,586
I mean, everything you have now
is just speculation.

398
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:02,089
Yes, sir. We're currently doing
a biopsy as well.

399
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:03,924
Once we get the DNA analysis results,

400
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:06,844
we'll find out
how different she is from people today

401
00:39:06,927 --> 00:39:09,138
and if her direct ancestors
presently exist.

402
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:12,683
We'll figure out those things by tonight.

403
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:16,145
Well, things like those
could be meaningful too.

404
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:22,193
But what really matters
is the teleportation device.

405
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:42,213
SAEHA: <i>No.</i>

406
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:07,488
You have a lot of work to do.
There's no need to come down.

407
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:10,324
Let's keep up the good work
and proudly make good results.

408
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:11,534
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

409
00:40:16,872 --> 00:40:17,915
Go see him out.

410
00:40:22,002 --> 00:40:23,002
All right.

411
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:25,297
I'm running out of time,

412
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:29,427
so I want you to handle trifling matters
quickly on your own. Okay?

413
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:32,263
Major, find out as much as you can
about the murderer.

414
00:40:32,346 --> 00:40:34,849
- His relationship with the woman and such.
- Yes, sir.

415
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:36,600
And... Hold on.

416
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:41,147
Oh, right. There's the detective too.
Who on Earth brought her here?

417
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:44,775
At a crucial time like this.
Talk to her nicely and send her away.

418
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:46,235
- Yes, sir.
- Oh, by the way,

419
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:48,279
which one of you is the superior?

420
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:49,238
I am, sir.

421
00:40:49,321 --> 00:40:51,949
Then you take care of
the Secretariat for the time being.

422
00:40:52,032 --> 00:40:53,409
All right? Now,

423
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:56,162
hurry up and move. Go.

424
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:58,038
Yes, sir. Come.

425
00:41:00,082 --> 00:41:03,210
What are you doing?
Go and send the detective away. All right?

426
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:04,170
Wait, you!

427
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:05,253
The senior!

428
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,882
Yes, you. Come here.

429
00:41:39,538 --> 00:41:40,538
Me?

430
00:42:58,659 --> 00:42:59,659
What's your name?

431
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:01,412
Where are you from?

432
00:43:01,495 --> 00:43:02,538
MR. JO: No, not that!

433
00:43:03,622 --> 00:43:05,499
Ask her what the mechanism is.

434
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:08,419
Entropic recursion?
The quantum Hall effect?

435
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:14,108
What's the mechanism for teleportation?

436
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:17,553
What technology do you use?

437
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:19,847
Did you succeed in building
the Grid at one go?

438
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:25,853
Answer me! How did you come here?

439
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:34,737
One more. Give her another shot.

440
00:43:36,905 --> 00:43:37,905
Hurry.

441
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:16,820
When were you born? In what year?

442
00:44:17,404 --> 00:44:19,657
Two thousand...

443
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:25,412
Ninety-one.

444
00:44:27,289 --> 00:44:28,332
The year 2091?

445
00:44:28,415 --> 00:44:29,583
The year 2091?

446
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:32,920
How? What did you ride to come here?

447
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:34,630
How did you travel back in time?

448
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:36,256
No.

449
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,300
No...

450
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:41,929
Time...

451
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,475
doesn't flow.

452
00:44:58,237 --> 00:44:59,780
Why did you come here?

453
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:32,479
If it weren't for me,

454
00:45:33,647 --> 00:45:35,607
she wouldn't have been shot dead.

455
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:37,901
I'm to blame too.

456
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:41,196
I was ordered to lower the security level

457
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:43,824
for a few weapons
to be brought into the building.

458
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:46,410
Who ordered you to lower it?

459
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:49,788
The Director did.

460
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:54,251
Then...

461
00:45:55,294 --> 00:45:56,294
this happened.

462
00:45:58,464 --> 00:46:01,300
Long ago, someone died
right before my eyes.

463
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:05,137
The same thing happened again
because of me...

464
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:17,524
I shouldn't have let them in.

465
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:20,486
You mean the weapon?

466
00:46:21,904 --> 00:46:22,946
Or the child?

467
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:32,372
Do you know about... that incident?

468
00:46:39,171 --> 00:46:40,422
If I had

469
00:46:41,006 --> 00:46:43,175
kept saying no to the end,

470
00:46:43,926 --> 00:46:48,096
he might have gone back home
holding the child's hand.

471
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:51,433
I still think about that.

472
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:00,484
Can I just turn this off?

473
00:47:00,567 --> 00:47:02,069
No, let me.

474
00:47:06,198 --> 00:47:07,198
Let's go.

475
00:47:10,869 --> 00:47:12,149
You need to give me my gun back.

476
00:47:12,704 --> 00:47:13,956
How about you head out first

477
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:16,166
and I give it to you
outside the security gate?

478
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:18,251
Sure.

479
00:47:23,757 --> 00:47:26,051
My car is 6238.
You saw it earlier, right?

480
00:47:26,468 --> 00:47:27,845
It's fine. I'll get a cab.

481
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:42,568
Don't do it.

482
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:48,031
They even killed their deputy director.

483
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:49,700
Do you think you'll be safe?

484
00:47:52,411 --> 00:47:54,246
Whatever you're planning on, don't do it.

485
00:47:56,331 --> 00:47:59,126
Even I can see
that you're up to something.

486
00:48:00,002 --> 00:48:01,628
Do you think they won't notice?

487
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:10,929
I know how you feel,
but something bad could happen to you.

488
00:48:11,013 --> 00:48:12,681
How do you know how I feel?

489
00:48:13,265 --> 00:48:14,683
It's because of your dad.

490
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:18,520
The child in that video.

491
00:48:18,604 --> 00:48:19,938
It's you.

492
00:48:20,022 --> 00:48:21,231
It isn't.

493
00:48:23,275 --> 00:48:25,360
The person who died that day
was your father!

494
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:31,074
Don't do it.

495
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:36,705
What do I do then?

496
00:48:38,665 --> 00:48:40,125
Should I just let them break it?

497
00:48:40,709 --> 00:48:42,794
Should I let them break it into pieces?

498
00:48:45,672 --> 00:48:46,673
Break what...

499
00:48:49,509 --> 00:48:51,261
They're breaking that metallic thing?

500
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:55,098
With it, I can do anything.

501
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:57,643
I can bring everyone back to life.

502
00:48:58,226 --> 00:48:59,645
Ms. Choi, my father,

503
00:49:02,147 --> 00:49:03,440
and even my mom.

504
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:08,362
You have no idea what it's taken me

505
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:10,781
to come this far.

506
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:37,474
I'll get going.

507
00:49:49,528 --> 00:49:51,446
SECURITY: I think you got a text message.

508
00:50:04,584 --> 00:50:06,962
3 UNREAD MESSAGES

509
00:50:18,557 --> 00:50:19,557
No.

510
00:50:46,334 --> 00:50:47,334
Mother.

511
00:51:13,945 --> 00:51:14,945
Please.

512
00:51:15,697 --> 00:51:16,697
Please.

513
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:19,909
Please.
