EPISODE 4

2
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:04,856
Sir. A minute ago, the director asked me
to tell you to report on the progress.

3
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:09,486
Get all the CCTV footage
from the subway station.

4
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:15,909
Is it even traceable?

5
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:21,206
We can't do anything as a recon unit
if the target is not traceable.

6
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:24,541
What are you?

7
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:26,753
A soldier, sir.

8
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,882
You're a soldier
who makes the impossible possible.

9
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:32,565
Don't think about whether it's possible.

10
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:40,266
Hello, sir.

11
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:42,435
I'm sorry, sir. He got away.

12
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:45,730
Alpha didn't even show up.
There was no sign of the accomplice.

13
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:50,151
I think we should check the validity
of the police report again.

14
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:52,112
<i>Agent down.</i>

15
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:55,740
The Secretariat may have selected
intel not very reliable

16
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:58,743
and given it to us without verifying it.

17
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:01,412
<i>Agent down
in the Beta surveillance area.</i>

18
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:03,998
Major, one of our agents is down.

19
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:05,959
Report the details.

20
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:08,169
<i>We lost communication,</i>

21
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:10,463
<i>so we went to check Coast C
and found him down.</i>

22
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:12,757
What was the weapon? How's the agent?

23
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:14,968
<i>He's unconscious.
And we're figuring it out,</i>

24
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:16,511
<i>but it's neither a knife nor a gun.</i>

25
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:18,805
The agent is unconscious.

26
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:23,852
Forgive me for interrupting, sir.

27
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:27,689
But one of our agents has been injured.

28
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:29,731
I apologize.

29
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,485
We don't know yet.

30
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:35,822
STRONG TEETH DENTIST
RUSTIC HANDMADE KALGUKSU

31
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:47,500
RUSTIC HANDMADE KALGUKSU

32
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:55,257
Darn it.

33
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:57,135
Let me go.

34
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,309
It's the restaurant owner, right?

35
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:05,768
Leave.

36
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:11,316
I'm her daughter.

37
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:12,609
- What?
- What?

38
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:14,067
Daughter?

39
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,321
I came after getting a call from her.

40
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:24,746
Let go of me. Who are you
to stop me from seeing my mom?

41
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:27,290
Her daughter happens
to be a police officer?

42
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,878
You should've removed the police mark
from your car first.

43
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:39,260
Yes, I am a police officer.

44
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:43,223
I came after getting a call
from the victim. Anything wrong with that?

45
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:47,143
Let go.

46
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,104
Let go of me!

47
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:53,149
Jeez, why are the cops
fighting among themselves?

48
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,818
They don't cooperate with each other.

49
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:58,071
That's why they failed

50
00:03:58,154 --> 00:04:00,907
to protect one old lady
with all these officers.

51
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:02,867
Goodness.

52
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:22,135
Get out.

53
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:31,020
Just tell me one thing.

54
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,730
What happened to the restaurant owner?

55
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:34,148
Is she hurt badly?

56
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:38,987
I'm not trying to meddle.

57
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,781
It's just that I saw the lady
right before this happened.

58
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,033
I even had a meal there.

59
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:46,160
I also had a meal there today.

60
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:47,453
You must understand me then.

61
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:49,455
What happened to her?

62
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:52,666
Kim Manok.

63
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:55,378
He came here, right?

64
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:08,766
How did you know?

65
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:10,643
I got a call.

66
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:13,771
- From whom?
- The owner.

67
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:16,606
About what?

68
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:20,903
Ask her yourself, dude.

69
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:25,616
How dare you call me "dude"?

70
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,452
How dare I?

71
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:31,205
You talked down to me when we first met,
so I thought we were the same age.

72
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:35,835
Well, you do look too old
for a guy my age.

73
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:39,297
I'm sure you heard
the police are off this case.

74
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,840
I did.

75
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,384
But...

76
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:49,807
now that I've seen how you failed to
protect an old lady with all those agents,

77
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:51,726
I don't think we should stay out of it.

78
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:54,312
You think you'll make any difference?

79
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:57,940
The suspect must be a big fish
seeing how the government is involved.

80
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:01,277
What's his deal?

81
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,320
Did you just scoff?

82
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:07,075
There must be something else.

83
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,577
Major.

84
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:22,632
Who is she?

85
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:24,342
She's a police officer.

86
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:26,010
From Songje Station?

87
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,971
Investigator Jung Saebyeok?

88
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:33,101
Then you should've told us in advance

89
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:36,312
to keep the guns at point
whether or not Beta gets away.

90
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:40,691
You're the one who said if we kept
an eye on Beta, Alpha would show up.

91
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:43,694
That's why our agents chased Beta.
Is that our fault?

92
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:44,778
Where's the murderer?

93
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:48,741
As you've heard, we're searching for him.

94
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,284
Why are you still searching?

95
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:52,537
You trusted my intel so much
that you chased him

96
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,747
without noticing your agent was attacked.

97
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:57,333
Then shouldn't you
have caught the suspect already?

98
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,085
What about that detective then?

99
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:01,087
You must've done
a terrible job taking over,

100
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,339
seeing how she interfered as she pleased.

101
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:06,384
- Didn't you bring her here?
- Why would I...

102
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:10,805
Why would I do such a thing?

103
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:14,225
I heard you told the director to check
the validity of the police report again.

104
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:17,937
That the Secretariat gave you
unreliable intel in the first place.

105
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,730
Didn't you bring her here to confirm that?

106
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:25,361
Our special agent was fully armed,
and someone caught him off guard.

107
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:30,324
No one could do it except Alpha.
The intel you gave us wasn't wrong.

108
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:34,912
The intel we gave you was accurate.

109
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,331
Even before your agent was attacked.

110
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:39,834
Hand the detective over to us.

111
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:41,835
Yes, ma'am.

112
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:32,780
Investigator Jung Saebyeok.

113
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:35,950
You said you got a call
from the restaurant owner.

114
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:38,494
But why did she call you?

115
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,496
When did you give her your contact number?

116
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:44,320
Have you ever interfered in the case
other than this time?

117
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,127
Since you were ordered to stay out of it.

118
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:51,507
Answer the question.

119
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,760
What happened to the old lady?

120
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,096
Investigator Jung Saebyeok.

121
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:59,140
She said she thought
the murderer was back.

122
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:01,851
And it took 15 minutes at most
for me to get there.

123
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:03,394
When I arrived,

124
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:06,188
there were already
a swarm of the so-called police officers.

125
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:09,066
And an ambulance carrying a person
left as soon as I arrived.

126
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:12,945
It wouldn't have been possible
if they hadn't been staking out the place.

127
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,450
With so many agents staking out,

128
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:19,785
what did they do
until a civilian was attacked?

129
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,667
Was there a second murder?

130
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:37,678
You used her as bait, didn't you?

131
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:41,932
They weren't there to catch the murderer.
It was to catch the woman, right?

132
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:54,904
You people said you'd catch him.

133
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:58,824
What kind of investigation is this?

134
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:01,535
Investigator.

135
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:05,915
Tell us everything you and
the restaurant owner said over the phone.

136
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:13,881
I'll take your place now.

137
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:44,912
- Investigator.
- It may be difficult for you

138
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:48,290
to accept, but we're not obliged
to give you a convincing explanation.

139
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,918
I'm not obliged to report to you either.

140
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:52,586
All we can say is that,

141
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,630
if you keep acting
independently like this,

142
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,007
you'll be removed from your duties.

143
00:11:57,091 --> 00:12:01,429
Make sure to warn her that
she'll be jobless if she runs wild again.

144
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:03,389
From all your duties, I mean.

145
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:17,820
<i>Why didn't you tell me?</i>

146
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:23,117
That Investigator Jung Saebyeok
is your ex-wife. Why?

147
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:34,962
Is that a problem?

148
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:37,465
What do you think, Mr. Song Eojin?

149
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:40,009
A detective who was brought in for spying

150
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:42,344
is a family member
of one of our employees.

151
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:44,805
What do you think?

152
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:46,432
Will that be a problem or not?

153
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:48,851
She was. Not anymore.

154
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:53,105
And we split up many years ago.

155
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,777
- Have you been in touch with her?
- No.

156
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:00,905
Why didn't you say anything
when you went to the NFS to get her?

157
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:04,658
Because it was just a personal matter.

158
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:13,793
I had no other intentions, ma'am.

159
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:20,966
Stay out of this from now on.

160
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:24,303
Though we won't be dealing
with it anymore anyway.

161
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,263
What do you mean?

162
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:28,808
I'm telling you to get back to work.

163
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:33,270
Or do you not want to do any work
that's not about your ex-wife?

164
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,290
Make a right turn.

165
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:13,435
<i>She just left.</i>

166
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:35,165
Saebyeok!

167
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,800
Jung Saebyeok.

168
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:06,488
CONVENIENCE STORE, SECOND MURDER

169
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:21,003
Darn it.

170
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:30,638
<i>Stay out of this from now on.</i>

171
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:34,433
<i>Though we won't be dealing
with it anymore anyway.</i>

172
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:49,782
"Two people have been injured..."

173
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:53,077
"How long do you think
the press will keep quiet..."

174
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:07,299
Gosh, my neck is so sore.

175
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:09,927
Can you still see her?

176
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:13,222
Yes.

177
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:19,894
When was that?

178
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:23,857
7:28 p.m.? What station?

179
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:26,567
Okay.

180
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:27,860
Got it.

181
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:37,830
So?

182
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:39,665
Did the Ghost appear again?

183
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:43,043
How did you know that, Ms. Chae?

184
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:45,295
- That I...
- Does it matter? Just tell me.

185
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:48,132
It seems so.

186
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,634
I wish she'd shown up in front of me.

187
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:53,470
I desperately want to see her
at least once.

188
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:57,433
Ms. Chae. This isn't some kind of a game
or virtual reality.

189
00:16:57,516 --> 00:17:00,310
You'll get hurt if you think that way.
You know how dangerous she is?

190
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:02,229
How dangerous is she? Do you know?

191
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:05,065
Ms. Choi just said people got hurt.

192
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:07,192
Two people.

193
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:09,945
Don't you get it?

194
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,739
With the murderer, she...

195
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:15,409
Where's Mr. Song?

196
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,079
Oh, he said he missed breakfast
coming in early today.

197
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,000
Did you eat?

198
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:30,924
I'm sorry. My blood sugar level
drops if I skip a meal.

199
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:35,512
Kim Manok, the murder suspect,

200
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:39,141
got on a northbound train
that left Songje Station at 7:28 p.m.

201
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:43,520
<i>The tracking devices attached to his stuff
were found on the floor of that train.</i>

202
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:46,065
<i>We don't know where he got off
or where he went.</i>

203
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:49,151
Check the CCTV footage
of every metropolitan subway station.

204
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:52,362
And have the control center and run
a face-recognition program at every gate.

205
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:56,700
The special team will check the CCTV
footage too, so let's find him first.

206
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:57,824
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

207
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:24,728
<i>It seems that
the old lady is only injured.</i>

208
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:27,481
<i>What time did you see
the ambulance at the scene?</i>

209
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:33,654
Please stop here.

Jeez. How could
something like this happen?

212
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:02,766
Wait a minute.
I've seen you somewhere.

213
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:06,854
Oh, you're the one who lied
about being the old lady's daughter.

214
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:09,940
I guess you can still see
with those tiny eyes.

215
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:12,484
If I can't see them,
they're not eyes but just holes.

216
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:15,362
Two people were stretchered off
from this narrow street.

217
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:17,447
And this young lady was dragged away.

218
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:20,117
Even a blind person would've seen that.

219
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:22,828
Two? Two people were stretchered off?

220
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:25,372
So how's the old lady?

221
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:28,000
Fortunately, she just got some stitches.

222
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:30,919
Were they both carried
out of this building?

223
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:34,423
- Yes.
- No, they weren't.

224
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:36,758
The one carried out of here was the lady.

225
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:39,553
The other one was carried from back there.

226
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:42,472
- Were they?
- How could you not remember?

227
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:43,849
That barbecue place.

228
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:49,104
The cops went up and down the stairs
the whole time.

229
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:52,649
They thought the staircase would crumble.

230
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:56,236
Was someone carried on a stretcher
from behind the building too?

231
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:59,364
- Did you see a person on it?
- No, I didn't.

232
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:01,365
Did you?

233
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,493
No, I didn't see a person.

234
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:12,211
Then who got hurt
other than the restaurant lady?

235
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,630
Does that person live in this alley?

236
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:17,925
What the hell? Do you hope that
it was someone from this neighborhood?

237
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:20,510
- Where did the ambulances go?
- Where else?

238
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:21,637
A hospital, of course.

239
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,805
Which hospitals? Which way did they go?

240
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,391
Well, I think they both went this way.

241
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:27,976
What are you talking about?

242
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:29,686
They all went in different directions.

243
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:31,355
This way.

244
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,066
And that way. They split up
and went in different directions.

245
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:36,401
Jeez.

246
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:58,465
Have you ever seen a ghost
get caught on CCTV?

247
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:04,263
Jeez, this is no different
from physical labor.

248
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:06,546
Company work is supposed
to be repetitive and laborious.

249
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:11,019
We'll be doing this for another 20 years.

Hey.

Look at this.

00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,222

00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:53,713
Are you not feeling well?

270
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:56,466
I thought I saw you here yesterday too.

271

Never mind.

272
00:28:56,317 --> 00:28:57,317
What was that?

273
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:22,093
Yes, around 7:40 p.m. last night.

274
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,893
Okay. Saint Family Hospital

275
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:31,853
Okay. Thank you.

276
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:42,280

<i>All we can say is that,</i>

284
00:30:00,381 --> 00:30:02,425
if you keep acting
independently like this,

285
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:04,594
you'll be removed from your duties.

286
00:30:04,677 --> 00:30:06,095
From all your duties, I mean.

287
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:10,183
Criminals keep dumping evidence
into the sea,

288
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:12,685
so they want to expand
their underwater forensic team.

289
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:14,437
Who gave the order?

290
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:17,273
What does it matter?
What can you do about it?

291
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:20,317
Those bastards.

292
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,778
Which bastards?

293
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:23,321
Don't make it worse.

294
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,282
I don't know what's going on,

295
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:29,661
but I've never seen anyone getting away
with posting online complaints.

296
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:32,831
It'll only work against you.

297
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,017

298
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:54,936

299
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:58,064
I've always put it off.

300
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:00,650
I'll take some time off.

301
00:31:02,485 --> 00:31:03,485
Sure.

302
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:05,405
You need time to pack.

303
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:08,782
I do.

304
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:26,634
Hey. Why are you taking those?

305
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:30,346
I bought these with my money.
I've been buying them all this time.

306
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:33,099
You didn't know, did you?

307
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:40,148
Who's going to refill them now?

308
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:43,401
I'm not saying my team
must take the lead in everything.

309
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:46,487
If you at least share and discuss with us
how the special agent was injured

310
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:48,656
and what the situation was,

311
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,784
<i>we wouldn't be having trouble
working together like now.</i>

312
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:53,703
<i>The special team at the scene, us here,</i>

313
00:31:53,786 --> 00:31:56,080
and Grid Control Team.
We're all fighting separately.

314
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:59,208
<i>What we do for confidentiality
makes everything inefficient.</i>

315
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:02,837
Can't you see the special team is
hardly living up to its name?

316
00:32:03,212 --> 00:32:04,672
It's how it's always been.

317
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:08,968
- And you've been doing well so far...
- That's because nothing big happened.

318
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:10,692
As the Director, you should be different.

319
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,181
The Ghost started to appear
while you were in that position.

320
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:14,599
Aren't you going to catch her?

321
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:18,645
Isn't it because
you want to see to the end of it

322
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:20,104
while still in your position?

323
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:23,107
We must see it end. We've been
waiting for this chance for decades.

324
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:26,235
That's right.
I can't criticize you for that.

325
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:32,075
We both have questions to ask her
when we meet her in person.

326
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:33,785
And you'll find out

327
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:35,912
<i>if she's caught. To do so, first...</i>

328
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:38,247
We never know when lunatics will pop up,

329
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:40,667
so security is paramount.

330
00:32:41,876 --> 00:32:45,213
Weren't you the one who said this to me
when I was appointed as director?

331
00:32:46,005 --> 00:32:48,883
If there's a lunatic, we'll catch him too.

332
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:50,802
I see.

333
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:57,600
If I meet the founder of the Grid?

334
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:01,437
Then I've got to ask this question.

335
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:05,942
<i>"How is time travel possible?"</i>

336
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:09,278
"What's the future of mankind?" And...

337
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:11,279
And?

338
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:15,076
"Why did she have to kill the janitor?"

339
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:16,661
What was the point?

340
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:19,037
Right.

341
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:20,957
That's exactly...

342
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:27,046
Let's think it over.

343
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:31,175
I know you're doing this because you
have as many questions as I do.

344
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:34,220
Please think it over.

345
00:33:40,893 --> 00:33:41,893
Why?

346
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:45,815
A researcher could've served useful.

347
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:47,774
But why...

348
00:33:55,324 --> 00:33:56,492
Hello?

349
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:57,952
Is anyone there?

350
00:33:58,119 --> 00:33:59,203
Hello?

351
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:01,748
Are you okay?

352
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:03,791
Are you hurt?

353
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,752
They must be here.

354
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:13,426
You saw it, right?

355
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:20,099
Can you tell me what happened to your dad?

356
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:52,381
<i>His name was...</i>

357
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:54,175
Lee...

358
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:57,470
It was Lee something.

359
00:34:58,846 --> 00:35:00,014
Gosh.

360
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,683
Even if you're a police officer,

361
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:05,561
I'm not allowed to talk
about patients' conditions.

362
00:35:06,979 --> 00:35:10,691
He's involved in the case.
We need to know how he is...

363
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:12,110
I know what you mean.

364
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:16,030
But his guardian specifically told us
not to tell anyone about him.

365
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:17,448
What guardian?

366
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:19,241
His family?

367
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:20,910
Or the Administration Bureau?

368
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:25,873
I guess it is.

369
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:30,253
It's the AB who told you
not to tell anyone about him, right?

370
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,967
I told you to stop doing this.

371
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:44,600
- It's fine. I'll take care of this.
- Okay.

372
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:49,689
I told you he already left the hospital.
Stop bugging the doctor.

373
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:57,154
I'm sorry.

374
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:03,369
Did you hear that
from the information desk downstairs?

375
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:07,206
Could it be true?

376
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,670
Why did you come here?
I thought you'd go to another hospital.

377
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:16,424
- I already did.
- Did you see the restaurant owner?

378
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:18,384
What did she say?

379
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:22,805
She was so traumatized,
I'm going to ask her again later.

380
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:28,185
Wait a minute.

381
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:31,772
The one hospitalized here
is one of your soldiers, right?

382
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:33,608
One of those who staked out there.

383
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:35,943
I don't know either. I'll go find out.

384
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:49,207
Even without your request,
we never disclose our patient information.

385
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:50,416
I'm relieved.

386
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:53,336
Some people just tell everything
even with our request.

387
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:54,754
At another hospital, though.

388
00:36:58,216 --> 00:36:59,675
By any chance, our soldier...

389
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:01,886
No, I mean our patient.

390
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:04,096
Do you have any idea
what he was attacked with?

391
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:08,184
No. It's something you should find out.

392
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:11,561
That's right.

393
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:14,482
But this case is quite...

394
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:18,694
<i>I've never seen such a corpse before.</i>

395
00:37:19,528 --> 00:37:23,199
<i>His organs seemed as if
they were damaged by something electrical.</i>

396
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:24,784
Doesn't it seem...

397
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:28,704
as if he was electrocuted?

398
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,251
And his organs have been damaged?

399
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:37,004
How did you know?

400
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:43,302
One of my team members said he heard it
from a doctor here. Aren't you the doctor?

401
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:44,595
Yes, I am.

402
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:46,596
Uh...

403
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:51,644
Well... It does seem that
he was exposed to excessive heat.

404
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:53,813
But I have no idea how.

405
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:31,892
It's one of the special agents
who was injured.

406
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:33,227
And he was already discharged.

407
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:36,981
- I guess he isn't seriously injured.
- He was slightly burned.

408
00:38:37,898 --> 00:38:40,151
- The back of his neck?
- Yes.

409
00:38:42,778 --> 00:38:44,947
Someone who can burn
a special agent's neck?

410
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:47,241
It must've been her.

411
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:52,747
Then they lost her.

412
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:02,673
Why is it only a slight burn?

413
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:06,635
She burned someone to death 24 years ago.

414
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:12,308
Shouldn't the question be the other way?

415
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:15,311
She could've burned him slightly.

416
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:18,314
But why did she go all the way back then?

417
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,192
Maybe she's sick of the smell now.

418
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:24,771
By the way,
how did you find out it was this hospital?

419
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:27,031
I asked emergency services.

420
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:32,203
I asked them
where the ambulance went from that alley.

421
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:34,914
You found that out
with a single phone call?

422
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:37,249
Isn't that how you found out, too?

423
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:40,294
Well, kind of.

424
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:53,682
When did you find out
that two people were attacked?

425
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:58,354
While I was at work.

426
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:03,317
But I couldn't tell
outsiders about it, so...

427
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:08,739
I wasn't blaming you
for not sharing the information.

428
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:14,662
You told me how the old lady was
when you didn't have to.

429
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:20,459
What about you? How did you find out
that there were two injured people?

430
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:23,963
I went to the scene this morning
and heard about it.

431
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:25,798
You went there again?

432
00:40:28,217 --> 00:40:31,303
You'll be punished
if you keep on doing that. Seriously.

433
00:40:38,727 --> 00:40:41,439
Was I supposed to leave this there?
Shouldn't I have gone to get it?

434
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:47,653
You should go back.
Your lunch break must've already ended.

435
00:40:58,497 --> 00:40:59,665
Kim Manok

436
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:03,127
appeared at a subway station last night,

437
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:06,464
though he disappeared again somewhere
between Songje Station and Gudong Station

438
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:07,547
around 7:30 p.m.

439
00:41:09,341 --> 00:41:11,010
Did anyone see him disappear?

440
00:41:11,093 --> 00:41:13,053
So far, you are the only one

441
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:15,556
who's witnessed that moment.

442
00:41:24,106 --> 00:41:25,357
Right.

443
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:28,652
Why is that?

444
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,467
<i>So your name was Lee Siwon.</i>

445
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:54,803
<i>Are you dead?</i>

446
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:57,681
<i>He's been declared dead.</i>

447
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:03,061
Let's see.

448
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:04,759
The person you're looking for...

449
00:42:06,398 --> 00:42:07,900
he's been declared dead.

450
00:42:08,817 --> 00:42:13,322
No, not the one who died in 1997.
I'm looking for his son.

451
00:42:13,405 --> 00:42:19,495
Yes, the one who died in 1997 is
Mr. Lee Janghyeok, the father.

452
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:23,791
And Mr. Lee Siwon, the son,
also died in 2015.

453
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:25,417
NAME: LEE SIWON
STATUS: DECEASED

454
00:42:26,418 --> 00:42:28,128
He wasn't his biological son.

455
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:29,963
Who?

456
00:42:38,764 --> 00:42:43,435
<i>Mr. Lee Janghyeok adopted Mr. Lee Siwon
in 1992 when he was one year old.</i>

457
00:42:56,574 --> 00:43:01,579
<i>And Mr. Lee Janghyeok
died on May 18, 1997.</i>

458
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:05,165
But his adopted son also died in 2015?

459
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:07,418
He could have died before that.

460
00:43:08,043 --> 00:43:11,255
The authority reported him dead.

461
00:43:11,964 --> 00:43:15,259
It seems it's because
they couldn't reach him

462
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:18,053
when he reached the age
to enter the military.

463
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:22,099
They do that when the person's place
of residence is not registered.

464
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:24,602
If that was the case,

465
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:27,521
you don't know whether he is dead or not.
He was just reported dead.

466
00:43:28,897 --> 00:43:30,274
That's possible too.

467
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:35,487
Why don't you look for his mother?

468
00:43:36,655 --> 00:43:40,159
She's his stepmother,
but it says she's still alive.

469
00:43:45,497 --> 00:43:49,752
<i>He said he'd starve all day at home
since there was no one to look after him.</i>

470
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:55,299
<i>Mr. Lee practically begged me
to let him in, so...</i>

471
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:58,636
An adopted child
who had no one to look after him.

472
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:01,889
All biological parents are dead.

473
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:04,850
What could have happened to him?

Hello.

479
00:45:25,347 --> 00:45:26,427
<i>Detective. Later tonight...</i>

480
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:31,520
<i>Where are you?</i>

481
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:33,731
I am...

482
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:36,567
By the way, what's up?

483
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:38,694
Can I talk to you later tonight?

484
00:45:38,777 --> 00:45:39,945
<i>If you have time.</i>

485
00:45:40,446 --> 00:45:41,947
I have a lot of time now.

486
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:44,074
Okay.

487
00:45:45,117 --> 00:45:46,160
Bye.

488
00:45:50,664 --> 00:45:52,332
<i>Maybe she's sick of the smell now.</i>

489
00:45:53,459 --> 00:45:54,585
What smell?

490
00:45:54,668 --> 00:45:56,253
The smell of burning flesh.

491
00:45:57,296 --> 00:46:00,340
All the information about her is
on the 13th floor of my office building.

492
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:02,259
You just need to help me get in there.

493
00:46:02,342 --> 00:46:03,802
You can kill me later.

494
00:46:05,637 --> 00:46:06,805
<i>You can shoot me.</i>

495
00:46:07,473 --> 00:46:08,682

Oh, you can't.

500
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:36,083
Then...

00:46:37,336 --> 00:46:38,462

00:48:22,107 --> 00:48:23,107
What?

511
00:48:24,276 --> 00:48:26,862
You saw her. The woman we're looking for.

512
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:29,948
You saw her vanish.

513
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:34,661
That's what you're curious about.

514
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:41,919
I thought you might have turned this place
upside down.

515
00:48:43,378 --> 00:48:45,058
You must've learned
to control your temper.

516
00:48:45,797 --> 00:48:47,915
Are you here to tell me
I used to have a nasty temper?

517
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:49,384
No, what I mean is...

518
00:48:57,809 --> 00:48:59,728
Are you going to
the place you're assigned to?

519
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:03,438
What's the point of
turning this place upside down?

520
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:05,791
The heart of the problem lies elsewhere.

521
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:22,042
We like working in the provinces.

522
00:49:23,335 --> 00:49:26,630
They're planning to expand
their underwater forensic team.

00:49:27,547 --> 00:49:30,717
If I go become an expert,
I can go abroad for training too.

00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:38,183
<i>Something came up,
so I can't make it. I'm sorry.</i>

525

My transfer isn't so bad.

526
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,192
You must've already made up your mind.

527
00:49:48,777 --> 00:49:50,362
If you say so, fine.

528
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:53,031
What about you?

529
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:55,158
Why are you working there?

530
00:49:55,242 --> 00:49:56,702
I've always been working at the AB.

531
00:49:56,785 --> 00:49:57,828
No, I mean your team.

532
00:49:58,412 --> 00:50:01,331
You were glad about being
assigned to the Grid Control Team.

533
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:04,668
So why...

534
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:09,339
did you move to the current team?

535
00:50:10,298 --> 00:50:11,299
Well...

536
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:13,844
It just happened.

537
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:18,348
- I'm not here to...
- To talk about yourself?

538
00:50:19,558 --> 00:50:20,934
Why are you here then?

539
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:23,979
You don't say anything about yourself.

540
00:50:24,062 --> 00:50:25,814
And you get annoyed when I ask.

541
00:50:26,565 --> 00:50:29,484
Forget it. I don't need your advice.

542
00:50:29,568 --> 00:50:31,194
I'm not here to give you advice.

543
00:50:31,278 --> 00:50:32,821
I'm in no position to.

544
00:50:32,904 --> 00:50:34,698
- I'm the one who...
- The one who what?

545
00:50:40,245 --> 00:50:41,538
Forget it.

546
00:50:48,503 --> 00:50:49,755
If it were the old days,

547
00:50:50,255 --> 00:50:52,340
I would've asked you what

548
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:55,093
when you talked like that.

549
00:50:56,678 --> 00:50:59,765
Because I'd be worried if you were okay.

550
00:51:03,518 --> 00:51:05,353
Then you would frown and say,

551
00:51:05,437 --> 00:51:09,483
"It's nothing, so don't worry."
And you'd go into your room.

552
00:51:13,153 --> 00:51:14,404
I won't ask anymore.

553
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:22,913
Why didn't you just leave things be?

554
00:51:24,873 --> 00:51:26,193
Then this wouldn't have happened.

555
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:33,799
I decided to leave you be,
but I can't do that with my job.

556
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:48,939
JUNG SAEBYEOK
DELETE CONTACT

557
00:52:10,502 --> 00:52:11,545
Excuse me.

558
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:22,347
Are you from the nursing service?

559
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:28,103
Was everything okay?

560
00:52:29,104 --> 00:52:31,898
Yes. You're home earlier than I expected.

561
00:52:33,066 --> 00:52:34,359
Yes, a little.

562
00:52:36,736 --> 00:52:38,405
Thank you. You may leave.

563
00:52:50,625 --> 00:52:51,625
Goodbye.
