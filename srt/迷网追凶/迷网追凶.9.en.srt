1
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,340
Oh, my.

2
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:51,342
A girl came over.

3
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:56,890
I see that your mother is safe.

4
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:01,728
How did you know my place?

5
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:05,398
I came here the other day.
When we watched the video of Doctor Kwon.

6
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:08,526
Do you know my father?

7
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:11,237
Mr. Kwon Saeha.

8
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:15,492
<i>There's no one in this country
who doesn't know your father.</i>

9
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:19,454
<i>Doctor Kwon Sukeun
is the most important figure</i>

10
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:22,123
<i>in Korean history after Admiral Yi Sunsin
and Sejong the Great.</i>

11
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:25,710
<i>"A Korean scientist
did research on the Grid</i>

12
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:27,587
<i>until he collapsed from overwork.</i>

13
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:30,465
<i>He couldn't see it through to the end</i>

14
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:32,801
<i>but saved the world after his death."</i>

15
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:39,140
<i>That's why I was so shocked
when I saw the footage,</i>

16
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:42,268
<i>when I learned
that one of the greatest men in history</i>

17
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:44,562
<i>was actually an accomplice to murder.</i>

18
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:46,898
This is Dr. Kwon Sukeun?

19
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:50,693
<i>Besides, the person
who showed me that was his son.</i>

20
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,238
<i>What else did I say?</i>

21
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:56,908
<i>That you didn't understand
why your father did such a thing.</i>

22
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:01,079
I knew that the Administration Bureau
was hiding something.

23
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:03,456
But I had no idea
it was something like this.

24
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,794
<i>Because I never imagined back then</i>

25
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:10,547
that it was me.

26
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:15,135
That I'd do such a thing.

27
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:28,231
<i>Because of me…</i>

28
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:32,652
It's a fire!

29
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:38,158
Is that when you saw
the world without the Grid?

30
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:45,665
By any chance, did you see the future too?

31
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:48,459
Like what happens to us in the future or…

32
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:51,880
what the world looks like
100 years from now?

33
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:53,840
No, I couldn't.

34
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:58,178
I don't know why, but I couldn't move
past the point in time where I came from.

35
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:02,515
Why is that?
Is it because it hasn't happened yet?

36
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:04,559
Because it doesn't exist yet?

37
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:06,644
What time point did you see?

38
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:08,730
What do you mean?

39
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,064
The other day.

40
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:11,524
What was it that I saw then?

41
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:13,276
You said you saw something.

42
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:14,360
Oh.

43
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:18,698
I don't know

44
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:22,577
whether I really saw something or just…

45
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:26,831
That's not the point.

46
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:31,586
Let's say the woman perishes if the man
who's to die in 1997 doesn't die.

47
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:34,297
But what about now?
The solar wind has been blocked,

48
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,716
and everything's been solved.
Why is this happening again?

49
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,219
What do you mean, again?
- Kim Manok.

50
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:42,096
He killed another person.

51
00:03:43,514 --> 00:03:44,599
Is it someone I know?

52
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:51,231
She knew I'd run to the subway station
as soon as I came to the past.

53
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:53,900
She released him
so I wouldn't be able to arrest him.

54
00:03:57,278 --> 00:03:59,113
And that's why
the cleaning lady was killed.

55
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:02,367
Was there one more then?

56
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:07,872
Kim Manok is

57
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:10,541
the child in the footage.
The janitor's son.

58
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:13,086
Then ever since then…

59
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:18,216
Wait a second.

60
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:22,679
A woman from the future
keeps hovering around a specific person?

61
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:26,266
And if that goes wrong,
the woman perishes too?

62
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,519
That leads to only one conclusion.

63
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:31,104
The two are connected.

64
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:32,480
Related by blood.

65
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:39,404
Is it a birth from the murderer's family?

66
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:45,326
Oh, hello.

67
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,829
-I should've said hello to you earlier.
-Oh, no.

68
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:49,622
We shouldn't be treating
our guest like this.

69
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:53,584
Goodness. Why didn't you bring her inside?

70
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:55,586
No, don't mind me. I'm not a guest.

71
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:59,257
Oh, my. So you're not a guest?

72
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:01,426
I am a guest.

73
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:02,969
A guest leaving soon.

74
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:07,432
-Please, drink.
-Okay. Thank you.

75
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:08,391
Sure.

76
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:19,360
I wish we could just say
it's three minus one.

77
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:23,031
That we saved three people
at the cost of one person's life.

78
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:24,741
It's two minus one.

79
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:29,412
But I saw earlier that Eojin
and Ms. Choi were safe.

80
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:31,372
Your mother too.

81
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,957
That injection.

82
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:38,254
It was a vitamin shot.

83
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:39,380
How?

84
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:41,924
I mean…

85
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:46,220
What I mean is that it's a great relief.

86
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:48,848
But what's she trying to pull?

87
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:51,225
That means she got shot on purpose

88
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:54,228
and knew that the breakdown
of the Grid was a lie.

89
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:58,274
Otherwise, she wouldn't have
pretended to harm your mother.

90
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:01,027
For God's sake.

91
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:03,780
Is she playing with us or what?

92
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:06,824
She shouldn't have shown up
in the first place.

93
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:09,535
She shouldn't have shown up
at the AB in the first place.

94
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:12,914
You wondered before too
why she showed up before your eyes.

95
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:15,666
Do you know why now?

96
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,128
Now that you've seen the year 1997?

97
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:23,341
My father wasn't even considered
a victim at first.

98
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:27,220
"He happened to be on duty that night
and happened to run into the Ghost.

99
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,721
What…

100
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:32,600
rotten luck."

101
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:33,726
That was the conclusion.

102
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:37,605
The Administration Bureau was only
interested in the janitor in the footage.

103
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:41,776
Since that was obviously
not a coincidence.

104
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:48,157
But the AB guessed wrong as well.

105
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,450
It wasn't the janitor.

106
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:54,080
Since 1997, the Ghost has been
hovering around Kim Manok,

107
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:56,749
obviously showing us
that she's protecting him.

108
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,668
But is she really protecting him?

109
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:01,379
She killed his father before his eyes.

110
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:03,714
And she locked him up
as if he was a beast.

111
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:06,050
It turns out that she's able to teleport
with someone else.

112
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:07,343
Why wouldn't she flee with him?

113
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:16,602
Why do I care who she meets?

114
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:21,065
Did you park next door?

115
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:23,651
No, it should be all right.

116
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:37,457
It wasn't your neighbor.

117
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:44,338
How does it feel?

118
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:51,095
No one used to remember your father,
but he's a hero now.

119
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:53,139
And you're that hero's son.

120
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:58,227
Do you remember the first time
all your family gathered?

121
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:04,609
Did you meet your father?

122
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:11,324
Now I've seen him as an aged man.

123
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,409
He wasn't a hero,

124
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,537
but now I can at least recall his face.

125
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:23,836
So that's what you left behind.

126
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:43,856
Ooh!

127
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,820
Take the chicken bones out of the bag.

128
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:52,365
I told you, they're trash, not food waste.

129
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:53,407
What chicken?

130
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:57,078
What the hell? Did she smell it?

131
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:19,016
<i>Kim Manok is</i>

132
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,978
<i>the child in the footage.
The janitor's son.</i>

133
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:26,941
<i>The two are connected.</i>

134
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:37,910
EPISODE 9

135
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:19,285
NATIONAL FORENSIC SERVICE

136
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:24,373
Ms. Chae. I need you to send
an official document.

137
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:26,584
The recipient is Nature Orphanage.

138
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:27,585
MINISTRY OF TRADE, INDUSTRY AND ENERGY

139
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:29,045
I got this a minute ago...

140
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:32,590
A cop was here, right? You just need
to tell me what you two talked about.

141
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:38,429
What did you talk about?

142
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:45,436
She said a man from this orphanage
was suspected of murder.

143
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:47,188
His name is Kim Manok.

144
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:48,689
I see.

145
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:51,025
I told her that I was aware of it

146
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:54,403
because some woman had come
to ask about him before.

147
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:56,072
Some woman?

148
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:58,407
Well, it was an unusual name.

149
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:01,494
Jongyi or something.

150
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,413
Oh. Go on.

151
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:07,166
I repeated what I said then.

152
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:10,670
That Manok was found on a market street
and brought to us,

153
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:13,798
and looked more like an abandoned child
than a missing child.

154
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:18,427
Because handicapped children
are more often abandoned.

155
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:20,429
What handicap?

156
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:27,812
When he first came here,
he couldn't speak at all.

157
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:31,148
He seemed to be five or six years old,
but he couldn't speak.

158
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:33,359
So I thought he was born speech-impaired.

159
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:36,112
Then how did you know
his name and birth record?

160
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:39,365
We named him Kim Manok
and re-registered his birth.

161
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:42,493
Then his record as Lee Siwon
must've been completely deleted.

162
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:53,129
<i>She said Manok
used to have a family,</i>

163
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:56,090
<i>though he was adopted.</i>

164
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:59,468
<i>And his name was Lee Siwon then.</i>

165
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,138
No outsiders entered the building.

166
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:06,100
It was Sunday,
so only few people entered at all.

167
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:07,435
I don't know how it happened…

168
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:09,645
<i>His stepparents ran a business.</i>

169
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:12,356
<i>But as they went bankrupt,
his stepmother left home.</i>

170
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,525
He said there was no one else
to look after the child.

171
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:15,776
He practically begged…

172
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,988
<i>But his stepfather passed away.</i>

173
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,741
<i>That's what I just heard
from that police officer.</i>

174
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:25,619
Manok never said a word
about his stepfamily.

175
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:31,459
But one day, he suddenly poured out words,

176
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:34,336
so I remember us saying this.

177
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:36,922
Maybe he's not handicapped.

178
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:39,592
Was he traumatized?

179
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:41,844
Or is he aphasic?"

180
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:45,681
Seeing that no one reported him missing,

181
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,850
I think his family abandoned him

182
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:50,644
after his stepfather passed away.

183
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:53,898
He was adopted when he was one.

184
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:57,693
Then I'm sure he thought
they were his real family.

185
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,195
How could they...

186
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,989
Anything else?
What else did the officer say?

187
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,493
What else? Oh.

188
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:10,164
She asked me if any woman visited Manok
when he was here, and showed me a picture…

189
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,210
No, should I say it was a sketch?

190
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:16,003
Anyway, she showed it to me and…

191
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:19,173
Yes, this is it.

192
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:22,259
The woman named Jongyi
asked me the same question,

193
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,095
but no one visited him.

194
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:30,267
How did the officer find out

195
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:32,269
that Kim Manok and Lee Siwon
were the same person?

196
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:34,188
She didn't mention that.

197
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:36,398
She just said

198
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:39,735
she met Manok's stepmother
before she came here.

199
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:45,074
Are you suggesting her stepmother told her
Kim Manok's original name was Lee Siwon?

200
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:46,742
Well, that is…

201
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:48,160
Well.

202
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:51,831
I assume she had a way to find that out
since she's a police officer.

203
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:54,124
Right.

204
00:13:58,712 --> 00:13:59,755
<i>Lee Siwon.</i>

205
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:00,923
<i>Kim Manok.</i>

206
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:05,219
<i>She must've gone to see his stepmother
since she knew they were the same person.</i>

207
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:08,806
<i>Otherwise, she couldn't have linked
Lee Siwon to Kim Manok</i>

208
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:11,100
<i>no matter what she heard
from his stepmother.</i>

209
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,061
<i>Jung Saebyeok.</i>

210
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:17,565
<i>How come she knows more than we do?</i>

211
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:23,362
<i>You remember the
convenience store murderer's accomplice?</i>

212
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:24,822
Of course, I do.

213
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:26,866
How can I forget someone
with disjointed DNA?

214
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:34,540
Oh?

215
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:36,584
Is this from her?
- Yes.

216
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:39,670
Did you compare the criminal's DNA
to hers last time?

217
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:42,673
-No. There was no request for that.
-Mm.

218
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:44,884
Is she his family,
not just his accomplice?

219
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:47,428
Please find that out for me.
If they're related by blood.

220
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,849
Well, considering their ages,
they can't be a parent and child.

221
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:53,684
Maybe they're a brother and sister...
- No.

222
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:55,019
What if…

223
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:58,022
Just hypothetically.

224
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:00,399
As for direct ancestors...

225
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:04,153
...how many generations
can you trace back?

226
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:06,864
I'm not sure.

227
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:11,952
Well, in case of a maternal line, we can
trace back as many generations as we want.

228
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:14,204
But if a paternal line is included,
it becomes ambiguous

229
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:16,332
after three or four generations
as you probably know.

230
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,377
But one of them can't be
the other's direct ancestor.

231
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:22,671
Didn't you say they were
around the same age?

232
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,925
Please find out everything you can
about them using all your databases.

233
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:28,052
-Scour it for any clues?
-Yes.

234
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:29,136
Okay.

235
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:31,096
I'm sure you're busy,
but how long will it take?

236
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:35,017
If I have to run it
through the database, well…

237
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:39,188
-I'll try to finish by the end of the day.
-Thank you.

238
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,982
-I'll treat you to a nice meal later.
-What?

239
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:45,110
How about you do it now?
I could use some food.

240
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:48,447
I have somewhere else to be right now, so…

241
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:50,240
Thank you for doing this.

242
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:51,492
Bye.

243
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:55,955
I'll ask her to buy me dinner then.

244
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:14,515
Mr. Kwon called and asked for another

245
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:15,849
-day off...
-Mr. Song Eojin.

246
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:27,069
Yes?

247
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:31,240
About that child…

248
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:32,783
Who?

249
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:34,326
Kim Manok.

250
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:37,788
-Child?
-Find out his original name.

251
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:40,040
Did he have a different name?

252
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:43,961
There's no record of a name change.

253
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:47,589
How old were you in 1997?

254
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,467
I was nine.

255
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:56,140
If you were five or six,
do you think you'd remember?

256
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:59,518
Remember what, ma'am?

257
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:06,233
If you help me understand your question,
I'll be able to give you a better answer.

258
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:07,484
Never mind.

259
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:30,049
She even knew which station
he was last seen at.

260
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,886
If she didn't hear it from her ex-husband…

261
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:53,781
Did something happen
to Kwon Saeha yesterday?

262
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:56,825
Did he go out for lunch?
You said he seemed to have had a fight.

263
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:59,995
No, he looked fine
when he came back from lunch.

264
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:03,082
But in one or two minutes, he suddenly…

265
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,167
Did he fight with you?

266
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,711
Why would I fight
with my colleague at work?

267
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:09,171
But then,

268
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:11,423
if you two had a fight
and Mr. Kwon looked like that,

269
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:12,966
you'd probably be hurt more…

270
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:15,219
What? You don't know
what you're talking about.

271
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:16,929
I'm taller...
- Enough.

272
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,264
How did he look?

273
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:21,308
Well, his clothes were a mess,

274
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:23,560
and his cheek was hurt,
so I thought he might have...

275
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:26,396
A security alarm went off too.
I'm not sure what he was carrying though.

276
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,905
Ms. Chae. If you want to brownnose
that moron, do it alone.

277
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:36,824
Okay.

Eat at home at least on your day off.

You've never had a day off.

I'm not that old yet.

Don't treat me like an old person.

It doesn't matter how old you are.

328

It's about how much you've suffered.

329
00:22:31,224 --> 00:22:33,894
You're the one who's suffered.
Because of me.

330
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:35,437
What about me?

331
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:37,731
You're my only child.

332
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:40,108
But I almost adopted you out
to my brother.

333
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:41,485
This time too?

334
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:44,154
I must've been out of my mind. What?

335
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:46,365
What do you mean, this time too?

336
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:47,282
Never mind.

337
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:51,370
But my family name has always been Kwon.

338
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:53,663
What are you talking about?

339
00:22:53,997 --> 00:22:56,208
Of course, it's Kwon.
What else could it be?

340
00:22:58,335 --> 00:22:59,669
If Uncle had adopted me,

341
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:01,963
it would've changed.

342
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:03,298
I know.

343
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:06,093
I must've been crazy. Goodness.

344
00:23:06,843 --> 00:23:10,889
I shouldn't have started the business.
I almost left you huge debts.

To be a decent man.

00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:25,172
SNAIL SOUP KITCHEN

353
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:26,965
Oh!

354
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:15,805
Do you not need the company anymore?
Because you have no more questions?

355
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:20,185
Are you here to persuade me
to go back to work?

356
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:21,478
How did you do it?

357
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:22,646
How did you go there?

358
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:26,024
It must be still vivid in your memory.

359
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:30,362
To me, it's been over 20 years.
But to someone, it was yesterday.

360
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:33,490
What memory are you talking about?

361
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:38,286
The memory of the IRR
putting all the blame on the deceased,

362
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,413
insisting that he died from overwork?

363
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,875
Or the memory of
the IRR people sending out a notice

364
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:46,670
telling the bereaved to pick up the
mysteriously dead person's body

365
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:47,629
from the mortuary?

366
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:52,968
How can you say that when we commemorate
your father's death every year?

367
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:54,970
Not all my questions have been answered.

368
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:57,806
I want to know why the labs
from other countries stayed silent.

369
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:01,434
When you asserted that Doctor Kwon Sukeun
from Korea created the Grid,

370
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:03,061
why did they keep silent?

371
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:06,648
Then who were we supposed to say
it was created by?

372
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:07,816
The Ghost?

373
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,569
What evidence could the AB provide
to support that claim?

374
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:13,822
Should we have just revealed
the video of the Ghost?

375
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:15,365
Is that why you used my father?

376
00:26:15,448 --> 00:26:18,076
It was your father's code
that operated the machine.

377
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:19,869
We have a clear record of that.

378
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:22,372
-He was murdered because of that code.
-Keep it down.

379
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:26,126
Do you think
the rest of the world accepted

380
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:27,794
that we created the Grid from the start?

381
00:26:27,877 --> 00:26:30,255
What do you think made them all shut up?

382
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:34,593
The video of Doctor Kwon
and the Ghost together.

383
00:26:35,343 --> 00:26:37,721
<i>The one who made us
use your father…</i>

384
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:39,180
was you.

385
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:47,939
SONG EOJIN

386
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:50,275
What is it?

387
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:54,613
Raise the alert level
and be prepared for the Ghost.

388
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:59,993
Kim Manok has been arrested.
He's being transported now.

389
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:05,957
Have you grown fond of him or something,
having seen him as a child?

390
00:27:08,084 --> 00:27:10,629
A serial killer has been caught.
What's that look on your face?

391
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:16,718
Do you want to hand in
your resignation here?

392
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:23,808
How much time do I have left?

393
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:35,779
I'll go get changed.

394
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:45,246
KWON SAEHA

395
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:51,711
<i>The line is busy.</i>

396
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:53,463
Please leave a message after the tone.

397
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:57,467
JUNG SAEBYEOK

398
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:08,895
<i>The line
is busy. Please leave a message…</i>

399
00:28:08,978 --> 00:28:10,105
Where did they catch him?

400
00:28:11,564 --> 00:28:13,233
Being transported? You mean, to the AB?

401
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:16,319
NFS OFFICER

402
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:17,529
Detective. I...

403
00:28:17,612 --> 00:28:19,572
<i>Sorry,
I just got an important call.</i>

404
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:20,490
<i>I'll call you back.</i>

405
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:23,326
Okay.

406
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:25,912
But if…

407
00:28:29,332 --> 00:28:30,667
Thank you for everything.

408
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:33,837
Goodbye.

409
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:40,593
What's Kim Manok's purpose?

410
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:42,929
Did she just need someone
who could make a mess?

411
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:45,932
The Ghost can't exist without him.

412
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:55,275
"The Ghost can't exist without him."

413
00:28:57,193 --> 00:28:58,153
Is she his descendant?

414
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:03,616
If Kim Manok's child or future child

415
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:06,494
gives birth to the Ghost or something…

416
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:11,124
Then that explains
why she's protecting that scumbag.

417
00:29:11,207 --> 00:29:12,876
I don't know how they're related.

418
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:15,086
You don't know their relationship,

419
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:17,630
but you know the relationship
between the janitor and Kim Manok?

420
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:25,638
You're the one who gave the information
to the investigator, aren't you?

421
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:29,642
Why?

422
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:32,145
There's good news and bad news.

423
00:29:32,228 --> 00:29:33,646
What's there to be good or bad?

424
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,190
Maybe it's not necessarily good news.

425
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:38,234
Do you remember I said
that the woman's DNA was a little off?

426
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:40,028
Yes. That it's disjointed.

427
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:42,530
<i>But it appears to be normal this time.</i>

428
00:29:43,406 --> 00:29:44,491
How is that possible?

429
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:45,617
What's the bad news?

430
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,285
Well…

431
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:48,870
They are related by blood.

432
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:50,497
Between her and the culprit?

433
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,540
<i>No, between you and her.</i>

434
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:55,168
<i>You two share the same mitochondrial DNA.</i>

435
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:05,720
<i>Well, I found identical DNA,
so I checked whose it was.</i>

436
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:09,432
<i>It wasn't in the criminal database
but in the affiliated agency database.</i>

437
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:11,476
<i>Among the police officers
who registered their DNA.</i>

438
00:30:13,686 --> 00:30:14,979
And that was me?

439
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:16,689
<i>Yes, you two are maternally related.</i>

440
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:19,359
<i>You and the accomplice.</i>

441
00:30:23,696 --> 00:30:24,531
<i>Detective?</i>

442
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:28,535
Don't worry, Detective.
She could be a distant relative...

443
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:31,287
If she's maternally related to me,
what about her paternal line?

444
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:32,664
I mean…

445
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,041
What about her father's side?

446
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:38,837
<i>So in the past, was
Jung Saebyeok also related to the Grid?</i>

447
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,380
The detective and the Grid?

448
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:45,301
You leaked the information
to your colleague's ex-wife for no reason?

449
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:49,472
You're the one who should be blamed
by Mr. Song, not me.

450
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:53,142
If you'd let us work freely,
I wouldn't have needed the police's help.

451
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:56,187
If you didn't make us stay in the office,
I would've done the legwork myself.

452
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:59,107
You're the one who made me use
someone's ex-wife.

453
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:03,570
And you criticized me for
using your father after what you've done?

454
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:09,242
By the way, I'm sure
this is just a coincidence.

455
00:31:09,325 --> 00:31:11,369
<i>But the convenience store murderer
and his accomplice</i>

456
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:13,121
<i>share the same blood type,
which is cis-AB.</i>

457
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:19,168
What?

458
00:31:19,502 --> 00:31:21,671
<i>Only 3 or 4 out of 10,000 people</i>

459
00:31:21,754 --> 00:31:23,506
<i>have that blood type, and they both do.</i>

460
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:24,924
Are you saying…

461
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:28,970
both the culprit and I are

462
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:31,097
<i>biologically related to the woman?</i>

463
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:35,184
But as for the culprit and the woman,
only 13% of their DNA matches.

464
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:36,185
And that doesn't

465
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:41,566
<i>necessarily mean the culprit and you are
connected through the woman.</i>

466
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:44,569
What if they're related by blood?

467
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:45,528
I mean,

468
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:50,366
what if the culprit and she
are a descendant and ancestor

469
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:51,743
or something like that?

470
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:53,745
<i>Then it makes sense.</i>

471
00:31:53,828 --> 00:31:55,788
We just can't know
how many generations apart.

472
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:57,999
<i>But that's out of the question.</i>

473
00:31:58,917 --> 00:31:59,918
<i>They live in the same age,</i>

474
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:04,547
<i>so one of them can't be the other's
descendant or grandmother or grandfather.</i>

475
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:09,761
<i>So you used the investigator,
and you're blaming me for that?</i>

476
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:13,431
But you still violated security protocol.

477
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:16,684
-You won't just be given a reprimand.
-Okay.

478
00:32:18,227 --> 00:32:19,562
You don't even care?

479
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:26,945
What's wrong?

480
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:30,531
What was the number for security?

481
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:32,450
Number seven.

482
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:38,998
Sir. We've been ordered to keep
Kim Manok at the lobby when he arrives.

483
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:40,500
It's Ms. Choi's order.

484
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:42,460
TO DEPUTY DIRECTOR CHOI SEONUL
IT'S DONE, MA'AM

485
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:55,932
<i>Why did she show up in front of me?</i>

486
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:09,737
<i>If she's maternally related to me,
what about her paternal line?</i>

487
00:33:10,446 --> 00:33:11,698
<i>What about her father's side?</i>

488
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:22,792
<i>Since 1997, the Ghost has been
hovering around Kim Manok,</i>

489
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:25,586
<i>obviously showing us
that she's protecting him.</i>

490
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:28,047
<i>He's on her father's side…</i>

491
00:33:29,632 --> 00:33:30,883
<i>And I'm on her mother's side?</i>

492
00:33:42,311 --> 00:33:43,479
Are you out of your mind?

493
00:33:45,481 --> 00:33:46,774
I won't let it slide.

494
00:34:03,916 --> 00:34:04,751
Status?

495
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:06,878
All clear in the lobby.

496
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:25,855
Here he comes.

497
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:49,504
Hold on. Please stand by here.

498
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:52,256
-What are you talking about?
-You heard her clearly.

499
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,591
Excuse me.

500
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:57,428
Just a minute, please.
Let me register him.

501
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:08,773
-You should've done this beforehand.
-They are here.

502
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:28,000
Lee Siwon.

503
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:45,351
Lee Siwon.

504
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:58,906
I think you've mistaken me
for someone else.

505
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,366
How do you contact the woman?

506
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:04,829
Has she ever told you
why she protects you?

507
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:06,789
She helped you many times.

508
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:11,085
Do you need a beating to talk?

509
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:13,880
Is that what you want?

510
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:18,926
I've never even heard her voice.

511
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:22,388
She never says anything to me.

512
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:27,310
She's never apologized to you
for what she did to your father?

513
00:36:28,227 --> 00:36:29,395
Lee Siwon.

514
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:33,733
Even after your father's business
went bankrupt and his wife left home,

515
00:36:33,816 --> 00:36:36,903
he tried to protect you
when you weren't even his real child.

516
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:39,989
He even took you to a place
that he wasn't supposed to.

517
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:47,330
I don't have a father.

518
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:51,584
You've got the wrong person…

519
00:36:53,794 --> 00:36:55,004
So let me go.

520
00:36:55,087 --> 00:36:59,175
He burned to death in front of you.
In a place just like this.

521
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:00,718
By the front door.

522
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:20,446
Are you sure you've never seen me before?

523
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:50,101
If you had been raised by him,
you would've become a different person.

524
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:51,227
They must be here.

525
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:53,562
That's when your life got screwed up.

526
00:37:54,897 --> 00:37:57,984
But you've completely forgotten it.
Don't you feel wronged?

527
00:37:58,567 --> 00:37:59,860
He's right in front of you.

528
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:31,100
<i>Tell her to come up immediately.</i>

529
00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:32,685
Mr. Jo wants you to come up.

530
00:38:32,768 --> 00:38:34,186
You really don't remember him?

531
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:36,814
Take him.

532
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:41,527
Stay still!

533
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:42,653
Don't move.

534
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:02,590
Don't run!

535
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:18,522
You were…

536
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:21,067
there.

537
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,610
-Where?
-Take him.

538
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:47,551
Keep an eye on him.

539
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:52,890
Go to the security office
and keep me posted on his every move.

540
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:53,933
DR. KWON SUKEUN

541
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:14,472
The man in the footage from 1997 is me.

542
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:18,851
I took the device from the Ghost
and went to the past.

543
00:41:18,934 --> 00:41:22,229
-How?
-The Administration Bureau captured her,

544
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:25,524
and I knew that two devices
were needed for time travel.

545
00:41:25,941 --> 00:41:28,444
I don't know how it works though.

546
00:41:30,779 --> 00:41:32,281
A chip inserted in the body

547
00:41:32,364 --> 00:41:34,658
transforms neural signals
into motor signals.

548
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:37,786
That's what you said yourself
and that's all I know.

549
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:38,704
I did?

550
00:41:39,705 --> 00:41:41,624
-I said that?
-Yes.

551
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:45,211
Where's the device?

552
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:46,253
I returned it to her.

553
00:41:46,962 --> 00:41:50,549
-Are you out of your mind? Why?
-She let us capture her on purpose.

554
00:41:50,633 --> 00:41:53,385
She knew all about the AB's plan

555
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:55,262
and showed up and played along.

556
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:58,516
Why?

557
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:00,309
I don't know either.

558
00:42:00,392 --> 00:42:03,437
Since her capture was the only way to make
Doctor Kwon's son go to the past?

559
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:05,314
Did she know that too?

560
00:42:05,397 --> 00:42:08,609
That the two of you had to kill
the janitor together for her to exist?

561
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:10,903
And? What else?

562
00:42:11,487 --> 00:42:12,988
The Ghost came from the future.

563
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:14,490
And she can travel back in time.

564
00:42:14,573 --> 00:42:17,493
Just as you all know.
And she came here to build the Grid.

565
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:18,494
Is that all?

566
00:42:18,577 --> 00:42:20,621
How the device works,
what the energy source is,

567
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:23,374
and how you travel through time.
You should've figured that out.

568
00:42:23,457 --> 00:42:25,417
You even took her device. Is that all?

569
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:28,254
I should've also asked
for the blueprint of the Grid, right?

570
00:42:28,337 --> 00:42:31,382
It's been 20 years, but all we can do
is use what she built for us.

571
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:33,717
We haven't even been able
to decipher the first formula.

572
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:35,302
But I should've asked for it, right?

573
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:36,845
How dare you act up?

574
00:42:37,429 --> 00:42:40,808
Don't you realize
what an enormous opportunity you missed?

575
00:42:41,433 --> 00:42:44,186
You also have no idea
what opportunity I missed.

576
00:42:47,189 --> 00:42:48,482
It doesn't matter though.

577
00:42:49,024 --> 00:42:50,317
What is he talking about?

578
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:52,611
Has he lost his mind after time traveling?

579
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:54,613
What was the Administration Bureau's plan?

580
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:56,699
How did we capture the Ghost?

581
00:42:56,782 --> 00:42:58,367
We can't use that trick anymore.

582
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:02,204
We announced that the Grid broke down.

583
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:06,208
The Ghost knew
that I was the one who suggested it.

584
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,795
Well, if she knows everything,

585
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:13,507
what do we do… Hey, go ahead.

586
00:43:16,885 --> 00:43:17,720
We need to talk.

587
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:34,862
Do you think we should believe
what he says?

588
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:39,116
I don't know about that,
but I don't think he even bothers to lie.

589
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:40,951
God damn it.

590
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:51,837
If that's all true, there's no chance
that she'll show up now.

591
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,845
She knows what we haven't even done yet.

592
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:01,680
Do you think

593
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:05,351
she released Manok
because he's no longer of any use to her?

594
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:07,895
If that's not the case…

595
00:44:10,272 --> 00:44:11,315
Then what?

596
00:44:21,867 --> 00:44:23,285
Who's Lee Siwon?

597
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:26,747
This is the first time I've felt
we didn't have enough CCTVs here.

598
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:28,749
Do you think…

599
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:32,503
the Ghost will come to rescue him?

600
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:35,839
You've been working here
since the Institute of Radio Research.

601
00:44:36,548 --> 00:44:38,717
Who killed that child's father?

602
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:40,761
You heard the answer earlier.

603
00:44:41,261 --> 00:44:43,639
What I heard is that Saeha killed him.

604
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:47,101
But even Kim Manok was too young
to remember what happened.

605
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:48,686
That means Saeha was a baby then.

606
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:50,354
A baby killed a person?

607
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:52,314
You know something, don't you?

608
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:55,025
Yes, I've been working here
since the IRR days.

609
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:56,944
But I'm just a contract worker.

610
00:44:57,945 --> 00:45:01,657
They give me work,
but they never say anything to me.

611
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:06,578
Even back then, no one said anything to me
about what happened that night.

612
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:07,579
I'm just…

613
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:09,873
one of these.

614
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:16,547
What's your name, sir?

615
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:18,549
Pardon?

616
00:45:18,632 --> 00:45:21,009
I'm Chae Jongyi. What's your name?

617
00:45:22,344 --> 00:45:23,345
I am

618
00:45:25,013 --> 00:45:25,848
Han Wihan.

619
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:28,308
Sorry? Hani Hani?

620
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:32,521
It's Han Wihan
whether you read it forwards or backwards.

621
00:45:33,272 --> 00:45:34,523
Han Wihan.

622
00:45:35,649 --> 00:45:38,277
Oh, Mr. Han Wihan.

623
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:52,875
UNREGISTERED PERSON
IN POSSESSION OF FIREARMS

624
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:55,002
UNREGISTERED PERSON
IN POSSESSION OF FIREARMS

625
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:00,257
Put your gun down.

626
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:01,258
Just shoot me.

627
00:46:01,341 --> 00:46:02,801
I'd rather die.

628
00:46:02,885 --> 00:46:03,969
Put your gun down.

629
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:13,187
Will you shoot a cop?

630
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:15,606
Who's going to shoot?

631
00:46:16,398 --> 00:46:19,526
I need to know that to report
who is accountable for shooting a cop.

632
00:46:22,654 --> 00:46:23,822
Anyone?

633
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,541
Wouldn't it be better to talk this out?

634
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,128
What brings you here?

635
00:46:38,837 --> 00:46:39,880
Kim Manok is here, right?

636
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:41,089
What if he is?

637
00:46:41,173 --> 00:46:42,508
I'm going to kill him.

638
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:47,930
I'll just take her outside.

639
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:50,057
It's not your concern. Stay out of it.

640
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:52,476
If that jerk really deserves to die,
I won't stop you.

641
00:46:56,355 --> 00:46:57,981
But can we talk for a minute before that?

642
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,995
-Back to your positions.
-Yes, sir.

643
00:47:21,713 --> 00:47:23,048
It'll just be a minute.

644
00:47:23,131 --> 00:47:24,591
I just need to ask him one question.

645
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:25,968
Let me meet that bastard.

646
00:47:26,051 --> 00:47:27,469
How did you know that he was here?

647
00:47:29,096 --> 00:47:30,264
Is it Kwon Saeha again?

648
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:32,891
How much do you know about him?

649
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:34,268
Stop. I don't want to hear it.

650
00:47:34,351 --> 00:47:36,270
How much do you know about him?

651
00:47:37,563 --> 00:47:39,606
Did Manok really meet Saeha
when he was little?

652
00:47:47,447 --> 00:47:48,532
He did, didn't he?

653
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:50,951
And you knew it.

654
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:53,704
Is that why you're doing this?

655
00:47:53,787 --> 00:47:54,913
No.

656
00:47:54,997 --> 00:47:56,415
It's just about me.

657
00:47:56,498 --> 00:47:58,417
So what is it?

658
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:04,590
Seriously, it won't take long.

659
00:48:06,383 --> 00:48:08,510
The whole building is on high alert.

660
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:10,596
Why do you think they brought him here?

661
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:25,402
Don't give her a chance.

662
00:48:27,487 --> 00:48:30,616
<i>They say the Ghost won't show up
if she stands no chance,</i>

663
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:33,911
<i>but they're surrounding him
tightly on all sides.</i>

664
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:36,914
<i>So she can't even grab his hand
even if she pops out.</i>

665
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:38,665
<i>So she can't take him.</i>

666
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:43,754
CHAE JONGYI

667
00:48:49,885 --> 00:48:52,137
<i>But if you must see him, I'll ask them.</i>

668
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:56,308
But what you say will be recorded,
and what you do will be closely monitored.

669
00:48:57,684 --> 00:48:58,644
Is that okay?

670
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:02,230
Forget it. I understand.

671
00:49:03,899 --> 00:49:06,193
You came all the way here
to give up that easily?

672
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:07,527
What do you want me to do?

673
00:49:13,325 --> 00:49:15,410
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have taken it out on you.

674
00:49:17,537 --> 00:49:19,915
-Give me the key. If you drive now…
-Don't come.

675
00:49:19,998 --> 00:49:22,626
The building is on high alert.
Don't leave your post because of me.

676
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:45,607
-You, go there.
-Yes, sir.

677
00:49:47,943 --> 00:49:50,195
You two, stand by outside.
You two, go out.

678
00:49:50,278 --> 00:49:51,571
And the rest, take the elevator.

679
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:55,659
DUE TO AN EMERGENCY, ALL EMPLOYEES
MUST BE ON ALERT AND ON STANDBY

680
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:01,832
Let's move.

681
00:50:12,968 --> 00:50:13,927
Freeze! Don't move!

682
00:50:14,219 --> 00:50:15,178
I'll fire if you move.

683
00:50:21,226 --> 00:50:22,144
Beta on the loose!

684
00:50:25,105 --> 00:50:27,691
<i>Which way did he go?</i>
- No idea. I can't see him.

685
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:29,401
He's heading to the emergency exit.
