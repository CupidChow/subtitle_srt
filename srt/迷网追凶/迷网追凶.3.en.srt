00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:53,720
Show me the footage of my office.

3
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:02,687
From five minutes ago.

4
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,231
Did I miss something?

5
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:29,631
The corridor too, right?

6
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:51,945
I guess your subordinates
wash that for you too.

7
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:06,918
<i>I was emptying your trash can
and thought I could wash this too.</i>

8
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:11,047
I apologize.
I won't touch anything in this room again.

9
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:20,932
Now we know the school Kim Manok attended
and the last place he lived...

10
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:23,309
- And his orphanage.
- Can you go there? The orphanage?

11
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:24,853
Yes.

Hello? Jung Saebyeok speaking.

15
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:17,738
Pardon?

16
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:35,298
IT'S ME, SONG

17
00:03:57,028 --> 00:04:01,366
You're the only person who can make this
for me. You specialize in biopsy evidence.

18
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:08,468
My phone number that I never gave you,
and even my work experience.

19
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:10,208
What else do you know?

20
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:14,212
If you help me, I'll share every piece
of information I get with this.

21
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,383
It's illegal.

22
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:19,509
No, it's not.

23
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:21,302
It's just one of my company's bylaws.

24
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:23,566
We're not allowed to enter the 13th floor,

25
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:26,891
but that's just a line drawn by
my higher-ups to monopolize information.

26
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:28,335
You're not obliged to follow that.

27
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:30,979
To lift the fingerprints,
I need to use the equipment in here.

28
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:33,273
And that's illegal.
Using it for personal reasons.

29
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:35,400
But it's to catch the accomplice.

30
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:36,818
What if you find the murderer,

31
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:39,046
but she shows up,
helps him flee, and disappears again?

32
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,405
What are you going to do then?

33
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:44,450
All the information about her is
on the 13th floor of my office building.

34
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:46,054
You just need to help me get in there.

35
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:48,719
- You told me to stay out of it.
- That didn't stop you yesterday.

36
00:04:55,044 --> 00:04:56,044
What's your name?

37
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:57,629
I'm sorry.

38
00:04:58,548 --> 00:04:59,548
I'm Kim Saeha.

39
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:01,049
Mr. Kim Saeha.

40
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:04,304
It doesn't seem
you're doing this out of curiosity.

41
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:06,806
Seeing how you're desperate
to enter the 13th floor,

42
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:09,600
I don't think it's because you're
pissed off by the line they drew.

43
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:12,854
You won't help me unless
you're convinced why I'm doing this?

44
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,273
Who said I'd help you?

45
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:22,613
You promised me to let me in on it.

46
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:24,907
If you betray me,

47
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:27,493
I'll go talk to your boss.

48
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:30,245
Sure.

49
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:32,415
How long will it take?

50
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:45,261
I checked the culprit's phone records.

<i>Did you get the fingerprint results?
The one you collected yesterday.</i>

60
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:21,381
<i>No matches on them.</i>

61
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:23,633
<i>I went through the national database.</i>

62
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:27,470
<i>I even checked the entry logs in Korea
in case she was a foreigner.</i>

63
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:29,013

How are these so clear?

69
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:11,347

SENDING IMAGE

71
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:48,217
How did you get the value
of the thickness?

72
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,261
That's always the hardest part.

73
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:52,555
If it's thick, it's stable,
but it's unrecognizable

74
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:54,932
because electrical currents
can't pass through it.

75
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,728
To make it stick to the skin, and
for electrical current to pass through itâ€¦

76
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:03,399
Wait. You know
about the thickness setting?

77
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:08,589
You've tried it yourself, haven't you?

78
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:12,617
You've tried forging a fingerprint before.

79
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:15,578
Detective.

80
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:19,665
I must've been out of my mind.

81
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:22,126
Let go of me.

82
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,339
You can kill me later.

83
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:29,133
- Kill you for what?
- Please help me.

84
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:30,259
Please complete it.

85
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:31,343
Yes.

86
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,095
I have tried to make it myself.

87
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,306
But I failed every time,
so I couldn't try it at work.

88
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:39,519
If you make it for me
and I use it for some other purpose,

89
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:40,937
you can shoot me. I don't care.

90
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:45,733
What would you say
if I asked why you're doing this?

91
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:47,902
You don't care why I'm doing this.

92
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:51,405
You want to know who she is too.
That's why you decided to work with me.

- Yes.

So I'm to snitch on you to her

105
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:25,207
About 15 minutes.

106
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:29,503
Lay out your hand.

107
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:50,941
I guess the AB is
only interested in the woman

108
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:52,109
and not the murderer.

109
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:54,862
But we must catch the culprit to find her.

110
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:56,364
If she really is his accomplice.

111
00:10:57,114 --> 00:10:58,449
You guys are the opposite of us.

112
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:01,786
We tried to get the accomplice
in order to get the culprit.

113
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,651
You tried to catch the one
who would disappear in a flash?

114
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:08,804
Your colleagues didn't believe you, right?

115
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:17,343
I should've listened to Captain
and not mentioned the woman in the report.

116
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:19,637
Then I wouldn't have found out.

117
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:30,271
Done.

118
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:39,823

<i>About the child...</i>

154
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:50,614
<i>He said there was no one else

00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:56,203
<i>He practically begged and promised

<i>I didn't know the kid,
but he seemed so shocked,</i>

<i>so I stayed with him in the lobby

<i>That's all I saw.</i>

<i>I arrived first and went to the lobby.</i>

173
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:06,273
<i>He seemed to have died on the spot.</i>

174
00:26:06,856 --> 00:26:09,568

00:26:16,032 --> 00:26:19,953
<i>No. The female staff member
was the only woman I saw.</i>

178
00:26:20,036 --> 00:26:21,871
<i>The lady who was with the child.</i>

179
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:26,376
<i>We didn't think it would be right</i>

180
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:29,379
<i>to have the child in the same ambulance
as his father's body,</i>

181
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:32,173
<i>so we were going to call
another ambulance.</i>

182
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:36,761
<i>But she said it would still be the same
as going with the dead body</i>

183
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:41,683
<i>and offered to take the child
to the hospital herself.</i>

184
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:43,935
<i>And after thatâ€¦</i>

185
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:48,648
<i>Well, that's about it
since the child's father was dead.</i>

186
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:50,733
No.

187
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:53,111
That's not all.

188
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:11,254
<i>And the person
who just called was Eojin.</i>

191
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:41,136
I'm sorry for making you come here.

192
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:43,011
Whatever.

193
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,480
Let's go over there.

GERMANY, US, HONG KONG,
AUSTRALIA, RUSSIA, SPAIN

196
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:34,898
Is this it?

197
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:36,565
Yes.

198
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:39,068
Wait, the time differences areâ€¦

199
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:40,528
They're all around the same time.

200
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:44,616
It was Sunday, May 18, 1997 in Korea.

201
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:47,327
From 8:58 p.m. to 9:05 p.m.

202
00:29:48,661 --> 00:29:51,790
Europe, Korea and even Australia?

203
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:55,960
She appeared in all those places
in ten minutes on the same day?

204
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:59,172
Not even Santa Claus
could travel that fast.

205
00:29:59,255 --> 00:30:01,758
She probably killed someone
because she isn't Santa Claus.

206
00:30:42,298 --> 00:30:43,298
Do you recognize her?

207
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:47,679
Sorry?

208
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:49,889
The person who disappeared
right before your eyes.

209
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:51,099
Is it her?

210
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:54,435
Or is it not?

211
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,270
No?

212
00:30:58,481 --> 00:31:00,775
Are you asking me if the person

213
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:04,571
caught on camera in 1997
is the same person I saw a few days ago?

214
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:07,990
Is it her?

215
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:12,412
She looks like her.

216
00:31:12,912 --> 00:31:14,497
I could say they're the same person.

217
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:22,547
She travels from continent to continent
in a few minutes.

218
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:24,007
And she hasn't aged at all

219
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:25,800
for over 20 years.

220
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:27,510
Her appearanceâ€¦

221
00:31:28,636 --> 00:31:31,596
By any chance, did she have a weapon
in her hand when she attacked you too?

222
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:36,394
What kind of weapon is that?

223
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:38,354
Burning a person in only a few seconds?

224
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:42,525
We must catch her
before she does something like that again.

225
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:44,944
Consider yourself lucky
because she didn't do that to you.

226
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,530
If she did, you wouldn't be here now.

227
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:52,452
You know about the weapon, don't you?
What is it made of?

228
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:54,912
I don't know either.

229
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:59,208
Though I heard
he seemed to have been electrocuted.

230
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:05,173
Something like this?

231
00:32:13,806 --> 00:32:15,433
She used it on you too?

232
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:16,767
But howâ€¦

233
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:18,269
How am I still alive?

234
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:20,854
I don't know.

235
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:23,232
It happened so quickly.

236
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:26,235
I didn't even know I got this wound.
Maybe that's why.

237
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:28,838
Because it touched my arm only briefly?

238
00:32:29,405 --> 00:32:30,615
But wasn't it hot?

239
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:32,951
Or didn't it feel weird
when it touched you?

240
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:35,369
No.

241
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:42,335
She only went to labs
and engineering colleges.

242
00:32:42,418 --> 00:32:44,587
What did she do in those places?

243
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:46,519
She seemed to be operating some machines.

244
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:48,633
She set up the Grid.

245
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:51,302
That's when the project started. In 1997.

246
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,515
This woman started the Grid project?

247
00:32:55,598 --> 00:32:57,225
"What did this person do here?"

248
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:58,810
That question was the beginning.

249
00:32:59,435 --> 00:33:01,396
That's how they learned
that it was possible

250
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:03,356
to build a magnetic field shield.

251
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:06,234
If it weren't for herâ€¦

252
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:07,694
Then we wouldn't be here now.

253
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:10,822
The earth was covered
with the Grid in 2004.

254
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:13,950
The sunspots exploded
right after the Grid was complete.

255
00:33:16,202 --> 00:33:18,371
They say if the solar wind
had come a year earlier,

256
00:33:18,454 --> 00:33:20,206
two-thirds of mankind would have died.

257
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:24,711
The Grid is even in textbooks
as the greatest achievement of mankind.

258
00:33:25,628 --> 00:33:26,462
Butâ€¦

259
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:29,400
"But that was actually done by a murderer
who burned a man to death right

260
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:30,425
before his child's eyes."

261
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:33,386
They can't put that in the textbooks.

262
00:33:39,642 --> 00:33:40,893
I saw her with my own eyes.

263
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:43,813
But I feel like a fool to believe it.

264
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:49,694
Wait, she came to save mankind.
Why did she murder a person then?

265
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:52,321
It wasn't accidental.
She definitely planned it.

266
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:54,532
And why did she
show up again after 24 years

267
00:33:54,615 --> 00:33:57,035
only to help
the convenience store murderer?

268
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:14,969
I'm sorry,
but I can't stay out for a long time.

269
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:20,975
<i>You can kill me later.</i>

270
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:24,103
If you make it for me
and I use it for some other purpose,

271
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:25,605
you can shoot me. I don't care.

272
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:30,735
Who's the man that was killed?

273
00:34:35,698 --> 00:34:36,698
An employee.

274
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:40,161
A janitor
of the Institute of Radio Research.

275
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:02,767
She isn't just any woman.
She's our savior.

276
00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:06,729
If we were directly exposed
to the solar wind,

277
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:08,898
we would have all
been destroyed by radiation.

278
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:14,715
Why don't you tell the bereaved
of the convenience store owner?

279
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:19,826
That she's our savior even though
she helped the person who killed your dad.

280
00:35:23,746 --> 00:35:25,498
Why did he bring him to his workplace?

281
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:27,542
He looked like his son.

282
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:30,878
I guess there was no one else
to look after him.

283
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:35,842
Did the janitor try to stop her
from building the Grid?

284
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:39,345
If that was the case,
for the sake of humanity--

285
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:41,430
It's okay to kill a person?

286
00:35:42,598 --> 00:35:44,183
Why are you so serious?

287
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,227
I was only guessing why.

288
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:48,688
Just don't say things
that would make me serious.

289
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:02,201
Bye.

290
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:12,295
He must be completely whipped by his wife.

291
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:28,894
Hello?

292
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:32,732
<i>Why did she do that
when she had such abilities?</i>

293
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:35,859
What do you mean?

294
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:38,946
<i>Why did
she show up in front of me?</i>

295
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:43,743
If she has the ability
to travel through time and space,

296
00:36:43,826 --> 00:36:45,453
she could've just told the culprit,

297
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:49,999
"Detectives are coming, so run that way."

298
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:52,877
And then she could've left the place too.

299
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:56,129
Don't you think?

300
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:02,303
Then I wouldn't have learned of
her existence in the first place.

301
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:05,181
Wouldn't that have been easier for her?

302
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:09,018
Why did she attack me?

303
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:13,105
She can just disappear whenever she wants,

304
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:17,151
so she doesn't mind being seen?

305
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:19,946
Would that be it?

306
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:26,410
We have questions but no answers.

307
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:29,121

<i>He's moving towards C Coast.</i>

00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:08,961
<i>He just passed
through the alley behind the motels.</i>

<i>He's running towards

Keep a close distance.

340
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:18,053
- To the subway station.
- Yes, sir.

<i>Please take a step backward.</i>

344

Did you find him?

Do you see Beta? Did you lose him?

346

They hopped on the subway

347
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:29,124
and are on their way to the car
where Beta is in.

348
00:44:29,249 --> 00:44:31,627
We need to get to the next station first
and join them.

349
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:00,948
Beta is right in front of you guys.
Do you see him?

I don't see him yetâ€¦

362

<i>Get him before the next stop!</i>

00:50:23,395 --> 00:50:24,438
Open this.

368
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:27,566
Open it!

369
00:50:29,401 --> 00:50:32,112
Hey!

370
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:40,328
I'll kill you when I get you.

Hey!

00:51:20,952 --> 00:51:23,371
There's a person locked up in here!
