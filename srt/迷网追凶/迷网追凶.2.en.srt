KIM SAEHA B-391

3
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:21,229
That's the police report
written last night.

4
00:00:22,313 --> 00:00:24,649
This is about
the convenience store suspect they lost.

5
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:26,401
I saw it on the news yesterday.

6
00:00:26,484 --> 00:00:28,570
Yes, and I reported the murder
to the police.

7
00:00:29,654 --> 00:00:32,657
- How did that happen?
- I happened to witness the scene.

8
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:34,492
I see. And?

9
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:36,786
I thought it was a simple murder
by a robber yesterday.

10
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,289
But the Songje Police Station detective
who wrote this report

11
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:41,833
experienced a strange phenomenon
while chasing the suspect.

12
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:46,629
But she might have made an excuse
to avoid criticism for losing the suspect.

13
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:48,173
The sketch is attached below.

14
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:50,462
It's an unidentified woman.

15
00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:53,053
The culprit's a woman?

16
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:55,138
The person in the footage is a man...

17
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:56,806
SKETCH OF THE ACCOMPLICE

18
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:10,097
Apparently, she's his accomplice.

19
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:19,661
Accomplice?

20
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:23,457
On what grounds?

21
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:30,215
Why do they think she's an accomplice?

22
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,801
She helped the murder suspect escape.

23
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:34,761
The thing is, after that,

24
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:38,223
the woman suddenly disappeared
before the detective's eyes.

25
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:58,993
Do you have anything else to report
as the first witness?

26
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:02,580
No. I went home
right after I made the witness statement.

27
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:07,502
Delete the record of sending this to me
from your computer.

28
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:08,878
I'll delete this report too.

29
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:10,588
I already did.

30
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:12,817
ENTER PASSWORD
DELETING THE FILE

31
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:14,092
Eojin.

32
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:16,426
By any chance...

33
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:24,561
Do you still hope that it'll happen?

34
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:25,937
It's time we gave up.

35
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,480
I hope it's right this time.

36
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:30,817
Ghost, please appear now.

37
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,293
Who wrote the report again?

38
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:50,628
It's Jung Saebyeok,
an investigator from Songje Station.

39
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:56,551
Name. Kim Manok.

40
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:59,304
What? He doesn't have a family?

41
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:00,722
No, he doesn't.

42
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:03,558
It seems that
he just stopped by the store.

43
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:06,121
It doesn't look like a revenge killing
or a premeditated crime.

44
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:09,772
I don't think he'll show up
around the victim again.

45
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:13,651
And he's not wanted,
though he was once on probation.

46
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:15,653
- For what?
- Animal abuse.

47
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:20,909
Seeing how he went back to his place,

48
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:23,620
I'm not sure
he's smart, bold, or just stupid.

49
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:29,000
Who are you?

50
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:30,751
Huh?

51
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:34,756
You identified the suspect.

52
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:36,549
We'll take it from here.

53
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:38,218
- Thank you for your work.
- What?

54
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,016
Why'd you turn it off?
Don't touch it. Who are you guys?

55
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:47,499
Hand all the evidence over to us.
We'll handle this case now.

56
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,770
Which department are you from?

57
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:50,333
We're from the Administration Bureau.

58
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:52,440
Administration? Administer what? Of where?

59
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:55,443
I don't see Investigator Jung Saebyeok.

60
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:57,686
- Where is she?
- I don't care where you guys are from.

61
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,489
Bring Investigator Jung Saebyeok.

62
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:00,572
What?

63
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:02,115
Captain.

64
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:06,746
The chief is asking for you. Something
about the Administration Bureau...

65
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,332
Where's Investigator Jung?

66
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:12,293
Detective Jung went to the NFS.

67
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,047
For DNA analysis? The culprit's DNA?

68
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:19,467
Well, the suspect has an accomplice so...

69
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:22,679
Hello, sir. Some people from
the Administration Bureau just barged...

70
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:25,222
Are you serious?

71
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:28,351
To people I don't even know?

72
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:31,688
When did Investigator Jung leave?

73
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:35,316
She left after getting a call
saying the DNA results were in.

74
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,944
Make sure both she and the NFS
don't know anything.

75
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:40,196
- Yes, ma'am.
- You two follow the manual too.

76
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,924
- We do not see, hear, or speak.
- We do not see, hear, or speak.

77
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,324
We're well aware of that, ma'am.

78
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:53,293
STRONG TEETH DENTIST

79
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:54,836
Who'd recognize him?

80
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:55,795
Sorry?

81
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:58,089
No one would recognize
a man hanging from the window

82
00:04:58,172 --> 00:04:59,632
unless they personally know him.

83
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:01,968
That wasn't why I was looking at it.

84
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:03,344
You have the results.

85
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:06,639
Yes, the results are in.
I heard she's an accomplice.

86
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:08,850
- Yes.
- You should find her soon then.

87
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,644
I will catch her. Thank you.

88
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:14,147
No, that's not what I meant.

89
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,690
Hurry before she dies.

90
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,317
What?

91
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,652
How can I explain it?
Her DNA is a little off.

92
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,154
How so?

93
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:25,908
Well, comparing it to bones,
it's like they are all dislocated.

94
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:30,455
Is that even possible?
Can she still live like that?

95
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:32,623
No, she can't.

96
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,710
Are you saying it's a dead person's DNA?

97
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:39,088
Well, I'm not sure. I've never seen
anything like this before,

98
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,007
so I'd like to do further analysis.

99
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:43,468
Do you have any other DNA samples
of the cap owner?

100
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:46,971
I'll look for more. Thank you.

101
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:50,808
Sure. Bye.

102
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:13,706
<i>How can I explain it?</i>

103
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:15,792
Her DNA is a little off.

104
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,502
<i>Hurry before she dies.</i>

105
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:22,465
Well, it's like all her bones
are dislocated.

106
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,107
Yes, Captain?

107
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:41,109
<i>You're still at the NFS, right?</i>

108
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:43,236
<i>Well, someone wants to talk to you.</i>

109
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:45,321
Who?

110
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:46,864
<i>Investigator Jung Saebyeok?</i>

111
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:48,991
<i>Listen to me carefully and do as I say.</i>

112
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:51,536
Who is this?

113
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:54,580
The Administration Bureau?

114
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:08,844
NATIONAL FORENSIC SERVICE

115
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:29,198
How can I help you?

116
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,575
Hi, we are...

117
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,151
- What are you...
- That car's the investigator in charge.

118
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:50,761
Those punks.

119
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:01,749
Get out of the car!

120
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:03,626
(in English)
Stop! Stop, stop, stop, stop!

121
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:11,300
(in Korean)
Open the door.

122
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,221
We've collected all other evidence
from your station. That's the last one.

123
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:16,931
Please cooperate.

124
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:19,595
You're not asking me to cooperate.
You're forcing me.

125
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:22,144
You must've heard everything.
Why are you doing this?

126
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:25,565
Yes, I've heard everything.
But I don't feel like cooperating.

127
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:30,820
We just need to take this.

128
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:32,196
I guess you're not busy today.

129
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,907
You wanted nothing to do with it
yesterday. Why do this now?

130
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,430
Since when did the Administration Bureau
order the police around

131
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:41,654
outside of their jurisdiction?

132
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:42,832
You have no authority.

133
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:45,376
Yes, we do. It is under our jurisdiction.
You know that.

134
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:46,586
How would I know?

135
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:50,798
All I know is that you are no different
from the Administration Bureau.

136
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:53,301
Showing up after years and
telling me to just do as you say?

137
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:55,970
It's not like I wanted to show up.
Let's just get this over with.

138
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:57,054
Eojin.

139
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,772
Can you please roll down
this window for me?

140
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,570
You must find this absurd and offensive,

141
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:15,531
but we're also public officials.
You can trust us.

142
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:19,243
This is important for us too.
We'll do our best to catch the culprit.

143
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:21,127
Just think of it
as a transfer of jurisdiction

144
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:22,288
and give us the document.

145
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:51,651
Thank you.

146
00:10:56,947 --> 00:10:58,067
Did you take a look at this?

147
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:02,285
What if I did?

148
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:07,499
Say you didn't.

149
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:11,879
You must say no.

150
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:17,051
I regret that I didn't.

151
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:41,117
Why, of all people...

152
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:48,332
Well, that investigator is...

153
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:49,416
No need.

154
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:04,223
How can I help you?

Okay.

163
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:03,175
All right. Let me see.

164
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:06,928
All right.

165
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,266

Hey, you!

That jerk! Catch him! My...

170
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:28,826
That crazy jerk.

171
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:32,580
Why did he touch my butt?

172
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:08,092
Have you talked to anyone
about what happened today?

173
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:12,179
I saw the Grid breaking again
on my way back.

174
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:17,434
And the Grid Control Team always acts
like they're the center of the world?

175
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:22,731
But they won't be able to do that anymore
because we finally found her.

176
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:24,358
Right, Ms. Choi?

177
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:27,987
What about the NFS?
Did you keep them quiet?

178
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,948
Yes, we told them to erase
the analysis results from their memory.

179
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:37,287
Our team finally produced actual results
after almost 30 years, Ms. Choi.

180
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:41,333
Did you work in pairs
while on duty according to the rules?

181
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:43,836
- Have you ever gone alone?
- Never.

182
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:48,757
Oh, right.
I heard you're the witness to the case.

183
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:52,386
Have you personally contacted
the detectives in charge since then?

184
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:53,887
No, never.

185
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:59,435
You'll be punished accordingly if it's
revealed that you've leaked any secrets.

186
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:01,353
- Do you consent?
- I do.

187
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:03,355
Thank you.

188
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:04,440
Thank you.

189
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:18,912
We should get the murderer first
to get some clue about the Ghost, right?

190
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:23,542
We should get ready to investigate then.

191
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:26,378
Get ready to go home.

192
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:27,462
Yes, ma'am.

193
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:36,555
I guess all you care about
is going home no matter what happens.

194
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:39,266
We need to go home
to come to work the next day, Eojin.

195
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:45,898
Thank you.

196
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:55,324
A person like him is
definitely overpaid. Jeez.

197
00:17:56,992 --> 00:18:00,454
In movies, a person like him
usually turns out to be an alien

198
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:02,998
or an emperor of a star that's perished.

199
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,501
He could be an Oscar winner then.

207
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:02,409
Of course, we are.
Would you like to make a reservation?

208
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,411
<i>Is everything okay?</i>

209
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:06,413
What do you mean?

210
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:10,209
I saw that place was surrounded
by the police.

211
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:13,921
<i>Oh, they're all gone.
No police here now.</i>

212
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:16,215
<i>You can come now.
How many are in your party?</i>

213
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:17,698

- Hey, look carefully.

<i>Hello?</i>

215
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,427
Oh, no! My phone!

216
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:23,639
- Isn't it in your pocket?
- Where did it go?

217
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:27,017
Sir. I used my phone here earlier.

218
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:33,732
My phone. Did I drop it here somewhere?

219
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:36,401
- It's 10,000 won.
- Is it cool material?

220
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:37,485
It is.

221
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:39,947

SKETCH OF THE ACCOMPLICE

233
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:01,763
THE WOMAN SUDDENLY
DISAPPEARED INTO THIN AIR...

234
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:03,431
This is easy for you, isn't it?

235
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:07,227
Because you can just disappear.

236
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:09,854
Like you did before.

237
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:26,245
Who are you?

238
00:28:27,997 --> 00:28:29,624
So it's because of the woman, huh?

239
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:30,875
Not the suspect.

240
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:38,967
My eyes hurt.

241
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:43,012
What are you doing here?

242
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:45,640
Can't you see? Why are you yelling at me?

243
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:51,563
That was rude of me.

244
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:02,115
I'm sorry.

245
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:11,458
By any chance, I didn't kick you
somewhere I shouldn't, did I?

246
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:14,210
No, I'm perfectly fine.

247
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:17,589
You don't seem fine at all.

248
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:35,982
If you try to take this away
from me again,

249
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:38,818
you really won't be fine then.

250
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:51,915
Is that
the accomplice's fingerprint?

251
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:58,797
The suspect's been identified,
so I doubt you need his fingerprints.

252
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:20,735
- Hey, get down here!
- Hey, let go of the rope!

253
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:21,819
Hurry!

254
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:23,822
Gosh!

255
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:28,785
Collateral damage?

256
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:45,760
You said you got the accomplice's
fingerprints from her cap.

257
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:47,511
When did I?

258
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:49,055
In the report that you wrote.

259
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:51,266
Were they not enough?

260
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:12,311
The window frames
were gently placed on the floor yesterday.

261
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:13,954
Where is he?

262
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:15,874
<i>If the suspect
tore them out to escape,</i>

263
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:17,834
<i>they would've been broken or damaged.</i>

264
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:22,714
If his accomplice had torn them out
for him... That makes sense.

265
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:24,883
She even prepared a rope beforehand.

266
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,843
How's the investigation going?

267
00:31:29,762 --> 00:31:31,014
You don't know anything.

268
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:39,439
You must know more than I do,
seeing how you said I don't know anything.

269
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:41,274
Why do you keep
asking me questions?

270
00:31:41,357 --> 00:31:43,197
You're the one
who should be giving me answers.

271
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:46,112
You forced us to hand it over.
There must be some progress.

272
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:47,947
It is progressing.

273
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:49,031
And?

274
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:56,664
We've been excluded.
No, we'll be excluded.

275
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:59,959
It's always like that.
My team finds traces.

276
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:01,923
Then another team
carries out the investigation.

277
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:04,088
"It's always like that" means

278
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:06,633
the AB has been looking
for her for some time.

279
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:09,093
That means...

280
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:12,764
I didn't see it wrong.

281
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:15,850
No, you didn't.

282
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,313
Check the phone records.

283
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:25,318
The culprit's records?
You didn't write about that in the report.

284
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:27,862
It's because
I received the records afterwards.

285
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:37,205
I can't even read my own report
because you deleted it.

286
00:32:38,831 --> 00:32:40,792
Then you sound like you memorized it.

287
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:48,549
Wait. Was it someone else
on your team that deleted it?

288
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:51,636
Eojin didn't even get a chance to read it.

289
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:56,265
I wasn't asking if Song Eojin did.

290
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:16,169
I should've checked
the rope first yesterday.

291
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:17,787
Darn it.

292
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:22,583
Get down from there.

293
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:25,336
She disappears into thin air.

294
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:28,589
DNA or fingerprints...

295
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:32,260
Would those be of any help?

296
00:33:34,595 --> 00:33:35,638
Get down. Now.

297
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:49,110
Do you think

298
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:51,362
she's really an accomplice?

299
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,743
You know her, don't you?

300
00:33:58,661 --> 00:34:02,457
The woman I saw. You know her, don't you?

301
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:06,210
No.

302
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:08,105
This is easy for you, isn't it?
"Because you can just disappear.

303
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:12,008
Like you did before."

304
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:17,096
You said this to me earlier,
mistaking me for her.

305
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:20,892
She disappeared into thin air before
like this time,

306
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:23,561
and you saw it, didn't you?

307
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:28,690
No.

RUSTIC HANDMADE KALGUKSU

309
00:35:10,983 --> 00:35:11,983
Hello.

310
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:14,737
- Oh, welcome.
- Hi.

311
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:21,077

312
00:35:22,036 --> 00:35:23,036
Yes.

313
00:35:26,165 --> 00:35:29,210
Ma'am, your kimchi is so delicious.

314
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:30,545
Eat as much as you want.

315
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:34,048
I made a lot, and there's a lot left.

316
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:36,217
What can I get you?

317
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:39,220
One <i>sujebi</i>, please.

318
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:43,975
This kimchi is so delicious.
Why is there a lot left?

319
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:48,980
Well, something not good happened
in this area yesterday, so... Goodness.

320
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:51,524
Oh, because the news said
the culprit was living

321
00:35:51,607 --> 00:35:53,943
on the second floor of this building?

322
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:56,988
But customers don't come
for such a reason?

323
00:35:57,905 --> 00:35:59,824
I guess people are scared.

324
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:03,202
Aren't you scared, ma'am?

325
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:05,079
You must know his face.

326
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:06,998
Of course, I do.

327
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:11,294
You never know
what a person is really like, you know.

328
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:13,838
Were you and the suspect close?

329
00:36:13,921 --> 00:36:16,799
What? I barely knew him.

330
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:18,885
He just came from time to time and...

331
00:36:26,642 --> 00:36:28,102
<i>I should've just stayed quiet.</i>

332
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:30,146
<i>Goodness. Me and my big mouth.</i>

333
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:34,317
Why is it so hot
even with the AC on? Jeez.

334
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:37,987
I hope the new tenant on the second floor

335
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,158
will be a company
whose employees have lunch here.

336
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:48,456
<i>I happened to say that
the dental clinic upstairs was shut down.</i>

337
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:50,041
- When was that?
- By any chance...

338
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:53,084
Here you go.

339
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:55,046
Enjoy.

340
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:56,129
Thank you.

341
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:59,050
When was that?

342
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:02,595
I think it was a couple of months ago.

343
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:06,641
Goodness gracious. Who would've known
that he'd go live there?

344
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:08,226
Goodness.

345
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:16,317
By any chance,
have you ever seen him with a woman?

346
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:19,027
What woman?

347
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:23,282
Well, I just saw him
come and go a few times.

348
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,954
And every time, he was alone.

349
00:37:31,123 --> 00:37:33,376
What's wrong? Does it taste bad?

350
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:35,586
No. It's delicious.

351
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:38,506
But it tastes like the one I had long ago.

352
00:37:39,298 --> 00:37:42,385
Well, most old people make it
in a similar way.

353
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:43,970
Come to think of it,

354
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:49,433
the news said some woman helped him
when he was fleeing from here.

355
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:51,769
Was there was such news?

356
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:54,605
Who could it have been?

357
00:37:55,564 --> 00:37:58,693
By the way, did he really kill a person?

358
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:12,164
It's true that Kim Manok committed murder.

359
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:15,751
If you remember more about him
or happen to see him near here,

360
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:17,253
make sure to call me.

361
00:38:17,753 --> 00:38:19,755
He's a dangerous person, so be careful.

362
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:20,756
Okay.

363
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,843
And your kimchi is really the best.

364
00:38:23,926 --> 00:38:25,469
Oh, thank you.

365
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:28,055
- It was delicious.
- Bye. Thank you.

366
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:29,890
- Come again.
- Sure.

367
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:40,443
- Oh, wait. Your change...
- Later.

368
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:43,404
Oh, I really enjoyed the food too.

369
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:49,618
Can I also have your business card?

370
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:55,833
If you gave me yours first, we'd be
exchanging cards, nicely and naturally.

371
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:58,085
I thought you knew
we don't have business cards.

372
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:03,257
Is it still
like that over there?

373
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:04,341
So you do know.

374
00:39:06,802 --> 00:39:08,095
From what I remember,

375
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:10,473
Eojin used to work

376
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:14,185
in a department that handles the Grid.

377
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:16,187
Why is he looking for people now?

378
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:19,565
Because he transferred.

379
00:39:19,648 --> 00:39:22,068
I'm asking why he transferred.

380
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:27,365
Well... though it's none of my business.

381
00:39:29,992 --> 00:39:32,828
If so, why don't you ask him yourself?

382
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:36,165
That's never going to happen.

383
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:50,345

What? This is my report.

387
00:39:59,438 --> 00:40:01,440
He knows my number?

388
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:40,646
From here to here?

389
00:40:40,729 --> 00:40:41,981
Yes, all of them.

390
00:40:42,064 --> 00:40:44,567
From here to there.

391
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:50,906
It's 51,000 won.

392
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:52,408
How many forks do you need?

393
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:57,538
- Put this one back. Just one fork, please.
- Okay.

394
00:40:58,497 --> 00:40:59,957
None of them to go, right?

395
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:04,336
Yes. I have a lot of time to kill.
I'm going to eat all of them here.

00:42:48,023 --> 00:42:49,023

That uniform's a new CIRAS model.
Is it a custom one?

411
00:44:43,597 --> 00:44:45,182
There's no mark on it at all.

412
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:47,643
So what is it?

413
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:49,812
What do you mean?

414
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:20,884
The Special Investigation Bureau will take
the convenience store murder case.

415
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:22,511
- And we're...
- We're excluded?

416
00:45:24,346 --> 00:45:25,723
But our bureau found her.

417
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:27,599
Yes, finding people is our job.

418
00:45:27,683 --> 00:45:29,643
And that's where our bureau's job ends.

419
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:32,896
So are we supposed to just click
on a mouse at our desks as always?

420
00:45:33,188 --> 00:45:36,400
I can put up with other teams
looking down on us.

421
00:45:36,483 --> 00:45:39,153
But the one
we've been looking for every day...

422
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:41,113
The one we started to call the Ghost

423
00:45:41,196 --> 00:45:44,575
because we weren't even sure
if she really existed.

424
00:45:44,658 --> 00:45:46,618
We've finally found her.

425
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:48,287
But we're excluded?

426
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:53,125
It was so hard to find her, so
we should leave it to experts from here.

427
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:57,045
Mr. Song Eojin. Have you ever
carried out an investigation?

428
00:45:57,629 --> 00:45:58,797
No, because you never let me.

429
00:45:58,881 --> 00:46:03,886
You were hired to click on a mouse
to search the web at your desk.

430
00:46:03,969 --> 00:46:05,429
As an office worker.

431
00:46:05,512 --> 00:46:07,806
Not to act like a police officer.

432
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:10,434
Then why did you share all that with us?

433
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:12,644
Share what?

434
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:16,815
You knew that we'd be excluded
and that another team would take it.

435
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:18,901
You knew it before they told you.

436
00:46:18,984 --> 00:46:21,945
If we were going to take it,
we would've been busy since yesterday,

437
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:23,655
on a stakeout or investigating.

438
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:26,116
- But even yesterday, we...
- Got off work on time.

439
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:29,620
- Yes.
- You'll continue to do so.

440
00:46:29,828 --> 00:46:30,913
Don't worry.

441
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:35,834
As you said,
we've never investigated a case.

442
00:46:35,918 --> 00:46:39,296
And I'm not saying we should lead
the investigation team alone.

443
00:46:39,379 --> 00:46:42,049
But if you really think of us
as your team members,

444
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:44,885
I think you should tell us
what this is all about,

445
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:48,514
how you recognized the Ghost
just by looking at the composite sketch,

446
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:50,098
and what exactly our job is.

447
00:46:50,182 --> 00:46:53,185
We're not search engines, but your people.

448
00:47:04,112 --> 00:47:07,658
The Ghost is somewhere out there
right now.

449
00:47:08,283 --> 00:47:09,952
She might disappear again any moment.

450
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:14,289
If you have time for this,
go find more traces of her.

451
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:17,042
Dig up the murderer's past.

452
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:19,378
Find out why the Ghost is helping him

453
00:47:19,461 --> 00:47:22,089
and if there's any connection
between them.

454
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:25,300
His house, hometown, and school.
We need to go to all those places.

455
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:26,718
We have a lot of work to do.

456
00:47:26,802 --> 00:47:28,095
Get back to work.

457
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:29,763
- Ma'am.
- What?

458
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:32,641
Shall I go? To the places you just said?

459
00:47:32,724 --> 00:47:34,059
Why don't you go with her?

460
00:47:35,727 --> 00:47:36,979
I will stay here.

461
00:48:00,127 --> 00:48:02,629
Jongyi. You're having fun
at work, aren't you?

462
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:04,631
Like watching a wildfire, right?

463
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:07,092
Not only that.
I watch fights happening too.

464
00:48:07,175 --> 00:48:08,093
I apologize.

465
00:48:08,176 --> 00:48:10,387
I was overzealous
and disrespectful to you.

466
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:11,471
It's fine.

467
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:12,723
Let's go.

468
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:16,310
What the hell is he doing?

469
00:48:20,439 --> 00:48:22,357
I'll make sure it won't happen again.

470
00:48:24,484 --> 00:48:25,819
Get your hands off.

471
00:48:27,863 --> 00:48:28,863
I'm sorry.

472
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:44,755
I should be embarrassed, right?

473
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:48,467
I wasn't supposed to see you
kissing up to her, right?

474
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:56,475
I'll be back sometime after one.

475
00:48:56,558 --> 00:48:58,268
- Oh, we're also...
- See you, ma'am.

476
00:49:00,812 --> 00:49:02,773
Why would you want to go out with her?

477
00:49:07,027 --> 00:49:08,111
Let's go now.

478
00:49:40,852 --> 00:49:42,932
SOMEONE ENTERED YOUR OFFICE TWICE
DURING YOUR ABSENCE

479
00:50:05,377 --> 00:50:06,753
What are you doing?
