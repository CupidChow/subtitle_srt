00:00:49,924 --> 00:00:50,924
Please.

2
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:53,303
Please.

3
00:00:57,807 --> 00:00:59,059
Damn it.

4
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:40,099
DIRECTOR

5
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:44,437
Sir, this is Kim Saeha.

6
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:47,016
There's something
I must tell you in person right now.

7
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:49,859
No, not later.

8
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:54,614
It's about the woman.

9
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:57,951
No, I must tell you now...

10
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:00,829
This is Jung Saebyeok from Songje Station.

11
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:04,165
There's important information
that I only gave to Ms. Choi.

12
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,918
And I think I should tell you too,

13
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:10,296
now that Ms. Choi
can no longer report it to you.

14
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:12,757
Yes, it's about the woman.

15
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:15,801
Okay.

RESEARCHER 1: How is this possible?

18
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:27,522
RESEARCHER 2: What's wrong?

19
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:31,192
RESEARCHER 1: Director.

20
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:35,572
RESEARCHER 2: How did this end up here?

21
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:45,456
All right. What is it?

22
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:54,214
Come on in.

23
00:02:57,635 --> 00:02:58,635
Now,

24
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:00,805
what is it about?

25
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:07,729
Hey, Kim Saeha.

26
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:11,222
Hey, Kim Saeha!
- SAEBYEOK: Down on the floor.

27
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,232
Saebyeok. Don't!

28
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,611
You can't.
- Don't move.

29
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,919
Major, there's a problem in the lab.

30
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,799
DIRECTOR JO HEUNGSIK

31
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:54,192
EOJIN: Saebyeok,

32
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,361
you shouldn't get involved in this.

33
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:57,737
Shut it.

34
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:03,076
Not one more step.

35
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:05,161
Shut up. Don't come closer.

36
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:06,995
Saeha.

37
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,040
Let Saebyeok go.

38
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:13,211
Do you think I was dragged in here?

39
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,004
Don't say anything.

40
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,168
MR. JO: Don't say anything.

41
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:18,091
Not another word.

42
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:34,649
What did you do to my mom?

43
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:36,025
Your mom…

44
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:39,528
Your mom…

45
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:44,075
Is already dead.

46
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:56,536
AGENT: <i>It seems they destroyed
the access device.</i>

47
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:58,306
<i>Even the security office
can't open the door.</i>

48
00:04:58,339 --> 00:04:59,339
All right.

49
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:08,099
What's the matter?
What happened on the 13th floor?

50
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:13,187
Who said you could touch that?

51
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:20,903
What the hell?

52
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:23,323
What did you put in there?

53
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:36,919
She's dead.

54
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,299
There's only one way
to bring her back to life.

55
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:05,365
MR. JO: No. Don't be fooled.
She won't save your mom.

56
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:06,949
Why kill her in the first place then?

57
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,117
Don't you think?

58
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:09,576
Believe me.

59
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:12,455
I'll overlook what you've done to me.
What do you say?

60
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:16,042
Are you crazy?

61
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:18,336
This is an opportunity we mustn't lose!

62
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:21,172
The future of humanity depends on it!

63
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:25,176
Wait. Hey!

64
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:27,929
You will not get away with this.
Both of you!

65
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:32,141
I'm going to make you rot in prison
for the rest of your lives! I will...

66
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:41,359
I already injected a lot.

67
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:45,154
This will be lethal.

68
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:48,825
Don't do it, Eojin.

69
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,868
If she gets it back, it's over.

70
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,330
Don't you know
what we've sacrificed for this?

71
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:11,889
What are they…

72
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:39,666
Get up.

73
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:45,923
Implant it.

74
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:53,514
No. You're going too far.

75
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,559
Implant it in me!

76
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:18,539
SAEHA: <i>With it, I can do anything.</i>

77
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:19,999
I can bring everyone back to life.

78
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:21,709
Ms. Choi, my father,

79
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:23,211
<i>and even my mom.</i>

00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:07,481
Mr. Kwon?

85
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:09,692
Are you going home now?

86
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:11,985
Oh!

87
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:14,405
You're hurt.

88
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:17,241
My. How did this happen?

89
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:18,826
It was Sunday.

90
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:19,785
Thank you.

91
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:22,121

so don't come out until I get back.

98
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:07,875
We'll go home afterward,
so wait just a little longer.

99
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:39,782
SUKEUN: Yes, I had dinner a while ago.

100
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:41,575
Just something simple.

101
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:53,461
SAEHA: I'm sorry.

102
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:55,631
It'll just be a minute.

103
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:57,173
SUKEUN: Yes.

104
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,593
I can sleep in the night-duty room.

105
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:03,096
Okay. Bye.

106
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:29,790
Oh, no.

107
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:31,751
Doctor!

108
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,837
What happened? Doctor!

109
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,964
Help! Someone's hurt!

110
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:37,882
Dad.

111
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:40,134
Is anybody there? Please help!

112
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:47,098
An ambulance…

113
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:58,986
There's someone unconscious here.

114
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:00,780
This is…

115
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:03,699
I'm calling from Laboratory 1.
Call 911 right now…

116
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:10,747
Who are you?

Hey!

120
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:40,253
Mr. Kwon.

121
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,298
Call 911 now. He's still alive.

122
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:43,799
I already did.

123
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:45,885
But what happened to…

124
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:19,186
KWON SUKEUN

125
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:32,866
Hey, son.

126
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:38,998
I know. When you got up from your nap,
I was already gone, wasn't I?

127
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:40,958
I'm sorry.

128
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:45,921
I'm on night duty.

129
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:50,133
Night duty?

130
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:53,095
That means
I have to spend the night at work.

131
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:57,933
Yes, I can't go home
until tomorrow morning.

I won't be long,
so don't come out, all right?

135
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:56,658
Who are you?

136
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:59,203
So this is what the initial program
looks like.

137
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:00,996
We don't use it.

138
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:05,667
Who are you? How do you know that?

139
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:08,211
Interesting.

140
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:10,809
That's what I've always
wanted to ask you.

141
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:12,174
You know me?

142
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:13,926
Of course I do…

143
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:15,469
Murderer.

144
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:26,271
You think you're the savior of mankind,
don't you?

00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,654
<i>Why did you come back and kill him?</i>

148
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:35,489
Why do you keep saying I killed someone?

149
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:41,370
When you could tell me why,
I wasn't able to ask.

150
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:44,414
Now that I can, you have no idea.

151
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,416
How crappy.

152
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:54,091
Who you are, really?

153
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:56,760
You don't recognize me

154
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:59,263
when everyone mistakes me for him.

155
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:03,851
That means
you weren't specifically after my father.

156
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:06,311
You just needed that ID card.

157
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:17,406
Nothing has changed.

158
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,879
SAEHA: <i>You and everyone at this institute</i>

159
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:34,631
<i>treated people like expendable parts.</i>

160
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:38,969
But he was a living person.

161
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,055
He studied all his life

162
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,310
and just began to live a decent life.

163
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:52,941
I heard he was so happy
to have gotten a job at this institute.

164
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:58,739
Then your father is…

165
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:00,699
That's right.

166
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:04,499
My father, whose face
has faded from my memory.

167
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:08,749
He had a child and a wife.

168
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:14,254
He wasn't someone who could
be sacrificed for the mighty Grid.

169
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:44,368

197
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,668
She's my mother.

Is she not here?

199
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:27,883
There's no one by that name here.

200
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,511
Are you saying she's never worked here?

201
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:32,595
Yes.

202
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:36,475
Right? She doesn't work here.

203
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,518
Thank you.

211
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:48,732
What's that?
- Don't go out!

212
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:53,987
You mustn't go outside.
- What's happening outside?

213
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,780
What? Why not?

214
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:58,617
Is there a basement here?
A basement with running water?

215
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,910
Yes, there is. The cafeteria.

My.

245
00:29:59,672 --> 00:30:00,882
Why are you soaking wet?

246
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:03,760
And why are you wearing shoes

247
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:08,096

Mom.

250
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:16,815
Yes?

251
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:21,027
Your body is burning hot.

252
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:22,487
You must be running a fever.

253
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:25,573
Go upstairs and get changed.
And soak in a hot bath.

254
00:30:26,282 --> 00:30:27,826
You'll catch a cold like a kid.

255
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:31,161

SAEHA'S MOM: Your dad is home!

259
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:06,252
You're home early.
You must've parted early.

260
00:34:06,335 --> 00:34:08,212
We only had dinner.

261
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,381
What's that?

262
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:13,468
Oh, Saeha seems to have a slight cold.

263
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,220
Are you not feeling well?

264
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:19,098
You're home.
- SUKEUN: Yes.

265
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:26,355
He doesn't have a fever though.

266
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:29,484
When I tell you my whole body aches,
you just ignore it.

267
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:31,152
Look how devoted you are to your son.

268
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:34,822
Of course. You're over 60.
It's normal for your body to ache.

269
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:36,365
That's just natural.

270
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:38,951
Drink up.
- Okay.

271
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,090
Okay.

272
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:12,318
Just leave it.
Your clothes will get dirty.

273
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:22,453
So this is how short you were.

274
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:25,164
You see me every day,
but you realize that now?

275
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:30,128
Be grateful that you didn't inherit
your height from me.

276
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:37,486
Are you coming with us?

277
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:41,698
Yes.

278
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:43,826
Okay. Then get in.

279
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:12,911
You'll be alone when the Korean
Food and Drug Administration come.

280
00:37:13,814 --> 00:37:17,318
They only need to test three samples
this time, so I can handle it.

281
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:18,861
SUKEUN: Okay.

282
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:21,447
You've been in charge
of quality control anyway.

283
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:24,768
SAEHA'S MOM: I hope they send
a quick-witted one this time.

284
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:28,204

work as a civil servant?

344
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:47,025
Where did it go?

345
00:49:48,527 --> 00:49:50,028
Have you seen my gown here?

346
00:49:50,904 --> 00:49:53,949
You were wearing…
No, you were carrying it earlier.

347
00:49:55,117 --> 00:49:56,493
I was? When?

348
00:49:57,327 --> 00:49:59,287
Just now. On your way to the laboratory.

349
00:50:00,372 --> 00:50:01,707
I've been here all along.

350
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:04,584

351
00:50:06,586 --> 00:50:08,797

- Did you see someone?

352
