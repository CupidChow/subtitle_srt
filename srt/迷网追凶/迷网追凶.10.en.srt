00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,220
EPISODE 10

4
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,560
(thrilling music)

5
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,940
Two murders and one assault.

6
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,650
I've agreed to step down if we lose him,
so we must not lose him.

7
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:08,400
Not because of our bureau's mistake.

8
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:09,450
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

9
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:11,160
The Ghost is where Kim Manok is.

10
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,370
You all wanted to go out to the field.

11
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:17,160
This is your chance.

12
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,080
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

13
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,040
(elevator dings)

14
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,060
About what we heard
at the lobby earlier...

15
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,770
Was Ms. Choi mistaken?

16
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:43,770
A misunderstanding?

17
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:51,490
Do you also want us
to pretend to be deaf and dumb?

18
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,320
No.

19
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:57,950
I think, Ms. Chae,
he just answered your question.

20
00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:59,450
I think so too.

21
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,420
He doesn't deny it.

22
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:04,080
(scoffs)

23
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:09,210
Why did she bring you back so soon?
There must've been a lot to find out.

24
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,760
(elevator dings)

25
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,600
MS. CHOI:
<i>Let's use Kwon Saeha as bait too.</i>

26
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,190
If it wasn't the Ghost who released Manok
and she still needs him,

27
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:27,440
she'll show up.

28
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:28,820
No.

29
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:34,320
Even if that's the case,
she wouldn't come here voluntarily.

30
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,620
Then we should let him out.

31
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,500
The culprit?

32
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,080
And him?

33
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:54,380
I think you should see this.

34
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,180
106 MICROTESLA

35
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:01,060
(thrilling music)

36
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,520
106 MICROTESLA

37
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,060
SAEHA: <i>Let's use Kwon Saeha...</i>

38
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,190
...as bait too.

39
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,030
(sighs)

40
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,570
He's not completely useless.

41
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:17,320
(panting)

42
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:18,700
MS. CHOI: <i>Along with the culprit.</i>

43
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:22,410
<i>It's time to put
all our cards on the table.</i>

44
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,460
(panting)

45
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,640

(beeping continues)

50
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,470
MS. CHOI: Find all organisms

51
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,480
emitting over 100 microteslas
of electromagnetic radiation.

52
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,020
-What's the upper limit?
-No limit.

53
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,270
(keyboard clicking)

54
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,320
Are you sure the Founder emits
electromagnetic radiation?

55
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,990
You're also a scientist.

56
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:43,120
<i>What's the normal level of electromagnetic
radiation emitted by a human?</i>

57
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,700
HEAD OF GRID MANAGEMENT TEAM:
<i>You don't need a scientist for that.</i>

58
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:46,330
RESEARCHER: I think you should see this.

59
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:48,290
HEAD OF GRID MANAGEMENT TEAM:
<i>A normal person emits a very small amount.</i>

60
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:49,960
<i>Over 100? That means...</i>

61
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:53,090
this person has frequently been
exposed to magnetic fields.

62
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:54,380
Exactly.

63
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,260
There, 106!

64
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,340
(computer beeping)

65
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:00,640
No, that's Kwon Saeha.

66
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:04,100
The measurement has to be
much higher than this.

67
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,680
Please.

68
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:10,230
EOJIN (over radio): <i>Let's split.</i>

69
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:11,650
<i>Ms. Chae.</i>

70
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:13,110
Mr. Kwon.

71
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,820
Whatever you do, do it alone.

72
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,070
-Don't drag Saebyeok...
-I won't drag you into anything.

73
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:27,580
(suspenseful music)

74
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,480
<i>Alpha has appeared. 34K3756.</i>

75
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:05,330
That way!

76
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,000
MAJOR (over radio): <i>That's 34K3756. 3755!</i>

77

(computer beeping)

79
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:40,940
C1 and C2, stay in your position.
You're to watch for Beta.

80
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,040

81
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,170
MAJOR: Over there.

82
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:57,670
Alpha.

83
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,130
Alpha 25K1754.

84
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,630
He's right next to Beta.

85
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:03,050
(panting)

86
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,390

00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,120
Damn it.

90
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,240
Halt. Stand by.

91
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,620

94
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,970
Inform us of Beta's position. I repeat.

<i>Inform us of Beta's position again.
We don't see him here.</i>

96

He's right between you two!

(device beeping)

98
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:11,410

99
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,670
-(grunting)
-Beta has removed the GPS tracker.

100
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:17,750

SAEHA: <i>Tell me this is the only way.</i>

121
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,080
Tell me this is worth it.

122
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,830
As long as the sun exists,
the solar wind is a threat.

123
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:03,540
Both to your generation

124
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:05,540
and mine.

125
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,590
Did many people die in your time too?

126
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,470
(inhales deeply)

127
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,100
They would

128
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,760
without the Grid.

129
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,730
How many more
need to be sacrificed to complete it?

130
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:30,690
Are there more left?

131
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,150
Among the people I know?

(somber music)

133
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,850
We've repeated this dozens of times.

134

To find another way.

135
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,900
Though it doesn't matter since
you are all people in the past to me.

136
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:13,780
Yes.

137
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,610
It's for us to be born.

138
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:19,820
For my mom and me.

139
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:21,660
Then what about my mom?

140
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,450
If I'm gone too...

141
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:28,580
If she has no one to look after her...

(device whirs)

143
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:35,760
I'm not going to die for you.

144
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,970
Figure something out
for your mom yourself.

145
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:38,890
(snorts)

146
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:40,140
You're shameless.

(scoffs)

148
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,510
I know.

149
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,150
When will it happen?

150
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:53,480
When will I...

151
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:59,450
How much time do I have left?

152
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:09,000

Are you okay?

175
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,010
Detective. What are you doing here?

176
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:46,800
Why that...

177
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:48,380
Kwon Saeha!

178
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,680
He came this way for sure.

179
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:57,390
-I mean Kim Manok.
-Yes, he's nearby.

180
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,690
Did you let him go on purpose?

181
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:04,610
A murderer in this crowded place?

182
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,190
That's why you shouldn't be here.

183
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,240
(exhales deeply)

184
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:09,950
SAEBYEOK: Where is that bastard?

185
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,740
My higher-ups already know
that you're here.

186
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,300
Northwest?

187
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:25,800
It's that way.

188
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:32,550
Kim Manok recognized me.

189
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,890
How all of a sudden?

190
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,190
MAN 1: Hey!

191
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:45,400
Beta has removed the GPS tracker.
He's out of our sight.

192
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,690
Is the deputy director out of her mind?

193
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:51,570
She's your boss. How could she put you
in danger instead of protecting you?

194
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:54,910
Let me see.

195
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,200
Did he do this?

196
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:58,910
Did he?

197
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:01,920
Kim Manok must be full of spite now.

198
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,960
(pants)

199
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:11,630
So you must be careful too.
He's more dangerous than ever.

200
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:14,050
That piece of trash.

201
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:17,180
Whatever happened when he was little,

202
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:19,980
he's been like that because he was
hopeless in the first place.

203
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,560
I should've shot him when I first saw him.

204
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:31,240
-Did something happen?
-Nothing between me and that jerk.

205
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:36,870
You didn't

206
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,580
happen to spot Manok, did you?

207
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,830
You came
to the Administration Bureau, right?

208
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:45,000
(sighs)

209
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:46,840
Why?

210
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:54,220
I...

211
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:00,100
He and I...

212
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,640
Go on.

213
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,690
There's something I have to check.

214
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,650
And if it turns out to be true,

215
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,280
I'll nip it in the bud.

216
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,210
What the hell...

217
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:28,130
What is it you have to check?

218
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:29,500
We'll lose him. Let's go.

219
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,630
(foreboding music)

220
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:06,620
(device whirs)

221
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:24,350
(suspenseful music)

222
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,580
(device whirs)

223
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,840
(suspenseful music)

224
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:32,460
(suspenseful music continues)

225
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:03,490
(device whirs)

226
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:11,960
(grunts)

227
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:29,020
(suspenseful music continues)

228
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:42,910
(grunts)

229
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:51,160
(train horn honks)

230
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:02,550
(gunfire)

231
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,900
(foreboding music)

232
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:21,030
-(thuds)
-(breathing heavily)

233
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:33,960
SAEBYEOK: No.

234
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,260
-MAN 2: What was that noise?
-SAEBYEOK: Call 911.

235
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,430
-MAN 2: What?
-Please call 911.

236
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:46,590
-My gosh.
-Call 911.

237
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,890
MAN 2: Hurry up! Over here!

238
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:51,310
Look at me, Saeha.

239
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:54,140
Saeha. Look at me.

240
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:57,610
You'll be fine.

241
00:23:58,860 --> 00:23:59,860
Just keep breathing.

242
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:03,820
(breathing calmly)

243
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:09,780
You'll be fine.

244
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,370
They'll come save you soon.

245
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,460
You can't die because of me.

246
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:20,880
You...

247
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,350
You knew...

248
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:34,270
(somber music)

249
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:44,490
(sobbing)

250
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:50,200
JONGYI: Saeha.

251
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,450
(sobs)

252
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,320
MS. CHOI: <i>The Ghost is right next to you.</i>

253
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:30,240
Ms. Choi...

254
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:33,410
-Saeha is...
-JONGYI: <i>She's right next to you!</i>

255
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,120
(sobs)

256
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,290
(device beeping)

257
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:49,010
(tense music)

258
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,510
(in English)
It's not me. Can't you see it?

259
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:39,220
(crackling)

260
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:54,160
(light music)

261
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,620
(device whirs)

262
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:58,970
SAEBYEOK (in Korean):
<i>You'll save him, right?</i>

263
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:03,730
<i>You're here to save him, right?</i>

264
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,320
<i>Are we really connected?</i>

265
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:21,740
(crackling)

266
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,260
(gasping)

267
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:37,090
-What happened?
-There were people here.

268
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:39,090
-Where did they go?
-I don't know.

269
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:41,810
-They were here for sure.
-Where did they go?

270
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:46,270
(indistinct chatter)

271
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:55,070
SAEBYEOK: Why?

272
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:56,740
Why?

273
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:01,280
I can't find her. We've lost her.

274
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:04,790
Go back one minute.

275
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,120
(computer beeping rapidly)

276
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:10,250
Is it broken?

277
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,790
That can't be. What's wrong with this?

278
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:15,840
(computer trilling)

279
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:37,610
It wasn't just one.

280
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,200
JONGYI: <i>Ms. Choi.</i>

281
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:41,070
<i>Saeha is dead.</i>

282
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:47,450
<i>Ms. Choi. Can't you hear me?</i>

283
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:22,280
CONDOLENCES

284
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,250
LATE KWON SAEHA

285
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:45,850
KWON SUKEUN GRAVE

286
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:48,850
Goodness.

287
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:55,770
WOMAN: She's outlived not only
her husband but also her son.

288
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:58,530
How is she going to live now? Goodness.

289
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:01,530
How unfortunate for her.

290
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:10,370
(phone rings)

291
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,420
You took him.

292
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:19,840
You.

293
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:24,300
I clearly told you
that I wouldn't allow it.

294
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:25,680
(Saeha's mom sobbing)

295
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:30,560
I told you I didn't want my son to work
for the IRR or the Administration Bureau.

296
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:33,350
But you made...

297
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:36,190
You made him work...

298
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:40,480
at the place where his father died.

299
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:41,990
Didn't you?

300
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,570
He said he was on leave.

301
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:49,080
Why did he suddenly go to work? Why?

302
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:55,040
Why was a public officer
beaten to death by a murderer?

303
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,210
Why?

304
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:01,460
What on earth were you guys
doing then? Why?

305
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:06,510
-You took him!
-Yes, go ahead, sir. It's okay.

306
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:09,140
(Saeha's mom crying)

307
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:19,480
Then there were two of them, not just one.

308
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:21,270
It wasn't an error.

309
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:24,950
We'll keep searching.

310
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,610
But I don't see the point of it.

311
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:29,570
What do you mean, why?

312
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:31,990
Only the Grid Control Team
has the facilities.

313
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:36,410
How can the Secretariat afford such
pricey machines with our current budget?

314
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:38,540
I'll tell you when I get back.

315
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:41,380
No, we're done here.

316
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,750
Yes, sir.

317
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,550
Open it.

318
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,760
(car alarm beeps)

319
00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:24,920
(car lock clicks)

320
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,350
Can you drop me off on the way?

321
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,600
I'm going home.

322
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:37,060
Then drop me off there.

323
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:52,030
MEMORIAL GATE

324
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,500
SAEBYEOK: Are you going to take a cab?

325
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,250
We're almost here.

326
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:03,340
EOJIN: Yes.

327
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:12,760
Thanks.

328
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,560
Do you want to have a drink?

329
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:52,150
(phone buzzing)

330
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:04,540
Yes?

331
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:11,420
Hello?

332
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:17,390
EOJIN (over phone): <i>The deputy director
pushed him to admit it.</i>

333
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,800
<i>That's how I found out what he had done.</i>

334
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,640
What are you talking about?

335
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:29,310
EOJIN (over phone): <i>Kwon Saeha.</i>

336
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:35,030
<i>I was going to ask him that evening
how he was entangled with Kim Manok.</i>

337
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:40,160
<i>I was determined not to let him go
until he gave me a proper answer.</i>

338
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,170
Where are you?

339
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:51,840
But why do I have to ask you about this?

340
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,210
How do you know all this?

341
00:36:57,430 --> 00:36:59,760
Why are you the only one left to ask?

342
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,110
(approaching footsteps)

343
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:20,570
SAEBYEOK: Did you drink all evening?

344
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,200
Alone?

345
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,620
You turned me down, so...

346
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:37,420
(breathes deeply)

347
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,930
I didn't like him.

348
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:43,470
I never liked Kwon Saeha
even before he got involved with you.

349
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:49,980
Involved?
I didn't even know him that well.

350
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:52,940
I wish I hadn't known him at all.

351
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,730
Then he wouldn't have died.

352
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:58,490
He'd be sad to hear that.

353
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:03,700
You're pretty much the only person
who remembers him properly.

354
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:10,420
At first, I thought
he was just acting tough.

355
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,370
SAEHA: You can kill me later.

356
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:13,250
If I use it for some other purpose,

357
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:14,500
you can shoot me. I don't care.

358
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:16,630
When he told me to kill him...

359
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:20,130
I thought he was saying
such a thing so easily.

360
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,980
There's old footage
on the 13th floor of your office.

361
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:31,810
All the information about her is
on the 13th floor of my office building.

362
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:34,480
Footage of the woman
when she first appeared in 1997.

363
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:37,570
You saw that?

364
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,910
SAEBYEOK: <i>In the footage, the woman kills</i>

365
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:45,160
<i>Kim Manok's foster father.</i>

366
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,290
<i>And someone helps her.</i>

367
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:50,460
That must be Kwon Saeha.

368
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:54,830
Why did she kill him?

369
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:57,090
If she hadn't, neither the woman

370
00:38:58,090 --> 00:38:59,420
nor the Grid would exist.

371
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:02,880
You too.

372
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:08,260
Why me?

373
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:12,770
You captured the woman.

374
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:15,860
And while doing so...

375
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:17,730
(bomb ticking)

376
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:19,440
(explosion)

377
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,200
<i>...you were hurt.</i>

378
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,280
Seriously.

379
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:32,040
I guess that's how
he could go back in time.

380
00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:37,130
If I had been fine, I wouldn't have
given up the chance for anyone.

381
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:38,920
You helped him.

382
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:44,130
No way. Do I look like the type?

383
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:45,340
SAEBYEOK: Song Eojin.

384
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:47,050
You helped your colleague

385
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:49,390
and saved me.

386
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,940
Was it worth it?

387
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:04,320
I don't know exactly what happened
in the past either.

388
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:07,370
But time was turned back,

389
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,410
and you came back to life.

390
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,410
Though I'm not sure
if that's the right way to put it.

391
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:15,420
But...

392
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:22,420
the person who turned back time
suffered a bigger loss while doing it.

393
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:26,010
Even after that...

394
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:30,810
his family was constantly used
by the Administration Bureau.

395
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:37,150
It must have been
how Mr. Kwon felt all his life.

396
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:42,070
He was ready to die at any time.

397
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,990
He lost his dad as a child,

398
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:50,450
managed to grow up...

399
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,500
and eventually died like that.

400
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:02,250
(inhales sharply)

401
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:04,170
I wish he had just lived his own life.

402
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:06,630
Why couldn't he?

403
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:23,980
(exhales deeply)

404
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:27,700
Get up. I'll take you home.

405
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:35,080
Though I don't know where to take you.

406
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:40,920
We were married for seven years,
and I don't even know where you live.

407
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:46,710
But lately, we see each other

408
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:49,180
pretty often.

409
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:54,470
Right.

410
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:15,410
Now that it's all over,

411
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:18,330
let's become strangers again.

412
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:21,420
Is that what you wanted to tell me?

413
00:42:24,590 --> 00:42:26,590
If you come see me
like nothing has happened,

414
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,510
I'll have to act like that too.

415
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:40,730
I don't want to go back to the old days.

416
00:42:53,910 --> 00:42:54,910
So that was...

417
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,160
when it happened.

418
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:05,750
The other day...

419
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:10,800
you suddenly asked me if I was okay.

420
00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:19,220
That's when it must've happened.

421
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:49,300
(dramatic music)

422
00:43:59,510 --> 00:44:01,310
It wasn't just a bad dream.

423
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:55,820
(tense music)

424
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:58,660
MS. CHOI: <i>The Secretariat is reborn today.</i>

425
00:44:59,490 --> 00:45:01,780
<i>We turned from
an insignificant secondary department</i>

426
00:45:01,870 --> 00:45:05,290
<i>to the core department, recognized
for its competence and importance.</i>

427
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:07,500
<i>But we mustn't be content with it.</i>

428
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:11,630
<i>After time passes, those who try
to diminish our power will rise again.</i>

429
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:15,010
<i>To stop them, we must always
produce satisfactory results.</i>

430
00:45:15,090 --> 00:45:17,970
<i>We must produce concrete results.</i>

431
00:45:18,050 --> 00:45:19,340
AGENTS: <i>Yes, ma'am!</i>

432
00:45:29,230 --> 00:45:30,940
1 YEAR LATER

433
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:33,070
OLD LADY 1:
Just grill and eat one of them.

434
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:35,690
OLD LADY 2: They're for sale.

435
00:45:35,990 --> 00:45:36,940
OLD LADY 1: My goodness.

436
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:41,370
You won't live forever.
Stop living like that.

437
00:45:49,170 --> 00:45:51,500
-Gosh. Your mom is here.
-(baby cries)

438
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,040
Mommy.

439
00:45:53,130 --> 00:45:54,380
My goodness.

440
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:58,130
Sweetie. Your mom is here.

441
00:45:58,220 --> 00:45:59,470
Are you finished?

442
00:45:59,550 --> 00:46:01,340
-Yes, I'm done.
-OLD LADY 1: I see.

443
00:46:01,430 --> 00:46:03,300
Oh, my daughter. Did you have fun today?

444
00:46:03,390 --> 00:46:04,600
Time to go home.

445
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:07,640
She's just a baby.
She doesn't know what's fun yet.

446
00:46:07,730 --> 00:46:09,230
(chuckles)

447
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:13,900
Thank you for looking after her.

448
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:15,520
Don't mention it.

449
00:46:15,610 --> 00:46:18,360
I'm doing this because you pay me.

450
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:20,280
-I'll get going then.
-OLD LADY 1: Okay.

451
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:24,240
Oh, right. I left some scorpionfish
in the kitchen, so snack on them.

452
00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:25,990
Thank you, as always.

453
00:46:26,790 --> 00:46:27,910
-I'll be off.
-Bye.

454
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,580
(baby cries)

455
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:08,830
Oh, dear.

456
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:11,710
It's time to eat.

457
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:14,920
-(chuckles)
-(baby cries)

458
00:47:15,330 --> 00:47:16,210
All right.

459
00:47:22,550 --> 00:47:24,840
Ooh. Ooh...

460
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:27,510
You're eating so well, my daughter.

461
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:28,850
You must've been hungry.

462
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:43,070
(kettle whistles)

463
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:44,740
(sighs)
My daughter.

464
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:50,410
When will you grow up
and follow me to the sea to see me work...

465
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:54,750
and to many other places?

466
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:00,630
I hope time passes quickly...

467
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:07,680
No.

468
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:10,600
Time doesn't flow.

469
00:48:13,270 --> 00:48:14,440
That's not how it worked.

470
00:48:17,150 --> 00:48:18,150
Time...

471
00:48:18,230 --> 00:48:21,150
-(kettle whistles)
-(baby coos)

472
00:48:26,950 --> 00:48:28,950
(tense music)

473
00:48:29,030 --> 00:48:30,990
(kettle whistling continues)

474
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:33,330
(device whirs)

475
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:44,880
(whirring)

476
00:48:44,970 --> 00:48:47,050
(crackling)

477
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:52,100
(tires screech)

478
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:02,440
Let's go. You need to leave here.

479
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:05,240
What are you saying,
popping out of the blue?

480
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:06,610
I'll explain on the way.

481
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:08,820
If you don't leave now,
you and Byeori will be in danger.

482
00:49:09,950 --> 00:49:11,160
How do you know her name?

483
00:49:12,030 --> 00:49:12,990
Who told you?

484
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:16,830
You did.

485
00:49:16,910 --> 00:49:18,920
(foreboding music)

486
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:34,270
(kettle whistling)

487
00:49:36,930 --> 00:49:38,940
(suspenseful music)

488
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:51,990
SAEBYEOK: <i>Maybe this child isn't the one.</i>

489
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:56,750
<i>Even when she's grown up
and a long time after that,</i>

490
00:49:57,580 --> 00:49:59,370
<i>maybe nothing will happen.</i>

491
00:50:02,170 --> 00:50:04,000
<i>But I've made my decision...</i>

492
00:50:05,050 --> 00:50:07,380
<i>to finish what hasn't even begun yet.</i>

493
00:50:08,970 --> 00:50:13,640
<i>Just like our traces have been erased,
we don't see the path ahead of us.</i>

494
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:17,850
(kettle whistling)

495
00:50:20,690 --> 00:50:21,520
(button clicks)

496
00:50:22,150 --> 00:50:24,440
(whistling faded)

497
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:31,070
SAEBYEOK: <i>Drinkable water, breathable air,</i>

498
00:50:31,950 --> 00:50:35,660
<i>thick forests,
and many living things in them.</i>

499
00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:38,040
I couldn't prepare
a car seat for the baby.

500
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:43,460
SAEBYEOK: <i>This child may not be able
to enjoy those things in the future.</i>

501
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:45,920
<i>Even without the solar wind,</i>

502
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:51,680
<i>we've already taken so many things
from future children.</i>

503
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:55,800
<i>If I can give even
one of those things back...</i>

504
00:50:57,010 --> 00:51:00,600
<i>If my choice can protect them...</i>

505
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:03,400
<i>But...</i>

506
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:08,980
<i>I didn't expect that day to come so soon.</i>

507
00:51:09,610 --> 00:51:11,610
(ominous music)

508
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:18,330
(explosion)

509
00:51:26,590 --> 00:51:28,090
(glass shattering)

510
00:51:32,010 --> 00:51:33,590
(explosion)

511
00:51:37,390 --> 00:51:39,680
Sir. It's all set.

512
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:44,770
(explosion)

513
00:52:02,290 --> 00:52:04,210
MAN 3: The Grid is all gone.

514
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:06,790
From all the times and layers.

515
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:13,920
(in English)
You never know.

516
00:52:14,010 --> 00:52:16,010
(thrilling music)

517
00:52:35,150 --> 00:52:36,240
(in Korean)
No one knows.

518
00:52:39,370 --> 00:52:41,160
Is there really an end?

519
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:52,840
(foreboding music)

520
00:53:21,910 --> 00:53:23,910
(suspenseful music)

521
00:53:44,430 --> 00:53:46,430
(closing theme music)
