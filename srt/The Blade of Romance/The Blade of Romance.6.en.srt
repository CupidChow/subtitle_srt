00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,840
[Episode 6]

3
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:16,320
Stop!

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:18,760
Who are you?

5
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:19,600
[Ye Xiyao,
daughter of the Prime Minister]

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,120
What are you doing

7
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,480
in Zhiyuan's courtyard?

8
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,610
This is where I live.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:23,840
And who are you?

10
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:24,970
That's impossible!

11
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,560
I bet you're here

12
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,620
to seduce Zhiyuan.

13
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:28,920
You shameless hussy!

14
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:32,640
How dare you hit me!

15
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,700
So what if I hit you?

16
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,600
I am the Prime Minister's daughter.

17
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,760
How dare you be so insolent!

18
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,840
Aggressive, reckless, and utterly vulgar!

19
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,360
You've truly

20
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,220
embarrassed the Prime Minister.

21
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,320
Zhiyuan.

22
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,160
This woman

23
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,680
came out of your courtyard.

24
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,010
She even dared to hit me.

25
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,570
Are you alright?

26
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,160
Zhiyuan.

27
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,960
Who is she anyway?

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,800
She is Wen Rou.

29
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,440
Zhiyuan.

30
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,130
Brother.

31
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,039
She suddenly barged in just now,

32
00:01:10,039 --> 00:01:11,680
I didn't mean to hurt her.

33
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:13,560
Just some insignificant person,

34
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,960
no big deal if she got hit.

35
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,280
Wen Rou?

36
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,560
[Hot Spring Palace]

37
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:29,690
Sit down.

38
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,080
Have some tea.

39
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:31,650
Alright.

40
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,660
Your Highness.

41
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,320
His Majesty has arrived
at the Hot Spring Palace

42
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,800
to escape the cold, accompanied by
the imperial consorts and court officials.

43
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,479
The Empress

44
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:45,560
knows that Princess Wen Rou
is recovering from a serious illness

45
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,160
and has arranged for Her Highness

46
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,400
to visit the hot springs tonight

47
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,840
to bathe in the medicinal waters
for her health.

48
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,080
Let Qiuhe accompany you.

49
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:52,680
All right.

50
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,920
Why are you holding a lantern?

51
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,800
This was specially
prepared for Your Highness.

52
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,080
Your Highness, have you forgotten

53
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,720
that today is the Winter Solstice?

54
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,600
In our Liang State,
we have a tradition of hanging lanterns

55
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,360
on Winter Solstice to pray for blessings.

56
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,820
If Your Highness likes it,

57
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,440
why not hang one?

58
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,240
There's a rumor in the palace

59
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,360
that Wen Rou accidentally
hit her head and lost her memory.

60
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,890
No wonder she didn't
come to see us yesterday.

61
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,650
Lost her memory?

62
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,960
Could something have happened

63
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,040
when she was stealing the military token?

64
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,120
But if Weiwei's identity was exposed,

65
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,000
Wen Zhiyuan

66
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,040
would have done something about it.

67
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,360
I'll find a chance

68
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,320
to see her again,

69
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,000
then we'll know for sure.

70
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,760
Let go of me.

71
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,260
You really don't remember me?

72
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:17,960
Let go of me.

73
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,079
Zhibai, what brings you

74
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:22,840
here today?

75
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,740
I heard Wen Rou is sick,

76
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,640
so I came to check on her.

77
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,500
Wen Rou is fine.

78
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,720
Please leave,

79
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,520
Zhibai?

80
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:33,340
He is the Fifth Prince?

81
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,000
Wen Rou.

82
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,960
Remember to visit me
at Qinxiu Palace when you have time.

83
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,160
I'm your brother too.

84
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,480
He's a worthless person.

85
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,410
Just ignore him.

86
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,640
Wen Rou.

87
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,450
What a coincidence.

88
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,800
Miss Ye.

89
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,680
Don't be so formal.

90
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,279
Just call me Xiyao.

91
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:21,760
Are you still

92
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,540
staying at Zhiyuan's palace?

93
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,600
I just met with the Empress,

94
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,200
and she said

95
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,320
she wants to find you new accommodations.

96
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,680
As a young lady,

97
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,280
it's not appropriate for you

98
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,159
to stay at Zhiyuan's palace indefinitely.

99
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:39,120
Where I live

100
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,080
is none of your business.

101
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,200
As your sister,
I'm only looking out for you.

102
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,040
Besides,

103
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,840
I'll be marrying Zhiyuan soon,

104
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,000
and we'll be family then.

105
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,840
Sister?

106
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:53,840
When did Father

107
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,240
have a daughter like you?

108
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,880
What gives you the right
to call yourself my sister?

109
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,480
What's wrong...

110
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,340
Besides, Father hasn't
approved the marriage yet,

111
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,960
so you might not
even become my sister-in-law.

112
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,850
Zhiyuan and I grew up together.

113
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,960
I am the most

114
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,400
important woman in his life,

115
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,000
and he will definitely marry me.

116
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,460
His most important person

117
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,680
isn't you, is it?

118
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,000
Wen Rou,

119
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,200
as a young lady,

120
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,680
hanging around your brother

121
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,520
all day long

122
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,360
is shameless.

123
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,520
I'm going to tell the Empress right now,

124
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,650
and have her discipline you properly.

125
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,560
That slap last time

126
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,400
didn't teach you

127
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,600
how to behave, did it?

128
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:34,640
You...

129
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,360
I advise you not to provoke me again,

130
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:38,800
or else

131
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,600
it won't be just a slap next time.

132
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,120
Wen Rou.

133
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:51,320
Just you wait,

134
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,420
I'll definitely settle
this score with you.

135
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,170
What's happening to me?

136
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,560
Why is my head so dizzy?

137
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,780
Something's wrong

138
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,159
with this fragrance.

139
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:41,960
Who are you?

140
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,280
Get out!

141
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,120
Princess Wen Rou,

142
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,320
I'm Wang Weiyong,

143
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,720
son of the Minister of Revenue.

144
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,000
We met when we were children.

145
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,800
I've heard you're a rare beauty,

146
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,200
and I'd like to get to know you better.

147
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:53,960
Get out!

148
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,800
Someone help!

149
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,600
Help!

150
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,580
Your Highness,

151
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,880
stop pretending.

152
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,840
Didn't you ask me to come?

153
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,680
Let me kiss you.

154
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,320
Let go of me!

155
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,520
Let go of me!

156
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,520
Let go of me!

157
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,720
Wen Rou, it's me.

158
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,660
I'll take you home.

159
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:01,800
Brother.

160
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,690
I'm so hot, Brother.

161
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,600
Brother, I feel terrible.

162
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,400
Help me.

163
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,400
Bewitching incense?

164
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:38,679
Zhiyuan.
