[The Blade of Romance]

2
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:10,840
[Episode 8]

3
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,320
Song Weiwei.

4
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:40,040
You little girl.

5
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,410
Why do you always

6
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,770
point that dagger at me?

7
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:43,600
Always?

8
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:46,570
You should call me Fifth Brother.

9
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:53,910
It's so cold today.

10
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,490
Why are you out here alone
in this chilly wind?

11
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:57,950
Warm your hands with this.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,640
It’s none of your business.

13
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,070
Haven't you

14
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:02,530
remembered anything yet?

15
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,370
Do you think Wen Zhiyuan

16
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:08,420
is trustworthy?

17
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:13,310
What do you mean?

18
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:20,090
Don't you think there might be

19
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,620
some secrets behind your memory loss?

20
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:23,280
Wen Zhiyuan is deceiving you.

21
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:24,070
I know.

22
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:25,640
No matter what I say now,

23
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,310
you won’t believe me.

24
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:26,840
However,

25
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:27,680
I can find someone

26
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,039
to help you recover your memory.

27
00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:29,640
Then

28
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:31,530
you'll know whether
I've been trying to drive a wedge

29
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:33,190
between you and your brother.

30
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:39,229
Fifth Brother,

31
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:41,070
let's go check over there.

32
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,290
They won’t get away.

33
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:12,510
They must be nearby.

34
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,880
Search everywhere!

35
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,590
We'll be discovered.

36
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,610
Can you do martial arts?

37
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,579
A gentleman uses words, not fists.

38
00:02:24,579 --> 00:02:26,180
Fighting is too vulgar.

39
00:02:26,329 --> 00:02:27,490
They're after me.

40
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:28,840
I’ll lead them away.

41
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,079
You go back and get help.

42
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:31,450
I am your Fifth Brother after all.

43
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:32,310
How could I let you

44
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:33,260
lend the enemy away

45
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,320
in this situation?

46
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,829
It will harm

47
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:36,570
my heroic image.

48
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:37,470
You're a grown man.

49
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:38,329
So indecisive.

50
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,010
I'll leave cross marks.

51
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,380
At least if one of us gets away,
it's a win.

52
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:45,340
The best plan is to run away.

53
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,740
At least if one of us gets away,
it's a win.

54
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:49,210
My name is Zhifeng,

55
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:50,700
from the Zhifeng Grass.

56
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,200
I'm from the Chen State.

57
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:53,370
Zhifeng...

58
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,710
Could it be her?

59
00:02:58,570 --> 00:02:59,630
Who are you?

60
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:01,010
We're following orders.

61
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:02,310
If Your Highness has complaints,

62
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:03,770
just tell the King of Hell.

63
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,010
Are you alright?

64
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:15,630
Brother.

65
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:52,870
Are you hurt?

66
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,770
You're injured.

67
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:01,730
I'm fine.

68
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,020
Your Highness.

69
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:25,450
Something's happened to Song Weiwei.

70
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:26,330
We need to take people to rescue her.

71
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:26,970
Come with me quickly.

72
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:28,230
I know, Your Highness.

73
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:31,420
Wen Zhiyuan has already
taken people there.

74
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,550
Please don't worry.

75
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,970
When Song Weiwei was little,

76
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:41,100
did she ever go to the Xirui Grassland?

77
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,170
Was she ever kidnapped by bandits?

78
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:45,500
How do you know this, Your Highness?

79
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,720
When Weiwei was young,

80
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,890
she was indeed kidnapped by bandits

81
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:49,220
on the Xirui Grassland.

82
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,680
But regarding a young lady's reputation,

83
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,540
this matter has never been
disclosed to outsiders.

84
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:56,240
It really is her.

85
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:59,830
It's her.

86
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:01,960
Your Highness.

87
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:02,830
Chu Qing,

88
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,560
have our people search for her too.

89
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,240
Make sure she’s safe.

90
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,240
Yes.

91
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:09,760
Life is unpredictable.

92
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,370
If I had known you were Zhifeng,

93
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:15,360
I would never
have drawn you into this situation.

94
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:39,210
Don't go outside alone

95
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:40,430
just to avoid me.

96
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:42,120
It's not safe.

97
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,050
I understand, Brother.

98
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:49,970
I'm injured.

99
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,000
It’s difficult to dress.

100
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,430
I've never actually

101
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:43,630
seen you as my sister.

102
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,930
You're not from the Da Liang royal family.

103
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,040
What do you mean?

104
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,710
You're from Chen State.

105
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:51,800
We met on the battlefield.

106
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:52,920
I had no choice

107
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,520
but to bring you back with me.

108
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:55,070
Actually,

109
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:57,720
when the Liang State
and the Chen State were at war,

110
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,120
Wen Rou was already dead.

111
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,350
I kept you here using her identity.

112
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,120
So we're not siblings?

113
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:05,920
No.

114
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:09,280
I've always had feelings for you.

115
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:17,390
I told you to stop avoiding me.

116
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,380
I know the timing isn't right,

117
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,270
but I can't

118
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,330
hold back anymore.

119
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:23,160
I want you to know how I feel.

120
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:15,050
[Brother.]

121
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,240
[No.]

122
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:18,350
[He's not my brother.]

123
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,240
[He said]

124
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,540
[he has feelings for me.]

125
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:41,440
Your Highness.

126
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,919
How's it going? Did you find her?

127
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:43,880
Yes, we found her.

128
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,740
She's injured,

129
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,160
but it's not serious.

130
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:46,870
Should I

131
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:47,840
go see her again,

132
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:49,330
tell her the truth,

133
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,360
and find a way to recover her memory?

134
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,240
What if she doesn't believe you?

135
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:53,750
What if

136
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:55,360
she tells Wen Zhiyuan everything

137
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,390
you said to her?

138
00:08:58,860 --> 00:08:59,890
I really don't feel at ease

139
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:00,390
keeping her

140
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:01,870
by Wen Zhiyuan's side any longer.

141
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:02,600
Wen Zhiyuan

142
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,280
trusts her completely now.

143
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,670
Besides, we don't know

144
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:06,320
if Wen Zhiyuan

145
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,840
has figured out her identity.

146
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,110
What if you go to see her,

147
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:10,440
and she exposes herself?
