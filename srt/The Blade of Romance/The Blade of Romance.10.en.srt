00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,890
[Episode 10]

3
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,000
I heard recently,

4
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:18,830
a few officials

5
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:21,820
have sent you their visiting cards.

6
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:23,870
These days, many officials

7
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:25,120
have been associating with me.

8
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:25,830
In private,

9
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:27,160
I have already secured

10
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,030
their support.

11
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:29,030
Good.

12
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:29,920
Sit.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:34,800
You may leave.

14
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:36,920
Yes.

15
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:39,430
I knew it.

16
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:41,070
My son was never

17
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:42,930
just seeking pleasure with them.

18
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,710
Those polo matches

19
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:46,600
and the drinking and revelry

20
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,600
were just a front.

21
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,790
Only by doing so

22
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:50,040
could I avoid

23
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:51,770
drawing Wen Zhiyuan's attention.

24
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:52,400
Indeed.

25
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,240
This matter can't be rushed.

26
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:58,510
After all, Wen Zhiyuan has military merit.

27
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:01,720
You can only proceed slowly, step by step.

28
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,260
Yesterday,

29
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:05,970
your father got angry.

30
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:08,600
Wen Zhiyuan likely won't have an easy time

31
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,920
from now on.

32
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,160
Why did Father get angry?

33
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:15,680
It was about him and Wen Rou.

34
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,130
Him and Wen Rou?

35
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:19,280
What about them?

36
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:21,440
Word is spreading in the palace

37
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:24,150
that Wen Rou and Wen Zhiyuan

38
00:01:24,789 --> 00:01:26,920
are involved in an incestuous affair.

39
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,220
What?

40
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:36,280
Have you already grown

41
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,350
this close to him?

42
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:39,950
Song Weiwei,

43
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:42,000
do you realize you've fallen in love

44
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
with the one who killed your father?

45
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,740
[Grace and Talent]

46
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:51,170
This jade pendant belonged to Wen Rou?

47
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:54,229
Yes.

48
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:56,190
I used it

49
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:57,539
to prove your identity.

50
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:59,130
Then I really owe it.

51
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:00,760
I suppose it counts

52
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,960
as a token between us.

53
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:05,640
Why don't we

54
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,430
carve our names

55
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,630
on the jade pendant?

56
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,400
That way, even if I lose my memory again,

57
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,630
when I see the jade pendant,

58
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:13,280
I'd be able to remember who you are.

59
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,610
Lose your memory again?

60
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,670
You never know.

61
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:23,079
What was

62
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:24,520
my name before?

63
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,310
Your name

64
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,660
was Weiwei.

65
00:02:28,829 --> 00:02:30,230
Wei as in Jian Wei Zhi Zhu.

66
00:02:30,829 --> 00:02:31,590
Weiwei?

67
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:40,910
Weiwei.

68
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,350
Let's carve a "Rou" on it too.

69
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,380
You don't mind?

70
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:48,630
It originally belonged to Wen Rou anyway.

71
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:50,310
I should thank her and the jade pendant

72
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:51,770

73

after the New Year,

100
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:15,240
I'll send you to reclaim Donghua.
What do you think?

101
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,040
Father, I won't fail your trust.

102
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:19,160
I will expand the territory of Liang State

103
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,450

00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:21,620
Well said, Zhiyuan.

Father,

00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,550
Liang State is strong and powerful,

108
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:28,360
but years of war

109
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,330
have led to heavy taxes.

The people are struggling to survive.

111
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:31,930
You're still too young and naive

If we are to go to war again,

117
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,860
we must conscript new soldiers.

118
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,270
It must not be taken lightly.

119
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:47,870
How about

Now,

00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:59,670
I'd better not upset Father again

126
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,220
or make Wen Zhiyuan become wary of me.

127
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:03,040
But Zhiyuan,

your marriage to Prime Minister's daughter

00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:07,230
should be arranged soon.

Establish your household

131
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,170

to rush my marriage.

149
