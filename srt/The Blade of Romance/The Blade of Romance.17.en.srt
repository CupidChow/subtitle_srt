[Episode 17]

3
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:28,530
Your Highness,

4
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:31,120
this is a letter for you
from King of Xirui.

5
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:43,910
King of Xirui,

6
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:45,670
Li Shiqing.

7
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:47,520
I never thought

8
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:48,390
that the little boy

9
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:49,920
who once followed me around

10
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:53,000
has now become

11
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,360
the pillar of a state.

12
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:56,860
His Highness is able to protect

13
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:57,920
his people in Xirui,

14
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,900
all thanks to your endurance

15
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,560
and sacrifice in Liang State.

16
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,320
If I hadn't known my younger brother

17
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,650
is still waiting for me,

18
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,760
I don't think I could've held on

19
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,450
for so long.

20
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,220
You showed mercy back then.

21
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,520
Even though you suspected Miss Song,

22
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,180
you still allowed her to stay.

23
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,850
Was it because she, like His Highness,

24
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:13,980
called you Brother?

25
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:15,010
Perhaps.

26
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:16,650
We both

27
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:19,840
were forced into ruin by Liang State.

28
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:21,560
The witch doctor said

29
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,490
starting today,

30
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,030
this face will be yours.

31
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:25,610
From now on,

32
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,610
you'll be Liang State's third prince,

33
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:28,410
Wen Zhiyuan.

34
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,240
You're no longer Li Shiyan,

35
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:31,430
a prince of Xirui.

36
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:34,520
The way Liang's emperor

37
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:35,729
treated Xirui back then

38
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:36,220
will be

39
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:38,870
the way he treats Chen State now.

40
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:40,990
Back then, Liang State
launched a full-scale invasion of Xirui.

41
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:42,850
My father was driven to his death.

42
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:44,470
As the crown prince of Xirui,

43
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,740
I had no choice but to fake my death,

44
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:47,900
change my face,

45
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:49,950
and infiltrate Liang State.

46
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:51,000
That blood feud—

47
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:52,530
I've never forgotten it.

48
00:01:53,229 --> 00:01:54,039
His Highness

49
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:56,479
has been waiting for your return in Xirui.

50
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:57,140
Wait for me?

51
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:58,420
Yan Chu,

52
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,570
do you still remember

53
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:01,950
what I looked like before?

54
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:02,640
Before?

55
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:04,210
When I was Li Shiyan.

56
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,470
I will kill Liang's emperor,

57
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:19,900
reclaim the throne,

58
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:22,640
and restore Xirui to its former glory.

59
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,460
By the way, Yan Chu,

60
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:33,630
there's one more thing

61
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:34,490
I need you to do.

62

[Jiuyao Gate]

63
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:45,430
I heard

64
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,660
after Wen Rou's death,

65
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,140
Zhiyuan was heartbroken.

66
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,570
His condition worsened upon illness,

67
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,420
and he even collapsed.

68
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:54,320
Since he woke up,

69
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,310
he's forgotten everything about Wen Rou.

70
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:56,750
Yes.

71
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:59,490
The imperial physician said
his heart meridian was injured.

72
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:01,010
I can't believe he could be

73
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:03,430
so heartbroken for just a woman.

74
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,730
That shows Prince Zhiyuan

75
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:06,660
is deeply affectionate and loyal.

76
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,550
Useless.

77
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:11,850
It'd be great if he has truly forgotten.

78
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:14,730
Pass my order.

79
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,360
From now on, no one in the palace

80
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,780
is allowed to mention Wen Rou again.

Pretend

82
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,320

83
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,380
Yes, Your Majesty.

85
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,079
I'm going to see Wen Rou.

86
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,440
Are you coming with me?

87
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:35,450
Who is Wen Rou?

88
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:36,730
My younger sister.

89
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:39,130
Since when do you have a younger sister?

90
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:40,910
Then...

91
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,650
what about Song Weiwei?

92
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,610
I've tested him.

93
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:55,000
Maybe he really has forgotten you.

94
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,680
It doesn't matter.

95
00:03:57,829 --> 00:03:59,040
I've made up my mind.

96
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,310
This time,

97
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,280
I won't fail.

98
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,470
Since everyone now

99
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:06,000
believes you're dead,

100
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,960
why do you have to get involved

101
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,690
in this mess?

102
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,030
Let me take you back to Chen State.

103
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:12,360
You can live freely there.

104
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,590
Wouldn't that be better?

105
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:15,320
Chen State has been destroyed.

106
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:18,390
Now Chen's territory
belongs to Liang State.

107
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:20,180
And all my family members are dead.

108
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,149
Where can I go?

109
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,800
I'm only alive

110
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:25,160
to seek revenge.

111
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,390
Father has handed over all state affairs

112

to Wen Zhiyuan.

113
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:30,390
He is

114
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,000
colder and more ruthless than before.

115
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,090
And he has already promised

116
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:37,290
to wage war against Donghua for Father.

117
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,060
What can you do to stop him?

118
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:40,890
How will you take revenge?

119
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,480
I can do it.

120
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,700
War makes people homeless

121
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:49,100
and destroys countless families.

122
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,390
This war

123
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,070
must not be fought.

124
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,780
I can work with you.

125
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,350
I'll help you bring him down.

126
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,330
But you must keep your word.

127
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:00,480
You're still going back to him?

128
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:03,680
But what if he remembers everything

129
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,680
after he sees you?

130
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,630
He's a madman.

131
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:06,760
It's too dangerous.

132
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:09,640
Then we go mad together.

133
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,080
If he hasn't lost his memory,

134
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:14,760
my appearance will only disrupt his plans

135
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:17,070
and make him lose his composure.

136

This time,

137
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,860
just like you said,

138
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:29,600
we will get what we want.

I have no right to stop you.

142
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:39,470
But I have my selfish reasons.

For the throne,

144
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:44,120
for my own ambition,

I have to watch you

go back to him

and put yourself in danger again.

148
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:51,960
Essentially,

149
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:53,980

Your appointment
as Vice Minister of Revenue

154

is solely the result

of your years of diligent service.

156
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,480
It has nothing to do with me.

157

I had served as Director
of the Ministry of Revenue for many years.

158

I witnessed the corruption
and abuse of power of Vice Minister Wang.

Prime Minister's behavior

But I have a feeling

that he hasn't really lost his memory.
