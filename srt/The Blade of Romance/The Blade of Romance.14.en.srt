00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,170
[General's Mansion]

4
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:31,880
What a beauty.

5
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,520
His Majesty and Prince Zhiyuan

6
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:35,790
have treated me well.

7
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:43,640
Stop acting like some stuck-up princess.

8
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,180
The auspicious time has arrived.

9
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,260
First bow to the heavens...

10
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:48,390
Something's wrong!

11
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,670
General, we have trouble!

12
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:50,520
Armed men have

13
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:51,860
broken into the mansion.

14
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:52,260
What?

15
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,560
I want to see

16
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,180
who dares to cause trouble in my mansion.

17
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,260
Your Highness!

18
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,380
The General's Mansion is under control.

19
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:13,800
Prince Zhiyuan.

20
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:17,039
Today, I share the joy
of marriage with Your Highness.

21
00:01:17,039 --> 00:01:19,280
What do you mean by this, Your Highness?

22
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,610
Have you perhaps

23
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:21,830
changed your mind?

24
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,200
Murder!

25
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:42,680
Wen Rou.

26
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I've come for you.

27
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,740
Your Highness!

28
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,680
Who are you?

29
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,820
I'm here to rescue you.

30
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,900
Who are you really?

31
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:08,810
Weiwei,

32
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,660
I am your master.

33
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,680
Master?

34
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,840
You are the daughter of Song Buwei,

35
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,130
the greatest general of Chen State.

36
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:19,530
Your name is Song Weiwei.

37
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,150
Song Buwei?

38
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:23,560
Song Weiwei?

39
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,590
Wen Zhiyuan led his army
to destroy Chen State

40
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:28,920
and killed your father.

41
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:30,970
Do you really want to stay here

42
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:33,370
and be his stepping stone to the throne?

43
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:35,310
Even if you don't remember anything,

44
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,280
haven't you ever questioned

45
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,340
your own identity?

46
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:38,630
Weiwei,

47
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,640
come with me.

48
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,700
I'll help you recover your memories.

49
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:44,100
We need to leave now or it'll be too late.

50
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:44,590
Have you

51
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:45,780
really forgotten your father

52
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:46,740
Song Buwei?

53
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:55,210
Hurry back! danger!

54
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:55,870
Father!

55
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,470
Don't go, don't be rash.

56
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,560
Stay alive to seek revenge, Weiwei.

57
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,400
Listen to me!

58
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,090
Don't you remember who I am?

59
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,090
Don't you remember who you are?

60
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,450
I am Wen Zhiyuan.

61
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,430
You are from the Chen State.

62
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:11,890
We met on the battlefield.

63
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,120
I had no choice

64
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,430
but to bring you back with me.

65
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:15,750
So we're not siblings?

66
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:16,430
No.

67
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,730
I've always had feelings for you.

68
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:19,400
No!

69
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,280
I fell in love with

70
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,910
the man who killed my father?

71
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,490
You've remembered?

72
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:41,630
Weiwei.

73
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:43,850
This isn't your fault.

74
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:44,930
I'll take you away.

75
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:45,870
We can talk

76
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,329
after we leave this place.

77
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:51,960
I'm not leaving.

78
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:53,310
If I die,

79
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:57,430
Wen Zhiyuan dies with me.

80
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,090
Everyone, leave us!

81
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:15,750
Do you remember everything now?

82
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:16,360
Yes.

83
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,870
So all of this

84
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:20,200
was your plan all along?

85
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,769
I've been waiting for you,

86
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:23,790
waiting to kill you.

87
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,680
I will repent

88
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,240
for everything I did wrong

89
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,240
while I had amnesia.

90
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,510
His Highness has treated you well,

91
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:46,730
how can you repay kindness with betrayal?

92
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:48,460
Repay kindness with betrayal?

93
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,380
Was killing my father
your idea of kindness?

94
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,190
Or was it lying to me while I had amnesia?

95
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:57,000
His Highness and General Song

96
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,190
met on the battlefield.

97
00:04:58,190 --> 00:04:59,000
On the battlefield,

98
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,660
it's always kill or be killed.

99
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,480
If not for his ambition,

100
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:05,010
why would Liang State attack Chen State?

101
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,580
How many have died because of him?

102
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,040
What kind of kindness
has he ever shown me?

103
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,340
His Highness truly cares for you.

104
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:13,670
He wants to make amends.

105
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:14,870
You should really consider

106
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,270
his sincere intentions.

107
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,450
Even if I die,

108
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,480
I will kill you.

109
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:31,680
