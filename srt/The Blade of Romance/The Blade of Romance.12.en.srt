[The Blade of Romance]

00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:10,970
[Episode 12]

3
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:14,810
[Earth]

4
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:21,170
Your Highness,

5
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:23,010
this is your wedding robe.

6
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:24,140
We'll untie you

7
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:25,570
when you marry General Zhou

8
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:26,600
in three days.

9
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,160
Prince Zhiyuan's wedding

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,420
is also on the same day.

11
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:30,240
Your Highness,

12
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,070
this isn't

13
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:32,390
the worst outcome.

14
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,570
You must try to look on the bright side.

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,750
"Not the worst outcome?"

16
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:40,000
Get out.

17
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:40,710
Yes.

18
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,500
I never thought

19
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:53,570
that I'd see you like this.

20
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,600
I thought you were so powerful

21
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:57,870
that everything was under your control.

22
00:00:57,870 --> 00:00:58,960
Why isn't Wen Zhiyuan

23
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,220
coming to your rescue?

24
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,900
None of your business.

25
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:06,710
I know.

26
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,760
I'm about to marry

27
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,820
your dear brother.

28
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:11,110
So why would he still

29
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:13,380
bother with a sister like you?

30
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:19,120
Did you come here just to say this?

31
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,840
This isn't a place

32
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,170
for you to come, Miss Ye.

33
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,280
I came anyway.

34
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,000
I just wanted to see

35
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:28,510
what the once-mighty Seventh Princess

36
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:29,680
looks like now.

37
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:31,130
Now you've seen it.

38
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:33,960
Get out.

39
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:38,039
You're a prisoner now,

40
00:01:38,039 --> 00:01:39,700
yet you're still so insolent.

41
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,650
Listen to me,

42
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:42,640
you should have died

43
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,370
back at the Hot Springs Palace!

44
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:47,680
Where are your manners?

45
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:50,500
You should address me as
sister-in-law now.

46
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,430
Wen Rou,

47
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,200
you've lost.

48
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:55,200
Zhiyuan is mine.

49
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,940
You can only ever be his sister,

50
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,680
nothing but a burden to him!

51
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,560
But I—

52
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,870
I am the most important woman to him!

53
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:04,960
He doesn't love you.

54
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:07,150
Shut up!

55
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,910
You drove him away from me.

56
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,630
You turned his heart against me.

57
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:12,840
You almost prevented me

58
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,900
from marrying him.

59
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,850
Why don't you just die?

60
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:17,030
Die.

61
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:18,430
Just die!

62
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:36,190
No.

63
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,079
You can't die.

64
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:39,870
I want you to witness with your own eyes

65
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,470
as Zhiyuan and I get married.

66
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:42,800
I want you to feel

67
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,920
what true despair tastes like.

00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:22,020

00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:28,070

82
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,600
I beg Your Highness

83
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,950
to put the greater good first.

84
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,270
Please don't let personal feelings
jeopardize everything.

85
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:42,130
Now, except for the Imperial Guards
in the palace,

86
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:44,000
all military power is in Zhou Fu's hands.

87
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,400
Your Highness cannot...

88
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:47,470
cannot make another grave mistake.

89
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:11,680
By the mandate of heaven,

90
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,120
the Emperor decrees:

91
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:16,120
Ye Xiyao, daughter of the Prime Minister,

92
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,680
is virtuous and graceful,

93
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,920
kind and gentle,

94
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,750
with exceptional character and beauty.

95
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,950
Now that the Third Prince, Wen Zhiyuan,

96
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:24,680
has reached the age of marriage,

97
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,040
a virtuous lady should be chosen
as his bride.

98
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,630
As Ye Xiyao has reached marriageable age
and remains unmarried,

99
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:32,760
she and the Third Prince are truly
a match made in heaven.

100
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:34,600
To fulfill this perfect union,

101
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:37,360
a marriage is hereby decreed
between Third Prince Wen Zhiyuan

102
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,630
and Ye Xiyao.

103
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:42,430
An auspicious day shall be selected
for their wedding ceremony.

104
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:09,170
Brother...

105
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:10,720
you told me to trust you,

106
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,720
[Radiant Blessing]

107
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,720
so I did.

108
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,690
You asked me to wait for you,

109
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,040
so I did.

110
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:22,190
You said this is what you wanted,

111
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,510
then so be it.

112
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:26,800
Wen Zhiyuan,

113
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,290
let's never see each other again.

114
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:48,040
Zhiyuan,

115
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,000
I've finally become your legitimate wife.

116
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,060
Set down the bridal sedan.

117
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,810
Prince Zhiyuan.

118
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:18,870
Brother?
