[The Blade of Romance]

00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,880
[Episode 15]

3
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:11,750
Your Majesty!

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:12,880
Your Majesty!

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,670
There's a rebellion at the palace gates!

6
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:15,190
What?

7
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:25,590
Father.

8
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:27,670
I apologize for arriving late
to protect you.

9
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:29,730
Have you found out who's behind this?

10
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:32,610
Your Majesty,

11
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,000
Zhou Fu secretly raised his own army.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,510
Taking advantage of
the lax guards during the royal wedding,

13
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:36,270
he launched a rebellion.

14
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:37,210
But he has already

15
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:38,520
been executed by His Highness
outside the palace.

16
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,560
Zhou Fu rebelled?

17
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,000
How is that possible?

18
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,200
Zhou Fu held military power

19
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:48,500
and occupied Chen's territory for years.

20
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,160
I'm afraid he had long harbored
such ambitions.

21
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,020
Father,

22
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,040
I have captured all

23
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:56,330
of his rebel officers.

24
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,740
This is Zhou Fu's military token.

25
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:02,090
I return it to you.

26
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:15,530
Such a treacherous ambition,

27
00:01:16,039 --> 00:01:17,430
truly despicable.

28
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:20,850
Where is Wen Rou?

29
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:27,480
Princess Wen Rou

30
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:31,470
was killed by Zhou Fu.

31
00:01:31,789 --> 00:01:32,720
What did you say?

32
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:58,310
Zhiyuan.

33
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,900
You've rendered a great service.

34
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,640
Zhou Fu's military token

35
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,000
will remain in your custody for now.

36
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,800
The imperial guards
will still follow my command.

37
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:09,280
Yes.

38
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,410
I will not marry another woman.

39
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:20,560
I promised you

40
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:22,430
I would never betray you.

41
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,420
So no matter what happens,

42
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:26,640
you can always trust me.

43
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,400
I have always had feelings for you.

44
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,370
I want you to know how I feel.

45
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:48,470
Father,

46
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:51,150
I acknowledge my mistake.

47
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:25,120
Repaying kindness with betrayal.

48
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,680
Is it the kindness of
him killing my father,

49
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,560
or the kindness of
him pretending to have amnesia?

50
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,360
If it weren't for his ambition,

51
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:35,650
would Liang State have
ever gone to war with Chen State?

52
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:37,960
How many people died because of him?

53
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:40,590
How could he have ever
shown me any kindness?

54
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,870

from afar ♪

55
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:45,750

59
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,750
I hate you.

00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:01,580

63
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,870
You said you wanted revenge,

64
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:38,330
that you wanted to kill me.

65
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:40,000
But I'm still alive.

66
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,510
Why did you leave first?

67
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,390
I brought your favorite

68
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:58,520
peach blossom cake.

69
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,450
Even if you're still angry,

70
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,650
please get up and have some.

71
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:13,920
I forgot.

72
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:18,310
You actually don’t like sweets.

73
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,070
I don't even know

74
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,600
what your favorite food is.

75
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:36,480
If you wake up,

76
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,920
I'll give you anything you want.

77
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,480
Okay?

78
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,980
Since we parted on the grassland,

79
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,130
it's been 10 years.

80
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:04,830
I thought

81
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,360
I would never see you again.

82
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:08,400
But I never expected

83
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:11,430
that we would meet again

84
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:13,030
under these circumstances.

85
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,030
You lost your memory.

86
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,780
I thought even heaven was helping me,

87
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:19,920
letting me

88
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,050
finally be with you.

89
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:23,160
I thought

90
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:27,310
I would never lose you again.

91
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,190
Zhou Fu's treason

92
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,890
has caused me deep pain.

93
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,970
How is the morale of our troops now?

94
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,600
Your Majesty,

95
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:02,920
Zhou Fu was already infamous

96
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:05,110
for keeping women in his tent

97
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,360
and embezzling military funds.

98
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,000
After this incident,

99
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,160
everyone in the army is rejoicing,

100
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,420
praising Your Majesty's wisdom.

101
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,760
Zhou Fu had military merits.

102
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:19,070
I went to great lengths

103
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,870
to make him reveal his true colors.

104
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,320
Your Majesty is wise.

105
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:27,070
Zhiyuan.

106
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:29,850
Yes, Father.

107
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:32,470
How is the military recruitment going?

108
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,570
In three months at most,

109
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:37,800
we will be ready to march.

110
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,870
Excellent.

111
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,310
The vast world

112
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,240
is all my domain.

113
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,690
Today in the palace,

114
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,210
Father said Zhou Fu's death

115
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,560
was his plan.

116
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:03,510
Isn't that ridiculous?
