00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:07,850
[The Blade of Romance]

2
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:10,960
[Episode 22]

3
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:21,090
What do you want to ask?

4
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,800
You and Wen Zhibai joined forces

5
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,510
just to

6
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:28,070
make me look like I was plotting

7
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:29,960
to seize the throne
in front of His Majesty?

8
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:30,760
Yes.

9
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:34,520
If I hadn't let Wen Zhibai

10
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,780
expose himself before Liang's emperor,

11
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:39,520
how could someone like you,
faking memory loss,

12
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,120
walk straight into the trap?

13
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:42,560
When did you realize

14
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,890
I hadn't lost my memory?

15
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:49,640
I suspected it

16
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,350
from the very beginning.

17
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,280
If you truly forgot,

18
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,360
why would you still keep

19
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,400
my portrait?

20
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,670
You used my love for you

21
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:05,760
to draw me in.

22
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:08,230
You played your hand well.

23
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:10,350
I lost, and I admit it.

24
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:21,870
Wen Zhiyuan,

25
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:24,590
this is what you owe me.

26
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,920
Where did you hide the imperial seal?

27
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,789
You found out

28
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,310
later than I expected.

29
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:46,710
You don't have to tell me,

30
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:48,070
but Song Weiwei's life

31
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,780
might not be spared.

32
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,890
You two were already allied,

33
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:53,640
yet still put on an act.

34
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,430
What are you doing?

35
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:14,910
Within palace walls,

36
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:16,840
the most dangerous thing is trust,

37
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:18,770
isn't it?

38
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:20,710
What do you mean?

39
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,710
Wen Zhibai,

40
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:23,890
you went back on your word.

41
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,910
Torture in the imperial prison
was carried out without restraint.

42
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:35,560
Who knows

43
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:36,840
how long she can hold out?

44
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,170
Whether she lives or not

45
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,030
is up to you.

46
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:41,280
You broke your word,

47
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:41,980
bullying a defenseless woman,

48
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,000
what kind of man does that make you?

49
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,660
Isn't that what you taught me,

50
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:45,800
Zhiyuan?

51
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,420
What are you doing?

52
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,310
Let me go!

53
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,030
Let me go!

54
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:55,560
Help!

55
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,190
Help!

56
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:58,840
Let me go!

57
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:00,240
Let me go!

58
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,080
Let me go!

59
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:06,430
Help!

60
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:07,430
Help!

61
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:10,870
Please, let me go!

62
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,400
Let me go!

63
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:13,150
I'll talk.

64
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:14,070
I'll talk.

65
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:15,750
Let her go right now!

66
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:19,510
The imperial seal is with Yan Chu,

67
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,460
at the villa outside the city.

68
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,890
We're not so different, are we?

69
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,540
You made me
fall for you through deception.

70
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,910
I only wanted you

71
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:10,530
to feel a fraction of my pain.

72
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:15,220
[I lost to you.]

73
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:26,460
Then I'll take my leave.

74
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:51,280
Now it's time to settle what's between us.

75
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,470
Do you really hate me that much?

76
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:54,520
You destroyed the Chen State,

77
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,110
and killed my father and seniors.

78
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:57,510
How could I not hate you?

79
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,750
Everyone I loved

80
00:04:58,750 --> 00:04:59,750
died by your hands.

81
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,000
Shouldn't I hate you?

82
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,240
Yet you still fell in love

83
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:02,830
with your father's killer,

84
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:03,390
didn't you?

85
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:04,870
I never loved you.

86
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:05,840
You're lying.

87
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,800
I'm not.

88
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:07,920
Wen Zhiyuan,

89
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,750
today, I, Song Buwei,

90
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,280
am willing to trade my life

91
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:15,310
for the safety of the entire city!

92
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,470
[If you hate me so much,]

93
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:36,830
[then hate me to the end.]

94
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,159
You're right.

95
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,909
I killed your father.

96
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:41,800
The crown prince of the Chen State

97
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,140
was also killed by my arrow.

98
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,120
And your seniors...

99
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:44,830
-Shut up!
-They all died...

100
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:45,680
by my hand too.

101
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:51,100
When we kissed under the fireworks,

102
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,290
did you think of them?

103
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:53,000
When you lay in my arms,

104
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,820
calling me Zhiyuan,

105
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:54,750
did you think of them?

106
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,020
Admit it, you love me.

107
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:57,600
You're insane!

108
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,659
You won't do it.

109
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
