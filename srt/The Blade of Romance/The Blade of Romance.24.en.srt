[Jiuyao Gate]

4
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:28,890
Prince Zhibai.

5
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:31,230
I still prefer you call me Bai Cheng.

6
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:32,390
Bai Cheng.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,860
I have to go now.

8
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:35,530
Where are you planning to go?

9
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:36,200
Xirui.

10
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,640
If you ever go to Xirui in the future,

11
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,770
you can come find me.

12
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:41,080
I'm leaving.

13
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,320
Could you...

14
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:51,200
Could you occasionally

15
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,170
write to me?

16
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:54,350
Don't be so cold-hearted.

17
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:54,950
All right.

18
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,120
Goodbye.

19
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:57,810
Goodbye.

20
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:11,840
Tomorrow we'll draw him into our trap.

21
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,690
Did you ever have feelings for him?

22
00:01:18,039 --> 00:01:19,240
Did you ever love him?

23
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:36,310
Would you fall in love with

24
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:38,240
the person who killed your father?

25
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,509
You didn't kill my Father.

26
00:01:58,229 --> 00:01:59,000
That's why we

27
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,950
can sit here

28
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:00,760
like friends.

29
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,520
You’re smart enough

30
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:23,740
to know what I’m thinking,

31
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:26,079
but you never gave me

32
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:28,190
the chance to say it.

33
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:37,510
Not being able to spend my life with you,

34
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,710
I do have regrets.

35
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,660
Your Highness.

36
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,250
The ceremony for the succession
is about to begin.

37
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,960
We need to go back and get ready.

38
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,760
Don’t miss the auspicious time.

39
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:49,079
Okay.

40
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:09,190
Boss, one bowl of noodles, please.

41
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:09,910
Sure.

42
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:14,980
Your noodles.

43
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:18,560
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

44
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,240
Senior.

45
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:24,810
That's wonderful!

46
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,370
I thought you were all gone.

47
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:28,400
Little one,

48
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:30,800
I also thought

49
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,960
I'd never see you again.

50
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,890
You've grown up.

51
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,820
Where are the other seniors?

52
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:39,710
They've scattered all over the country,

53
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:40,960
living their own lives now.

54
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,730
But didn't Wen Zhiyuan

55
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:42,730
kill all of you?

56
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:43,840
No.

57
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,070
Back then,

58
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,840
Wen Zhiyuan sent us to work in the mines,

59
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,280
but the guards there were lax,

60
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,600
so we all managed to escape.

61
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,680
So Wen Zhiyuan

62
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,310
deliberately sent you

63
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:52,240
all there

64
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:54,490
to let you escape on your own?

65
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:55,970
That's exactly right.

66
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,520
At that time,

67
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,850
we didn't rush to seek revenge.

68
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:00,930
Wen Zhiyuan

69
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:02,630
seemed different

70
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:03,830
from what we thought.

71
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,050
Boss, one bowl of noodles, please.

72
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:06,710
Right away.

73
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:08,690
Little one,

74
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:10,910
eat your noodles.

75
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:12,050
The journey is still long.

76
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:13,960
Eat well and keep moving forward.

77
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,100
In the end,

78
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,120
you're still lying to me.

[One year later]

80
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:53,760
Li Shiyan,

81
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:55,800
I returned to the place

82
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,480
where we first met.

83
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:00,790
I've come back to your hometown,

84
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:01,830
Xirui.

85
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,380
You said the thing you longed for most

86
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,580
was to come back here,

87
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,190
to that time

88
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:09,600
when we were carefree.

89
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:12,910
I came here for you,

90
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,510
to see this peaceful world,

91
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,680
to see the country in tranquility.
