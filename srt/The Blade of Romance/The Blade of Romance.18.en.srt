[The Blade of Romance]

2
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:10,890
[Episode 18]

3
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:17,260
Everyone.

4
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:18,520
Ladies and gentlemen,

5
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:19,230
today,

6
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,670
my Wansong Restaurant

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,640
has received a new batch of fine wine.

8
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,960
They're all famous.

9
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:25,140
If anyone

10
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,800
can defeat Lady Zhifeng

11
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:28,280
in a wine contest,

12
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:30,780
he can take all the fine wine.

13
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,000
And if anyone

14
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:34,280
can correctly guess the names of the wine,

15
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,710
Lady Zhifeng is willing

16
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:37,790
to offer wine as the betrothal gifts

17
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,490
and go home with the victor.

18
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,320
Such a good deal?

19
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:44,420
Everyone, please look.

20
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:13,560
So,

21
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:15,789
who would like to give it a try?

22
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:17,039
I'll try.

23
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:18,200
Okay.

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,080
This way, sir.

25
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:22,980
Bring the wine.

26
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:30,070
Before each of you

27
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:31,560
are three cups of wine.

28
00:01:32,039 --> 00:01:32,680
Both of you

29
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:33,930
will taste them at the same time.

30
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:35,509
Whoever correctly names the wine first

31
00:01:35,509 --> 00:01:36,570
will be the winner.

32
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:38,190
I'm a wine master.

33
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,009
I'll give you an advantage.

34
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:40,759
You first.

35
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:54,080
Jade Pot Spring.

36
00:01:58,009 --> 00:01:59,810
Please have the second cup, sir.

37
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:07,950
Flower Dew.

38
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:09,830
-Impressive.
-Impressive.

39
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,960
Sir, you deserve your reputation
as a wine master.

40
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,760
Lady Zhifeng,

41
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:14,710
you've met your match this time.

42
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,840
Well then,

43
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,030
for the third cup,

44
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,610
let me offer you a toast.

45
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:21,470
If you can name it correctly,

46
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:23,090
I will be yours.

47
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,860
Then you're about to lose.

48
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:39,470
This is Suihantang.

49
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:42,230
Correct again.
He correctly named them all!

50
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,030
Then today,

51
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,630
I'll go with you.

52
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:50,130
This trip today

53
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,490
has won me a beauty.

54
00:02:51,829 --> 00:02:52,950
It's worth it.

55
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,079
Well,

56
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:56,870
congratulations to you two.

57
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,630
When the wedding day comes,

58
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:00,090
don't forget to invite me.

59
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,000
Congratulations.

60
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:24,710
Zhiyuan?

61
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:25,930
Why are you here?

62
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,430
Zhibai,

63
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:33,190
wasting your days like this—

64
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,870
aren't you worried Father would scold you?

65
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:37,240
As long as you don't tell him,

66
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,800
Father won't know.

67
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:43,590
Sir,

68
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,030
let's go.

69
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,430
Zhiyuan,

70
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:52,750
goodbye.

71
00:03:57,950 --> 00:03:58,710
There's one more thing

72
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:59,430
I need you to do,

73
00:03:59,430 --> 00:03:59,910
Yan Chu.

74
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,750
Have the imperial physician tell them

75
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:02,800
I'm heartbroken,

76
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,680
and my heart meridian has been injured.

77
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,860
And I've forgotten everything

78
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:07,790
about Wen Rou.

79
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:10,310
That way, no matter where she is,

80
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:12,570
no one will pay attention to her anymore.

81
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,260
And no one will be able

82
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,260
to hurt her again.

83
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,089
So all this time,

84
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:20,089
the person behind you is Wen Zhibai.

85
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,310
Weiwei,

86
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:25,980
these tricks are far from enough.

87
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:09,490
[Beyond the Ordinary]

88
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:24,960
Are you hurt?

89
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:34,830
Zhiyuan,

90
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,159
what are you doing here?

91
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,620
Zhiyuan, what is the meaning of this?

92
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,600
I'm taking this woman with me.

93
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,800
Zhiyuan, why are you suddenly

94
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,400
so interested in this woman?

95
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,390
You had Vice Minister Zhang

96
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:07,120
lure me to Wansong Restaurant.

97
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:07,920
Then you made sure I saw

98
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,240
that act between you and her.

99
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,560
All that was just to plant this woman

100
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,470
around me.

101
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:13,330
Since that's what you want,

102
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:14,530
I'll grant your wish.

103
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:27,430
If he comes today,

104
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,690
will you really go with him?

105
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,430
Such a clumsy trap—

106
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,440
I doubt he will take the bait.

107
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,790
If he hasn't lost his memory,

108
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:38,630
he will take me with him.

109
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,320
What if he really has?

110
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:42,720
It's not too late to change your mind now.

111
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,650
I'll have Chu Qing escort you away.

112
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,830
I'm willing to take the gamble.

113
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,680
Your Highness,

114
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,480
what's wrong?

115
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:08,130
Where's your veil?

116
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,560
No one but me

117
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:15,510
is allowed

118
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:16,440
to see your face.

119
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:47,310
Since I'm yours,

120
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:48,830
from now on,

121
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:51,490
I will follow all your instructions.

122
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,600
Wen Zhiyuan,

123
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:02,770
our game has begun.
