[Pure Rain]

00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,520
What a beauty.

5
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,200
His Majesty and Prince Zhiyuan

6
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,560
treat me well.

7
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,130
Stop acting like some stuck-up princess.

8
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,460
The auspicious time has arrived.

9
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,800
-The first bow to the heaven...
-Bad news!

10
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,800
Someone's broken

11
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,480
into the mansion with weapons!

12
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,610
Who dares cause trouble in my mansion?

13
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:55,320
Zhiyuan,

14
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,200
is that you?

15
00:00:59,280 --> 00:00:59,480
Your Highness.

16
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,520
[Liang State's third prince: Wen Zhiyuan]

17
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:03,940
Your Highness,

18
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,770
what is the meaning of this?

19
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,180
As long as you're willing,

20
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,970
my hand will always be here.

21
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,039
These twin jade pendants

22
00:01:41,039 --> 00:01:42,320
represent a bond of hearts—

23
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,440
eternal and unbreakable.

24
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,300
From now on, we live and die as one,

25
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,170
buried together even in death.

26
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:50,640
Wen Rou,

27
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,620
I've come to take you home.

28
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,580
Your Highness!

29
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,300
Stand down, all of you!

30
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,720
You've remembered everything?

31
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,320
Yes.

32
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:16,760
Stop!

33
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,200
I hate you.

34

[One year ago]

35
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,640
Out of my way, all of you!

36
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,200
Wen Zhiyuan!

37
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,320
If you don't let me go right now,

38
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,800
I'll make your younger sister, Wen Rou,

39
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,120
die with me!

40
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,440
Brother, help me!

41
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,840
Brother!

42
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,720
Wen Zhiyuan!

43
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,240
I'll say it one last time.

44
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,720
Let me go!

45
00:03:59,040 --> 00:03:59,960
A real man

46
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,200
would rather die in battle

47
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,040
[General of Chen State: Song Buwei]

48
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:02,970
than surrender!

49
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,200
You're overestimating yourself

50
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,730
and inviting humiliation.

51
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,560
If you want to die,

52
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,760
I'll grant your wish.

53
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,930
You're overconfident.

54
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,120
Father!

55
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:32,960
Weiwei,

56
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,640
Liang State's Seventh Princess, Wen Rou,

57
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,300
has been held hostage in Chen State
for 15 years.

58
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,040
This jade pendant

59
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,000
is the only thing that can prove

60
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,659
Princess Wen Rou's identity.

61
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,720
Pretend to be her.

62
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,860
For the sake of Chen State,

63
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:46,940
stay alive.

64
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,200
No!

65
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:56,920
You're awake.

66
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,210
Brother,

67
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,200
I just had a nightmare.

68
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,740
It still scares me.

69
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,960
If you truly were Wen Rou,

70
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,640
on the day the two armies clashed,

71
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,640
Liang State should have killed you.

72
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,040
I have the jade pendant as proof.

73
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,520
I told Chen State's crown prince

74
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,050
he could use me to force you to retreat.

75
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,370
That's why I wasn't killed.

76
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,000
No! No!

77
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,560
Do you believe me now?

78
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:54,570
Brother,

79
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,290
please don't abandon me again.

80
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,820
Take me back to the palace.

81
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,720
Fortunately, I knew Wen Rou

82
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,480
had a crescent-shaped birthmark

83
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,800
on her body

84
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,330
and made preparations in advance.

85
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,720
[Wen Zhiyuan's temporary palace]

86
00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:40,760
You're still up at this hour?

87
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,490
Brother,

88
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,460
I brought you late-night snacks.

89
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,440
I saw no guards at the door,

90
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,000
so I came in directly.

91
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,290
Brother,

92
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,370
have a taste.

93
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:05,920
You scumbag,

94
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,060
prepare to die!

95
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,490
You've walked right into our trap.

96
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,080
Assassin!

97
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,800
Protect the general!

98
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:34,970
General!

99
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,360
After her!

100
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,260
-Yes!
-Yes!

[Jiaxiang Palace

102
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:50,850
Does it hurt?

103
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,640
Stay here in Jiaxiang Palace

104
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,280
and don't wander around.

105
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:32,720
Got it.

106
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:47,800
Master,

107
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,920
have you found any trace of my seniors?

108
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,280
[Chu Qing, Song Weiwei's master]

109
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,010
They served under your father.

110
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,400
If they've been captured by Liang's army,

111
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,400
I'm afraid they wouldn't be spared.

112
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,160
Master,

113
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,640
I don't think Wen Zhiyuan

114
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,770
fully trusts me yet.

115
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,160
Since we have no info on my seniors,

116
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,620
why don't we take a gamble?

117
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:03,800
Okay.

118
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:09,800
Your Highness,

119
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,760
Eunuch Liu
from His Majesty's side is here.

120
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,440
Let him in.

121
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,580
Your Highness.

122
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,720
What brings you here, Eunuch Liu?

123
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,580
There's an issue
with Princess Wen Rou's identity.

124
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,720
I'm afraid...

125
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,040
she's an impostor.

126
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,520

127
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:31,810

[Liang's Imperial Palace]

129
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,640
I was a court painter in Chen State.

[Liang's Emperor]

131
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,440
I painted a portrait of Princess Wen Rou.

132
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,100
This woman—

133
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,960
she's definitely not Princess Wen Rou!

134
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,480
Father,

135
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:42,560
how could I not be

136
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,440
your daughter?

137
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,050
He's trying to frame me.

138
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,040
I have the same jade pendant as Zhiyuan.

139
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,040
And I have the birthmark to prove it!

140
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,400
The birthmark is meant to deceive you!

141
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,060
It was tattooed on afterward!

142
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,320
Your Majesty,

143
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,600
I only wish to earn merit and live.

144
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,860
I have no reason to lie.

145
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,090

146
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,760
you believe me, don't you?

147
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,960
I really am Wen Rou.

148

149
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,360
Zhiyuan,

150
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,320
royal bloodlines must be kept pure.

151
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,280
I have taught you before:

152
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,770
better to kill the wrong person

153
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,090
than let an impostor slip through.

154
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,700
For the purity of our lineage,

155
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,440
kill her.
