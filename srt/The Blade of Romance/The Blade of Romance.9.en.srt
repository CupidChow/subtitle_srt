00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:07,830
[The Blade of Romance]

2
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:10,890
[Episode 9]

3
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:23,600
Your Highness, why did you ask me here?

4
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,250
Prime Minister,
do you recognize this token?

5
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,600
This is a secret guard token
from Prime Minister's Mansion.

6
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,960
Where did you get it?

7
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:45,210
Yesterday, someone attempted
to assassinate Wen Rou.

8
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:46,870
This was obtained from them.

9
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,650
Prime Minister Ye,
is there anything else you'd like to say?

10
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:56,780
This is indeed a token
from Prime Minister's Mansion.

11
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:57,840
But I

12
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:59,660
had no knowledge of this matter.

13
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,460
You have served the court for many years.

14
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:04,560
I believe you know well what you should do

15
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,020
and what you shouldn't do.

16
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:08,230
Keep your subordinates in check,

17
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:09,630
as well as your daughter.

18
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,720
Rest assured, Your Highness.

19
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:18,210
You and I

20
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:19,660
are in the same boat.

21
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:22,020
If you become the crown prince,

22
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,210
the Ye family

23
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:25,380
will be

24
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,060
your most steadfast support.

25
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:30,270
I hope you remember what you said today.

26
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:32,450
Your Highness, rest assured.

27
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,500
If there's nothing else,

28
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:41,370
I'll take my leave.

29
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:54,479
Prime Minister.

30
00:01:58,229 --> 00:01:59,120
Prince Zhibai.

31
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:00,070
Prime Minister,

32
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:01,550
where are you going?

33
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,470
I am on my way to report official matters
to His Majesty.

34
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:08,750
As a meritorious official of our dynasty,

35
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,289
you can't escape court affairs

36
00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:11,950
even at the Hot Spring Palace.

37
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,230
As an official,

38
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,450
it is my duty.

39
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,280
You care about the world.

40
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,000
You're a loyal and devoted official.

41
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,930
I'm not like you.

42
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,360
All I ever want
is to live a leisurely life,

43
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,470
and I have no interest

44
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:28,030
in court affairs.

45
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:29,030
Mother

46
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,810
has scolded me a lot for it.

47
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:33,290
It's getting late.

48
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:35,240
I must go pay my respects to her now.

49
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:37,350
Take care, Prince Zhibai.

50
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,350
Your arm's injury hasn't healed.

51
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,470
Earlier,

52
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,390
you said I'm from Chen State.

53
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,430
What if someday,

54
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,590
the fact that you've hidden my identity

55
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:33,710
is exposed?

56
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,790
Since I chose to bring you back,

57
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:37,079
I will protect you.

58
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:38,960
But my current identity

59
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,370
is your younger sister.

60
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,790
If what's between us

61
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:43,210
is discovered by others,

62
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,250
would Father...

63
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:44,660
No.

64
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:46,280
Would His Majesty

65
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,410
do something to you?

66
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:49,190
You're meant to be the crown prince.

67
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:50,150
you can't afford

68
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:51,280
a scandal like this.

69
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:59,510
Since you're asking me this,

70
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:00,790
it means

71
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:04,250
you must have feelings for me too.

72
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,340
You're teasing me on purpose.

73
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:10,220
Don't worry.

74
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,500
I'll take care of everything.

75
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:31,720
Brother,

76
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,920
what is it you want to show me?

77
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,720
I've prepared a surprise for you.

78
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,030
What beautiful fireworks!

79
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,320
Father just issued a decree.

80
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,270
We're returning to the palace tomorrow.

81
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,270
Life in the palace

82
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:27,840
isn't as free as it is
at the Hot Spring Palace.

83
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,950
So I wanted you to see

84
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,520
these most beautiful fireworks.

85
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:37,320
Thank you, Brother.

86
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:40,430
The fireworks are truly beautiful.

87
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,480
I know you're still hesitating,

88
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:54,920
but I'll give you all the time you need.

89
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,380
As long as you are willing,

90
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:59,070
my hand will always be here.
