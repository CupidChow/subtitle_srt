[The Blade of Romance]

2
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:10,870
[Episode 13]

3
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:17,330
Are you okay?

4
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:21,130
I'm fine.

5
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:22,900
After what he did,

6
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:24,640
don't you hate him?

7
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,070
What's the point

8
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:28,290
of talking about this now?

9
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:30,520
You shouldn't have fallen for him.

10
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,020
I can help you.

11
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:50,710
No need.

12
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:53,910
Since this is his choice,

13
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:56,580
I'll let him have it.

14
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:04,260
Once you arrive at the General's Mansion,

15
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,850
I'll find a way to rescue you.

16
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:07,310
Don't do anything stupid.

17
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:13,950
Your Highness.

18
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:15,140
Please get in the sedan chair quickly.

19
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:16,460
Don't miss the auspicious time.

20
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:18,590
Your Highness, you may escort
the bride only this far,

21
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:19,789
no need to go further.

22
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:43,680
Lift the sedan chair!

23
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,260
Your Highness.

24
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,340
Outside the General's Mansion,

25
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,760
I've made all the arrangements.

26
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,040
When the wedding ceremony begins,

27
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,870
chaos will break out
in the General's Mansion.

28
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:06,450
At that moment,

29
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:07,200
we can

30
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:07,870
rescue her.

31
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,120
But...

32
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,530
Are you sure you want to do this?

33
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,560
This time,

34
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:21,960
I must save her.

35
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,590
Set down the sedan chair.

36
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:44,329
Your Highness.

37
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:46,400
Brother.

38
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:48,800
Princess Wen Rou is getting married
by imperial decree.

39
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,060
The auspicious time is approaching.

40
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:51,060
We must not delay.

41
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,400
I just want to speak

42
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,800
with Wen Rou for a moment.

43
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:54,780
Step aside.

44
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,530
As you wish, Your Highness.

45
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,040
Everyone, leave us.

46
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:49,480
You came to tell me

47
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,840
that all of this is a lie?

48
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,500
That I don't have to marry,

49
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,300
and you won't be taking a wife?

50
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:05,980
For the throne,

51
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,100
I have no choice.

52
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:11,930
Don't hate me.

53
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:35,190
This is...

54
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,480
Today

55
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:38,970
I'm staging a palace coup.

56
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,360
You must trust me.

57
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,560
I will never let you

58
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,430
marry Zhou Fu.

59
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,080
All right,

60
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,000
I trust you.

61
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,100
I'll wait for you.

62
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,200
We're done here.

63
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:31,000
Wen Rou.

64
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,350
No matter what we face,

65
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:36,800
you have never been

66
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,060
a choice I made by weighing pros and cons.

67
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,040
Whatever the cost,

68
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,770
I will protect you completely.

69
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:45,920
This is the only way now

70
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:48,680
to keep you away from

71
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,280
all these schemes and plots,

72
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:54,270
away from this prison-like palace.

73
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,600
Actually, her marrying Zhou Fu

74
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,860
isn't such a bad thing.

75
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,750
Compared to the imperial palace,

76
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:09,980
with her in the General's Mansion,

77
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:10,870
it will actually be easier for us

78
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:11,670
to rescue her.

79
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:20,000
First, find a way to see her

80
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:21,960
and tell her about our plan.

81
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:22,990
All right.

82
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,160
You may go now.

83
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:27,630
Yes.

84
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,780
Your Highness.

85
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:34,530
Zhibai.

86
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:36,270
What big plan are you discussing?

87
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,310
Does it involve Wen Rou?

88
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:37,840
Brother.

89
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,100
Whatever I do next,

90
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:41,430
don't get involved.

91
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,180
So rescuing Wen Rou

92
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:44,720
is also about competing for the throne?

93
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,600
I can help you.

94
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:45,950
Brother...

95
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:47,010
Don't do anything,

96
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:48,750
just listen to me.

97
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:49,400
Alright.

98
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:50,530
I'll do as you say.

99
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:16,460
Where on earth has Zhiyuan gone?

100
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,930
Why hasn't he come for so long?

101
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:52,070
Zhiyuan

102
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,070
is going to defy the imperial order?
