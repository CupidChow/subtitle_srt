[The Blade of Romance]

2
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:10,910
[Episode 23]

3
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:20,450
My name is Zhifeng,

4
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:21,840
from the Zhifeng Grass.

5
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,730
I'm from Chen State.

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,180
What about you?

7
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,020
I'm the cousin of the Liang State's envoy.

8
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:27,830
I’m Bai Cheng.

9
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:28,920
And you?

10
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:31,660
I'm from Xirui.

11
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:32,380
Lan.

12
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:40,670
They're over there!

13
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:41,330
Chase them!

14
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:42,960
Chase them!

15
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:43,320
Run!

16
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:44,640
Don't let them catch you!

17
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,000
Stop!

18
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,210
Don't look back!

19
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,320
Stop right there!

20
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:49,890
They're catching up!

21
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,200
Let's fight them!

22
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,200
I'll protect you.

23
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:52,840
No,

24
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,130
if we continue like this,

25
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:55,390
none of us will escape.

26
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:56,170
How about

27
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:57,150
we split up?

28
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,650
I'll draw them away.

29
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:00,150
You two go in different directions.

30
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:01,430
Whoever gets help first,

31
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:02,580
come back to save the other.

32
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:03,190
No!

33
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,570
The best strategy is to run.

34
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:08,430
If one gets away, that’s a win.

35
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,890
Is that really how the 36 tactics work?

36
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:12,510
That's not the point.

37
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:14,170
Then I'll go back for help.

38
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:14,970
Good.

39
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:15,890
Let's go.

40
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:22,800
Let’s see where you’re running to.

41
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:27,910
What happened to him?

42
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,060
He was caught while trying to escape.

43
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,150
Tell us.

44
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:33,030
Tell us, or I’ll kill him.

45
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:35,729
I know where the thing you want is.

46
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,310
I'll take you there.

47
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:37,840
Zhifeng.

48
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:38,950
Don't go!

49
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:40,750
Let's go.

50
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,710
Let her go!

51
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:44,870
Let her go!

52
00:01:45,289 --> 00:01:46,170
Zhifeng!

53
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,000
Zhifeng!

54
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,120
Zhifeng!

55
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,509
Zhifeng!

56
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,290
You're here.

57
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,470
I haven't congratulated you
for getting what you wanted.

58
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:25,570
Now that you're
the crown prince of Liang State.

59
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:26,520
Wait until I take the throne,

60
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,280
and then you can congratulate me.

61
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,840
Because of Wen Zhiyuan,

62
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,960
Liang's emperor is seriously ill.

63
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,400
The internal turmoil is subsiding,

64
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,460
and your ascension

65
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,310
is just a matter of time.

66
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:36,450
What about you?

67
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,829
What are your plans for the future?

68
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,240
I never thought

69
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:49,210
I would have a chance to plan my future.

70
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:51,880
Now, I have nothing.

71
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,280
No parents.

72
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,800
No home.

73
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,800
Where should I go?

74
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:08,890
Miss Song,

75
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,240
this is a letter from the master.

76
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:20,070
Miss Song,

77
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:22,070
I'm leaving.

78
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:31,520
[For the personal attention of Zhifeng]

79
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:39,720
Zhifeng.

80
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:41,960
I am Lan from the grassland.

81
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,110
My real name is

82
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,360
Li Shiyan.

83
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,570
I was the crown prince of Xirui.

84
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:53,530
The iron cavalry of Liang's emperor

85
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:55,220
destroyed everything I had.

86
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,360
Xirui fell.

87
00:03:58,430 --> 00:03:59,079
And I

88
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,030
also lost

89
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:02,450
my identity as Li Shiyan.

90
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,630
For revenge,

91
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:08,110
I took Wen Zhiyuan's identity

92
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,700
and infiltrated
the Southern Liang Imperial Palace.

93
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:11,520
The witch doctor said,

94
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,320
from today on,

95
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,920
this look belongs to you.

96
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,750
From now on,

97
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:16,370
you are the third prince of Liang State,

98
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:17,170
Wen Zhiyuan.

99
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,500
And you're no longer the prince of Xirui,

100
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,310
Li Shiyan.

101
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:26,630
I originally wanted to
fight for the throne

102
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:28,870
so there would be
no more war in this world.

103
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:29,830
There would be no more people like me

104
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:32,159
whose country and family were destroyed.

105
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,040
But things didn't go as planned.

106
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,890
I was caught up in it all.

107
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:41,230
And I sank deeper and deeper,

108
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,170
gradually losing control.

109
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:46,600
I became a tool

110
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,930
to satisfy Liang's emperor's ambitions.

111
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:52,030
I let iron cavalry crush your homeland.

112
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:56,630
I had no choice.

113
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,240
If I hadn’t obeyed Liang's emperor,

114
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,180
I wouldn’t be in this position today.

115
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:16,800
I met you when we were young.

116
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:18,270
I gave you a dagger.

117
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,720
This is...

118
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,590
Zhifeng Grass.

119
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:33,690
Here you go.

120
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:35,220
You need to hold it flat.

121
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:37,270
I missed.

122
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:42,920
It wasn't me.

123
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:44,360
You little brat,

124
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,000
how dare you hit me.

125
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,920
Can't catch me.

126
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,240
Cheng,

127
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,430
help me catch him.

128
00:05:50,659 --> 00:05:51,000
Okay.

129
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,360
Now you can't escape.

130
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,800
You dared to tug on my ear.

131
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,430
Can't catch me!

132
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:08,750
If only these days

133
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:10,450
could continue.

134
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,170
Unfortunately,

135
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:14,320
I’m about to go home with my father.

136
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:16,820
I'll be leaving soon too,

137
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:17,890
and I don't know

138
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:19,320
when we'll meet again.

139
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:21,560
There are times
when we gather and separate.

140
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,070
I'll be waiting for you all in Xirui.

141
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:24,680
You guys remember to come find me.

142
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,270
Sure.

143
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:26,830
Next time we meet,

144
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:27,870
I’ll surely be

145
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:29,270
a female general by then.

146
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,950
Then I want to be

147
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,800
a great scholar, writing books.

148
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,130
What about you?

149
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,360
I want to become

150
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:40,040
someone who can protect everyone,

151
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:40,930
allowing people

152
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:42,240
on the land of Xirui

153
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,830
to have enough food and clothing,

154
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:45,630
living in peace and prosperity.

155
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,870
Then may we all

156
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:48,830
become

157
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,159
the people we want to be.

158
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,480
From now on.

159
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,240
I am the mighty

160
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,150
general.

161
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:02,000
Don't worry,

162
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,830
I've got your backs.

163
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:04,520
Good.

164
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,240
After our farewell on the grassland,

165
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,300
I thought we'd be separated forever.

166
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,130
But unexpectedly,

167
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,680
by some twist of fate,

168
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,870
you came to my side.

169
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:23,990
The joy of finding something lost again

170
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:27,070
is beyond words.

171
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,600
Fate is cruel.

172
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:37,630
To you,

173
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,840
I am your father’s murderer.

174
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:42,360
I have no excuse.

175
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:46,270
And I know that between us,
it’s a deadlock.

176
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:47,310
No solution.

177
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,770
But after you lost your memory,

178
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,890
I indulged in those moments of happiness.

179
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,159
I dared not ask for your forgiveness

180
00:07:58,159 --> 00:08:00,690
for my selfishness
and despicable behavior.

181
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,540
But having these
fleeting moments with you,

182
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:06,390
I have no regrets.

183
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,600
I've done too many wrong things,

184
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,400
and there's no turning back now.

185
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,450
But even if everyone condemns me,

186
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:14,780
I still have no regrets.

187
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:16,950
In the end,

188
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:18,390
what I long for most

189
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:20,050
is to return to that grassland

190
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,190
and back to those carefree days

191
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:23,510
we once had.

192
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:26,630
If possible,

193
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:29,040
you must go see it for me.

194
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:33,549
To see this peaceful world

195
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,000
and the country in tranquility.

196
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,570
If the wind blows in the future,

197
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:46,050
it will be me coming to see you.

♪ The faint moonlight casts a cold glow
from afar ♪

199
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:55,310
♪ Through walls of longing,
thoughts freeze into scars ♪

200
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:59,310
♪ All the pain in this world is but
love and hate that linger on ♪

201
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:02,870
♪ Drunken, I swallow sorrow whole,
with dreams as my only solace ♪

202
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:07,110
♪ Fate's cruel hand, no soul can defy ♪

203
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:10,630
♪ I can only blame this heart
for the wounds that cut so deep ♪

204
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:14,670
♪ If there's no cure for this pain I own ♪

205
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:19,950
♪ I'd rather drift alone, unknown,
in time's cold flow ♪
