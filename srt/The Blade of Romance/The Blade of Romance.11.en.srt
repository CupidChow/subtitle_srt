[The Blade of Romance]

00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:10,890
[Episode 11]

3
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:20,120
Wen Rou.

4
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:21,440
Miss Ye.

5
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:26,050
Don't you know to show proper respect
when you see me?

6
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:28,430
Still haven't learned proper manners?

7
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:32,280
Once I become your sister-in-law,

8
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,210
you'll be the one kowtowing

9
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:35,770
and paying respects to me.

10
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:37,610
I sent

11
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,840
assassins after you,

12
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,170
but there's nothing you can do to me
about it.

13
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:43,430
My marriage to Zhiyuan

14
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,290
is by His Majesty's decree.

15
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:46,880
No matter what,

16
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:48,420
I will marry him.

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,200
He won't marry you.

18
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:54,560
He will.

19
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:57,520
Because

20
00:00:57,950 --> 00:00:59,150
I can help him get

21
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:00,710
what he truly desires.

22
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:02,620
As for you,

23
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,120
you're nothing

24
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,680
but a hostage princess

25
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,680
raised in Chen State.

26
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:10,070
Moreover,

27
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,270
if His Majesty knew

28
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:14,550
you were seducing your own brother,

29
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,340
what do you think would happen to you?

30
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:41,710
What's wrong?

31
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,370
You seem troubled.

32
00:01:49,789 --> 00:01:51,850
You're going to marry another woman.

33
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:52,740
No, I won't.

34
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:57,039
But here in this palace,

35
00:01:58,070 --> 00:01:59,530
we are brother and sister.

36
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,050
Even if there's no Ye Xiyao,

37
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,290
there will be other women eventually,
right?

38
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,750
I won't marry anyone else.

39
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:15,760
I promised you,

40
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:17,400
and I won't let you down.

41
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:19,310
So, no matter what happens...

42
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,190
you can trust me.

43
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:30,280
I'll take care of everything.

44
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:30,800
Okay.

45
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:32,310
I trust you.

46
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:51,260
Mother,

47
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,960
I've received news

48
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:54,190
that General Zhou Fu

49
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:56,790
has sent a formal visiting card
to Wen Zhiyuan.

50
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,190
Zhou Fu is by nature brutal

51
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:07,040
and glory-seeking.

52
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:09,350
He keeps more than a dozen concubines
in his household—

53
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:10,480
utterly debauched.

54
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,940
Although your father favors him,

55
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:14,870
Wen Zhiyuan

56
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:17,240
is unlikely to truly ally with him.

57
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:19,440
Why would you say that, Mother?

58
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,940
To secure Zhou Fu's loyalty, your father

59
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:25,079
has bestowed a marriage upon him.

60
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,720
He wants to marry Wen Rou to him.

61
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,280
What?

62
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,079
But Zhou Fu is more than

63
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:30,200
ten years older than Wen Rou.

64
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,600
Have you forgotten about

65
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:33,590
Wen Rou and Wen Zhiyuan's affair?

66
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,079
How could His Majesty tolerate that?

67
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:37,800
By doing this, His Majesty will
surely drive

68
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,260
Wen Zhiyuan to harbor treasonous thoughts.

69
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,000
So, how could he

70
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:43,490
possibly

71
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,079
ally with Zhou Fu?

72
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:46,960
By now,

73
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:50,570
the imperial decree should have arrived at
Jiaxiang Palace.

74
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:53,870
I have matters to attend to,

75
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:55,530
so I'll take my leave, Mother.

76
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:03,870
Zhibai,

77
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:04,840
what brings you here?

78
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,430
Come with me.

79
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:07,490
There's something I need to tell you.

80
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,340
Wen Zhibai,

81
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,280
what are you doing?

82
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,240
Explain yourself clearly.

83
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,150
Wen Zhiyuan is about to sell you out.

84
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:12,710
What?

85
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,680
Do you know

86
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,000
that Wen Zhiyuan, for the throne,

87
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,360
is going to marry Ye Xiyao?

88
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:16,870
Father has decreed

89
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,140
that you are to marry Zhou Fu.

90
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:19,360
For the throne and power,

91
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,390
he will cast you aside.

92
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:21,120
Impossible.

93
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,600
What nonsense are you talking about?

94
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,660
This is His Majesty's verbal decree.

95
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:28,750
By His Majesty's verbal decree,

96
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,170
Seventh Princess Wen Rou

97
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:31,400
has acted improperly in matters of virtue

98
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,860
and will be confined in
the imperial prison pending judgment.

99
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,460
Eunuch Liu,

100
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,800
what do you mean?

101
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,100
Your Highness,

102
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:40,810
this is His Majesty's decree.

103
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,610
Please come with us.

104
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:46,159
Wen Rou is a princess after all.

105
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:48,070
How can she be sent to a place
like the imperial prison?

106
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,930
Prince Zhibai, Princess Wen Rou,

107
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,100
are you defying the imperial decree?

108
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,540
Go find my brother.

109
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:03,560
I'll go with you.

110
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,030
This way, Your Highness.

111
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,280
Something bad must have happened.

112
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:22,050
Is he alright?

113
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:27,890
Father.

114
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,630
You still dare to call me that?

115
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:33,080
I don't know what I've done wrong

116
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,360
for you to imprison me.

117
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:35,740
You seduced your own brother,

118
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,800
setting off scandalous rumors
across the palace,

119
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,430
and yet you have the nerve to ask why?

120
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:40,000
I didn't!

121
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:42,790
Someone must be slandering and framing me.

122
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:44,850
Zhiyuan.

123
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:56,590
What do you say?

124
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,270
Father,

125
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:00,930
I know I was wrong.

126
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:02,310
Wen Rou,

127
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,190
you are of my blood,

128
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:06,900
so I will suppress this matter.

129
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:09,390
Reflect on your actions
in the imperial prison,

130
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:10,390
and in three days,

131
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,460
you will marry General Zhou.

132
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,100
He will not mistreat you.

133
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,270
What Wen Zhibai said

134
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,950
is all true.

135
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:19,120
All of this is for your own good.

136
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:21,960
As for Zhiyuan,

137
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:24,000
he will wed the Prime Minister's daughter,

138
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,360
Ye Xiyao.

139
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:27,440
From this day forth,

140
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,770
you must watch your words and actions

141
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:31,900
and abandon those foolish fantasies.

142
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:39,000
You're going to marry another woman.

143
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,460
I won't marry anyone else.

144
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,220
I promised you,

145
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:43,659
and I won't let you down.

146
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,480
So, no matter what happens,

147
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:47,560
you can trust me.

148
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:52,490
I've always been fond of you.

149
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,220
I just wanted you to know that.

150
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,530
Don't worry.

151
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:01,970
I'll take care of everything.

152
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:11,870
Let's go.
