(All characters, organizations,
places, entities, and events...)

00:00:55,607 --> 00:00:57,006
(in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:58,076 --> 00:00:59,076
Tae Poong!

4
00:01:03,346 --> 00:01:04,346
Mister.

5
00:01:06,116 --> 00:01:08,387
Mister! Wake up! Mister!

6
00:01:09,756 --> 00:01:10,887
What happened?

7
00:01:15,997 --> 00:01:17,067
Oh no.

8
00:01:19,126 --> 00:01:20,336
Are you okay?

9
00:01:20,796 --> 00:01:23,396
I'm not hurt at all.

10
00:01:23,707 --> 00:01:27,107
But I think Mr. Wi is dead.

11
00:01:27,777 --> 00:01:28,807
No.

12
00:01:29,807 --> 00:01:31,107
He's okay.

13
00:01:32,107 --> 00:01:33,177
He'll be okay.

14
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:37,146
No. I think he died.

15
00:01:37,287 --> 00:01:39,987
He isn't moving.

16
00:01:41,656 --> 00:01:43,016
He isn't dead.

17
00:01:43,587 --> 00:01:45,357
I don't think he
was hit very hard.

18
00:01:47,027 --> 00:01:49,697
That's right. I did not die.

19
00:01:49,997 --> 00:01:52,197
No. I'm perfectly fine.

20
00:01:53,566 --> 00:01:54,596
Tae Poong!

21
00:01:57,137 --> 00:01:58,167
No!

22
00:02:10,417 --> 00:02:12,686
But I couldn't waste
this opportunity.

23
00:02:34,107 --> 00:02:36,137
I pray to every deity up there.

24
00:02:36,376 --> 00:02:39,806
Please don't let Mr. Wi die.

25
00:02:39,807 --> 00:02:41,816
Please don't let him die.

26
00:02:44,046 --> 00:02:47,316
He's fine other than the scratch
on his head, so don't worry.

27
00:02:52,686 --> 00:02:54,926
I really think he's awake.

28
00:02:54,927 --> 00:02:56,497
How can you make
jokes right now?

29
00:02:56,696 --> 00:02:58,397
I'm not joking. Look.

30
00:02:58,897 --> 00:03:00,267
The doctor says he's fine too.

31
00:03:03,497 --> 00:03:06,936
I pray to every deity up there.
Please shut that punk's mouth.

32
00:03:07,406 --> 00:03:08,577
Should I tickle him?

33
00:03:12,376 --> 00:03:13,446
Stop it.

34
00:03:14,117 --> 00:03:15,915
If I tickle him and
he doesn't wake up,

35
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:17,087
I'll quit all my games.

36
00:03:17,316 --> 00:03:18,546
Do you mean it?

37
00:03:18,547 --> 00:03:21,117
If he doesn't wake up, you
have to quit all your games.

38
00:03:21,686 --> 00:03:23,855
And what if he moves?

39
00:03:23,856 --> 00:03:25,286
Then you can be our leader.

40
00:03:25,827 --> 00:03:27,625
Then he's below me too.

41
00:03:27,626 --> 00:03:28,725
Obviously.

42
00:03:28,726 --> 00:03:30,926
He can't be head of the
house if he's lying about this.

43
00:03:31,327 --> 00:03:32,367
Okay.

44
00:03:37,807 --> 00:03:41,436
No. Don't do it.
Don't do it. Don't.

45
00:04:16,677 --> 00:04:18,946
- Where am I?
- Are you okay?

46
00:04:19,177 --> 00:04:21,747
Yes. Da Jung.

47
00:04:22,446 --> 00:04:25,147
- How's Tae Poong.
- I'm totally fine.

48
00:04:27,057 --> 00:04:28,087
I'm glad.

49
00:04:29,356 --> 00:04:31,886
I'm so glad. I'm glad.

50
00:04:33,827 --> 00:04:34,957
I'm glad.

51
00:04:38,596 --> 00:04:39,696
- Sir.
- Yes?

52
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:42,997
I'm sorry for changing
the item on the day of.

53
00:04:43,536 --> 00:04:46,837
It's okay. It's the charm
of a live broadcast.

54
00:04:48,106 --> 00:04:50,177
Wi Dae Han, gosh.

55
00:04:50,376 --> 00:04:53,916
Does he want to do politics
that badly, that he'd use children?

56
00:04:55,676 --> 00:04:58,017
What do you mean?

57
00:04:58,717 --> 00:05:01,757
I read in the article that
he kicked them out at first.

58
00:05:01,986 --> 00:05:03,757
It's obvious.

59
00:05:04,087 --> 00:05:05,386
After kicking them out,

60
00:05:05,387 --> 00:05:09,556
he realized the kids could help
him and weren't just a burden.

61
00:05:09,796 --> 00:05:11,567
You don't know that.

62
00:05:11,996 --> 00:05:15,236
He could've felt responsible
as the dad and felt bad for them.

63
00:05:15,637 --> 00:05:17,207
That may be why he took them in.

64
00:05:17,866 --> 00:05:20,476
And that's the attitude
of a proper politician.

65
00:05:21,036 --> 00:05:23,207
You are so naive.

66
00:05:23,507 --> 00:05:25,246
Do you think that too, Mr. Kang?

67
00:05:26,306 --> 00:05:27,345
I don't know.

68
00:05:27,346 --> 00:05:30,517
That's what I'd like to believe.

69
00:05:32,387 --> 00:05:36,087
There is a politician who has
been the talk of the day online.

70
00:05:36,387 --> 00:05:39,055
Former Assemblyman Wi Dae Han,

71
00:05:39,056 --> 00:05:40,957
who was the youngest
Assemblyman ever.

72
00:05:41,356 --> 00:05:44,327
The teenage girl, who said
she was his biological daughter,

73
00:05:44,567 --> 00:05:47,566
posted online that
Assemblyman Wi took her in...

74
00:05:47,567 --> 00:05:50,066
and her three younger
siblings as family...

75
00:05:50,067 --> 00:05:52,967
after they became orphaned.

76
00:05:53,467 --> 00:05:55,735
After a video of Assemblyman
Wi saving the youngest brother...

77
00:05:55,736 --> 00:05:57,707
of the girl was posted online,

78
00:05:58,106 --> 00:06:01,447
the interest in Assemblyman
Wi is growing more and more.

79
00:06:01,647 --> 00:06:02,647
Tae Poong!

80
00:06:02,648 --> 00:06:05,817
(Video Submitted by Viewer)

81
00:06:08,087 --> 00:06:09,887
Wake up, Mister!

82
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:13,356
- That was so close.
- He's amazing.

83
00:06:15,496 --> 00:06:16,697
That's pretty good.

84
00:06:17,567 --> 00:06:19,897
Wi Dae Han may make it back.

85
00:06:26,236 --> 00:06:27,906
(Episode 4: We Need a Superman)

86
00:06:28,106 --> 00:06:30,577
It all happened so quickly.

87
00:06:31,707 --> 00:06:34,377
All I could think about at the
time was that I had to save him.

88
00:06:35,017 --> 00:06:38,647
I believe any father
would've done the same.

89
00:06:39,546 --> 00:06:41,686
Isn't that Wi Dae Han?

90
00:06:41,687 --> 00:06:42,786
Hey, there.

91
00:06:44,556 --> 00:06:46,356
You did a great thing.

92
00:06:46,687 --> 00:06:47,957
You're a man of dignity.

93
00:06:48,296 --> 00:06:51,226
A man of dignity?
You're embarrassing me.

94
00:06:51,596 --> 00:06:53,837
- Do you feel okay?
- Yes.

95
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:57,736
Well...

96
00:06:58,067 --> 00:07:01,776
You see, I was hit
by a city bus this big.

97
00:07:01,777 --> 00:07:03,846
So people thought I was dead.

98
00:07:04,246 --> 00:07:07,717
I lost consciousness
briefly due to a concussion.

99
00:07:07,976 --> 00:07:10,416
But luckily, the CT
scan came back clear.

100
00:07:10,616 --> 00:07:13,517
People like you should
be in the Assembly,

101
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:17,786
but it's filled
with con artists.

102
00:07:19,757 --> 00:07:22,555
If I run in the next election,
you have to vote for me then.

103
00:07:22,556 --> 00:07:25,095
Of course. I'll vote for
you again and again.

104
00:07:25,096 --> 00:07:27,436
Thank you. You promised.

105
00:07:27,437 --> 00:07:30,095
Assemblyman Wi, us too.

106
00:07:30,096 --> 00:07:32,466
What? How can you...

107
00:07:32,467 --> 00:07:33,937
We want a picture with you.

108
00:07:35,777 --> 00:07:36,936
Here we go.

109
00:07:36,937 --> 00:07:38,447
1, 2, 3.

110
00:07:39,546 --> 00:07:41,576
Thank you. You were so cool.

111
00:07:41,577 --> 00:07:42,646
- Study hard.
- Okay.

112
00:07:42,647 --> 00:07:45,616
- May I get a picture too?
- Sure.

113
00:07:46,116 --> 00:07:48,785
- Well...
- There.

114
00:07:48,786 --> 00:07:50,485
Me too.

115
00:07:50,486 --> 00:07:52,485
May I get one too?

116
00:07:52,486 --> 00:07:54,757
- Thank you.
- Sure. Goodnight.

117
00:07:55,726 --> 00:07:56,757
Okay.

118
00:07:59,296 --> 00:08:00,366
Are you okay?

119
00:08:03,437 --> 00:08:04,467
Thank you.

120
00:08:10,207 --> 00:08:11,976
It's on me, so eat up.

121
00:08:14,176 --> 00:08:16,916
Four more orders
of rib-eye, please.

122
00:08:17,077 --> 00:08:18,147
Okay.

123
00:08:18,517 --> 00:08:21,887
Assemblyman Wi, I eat
rib-eye only on my birthday.

124
00:08:22,116 --> 00:08:24,556
Hey. It's not for me.

125
00:08:24,986 --> 00:08:28,155
Tae Poong goes
crazy for beef. Right?

126
00:08:28,156 --> 00:08:29,725
Beef is the best!

127
00:08:29,726 --> 00:08:30,827
It's the best.

128
00:08:31,127 --> 00:08:33,266
Three bowls of cold
noodles too, please.

129
00:08:33,267 --> 00:08:34,267
Okay.

130
00:08:34,967 --> 00:08:37,836
Just pretend today
is your birthday.

131
00:08:37,837 --> 00:08:39,507
He's so petty.

132
00:08:39,606 --> 00:08:42,437
Are you his minion?

133
00:08:42,577 --> 00:08:43,606
What?

134
00:08:46,577 --> 00:08:49,615
No, I'm not his
minion. I'm his aide.

135
00:08:49,616 --> 00:08:52,046
Right now, I'm the
aide to the Mayor of Inju.

136
00:08:52,116 --> 00:08:53,957
What's an aide?

137
00:08:54,856 --> 00:08:58,187
A person who helps people like
Assemblymen do their job well.

138
00:08:58,226 --> 00:09:00,286
That's a minion.

139
00:09:03,127 --> 00:09:04,127
Well...

140
00:09:07,127 --> 00:09:08,366
She's Song Yi, right?

141
00:09:09,996 --> 00:09:11,235
You're so cute.

142
00:09:11,236 --> 00:09:14,006
Don't you have any
questions for me?

143
00:09:15,207 --> 00:09:19,846
Guess what's the
smallest war ever waged?

144
00:09:20,506 --> 00:09:22,417
The smallest war...

145
00:09:22,846 --> 00:09:25,515
I guess the war
between siblings?

146
00:09:25,516 --> 00:09:27,787
Wrong. It's minimum wage.

147
00:09:32,327 --> 00:09:35,495
My gosh. I guess
it was a riddle.

148
00:09:35,496 --> 00:09:38,996
Do you know what
minimum wage is?

149
00:09:39,096 --> 00:09:42,736
No. I know that you
wage a war though.

150
00:09:44,407 --> 00:09:47,605
"Wage" has two
distinct meanings.

151
00:09:47,606 --> 00:09:50,407
The "wage" in "minimum
wage" isn't to wage a war.

152
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:54,416
It means pay received in exchange
for labor. Thus, it means money.

153
00:09:54,417 --> 00:09:57,586
Thus, "minimum wage"
isn't to wage a small war,

154
00:09:57,587 --> 00:09:59,416
but the minimum standard...

155
00:09:59,417 --> 00:10:02,057
for wages determined
by the government.

156
00:10:04,526 --> 00:10:05,756
You understand, right?

157
00:10:07,596 --> 00:10:09,126
You freak.

158
00:10:09,797 --> 00:10:11,967
Mr. Minion is super weird.

159
00:10:13,697 --> 00:10:15,337
You don't have
any friends, do you?

160
00:10:17,567 --> 00:10:20,406
What do you mean?
I have a lot of friends.

161
00:10:20,407 --> 00:10:23,307
I'm totally in the in-crowd.

162
00:10:26,106 --> 00:10:28,547
I understand.

163
00:10:28,577 --> 00:10:31,515
Hang in there. Come
over if you feel lonely.

164
00:10:31,516 --> 00:10:32,817
You're always welcome.

165
00:10:37,626 --> 00:10:38,726
Outside.

166
00:10:41,697 --> 00:10:44,327
Eat up. Eat.

167
00:10:47,736 --> 00:10:50,495
I need to eat. What is it?

168
00:10:50,496 --> 00:10:53,207
Those kids are no joke.

169
00:10:54,106 --> 00:10:56,235
Don't get me started. I'm dying.

170
00:10:56,236 --> 00:10:58,345
I almost died for real today.

171
00:10:58,346 --> 00:11:02,316
Still, the public sentiment flipped
because of what happened today.

172
00:11:02,317 --> 00:11:05,087
The people are calling
you "National Dad" online.

173
00:11:05,317 --> 00:11:08,116
National Dad? Goodness.

174
00:11:08,516 --> 00:11:11,587
Anyway, I got my first request in
three years to go on a radio show.

175
00:11:12,226 --> 00:11:15,057
Did you meet Da Jung's uncle?

176
00:11:15,096 --> 00:11:18,426
I did, but he said he had
to go out of town for work,

177
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:20,126
and only signed the
kids' transfer form.

178
00:11:21,167 --> 00:11:23,236
What did he tell the reporter?

179
00:11:23,396 --> 00:11:27,066
I only said what I heard.

180
00:11:27,067 --> 00:11:29,876
That Assemblyman Wi
looked into orphanages at first.

181
00:11:30,077 --> 00:11:33,146
How could he twist
that so terribly like that?

182
00:11:33,476 --> 00:11:36,476
There's a reason why
reporters get a bad rap.

183
00:11:36,717 --> 00:11:38,416
Thank goodness for what
happened with Tae Poong.

184
00:11:38,417 --> 00:11:40,817
Otherwise, it would've been
the end right after you started.

185
00:11:43,687 --> 00:11:45,726
That reporter is one of
Kang Kyung Hoon's people.

186
00:11:46,226 --> 00:11:47,996
I'm sure it was his doing.

187
00:11:48,526 --> 00:11:50,866
He wants to get rid of
you before you can get big.

188
00:11:52,327 --> 00:11:54,337
You have a lot of supporters.

189
00:11:54,437 --> 00:11:56,197
The mayor seemed interested too.

190
00:11:57,606 --> 00:11:58,865
Han Soo?

191
00:11:58,866 --> 00:11:59,966
He told me...

192
00:11:59,967 --> 00:12:03,106
to support you so you
can rise to the surface.

193
00:12:06,246 --> 00:12:09,746
What is he up to? He didn't
call once after I lost the election.

194
00:12:15,717 --> 00:12:18,225
Mr. Nam met with
the kids' uncle,

195
00:12:18,226 --> 00:12:20,457
and he said there
was nothing suspicious.

196
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:23,226
It may be a good
thing that Dae Han...

197
00:12:23,626 --> 00:12:25,567
rose to the surface.

198
00:12:25,697 --> 00:12:27,396
It's a good thing?

199
00:12:27,837 --> 00:12:30,196
We can use him to
motivate Joon Ho...

200
00:12:30,197 --> 00:12:32,136
to enter into politics.

201
00:12:38,677 --> 00:12:40,076
Here's Mayor Jung.

202
00:12:40,077 --> 00:12:41,077
What?

203
00:12:41,917 --> 00:12:42,947
My gosh.

204
00:12:43,217 --> 00:12:44,816
Mr. Mayor. Funny
seeing you here.

205
00:12:44,817 --> 00:12:45,947
I know.

206
00:12:46,616 --> 00:12:48,985
You have an amazing swing.

207
00:12:48,986 --> 00:12:50,586
You've got a great form.

208
00:12:50,587 --> 00:12:54,087
I'm too weak, so it
doesn't go very far.

209
00:12:54,526 --> 00:12:57,526
With both golf and politics, it's
more about experience than power.

210
00:12:58,526 --> 00:13:00,426
That's why the
National Assembly...

211
00:13:00,427 --> 00:13:02,736
needs people like you with
many years of experience.

212
00:13:03,596 --> 00:13:07,306
I heard a rumor that you won't
be running in the next election.

213
00:13:07,307 --> 00:13:09,937
I was there for too long. I
overstayed my welcome.

214
00:13:10,577 --> 00:13:14,077
I should step aside for
someone young with vigor.

215
00:13:14,917 --> 00:13:17,817
Someone young with vigor.

216
00:13:18,246 --> 00:13:20,316
Do you mean
someone like your son?

217
00:13:20,317 --> 00:13:23,217
He has no interest
in entering politics.

218
00:13:23,516 --> 00:13:26,386
I won't force him
against his will.

219
00:13:27,327 --> 00:13:28,557
What a shame.

220
00:13:28,626 --> 00:13:30,826
I feel like he'd be
a great politician.

221
00:13:30,827 --> 00:13:32,297
You're too kind.

222
00:13:32,496 --> 00:13:35,635
Politics is about
serving the people.

223
00:13:35,636 --> 00:13:37,266
You need to have
a sense of duty.

224
00:13:38,707 --> 00:13:40,706
Why don't we have some coffee?

225
00:13:40,707 --> 00:13:42,307
- Sure.
- Let's go.

226
00:13:44,006 --> 00:13:45,547
That was good.

227
00:13:45,907 --> 00:13:48,416
Did you eat enough? Tae
Poong, did you eat a lot?

228
00:13:48,417 --> 00:13:50,316
I ate a lot.

229
00:13:50,317 --> 00:13:51,346
Song Yi?

230
00:13:52,217 --> 00:13:53,615
Tak, you too, right?

231
00:13:53,616 --> 00:13:56,557
Gosh. You'll have to do
a lot of designated driving.

232
00:13:56,856 --> 00:13:59,427
If you're done eating, let's go.

233
00:14:00,126 --> 00:14:03,826
Next up is "The Person of the
Week" in which we discuss...

234
00:14:03,827 --> 00:14:06,225
the most talked about
person of the week.

235
00:14:06,226 --> 00:14:09,037
Let's see who the person is.

236
00:14:09,136 --> 00:14:12,037
All I could think about at the
time was that I had to save him.

237
00:14:12,407 --> 00:14:16,476
I believe any father
would've done the same.

238
00:14:17,037 --> 00:14:19,606
Guys, Daddy's fine.

239
00:14:19,807 --> 00:14:21,947
Just grow up to be healthy.

240
00:14:22,516 --> 00:14:23,975
Okay.

241
00:14:23,976 --> 00:14:26,616
Soo Hyun should've
given me a heads up.

242
00:14:26,717 --> 00:14:29,985
Hold on. Let's watch
a little before we go.

243
00:14:29,986 --> 00:14:33,287
Assemblyman Wi Dae Han was
selected to be the Person of the Week.

244
00:14:33,427 --> 00:14:37,225
Some people say Assemblyman
Wi took in the children...

245
00:14:37,226 --> 00:14:40,625
in order to mend his image,
and are negative about him.

246
00:14:40,626 --> 00:14:42,396
Let's just go.

247
00:14:42,496 --> 00:14:44,067
You have school tomorrow.

248
00:14:44,236 --> 00:14:47,106
With designated
driving, and this.

249
00:14:47,236 --> 00:14:51,076
Those aren't actions
that appear to be an act.

250
00:14:51,077 --> 00:14:52,376
Let's watch that first.

251
00:14:52,876 --> 00:14:56,076
- What? What for? Let's go.
- What do you think?

252
00:14:56,077 --> 00:14:58,087
Even if the mourning and
the designated driving...

253
00:14:58,346 --> 00:15:00,216
were indeed just for show,

254
00:15:00,217 --> 00:15:02,516
I don't think it's a bad thing.

255
00:15:02,856 --> 00:15:04,016
However,

256
00:15:04,327 --> 00:15:07,327
pretending to be a dad
for a political agenda...

257
00:15:07,427 --> 00:15:08,957
is completely different.

258
00:15:10,967 --> 00:15:13,567
Because it can
hurt the children.

259
00:15:15,697 --> 00:15:16,896
I do not think...

260
00:15:17,297 --> 00:15:20,167
Assemblyman Wi
would've done such a thing.

261
00:15:27,106 --> 00:15:29,217
I hope he will become...

262
00:15:29,776 --> 00:15:33,386
a good father worthy of
the nickname "National Dad".

263
00:15:41,197 --> 00:15:42,255
Good work.

264
00:15:42,256 --> 00:15:43,426
Thank you.

265
00:15:43,427 --> 00:15:44,525
Thank you so much.

266
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:46,225
- Good work.
- Thank you.

267
00:15:46,226 --> 00:15:48,235
Thank you.

268
00:15:48,236 --> 00:15:50,566
I knew it. My gut
feeling is never wrong.

269
00:15:50,567 --> 00:15:52,865
I had a feeling Wi Dae
Han would be a great topic.

270
00:15:52,866 --> 00:15:54,475
The comments are
blowing up online.

271
00:15:54,476 --> 00:15:57,235
We may set a record in ratings.

272
00:15:57,236 --> 00:15:58,605
Seriously.

273
00:15:58,606 --> 00:16:01,875
The show went well. How
about we get some beer?

274
00:16:01,876 --> 00:16:03,077
Sounds good.

275
00:16:03,817 --> 00:16:05,115
Ms. Jung.

276
00:16:05,116 --> 00:16:07,416
Sorry. I wish I could,

277
00:16:07,417 --> 00:16:10,256
but my liver is refusing.
I've been so exhausted lately.

278
00:16:10,687 --> 00:16:12,287
Mr. Kang. You're free, right?

279
00:16:13,026 --> 00:16:16,826
I had a prior engagement
tonight. I'm sorry.

280
00:16:16,827 --> 00:16:18,365
What's with everyone?

281
00:16:18,366 --> 00:16:19,725
We'll join you next time.

282
00:16:19,726 --> 00:16:21,365
Fine. Let's go.

283
00:16:21,366 --> 00:16:23,037
- Sure.
- Let's go.

284
00:16:23,096 --> 00:16:24,667
- Right now. Let's go.
- Shall we?

285
00:16:24,837 --> 00:16:26,266
How's Tae Poong?

286
00:16:26,937 --> 00:16:29,077
He was in shock, but
he's fine physically.

287
00:16:29,407 --> 00:16:30,407
What about you?

288
00:16:30,408 --> 00:16:32,976
I hit my head hard on
the ground, but I'm fine.

289
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:36,817
I realized that a superhero's
blood flows through my veins.

290
00:16:37,516 --> 00:16:39,217
You're so full of yourself.

291
00:16:39,417 --> 00:16:41,386
It did remind me of college.

292
00:16:43,016 --> 00:16:44,187
What do you mean?

293
00:16:44,626 --> 00:16:47,026
You were kind of cool back then.

294
00:16:50,057 --> 00:16:52,126
Sorry, but can you give me that?

295
00:17:01,677 --> 00:17:02,707
Thanks.

296
00:17:05,846 --> 00:17:07,376
Did you write this yourself?

297
00:17:07,677 --> 00:17:09,776
Yes. Why do you ask?

298
00:17:10,917 --> 00:17:13,817
It's like the worst
handwriting I've ever seen.

299
00:17:13,886 --> 00:17:17,457
Who cares about handwriting?
The content is what matters.

300
00:17:18,226 --> 00:17:21,426
But it should be written neatly
so people can read it easily.

301
00:17:21,427 --> 00:17:24,496
That's true, but we don't
have enough people...

302
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:26,327
in the student council.

303
00:17:27,526 --> 00:17:30,967
I have very pretty handwriting.

304
00:17:41,476 --> 00:17:42,546
What about now?

305
00:17:42,877 --> 00:17:44,417
Now...

306
00:17:45,086 --> 00:17:46,217
Ms. Jung!

307
00:17:50,217 --> 00:17:53,325
I have to go now. You
must be tired. Rest up.

308
00:17:53,326 --> 00:17:54,326
What?

309
00:17:54,726 --> 00:17:56,556
Hey. What...

310
00:17:59,697 --> 00:18:02,867
Why did she stop in the middle of
a conversation? I'm curious now.

311
00:18:08,907 --> 00:18:10,607
I could've taken the bus.

312
00:18:11,707 --> 00:18:13,107
It's on the way anyway.

313
00:18:13,407 --> 00:18:16,647
But you're busy. You said
you had a prior engagement.

314
00:18:17,177 --> 00:18:18,217
This is it.

315
00:18:18,447 --> 00:18:19,486
What?

316
00:18:19,847 --> 00:18:21,857
Giving you a ride home.

317
00:18:22,457 --> 00:18:24,256
That was what I was going to do.

318
00:18:25,756 --> 00:18:28,197
Are you taking
lessons or something?

319
00:18:28,526 --> 00:18:29,926
- "Lessons"?
- Yes.

320
00:18:29,927 --> 00:18:31,766
Lessons for pick up lines.

321
00:18:33,127 --> 00:18:34,296
Was that too cheesy?

322
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:36,736
Yes. I think I need some
kimchi to wash that down.

323
00:18:39,806 --> 00:18:43,306
By the way, when are
you going to treat me?

324
00:18:44,236 --> 00:18:45,877
Oh, that.

325
00:18:47,947 --> 00:18:49,347
When are you free?

326
00:18:49,847 --> 00:18:51,016
How about Friday night?

327
00:18:52,286 --> 00:18:53,316
Okay.

328
00:18:55,857 --> 00:18:57,957
So what happened?
Are you having dinner?

329
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:00,857
Oh my gosh, that's
practically a date!

330
00:19:01,226 --> 00:19:02,427
No, it's not.

331
00:19:02,726 --> 00:19:04,496
You're terrible with romance.

332
00:19:05,867 --> 00:19:08,437
- Anyway, I don't like him.
- Why not?

333
00:19:09,036 --> 00:19:10,667
I like Dae Han.

334
00:19:12,536 --> 00:19:14,735
- Why?
- He's hot.

335
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:16,907
He even ran into
a bus to save a kid.

336
00:19:25,546 --> 00:19:27,346
They're all talk about how
the country is going down...

337
00:19:27,347 --> 00:19:28,755
due to the low birth rate.

338
00:19:28,756 --> 00:19:30,055
Someone like Assemblyman Wi,

339
00:19:30,056 --> 00:19:32,755
who took in four kids
who were strangers,

340
00:19:32,756 --> 00:19:34,897
should be the Minister of
Gender Equality and Family!

341
00:19:36,526 --> 00:19:38,565
Assemblyman Wi, who risked
his life in order to save a child...

342
00:19:38,566 --> 00:19:40,967
is indeed the true
politician of our time.

343
00:19:44,137 --> 00:19:47,006
Elect the National Dad, Wi Dae
Han, back to the National Assembly!

344
00:19:47,637 --> 00:19:48,776
"To the National Assembly".

345
00:19:49,536 --> 00:19:50,607
That's it!

346
00:19:51,036 --> 00:19:53,607
I knew it. It's
worth being a dad.

347
00:19:55,647 --> 00:19:57,146
Are you trying to be
the designated father,

348
00:19:57,147 --> 00:19:58,886
since being the designated driver
didn't get you enough attention?

349
00:19:58,887 --> 00:20:00,447
Is he crazy?

350
00:20:01,387 --> 00:20:02,556
Darn it...

351
00:20:03,657 --> 00:20:05,657
Is there any way I can
have these people arrested?

352
00:20:10,857 --> 00:20:11,996
Why are you still up?

353
00:20:12,697 --> 00:20:14,296
I was going to call my friend.

354
00:20:17,397 --> 00:20:19,306
You have a boyfriend, don't you?

355
00:20:20,407 --> 00:20:22,937
Don't be too late, since
you start school tomorrow.

356
00:20:27,506 --> 00:20:28,546
Mister.

357
00:20:29,677 --> 00:20:30,717
Yes?

358
00:20:31,586 --> 00:20:34,617
Thank you for saving Tae Poong.

359
00:20:39,256 --> 00:20:40,726
It was nothing.

360
00:20:42,597 --> 00:20:43,857
We made a contract.

361
00:20:46,867 --> 00:20:48,995
I don't know about
anything else,

362
00:20:48,996 --> 00:20:51,236
but I keep my promises
no matter what.

363
00:20:52,367 --> 00:20:53,536
That's why.

364
00:20:55,336 --> 00:20:56,407
I'm going in.

365
00:21:00,947 --> 00:21:02,016
Sure.

366
00:21:03,546 --> 00:21:04,786
It's a contract.

367
00:21:08,387 --> 00:21:09,556
Stop being so dramatic.

368
00:21:40,187 --> 00:21:41,586
Where did you put the urn?

369
00:21:43,586 --> 00:21:45,187
I placed it in the
closet in my room.

370
00:21:45,556 --> 00:21:48,276
I thought I shouldn't leave it there
since they even broke the tank.

371
00:21:49,397 --> 00:21:52,265
Wait. You don't look
so good, Da Jung.

372
00:21:52,266 --> 00:21:53,495
You even have a pimple.

373
00:21:53,496 --> 00:21:55,566
It's been crazy
these last few days.

374
00:21:55,697 --> 00:21:58,167
And my skin was
flawless my whole life.

375
00:22:01,336 --> 00:22:04,335
Soo Hyun. You said we
were ill-fated and jinxed...

376
00:22:04,336 --> 00:22:06,246
and that we should stay
away from each other.

377
00:22:06,607 --> 00:22:08,006
Why do you keep coming over?

378
00:22:09,917 --> 00:22:12,887
I'm here to see
the kids, not you.

379
00:22:15,316 --> 00:22:17,956
I don't like
cereal! I want rice!

380
00:22:17,957 --> 00:22:19,286
Give me rice!

381
00:22:20,657 --> 00:22:24,197
My stomach doesn't feel so
good because of the cereal.

382
00:22:25,296 --> 00:22:26,397
Are you okay?

383
00:22:27,996 --> 00:22:30,367
This is really good for you!

384
00:22:30,736 --> 00:22:33,035
Even astronauts
eat this in space.

385
00:22:33,036 --> 00:22:34,137
Did you know that?

386
00:22:35,236 --> 00:22:37,207
This is good for you.

387
00:22:37,707 --> 00:22:38,806
You liar.

388
00:22:44,147 --> 00:22:45,545
Constitution of the
House, Article 1, Section 2.

389
00:22:45,546 --> 00:22:47,846
We will act courteously to each
other. Have you forgotten already?

390
00:22:47,847 --> 00:22:49,016
Then report me.

391
00:22:55,796 --> 00:22:57,495
Da Jung helps with dinner,

392
00:22:57,496 --> 00:22:59,326
so why don't you make breakfast?

393
00:22:59,526 --> 00:23:01,266
Da Jung has to
get ready for school.

394
00:23:02,066 --> 00:23:04,736
That's true, but I'm also
going to be busy from now on.

395
00:23:05,207 --> 00:23:07,005
It's going to be crazy
once the show airs today.

396
00:23:07,006 --> 00:23:09,076
They're all going to
want me on their show.

397
00:23:10,877 --> 00:23:13,907
Wait, if you're going
to be on live radio,

398
00:23:14,246 --> 00:23:15,847
who will pick up Tae
Poong and Song Yi?

399
00:23:16,717 --> 00:23:18,285
That's why I did some research,

400
00:23:18,286 --> 00:23:21,315
and it turns out there are a
lot of child-care programs.

401
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:22,816
They can stay there.

402
00:23:24,086 --> 00:23:27,056
You don't have
any open spots left?

403
00:23:27,326 --> 00:23:29,957
No. They all filled up at the
beginning of the semester,

404
00:23:30,357 --> 00:23:32,796
and not everyone can
secure a spot, either.

405
00:23:36,967 --> 00:23:40,137
Ma'am, I'm scheduled for
an important show today.

406
00:23:40,467 --> 00:23:42,306
Can't you help me
out just for today?

407
00:23:45,177 --> 00:23:47,407
Then I'll let them stay
in the school library.

408
00:23:48,516 --> 00:23:50,546
I don't want to
stay in the library!

409
00:23:55,486 --> 00:23:58,427
Tae Poong, the library
is an amazing place.

410
00:23:58,627 --> 00:24:01,333
And you need to read a lot of
books if you want to be a great person.

411
00:24:01,357 --> 00:24:03,427
I don't want to
be a great person!

412
00:24:03,627 --> 00:24:05,927
I'm going to be a tyrannosaurus.

413
00:24:07,496 --> 00:24:08,566
What?

414
00:24:09,266 --> 00:24:10,336
You're going to be...

415
00:24:11,236 --> 00:24:12,367
You need to be human...

416
00:24:13,806 --> 00:24:16,976
Song Yi. You like
the library, don't you?

417
00:24:18,377 --> 00:24:20,947
What is it? Don't
you like it, either?

418
00:24:21,516 --> 00:24:23,516
That's not it.

419
00:24:24,046 --> 00:24:26,217
My stomach doesn't feel so good.

420
00:24:26,746 --> 00:24:29,387
I think it's because
of the cereal.

421
00:24:30,187 --> 00:24:31,187
Oh...

422
00:24:35,326 --> 00:24:36,397
Really?

423
00:24:36,957 --> 00:24:39,097
Then we'll have rice
starting tomorrow.

424
00:24:39,296 --> 00:24:41,167
I'll be back soon
after the show. Okay?

425
00:24:43,897 --> 00:24:44,967
Okay.

426
00:24:49,806 --> 00:24:51,877
(Han Da Jung)

427
00:24:54,647 --> 00:24:57,877
My name is Han Da Jung and I
lived in Chuncheon my whole life.

428
00:24:58,746 --> 00:25:01,046
I want to be a webtoon
artist in the future.

429
00:25:01,556 --> 00:25:03,617
I'm not good at studying,
but I can draw well.

430
00:25:04,786 --> 00:25:06,157
Let's have fun together.

431
00:25:13,097 --> 00:25:14,266
Stop that!

432
00:25:22,377 --> 00:25:23,476
A new phone?

433
00:25:24,137 --> 00:25:25,276
Are you rich?

434
00:25:25,707 --> 00:25:26,746
Give that back.

435
00:25:31,617 --> 00:25:33,985
We don't usually invite
guests in such short notice,

436
00:25:33,986 --> 00:25:36,985
but the other guest who was
scheduled for today canceled on us.

437
00:25:36,986 --> 00:25:40,325
I see. I don't know what
could have happened to them,

438
00:25:40,326 --> 00:25:43,026
but they shouldn't have
done that when it's a live show.

439
00:25:43,197 --> 00:25:44,256
I know.

440
00:25:44,597 --> 00:25:47,765
Anyway, I'll do my best today.

441
00:25:47,766 --> 00:25:49,637
- Thank you. Let's go.
- Sure.

442
00:25:51,637 --> 00:25:53,406
Let me read a story.

443
00:25:53,407 --> 00:25:55,536
Spring has come, for certain.

444
00:25:56,137 --> 00:25:58,475
Not only because of the
weather, but it's also because...

445
00:25:58,476 --> 00:26:01,647
there are many stories on the radio
about people going to see flowers.

446
00:26:02,016 --> 00:26:04,045
- I am running a small
store, - He's here.

447
00:26:04,046 --> 00:26:05,623
- So I cannot even dream...
- Turn down the volume.

448
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:06,786
Welcome.

449
00:26:07,546 --> 00:26:10,786
I thought you were
some kind of celebrity.

450
00:26:11,826 --> 00:26:15,856
You're so handsome that you
should've been on TV, not the radio.

451
00:26:15,857 --> 00:26:17,026
You flatter me.

452
00:26:18,056 --> 00:26:20,826
But I prefer the radio over TV.

453
00:26:21,766 --> 00:26:22,937
Why is that?

454
00:26:23,496 --> 00:26:26,667
You see, I have a sweet voice.

455
00:26:27,667 --> 00:26:28,707
"Sweet"?

456
00:26:31,377 --> 00:26:34,046
You even have a
great sense of humor!

457
00:26:34,377 --> 00:26:35,877
You're fit to be a guest.

458
00:26:36,316 --> 00:26:37,416
- Ms. Jang.
- Yes?

459
00:26:37,417 --> 00:26:39,647
What do you think about
having him as a regular?

460
00:26:39,917 --> 00:26:42,755
Sounds great. "The Parenting
Diaries of the National Dad".

461
00:26:42,756 --> 00:26:44,256
The name just pops up.

462
00:26:44,457 --> 00:26:47,226
Great. "National Dad"
has a nice ring to it.

463
00:26:48,056 --> 00:26:50,796
What a treasure to our show!

464
00:26:52,296 --> 00:26:53,367
Goodness...

465
00:26:53,427 --> 00:26:54,496
(Incoming call)

466
00:26:54,566 --> 00:26:57,666
Take it. You'll be in Part
three, so you have enough time.

467
00:26:57,667 --> 00:26:58,836
Thank you.

468
00:27:00,336 --> 00:27:01,336
Hello?

469
00:27:01,337 --> 00:27:03,775
This is Song Yi's teacher, sir.

470
00:27:03,776 --> 00:27:06,976
Yes, ma'am. Is there a problem?

471
00:27:07,506 --> 00:27:10,147
Song Yi...

472
00:27:10,947 --> 00:27:12,687
pooped in her pants.

473
00:27:13,117 --> 00:27:14,187
"Poop"?

474
00:27:18,056 --> 00:27:19,086
One moment.

475
00:27:20,056 --> 00:27:21,957
She's in the nurse's
office right now,

476
00:27:22,627 --> 00:27:24,526
but her classmates found out.

477
00:27:24,857 --> 00:27:27,426
She doesn't have any spare
clothes and she's crying.

478
00:27:27,427 --> 00:27:29,566
I think you should
come and pick her up.

479
00:27:29,897 --> 00:27:31,596
The phone is turned off.
Please leave a message...

480
00:27:31,597 --> 00:27:33,967
Why isn't she picking up?

481
00:27:35,276 --> 00:27:36,536
This is driving me crazy.

482
00:27:36,976 --> 00:27:40,607
Goodness!

483
00:27:41,207 --> 00:27:44,816
Gosh, it's so nice to come to
the sauna with my daughter.

484
00:27:48,857 --> 00:27:50,687
Why are they so impatient?

485
00:27:50,957 --> 00:27:52,637
My dead skin cells
are already coming off.

486
00:27:53,256 --> 00:27:54,887
There's going to
be so much later on.

487
00:27:55,357 --> 00:27:58,226
Mom, don't act like this in
public. It's embarrassing!

488
00:27:59,197 --> 00:28:01,666
Embarrassing, my foot!

489
00:28:01,667 --> 00:28:03,565
Don't you think other
people are here to scrub too?

490
00:28:03,566 --> 00:28:05,036
Stop overreacting, yourself.

491
00:28:05,207 --> 00:28:07,536
No one scrubs here.

492
00:28:08,066 --> 00:28:09,906
Of course, they
scrub at the sauna.

493
00:28:09,907 --> 00:28:11,676
You go ahead, mom.

494
00:28:11,677 --> 00:28:13,975
- You could get a tubful off.
- All right!

495
00:28:13,976 --> 00:28:16,147
Can't you take a
few minutes off?

496
00:28:16,316 --> 00:28:18,816
It's a very busy day.

497
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:20,716
I'm about to take a
dump in my pants...

498
00:28:20,717 --> 00:28:22,556
because I have no time
to go to the bathroom.

499
00:28:23,357 --> 00:28:26,687
Darn it. This is terrible. It's
not like I can flake on the show.

500
00:28:26,857 --> 00:28:28,286
Go afterward.

501
00:28:28,357 --> 00:28:30,757
Nothing changes if you go
sooner. She already pooped anyway.

502
00:28:30,796 --> 00:28:31,796
What?

503
00:28:32,226 --> 00:28:33,266
Get lost!

504
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:36,766
Darn it.

505
00:28:41,336 --> 00:28:42,576
Yes.

506
00:28:43,536 --> 00:28:45,752
I can't flake on a show because
of the poop she already took.

507
00:28:45,776 --> 00:28:48,177
I should raise them to
be tough. That's right.

508
00:28:53,647 --> 00:28:56,216
You didn't forget the contract
term that if you do not...

509
00:28:56,217 --> 00:28:59,826
perform your duties diligently,
I'll tell everyone the truth, right?

510
00:29:00,026 --> 00:29:02,256
I wish you luck today as always.

511
00:29:03,397 --> 00:29:05,566
What's this? Did she hear me?

512
00:29:08,097 --> 00:29:09,266
Assemblyman Wi.

513
00:29:09,996 --> 00:29:11,336
Part three will begin soon.

514
00:29:18,276 --> 00:29:19,776
- You can sit there.
- Okay.

515
00:29:20,076 --> 00:29:21,947
- It's nice to meet you.
- Same here.

516
00:29:22,217 --> 00:29:24,376
You can read this.

517
00:29:24,377 --> 00:29:27,216
Sure. This is the
format we'll be taking.

518
00:29:27,217 --> 00:29:29,186
- Make yourself comfortable.
- Okay.

519
00:29:29,187 --> 00:29:31,186
Okay. We'll begin now.

520
00:29:31,187 --> 00:29:33,586
Let's go, National Dad!

521
00:29:34,387 --> 00:29:37,197
Okay. Let's become a
permanent cast member!

522
00:29:40,026 --> 00:29:43,065
Assemblyman Wi had
an unavoidable situation,

523
00:29:43,066 --> 00:29:45,366
and couldn't join us
at the studio today.

524
00:29:45,367 --> 00:29:49,176
We will speak to
him over the phone.

525
00:29:49,177 --> 00:29:51,236
Hello, Assemblyman
Wi. Can you hear me?

526
00:29:51,947 --> 00:29:55,246
Yes, hello. I'm former
Assemblyman Wi Dae Han,

527
00:29:55,276 --> 00:29:56,917
a politician who
serves the people.

528
00:29:57,117 --> 00:29:59,446
You came all the way to
the studio but had to leave.

529
00:29:59,447 --> 00:30:01,117
Where are you headed?

530
00:30:01,486 --> 00:30:02,887
Well...

531
00:30:03,357 --> 00:30:05,226
I'm going to my
youngest child's school.

532
00:30:05,586 --> 00:30:09,196
The youngest? Do you
mean the eight-year-old twins?

533
00:30:09,197 --> 00:30:10,725
Yes, that's right.

534
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:13,397
What happened, that
you're going to the school?

535
00:30:13,496 --> 00:30:16,167
Well, my youngest...

536
00:30:16,467 --> 00:30:19,437
is having stomachaches
due to enteritis.

537
00:30:19,836 --> 00:30:22,137
She keeps asking for
me in the nurse's office,

538
00:30:22,806 --> 00:30:24,607
so it just broke my heart.

539
00:30:24,937 --> 00:30:27,877
Oh dear. You must feel terrible.

540
00:30:29,276 --> 00:30:30,347
Oh my gosh.

541
00:30:31,986 --> 00:30:32,986
Hello.

542
00:30:32,987 --> 00:30:34,916
Assemblyman Wi Dae Han, right?

543
00:30:34,917 --> 00:30:35,917
Yes.

544
00:30:36,187 --> 00:30:38,585
You're so handsome in person.

545
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:40,157
Thank you.

546
00:30:40,857 --> 00:30:42,296
But how's Song Yi?

547
00:30:42,657 --> 00:30:45,566
I'm Song Yi's guardian.

548
00:30:46,766 --> 00:30:47,897
She's over there.

549
00:30:49,697 --> 00:30:51,197
I see. Thank you.

550
00:31:03,347 --> 00:31:06,086
She was crying the whole
time and just fell asleep.

551
00:31:08,086 --> 00:31:10,256
Is her underwear still...

552
00:31:10,457 --> 00:31:13,085
No. Her teacher took
her to the bathroom,

553
00:31:13,086 --> 00:31:16,197
threw out her underwear,
and changed her.

554
00:31:28,536 --> 00:31:30,437
Her teacher is so nice.

555
00:31:30,637 --> 00:31:33,407
Song Yi kept crying and said...

556
00:31:33,707 --> 00:31:35,207
it was because of the cereal.

557
00:31:41,387 --> 00:31:44,417
Song Yi, aren't you
happy to go home early?

558
00:31:49,756 --> 00:31:52,396
That stupid cereal
is the problem.

559
00:31:52,397 --> 00:31:53,966
You did nothing wrong.

560
00:31:53,967 --> 00:31:56,265
I'll throw out all the cereals
as soon as we get home.

561
00:31:56,266 --> 00:31:58,296
Those bad cereals.

562
00:32:03,107 --> 00:32:05,206
Song Yi, it's okay.

563
00:32:05,207 --> 00:32:07,946
I peed in my pants when
I was in grade school too.

564
00:32:07,947 --> 00:32:09,075
Is that true?

565
00:32:09,076 --> 00:32:10,676
Of course, it's true.

566
00:32:10,677 --> 00:32:12,347
Song Yi pooped.

567
00:32:16,556 --> 00:32:19,956
Look. Pee, poop,
it's all the same thing.

568
00:32:19,957 --> 00:32:22,732
And your friends don't care at all
about things like that. Don't worry.

569
00:32:22,756 --> 00:32:26,667
That's not true. They teased
her like crazy that she pooped.

570
00:32:28,296 --> 00:32:29,536
Tae Poong.

571
00:32:32,836 --> 00:32:36,206
Don't they poop?
It's okay. It's okay.

572
00:32:36,207 --> 00:32:38,677
I'm not going to school anymore.

573
00:32:41,276 --> 00:32:43,847
What? Then what will you do?

574
00:32:44,177 --> 00:32:45,816
I want to stay home.

575
00:32:51,887 --> 00:32:55,627
No, you can't. I'm too busy
now, so I'm not home anymore.

576
00:32:56,397 --> 00:32:59,597
What if a burglar breaks
in while you're home alone?

577
00:33:00,496 --> 00:33:01,526
Isn't that scary?

578
00:33:02,137 --> 00:33:04,637
Mister. I'm hungry.

579
00:33:08,167 --> 00:33:10,707
How could you think about
food at a time like this?

580
00:33:10,976 --> 00:33:13,377
I'm hungry because
I skipped lunch.

581
00:33:13,576 --> 00:33:15,876
Buy me a hamburger. A hamburger.

582
00:33:15,877 --> 00:33:18,076
Please...

583
00:33:19,187 --> 00:33:20,417
Fine.

584
00:33:20,647 --> 00:33:24,887
Let's change Song Yi first,
and then go out for burgers.

585
00:33:25,726 --> 00:33:27,127
Okay. So...

586
00:33:27,726 --> 00:33:28,857
Just a minute.

587
00:33:32,296 --> 00:33:35,766
Hey. Where are you?
Why is your phone off?

588
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:39,166
What's it to you whether
or not my phone is off?

589
00:33:39,167 --> 00:33:42,106
How could I not care?
Song Yi pooped at school.

590
00:33:42,107 --> 00:33:44,076
That's only natural.
Good for her.

591
00:33:45,546 --> 00:33:48,076
In her pants. She
pooped in her pants.

592
00:33:49,076 --> 00:33:50,147
What?

593
00:33:54,086 --> 00:33:56,417
What's wrong? Aren't you hungry?

594
00:33:56,717 --> 00:33:57,786
No.

595
00:33:58,086 --> 00:34:01,357
Sure. It may be better not to
eat when your stomach hurts.

596
00:34:02,657 --> 00:34:05,197
Song Yi. You'll go to
school tomorrow, right?

597
00:34:05,397 --> 00:34:06,796
I won't go.

598
00:34:08,097 --> 00:34:09,137
Really?

599
00:34:12,437 --> 00:34:15,707
Do something. She says
she won't go to school again.

600
00:34:17,677 --> 00:34:19,407
I wouldn't want to go either.

601
00:34:20,776 --> 00:34:22,177
I'm dying here.

602
00:34:22,576 --> 00:34:24,376
I have to watch the kids, go
on air, cook, clean, do laundry,

603
00:34:24,377 --> 00:34:25,985
and I do designated
driving at night.

604
00:34:25,986 --> 00:34:28,346
But if she doesn't go to school,
what am I supposed to do?

605
00:34:28,347 --> 00:34:30,086
I'm not Superman.

606
00:34:30,117 --> 00:34:31,957
Superman, ho!

607
00:34:34,286 --> 00:34:35,556
Come here.

608
00:34:35,726 --> 00:34:37,996
Sit here and eat quietly.

609
00:34:38,197 --> 00:34:39,867
Eat your burger, okay?

610
00:34:42,496 --> 00:34:45,807
Song Yi. Is there anywhere
in Seoul you wanted to go to?

611
00:34:45,967 --> 00:34:47,065
Why?

612
00:34:47,066 --> 00:34:49,376
Let's go to cheer up...

613
00:34:49,477 --> 00:34:50,836
and get some fresh air.

614
00:34:51,206 --> 00:34:55,206
Yes, there is! Amusement parks.
Let's go to an amusement park!

615
00:34:55,916 --> 00:34:58,275
Song Yi, should we all
go to an amusement park?

616
00:34:58,276 --> 00:34:59,486
Okay.

617
00:34:59,586 --> 00:35:03,216
Gosh. Forget it. It'll be
packed. It's pure torture.

618
00:35:03,217 --> 00:35:05,887
And it's super expensive.

619
00:35:06,287 --> 00:35:08,456
It'll be my treat.

620
00:35:08,997 --> 00:35:10,755
National Dad? As if.

621
00:35:10,756 --> 00:35:12,597
You won't even
play with the kids.

622
00:35:17,867 --> 00:35:19,307
Come to think of it,

623
00:35:19,467 --> 00:35:22,506
a National Dad can take the
kids to an amusement park.

624
00:35:22,936 --> 00:35:26,376
That's right. You're
definitely paying, right?

625
00:36:13,674 --> 00:36:15,803
Song Yi, aren't you
happy we came here?

626
00:36:15,904 --> 00:36:16,972
Yes.

627
00:36:16,973 --> 00:36:19,544
Then you'll go to
school tomorrow, right?

628
00:36:20,814 --> 00:36:22,944
I'll think it over.

629
00:36:23,683 --> 00:36:26,053
What? You'll think it over?

630
00:36:26,654 --> 00:36:28,814
You're playing
hard to get already.

631
00:36:29,084 --> 00:36:31,423
You're going to be a pro
at dating when you grow up.

632
00:36:31,424 --> 00:36:33,194
What are you saying to a child?

633
00:36:33,254 --> 00:36:35,024
What a great thing to teach her.

634
00:36:35,093 --> 00:36:36,564
What? I should.

635
00:36:36,823 --> 00:36:37,823
Let's go.

636
00:36:38,223 --> 00:36:41,933
But you know, I think
you and Ms. Soo Hyun...

637
00:36:41,964 --> 00:36:44,703
are sexually compatible.

638
00:36:44,864 --> 00:36:45,873
What?

639
00:36:49,343 --> 00:36:51,444
Song Yi. Do you...

640
00:36:51,643 --> 00:36:54,413
even know what "sexually
compatible" means?

641
00:36:54,674 --> 00:36:58,044
I do. It means you
understand each other well.

642
00:36:58,343 --> 00:37:00,114
That's what Da Jung said.

643
00:37:01,854 --> 00:37:03,182
Song Yi.

644
00:37:03,183 --> 00:37:06,552
You see... Da Jung was mistaken.

645
00:37:06,553 --> 00:37:09,794
It's not a good thing, so don't
say that anywhere else, okay?

646
00:37:09,993 --> 00:37:11,423
- Okay.
- Good.

647
00:37:11,424 --> 00:37:12,892
But...

648
00:37:12,893 --> 00:37:16,763
it's true that you
two are dating, right?

649
00:37:19,933 --> 00:37:24,674
Song Yi. No, no. Look at
him. He's totally not my type.

650
00:37:26,044 --> 00:37:27,473
You're not my type either.

651
00:37:27,873 --> 00:37:29,084
No, no. Me neither.

652
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:31,214
- Thank goodness.
- Thank goodness.

653
00:37:31,513 --> 00:37:34,283
Mister. Carry me on
your shoulders too.

654
00:37:34,683 --> 00:37:38,453
Carry me on your
shoulder. Come on. Please.

655
00:37:39,953 --> 00:37:42,693
Hey, Tae Poong.
That's super dangerous.

656
00:37:42,694 --> 00:37:45,440
Haven't you seen kids getting hurt
from doing that? No, no. Let's go.

657
00:37:45,464 --> 00:37:46,864
It's not dangerous.

658
00:37:49,004 --> 00:37:51,803
I have very good balance.

659
00:37:52,033 --> 00:37:54,674
Carry me.

660
00:37:55,073 --> 00:37:58,044
Carry him. How hard is that?

661
00:37:58,573 --> 00:38:01,773
Sure. It's not dangerous, so
she'll carry it. You do it, lady.

662
00:38:01,774 --> 00:38:03,913
Lady? Carry him. Now.

663
00:38:05,013 --> 00:38:07,084
- I have a bad back.
- Now.

664
00:38:07,714 --> 00:38:09,283
- Tae Poong!
- That's dangerous.

665
00:38:09,424 --> 00:38:11,453
Get on his shoulders. Careful.

666
00:38:11,783 --> 00:38:13,154
Okay. 1, 2.

667
00:38:15,154 --> 00:38:16,194
How much do you weigh?

668
00:38:18,663 --> 00:38:21,993
Hold on. Hold on. Soo
Hyun, take our picture.

669
00:38:22,334 --> 00:38:24,503
What? Are you
here to take pictures?

670
00:38:24,504 --> 00:38:26,703
You're going to post this
on social media, right?

671
00:38:27,134 --> 00:38:29,573
These are all memories.

672
00:38:30,203 --> 00:38:32,243
Tae Poong, here. Ready?

673
00:38:32,413 --> 00:38:34,243
- Song Yi, come here.
- Okay.

674
00:38:34,444 --> 00:38:37,182
Okay. Ready?

675
00:38:37,183 --> 00:38:38,384
Here we go.

676
00:38:38,843 --> 00:38:41,584
- Song Yi, you too.
- 1, 2, 3.

677
00:38:42,754 --> 00:38:45,523
- Okay. A heart this time.
- V. More. A heart.

678
00:38:45,524 --> 00:38:46,654
1, 2, 3.

679
00:38:47,953 --> 00:38:50,092
- Nice.
- Let's take a video this time.

680
00:38:50,093 --> 00:38:51,223
- A video too?
- Okay.

681
00:38:51,524 --> 00:38:53,893
Excuse me, aren't
you Mr. Wi Dae Han?

682
00:38:54,033 --> 00:38:55,762
- Oh my gosh.
- It is him.

683
00:38:55,763 --> 00:38:57,262
It is you, right?

684
00:38:57,263 --> 00:38:59,533
- The National Dad.
- He's the National Dad.

685
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:02,073
Can I get a picture?

686
00:39:02,643 --> 00:39:05,104
Well... Sure, why not?

687
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:07,642
- Please take our picture for me.
- Sure.

688
00:39:07,643 --> 00:39:09,544
Okay. Excuse us.

689
00:39:11,114 --> 00:39:12,984
Okay, here we go.

690
00:39:13,654 --> 00:39:15,654
1, 2, 3.

691
00:39:16,323 --> 00:39:17,983
- One more.
- With mine too.

692
00:39:17,984 --> 00:39:20,053
Okay, 1, 2, 3.

693
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:21,992
One more?

694
00:39:21,993 --> 00:39:23,663
- Yes, one more.
- Okay.

695
00:39:23,823 --> 00:39:25,524
1, 2, 3.

696
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:29,833
- Thank you.
- Sure. Have a nice day.

697
00:39:29,834 --> 00:39:31,563
- Thank you.
- Good luck, National Dad.

698
00:39:31,564 --> 00:39:33,274
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

699
00:39:33,533 --> 00:39:34,803
Okay.

700
00:39:36,944 --> 00:39:38,743
Tae Poong, wasn't that fun?

701
00:39:39,643 --> 00:39:40,743
Let's go.

702
00:39:44,743 --> 00:39:46,314
- Dae Han.
- Yes?

703
00:39:46,453 --> 00:39:47,753
- Song Yi.
- What?

704
00:39:47,754 --> 00:39:48,913
I don't see Song Yi.

705
00:39:49,283 --> 00:39:50,823
Song Yi!

706
00:39:51,384 --> 00:39:53,294
Song Yi!

707
00:39:53,524 --> 00:39:55,393
- Song Yi!
- Song Yi!

708
00:39:56,364 --> 00:39:58,322
Song Yi!

709
00:39:58,323 --> 00:40:01,193
Soo Hyun, stay
here. I'll look for her.

710
00:40:01,194 --> 00:40:02,263
Okay.

711
00:40:02,864 --> 00:40:04,634
- Song Yi.
- Song Yi!

712
00:40:04,763 --> 00:40:05,904
Song Yi!

713
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:08,573
- Song Yi!
- Song Yi!

714
00:40:14,013 --> 00:40:15,044
Song Yi!

715
00:40:21,714 --> 00:40:22,823
Daddy.

716
00:40:26,024 --> 00:40:27,053
Just a minute.

717
00:40:28,424 --> 00:40:29,464
What is it?

718
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:44,803
Song Yi!

719
00:40:53,854 --> 00:40:54,884
Song Yi!

720
00:40:56,123 --> 00:40:57,123
Song Yi!

721
00:41:04,464 --> 00:41:05,493
Song Yi!

722
00:41:06,734 --> 00:41:08,194
Song Yi!

723
00:41:09,564 --> 00:41:11,734
Where did you go? I
looked all over for you.

724
00:41:18,544 --> 00:41:21,913
I went after him because
I thought it was Daddy,

725
00:41:22,274 --> 00:41:23,913
but it was someone else,

726
00:41:24,743 --> 00:41:27,013
and I couldn't see you.

727
00:41:27,484 --> 00:41:28,714
I'm sorry.

728
00:41:36,823 --> 00:41:39,694
I see. It's okay.

729
00:41:40,163 --> 00:41:42,134
I'm sorry...

730
00:41:42,504 --> 00:41:44,064
I got distracted.

731
00:41:44,564 --> 00:41:46,234
Hey. Song Yi.

732
00:41:47,674 --> 00:41:49,743
I'll add this to
the Constitution.

733
00:41:50,104 --> 00:41:52,444
Not getting distracted
at an amusement park.

734
00:41:52,674 --> 00:41:54,742
- Okay? I promise, okay?
- Okay.

735
00:41:54,743 --> 00:41:55,743
Good.

736
00:42:01,783 --> 00:42:04,123
My gosh. Sorry.

737
00:42:04,783 --> 00:42:05,854
I'm sorry.

738
00:42:12,834 --> 00:42:15,763
Song Yi. When else did
you poop other than today?

739
00:42:17,263 --> 00:42:19,303
I think it's been over a week.

740
00:42:21,334 --> 00:42:24,104
Kids can get constipated
if they're anxious.

741
00:42:24,604 --> 00:42:26,604
I think today's indigestion
was due to stress too.

742
00:42:28,073 --> 00:42:29,513
I was harsh.

743
00:42:30,484 --> 00:42:33,245
I don't think you should send her
to school until she becomes stable.

744
00:42:34,354 --> 00:42:35,484
Okay.

745
00:42:38,623 --> 00:42:40,122
You have to go to school.

746
00:42:40,123 --> 00:42:42,194
I don't want to go
to school neither!

747
00:42:42,593 --> 00:42:44,493
It's "either", not "neither".

748
00:42:44,924 --> 00:42:46,564
Either! Neither!

749
00:42:47,694 --> 00:42:50,964
I don't want it neither!
You have to go to school.

750
00:42:51,364 --> 00:42:53,203
- Let's go.
- Excuse me.

751
00:42:54,404 --> 00:42:55,473
Let's go.

752
00:42:57,143 --> 00:42:58,203
Hello, sir.

753
00:42:58,444 --> 00:43:02,984
Soo Hyun. I knew it. I knew
that jerk would cause trouble.

754
00:43:03,314 --> 00:43:04,913
What is it? What's wrong?

755
00:43:05,314 --> 00:43:06,453
What?

756
00:43:06,884 --> 00:43:10,323
Go online. It's a
big mess right now.

757
00:43:10,854 --> 00:43:11,924
What?

758
00:43:12,484 --> 00:43:14,953
(Assemblyman Hwang Yong
Chan's Me Too Allegation)

759
00:43:20,564 --> 00:43:21,794
They're passed out.

760
00:43:24,564 --> 00:43:28,134
Anyway, Yong Chan. How could
he do that in this day and age?

761
00:43:28,674 --> 00:43:31,003
What does sexual harassment
have to do with the times?

762
00:43:31,004 --> 00:43:32,573
It's a crime at any time.

763
00:43:34,274 --> 00:43:35,314
Right.

764
00:43:36,343 --> 00:43:39,714
I guess that means he'll
have to leave your show, right?

765
00:43:40,283 --> 00:43:42,123
Not just leave our show.
He should go to jail.

766
00:43:44,283 --> 00:43:47,322
It'll be hard to find a new panelist
especially since it's a live show.

767
00:43:47,323 --> 00:43:49,493
My point exactly.

768
00:43:49,964 --> 00:43:51,493
Is there anyone good?

769
00:43:52,364 --> 00:43:53,433
Right?

770
00:43:56,303 --> 00:43:57,364
Wi Dae Han.

771
00:43:59,263 --> 00:44:00,373
Wi Dae Han.

772
00:44:01,973 --> 00:44:03,044
You?

773
00:44:04,343 --> 00:44:06,314
What? Did you hear that?

774
00:44:08,373 --> 00:44:11,614
I'm really popular right now.
I have a good image now too.

775
00:44:15,183 --> 00:44:17,103
I'll think about it if I
can't find anyone else.

776
00:44:19,283 --> 00:44:20,323
Do you mean it?

777
00:44:30,364 --> 00:44:32,404
Thank you for all
your help today.

778
00:44:33,174 --> 00:44:35,404
I had fun thanks to you
guys. Get home safely.

779
00:44:36,473 --> 00:44:37,504
Bye.

780
00:44:39,004 --> 00:44:40,114
Get some rest.

781
00:44:40,573 --> 00:44:42,884
Mention me in your meeting.

782
00:44:43,484 --> 00:44:44,544
Okay?

783
00:44:47,384 --> 00:44:48,484
Is that so hard?

784
00:44:55,093 --> 00:44:56,763
Is becoming a
panelist a bit much?

785
00:44:58,564 --> 00:44:59,763
What do they say from above?

786
00:45:02,834 --> 00:45:04,004
What could they say?

787
00:45:04,504 --> 00:45:05,933
They say to find a new panelist.

788
00:45:08,104 --> 00:45:09,643
Do you have anyone in mind?

789
00:45:09,944 --> 00:45:10,973
No.

790
00:45:12,044 --> 00:45:13,243
I feel lost.

791
00:45:13,614 --> 00:45:16,883
Current events shows
are already struggling,

792
00:45:16,884 --> 00:45:18,843
but what is this garbage now?

793
00:45:19,114 --> 00:45:21,283
We should've cut
him a while ago.

794
00:45:21,953 --> 00:45:24,223
No, it's for the best, actually.

795
00:45:25,254 --> 00:45:27,793
Let's use this to
revamp the whole show.

796
00:45:27,794 --> 00:45:29,254
The panel, format,
and everything.

797
00:45:30,864 --> 00:45:32,593
You want to change it all?

798
00:45:34,993 --> 00:45:36,634
Do you have a format in mind?

799
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:40,274
Viewers are bored
of just discussions.

800
00:45:40,674 --> 00:45:42,273
What people want now...

801
00:45:42,274 --> 00:45:44,472
isn't to watch people
debate over little things,

802
00:45:44,473 --> 00:45:47,174
but is to participate in a way
to bring about real change.

803
00:45:47,544 --> 00:45:48,544
That's right.

804
00:45:48,913 --> 00:45:51,353
The Blue House Civil Petitions
are a bit hit for that reason.

805
00:45:52,084 --> 00:45:55,314
That sounds good. An
interactive program sounds good.

806
00:45:55,783 --> 00:45:56,854
Really?

807
00:45:57,453 --> 00:45:58,623
Nice format.

808
00:46:00,854 --> 00:46:02,093
Whose idea was this?

809
00:46:02,294 --> 00:46:03,464
Well...

810
00:46:04,123 --> 00:46:07,134
Who else would think of
something like this but me?

811
00:46:08,033 --> 00:46:09,703
So you can use
your brain after all.

812
00:46:11,134 --> 00:46:12,263
What about the panel?

813
00:46:12,663 --> 00:46:14,904
Mr. Kang is popular,

814
00:46:15,134 --> 00:46:16,774
so we'll keep him on
as the conservative.

815
00:46:16,803 --> 00:46:18,163
As for the
progressive panelist...

816
00:46:18,973 --> 00:46:20,174
Let's go with Wi Dae Han.

817
00:46:20,544 --> 00:46:23,384
Wi Dae Han won't work.
He's the Reprobate Son.

818
00:46:23,683 --> 00:46:26,913
What do you mean? He transformed
himself into the National Dad.

819
00:46:27,254 --> 00:46:28,913
We know he's a good speaker.

820
00:46:29,114 --> 00:46:31,354
And he's not bad looking.

821
00:46:33,524 --> 00:46:36,093
Wi Dae Han as the
progressive panelist.

822
00:46:39,464 --> 00:46:40,734
It'll draw attention for sure.

823
00:46:41,564 --> 00:46:43,364
Wi Dae Han as a
panelist for the Debate.

824
00:46:44,634 --> 00:46:47,234
- Has it been decided?
- I put it on hold for now.

825
00:46:48,674 --> 00:46:50,904
I don't think the
party would like it.

826
00:46:52,573 --> 00:46:53,843
But it would be interesting,

827
00:46:54,373 --> 00:46:56,243
having Kang Joon Ho
and Wi Dae Han face off.

828
00:47:01,214 --> 00:47:04,223
How old are the kids?

829
00:47:04,754 --> 00:47:05,854
Well,

830
00:47:06,294 --> 00:47:09,493
the eldest is a high school
junior, the 2nd is in the 9th grade,

831
00:47:09,794 --> 00:47:11,763
and the fraternal
twins are eight.

832
00:47:13,393 --> 00:47:15,064
That's quite a variety.

833
00:47:15,893 --> 00:47:19,263
I'm struggling so
much with just one son.

834
00:47:19,404 --> 00:47:20,573
Aren't you exhausted?

835
00:47:21,933 --> 00:47:24,843
I can't be exhausted already.

836
00:47:25,243 --> 00:47:27,743
Rather than that, I feel proud.

837
00:47:27,973 --> 00:47:29,342
And our house
feels much cozier...

838
00:47:29,343 --> 00:47:31,683
now that it's full of kids.

839
00:47:32,544 --> 00:47:34,814
And when I see the twins asleep,

840
00:47:35,154 --> 00:47:36,823
I somehow get a
bit emotional too.

841
00:47:50,504 --> 00:47:52,203
What's this?

842
00:47:52,604 --> 00:47:54,032
It's a nosebleed. Excuse me...

843
00:47:54,033 --> 00:47:56,702
- A nosebleed? Don't touch that!
- All right, I'm sorry.

844
00:47:56,703 --> 00:47:58,403
- Gosh...
- On, my nose.

845
00:47:58,404 --> 00:48:00,842
How could you
bleed all over my car?

846
00:48:00,843 --> 00:48:02,613
- I'm sorry, sir.
- It hasn't even been...

847
00:48:02,614 --> 00:48:04,242
a month since I bought it!

848
00:48:04,243 --> 00:48:05,683
- Darn it...
- I'm sorry, sir.

849
00:48:05,944 --> 00:48:08,013
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Gosh...

850
00:48:08,154 --> 00:48:10,524
Darn it!

851
00:48:11,024 --> 00:48:12,654
But this says...

852
00:48:12,683 --> 00:48:14,493
you ran 70,000km.
That's not new.

853
00:48:16,424 --> 00:48:17,993
Maybe it's not this car.

854
00:48:18,323 --> 00:48:21,432
This is my most valuable car...

855
00:48:21,433 --> 00:48:22,904
I'm sorry, sir.

856
00:48:24,663 --> 00:48:25,663
Goodness.

857
00:48:29,404 --> 00:48:31,873
Forget it.

858
00:48:32,573 --> 00:48:35,243
I'm going to get it
washed anyway.

859
00:48:37,343 --> 00:48:38,683
I'm so sorry, sir.

860
00:48:41,714 --> 00:48:43,254
I won't make you
pay for the ride.

861
00:48:46,823 --> 00:48:48,154
At least you're not shameless.

862
00:48:51,223 --> 00:48:52,424
Have a good night, sir.

863
00:49:07,343 --> 00:49:08,774
(Jung Han Soo)

864
00:49:13,553 --> 00:49:14,714
Yes, sir!

865
00:49:16,354 --> 00:49:17,453
Thank you.

866
00:49:29,433 --> 00:49:31,404
How does it feel to be a father?

867
00:49:32,033 --> 00:49:34,404
It's killing me.

868
00:49:35,234 --> 00:49:37,004
Now that I've experienced it,

869
00:49:37,303 --> 00:49:40,473
I can say that every parent
in this country is a patriot.

870
00:49:40,674 --> 00:49:42,073
They should be awarded.

871
00:49:42,413 --> 00:49:45,013
It costs more than I expected,

872
00:49:45,114 --> 00:49:46,654
and the conditions are poor.

873
00:49:46,783 --> 00:49:49,354
Where does all the
tax money go to?

874
00:49:49,453 --> 00:49:52,553
It's all because of us
scummy politicians.

875
00:49:55,654 --> 00:49:57,374
It's six months until
the general election.

876
00:49:57,623 --> 00:49:58,943
You're getting
ready, aren't you?

877
00:50:00,334 --> 00:50:02,364
I got rid of that nickname,

878
00:50:03,433 --> 00:50:04,904
but I still have
a long way to go.

879
00:50:05,033 --> 00:50:07,009
So you're just going to
take your time on the way?

880
00:50:07,033 --> 00:50:09,633
You need to grab an
express bus or train...

881
00:50:09,634 --> 00:50:10,873
to get through.

882
00:50:11,774 --> 00:50:12,843
Well...

883
00:50:13,714 --> 00:50:15,073
I know I should,

884
00:50:15,873 --> 00:50:18,743
but I don't have any money
nor ties, so I can't get the tickets.

885
00:50:21,413 --> 00:50:22,854
You're going to
be the new panel...

886
00:50:23,424 --> 00:50:24,453
for Debate.

887
00:50:26,493 --> 00:50:27,993
How do you know that?

888
00:50:28,024 --> 00:50:30,123
Is that important?

889
00:50:30,294 --> 00:50:32,593
How well you do it
is what's important.

890
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:39,033
By the way, was his
name Kang Joon Ho?

891
00:50:39,334 --> 00:50:40,703
Kang Kyung Hoon's son?

892
00:50:40,734 --> 00:50:42,303
Yes. What about Joon Ho?

893
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:46,104
There are rumors that he's
running in the general elections.

894
00:50:46,774 --> 00:50:48,714
I heard about that.

895
00:50:50,114 --> 00:50:52,343
Kang Kyung Hoon is denying it,

896
00:50:52,743 --> 00:50:55,584
but that sly fox would
never show his cards.

897
00:50:56,114 --> 00:50:57,723
I'm sure he's trying to...

898
00:50:57,823 --> 00:51:00,154
pass on his place to his son.

899
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:01,323
My gosh.

900
00:51:02,024 --> 00:51:03,693
Does he think this
is the feudal age?

901
00:51:03,694 --> 00:51:05,393
I won't just watch him do that.

902
00:51:05,663 --> 00:51:07,464
Whether it's Kang Kyung
Hoon or Kang Joon Ho,

903
00:51:07,864 --> 00:51:10,263
I'm going to beat him for sure.

904
00:51:10,604 --> 00:51:12,663
If you want to do that,
you better think straight.

905
00:51:13,033 --> 00:51:15,933
If you go against Joon
Ho as a panel in the show,

906
00:51:16,743 --> 00:51:20,174
you're basically beginning your
campaign for the general elections.

907
00:51:21,843 --> 00:51:23,314
If you fall behind there,

908
00:51:23,884 --> 00:51:25,343
there's no point
in even running.

909
00:51:38,493 --> 00:51:40,294
Keep a watch out
for those kids too.

910
00:51:40,734 --> 00:51:43,203
It's extremely hard to
improve your image,

911
00:51:43,504 --> 00:51:45,064
but it only takes a
moment to go down.

912
00:51:46,134 --> 00:51:48,573
"It only takes a
moment to go down."

913
00:51:58,743 --> 00:51:59,743
Who's there?

914
00:52:03,823 --> 00:52:05,254
Why are you so startled?

915
00:52:05,323 --> 00:52:08,093
Of course I am. You
popped out like a ghost!

916
00:52:12,123 --> 00:52:13,794
What are you going
to do about tomorrow?

917
00:52:14,694 --> 00:52:15,734
What about tomorrow?

918
00:52:16,334 --> 00:52:18,734
Where will you take the kids
if they're not going to school?

919
00:52:20,504 --> 00:52:21,533
Oh, well...

920
00:52:22,334 --> 00:52:24,643
I thought they'd
get bored at home,

921
00:52:25,104 --> 00:52:26,743
so I'm taking
them on a field trip.

922
00:52:27,944 --> 00:52:29,114
To where?

923
00:52:30,783 --> 00:52:32,544
There's a good place.

924
00:52:33,314 --> 00:52:35,513
Go and get to bed. You
have school tomorrow.

925
00:52:39,623 --> 00:52:40,953
Go and see your room.

926
00:53:03,614 --> 00:53:07,384
Mister, I'm sorry I
pooped at school.

927
00:53:07,714 --> 00:53:09,714
I'll try harder to
hold it in next time.

928
00:53:11,183 --> 00:53:13,693
Thank you for taking us
to the amusement park...

929
00:53:13,694 --> 00:53:17,223
and working until
late to earn money.

930
00:53:18,593 --> 00:53:21,592
I'll be sure to return the
favor when I grow up.

931
00:53:21,593 --> 00:53:23,163
Sincerely, Song Yi.

932
00:53:31,001 --> 00:53:32,600
Hello.

933
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:34,170
- Hello.
- How cute.

934
00:53:34,171 --> 00:53:35,341
Say hello.

935
00:53:35,711 --> 00:53:37,310
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

936
00:53:37,810 --> 00:53:39,740
- It's the kids!
- Hello.

937
00:53:40,381 --> 00:53:41,880
- Do you want some pocket money?
- It's all right, ma'am.

938
00:53:41,881 --> 00:53:43,719
- It's all right.
- Please... Gosh.

939
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,820
- Here.
- Say thank you.

940
00:53:45,821 --> 00:53:48,290
- You've grown so much.
- Thank you, ma'am.

941
00:53:48,291 --> 00:53:50,590
- Hello. Long time no see.
- Hello.

942
00:53:50,591 --> 00:53:51,890
Sure.

943
00:53:53,390 --> 00:53:54,790
I'm tired!

944
00:53:54,791 --> 00:53:56,361
- What?
- Me too.

945
00:53:57,231 --> 00:53:59,699
Really? Then should we stop
walking around the market...

946
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:02,430
and go to the nursing home
to play with the elderlies?

947
00:54:02,631 --> 00:54:04,870
I want to go to school tomorrow.

948
00:54:05,041 --> 00:54:06,071
Me too.

949
00:54:07,071 --> 00:54:09,239
But I was going to take you to
the National Assembly tomorrow.

950
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:10,680
I don't want to!

951
00:54:11,381 --> 00:54:12,381
No?

952
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:14,111
But you have to.

953
00:54:15,780 --> 00:54:16,780
One moment.

954
00:54:19,251 --> 00:54:22,349
Congratulations. You're the
new panel for the progressives.

955
00:54:22,350 --> 00:54:23,921
Yes!

956
00:54:24,291 --> 00:54:26,159
I got it! I got it, Song
Yi and Tae Poong!

957
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:27,529
- We got it!
- We got it!

958
00:54:27,530 --> 00:54:29,861
I got it!

959
00:54:30,530 --> 00:54:31,901
(Hye Jin)

960
00:54:32,260 --> 00:54:33,930
What's this? Wait.

961
00:54:38,501 --> 00:54:40,571
Hello? What is it?

962
00:54:40,970 --> 00:54:43,611
I heard you're a panel for
Debate. Congratulations.

963
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:47,950
I didn't expect you to
be congratulating me.

964
00:54:48,481 --> 00:54:50,821
What do you mean? Of
course I should congratulate you.

965
00:54:51,051 --> 00:54:54,220
It's not like we broke
up on bad terms.

966
00:54:54,591 --> 00:54:56,791
Thanks for the congratulations,

967
00:54:57,191 --> 00:54:59,220
but I don't think you
called me for just that.

968
00:55:01,461 --> 00:55:03,631
You heard I got kicked
out of the news, right?

969
00:55:04,861 --> 00:55:05,930
Sort of.

970
00:55:07,030 --> 00:55:09,131
I'm going to be
the host for Debate.

971
00:55:09,631 --> 00:55:11,771
We don't know each other, okay?

972
00:55:13,771 --> 00:55:16,640
Why? You said we didn't
break up on bad terms.

973
00:55:16,810 --> 00:55:20,051
Still, it won't do us any
good by admitting it.

974
00:55:20,481 --> 00:55:23,551
And I like Joon Ho.

975
00:55:29,890 --> 00:55:33,489
Okay. Nothing happened between
us and we don't know each other,

976
00:55:33,490 --> 00:55:34,990
so do your job properly.

977
00:55:35,231 --> 00:55:36,760
Don't side with Kang Joon Ho.

978
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:42,530
I'm the new progressive
panel for Debate, Wi Dae Han.

979
00:55:42,801 --> 00:55:44,841
- Nice to meet you.
- Give him a round of applause!

980
00:55:49,571 --> 00:55:52,211
I lack a lot as a person,

981
00:55:52,481 --> 00:55:55,551
but the only things I'm
confident about are my looks...

982
00:55:55,651 --> 00:55:56,950
and my talk.

983
00:55:58,350 --> 00:56:01,691
I will put in my everything
for the success...

984
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:03,860
of the newly transformed Debate.

985
00:56:03,861 --> 00:56:05,091
Bravo!

986
00:56:07,861 --> 00:56:10,159
You've seen the proposal
for the renewal, right?

987
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:13,530
Of course. I even used
a highlighter to study it.

988
00:56:15,301 --> 00:56:16,401
I see something new.

989
00:56:16,771 --> 00:56:17,970
Public assembly.

990
00:56:18,341 --> 00:56:21,240
Yes. We're letting the
viewers participate this time.

991
00:56:21,571 --> 00:56:23,880
Each week, the panelists
will propose a new law...

992
00:56:23,881 --> 00:56:25,341
and debate about it.

993
00:56:25,441 --> 00:56:28,580
The audience and viewers
will vote live for or against.

994
00:56:28,611 --> 00:56:31,880
If a law receives 80
percent of more votes,

995
00:56:31,881 --> 00:56:34,551
it will be proposed to
the National Assembly.

996
00:56:36,620 --> 00:56:37,620
So,

997
00:56:38,060 --> 00:56:40,490
for the first law to discuss
in the public assembly,

998
00:56:40,731 --> 00:56:43,231
how about the revision
of the anti-abortion law?

999
00:56:43,861 --> 00:56:44,930
What?

1000
00:56:45,530 --> 00:56:46,930
Abortion?

1001
00:56:47,430 --> 00:56:48,470
Yes.

1002
00:56:54,941 --> 00:56:57,481
That's a bit much
for the first episode.

1003
00:56:59,010 --> 00:57:00,810
It'll draw a lot of attention...

1004
00:57:01,111 --> 00:57:02,551
since it was found
unconstitutional.

1005
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:05,381
I think it'll be good.

1006
00:57:05,981 --> 00:57:07,651
I see. But...

1007
00:57:08,691 --> 00:57:09,751
Are you sure?

1008
00:57:10,361 --> 00:57:11,421
What?

1009
00:57:11,461 --> 00:57:14,989
Well, the issues politicians
try to avoid most...

1010
00:57:14,990 --> 00:57:17,001
are same-sex
rights and abortion.

1011
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:19,429
If you're lenient with abortion,

1012
00:57:19,430 --> 00:57:20,801
religious groups get upset.

1013
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:24,700
But if you're strict, women
will oppose strongly.

1014
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:27,460
Even if it's a difficult issue,
you must say what you must.

1015
00:57:27,571 --> 00:57:29,470
With conviction. Right?

1016
00:57:33,810 --> 00:57:34,850
Well...

1017
00:57:36,381 --> 00:57:38,450
Da Jung's mom was a single mom.

1018
00:57:39,421 --> 00:57:41,219
You took her and
her siblings in.

1019
00:57:41,220 --> 00:57:42,820
That's why you're
called "National Dad".

1020
00:57:44,321 --> 00:57:47,361
It's too risky to discuss
abortion on your first show.

1021
00:57:48,361 --> 00:57:50,529
Exactly. High risk...

1022
00:57:50,530 --> 00:57:53,361
means it'll draw the
attention of the viewers, right?

1023
00:57:55,970 --> 00:57:57,001
Right?

1024
00:57:58,771 --> 00:57:59,841
Right?

1025
00:58:02,910 --> 00:58:04,680
That's true.

1026
00:58:05,410 --> 00:58:06,441
Right.

1027
00:58:08,751 --> 00:58:12,680
(Wi Dae Han To Join Panel
on cvN Debate Program)

1028
00:58:13,180 --> 00:58:15,421
- I'm on a diet.
- What are you saying?

1029
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:18,390
- You know nothing about diet.
- It's delicious.

1030
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:20,191
Eat up.

1031
00:58:22,530 --> 00:58:23,560
You know what?

1032
00:58:28,071 --> 00:58:30,271
What was that? What's wrong
with her? Did you see that?

1033
00:58:32,801 --> 00:58:34,640
- What's wrong with her?
- Is she sick?

1034
00:58:35,310 --> 00:58:36,341
What's wrong?

1035
00:58:40,450 --> 00:58:41,910
Fate keeps bringing us together.

1036
00:58:43,051 --> 00:58:44,620
More like unfortunate
circumstances.

1037
00:58:45,821 --> 00:58:49,220
I told you before, didn't
I? Control your rage.

1038
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:52,220
Please don't
cause trouble on air.

1039
00:58:55,731 --> 00:58:57,260
Don't worry about that,

1040
00:58:59,260 --> 00:59:00,671
but I can't control my rage.

1041
00:59:02,571 --> 00:59:04,091
It's right to be
enraged at injustice.

1042
00:59:04,901 --> 00:59:05,901
Right?

1043
00:59:16,950 --> 00:59:19,521
Why are you touching
the anti-abortion law?

1044
00:59:19,850 --> 00:59:21,290
It was found unconstitutional,

1045
00:59:21,291 --> 00:59:22,791
but it's a highly
sensitive issue.

1046
00:59:22,950 --> 00:59:24,961
One mistake, and
it'll kill your career.

1047
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:27,961
Sensitive issues
bring you the spotlight.

1048
00:59:28,660 --> 00:59:31,801
Just see whether my career
shoots up or pummels to the ground.

1049
00:59:46,810 --> 00:59:48,051
I'll buy today.

1050
00:59:48,751 --> 00:59:49,850
You can buy next time.

1051
00:59:52,180 --> 00:59:54,050
No, I should buy.

1052
00:59:54,051 --> 00:59:55,521
That's why we met up today.

1053
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:58,260
Actually,

1054
00:59:59,890 --> 01:00:02,461
I'm here to ask you
for a special favor.

1055
01:00:14,810 --> 01:00:16,611
Stop stalling and tell me.

1056
01:00:17,510 --> 01:00:19,881
What is that special
favor that you want?

1057
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:26,680
It isn't much.

1058
01:00:28,321 --> 01:00:29,421
You said before,

1059
01:00:30,021 --> 01:00:33,060
that someone like me is too
perfect and uncomfortable.

1060
01:00:35,591 --> 01:00:37,060
Yes, I did.

1061
01:00:38,861 --> 01:00:43,100
When you get to know me,
you'll see I'm far from perfect.

1062
01:00:43,901 --> 01:00:45,341
I have many weaknesses.

1063
01:00:45,740 --> 01:00:47,611
If you look closely here,

1064
01:00:48,571 --> 01:00:51,080
I have a bald spot, so I've
been getting shots for it.

1065
01:00:53,810 --> 01:00:54,850
Sorry.

1066
01:00:58,551 --> 01:00:59,911
Do I still make
you uncomfortable?

1067
01:01:00,151 --> 01:01:02,850
Well, you do seem a little
easier to be around now.

1068
01:01:03,191 --> 01:01:05,961
That's right. I'm very easy.

1069
01:01:06,961 --> 01:01:08,191
So let's date.

1070
01:01:08,530 --> 01:01:10,060
Yes, sure. Why not?

1071
01:01:12,060 --> 01:01:13,361
What? What was that?

1072
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:15,801
Let's date.

1073
01:01:16,571 --> 01:01:17,640
Why?

1074
01:01:19,901 --> 01:01:22,640
I say let's date, and you
ask why. I'm a bit flustered.

1075
01:01:23,711 --> 01:01:26,711
You can't be more
flustered than I am.

1076
01:01:28,780 --> 01:01:31,981
It was out of the blue,
wasn't it? I'm old like that.

1077
01:01:32,651 --> 01:01:35,591
I'm not good at having
flings and playing hard-to-get.

1078
01:01:36,821 --> 01:01:40,260
Well... So... I'm the same way,

1079
01:01:41,390 --> 01:01:42,490
but why me?

1080
01:01:43,631 --> 01:01:44,801
What do you like about me?

1081
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:47,970
Do you remember...

1082
01:01:48,870 --> 01:01:52,301
when we met by chance at
the National Assembly Library?

1083
01:02:07,490 --> 01:02:09,050
- Do you come here often?
- Oh my gosh.

1084
01:02:10,821 --> 01:02:11,990
Hello, sir.

1085
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:14,429
Not often.

1086
01:02:14,430 --> 01:02:16,390
I come at times when
I need something.

1087
01:02:21,271 --> 01:02:22,900
- Excuse me.
- Wake up!

1088
01:02:22,901 --> 01:02:25,071
- Wake up!
- What's wrong?

1089
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:26,841
Call an ambulance!

1090
01:02:27,271 --> 01:02:28,369
Oh no.

1091
01:02:28,370 --> 01:02:30,171
Oh my gosh.

1092
01:02:35,481 --> 01:02:36,680
Call an ambulance.

1093
01:02:37,421 --> 01:02:39,620
What happened?

1094
01:02:40,521 --> 01:02:42,750
- Call. Hurry.
- 3, 4, 5, 6.

1095
01:02:42,751 --> 01:02:43,831
- Did you call 911?
- 7, 8.

1096
01:02:43,921 --> 01:02:46,660
Hello? We're at the National
Assembly Library. A man fainted.

1097
01:02:48,091 --> 01:02:49,759
- Do you have a defibrillator?
- Yes.

1098
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:50,901
Get it for me.

1099
01:02:54,700 --> 01:02:57,970
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

1100
01:03:00,171 --> 01:03:01,470
That's when I had this thought.

1101
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:05,739
If I date you,

1102
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:08,151
I'd be safe even if my heart
stopped because of you.

1103
01:03:14,051 --> 01:03:15,251
After seeing his heart...

1104
01:03:16,151 --> 01:03:17,791
beat again because of you,

1105
01:03:20,530 --> 01:03:21,730
it made my heart beat as well.

1106
01:03:27,930 --> 01:03:29,929
It's my first appearance
as the National Dad.

1107
01:03:29,930 --> 01:03:32,901
The production director insists
my daughter should be there.

1108
01:03:33,571 --> 01:03:35,810
He was so annoying.

1109
01:03:40,611 --> 01:03:42,650
You'll only be in the audience,

1110
01:03:42,651 --> 01:03:45,450
so you don't have
to feel any pressure.

1111
01:03:46,021 --> 01:03:49,151
Regardless, I have to be in
front of a camera. Live, at that.

1112
01:03:50,921 --> 01:03:53,490
Well... That's right.

1113
01:03:56,390 --> 01:03:58,231
You don't have to come.

1114
01:03:59,901 --> 01:04:01,131
You don't have to,

1115
01:04:03,071 --> 01:04:04,071
but...

1116
01:04:05,100 --> 01:04:10,370
I feel like there was a term
in our contract or something.

1117
01:04:10,881 --> 01:04:12,441
That if necessary,

1118
01:04:12,881 --> 01:04:15,809
Han Da Jung may go
on TV for Wi Dae Han,

1119
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:18,251
or something like that, I think.

1120
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:20,620
Fine. Okay.

1121
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:22,850
I'll go on TV for you...

1122
01:04:23,151 --> 01:04:24,521
since you saved Tae Poong.

1123
01:04:25,791 --> 01:04:26,821
Really?

1124
01:04:27,231 --> 01:04:29,091
Thank you so much.

1125
01:04:29,731 --> 01:04:32,900
This isn't just for me.

1126
01:04:32,901 --> 01:04:34,099
If I do well,

1127
01:04:34,100 --> 01:04:37,071
I'll be able to be a
better dad. Right?

1128
01:04:38,140 --> 01:04:39,841
Right? Hey.

1129
01:04:41,171 --> 01:04:42,211
Hello?

1130
01:04:43,671 --> 01:04:45,080
What an awesome manner.

1131
01:04:45,611 --> 01:04:46,780
What?

1132
01:04:50,580 --> 01:04:52,120
I could've opened it myself.

1133
01:04:58,720 --> 01:04:59,760
To be honest,

1134
01:05:00,591 --> 01:05:02,591
I'm not sure how I feel yet.

1135
01:05:04,030 --> 01:05:06,961
I'm happy, but I'm also
flustered at the same time.

1136
01:05:08,030 --> 01:05:09,100
And...

1137
01:05:09,700 --> 01:05:11,740
it's awkward since
we work together.

1138
01:05:14,941 --> 01:05:16,041
I'm glad.

1139
01:05:18,140 --> 01:05:19,211
About what?

1140
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:23,381
None of those feelings
is a dislike toward me.

1141
01:05:27,791 --> 01:05:29,489
Do you take lessons?

1142
01:05:29,490 --> 01:05:30,990
Where do you learn those lines?

1143
01:05:36,091 --> 01:05:37,191
What is this?

1144
01:05:37,260 --> 01:05:39,740
It's the loyalty card from the
cafe where I met you last time.

1145
01:05:40,901 --> 01:05:44,171
Let's meet until I collect
all the stamps on this.

1146
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:46,370
So there's no pressure.

1147
01:06:12,131 --> 01:06:13,501
I'm against this relationship.

1148
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:16,200
Why?

1149
01:06:16,401 --> 01:06:18,771
I told you. I like Dae Han.

1150
01:06:18,941 --> 01:06:21,140
Why are you bringing him up now.

1151
01:06:21,341 --> 01:06:24,310
Do you really not like Dae
Han at all? Not in the slightest?

1152
01:06:29,111 --> 01:06:30,780
No. Not at all.

1153
01:06:35,390 --> 01:06:36,521
Seriously.

1154
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:39,560
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

1155
01:06:40,930 --> 01:06:42,260
It's okay.

1156
01:06:53,001 --> 01:06:54,011
What was that?

1157
01:06:54,641 --> 01:06:56,011
I'm sorry.

1158
01:06:56,270 --> 01:06:57,541
What's your problem?

1159
01:06:58,311 --> 01:07:01,381
The car suddenly
cut in front. Why that...

1160
01:07:01,811 --> 01:07:04,051
Hey, you! Drive properly!

1161
01:07:04,580 --> 01:07:05,820
I'm sorry.

1162
01:07:06,381 --> 01:07:08,119
We were almost in an accident.

1163
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:09,450
- Please continue.
- What...

1164
01:07:10,891 --> 01:07:12,359
I'm speechless.

1165
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:14,360
- Hey.
- Forget it.

1166
01:07:14,791 --> 01:07:16,730
I'm so offended.

1167
01:07:20,700 --> 01:07:21,900
Here you go.

1168
01:07:22,001 --> 01:07:23,400
Are you ready?

1169
01:07:23,700 --> 01:07:24,900
Let's start.

1170
01:07:25,671 --> 01:07:28,841
Okay, we'll begin
shooting in 60 seconds.

1171
01:07:30,910 --> 01:07:32,041
Places everyone.

1172
01:07:34,450 --> 01:07:36,080
Good luck today.

1173
01:07:39,020 --> 01:07:40,051
Good luck.

1174
01:07:41,020 --> 01:07:42,690
Thanks. Good luck.

1175
01:07:46,061 --> 01:07:48,891
3, 2, 1.

1176
01:07:50,291 --> 01:07:54,330
A conservative and a
progressive panelist will fight...

1177
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:58,471
and debate hot topics
sweeping the nation.

1178
01:07:58,570 --> 01:07:59,769
This is "Debate".

1179
01:07:59,770 --> 01:08:01,910
(Debate)

1180
01:08:05,811 --> 01:08:08,751
Next up is something
that's brand new.

1181
01:08:09,681 --> 01:08:11,180
(Public Assembly)

1182
01:08:11,181 --> 01:08:12,780
"Public Assembly."

1183
01:08:16,020 --> 01:08:19,790
I believe Mr. Kang has
prepared the proposed law today.

1184
01:08:19,791 --> 01:08:21,160
What is it?

1185
01:08:21,461 --> 01:08:23,060
As many people know,

1186
01:08:23,061 --> 01:08:25,030
the law outlawing abortion...

1187
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:27,030
was found unconstitutional.

1188
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:30,729
Thus, the National Assembly
must revise the existing law...

1189
01:08:30,730 --> 01:08:32,569
by December 31, 2020.

1190
01:08:32,570 --> 01:08:36,870
Thus, we'd like to discuss how
to revise the anti-abortion law.

1191
01:08:37,711 --> 01:08:41,109
Then we will begin the debate
regarding the anti-abortion law...

1192
01:08:41,110 --> 01:08:42,980
Before we discuss
the anti-abortion law,

1193
01:08:43,211 --> 01:08:45,181
I'd like to make
one thing clear.

1194
01:08:45,721 --> 01:08:47,690
Finding the law
unconstitutional doesn't mean...

1195
01:08:47,950 --> 01:08:49,891
the law will be repealed.

1196
01:08:50,291 --> 01:08:52,860
The exact meaning of
this decision is to revise...

1197
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:55,190
the standard for when
abortion is permitted.

1198
01:08:55,431 --> 01:08:57,501
And to let you know my
personal position on this,

1199
01:08:58,261 --> 01:08:59,530
I think abortion...

1200
01:09:00,061 --> 01:09:01,230
is a sin.

1201
01:09:09,910 --> 01:09:12,541
- Oh my gosh.
- She must have indigestion.

1202
01:09:13,181 --> 01:09:14,511
Are you okay?

1203
01:09:15,280 --> 01:09:16,881
She must have indigestion.

1204
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:18,351
Are you okay?

1205
01:09:42,940 --> 01:09:46,340
(The Great Show)

1206
01:09:46,341 --> 01:09:49,350
- Who are you?
- I'm your son.

1207
01:09:49,351 --> 01:09:51,319
Your passion for your dream.

1208
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:52,720
Why am I your father?

1209
01:09:52,721 --> 01:09:54,189
Hello, Father.

1210
01:09:54,190 --> 01:09:56,650
How am I your father?

1211
01:09:57,020 --> 01:09:59,420
You two might end up dating.

1212
01:09:59,421 --> 01:10:01,990
There's a reason why tabloids
have such a bad reputation.

1213
01:10:02,261 --> 01:10:04,699
How could things
get so complicated?

1214
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:07,131
It's 100 times
harder for Da Jung.

1215
01:10:07,501 --> 01:10:09,301
You're behind that
article, aren't you?

1216
01:10:10,501 --> 01:10:12,300
Let's band together...

1217
01:10:12,301 --> 01:10:14,221
and take Kang Kyung
Hoon's seat in the Assembly.
