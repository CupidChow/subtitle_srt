00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,000
I'm here to play Go.

177
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:26,320
Are you aware Jeonjin Party is
interviewing for candidates?

178
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,200
Yes.

179
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,590
Wie Dae Han is leading
the polls as the

180
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:32,600
projected winner from the party.

181
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,000
I'm sure.

182
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,070
Dae Han is the most well-known
out of all the candidates.

183
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,820
True. As far as that goes,
Wie Dae Han has a much

184
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,810
higher profile than you do.

185
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:49,660
If you're here to quarrel,

186
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,880
I have something to say.

187
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:55,520
Go ahead.

188
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,570
There are rumors that...

189
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:00,140
you bought land around
the Woo's Mall site.

190
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:02,460
Those are just rumors.

191
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:06,690
Since the Prosecutors' Office is
investigating, the truth will surface.

192
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:09,080
Prejudice is a scary thing.

193
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:12,650
It can label an innocent as guilty.

194
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,600
There's a reason for
prejudice at times.

195
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:20,780
Even if the Prosecutors' Office

196
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:24,400
deems me innocent, the
people won't believe it.

197
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,340
They won't believe the truth,

198
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:29,410
but they believe what they want to.

199
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:31,520
That's how relentless
prejudice can be.

200
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:34,920
Just because you leave home and
the party, it won't rid of prejudice.

201
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,990
They all think it's a show.

202
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,100
As long as I'm in politics,

203
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:43,180
I will not be free from
people's prejudice?

204
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:45,050
Is that what you're saying?

205
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:46,500
Correct.

206
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,090
However...

207
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:50,350
you can ignore it.

208
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,230
If you have power.

209
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:56,630
Oh, right.

210
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:59,700
The young lady you
have feelings for.

211
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,280
Is her name Jung Soo Hyun?

212
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,550
I'm told she's the leading
writer for "Dispute."

213
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:08,980
I may have left home, but can't
seem to escape you.

214
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:12,090
I'm not opposed.

215
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:14,740
I feel bad for Hye Jin, but

216
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:17,890
marriage shouldn't be
based on conditions.

217
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:19,980
You should marry for love.

218
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,300
How unexpected.

219
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,710
I'm speaking from
personal experience.

220
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,540
Aigoo.

221
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,900
She seems firm in her convictions,

222
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,760
and very sharp.

223
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:35,980
You should give it a go.

224
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,210
Let's go.

225
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:51,810
I guess you like Ms. Jung.

226
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:55,600
That young lady possesses
something Joon Ho doesn't.

227
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,680
The label "ordinary citizen."

228
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,690
The public would love her
image as the first lady.

229
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:02,670
Right?

230
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:13,960
Ta-da.

231
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,090
For your webtoons.

232
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:17,660
What on earth? You don't
have any money.

233
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,040
I got my paycheck.

234
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,920
Hyung, what about me?

235
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,290
Brother-in-law, anything for me?

236
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:24,850
Of course, there is.

237
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,180
This is...

238
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,210
for our Tae Poong.

239
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33,310
And this is for our Song Yi.

240
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:36,640
Tyrannosaurus. Oh, yeah!

241
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,930
It's not my style,
but I'll still wear it.

242
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:42,330
Thank you.

243
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:45,540
It's on the house.

244
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,690
Oh, thank you.

245
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:49,960
Do you attend Noori High School?

246
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,100
Yes.

247
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:54,480
I see. My daughter
attends there, too.

248
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,930
What grade is she in?

249
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:57,260
11th grade.

250
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,730
Oh, really?

251
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:00,340
We're in the same grade.

252
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:02,810
Hello, Min Ji.

253
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,430
Hey, Min Ji.

254
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,070
- Min Ji...
- Min Ji!

255
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:12,250
Min Ji!

256
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,400
Honey.

257
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,870
Geez, what's the matter with her?

258
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:18,270
I have no idea.

259
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,420
Min Ji!

260
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:25,090
What?

261
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:28,070
Your parents' pork cutlet
is very delicious.

262
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:30,370
Are you screwing with me?

263
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:33,220
Yes, my dad is an old man,

264
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,950
and my stepmom is a foreigner.

265
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:36,320
Is it funny?

266
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,660
Fascinating?

267
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:39,070
No.

268
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:41,710
I feel like I can relate to you.

269
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:43,800
What?

270
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,860
As you know...

271
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:51,770
my family is different
from others, too.

272
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,240
Whatever.

273
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:03,420
[ General Election, D-127 ]

274
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,880
I was thinking...

275
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:11,440
would Chairman Baek
just let you be?

276
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,260
What about Chairman Baek?

277
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:17,340
Chairman Baek was furious at you
for the Hojik Construction incident.

278
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:20,670
Hey, even though he's the party's
chairman, what can he do?

279
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:23,730
Everyone knows I'm
leading the public polls.

280
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:26,460
Regardless,

281
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:31,240
Chairman Baek must be monitoring
your every move right now.

282
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,190
You really should be careful.

283
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:35,760
Don't lose your temper
and cause an incident.

284
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,900
It's not like I'm a child.

285
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:41,720
Hey, why aren't you going
home? Huh?

286
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:45,470
My mom is pressuring me so
much that I can't stay home.

287
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:48,620
It's your fault that I lost my
job. Take responsibility.

288
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:53,130
I have many to take
responsibility for besides you.

289
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:55,230
Anyway, did Tak go somewhere?

290
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:56,660
I haven't seen him all day.

291
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:59,500
I have no idea what
he's up to, either.

292
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,220
What time is it?

293
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,760
What the.

294
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,010
It's already past 11 p.m.?

295
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:06,750
Man, this punk...

296
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,040
What's this?

297
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,040
Yes, it's Wie Dae Han.

298
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,140
<i>This is the Inju Police Department.</i>

299
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:16,410
<i>You're Han Tak's guardian, correct?</i>

300
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:18,480
The police department?

301
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:25,210
Geez, I'm about to go
crazy, seriously.

302
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:28,670
How could he cause an incident
during my interview week?

303
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:32,650
I really didn't hit him.

304
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:34,730
When I got there, he had fainted.

305
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:36,270
What are you talking about?

306
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:38,130
You beat up Hwang Jae Yoon!

307
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:40,620
- Yeah, it was you.
- Whoa.

308
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,570
You punks. How dare you
raise your voice?

309
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,230
Han Tak.

310
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:48,970
What happened?

311
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:50,810
Gang violence? Huh?

312
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:52,200
No, Ahjussi.

313
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,990
I really didn't hit him.
I feel wronged.

314
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:57,540
Why do you stay out so late?

315
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,760
This is why these things happen!

316
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:04,870
Hello, sir.

317
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:07,080
How is the victim doing?

318
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,900
- He's in surgery due to ruptured intestine.
- Pardon?

319
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:13,200
- Ruptured intestine?
- Yes.

320
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,030
And we have conflicting
statements here.

321
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:21,690
Hey! Hey, hey.

322
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:23,460
- Stop him, stop him.
- S***...

323
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:24,990
- Let go of me.
- Stop him!

324
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:28,080
- Hey, hey!
- Come on!

325
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:33,370
You guys...

326
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:35,270
Did you tell the truth?

327
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,660
It's true.

328
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:39,400
- It's the truth.
- Why would we lie?

329
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,480
When Hwang Jae Yoon wakes up,
everything will be revealed.

330
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:50,210
Well, then...

331
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:52,770
what will happen to my son?

332
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:56,890
He'll be in custody until the victim
wakes up and verifies the truth.

333
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:04,990
Wie Dae Han's second child is
at the police station.

334
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,400
He is? Why?

335
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,340
Gang violence on his classmate.

336
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:12,800
The victim even had surgery
for ruptured intestine.

337
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,350
Oh, dear.

338
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,580
Go see the victim's parents.

339
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:18,570
Yes, sir.

340
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:20,970
We should make sure
they're not deeply resentful.

341
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:22,750
I'll get on it.

342
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:30,310
This is so frustrating.

343
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:34,020
I wonder if this general election
will end up like the last one.

344
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,820
Excuse me.

345
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:40,410
Where is Hwang Jae Yoon's ward?

346
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:41,700
Hwang Jae Yoon?

347
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:42,820
Just a minute.

348
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,880
It'll be a few hours until he
regains consciousness.

349
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,870
My son will be okay, right?

350
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:53,760
The surgery went well,
so he should be fine.

351
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,370
Thank you for taking
good care of him.

352
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,200
What's up with you?

353
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,210
How dare you show up here?

354
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:11,180
I feel truly terrible about this.

355
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:17,080
Is Jae Yoon doing okay?

a ruptured intestine.

357
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:23,280
Stabbing with a mechanical pencil
wasn't enough and now gang violence?

358

Aigoo, he's not even human.

You're not even human!

360

I can't stand the sight
of you and your son.

to me again.

until the interviews are over.

368

No, he's not in jail.

369
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:25,110
No need to worry.

370
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:28,260
If Tak is telling the truth,
then all is well.

371
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:30,920
I'm sure he's telling the truth.

372
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,840

Right.

testifies, all will be resolved.

But I don't understand.

377
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:47,030
Why would they put this on Tak?

378
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:49,020
I'm sure they spewed whatever...

379
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:51,250
because they were scared.

380
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:56,340

worry about Tak right now.

I said, no.

469
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:38,690
He is lying.

enough. He'd reveal who hit him!

488
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,740
because I'm unrelated to you?

489
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:47,300
Is that why?

00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,080

May we take that as an
acknowledgment of your son's assault?

518
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:18,440
No.

519
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,200
It's not an acknowledgment.

520
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:23,800
My son said clearly he
didn't attack the student,

521
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,390

710

Hey, daughter!

711
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:40,580
Perfect timing. Glad you're here.

712
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:42,280
Have a seat here. Sit.

713
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:45,830
Aigoo, what is it you want to say?

714
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:48,460
Attorney Kang...

715
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:51,190
came by this afternoon. Yup.

716
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:52,880
What about it?

717
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,780
Attorney Kang said
he's totally into you.

718
00:36:56,870 --> 00:36:59,750
- Attorney Kang said that?
- Yes, he did.

719
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:01,540
And we also heard that...

720
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:05,790
Assemblyman Kang likes
you very much as well.

721
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:11,880
So we were wondering...

722
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:14,080
How do you feel about
Attorney Kang?

723
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:17,220
- Father.
- Yes?

- Mom.
- Yes?

725
00:37:19,090 --> 00:37:22,270
I can't afford any
distractions right now.

726
00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:23,100
Okay?

727
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,990
You know.

728

Tak is in a holding cell right now.

729
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:30,220
That's exactly what
we're saying. That's why!

730
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:34,860
You don't think we know you have
feelings for Wie Dae Han?

731
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:37,950
All the old sayings are true.

732
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:41,380
"A tree with many branches
will suffer from the wind."

733
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:42,960
Just look at Tak.

734
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,840
Yes, Wie Dae Han is a good man,

735
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:47,570
- but still. It's just not right.
- Absolutely.

736
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:50,780
But no one is perfect.

737
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:53,070
No family is perfect, either.

738
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:55,840
Neither Sunbae nor I am perfect.

739
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,800
Yes, I have feelings for Sunbae.

740
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:02,410
Whether it'll progress
or come to an end...

741
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:04,460
I'm not sure about that.

742
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:07,210
Regardless of my choice,

743
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:09,890
it won't be based on
Sunbae's circumstances.

744
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:11,770
Yes, but...

745
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:13,150

Yes.

That's right, you're the

We'll observe from the
sidelines and cheer you on.

You're changing your tune.

What is it?

Are you aware of an

766

No, I didn't.

Then among the male
students in uniforms,

did any of them look suspicious?

No, they didn't.

Yes, he is.

If nothing turns up,
what do we do?

780
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:42,530

That's your motto.

You're right.

786
00:39:52,610 --> 00:39:55,120
There's no point in worrying ahead.

787

But...

788
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,210
I feel so bad toward Ahjussi.

789

Hello.

792

- May I ask something?
- Sure.

793

By chance, did you park in
this spot last night?

794
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:25,200
I didn't park here last night.

Oh, I see.

Thank you.

There's no guarantee that cars...

that parked here last night
will show up tonight.

799
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:39,920
Usually, the same cars are
parked here at nighttime.

800
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,270
Highly possible they park
in the same spot.

801

Aigoo...

802
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:45,720

Hey, you know this.

808

890
00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:55,870
Pardon?

891
00:45:55,870 --> 00:45:57,570
You have to pass that out first.

892
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:13,240
I have no intention
of blaming Jae Yoon.

893
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:14,510
I only...

894
00:46:14,510 --> 00:46:17,120
want to bring forth the truth.

895
00:46:19,430 --> 00:46:21,430
They...

896
00:46:21,430 --> 00:46:23,580
threatened me.

897
00:46:24,890 --> 00:46:27,250
They told me to say
Han Tak beat me.

898
00:46:28,750 --> 00:46:31,130
If I don't, they will kill me.

899
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:34,080
I was scared...

900
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:38,860
I'm sorry.

901
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:44,410
No need to be sorry.

902
00:46:44,410 --> 00:46:46,700
Tak isn't blameless, either.

903
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:59,030
While we proved my son
didn't partake in the assault,

904
00:46:59,030 --> 00:47:01,780
he's not without any faults.

905
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:05,280
And I'm fully responsible
for his faults.

906
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,530
A child is a reflection of his parents,

907
00:47:07,530 --> 00:47:09,690
and this happened...

908
00:47:09,690 --> 00:47:12,380
because I didn't take care
of my son properly.

909
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:16,490
He sure has a way with words.

910
00:47:16,490 --> 00:47:19,240
"The strength of a nation
starts at home."

911
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:23,440
<i>I'm starting to understand
the meaning of this phrase.</i>

912
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:26,910
<i>Before I serve our nation,
I'll dedicate to strengthening</i>

913
00:47:26,910 --> 00:47:30,310
<i>my mind, body, and
my family matters.</i>

914
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:32,610
<i>I'll give it my all.</i>

915
00:47:32,610 --> 00:47:37,040
He's proclaiming himself as a
candidate for the general election.

916
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:42,980
Oppa is not closing the gap.

917
00:47:42,980 --> 00:47:44,910
It seems to be getting wider.

918
00:47:44,910 --> 00:47:46,810
Even if a tee shot goes far,

919
00:47:46,810 --> 00:47:49,020
if it falls in the bunker, I'm ruined.

920
00:47:53,210 --> 00:47:56,040
<i>My idea of healthy conservatism</i>

921
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:58,600
isn't about "no change."

922
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:00,410
We should pace it slowly.

923
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:02,640
But we live in a 5G era.

924
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,840
If you change slowly,
how will you keep up?

925
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:07,820
Can you please hold up
your cellphone?

926
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:08,970
<i>Why?</i>

927
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:11,120
See? Look at that.

928
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:14,180
He speaks of slow-paced change,
yet he has the latest phone.

929
00:48:14,210 --> 00:48:16,570
I thought you might have a 2G phone.

930
00:48:17,770 --> 00:48:21,250
<i>I mean, your father is
DN Party's Chairman Kang.</i>

931
00:48:21,250 --> 00:48:23,880
But you'll be running as an
independent in the election.

932
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:26,160
- You mean it?
- Of course.

933
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:29,230
My father and I have
different political standpoints.

934
00:48:29,230 --> 00:48:31,750
No riding on his coattails
nor his political assets.

935
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:34,930
I want to kick things off on my own.

936
00:48:34,930 --> 00:48:38,060
You say that, but if your
approval ratings don't go up,

937
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:41,880
you'll call it unity and whatnot,
and gather up conservatives.

938
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:46,480
I agree. I'll bet 500 won that you'll
try to bring them together.

939
00:48:51,990 --> 00:48:53,960
Wow, this is not easy.

940
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:04,370
This is Kang Joon Ho.

941
00:49:04,370 --> 00:49:07,080
<i>My apologies for
calling out of the blue.</i>

942
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:10,080
I'm Baek Soo Chang from
the Jeonjin Party.

943
00:49:12,110 --> 00:49:13,760
Here you go.

944
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:18,700
All right, your chicken is ready.

945
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:21,000
- Yay!
- Whoa, looks delicious.

946
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:25,180
Aigoo. A job well done,
the two of you.

947
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:27,370
- You worked so hard.
- Huh?

948
00:49:27,380 --> 00:49:28,980
It was nothing.

949
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:32,380
I guess we just passed out the
"Seeking Eyewitnesses" flyers all day,

950
00:49:32,410 --> 00:49:36,260
and we pulled an all-nighter
on the streets.

951
00:49:36,260 --> 00:49:37,690
Nothing much.

952
00:49:37,690 --> 00:49:40,140
You always make a show of it, huh?

953
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:41,880
Aigoo, I shouldn't say anything.

954
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:45,420
Ta-da! Eat until your
stomachs burst!

955
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:46,890
- It's spicy rice cakes.
- Spicy rice cakes, spicy rice cakes!

956
00:49:46,890 --> 00:49:47,910
Wow, looks delicious.

957
00:49:47,910 --> 00:49:50,060
All right! Chicken!

958
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:50,880
All right!

959
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:53,160
All right, spicy rice cakes!

960
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:56,550
It's a trend to dip it in
these days. Like this!

961
00:50:01,650 --> 00:50:03,840
Wow, this looks great.

962
00:50:07,850 --> 00:50:09,010
Huh?

963
00:50:10,130 --> 00:50:13,620
Whoa, Tak just handed
me a drumstick.

964
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:15,680
Thanks.

965
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:17,900
Wow, looks delicious.

966
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:24,680
Since Tak gave it to me,
it's even tastier.

967
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:27,780
I gave it to you only because
I don't like drumsticks.

968
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:29,080
That's not true.

969
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:31,710
You're crazy about
drumsticks, Hyung.

970
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:38,210
It's picture time. Let's take a picture.

971
00:50:38,210 --> 00:50:39,710
- A picture?
- Yes, picture time.

972
00:50:39,710 --> 00:50:41,050
Okay then.

973
00:50:41,050 --> 00:50:42,240
Make sure we're all in it.

974
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:45,410
Okay, one, two, three!

975
00:50:46,490 --> 00:50:51,420
♫ <i>Even though the breeze
barely touches me</i> ♫

976
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:54,340
♫ <i>But I can wait</i> ♫

977
00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:56,800
<i>Thanks to you, we resolved
my brother's issue.</i>

978
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:58,040
<i>Thank you.</i>

979
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:01,350
<i>This will makeup for
my harassing you before.</i>

980
00:51:01,350 --> 00:51:03,570
<i>And tell your younger brother.</i>

981
00:51:03,570 --> 00:51:07,020
<i>If he gets into trouble again,
Oh Min Ji will kick his butt.</i>

982
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:10,280
Right, right.

983
00:51:10,310 --> 00:51:12,180
What is a family anyway?

984
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:14,500
We gather together to eat,

985
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:17,130
laugh together in the good times,

986
00:51:17,130 --> 00:51:19,850
and cry together during sad times.

987
00:51:19,850 --> 00:51:22,000
We crap in the same toilet...

988
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,010
Dad!

989
00:51:23,010 --> 00:51:26,490
If it gets clogged,
bring on the plunger.

990
00:51:26,490 --> 00:51:29,210
Poop may splash
during the process...

991
00:51:29,210 --> 00:51:30,380
Aigoo!

992
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:32,890
- What's wrong with you?
- That's family for you.

993
00:51:32,890 --> 00:51:34,990
Wow, that's a killer rhyme.

994
00:51:34,990 --> 00:51:35,920
A lime?

995
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:37,270
- It's like a rap.
- Huh?

996
00:51:37,270 --> 00:51:38,760
"We eat together like this,

997
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:40,430
we laugh together in good times,

998
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:42,060
cry together in sad times,

999
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:43,310
and crap in the same toilet."

1000
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:44,680
- Crap!
- "Then bring on the plunger!"

1001
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:46,620
- Plunger!
- "Poop will splash on us!"

1002
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:47,680
Splash!

1003
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:50,850
Song Yi and Tae Poong,
too-too-toom!

1004
00:51:50,890 --> 00:51:52,020
Too-too-toom!

1005
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,510
Now Father!

1006
00:51:54,530 --> 00:51:55,790
Too-too-toom!

1007
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:03,930
Da Jung, is something the matter?

1008
00:52:06,580 --> 00:52:09,310
Da Jung, don't you worry.

1009
00:52:09,310 --> 00:52:12,100
You and "Dreamy" will both be fine.

1010
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:13,940
I can't seem to relax.

1011
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:15,740
My heart is beating so fast...

1012
00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:18,050
Okay, Da Jung. Stay calm.

1013
00:52:18,050 --> 00:52:19,780
Take a deep breath.
A deep breath, okay?

1014
00:52:24,010 --> 00:52:26,550
Spotting blood is pretty common.

1015
00:52:26,550 --> 00:52:29,080
- It's okay, don't worry.
- Yes.

1016
00:52:44,130 --> 00:52:45,370
Are you okay?

1017
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:46,550
This one is faster.

1018
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:48,380
This way. Over here.

1019
00:52:48,380 --> 00:52:49,380
Let's go.

1020
00:53:00,230 --> 00:53:01,300
Wait...

1021
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:03,860
Jung Woo, go on up first.

1022
00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:05,220
We'll take the stairs.

1023
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:06,320
But why?

1024
00:53:10,630 --> 00:53:12,410
It's just something. Hurry along.

1025
00:53:12,410 --> 00:53:14,460
- Soo Hyun, let's go.
- Wait.

1026
00:53:16,750 --> 00:53:17,920
I'm fine.

1027
00:53:19,010 --> 00:53:20,680
Let's go up together.

1028
00:53:32,330 --> 00:53:33,960
Will you be okay?

1029
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:35,850
Are you all right?

1030
00:53:48,190 --> 00:53:49,810
<i>Unni...</i>

1031
00:53:49,810 --> 00:53:51,220
<i>I'm suffocating.</i>

1032
00:53:51,220 --> 00:53:53,530
<i>Please get me out of here.</i>

1033
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:58,900
<i>Unni...</i>

1034
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:00,350
<i>Unni, please...</i>

1035
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:02,830
Are you okay?

1036
00:54:02,830 --> 00:54:04,970
<i>Unni, get me out.</i>

1037
00:54:04,970 --> 00:54:06,510
<i>Unni.</i>

1038
00:54:06,510 --> 00:54:08,220
<i>Unni...</i>

1039
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:12,620
- Let's go.
- Yes.

1040
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:23,100
I'm fine. Go on in.

1041
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:25,120
Okay, then. We'll go in first.

1042
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:27,390
Go ahead. We'll be right there.

1043
00:54:27,390 --> 00:54:29,770
What are you saying?
Hurry up and go.

1044
00:54:29,770 --> 00:54:31,350
You'll really be okay?

1045
00:54:31,350 --> 00:54:33,810
I'm fine. Go on in.

1046
00:54:33,810 --> 00:54:35,560
- I'll be right back after the appointment.
- Okay.

1047
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:37,300
Stay here and rest, okay?

1048
00:54:42,590 --> 00:54:45,660
Fortunately, the baby is healthy.

1049
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:52,290
I told you.

1050
00:54:52,290 --> 00:54:54,580
I told you it would be fine.

1051
00:54:55,690 --> 00:54:58,840
Pardon me. Then why the spotting...

1052
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:01,250
Spotting blood is
a common occurrence.

1053
00:55:01,250 --> 00:55:03,960
However, please take better care.

1054
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:07,860
Not just your body, but peace
of mind is very important.

1055
00:55:11,020 --> 00:55:13,040
She says I'm fine.

1056
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:14,940
You should go to Unni.

1057
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:36,580
Da Jung is better than me.

1058
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:39,980
What are you talking about?

1059
00:55:39,990 --> 00:55:44,400
If weren't for Da Jung, would you
have taken the elevator?

1060
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:54,510
Since I don't take elevators,
I get exercise. It's great.

1061
00:55:54,510 --> 00:55:56,210
Unni.

1062
00:55:56,210 --> 00:55:58,650
Please let me go now.

1063
00:56:00,020 --> 00:56:02,400
It's not just the elevators.

1064
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,380
You can't ride in airplanes, either.

1065
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:07,100
You've never taken an
overseas trip like others.

1066

1067
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:14,990
It's not fair at all.

1068
00:56:21,450 --> 00:56:22,890
You died...

1069
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:25,520
because of me.

1070
00:56:27,290 --> 00:56:29,660
Why is it your fault?

1071
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:33,970
Thanks to you, the cause
of the accident came to light.

1072
00:56:33,970 --> 00:56:38,980
And you have many good
people by your side now.

1073
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:42,160

No, that's not it.

What did you want to say...

1088
00:58:11,430 --> 00:58:14,340
I heard you'll be running
as an independent.

1089
00:58:14,340 --> 00:58:15,950
That's the plan.

1090
00:58:17,070 --> 00:58:20,120
You won't be riding on
your father's coattails.

1091

That's more difficult to
do than it sounds.

You're incredible.

1093

However...

1094
00:58:36,430 --> 00:58:40,140
it'll be hard to get elected
as an independent.

1095
00:58:40,140 --> 00:58:43,450
Even if you get elected and make
it to the National Assembly,

1096
00:58:43,450 --> 00:58:46,420
it'll be difficult to carry
out your vision.

1097
00:58:46,420 --> 00:58:47,910
I know that.

1098

"progressive" or "conservative."

1103
00:59:02,170 --> 00:59:04,360
is not the packaging.

1104
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:05,930
It's what's inside.

1105
00:59:05,930 --> 00:59:09,910
And what is the point you're
trying to make, Chairman?

1106
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:25,330
I'll cut to the chase and
get to the point.

1107
00:59:25,330 --> 00:59:27,280
We want you to...

1108

Well, they don't want
a new panel anymore, but

since Hye Jin will also
run in the election,

1131
01:00:33,330 --> 01:00:35,410
