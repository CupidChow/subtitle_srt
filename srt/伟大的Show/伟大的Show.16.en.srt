(All characters, organizations, places, entities, and events...)

2
00:00:18,467 --> 00:00:20,001
(in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:21,336 --> 00:00:24,512
What did you call me here at this hour to say?

4
00:00:25,907 --> 00:00:27,052
Han Da Jung.

5
00:00:28,977 --> 00:00:30,582
I know that she isn't your daughter.

6
00:00:33,677 --> 00:00:35,421
I know who the real father is too.

7
00:00:41,287 --> 00:00:42,961
What are you talking about?

8
00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:45,732
You must know that better than anyone.

9
00:00:47,997 --> 00:00:50,572
The reason I'm telling you instead of the media...

10
00:00:52,096 --> 00:00:54,042
is because I don't want Da Jung, who was used by you,

11
00:00:54,666 --> 00:00:56,542
to be hurt any further.

12
00:01:03,747 --> 00:01:04,822
So?

13
00:01:06,047 --> 00:01:08,992
What do you want from me?

14
00:01:10,016 --> 00:01:11,322
The one who tied the knot...

15
00:01:12,187 --> 00:01:13,962
should be the one who unties it.

16
00:01:15,887 --> 00:01:17,701
I won't go public with this,

17
00:01:18,557 --> 00:01:19,801
so drop out of the election.

18
00:01:22,327 --> 00:01:26,471
That's the only way to protect Da Jung and yourself.

19
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:37,176
I don't want to beat you...

20
00:01:37,176 --> 00:01:38,652
and go to the Assembly like this.

21
00:01:39,447 --> 00:01:42,146
But as a citizen, I can't forgive you...

22
00:01:42,146 --> 00:01:43,391
for using orphans...

23
00:01:43,887 --> 00:01:46,162
for your political agenda.

24
00:01:57,697 --> 00:01:59,602
Election Day is almost here.

25
00:02:00,766 --> 00:02:01,841
I know.

26
00:02:02,937 --> 00:02:04,482
Who do you think will win?

27
00:02:05,036 --> 00:02:06,182
I don't know.

28
00:02:06,467 --> 00:02:08,837
Dae Han and Joon Ho are neck-and-neck,

29
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:10,421
so I have no idea.

30
00:02:13,046 --> 00:02:14,921
This is really only if, but...

31
00:02:16,217 --> 00:02:17,991
if Mr. Wi loses,

32
00:02:20,717 --> 00:02:22,431
I'll be very sad.

33
00:02:24,126 --> 00:02:26,901
Don't worry. I'm sure he'll do well.

34
00:02:32,066 --> 00:02:33,542
Life is about choices.

35
00:02:35,497 --> 00:02:36,912
And those choices...

36
00:02:38,036 --> 00:02:39,241
come with responsibilities.

37
00:02:54,187 --> 00:02:55,331
This is the time...

38
00:02:57,527 --> 00:02:59,461
for me to bear that responsibility.

39
00:03:00,596 --> 00:03:04,401
(Final Episode: The Great Choice)

40
00:03:04,497 --> 00:03:06,696
- Please vote for him! - Please vote for him.

41
00:03:06,696 --> 00:03:07,867
- The National Candidate. - Wi Dae Han.

42
00:03:07,867 --> 00:03:09,596
- National Dad. Number four. - Thank you.

43
00:03:09,596 --> 00:03:10,767
- Wi Dae Han. - Thank you.

44
00:03:10,767 --> 00:03:12,467
- Please vote for Wi Dae Han! - Candidate number four.

45
00:03:12,467 --> 00:03:13,576
Please vote for Wi Dae Han.

46
00:03:13,576 --> 00:03:15,907
Where is this guy?

47
00:03:15,907 --> 00:03:17,222
His phone is off too.

48
00:03:17,307 --> 00:03:18,376
Please vote for him!

49
00:03:18,376 --> 00:03:19,677
Please vote for Wi Dae Han.

50
00:03:19,677 --> 00:03:20,747
Please vote for Wi Dae Han.

51
00:03:20,747 --> 00:03:22,017
How busy is he...

52
00:03:22,017 --> 00:03:23,592
that he had to sleep in his campaign office?

53
00:03:24,187 --> 00:03:27,391
Right? Elections are terrible.

54
00:03:27,886 --> 00:03:30,532
I'm worried he'll faint before the elections are over.

55
00:03:30,886 --> 00:03:32,662
The elections are in three days, right?

56
00:03:34,696 --> 00:03:36,072
Why am I so nervous?

57
00:03:38,096 --> 00:03:40,171
Do you know how many days are left until we get to meet Dreamy?

58
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:43,812
Of course. Your due date is the 13th.

59
00:03:44,937 --> 00:03:46,342
What a great daddy.

60
00:03:47,737 --> 00:03:49,576
Your due date is coming up,

61
00:03:49,576 --> 00:03:50,946
so don't worry about the election,

62
00:03:50,946 --> 00:03:52,722
and relax and think only happy thoughts.

63
00:03:59,647 --> 00:04:02,361
How's Daddy's tuna ramen? Good, right?

64
00:04:02,386 --> 00:04:04,361
- Yes. - It's super yummy.

65
00:04:07,897 --> 00:04:10,671
How's your new school? Are the kids nice?

66
00:04:11,196 --> 00:04:13,542
Kids are the same everywhere.

67
00:04:14,467 --> 00:04:15,942
Did you really quit gambling?

68
00:04:19,837 --> 00:04:22,251
When did I gamble?

69
00:04:24,407 --> 00:04:26,782
What about work? Did you find a job?

70
00:04:29,377 --> 00:04:32,462
I'm looking for a storefront to open a chicken place.

71
00:04:33,887 --> 00:04:35,786
What should we call the restaurant?

72
00:04:35,786 --> 00:04:37,861
- Song Yi's Chicken. - Tae Poong's Chicken!

73
00:04:46,496 --> 00:04:48,071
(Wi Dae Han)

74
00:04:50,936 --> 00:04:53,111
- What is it so early? - Sir.

75
00:04:54,007 --> 00:04:56,011
I'm near your house.

76
00:04:57,077 --> 00:04:58,181
What?

77
00:05:07,157 --> 00:05:09,292
What brings you to Chuncheon this early in the morning?

78
00:05:12,856 --> 00:05:13,931
Today,

79
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:17,202
I'm holding a press conference to drop out of the election.

80
00:05:19,366 --> 00:05:22,571
Why? The election is only a few days away.

81
00:05:22,796 --> 00:05:24,881
I decided to drop out...

82
00:05:25,067 --> 00:05:28,551
because I want to protect Da Jung and be a dad she can be proud of.

83
00:05:31,077 --> 00:05:33,582
Did you come all the way here to tell me that?

84
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:35,392
I understand.

85
00:05:36,476 --> 00:05:37,621
What do you mean?

86
00:05:37,786 --> 00:05:40,162
You need money if you want to live with the kids,

87
00:05:40,887 --> 00:05:43,092
and that's probably why you gave Kang Kyung Hoon the information.

88
00:05:45,426 --> 00:05:47,296
If you're going to keep talking nonsense, I'm leaving.

89
00:05:47,296 --> 00:05:48,371
Sir.

90
00:05:49,556 --> 00:05:51,171
I believe...

91
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:55,142
the kids want a dad of whom they can be proud, even if he's poor.

92
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:58,511
Return the money Kang Kyung Hoon gave you.

93
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:02,111
What money are you talking about?

94
00:06:02,306 --> 00:06:04,751
You're so annoying.

95
00:06:05,346 --> 00:06:06,421
Sir.

96
00:06:06,746 --> 00:06:10,022
And please, keep your promise...

97
00:06:10,887 --> 00:06:14,032
to take the secret about Da Jung's real dad to your grave.

98
00:06:14,616 --> 00:06:15,861
I'm begging you.

99
00:06:29,837 --> 00:06:30,936
Kang Joon Ho.

100
00:06:30,936 --> 00:06:32,837
Candidate number three, Kang Joon Ho.

101
00:06:32,837 --> 00:06:34,736
- Hello. - Number three, Kang Joon Ho.

102
00:06:34,736 --> 00:06:36,337
- Please vote for him. - Vote for him.

103
00:06:36,337 --> 00:06:37,746
- Vote for him. - Vote for him.

104
00:06:37,746 --> 00:06:39,881
Candidate number three, Kang Joon Ho.

105
00:06:40,277 --> 00:06:41,846
- Please vote for him. - Thank you.

106
00:06:41,846 --> 00:06:44,092
Thank you.

107
00:06:44,387 --> 00:06:46,191
Why do you look so down?

108
00:06:46,286 --> 00:06:47,691
Are you worried about something?

109
00:06:48,986 --> 00:06:50,392
No, I'm just tired.

110
00:06:50,686 --> 00:06:53,032
Smile even if you're tired. Like me.

111
00:06:53,426 --> 00:06:55,602
You'll lose all the votes if you frown like that.

112
00:06:56,096 --> 00:06:57,202
Smile.

113
00:06:57,796 --> 00:07:00,436
- Hello. - Number three, Kang Joon Ho.

114
00:07:00,436 --> 00:07:02,472
- Hello. - Number three, Kang Joon Ho.

115
00:07:02,637 --> 00:07:05,582
Are you trying to win this election or not?

116
00:07:05,936 --> 00:07:07,212
Where are you?

117
00:07:07,306 --> 00:07:09,181
I saw the kids' dad in Chuncheon.

118
00:07:09,507 --> 00:07:10,621
Chuncheon?

119
00:07:11,176 --> 00:07:13,152
What's the press conference about?

120
00:07:14,647 --> 00:07:16,522
I can't talk over the phone.

121
00:07:17,286 --> 00:07:19,722
Come over. Let's talk at home.

122
00:07:22,556 --> 00:07:24,027
(The Great TV, Please trust me!)

123
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:25,202
(Hello. 1, 2, 3!)

124
00:07:26,587 --> 00:07:29,431
This is so funny. It'll be a big hit.

125
00:07:30,796 --> 00:07:33,102
This is about us.

126
00:07:33,397 --> 00:07:36,071
So much happened after I met Mr. Wi.

127
00:07:37,337 --> 00:07:40,241
Sure. It was very eventful.

128
00:07:41,337 --> 00:07:45,621
The joy and sadness that I felt, how I was moved...

129
00:07:47,377 --> 00:07:49,392
I wanted to share them with the readers.

130
00:07:50,686 --> 00:07:53,761
Does the main character get elected into the National Assembly?

131
00:08:01,657 --> 00:08:02,871
It's the main character.

132
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:05,801
Hi, Dae Han.

133
00:08:21,546 --> 00:08:23,077
(Vote 4 Wi Dae Han)

134
00:08:23,077 --> 00:08:24,162
Bong Joo.

135
00:08:25,246 --> 00:08:26,761
Did he call you too?

136
00:08:27,017 --> 00:08:29,361
Yes. Did something happen to him?

137
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:31,931
I'm sure something's up,

138
00:08:32,056 --> 00:08:34,972
but I'm going crazy because I have no idea what.

139
00:08:41,737 --> 00:08:43,241
What's up? What is it?

140
00:08:44,507 --> 00:08:46,342
Sit down. Let's sit and talk.

141
00:08:51,076 --> 00:08:53,452
What's with the suit?

142
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:57,222
Why are you suddenly having a press conference?

143
00:08:57,786 --> 00:09:00,092
What? A press conference?

144
00:09:00,757 --> 00:09:01,891
Well...

145
00:09:03,117 --> 00:09:05,562
I have a press conference at 3pm.

146
00:09:06,426 --> 00:09:07,572
But why?

147
00:09:08,997 --> 00:09:11,371
Something happened with Kang Joon Ho last night, right?

148
00:09:14,536 --> 00:09:16,271
Tell us already.

149
00:09:20,806 --> 00:09:21,881
Bong Joo.

150
00:09:26,076 --> 00:09:28,322
I'm really sorry, but...

151
00:09:32,517 --> 00:09:34,631
I'm going to give up on this election.

152
00:09:37,586 --> 00:09:38,802
What?

153
00:09:43,497 --> 00:09:46,127
Wi Dae Han contacted reporters...

154
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:48,212
to have a press conference at 3pm.

155
00:09:49,196 --> 00:09:51,812
He must have decided to drop out of the election.

156
00:09:51,836 --> 00:09:55,881
Seeing as Joon Ho met with him last night, I think you're right.

157
00:09:57,176 --> 00:09:59,182
It's too soon to relax.

158
00:09:59,706 --> 00:10:02,991
I've made preparations just in case.

159
00:10:05,216 --> 00:10:06,322
(Vote 4 Wi Dae Han)

160
00:10:07,086 --> 00:10:10,586
That jerk Kang Joon Ho acted like a gentleman,

161
00:10:10,586 --> 00:10:12,826
but he's blackmailing you.

162
00:10:12,826 --> 00:10:15,126
How is he any different from Kang Kyung Hoon?

163
00:10:15,127 --> 00:10:17,102
Don't criticize Joon Ho.

164
00:10:17,426 --> 00:10:19,541
He believes someone like me...

165
00:10:19,566 --> 00:10:22,111
doesn't deserve to be in the National Assembly.

166
00:10:24,436 --> 00:10:26,041
I agree.

167
00:10:29,436 --> 00:10:30,682
Sir.

168
00:10:30,847 --> 00:10:34,092
Even so, you can't give up now.

169
00:10:34,277 --> 00:10:37,692
Let's tell Da Jung the truth.

170
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:40,446
Confess that you're not her real father,

171
00:10:40,446 --> 00:10:41,716
and beg for forgiveness.

172
00:10:41,716 --> 00:10:43,932
There's another election four years later,

173
00:10:44,786 --> 00:10:47,531
but the pain Da Jung will suffer from knowing the truth...

174
00:10:48,597 --> 00:10:50,531
will never go away.

175
00:10:52,066 --> 00:10:55,597
Dae Han, I understand you're worried about Da Jung,

176
00:10:55,597 --> 00:10:57,306
but she's tough.

177
00:10:57,306 --> 00:11:00,141
It'll be just as traumatic for her...

178
00:11:00,237 --> 00:11:01,982
if you drop out of the election...

179
00:11:02,477 --> 00:11:04,621
as the fact that you're not her real father.

180
00:11:04,877 --> 00:11:06,781
That's why I asked you to come.

181
00:11:07,576 --> 00:11:09,751
Talk to her so that she can accept...

182
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:12,991
that I'm dropping out of the election.

183

Sir.

185
00:11:25,027 --> 00:11:26,842
You're hiding something from us, aren't you?

186
00:11:28,966 --> 00:11:30,267
I am not.

187
00:11:30,267 --> 00:11:32,705
Then why did you go all the way to Chuncheon this morning?

188
00:11:32,706 --> 00:11:35,151
You went to Chuncheon?

189
00:11:35,777 --> 00:11:37,082
Why?

190
00:11:45,686 --> 00:11:49,361
What is it? You need to tell us so we can help you.

191
00:11:49,686 --> 00:11:51,987
What? Did Da Jung's real dad show up or something?

192
00:11:51,987 --> 00:11:54,826
Well... I thought about this all night long before deciding,

193
00:11:54,826 --> 00:11:57,332
so please... Bong Joo.

194
00:11:57,867 --> 00:12:02,011
Please trust me and do as I say.

195
00:12:02,137 --> 00:12:05,241
No. I can't do that.

196
00:12:06,436 --> 00:12:08,151
Dropping out of the election...

197
00:12:08,336 --> 00:12:12,021
isn't just your business. My life depends on it too.

198
00:12:13,446 --> 00:12:15,076
- Bong Joo... - Sir.

199
00:12:15,076 --> 00:12:16,621
If you don't tell us,

200
00:12:16,877 --> 00:12:19,391
I'll just have to ask Han Dong Nam myself.

201
00:12:20,247 --> 00:12:23,562
Dae Han, don't suffer alone. Tell us.

202
00:12:24,357 --> 00:12:26,932
Let's resolve this together. Okay?

205
00:12:42,936 --> 00:12:45,482
got pregnant with Da Jung because she was raped.

206
00:12:56,456 --> 00:12:59,062
I can't let Da Jung find out...

207
00:13:00,857 --> 00:13:02,972
a monster like that is her real dad.

208
00:13:04,196 --> 00:13:06,401
We need to protect Da Jung...

209
00:13:06,597 --> 00:13:08,342
and her baby.

210
00:13:18,676 --> 00:13:21,021
I understand how you feel.

211
00:13:21,977 --> 00:13:23,322
Let's do that.

212
00:13:23,716 --> 00:13:26,962
Let's protect Da Jung...

213

and her baby.

214
00:13:38,296 --> 00:13:41,541
Okay. At the press conference,

215
00:13:43,566 --> 00:13:45,511
I'll say I took the kids in...

216
00:13:45,966 --> 00:13:48,381
to get rid of my image as the reprobate son. Nothing more.

217
00:13:48,676 --> 00:13:51,251
That's the only way they won't bring up her real dad.

218
00:13:52,046 --> 00:13:55,791
Okay. That's all I'll tell Da Jung.

219
00:13:58,686 --> 00:14:01,192
Okay. Thanks.

220
00:14:02,286 --> 00:14:05,487
Da Jung, why doesn't Mr. Wi broadcast "The Great TV" anymore?

221
00:14:05,487 --> 00:14:07,696
He seems to be super busy lately.

222
00:14:07,696 --> 00:14:09,497
That's probably why.

223
00:14:09,497 --> 00:14:12,842
How is he doing in the polls? Is he leading?

224
00:14:13,127 --> 00:14:15,935
I don't know very well,

225
00:14:15,936 --> 00:14:17,867
but I think it keeps flip-flopping.

226
00:14:17,867 --> 00:14:22,075
Da Jung, how about Dreamy? When is Dreamy coming?

227
00:14:22,076 --> 00:14:24,621
Soon. Dreamy says to wait a little.

228
00:14:26,076 --> 00:14:27,621
Here's Soo Hyun.

229
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:31,216

Hello. You're here.

248
00:15:36,347 --> 00:15:38,685
Why is he holding a press conference right before the election?

249
00:15:38,686 --> 00:15:40,247
Did something happen to Dae Han?

250
00:15:40,247 --> 00:15:42,216
I have no idea.

251
00:15:42,216 --> 00:15:45,161
I asked, but he wouldn't say.

252
00:15:45,186 --> 00:15:48,602
There are so many reporters here. Gosh.

253
00:15:48,857 --> 00:15:52,672
You must be busy campaigning. I'm sorry for taking your time.

254
00:15:53,367 --> 00:15:57,271
It's okay. What did you want to talk about?

255
00:15:57,566 --> 00:15:59,611
You know Dae Han is holding...

256
00:16:00,036 --> 00:16:01,312
a press conference, right?

257
00:16:01,977 --> 00:16:04,281
Yes, I heard.

258
00:16:04,306 --> 00:16:08,121
Da Jung went to stop him from dropping out of the election.

259
00:16:16,686 --> 00:16:18,832
The person you have reached...

260
00:16:18,987 --> 00:16:20,531
He won't pick up.

261
00:16:22,056 --> 00:16:24,031
It's 10 minutes to 3.

262
00:16:24,867 --> 00:16:29,111
It's faster if we take that side street over there.

263
00:16:29,867 --> 00:16:32,812
I can't get there either until the light changes.

264
00:16:35,576 --> 00:16:38,322
The fact that Dae Han gave up on the election...

265
00:16:38,377 --> 00:16:40,521
means he gave up everything...

266
00:16:41,076 --> 00:16:42,791
for Da Jung.

267
00:16:43,777 --> 00:16:45,922
Whatever he chooses,

268
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:50,562
please don't let people find out about Da Jung's real dad.

269
00:16:53,926 --> 00:16:55,771
You said before...

270
00:16:55,956 --> 00:16:58,472
that if Dae Han and I face off at the election,

271
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:01,472
you'll have to choose between the best and second best.

272
00:17:03,867 --> 00:17:05,281
I remember.

273
00:17:05,867 --> 00:17:07,442
Did you...

274
00:17:08,436 --> 00:17:10,912
choose which is the best?

275
00:17:15,047 --> 00:17:16,122
I did.

276
00:17:19,787 --> 00:17:22,261

277
00:17:22,887 --> 00:17:24,862
not to win,

278
00:17:25,256 --> 00:17:28,702
but because you wanted to do good politics?

279
00:17:30,857 --> 00:17:33,942
Dae Han chose the best he could do.

280
00:17:35,436 --> 00:17:36,811
I hope...

281
00:17:37,936 --> 00:17:40,112

289
00:18:11,307 --> 00:18:13,341
facts and the truth are different things.

290

It's a fact that you're not Da Jung's real dad,

291
00:18:17,236 --> 00:18:20,722
but I feel like the truth may be different.

292

The truth is,

293

I deceived the nation with my lies.

294

I am standing before you...

to apologize to the people...

309
00:20:02,147 --> 00:20:04,091
who have given me the nickname of National Dad...

310
00:20:04,746 --> 00:20:08,557

The reason why I...

314
00:20:17,867 --> 00:20:20,041
took in my daughter and three of her siblings...

315
00:20:21,067 --> 00:20:23,612
wasn’t because I was concerned about them.

316
00:20:24,367 --> 00:20:25,642
- What did he just say? - What?

317
00:20:26,236 --> 00:20:27,907
- What is he saying? - What is he talking about?

318
00:20:27,907 --> 00:20:29,511
It was to create an image for myself...

319
00:20:30,776 --> 00:20:32,722
as a loving father of four kids...

320
00:20:35,246 --> 00:20:38,692
and to erase the image of a reprobate son.

321
00:20:43,117 --> 00:20:44,831
To this end,

322
00:20:45,887 --> 00:20:47,456
I even drafted and asked my daughter to sign...

323
00:20:47,456 --> 00:20:49,101
a father-daughter contract...

324
00:20:51,097 --> 00:20:52,472

No.

00:23:27,617 --> 00:23:29,061
is that really so important?

365
00:23:38,926 --> 00:23:41,496
(Dreaming of Great Politics)

366
00:23:41,496 --> 00:23:43,811
(Written by Wi Dae Han)

367
00:23:53,047 --> 00:23:55,351
(Father-Daughter Contract)

368
00:24:01,686 --> 00:24:04,902
(Test subjects are not parent and child.)

369
00:24:08,627 --> 00:24:10,571
Candidate Wi Dae Han and my siblings and I...

370
00:24:11,827 --> 00:24:13,301
are not related by blood.

371
00:24:14,097 --> 00:24:15,212
But...

372
00:24:16,436 --> 00:24:17,872
while we stayed together,

373
00:24:19,907 --> 00:24:22,051
he became the best dad we've ever had.

374
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:25,021
To me,

375
00:24:25,807 --> 00:24:28,591
he is now, and will always be...

376
00:24:31,047 --> 00:24:32,662
the best Dad...

377
00:24:34,887 --> 00:24:36,392
and my one and only Dad.

378
00:24:38,986 --> 00:24:40,261
Of course,

379
00:24:41,287 --> 00:24:42,531
my dad...

380
00:24:43,827 --> 00:24:45,402
is not perfect.

381
00:24:46,597 --> 00:24:49,372
But neither is he a reprobate son,

382
00:24:51,297 --> 00:24:52,781
nor a conman.

383
00:24:53,807 --> 00:24:55,682
What I know about Wi Dae Han as a person...

384
00:24:56,637 --> 00:24:58,222
which I've seen while living together,

385
00:25:00,607 --> 00:25:02,222
is that he may be lacking in some ways,

386
00:25:04,716 --> 00:25:05,922
but is a man with a good heart,

387
00:25:08,216 --> 00:25:09,962
more than anyone.

388
00:25:13,587 --> 00:25:14,831
And now...

389
00:25:16,526 --> 00:25:20,071
he is going to give up his dream because he is afraid...

390
00:25:23,436 --> 00:25:25,541
that everyone will hurt me if they find out...

391
00:25:27,367 --> 00:25:30,251
that I am not his real daughter.

392
00:25:32,676 --> 00:25:34,991
If you give up your dream, Dad,

393
00:25:37,246 --> 00:25:38,422
it will leave me...

394
00:25:40,587 --> 00:25:42,862
with indelible scars.

395
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:02,682
Just like how you were a good dad to me and my siblings,

396
00:26:03,807 --> 00:26:06,021
I believe that you will be a good assemblyman,

397
00:26:07,907 --> 00:26:09,491
who knows how to empathize...

398
00:26:11,446 --> 00:26:13,491
and shed tears with people.

399
00:26:16,916 --> 00:26:18,561
Please, don't give up.

400
00:26:20,127 --> 00:26:23,031
I beg of you, Dad.

401
00:26:28,637 --> 00:26:29,741
She is right!

402
00:26:34,807 --> 00:26:36,581
Blood is not important.

403
00:26:38,077 --> 00:26:40,051
What's more important is not your blood...

404
00:26:41,577 --> 00:26:42,991
but your heart.

405
00:26:44,446 --> 00:26:46,521
Why are you the son of Inju Market?

406
00:26:47,047 --> 00:26:51,061
That's because you treat merchants like family.

407
00:26:53,026 --> 00:26:55,071
That's what makes you the son of Inju Market.

408
00:26:57,196 --> 00:27:00,771
You have confessed everything you have done wrong.

409
00:27:01,797 --> 00:27:04,271
Don't quit. You'll be judged by the vote.

410
00:27:05,236 --> 00:27:06,382
And I...

411
00:27:07,736 --> 00:27:08,912
am not asking you for a favor.

412
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:11,482
This is an order.

413
00:27:13,476 --> 00:27:15,452
It's an order from a citizen of Inju City!

414
00:27:17,476 --> 00:27:18,662
Am I right?

415
00:27:18,787 --> 00:27:21,321
- Yes, he's right! - You can't quit!

416
00:27:21,617 --> 00:27:23,061
- Don't give up. - You should continue!

417
00:27:24,087 --> 00:27:26,157
- You can't give up now. - You should keep going.

418
00:27:26,157 --> 00:27:28,297
- Don't quit! - Keep going!

419
00:27:28,297 --> 00:27:29,996
- You should continue! - Don't quit now.

420
00:27:29,996 --> 00:27:32,472
- You can do it, Wi Dae Han! - Yes, you can!

421
00:27:32,996 --> 00:27:34,972
- I'll support you! - Don't give up.

422
00:27:35,067 --> 00:27:37,097
- It's okay! - We'll support you.

423
00:27:37,097 --> 00:27:38,442
- You shouldn't give up. - Continue with the election!

424
00:27:39,107 --> 00:27:41,567
- You can do it, Wi Dae Han! - Keep moving forward!

425
00:27:41,567 --> 00:27:43,382
- I support you! - We will vote for you.

426
00:27:43,577 --> 00:27:45,551
- Come on, Wi Dae Han! - You can do it.

427
00:27:45,847 --> 00:27:47,547
- You shouldn't give up. - Keep moving forward!

428
00:27:47,547 --> 00:27:48,692
- Wi Dae Han! - You can do it!

429
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:52,192
Da Jung, you are also...

430
00:27:53,916 --> 00:27:55,761
the best daughter for me.

431
00:27:57,686 --> 00:28:00,862
Regardless of the outcome,

432
00:28:03,897 --> 00:28:06,071
I will do my best until the end.

433
00:28:10,897 --> 00:28:12,382
Wi Dae Han!

434
00:28:12,766 --> 00:28:14,241
- Wi Dae Han! - Wi Dae Han!

435
00:28:14,506 --> 00:28:15,982
- Wi Dae Han! - Wi Dae Han!

436
00:28:16,337 --> 00:28:17,781
- Wi Dae Han! - Wi Dae Han!

437
00:28:18,107 --> 00:28:19,722
- Wi Dae Han! - Wi Dae Han!

438
00:28:19,877 --> 00:28:21,581
- Thank you. - Wi Dae Han!

439
00:28:21,976 --> 00:28:23,722
I will do my best until the end...

440
00:28:25,516 --> 00:28:27,991
and I'll wait for the judgment from the voters.

441
00:28:28,716 --> 00:28:29,932
Judgment?

442
00:28:34,756 --> 00:28:35,831
Come in.

443
00:28:45,907 --> 00:28:50,251
Tak, does that mean Mr. Wi is not Da Jung's real father?

444
00:28:50,506 --> 00:28:54,122
Didn't you hear just now? That's not important.

445
00:28:54,377 --> 00:28:58,351
I would like to say something to not just my daughter,

446
00:28:59,847 --> 00:29:02,061
but the three kids who've become my family.

447
00:29:03,016 --> 00:29:05,662
Mr. Wi has something to tell us.

448
00:29:05,956 --> 00:29:08,771
Be quiet. I can't hear him.

449
00:29:09,857 --> 00:29:10,972
Tak,

450
00:29:13,127 --> 00:29:14,271
Tae Poong,

451
00:29:15,966 --> 00:29:17,142
and Song Yi.

452
00:29:19,307 --> 00:29:21,682
The time I spent with you...

453
00:29:28,147 --> 00:29:30,851
were the best moments in my life.

454
00:29:35,587 --> 00:29:37,432
I'm truly thankful...

455
00:29:39,557 --> 00:29:41,031
and I love you.

456
00:29:43,627 --> 00:29:45,827
Do you like Mr. Wi that much?

457
00:29:45,827 --> 00:29:47,372
- Yes! - Yes!

458
00:29:55,637 --> 00:29:56,712
(Nationalist Party)

459
00:29:57,537 --> 00:30:00,821
You must be busy with the campaign. What brings you here?

460
00:30:03,716 --> 00:30:07,162
I wanted to ask you a favor, Father.

461
00:30:09,657 --> 00:30:10,862
What favor?

462
00:30:11,117 --> 00:30:12,331
About Da Jung.

463
00:30:13,057 --> 00:30:14,261
Dae Han's daughter.

464
00:30:14,827 --> 00:30:19,142
Please don't let others know about her biological father.

465
00:30:21,567 --> 00:30:23,297
It's not like it's up to me.

466
00:30:23,297 --> 00:30:25,612
The things you did for me...

467
00:30:26,006 --> 00:30:29,311
were hurtful rather than helpful.

468
00:30:31,206 --> 00:30:34,321
Da Jung is pregnant.

469
00:30:34,946 --> 00:30:36,591
You can't hurt someone...

470
00:30:37,946 --> 00:30:41,462
who is pregnant just to win an election.

471
00:30:41,916 --> 00:30:43,091
If...

472
00:30:43,857 --> 00:30:45,256
you would do something like that...

473
00:30:45,256 --> 00:30:46,632
Don't worry.

474
00:30:46,926 --> 00:30:48,557
Like I told you,

475
00:30:48,557 --> 00:30:50,571
I'm going to leave it completely up to you...

476
00:30:50,827 --> 00:30:52,972
how you use that recording.

477
00:30:54,926 --> 00:30:57,236
I brought some cold drinks.

478
00:30:57,236 --> 00:30:58,612
This is for the pregnant lady.

479
00:31:00,006 --> 00:31:01,212
There.

480
00:31:01,466 --> 00:31:03,206
You know what?

481
00:31:03,206 --> 00:31:06,547
I feel like I'm aging 10 years each day because of Mr. Wi.

482
00:31:06,547 --> 00:31:08,847
Aging is nothing.

483
00:31:08,847 --> 00:31:13,422
My stomach felt so tight, I thought I was going to pee in my pants!

484
00:31:14,186 --> 00:31:15,331
Dad!

485
00:31:17,587 --> 00:31:19,202
Are you sure you're all right?

486
00:31:19,327 --> 00:31:22,132
I'm fine. Both me and Dreamy.

487
00:31:25,797 --> 00:31:29,912
I'm going to try and be a much better dad.

488
00:31:31,736 --> 00:31:34,112
You can't just be a good dad.

489
00:31:34,807 --> 00:31:36,712
You also have to be a good grandfather.

490
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:38,081
What?

491
00:31:42,016 --> 00:31:45,761
Aren't you a bit too laid back? The elections are coming up.

492
00:31:46,317 --> 00:31:49,387
I just had a press conference saying that I had put on a show.

493
00:31:49,387 --> 00:31:51,392
I can't start showing my face again right away.

494
00:31:52,256 --> 00:31:56,501
Then think of today as a break and get some rest.

495
00:31:56,627 --> 00:31:59,771
You're going to shorten your lifespan, Dad.

496
00:32:01,426 --> 00:32:02,741
Yes, ma'am!

497
00:32:05,037 --> 00:32:07,142
It's the payment we promised,

498
00:32:07,837 --> 00:32:10,652
and you will just have to call the reporter on this card.

499
00:32:13,706 --> 00:32:16,991
I just have to say that Wi Dae Han gave me 30 grand to keep me quiet...

500
00:32:17,117 --> 00:32:20,162
and kept me away from the kids, right?

501
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:23,857
You also have to say who Da Jung's real father is,

502
00:32:23,857 --> 00:32:26,862
and what kind of crime he committed.

503
00:32:30,426 --> 00:32:32,041
Understood.

504
00:32:33,067 --> 00:32:35,341
We'll give you the rest after the elections.

00:32:52,347 --> 00:32:54,116
I'm number four.

508
00:32:54,117 --> 00:32:55,755
- Goodness! - Hello, sir.

509
00:32:55,756 --> 00:32:56,756
Yes, number four.

510
00:32:56,756 --> 00:32:58,862
Number four, sir.

511
00:32:59,387 --> 00:33:01,726
How have you been, ma'am?

512
00:33:01,726 --> 00:33:03,297
How could you even do that?

513
00:33:03,297 --> 00:33:05,567
No matter how much you wanted to get rid of that Reprobate Son nickname,

514
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:08,771
you shouldn't have dared to use those kids!

515
00:33:10,897 --> 00:33:13,236
I feel very ashamed, ma'am.

516
00:33:13,236 --> 00:33:16,307
Please go to the polling station on election day,

517
00:33:16,307 --> 00:33:18,037
and punish me with your vote.

518
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:22,647
There are times in life when you make clouded judgments.

519
00:33:22,647 --> 00:33:25,387
The kids needed a guardian back then,

520
00:33:25,387 --> 00:33:29,186
and now, they're closer than ever! Isn't that right?

521
00:33:29,186 --> 00:33:31,256
- Of course! - That's right!

522
00:33:31,256 --> 00:33:32,857
I'll work hard, ma'am.

523
00:33:32,857 --> 00:33:34,127
- Sure you will. - Please give me a chance.

524
00:33:34,127 --> 00:33:35,426

- Kang Joon Ho! - Kang Joon Ho!

528
00:33:44,337 --> 00:33:45,436
How are you doing?

529
00:33:45,436 --> 00:33:48,511
It's exhausting since it's my first time. You?

530
00:33:48,907 --> 00:33:50,712
Not much different.

531
00:33:51,276 --> 00:33:53,351
- Good luck. - Sure.

532
00:33:53,446 --> 00:33:54,622
See you.

Thanks.

If you're so thankful, vote for number three.

536
00:34:06,157 --> 00:34:07,962
I'm not that thankful.

537
00:34:10,296 --> 00:34:11,402
Bye, then.

00:34:12,367 --> 00:34:13,367

00:34:21,437 --> 00:34:23,052
- Wi Dae Han! - Wi Dae Han!

543
00:34:23,637 --> 00:34:24,982
How are the poll results?

544
00:34:25,106 --> 00:34:28,146
Wi Dae Han's rating dropped after the press conference yesterday,

545
00:34:28,146 --> 00:34:30,121
so we're taking the lead by four percent, sir.

546
00:34:31,347 --> 00:34:35,362
I guess today's interview will be the critical hit.

547
00:34:36,057 --> 00:34:37,232
(Vacant)

548
00:34:42,126 --> 00:34:44,001
Let's go to cvN Broadcasting Station, please.

549
00:34:45,626 --> 00:34:48,442
Who do you think will win? Wi Dae Han or Kang Joon Ho?

550
00:34:48,736 --> 00:34:51,572
I have no idea. I can't guess at all.

551
00:34:51,637 --> 00:34:53,437
Who are you going to vote for, then?

552
00:34:53,437 --> 00:34:55,137
It's a secret ballot!

553
00:34:55,137 --> 00:34:58,276
But it's too obvious you're going for Wi Dae Han.

554
00:34:58,276 --> 00:34:59,751
Be quiet.

("Let's Go See the Stars")

556
00:35:05,017 --> 00:35:07,646
Soo Hyun, why do you look so surprised?

557
00:35:07,646 --> 00:35:09,992
It's nothing. You guys go ahead.

558
00:35:12,856 --> 00:35:15,426
Sir! Hello.

559
00:35:15,426 --> 00:35:16,902
Oh, hello.

560
00:35:17,296 --> 00:35:22,001
What are you doing here at the station?

561
00:35:22,558 --> 00:35:25,803
I'm supposed to meet someone here.

562
00:35:26,307 --> 00:35:28,282
Excuse me, but I'm in a rush.

563
00:35:33,376 --> 00:35:36,418
("Straight Trip")

564
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:43,770
The person you have reached is not available...

565
00:35:43,771 --> 00:35:45,016
He's not picking up.

566
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:48,346
What is he doing at the station?

567
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:55,056
And please, keep your promise...

568
00:35:55,635 --> 00:35:59,210
to take the secret about Da Jung's real dad to your grave.

569
00:36:05,756 --> 00:36:09,061
No. That won't be it.

570
00:36:09,185 --> 00:36:10,630
It can't be.

571
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:13,256
Hello, everyone.

572
00:36:13,256 --> 00:36:15,840
We will now begin "cvN News" with our guest.

573
00:36:15,866 --> 00:36:18,066
We will now begin the interview with Han Dong Nam,

574
00:36:18,066 --> 00:36:19,141
- Dae Han! - who has offered...

575
00:36:19,165 --> 00:36:21,035
- Hey! It can't be. - to do an interview about...

576
00:36:21,035 --> 00:36:22,035
- Look. - Candidate Wi Dae Han,

577
00:36:22,035 --> 00:36:24,035
who has become a hot issue after yesterday's press conference.

578
00:36:24,035 --> 00:36:25,906
- Hello. - Hello.

579
00:36:25,906 --> 00:36:30,220
I'm sure you had to make a big decision to come all the way here.

580
00:36:30,375 --> 00:36:33,220
Yes, well... It wasn't exactly a big decision.

581
00:36:33,845 --> 00:36:35,886
The elections are coming up,

582
00:36:35,886 --> 00:36:38,645
so I wanted to be able to help voters...

583
00:36:38,645 --> 00:36:41,785
make a wiser decision by coming here.

584
00:36:41,785 --> 00:36:44,601
Is that your work?

585
00:36:44,656 --> 00:36:46,170
What are you talking about?

586
00:36:46,495 --> 00:36:48,431
I had nothing to do with it.

587
00:36:49,026 --> 00:36:50,495
Let's see what he has to say.

588
00:36:50,495 --> 00:36:54,435
Jungang-gu, Inju City is the hottest district of this year's elections.

589
00:36:54,435 --> 00:36:58,874
Yes. And Mr. Wi Dae Han is running there,

590
00:36:58,875 --> 00:37:01,650
and he held a press conference yesterday. But...

591
00:37:02,645 --> 00:37:05,645
I thought the people should know one thing...

592
00:37:05,645 --> 00:37:07,650
about Wi Dae Han.

593
00:37:09,886 --> 00:37:14,030
What is he trying to say? He's making me nervous.

594
00:37:18,856 --> 00:37:21,170
The kids Wi Dae Han took in...

595
00:37:21,856 --> 00:37:23,371
are all my kids,

596
00:37:23,796 --> 00:37:25,670
except for the oldest one.

597
00:37:25,696 --> 00:37:30,610
So they are complete strangers to Wi Dae Han.

598
00:37:31,066 --> 00:37:33,475
Did anything bad happen to the kids...

599
00:37:33,475 --> 00:37:36,251
while they were with Mr. Wi?

600
00:37:48,216 --> 00:37:51,130
No. Not at all.

601
00:37:51,685 --> 00:37:55,840
He was so nice to them that the kids like him more than me.

602
00:37:55,995 --> 00:37:58,570
That's how bad Mr. Wi is.

603
00:37:59,165 --> 00:38:03,311
How could he make them like him more than their biological dad?

604
00:38:03,705 --> 00:38:05,135
What was that?

605
00:38:05,136 --> 00:38:08,406
Aren't you here to reveal the truth?

606
00:38:08,406 --> 00:38:12,121
Did it have anything to do with Da Jung's biological father?

607
00:38:12,276 --> 00:38:13,820
Da Jung's biological father?

608
00:38:22,285 --> 00:38:25,630
What I heard from Da Jung's mother is...

609
00:38:29,526 --> 00:38:32,271
that the father died before Da Jung was born.

610
00:38:34,566 --> 00:38:36,181
But why is that important?

611
00:38:37,066 --> 00:38:39,550
Da Jung has a great dad by her side right now.

612
00:38:45,616 --> 00:38:46,920
He said the right thing for the first time in a while.

613
00:38:47,816 --> 00:38:51,191
I see. I guess this would conclude our interview today.

614
00:38:51,446 --> 00:38:54,731
Excuse me. But I haven't made my point yet.

615
00:38:54,986 --> 00:38:56,161
Your main point?

616
00:38:56,225 --> 00:38:58,860
Sure. You can state it briefly.

617
00:39:01,625 --> 00:39:04,601
The truth I want to reveal here today...

618
00:39:06,136 --> 00:39:08,736
is that the Party Leader of the Nationalist Party,

619
00:39:08,736 --> 00:39:10,110
Kang Kyung Hoon, bribed me with money...

620
00:39:10,535 --> 00:39:13,110
to slander Wi Dae Han.

621
00:39:15,205 --> 00:39:16,380

Thank you for watching.

625
00:39:32,426 --> 00:39:33,670
I told you.

626
00:39:34,225 --> 00:39:35,800
The things you do for me,

627
00:39:37,366 --> 00:39:38,771
are only hurtful to me.

628
00:39:38,966 --> 00:39:41,670
You don't believe me...

629
00:39:43,006 --> 00:39:44,705
and choose to believe that dirtbag?

630
00:39:44,705 --> 00:39:46,211
No matter who I believe,

631
00:39:48,136 --> 00:39:49,481
the truth doesn't change.

634
00:40:08,555 --> 00:40:09,740
Mr. Han.

635
00:40:12,966 --> 00:40:16,740
I am truly grateful for your courage to speak up.

636
00:40:17,705 --> 00:40:19,610
You don't have to thank me.

637
00:40:20,205 --> 00:40:24,050
Mr. Han, what made you appear on the news?

638
00:40:24,546 --> 00:40:27,521
Kang Kyung Hoon ordered me to appear on the news...

639
00:40:27,875 --> 00:40:29,691
and slander Da Jung's father.

640
00:40:31,185 --> 00:40:33,630
But you said exactly the opposite on the news.

641
00:40:35,616 --> 00:40:37,486
He pestered me so much,

642
00:40:37,486 --> 00:40:39,970
coming all the way to Chuncheon.

643
00:40:41,196 --> 00:40:44,340
He told me something about being a proud father.

644
00:40:46,935 --> 00:40:50,641
Is that why you went to Chuncheon without telling your aide?

645
00:40:53,336 --> 00:40:55,081
Mr. Han,

646
00:40:55,676 --> 00:40:59,021
what did you do with the money that you got from Kang Kyung Hoon?

647
00:40:59,616 --> 00:41:01,851
I used about 1,000 dollars.

648
00:41:02,785 --> 00:41:05,161
I'll go to the Prosecutor's Office with the rest tomorrow.

649
00:41:07,886 --> 00:41:10,825
You should get going. I am sure Da Jung is waiting.

650
00:41:10,825 --> 00:41:13,225
I'll drop you off at Chuncheon.

651
00:41:13,225 --> 00:41:15,400
No, no. I prefer the express bus.

652
00:41:15,555 --> 00:41:18,900
You must be really tired. You should let Dae Han drive.

653
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:20,541
Yes, you should.

654
00:41:22,035 --> 00:41:24,610
I just did the coolest thing in my life.

655
00:41:25,805 --> 00:41:27,880
Let me enjoy it alone on my way home.

656
00:41:33,446 --> 00:41:37,121
Dad, you were amazing today.

657
00:41:37,486 --> 00:41:41,831
Come on. Talking in front of cameras is not that big a deal.

658
00:41:43,185 --> 00:41:44,461
When are you coming home?

659
00:41:45,725 --> 00:41:50,570
If I leave now, it'll take a little over two hours.

660
00:41:51,026 --> 00:41:52,170
I'll wait for you.

661
00:41:52,366 --> 00:41:55,570
We should have tuna ramen. I'll cook it this time.

662
00:41:55,736 --> 00:41:58,041
Tuna ramen sounds good.

663
00:41:59,606 --> 00:42:01,681

I can't believe that fool would do stab me in the back.

666
00:42:14,915 --> 00:42:18,231
I guess I am no better than a toothless tiger.

667
00:42:18,825 --> 00:42:20,325
I will spread articles on how Han Dong Nam...

668
00:42:20,325 --> 00:42:22,101
is a corrupt detective and a gambling addict.

669
00:42:22,926 --> 00:42:26,070
I'll make sure what he said on TV loses its credibility.

670
00:42:32,975 --> 00:42:34,550
I'm sorry to tell you this...

671
00:42:36,805 --> 00:42:38,351
but I think it's over.

672
00:42:44,345 --> 00:42:46,461
"It's not over until it's over."

673
00:42:49,825 --> 00:42:51,300
Doesn't this mean that the result can change...

674
00:42:52,185 --> 00:42:54,570
if we try hard until the end?

675
00:42:56,426 --> 00:42:57,541
You are right.

676
00:42:58,866 --> 00:43:00,010
Why?

677
00:43:00,895 --> 00:43:02,470
I think of it differently.

even if it's clear that you will lose the game...

681
00:43:11,546 --> 00:43:14,220
is the polite thing to do for the fans that came to the game.

682
00:43:24,926 --> 00:43:28,170
I am not big enough to be polite...

683
00:43:29,026 --> 00:43:30,941
in a losing battle.

684
00:43:32,466 --> 00:43:33,970

can understand the lives of ordinary people?

- He is right. - He wouldn't understand.

- Just get down. - Why is he up there?

00:45:19,736 --> 00:45:20,880
Kang Joon Ho.

718
00:45:21,435 --> 00:45:23,351
Since our junior year in high school,

719
00:45:24,506 --> 00:45:26,351
we have been competing for 20 years.

720
00:45:27,745 --> 00:45:30,791
20 years? We do have a special history.

721
00:45:33,486 --> 00:45:35,291
Aren't you tired of fighting me?

722
00:45:36,955 --> 00:45:38,130
What do you mean?

723
00:45:38,886 --> 00:45:40,470
I am tired of it.

724
00:45:41,856 --> 00:45:43,300
I am sure the people are too.

725
00:45:43,595 --> 00:45:46,570
The National Assembly fights 365 days a year.

726
00:45:47,196 --> 00:45:48,340
So...

727
00:45:49,736 --> 00:45:52,010
why don't we do something else other than fighting?

728
00:45:55,075 --> 00:45:58,150
- Wi Dae Han! - Kang Joon Ho!

729
00:45:58,406 --> 00:46:01,550
- Wi Dae Han! - Kang Joon Ho!

730
00:46:01,745 --> 00:46:04,185
(Vote 3 Kang Joon Ho)

731
00:46:04,185 --> 00:46:06,331
(Vote 4 Wi Dae Han)

732
00:46:10,386 --> 00:46:11,601
People...

733
00:46:12,856 --> 00:46:16,300
satirically named wealthy people as "silver spoons,"

734
00:46:17,165 --> 00:46:19,740
because they have gained their wealth...

735
00:46:20,035 --> 00:46:21,911
in an unfair manner,

736
00:46:22,665 --> 00:46:24,541
and use that wealth to abuse their power.

737
00:46:26,205 --> 00:46:27,351
My...

738
00:46:29,705 --> 00:46:30,780
father...

739
00:46:31,906 --> 00:46:33,391
was not fair.

740
00:46:34,845 --> 00:46:36,990
He used his power...

741
00:46:37,616 --> 00:46:39,391
and exploited it unfairly.

742
00:46:41,055 --> 00:46:42,760
And Wi Dae Han here...

743
00:46:43,785 --> 00:46:46,231
is one of the victims.

744
00:46:47,296 --> 00:46:48,530
Using this opportunity,

745
00:46:49,495 --> 00:46:50,871
on behalf of my father,

746
00:46:54,095 --> 00:46:55,240
I would like to apologize...

747
00:46:56,336 --> 00:46:58,541
to Mr. Wi.

748
00:47:16,055 --> 00:47:17,200
I am Wi Dae Han.

749
00:47:21,455 --> 00:47:23,340
This is who Kang Joon Ho is.

750
00:47:23,696 --> 00:47:25,670
He is very gentle and principled.

751
00:47:25,725 --> 00:47:29,541
Strangely enough, he is nothing like his father.

752
00:47:32,665 --> 00:47:34,380
I lost the last election...

753
00:47:34,906 --> 00:47:38,280
because I was labeled as a reprobate son...

754
00:47:39,345 --> 00:47:41,150
due to an issue related to my father.

755
00:47:41,915 --> 00:47:45,490
When I experienced it first-hand, it was really hard.

756
00:47:47,716 --> 00:47:49,661
I hope that Kang Joon Ho here...

757
00:47:50,955 --> 00:47:53,030
doesn't have to go through that.

758
00:47:54,256 --> 00:47:56,800
We decided to stand here together because...

759
00:47:57,796 --> 00:48:00,871
we won't follow the footsteps of politicians who fight all day.

760
00:48:01,296 --> 00:48:04,141
We agreed that we will show the people...

761
00:48:04,805 --> 00:48:06,776
how we will talk and think together,

762
00:48:06,776 --> 00:48:09,920
and move forward together.

763
00:48:10,745 --> 00:48:13,590
- That sounds great! - That is awesome.

764
00:48:13,845 --> 00:48:15,345
I am not sure who will be elected...

765
00:48:15,345 --> 00:48:17,490
from the election in two days.

766
00:48:17,946 --> 00:48:19,731
But no matter who gets elected,

767
00:48:20,216 --> 00:48:23,001
we will work together in politics,

768
00:48:23,756 --> 00:48:26,530
as friends and colleagues.

769
00:48:26,756 --> 00:48:28,130
Thank you!

770
00:48:30,265 --> 00:48:34,136
- Wi Dae Han! - Kang Joon Ho!

771
00:48:34,136 --> 00:48:37,610
- Wi Dae Han! - Kang Joon Ho!

772
00:48:38,106 --> 00:48:40,610
How long do you think they will last?

773
00:48:41,106 --> 00:48:42,780
Not long, sir.

774
00:48:42,946 --> 00:48:46,351
When they start working, they're bound to change.

775
00:48:48,015 --> 00:48:50,545
Every politician I saw did.

776
00:48:50,546 --> 00:48:52,285
- Wi Dae Han! - Kang Joon Ho!

777
00:48:52,285 --> 00:48:53,490
But who knows?

778
00:48:53,886 --> 00:48:55,356
They may be different.

779
00:48:55,356 --> 00:48:58,725
- Kang Joon Ho! - Wi Dae Han!

780
00:48:58,725 --> 00:48:59,725
Kang Joon Ho!

781
00:48:59,725 --> 00:49:03,765
A father shouldn't get in the way of his child.

782
00:49:03,765 --> 00:49:05,895
- Wi Dae Han! - Kang Joon Ho!

783
00:49:05,895 --> 00:49:07,041
Let's go.

784
00:49:07,136 --> 00:49:10,205
- Wi Dae Han! - Kang Joon Ho!

785
00:49:10,205 --> 00:49:11,866
Wi Dae Han!

786
00:49:11,866 --> 00:49:15,006
Kang Kyung Hoon of the Nationalist Party, who is suspected...

787
00:49:15,006 --> 00:49:18,820
of intentionally spreading false rumors, admitted to the charges.

788
00:49:19,006 --> 00:49:22,391
I made a big mistake out of misguided paternal love...

789
00:49:23,716 --> 00:49:25,920
and concern for my son.

790
00:49:26,856 --> 00:49:29,161
From this moment on,

791
00:49:30,185 --> 00:49:32,331
I shall resign from my post as the leader of the Nationalist Party,

792
00:49:32,955 --> 00:49:34,900
my seat in the assembly...

793
00:49:34,995 --> 00:49:37,371
and all public service...

794
00:49:37,566 --> 00:49:39,400
and retire from politics.

795
00:49:39,836 --> 00:49:41,541
- What did he say? - He's retiring?

796
00:49:43,165 --> 00:49:47,911
Candidate Kang Joon Ho did not know anything about my actions.

797
00:49:48,736 --> 00:49:52,280
I would like to plead to the voters.

798
00:49:53,145 --> 00:49:55,275
Please judge Candidate Kang Joon Ho,

799
00:49:55,276 --> 00:49:59,320
not as this foolish father's son,

800
00:49:59,955 --> 00:50:02,061
but Kang Joon Ho himself...

801
00:50:03,526 --> 00:50:05,200
during the upcoming elections.

802
00:50:06,055 --> 00:50:10,625
(General Election Day)

803
00:50:10,625 --> 00:50:12,271
(21st Assembly Election, Polling Station, Jungang-gu, Inju City)

804
00:50:12,825 --> 00:50:13,911
(Assembly Election)

805
00:50:29,075 --> 00:50:30,515
(Wi Dae Han)

806
00:50:30,515 --> 00:50:31,515
(Kang Joon Ho)

807
00:50:31,515 --> 00:50:32,590
(Wi Dae Han)

808
00:50:33,156 --> 00:50:34,231
(Polling Station)

809
00:50:47,736 --> 00:50:50,610
I went to see my parents at the charnel house after voting.

810
00:50:51,535 --> 00:50:52,566
(Late Wi Jae Sung, Late Kang Eun Sook)

811
00:50:52,566 --> 00:50:54,010
And I prayed...

812
00:50:54,935 --> 00:50:56,720
that the people...

813
00:50:57,106 --> 00:51:01,015
would make a wise and great decision.

814
00:51:01,015 --> 00:51:02,276
(Late Wi Jae Sung, Late Kang Eun Sook)

815
00:51:02,276 --> 00:51:04,360
Choose 2020!

816
00:51:04,446 --> 00:51:09,061
We will now begin the vote count for the 21st General Elections.

817
00:51:09,926 --> 00:51:11,630
(Choose 2020 General Elections)

818
00:51:12,776 --> 00:51:15,650
(6 months later)

819
00:51:17,010 --> 00:51:19,110
Even Jinju City is trying to benchmark...

820
00:51:19,110 --> 00:51:21,110
the Woods Mall and Inju Market's Agreement for Joint Benefit.

821
00:51:21,110 --> 00:51:23,224
I'm so proud.

822
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:26,820
But Jinju City only invited you and Dad.

823
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:28,665
Are you sure we can all go?

824
00:51:28,820 --> 00:51:32,189
It won't hurt to strike the iron while it's hot.

825
00:51:32,189 --> 00:51:35,364
It will be nice to go on a family trip.

826
00:51:37,179 --> 00:51:39,084
Dad, I'll show you Sun.

827
00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:41,549
- Look over there. - Sun, look over here.

828
00:51:41,549 --> 00:51:42,549
Sun, look over here.

829
00:51:42,549 --> 00:51:43,850
Are you going to look over there?

830
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:48,420
Gosh, Sun! You're getting bigger each day!

831
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:49,805
How cute.

832
00:51:50,390 --> 00:51:51,830
How's Vietnam?

833
00:51:51,830 --> 00:51:54,675
It's nice. The work is all right too.

834
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:59,920
Daddy, earn lots of money and come back to Korea.

835
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:02,519
Okay, I'll earn lots of money and go back,

836
00:52:02,519 --> 00:52:05,765
so don't fight with Song Yi and be good, okay?

837
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:08,734
And you need to lose some weight. Don't eat too much!

838
00:52:10,159 --> 00:52:14,004
Don't worry. I'll watch over Tae Poong.

839
00:52:14,099 --> 00:52:16,869
Hello, sir. How are you?

840
00:52:16,869 --> 00:52:19,214
I'm good.

841
00:52:19,309 --> 00:52:23,585
I'm so sorry I had to leave the kids with you again.

842
00:52:23,710 --> 00:52:26,309
Don't mention it. It's nice and busy.

843
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:27,685
Take care.

844
00:52:34,389 --> 00:52:35,524
It's all right.

845
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:42,904
I wonder why you had to take this car...

846
00:52:43,159 --> 00:52:45,535
instead of Mr. Jung's?

847
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:49,774
I think it's because she wanted to go with Dad.

848
00:52:50,499 --> 00:52:51,999
No, it's not.

849
00:52:51,999 --> 00:52:56,855
I wanted my mom and dad to feel like they're going on a trip alone.

850
00:52:57,710 --> 00:52:59,455
Sure.

851
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:03,550
What do you say we make Dae Han and Soo Hyun...

852
00:53:03,550 --> 00:53:05,649
have the wedding next spring?

853
00:53:05,650 --> 00:53:07,189
- Next spring? - Yes.

854
00:53:07,190 --> 00:53:08,650
What's the rush?

855
00:53:08,650 --> 00:53:11,964
Why put it off? They're not getting any younger.

856
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:13,789
But to be honest...

857
00:53:13,789 --> 00:53:15,159
Stop that!

858
00:53:15,159 --> 00:53:17,099
I meant the weather is nice!

859
00:53:17,099 --> 00:53:20,004
The weather is amazing.

860
00:53:20,470 --> 00:53:24,145
It feels nice to go with you too.

861
00:53:24,340 --> 00:53:25,970
Whatever.

862
00:53:25,970 --> 00:53:27,844
Focus on driving.

863
00:53:28,610 --> 00:53:31,114
Yes, ma'am. I will focus on...

864
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:35,995
That's cool. Where'd you get that?

865
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:42,024
The sun is so strong. My eyes hurt.

866
00:53:42,889 --> 00:53:44,335
Gosh, that hurts.

867
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:46,464
It's so hard to drive.

868
00:53:49,090 --> 00:53:51,935
You just won't leave me alone, will you?

869
00:53:52,530 --> 00:53:53,844
Take it!

870
00:53:54,099 --> 00:53:56,440
No, I wasn't asking for that.

871
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:57,699
Hurry up and take it.

872
00:53:57,699 --> 00:54:00,114
What? I wasn't... Thank you.

873
00:54:01,110 --> 00:54:03,185
Gosh, that feels much better.

874
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:05,254
(Jinju Central Market)

875
00:54:16,590 --> 00:54:19,289
This is the Silk Road Youth Mall,

876
00:54:19,289 --> 00:54:21,389
which is run by the youth.

877
00:54:21,389 --> 00:54:24,860
You did a great job with it, sir.

878
00:54:24,860 --> 00:54:26,499
It's so vibrant.

879
00:54:26,499 --> 00:54:29,499
The cafés are pretty and there is a variety of food,

880
00:54:29,499 --> 00:54:32,099
so it's very popular among the people.

881
00:54:32,099 --> 00:54:33,539
It's really nice.

882
00:54:33,539 --> 00:54:37,010
The age of merchants in traditional markets is varied these days,

883
00:54:37,010 --> 00:54:39,710
and it has to be a place of unique experience...

884
00:54:39,710 --> 00:54:41,909
instead of merely selling items.

885
00:54:41,909 --> 00:54:44,119
- Sure. - Yes, you're right.

886
00:54:44,119 --> 00:54:46,420
The event is tomorrow,

887
00:54:46,420 --> 00:54:49,490
so just think of today as a tour and look around.

888
00:54:49,490 --> 00:54:51,795
- Yes, sir. - Everyone should...

889
00:54:53,389 --> 00:54:54,765
Where did everyone go?

890
00:54:54,789 --> 00:54:56,099
Well...

891
00:54:56,099 --> 00:54:58,800
They all got so excited, so they're looking around.

892
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:00,900
- Let's go, then. - Sure.

893
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:02,274
Go on.

894
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:03,545
Are you hungry?

895
00:55:06,110 --> 00:55:07,415
(Welcome)

896
00:55:09,269 --> 00:55:10,455
Tae Poong.

897
00:55:11,809 --> 00:55:13,725
Tak!

898
00:55:15,110 --> 00:55:16,650
Come on.

899
00:55:16,650 --> 00:55:19,119
Tae Poong!

900
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:20,424
Enjoy.

901
00:55:23,260 --> 00:55:25,435
Do you like this? Do you want to try it?

902
00:55:25,789 --> 00:55:27,630
She doesn't like it.

903
00:55:27,630 --> 00:55:28,935
How about this?

904
00:55:35,470 --> 00:55:36,774
Here.

905
00:55:37,269 --> 00:55:38,674
This way.

906
00:55:42,409 --> 00:55:43,409
Like this.

907
00:55:43,409 --> 00:55:46,625
There. It's done.

908
00:55:46,749 --> 00:55:48,110
It's finished.

909
00:55:48,110 --> 00:55:49,594
Let's clap!

910
00:55:50,479 --> 00:55:52,795
"The Great Family".

911
00:55:53,249 --> 00:55:55,464
Looks great.

912
00:55:58,320 --> 00:55:59,395
It's good.

913
00:56:00,590 --> 00:56:03,174
It's a good thing we came.

914
00:56:03,199 --> 00:56:06,300
It feels so good to be out here. I can feel my stress going away.

915
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:08,304
- Right? - I know.

916
00:56:08,329 --> 00:56:10,774
We're having such a good time thanks to Dae Han and Dad.

917
00:56:12,099 --> 00:56:13,409
Did you like it too, Tae Poong?

918
00:56:13,409 --> 00:56:15,085
I liked it!

919
00:56:15,309 --> 00:56:16,539
It was fun.

920
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:18,178
Was it fun?

921
00:56:18,179 --> 00:56:20,710
I'm so happy everyone liked it.

922
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:24,380
What do you think about going to Vietnam for Sun's first birthday?

923
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:25,880
We can visit Tak's dad.

924
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:27,190
Sounds good.

925
00:56:27,190 --> 00:56:29,888
Then let's all go to Canada next summer.

926
00:56:29,889 --> 00:56:31,118
To see my parents.

927
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:32,658
Gosh, Canada?

928
00:56:32,659 --> 00:56:36,375
We're going to be taking so many trips abroad thanks to you all!

929
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:40,074
Soo Hyun's never been abroad.

930
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:45,844
Really? You've never been abroad?

931
00:56:46,869 --> 00:56:48,285
Yes.

932
00:56:48,470 --> 00:56:51,955
I couldn't even ride the elevator. How would I ride a plane?

933
00:56:54,979 --> 00:56:56,194
I see.

934
00:56:56,349 --> 00:56:58,619
Then we really should go.

935
00:56:58,619 --> 00:57:00,249
Let's ride a plane together.

936
00:57:00,249 --> 00:57:04,634
Let's do that. While we're at it, you two can go to Hawaii.

937
00:57:04,990 --> 00:57:07,590
What? Why would we go to Hawaii?

938
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:11,574
People say it's a good place for honeymoons.

939
00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:14,504
What? Then...

940
00:57:15,369 --> 00:57:17,114
Sir, do you mean...

941
00:57:18,139 --> 00:57:19,639
If you make Soo Hyun cry tears,

942
00:57:19,639 --> 00:57:22,085
I'll make you cry blood.

943
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:24,815
Of course. Thank you, sir.

944
00:57:25,510 --> 00:57:28,510
I won't let her lift a finger, let alone make her cry.

945
00:57:28,510 --> 00:57:30,795
- Okay. - Calm down, everyone.

946
00:57:31,349 --> 00:57:34,324
Who says I'm getting married? I don't want to get married.

947
00:57:35,190 --> 00:57:36,265
Really?

948
00:57:39,090 --> 00:57:40,205
Not yet.

949
00:57:41,429 --> 00:57:42,535
Not yet.

950
00:57:51,139 --> 00:57:53,844
This is the floating lantern studio.

951
00:57:54,039 --> 00:57:55,869
I see. From what I saw online,

952
00:57:55,869 --> 00:57:57,710
we can write a wish on the lantern...

953
00:57:57,710 --> 00:57:58,979
and send it down the river.

954
00:57:58,979 --> 00:58:00,308
That's right.

955
00:58:00,309 --> 00:58:02,379
The floating lantern festival is going on right now,

956
00:58:02,380 --> 00:58:04,355
so write down your wishes.

957
00:58:04,619 --> 00:58:05,754
- Really? - Okay.

958
00:58:06,389 --> 00:58:08,690
We came just in time.

959
00:58:08,690 --> 00:58:10,094
You sure did.

960
00:58:46,889 --> 00:58:47,964
Mr. Ko?

961
00:58:48,590 --> 00:58:49,699
Yes, Mr. Assemblyman?

962
00:58:49,699 --> 00:58:53,304
(National Assembly)

963
00:58:53,429 --> 00:58:55,545
Is this everything the Ministry of Education sent?

964
00:58:56,369 --> 00:58:57,538
Yes.

965
00:58:57,539 --> 00:58:59,940
They're so mean because we don't belong...

966
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:01,645
to a party.

967
00:59:03,679 --> 00:59:05,114
Even inspecting government offices...

968
00:59:05,210 --> 00:59:07,185
is hard because we're not with a party.

969
00:59:08,479 --> 00:59:10,295
How was it when you were Dae Han's aide?

970
00:59:11,979 --> 00:59:15,190
Usually, the Assemblymen of the same party...

971
00:59:15,190 --> 00:59:17,295
come up with a joint plan and work together,

972
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:20,804
but you know Assemblyman Wi. He likes to fight solo.

973
00:59:22,590 --> 00:59:24,774
I guess it was just as hard back then.

974
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:28,274
I was always cursed out by the aides of Assemblymen...

975
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:30,815
from the same party.

976
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:33,815
I like it much better now.

977
00:59:35,710 --> 00:59:36,884
He won't pick up?

978
00:59:37,479 --> 00:59:38,815
Try again.

979
00:59:38,909 --> 00:59:40,554
Hello.

980
00:59:41,550 --> 00:59:43,654
- Hello. - Hello.

981
00:59:45,550 --> 00:59:48,565
So? When will Dae Han get here?

982
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:51,565
He says he should be here half an hour before we go live.

983
00:59:52,090 --> 00:59:54,265
Not that he will be, but he "should" be?

984
00:59:54,530 --> 00:59:56,190
How many times did this punk do this already?

985
00:59:56,190 --> 00:59:58,274
It's probably the third time since we formed the new panel.

986
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:00,745
He's totally dissing us.

987
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:02,444
Be patient.

988
01:00:02,570 --> 01:00:04,614
You know he's the "it" guy right now.

989
01:00:04,900 --> 01:00:07,269
She's right. If you count radio shows,

990
01:00:07,269 --> 01:00:10,754
he's a regular member on over 10 shows.

991
01:00:10,809 --> 01:00:13,280
I don't care if it's 10 or 20. He should show up on time.

992
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:14,679
This is a live broadcast.

993
01:00:14,679 --> 01:00:17,054
Oh dear. I'm sorry.

994
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:19,024
I'm sorry.

995
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:21,424
The streets are like parking lots.

996
01:00:21,550 --> 01:00:24,659
I'll take the subway from now on. I'm sorry.

997
01:00:24,659 --> 01:00:25,765
Forget it.

998
01:00:26,059 --> 01:00:28,659
Did you slack off on preparing for the show because you're busy?

999
01:00:28,659 --> 01:00:30,929
I wouldn't slack off no matter how busy I am.

1000
01:00:30,929 --> 01:00:33,199
"Debate" is what made me who I am today.

1001
01:00:33,199 --> 01:00:35,145
- Get ready. - Okay.

1002
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:37,274
I'm sorry.

1003
01:00:39,269 --> 01:00:40,785
I'm sorry.

1004
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:44,455
I'm sorry.

1005
01:00:44,579 --> 01:00:48,254
Will you skip the National Assembly and go straight into the Blue House?

1006
01:00:49,210 --> 01:00:50,395
The Blue House?

1007
01:00:50,449 --> 01:00:53,194
They took a survey for the favorite future presidential candidate,

1008
01:00:54,190 --> 01:00:55,964
and you came in second. Second.

1009
01:00:56,190 --> 01:01:00,130
I told them over and over not to include me in the survey,

1010
01:01:00,130 --> 01:01:01,364
but they wouldn't listen.

1011
01:01:01,789 --> 01:01:04,174
That's just fleeting interest.

1012
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:07,804
I know. Watch him come in second in the presidential election too.

1013
01:01:08,030 --> 01:01:09,274
My gosh.

1014
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:13,844
I'm not interested in the presidential election.

1015
01:01:14,139 --> 01:01:16,010
Let's get started. I have to get to my next program.

1016
01:01:16,010 --> 01:01:17,355
Please finish quickly.

1017
01:01:17,679 --> 01:01:18,740
- Let's start. - Okay.

1018
01:01:18,740 --> 01:01:21,079
- Let's get to work. Let's shoot. - Okay.

1019
01:01:21,079 --> 01:01:22,355
- Good luck. - Thanks.

1020
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:23,754
Okay, then.

1021
01:01:31,389 --> 01:01:34,004
Dae Han, aren't you sad?

1022
01:01:34,530 --> 01:01:35,634
About what?

1023
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:38,574
About losing the election.

1024
01:01:39,729 --> 01:01:41,904
And you lost only by 190 votes too.

1025
01:01:45,139 --> 01:01:47,185
But I gained the love of the people.

1026
01:01:47,740 --> 01:01:49,645
Plus, Joon Ho's doing well.

1027
01:01:53,449 --> 01:01:55,884
I never knew you were so magnanimous.

1028
01:01:56,749 --> 01:01:58,024
This is nothing.

1029
01:01:59,420 --> 01:02:02,824
You'll constantly be shocked as you spend more time with me.

1030
01:02:02,990 --> 01:02:04,065
What?

1031
01:02:07,030 --> 01:02:09,705
What wish did you write on your floating lantern?

1032
01:02:11,329 --> 01:02:12,435
Well...

1033
01:02:13,229 --> 01:02:17,300
Just... For the health and happiness of our family.

1034
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:19,015
Things like that.

1035
01:02:40,059 --> 01:02:43,504
I wish Daddy would return soon from Vietnam.

1036
01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:48,574
Let me eat beef every day.

1037
01:02:51,369 --> 01:02:52,844
Let me grow just 5cm more.

1038
01:02:55,110 --> 01:02:57,154
Let me be a good husband and dad.

1039
01:02:58,139 --> 01:02:59,754
And let my song top the charts.

1040
01:03:02,309 --> 01:03:05,524
Let's all be healthy and happy as we are now.

1041
01:03:06,490 --> 01:03:10,194
I hope to join "The Great Family" by next spring.

1042
01:03:12,019 --> 01:03:13,964
I know I can do well now.

1043
01:03:14,389 --> 01:03:16,165
Please send me back to the National Assembly.

1044
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:17,904
If that's too hard,

1045
01:03:18,099 --> 01:03:19,804
I'm fine with going straight to the Blue House.

1046
01:03:40,119 --> 01:03:41,395
If that's too hard,

1047
01:03:41,650 --> 01:03:43,295
I'm fine with going straight to the Blue House.

1048
01:03:45,389 --> 01:03:46,904
Wherever I am, whatever my position,

1049
01:03:47,990 --> 01:03:51,535
I want to provide power to the powerless.

1050
01:03:58,539 --> 01:04:00,740
Okay. Here we go.

1051
01:04:00,740 --> 01:04:02,714
Get closer.

1052
01:04:03,210 --> 01:04:06,979
- Look here. Okay. Smile. - Okay.

1053
01:04:06,979 --> 01:04:08,984
1, 2, 3.

1054
01:04:13,050 --> 01:04:15,225
One more. Good.

1055
01:04:19,619 --> 01:04:22,134
I'll take one more.

1056
01:04:22,190 --> 01:04:24,375
1, 2, 3.

1057
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:46,795
(The Great Show)

1058
01:05:20,449 --> 01:05:24,395
(Thank you for watching The Great Show)
