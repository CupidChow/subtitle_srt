have any other ideas?

the projected location

is not even a 15-minute walking
distance from Inju Market.

327
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,300
However, will this only
be of disservice?

00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,520
What do you mean by that?

329
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,330
Aigoo, of course, it's a disservice.

There's a convenient
shopping mall nearby.

331
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:43,250
Why would they come
to the market?

332
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:46,020
You said the shopping
mall is convenient.

333
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:48,540
What if the market customers

334
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:51,950
can also utilize
Woo's Mall's facilities?

335
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:53,310
How would that be?

336
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,250
If we can share the parking
structure, it'll be helpful.

337
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:01,750
That's true.

338
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:05,480

inconvenient for the customers.

We can run a shuttle bus between

341
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:17,260
If you show a receipt from either
of the retailers to each other,

342
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:19,670
we can have that merit for a

343

5% discount or such.

344
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:25,330
Woo's Mall and Inju Market will
become a combined shopping mecca.

For a synergy effect,
don't you think?

346
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,920
In truth, there are

approve, either.

00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,180
<i>We're not doing that.</i>

358
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,780
Hello.

359
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:10,870
Mayor, what brings you by...

360
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:12,930
Aigoo, you're all here.

361
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:15,380
I hope I'm not interrupting
your meeting.

362
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:17,380
No, you're not interrupting.

363
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:19,110
Your timing is perfect.

364
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:20,780
We came up with

365
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:24,530
a proposal for Inju Market
and Woo's Mall to co-exist.

366
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:26,440
Please take a look, Mayor Jung.

367
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,500
Okay.

368
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:36,350
Our Attorney Kang
even researched

369
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:39,670
cases from overseas to
create this proposal.

370
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:43,030
In accordance with this,
both the shopping malls and the

371
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:45,060
traditional markets will
be successful.

372
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:47,350
It's truly a win-win.

373
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:55,260
Is it not good?

374
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:58,000
Oh, my...

375
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,740
It's a great effort but to no avail.

376
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:04,540
- What on earth...
- To no avail?

377
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:05,890
But why?

378
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:08,360
Woo's Group just called.

379
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:13,060
They'll concede the land
overlapping into the 1km radius.

380
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,520
<i>- What did he say?</i><b>- No, no, please wait.</b>

381
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:21,570
What will happen if
they concede the land?

382
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:24,700
If they utilize only outside
of the 1km radius,

383
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:28,800
they won't need your consent
to bring in Woo's Mall.

384
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,580
- What?<b><i>- No way!</i></b>

385
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:36,570
Even so, shouldn't they agree on
terms with the market retailers?

386
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:38,830
We can make the suggestion,

387
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:40,590
but it has no legal merit.

388
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:42,560
Forget legal merit!

389
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:45,830
You're not willing to exercise
your authority, Mayor.

390
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:51,390
<i>- This is nonsense!</i><b>- This is tough for me, too.</b>

391
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:54,700
The City Hall is bombarded
with residents' petitions.

392
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:57,750
They want approval
on the Woo's Mall project!

393
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:00,760
Mayor Jung, your words
are too harsh.

394
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,290
Then...

395
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:03,970
the market retailers...

396
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:06,260
We're not citizens nor residents?

397
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,180
In these instances,

398
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:10,580
you should be
listening to all sides

399
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:13,280
and be the mediator!

400
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:19,290
Listen.

401
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:21,710
What else can I do here?

402
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:25,310
I tried to stop this
with the rental apartments,

403
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:28,080
and even arranged
a negotiation meeting.

404
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,100
But you're the ones who bolted!

405
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:32,890
So, who made them bolt?

406
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:38,020
It's because of you and me.

407
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:42,430
Mayor Jung. No...

408
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:44,290
Hyungnim.

409
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:46,800
I'm not a model politician either,

410
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,300
but please...

411
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:52,090
let's not become monsters, okay?

412
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,370
What did you say?

413
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,140
If you're finished, please leave.

414
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:04,900
We must discuss
an urgent strategy.

415
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:14,430
That punk, I've been
easy on him.

416
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:16,520
Now, he's getting out of control.

417
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:19,110
- Ko Bong Joo.
- Yes?

418
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:20,840
Whose side are you on?

419
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:23,140
Me or Wie Dae Han?

420
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:25,780
I'm on your side, of course.

421
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:27,770
You sign my paycheck.

422
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:41,780
<i>How did Mayor Jung
know the resident votes</i>

423
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:44,070
<i>would get thrown out?</i>

424
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,730
<i>No need to worry.</i>

425
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:58,120
<i>He needs to reduce his sentence,
so he won't be betraying us.</i>

426
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,420
<i>What's the public saying?</i>

427
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:02,170
<i>The public opinion regarding
the rental apartments</i>

428
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:04,880
<i>has completely flipped.</i>

429
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:11,860
[ Father's staged attack ]

430
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:21,250
Joon Ho oppa has
dropped out of the party?

431
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:22,930
Yes.

432
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:26,930
I know I'm to be his "pacemaker."

433
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:29,410
Rome wasn't built in a day.

434
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:30,480
Of course.

435
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,530
If you rush it, it'll be ruined.

436
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:37,220
However, please make
me a priority for...

437
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:39,380
the next general election.

438
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:42,630
Joon Ho should be more like you.

439
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:44,950
Oppa has his own strong points.

440
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:47,540
We need idealistic politicians, too.

441
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:53,310
What brings you by so late? Huh?

442
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:55,550
I didn't think you'd
ever come home.

443
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:57,910
I have something to say, Father.

444
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,300
The three of us running
in the same district...

445
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,590
People will love it.

446
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:17,920
Just what is Woo's Mall planning?

447
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,930
How should I know?

448
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:21,830
Then let me change the question.

449
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:24,450
Why did you team up
with Mayor Jung?

450
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:29,360
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

451
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,150
Mayor Jung held resident
voting for the apartments,

452
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:34,670
and you staged your own attack.

453
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:36,870
You two make a great team.

454
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:37,860
What?

455
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:39,580
Did you purchase some land

456
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:41,920
near the site under
a borrowed name?

457
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,180
All right.

458
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:46,640
Let's say your words are correct.

459
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,500
Countless people in our nation
use the government

460
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,780
for their investment purposes.

461
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:53,880
Is that something to
be criticized for?

462
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,880
Your attitude upsets me
even more, Father.

463
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,750
You're so shameless.

464
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:01,650
Conducting politics with
no sense of decency?

465
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:04,210
If all parents maintained
their grace

466
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:06,290
and their sense of decency,

467
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:09,730
many children will
be starving to death.

468
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:13,610
Everything you've had
since you were born...

469
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:17,150
They were all due to
my shameless acts.

470
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:19,150
Aren't you embarrassed
about that?

471
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:21,050
Yes, I'm ashamed
and embarrassed...

472
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,190
- That's why I left home.
- But nevertheless,

473
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:27,850
everyone will see you
as a "silver spoon,"

474
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:30,200
and you'll still be
Kang Kyung Hoon's son.

475
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,170
In the upcoming general election,

476
00:27:32,170 --> 00:27:33,950
forget Wie Dae Han.

477
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:35,790
You couldn't even defeat Hye Jin.

478
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:38,620
If I were you, I'd feel
humiliated about that.

479
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:41,030
I'll show you how I win...

480
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:44,810
without any shame.

481
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:57,910
When you were fresh
out of college,

482
00:27:57,910 --> 00:27:59,930
I made you my aide.

483
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:02,930
Plus I fully supported
your assemblyman

484
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:04,830
campaign bid as
a young candidate.

485
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:06,460
Wow...

486
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:08,740
Yet you knife me in the back?

487
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:10,400
That knife...

488
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,850
is the one you stabbed me with.

489
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:14,790
What are you talking about?

490
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:17,330
I know you're in cohorts
with Kang Kyung Hoon.

491
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:22,610
We're both pros here.
Let's not whine.

492
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:25,460
Let's be cool and go
our separate ways.

493
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,980
If you wanted to look cool...

494
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:43,430
you shouldn't have
accepted dirty money.

495
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,770
Geez...

496
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:47,230
I knew it, yup.

497
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:50,560
You're right.

498
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,940
It was so dirty that I
couldn't accept it.

499
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:55,140
Director Lee will be
notified tomorrow.

500
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:57,770
I donated it under his
name to an orphanage.

501
00:28:57,770 --> 00:28:59,350
Every single penny.

502
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,960
Say hi to
Assemblyman Kang for me.

503
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:08,870
Come inside.

504
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:15,010
Yes, Mayor.

505
00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:17,600
Don't bother coming in anymore.

506
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,000
Pardon?

507
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,860
Why all of a sudden...

508
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:21,920
You.

509
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:25,460
You must've planned
this out with Dae Han.

510
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:28,000
- Hyungnim.
- This guy...

511
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,620
You got him fired, not me.

512
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:32,170
Wow...

513
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:34,500
Why are you taking it
out on him?

514
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,350
He's supposed to be my aide,

515
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:38,230
but he's your little helper!

516
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:40,830
Because you're not doing
your job as a mayor!

517
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:43,020
- What did you say?
- Please stop!

518
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:55,950
I was planning on
resigning anyway.

519
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:57,930
I must pick the right
team, correct?

520
00:29:57,930 --> 00:30:00,150
I can't stay on the rotten team.

521
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:16,380
Man...

522
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:19,660
I still have two more years
for my savings to mature.

523
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:22,660
Why did I pick the
wrong team, huh?

524
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:24,060
Seriously...

525
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:27,070
Cut it out. You're
rambling on and on...

526
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:29,020
Just wait a few months, punk.

527
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:30,260
Hey.

528
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:32,960
If I get elected, who will
accompany me?

529
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,360
It's you, of course.

530
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:37,190
You hear? You're my first
pick, my first choice.

531
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:38,210
Okay?

532
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:41,600
You're out of connections
and won't get a nomination...

533
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,100
How will you be elected, huh?

534
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:47,330
I'll probably get elected
before you. Me, okay?

535

of negotiating from the get-go.

565

that 10% of the land
for another purpose.

567
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:38,350
So I looked into the prison
site's land situation.

an active bid for that 10%.

00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:29,970
And? Did the story air?

715
00:41:29,970 --> 00:41:31,030
No.

716
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:33,810
Perhaps the higher-ups
prevented the broadcast?

717
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:37,420
Gosh, I suspect that, too.

718
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:39,920
I'll go see the former writer
of that program.

719
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,280
I'll look into it.

720
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,500
My friend is an assistant
writer there.

721
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,810
<i>Sunbae.</i>

722
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:46,600
<i>The main writer at the time.</i>

723
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:49,510
<i>She's no longer a writer.
She's into rock climbing.</i>

724
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:57,920
It was your father who
gave us the story then?

725
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,260
Do you remember?

726
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:01,460
Of course, I do.

727
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:03,560
That's why I left the station.

728
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:07,650
We should've aired it, but the
higher-ups pressured us.

729
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:11,440
Man, I caved in. Like a coward.

730
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,750
Ms.

731
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:14,780
They should be the
ones ashamed.

732
00:42:16,370 --> 00:42:17,480
You're right.

733
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:19,710
Were you able to cover the story?

734
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:20,820
Yes, we did.

735
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:23,950
We even met with the whistle blower
from Taehoon Elevators.

736
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:25,530
What did he say?

737
00:42:25,530 --> 00:42:27,350
To reduce costs,

738
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:30,620
they used wire ropes which didn't
meet the safety regulations.

739
00:42:39,010 --> 00:42:41,410
You're doing good, right?

740
00:42:41,410 --> 00:42:45,150
Yeouido isn't a happy
place for most.

741
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:47,730
I keep tabs on you, Assemblyman Wie.

742
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:50,240
- Aigoo, really...
- You're amazing.

743
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:53,200
I'm having a hard time
raising one kid.

744
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,870
And you have four?

745
00:42:54,870 --> 00:42:56,300
It's like a horror movie.

746
00:42:57,330 --> 00:42:58,620
It's not "horror."

747
00:42:58,620 --> 00:42:59,960
It's "human" if anything.

748
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:01,420
It's also patriotism.

749
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:03,570
- Yes.
- You're so fun and witty.

750
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:08,510
You should be elected an assemblyman,
so our party can rejoice.

751
00:43:08,510 --> 00:43:11,640
This is why I need your
help, Aide Ki. Huh?

752
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:13,710
I don't have much clout, aigoo...

753
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,040
How can I be of service?

754
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,550
The word on the street

755
00:43:18,550 --> 00:43:21,780
is that you're the expert in
all of Yeouido's happenings.

756
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:24,340
I guess that's a validated fact.

757
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,890
So I was wondering...

758
00:43:28,890 --> 00:43:29,970
Well...

759
00:43:29,970 --> 00:43:32,860
you know Hojik Construction, right?

760
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:35,610
Anything interesting there?

761
00:43:38,010 --> 00:43:39,570
No.

762
00:43:39,570 --> 00:43:42,080
The first I've heard of them.

763
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,900
I see.

764
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,790
- You're a horrible actor.
- Aigoo...

765
00:43:51,790 --> 00:43:54,380
It's obvious you know
something, right?

766
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:56,430
- Well...
- You can tell me.

767
00:43:56,430 --> 00:43:58,500
I said, I don't know.

768
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:00,250
Ha Yoon! Let's go home.

769
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:01,340
Mr. Ki...

770
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,580
What happened with
the whistle blower?

771
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:08,050
I can't reach him.

772
00:44:08,050 --> 00:44:10,040
He emigrated to Australia
five years ago.

773
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:11,980
And you?

774
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:16,330
I met with an aide who's
an information highway,

775
00:44:16,330 --> 00:44:18,180
but he won't budge.

776
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:21,410
He knows something
about Hojik Construction,

777
00:44:21,410 --> 00:44:22,910
but he's keeping mum.

778
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:26,450
We've both hit a dead end.

779
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:29,750
Perhaps we're just not enough...

780
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:31,610
Jung Soo Hyun.

781
00:44:31,610 --> 00:44:33,820
A dead end won't stop us.

782
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:35,710
Let's look for another way.

783
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,140
Assemblyman, it's Wie Dae Han.

784
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:49,740
How have you been?

785
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,350
So-so.

786
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:55,530
Why don't you have a seat?

787
00:44:56,380 --> 00:44:57,280
Yes, sir.

788
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:04,670
You're digging up on
Hojik Construction?

789
00:45:05,590 --> 00:45:07,110
Yes.

790
00:45:07,110 --> 00:45:09,690
I'm sensitive to smell,

791
00:45:09,690 --> 00:45:11,960
and something's fishy over there.

792
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:15,750
How will you conduct politics
with such a weak stomach?

793
00:45:17,970 --> 00:45:21,090
You said this when
I first came to Yeouido.

794
00:45:21,090 --> 00:45:24,200
"When torn between theory
and righteousness,

795
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:26,590
take the path of righteousness."

796
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:37,270
Hojik Construction.

797
00:45:37,270 --> 00:45:42,090
They say it has lobbied the entire
government regardless of party affiliation.

798
00:45:42,090 --> 00:45:43,950
One false move,

799
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:47,210
and it'll look as if you're
targeting our party.

800
00:45:48,430 --> 00:45:51,140
I was already labeled a rogue.

801
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:53,460
But this is a different ball game.

802
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:55,330
Forget being nominated.

803
00:45:55,330 --> 00:45:56,940
You may...

804
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:59,880
never set foot in our party again.

805
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:04,380
I must withstand all risks
in order to forge ahead.

806
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:08,150
Assemblyman, you
dreamed of a revolution.

807
00:46:08,150 --> 00:46:10,950
To revolutionize, we must
defeat Chairman Baek.

808
00:46:10,950 --> 00:46:12,440
I'll aid your cause.

809
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:14,360
So please help me as well.

810
00:46:21,910 --> 00:46:24,110
Hojik Construction's
finance director is

811
00:46:24,110 --> 00:46:26,620
CEO Kim Tae Hoon's
childhood friend.

812
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:30,360
Aside from that, he also
managed the slush funds.

813
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:32,110
Work from that angle.

814
00:46:33,530 --> 00:46:36,510
Where can I go see this man?

815
00:46:37,470 --> 00:46:38,850
<i>The penitentiary.</i>

816
00:46:38,850 --> 00:46:42,590
<i>He was recently charged with
negligence and embezzlement.</i>

817
00:46:47,450 --> 00:46:49,230
Political lobbying?

818
00:46:49,230 --> 00:46:50,960
It's news to me.

819
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:54,030
We know you're serving time...

820
00:46:54,030 --> 00:46:55,590
on behalf of CEO Kim.

821
00:46:56,810 --> 00:46:59,600
You overestimate me.

822
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:05,500
Your daughter has
an illness and the...

823
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:08,780
- medical bills are...
- I'll get going then.

824
00:47:10,470 --> 00:47:12,270
14 years ago.

825
00:47:12,270 --> 00:47:15,730
Taehoon's elevator malfunctioned,
causing an accident.

826
00:47:15,730 --> 00:47:17,750
You remember, right?

827
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:19,410
My younger sister...

828
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:22,480
died in that accident.

829
00:47:25,850 --> 00:47:28,620
The scariest and...

830
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:30,770
the most unbearable thing...

831
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:36,310
is losing a loved one.

832
00:47:39,650 --> 00:47:42,020
But do you know...

833
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:45,880
what brings you down more?

834
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:52,870
The guilt that your loved one

835
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:57,850
died because of me.

836
00:47:57,850 --> 00:47:59,980
<i>Come on, do it for me.</i>

837
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:01,670
<i>Today is the last day for a refund.</i>

838
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:03,410
<i>Why should I? It's not my clothes.</i>

839
00:48:03,410 --> 00:48:05,790
<i>Hey, must you be like this?</i>

840
00:48:08,870 --> 00:48:11,340
10 years is a very long time.

841
00:48:13,850 --> 00:48:15,730
But even after 14 years...

842
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:21,120
I couldn't get rid of the guilt.

843
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:26,960
The misfortune my sister
and I experienced...

844
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:30,040
It should never happen again.

845
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:32,690
Please expose the truth.

846
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:36,380
I humbly ask of you.

847
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:47,150
Visiting hours are over.

848
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:05,460
Are you okay?

849
00:49:06,450 --> 00:49:08,280
Of course, I'm okay.

850
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:10,750
This isn't the time to lapse
into my emotions.

851
00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:13,080
I must find a way to
get him to talk.

852
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:16,580
You're right.

853
00:49:16,580 --> 00:49:18,530
We must find a way.

854
00:49:18,530 --> 00:49:21,470
His friendship with
CEO Kim spans 40 years.

855
00:49:21,470 --> 00:49:24,090
He won't be persuaded
by our words.

856
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:27,830
Of course not.

857
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:30,990
Wait a minute.

858
00:49:30,990 --> 00:49:34,130
What if we make them
turn on each other...

859
00:49:34,130 --> 00:49:36,620
That's not as easy as it sounds.

860
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:39,340
Seeing by the looks
of him, he won't budge.

861
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:40,900
Yes, I know.

862
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:43,550
We must target Hojik
Construction's CEO Kim Tae Hoon.

863
00:49:47,470 --> 00:49:49,640
Whoa, good shot.

864
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:50,950
Wow.

865
00:49:52,730 --> 00:49:54,170
And who are you?

866
00:49:54,170 --> 00:49:56,460
Oh, you don't know me?

867
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:59,380
I'm Wie Dae Han, the youngest
and the 19th assemblyman.

868
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:02,060
- I'm "The Nation's Dad."
- I see.

869
00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:04,310
"The Nation's Dad."

870
00:50:05,450 --> 00:50:07,000
And?

871
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,690
Do we have matters to address?

872
00:50:08,690 --> 00:50:09,880
Actually...

873
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:12,160
I do have matters to address, yes.

874
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:13,960
As you know,

875
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:16,710
from your exclusive rights
to the prison site,

876
00:50:16,710 --> 00:50:19,880
to the elevator accident
14 years ago.

877
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:22,010
It seems we go way back, CEO.

878
00:50:22,010 --> 00:50:25,680
If you'll talk nonsense,
go home to your kids.

879
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:27,340
You're "The Nation's Dad."

880
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:33,360
Director Jo told me
many interesting things.

881
00:50:36,350 --> 00:50:37,930
Enjoy playing golf for now.

882
00:50:37,930 --> 00:50:39,880
You may have to go
where you can't.

883
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:41,150
Good shot!

884
00:50:41,150 --> 00:50:43,470
Okay, keep up the good work.

885
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,450
He's feeling you out.

886
00:50:51,450 --> 00:50:54,180
That punk is good at BS'ing.

887
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:56,150
I think so, too, but...

888
00:50:56,150 --> 00:50:57,870
it's wearing on my nerves.

889
00:50:57,870 --> 00:50:59,900
<i>If Director Jo opens his mouth,</i>

890
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:01,700
it'll be a headache for all.

891
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:05,600
Perhaps you should take an
extra measure of security.

892
00:51:07,590 --> 00:51:09,210
Sounds like a plan.

893
00:51:10,510 --> 00:51:13,040
<i>Mrs. Jo, we're begging you.</i>

894
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:16,830
Many market retailers' livelihood
is in Director Jo's hands.

895
00:51:16,830 --> 00:51:18,810
I don't know anything about it.

896
00:51:18,810 --> 00:51:20,060
Please leave.

897
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:24,000
Director Jo taking the fall for someone,
and partaking in corruption...

898
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,730
Your daughter wouldn't want that.

899
00:51:25,730 --> 00:51:26,890
Please...

900
00:51:26,890 --> 00:51:28,460
I said, please leave.

901
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:29,940
Please!

902
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:32,440
- Mrs. Jo...
- Sunbae.

903
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:34,050
Let's just go.

904
00:51:35,150 --> 00:51:36,540
Our apologies.

905
00:51:36,540 --> 00:51:38,540
Things must be hard as is.

906
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:40,680
No need for an apology.

907
00:51:41,690 --> 00:51:43,460
Why are you out here?

908
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:46,010
Mom.

909
00:51:46,010 --> 00:51:48,140
These people are right.

910
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:51,270
You and Dad being
unhappy because of me...

911
00:51:51,270 --> 00:51:53,260
I can't stand it anymore.

912
00:51:54,580 --> 00:51:55,860
That's...

913
00:51:55,860 --> 00:51:59,180
more painful for me
than chemotherapy.

914
00:52:00,590 --> 00:52:03,080
Mom, please tell Dad.

915
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:06,330
That I want my good-old-dad back.

916
00:52:06,330 --> 00:52:08,000
Then...

917
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:13,390
it'll encourage me to continue
with my treatments.

918
00:52:28,170 --> 00:52:29,110
Hey.

919
00:52:29,110 --> 00:52:31,390
Did Wie Dae Han pay you a visit?

920
00:52:31,390 --> 00:52:32,580
Why?

921
00:52:32,580 --> 00:52:34,510
You think I'd say something?

922
00:52:34,510 --> 00:52:37,660
No way, you wouldn't do that.

923
00:52:38,820 --> 00:52:41,330
I'm here because I missed you.

924
00:52:41,330 --> 00:52:42,950
Don't worry.

925
00:52:42,950 --> 00:52:45,190
You know how loyal I am.

926
00:52:45,190 --> 00:52:46,370
I know.

927
00:52:46,370 --> 00:52:47,890
I do, but...

928
00:52:47,890 --> 00:52:51,900
you know I have a hard
time trusting people.

929
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:55,060
Plus, you're too kind-hearted.

930
00:52:56,180 --> 00:52:57,880
What do you mean by that?

931
00:52:57,910 --> 00:52:59,680
'I mean...

932
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:01,970
don't do anything stupid.

933
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:04,260
Just think about your daughter.

934
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:06,420
Hospital bills are pretty hefty.

935
00:53:07,570 --> 00:53:09,370
Are you...

936
00:53:09,370 --> 00:53:11,380
threatening me?

937
00:53:11,380 --> 00:53:13,120
Oh, dear...

938
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:15,220
That's not a threat.

939
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:17,730
It's a realty check, that's all.

940
00:53:17,730 --> 00:53:20,330
For your daughter's hospital bills.

941
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:40,360
We should attend the funeral.

942
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:43,030
Our elevator accident
caused four deaths.

943
00:53:43,030 --> 00:53:44,670
If I attend,

944
00:53:44,670 --> 00:53:47,060
it'll look as if our company
is admitting guilt.

945
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:49,090
I'd be crazy to go there.

946
00:53:49,090 --> 00:53:50,330
But still.

947
00:53:50,330 --> 00:53:52,150
It's the right thing to do.

948
00:53:52,150 --> 00:53:55,370
You know, you're just
way too nice.

949
00:53:55,370 --> 00:53:57,830
Keep your mouth shut and
just manage the money.

950
00:53:57,830 --> 00:54:01,240
We have numerous
people to bribe.

951
00:54:04,850 --> 00:54:07,900
<i>The misfortune my sister
and I experienced...</i>

952
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:09,900
<i>It should never happen again.</i>

953
00:54:11,030 --> 00:54:13,120
<i>Please expose the truth.</i>

954
00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:20,620
It's over. The end.

955
00:54:20,620 --> 00:54:23,770
Mayor Jung signed off the
business license for Woo's Mall,

956
00:54:23,770 --> 00:54:25,570
and awaiting approval
from the city council.

957
00:54:29,950 --> 00:54:33,610
Do we have any legal
grounds to stop them here?

958
00:54:35,110 --> 00:54:38,490
Mayor Jung exercised his
authority as the mayor.

959
00:54:38,490 --> 00:54:40,510
Even an administrative litigation

960
00:54:40,510 --> 00:54:42,340
won't be able to stop this.

961
00:54:54,430 --> 00:54:56,180
Yes, this is Wie Dae Han.

962
00:54:56,180 --> 00:54:58,160
Hello.

963
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:01,310
Yes, Mrs. Jung. Hello.

964
00:55:01,310 --> 00:55:03,190
Well...

965
00:55:04,810 --> 00:55:07,350
my husband asked me
to give you something.

966
00:55:08,580 --> 00:55:09,810
I see.

967
00:55:09,810 --> 00:55:11,910
Yes, thank you.

968
00:55:11,910 --> 00:55:14,280
Thank you, I'll be right there.

969
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:15,500
Okay!

970
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:18,780
Who was that?
You look so happy.

971
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:22,030
We may have found a solution.

972
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:25,080
<i>- What? 
- What solution?</i>

973
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:25,980
Yes.

974
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:29,760
Director Jo's wife gave it to me.

975
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:32,320
This contains the slush
fund details?

976
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:33,350
Yes.

977
00:55:33,350 --> 00:55:35,360
Starting with Taehoon
Elevators and up to now.

978
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:37,540
It's the black-box of corruption.

979
00:55:37,540 --> 00:55:40,470
You'll turn this over to the
Prosecutors' Office, right?

980
00:55:42,290 --> 00:55:43,510
I should.

981
00:55:43,510 --> 00:55:44,670
But...

982
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:47,990
I need to see someone first.

983
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:53,440
What brings you by
my neighborhood?

984
00:55:55,610 --> 00:55:58,190
I received a present.

985
00:55:58,190 --> 00:55:59,910
What present?

986
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:12,780
The record of all recipients
of Kim Tae Hoon's bribery...

987
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:14,570
is in there.

988
00:56:15,770 --> 00:56:17,510
You had your share, too.

989
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:20,790
200 million won in cash

990
00:56:20,790 --> 00:56:23,370
and a residential and
commercial penthouse.

991
00:56:23,370 --> 00:56:25,330
Under an alias, too.

992
00:56:29,950 --> 00:56:31,690
And?

993
00:56:31,690 --> 00:56:34,440
Did you come to watch me collapse?

994
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:35,970
No.

995
00:56:35,970 --> 00:56:38,200
I wanted to ask you.

996
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:41,060
How did you get to stoop so low?

997
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:45,840
You weren't this bad
when I was your aide.

998
00:56:54,770 --> 00:56:58,390
I was wedged between
those with more power.

999
00:56:58,390 --> 00:57:01,390
What else could I do to stay afloat?

1000
00:57:01,390 --> 00:57:03,810
I had to make compromises,

1001
00:57:03,810 --> 00:57:05,280
and mess me up.

1002
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:08,030
That's always the issue. Yes.

1003
00:57:08,030 --> 00:57:11,300
Compromise to a point
and justify your actions.

1004
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:18,270
When will you go to the
Prosecutors' Office?

1005
00:57:21,250 --> 00:57:23,340
What do you think I should do?

1006
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:26,970
You tell me, Hyungnim.

1007
00:57:26,970 --> 00:57:28,660
Huh?

1008
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:31,940
What should I do here?

1009
00:57:38,030 --> 00:57:40,380
- I got good distance.<b><i>- Yes, sir.</i></b>

1010
00:57:41,970 --> 00:57:44,980
All right, I'll finish it
off in one shot.

1011
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:49,970
What is this?

1012
00:57:49,970 --> 00:57:52,920
Aigoo, my apologies.

1013
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:54,050
Aigoo.

1014
00:57:54,050 --> 00:57:56,420
Wow, you're all here, huh?

1015
00:57:56,420 --> 00:57:57,650
I guess...

1016
00:57:57,650 --> 00:57:59,930
the four of you are close?

1017
00:57:59,930 --> 00:58:01,270
Look.

1018
00:58:01,270 --> 00:58:04,310
I always knew you
had no manners,

1019
00:58:04,310 --> 00:58:06,150
but isn't this crossing the line?

1020
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:07,060
Oh, my.

1021
00:58:07,060 --> 00:58:08,980
How did I cross the line?

1022
00:58:08,980 --> 00:58:10,450
You really don't know?

1023
00:58:10,450 --> 00:58:12,650
You barge in during
our golf session,

1024
00:58:12,650 --> 00:58:14,870
and don't even greet the
chairman properly!

1025
00:58:14,870 --> 00:58:16,130
Greet the...

1026
00:58:16,130 --> 00:58:18,410
Aigoo. Aigoo, my apologies.

1027
00:58:18,410 --> 00:58:21,170
What should I do?
Do a deep bow right here?

1028
00:58:21,170 --> 00:58:23,390
This punk, have you gone insane?

1029
00:58:23,390 --> 00:58:25,050
- Hey!
- Shut your mouth!

1030
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:26,680
Oh, okay.

1031
00:58:33,410 --> 00:58:35,070
So...

1032
00:58:35,070 --> 00:58:37,540
you're obviously not here to golf.

1033
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:39,230
What is it you want to say?

1034
00:58:39,230 --> 00:58:40,730
Yes.

1035
00:58:40,730 --> 00:58:43,110
As a member of the Jeonjin Party,

1036
00:58:43,110 --> 00:58:44,930
I should tell you this.

1037
00:58:44,930 --> 00:58:46,290
What is it?

1038
00:58:46,290 --> 00:58:49,360
I dropped off the USB containing
details of Hojik Construction's

1039
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:51,320
slush funds at the Prosecutors' Office.

1040
00:58:54,930 --> 00:58:58,020
Thanks for notifying me ahead.

1041
00:58:58,020 --> 00:59:01,960
I'll be sure to repay you the favor.

1042
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:17,130
Are you out of your mind?

1043
00:59:17,130 --> 00:59:19,020
You wait and see.

1044
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:22,440
What's this?

1045
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:23,900
Move it!

1046
00:59:27,270 --> 00:59:28,850
14 years ago.

1047
00:59:28,850 --> 00:59:32,240
You should remember the elevator
accident at Woo's Department Store.

1048
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:34,500
You were the prosecutor in charge.

1049
00:59:35,810 --> 00:59:37,280
That's nonsense.

1050
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:40,970
As per the slush fund log, CEO Kim
paid you handsomely then.

1051
00:59:40,970 --> 00:59:42,800
You should pay for your crime.

1052
00:59:49,470 --> 00:59:50,750
Chairman Baek!

1053
00:59:50,750 --> 00:59:53,680
<i>The Prosecutors' Office secured
evidence showcasing</i>

1054
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:57,980
<i>Hojik Construction's CEO Kim Tae Hoon
engaging in illegal political bribery.</i>

1055
00:59:57,980 --> 01:00:01,130

<i>Director Lee and Inju City
Mayor Jung Han Soo.</i>

1057

1060
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:16,000
<i>Mayor Jung Han Soo of Inju City

<i>Taehoon Elevators, the parent

01:00:35,620 --> 01:00:38,260

1097

gave it to us real good.

we can't let him slide.

1103

We must stab him in the
heart. Where it hurts.

1104

Why here all of a sudden?

1105

Woo's Mall, huh?

1110
01:03:01,420 --> 01:03:02,630
Probably.
