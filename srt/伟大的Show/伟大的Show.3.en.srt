(All characters, organizations,
places, entities, and events...)

2
00:00:55,517 --> 00:00:56,823
(in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:01:07,846 --> 00:01:10,367
Who's causing a scene
in someone else's home?

4
00:01:12,006 --> 00:01:13,136
Who are you?

5
00:01:15,807 --> 00:01:19,517
Who are you to interrupt
a legal collection attempt?

6
00:01:20,017 --> 00:01:21,877
What about this is legal?

7
00:01:22,146 --> 00:01:25,286
Don't you know it's illegal
to collect a debt after 9pm?

8
00:01:25,716 --> 00:01:27,715
And an illegal collection
using threats, verbal assault...

9
00:01:27,716 --> 00:01:31,526
is punishable by 5 years in
prison or a fine up to 50,000 dollars.

10
00:01:32,487 --> 00:01:35,127
Da Jung. Bring the
others and come out.

11
00:01:36,326 --> 00:01:39,227
Why are you hiding? What did
you do wrong? This is your home!

12
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:40,737
Come out here!

13
00:01:42,237 --> 00:01:43,366
Da Jung!

14
00:01:53,017 --> 00:01:54,616
Come here. Hurry.

15
00:01:54,946 --> 00:01:56,517
Let's go.

16
00:02:00,086 --> 00:02:01,187
Are you okay?

17
00:02:02,517 --> 00:02:04,987
Will you walk out,
or get dragged out?

18
00:02:05,956 --> 00:02:09,396
Do you know their
dad by any chance?

19
00:02:09,726 --> 00:02:11,497
No, not at all.

20
00:02:12,327 --> 00:02:14,566
Then what's your
relationship with the kids?

21
00:02:15,566 --> 00:02:16,637
My relationship?

22
00:02:18,737 --> 00:02:19,976
I'm their dad.

23
00:02:26,277 --> 00:02:29,116
What? Are you saying
your birth father...

24
00:02:29,646 --> 00:02:32,616
that you came to
find is Dae Han?

25
00:02:33,756 --> 00:02:34,786
Yes.

26
00:02:37,527 --> 00:02:40,157
That piece of trash that shunned
you after seeing how you live...

27
00:02:40,556 --> 00:02:42,157
was Dae Han?

28
00:02:42,456 --> 00:02:44,296
I didn't shun them.

29
00:02:44,766 --> 00:02:46,367
I came to take care of them.

30
00:02:47,937 --> 00:02:50,707
I had no idea and was
a total idiot in the middle.

31
00:02:51,707 --> 00:02:52,836
I'm sorry.

32
00:02:52,837 --> 00:02:54,777
Why are you sorry?

33
00:02:55,136 --> 00:02:56,706
That shameless liar...

34
00:02:56,707 --> 00:02:58,147
should be sorry.

35
00:02:59,877 --> 00:03:02,816
I wouldn't be here
if I were shameless.

36
00:03:05,286 --> 00:03:06,856
Do you call that an excuse?

37
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:08,686
You're a monster.

38
00:03:08,687 --> 00:03:10,057
She's your child.
How could you...

39
00:03:10,326 --> 00:03:12,485
Especially someone who lost her
mom and is taking care of her siblings.

40
00:03:12,486 --> 00:03:14,057
How could you kick her out?

41
00:03:14,457 --> 00:03:17,726
That's why I'm here. To
be a decent human being.

42
00:03:18,497 --> 00:03:19,817
I'm going to take
in and raise...

43
00:03:20,796 --> 00:03:22,597
Da Jung and her siblings.

44
00:03:22,867 --> 00:03:24,036
Like we'd live with you.

45
00:03:37,747 --> 00:03:39,147
Bring your siblings.

46
00:03:39,516 --> 00:03:41,616
Let's live together from now on.

47
00:03:41,617 --> 00:03:43,427
Why did you suddenly
change your mind?

48
00:03:43,927 --> 00:03:45,967
Did you get the paternity
test result or something?

49
00:03:52,226 --> 00:03:53,266
Yes.

50
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:58,437
You got a paternity
test already?

51
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:00,707
Enough.

52
00:04:02,907 --> 00:04:05,006
Look. To be honest,

53
00:04:05,707 --> 00:04:07,907
I don't think I deserve to
be called your dad just yet.

54
00:04:13,617 --> 00:04:16,016
I'm going to try being
your legal guardian.

55
00:04:16,687 --> 00:04:18,327
I don't know how
well I'll do, but still.

56
00:04:18,927 --> 00:04:20,356
Thank you for today.

57
00:04:21,557 --> 00:04:23,397
It's late. You should go home.

58
00:04:23,897 --> 00:04:25,817
I'll talk to my siblings
about whether or not...

59
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:28,066
we'll move into your house.

60
00:04:28,497 --> 00:04:30,697
- What is there to discuss...
- You kicked us out once.

61
00:04:31,907 --> 00:04:33,476
What's to stop you
from doing it again?

62
00:04:49,826 --> 00:04:51,726
You can curse me out.

63
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:55,657
Just say something.

64
00:04:56,767 --> 00:04:58,527
This is suffocating.

65
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:01,796
That's why I'm not talking.

66
00:05:02,236 --> 00:05:03,666
So you can suffocate to death.

67
00:05:21,457 --> 00:05:24,126
Who wants to live with
Mr. Wi? Raise your hands.

68
00:05:27,796 --> 00:05:29,866
Tak. Why didn't
you raise your hand?

69
00:05:30,267 --> 00:05:32,697
- Because I don't want to.
- Why?

70
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,666
He's a tool.

71
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:37,736
Are you afraid he'll
kick us out again?

72
00:05:38,106 --> 00:05:39,535
Hey, don't be scared.

73
00:05:39,536 --> 00:05:41,476
Didn't you see me
beat him to the punch?

74
00:05:41,976 --> 00:05:44,375
He promised in
front of Soo Hyun,

75
00:05:44,376 --> 00:05:45,976
so he can't take it back.

76
00:05:46,676 --> 00:05:48,277
He's your dad, not mine.

77
00:05:52,317 --> 00:05:53,556
Aren't you my brother?

78
00:05:54,056 --> 00:05:56,087
If he's my dad,
he's your dad too.

79
00:05:57,626 --> 00:05:59,157
You move in with him.

80
00:05:59,527 --> 00:06:01,056
I'll live by myself.

81
00:06:04,767 --> 00:06:05,827
Hey!

82
00:06:07,337 --> 00:06:09,866
I'm the head of this family
since mom and dad are gone.

83
00:06:10,007 --> 00:06:11,105
Give me a break.

84
00:06:11,106 --> 00:06:12,666
Let's move in with Mr. Wi.

85
00:06:12,707 --> 00:06:14,606
Once we live together...

86
00:06:18,077 --> 00:06:19,577
This is so infuriating!

87
00:06:33,327 --> 00:06:36,055
Even if I am your
biological father,

88
00:06:36,056 --> 00:06:38,126
I'm not related at
all to your siblings.

89
00:06:38,327 --> 00:06:41,897
I have no duty to take
them in nor can I afford it.

90
00:06:54,277 --> 00:06:55,817
I did the right thing, right?

91
00:06:57,517 --> 00:06:59,517
For both me and for them.

92
00:07:01,457 --> 00:07:03,017
This is the best option.

93
00:07:06,327 --> 00:07:11,897
(Episode 3: The
Price of a Family)

94
00:07:19,007 --> 00:07:20,906
Isn't it too late to feed him?

95
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:23,577
He doesn't care about the time.

96
00:07:23,976 --> 00:07:26,507
He eats whenever you feed him.

97
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:30,716
The public is just
like him at times.

98
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:33,516
They take and take
whatever we give them.

99
00:07:33,517 --> 00:07:35,457
That's why populism
is so dangerous.

100
00:07:35,957 --> 00:07:38,887
Isn't it more dangerous
to think of people...

101
00:07:39,157 --> 00:07:40,426
as thoughtless animals?

102
00:07:41,897 --> 00:07:43,496
Yes, that's how
you should speak.

103
00:07:43,626 --> 00:07:45,426
That's what the people like.

104
00:07:48,496 --> 00:07:50,067
I've always wondered.

105
00:07:50,407 --> 00:07:52,637
Why are you in politics?

106
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:54,475
What's the point
of your question?

107
00:07:54,476 --> 00:07:56,976
The people, Mother, and me...

108
00:07:57,476 --> 00:08:00,276
Your going into politics
didn't make anyone happy.

109
00:08:00,277 --> 00:08:01,416
Happy.

110
00:08:02,777 --> 00:08:05,586
People yap about things like
that because they're not starving.

111
00:08:05,587 --> 00:08:07,686
It's because people like
me were good politicians...

112
00:08:07,717 --> 00:08:10,426
that this country
became full and warm.

113
00:08:14,426 --> 00:08:15,456
Is Mother home?

114
00:08:15,457 --> 00:08:16,696
No.

115
00:08:16,697 --> 00:08:19,866
I don't know where she
goes off to all the time.

116
00:08:20,436 --> 00:08:21,697
Since Mom's not here,

117
00:08:22,236 --> 00:08:24,806
how about a battle among men?

118
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:27,936
Sounds good.

119
00:08:28,876 --> 00:08:31,376
What do you plan to
do by taking the kids in?

120
00:08:31,976 --> 00:08:33,916
I'll milk the media.

121
00:08:34,116 --> 00:08:37,046
I'm becoming a dad by taking in
some kids who are practically orphans.

122
00:08:38,387 --> 00:08:40,416
The media will eat that up.

123
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:42,886
She isn't your real daughter.

124
00:08:42,887 --> 00:08:45,326
She's a stranger both
legally and biologically.

125
00:08:45,327 --> 00:08:46,356
People...

126
00:08:46,587 --> 00:08:49,197
will think it's weird
rather than heartwarming.

127
00:08:49,426 --> 00:08:51,597
That's a risk I must take.

128
00:08:52,397 --> 00:08:53,767
And you know...

129
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:57,105
I can't make it back until I
lose the reprobate image.

130
00:08:57,106 --> 00:08:58,466
Still, this isn't right.

131
00:08:58,467 --> 00:09:00,475
The kids' lives are at stake.

132
00:09:00,476 --> 00:09:02,176
I'm not doing this just for me.

133
00:09:02,907 --> 00:09:04,907
The kids need a legal guardian.

134
00:09:05,476 --> 00:09:08,177
What if their missing
dad comes back?

135
00:09:08,476 --> 00:09:10,115
Even better.

136
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:11,716
I would've cleaned up my image,

137
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:14,856
and I can naturally hand
over the kids to their dad.

138
00:09:17,156 --> 00:09:18,856
Must you go this far?

139
00:09:22,327 --> 00:09:24,266
I went on a designated
driving job today,

140
00:09:24,996 --> 00:09:26,596
and the client was Kang Joon Ho.

141
00:09:26,597 --> 00:09:28,365
What? For real?

142
00:09:28,366 --> 00:09:31,006
And I got into an accident
while driving his car.

143
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:37,906
This is much worse than
when that guy threw up on you.

144
00:09:38,177 --> 00:09:41,317
I probably would've died on
the spot from the humiliation.

145
00:09:42,177 --> 00:09:43,417
Why you...

146
00:09:46,047 --> 00:09:48,255
My pride was so
shot, it killed me,

147
00:09:48,256 --> 00:09:49,986
but Joon Ho said...

148
00:09:50,087 --> 00:09:52,057
I know I can do
it better than you.

149
00:09:52,486 --> 00:09:53,526
Politics.

150
00:09:54,597 --> 00:09:58,526
Well, that's true.
He'd probably do well.

151
00:09:59,496 --> 00:10:00,496
What was that?

152
00:10:00,497 --> 00:10:02,735
Then go be his aide, you punk.

153
00:10:02,736 --> 00:10:04,265
Do you want his number?

154
00:10:04,266 --> 00:10:07,736
No, no. We have a
different political outlook.

155
00:10:07,876 --> 00:10:08,976
So?

156
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:11,807
What do you mean, so?

157
00:10:12,746 --> 00:10:14,947
How could I not do
anything after hearing that?

158
00:10:15,646 --> 00:10:17,347
I'll teach him a lesson.

159
00:10:18,087 --> 00:10:19,516
I don't know about
anything else,

160
00:10:19,687 --> 00:10:22,557
but I refuse to let him
join the National Assembly.

161
00:10:27,457 --> 00:10:29,396
Something interesting
happened today.

162
00:10:31,597 --> 00:10:33,197
I called for a
designated driver,

163
00:10:33,797 --> 00:10:35,496
and Wi Dae Han showed up.

164
00:10:35,597 --> 00:10:36,697
Really?

165
00:10:37,006 --> 00:10:38,006
But...

166
00:10:38,606 --> 00:10:40,776
he said something strange.

167
00:10:42,376 --> 00:10:43,646
What did he say?

168
00:10:44,547 --> 00:10:45,847
When we were in high school,

169
00:10:46,106 --> 00:10:48,177
his mom's store was
almost kicked out...

170
00:10:51,287 --> 00:10:52,516
because of you.

171
00:10:57,886 --> 00:11:01,557
What lie couldn't a jerk who
abandoned his own dad say?

172
00:11:03,526 --> 00:11:05,766
There are many
like that in politics.

173
00:11:06,467 --> 00:11:09,496
Making up lies and spreading
them as if they're truths.

174
00:11:09,797 --> 00:11:12,707
It's wise to ignore
lies like that.

175
00:11:12,807 --> 00:11:14,807
You're correct, but...

176
00:11:16,736 --> 00:11:18,646
I couldn't ignore it.

177
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:24,646
I won't run for office.

178
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:28,256
What do you mean?

179
00:11:30,787 --> 00:11:32,087
I think...

180
00:11:34,597 --> 00:11:36,827
politics ruins people.

181
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:41,265
Fine.

182
00:11:41,266 --> 00:11:44,105
If you take the kids in
and milk the media right,

183
00:11:44,106 --> 00:11:46,235
you may succeed in
cleaning up your image.

184
00:11:46,236 --> 00:11:49,605
But how will you
afford to raise four kids?

185
00:11:49,606 --> 00:11:51,375
You have no savings.

186
00:11:51,376 --> 00:11:54,276
You have hundreds of
thousands of dollars in debt.

187
00:11:54,347 --> 00:11:57,547
Half of your house
is in a mortgage.

188
00:11:57,616 --> 00:11:59,587
I'll take on more debt then.

189
00:11:59,616 --> 00:12:02,485
Plus, that's not debt.
They're investments.

190
00:12:02,486 --> 00:12:04,087
Yes. Investments.

191
00:12:10,197 --> 00:12:12,126
Number 23.

192
00:12:12,626 --> 00:12:14,097
(Loan Window)

193
00:12:15,636 --> 00:12:17,406
You have a loan already
for 200,000 dollars.

194
00:12:17,807 --> 00:12:20,276
- Yes.
- You can't get another loan.

195
00:12:21,276 --> 00:12:22,436
I see.

196
00:12:22,437 --> 00:12:25,207
Can I get a credit loan then?

197
00:12:26,106 --> 00:12:27,446
What's your job?

198
00:12:27,447 --> 00:12:29,746
Well, the thing is...

199
00:12:31,347 --> 00:12:33,087
Don't you know me?

200
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:35,856
The youngest
Assemblyman, Wi Dae Han.

201
00:12:36,787 --> 00:12:38,226
Are you an Assemblyman?

202
00:12:38,587 --> 00:12:40,226
I...

203
00:12:40,697 --> 00:12:41,697
was.

204
00:12:42,427 --> 00:12:43,567
What about now?

205
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:46,266
I'm a former Assemblyman.

206
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:49,037
Don't you do anything else?

207
00:12:49,736 --> 00:12:51,605
Of course, I do.

208
00:12:51,606 --> 00:12:53,536
I give lectures here and there,

209
00:12:53,537 --> 00:12:56,506
and... I'm writing
a book right now.

210
00:12:56,707 --> 00:13:00,417
I also do designated
driving at night.

211
00:13:01,476 --> 00:13:03,646
So you don't have a stable job.

212
00:13:04,087 --> 00:13:05,347
A stable...

213
00:13:06,217 --> 00:13:10,156
I've been a designated driver
consistently for a year now.

214
00:13:12,687 --> 00:13:14,496
(Please enter your PIN)

215
00:13:14,697 --> 00:13:16,426
Processing.

216
00:13:16,427 --> 00:13:17,467
(Automated Teller Machine)

217
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,466
If you wish to continue...

218
00:13:23,467 --> 00:13:25,266
(Balance 2,487 dollars)

219
00:13:26,106 --> 00:13:28,177
Please choose

220
00:13:38,386 --> 00:13:39,787
(Brave Girl)

221
00:13:56,636 --> 00:13:57,837
Hey, you came.

222
00:13:59,006 --> 00:14:00,605
1, 2, 3.

223
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:02,235
- Hello.
- Hello.

224
00:14:02,236 --> 00:14:03,276
Hi.

225
00:14:05,276 --> 00:14:07,276
Why did you come so soon?

226
00:14:07,516 --> 00:14:09,316
Did you think hard about it?

227
00:14:09,317 --> 00:14:11,746
What if you change
your mind again?

228
00:14:13,516 --> 00:14:16,687
What do you take me for? Gosh.

229
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:19,457
Where's Tak?

230
00:14:20,496 --> 00:14:22,597
He'll come later.

231
00:14:22,726 --> 00:14:25,467
- Okay.
- What are the room arrangements?

232
00:14:26,697 --> 00:14:28,096
I don't know yet.

233
00:14:28,097 --> 00:14:30,037
I knew it.

234
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:32,807
So I've been thinking about it,

235
00:14:32,967 --> 00:14:35,906
and the four of us can use the
master bedroom and storage room,

236
00:14:36,606 --> 00:14:38,776
and you can use the study.

237
00:14:40,817 --> 00:14:43,016
Where will you
put all your things?

238
00:14:43,476 --> 00:14:45,616
The storage room was big.

239
00:14:45,717 --> 00:14:47,686
It'll all fit.

240
00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:50,756
You can help him
bring our things in.

241
00:14:50,986 --> 00:14:53,426
What? Aren't they
moving them in?

242
00:14:53,427 --> 00:14:54,797
Right?

243
00:14:54,957 --> 00:14:56,597
I have a bad back.

244
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:59,167
You're paying for this, right?

245
00:14:59,197 --> 00:15:00,337
What?

246
00:15:00,496 --> 00:15:01,766
Why would I...

247
00:15:04,106 --> 00:15:05,236
Gosh.

248
00:15:05,736 --> 00:15:07,475
Of course, I will.
How much is it?

249
00:15:07,476 --> 00:15:08,605
It's 430 dollars.

250
00:15:08,606 --> 00:15:10,745
What? Why is it so expensive?

251
00:15:10,746 --> 00:15:12,505
I moved them all the
way from Chuncheon.

252
00:15:12,506 --> 00:15:14,917
I'm giving you a discount
because of the kids.

253
00:15:17,687 --> 00:15:19,327
Can I transfer the
money to your account?

254
00:15:19,417 --> 00:15:21,986
Here. I'm busy.
I don't have time.

255
00:15:24,986 --> 00:15:26,886
(2,487 minus 430
equals 2,057 dollars)

256
00:15:27,097 --> 00:15:29,995
Okay. Are you ready to decorate
our room and make it pretty?

257
00:15:29,996 --> 00:15:31,167
- Yes!
- Yes!

258
00:15:31,467 --> 00:15:34,236
Let's go.

259
00:15:41,736 --> 00:15:43,206
Take this.

260
00:15:43,207 --> 00:15:44,506
And you take this.

261
00:15:47,317 --> 00:15:49,217
Hold on.

262
00:15:49,516 --> 00:15:50,516
Hold on.

263
00:15:58,986 --> 00:16:00,187
(Wi Dae Han)

264
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:01,797
Here.

265
00:16:28,687 --> 00:16:30,527
When am I going to
finish tidying all that up?

266
00:16:31,787 --> 00:16:34,496
We don't have to rush.
We'll be living here, anyway.

267
00:16:38,667 --> 00:16:40,736
What's that? A honey jar?

268
00:16:41,097 --> 00:16:42,297
It's my mom's urn.

269
00:16:43,136 --> 00:16:44,167
What?

270
00:16:44,707 --> 00:16:46,837
What... You...

271
00:16:48,276 --> 00:16:50,006
You kept this at home?

272
00:16:50,337 --> 00:16:53,306
Yes. We don't have the money
to place her at a charnel house,

273
00:16:53,307 --> 00:16:55,047
and the kids wanted
to be with her.

274
00:16:55,177 --> 00:16:56,677
But still...

275
00:16:57,486 --> 00:17:00,186
It will stand out too
much if you place it here.

276
00:17:00,187 --> 00:17:01,686
That's why it's
the perfect place!

277
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,457
It will feel like she's
always here with us.

278
00:17:07,957 --> 00:17:09,097
Fine.

279
00:17:09,697 --> 00:17:12,257
Let's place her at a charnel house
as soon as we have the money.

280
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:14,937
Hey mister, can
we feed the fish?

281
00:17:15,197 --> 00:17:16,936
No, don't! They're
very sensitive.

282
00:17:16,937 --> 00:17:18,836
They'll die if you feed
them anytime. Don't!

283
00:17:18,837 --> 00:17:22,036
Why not? I want to feed them!

284
00:17:22,037 --> 00:17:24,476
Let me feed them!

285
00:17:24,807 --> 00:17:27,746
Hey, this is what I cherish
the most in this house.

286
00:17:27,917 --> 00:17:29,875
Just stand there and
watch them, okay?

287
00:17:29,876 --> 00:17:31,687
Don't touch it like that. No!

288
00:17:32,486 --> 00:17:33,586
Hands off!

289
00:17:33,587 --> 00:17:35,756
He said no touching.

290
00:17:48,337 --> 00:17:49,366
Hello?

291
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:52,136
Yes.

292
00:17:54,477 --> 00:17:55,577
All right.

293
00:18:01,077 --> 00:18:02,477
Could I see you for a minute?

294
00:18:03,547 --> 00:18:04,547
What?

295
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:07,757
I have something to tell you.

296
00:18:11,087 --> 00:18:12,126
This way, sir.

297
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:15,195
Of course. Mr. Kim!

298
00:18:15,196 --> 00:18:17,126
- Oh, hello!
- Hello, I'm Kang Kyung Hoon.

299
00:18:17,866 --> 00:18:19,195
Nice to meet you, sir!

300
00:18:19,196 --> 00:18:21,165
- Nice to meet you.
- It's very kind of you.

301
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:22,895
That's why you should
support me even more.

302
00:18:22,896 --> 00:18:25,336
Of course, sir.

303
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:27,277
- Good luck, then.
- Thank you.

304
00:18:27,936 --> 00:18:29,307
- Thank you, sir.
- Hello.

305
00:18:32,007 --> 00:18:33,146
Excuse me, sir.

306
00:18:33,807 --> 00:18:35,546
According to rumors,

307
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:38,816
I heard they're trying to build
a shopping complex here.

308
00:18:38,817 --> 00:18:39,916
That can't be true, can it?

309
00:18:40,017 --> 00:18:42,787
Is that so? I didn't
hear anything about it.

310
00:18:43,156 --> 00:18:45,686
If you haven't heard anything,

311
00:18:45,926 --> 00:18:47,695
I guess it isn't true!

312
00:18:47,696 --> 00:18:49,497
- They're not building it!
- What a relief!

313
00:18:50,827 --> 00:18:52,566
If they build a shopping mall,

314
00:18:52,567 --> 00:18:54,837
it will ruin the entire market.

315
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:58,566
If they try to build one,

316
00:18:58,567 --> 00:19:01,476
please pull some strings
so that it doesn't happen.

317
00:19:01,477 --> 00:19:04,347
Of course! After all, I
am the local lawmaker,

318
00:19:04,406 --> 00:19:06,876
so I'll need to help you
out at times like these.

319
00:19:07,106 --> 00:19:09,716
You must be having a hard time
already with the bad economy,

320
00:19:09,977 --> 00:19:11,186
so don't worry.

321
00:19:12,446 --> 00:19:13,786
They're not going to build
it! What are you doing?

322
00:19:13,787 --> 00:19:16,655
- Applaud for him!
- Cheer up!

323
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:19,327
- Kang Kyung Hoon!
- Kang Kyung Hoon!

324
00:19:19,557 --> 00:19:21,826
- Kang Kyung Hoon!
- Kang Kyung Hoon!

325
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,427
- See you again, sir.
- Kang Kyung Hoon!

326
00:19:23,557 --> 00:19:25,037
- Kang Kyung Hoon!
- Kang Kyung Hoon!

327
00:19:26,926 --> 00:19:29,896
They will cause quite a fuss when
we announce the shopping mall.

328
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:32,936
The markets are always
causing a fuss, anyway.

329
00:19:33,936 --> 00:19:35,906
Politics is about the numbers.

330
00:19:36,636 --> 00:19:39,306
When the shopping mall gets
built, there will be more applauses...

331
00:19:39,307 --> 00:19:41,577
than those complaints.

332
00:19:54,227 --> 00:19:56,126
What are you trying to tell me?

333
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,666
Stop glaring at
me and just tell me.

334
00:19:59,097 --> 00:20:00,666
You didn't just take us in...

335
00:20:01,837 --> 00:20:02,936
without a price, did you?

336
00:20:04,837 --> 00:20:06,267
What do you mean?

337
00:20:06,966 --> 00:20:09,876
I heard that "reprobate son" comes
up when you search your name online.

338
00:20:12,277 --> 00:20:13,346
So?

339
00:20:13,347 --> 00:20:16,146
I'm sure your image will improve
if you take in some orphans.

340
00:20:18,787 --> 00:20:20,416
That's why you took us in.

341
00:20:22,087 --> 00:20:23,116
That's not true.

342
00:20:23,656 --> 00:20:26,057
- What nonsense are you...
- It doesn't matter.

343
00:20:26,686 --> 00:20:28,056
It might be better off.

344
00:20:28,057 --> 00:20:30,617
Better than making a big deal
out of being related and all that.

345
00:20:31,297 --> 00:20:32,926
You saw how good I am at acting.

346
00:20:34,196 --> 00:20:37,636
I can act like a good
daughter in front of people.

347
00:20:38,466 --> 00:20:42,277
But you have to put on a
good act of the doting father too.

348
00:20:42,737 --> 00:20:44,406
Until I graduate and get a job.

349
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:49,747
He told me to move in,

350
00:20:50,446 --> 00:20:52,146
but I don't know
what I should do.

351
00:20:53,146 --> 00:20:56,017
Why are you hesitating?
You have to move in, of course.

352
00:20:56,716 --> 00:20:59,156
You said you might get
kicked out for not paying rent.

353
00:20:59,856 --> 00:21:01,926
That's why I went to
find him in the first place.

354
00:21:05,027 --> 00:21:06,626
And I wanted to see...

355
00:21:07,737 --> 00:21:08,936
who my biological father was.

356
00:21:11,606 --> 00:21:12,666
But...

357
00:21:15,807 --> 00:21:17,847
it turns out he's
not well-off, either.

358
00:21:20,307 --> 00:21:23,916
Even if I am his daughter,
I'm a complete stranger.

359
00:21:26,287 --> 00:21:29,487
I even took in my siblings,
who aren't even related to him,

360
00:21:31,057 --> 00:21:32,577
so he must've been
completely shocked.

361
00:21:33,856 --> 00:21:35,527
Even I think it
was a bit too much.

362
00:21:37,896 --> 00:21:41,297
He would've kicked us
out since we were a burden.

363
00:21:42,767 --> 00:21:43,797
But...

364
00:21:46,466 --> 00:21:49,577
he suddenly changed his
mind, which seems weird.

365
00:21:50,906 --> 00:21:51,946
What do you mean?

366
00:21:52,946 --> 00:21:55,446
I think he took us in
for some other reason,

367
00:21:57,547 --> 00:21:59,386
not because he
was worried about us.

368
00:22:00,347 --> 00:22:03,987
If that's bothering you, why
don't you try testing him?

369
00:22:06,186 --> 00:22:07,327
"Testing him"?

370
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:09,926
Let's go ahead...

371
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:13,926
and make a contract.

372
00:22:37,386 --> 00:22:40,226
Fine! I like how
easy-going you are.

373
00:22:40,227 --> 00:22:42,727
I feel much better, now
that you're this open-minded.

374
00:22:42,956 --> 00:22:45,996
Contractual relationships can
actually be the most rational.

375
00:22:45,997 --> 00:22:48,436
- Let's write a contract.
- "Contract"?

376
00:22:49,936 --> 00:22:51,806
Why would we do that?
It's not like we're strangers.

377
00:22:51,807 --> 00:22:54,676
We are strangers. We're
in a contractual relationship.

378
00:22:55,237 --> 00:22:57,336
Well... But still...

379
00:22:57,337 --> 00:22:58,376
And I...

380
00:22:59,547 --> 00:23:00,817
can't trust you.

381
00:23:06,386 --> 00:23:09,787
Fine! Let's do it, then.
Write the contract.

382
00:23:14,297 --> 00:23:17,327
"Wi Dae Han and Han Da Jung..."

383
00:23:18,396 --> 00:23:20,497
"shall act as contractual
father and daughter..."

384
00:23:20,936 --> 00:23:23,966
"until Han Da Jung
graduates high school..."

385
00:23:24,636 --> 00:23:26,936
"and finds a job,"

386
00:23:27,466 --> 00:23:31,646
"for the benefit
of both parties."

387
00:23:36,616 --> 00:23:39,816
"Wi Dae Han shall fulfill..."

388
00:23:39,817 --> 00:23:44,685
"his duty in nurturing
the four siblings..."

389
00:23:44,686 --> 00:23:49,126
"as their official father
until Han Da Jung..."

390
00:23:49,456 --> 00:23:53,097
"can be financially
independent."

391
00:23:54,837 --> 00:23:55,866
Okay.

392
00:23:57,837 --> 00:23:59,136
"Han Da Jung..."

393
00:23:59,767 --> 00:24:03,636
"will pay attention in particular
to her words and actions..."

394
00:24:03,737 --> 00:24:08,317
"so as not to
disgrace Wi Dae Han."

395
00:24:08,477 --> 00:24:13,287
"If a problem shall occur
to Tae Poong and Song Yi,"

396
00:24:13,517 --> 00:24:17,087
"Wi Dae Han shall
lay his work aside..."

397
00:24:17,287 --> 00:24:20,287
"and rush to their school."

398
00:24:21,097 --> 00:24:23,827
Hey... Isn't that
a bit too harsh?

399
00:24:23,926 --> 00:24:25,097
What's so harsh?

400
00:24:25,597 --> 00:24:26,926
"Han Da Jung..."

401
00:24:27,327 --> 00:24:31,036
"shall give her full support
so as to help Wi Dae Han..."

402
00:24:31,037 --> 00:24:33,406
"return to his place in
the National Assembly."

403
00:24:34,636 --> 00:24:37,206
"For example,
when it is needed,"

404
00:24:38,077 --> 00:24:43,646
"she may make an appearance
on TV for Wi Dae Han."

405
00:24:48,017 --> 00:24:51,125
"The housework shall be taken
care of by Wi Dae Han on weekdays,"

406
00:24:51,126 --> 00:24:52,686
"and Han Da Jung on weekends."

407
00:24:54,396 --> 00:24:56,156
"However, during
exceptional circumstances,"

408
00:24:56,656 --> 00:24:58,727
"it may be modified
through discussions."

409
00:25:01,896 --> 00:25:03,767
"Wi Dae Han and Han Da Jung..."

410
00:25:04,567 --> 00:25:07,537
"shall never leak anything
they may find out..."

411
00:25:07,977 --> 00:25:14,047
"during the time of
contract to a third party."

412
00:25:14,517 --> 00:25:15,517
There.

413
00:25:23,487 --> 00:25:27,326
"However, if the
duties of each party..."

414
00:25:27,327 --> 00:25:31,567
"are not properly fulfilled,"

415
00:25:32,527 --> 00:25:34,666
"there may be an exception."

416
00:25:37,196 --> 00:25:38,706
I have trust issues.

417
00:25:41,577 --> 00:25:42,676
Okay.

418
00:25:43,606 --> 00:25:44,676
Let's do this.

419
00:25:48,517 --> 00:25:50,216
I'll just call you "Mister".

420
00:25:50,376 --> 00:25:51,786
Since my siblings are with me,

421
00:25:51,787 --> 00:25:53,646
I can't be the only
one to call you "Dad".

422
00:25:53,847 --> 00:25:55,087
Whatever pleases you.

423
00:25:57,257 --> 00:25:59,486
Let's print...

424
00:25:59,487 --> 00:26:00,826
If you don't fulfill your
role as father properly,

425
00:26:00,827 --> 00:26:02,557
I'll go around
blabbing everywhere.

426
00:26:03,757 --> 00:26:05,797
That your taking us in...

427
00:26:06,267 --> 00:26:07,837
was one big show.

428
00:26:12,037 --> 00:26:15,736
What's considered
doing it "properly"?

429
00:26:15,737 --> 00:26:17,506
Did you lose your
watch by any chance?

430
00:26:17,507 --> 00:26:18,507
What?

431
00:26:18,508 --> 00:26:21,176
That call earlier was
from the Chuncheon police.

432
00:26:22,347 --> 00:26:23,916
The police? Why?

433
00:26:24,247 --> 00:26:28,355
Two iced Americanos, one iced
mocha latte with an extra shot,

434
00:26:28,356 --> 00:26:29,655
and one iced latte.

435
00:26:29,656 --> 00:26:30,757
Put it on this.

436
00:26:31,356 --> 00:26:32,356
Okay.

437
00:26:32,357 --> 00:26:33,626
Mr. Kang.

438
00:26:33,757 --> 00:26:35,626
It's so nice running
into me, right?

439
00:26:41,196 --> 00:26:43,466
Thank you. I'll buy next time.

440
00:26:43,966 --> 00:26:45,837
Then we'll have
to meet four times.

441
00:26:46,666 --> 00:26:48,277
I bought four drinks today.

442
00:26:49,577 --> 00:26:51,706
You're a lot cheaper
than you look.

443
00:26:51,876 --> 00:26:53,375
Let's call it even with a meal.

444
00:26:53,376 --> 00:26:55,676
That sounds good. How
about dinner tonight?

445
00:26:55,977 --> 00:26:56,977
What?

446
00:26:56,978 --> 00:26:58,747
I'm a lot more
impatient than I look.

447
00:27:01,156 --> 00:27:02,455
I'll buy next time.

448
00:27:02,456 --> 00:27:04,757
I have plans tonight.

449
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:06,856
A date?

450
00:27:06,857 --> 00:27:09,257
Yes. With my parents.

451
00:27:09,456 --> 00:27:11,726
I said I'd help out
at their restaurant.

452
00:27:11,727 --> 00:27:14,066
You should stop by sometime.

453
00:27:14,067 --> 00:27:15,395
What kind of restaurant is it?

454
00:27:15,396 --> 00:27:17,866
They have a chicken
place at Inju Market.

455
00:27:18,206 --> 00:27:20,736
If you come when I'm
there, I'll be generous and...

456
00:27:20,737 --> 00:27:21,737
Free?

457
00:27:21,738 --> 00:27:23,477
No. 10 percent discount.

458
00:27:33,017 --> 00:27:35,956
If it was a gift, there
should be a giver!

459
00:27:36,356 --> 00:27:37,926
Tell me the truth!

460
00:27:39,126 --> 00:27:40,356
Where did you get this?

461
00:27:40,757 --> 00:27:42,227
I gave it to him.

462
00:27:44,356 --> 00:27:48,097
Why didn't you tell
him? It's not a big secret.

463
00:27:48,396 --> 00:27:49,966
I gave him that watch.

464
00:27:50,497 --> 00:27:53,466
And here's the
warranty for the watch.

465
00:27:56,106 --> 00:28:00,747
The back of the watch will have
my initials "WDH" engraved on it.

466
00:28:10,487 --> 00:28:12,827
Wi Dae Han. My initials.

467
00:28:15,757 --> 00:28:18,567
My mom bought me this watch
when I became an Assemblyman.

468
00:28:19,327 --> 00:28:21,136
That's what you stole.

469
00:28:21,567 --> 00:28:25,007
But I'm extremely
magnanimous. It's endless.

470
00:28:26,067 --> 00:28:27,405
I'll forgive you,

471
00:28:27,406 --> 00:28:29,837
so quit the rebellion
short, and come home.

472
00:28:29,977 --> 00:28:31,605
If you really don't
want to live with me,

473
00:28:31,606 --> 00:28:33,875
you can go to
juvie for stealing.

474
00:28:33,876 --> 00:28:35,846
I hear it's nice in there
and they feed you well.

475
00:28:35,847 --> 00:28:37,376
Report me if you want.

476
00:28:39,216 --> 00:28:40,347
Tak.

477
00:28:41,017 --> 00:28:43,456
Wouldn't my house
be better than juvie?

478
00:28:44,727 --> 00:28:46,057
I said no.

479
00:28:47,557 --> 00:28:48,757
Why not?

480
00:28:48,956 --> 00:28:50,797
Because I can't stand you.

481
00:28:51,057 --> 00:28:52,395
You're no better.

482
00:28:52,396 --> 00:28:53,965
Exactly, so let me be.

483
00:28:53,966 --> 00:28:55,165
I want to!

484
00:28:55,166 --> 00:28:57,297
Then do it! Get lost!

485
00:28:58,067 --> 00:28:59,266
If you don't fulfill your
role as father properly,

486
00:28:59,267 --> 00:29:00,906
I'll go around
blabbing everywhere.

487
00:29:01,237 --> 00:29:03,337
That your taking us in...

488
00:29:03,676 --> 00:29:05,347
was one big show.

489
00:29:10,077 --> 00:29:12,817
How can I just let you
be? I'm your guardian.

490
00:29:12,946 --> 00:29:14,487
Give me a break.

491
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:17,386
Did you steal the
watch to sell it?

492
00:29:18,186 --> 00:29:19,855
Didn't you steal it
to get back at me...

493
00:29:19,856 --> 00:29:21,696
because you couldn't stand me?

494
00:29:22,727 --> 00:29:25,196
I said I don't need
you. I said to get lost.

495
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,797
There was someone
I couldn't stand either.

496
00:29:34,876 --> 00:29:37,076
Do you have a girlfriend?

497
00:29:37,077 --> 00:29:38,376
No.

498
00:29:38,406 --> 00:29:40,876
I think he got a girlfriend.

499
00:29:44,247 --> 00:29:47,847
(Son of...)

500
00:29:56,497 --> 00:29:58,327
Emotions are money too.

501
00:29:58,727 --> 00:30:00,827
Use it, and you're
the one who loses out.

502
00:30:04,466 --> 00:30:06,465
You don't have to like me
just because you live with me.

503
00:30:06,466 --> 00:30:07,837
Do you think real families...

504
00:30:08,237 --> 00:30:10,135
live together because
they like each other?

505
00:30:10,136 --> 00:30:12,047
I bet there are more that don't.

506
00:30:12,347 --> 00:30:14,616
They live together because
they need each other.

507
00:30:17,446 --> 00:30:19,987
I won't force you
anymore, so do as you wish.

508
00:30:20,347 --> 00:30:22,987
Either act as your
emotions dictate,

509
00:30:23,317 --> 00:30:24,756
or save your emotions...

510
00:30:24,757 --> 00:30:27,287
and live with the person
you need right now.

511
00:30:28,856 --> 00:30:30,196
Prove it.

512
00:30:30,557 --> 00:30:31,566
What?

513
00:30:31,567 --> 00:30:34,027
That I need you.

514
00:30:35,237 --> 00:30:36,267
What?

515
00:30:41,166 --> 00:30:43,476
So how much is it per month?

516
00:30:43,477 --> 00:30:45,945
With the fees and
the payment plan,

517
00:30:45,946 --> 00:30:48,577
it'll be 121 dollars a month.

518
00:30:48,616 --> 00:30:49,747
What?

519
00:30:49,977 --> 00:30:53,047
Why... Why is it so expensive?

520
00:31:02,196 --> 00:31:04,456
(2,057 minus 121
equals 1,936 dollars)

521
00:31:09,737 --> 00:31:11,067
Thank you.

522
00:31:12,866 --> 00:31:14,837
Happy now? Is that enough proof?

523
00:31:21,616 --> 00:31:22,876
Why that...

524
00:31:24,817 --> 00:31:28,057
He's despicable. How
could a dad do that?

525
00:31:28,257 --> 00:31:30,916
How could he accept the deal
just because you offered it?

526
00:31:31,356 --> 00:31:33,126
It's for the best.

527
00:31:33,327 --> 00:31:35,356
I feel better since
we're not staying for free.

528
00:31:36,257 --> 00:31:38,126
Now that we have a contract,

529
00:31:38,196 --> 00:31:42,037
I'll give what I must,
and get what I should.

530
00:31:43,567 --> 00:31:45,767
Da Jung! What is this?

531
00:31:46,666 --> 00:31:47,936
Hold on.

532
00:31:49,577 --> 00:31:51,675
That's a golf club.
It's crazy expensive.

533
00:31:51,676 --> 00:31:54,576
Don't touch it. Mr. Wi
will get mad. Put it down.

534
00:31:54,577 --> 00:31:57,645
See? Put it back
in the bag. Hurry.

535
00:31:57,646 --> 00:31:59,715
We can have a
sword fight with this.

536
00:31:59,716 --> 00:32:01,247
Take that!

537
00:32:01,856 --> 00:32:04,455
Hey. Put that down now. Now!

538
00:32:04,456 --> 00:32:08,196
It's dangerous!

539
00:32:29,876 --> 00:32:32,416
I'm worried. The item
for this week is too weak.

540
00:32:32,446 --> 00:32:34,787
Yes, the item is weak,

541
00:32:35,087 --> 00:32:37,686
but your biggest
problem is the format.

542
00:32:37,716 --> 00:32:38,955
What's wrong with it?

543
00:32:38,956 --> 00:32:41,926
Hey. We've been following
the same format for years.

544
00:32:42,257 --> 00:32:44,727
We used it for way too long.

545
00:32:44,866 --> 00:32:46,327
But it's fun.

546
00:32:49,166 --> 00:32:50,866
(Da Jung)

547
00:32:53,406 --> 00:32:55,777
- Hi, Da Jung.
- Hi, Soo Hyun.

548
00:32:56,507 --> 00:32:58,747
We moved into
Mr. Wi's house today.

549
00:32:59,676 --> 00:33:01,517
Yes, we're done moving in.

550
00:33:02,277 --> 00:33:06,116
If you have time,
come over for dinner.

551
00:33:06,817 --> 00:33:08,186
See you later.

552
00:33:10,356 --> 00:33:11,557
Is she coming?

553
00:33:11,956 --> 00:33:13,057
Yes.

554
00:33:13,156 --> 00:33:15,396
He wouldn't get mad
at us in front of her.

555
00:33:16,956 --> 00:33:18,097
Hands up!

556
00:33:40,847 --> 00:33:43,487
I'm scared to see what
the house looks like.

557
00:33:45,727 --> 00:33:46,787
Dae Han.

558
00:33:49,097 --> 00:33:52,327
Soo Hyun. I was going to call.

559
00:33:55,196 --> 00:33:56,566
I heard the kids moved in.

560
00:33:56,567 --> 00:34:00,365
Did Da Jung call? That's
right, she seems to adore you.

561
00:34:00,366 --> 00:34:02,375
She must think
of you like a sister.

562
00:34:02,376 --> 00:34:03,376
So?

563
00:34:03,577 --> 00:34:04,676
Well...

564
00:34:05,347 --> 00:34:07,875
Imagine how uncomfortable
they must be to be living with me.

565
00:34:07,876 --> 00:34:10,176
Come by often
and look after them.

566
00:34:10,277 --> 00:34:12,216
I'm tired. Let's go in.

567
00:34:37,077 --> 00:34:39,846
My gosh. Are you guys cleaning?

568
00:34:39,847 --> 00:34:42,576
The living room is sparkling.

569
00:34:42,577 --> 00:34:43,817
Welcome home.

570
00:34:44,377 --> 00:34:45,746
Did you come with him?

571
00:34:45,747 --> 00:34:48,357
We met out front.

572
00:34:49,057 --> 00:34:51,585
You must be tired from
the move. You should rest.

573
00:34:51,586 --> 00:34:54,486
It's okay. We're
not tired at all.

574
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:57,457
Gosh. Goodness.

575
00:34:57,656 --> 00:35:01,196
Tak. Look at your little brother
and sister. Look how good they are.

576
00:35:03,597 --> 00:35:06,365
Kids. Are you hungry?
Should we order something?

577
00:35:06,366 --> 00:35:08,106
I want sweet and sour pork!

578
00:35:08,107 --> 00:35:10,876
Wait. I ordered chicken
on my way home.

579
00:35:10,877 --> 00:35:13,776
There's a really good
chicken place at Inju Market.

580
00:35:24,156 --> 00:35:25,256
Come in.

581
00:35:40,607 --> 00:35:42,977
What... What is that?

582
00:35:43,937 --> 00:35:47,207
There was a small accident
while we were cleaning.

583
00:35:47,506 --> 00:35:49,346
Your chicken's here.

584
00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:51,247
- Your chicken's here.
- But...

585
00:35:51,477 --> 00:35:52,787
I was fast, right?

586
00:35:53,247 --> 00:35:54,347
Dad.

587
00:35:55,156 --> 00:35:57,417
What? Dad?

588
00:35:58,857 --> 00:36:00,827
What are you doing here?

589
00:36:02,597 --> 00:36:04,497
He's a friend from college.

590
00:36:05,526 --> 00:36:08,026
- Hello, sir.
- Yes, hello.

591
00:36:09,537 --> 00:36:12,066
My gosh. What...

592
00:36:12,667 --> 00:36:14,037
I'll take it.

593
00:36:15,736 --> 00:36:18,505
Well... If you're
her college friend,

594
00:36:18,506 --> 00:36:19,806
I can't take your money.

595
00:36:19,807 --> 00:36:21,816
- No, it's okay.
- It's on the house.

596
00:36:22,816 --> 00:36:24,577
I'll see you again later.

597
00:36:28,046 --> 00:36:29,116
What's that?

598
00:36:31,517 --> 00:36:32,727
That's cracking.

599
00:36:34,586 --> 00:36:35,597
Oh no.

600
00:36:36,597 --> 00:36:37,627
Oh no.

601
00:37:01,287 --> 00:37:03,457
Oh my gosh. Be careful.

602
00:37:03,787 --> 00:37:05,156
Are you okay?

603
00:37:18,406 --> 00:37:21,236
Hey. How can you
laugh right now?

604
00:37:22,437 --> 00:37:23,736
This is awesome.

605
00:37:28,377 --> 00:37:29,417
Tak.

606
00:37:30,917 --> 00:37:31,946
Hey!

607
00:37:36,115 --> 00:37:37,356
What happened?

608
00:37:37,716 --> 00:37:39,425
You cherished them so much.

609
00:37:40,686 --> 00:37:42,825
Some other kids moved
in and displaced them.

610
00:37:44,425 --> 00:37:45,995
When people live together,

611
00:37:46,696 --> 00:37:48,896
conflicts and chaos
are bound to ensue.

612
00:37:49,765 --> 00:37:51,845
There's something you
need in order to prevent that.

613
00:37:52,305 --> 00:37:54,936
- What is that?
- I thought it over,

614
00:37:55,575 --> 00:37:58,205
and if we want to live
harmoniously in the same house...

615
00:37:58,446 --> 00:38:00,704
without problems or fights,

616
00:38:00,705 --> 00:38:02,075
we need some laws.

617
00:38:02,716 --> 00:38:04,446
- Laws?
- Yes.

618
00:38:06,716 --> 00:38:07,845
(Constitution of the House)

619
00:38:09,716 --> 00:38:11,756
Rules all members of
the household must keep.

620
00:38:12,626 --> 00:38:14,385
"Constitution of the House."

621
00:38:14,756 --> 00:38:16,495
What's a constitution?

622
00:38:16,955 --> 00:38:18,055
So...

623
00:38:18,626 --> 00:38:21,396
It's the most basic
law among laws.

624
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:25,066
Do we go to jail if we break
the Constitution of the House?

625
00:38:25,336 --> 00:38:26,966
Well, not exactly.

626
00:38:28,236 --> 00:38:30,304
I'm saying let's try our best...

627
00:38:30,305 --> 00:38:32,646
to keep these rules to
the best of our abilities.

628
00:38:36,245 --> 00:38:38,245
- I'm in.
- Me too.

629
00:38:38,745 --> 00:38:39,816
Me too.

630
00:38:42,856 --> 00:38:44,055
- Okay.
- Hold on.

631
00:38:44,686 --> 00:38:46,225
It's a good idea,

632
00:38:46,586 --> 00:38:48,625
but why are you deciding the
constitutional laws by yourself?

633
00:38:48,626 --> 00:38:50,426
It should be decided
together democratically.

634
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:51,965
They're still young.

635
00:38:51,966 --> 00:38:53,895
I made the initial
draft for convenience.

636
00:38:53,896 --> 00:38:55,936
We can supplement
it as we live together.

637
00:38:56,936 --> 00:38:59,236
- I'm in.
- Me too.

638
00:38:59,736 --> 00:39:00,905
Me too.

639
00:39:03,236 --> 00:39:04,535
Me too. Okay.

640
00:39:05,705 --> 00:39:10,215
"We will work
together as a family..."

641
00:39:10,216 --> 00:39:12,015
"to create a happy family."

642
00:39:12,845 --> 00:39:14,385
Not bad.

643
00:39:14,646 --> 00:39:16,055
Article 1, Section 1.

644
00:39:16,916 --> 00:39:18,155
In the interest of safety,

645
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:22,696
we will not do anything dangerous
inside or outside of the house.

646
00:39:23,856 --> 00:39:24,955
Tae Poong.

647
00:39:25,626 --> 00:39:27,166
- Got that?
- Okay!

648
00:39:29,666 --> 00:39:30,696
Section two.

649
00:39:31,466 --> 00:39:33,364
We will not touch
other people's things,

650
00:39:33,365 --> 00:39:35,735
and we will not use
our cell phones...

651
00:39:35,736 --> 00:39:38,276
when someone else is
talking or while eating.

652
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:41,205
He's talking about you.

653
00:39:42,015 --> 00:39:44,015
- Give it back.
- Pay attention.

654
00:39:44,776 --> 00:39:46,186
I like this constitution.

655
00:39:47,646 --> 00:39:48,816
Okay, Section three.

656
00:39:49,455 --> 00:39:51,355
We will divide the housework...

657
00:39:51,356 --> 00:39:52,554
and cooking...

658
00:39:52,555 --> 00:39:55,856
will be shared between Wi Dae
Han and Han Da Jung. Okay?

659
00:39:56,925 --> 00:39:59,296
- Okay.
- Why is it so long?

660
00:39:59,925 --> 00:40:01,525
There are only two
articles. Be patient.

661
00:40:02,796 --> 00:40:05,035
You see sections
1, 2, and 3 here?

662
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:07,006
Just as these say,

663
00:40:08,575 --> 00:40:11,175
all of us are lacking
in many ways.

664
00:40:11,635 --> 00:40:13,506
We have a child who
easily gets anxious...

665
00:40:14,506 --> 00:40:16,615
and a child who is
completely hyperactive.

666
00:40:17,615 --> 00:40:19,745
We also have a child
with a terrible attitude.

667
00:40:21,285 --> 00:40:24,055
A happy family isn't
created by perfect people...

668
00:40:24,285 --> 00:40:25,486
but created...

669
00:40:26,256 --> 00:40:29,126
when imperfect people try to
fill each others' imperfections.

670
00:40:29,955 --> 00:40:32,026
We are all imperfect,

671
00:40:32,526 --> 00:40:34,166
but let's work together...

672
00:40:35,396 --> 00:40:36,635
to become a perfect family.

673
00:40:38,966 --> 00:40:40,006
Okay?

674
00:40:40,705 --> 00:40:43,006
- Okay.
- Okay.

675
00:40:43,436 --> 00:40:44,635
- Okay?
- Okay.

676
00:40:45,975 --> 00:40:48,675
If you were moved,
you may applaud.

677
00:40:53,186 --> 00:40:55,216
He's done, so give me my phone.

678
00:40:55,955 --> 00:40:58,416
Hey. Article 1, Section 2...

679
00:41:05,825 --> 00:41:09,066
That's how democracy
is. It's messy.

680
00:41:09,296 --> 00:41:11,365
What's a democracy?

681
00:41:12,705 --> 00:41:15,205
A democracy. A democracy is...

682
00:41:15,405 --> 00:41:18,276
I'm hungry! I'm so hungry.

683
00:41:18,475 --> 00:41:20,506
Order more chicken.

684
00:41:20,745 --> 00:41:21,745
What?

685
00:41:26,986 --> 00:41:29,655
(Yellow Chicken)

686
00:41:29,916 --> 00:41:31,885
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

687
00:41:32,925 --> 00:41:34,055
Wi Dae Han?

688
00:41:34,425 --> 00:41:37,256
Do you mean the guy
who lost the election?

689
00:41:38,196 --> 00:41:39,225
That's right.

690
00:41:39,865 --> 00:41:41,995
He's the jerk who
abandoned his dad.

691
00:41:42,595 --> 00:41:44,465
He didn't abandon him.

692
00:41:44,466 --> 00:41:47,006
His family situation
is a bit complicated.

693
00:41:47,765 --> 00:41:49,106
It isn't a bit.

694
00:41:49,336 --> 00:41:51,275
It's super complicated.

695
00:41:51,276 --> 00:41:54,344
He has a bunch of kids at
home. I thought it was a school.

696
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:56,445
I said it's complicated.

697
00:41:56,446 --> 00:41:59,785
Anyway, stay far
away from that house.

698
00:42:00,186 --> 00:42:02,355
If you get involved with
someone with a complicated life,

699
00:42:02,356 --> 00:42:04,085
your life will go down the
drain before you know it.

700
00:42:04,086 --> 00:42:07,424
Look at today. That aquarium
burst out of nowhere...

701
00:42:07,425 --> 00:42:08,824
and flooded the house.

702
00:42:08,825 --> 00:42:10,155
Father, please.

703
00:42:11,995 --> 00:42:14,795
I'll do some volunteer work
tonight, so go home and rest, Mom.

704
00:42:14,796 --> 00:42:16,135
Go to a sauna or something.

705
00:42:16,396 --> 00:42:17,696
You should go home and rest.

706
00:42:18,066 --> 00:42:20,436
I should fry chicken
for the rest of my life.

707
00:42:20,635 --> 00:42:22,235
I fried so many,

708
00:42:22,236 --> 00:42:25,035
that I don't know if I'm frying
them or if they're frying me.

709
00:42:25,805 --> 00:42:28,175
Father, why are
you talking like that?

710
00:42:28,345 --> 00:42:31,474
What did I say? I
didn't say a thing.

711
00:42:31,475 --> 00:42:34,585
Don't mind me. Frying
chicken isn't hard at all.

712
00:42:34,586 --> 00:42:37,186
- At most, I'll die...
- Why you!

713
00:42:38,256 --> 00:42:40,462
You can't stand the thought
of your wife resting, can you?

714
00:42:40,486 --> 00:42:42,126
No, what I mean is,

715
00:42:42,856 --> 00:42:46,166
you should go home and
rest since Soo Hyun is here.

716
00:42:46,626 --> 00:42:48,166
You're so sensitive.

717
00:42:48,865 --> 00:42:51,436
Rest up. I'll go work.

718
00:42:54,205 --> 00:42:55,376
- Soo Hyun.
- Yes?

719
00:42:55,836 --> 00:42:56,975
Table three.

720
00:42:57,135 --> 00:42:58,175
Yes, sir.

721
00:42:58,675 --> 00:43:02,074
Here's your spicy
chicken. Enjoy.

722
00:43:02,075 --> 00:43:03,175
Oh my gosh.

723
00:43:05,546 --> 00:43:07,515
- What's wrong?
- What?

724
00:43:08,146 --> 00:43:11,686
Someone said I'd get a
discount if I came here.

725
00:43:17,756 --> 00:43:19,556
You must have good
connections in the market.

726
00:43:20,995 --> 00:43:23,736
- Two pints of beer, please.
- Be right there.

727
00:43:24,236 --> 00:43:26,335
Let me give you a tip.

728
00:43:26,336 --> 00:43:28,776
This place has better fried
chicken than spicy chicken.

729
00:43:29,376 --> 00:43:30,606
Enjoy.

730
00:43:35,175 --> 00:43:36,735
We're not here for
the chicken, are we?

731
00:43:38,316 --> 00:43:39,615
Do you want fried chicken?

732
00:43:40,046 --> 00:43:42,186
You live alone,
right? Get three to go.

733
00:43:47,686 --> 00:43:48,756
Tak.

734
00:43:49,696 --> 00:43:52,626
- What?
- Where's Daddy?

735
00:43:58,035 --> 00:43:59,066
I don't know.

736
00:43:59,905 --> 00:44:02,805
Did Daddy die too?

737
00:44:04,635 --> 00:44:05,745
I don't know.

738
00:44:29,265 --> 00:44:30,466
Can we talk for a minute?

739
00:44:38,845 --> 00:44:40,075
Are the others sleeping?

740
00:44:40,705 --> 00:44:41,776
Yes.

741
00:44:44,146 --> 00:44:45,216
You must be tired.

742
00:44:47,385 --> 00:44:48,416
It is what it is.

743
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:55,086
How did I do today?

744
00:44:58,256 --> 00:44:59,325
What do you mean?

745
00:45:00,966 --> 00:45:02,095
My dad act.

746
00:45:05,365 --> 00:45:07,135
It wasn't too bad.

747
00:45:12,046 --> 00:45:14,376
It's much harder than I thought,

748
00:45:15,305 --> 00:45:16,475
but I still have to do it.

749
00:45:18,946 --> 00:45:20,146
Since we made a contract.

750
00:45:25,155 --> 00:45:26,385
Sure.

751
00:45:27,925 --> 00:45:29,356
Since we made a contract.

752
00:45:35,936 --> 00:45:37,896
So what do I have to do for you?

753
00:45:40,265 --> 00:45:42,705
Well...

754
00:45:42,936 --> 00:45:44,674
(Politics of Our Society Café)

755
00:45:44,675 --> 00:45:46,074
(My father is not
a reprobate son.)

756
00:45:46,075 --> 00:45:48,974
It is nice to have a daughter
if she's writing things like this.

757
00:45:48,975 --> 00:45:50,951
I'll have to get the best out of
her now that she's on my side.

758
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:52,686
Who should we tip it off to?

759
00:45:54,816 --> 00:45:57,356
What about Reporter
Shin? Shin Yong Hee.

760
00:45:57,856 --> 00:46:00,054
That guy would take
that bait in a flash.

761
00:46:00,055 --> 00:46:01,785
He's practically a
venomous snake.

762
00:46:02,925 --> 00:46:05,196
Let's get that
nickname off of me.

763
00:46:19,632 --> 00:46:22,201
(Keyword ranking)

764
00:46:22,641 --> 00:46:24,542
Is that another "Wi Dae Han"?

765
00:46:24,741 --> 00:46:25,741
(Wi Dae Han)

766
00:46:26,971 --> 00:46:28,312
(Wi Dae Han Becomes a Father!)

767
00:46:36,252 --> 00:46:37,820
(Wi Dae Han Becomes a Father!)

768
00:46:37,821 --> 00:46:41,252
I am the biological daughter of the
former assemblyman, Wi Dae Han.

769
00:46:42,390 --> 00:46:45,629
I have three siblings
from a different father.

770
00:46:46,589 --> 00:46:50,100
We lost touch with my step-father
after he left us two years ago.

771
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:51,830
And my mother...

772
00:46:52,129 --> 00:46:54,669
died from a hit-and-run
accident two months ago.

773
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:59,038
The only person I
could depend on...

774
00:46:59,039 --> 00:47:01,338
was the former
assemblyman, Wi Dae Han,

775
00:47:01,339 --> 00:47:03,479
my biological father whom
I had never met before.

776
00:47:07,510 --> 00:47:10,220
So he wants to use his family
to solve his family problems?

777
00:47:12,419 --> 00:47:14,390
Politics never goes as planned.

778
00:47:15,890 --> 00:47:18,789
I told Reporter Nam to
do some fact-checking.

779
00:47:19,490 --> 00:47:23,700
People may point fingers at
him, saying he's a reprobate son,

780
00:47:23,930 --> 00:47:25,830
but the Wi Dae Han I met...

781
00:47:26,399 --> 00:47:28,800
is a warm person...

782
00:47:28,839 --> 00:47:32,709
who took me and my
siblings in as family.

783
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:39,660
Did you see the
article about Dae Han?

784
00:47:40,550 --> 00:47:41,649
I did.

785
00:47:42,050 --> 00:47:45,849
They say misfortune doesn't
come alone. I guess it's true.

786
00:47:45,850 --> 00:47:48,649
Why is this a
misfortune? It's a fortune.

787
00:47:49,019 --> 00:47:50,519
"A fortune"?

788
00:47:50,689 --> 00:47:52,329
It looks nice.

789
00:47:52,330 --> 00:47:54,059
"The father of four children".

790
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:55,429
And he's single too.

791
00:47:55,430 --> 00:47:58,160
It's a great chance
to fix his image.

792
00:47:59,899 --> 00:48:02,600
I guess so, but he'll be
facing more problems.

793
00:48:02,669 --> 00:48:04,969
It's not easy to take
care of four children.

794
00:48:04,970 --> 00:48:06,839
He can hardly
take care of himself.

795
00:48:07,069 --> 00:48:09,039
You're close to him, aren't you?

796
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:10,878
Take care of him.

797
00:48:10,879 --> 00:48:14,580
He's struggled enough, so
it's time he climbed back up.

798
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:18,919
(Wi Dae Han Becomes a Father!)

799
00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:23,060
Gosh, she really
shouldn't have written that.

800
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:25,890
Sure, it is a fact,

801
00:48:26,229 --> 00:48:28,389
but it's not something
to brag about.

802
00:48:28,390 --> 00:48:29,930
Sure, of course.

803
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:32,829
Yes, the younger ones
aren't related to me at all.

804
00:48:32,830 --> 00:48:36,599
But how could I only take
my daughter in? They're family.

805
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:39,569
An interview, you say?

806
00:48:39,609 --> 00:48:42,640
Well, I'm quite busy today.

807
00:48:42,810 --> 00:48:44,010
Yes.

808
00:48:44,510 --> 00:48:47,909
It's so hectic, with
four kids around.

809
00:48:47,910 --> 00:48:49,050
Yes.

810
00:48:52,019 --> 00:48:54,050
Da Jung, I'm hungry.

811
00:48:54,220 --> 00:48:55,389
Me too.

812
00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:56,490
Me too.

813
00:48:57,419 --> 00:48:59,529
Should we see
what's in the fridge?

814
00:48:59,530 --> 00:49:00,689
- Yes.
- Yes.

815
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:01,760
Okay.

816
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:18,679
Are you here to have
breakfast with us?

817
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:20,280
Where's that fool, Wi Dae Han?

818
00:49:21,249 --> 00:49:22,479
He's in the study.

819
00:49:25,789 --> 00:49:28,819
Sure. Of course, I
should take care of them.

820
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:31,990
That's what a man
should do. Yes.

821
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:36,129
Sure. They're so cute.

822
00:49:37,229 --> 00:49:39,300
Yes.

823
00:49:39,899 --> 00:49:43,269
Reporter Nam, the kids
are screaming for breakfast.

824
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:46,209
I'll call you again
some other time.

825
00:49:46,439 --> 00:49:48,810
Sure. Yes, sir.

826
00:49:49,439 --> 00:49:52,680
Gosh, everyone is
trying to reach me.

827
00:49:54,050 --> 00:49:56,419
What's that look on your face?

828
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:58,080
You made her do
that, didn't you?

829
00:50:01,519 --> 00:50:02,589
What?

830
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:04,688
Make her do what?

831
00:50:04,689 --> 00:50:06,160
Da Jung's post.

832
00:50:10,030 --> 00:50:13,569
I... Why would I make
her do something like that?

833
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:15,430
Is this why you took them in?

834
00:50:16,169 --> 00:50:17,740
So you can make them...

835
00:50:18,169 --> 00:50:21,140
So you can get rid of
that nickname? Is that it?

836
00:50:28,510 --> 00:50:29,580
What if it is?

837
00:50:29,919 --> 00:50:31,018
What?

838
00:50:31,019 --> 00:50:32,450
Can't I do that?

839
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:35,049
I can be their guardian,

840
00:50:35,050 --> 00:50:38,120
and they can help
me out. Is that a sin?

841
00:50:45,129 --> 00:50:46,169
Dae Han,

842
00:50:46,629 --> 00:50:48,529
even if you weren't a good son,

843
00:50:48,530 --> 00:50:51,038
I thought you could
be a good father.

844
00:50:51,039 --> 00:50:52,410
I guess I was wrong.

845
00:50:53,069 --> 00:50:55,740
Don't get back into politics.

846
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:58,979
I'll make sure you can't...

847
00:50:59,450 --> 00:51:01,978
What's taking you guys so long?

848
00:51:01,979 --> 00:51:04,180
The kids want to eat already.

849
00:51:07,519 --> 00:51:10,359
Da Jung, did he
make you do that?

850
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:13,029
Make me do what?

851
00:51:13,030 --> 00:51:14,930
The story you posted.

852
00:51:19,669 --> 00:51:21,530
Is that why you're angry?

853
00:51:21,769 --> 00:51:23,498
Did you think that he...

854
00:51:23,499 --> 00:51:26,310
I mean, would a dad
make his daughter do that?

855
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:33,180
Then why did you post it?

856
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:36,050
To be honest...

857
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:40,589
I knew he was my biological
father when I was in the eighth grade.

858
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:45,419
I had never met him,

859
00:51:46,430 --> 00:51:49,100
but I was so proud
to know that...

860
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:53,499
he was my biological father.

861
00:51:57,870 --> 00:51:59,709
I don't know if you remember,

862
00:52:00,039 --> 00:52:02,010
but when you did the bows,

863
00:52:03,039 --> 00:52:05,010
I gave you knee pads.

864
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:06,708
- 1, 2...
- Move!

865
00:52:06,709 --> 00:52:07,978
Assemblyman, you
should wear this.

866
00:52:07,979 --> 00:52:10,049
That is fine.

867
00:52:10,050 --> 00:52:12,589
Thank you for this.
But I can't take it.

868
00:52:15,019 --> 00:52:17,519
You were like an idol to me,

869
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:21,490
so how do you think I felt
whenever people called you...

870
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:25,560
a reprobate son?

871
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:31,839
I wanted to do
something for him...

872
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:33,939
when he took me
and my siblings in.

873
00:52:35,910 --> 00:52:37,539
That's why I posted it.

874
00:52:41,180 --> 00:52:42,450
Are you sure?

875
00:52:47,319 --> 00:52:50,620
Didn't you hear her?
She said I didn't do it.

876
00:53:11,310 --> 00:53:14,280
He's even using his
daughter for politics?

877
00:53:14,510 --> 00:53:16,918
Wi Dae Han's sperm
must've been great.

878
00:53:16,919 --> 00:53:19,288
Would you take
responsibility for four kids...

879
00:53:19,289 --> 00:53:21,719
just to become an
assemblyman for four years?

880
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:24,001
I think he's going to be on
reality shows with them soon.

881
00:53:27,959 --> 00:53:30,660
Oh my gosh!

882
00:53:31,129 --> 00:53:35,569
So the biological father of
that kid you were talking about...

883
00:53:35,769 --> 00:53:37,300
is Wi Dae Han?

884
00:53:38,870 --> 00:53:40,039
That's it.

885
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:42,509
Four kids?

886
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:44,438
Unbelievable.

887
00:53:44,439 --> 00:53:46,149
Doesn't it seem fishy, though?

888
00:53:46,649 --> 00:53:47,850
What do you mean?

889
00:53:48,310 --> 00:53:50,918
The fact that he took them in...

890
00:53:50,919 --> 00:53:53,689
and the post online.

891
00:53:54,649 --> 00:53:57,060
It seems fake. Something
to make his image better.

892
00:53:59,689 --> 00:54:04,200
I agree. He shunned his own dad,
but he's being nice to some kids?

893
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:07,499
There's no way.
It's all for show.

894
00:54:08,769 --> 00:54:10,369
- It's an act.
- Right?

895
00:54:10,370 --> 00:54:11,539
I think so too.

896
00:54:11,769 --> 00:54:13,010
Hey.

897
00:54:13,269 --> 00:54:15,569
We're the ones that need
to put on a show today.

898
00:54:16,379 --> 00:54:18,879
Stop yapping, and
let's run through it again.

899
00:54:19,350 --> 00:54:20,950
- Okay.
- Okay.

900
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:24,749
Soo Hyun, did you see the
news about Wi Dae Han?

901
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:27,089
We have a broadcast today.

902
00:54:27,490 --> 00:54:29,890
Let's talk about
gossip after the show.

903
00:54:29,990 --> 00:54:32,789
- It's about today's show.
- It is?

904
00:54:33,189 --> 00:54:35,329
Wi Dae Han is the most
trending keyword right now.

905
00:54:35,330 --> 00:54:36,999
It's huge.

906
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,800
- So?
- The original item was too weak.

907
00:54:39,999 --> 00:54:42,669
Let's make this week's
guest Wi Dae Han.

908
00:54:44,370 --> 00:54:45,399
What?

909
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:49,410
I heard Dae Han has
kids now. Four, at that.

910
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:51,180
That's right.

911
00:54:54,109 --> 00:54:57,649
Do you know why politicians
take pictures with kids?

912
00:54:59,050 --> 00:55:02,089
Probably to dilute their
stuffy image with the kids.

913
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:05,589
That's right. It's
not a big secret.

914
00:55:06,289 --> 00:55:08,930
The voters looking at
those pictures know that too.

915
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:12,999
They do, but it still works.

916
00:55:13,970 --> 00:55:16,039
That's why they take
pictures with kids.

917
00:55:16,339 --> 00:55:18,019
Do you think Dae
Han took in those kids...

918
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:20,240
as a calculated political move?

919
00:55:21,269 --> 00:55:22,839
Why else would he do that?

920
00:55:23,910 --> 00:55:25,539
I hope you're wrong.

921
00:55:27,379 --> 00:55:29,280
- Why?
- If you're right,

922
00:55:30,879 --> 00:55:32,180
I'd feel bad for the kids.

923
00:55:34,149 --> 00:55:35,850
This is no time to
worry about those kids.

924
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:39,958
If Dae Han runs against
you in the next election,

925
00:55:39,959 --> 00:55:41,390
it will not be good.

926
00:55:42,359 --> 00:55:44,060
Stop talking about the election.

927
00:55:44,899 --> 00:55:47,600
A person can't do only
the things they want.

928
00:55:53,539 --> 00:55:54,640
I'll go now.

929
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:02,649
(Jung Soo Hyun)

930
00:56:03,919 --> 00:56:05,019
Hello.

931
00:56:05,319 --> 00:56:07,289
Hi, Mr. Kang. I'm sorry,

932
00:56:07,550 --> 00:56:09,560
but we're changing
our guest for this week.

933
00:56:10,060 --> 00:56:11,160
You are?

934
00:56:12,089 --> 00:56:13,089
To whom?

935
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:53,929
Da Jung's post brought
you a lot of attention,

936
00:56:53,930 --> 00:56:55,450
but the public
sentiment is still bad.

937
00:56:55,700 --> 00:56:58,140
You may end up losing and
being stuck with four dead weights.

938
00:57:02,370 --> 00:57:04,039
Beef!

939
00:57:04,580 --> 00:57:07,379
Okay. You need to
eat meat to grow tall.

940
00:57:10,379 --> 00:57:11,979
We got pork earlier.

941
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:15,890
Tae Poong likes beef.

942
00:57:18,220 --> 00:57:20,359
Then take out the pork.

943
00:57:23,030 --> 00:57:24,530
Tak likes pork.

944
00:57:25,959 --> 00:57:27,799
If the government wastes
money, the country goes bankrupt,

945
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:29,099
and if you spend
more than your means,

946
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:30,970
the family goes
bankrupt. Understand?

947
00:57:31,339 --> 00:57:32,669
I understand...

948
00:57:33,209 --> 00:57:35,370
but don't be so
cheap about food.

949
00:57:35,810 --> 00:57:37,939
Even the government
provides meals for the poor.

950
00:57:40,910 --> 00:57:42,180
Anyway,

951
00:57:42,879 --> 00:57:45,378
we can't afford that toy.

952
00:57:45,379 --> 00:57:47,289
Tae Poong, put that back.

953
00:57:47,620 --> 00:57:51,760
Why? Buy it for me.

954
00:57:52,060 --> 00:57:53,228
It's a dangerous toy.

955
00:57:53,229 --> 00:57:55,128
- Put it back now.
- It's not dangerous.

956
00:57:55,129 --> 00:57:57,898
Buy it for me. Buy
it for me. Please.

957
00:57:57,899 --> 00:57:59,030
No. Give me that.

958
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:03,169
Assemblyman Wi Dae Han, right?

959
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:05,870
My gosh. It really is you.

960
00:58:06,569 --> 00:58:08,910
You're much better
looking in person.

961
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:12,538
I voted for you in the election.

962
00:58:12,539 --> 00:58:13,680
Thank you.

963
00:58:14,780 --> 00:58:18,950
They must be those
kids from the article.

964
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:20,589
Yes, they are.

965
00:58:21,089 --> 00:58:23,289
Come here, kids. Come here.

966
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:26,660
- Try these. How cute.
- Goodness.

967
00:58:27,930 --> 00:58:28,990
Oh my.

968
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:31,300
But...

969
00:58:34,870 --> 00:58:37,998
They're good eaters
since they're still growing.

970
00:58:37,999 --> 00:58:40,039
Yes, they have big appetites.

971
00:58:40,870 --> 00:58:43,640
I was so touched
when I saw that article.

972
00:58:44,010 --> 00:58:47,450
How could you take in
four kids? You are amazing.

973
00:58:47,749 --> 00:58:49,879
I'm not amazing. It's nothing.

974
00:58:50,819 --> 00:58:54,318
Oh my gosh. Do you
even buy them toys?

975
00:58:54,319 --> 00:58:56,589
You're like a real dad already.

976
00:58:57,519 --> 00:58:58,620
My gosh.

977
00:59:00,660 --> 00:59:02,930
Tae Poong, will this do?

978
00:59:03,330 --> 00:59:04,859
Pick out everything you want.

979
00:59:04,999 --> 00:59:06,268
- Do you mean it?
- Of course.

980
00:59:06,269 --> 00:59:08,498
You're so lucky.

981
00:59:08,499 --> 00:59:09,640
Get them all.

982
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:18,640
That will be 387 dollars.

983
00:59:19,979 --> 00:59:21,010
Okay.

984
00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:29,089
(1,936 minus 388
equals 1,548 dollars)

985
00:59:36,359 --> 00:59:38,560
How pretty.

986
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:42,330
Tak, you look like a model too.

987
00:59:52,339 --> 00:59:55,450
Tae Poong, you shouldn't
play with this indoors, right?

988
00:59:55,780 --> 00:59:56,979
- Okay.
- Good.

989
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:05,318
How do I look?

990
01:00:05,319 --> 01:00:08,760
You look pretty, but
isn't the skirt too short?

991
01:00:09,289 --> 01:00:11,660
It is not. This is how
everyone dresses.

992
01:00:13,970 --> 01:00:15,369
How much are they?

993
01:00:15,370 --> 01:00:18,600
With the gym
uniforms, it's 864 dollars.

994
01:00:19,669 --> 01:00:20,839
How... How much?

995
01:00:21,209 --> 01:00:23,080
864 dollars.

996
01:00:25,180 --> 01:00:27,850
What... Why are
school uniforms so...

997
01:00:31,450 --> 01:00:35,450
(1,548 minus 864
equals 684 dollars)

998
01:00:36,149 --> 01:00:37,688
We don't need the gym uniforms.

999
01:00:37,689 --> 01:00:39,369
We can wear the ones
from our old schools.

1000
01:00:40,189 --> 01:00:42,999
No. That's not the problem.

1001
01:00:44,030 --> 01:00:45,930
How can poor kids go to school?

1002
01:00:47,030 --> 01:00:49,769
The state our country is in...

1003
01:00:53,269 --> 01:00:54,539
Can I do a payment plan?

1004
01:00:55,069 --> 01:00:57,609
- 60 months, please.
- We can only do up to 6.

1005
01:00:58,680 --> 01:00:59,780
Fine.

1006
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:02,780
I'll make it six months.

1007
01:01:03,749 --> 01:01:06,080
Hey. Of all the...

1008
01:01:06,550 --> 01:01:07,789
No. What's up?

1009
01:01:07,950 --> 01:01:09,890
Did you see the article?

1010
01:01:10,359 --> 01:01:11,418
What does it say?

1011
01:01:11,419 --> 01:01:14,030
Da Jung's uncle must
have met with the reporter...

1012
01:01:14,260 --> 01:01:17,128
and told him that you
kicked out the kids at first.

1013
01:01:17,129 --> 01:01:19,499
What? What do you mean?

1014
01:01:20,169 --> 01:01:23,470
Hold on. What...
How... What is it?

1015
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:28,069
Mister. I don't see Tae Poong.

1016
01:01:45,819 --> 01:01:46,830
Tae Poong!

1017
01:01:48,859 --> 01:01:49,930
Tae Poong!

1018
01:02:11,550 --> 01:02:13,019
Tae Poong!

1019
01:02:15,189 --> 01:02:16,220
Tae Poong!

1020
01:02:17,959 --> 01:02:19,019
Tae Poong!

1021
01:02:22,459 --> 01:02:23,530
No!

1022
01:02:31,300 --> 01:02:32,370
Tae Poong!

1023
01:02:36,539 --> 01:02:37,580
Mister.

1024
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:41,649
Mister! Wake up! Mister!

1025
01:02:43,479 --> 01:02:44,620
Oh no.

1026
01:03:15,109 --> 01:03:18,580
(The Great Show)

1027
01:03:18,749 --> 01:03:21,049
After a video of Assemblyman
Wi saving the youngest brother...

1028
01:03:21,050 --> 01:03:22,849
of a high school girl
was posted online...

1029
01:03:22,850 --> 01:03:24,490
- You're a man of dignity.
- I was...

1030
01:03:24,620 --> 01:03:27,560
hit by a city bus this big.

1031
01:03:27,990 --> 01:03:30,159
The people are calling
you "National Dad" online.

1032
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:31,998
You were selected to be
the new liberal panelist.

1033
01:03:31,999 --> 01:03:33,370
Maybe I was meant
to be an actor.

1034
01:03:34,470 --> 01:03:37,399
Let's meet until I collect
all the stamps on this.

1035
01:03:37,870 --> 01:03:39,739
Get over here! I
can't control my rage.

1036
01:03:39,740 --> 01:03:41,260
It's right to be
enraged at injustice.

1037
01:03:42,370 --> 01:03:43,680
- What?
- Song Yi's gone.

1038
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:45,240
Song Yi!

1039
01:03:46,140 --> 01:03:48,249
Song Yi!
