00:00:16,965 --> 00:00:18,495
(All characters, organizations, places, entities, and events...)

2
00:00:18,495 --> 00:00:19,971
(in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:32,457 --> 00:00:34,132
Darn it. Who is it?

4
00:00:36,428 --> 00:00:37,602
Who is this?

5
00:00:37,928 --> 00:00:39,973
Punk. You're so snippy.

6
00:00:40,267 --> 00:00:41,613
It's your dad, punk.

7
00:00:44,968 --> 00:00:46,282
You've grown a lot since.

8
00:00:48,338 --> 00:00:51,123
You're getting better looking because you take after me.

9
00:00:53,618 --> 00:00:55,693
Punk. Cat got your tongue?

10
00:00:56,447 --> 00:00:58,822
It's been two years. Aren't you happy to see me?

11
00:01:00,148 --> 00:01:02,532
We're here. This is it.

12
00:01:06,827 --> 00:01:09,003
It's much better than when you lived with me.

13
00:01:11,527 --> 00:01:14,372
It must be nice living in a place like this.

14
00:01:25,508 --> 00:01:26,682
Here comes the man of the hour.

15
00:01:27,618 --> 00:01:29,852
You haven't eaten yet, right? Come eat.

16
00:01:31,917 --> 00:01:33,022
Come in.

17
00:01:34,318 --> 00:01:35,492
Is someone here?

18
00:01:39,588 --> 00:01:41,173
- Daddy! - Daddy!

19
00:01:57,848 --> 00:02:00,723
Hello, I'm Han Dong Nam. I'm their dad.

20
00:02:01,348 --> 00:02:02,423
Hello.

21
00:02:21,238 --> 00:02:24,142
Vietnamese food just didn't agree with me.

22
00:02:24,807 --> 00:02:27,153
Thank you for the feast.

23
00:02:27,377 --> 00:02:28,552
My pleasure.

24
00:02:29,678 --> 00:02:32,952
Sure. Food is the biggest problem when you're abroad.

25
00:02:33,247 --> 00:02:35,452
How did you end up in Vietnam?

26
00:02:36,048 --> 00:02:39,493
I owe quite a bit to loan sharks.

27
00:02:39,817 --> 00:02:43,463
I thought I'd just be a burden on the kids if I stayed in Korea.

28
00:02:43,988 --> 00:02:46,362
A friend had a business in Vietnam,

29
00:02:46,657 --> 00:02:47,933
so I went over there.

30
00:02:48,057 --> 00:02:50,273
I worked like crazy and paid off my debt...

31
00:02:50,497 --> 00:02:53,403
and wanted to be a good dad that I couldn't be.

32
00:02:55,268 --> 00:02:58,213
When did you return to Korea?

33
00:02:58,807 --> 00:03:00,382
I came today.

34
00:03:02,178 --> 00:03:03,922
Are there no phones in Vietnam?

35
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:06,552
You could've called from there.

36
00:03:07,118 --> 00:03:10,463
How could I call you after what I did?

37
00:03:10,747 --> 00:03:14,493
I was of no help and just a burden to you.

38
00:03:15,858 --> 00:03:17,033
Didn't you know...

39
00:03:18,627 --> 00:03:20,332
Mom passed away?

40
00:03:22,097 --> 00:03:26,773
I found out when I saw you and Assemblyman Wi on the news.

41
00:03:28,898 --> 00:03:30,343
Your kind mom...

42
00:03:31,668 --> 00:03:35,437
died like that because she met someone like me.

43
00:03:35,437 --> 00:03:37,482
I feel like it's all my fault.

44
00:03:38,407 --> 00:03:40,952
I'm so sorry, kids.

45
00:03:46,347 --> 00:03:50,132
Everyone makes mistakes.

46
00:03:52,088 --> 00:03:56,132
You can do well from now on as you live with them.

47
00:03:57,828 --> 00:04:00,738
Sure, I want to live with them too.

48
00:04:00,738 --> 00:04:03,072
I am their dad after all.

49
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:07,813
As in...

50
00:04:08,877 --> 00:04:12,352
you can't live with them right now?

51
00:04:13,717 --> 00:04:14,892
That's right.

52
00:04:16,378 --> 00:04:19,963
If I stay here, the loan sharks will keep coming.

53
00:04:20,518 --> 00:04:22,992
Vietnam is a land of opportunities.

54
00:04:23,318 --> 00:04:27,033
I should go back to make money after 3 or 4 days.

55
00:04:27,427 --> 00:04:30,542
Daddy, do you have to go back to Vietnam?

56
00:04:31,797 --> 00:04:32,872
Yes.

57
00:04:33,198 --> 00:04:37,073
Daddy will make lots of money and come back, okay?

58
00:04:38,338 --> 00:04:41,153
Then what about the kids?

59
00:04:43,847 --> 00:04:48,122
I know I'm shameless, but please take good care of them.

60
00:04:48,477 --> 00:04:51,463
I'll do whatever it takes to get back on my feet...

61
00:04:51,987 --> 00:04:53,663
and come for them.

62
00:04:53,987 --> 00:04:56,458
No! Don't go!

63
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:59,502
Live here with us!

64
00:05:00,828 --> 00:05:04,297
I can't live here. This isn't our house.

65
00:05:04,297 --> 00:05:09,343
Mister, let Daddy live here with us.

66
00:05:09,537 --> 00:05:11,883
We can all live together.

67
00:05:12,037 --> 00:05:14,277
Please.

68
00:05:14,277 --> 00:05:16,153
Tae Poong. In exchange,

69
00:05:16,537 --> 00:05:20,083
I'll stick right by your side while I'm in Korea.

70
00:05:20,107 --> 00:05:23,922
Please, don't go.

71
00:05:24,117 --> 00:05:28,558
Do you have a place to stay?

72
00:05:28,558 --> 00:05:32,203
No, I couldn't really find a place, so...

73
00:05:33,188 --> 00:05:36,432
Let me crash here with you for a few days.

74
00:05:37,427 --> 00:05:38,602
That's okay, right?

75
00:05:45,907 --> 00:05:47,777
(Episode 8)

76
00:05:47,777 --> 00:05:51,023
(Episode 8: Qualifications of a Dad)

77
00:05:52,648 --> 00:05:54,422
So he was in Vietnam.

78
00:05:55,547 --> 00:05:57,763
He's a pathological liar.

79
00:05:58,047 --> 00:05:59,292
I don't believe him.

80
00:06:00,347 --> 00:06:02,763
It's suspicious how he came without any bags.

81
00:06:03,828 --> 00:06:06,133
Maybe he was gambling somewhere again.

82
00:06:06,927 --> 00:06:08,033
Are you okay?

83
00:06:09,258 --> 00:06:10,333
With what?

84
00:06:11,268 --> 00:06:14,612
It's shocking enough for me with his sudden arrival.

85
00:06:15,998 --> 00:06:17,583
It must be worse for you.

86
00:06:20,777 --> 00:06:23,312
What could I do? I have to be optimistic.

87
00:06:23,977 --> 00:06:25,453
I don't like it,

88
00:06:26,308 --> 00:06:28,352
but he's my siblings' dad.

89
00:06:30,148 --> 00:06:32,463
Song Yi and Tae Poong are so happy.

90
00:06:33,547 --> 00:06:35,992
I'm just glad he's healthy.

91
00:06:38,388 --> 00:06:40,463
How are you so mature?

92
00:06:40,927 --> 00:06:42,602
You surprise me every day.

93
00:06:45,068 --> 00:06:47,297
She saw how hard it was for her mom,

94
00:06:47,297 --> 00:06:48,898
so she should get an abortion.

95
00:06:48,898 --> 00:06:51,242
How does she plan to raise the baby?

96
00:06:52,338 --> 00:06:55,252
Why didn't you stop her more forcefully?

97
00:06:57,378 --> 00:06:59,083
I tried.

98
00:06:59,777 --> 00:07:01,992
I tried scaring her and pacifying her,

99
00:07:02,347 --> 00:07:03,653
but she won't listen.

100
00:07:04,987 --> 00:07:08,232
Gosh. Da Jung is so stubborn.

101
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:11,203
She's a stubborn mule like her mom.

102
00:07:14,297 --> 00:07:17,372
Did Da Jung's mom ever say anything...

103
00:07:19,198 --> 00:07:21,312
about me?

104
00:07:21,998 --> 00:07:23,143
About you?

105
00:07:23,398 --> 00:07:26,482
Yes. I'm Da Jung's biological dad after all,

106
00:07:27,138 --> 00:07:29,383
so I thought perhaps she spoke about me.

107
00:07:31,607 --> 00:07:32,682
I don't think so.

108
00:07:33,547 --> 00:07:35,122
I didn't ask either,

109
00:07:36,018 --> 00:07:38,593
but I don't think she said much.

110
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:46,232
You are Da Jung's biological dad, right?

111
00:07:51,628 --> 00:07:54,143
Yes, of course. Who else would it be?

112
00:07:54,568 --> 00:07:56,442
That's what the paternity test said.

113
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:01,653
Right? I asked a silly question.

114
00:08:03,338 --> 00:08:06,182
I'm glad Da Jung found her dad.

115
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:08,893
Since you're here anyway,

116
00:08:09,018 --> 00:08:11,893
please make yourself at home while you're here.

117
00:08:13,217 --> 00:08:14,432
Thank you so much.

118
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:19,427
Da Jung is one thing, but the other kids are total strangers to you.

119
00:08:19,427 --> 00:08:21,672
Thank you for taking such good care of them.

120
00:08:22,758 --> 00:08:25,167
I don't know how I will ever repay you.

121
00:08:25,167 --> 00:08:26,942
There's no need.

122
00:08:28,498 --> 00:08:31,942
To be honest, I'm receiving much more from the kids...

123
00:08:32,538 --> 00:08:34,552
than I'm giving them.

124
00:08:36,038 --> 00:08:39,753
You really are magnanimous since you're a politician.

125
00:08:42,347 --> 00:08:45,863
That's why I'm saying this, but...

126
00:08:46,667 --> 00:08:47,813
Yes?

127
00:08:47,838 --> 00:08:49,982
At least while I'm with the kids,

128
00:08:50,567 --> 00:08:53,338
I'd like to be a good dad.

129
00:08:53,338 --> 00:08:54,978
Sure, of course, you should.

130
00:08:54,978 --> 00:08:57,478
Who knows when you'll see them again once you leave for Vietnam?

131
00:08:57,478 --> 00:08:58,923
But the thing is,

132
00:08:59,378 --> 00:09:02,163
I'm penniless, as you can see.

133
00:09:03,218 --> 00:09:04,963
I'm really sorry,

134
00:09:05,017 --> 00:09:08,362
but may I borrow some money?

135
00:09:08,557 --> 00:09:09,703
Money?

136
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:14,367
Sorry,

137
00:09:14,368 --> 00:09:16,903
but I don't have any cash on me.

138
00:09:16,968 --> 00:09:19,368
Who carries cash nowadays?

139
00:09:19,368 --> 00:09:21,242
You can give me a credit card.

140
00:09:21,508 --> 00:09:22,882
A credit card?

141
00:09:23,338 --> 00:09:26,012
I'll use it for a few days while I'm in Korea.

142
00:09:26,238 --> 00:09:28,352
Can you do that for me?

143
00:09:30,078 --> 00:09:31,423
Well,

144
00:09:31,478 --> 00:09:35,017
I have only one credit card.

145
00:09:35,017 --> 00:09:37,817
Then you should use it.

146
00:09:37,817 --> 00:09:39,433
Sorry.

147
00:09:40,588 --> 00:09:42,433
What about a cash advance?

148
00:09:47,598 --> 00:09:49,943
A cash advance?

149
00:09:50,498 --> 00:09:52,468
Well, then...

150
00:09:52,468 --> 00:09:55,368
I have a debit card. I can give you that.

151
00:09:55,368 --> 00:09:56,583
Just a minute.

152
00:10:00,277 --> 00:10:02,122
- Here you go. - Thank you.

153
00:10:04,248 --> 00:10:06,078
Within the limit, please.

154
00:10:06,078 --> 00:10:09,262
Of course. Thank you.

155
00:10:13,817 --> 00:10:16,287
Stay here while your dad's here.

156
00:10:16,287 --> 00:10:17,903
You're pregnant.

157
00:10:18,258 --> 00:10:20,803
I hate people who burden others,

158
00:10:20,927 --> 00:10:22,667
but that has been me recently.

159
00:10:22,667 --> 00:10:24,937
I'm super hurt right now.

160
00:10:24,937 --> 00:10:26,342
Am I a stranger?

161
00:10:27,167 --> 00:10:30,238
Fine. That's all I am to you, is that it?

162
00:10:30,238 --> 00:10:31,913
That's not it, but...

163
00:10:32,277 --> 00:10:36,722
To be blunt, I'm not your real sister.

164
00:10:37,848 --> 00:10:39,622
I know you're nice,

165
00:10:39,817 --> 00:10:41,022
but...

166
00:10:41,718 --> 00:10:44,063
you're just so nice to me.

167
00:10:45,557 --> 00:10:48,758
Hey. You're determined to hurt my feelings,

168
00:10:48,758 --> 00:10:50,262
aren't you?

169
00:10:50,828 --> 00:10:54,128
Hey. You don't need to share blood to be sisters.

170
00:10:54,128 --> 00:10:57,372
No, of course not. We don't,

171
00:10:57,667 --> 00:11:01,443
but I wondered if there was another reason.

172
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:05,053
Another reason? Like what?

173
00:11:06,138 --> 00:11:07,653
Do you...

174
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:12,153
like Mr. Wi?

175
00:11:13,378 --> 00:11:15,718
What? I do not.

176
00:11:15,718 --> 00:11:18,293
I have high standards. Why would I like him?

177
00:11:18,758 --> 00:11:22,057
True. You're way too good for him.

178
00:11:22,057 --> 00:11:23,433
That's right.

179
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:26,272
Eat up.

180
00:11:32,868 --> 00:11:34,012
Da Jung.

181
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:42,583
How is it, living with Mr. Wi? Is he good to you?

182
00:11:42,947 --> 00:11:45,348
Yes. He even took us to an amusement park.

183
00:11:45,348 --> 00:11:46,522
He did?

184
00:11:46,978 --> 00:11:49,588
Mr. Wi is good to us,

185
00:11:49,588 --> 00:11:51,858
but I like you more, Daddy.

186
00:11:51,858 --> 00:11:53,657
That's a given.

187
00:11:53,657 --> 00:11:57,433
No matter how nice he is to you, he isn't Daddy.

188
00:11:57,557 --> 00:12:02,443
But if you make lots of money...

189
00:12:02,468 --> 00:12:06,242
and live with us, what happens to Da Jung?

190
00:12:07,868 --> 00:12:09,667
Da Jung...

191
00:12:09,667 --> 00:12:12,978
has her dad and her boyfriend.

192
00:12:12,978 --> 00:12:14,953
She'll take care of herself.

193
00:12:15,608 --> 00:12:18,752
Anyway, what's up with Tak?

194
00:12:19,047 --> 00:12:21,547
He hasn't seen me in years, but he was so cold.

195
00:12:21,547 --> 00:12:25,533
Tak stabbed his friend in the leg with his pencil.

196
00:12:25,758 --> 00:12:28,663
Goodness. That boy and his temper.

197
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:33,073
But that's better than getting beat up.

198
00:12:34,828 --> 00:12:36,742
I heard they're having a school violence committee meeting.

199
00:12:37,128 --> 00:12:38,667
Whatever.

200
00:12:38,667 --> 00:12:42,443
I was already annoyed, but that tool had to show up. I'm so fed up

201
00:12:42,608 --> 00:12:44,577
"That tool"? Who?

202
00:12:44,578 --> 00:12:46,953
Just someone. A total dirtbag.

203
00:12:59,218 --> 00:13:01,286
She must be stressed out...

204
00:13:01,287 --> 00:13:03,333
because she suddenly has two dads.

205
00:13:04,187 --> 00:13:05,803
Two dads.

206
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:09,102
It must be hard enough for her as is.

207
00:13:15,838 --> 00:13:17,783
Are you okay, Da Jung?

208
00:13:18,508 --> 00:13:20,982
Yes, I feel better now.

209
00:13:21,078 --> 00:13:22,183
Good.

210
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:25,218
Did you just say something to me?

211
00:13:25,218 --> 00:13:26,323
What?

212
00:13:28,118 --> 00:13:29,588
I was talking to myself.

213
00:13:29,588 --> 00:13:33,232
It became a habit because I've been living alone for so long.

214
00:13:38,128 --> 00:13:39,232
(Kang Joon Ho)

215
00:13:42,468 --> 00:13:43,872
Hello, Mr. Kang.

216
00:13:45,297 --> 00:13:47,713
What? You're out front?

217
00:13:52,378 --> 00:13:53,713
Mr. Kang.

218
00:13:53,738 --> 00:13:55,978
What brings you here?

219
00:13:55,978 --> 00:13:58,417
I know it's rude of me to drop by like this,

220
00:13:58,417 --> 00:13:59,992
but we need to celebrate.

221
00:14:00,277 --> 00:14:01,862
Celebrate?

222
00:14:02,248 --> 00:14:03,947
It's the first time in my life...

223
00:14:03,947 --> 00:14:05,017
What?

224
00:14:05,017 --> 00:14:07,262
The first time I won a doll from a claw machine.

225
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:13,632
So, what you want to celebrate is...

226
00:14:14,368 --> 00:14:15,602
Yes, this.

227
00:14:20,338 --> 00:14:24,777
Is it all right for me to take this meaningful memento?

228
00:14:24,777 --> 00:14:26,153
Of course, it is.

229
00:14:26,307 --> 00:14:28,878
If you insist on thanking me,

230
00:14:28,878 --> 00:14:31,122
you can buy me canned coffee at a convenience store.

231
00:14:34,447 --> 00:14:37,862
Sorry, but I have a guest over.

232
00:14:42,157 --> 00:14:43,933
At this hour? Who...

233
00:14:44,397 --> 00:14:45,732
Da Jung.

234
00:14:46,098 --> 00:14:48,502
She's sleeping over tonight.

235
00:14:50,667 --> 00:14:52,642
Dae Han's daughter is over.

236
00:14:54,567 --> 00:14:55,913
Okay, then.

237
00:14:57,067 --> 00:14:59,083
Thank you for the doll.

238
00:15:00,478 --> 00:15:02,348
Where's Dae Han's house?

239
00:15:02,348 --> 00:15:03,653
Dae Han's house?

240
00:15:04,147 --> 00:15:06,392
Over there.

241
00:15:09,787 --> 00:15:11,758
I see.

242
00:15:11,758 --> 00:15:15,903
He lives super close to you.

243
00:15:19,328 --> 00:15:22,667
So you gave him your debit card?

244
00:15:22,667 --> 00:15:26,642
He's a total thief. All he needs is a knife.

245
00:15:26,767 --> 00:15:28,342
It's for the best.

246
00:15:28,838 --> 00:15:29,838
Why?

247
00:15:29,838 --> 00:15:32,083
If he uses my card, I can locate him.

248
00:15:32,508 --> 00:15:35,583
He doesn't seem to know I'm not Da Jung's real dad.

249
00:15:35,777 --> 00:15:38,222
He's very suspicious.

250
00:15:38,317 --> 00:15:40,848
It's a total lie that he was in Vietnam.

251
00:15:40,848 --> 00:15:43,193
Where do you think he was all this time?

252
00:15:44,388 --> 00:15:45,758
Who knows?

253
00:15:45,758 --> 00:15:48,388
He may have caused trouble and spent time in the slammer.

254
00:15:48,388 --> 00:15:51,102
No way. He used to be a detective.

255
00:15:52,197 --> 00:15:54,673
He was formerly a corrupt detective to be exact.

256
00:15:56,468 --> 00:15:58,967
It's so frustrating.

257
00:15:58,968 --> 00:16:01,967
We can't make headway with the low-income apartments,

258
00:16:01,968 --> 00:16:04,578
and Da Jung is going to school while she's pregnant,

259
00:16:04,578 --> 00:16:06,078
Tak assaulted a kid at school,

260
00:16:06,078 --> 00:16:08,946
and now, the kids' dad shows up.

261
00:16:08,947 --> 00:16:11,423
You should seriously get an exorcism or something.

262
00:16:12,677 --> 00:16:15,492
Danger is an opportunity.

263
00:16:15,848 --> 00:16:17,958
The low-income apartments, Tak's assault,

264
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:19,693
and Soo Hyun's dad's restaurant.

265
00:16:20,358 --> 00:16:22,533
Jae Yoon's mom is involved with them all.

266
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:25,027
So,

267
00:16:25,027 --> 00:16:28,272
you'll kill three birds with one stone, is that it?

268
00:16:29,368 --> 00:16:31,002
You're so quick.

269
00:16:31,368 --> 00:16:33,238
Anyway, I'll take care of that.

270
00:16:33,238 --> 00:16:35,067
You dig into Han Dong Nam.

271
00:16:35,067 --> 00:16:38,177
It's the best-case scenario for me if the dad could take the kids.

272
00:16:38,177 --> 00:16:39,752
Okay.

273
00:16:57,588 --> 00:16:59,333
Seriously.

274
00:17:07,138 --> 00:17:08,207
Are you up?

275
00:17:08,207 --> 00:17:09,383
Yes.

276
00:17:10,568 --> 00:17:14,477
You were sound asleep, so I didn't wake you.

277
00:17:14,477 --> 00:17:17,322
Yes. I didn't sleep well last night.

278
00:17:17,507 --> 00:17:19,722
You didn't have to make breakfast.

279
00:17:20,348 --> 00:17:23,423
I may not look it, but I'm a very good cook.

280
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:40,368
What's wrong? Do you not like it?

281
00:17:40,368 --> 00:17:43,542
No, no. It's delicious.

282
00:17:43,768 --> 00:17:47,353
Daddy. That spoon and those chopsticks are Mr. Wi's.

283
00:17:49,078 --> 00:17:51,518
Oh no. I'm sorry. I'll wash them right now.

284
00:17:51,518 --> 00:17:52,778
It's okay.

285
00:17:52,778 --> 00:17:55,818
There's no such thing as yours or mine. Just use them.

286
00:17:55,818 --> 00:17:59,633
True. It's all the same thing as long as you can eat with them.

287
00:18:05,558 --> 00:18:08,666
So, was it okay staying at Soo Hyun's?

288
00:18:08,667 --> 00:18:10,667
I slept very well,

289
00:18:10,667 --> 00:18:14,512
but I feel bad. I feel like I'm always burdening her.

290
00:18:15,737 --> 00:18:17,308
That's true.

291
00:18:17,308 --> 00:18:19,578
Even if you are close, you're not family.

292
00:18:19,578 --> 00:18:22,353
You'd be a nuisance if you stayed there.

293
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:25,177
What nuisance?

294
00:18:25,177 --> 00:18:28,647
You should help each other out. That's what society is built on.

295
00:18:28,647 --> 00:18:31,193
That lady seemed nice.

296
00:18:32,457 --> 00:18:35,187
Anyway, you couldn't rest well even on the weekends...

297
00:18:35,187 --> 00:18:37,562
because you were busy watching the kids.

298
00:18:39,028 --> 00:18:41,203
Well, that's true.

299
00:18:41,257 --> 00:18:44,673
This weekend, I will take care of them as their father...

300
00:18:44,868 --> 00:18:46,143
so you can take care of your business.

301
00:18:48,007 --> 00:18:49,082
Sure.

302
00:18:53,578 --> 00:18:55,953
Da Jung seems to have really bad morning sickness.

303
00:18:56,308 --> 00:18:59,792
I know you are busy, but keep an eye on her.

304
00:18:59,917 --> 00:19:01,818
I'm so glad you're with me.

305
00:19:01,818 --> 00:19:03,963
So, what do you think of the children's father?

306
00:19:04,187 --> 00:19:06,187
He doesn't seem so bad.

307
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:08,762
It's not just bad people that become bad fathers.

308
00:19:09,288 --> 00:19:10,933
He asked me for my credit card...

309
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:12,933
so he can be a good dad.

310
00:19:13,657 --> 00:19:14,843
What? Credit card?

311
00:19:15,427 --> 00:19:16,903
What's his plan?

312
00:19:17,268 --> 00:19:19,913
He asked me to take care of them until he can afford to do so.

313
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:21,582
What about Da Jung?

314
00:19:22,207 --> 00:19:24,242
Who is she going to live with then?

315
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:28,012
I don't have the time to think about things that haven't happened yet.

316
00:19:29,308 --> 00:19:31,992
- Are they fighting? - What's going on?

317
00:19:32,118 --> 00:19:34,193
- Shouldn't we stop them? - What happened?

318
00:19:34,618 --> 00:19:36,463
- Oh no! - They are fighting!

319
00:19:36,747 --> 00:19:39,457
- You ruined my business! - Oh!

320
00:19:39,457 --> 00:19:40,562
- Ma'am! - Come on.

321
00:19:41,657 --> 00:19:43,858
- You need to calm down. - I won't let this go.

322
00:19:43,858 --> 00:19:45,802
- Get out of my way! - Please calm down.

323
00:19:47,558 --> 00:19:48,703
- My gosh! - Come here!

324
00:19:50,927 --> 00:19:53,368
- Darn it! - Why are you doing this?

325
00:19:53,368 --> 00:19:54,472
You need to calm down.

326
00:19:55,338 --> 00:19:58,078
I see that you called for backup because you were outnumbered.

327
00:19:58,078 --> 00:19:59,982
This is insane.

328
00:20:00,177 --> 00:20:03,977
This is why you shouldn't deal with people with no class.

329
00:20:03,977 --> 00:20:07,048
What did you say? Have you not had enough?

330
00:20:07,048 --> 00:20:08,647
- What? - You wait there.

331
00:20:08,647 --> 00:20:12,088
I am going to make sure you never speak again!

332
00:20:12,088 --> 00:20:13,593
- Mom! - Mi Sook!

333
00:20:17,358 --> 00:20:19,332
- No! - Calm down!

334
00:20:20,798 --> 00:20:21,868
How ignorant!

335
00:20:21,868 --> 00:20:25,673
I am the crazy one to think that I can settle with you.

336
00:20:25,937 --> 00:20:27,937
You wait there.

337
00:20:27,937 --> 00:20:31,143
I am not going to let this go easy.

338
00:20:31,308 --> 00:20:32,383
- Come back here! - Get out of the way!

339
00:20:34,378 --> 00:20:35,522
Calm down.

340
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:40,792
What just happened?

341
00:20:41,548 --> 00:20:46,518
Jae Yoon's mom just came.

342
00:20:46,518 --> 00:20:48,663
She said she would delete the post...

343
00:20:48,957 --> 00:20:51,302
if we support the international school.

344
00:20:51,528 --> 00:20:52,933
Now she is showing her true colors.

345
00:20:52,997 --> 00:20:55,143
But you know your mom's temper.

346
00:20:55,467 --> 00:20:57,667
She started yelling, "Nonsense!"

347
00:20:57,667 --> 00:21:00,497
Then she pulled her by the hair.

348
00:21:00,497 --> 00:21:04,613
Then what? Should I have just said "Sure, why not?"

349
00:21:06,207 --> 00:21:08,278
Your father, on the other hand, was very tempted.

350
00:21:08,278 --> 00:21:09,707
He said, "Really?"

351
00:21:09,707 --> 00:21:12,353
If I had the chance, his mouth would've been the first thing to...

352
00:21:12,848 --> 00:21:13,923
Really?

353
00:21:14,888 --> 00:21:16,663
I didn't think of you as such a person.

354
00:21:17,518 --> 00:21:21,288
Come on. It's our livelihoods on the line.

355
00:21:21,288 --> 00:21:23,487
It was my instinct speaking.

356
00:21:23,487 --> 00:21:27,032
Even so. If it's wrong, it's wrong.

357
00:21:27,598 --> 00:21:29,943
Yes. Mom is right.

358
00:21:30,667 --> 00:21:32,812
But seriously, that woman needs to be stopped.

359
00:21:33,197 --> 00:21:36,113
How can she threaten people's livelihoods like that?

360
00:21:37,138 --> 00:21:39,977
Since all of this started with me,

361
00:21:39,977 --> 00:21:41,752
I will make sure to take care of it.

362
00:21:43,007 --> 00:21:44,782
Do you have a solution?

363
00:21:45,078 --> 00:21:48,318
That one-man broadcast didn't seem to have any effect at all.

364
00:21:48,318 --> 00:21:50,463
Just give it some time.

365
00:21:50,717 --> 00:21:53,762
I think it's getting there. Comments are positive too.

366
00:21:54,388 --> 00:21:55,863
That wouldn't be enough.

367
00:21:56,058 --> 00:21:58,397
Just today, she threatened...

368
00:21:58,397 --> 00:22:00,673
to post what happened today on the website.

369
00:22:01,157 --> 00:22:05,537
I found out that a group of mothers who left her website...

370
00:22:05,538 --> 00:22:06,967
formed a different community online.

371
00:22:06,967 --> 00:22:09,242
- It's called "Inju Good Mom." - "Inju Good Bomb?"

372
00:22:10,338 --> 00:22:11,782
Mom, not bomb.

373
00:22:12,437 --> 00:22:14,183
Anyway, I am going to meet some of them.

374
00:22:15,447 --> 00:22:16,577
That sounds like a good idea.

375
00:22:16,578 --> 00:22:20,153
I am sure they have some dirt on her.

376
00:22:21,447 --> 00:22:22,593
- Right. - Oh.

377
00:22:23,118 --> 00:22:25,762
The enemy of your enemy can be your friend.

378
00:22:29,427 --> 00:22:30,802
Hold on, hold on.

379
00:22:31,128 --> 00:22:34,272
Look at your shoes. How tacky.

380
00:22:34,727 --> 00:22:38,843
All right. I will buy you both a new pair of shoes!

381
00:22:39,237 --> 00:22:41,298
- Okay? - Okay!

382
00:22:41,298 --> 00:22:44,982
Dad, can't you just live with us?

383
00:22:45,207 --> 00:22:47,312
You can earn money here.

384
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:49,222
There is no job for me here.

385
00:22:49,647 --> 00:22:52,048
I will try to visit you as often as I can.

386
00:22:52,048 --> 00:22:54,853
How often? Once a week?

387
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:57,663
We'll see.

388
00:23:00,588 --> 00:23:01,703
Hey.

389
00:23:02,058 --> 00:23:04,762
Why do you look so down since yesterday?

390
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:08,002
You thought I would like it...

391
00:23:08,227 --> 00:23:10,302
when you suddenly reappear after ignoring us for two years?

392
00:23:11,467 --> 00:23:12,643
What?

393
00:23:12,937 --> 00:23:14,343
Did I say something wrong?

394
00:23:14,967 --> 00:23:17,443
Why you little...

395
00:23:17,737 --> 00:23:20,113
How dare you look me straight in the eye?

396
00:23:21,407 --> 00:23:22,953
You rude punk.

397
00:23:23,977 --> 00:23:25,693
Are you trying to start something with me?

398
00:23:27,217 --> 00:23:28,693
You think I am worthless, don't you?

399
00:23:31,217 --> 00:23:33,133
Now that Wi Dae Han is your father,

400
00:23:33,858 --> 00:23:36,603
you don't think of me as your father, do you?

401
00:23:38,157 --> 00:23:40,302
If you can't take responsibility, you shouldn't have had us.

402
00:23:48,808 --> 00:23:49,883
It's fine.

403
00:23:50,638 --> 00:23:51,883
Everything will be fine.

404
00:23:52,977 --> 00:23:55,322
No need to be scared.

405
00:23:55,977 --> 00:23:58,183
I think you are more scared than I am.

406
00:23:58,947 --> 00:24:01,893
No way. I am not scared at all.

407
00:24:07,618 --> 00:24:09,002
Please take a look at the screen.

408
00:24:10,727 --> 00:24:13,002
The fetal sac got a lot bigger than before.

409
00:24:13,757 --> 00:24:16,502
You can see that the baby grew too.

410
00:24:17,967 --> 00:24:19,873
- What do you think? - What?

411
00:24:20,737 --> 00:24:22,413
How does it feel to see our baby for the first time?

412
00:24:24,608 --> 00:24:26,183
It's unbelievable.

413
00:24:27,578 --> 00:24:30,953
So, is that beating thing...

414
00:24:31,147 --> 00:24:33,393
Yes, it's the baby's heart.

415
00:24:33,778 --> 00:24:35,822
Now I will let you listen to the baby's heartbeat.

416
00:24:48,328 --> 00:24:50,943
The baby is very healthy and strong.

417
00:24:56,737 --> 00:24:58,982
- Enjoy. - Thank you.

418
00:25:03,947 --> 00:25:06,022
How's school?

419
00:25:06,518 --> 00:25:07,853
Yes. It's perfect.

420
00:25:08,487 --> 00:25:09,593
Really?

421
00:25:10,318 --> 00:25:12,433
Aren't the other kids bullying you or anything like that?

422
00:25:14,417 --> 00:25:15,903
They don't bully me, exactly.

423
00:25:18,227 --> 00:25:20,032
Some just glare at me sometimes.

424
00:25:21,397 --> 00:25:24,472
Who? Who dares to do such a thing?

425
00:25:25,338 --> 00:25:26,972
No need to get so angry.

426
00:25:28,437 --> 00:25:30,512
I understand them too.

427
00:25:32,108 --> 00:25:35,153
They must be totally stressed out with the college entrance exam.

428
00:25:36,548 --> 00:25:39,222
Having a pregnant classmate must be really annoying.

429
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:42,393
I would be if I were them.

430
00:25:43,848 --> 00:25:46,693
Right. I have something for you and our baby.

431
00:25:48,018 --> 00:25:49,963
- What is it? - Here.

432
00:25:53,427 --> 00:25:55,502
You are always with the baby,

433
00:25:56,197 --> 00:25:57,542
but I can't do that.

434
00:25:57,927 --> 00:25:59,373
I wanted to be with both of you too.

435
00:26:00,338 --> 00:26:02,542
(Voice Memo)

436
00:26:29,528 --> 00:26:30,643
I like it.

437
00:26:32,937 --> 00:26:34,042
Thank you.

438
00:26:36,907 --> 00:26:38,778
Hello, Han Bit Mom.

439
00:26:38,778 --> 00:26:41,653
Thank you for coming. I know you must be really busy.

440
00:26:42,147 --> 00:26:46,453
No problem. I always thought that website had a lot of problems.

441
00:26:47,078 --> 00:26:49,423
That is why I created a new website called "Inju Good Mom."

442
00:26:49,647 --> 00:26:53,193
Could you please tell us in detail what problems there were?

443
00:26:53,558 --> 00:26:56,487
Originally, mommy websites are supposed to be...

444
00:26:56,487 --> 00:26:58,757
a place to share information on raising kids, the area we live in,

445
00:26:58,757 --> 00:27:01,002
or to interact with those with similar interests.

446
00:27:01,197 --> 00:27:02,197
True.

447
00:27:02,197 --> 00:27:04,843
But the managers of "Love Inju"...

448
00:27:05,298 --> 00:27:07,237
use the fact that they have a lot of members...

449
00:27:07,237 --> 00:27:09,113
to gain a lot of unfair benefits.

450
00:27:09,368 --> 00:27:10,613
Unfair benefits?

451
00:27:12,108 --> 00:27:14,812
They secretly demand money from local small business owners...

452
00:27:14,977 --> 00:27:16,977
saying that their stores will be promoted on the website.

453
00:27:16,977 --> 00:27:18,153
I really appreciate it.

454
00:27:20,217 --> 00:27:21,746
You made a wise choice.

455
00:27:21,747 --> 00:27:23,792
You're getting great publicity for this price.

456
00:27:23,848 --> 00:27:27,363
If some stores refuse, the manager posts negative things about them.

457
00:27:28,257 --> 00:27:32,272
And she would delete any comments that refute her opinion.

458
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:38,242
She exploits local business owners? Their lives are hard enough already.

459
00:27:39,197 --> 00:27:41,737
Do you have any proof?

460
00:27:41,737 --> 00:27:44,413
The evidence that they gained some unfair benefits?

461
00:27:44,568 --> 00:27:45,638
Evidence?

462
00:27:45,638 --> 00:27:48,977
Yes. For example, screenshots of those falsely negative posts.

463
00:27:48,977 --> 00:27:54,393
Or any recordings of phone calls you had with the managers, perhaps?

464
00:27:54,417 --> 00:27:56,423
No, I don't.

465
00:28:00,757 --> 00:28:04,163
We would need that to take any legal action.

466
00:28:06,757 --> 00:28:07,873
Well...

467
00:28:09,598 --> 00:28:10,802
Do you remember anything?

468
00:28:11,268 --> 00:28:15,072
You are Tak's father, right?

469
00:28:15,967 --> 00:28:17,282
Yes.

470
00:28:18,167 --> 00:28:20,953
I am his father. Why do you ask?

471
00:28:21,207 --> 00:28:24,252
My son goes to the same middle school as Tak.

472
00:28:24,647 --> 00:28:26,853
And I am on the school violence committee.

473
00:28:27,118 --> 00:28:28,393
Really?

474
00:28:29,118 --> 00:28:32,762
I see. What a coincidence!

475
00:28:33,257 --> 00:28:36,363
I know that my son made a mistake,

476
00:28:36,457 --> 00:28:38,403
but he is a good boy.

477
00:28:38,558 --> 00:28:40,933
I've been worried about Tak being summoned before the committee.

478
00:28:41,128 --> 00:28:43,128
Please, I hope you think well of Tak.

479
00:28:43,128 --> 00:28:44,997
He really is a good kid.

480
00:28:44,997 --> 00:28:46,643
Please, I hope...

481
00:28:47,167 --> 00:28:48,913
I thought you'd get me wrong like this,

482
00:28:49,007 --> 00:28:51,338
so I'm trying to make things clear beforehand.

483
00:28:51,338 --> 00:28:52,338
Sorry?

484
00:28:52,338 --> 00:28:54,707
Jae Yoon's mom might be the assailant...

485
00:28:54,707 --> 00:28:56,623
regarding the mommy website issue,

486
00:28:56,707 --> 00:29:00,052
but she's on the victim's side in Tak's school violence incident.

487
00:29:00,647 --> 00:29:03,348
Both the school and the parents...

488
00:29:03,348 --> 00:29:05,963
are taking the case very seriously.

489
00:29:06,358 --> 00:29:08,903
Of course, I am too.

490
00:29:10,487 --> 00:29:12,858
We're going to listen to both the victim and the assailant...

491
00:29:12,858 --> 00:29:14,472
and make an objective judgment...

492
00:29:14,497 --> 00:29:16,143
to decide what disciplinary action to take,

493
00:29:16,298 --> 00:29:19,242
so you might want to brace yourself.

494
00:29:21,897 --> 00:29:23,683
It will be all right.

495
00:29:23,808 --> 00:29:25,906
Jae Yoon was the one who harassed him first.

496
00:29:25,907 --> 00:29:29,808
Why is everything so complicated?

497
00:29:29,808 --> 00:29:32,193
Should I really perform exorcism like Bong Joo said?

498
00:29:32,917 --> 00:29:34,893
Do you even have the money for that?

499
00:29:35,487 --> 00:29:38,463
You asked for your pay in advance because you were broke.

500
00:29:40,157 --> 00:29:42,403
I didn't actually mean it.

501
00:29:43,128 --> 00:29:44,757
I'm low on money,

502
00:29:44,757 --> 00:29:47,072
but the kids' father is going crazy with my debit card.

503
00:29:49,368 --> 00:29:52,343
You'll have to deal with it. You're the National Dad.

504
00:29:55,967 --> 00:29:57,213
Soo Hyun.

505
00:29:57,838 --> 00:29:58,982
What?

506
00:29:59,907 --> 00:30:01,282
Will you lend me money?

507
00:30:02,247 --> 00:30:03,353
Just a million dollars.

508
00:30:07,578 --> 00:30:09,088
Nice shot, sir.

509
00:30:09,088 --> 00:30:10,247
Nice shot.

510
00:30:10,247 --> 00:30:11,562
You're up, Joon Ho.

511
00:30:12,687 --> 00:30:16,032
I was so shocked after watching the show.

512
00:30:16,487 --> 00:30:17,487
Why?

513
00:30:17,487 --> 00:30:19,098
Wi Dae Han.

514
00:30:19,098 --> 00:30:21,298
How could he say that they are keeping the baby?

515
00:30:21,298 --> 00:30:23,996
And on national TV too.

516
00:30:23,997 --> 00:30:26,638
I know. As if it's anything to brag about.

517
00:30:26,638 --> 00:30:28,967
He's only putting on a show to get the attention.

518
00:30:28,967 --> 00:30:30,707
Then he succeeded.

519
00:30:30,707 --> 00:30:33,552
His name was the top trending keyword all day.

520
00:30:34,108 --> 00:30:36,407
You better try harder.

521
00:30:36,407 --> 00:30:39,923
Your friend is going to be a grandfather soon.

522
00:30:42,348 --> 00:30:44,163
Is that even funny?

523
00:30:44,388 --> 00:30:46,193
Then should I cry?

524
00:30:48,318 --> 00:30:49,463
Oh, nice shot.

525
00:30:49,757 --> 00:30:51,663
- Nice shot. - Nice shot.

526
00:30:52,897 --> 00:30:55,368
Has it ever crossed your mind...

527
00:30:55,368 --> 00:30:56,896
that Joon Ho might not win the general election...

528
00:30:56,897 --> 00:30:58,203
if Wi Dae Han gains more popularity?

529
00:30:58,628 --> 00:31:00,437
I thought you weren't running?

530
00:31:00,437 --> 00:31:02,143
That's my plan,

531
00:31:02,507 --> 00:31:03,967
but you know how stubborn Father is.

532
00:31:03,967 --> 00:31:07,237
Why do you keep dragging Joon Ho into politics?

533
00:31:07,237 --> 00:31:08,977
Politicians only get criticized.

534
00:31:08,977 --> 00:31:11,278
Shouldn't he try to do what I could never achieve?

535
00:31:11,278 --> 00:31:13,118
What couldn't you achieve?

536
00:31:13,118 --> 00:31:14,522
I failed to do so,

537
00:31:15,048 --> 00:31:16,946
but Joon Ho should step foot in it.

538
00:31:16,947 --> 00:31:18,222
The Blue House.

539
00:31:24,223 --> 00:31:29,223

541
00:31:39,237 --> 00:31:42,982
That's a whole different story.

542
00:31:43,608 --> 00:31:45,477
If Joon Ho becomes the president,

543
00:31:45,477 --> 00:31:49,693
He's going to be the most handsome head of state in the whole world.

544
00:31:51,187 --> 00:31:54,732
Does that mean I'll be the First Lady?

545
00:31:56,588 --> 00:31:58,603
Give it a rest, will you?

546
00:31:58,687 --> 00:32:01,572
Give what a rest? We were only saying the truth.

547
00:32:01,798 --> 00:32:04,497
By the way, who is it?

548
00:32:04,497 --> 00:32:05,673
What do you mean?

549
00:32:05,697 --> 00:32:08,697
You said you liked another woman...

550
00:32:08,697 --> 00:32:10,507
instead of lovely Hye Jin here.

551
00:32:10,507 --> 00:32:12,482
Who in the world is it?

552
00:32:12,608 --> 00:32:15,953
Let's stop playing golf together, the four of us.

553
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:30,203
The woman you like,

554
00:32:30,427 --> 00:32:31,762
it's Soo Hyun, isn't it?

555
00:32:33,757 --> 00:32:35,768
I asked Soo Hyun.

556
00:32:35,768 --> 00:32:38,997
I told her I like you and asked if she was interested.

557
00:32:38,997 --> 00:32:41,343
I guess I made a mistake.

558
00:32:41,868 --> 00:32:43,007
What do you mean?

559
00:32:43,007 --> 00:32:45,613
I only stayed friendly towards you because Mother likes you.

560
00:32:46,538 --> 00:32:48,538
I guess I only gave you the wrong impression.

561
00:32:48,538 --> 00:32:49,883
No, you didn't.

562
00:32:50,378 --> 00:32:54,123
I know our feelings aren't mutual. I do, but...

563
00:32:56,217 --> 00:32:57,792
I'm worried about you.

564
00:32:58,687 --> 00:33:00,433
And Soo Hyun too.

565
00:33:01,957 --> 00:33:03,332
What does that mean?

566
00:33:03,858 --> 00:33:07,772
You're too old for casual dates.

567
00:33:07,798 --> 00:33:10,628
Your parents will be expecting you to get married.

568
00:33:10,628 --> 00:33:11,873
But...

569
00:33:12,368 --> 00:33:15,982
will they accept Soo Hyun as your spouse?

570
00:33:17,237 --> 00:33:19,812
I'm going to be the only one who has to struggle...

571
00:33:19,907 --> 00:33:23,582
to fit my parents' standards.

572
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:28,623
I'm not going to do the same when finding my spouse.

573
00:33:32,088 --> 00:33:35,032
What? We aren't the only victims?

574
00:33:36,687 --> 00:33:38,972
I knew it.

575
00:33:39,128 --> 00:33:40,798
I could tell that...

576
00:33:40,798 --> 00:33:43,603
she's the kind of woman who takes advantage all the time.

577
00:33:43,628 --> 00:33:46,538
Since we know the truth,

578
00:33:46,538 --> 00:33:48,397
can't we just take it legally?

579
00:33:48,397 --> 00:33:51,007
The problem is, we don't have the proof.

580
00:33:51,007 --> 00:33:53,538
We could be counter accused of making false accusations.

581
00:33:53,538 --> 00:33:55,413
What kind of law is that?

582
00:33:55,707 --> 00:33:58,308
But now that we know corruption is going on,

583
00:33:58,308 --> 00:34:00,552
we only need to secure the proof.

584
00:34:04,048 --> 00:34:06,562
I guess it's finally my turn to act.

585
00:34:06,788 --> 00:34:07,963
You, Dad?

586
00:34:08,217 --> 00:34:09,763
What will you do?

587
00:34:09,857 --> 00:34:13,098
How can you be that slow when you're a writer?

588
00:34:13,098 --> 00:34:14,973
What do you think?

589
00:34:15,197 --> 00:34:18,697
I'll approach her by pretending to apologize...

590
00:34:18,697 --> 00:34:23,013
and make her admit all the things she's done.

591
00:34:25,107 --> 00:34:27,978
Do you mean you're going to record her in secret?

592
00:34:27,978 --> 00:34:29,407
That's it.

593
00:34:29,407 --> 00:34:32,223
Just like they do in the movies.

594
00:34:32,877 --> 00:34:35,478
That's not a bad plan,

595
00:34:35,478 --> 00:34:37,122
but do you think you can manage it?

596
00:34:37,288 --> 00:34:39,356
You're quite the coward.

597
00:34:39,357 --> 00:34:41,857
Soo Hyun. Don't you worry.

598
00:34:41,857 --> 00:34:44,288
I may be frying chicken now,

599
00:34:44,288 --> 00:34:45,533
but I used to...

600
00:34:45,898 --> 00:34:49,473
dream of being a secret agent like James Bond.

601
00:34:50,598 --> 00:34:52,872
Bond, my foot.

602
00:34:53,067 --> 00:34:54,213
Goodness.

603
00:34:54,623 --> 00:34:56,907
My time has finally come.

604
00:34:56,907 --> 00:35:00,783
I will sacrifice myself to save Inju City.

605
00:35:11,225 --> 00:35:13,371
I can do it. I can.

606
00:35:29,776 --> 00:35:31,976
I knew you'd finally give in.

607
00:35:31,976 --> 00:35:34,790
Why did you have to make it so hard?

608
00:35:35,146 --> 00:35:37,246
I'm so sorry, ma'am.

609
00:35:37,246 --> 00:35:40,686
My wife regrets it very much, as well.

610
00:35:40,686 --> 00:35:43,055
I didn't know how influential you were...

611
00:35:43,055 --> 00:35:46,296
and made a huge mistake.

612
00:35:46,296 --> 00:35:47,695
I'm so sorry.

613
00:35:47,695 --> 00:35:51,341
Did you just realize that?

614
00:35:51,365 --> 00:35:54,641
I heard that...

615
00:35:55,865 --> 00:35:58,135
you also put up posts to slander...

616
00:35:58,135 --> 00:36:00,035
many other restaurants. Am I right?

617
00:36:00,035 --> 00:36:01,810
What are you talking about?

618
00:36:02,575 --> 00:36:05,476
I'm not trying to complain.

619
00:36:05,476 --> 00:36:09,860
I was just trying to say that you have that much power.

620
00:36:10,146 --> 00:36:13,091
Do you know how many members our website has?

621
00:36:13,516 --> 00:36:15,860
Don't mess around with me.

622
00:36:15,885 --> 00:36:19,330
I know. I should've known better.

623
00:36:21,155 --> 00:36:22,371
So...

624
00:36:23,066 --> 00:36:25,666
is it true that you put up other posts as well?

625
00:36:25,666 --> 00:36:27,365
I heard you even demanded money.

626
00:36:27,365 --> 00:36:29,666
Where did you hear such nonsense?

627
00:36:29,666 --> 00:36:30,735
I can't believe it.

628
00:36:30,735 --> 00:36:32,080
Wait!

629
00:36:32,166 --> 00:36:33,836
You can't just leave.

630
00:36:33,836 --> 00:36:35,876
I was just curious.

631
00:36:35,876 --> 00:36:40,276
So please just say yes or no. Preferably in a clear voice.

632
00:36:40,276 --> 00:36:42,051
What are you trying to do?

633
00:36:44,215 --> 00:36:47,485
Are you trying to get a recording?

634
00:36:47,485 --> 00:36:49,301
What do you mean, "a recording"?

635
00:36:49,485 --> 00:36:51,360
I was only curious...

636
00:36:51,985 --> 00:36:54,796
My hearing is bad these days.

637
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:56,996
That's why I want you to answer...

638
00:36:56,996 --> 00:36:59,235
yes or no with a clear voice.

639
00:36:59,235 --> 00:37:02,135
Is it yes? "Yes," isn't it?

640
00:37:02,135 --> 00:37:04,134
No, it's not. Let go of me.

641
00:37:04,135 --> 00:37:05,411
I...

642
00:37:12,175 --> 00:37:13,821
Why is this on?

643
00:37:13,945 --> 00:37:17,190
Is it broken? It won't even turn off.

644
00:37:18,586 --> 00:37:21,661
You're unbelievable, to the very end.

645
00:37:21,785 --> 00:37:23,130
I'm sorry, ma'am.

646
00:37:23,526 --> 00:37:25,031
I'm sorry.

647
00:37:27,055 --> 00:37:28,330
It's all right, sir.

648
00:37:28,655 --> 00:37:30,865
I didn't expect much, to be honest.

649
00:37:30,865 --> 00:37:34,841
Yes, you should just focus on frying chicken.

650
00:37:35,365 --> 00:37:37,110
I'm embarrassed.

651
00:37:39,505 --> 00:37:41,235
I'm kidding.

652
00:37:41,235 --> 00:37:43,681
It's really fine. Don't be disappointed.

653
00:37:44,146 --> 00:37:47,221
We have a plan B, in case this didn't work out.

654
00:37:48,175 --> 00:37:50,460
Plan B? What is it?

655
00:37:51,246 --> 00:37:53,686
There must be proof online...

656
00:37:53,686 --> 00:37:55,730
on how she took advantage of people.

657
00:37:55,956 --> 00:37:57,301
We are going to find that.

658
00:37:57,985 --> 00:37:59,571
Who? How?

659
00:37:59,925 --> 00:38:01,500
Sorry to ask you this on your day off.

660
00:38:01,695 --> 00:38:04,871
Come on, Soo Hyun. This is a piece of cake.

661
00:38:04,965 --> 00:38:07,471
- On a private matter too. - A private matter?

662
00:38:07,566 --> 00:38:09,610
This is about punishing the unjust. It's a public matter.

663
00:38:16,876 --> 00:38:19,790
I asked some people who are as good as NIS agents to look into it.

664
00:38:20,776 --> 00:38:24,060
And I talked about your restaurant to a Podcast that I did.

665
00:38:24,816 --> 00:38:26,591
Pod? What is that?

666
00:38:26,755 --> 00:38:30,201
It's like a one-man broadcast, but more like a radio show.

667
00:38:30,385 --> 00:38:33,230
I asked them to promote you. So things will get better soon.

668
00:38:35,126 --> 00:38:36,841
Thank you.

669
00:38:43,206 --> 00:38:45,681
Isn't that the lawyer from last time?

670
00:38:46,305 --> 00:38:47,951
Come on, pick it up.

671
00:38:52,575 --> 00:38:54,945
(Yellow Chicken)

672
00:38:54,945 --> 00:38:58,261
I knew this would happen.

673
00:38:58,546 --> 00:38:59,960
Move over.

674
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:02,900
Why did you have to get involved?

675
00:39:04,655 --> 00:39:06,201
I was just...

676
00:39:06,796 --> 00:39:10,071
trying to avenge my precious wife.

677
00:39:11,396 --> 00:39:12,610
Seriously.

678
00:39:13,066 --> 00:39:14,440
You are such a smooth talker.

679
00:39:15,496 --> 00:39:17,610
Why are you alone? Where is Soo Hyun?

680
00:39:18,235 --> 00:39:19,551
Right. I forgot.

681
00:39:20,035 --> 00:39:22,305
On our way back...

682
00:39:22,305 --> 00:39:24,675
- Yes. - Remember that lawyer guy?

683
00:39:24,675 --> 00:39:27,190
He called her and asked her out to dinner.

684
00:39:28,816 --> 00:39:30,161
You know what I think?

685
00:39:30,385 --> 00:39:34,161
I think that lawyer is totally into Soo Hyun.

686
00:39:35,155 --> 00:39:36,261
Really?

687
00:39:36,626 --> 00:39:38,385
But she has to like him too.

688
00:39:38,385 --> 00:39:42,325
It's not like that. I think she does like him.

689
00:39:42,325 --> 00:39:43,601
She said she will buy dinner.

690
00:39:48,796 --> 00:39:51,141
Why do you look so gloomy?

691
00:39:52,305 --> 00:39:53,380
Huh?

692
00:39:54,106 --> 00:39:57,250
Wait. Are you jealous?

693
00:39:59,276 --> 00:40:01,190
Of course not! No way.

694
00:40:01,876 --> 00:40:04,161
I am worried about your restaurant.

695
00:40:04,746 --> 00:40:07,960
I don't think of Soo Hyun as more than a friend or a sister.

696
00:40:08,285 --> 00:40:09,285
No way.

697
00:40:09,285 --> 00:40:11,460
Of course, she is.

698
00:40:11,586 --> 00:40:14,726
You already have four children and soon a grandchild.

699
00:40:14,726 --> 00:40:17,770
You should feel ashamed of yourself if you were interested in her.

700
00:40:27,606 --> 00:40:30,621
He's right. I have no time for this.

701
00:40:35,376 --> 00:40:37,420
(Ko Bong Joo)

702
00:40:37,985 --> 00:40:39,091
Yes, Bong Joo.

703
00:40:39,356 --> 00:40:41,031
I did some digging on the children's father.

704
00:40:53,595 --> 00:40:56,440
Food tastes the best when someone else is buying.

705
00:41:00,936 --> 00:41:04,520
I asked you to have dinner because I have something to say.

706
00:41:10,945 --> 00:41:12,060
What is it?

707
00:41:12,516 --> 00:41:13,591
I...

708
00:41:14,356 --> 00:41:17,400
don't like people who lead others on,

709
00:41:17,825 --> 00:41:20,130
but I found myself doing something similar.

710
00:41:21,126 --> 00:41:23,741
Remember what I said after you confessed your feelings?

711
00:41:24,396 --> 00:41:26,641
I said I am not sure how I feel.

712
00:41:27,365 --> 00:41:28,471
You did.

713
00:41:29,266 --> 00:41:30,641
I think I know now.

714
00:41:31,805 --> 00:41:33,181
Now that I know you,

715
00:41:34,035 --> 00:41:38,150
I see that you're a much better person than I thought.

716
00:41:38,905 --> 00:41:41,551
That's why I couldn't let you go.

717
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:43,690
Then you shouldn't.

718
00:41:47,255 --> 00:41:48,491
I think you need to do things...

719
00:41:49,385 --> 00:41:51,931
when you really want to.

720
00:41:52,796 --> 00:41:56,500
But right now, what I really want to do...

721
00:41:58,126 --> 00:42:00,710
is not dating or to be in love.

722
00:42:02,235 --> 00:42:03,411
Then what is it?

723
00:42:04,535 --> 00:42:06,911
I want to help Da Jung.

724
00:42:08,075 --> 00:42:10,321
I want to help her be well...

725
00:42:11,046 --> 00:42:14,290
so she can have a healthy baby.

726
00:42:15,916 --> 00:42:17,060
Frankly,

727
00:42:18,816 --> 00:42:20,060
I don't understand.

728
00:42:20,916 --> 00:42:22,190
She isn't your real sister.

729
00:42:30,365 --> 00:42:31,471
I...

730
00:42:32,865 --> 00:42:34,770
had a sister who was three years younger than me.

731
00:42:36,035 --> 00:42:37,241
Had?

732
00:42:37,936 --> 00:42:39,040
Yes.

733
00:42:40,035 --> 00:42:43,621
When she was Da Jung's age, she passed away in an accident.

734
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:51,621
I never imagined that...

735
00:42:52,816 --> 00:42:54,031
you would have such a story.

736
00:42:55,686 --> 00:42:58,301
I was too rash. I am so sorry.

737
00:42:59,856 --> 00:43:00,931
No, it's okay.

738
00:43:03,026 --> 00:43:04,141
It's just...

739
00:43:04,896 --> 00:43:08,210
I keep thinking about my sister whenever I see Da Jung.

740
00:43:09,635 --> 00:43:10,710
That's why...

741
00:43:11,606 --> 00:43:13,781
I want to treat Da Jung well...

742
00:43:15,436 --> 00:43:17,420
since I couldn't do so for my sister.

743
00:43:18,376 --> 00:43:21,591
I think I can understand.

744
00:43:23,246 --> 00:43:27,790
But she is Dae Han's daughter.

745
00:43:29,626 --> 00:43:31,500
Being deeply involved in another person's life,

746
00:43:33,456 --> 00:43:34,730
contrary to your intention,

747
00:43:36,095 --> 00:43:37,940
may end badly, right?

748
00:43:40,635 --> 00:43:44,411
I know you are right.

749
00:43:46,206 --> 00:43:49,480
But it's just hard to stand by.

750
00:43:51,206 --> 00:43:53,290
Maybe I like to cross the line.

751
00:43:54,816 --> 00:43:56,020
When you say it's hard...

752
00:43:58,016 --> 00:44:01,130
is it just because of Da Jung?

753
00:44:02,516 --> 00:44:03,761
What do you mean?

754
00:44:05,186 --> 00:44:06,400
I'm curious.

755
00:44:07,956 --> 00:44:10,141
Your feelings towards Dae Han.

756
00:44:20,106 --> 00:44:22,051
Did you have a good time with the children today?

757
00:44:22,945 --> 00:44:24,181
Of course.

758
00:44:24,776 --> 00:44:27,091
They were really happy.

759
00:44:28,345 --> 00:44:31,621
It would not have been possible without you. Thank you.

760
00:44:31,746 --> 00:44:33,060
You're welcome.

761
00:44:33,985 --> 00:44:36,661
Do you really have to go to Vietnam? The kids love you so much.

762
00:44:37,825 --> 00:44:40,396
Of course, I want to be with them.

763
00:44:40,396 --> 00:44:41,500
But...

764
00:44:43,266 --> 00:44:45,440
money is always the problem, right?

765
00:44:45,726 --> 00:44:46,871
True.

766
00:44:47,896 --> 00:44:49,940
Money is always the problem.

767
00:44:53,976 --> 00:44:55,110
I just thought...

768
00:44:56,746 --> 00:44:59,480
you don't need to go all the way to Vietnam to earn money.

769
00:45:00,345 --> 00:45:01,790
You have never been there.

770
00:45:08,215 --> 00:45:11,000
What are you talking about?

771
00:45:11,385 --> 00:45:13,101
I checked your entry and departure record.

772
00:45:13,726 --> 00:45:15,301
You've never been to Vietnam.

773
00:45:25,106 --> 00:45:29,250
You really are a former assemblyman. How resourceful of you.

774
00:45:31,606 --> 00:45:34,091
I am not sure what you have been up to these past few years,

775
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:37,020
but you should stay with them.

776
00:45:37,646 --> 00:45:39,661
They still need a parent's care.

777
00:45:41,186 --> 00:45:42,630
I will help as much as I can.

778
00:45:52,496 --> 00:45:53,710
I...

779
00:45:55,396 --> 00:45:56,781
think...

780
00:45:57,965 --> 00:46:00,351
I killed their mother.

781
00:46:03,246 --> 00:46:04,721
If she hadn't met me,

782
00:46:05,876 --> 00:46:07,920
she wouldn't have died like that.

783
00:46:09,075 --> 00:46:10,891
Thank you for your offer,

784
00:46:12,285 --> 00:46:14,431
but being next to a broken man...

785
00:46:16,115 --> 00:46:17,630
will break the children too.

786
00:46:21,896 --> 00:46:24,670
Did you find anything on the mommy website?

787
00:46:24,896 --> 00:46:26,170
I didn't.

788
00:46:26,936 --> 00:46:28,471
But Ms. Ahn did.

789
00:46:28,896 --> 00:46:30,040
What is it?

790
00:46:31,766 --> 00:46:33,911
This is another website for part-time workers.

791
00:46:34,336 --> 00:46:35,580
Look at these comments.

792
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:37,206
The restaurant that I worked for...

793
00:46:37,206 --> 00:46:40,420
was also taken advantage of by that website called "Love Inju."

794
00:46:40,675 --> 00:46:44,060
I secretly took a video of her demanding money.

795
00:46:44,146 --> 00:46:47,086
But the owner thought it's easier to just give her the money!

796
00:46:47,086 --> 00:46:48,115
I was so flustered!

797
00:46:48,115 --> 00:46:51,400
I knew it, Ms. Ahn! You did it!

798
00:46:51,956 --> 00:46:54,055
I found out her number and called her.

799
00:46:54,055 --> 00:46:55,925
She still has the video.

800
00:46:55,925 --> 00:46:57,040
She does?

801
00:46:57,796 --> 00:46:59,270
Ms. Ahn, you are the best!

802
00:47:01,195 --> 00:47:03,141
This feels like entering a courtroom.

803
00:47:04,305 --> 00:47:05,540
Let's just get it over with.

804
00:47:05,905 --> 00:47:07,951
I don't mind if I get expelled from school.

805
00:47:08,436 --> 00:47:10,150
Really? Why?

806
00:47:10,476 --> 00:47:13,020
So you can live off of me for the rest of your life?

807
00:47:13,445 --> 00:47:15,020
Do you love me?

808
00:47:15,345 --> 00:47:16,591
That's a horrible thing to say.

809
00:47:18,316 --> 00:47:19,761
Let's just go in.

810
00:47:20,356 --> 00:47:21,916
You remember what I said, right?

811
00:47:21,916 --> 00:47:24,686
When I give you the signal, just beg, got it?

812
00:47:24,686 --> 00:47:26,301
- "Please forgive..." - Can you walk?

813
00:47:30,026 --> 00:47:31,601
How annoying.

814
00:47:34,095 --> 00:47:36,195
Careful. That's it.

815
00:47:36,195 --> 00:47:37,781
- Let me go! - Come on.

816
00:47:38,336 --> 00:47:40,480
Just lean on me.

817
00:47:48,596 --> 00:47:51,570
It was clearly wrong of him to use violence.

818
00:47:51,935 --> 00:47:54,481
We are deeply sorry...

819
00:47:54,636 --> 00:47:56,851
for the victim and his parents.

820
00:47:57,236 --> 00:47:59,921
However, I hope you understand that it was accidental...

821
00:47:59,946 --> 00:48:04,475
and that it was an act of resistance towards another act of violence.

822
00:48:04,475 --> 00:48:08,216
What do you mean by "resistance towards violence"?

823
00:48:08,216 --> 00:48:10,291
I only found out after the fact,

824
00:48:10,585 --> 00:48:13,800
but Jae Yoon had been calling my son Messed Up Family...

825
00:48:14,156 --> 00:48:16,570
and teased another classmate who receives a basic living pension...

826
00:48:17,225 --> 00:48:20,771
by calling him BLP.

827
00:48:22,625 --> 00:48:25,570
It was an accident that happened...

828
00:48:25,995 --> 00:48:28,605
when he couldn't endure the continuous harassment anymore.

829
00:48:28,605 --> 00:48:29,975
But still,

830
00:48:29,975 --> 00:48:33,481
inflicting an injury is obviously the wrong behavior.

831
00:48:33,506 --> 00:48:36,490
Taking revenge on verbal violence by using physical violence...

832
00:48:36,515 --> 00:48:38,590
is not something that can be justified.

833
00:48:38,946 --> 00:48:40,860
Yes, that is true.

834
00:48:41,216 --> 00:48:44,360
My son and I both greatly regret it.

835
00:48:50,796 --> 00:48:52,501
I'm sorry.

836
00:48:53,026 --> 00:48:56,041
I won't ever use violence again.

837
00:49:02,435 --> 00:49:04,050
What do you think, sir?

838
00:49:04,736 --> 00:49:07,820
According to Luke 17:3, it says,

839
00:49:15,685 --> 00:49:18,691
“If your brother or sister sins against you, rebuke them,"

840
00:49:19,116 --> 00:49:21,124
"and if they repent, forgive them."

841
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:23,831
According to Han Bit Mom's posts,

842
00:49:23,995 --> 00:49:25,970
she seems to be very religious.

843
00:49:29,596 --> 00:49:33,110
My son is repenting his sins. So, please...

844
00:49:33,866 --> 00:49:36,950
I beg of you to give him just one more chance.

845
00:49:50,036 --> 00:49:51,636
(Look at her pretending to study. Must be good for her baby.)

846
00:49:51,636 --> 00:49:52,866
So annoying.

847
00:49:52,866 --> 00:49:56,434
We can't even talk during break time because of her.

848
00:49:56,435 --> 00:49:57,875
He said it's not good for the baby.

849
00:49:57,875 --> 00:50:00,406
Then she should just stay at home.

850
00:50:00,406 --> 00:50:03,045
Let her be. She just wants attention.

851
00:50:03,045 --> 00:50:05,890
It must run in her family. Like father, like daughter.

852
00:50:06,076 --> 00:50:08,045
I bet the baby's needy as well.

853
00:50:08,045 --> 00:50:10,030
(She's so shameless.)

854
00:50:10,156 --> 00:50:11,815
Hey.

855
00:50:11,815 --> 00:50:13,786
Put your phones on silent mode.

856
00:50:13,786 --> 00:50:16,870
We need to be considerate towards the pregnant woman.

857
00:50:36,406 --> 00:50:38,350
Dae Han, what happened with the school violence committee?

858
00:50:39,616 --> 00:50:41,120
I don't know.

859
00:50:41,216 --> 00:50:43,315
It will work out. Don't worry.

860
00:50:43,315 --> 00:50:45,131
The results will probably be out by tomorrow.

861
00:50:46,955 --> 00:50:48,800
Did your assistants find anything?

862
00:50:51,196 --> 00:50:52,401
Take a look at this.

863
00:50:54,866 --> 00:50:56,341
I really appreciate it.

864
00:50:58,395 --> 00:50:59,395
What do you think?

865
00:50:59,395 --> 00:51:01,611
- This is great! - Right?

866
00:51:01,665 --> 00:51:04,811
I told you my people are as good as the NIS.

867
00:51:09,306 --> 00:51:12,291
I can't believe that girl.

868
00:51:12,815 --> 00:51:14,591
(Attorney Kang Joon Ho)

869
00:51:18,386 --> 00:51:19,530
(Kim Hye Jin)

870
00:51:22,826 --> 00:51:23,926
(Kim Hye Jin)

871
00:51:23,926 --> 00:51:27,001
I happened to see them, and I thought they looked intimate.

872
00:51:29,225 --> 00:51:30,510
I'm curious.

873
00:51:31,236 --> 00:51:33,841
Your feelings towards Dae Han.

874
00:51:35,835 --> 00:51:40,151
I don't know if this is...

875
00:51:40,705 --> 00:51:43,151
friendship or sympathy,

876
00:51:43,915 --> 00:51:45,950
but it's true that...

877
00:51:48,045 --> 00:51:49,361
I do have feelings for him.

878
00:52:01,966 --> 00:52:03,071
Yes?

879
00:52:08,236 --> 00:52:09,580
What brings you here?

880
00:52:09,766 --> 00:52:12,611
I was passing by, and I wanted to discuss something with you.

881
00:52:15,176 --> 00:52:17,620
Are you sure you're not running in the general election?

882
00:52:19,045 --> 00:52:22,120
I told you. I have no intentions.

883
00:52:22,946 --> 00:52:24,890
Regardless of your choice,

884
00:52:25,156 --> 00:52:28,930
I'll be declaring that I'm not running this year.

885
00:52:29,085 --> 00:52:33,271
But I'll be running as a party leader instead.

886
00:52:34,665 --> 00:52:38,211
But that doesn't mean you can't run in the general election.

887
00:52:38,536 --> 00:52:41,165
I've had my time as a local lawmaker,

888
00:52:41,165 --> 00:52:43,341
so I'll have to devote myself to the party.

889
00:52:44,176 --> 00:52:48,220
What do you think will make a better future for our party?

890
00:52:48,246 --> 00:52:50,544
Replacing the people would be the first step.

891
00:52:50,545 --> 00:52:51,791
Exactly.

892
00:52:51,815 --> 00:52:55,160
So I'm going to be setting the example.

893
00:52:55,516 --> 00:52:57,355
The old folks have to move aside...

894
00:52:57,355 --> 00:52:59,660
for the young and ambitious people to join us.

895
00:53:06,525 --> 00:53:08,740
I'm not telling you to run in the general election...

896
00:53:09,125 --> 00:53:11,571
just because I'm your father.

897
00:53:13,036 --> 00:53:14,535
I'm asking you to help...

898
00:53:14,536 --> 00:53:16,381
so we can save the party...

899
00:53:16,406 --> 00:53:18,950
and rebuild our forces.

900
00:53:23,545 --> 00:53:27,361
How will you even pay your rent like this?

901
00:53:28,145 --> 00:53:30,156
You didn't call me in with another fake apology...

902
00:53:30,156 --> 00:53:32,754
so you can record me again, did you?

903
00:53:32,755 --> 00:53:35,556
Why would we trouble each other?

904
00:53:35,556 --> 00:53:37,755
How are you planning on apologizing?

905
00:53:37,755 --> 00:53:39,870
Are you going to get down on your knees and beg?

906
00:53:42,125 --> 00:53:45,065
I think doing that once was enough.

907
00:53:45,065 --> 00:53:48,140
Then why did you call me? I'm a busy person.

908
00:53:49,605 --> 00:53:52,675
Even if you're busy, I thought you should see this.

909
00:53:52,676 --> 00:53:55,421
What is it now? You're so annoying.

910
00:53:58,775 --> 00:54:00,050
I really appreciate it.

911
00:54:02,085 --> 00:54:03,685
You made a wise choice.

912
00:54:03,685 --> 00:54:05,930
You're getting great publicity for this price.

913
00:54:07,926 --> 00:54:11,231
What... What's wrong with this?

914
00:54:11,696 --> 00:54:15,171
So I got a little something in return for the publicity.

915
00:54:16,426 --> 00:54:17,841
Is that so?

916
00:54:18,435 --> 00:54:20,881
I wonder if the viewers will think the same.

917
00:54:21,835 --> 00:54:23,481
"Viewers"?

918
00:54:24,136 --> 00:54:27,746
Didn't you know she worked at a broadcasting station?

919
00:54:27,746 --> 00:54:29,545
She's the writer for a popular current events show.

920
00:54:29,545 --> 00:54:32,550
Wait. Why did you leave out that I'm the main writer?

921
00:54:33,545 --> 00:54:36,185
Sorry. And you're close friends with Newscaster Kim Hye Jin,

922
00:54:36,185 --> 00:54:37,955
who used to be on the 8 o'clock news, right?

923
00:54:37,955 --> 00:54:40,955
Of course. She's the host of our show right now.

924
00:54:40,955 --> 00:54:43,326
- Right. - If I show her this,

925
00:54:43,326 --> 00:54:44,771
she'll be thrilled about it.

926
00:54:46,656 --> 00:54:48,041
I'm sorry.

927
00:54:48,125 --> 00:54:50,870
Please forgive me just this once.

928
00:54:51,136 --> 00:54:53,841
I think you should be...

929
00:54:54,665 --> 00:54:56,536
apologizing to my mom and dad instead.

930
00:54:56,536 --> 00:54:57,711
"Mom and dad"?

931
00:55:01,406 --> 00:55:04,045
I'm really sorry.

932
00:55:04,045 --> 00:55:07,361
Why are you holding my man's hands?

933
00:55:09,145 --> 00:55:12,355
What I did to you two was terrible.

934
00:55:12,355 --> 00:55:13,830
Gosh!

935
00:55:14,656 --> 00:55:16,684
I'm truly sorry.

936
00:55:16,685 --> 00:55:19,525
I'll even get down on my knees if you want me to.

937
00:55:19,525 --> 00:55:22,700
You don't need to go that far.

938
00:55:22,725 --> 00:55:26,766
Explain what happened here on that mommy website...

939
00:55:26,766 --> 00:55:31,505
and find someone else who will run it fairly. Okay?

940
00:55:31,505 --> 00:55:34,981
Yes, sir. I'll do that. Of course, I should.

941
00:55:35,145 --> 00:55:38,220
I'll put up a post as soon as I get home.

942
00:55:40,246 --> 00:55:41,591
- Is it this place? - Yes, it is.

943
00:55:42,796 --> 00:55:44,466
Why, welcome.

944
00:55:44,466 --> 00:55:46,911
Welcome.

945
00:55:47,376 --> 00:55:49,475
Oh my gosh. See? I told you.

946
00:55:49,475 --> 00:55:53,150
It's true! You're them, aren't you?

947
00:55:54,146 --> 00:55:56,150
What do you mean?

948
00:55:58,646 --> 00:56:02,460
Shut up and fry

949
00:56:03,115 --> 00:56:04,400
Here.

950
00:56:06,126 --> 00:56:07,126
(That's hilarious! He said, shut up and fry.)

951
00:56:07,126 --> 00:56:10,896
Today, I will explain to you in detail...

952
00:56:10,896 --> 00:56:13,936
about the special sauce we use at our restaurant...

953
00:56:13,936 --> 00:56:16,396
that sets us apart from the others.

954
00:56:16,396 --> 00:56:17,804
What are you talking about?

955
00:56:17,805 --> 00:56:19,305
You're going to tell them the secret sauce?

956
00:56:19,305 --> 00:56:20,936
You said you were going to tell them!

957
00:56:20,936 --> 00:56:23,905
- No, I didn't! - You did say that!

958
00:56:23,905 --> 00:56:25,745
I meant I will tell you.

959
00:56:25,745 --> 00:56:29,175
If we tell our viewers, they will all make it at home.

960
00:56:29,175 --> 00:56:31,721
- Whatever. - Forget it!

961
00:56:31,785 --> 00:56:34,561
Hey everyone, I'm at the restaurant right now.

962
00:56:35,186 --> 00:56:37,460
The owner's head is huge.

963
00:56:38,186 --> 00:56:40,831
What? I'm so jealous. I wanted to check it out too.

964
00:56:41,555 --> 00:56:44,241
Me too. I hear their chicken is awesome.

965
00:56:44,696 --> 00:56:47,110
Soo Hyun. Bring that out.

966
00:56:47,796 --> 00:56:49,710
Where are you? My shoes are on.

967
00:56:50,166 --> 00:56:51,641
Do a chicken eating show too.

968
00:56:51,836 --> 00:56:53,166
They've got great chemistry.

969
00:56:53,166 --> 00:56:54,776
Here's your chicken.

970
00:56:54,776 --> 00:56:58,475
- Thank you. - We're trying to do our best,

971
00:56:58,475 --> 00:57:01,021
but we make mistakes too.

972
00:57:01,146 --> 00:57:02,951
I'm sorry. Thank you.

973
00:57:07,785 --> 00:57:12,300
After frying the chicken nicely, we remove the oil.

974
00:57:13,055 --> 00:57:14,730
We remove it. Okay.

975
00:57:14,856 --> 00:57:17,070
If you're done talking, I'll go now.

976
00:57:18,296 --> 00:57:21,110
You're so impatient. I'm not done yet.

977
00:57:24,535 --> 00:57:28,351
What other favor do you want to ask of me?

978
00:57:29,436 --> 00:57:31,380
Don't be scared. It's nothing much.

979
00:57:36,376 --> 00:57:37,991
Step down as the head of the group...

980
00:57:39,216 --> 00:57:40,530
pushing for the international high school.

981
00:57:41,086 --> 00:57:42,991
What? That's too much.

982
00:57:43,316 --> 00:57:45,825
We need to consider what the members want...

983
00:57:45,825 --> 00:57:48,030
I guess you don't want to let go.

984
00:57:48,495 --> 00:57:49,626
Sure, the members.

985
00:57:49,626 --> 00:57:51,765
What was the production director's number again?

986
00:57:51,765 --> 00:57:54,940
Okay, I'll do it. I'll step down.

987
00:57:56,396 --> 00:57:58,340
You're so quick.

988
00:57:58,736 --> 00:58:01,150
Just don't harass people anymore, and you'll be all good.

989
00:58:03,975 --> 00:58:06,820
The leader of the group pushing for the international school called.

990
00:58:07,146 --> 00:58:10,690
She says she needs to step down for health reasons.

991
00:58:12,615 --> 00:58:14,391
I guess Dae Han worked his magic again.

992
00:58:16,385 --> 00:58:17,761
She won't say,

993
00:58:18,285 --> 00:58:20,230
but I think he has something on her.

994
00:58:22,725 --> 00:58:23,800
Not bad.

995
00:58:25,595 --> 00:58:29,241
It's time to put an end to the low-income apartment matter.

996
00:58:30,836 --> 00:58:32,480
Get what we discussed before ready.

997
00:58:33,535 --> 00:58:34,610
Yes, sir.

998
00:58:37,405 --> 00:58:39,980
- Daddy! - Daddy!

999
00:58:42,015 --> 00:58:43,885
Daddy didn't go to Vietnam.

1000
00:58:43,885 --> 00:58:46,090
He would've said so if he were going.

1001
00:58:46,186 --> 00:58:48,615
He isn't here at the house...

1002
00:58:48,615 --> 00:58:50,761
and we can't reach him.

1003
00:58:51,285 --> 00:58:53,931
That's because he doesn't have a cell phone.

1004
00:58:54,095 --> 00:58:56,331
He wouldn't leave without saying bye to you.

1005
00:58:56,595 --> 00:59:00,371
He did that last time. I want to go to Vietnam too.

1006
00:59:00,396 --> 00:59:03,411
I want to go with Daddy.

1007
00:59:06,566 --> 00:59:07,780
Keep it down!

1008
00:59:09,336 --> 00:59:11,750
Tak, why are you yelling at them?

1009
00:59:11,975 --> 00:59:13,420
That jerk is no dad.

1010
00:59:13,646 --> 00:59:15,050
Having a kid doesn't make you a dad.

1011
00:59:15,475 --> 00:59:17,615
That jerk isn't our dad, so stop crying!

1012
00:59:17,615 --> 00:59:19,621
- Tak! Stop it! - Darn it!

1013
00:59:31,796 --> 00:59:33,911
You need to get your life back on track.

1014
00:59:34,535 --> 00:59:36,570
Think of the kids. Stop gambling.

1015
00:59:37,606 --> 00:59:39,541
Life is a gamble.

1016
00:59:39,905 --> 00:59:42,081
If I stop gambling, I should just die.

1017
00:59:42,905 --> 00:59:44,581
What happened when you went to Wi Dae Han?

1018
00:59:45,845 --> 00:59:47,150
What is there to tell?

1019
00:59:47,975 --> 00:59:49,291
I'm still living there.

1020
00:59:49,416 --> 00:59:50,816
From what I see on the news,

1021
00:59:50,816 --> 00:59:54,186
Wi Dae Han really shaped up.

1022
00:59:54,186 --> 00:59:56,791
Looking at the stuff he's doing now, I think...

1023
00:59:56,885 --> 00:59:58,425
that mourning march was sincere.

1024
00:59:58,425 --> 01:00:00,400
Give me a break.

1025
01:00:02,555 --> 01:00:04,400
Do you think otherwise?

1026
01:00:07,796 --> 01:00:09,070
I am grateful...

1027
01:00:10,436 --> 01:00:12,681
because he's a great card for me.

1028
01:00:13,006 --> 01:00:14,280
What do you mean?

1029
01:00:15,035 --> 01:00:18,305
I had two pairs, aces high,

1030
01:00:18,305 --> 01:00:22,121
and it turns out Wi Dae Han is the ace of spades.

1031
01:00:22,845 --> 01:00:26,590
Thanks to him, my two pairs became a full house.

1032
01:00:29,785 --> 01:00:31,000
Are the kids asleep?

1033
01:00:31,925 --> 01:00:33,971
Yes. I finally got them to sleep.

1034
01:00:36,495 --> 01:00:38,670
Couldn't he at least call?

1035
01:00:39,066 --> 01:00:42,340
I knew it. That's how he was before too.

1036
01:00:46,035 --> 01:00:47,181
I know...

1037
01:00:48,276 --> 01:00:50,920
I'm being utterly shameless for doing this,

1038
01:00:52,345 --> 01:00:54,021
but let me ask for one more favor.

1039
01:00:55,376 --> 01:00:56,521
A favor?

1040
01:00:57,885 --> 01:01:02,130
Seeing Tae Poong and Song Yi fall asleep while crying...

1041
01:01:03,716 --> 01:01:05,261
really broke my heart.

1042
01:01:07,955 --> 01:01:11,940
It's too hard for them every time Dad pops in and disappears...

1043
01:01:12,595 --> 01:01:14,170
without a word like that.

1044
01:01:16,495 --> 01:01:18,311
You said before, right?

1045
01:01:19,135 --> 01:01:21,581
That you don't think you can act like a real dad.

1046
01:01:22,606 --> 01:01:25,851
But in exchange, you will be our guardian.

1047
01:01:28,615 --> 01:01:30,820
Yes, I did.

1048
01:01:34,816 --> 01:01:36,130
Since you're doing it anyway,

1049
01:01:40,896 --> 01:01:43,130
can't you be our dad, not just our guardian?

1050
01:01:48,765 --> 01:01:52,710
You don't have to be my dad, but at least for them.

1051
01:01:54,305 --> 01:01:55,750
They're still young.

1052
01:01:58,745 --> 01:02:00,081
Please.

1053
01:02:09,885 --> 01:02:11,101
Wi Dae Han speaking.

1054
01:02:11,186 --> 01:02:14,000
You have such a pompous voice.

1055
01:02:14,455 --> 01:02:16,730
It's not like you're so great.

1056
01:02:17,196 --> 01:02:18,300
Mr. Han?

1057
01:02:18,825 --> 01:02:21,041
You sound like you've had a lot to drink. Where are you?

1058
01:02:40,345 --> 01:02:41,460
Drink.

1059
01:02:47,955 --> 01:02:51,000
The great Wi Dae Han came to a place like this.

1060
01:02:52,796 --> 01:02:54,541
Don't just stand there.

1061
01:02:55,135 --> 01:02:57,110
Come. Sit.

1062
01:03:04,845 --> 01:03:07,521
Girls, do you know who he is?

1063
01:03:08,216 --> 01:03:10,451
He's a great man.

1064
01:03:11,416 --> 01:03:12,991
He looks familiar.

1065
01:03:13,615 --> 01:03:14,831
Who is he?

1066
01:03:16,316 --> 01:03:19,385
You're Wi Dae Han, right? National Dad.

1067
01:03:19,385 --> 01:03:22,701
- That's right. - Correct.

1068
01:03:22,756 --> 01:03:26,300
You've got a good eye. You're nothing like how you look.

1069
01:03:26,925 --> 01:03:29,070
Let's talk alone.

1070
01:03:29,095 --> 01:03:30,170
Why?

1071
01:03:30,635 --> 01:03:32,840
Is it something they can't hear?

1072
01:03:34,876 --> 01:03:37,280
My apologies, but please excuse us.

1073
01:03:54,526 --> 01:03:57,701
Let's hear it. What is it?

1074
01:04:03,066 --> 01:04:05,035
You came back after abandoning your kids for two years,

1075
01:04:05,035 --> 01:04:06,511
and you pull this garbage?

1076
01:04:07,166 --> 01:04:09,780
- Garbage? - Yes, garbage.

1077
01:04:10,135 --> 01:04:11,745
Do you know how much Tae Poong and Song Yi cried,

1078
01:04:11,745 --> 01:04:13,621
thinking their dad left them again without a word?

1079
01:04:21,155 --> 01:04:22,561
What are you trying to do?

1080
01:04:22,816 --> 01:04:25,331
And what are you doing?

1081
01:04:25,555 --> 01:04:28,300
I'm doing what you should be doing!

1082
01:04:29,225 --> 01:04:31,400
So why are you doing that?

1083
01:04:32,196 --> 01:04:35,141
You're not related to Da Jung at all!

1084
01:05:07,126 --> 01:05:10,710
(The Great Show)

1085
01:05:11,405 --> 01:05:12,865
How could he demand money?

1086
01:05:12,865 --> 01:05:15,606
If he talks, my relationship with the kids is over.

1087
01:05:15,606 --> 01:05:17,075
Who will watch them then?

1088
01:05:17,075 --> 01:05:18,550
This is not the time to worry about the kids.

1089
01:05:18,845 --> 01:05:21,250
They say the man who attacked Assemblyman Kang is your supporter.

1090
01:05:22,416 --> 01:05:24,316
Let go, you jerk. I'm not a good person either,

1091
01:05:24,316 --> 01:05:26,090
but I think I'm better than you.

1092
01:05:26,285 --> 01:05:27,885
Please say a word!

1093
01:05:27,885 --> 01:05:29,785
Do you plan to run in this district?

1094
01:05:29,785 --> 01:05:31,885
I look forward to a clean election.

1095
01:05:31,885 --> 01:05:35,030
I wish the kids could keep living with you.

1096
01:05:36,055 --> 01:05:38,641
I'll be the kids' dad in your place.
