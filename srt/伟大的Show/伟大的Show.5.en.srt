00:00:56,950 --> 00:01:01,340
We collect the hot issues from
around the country for the week,

00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,699
and the two "progressive" and
"conservative" representatives

7
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,200
duke it out on our show.
We're the "Dispute."

8
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:13,949
We have a new
addition to the "Dispute."

9
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:16,939
He's currently in the spotlight
as "The Nation's Dad."

10
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:18,479
He'll serve as our
"progressive" panel...

11
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,499
- Ahjussi will be on soon.
- He is Wie Dae Han,

12
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,790
the former assemblyman.

Wie Dae Han)

The advancement of democracy
stems from a healthy dispute.

15
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:37,519
For "Dispute" to be
healthy and a great success,

16
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,449
I'll be giving it
my all. Thank you.

17
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:43,869
What a load of bullshit.

18
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:47,369
In order to cheer on
former assemblyman Wie,

19
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:50,580
his daughter has
joined us in the studio.

20
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:54,339
Yes, hello.

21
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:57,199
I'm Han Da Jung, a
junior in high school.

22
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,719
I know she's my
girlfriend, but she's so hot.

23
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:05,780
Do you have any words for
former assemblyman Wie Dae Han?

24
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,370
"The Nations' Dad," fighting!

25
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,299
Fighting.

26
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,750
Fighting!

27
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,769
Due to the increase in minimum
wages, the employment rates are low.

28
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:25,949
Businesses are suffering.

29
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:27,689
Everyone knows this fact.

30
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:30,489
Yes, businesses are feeling
the low wave of economics.

31
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:33,869
However, putting the blame
on higher minimum wages

32
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:36,579
is a theoretical error in misunderstanding
correlation as a causality.

33
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:37,839
In the past year,

34
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,049
we saw more than a 10% increase
in restaurant employee wages.

35
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:44,729
The sales are down, but
the expenses have increased.

36
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:46,999
And you still say
there is no correlation?

37
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,619
Yes, correct.

38
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:49,949
So I guess...

39
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:54,370
you must be extremely dissatisfied
with the minimum wage increase.

40
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,799
- What I'm saying is...
- I see.

41
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,199
That could be the case.

42
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,899
Because you have a high salary.

43
00:02:58,900 --> 00:02:59,900
Isn't that right?

44
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,100
No fun.

45
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:13,070
Let's move onto our
brand new segment.

46
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,099
(People's Assembly Hall)

47
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,910
People's Assembly Hall.

48
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,999
I believe Attorney Kang
has prepared today's bill.

49
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,239
What is it, please?

50
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:29,139
As many of you know, the
regulations for legalizing abortion

51
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:31,129
was ruled as non-constitutional.

52
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:34,869
Accordingly, the National Assembly
must revise the existing laws

53
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:36,539
by December 31, 2020.

54
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:41,389
Therefore, I'd like to propose
a revision bill for abortion laws.

55
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:45,159
Then we'll start the dispute
regarding the revision bill...

56
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,129
Before we dispute
the revision of the bill,

57
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:49,519
I want to make something clear.

58
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:53,899
Being ruled as non-constitutional
doesn't mean abortion should be abolished.

59
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,839
The exact meaning of this
ruling is intended for us to

60
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,979
revise the criteria
of an abortion.

61
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:01,739
From my personal standpoint,

62
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:05,260
I believe abortion
to be immoral.

63
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:14,729
Thank you, former assemblyman
Wie for your personal take on this.

64
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:18,259
The biggest issue in
revising the existing laws is the

65
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:21,239
time frame of when an
abortion should be allowed.

66
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,349
A fetus' right to
life is important.

67
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:28,659
However, I feel a woman's
right to choose is more important.

68
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:31,929
Considering the time frame a fetus
can survive without an umbilical cord,

69
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:33,999
I believe abortion should be

70
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,389
allowed up to 24
weeks of pregnancy.

71
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:39,309
Isn't 24 weeks too much?

72
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:41,359
Keeping in mind the
religious groups' reaction,

73
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,050
it's a risky statement.

74
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:46,959
He's got a long way to go.

75
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,539
A woman's right to her health,

76
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,019
and the right to
choose for herself.

77
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:52,219
These rights are covered
in constitutional law.

78
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:56,359
This is why I used to believe
abortion is not immoral.

79
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,829
However, my views have changed.

80
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:01,509
Because...

81
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:05,490
I now have a daughter,
quite unexpectedly.

82
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,819
If my daughter's mother had
opted to terminate her pregnancy,

83
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:15,709
my daughter wouldn't
have come into this world.

84
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:18,479
When I see my bright
and healthy daughter,

85
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:22,520
I couldn't help but realize
the precious life of a fetus.

86
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:27,679
However, some women
don't have that option.

87
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,629
Will you judge them and
see them as criminals?

88
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,299
I agree with you on that.

89
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,989
But the current abortion laws

90
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:36,949
don't allow much room
for exceptions to the rule.

91
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:39,919
And here is the crucial point.

92
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:43,079
We always omit something
when it comes to abortion.

93
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:46,229
The men's responsibility.

94
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:49,609
The current abortion
laws only penalize women.

95
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:51,749
I believe men should

96
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:54,349
suffer the consequences
rather than women.

97
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:55,859
- Wow...
- What are the correct

98
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:58,619
- Wie Dae Han is alive and kicking.
- Measures for women?

99
00:05:58,620 --> 00:05:59,740
Abolish abortion laws?

100
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,099
- He's on a roll with the abortion issue.
- No.

101
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,700
The conservative votes and
women votes. He'll get both.

102
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:06,109
I know.

103
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:09,589
Thank you for the
heated discussion.

104
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:12,129
Per Attorney Kang
Joon Ho's statement,

105
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:17,250
if you feel abortion should be
allowed up to 24 weeks of pregnancy,

106
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:19,829
press number one.

107
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:23,659
If you don't agree and as per
former assemblyman Wie's statement,

108
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:25,849
if you feel abortion
should not be allowed

109
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:28,819
after six weeks
into a pregnancy,

110
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,059
press number two.

111
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:33,060
We'll start the
voting right now.

112
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,830
Goodness, you must
have an upset stomach.

113
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:57,510
You have an upset stomach.

114
00:06:58,620 --> 00:06:59,640
Are you all right?

115
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,660
(Episode 5: What if
it happened to you...)

116
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:15,409
- Great job.
- Yes, thank you.

117
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:16,500
- Nice job.
- Good work.

118
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,899
Wow, I don't understand.

119
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:22,579
How could you receive
51% of the votes?

120
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:25,219
It shows how convincing I was.

121
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:27,899
It's because of his daughter.

122
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,299
To be deemed as
the "Citizens Bill,"

123
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,219
you must receive
over 80%, correct?

124
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,359
Yes, that's right.

125
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,299
Isn't that too high?

126
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:38,429
Man, Attorney Kang, you're
clueless about the media.

127
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:40,739
It must be set high
to get them riled up.

128
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,809
With all your TV experience,
you still don't know?

129
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:43,760
Aigoo, seriously.

130
00:07:43,761 --> 00:07:46,549
Then it'll be worthy of
the "Citizens Bill" title.

131
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:47,679
That's it.

132
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,680
Exactly.

133
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,429
Really?

134
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:54,029
I vote for we set
it too high as well.

135
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:55,640
You got something on you.

136
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,400
Wow!

137
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:02,399
The first broadcast is a daebak.

138
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,829
"Wie Dae Han's abortion laws."

139
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:06,809
Our program is dominating
the search engines.

140
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:09,479
The "abortion laws"
item was my idea.

141
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,170
I know it, I know it.

142
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,300
Other writers were opposed,
but I knew it would work.

143
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:17,620
My instincts told me it would.

144
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:22,729
Hey, Da Jung.

145
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:24,249
How are you feeling?

146
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,399
You seemed nauseous earlier.

147
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,639
I'm okay.

148
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,859
I was nervous earlier.
I got an upset stomach.

149
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:32,429
Aigoo, you worked hard today.

150
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:34,369
But shouldn't you
take some medicine?

151
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:36,099
No meds, I'm totally fine.

152
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:39,180
Aigoo, it's her first
broadcast and all...

153
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,279
Dad.

154
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,129
You were amazing today.

155
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:46,130
Huh? Dad...

156
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,489
I wasn't amazing.

157
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:56,889
Just being my usual self.

158
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:58,399
Oh, wow.

159
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,609
You and your daughter
are carbon copies.

160
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:02,069
Aren't we though? Yes.

161
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:04,049
Da Jung, you'll go to
our team dinner, right?

162
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:04,840
Yes.

163
00:09:04,841 --> 00:09:06,819
Of course, she is.

164
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:10,139
No, I should hurry home
and tuck in my siblings.

165
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:12,699
Dad, you have fun for me.

166
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,890
Aigoo, all right then...

167
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:20,309
What do you mean? We
should go home together.

168
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,400
I can join the next
team dinner. Of course.

169
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,999
Let's go home. Yup.

170
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,569
Cheers...

171
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:29,259
for "Dispute"!

172
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:31,359
One shot, everyone, one shot.

173
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,869
You have to down it, okay?

174
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:35,749
Okay? One shot, one shot.

175
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,430
If you can't down it,
pour it on your head.

176
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,499
What are you doing?

177
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,449
Even though she
said she'd go home,

178
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:44,819
how could you send
her off by herself?

179
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,069
I didn't send her off,
she took off by herself.

180
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:48,959
Didn't you see her run off?

181
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,829
Aigoo, really. What
gives? One shot.

182
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:53,670
Hey, hey, one shot.

183
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,499
There, there.

184
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,700
(Early symptoms of pregnancy)

185
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:10,350
(Constant nausea)

186
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,020
Alcohol goes down so good, huh?

187
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,600
Aigoo...

188
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:25,690
Give it to me,
I'll grill. You eat.

189
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,800
Thank you.

190
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:34,719
Sunbae, your hands
are for eating, huh?

191
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,809
Huh?

192
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:38,519
I always char the meat.

193
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,789
Attorney Kang is
great with the grill.

194
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:40,979
Grill the short ribs.

195
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:43,919
Grill everything.
Leave this right there.

196
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,379
You're so irritating.

197
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,429
I am?

198
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:49,149
Well, we can't have that.

199
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:50,150
Hang on.

200
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,526
- I'll pour you some water.
- Geez, forget it.

201
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:54,969
Please take it. We
can't have you irritated.

202
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:56,629
There, there, some cold water.

203
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,820
Irritating someone then
kissing up. That's talent.

204
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:03,129
Will you continue
to duke it out here?

205
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:05,169
No, that should be
done inside the ring.

206
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:07,339
Of course, to make it safe.

207
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,959
Or it'd be a wreck,
asking for trouble.

208
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,489
- I'll be fine, but...
- Yeah, right.

209
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:12,039
No way, we shouldn't.

210
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,389
Ms. Jung, it's well done.

211
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:16,840
- Please eat.
- Aigoo, thank you.

212
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:20,589
Attorney Kang.

213
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:22,649
I'm here, too. Please
don't forget me.

214
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:23,909
But I'm grilling.

215
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,050
Producer Koo.

216
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:27,470
Aigoo...

217
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:32,629
Hye Jin's glass is
empty. I didn't realize it.

218
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:34,779
Drink up.

219
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:37,429
Ma'am! I need a new glass.

220
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:38,679
It's cracked.

221
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,600
I can't use it.

222
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,270
- Bye.
- Goodnight.

223
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:47,880
Hello.

224
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:53,960
Pardon me...

225
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,439
Ms. Jung and I...

226
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,929
were both English
majors at school.

227
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:11,559
But she was closer to
Assemblyman Wie than I was.

228
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,529
Why, why?

229
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:16,909
They were both in
the student council.

230
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:20,110
They would pull
all-nighters together.

231
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:24,260
Yeah, we sure did.

232
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:28,499
Yeah, we did pull all-nighters.

233
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,639
We pulled all-nighters
for the student council.

234
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:35,569
But student council
doesn't mean we were close.

235
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:38,209
Man, you're making me sad.

236
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:40,489
I used to think so
well of you, Ms. Jung.

237
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:41,490
Think well of me?

238
00:12:41,491 --> 00:12:43,059
When did you ever?

239
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,359
- Aigoo, seriously...
- I'm curious!

240
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,059
How was Ms. Jung in college?

241
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,179
Me?

242
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:50,819
I was an ordinary girl.

243
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:53,999
Why are you curious,
Attorney Kang?

244
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,249
I know.

245
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,199
Why is he curious? Whatever.

246
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,810
I'm a curious cat, you know.

247
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:08,399
Actually, I have a very special
relationship with Ms. Jung.

248
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,889
She recently moved in
right across the street.

249
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:13,509
When I open the door,
I see her front door.

250
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:15,059
Excuse me, excuse me.

251
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:18,259
It's not a relationship,
it's a coincidence.

252
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,689
- Unni.
- Whatever you...

253
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:22,369
Repeated coincidences
lead to relationships.

254
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:23,379
That's right.

255
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:26,460
I think you two will
end up dating, no?

256
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,970
You just never know with people.

257
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:35,659
See, see? I didn't
know this would happen.

258
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:37,160
I didn't see this coming.

259
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,929
Aigoo, I'm sorry.

260
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:43,379
Why did you go and
spew such nonsense?

261
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:45,129
It's not spewing nonsense.

262
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:47,279
Of course, it's
nonsense. Am I crazy?

263
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,499
I wouldn't date
someone with four kids.

264
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,569
- That's just wrong.
- You're right.

265
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:55,920
You're right, I just
made a huge blooper.

266
00:13:58,230 --> 00:13:59,400
Please...

267
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,900
One line, please...

268
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,489
You were great today.

269
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:30,540
Get some rest.

270
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:33,259
Ms. Jung.

271
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:34,959
Well...

272
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,679
regarding our college days...

273
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,450
Why did you cut me
off all of a sudden?

274
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:43,639
I don't know.

275
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:46,100
It's been so long,
I don't remember.

276
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:52,439
Truthfully, I was sad.

277
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,769
I mean...

278
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:56,649
I understand you took
leave of absence from school,

279
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:59,890
but you had totally stopped
calling me cutting off all contact.

280
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:05,169
Sunbae, I see you hold grudges.

281
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:07,470
That's still wearing
on your mind?

282
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:11,819
It's not a grudge, really.

283
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,820
I was just curious.

284
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:17,599
Forget it.

285
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,499
Go on in.

286
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,679
Da Jung wasn't looking so well.

287
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,850
Please take good care of her.

288
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,809
Of course, it's
nonsense. Am I crazy?

289
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:39,910
I wouldn't date
someone with four kids.

290
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:50,029
Did you see the broadcast?

291
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:52,289
Of course, I did.

292
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:54,420
It's your first ever
TV appearance.

293
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:01,299
You know, I fell
head-over-heels all over again.

294
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,399
You looked great on camera.

295
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,700
You looked like a
girl group member.

296
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,969
Oppa, what are your thoughts?

297
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:10,169
I told you.

298
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:11,989
You looked super hot.

299
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:13,720
No, not about that.

300
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,789
About abortion.

301
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:19,229
Oh, that?

302
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:23,189
If in the case we
got pregnant...

303
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,899
what would you do?

304
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,059
"We should get rid of it..."

305
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:30,809
was how I used to think.

306
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:34,539
I was persuaded by your dad
after watching the broadcast.

307
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,529
A fetus is a life, too.

308
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:41,079
An abortion isn't an
easy matter to decide.

309
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,429
If it's not easy to decide...

310
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:45,899
are you saying you'll have
the baby or something?

311
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,729
Are you the one giving birth?

312
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:49,750
If we have it, how
will we raise it?

313
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:56,549
Hey...

314
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:58,949
Why are you getting upset?

315
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:00,959
This is why you're no good.

316
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,359
Since you're so indecisive,

317
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:05,289
you complain that being an
idol doesn't suit your taste!

318
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:06,599
Jung.

319
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,810
That was harsh.

320
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,570
Jung.

321
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:16,100
Geez...

322
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:24,590
Oh, God...

323
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:30,399
But the current abortion laws

324
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,279
don't allow much room
for exceptions to the rule.

325
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,979
And here is the crucial point.

326
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:38,699
We always omit something
when it comes to abortion.

327
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:41,189
The men's responsibility.

328
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:44,339
The current abortion laws
only penalize the women.

329
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:46,339
I believe men should suffer the

330
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:49,020
consequences rather than women.

331
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,340
(Newly revamped "Dispute"
receives roaring compliments)

332
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,109
Did you have an argument?

333
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:55,249
With whom?

334
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,839
With Dae Han oppa.

335
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,539
What about that guy?

336
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:01,259
Arguments occur only
when feelings are involved.

337
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,970
Since you didn't go
over there for breakfast.

338
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,259
I need to keep
him at a distance.

339
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:11,219
So there are no
misunderstandings.

340
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:14,579
They say a strong denial
means a strong yes.

341
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:15,719
Jung Ji Hyun.

342
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,519
Why do you keep
tying me to that man?

343
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,489
I feel like it's my fault.

344
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:21,739
What is?

345
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,730
You pushing Dae Han oppa away.

346
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,770
It's not like that, so
don't mind yourself.

347
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:36,269
"In a word, the newly
revamped "Dispute"

348
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:38,099
is a great showcase
for Wie Dae Han,

349
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:41,079
and a great show greatly
befitting Wie Dae Han."

350
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,879
Wow, such great words, really.

351
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,639
You see? This is the man I am.

352
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,110
Look at the article.

353
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,699
I'm a zombie.

354
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,299
Roar, roar, roar...

355
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,900
Hurry up and eat. Take
the rice off of your face.

356
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,610
Zombies don't use spoons.

357
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,570
Hey, if you keep this up, we're
back to cereal tomorrow, okay?

358
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:15,479
I'm a zombie, too...

359
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,690
Take the rice off of your face.

360
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,930
Unni, are you feeling sick?

361
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:30,419
I don't have much
of an appetite.

362
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:31,460
Why not?

363
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,100
You had ramen before bed, huh?

364
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:42,059
What's the matter with her?

365
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:44,840
I've never seen Unni like this.

366
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,820
(Jung Han Soo)

367
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,779
Yes, sir!

368
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,019
I saw the broadcast.

369
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:55,610
You still have a way with words.

370
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:58,169
Not just with words,

371
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:00,520
but I look fabulous
on camera, too.

372
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:03,419
Enough.

373
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:04,899
Let's meet up.

374
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,440
Come to City Hall.

375
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:08,779
Yes, sir.

376
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,569
Young people aren't the
only ones without homes!

377
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:12,519
We are renters, too!

378
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,559
We are renters, too!

379
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,249
We are renter, too!

380
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:18,129
The residents are
against enforcing

381
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:20,149
"Pooreun Rental Apartments."

382
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:21,999
Away with it, ASAP!

383
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,009
Away with it! Away with it!

384
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:25,789
Away with it! Away with it!

385
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:28,869
For Central City's advancement, an
international high school is the answer!

386
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:29,909
An international high school!

387
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:32,909
Aigoo, they're up and early.

388
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:36,179
The land site for a
prison is high in value.

389
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:38,329
Easy access to
transportation, too.

390
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:40,679
Depending on what gets built,

391
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,990
it'll affect the real
estate market.

392
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,399
That's why they're clamoring.

393
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,200
Make way for an international
high school, ASAP!

394
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:49,449
Make way! Make way!

395
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:51,379
Make way! Make way!

396
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:53,209
The residents are
heavily opposed.

397
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:54,829
How will you enforce
a rental apartment?

398
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:56,349
Yes, it's weighing on our minds.

399
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:59,349
That's probably why the
mayor wanted to see you.

400
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:00,829
Me?

401
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:02,249
Why me?

402
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,349
Since you're a hot
commodity these days,

403
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:07,109
perhaps you can
sway the public opinion.

404
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:08,549
Is that right?

405
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:09,749
Aigoo...

406
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,749
I guess he heard it
through the grapevine.

407
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,229
Aigoo, seriously.

408
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:16,310
Aigoo, what an effort, huh?

409
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,549
Huh? Soo Hyun's...

410
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:22,920
Stay here for a sec.

411
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:27,009
Father.

412
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:28,449
Why, hello.

413
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:29,909
You remember me,
right? Wie Dae Han.

414
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:31,729
I'm Soo Hyun's college sunbae.

415
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:34,409
Good seeing you here, Father.

416
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:37,539
Yes, I do remember, but...

417
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:40,569
Why are you calling me "father"?

418
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:44,319
Well, I do have a close
relationship with Soo Hyun.

419
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,509
We even work
together these days.

420
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:47,929
But...

421
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:50,089
what is this early
morning protest about?

422
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:51,599
Do I need to spell it out?

423
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,089
We're protesting
the rental apartments.

424
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:55,459
I see.

425
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:56,659
That's great.

426
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:59,000
I'm on my way to see the mayor.

427
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:02,489
Do you know the
mayor personally?

428
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:04,939
Aigoo, not only do I know him,

429
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:06,689
I used to be Mayor Jung's aide.

430
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:09,150
I call him "hyung"
when we're off duty.

431
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:12,640
You should've
mentioned this before.

432
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:19,029
Okay then, go see the
mayor and put in a good word.

433
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:22,949
I'm the president of Inju
Market Retailers Association.

434
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:27,029
Why build this"Pooreun
Rental Apartments" in our town?

435
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:29,130
It'll look depressing.

436
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:32,479
Young people aren't the
only ones without homes!

437
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,449
I'm not a homeowner,
thus a renter.

438
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:37,589
- Relay this message for us.
- Yes, yes.

439
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:38,889
- Isn't that right?
- Yes, please!

440
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:40,249
No, that's not it.

441
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:43,489
He has a close, personal
relationship with the mayor.

442
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:45,309
- No, I...
- That's great!

443
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:46,859
Wie Dae Han, Wie Dae Han.

444
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:49,829
Wie Dae Han! Wie Dae Han!

445
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:51,659
- Please put in a good word.
- Yes, will do.

446
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:53,739
All right, all right.
Let's give him a hand.

447
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:56,140
- You can do it!
- Thank you for your help!

448
00:22:58,430 --> 00:23:01,879
Hey, I don't think I
would be of any help.

449
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,979
That's true.

450
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:06,569
There is more support for an international
high school than an apartment.

451
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:08,589
Kang Kyung Hoon
is leading that project.

452
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:11,209
Kang Kyung Hoon pledged the
school during the election, right?

453
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:12,160
That is correct.

454
00:23:12,161 --> 00:23:13,959
What I'm questioning is...

455
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,839
I get that Kang Kyung
Hoon's supporters are

456
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,359
in the upper class,
older, and homeowners.

457
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:21,730
But why is Han Soo hyung
so keen on this apartment?

458
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:27,359
Our party is focused on winning
over young people at the moment.

459
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,549
Unless we grab their votes, the
general election won't be easy.

460
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:34,059
Well, the 20s and 30s
demographic is different from before.

461
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:36,409
The young people
will get their homes,

462
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:38,349
and our party will
grab their votes.

463
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:40,120
It's an easy win-win.

464
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:45,829
If you push this ahead successfully,
you'll receive the party's recognition.

465
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:48,439
It'll be good for
you too, Hyungnim.

466
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,369
That would be the
icing on the cake.

467
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:52,199
But Hyungnim.

468
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,039
I understand the party's
and your situation,

469
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,659
but give me a break, huh?

470
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:58,469
No one is asking you to die.

471
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:00,369
Hyungnim, you know this.

472
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:04,279
You have more voters in their 40s
and 50s than the 20s and 30s here.

473
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,229
Why else would Kang
Kyung Hoon push for the

474
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:08,509
international high school
and not the apartment?

475
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:11,529
He already calculated
the number of votes.

476
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:14,250
Kang Kyung Hoon and
you are in different situations.

477
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:16,569
What do you mean?

478
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:18,569
Different in what ways?

479
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:22,709
You're aware that many members
of our party dislike you, right?

480
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:25,469
It's too early in the
day for a beating.

481
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:28,569
If I abandon you as
well, you'll be nothing,

482
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:29,969
a complete outcast.

483
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:31,079
Your nomination?

484
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,009
You'll be without a party.

485
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:34,649
What gives? You're scaring me.

486
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:36,839
You should be scared.

487
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,239
I'm the one who
got you in "Dispute."

488
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:42,620
If I can get you in, it means
I can take you out, too.

489
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:49,089
Did you get me in
there to use me for this?

490
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:51,389
I'm saying it'll be a win-win.

491
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:55,029
Pooreun Rental Apartments
will have 2,000 units.

492
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:58,570
Once that gets built, who'll
receive those 2-3,000 votes?

493
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,400
If you get nominated,
those votes will be yours.

494
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:08,839
Guys, the bell rang.

495
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,260
Hello, sir.

496
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:16,969
Han Da Jung isn't here yet?

497
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:18,959
I'm sure she's ditching.

498
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,119
Ditching?

499
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,039
She's gone bonkers.

500
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,950
She comes out on TV
and starts ditching school.

501
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,300
So Mom.

502
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,600
My biological dad is
really an assemblyman?

503
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,900
Of course he is.

504
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:55,790
I wouldn't lie about that.

505
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:59,440
Then why am I a bad student?

506
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,309
Your scores are out, huh?

507
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:03,629
Yup.

508
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:05,379
I got third place this time.

509
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:07,060
From the bottom.

510
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,499
Look at you talking about
your dad to avoid trouble.

511
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,499
Geez, you figured it out?

512
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,289
You're so quick.

513
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:17,380
You're cleverer than
an assemblyman.

514
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:23,319
But Mom, how gutsy
were you to have me?

515
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,039
What do you mean, gutsy?

516
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:28,239
You know. Without a dad.

517
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,289
If it were me, I wouldn't have.

518
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:32,609
How can you raise a child alone?

519
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:34,610
Because I'm a mother.

520
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:40,599
The best decision
I've ever made...

521
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,030
is giving birth to you, Da Jung.

522
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:49,710
Thank you for
giving birth to me.

523
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:57,989
Jung.

524
00:26:57,990 --> 00:27:00,359
Did something
happen with your dad?

525
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:04,169
If your dad upsets
you again, just tell me.

526
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:05,950
I'll run over there right away.

527
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:15,159
So did you have a
nice talk with the mayor?

528
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,969
Yes, sure.

529
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:21,339
But the thing is, this will be
more difficult than we think.

530
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:25,189
The government has already
given its seal of approval.

531
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:28,059
Therefore, we can't
blindly put a stop to it.

532
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:29,969
We know that, too.

533
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:33,299
This is why we
must find a solution.

534
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:36,079
Man, this isn't how
I figured you'd be.

535
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,669
So frustrating.

536
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:38,670
Geez.

537
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:41,289
But Father.

538
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:45,639
Is there a particular reason you're
so opposed to the rental apartments?

539
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,959
I honestly don't
care whether it's an

540
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:50,749
international high school
or rental apartments.

541
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:52,559
Then why are you protesting?

542
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,489
I know you're
busy with the store.

543
00:27:54,490 --> 00:27:56,300
You have no idea.

544
00:27:57,630 --> 00:27:59,679
During the protest,

545
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:02,099
you saw that woman on the
podium making a fuss, right?

546
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:05,709
We oppose the Pooreun
Apartments from ruining our town!

547
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:07,649
We oppose! We oppose!

548
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:09,349
The woman holding the megaphone?

549
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:10,949
- Yup.
- Yes, yes.

550
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:14,929
She's the chairwoman of the
pro-international high school committee.

551
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:17,809
She has a reputation
for stirring things up.

552
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:22,459
One word from her, the ahjummas
in this town will cause a raucous.

553
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:24,599
I see.

554
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:29,199
If you cross her, it could
hurt your business, correct?

555
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,259
That goes without saying.

556
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:33,399
If that ahjumma

557
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,719
posts something on a mom's cafe,

558
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,649
we'll lose half of our sales.

559
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:38,829
We'll be ruined.

560
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:40,520
How could I not participate?

561
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:44,189
Hello, I'm Kang Kyung Hoon.

562
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:45,589
- Hello, sir.
- Yes, hello.

563
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:47,030
Goodness, what on earth...

564
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,200
Yes, yes.

565
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:55,369
Assemblyman Wie.

566
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:57,579
How long has it been?

567
00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:00,109
Your popularity is
shooting through the roof.

568
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:02,409
You're even nicknamed
"The Nation's Dad."

569
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:04,499
I guess I am hot, indeed.

570
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,799
Even an older assemblyman
such as you are informed.

571
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,889
That was uncalled for.

572
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:11,289
You're "The Nation's Dad."

573
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:13,339
You should be more gracious,

574
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:14,569
and set an example.

575
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:15,939
I should be gracious.

576
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:17,559
But depending on the person,

577
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,110
I'll set an example.

578
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:25,709
When you were in high school,

579
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:28,919
you were so nice
and well-mannered.

580
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:32,559
I see Yeouido has ruined you.

581
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,269
Assemblyman Kang.

582
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:35,720
My mom's restaurant...

583
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,699
Our lives depend on it.

584
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:41,739
Please spare our lives...

585
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:44,079
Please help us.

586
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,840
I humbly ask of you.

587
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:51,240
I miss your mom's
blood sausage soup.

588
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:04,249
I'll try to turn around
the town's opinion.

589
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:05,899
You told me not
to hold my breath.

590
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,619
Why the sudden change of heart?

591
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:08,470
No, no.

592
00:30:08,471 --> 00:30:10,519
It's nonsense,
however I look at it.

593
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:13,099
Young people's homes shouldn't be
prevented by a special high school.

594
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,559
Of course, it shouldn't be.

595
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,740
Hyungnim.

596
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:19,199
I wasn't just
abandoned by my party.

597
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,979
My own father abandoned me, too.

598
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:22,609
I know your story too well.

599
00:30:22,610 --> 00:30:25,749
I'll hold onto your hand.
Let's join forces and...

600
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:28,409
oust Kang Kyung Hoon.

601
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:30,879
We must get rid of
the mayor, the mayor.

602
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,740
I agree.

603
00:30:31,741 --> 00:30:33,819
All he does is
brown-nose the higher-ups.

604
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:36,159
He has zero interest
in improving our district.

605
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,229
- I know!
- So true.

606
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:39,239
Having an
international high school

607
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:42,019
will be good for the
education and the real estate.

608
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:43,449
- You're right.
- House prices will go up.

609
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:44,779
What rental apartment?

610
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:48,389
Hello, ladies. I'm
sorry to interrupt, but...

611
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:51,339
Do you know who I
am by any chance?

612
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:54,279
Of course, I know.
"The Nation's Dad."

613
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,409
He was on TV last night.

614
00:30:56,410 --> 00:30:58,179
- Yes, yes.
- I watched, too.

615
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:00,599
Goodness, you
look better in person.

616
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,059
- I know!
- Look at his eyebrows.

617
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,650
They're like charcoals.

618
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:07,249
Aigoo, you're very observant.

619
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:08,919
Aigoo, thank you.

620
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,979
I'm sure you know from
last night's broadcast,

621
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:13,109
but we have a segment
for proposing bills.

622
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:15,629
I'd love to hear
you ladies' opinions.

623
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:18,319
If you don't mind, would
you allow me to join you?

624
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,039
I don't see why not.

625
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,109
Scoot over.

626
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:23,369
- Have a seat, have a seat.
- Yes, thank you.

627
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:24,779
Aigoo, thank you.

628
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:27,590
You ladies are affectionate
and open-minded.

629
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:32,459
What would you
like to hear from us?

630
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:33,920
Yes, well...

631
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,200
On the broadcast,
we propose bills.

632
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:40,009
I thought it'd be fitting if the
bill pertained to our district.

633
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:42,119
- Goodness...
- Yes, I have one.

634
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:45,879
You know the city is enforcing
this "Pooreun Apartment," right?

635
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:48,719
Oh, yes. Yes, I heard of it.

636
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,439
Please propose a law to
prohibit the city from doing that.

637
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,879
- Yes, please.
- They shouldn't.

638
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,669
Yes, yes, give me a minute.

639
00:31:54,670 --> 00:32:00,139
Okay, "Stop the city from
building rental apartments."

640
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:02,029
- Yes.
- That's it, that's it.

641
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:06,099
If I may, what is the reason
you're opposed to this?

642
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:09,219
If that gets built, the
housing prices will drop.

643
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:10,080
Of course.

644
00:32:10,081 --> 00:32:11,869
It's a violation of
our property rights.

645
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:14,049
- Yes, it is.
- My house will be devalued.

646
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:16,069
"The house prices will drop."

647
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:16,880
Right.

648
00:32:16,881 --> 00:32:21,639
But has a rental apartment ever
caused the housing prices to drop?

649
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,799
I haven't heard of such a thing.

650
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:24,899
Has there?

651
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,899
- Have you heard?
- No one?

652
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:28,599
What do you mean you haven't?

653
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,759
It's the same story everywhere.

654
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:33,019
- It's true everywhere.
- Our town and other areas.

655
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:34,639
- That's how it is.
- I know.

656
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,659
"This town and other areas."

657
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:41,359
So where exactly...

658
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,229
Please don't misunderstand.

659
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:45,529
Ladies, TV shows do require

660
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:48,099
for us to provide
the correct source.

661
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,169
That's why.

662
00:32:49,170 --> 00:32:51,389
They do require
the correct source.

663
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:53,909
Why are you
requesting that from me?

664
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:55,930
Do I work at City
Hall or something?

665
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,899
So you're saying...

666
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:04,419
there are no solid
grounds on your claim...

667
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:05,790
Is that right?

668
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:09,619
What do you think you're doing?

669
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:12,329
You're picking a fight on the
premise of asking our opinion.

670
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:13,609
I'm not picking a fight.

671
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:16,459
My alma mater is
the "C" University.

672
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:18,469
Before you lecture others,

673
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:19,889
take care of your kids first.

674
00:33:19,890 --> 00:33:21,519
But ma'am, what you just said...

675
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,860
This is not worth our
time. Let's get going.

676
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:25,400
Okay, okay.

677
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,500
My apologies.

678
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:36,090
Forget logic. They're
just opposed to it.

679
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:40,060
Sunbae.

680
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,759
I see many positive reactions
in women's cafes online.

681
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:45,789
Regarding Assemblyman Wie.

682
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:49,509
It was a calculated move to grab
both women's and conservative votes.

683
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:52,179
And our ratings
are up respectively.

684
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:54,779
Since it's up, we
should maintain it, right?

685
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:57,140
Everyone, let's see
your ideas for the "bills."

686
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:08,890
If you have time later, let's
get the coupon stamped.

687
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:23,519
I prefer this place over a cafe.

688
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,609
I see.

689
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:27,029
Is this really your first
time at an internet cafe?

690
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:28,219
Yes.

691
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:30,190
I guess it is.

692
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:35,799
But I served full-term
as a sergeant in the army.

693
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:38,700
I've done shooting
practices, too.

694
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:43,050
Then let's see
how well you shoot.

695
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:45,140
Shall we?

696
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:49,929
Left side, 355, two enemies.

697
00:34:49,930 --> 00:34:50,900
What?

698
00:34:50,901 --> 00:34:53,199
What? Where, where are they?

699
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,099
Aigoo, what are you doing?

700
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:57,359
- Are you asking to get killed?
- What?

701
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,549
Ms. Jung, where are you?

702
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:00,769
The house in back. I'm inside.

703
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:02,339
The house in the back?

704
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:04,129
What are you looking at?

705
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:06,200
Please snap out of it.

706
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:12,179
I... I... I think
I've been shot.

707
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:13,729
It appears that way.

708
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:15,259
Give me a minute,
I'll be there soon.

709
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:17,160
Where are they shooting from?

710
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:21,000
Geez, startled me.

711
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:24,899
Aigoo, you people are too much!

712
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:27,699
Today is my first
time, and you're all...

713
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,220
How could you do this?

714
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,319
What?

715
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,679
At least, give me
a decent excuse.

716
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,779
Your reason for skipping
school is, "Just because"?

717
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:40,009
If you're not happy
with my answer,

718
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:42,429
think whatever you want.

719
00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:44,539
Is this teenage angst?

720
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:46,220
Tak is more than I can handle.

721
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:51,039
You think you're the
only one overwhelmed?

722
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,180
I'm overwhelmed, too!

723
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:56,950
Hey...

724
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,059
Song Yi.

725
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,970
Did I do something wrong?

726
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,299
Tae Poong?

727
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:06,999
Did I do something wrong?

728
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,800
Your mere existence is wrong.

729
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:12,389
That's right.

730
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:14,009
I'm sorry.

731
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:16,739
I've committed a great sin.

732
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:18,419
I should go and die.

733
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:19,810
I should die...

734
00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:23,009
Eat your food.

735
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:25,659
I should go and
die, yes, I should...

736
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:27,519
Yes, who is it?

737
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,869
Is this Assemblyman
Wie Dae Han's home?

738
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:32,179
Yes, it is, but...

739
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:33,319
Who are you?

740
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,639
I'm...

741
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,049
your son, Assemblyman Wie.

742
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:38,400
Excuse me?

743
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:42,989
Man, what a crazy bastard.

744
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:44,969
How could you be my son, punk?

745
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:47,679
Am I that fertile?
Having kids everywhere?

746
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,419
You stay right there.

747
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:51,699
Father, please calm down.

748
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:54,269
I'm Da Jung's boyfriend.

749
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:55,330
What?

750
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:08,329
It's very nice to meet you.

751
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:11,009
I'm Choi Jung Woo,
Da Jung's boyfriend.

752
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:12,649
How old are you?

753
00:37:12,650 --> 00:37:13,729
I'm 20 years old.

754
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:15,449
Actually, I'm still 19.

755
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:17,099
If you're 20, you're in college?

756
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:19,100
I didn't go to college.

757
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:24,369
If you're not in school,
what do you do?

758
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:26,109
I'm an idol trainee.

759
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:29,919
My goal is to debut this
year. I'm working very hard.

760
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,520
Idol?

761
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,800
Yes...

762
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:40,300
I've heard a thing
or two about that.

763
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,449
Training doesn't
mean any guarantees.

764
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:43,699
You're right.

765
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:45,359
It's not easy at all.

766
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:48,199
But if I give up
due to difficulties,

767
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,809
then it's not a dream.

768
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:52,969
From that standpoint, I have
much respect for you, Father.

769
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:54,669
Respect?

770
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:57,839
The passionate
drive for your goal...

771
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,379
My respects!

772
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:01,859
You even did the three-step
pilgrimage for your assemblyman seat.

773
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:03,389
Plus designated driving, too.

774
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:06,069
I was wowed by
last night's broadcast.

775
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:07,949
You have such a way with words.

776
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:11,369
I've become a huge
fan of yours, Father.

777
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:12,660
A huge fan?

778
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,159
Okay, I got it. That's enough.

779
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,310
You can leave now.

780
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,489
Okay, I'll walk you out.

781
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:25,550
- Hyung!
- Yes?

782
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,199
Please sleep over.

783
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,200
We didn't get to play.

784
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:33,099
I want to hear you sing, Oppa.

785
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:34,919
I'll spend the night next time.

786
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:35,910
What?

787
00:38:35,911 --> 00:38:37,140
You'll be back?

788
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:39,300
Spend the night?

789
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:42,000
Of course, Da Jung is here.

790
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,400
See you next time, Father.

791
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,269
You know, this was
wearing on my nerves.

792
00:38:56,270 --> 00:38:58,039
Why are you calling me "father"?

793
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:00,550
Then should I call
you Father-in-law?

794
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,549
He's crazy.

795
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:06,470
Nuts.

796
00:39:06,471 --> 00:39:09,030
Then on a friendlier note...

797
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:11,179
Dad.

798
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:12,490
Dada.

799
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:28,059
You must be busy, why
come all the way here?

800
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:30,109
Aigoo...

801
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:32,599
It's because of you, Jung.

802
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:35,069
You hung up on me last night,

803
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:36,929
and you ignore my texts.

804
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:39,509
Of course, I would be worried.

805
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:41,870
Are your debut
preparations going well?

806
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:46,000
Totally.

807
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:48,260
Ta-da!

808
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:52,119
What's this?

809
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,399
It's our CD.

810
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:56,099
Our debut date
has been confirmed.

811
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:58,000
It's two months later.

812
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:02,609
That's great.

813
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:05,839
Truthfully, I came
to give you this.

814
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:08,329
I'm making my
debut, thanks to you.

815
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:12,959
You're the one who videotaped
me singing and uploaded it online.

816
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,279
That's why the
agency contacted me.

817
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:19,589
So if I don't make it, you'll
have to take responsibility.

818
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:21,549
For life.

819
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:24,009
What if you become a star?

820
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:25,649
Then...

821
00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:28,269
I'll take
responsibility for you.

822
00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:30,190
For life.

823
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:35,289
- Actually...
- Hey.

824
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:37,630
The bus is here. I'm off.

825
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:45,970
Congrats on your debut.

826
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:51,340
Bye, bye.

827
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:13,819
You didn't look happy
today. Now I feel sad.

828
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:17,550
Just wait. I'll always
make you smile.

829
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,459
Oppa.

830
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:25,720
Actually, I'm preg...

831
00:41:27,870 --> 00:41:30,279
Our debut date
has been confirmed.

832
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,860
It's two months later.

833
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:45,289
Attorney Kang, I've
never seen you so upset.

834
00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:47,370
Your gentle image
was all an act, huh?

835
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:50,429
As I was playing,

836
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:51,959
my competitive
spirit came alive.

837
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:54,679
Whoa, competitive spirit?
You're not that good...

838
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,419
Let's go another
round next time.

839
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:58,910
Don't be asking me
to go easy on you.

840
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:03,709
I thought you were a pacifist,
but you're a total god of war.

841
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:07,579
I am a god of war,
but I'm also petty...

842
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:10,509
Honestly, it's bothering me.

843
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:12,260
What is?

844
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:16,259
You live close to him.

845
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:19,279
You'll be seeing Dae Han a lot.

846
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,059
Oh...

847
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:24,669
I do see him around whatnot,

848
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:27,339
but it's because
of the kids, not him.

849
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:29,040
By kids, you mean...

850
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:31,919
his kids?

851
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,279
Yes.

852
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,549
Four kids who live with Sunbae.

853
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:37,729
The girl who was on our set

854
00:42:37,730 --> 00:42:39,839
seems savvier than her age.

855
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:43,239
Well, she may seem
mature on the outside,

856
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:44,889
but she's still a kid.

857
00:42:44,890 --> 00:42:47,670
It's only been two months
since she lost her mom.

858
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:50,289
I feel sorry for her.

859
00:42:50,290 --> 00:42:54,180
She doesn't let it on and
takes care of her siblings.

860
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,689
I know I'm petty,

861
00:42:58,690 --> 00:43:00,609
but I'm on the smart side.

862
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:02,339
It's understandable.

863
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:04,240
How you feel.

864
00:43:11,930 --> 00:43:13,369
Hey, Da Jung.

865
00:43:13,370 --> 00:43:14,599
Unni.

866
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:15,879
Are you home?

867
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:17,510
No, I'm out. Why?

868
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:20,710
I need to talk to you
about something.

869
00:43:21,830 --> 00:43:23,519
It's because of Sunbae, huh?

870
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:24,699
What did he do now?

871
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:26,649
No, that's not it...

872
00:43:26,650 --> 00:43:28,150
Unni...

873
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:30,800
What should I do?

874
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:35,130
Da Jung, where are you?

875
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:38,629
What?

876
00:43:38,630 --> 00:43:40,239
You're pregnant?

877
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:42,060
What are you talking about?

878
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:49,600
Da Jung.

879
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:53,000
Did you go to the hospital?

880
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,690
Not yet.

881
00:43:56,130 --> 00:43:58,790
I did the pregnancy test.

882
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:02,399
With whom? When did this happen?

883
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,000
He's two years older than me.

884
00:44:06,570 --> 00:44:10,929
It happened about a month
before Mom's accident.

885
00:44:10,930 --> 00:44:12,670
If he's two years older...

886
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:15,399
He's 20?

887
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:17,319
What a crazy bastard!

888
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:18,939
No, Unni.

889
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:20,900
It's not like that...

890
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:28,930
You're saying it was consensual?

891
00:44:32,630 --> 00:44:33,749
Yes.

892
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:35,179
Han Da Jung.

893
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:37,749
You're a high school
junior. A minor.

894
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:40,170
Even though it was mutual,
you should've held off.

895
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:44,639
You're way too young
to be in this state.

896
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:45,940
That's why...

897
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:50,790
I'm being punished.

898
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:09,289
Am I...

899
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:11,310
the only one who knows?

900
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:14,020
Yes.

901
00:45:22,950 --> 00:45:24,179
For now,

902
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:27,959
let's go to the hospital
tomorrow and get you examined.

903
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:31,620
Then we'll think about
what we'll do afterward.

904
00:45:32,870 --> 00:45:34,460
I don't want...

905
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:38,500
Ahjussi to know about this.

906
00:45:49,070 --> 00:45:50,719
Your speculation was correct.

907
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:53,399
Kang Kyung Hoon discreetly
looks after Jae Eun's mom.

908
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:54,519
How?

909
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:57,980
Assemblyman Kang's youngest
aide is Jae Eun's mom's nephew.

910
00:45:59,010 --> 00:46:00,679
Of course.

911
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:03,089
She was suspiciously
supportive of him.

912
00:46:03,090 --> 00:46:05,399
What about the pro-international
school committee?

913
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:08,809
It centers around Jae Eun's mom
with some mothers being key members.

914
00:46:08,810 --> 00:46:10,419
The rest are all sorts, but...

915
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:12,639
many are also members of
the Market Retailers Association.

916
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:13,670
Is that right?

917
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:16,900
Is that so?

918
00:46:19,350 --> 00:46:23,339
Do you know which war strategy
is used for an effortless victory?

919
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:24,510
What is it?

920
00:46:25,550 --> 00:46:27,030
Dissonance.

921
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:31,669
Why use such a fancy term?

922
00:46:31,670 --> 00:46:33,199
It's driving a wedge
between everyone.

923
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:36,219
Man, punk, you
sound so ignorant.

924
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:37,839
Hey, regardless,

925
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:40,889
if you cause an internal dissonance,
this will be a walk in the park.

926
00:46:40,890 --> 00:46:41,900
Okay?

927
00:46:46,730 --> 00:46:50,490
It seems Wie Dae Han is
involved with the rental apartments.

928
00:46:54,430 --> 00:46:56,840
He's siding with Mayor Jung.

929
00:46:58,210 --> 00:46:59,859
That's why they're losers.

930
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:02,809
They always pick the wrong team.

931
00:47:02,810 --> 00:47:06,939
The current public opinion is heavily
sided with international high school.

932
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:08,580
No need for you to worry.

933
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:12,029
Public opinion is
not to be trusted.

934
00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:14,449
Hire a good photographer

935
00:47:14,450 --> 00:47:16,280
and have him tail Wie Dae Han.

936
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:20,949
A tree with many branches
will suffer from the wind.

937
00:47:20,950 --> 00:47:22,370
Yes, sir.

938
00:47:28,590 --> 00:47:30,349
I'm hungry.

939
00:47:30,350 --> 00:47:32,109
When are we having chicken?

940
00:47:32,110 --> 00:47:34,179
We're almost there.
Be patient, okay?

941
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:35,419
Song Yi.

942
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:36,899
Remember what we practiced?

943
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:39,730
- Yes. I'll do my best.
- Fighting.

944
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:46,419
Eat slowly. You'll
get a tummy ache.

945
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:49,019
Eat as much as you want.

946
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:50,599
- Eat.
- So...

947
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:53,279
any update on the
rental apartment issue?

948
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,079
Well, that's...

949
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:58,059
I investigated meticulously
to assess the situation.

950
00:47:58,060 --> 00:48:01,919
But it's the opposite of the
rumors that are floating around.

951
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,349
What do you mean
it's the opposite?

952
00:48:03,350 --> 00:48:06,619
The biggest concern for those
opposing the rental apartments

953
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:08,859
is first, the house
prices dropping.

954
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:11,439
And second, the town
becoming like a slum.

955
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:12,390
True.

956
00:48:12,391 --> 00:48:14,799
The town becoming
like a slum, my foot.

957
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,819
After a large number
of newcomers,

958
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:19,509
the area becomes more
commercialized in most districts.

959
00:48:19,510 --> 00:48:20,839
Really?

960
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:24,449
Aigoo, look at you, so fickle.

961
00:48:24,450 --> 00:48:26,799
I'm not fickle.

962
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:29,139
He says the
businesses will liven up.

963
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:30,120
And?

964
00:48:30,121 --> 00:48:32,689
- It's common sense, really.
- Yes.

965
00:48:32,690 --> 00:48:35,369
If the town has an influx of
young people in their 20's and 30's,

966
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:37,109
the area will become
lively if anything.

967
00:48:37,110 --> 00:48:39,479
What harm would
it be to the town?

968
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:41,029
You're so right.

969
00:48:41,030 --> 00:48:43,459
- Yes.
- What do you mean? Using that logic,

970
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:45,449
international high
school isn't bad, either.

971
00:48:45,450 --> 00:48:46,459
No, it isn't.

972
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:49,019
I agree with my wifey even more.

973
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:51,169
No, it won't be bad, either.

974
00:48:51,170 --> 00:48:54,169
But let's say an international
high school is built.

975
00:48:54,170 --> 00:48:56,799
Does it serve you in any way?

976
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,350
Well, it...

977
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:04,859
Truthfully, it doesn't
serve us in any way.

978
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:07,509
Our Soo Hyun is past
the high school age.

979
00:49:07,510 --> 00:49:09,169
This is what I'm saying!

980
00:49:09,170 --> 00:49:12,790
Soo Hyun's current villa is old
and not conveniently located.

981
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:16,200
If the rental apartments get built,
it's affordable and in a great location.

982
00:49:16,230 --> 00:49:18,890
How nice would it
be for her to live in?

983
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:22,540
That does make sense. Yes.

984
00:49:25,330 --> 00:49:27,019
And also...

985
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:30,090
thinking back to their old
place brings tears to my eyes.

986
00:49:36,910 --> 00:49:40,749
There were so many cockroaches,

987
00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:42,979
and cracks in the walls.

988
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:46,509
I prayed every night
before going to bed.

989
00:49:46,510 --> 00:49:49,099
"Please don't let
our house collapse."

990
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:51,259
Aigoo, you poor dear.

991
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:53,649
- Aigoo...
- Aigoo, aigoo...

992
00:49:53,650 --> 00:49:57,309
The kids went through so much.

993
00:49:57,310 --> 00:49:58,469
Aigoo...

994
00:49:58,470 --> 00:50:01,189
My kids' previous
living conditions...

995
00:50:01,190 --> 00:50:04,859
It's due to the gross
shortage of rental apartments.

996
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:06,649
I'm personally
vested in this issue.

997
00:50:06,650 --> 00:50:07,889
Right, right.

998
00:50:07,890 --> 00:50:11,359
All parents feel the same way.

999
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:12,719
I frankly...

1000
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:16,879
feel people should be politically
vocal depending on their needs.

1001
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:19,949
This is why I don't
blame Jae Eun's mom.

1002
00:50:19,950 --> 00:50:21,099
Huh?

1003
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:23,719
I mean, Assemblyman Kang
Kyung Hoon looks after her.

1004
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:27,049
It's only natural she
fanatically takes his side.

1005
00:50:27,050 --> 00:50:29,659
What, what do you mean by that?

1006
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:31,109
You didn't know?

1007
00:50:31,110 --> 00:50:33,309
Jae Eun's mom's nephew...

1008
00:50:33,310 --> 00:50:35,469
He works at Assemblyman
Kang Kyung Hoon's office.

1009
00:50:35,470 --> 00:50:36,620
What?

1010
00:50:38,090 --> 00:50:39,659
What the heck are
you talking about?

1011
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:40,799
Then...

1012
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:44,689
you're saying I was a pawn in
Assemblyman Kang Kyung Hoon and

1013
00:50:44,690 --> 00:50:46,229
that woman's chess game?

1014
00:50:46,230 --> 00:50:49,399
Aigoo, you had no idea. I
thought you knew already.

1015
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:53,079
Anyhow, you should be more
vocal from now on, Father.

1016
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:54,539
Aigoo, what the hell.

1017
00:50:54,540 --> 00:50:57,439
- Aigoo, what the hell?
- Aigoo, aigoo...

1018
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:00,309
This means I've been

1019
00:51:00,310 --> 00:51:04,899
protesting at the wrong
rally this whole time!

1020
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:06,959
- Aigoo, aigoo...
- Aigoo...

1021
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:08,079
I guess you didn't know.

1022
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:09,700
Aigoo, we're so stupid, aigoo...

1023
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,860
You see the fetus, right?

1024
00:51:15,050 --> 00:51:17,280
It looks to be about 11 weeks.

1025
00:51:35,410 --> 00:51:38,740
I should tell Oppa, right?

1026
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:41,609
You should.

1027
00:51:41,610 --> 00:51:43,839
If you want, I'll go with you.

1028
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:47,150
If you're angry, I'll
beat him up for you.

1029
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:51,939
What's there to be angry about?

1030
00:51:51,940 --> 00:51:54,149
We made this mess together.

1031
00:51:54,150 --> 00:51:56,789
Wanting to keep this
away from Sunbae...

1032
00:51:56,790 --> 00:51:59,109
I understand how you feel,

1033
00:51:59,110 --> 00:52:00,880
but I don't think it's right.

1034
00:52:01,770 --> 00:52:02,899
Then what?

1035
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:04,799
He's your dad.

1036
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,999
No matter what you decide,

1037
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:11,030
I think it's right to go
through this together.

1038
00:52:18,550 --> 00:52:19,719
All right.

1039
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:22,759
I'll turn everyone at the
market back to our side.

1040
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:24,929
- Don't even worry about it.
- Yes, sir.

1041
00:52:24,930 --> 00:52:28,919
Thinking about it, Soo Hyun is so virtuous
and always sides with the underdog.

1042
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:31,279
I guess she takes
after you, Father.

1043
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:33,069
Geez, stop it.

1044
00:52:33,070 --> 00:52:34,270
Well, she is my blood.

1045
00:52:36,230 --> 00:52:37,990
Excuse me for a second.

1046
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:41,169
It's Soo Hyun.

1047
00:52:41,170 --> 00:52:42,750
Yes?

1048
00:52:48,690 --> 00:52:50,139
Jung.

1049
00:52:50,140 --> 00:52:53,639
Stop making me wait
and just tell me, won't you?

1050
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:55,670
I really have to get back.

1051
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:59,549
What is it that you can't
tell me over the phone?

1052
00:52:59,550 --> 00:53:02,129
I took Da Jung to the hospital.

1053
00:53:02,130 --> 00:53:03,679
Why?

1054
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,619
Is Da Jung sick or something?

1055
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:07,120
I'm pregnant.

1056
00:53:08,050 --> 00:53:09,280
She's 11 weeks along.

1057
00:53:10,150 --> 00:53:12,710
The guy who came
over last night is the dad.

1058
00:53:13,630 --> 00:53:15,519
What the heck?

1059
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:17,240
Stop joking around.

1060
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:22,109
Geez, really.

1061
00:53:22,110 --> 00:53:25,949
I can tell by your eyes
if you're lying or not.

1062
00:53:25,950 --> 00:53:27,969
What a crock of bull.

1063
00:53:27,970 --> 00:53:29,159
Seriously...

1064
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:31,409
Sunbae, do I look like
I would joke about this?

1065
00:53:31,410 --> 00:53:32,470
Yeah.

1066
00:53:37,690 --> 00:53:40,479
You're scaring me,
what's going on?

1067
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:42,599
It almost seems real.

1068
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:44,230
It is.

1069
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:48,160
It is...

1070
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:51,660
It is?

1071
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:56,720
Yes.

1072
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,270
Where is Da Jung?

1073
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:02,100
Please stay calm.

1074
00:54:02,150 --> 00:54:04,599
Sit down and think through
what your options are.

1075
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:06,279
How can I think
calmly right now?

1076
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:07,829
Da Jung is still a minor.

1077
00:54:07,830 --> 00:54:10,340
- She's only in high school!
- That's why...

1078
00:54:11,430 --> 00:54:13,559
you must stay
centered as her dad,

1079
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:15,970
and make rational decisions.

1080
00:54:17,570 --> 00:54:18,709
Oh, God...

1081
00:54:18,710 --> 00:54:22,339
I stressed during the broadcast
that abortions are immoral!

1082
00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:25,710
How could things
go down like this?

1083
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:30,639
Are you worried about
Da Jung or for yourself?

1084
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:33,069
I'm worried about
both. Both of us!

1085
00:54:33,070 --> 00:54:35,359
Da Jung is suffering
100 times more right now.

1086
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:36,599
She should suffer.

1087
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:38,950
She made this mess,
so she should suffer!

1088
00:54:40,370 --> 00:54:42,180
Godd♪ it.

1089
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:45,509
Where is this bastard?

1090
00:54:45,510 --> 00:54:47,730
That bastard made this mess.

1091
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:50,300
(Ahjussi)

1092
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:55,210
My God...

1093
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:06,850
Yes.

1094
00:55:06,851 --> 00:55:09,249
I'll text you the address.
Bring that punk with you.

1095
00:55:09,250 --> 00:55:10,860
Right now.

1096
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:15,190
Okay.

1097
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:19,510
What did he say?

1098
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:23,499
He told me to bring you.

1099
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:25,440
To where?

1100
00:55:51,220 --> 00:55:52,610
Father.

1101
00:55:54,070 --> 00:55:56,550
I'm so very sorry.

1102
00:55:59,370 --> 00:56:01,289
Sure, I'll kill you.

1103
00:56:01,290 --> 00:56:03,479
But if it's one-sided,
it's an assault.

1104
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:05,019
I don't want to go to jail.

1105
00:56:05,020 --> 00:56:07,999
So let's duke it
out, fair and square.

1106
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,109
Come here.

1107
00:56:09,110 --> 00:56:11,980
But how could I
do this, Father...

1108
00:56:14,870 --> 00:56:17,820
Please just hit me.

1109
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:21,769
Shouldn't we stop them?

1110
00:56:21,770 --> 00:56:24,269
Why? He deserves a beating.

1111
00:56:24,270 --> 00:56:25,409
Hey.

1112
00:56:25,410 --> 00:56:29,119
I'm not so proud
of myself either,

1113
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:31,319
but I can't hold back right now.

1114
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:33,019
You deserve a beating today.

1115
00:56:33,020 --> 00:56:35,709
Okay, bite down hard.

1116
00:56:35,710 --> 00:56:37,129
Okay, here I go.

1117
00:56:37,130 --> 00:56:39,029
Father, I'm sorry!

1118
00:56:39,030 --> 00:56:41,480
Father, I'm sorry, I'm sorry...

1119
00:56:52,890 --> 00:56:54,470
Are you okay?

1120
00:57:07,770 --> 00:57:08,880
You ducked?

1121
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:12,600
You have the nerve to duck?

1122
00:57:18,770 --> 00:57:19,989
Father.

1123
00:57:19,990 --> 00:57:21,329
What?

1124
00:57:21,330 --> 00:57:23,390
I'll take responsibility.

1125
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:27,319
How?

1126
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:29,779
How will you take
responsibility? Huh?

1127
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:33,380
You knocked up a high school
girl. What will you do now?

1128
00:57:35,250 --> 00:57:37,760
I told the entire the
nation that abortion...

1129
00:57:38,750 --> 00:57:39,750
Dang it!

1130
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:52,100
Fine.

1131
00:57:54,750 --> 00:57:56,449
Okay, let's hear it.

1132
00:57:56,450 --> 00:57:58,809
How will you be
taking responsibility?

1133
00:57:58,810 --> 00:57:59,980
Huh?

1134
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:04,899
Just how I'll be
taking responsibility...

1135
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:07,060
I thought it over
on the way here.

1136
00:58:08,070 --> 00:58:10,470
There seems to be only one way.

1137
00:58:14,530 --> 00:58:16,090
We'll have the baby.

1138
00:58:17,110 --> 00:58:18,720
Are you crazy?

1139
00:58:25,370 --> 00:58:26,789
You said...

1140
00:58:26,790 --> 00:58:29,480
that abortions are
immoral, Father.

1141
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:31,719
I...

1142
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:33,209
Look.

1143
00:58:33,210 --> 00:58:35,159
I know I said that but...

1144
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:36,030
Hey.

1145
00:58:36,031 --> 00:58:38,489
She can hardly take
care of herself, yet

1146
00:58:38,490 --> 00:58:39,989
you want her to have a baby?

1147
00:58:39,990 --> 00:58:41,289
That's taking responsibility?

1148
00:58:41,290 --> 00:58:44,739
Ruining her future is
"taking responsibility?"

1149
00:58:44,740 --> 00:58:46,540
But I can't...

1150
00:58:48,220 --> 00:58:51,670
have Da Jung go
through the surgery, either.

1151
00:58:58,170 --> 00:59:00,989
Then you shouldn't
have made this mess.

1152
00:59:00,990 --> 00:59:04,100
If you really love her, respect
her. Why act so rashly?

1153
00:59:05,100 --> 00:59:06,130
I'm...

1154
00:59:07,340 --> 00:59:08,850
truly sorry.

1155
00:59:17,750 --> 00:59:19,350
This isn't right.

1156
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:22,339
We didn't even discuss it.

1157
00:59:22,340 --> 00:59:26,009
Never mind me, you're
about to make your debut!

1158
00:59:26,010 --> 00:59:27,550
A jerk like me...

1159
00:59:29,270 --> 00:59:31,460
doesn't deserve to make a debut.

1160
00:59:52,030 --> 00:59:54,579
Why does she like
such a hapless punk?

1161
00:59:54,580 --> 00:59:57,719
She really has a bad
taste in men, seriously.

1162
00:59:57,720 --> 00:59:59,599
That's enough.

1163
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:02,599
What will you do about Da Jung?

1164
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:04,479
What do you mean, huh?

1165
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:06,290
There is no other way.

1166
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:09,100
She'll get an abortion.

1167
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,419
You spoke of all lives
being valuable on TV,

1168
01:00:13,420 --> 01:00:15,189
but talk is cheap.

1169
01:00:15,190 --> 01:00:17,509
Do you think this
is easy for me?

1170
01:00:17,510 --> 01:00:18,340
Huh?

1171
01:00:18,341 --> 01:00:20,550
It's difficult, it's
so difficult, but...

1172
01:00:21,790 --> 01:00:23,530
There's no other choice.

1173
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:28,940
What were you thinking...

1174
01:00:30,430 --> 01:00:32,719
when you considered me?

1175
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:35,670
I felt so sorry toward you.

1176
01:00:38,110 --> 01:00:40,950
I wanted to take
responsibility somehow.

1177
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:49,520
That's good enough.

1178
01:00:52,570 --> 01:00:55,260
At least, you
didn't try to avoid it.

1179
01:00:56,450 --> 01:00:58,120
As for the rest...

1180
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:04,260
I'll bear the burden.

1181
01:01:45,700 --> 01:01:47,229
Stay here.

1182
01:01:47,230 --> 01:01:48,599
I'll go with Unni.

1183
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:50,279
What do you mean?

1184
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:51,819
I should go with you.

1185
01:01:51,820 --> 01:01:53,469
Someone might see you.

1186
01:01:53,470 --> 01:01:55,189
That's not the problem here.

1187
01:01:55,190 --> 01:01:57,669
I don't like it. Just stay here.

1188
01:01:57,670 --> 01:01:59,459
You stay here with Sunbae.

1189
01:01:59,460 --> 01:02:01,720
I'll be with her,
so don't worry.

1190
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:11,030
I'll be back.

1191
01:02:26,100 --> 01:02:29,389
Sunbae, don't treat
her like a criminal.

1192
01:02:29,390 --> 01:02:31,559
I don't like this either,

1193
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:33,379
but this isn't only for me.

1194
01:02:33,380 --> 01:02:34,869
But still...

1195
01:02:34,870 --> 01:02:36,179
- Please stop...
- Give it to me.

1196
01:02:36,180 --> 01:02:37,390
I'll wear it.

1197
01:02:40,790 --> 01:02:42,400
I'm sorry.

1198
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:01,720
Let's go.

1199
01:03:18,910 --> 01:03:20,830
Okay, we'll start.

1200
01:03:41,770 --> 01:03:43,140
You punk...

1201
01:03:44,170 --> 01:03:47,770
You didn't even
use any protection.

1202
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:51,650
I know...

1203
01:03:52,690 --> 01:03:55,250
that I'm truly in the wrong...

1204
01:03:56,620 --> 01:03:59,210
But you did the
same thing, Father.

1205
01:04:00,220 --> 01:04:01,220
What?

1206
01:04:03,730 --> 01:04:05,470
Look, I was...

1207
01:04:07,810 --> 01:04:09,230
My case is...

1208
01:04:11,380 --> 01:04:13,540
It's different, okay punk?

1209
01:04:17,610 --> 01:04:18,940
Da Jung.

1210
01:04:26,770 --> 01:04:28,739
Are you feeling okay?

1211
01:04:28,740 --> 01:04:30,390
Yes.

1212
01:04:33,010 --> 01:04:36,600
It ended sooner
than we expected.

1213
01:04:39,530 --> 01:04:41,070
Ahjussi.

1214
01:04:42,550 --> 01:04:45,970
I want some black bean noodles.

1215
01:05:02,350 --> 01:05:05,449
Eat slowly. You'll
upset your stomach.

1216
01:05:05,450 --> 01:05:06,799
He's right.

1217
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:09,130
You should chat with us, too.

1218
01:05:15,410 --> 01:05:17,999
Jung Woo. You
eat, too. Let's eat.

1219
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Yes, sir.

1220
01:05:29,340 --> 01:05:30,780
I didn't get the surgery.

1221
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:38,350
I'll have the baby.

1222
01:05:40,170 --> 01:05:41,720
Our baby...

1223
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:44,400
that's inside of me.

1224
01:06:08,340 --> 01:06:11,520
(The Great Show)

1225
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:14,899
- This is a violation of our contract.
- I'm sorry.

1226
01:06:14,900 --> 01:06:18,099
You made a fuss saying
abortions are immoral.

1227
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:18,900
Is this fun for you?

1228
01:06:18,940 --> 01:06:22,019
From birth to college graduation,
it'll cost 300 million won.

1229
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:24,699
I'll just stay by your side.

1230
01:06:24,700 --> 01:06:26,389
It's an error, an error.

1231
01:06:26,390 --> 01:06:27,979
You guys have some nerve.

1232
01:06:27,980 --> 01:06:30,080
I strengthened my
resolve and my heart.

1233
01:06:30,100 --> 01:06:32,800
Because I'm a mom, I
want to protect my baby.

1234
01:06:32,810 --> 01:06:34,989
If it turns out to be true,
you'll be speechless.

1235
01:06:34,990 --> 01:06:36,859
What show is he putting on now?

1236
01:06:36,860 --> 01:06:37,959
Everyone!

1237
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:39,059
No way...

1238
01:06:39,060 --> 01:06:40,159
Yes, you're right.
