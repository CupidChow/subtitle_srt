Assemblyman Hwang arrive?

360
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:39,730
He thinks he'll arrive
 20 minutes before we go live.

362

then I'll quit. Call him.

371

Okay then.

- Yes, please.

00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:25,590
Yes, you're correct.

702
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:28,910
I'll take your reprimands to heart.

703
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:30,520
Yeah, so...

704
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,780
This designated driving.

705
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:34,810
Isn't this all a show?

706
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:38,070
I became a designated 
driver over a year ago.

707
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:40,080
This isn't some circus show.

708
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:42,700
Why would I put on 
a show for a year?

709
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:45,550
Well, why are you a designated driver?

710
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:48,660
You were even an 
assemblyman and all.

711
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:50,850
After I lost the election,

712
00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:53,330
I had no way to make a living.

713
00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:55,390
Since I used to be an aide,

714
00:40:55,390 --> 00:40:58,320
I had no proper job to go back to.

715
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:01,440
Then this thought struck my mind.

716
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,440
"The closest thing to 
being an assemblyman

717
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,940
is a designated driver."

718
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:09,900
Both take the steering wheel 
on behalf of the citizens,

719
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:13,400
and go in their desired direction
 at their desired speed

720
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:16,180
to drive them safely in comfort.

721
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:41,220
Yes.

722
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:45,560
Yes, here's your key.

723
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,680
Okay, how much do I owe you?

724
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,610
- It'll be 15,000 won.
- Okay.

725
00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:51,010
Here.

726
00:41:51,010 --> 00:41:52,330
20,000 won.

727
00:41:52,330 --> 00:41:54,490
5,000 won is my donation.

728
00:41:54,490 --> 00:41:56,560
Thank you, but it's the 
thought that counts.

729
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,630
Aigoo, come on now.

730
00:41:58,630 --> 00:42:00,950
It's not like a bribe or something.

731
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:02,940
Instead, how about...

732
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:04,620
we take a picture together?

733
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:06,450
- A picture.
- Okay, sure.

734
00:42:06,450 --> 00:42:08,870
- All right, all right, okay.
- Give it to me.

735
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:10,500
Okay, then.

736
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,490
Look over here.

737
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:16,050
One, two...

738
00:42:17,050 --> 00:42:18,950
Geez, what the heck? Whoa!

739
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:45,390
<i>If you become an assemblyman 
with a golden badge on your collar, </i>

740
00:42:45,390 --> 00:42:50,040
<i>you'll experience a new world 
with about 200 special privileges.</i>

741
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:51,000
<i>No way, really?</i>

742
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,640
<i>Business class on international
 business trips is a given.</i>

743
00:42:53,650 --> 00:42:57,250
<i>You get a free pass without inspections 
while entering or exiting the country.</i>

744
00:42:57,250 --> 00:43:00,150
<i>You have access to airport 
VIP rooms and parking facilities.</i>

745
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:01,450
<i>That's not all.</i>

746
00:43:01,490 --> 00:43:04,580
<i>You get an assemblyman's 
office sized 45 pyung,</i>

747
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:06,790
<i>with two executives, two directors, </i>

748
00:43:06,790 --> 00:43:07,910
<i>and three secretaries.</i>

749
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:10,350
<i>You're allowed maximum nine aides. </i>

750
00:43:10,350 --> 00:43:13,190
<i>Their combined salaries 
of 360 million won,</i>

751
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:16,180
<i>and the assemblyman's annual 
salary of 137,960,000 won</i>

752
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:17,930
<i>is guaranteed for four years</i>

753
00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:21,680
<i>even though he may not initiate
 any legislation whatsoever.</i>

754
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,330
<i>With the taxpayer's money.</i>

755
00:43:26,130 --> 00:43:27,330
<i>During my assemblyman days, </i>

756
00:43:27,330 --> 00:43:30,370
<i>I thought those privileges
 were overboard.</i>

757
00:43:30,370 --> 00:43:32,510
<i>But theses days...</i>

758
00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:34,770
<i>I terribly miss those days.</i>

759
00:43:39,030 --> 00:43:41,060
- Please enjoy.
- Thank you.

760
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:45,450
He barfed on your clothes...

761
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,080
No wonder you stink.

762
00:43:53,610 --> 00:43:55,600
In any case, man...

763
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:58,660
Your former assemblyman 
suffered such a mishap.

764
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:00,180
Don't you feel anything?

765
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:01,560
Feel anything?

766
00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:05,750
This does cross my mind.

767
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:08,550
"I was right after all.

768
00:44:08,550 --> 00:44:11,050
If you'd quit designated 
driver per my advice,

769
00:44:11,050 --> 00:44:13,060
this wouldn't have happened to you."

770
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:14,850
Good for you.

771
00:44:14,850 --> 00:44:17,030
Yeah, you're the s***.

772
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:20,180
Geez...

773
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:24,460
I must do whatever to 
make a living, huh?

774
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:27,560
Regardless, I have no 
money but a lot of debt.

775
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:31,230
Anyway, you should quit 
being a designated driver.

776
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:32,820
You have more cons than pros.

777
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:35,150
Everyone thinks it's all a show.

778
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:37,590
They're right.

779
00:44:37,590 --> 00:44:40,150
It's all a show. It's a show, yes.

780
00:44:40,150 --> 00:44:41,880
Even my Party kicked me out.

781
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:44,810
I must put on a show
 to be remembered.

782
00:44:46,370 --> 00:44:49,080
You worry about useless things.

783
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:50,710
Assemblyman Wie,

784
00:44:50,710 --> 00:44:54,150
your "sinner" image is so strong
 and will never be forgotten.

785
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:56,980
As a matter of fact, 
you should think about...

786
00:44:56,980 --> 00:44:59,250
how you can be forgotten.

787
00:45:02,030 --> 00:45:03,070
Hey.

788
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:06,310
Give it to me straight.

789
00:45:06,310 --> 00:45:08,610
You hate me, huh? 
You despise me, right?

790
00:45:08,610 --> 00:45:10,430
Yup, that's why you screw with me.

791
00:45:10,430 --> 00:45:12,410
To tell you straight out...

792
00:45:16,970 --> 00:45:19,330
I'm worried about you, that's why.

793
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:23,840
After the election, you were even 
on panic disorder meds.

794
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:26,490
That's such an old story.

795
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:29,120
I quit the meds over 
a year ago, punk.

796
00:45:33,950 --> 00:45:36,200
Back in your assemblyman days,

797
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:38,790
you were so studly.

798
00:45:38,790 --> 00:45:41,300
You used to be like that,

799
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:44,590
but now a designated driver, 
panic disorder...

800
00:45:47,210 --> 00:45:49,760
And your father, really.

801
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,820
Dying is one thing,

802
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:55,270
but couldn't he have 
waited just one week?

803
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:05,650
Yeah.

804
00:46:05,650 --> 00:46:07,710
I'm going home after 
my team dinner.

805
00:46:07,710 --> 00:46:08,980
Should I stop by the store?

806
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:11,270
<i>Aigoo, it's all right.</i>

807
00:46:11,270 --> 00:46:13,150
<i>You must be tired from work. </i>

808
00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:14,880
<i>Go home and rest.</i>

809
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:17,460
But I'm glad I moved near the store.

810
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:19,740
When the store's busy, 
I can help you out.

811
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:21,140
Aigoo, aigoo...

812
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:25,330
Dad.

813
00:46:25,330 --> 00:46:26,990
Do you play the claw machine, too?

814
00:46:26,990 --> 00:46:27,990
<i>I do sometimes.</i>

815
00:46:28,050 --> 00:46:31,250
<i>Your mom pretends not to, but she 
loves it when I pick a stuffed animal.</i>

816
00:46:31,250 --> 00:46:32,150
Really?

817
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:34,230
I don't know why people play that.

818
00:46:34,230 --> 00:46:35,630
You never win anyway.

819
00:46:35,630 --> 00:46:38,070
It's better to buy a doll 
with that money.

820
00:46:38,070 --> 00:46:40,100
I can do it, I can do it.

821
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:41,880
It's not over till it's over.

822
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:42,910
That's right.

823
00:46:42,910 --> 00:46:44,350
Good position.

824
00:46:44,350 --> 00:46:45,720
Good, right there.

825
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:47,920
Right there, right there, good.

826
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:50,550
Good, good, good! It's up, it's up!

827
00:46:50,550 --> 00:46:52,480
Clench a little hard, no!

828
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:54,220
Gosh, darn it!

829
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:56,300
Why?

830
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:58,460
<i>Why?</i>

831
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:03,060
He was an assemblyman. 
How is he a designated driver?

832
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:04,390
How should I know?

833
00:47:04,390 --> 00:47:06,280
That's why you're grumpy.

834
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:07,510
About what?

835
00:47:07,510 --> 00:47:10,390
You play games as soon 
as you're home. You're grumpy.

836
00:47:10,390 --> 00:47:11,560
I get it.

837
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:14,100
Your first love is in complete ruins.

838
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:15,800
I understand why you're grumpy.

839
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:17,320
No, I'm not.

840
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:20,630
Our ratings are excellent, 
and I'm in a great mood.

841
00:47:20,630 --> 00:47:23,270
Plus, it's been over 10 years, really.

842
00:47:23,270 --> 00:47:24,850
That's why.

843
00:47:24,850 --> 00:47:28,020
It's been over 10 years, 
and you're still not over it?

844
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:30,000
You're spinning a good tale.

845
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,700
A tale, huh?

846
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:33,920
I'm totally curious about the ending.

847
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:36,080
What's to be curious about?

848
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:39,260
That "ending" was already 
written 14 years ago.

849
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:52,220
Do you guys think I'm done, too?

850
00:47:53,230 --> 00:47:54,280
Huh?

851
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:57,810
No, you punks.

852
00:47:57,810 --> 00:47:59,550
I'm Wie Dae Han.

853
00:48:00,910 --> 00:48:02,730
Just watch.

854
00:48:02,730 --> 00:48:05,540
I'll become a great one.

855
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:20,380
Sleep tight.

856
00:48:21,450 --> 00:48:24,950
Because tomorrow will 
be one dynamic day.

857
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:31,880
- Ma'am, I hear you did it this time.
- Yes.

858
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:33,520
Hyungnim, why aren't you 
playing soccer lately?

859
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,450
We can't play well 
without you, Hyungnim.

860
00:48:35,450 --> 00:48:37,610
Aigoo, you're getting prettier, ma'am.

861
00:48:37,610 --> 00:48:38,980
If you're taking something
 good, please share.

862
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:40,520
- I really got prettier?
- Yes.

863
00:48:46,830 --> 00:48:47,880
Hello.

864
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:49,530
I've never seen you, Grandma.

865
00:48:49,530 --> 00:48:51,000
You must be new around here.

866
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,270
Who cares if I'm new or not.

867
00:48:54,050 --> 00:48:56,950
Grandma, you're so chic. 
The red bean bun must be tasty.

868
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:58,990
Grandma, please give me
 2,000 won's worth.

869
00:48:58,990 --> 00:49:01,420
Aigoo, I won't sell it to you!

870
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:03,110
Pardon?

871
00:49:03,110 --> 00:49:04,670
But why?

872
00:49:04,670 --> 00:49:07,200
You're that assemblyman, right?

873
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,470
You left your dad to die alone.

874
00:49:09,470 --> 00:49:13,030
Aigoo, you're so brazen.

875
00:49:13,030 --> 00:49:14,530
You're a politician

876
00:49:14,530 --> 00:49:17,320
and you go around 
saying hi everywhere.

877
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:20,230
But Grandma, I'm genuinely
 regretful about it.

878
00:49:20,230 --> 00:49:22,980
Out of repentance, 
I'll respect the elders for life.

879
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:25,970
What a crock of bulls***.

880
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,430
I hear you.

881
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:32,940
Hey.

882
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:34,360
Jung Soo Hyun.

883
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:36,440
Jung Soo Hyun, it's you, right?

884
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:37,540
Grandma.

885
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:41,890
This guy used to be annoying 
when he was an assemblyman,

886
00:49:41,890 --> 00:49:44,020
but he did his duty well.

887
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:45,640
He was great in parliamentary politics,

888
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:48,390
and he even received 
an award from our country.

889
00:49:48,390 --> 00:49:50,830
Why would you bring that up?

890
00:49:50,830 --> 00:49:52,600
You're in cohorts, right?

891
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:56,470
Why you f***ers, how dare you
 try something with me?

892
00:49:56,470 --> 00:49:58,370
Goodness!

893
00:49:58,370 --> 00:50:00,260
You better get lost!

894
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:02,090
Why these f***ing a**holes...

895
00:50:02,090 --> 00:50:03,200
No, it's not like that.

896
00:50:06,090 --> 00:50:07,150
Hey.

897
00:50:07,150 --> 00:50:08,860
Hey, Jung Soo Hyun, seriously.

898
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:11,550
How come you look the
 same as 14 years ago?

899
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:13,850
Do you snack on preservatives 
or something? Huh?

900
00:50:13,850 --> 00:50:14,950
I don't look the same.

901
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:16,780
Being a TV writer for 
10 years has aged me.

902
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:18,050
Hey, aged my foot.

903
00:50:18,050 --> 00:50:20,530
Maturity has enhanced your innocence.

904
00:50:20,530 --> 00:50:21,990
It's just perfect.

905
00:50:21,990 --> 00:50:23,680
Innocence and maturity?

906
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:24,820
That's crazy, really.

907
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:26,960
After politics, you BS even more.

908
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:29,770
What? Might as well add sexiness, too.

909
00:50:29,770 --> 00:50:31,830
You're not that type, though.

910
00:50:34,130 --> 00:50:36,520
Anyhow, what brings you here?

911
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:39,100
I moved here pretty recently.

912
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:40,520
What about you, Sunbae?

913
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:42,200
Oh, really?

914
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:44,600
You know I've lived here for 30 years.

915
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:46,920
My election's district was here, too.

916
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:49,080
Hey, I'm so happy to see you.

917
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:50,570
Where did you move to?

918
00:50:50,570 --> 00:50:53,150
This place. The Woo Sung Villa.

919
00:50:54,170 --> 00:50:55,530
What?

920
00:50:55,530 --> 00:50:58,590
190-10 Street, Woo Sung Villa?

921
00:50:58,590 --> 00:51:00,970
Wow, you must know this district well.

922
00:51:00,970 --> 00:51:02,650
How could you know 
the street number?

923
00:51:02,650 --> 00:51:03,910
Hey, how would I not know?

924
00:51:03,910 --> 00:51:06,480
I live right next to Woo Sung Villa.
 For 30 years now.

925
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:07,280
What?

926
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:10,210
Wow, what a coincidence, huh?

927
00:51:10,210 --> 00:51:11,960
Hey, hey, it's not a coincidence.

928
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:13,920
It's a connection, a connection.

929
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:15,770
No, Sunbae.

930
00:51:15,770 --> 00:51:18,370
I realized something for sure today.

931
00:51:18,370 --> 00:51:19,560
What is it?

932
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:23,860
You and me together. 
Nothing good will come out of it.

933
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:26,310
What do you mean?

934
00:51:26,350 --> 00:51:30,050
Just look. We met after 14 years 
and got showered with salt right away.

935
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:32,290
The two of us. It's an 
extremely terrible fate.

936
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:36,090
Wow, you're so straightforward now.

937
00:51:36,090 --> 00:51:38,960
Anyway. Are you still in politics?

938
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:39,890
Huh?

939
00:51:41,010 --> 00:51:42,120
Of course.

940
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:43,270
I have to.

941
00:51:44,910 --> 00:51:46,410
I wish you luck.

942
00:51:46,410 --> 00:51:49,000
I'll cheer you on from afar. 
Very far away.

943
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,220
Geez.

944
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:51,230
Hey, it's been so long...

945
00:51:51,230 --> 00:51:53,730
Ahjussi! Ahjussi, please help me.

946
00:51:53,730 --> 00:51:55,660
What should I do?

947
00:51:55,660 --> 00:51:57,740
Miss, what's the matter?

948
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:01,060
Miss.

949
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:03,490
Please calm down and 
explain yourself.

950
00:52:03,490 --> 00:52:07,690
I... I lost my little brother.

951
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:09,450
- Your little brother?
 - But how?

952
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:11,320
I needed the restroom

953
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:14,790
so I told him to wait 
outside then came out,

954
00:52:14,790 --> 00:52:17,680
- but I didn't see him.
- Aigoo. Oh, my.

955
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:19,480
How long were you in the restroom?

956
00:52:19,550 --> 00:52:21,520
Do you have constipation or...

957
00:52:21,550 --> 00:52:22,350
Oh...

958
00:52:27,330 --> 00:52:30,690
Aigoo, she lost her little brother. 
We have a problem here.

959
00:52:30,690 --> 00:52:31,770
Aigoo...

960
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:36,260
This student lost her little brother.

961
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:38,160
Aigoo, what should we do? Huh?

962
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:40,300
How old is your brother?

963
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:41,770
Eight years old.

964
00:52:41,770 --> 00:52:43,220
Eight years old?

965
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:46,360
Aigoo, he's a youngster too. 
What should we do?

966
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:48,190
Miss, no need to worry.

967
00:52:48,190 --> 00:52:50,400
I'll find your brother, so don't worry.

968
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:52,610
This student knows what's up.

969
00:52:52,610 --> 00:52:54,770
I'm Wie Dae Han, 
a former assemblyman.

970
00:52:54,770 --> 00:52:57,000
Why are you screaming? 
My ears hurt.

971
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,110
Huh?

972
00:52:58,110 --> 00:53:00,950
I'm trying to cheer the girl up.

973
00:53:00,950 --> 00:53:03,410
Regardless, your brother 
may come back here.

974
00:53:03,410 --> 00:53:04,510
Soo Hyun, you stay here.

975
00:53:04,510 --> 00:53:05,950
You come with me to the police.

976
00:53:05,950 --> 00:53:07,200
We should file a report first.

977
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:09,960
Everyone! I'll be back 
after finding her brother.

978
00:53:12,050 --> 00:53:15,050
Yes, I'm Wie Dae Han, 
your 19th assemblyman.

979
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:17,120
Do you have his picture 
on your phone?

980
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:21,190
Miss, let's go. I'll be back.

981
00:53:28,290 --> 00:53:31,440
So, how did you come here
 from Chuncheon?

982
00:53:33,570 --> 00:53:37,450
Our mom raised my brother 
and me by herself.

983
00:53:38,830 --> 00:53:41,090
But two months ago...

984
00:53:41,090 --> 00:53:43,750
Mom passed away 
due to a hit-and-run.

985
00:53:45,770 --> 00:53:47,360
Aigoo...

986
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:49,440
My goodness.

987
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:51,390
As for me...

988
00:53:52,390 --> 00:53:54,360
I have two dads.

989
00:53:56,140 --> 00:53:58,120
You have two dads?

990
00:53:58,120 --> 00:53:59,520
Yes.

991
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:02,220
One is my biological dad,

992
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:06,770
and the other one is who Mom
 married after she had me.

993
00:54:06,770 --> 00:54:09,520
So where is your stepdad right now?

994
00:54:13,510 --> 00:54:15,960
He left home two years ago.

995
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:17,890
We haven't heard from him since.

996
00:54:21,910 --> 00:54:24,790
Then what about your biological dad?

997
00:54:26,310 --> 00:54:27,950
My biological dad...

998
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:32,050
doesn't even know I was born.

999
00:54:34,820 --> 00:54:36,240
Is that right?

1000
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:40,540
But...

1001
00:54:40,540 --> 00:54:44,030
he's the only person 
I can depend on right now.

1002
00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:47,180
Bringing my siblings 
all the way here...

1003
00:54:48,430 --> 00:54:50,450
was to meet my dad.

1004
00:54:50,450 --> 00:54:54,120
Aigoo, you have quite a story.

1005
00:54:55,150 --> 00:54:56,250
But Miss.

1006
00:54:56,250 --> 00:54:58,150
Don't worry so much, okay?

1007
00:54:58,150 --> 00:55:01,450
We'll find your brother, 
and you'll meet your dad soon.

1008
00:55:06,490 --> 00:55:08,380
It's 3451...

1009
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:10,550
5782.

1010
00:55:10,550 --> 00:55:12,490
Okay, noted on the situation.

1011
00:55:12,490 --> 00:55:14,860
We'll go there and 
check the security cams.

1012
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:17,550
Yes, thank you very 
much in advance.

1013
00:55:17,550 --> 00:55:19,860
This poor girl has been through a lot.

1014
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:21,000
Please do...

1015
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,080
Well...

1016
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:25,060
you know who I am, right?

1017
00:55:26,650 --> 00:55:27,450
Yes.

1018
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:30,710
I don't think we've met before.

1019
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:34,760
I guess you're new to this station.

1020
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:38,150
I'm Wie Dae Han, 
a former assemblyman.

1021
00:55:38,150 --> 00:55:39,290
I see.

1022
00:55:39,290 --> 00:55:40,530
Okay.

1023
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:45,760
The 19th and the youngest ever...

1024
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:47,270
Sure.

1025
00:55:50,530 --> 00:55:52,490
Have you seen this kid today?

1026
00:55:53,830 --> 00:55:55,850
Ma,am, ma,am! Ma'am, look.

1027
00:55:55,850 --> 00:55:57,880
Have you seen this kid today?

1028
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:05,430
Hello?

1029
00:56:07,210 --> 00:56:08,760
Tae Poong!

1030
00:56:10,650 --> 00:56:12,950
You went back to the motel?

1031
00:56:12,950 --> 00:56:15,570
Okay, good. Stay with 
your older brother.

1032
00:56:15,570 --> 00:56:17,200
Noona will be right there.

1033
00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:18,250
Okay.

1034
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:22,020
Huh?

1035
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:24,560
He couldn't find me, 
so he went back to the motel.

1036
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:26,890
Aigoo, really? Aigoo, what a relief.

1037
00:56:26,890 --> 00:56:28,290
I was so worried.

1038
00:56:28,290 --> 00:56:30,170
Aigoo, he's back.

1039
00:56:30,170 --> 00:56:32,730
Aigoo, sorry to pester 
when you're busy.

1040
00:56:32,750 --> 00:56:35,050
We'll get going then. Let's go.

1041
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:36,260
Oh, excuse me.

1042
00:56:37,150 --> 00:56:40,050
Please don't mention me
 to other people.

1043
00:56:40,050 --> 00:56:42,320
"Don't let my left hand know 
what my right hand is doing."

1044
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:44,830
Yes. Well then, former 
assemblyman Wie Dae Han.

1045
00:56:44,850 --> 00:56:45,950
I'll get going.

1046
00:56:45,950 --> 00:56:47,550
All right, let's go.

1047
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:48,730
Have a good day!

1048
00:56:48,750 --> 00:56:50,050
Wie Dae Han.

1049
00:56:58,250 --> 00:57:00,150
[ Ewa Motel ]

1050
00:57:01,890 --> 00:57:03,570
The kids are all here.

1051
00:57:06,390 --> 00:57:08,900
If I didn't have plans, 
I'd stay with you guys.

1052
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:10,860
I don't feel so good 
sending you off like this.

1053
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:12,160
No, it's okay.

1054
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:13,820
Thank you so much for today.

1055
00:57:13,820 --> 00:57:15,340
No need to thank me.

1056
00:57:15,340 --> 00:57:16,320
Hey.

1057
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:19,230
If you need help, call me any time.

1058
00:57:20,230 --> 00:57:22,010
It'd be wonderful...

1059
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:26,040
if my biological dad was
 as kind as you.

1060
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:27,630
Well, he is your blood.

1061
00:57:27,630 --> 00:57:29,150
Seeing from the looks of you,

1062
00:57:29,150 --> 00:57:31,730
I'm sure your biological 
dad is a nice man.

1063
00:57:33,530 --> 00:57:35,480
- Thank you.
- Sure.

1064
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:36,820
- I'm going.
- Okay.

1065
00:57:44,530 --> 00:57:46,180
Aigoo...

1066
00:57:46,250 --> 00:57:49,650
I feel sorry for her, but her 
dad's in for a shock.

1067
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:54,000
Many get their lives screwed
 up due to their family.

1068
00:58:09,330 --> 00:58:11,900
Noona, I'm hungry.

1069
00:58:13,190 --> 00:58:15,700
Since I put my all into 
putting on a show

1070
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:17,360
I'm starving, too.

1071
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:25,010
Who are you calling 
all of a sudden?

1072
00:58:26,410 --> 00:58:28,420
Someone who'll buy us lunch.

1073
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:37,670
So, to sum this up...

1074
00:58:37,670 --> 00:58:39,800
You, Da Jung,

1075
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:42,650
and Tak have different 
moms and dads.

1076
00:58:42,650 --> 00:58:46,690
And your mom and Tak's dad...

1077
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:49,240
had Tae Poong and Song Yi.

1078
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:50,780
Wow, daebak.

1079
00:58:50,780 --> 00:58:52,380
Everyone gets so confused,

1080
00:58:52,380 --> 00:58:54,220
but you got it in one shot, Unni.

1081
00:58:54,220 --> 00:58:57,210
This means your biological dad 
and your siblings are unrelated.

1082
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:00,820
That goes for me as well.

1083
00:59:00,820 --> 00:59:03,790
My biological dad 
doesn't know I was born.

1084
00:59:04,820 --> 00:59:07,750
Yet you're searching for him?
 To take all of you in?

1085
00:59:13,990 --> 00:59:16,290
You don't think he'll take us in?

1086
00:59:16,290 --> 00:59:17,250
What?

1087
00:59:18,390 --> 00:59:20,880
Aigoo, I'm sure he'll take you in.

1088
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:22,280
He's your real dad.

1089
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:24,420
I'm sure a dad won't ignore
 his daughter.

1090
00:59:24,420 --> 00:59:25,550
Right, right?

1091
00:59:25,550 --> 00:59:26,880
I think so as well.

1092
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:29,620
You know the saying, 
"Blood is thicker than water."

1093
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:32,550
What's your biological dad like?

1094
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:36,060
Luckily, he's single and...

1095
00:59:36,060 --> 00:59:39,920
he was fired from his job, so he's 
working as a designated driver.

1096
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:42,470
I guess he's not that well off.

1097
00:59:42,470 --> 00:59:45,600
Ahjumma, can I have 
one more hamburger?

1098
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:46,900
Ahjumma...

1099
00:59:48,030 --> 00:59:49,180
Sure.

1100
00:59:49,180 --> 00:59:50,730
Let's eat.

1101
00:59:51,790 --> 00:59:54,170
- Here's the bulgoggi set.
 - Thank you.

1102
00:59:54,170 --> 00:59:55,100
Enjoy your meal.

1103
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:56,530
Can I take your order?

1104
01:00:03,450 --> 01:00:05,070
What if...

1105
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:08,840
your biological dad can't take you in...

1106
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:10,540
what will you do then?

1107
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:12,450
If that's the case...

1108
01:00:14,580 --> 01:00:16,680
Honestly, I'd be at a loss.

1109
01:00:19,270 --> 01:00:20,730
But...

1110
01:00:20,730 --> 01:00:22,800
I'll think about that when it happens.

1111
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:24,910
Do you know what my motto is?

1112
01:00:24,910 --> 01:00:26,630
What is it?

1113
01:00:26,630 --> 01:00:30,010
"It doesn't pay to worry in advance."

1114
01:00:31,580 --> 01:00:33,220
What?

1115
01:00:33,220 --> 01:00:35,540
Is it too reckless?

1116
01:00:35,540 --> 01:00:37,420
No, it's not reckless.

1117
01:00:37,420 --> 01:00:38,920
Your motto is cool.

1118
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:41,250
Anyway, have a good meeting 
with your dad today.

1119
01:00:41,250 --> 01:00:43,140
Call me if you need help 
with anything.

1120
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:44,190
Okay?

1121
01:00:45,310 --> 01:00:46,960
But you know...

1122
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:49,580
Are you and that ahjussi
 from earlier...

1123
01:00:49,580 --> 01:00:51,880
dating by any chance?

1124
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:53,510
Dating, my foot.

1125
01:00:53,510 --> 01:00:56,010
No, he's my sunbae. 
Sunbae from college.

1126
01:00:56,010 --> 01:00:58,070
- Next customer please.
- Let's go.

1127
01:01:00,460 --> 01:01:02,230
I'm really curious.

1128
01:01:02,230 --> 01:01:05,470
Her biological dad's facial expression 
when he sees all the kids.

1129
01:01:05,550 --> 01:01:07,450
Hey, he'd be speechless.

1130
01:01:07,450 --> 01:01:09,440
What earth-shattering news.

1131
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:11,460
Hey, after listening to you,

1132
01:01:11,460 --> 01:01:14,190
I am curious as to how he'll react.

1133
01:01:14,190 --> 01:01:15,560
But you know.

1134
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:18,810
And this is a big "if."

1135
01:01:18,810 --> 01:01:21,030
If you were the biological dad,

1136
01:01:21,030 --> 01:01:23,720
what would you do about the kids?

1137
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:25,470
Hey, are you crazy?

1138
01:01:25,470 --> 01:01:26,650
You know me.

1139
01:01:26,650 --> 01:01:29,840
I can't stand immature 
and unruly things.

1140
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:32,710
During the last campaign, 
when I went to the orphanage

1141
01:01:32,710 --> 01:01:34,510
and played with the kids...

1142
01:01:34,510 --> 01:01:38,080
That was harder on me than
 the three-step pilgrimage.

1143
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:40,470
Aigoo, little kids, seriously.

1144
01:01:40,470 --> 01:01:41,840
Oh, that's right.

1145
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:44,010
Which program are you 
going to later?

1146
01:01:44,010 --> 01:01:46,990
I went to the nearby 
restroom and washed it off.

1147
01:01:46,990 --> 01:01:49,660
- Oh, wow.
- No way.

1148
01:01:49,750 --> 01:01:52,650
The passenger wanted to take 
a picture then threw up on you?

1149
01:01:52,740 --> 01:01:54,620
That happened just last night.

1150
01:01:54,620 --> 01:01:55,900
Wow, really...

1151
01:01:55,900 --> 01:01:58,840
Our real-time comments 
are on fire right now.

1152
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:01,870
"Don't BS. All you spew are lies."

1153
01:02:01,870 --> 01:02:04,170
"Do the three-step pilgrimage, 
and I'll believe you."

1154
01:02:04,170 --> 01:02:05,670
These are some of the comments.

1155
01:02:05,670 --> 01:02:07,800
How will you stay 
in politics at this rate?

1156
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:10,070
They even fired you from the 
district assemblyman seat.

1157
01:02:10,070 --> 01:02:11,510
Oh, well...

1158
01:02:11,510 --> 01:02:14,350
Not that I was fired, but...

1159
01:02:14,350 --> 01:02:16,940
I felt ashamed in front 
of my party, so I quit.

1160
01:02:16,940 --> 01:02:18,890
Geez, who are you trying to fool?

1161
01:02:18,890 --> 01:02:21,560
Looking at your eyes, 
I can tell you were axed.

1162
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:22,460
Yes, yes.

1163
01:02:22,460 --> 01:02:23,570
Geez...

1164
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:28,050
Is it that obvious?

1165
01:02:28,050 --> 01:02:29,100
For sure.

1166
01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:30,340
Your eyes were shaking.

1167
01:02:30,340 --> 01:02:31,360
I see.

1168
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:34,410
If you're no longer the 
district assemblyman,

1169
01:02:34,410 --> 01:02:36,510
it means you have 
no more connections.

1170
01:02:36,510 --> 01:02:38,480
Won't it be tough to earn a 
nomination for the parliament

1171
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:40,000
during the next general election?

1172
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:43,620
Well, as for that...

1173
01:02:43,620 --> 01:02:45,790
I believe we're past the era

1174
01:02:45,790 --> 01:02:48,460
where the party leadership 
determines the nominations.

1175
01:02:48,460 --> 01:02:51,190
What's important is people's hearts.

1176
01:02:51,190 --> 01:02:54,520
Wow, you sure do love the people.

1177
01:02:54,550 --> 01:02:56,650
The people's "hearts" 
are flooding in right now.

1178
01:02:56,650 --> 01:02:58,050
Should we take a look?

1179
01:02:58,070 --> 01:03:00,270
Aigoo, but I can't read them.

1180
01:03:00,270 --> 01:03:02,170
- They're bad.
- You'll get hurt.

1181
01:03:02,170 --> 01:03:03,110
Read them to me.

1182
01:03:03,110 --> 01:03:05,060
I should hear what the 
people are saying.

1183
01:03:05,060 --> 01:03:07,640
Geez, then let's pick the nicest one.

1184
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:09,410
This isn't my opinion,
 it's from the people.

1185
01:03:09,410 --> 01:03:11,880
- From the people hearts.
- Okay, let's hear it from the people.

1186
01:03:12,620 --> 01:03:16,280
"If a "sinner" like you 
becomes an assemblyman,

1187
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:18,930
that'll be the day I emigrate."

1188
01:03:18,930 --> 01:03:23,350
"The fact that I live under 
the same sky with this liar

1189
01:03:23,350 --> 01:03:25,470
is such a shame."

1190
01:03:25,470 --> 01:03:27,950
What should we do? 
Read some more?

1191
01:03:40,330 --> 01:03:42,450
Wow, daebak.

1192
01:03:42,450 --> 01:03:45,220
How can your first love live
 right across the street?

1193
01:03:45,220 --> 01:03:47,780
This isn't an ordinary fate for sure.

1194
01:03:47,780 --> 01:03:49,480
It's destiny, a destiny.

1195
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:51,090
Destiny, my foot.

1196
01:03:51,090 --> 01:03:53,040
I shouldn't have moved here.

1197
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:54,180
Why?

1198
01:04:09,410 --> 01:04:10,770
First love...

1199
01:04:10,770 --> 01:04:14,450
and the stars are the most 
beautiful when they're far away.

1200
01:04:14,450 --> 01:04:16,890
Unni, you're pining away for the stars.

1201
01:04:16,890 --> 01:04:19,060
This is why you're still single.

1202
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:28,550
And why do you look so down today?

1203
01:04:28,550 --> 01:04:30,900
I'm worried about the kids.

1204
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:32,370
The kids?

1205
01:04:32,370 --> 01:04:35,490
Oh, the one with the 
same motto as me?

1206
01:04:35,490 --> 01:04:37,280
Maybe that's why.

1207
01:04:38,430 --> 01:04:40,700
She really reminded me of you.

1208
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:54,030
<i>Politicians and celebrities 
have a lot in common.</i>

1209
01:04:55,080 --> 01:04:57,340
<i>Their images are important,</i>

1210
01:04:57,340 --> 01:04:59,680
<i>and must put on a good show.</i>

1211
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:02,170
<i>To wash away the "sinner" image,</i>

1212
01:05:02,170 --> 01:05:06,350
<i>I need a heartfelt show to
 move the people's hearts.</i>

1213
01:05:13,510 --> 01:05:17,730
<i>A high school girl seeking her
 dad to protect her siblings.</i>

1214
01:05:18,910 --> 01:05:21,060
<i>The high school girl and her siblings.</i>

1215
01:05:21,060 --> 01:05:23,890
<i>And the former assemblyman
 aiding in their quest</i>

1216

<i>Ahjussi!</i>

1220
01:05:49,100 --> 01:05:51,210
<i>I was about to call you anyway.</i>

1221
01:05:51,210 --> 01:05:52,470
You were?

1222
01:05:52,470 --> 01:05:54,670
We must have ESP.

1223
01:05:54,670 --> 01:05:56,710
What happened? 
Did you meet your dad?

1224
01:05:56,710 --> 01:05:57,690
<i>No.</i>

1225
01:05:57,690 --> 01:05:59,830

Aigoo, no need to worry at all.

1228
01:06:05,380 --> 01:06:07,940
When he sees you, 
your dad will be happy.

1229
01:06:08,910 --> 01:06:11,210
<i>- You think?</i><b>- Of course.</b>

1230
01:06:11,210 --> 01:06:13,460
If I were your dad,

1231
01:06:13,460 --> 01:06:15,940
I'd feel like Christmas came early.

1232
01:06:16,950 --> 01:06:20,750
<i>Ahjussi, I feel better
 after listening to you.</i>

1233
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:23,670
<i>But Ahjussi, where are you?</i>

1234
01:06:23,670 --> 01:06:26,110
I finished work and just got home.

1235
01:06:26,110 --> 01:06:28,540
<i>No designated driving today?</i>

1236
01:06:28,540 --> 01:06:30,470
No, I'm resting today...

1237
01:06:31,820 --> 01:06:32,690
Huh?

1238
01:06:34,890 --> 01:06:36,160
Hey.

1239
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:38,600
Did I mention that I was 
a designated driver?

1240
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:40,010
<i>Nope.</i>

1241
01:06:40,010 --> 01:06:42,220
Then how did you know?

1242
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:45,580
Hang on.

1243
01:06:48,660 --> 01:06:50,100
Who is it?

1244
01:06:51,150 --> 01:06:51,930
Hello...

1245
01:06:53,370 --> 01:06:54,430
Huh?

1246
01:06:54,430 --> 01:06:55,760
What the.

1247
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:57,120
Wait...

1248
01:06:59,330 --> 01:07:00,810
What is this?

1249
01:07:00,810 --> 01:07:02,910
<i>I told you already.</i>

1250
01:07:02,910 --> 01:07:05,790
<i>That I'm on my way to meet my dad.</i>

1251
01:07:06,930 --> 01:07:08,200
Huh?

1252
01:07:24,710 --> 01:07:27,340
Do you like your Christmas present?

1253
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:30,350
What?

<i>Can you please explain? 
Why I'm your dad?</i>

1256
01:08:10,220 --> 01:08:11,390
<i>Ongdo.</i>

1259
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:18,550
<i>I'm uncomfortable here. Me!</i>

1260
01:08:18,550 --> 01:08:20,460
<i>Why are you yelling at the child?</i>

1261
01:08:20,460 --> 01:08:22,930
<i>I can't even yell in my own house?</i>

1262
01:08:22,930 --> 01:08:25,420
<i>You're in a stranger's house 
doing whatever you want!</i>
