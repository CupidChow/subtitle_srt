Why would you move into

133

The market retailers talk a lot, too.

134

140
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:59,400

I didn't know you'd

Yeah, I get the picture.

164
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:17,480
So you've decided
on politics, correct?

165
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,480
- I left my law firm as well.
- Pardon?

166
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:24,560
I hesitate a lot before
making a decision,

167
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,650
but I tend to really go
 for it once I do.

168
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:31,420
But why leave such a good firm?

169
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:34,890

Behind your building.

175
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:56,560
It felt so friendly and familiar.

This is a nice place.

177
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,970

178
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:01,620
I feel burdened.

179
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:04,320
If you're burdened by our friendship,
we can be something closer.

181
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,380
Only half. I mean the other half.

182
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:13,520
Nevertheless, let's just be friends.

No, no.

 near the market.

My nephew works at
Woo's Distribution.

198
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:53,830
a shopping mall was decided
for Inju City a while back.

199
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:57,180

 - They were eyeing the former prison site.

From Woo's
Distribution's standpoint,

204
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,760

pursue a shopping mall now.

But why?

294
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,810
Assemblyman Kang's residence
 is in the same district.

295
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,320
It's the same district,

296
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:58,150

from the citizens.

there is another person
who wants the job,

303
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,290

Look, I'm the president of

00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:17,680
Yes, we are.

326
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,860
What does that matter?

327
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,940
Didn't the mayor tell you?

328
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:24,040
A shopping mall may get
built on the prison site.

329
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,780
- It's my first time hearing it.
 - What on earth?

330
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:31,110
We heard Woo's Distribution will
build a shopping mall complex.

00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:34,050
Over there. On the
 former prison site.

If that gets built,

333
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:39,480
our sales will be slashed
 in half in no time.

334
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:42,100

shopping mall from getting built.

337

And?

338
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:53,210
Are you saying Joon Ho will
do a better job than I will?

339
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:54,900
To stop that sort of thing,

340
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:57,490
there will be legal battles involved.

341
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:59,110
From that standpoint,

342
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:02,260
Attorney Kang has the
upper hand, of course.

343
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:07,030
Also, Assemblyman Kang
made a promise to me.

344
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:08,620
<i>We hear rumors of</i>

345
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:12,030

<i>Please put a stop to it,

347
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:15,980
<i>Yes, of course.</i>

<i>I'm your district's assemblyman.</i>

<i>I must protect you all.</i>

<i>- Aigoo, yes.
- Please don't worry.</i>

351
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,290
He said he'll stop it
from getting built.

352
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:29,390
Okay, fine.

353
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:31,240
I understand how you feel.

Yes.

356
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:37,760
Then I'll show you in a week.

357
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,100
What?

 market retailers than Joon Ho.

He wants to be friends,
 then moves in next door.

362
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:09,650
Anyway, I don't like it.

363
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:12,170
He's being true to his feelings.

364
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:14,290
Isn't it a good thing?

365
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:18,010
Unni, you try being true
 to your feelings.

366
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:19,840
What about me?

367
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,120
I'm as honest as it gets.

368
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,850
Dae Han oppa.

369
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:26,100
You still have feelings for him.

370
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:29,120
Isn't that why you're not
 with the attorney?

371
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:40,030
Goodness, gracious.

372
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:43,440
Since you came over to my place,
I thought a disaster happened.

373
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,120
Of course, this is a disaster.

374
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:50,160
The prison site is not even 1km
away from the Inju Market.

375
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,920
If a shopping mall really gets built,

376
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,460
- then the entire area...
- I know, I know.

377
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:57,840
Market retailers will
suffer a huge loss.

378
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:02,020
Hey, do you think I'd just
standby and watch?

379
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:07,620
Yes, Woo's Distribution is

380
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:11,180
in the process of pursuing
a shopping mall in Inju City.

381
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:14,000
But you're right. Not that area.

382
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,850
As you said, it's too
close to Inju Market.

383
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:19,920
That's what I mean.

384
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,540
The adviser position is
not the problem here.

385
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:25,600
This concerns the livelihood
of market retailers.

386
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,450
I'll do whatever it takes to
 stop that, so don't worry.

387
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:30,620
You focus on the adviser election.

388
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:32,910
Also, if you're up against
Kang Joon Ho...

389
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:34,850
It's a preview of the
 general election.

390
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:36,810
I suppose so.

392
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,840
You can't lose your ground here.

393
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,890
You know the election is
a battle of the momentum.

394
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,150
Hey.

395
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:46,610
Inju Market is my home ground.

396
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:49,310
Even if Joon Ho moved
here, he's still a guest.

397
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:52,150
An unwelcome guest. You know?

398
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:55,340
Would the market retailers
share the sentiment?

399
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:57,120

 is a burden.

you were a young politician
with a promising future,

461

00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:09,140
Truthfully, that day...

537
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:13,090
- I was going to...
- Why...

538
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:15,230
bring that up now?

539
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,410
It's been more than 10 years.

540
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:28,440
Regardless of our
feelings back then...

541
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:33,770
It's in the past now.

542
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:45,740
Hey, I think it's rain...

543
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:46,840
It's raining, it's raining.

544
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,570
Hey, come here. This way.

545
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:50,930
Come here, hurry, hurry.

546
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:52,200
Aigoo...

547
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:03,770
You're getting soaked in the rain.

548
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:06,550
We should've bought
 two umbrellas.

549
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:09,070
Aigoo, it's all right.

550
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:11,670
We're almost there.

551
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:18,390
And disregard what I said earlier.

552
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,730
You're right.

553
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:25,460
It's been over 10 years,

554
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:29,690
and we've both changed a lot.

555
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,470
Take it.

556
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:42,090
No, you take it. You bought it.

557
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:43,260
Give it back next time.

558
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:45,830
Hey, Sunbae.

559
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:48,080
Sunbae!

560
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:56,520
♫ <i>I wondered if I had
made a mistake</i> ♫

561
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:04,320
♫ <i>The words that I'm saying to you</i> ♫

562
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,530
Right.

563
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:10,400
To be of support to the weaklings.

564
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:14,130
Let's focus on that.

565
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:21,950
♫ <i>Will tomorrow be a
better day than today</i> ♫

566
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:29,560
♫ <i>Will I be able to smile
tomorrow as I did yesterday</i> ♫

567
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:33,320
♫ <i>The night is full of pain</i> ♫

568
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:37,080
♫ <i>My love, whom I adore</i> ♫

569
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:41,320
♫ <i>I know my love will be suffering</i> ♫

570
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:45,260
You have feelings for
Dae Han oppa.

571
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:50,380
Why do you deny your feelings?

572
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:55,030
Because...

573
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:58,130
I had feelings for Sunbae...

574
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:01,980
♫ <i>I can only say this to you</i> ♫

575
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:03,580
you ended up this way.

576
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,980
<i>Really? It's a date?</i>

577
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:10,100
<i>Well, it's not exactly a date.</i>

578
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:13,240
<i>He said I worked hard on the posters,
so he'll treat me to a movie.</i>

579
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,320
<i>That's a date!</i>

580
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:18,480
♫ <i>The night is full of pain</i> ♫

581
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,480
♫ <i>My love, whom I adore</i> ♫
 If...

582
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,980
I hadn't met Sunbae that day...

583
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:26,280
you wouldn't have...

584
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:30,070
♫ <i>By myself</i> ♫

585
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:35,380
<i>I believe I was elected as
our party's chairman</i>

586
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:37,120
<i>to unify the party,</i>

587
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:40,170
<i>and to rebuild "conservatism." </i>

588
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:42,740
<i>I see this as a command
 from our citizens, </i>

589
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:44,980
<i>and the members of our party.</i>

590
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,690
Hello.

591
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:56,760
Yes.

592
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:59,670
Hey, what brings you by so early?

593
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,180
I want to start my day at the

594
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,620
market with all the retailers,

595
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:07,470
and finish my day here.

596
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:09,830
Really? But why?

597
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:15,260
I want to fully understand
what the retailers go through.

598
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:17,670
- Let's go inside.
- Yes, sir.

599
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,970
Yum. Wow...

600
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:29,450
It's really delicious, sir.

601
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:31,680
May I please have some more?

602
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:34,080
- Of course, you can.
 - Aigoo, thank you.

603
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:37,640
You may not know this,

604
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:40,350
but I used to know your mother.

605
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:43,050
Wow, really?

606
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:44,800
I had no idea.

607
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,610
My dumpling shop has
 been here for 17 years.

608
00:32:47,610 --> 00:32:49,130
About 10 years ago,

609
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:52,280
I was swindled and had a hard time.

610
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,590
Oh, I see.

611
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:57,590
But your mother lent
me some money,

612
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:59,840
and gave me free food
at her restaurant.

613
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,070
I was very grateful to her.

614
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:05,130
Because of your mother,

615
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:07,390
I'll support you as our adviser.

616
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:09,050
Give it your best shot.

617
00:33:09,050 --> 00:33:10,300
Thank you, sir.

618
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,960
I'll give it my all.

619
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,660
Thank you.

620
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:14,940
<i>Guys.</i>

621
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:17,080
For this week's
 "People's Assembly Hall,"

622
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,680
what about reviving the
traditional markets?

623
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,270
What about the original topic?

624
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:22,580
Another show
discussed it yesterday.

625
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:24,910
We can't be serving flat sodas.

626
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:27,820
Revitalizing traditional markets
is also an old topic.

627
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:29,520
The bills exist already.

628
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:32,850
Yes, but there are too
many loopholes.

629
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:34,430
Even in our town,

630
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:37,510
they're building a shopping
mall right near the market.

631
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:39,230
Oh, yeah.

632
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:42,620
Unni, your parents have a chicken
 restaurant in the market.

633
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:44,920
They must be worried.

634
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:47,590
But I don't agree that
traditional markets are good,

635
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:51,020
and shopping malls are
 evil in this scenario.

636
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:52,740
Me neither.

637
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:56,470
I don't go to the traditional market
when the supermarket is closed.

638
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:58,070
You're right.

639
00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:00,440
You guys have a good point.

640
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,240
So let's have a "dispute."

641
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:06,260
I'm Kang Joon Ho,
your adviser candidate.

642
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:10,820
Hello. I'm Kang Joon Ho,
 your adviser candidate.

643
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:13,680
Hello!

644
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,510
Yes, Ms. Jung.

645
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:20,590
That's great.

646
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:22,350
It's my area of interest these days.

647
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:25,370
Then this week's topic will
 be traditional markets.

648
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:26,570
<i>But this topic...</i>

649
00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:28,610
Was it Dae Han's idea?

650
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:30,600
No, why?

651
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:33,060
He's a candidate for
Inju Market's adviser.

652
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:34,540
Both Dae Han and I.

653
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:37,050
Goodness, I had no idea.

654
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:39,690
Perhaps we should
change the topic then.

655
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:40,700
Why?

656
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:44,750
Our show may affect the
 results of your election.

657
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:47,590
I think it's actually better that way.

658
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:50,530
The market retailers can
watch us debate,

659
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:53,020
and it'll aid in their
rational decision making.

660
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:55,640
Isn't that the purpose of our show?

661
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,110
Yes, it is, but...

662
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,150
Now that you're running
 in the election,

663
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:01,920
you must know that
every word you say

664
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,390
on-air can come back
to haunt you, right?

665
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:06,030
I know it too well.

666
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:08,360
And it still doesn't matter?

667
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:11,360
Are you too easy-going or
full of confidence?

668
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:14,580
- The latter seems cooler.
- Aigoo.

669
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:16,280
Thank you for your support.

670
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,980
- Yes, yes.
- Have a good one.

671
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:23,930
I'll prepare for our
broadcast on that topic.

672
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:25,620
Okay.

673
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:37,390
A law firm attorney shouldn't be
 lollygagging around on a weekday.

674
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:40,990
I left the law firm recently.

675
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:43,160
If I have something to fall back on,

676
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:45,330
I wouldn't be giving this my all.

677
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:46,780
I see.

678
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:48,310
Is that right?

679
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:51,100
You should have that much
 gusto to be in politics.

680
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:53,000
But gusto alone doesn't cut it.

681
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,320
I'm sure.

682
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:58,150
That's why I want to learn
everything step-by-step.

683
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:59,320
Aigoo...

684
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,900
Learning should be done at school.

685
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,880
A market place isn't for learning.

686
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:06,030
It's a fierce ground for everyday lives.

687
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:09,610
Don't let your awkward gusto cause
 harm to the market retailers.

688
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:10,900
Give up the adviser election.

689
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:14,040
Thanks for the advice,
but I won't be giving up.

690
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,860
I think I told you already.

691
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:17,970
That I'll be giving it my all.

692
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:21,490
You sure have a way with words.

693
00:36:21,490 --> 00:36:25,400
But that's not in line with
your father's political style, no?

694
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,170
I didn't want to hear that.

695
00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:30,170
So I'll be running as an independent,
not as a DN Party nominee.

696
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:32,130
This week's topic is

697
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:34,400
revitalizing the traditional markets.

698
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:38,290
I look forward to
a heated discussion.

699
00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:39,960
I'm off.

700
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:44,390
Hello.

701
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:45,540
Yes.

702
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:48,380
I'm Kang Joon Ho,
your adviser candidate.

703
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,940
Okay, today is the 16th.

704
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:56,150
So number 16.

705
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,620
Oh, it's Da Jung. Never mind, sit.

706
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:05,010
No, I'm okay, sir.

707
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:07,590
It's all right, sit.
You must be exhausted.

708
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:09,660
<i>- Whatever.
- So stupid.</i>

709
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:12,400
Let's have number 26 solve it.

710
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,000
Who's number 26?

711
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,560
- It's you.
- S***...

712
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,280
So annoying.

Yes, I'm fine.

About what?

730

Joon Ho running as an independent.

731
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:30,630
Don't you think it's all a show?

732
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:32,560
A show?

733
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,100

even if that's what he wants,

wouldn't stand for it.

You want us to move out?

Last time, you said
we'll renew our contract!

How many times must I tell you?

- Assemblyman, no, no, please don't.

Man, I should go to the hospital.

Yes, let's do that.

00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:01,740
Let's see whose side
the law favors. Yes.

797
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:04,020
I understand the situation,

798
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:06,390
but you shouldn't use your fist.

799
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:08,570
You were even an assemblyman.

800
00:41:08,570 --> 00:41:11,780
Well, this is why I stepped forward.

801
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:14,230
Just because this young
punk has some money,

802
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:16,590
he power-trips and wields
violence against an elder.

803
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:18,950
Should I standby and watch?
 I'm a former assemblyman!

804
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:20,360
Well,

805
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:22,000
if you use your fists,

806
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,460
he won't be evicted from his store?

807
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:26,860
You know...

808
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:31,130
I planned on waiting until
he found a new space.

809
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:34,000
But he had someone beat me up.

810
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,710
Vacate the store right
on the contract ending date.

811
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:40,730
How dare you speak rudely to him...

812
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:42,340
- Aigoo...
- What are you doing?

813
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:44,580
You're at the police station!
 Sit down!

814
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:46,080
- Let him go.
- I said, sit!

815
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:47,710
- Let go.
- Aigoo, seriously.

816
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:53,480
Regardless, since you
did assault the victim,

817
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,280
you'll be booked
 on assault charges.

818
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,780
It wasn't one-sided.

819
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:00,420
Sir, are you all right?

820
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:02,460
Hey, what happened?

821
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:04,070
Shoving is an assault, too.

822
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:06,680
- They should both be charged.
 - And who are you?

Your wife told me

825
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:27,880
that you signed a dual contract?

826
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:30,570
That's what the landlord
 had wanted.

827
00:42:30,570 --> 00:42:33,600
The contract states
300,000 won as the rent,

828
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:37,480
but I deposited an additional 1 million won
 every month to a different account.

829
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,980
That's tax evasion, and it's illegal.

830
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:41,880
If it's been over 10 years,

831
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:43,850
unpaid tax amount would be sizable.

832
00:42:43,850 --> 00:42:48,150
Then couldn't we use that
as leverage to negotiate?

833
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:50,670
That would be against the law, but...

834
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:54,010
That punk broke the law, not the VP.

835
00:42:55,410 --> 00:42:57,130
Under the circumstances,

836
00:42:57,130 --> 00:42:59,270
that would be the only way.

837
00:42:59,270 --> 00:43:01,470
The lease is over 10 years old,

838
00:43:01,470 --> 00:43:04,260
and you're not protected
by the contractual laws.

839
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:05,780
Regardless,

840
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:09,310
thank you very much for
 your heartfelt concern.

No.

847
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:28,290
The fact that someone else is angry
 for me is quite reassuring.

848
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:32,680
Thank you very much.

This is nothing. It's not
like you to be so down.

Pardon?

854
00:43:54,430 --> 00:43:56,320
Is that a good thing?

855
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:57,880
What do you mean?

856
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:00,080
Yes, it's a good thing. It's not?

857
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,980
Kang Kyung Hoon was a simple foe.

858
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:09,240
No matter what I pulled off,

859
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:11,690
he was such a scumbag...

860
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:14,370
I knew I was better than him.

861
00:44:14,370 --> 00:44:15,510
And?

862
00:44:16,890 --> 00:44:19,570
But Joon Ho is not like that.

863
00:44:19,570 --> 00:44:21,840
He's such a gentleman.

864
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:27,200
Yes, it'd be good for me to
beat him in the election...

865
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:31,620
but is it a good thing
for the citizens?

866
00:44:38,990 --> 00:44:40,740
Kang Joon Ho...

867
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:44,410
I don't know what he's like,
and I'm not interested.

868
00:44:44,410 --> 00:44:48,680
But I see Kang Joon Ho
 and Kang Kyung Hoon...

869
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:51,200
being one and the same.

870
00:44:52,370 --> 00:44:54,830
How would you know that, punk?

871
00:44:54,830 --> 00:44:57,080
Blood is thicker than water.

872
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:00,280
Look at today's incident.

873
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:03,070
The VP getting evicted
from his shop...

874
00:45:03,070 --> 00:45:04,510
Isn't it strange?

875
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:08,830
Are you thinking...

876
00:45:08,830 --> 00:45:11,640
that Kang Kyung Hoon is
 behind this?

877
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:14,080
He even staged his own attack.

878
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:15,930
This is a piece of cake.

879
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:18,680
But why would he?

880
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:20,200
Why do you think?

881
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:21,890
To promote his son,

882
00:45:21,890 --> 00:45:23,920
and to destroy you.

883
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,420
<i>Do you know Assemblyman
 Kang Kyung Hoon?</i>

884
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:28,780
<i>Did he order you to throw us out?</i>

00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:31,340
<i>Anyhow, vacate the store
by the end of the month.</i>

886
00:45:33,870 --> 00:45:35,300
Good work.

887
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:36,390
Bye.

00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:42,390
We'll release the
assault video tonight.

889
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:47,760
But was inciting the
landlord necessary?

890
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:52,540
Thanks to that, Joon Ho is seen
as a capable politician over there,

A lion isn't the king of the jungle

893

894
00:46:01,210 --> 00:46:05,110
He doesn't let up on
a small prey until the very end.

895
00:46:05,110 --> 00:46:06,850
That's why he's the king.

896
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:12,290

897
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:17,120

happen at school?

898
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:20,110
No.

I...

901

902
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:30,300
Why all of a sudden?

903
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:33,420
I think I was too greedy.

904
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:35,980
I get more tired than I thought,

905
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:37,800
and I'm an aspiring webtoon artist.

906
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:40,480
It won't require school courses.

907
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:43,100
I'll get ready for my delivery,

908
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:44,700
and prep for contest submissions.

909
00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:48,230

941

This is a felony.

947
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:39,710
They'll only take disciplinary action.

948

949

I'm sincerely sorry.

998
00:51:22,990 --> 00:51:24,950
If you feel that way,

999
00:51:24,950 --> 00:51:27,660
you should quit school now.

1000
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:30,580
I have given that some thought,

1001
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:33,690

said this to me.

Da Jung.

Do you know what the most
misused phrases are?

1004
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,370
What is it?

1005
00:51:40,370 --> 00:51:42,950
"It's different" versus "It's wrong."

1006
00:51:42,950 --> 00:51:47,100
So many people say, "It's wrong" when
they should say, "It's different."

1007
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:51,180
A high school girl getting pregnant...

1008
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:53,760
It's not to be encouraged or anything,

1009
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:56,090
but it's not "wrong."

1010
00:51:56,090 --> 00:51:57,760
It's just "different."

1011
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:01,860
But people get upset
 over differences,

1012
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:03,780
and they get critical.

1013
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:05,310
You're right.

1014
00:52:05,310 --> 00:52:07,010
I think so, too.

1015
00:52:07,010 --> 00:52:09,410
When you suffer such attacks,

1016
00:52:09,410 --> 00:52:12,090
you question if you're in the wrong

1017
00:52:12,090 --> 00:52:15,400
and wonder if you'll be
completely alienated.

1018

1020
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:25,020
No need to be scared.

1021
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:27,990
You're not "wrong" just "different."

1022
00:52:27,990 --> 00:52:31,500
Yes, I'm different from other girls,

1023
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:33,760
but I'm not in the wrong.

1024
00:52:37,350 --> 00:52:39,970
Since I'm different from you,

1025
00:52:39,970 --> 00:52:42,540

did you prep a lot?

1068
00:55:31,660 --> 00:55:33,620
So-so.

1069
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:35,980
- And you?
- Huh?

1070
00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:38,680
Not much to prep.

1071
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:42,620
I drafted a bill on traditional market
revitalization when I was an assemblyman.

1072
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:44,940
You know it's my area of interest.

1073
00:55:46,330 --> 00:55:48,210
I should be on my toes.

1074
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:55,800
I'm curious about something.

1075
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:58,740
Why do you insist on
 registering independent?

1076
00:55:58,740 --> 00:56:02,770
I've seen too many politicians ruin
 themselves with a bad start.

1077
00:56:02,770 --> 00:56:05,290
If I inherit everything from my father,

1078
00:56:05,290 --> 00:56:07,750
then I'll be indebted to him.

1079
00:56:07,750 --> 00:56:10,280
Kang Joon Ho, you're amazing,

1080
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:14,040
I hope you stay that way,
I really mean it.

1081
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:16,370
It'll mean an easier victory for me.

1082
00:56:19,590 --> 00:56:23,250
Our next segment is a hot topic
 among our viewers.

1083
00:56:23,250 --> 00:56:25,800
"People's Assembly Hall,"

1084
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:27,700
where the viewers get to participate.

1085
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:30,180
[ People's Assembly Hall ]

1086
00:56:32,990 --> 00:56:37,160
Former Assemblyman Wie Dae Han
 has prepared today's bill.

1087
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:39,020
- What is the bill, please?
- Yes.

1088
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:41,070
The motion for today's bill is

1089
00:56:41,070 --> 00:56:43,930
a special law for revitalizing
the traditional markets.

1090
00:56:43,930 --> 00:56:46,350
<i>Of course, there are
 related existing laws.</i>

1091
00:56:46,350 --> 00:56:50,050
<i>However, it's insufficient to
revitalize the traditional markets</i>

1092
00:56:50,050 --> 00:56:51,440
<i>which are already suffering.</i>

1093
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:53,330
<i>That's right!</i>

1094
00:56:53,330 --> 00:56:56,830
Wie Dae Han is the man who'll
revitalize the traditional markets.

1095
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:57,600
<i>- Yup!
- Yes, he is.</i>

1096
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:59,200
Everyone, please be quiet!

1097
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:01,240
It's Attorney Kang's turn to talk.

1098
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:04,220
We should listen to
what he says, too.

1099
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:05,360
Yes! Let's see.

1100
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:06,940
<i>- I don't think anyone...</i><b> - Quiet!</b>

1101
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:10,550
<i>will oppose revitalization of
 the traditional markets.</i>

1102
00:57:10,550 --> 00:57:14,470
What's important are the
ways to go about it.

1103
00:57:14,470 --> 00:57:17,940
If we look at the bill you've prepared,

1104
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:22,380
all it states is that we should
tighten the regulations.

1105
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:28,310
"Regulations" don't sound too good.

1106
00:57:28,310 --> 00:57:30,120
The point I'm getting at

1107
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:33,620
is that we should strongly
protect the local businesses,

1108
00:57:33,620 --> 00:57:35,270
<i>and the traditional markets.</i>

1109
00:57:36,350 --> 00:57:39,770
Being overprotective is not
 the best parenting method.

1110
00:57:39,770 --> 00:57:41,550
These regulations under the title

1111
00:57:41,550 --> 00:57:43,670
of "protection" could actually serve to

1112
00:57:43,670 --> 00:57:48,140
weaken the competitiveness of small
businesses and traditional markets.

1113
00:57:48,140 --> 00:57:49,490
Wait a minute.

1114
00:57:49,490 --> 00:57:53,290
Pitting a preschooler
against an older kid.

1115
00:57:53,290 --> 00:57:54,770
Is that good parenting?

1116
00:57:54,770 --> 00:57:57,230
Then will the child be
more competitive?

1117
00:57:57,230 --> 00:57:58,630
From where I stand,

1118
00:57:58,630 --> 00:58:01,520
the child could even die. Right?

1119
00:58:05,210 --> 00:58:07,060
It's those childish statements

1120
00:58:07,060 --> 00:58:10,060
which stress the incorrectness
of these regulations.

1121
00:58:10,060 --> 00:58:11,960
If the supermarkets are on holiday,

1122
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:14,020
are the traditional markets busier?

1123
00:58:14,020 --> 00:58:14,890
No, they're not.

1124
00:58:14,890 --> 00:58:17,870
<i>Forced holidays are not helpful
 to the local businesses.</i>

1125
00:58:17,870 --> 00:58:19,990
<i>The research indicates this fact.</i>

1126
00:58:19,990 --> 00:58:22,550
Actually, due to the
 reduction of foot traffic,

1127
00:58:22,550 --> 00:58:26,260
research indicates retailers nearby
supermarkets show decreased sales.

1128
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:31,120
I think I understand now.

1129
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:33,930
Why you gave such an interview.

1130
00:58:33,930 --> 00:58:35,560
What do you mean?

1131
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:39,360
This is from your interview with
a magazine from last year.

1132
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:42,350
This is from September of last year.

1133
00:58:42,350 --> 00:58:43,610
I'll read it out loud.

1134
00:58:43,610 --> 00:58:45,220
Everyone, listen carefully.

1135
00:58:45,220 --> 00:58:47,410
"Recent increase in
 large shopping malls

1136
00:58:47,410 --> 00:58:51,350
are killing off the local businesses.
Your thoughts?" That was the question.

1137
00:58:51,350 --> 00:58:52,490
Which you replied,

1138
00:58:52,490 --> 00:58:55,890
<i>"Large shopping malls don't solely
 kill off the local businesses."</i>

1139
00:58:55,890 --> 00:58:56,520
What the?

1140
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:58,220
"Yes, the large shopping malls

1141
00:58:58,220 --> 00:59:01,810
may partially decrease the
 local businesses' sales.

1142
00:59:01,810 --> 00:59:05,380
But it'll raise the employment rates
and revitalize the entire region."

1143
00:59:05,380 --> 00:59:06,700
<i>What the heck?</i>

1144
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:08,040
<i>This is what you said.</i>

1145
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:09,490
What is he talking about?

1146
00:59:09,490 --> 00:59:12,380
Did Attorney Kang say
something like that?

1147
00:59:12,380 --> 00:59:14,500
<i>You gave this interview, correct?</i>

1148
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:15,700
<i>Why?</i>

1149
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:17,270
<i>You don't remember?</i>

1150
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:22,150
<i>Yes, I did say that
during the interview.</i>

1151
00:59:22,150 --> 00:59:24,750
Using the law to prevent
the shopping malls...

1152
00:59:24,750 --> 00:59:27,850
won't protect the traditional
markets nor revitalize the region.

1153
00:59:27,850 --> 00:59:30,660
<i>It won't be beneficial to either sides.</i>

1154
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:32,720
I knew it, I knew it.

1155
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:35,140
Of course, we stop them with
the law. Not with our bodies!

1156
00:59:35,140 --> 00:59:36,460
Not with our fists!

1157
00:59:36,460 --> 00:59:38,410
- Darn it...<b><i>- What the heck is he saying?</i></b>

1158
00:59:38,410 --> 00:59:39,710
To elaborate further,

1159
00:59:39,710 --> 00:59:42,220
Attorney Kang and I reside
in the same district.

1160
00:59:42,220 --> 00:59:46,070
There are rumors of a large
shopping mall getting built

1161
00:59:46,070 --> 00:59:48,390
nearby the traditional market.

1162
00:59:48,390 --> 00:59:49,980
Do you know about this?

1163
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:53,490
Yes, I'm aware of it.

1164
00:59:53,490 --> 00:59:56,110
Yes. Then according
to your interview,

1165
00:59:56,110 --> 00:59:59,700
you won't oppose a large
shopping mall coming in.

1166
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:01,190
You'll be welcoming it.

1167
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:03,650
Your question is missing its mark.

1168
01:00:03,650 --> 01:00:06,650
No. It nails the mark exactly.

1169
01:00:06,650 --> 01:00:09,670
If a multi-purpose shopping
 center gets built,

1170
01:00:09,670 --> 01:00:14,050
all the small businesses and traditional
markets in the vicinity will suffer.

1171
01:00:14,050 --> 01:00:16,640
I'm asking if this
doesn't matter to you.

1172
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:19,650
Local businesses' suffering
isn't a fact, it's hypothetical.

1173
01:00:19,650 --> 01:00:21,250
Was that too difficult to answer?

1174
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:24,650
Is this such a difficult question?

1175
01:00:26,340 --> 01:00:30,740
Whether fact or hypothesis, you must
 simply answer based on your belief.

1176
01:00:30,740 --> 01:00:31,900
I'll ask again.

1177
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:33,770
A large shopping mall should

1178
01:00:33,770 --> 01:00:37,020
get built nearby a traditional
market. Yes or no?

1179
01:00:37,020 --> 01:00:38,760
Give us a clear answer.

1180
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:45,520
My belief is...

1181
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:49,780
that stopping a large shopping
 mall from coming in...

1182
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:53,380
is not beneficial to any party.

1183
01:00:53,380 --> 01:00:55,040
<i>Oh, no.</i>

1184
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:57,980
I knew it, I knew it.

1185
01:00:57,980 --> 01:01:00,480
I know he's a good man,

1186
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:03,080
but he's born with a silver spoon.

1187
01:01:03,130 --> 01:01:07,300
Since he's an attorney, I thought
 he'd be the best candidate.

1188
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:08,370
<i>Fine.</i>

1189
01:01:08,370 --> 01:01:10,660
- Whatever! Turn it off.<b><i>- Don't watch anymore.</i></b>

1190
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:12,780
I'll also state my beliefs.

1191
01:01:12,780 --> 01:01:15,080
To protect the local businesses
and traditional markets,

1192
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:16,850
<i>the shopping malls</i>

1193
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:19,680
<i>should not be in close
proximity to them.</i>

1194
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:21,280
<i>That's all.</i>

1195
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:23,610
He's digging his own grave.

1196
01:01:26,610 --> 01:01:28,440
Voting won't even be necessary.

1197
01:01:29,550 --> 01:01:33,130
But you never know until
you open the ballot box.

1198
01:01:33,130 --> 01:01:36,730
Anyway, you'll be elected
 as our adviser.

1199
01:01:36,730 --> 01:01:38,220
Thanks in advance for your help.

1200
01:01:38,220 --> 01:01:40,450
Yes, sir. Don't worry about a thing.

1201
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:44,180
I'll do my best for the
market retailers!

1202
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:49,140
Hi.

1203
01:01:49,140 --> 01:01:51,190
Today's broadcast was
 one for the books.

1204
01:01:51,190 --> 01:01:53,350
One for the books, oh my.

1205
01:01:53,350 --> 01:01:56,550
I was talking to Soo Hyun's
 dad on the way here.

1206
01:01:56,550 --> 01:01:59,430
I'm a shoo-in for the adviser.

1207
01:01:59,430 --> 01:02:00,740
Of course.

1208
01:02:00,740 --> 01:02:03,230
Kang Joon Ho sided with the
shopping malls during the broadcast.

1209
01:02:03,230 --> 01:02:05,410
They wouldn't elect him
 as the adviser.

1210
01:02:05,410 --> 01:02:06,890
Where is Han Soo hyungnim?

1211
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:08,860
He's here with Chairman Baek.

1212
01:02:08,860 --> 01:02:11,050
And one more person.

1213
01:02:11,050 --> 01:02:12,350
Really?

1214
01:02:12,350 --> 01:02:13,630
I wonder who?

1215
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:19,310
- You saw the broadcast, right?
- Yes, yes.

1216
01:02:19,310 --> 01:02:20,900
- Hello.
- Oh, Assemblyman Wie!

1217
01:02:20,900 --> 01:02:23,300
Come in, come in. Have a seat.

1218
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:25,110
- Hello.
- Assemblyman Wie.

1219
01:02:25,110 --> 01:02:27,230
You were great today.

1220
01:02:27,230 --> 01:02:29,570
As I was listening to you speak,

1221
01:02:29,570 --> 01:02:31,960
my heart was about to burst!

1222
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:33,950
You flatter me.

1223
01:02:33,950 --> 01:02:35,990
It's no flattery.

1224
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:38,680
You came up above
Kang Joon Ho tonight.

1225
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:42,980
Truthfully, Joon Ho is
 not in my league yet.

1226
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:44,350
I almost felt bad today.

1227
01:02:45,340 --> 01:02:48,620
Wow, seriously.
Is this another jab?

1228
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:52,140
- All right. I'll pour you a drink.
- Yes, sir.

1229
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:54,710
Here. Aigoo, great job.

1230
01:02:59,030 --> 01:03:00,980
We've never met before...

1231
01:03:00,980 --> 01:03:02,360
Oh, right.

1232
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:04,180
Say hello.

1233
01:03:04,180 --> 01:03:05,600
You know him, right?

1234
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:07,990
- Assemblyman Wie Dae Han.
- Of course.

1235
01:03:07,990 --> 01:03:11,560
He's well known as
"The Nation's Dad."

1236
01:03:11,560 --> 01:03:13,850
I really enjoyed tonight's broadcast.

1237
01:03:13,850 --> 01:03:15,000
Thank you.

1238
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,790

Director Lee is taking
 great pains for it.

Inju City should have a
multi-purpose shopping center.
