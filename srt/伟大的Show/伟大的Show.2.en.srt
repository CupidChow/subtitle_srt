Well, I was just joking.

Yes, I understand your concern, but...

167

00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,700
Come here.

189
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,050
Hey.

190
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:59,280
Did you meet your dad?

191
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,250
S***.

192
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,300
If you're so worried, just call her.

193
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,440
I don't want to be butting in.

194
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,370
Then get your mind off of it.

195
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:20,970
You're right. He wouldn't kick
 his own daughter out.

196
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:24,050
Ah.

197
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:36,540
The test results will take one day.

198
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,110
You can sleep here tonight.

199
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:41,610
It's a waste of time.

200
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:45,440
My mom wouldn't make 
stuff up like this.

201
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,390
Lies aren't only told 
by the bad people.

202
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:54,790
Ahjussi, what is your blood type?

203
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:01,990
I'm an O.

204
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:03,870
You see, you see?

205
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:05,710
Mom is an O, I'm an O,

206
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:06,780
and you're an O.

207
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,680
You can't deny it.

208
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:11,690
It's not like an RH minus type.

209
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:14,310
There are many type O's in the world.

210
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:19,320
Anyway, my instincts are pretty good,

211
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,540
and it's obvious you're it, Ahjussi.

212
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:25,240
When I first saw you, I felt 
affection and closeness...

213
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:30,210
This is why blood is
 thicker than water.

214
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:32,260
I'm sorry, but...

215
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:34,980
I don't feel those emotions at all.

216
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,330
That's because

217
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:40,130
you're so worn down, 
and your emotions are dried up.

218
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:49,800
Right, so...

219
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,960
You have no other close relatives?

220
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:56,660
I have no contact with my stepdad,

221
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,420
and I have one uncle

222
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:02,090
but he's in dire straits 
so I can't ask him for help.

223
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:04,190
Honestly, I have my pride, too.

224
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:06,920
Why else would I have come to
 you when we've never met?

225
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:11,210
Aigoo, really...

226
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:15,240
It's getting late. You must 
be tired, get some sleep.

227
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:17,680
Okay.

228
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:28,590
Please get some rest.

229
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,480
Daddy.

230
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:51,260
Noona, are we going to live here?

231
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:52,500
Yeah.

232
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,650
If Ahjussi is your dad,

233
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:56,590
is he our dad, too?

234
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,660
I guess you can say that.

235
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:02,250
Then what about our real dad?

236
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:06,840
Well...

237
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:11,250
You'll have two dads.

238
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:13,050
Wow, how nice is that?

239
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:15,950
Most people have one, 
but we have two.

240
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:20,650
But I don't think Ahjussi
 likes us much.

241
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:22,070
No.

242
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:24,810
Ahjussi said you guys are very cute.

243
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:26,820
Liar.

244
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,090
I'm serious.

245
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:31,440
When did you ever see me lie?

246
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,950
Your entire life is a lie.

247
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:35,660
You want to die?

248
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,290
Unni, but...

249
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:43,330
what if Ahjussi kicks us out?

250
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:47,520
Song Yi, you don't know 
what kind of person he is.

251
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,510
<i>Ahjussi is a super great guy.</i>

252
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:51,330
He was even an assemblyman.

253
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:52,720
An assemblyman?

254
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,410
What's that?

255
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:56,180
It's similar to a con-artist.

256
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,700
Man, that little punk...

257
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:02,470
<i>Han Tak, stop being jaded.</i>

258
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:05,950
<i>Unni, then is Ahjussi a con-artist?</i>

259
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:07,610
No.

260
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:10,210
Song Yi, you have
 a class president, right?

261
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:11,250
Yes.

262
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:15,290
A kid who's nice and popular 
gets voted the president, right?

263
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:16,530
Yes.

264
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:20,560
Assemblymen are similar
 to class presidents.

265
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,700
My class president goes 
around hitting everyone.

266
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,010
Assemblymen are like that.

267
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:26,170
They beat up everyone.

268
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:29,670
Seriously.

269
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,170
Like father, like daughter.

270
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,770
But after the test,

271
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:44,360
what if Ahjussi is not your dad?

272
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,340
<i>Even if that's the test results,</i>

273
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:53,280
there's no way Ahjussi
 will kick us out.

274
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:56,730
How would she know 
what I'm thinking?

275
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:57,690
<i>Why not?</i>

276
00:17:57,690 --> 00:17:59,390
<i>I told you.</i>

277
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:01,700
<i>Ahjussi is a super great guy.</i>

278
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:07,600
So stop worrying and 
get some sleep.

279
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,400
Where are you going?

280
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,010
To make money.

281
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:23,130
You said no designated 
driving today.

282
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:24,900
How can I take a break?

283
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:29,400
Guys, Ahjussi is off to work.
 Let's say bye.

284
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,650
<i>Bye, see you later.</i>

285
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:38,890
Okay.

286
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:52,540
If I submit the test myself,

287
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:54,380
people might talk.

288
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:55,730
Do me this favor.

289
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:59,070
Well, submitting this 
test isn't difficult,

290
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:02,500
but what on earth? 
You're not even married.

291
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,290
Shouldn't we hold 
a shamanic ceremony?

292
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:07,710
That costs money. 
I don't have any right now.

293
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:09,380
Right.

294
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,710
But...

295
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:14,100
what will you do if she is 
your biological daughter?

296
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:18,020
What do you mean?

297
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,960
Let's say she is my 
biological daughter.

298
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:23,410
Her siblings are completely 
unrelated to me.

299
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:25,440
Well, that's true.

300
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:28,460
S***.

301
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:33,260
It's hard enough taking 
care of myself.

302
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:36,770
Since she has an uncle, 
I'll talk to him tomorrow.

303
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:55,950
What the hell.

304
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:00,070
Hey, hey, kiddo.

305
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:02,210
Hey, hey, what are you doing? 
Don't jump on the sofa.

306
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:03,280
It's dangerous, come down.

307
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,580
It's not dangerous.

308
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:07,310
Ahjussi, I can do a forward roll.

309
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:12,660
What do you think? I'm good, huh?

310
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,540
You're up.

311
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:21,740
What are you doing?

312
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:24,410
Making bean paste casserole.

313
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:26,560
I'm a good cook like my mom.

314
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:35,570
- No!
- Sorry, sorry, sorry!

315
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:37,290
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

316
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:38,850
Geez...

317
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:42,720
If you're going to poop,
 you should close the door.

318
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,660
If I close the door, it's too 
stuffy, and I can't go.

319
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,660
You shouldn't get startled then.

320
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,650
You're the one pooping with the
 door open, so why get startled?

321
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:51,580
I'm the one who's startled.

322
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:54,090
Please don't say "poop" to a lady.

323
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:55,550
You have no manners.

324
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:00,520
You're the one who barged in, 
and now you want manners.

325
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,830
I'm speechless.

326
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,800
Did I have this game 
on my computer?

327
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,730
I downloaded it.

328
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:22,070
Man, you can't do that there.

329
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:27,990
This is a complete mess.

330
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:40,170
Why aren't you eating?

331
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,220
I have no appetite.

332
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,660
Please have some bean 
paste casserole.

333
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:48,050
Then your appetite will come back.

334
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:09,490
What did you eat yesterday?

335
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:11,170
Ahjussi.

336
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:12,340
What?

337
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:14,510
Do you know how to say

338
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:17,220
"Don't fart" in English?

339
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:19,450
No, I don't.

340
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:21,570
It's "Don't pass gas." 
(Sounds like Donkatsu.)

341
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:27,580
It's hilarious, isn't it?

342
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:30,140
Our Song Yi is a whiz 
at a nonsense quiz.

343
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:33,140
If you live with her, 
she'll crack you up. Yes.

344
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:36,270
I don't know yet if we'll 
live together or not.

345
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:39,410
What do you mean by that?

346
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:42,260
Whether you're really 
my biological daughter,

347
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:45,430
whether we'll live together or 
go back to your old place.

348
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:47,400
Nothing has been decided.

349
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,260
We have nowhere to go back to.

350
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:51,770
What?

351
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:53,560
What are you talking about?

352
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:56,630
Our rent is backed up, so the
 landlord told us to leave.

353
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:01,880
I'll meet with the landlord.

354
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,360
Living here will be 
uncomfortable for everyone.

355
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,650
I'm not uncomfortable at all.

356
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:09,320
I'm uncomfortable here. Me!

357
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:12,310
Why are you yelling at the child?

358
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:14,950
I can't even yell in my own house?

359
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:17,570
You're in a stranger's house 
doing whatever you want!

360
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:19,390
He's a tyrant, a tyrant.

361
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:22,000
Now I know why he lost
 the assemblyman seat.

362
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,610
What?

363
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:27,720
What the heck? Give it back.

364
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:31,190
When talking to an adult, meet 
their eyes and be courteous.

365
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:33,070
Ahjussi, who do you think you are?

366
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:35,600
This is my house. 
My house, my rules.

367
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,300
If you don't like it, get out. 
Understand?

368
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,900
Dad, please understand.

369
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,220
He's going through puberty.

370
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:55,360
You keep saying that 
since yesterday...

371
00:23:57,050 --> 00:23:59,720
Isn't it a bit premature
 to call me "dad"?

372
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,650
Am I Hong Gil Dong or something?

373
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:03,700
That I can't even address
 my own dad?

374
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:09,920
Goodness, and?

375
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,100
So what happened?

376
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,340
Did she meet her dad?

377
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:14,750
I don't know. She hasn't called me.

378
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:18,180
Geez, I'm so curious
 about what will happen.

379
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:21,170
Isn't this perfect for 
"Screening Humanity"?

380
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:22,880
No, it's weak sauce.

381
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,150
Don't you know Nam Bora?

382
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:26,250
She has 13 brothers and sisters.

383
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:28,540
I'm close to the writer of 
"Screening Humanity."

384
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:30,180

385
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:31,700
Geez, don't.

386
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,580
We don't know what 
will happen yet.

387
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:35,790
Her biological dad 
may take them in.

388
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:38,360
I think that possibility is a zero.

389
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,570
Why?

390
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:42,970
One biological child is tough to
 raise in our country, but four?

391
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:45,680
Plus three kids are not 
blood-related to him.

392
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,860
Who would take them in?

393
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,980

395
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,660

397
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:56,660
Don't even go there.

398
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,620
He used to be a detective
 but is total trash.

399
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:00,910
In what ways?

400
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:03,550
He got into casinos and 
blew everything they had.

401
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:05,810
He left home two years ago 
and no one's heard from him.

402
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:08,410
It's better that he's not around.

403
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:13,700
So the only person the 
kids could depend on...

404
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:17,300
is you, correct? You're her uncle.

405
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:20,190
Who, me?

406
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:24,080
Da Jung told me that her 
uncle is a great guy.

If it were up to me,

408
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:28,820
I'd take all of them in.

409

I'm the only living blood 
relative they have.

410
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:33,090
That's what I'm saying.

411
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:36,840
Even if Da Jung ends up 
being my daughter,

412
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,270
I'm not familiar with her.

413
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:41,200
And Da Jung's siblings must 
find me uncomfortable.

414
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,920
But...

415
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:45,280
I owe 60 million won in debt,

419
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:58,440
honestly, I was envious of her.

420

Da Jung's dad,

Yeah, I just met with him.

434

00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:26,680
And I can't tear you and 
your siblings apart, right?

544
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,390
Until...

545
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:32,550
I graduate and start making money...

546
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:36,080
Is that too much?

547
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:42,090
Do you know what pops up 
when you search my name?

548
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:44,500
What?

549
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:46,200
"Sinner."

550
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:50,930
As you did to your father.

551
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:53,340
You'll...

552
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:57,570
discard your daughter, too?

553
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:01,230
You're a quick one.

554
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:08,390
I think I came to the wrong person.

555
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:10,540
My apologies for troubling you.

556
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:19,520
Da Jung.

557
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:20,990
Da Jung.

558
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:24,780
Where are you going
 this late at night?

559
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:35,910
Then let's take my car.

560
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:36,960
I'll drop you off.

561
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,490
Come on, let's go.

562
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:44,330
If you won't take responsibility...

563
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:47,400
then don't mind us anymore.

564
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:58,250
Da Jung!

565
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,360
Soo Hyun.

566
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:06,420
Wait...

567
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:10,510
What's everyone doing over here?

568
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:11,440
Huh?

569
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,620
Well...

570
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:14,020
That's...

571
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:15,570
I mean...

572
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:19,390
We wanted to say bye 
before we went back home.

573
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:22,260
- Yeah, they wanted to say bye.
- Yes.

574
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,500
But why?

575
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,800
Weren't you staying 
at your dad's place?

576
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,430
Oh...

577
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:30,750
His place is too small, 
so we can't stay there.

578
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,820
Where does your dad live?

579
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:35,980
Around here?

580
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:37,510
Let's go together.

581
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:39,270
I'll go myself and speak with him.

582
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:41,290
Hey, you're so intrusive.

583
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:42,890
Hey, Jung Soo Hyun.

584
00:34:42,890 --> 00:34:45,540
Doing this will make things
 harder on Da Jung.

585
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:46,590
What's wrong with you?

586
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:49,060
Then what are you 
doing here, Sunbae?

587
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:51,480
I was going to take 
the kids home.

588
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,890
I can't send them off alone.

589
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:54,500
What are you doing? Get in the car.

590
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,140
That car's over there, 
what are you doing?

591
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:58,230
Okay, okay, let's go. Come on.

592
00:34:58,230 --> 00:34:58,970
Come here.

593
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:05,990
What are you doing? Hurry up!

594
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:07,300
Hurry, let's go.

595
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,930
All right, come on.

596
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:13,340
Let's get in.

597
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:15,060
Okay, please get in.

598
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:16,300
Here.

599
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:18,970
All right, put on your seat belts.

600
00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:21,010
- Put on your seat belts.
- I'll go with you.

601
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,350
Get out, where are you going?

602
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,890
Man, this is nuts.

603
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:51,400
You said your dad is a great guy.

604
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:56,180
He is a great guy, but

605
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:59,980
he's having some difficulties, 
and the house is too small.

606
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:02,500
My siblings were
 uncomfortable, too.

607
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:06,130
No, I wasn't uncomfortable at all.

608
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:08,140
That place was a s***hole.

609
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:10,540
And the dad was an a**hole, too.

610
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:18,010
I mean, even though your
 dad is having difficulties,

611
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:20,220
how could he ignore you like this?

612
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,320
No.

613
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,620
He looked into an orphanage.

614
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:29,490
Then he did all he could.

615
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:32,230
Rather than living 
with a dad you just met,

616
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:35,130
wouldn't the orphanage 
be a better choice?

617
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:37,020
We're not orphans.

618
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:39,630
We'll just live on our own.

619
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:57,440
Where is it?

620
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,710
Thank you.

621
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:00,160
Please give me the luggage.

622
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:14,950
Well then, get some rest.

623
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:19,400
Hey, we should get going.

624
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:25,710
Tae Poong, Song Yi, 
you must be tired.

625
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:28,130
Let's go inside. Let's go in.

626
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:29,870
Let's go in.

627
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:31,340
Let's go.

628
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:36,910
All right.

629
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:24,430
Noona, I'm hungry. 
Make me ramen.

630
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:26,720
Okay, just a second.

631
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:28,940
Ramen...

632
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:36,120
I'll boil you some eggs.

633
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:48,810
What side dishes do you like?

634
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:50,600
Meat. We like beef.

635
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:54,040
- And Song Yi?
- Egg crepes and sausages.

636
00:38:55,290 --> 00:38:56,500
And Tak?

637
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:58,420
Shark's fin.

638
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,420
Shark's fin.

639
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:05,970
You're butting in too much.

640
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:07,380
Because I'm worried about them.

641
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:08,950
Can't you tell by
 looking at Da Jung?

642
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:09,980
What do you mean?

643
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:12,180
It's obvious. Her dad
 kicked them out.

644
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:14,290
I knew that man would do this.

645
00:39:14,290 --> 00:39:15,390
At age 20,

646
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:18,170
with a girl he just met, 
with no precaution...

647
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:19,620
Aigoo...

648
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:22,110
No way someone like that
 would take them in.

649
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:25,130
Truthfully, if I did it my way,
 I'd totally report him.

650
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:27,630
I mean...

651
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:30,110
This is something worth reporting?

652
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:31,180
Why not?

653
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:33,420
This is clearly child abandonment.

654
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:36,550
The more I think, he's not even 
human. He's a f***ing trash.

655
00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:39,520
Hey, trash...

656
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,320
That's too much.

657
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,080
And f***ing trash is...

658
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,820
Everyone has their situation.

659
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:49,770
Wow, you're taking the 
man's side, huh?

660
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:52,270
No, it's just...

661
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:54,720
Yes, I feel bad for the
 kids' situation,

662
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,900
but think of the biological 
dad's side, too.

663
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:59,210
Da Jung is his blood, 
so he could take her in.

664
00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:00,430
What about the siblings?

665
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:03,980
Those kids and that guy 
are complete strangers.

666
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:05,330
Aigoo...

667
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:10,150
Well, then what would you 
do about the kids, Sunbae?

668
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:12,050
We can't just leave them like that.

669
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:16,300
I know.

670
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:18,350
They should stay at the orphanage.

671
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:21,050
That's the best for 
Da Jung and the kids.

672
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:23,740
That's not the best, 
he's running away.

673
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:30,430
I'm going crazy.

674
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:38,010
Thank you for the side dishes.

675
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:40,540
I know I made it, but I can't
 guarantee it's good.

676
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:42,400
I'm not skilled with my hands.

677
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,590
It was pretty decent.

678
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:49,660
Please get home safely.

679
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:51,820
Sure, okay.

680
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:54,500
Call me if anything comes up.

681
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:57,590
I hope I won't ever have to call you.

682
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:05,890
Call me even if nothing comes up.

683
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:10,430
You got it?

684
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:14,590
Okay.

685
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:16,790
I'll get going.

686
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,080
It's nice to be back home, right?

687
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,090
Yup.

688
00:41:36,090 --> 00:41:39,470
But since I'm home, I miss Mom.

689
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:40,990
Me, too.

690
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:43,390
Me, too.

691
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:53,580
Song Yi.

692
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:55,890
Any other nonsense quiz 
you got up there?

693
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:01,560
What does a king say when he
 doesn't want to go to his palace?

694
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,670
"I won't go!"

695
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:03,600
Wrong.

696
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,960
- "You go then."
- Wrong.

697
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,830
I have no idea.

698
00:42:07,830 --> 00:42:09,370
The correct answer is,

699
00:42:09,370 --> 00:42:11,880
"I hate the palace, I hate the palace." 
(Sounds like "palace," but actually mumbling and complaining)

700
00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:17,260
Wow, it's hilarious.

701
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:19,680
It's so funny I'm tearing up.

702
00:42:24,590 --> 00:42:25,740
Soundproof mode.

703
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:34,070
So...

704
00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:37,020
Ahjussi is not your dad, Unni?

705
00:42:39,610 --> 00:42:40,830
Well...

706
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:43,590
I think Mom was mistaken.

707
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:04,330
What? What are you looking for?

708
00:43:04,330 --> 00:43:05,860
Handkerchief.

709
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:09,070
Mommy's handkerchief disappeared.

710
00:43:09,070 --> 00:43:11,360
Unni, what should I do?

711
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:14,340
I think I left it at Ahjussi's house.

712
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:17,980
Unni, let's go find the handkerchief.

713
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:21,030
Don't cry, Song Yi.

714
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:22,190
It's okay, it's okay.

715
00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:25,230
I'll call Ahjussi and ask 
him to send it back.

716
00:43:25,230 --> 00:43:28,180
Unni, let's go.

717
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:32,610
Thank you.

718
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:33,900
Go in and get some rest.

719
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:35,930
Sunbae.

720
00:43:37,090 --> 00:43:37,870
Yes?

721
00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:40,590
I mean...

722
00:43:41,570 --> 00:43:43,880
about sending the kids 
to an orphanage...

723
00:43:44,870 --> 00:43:47,240

00:54:22,570 --> 00:54:24,430
Why are you guys doing that?

903
00:54:24,430 --> 00:54:27,180
Hey, you should 
educate your siblings.

904
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:30,400
They're so unruly.

905
00:54:34,570 --> 00:54:35,840
Get up.

906
00:54:37,890 --> 00:54:39,800
I said, get up!

907
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:46,230
Says who?

908
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:58,710
I heard you're here for Dad's debt.

909
00:54:59,870 --> 00:55:01,800
If you want your money, talk to me.

910
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:04,330
Start talking. I have ears.

911
00:55:04,330 --> 00:55:07,200
We haven't heard from 
Dad in two years.

912
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:10,080
We'd like to know where he is, too.

913
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:12,990
Two years. He should be 
missing his kids by now.

914
00:55:12,990 --> 00:55:16,130
It's really hard to sever blood ties.

915
00:55:16,130 --> 00:55:20,120
We'll have to stay here for now, okay?

916
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:22,760
Aigoo... Aigoo, so comfy.

917
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:24,640
Aigoo, this is nice.

918
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:26,980
Aigoo, how relaxing.

919
00:55:26,980 --> 00:55:28,440
Hey, now.

920
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:29,780
Let's take a nap.

921
00:55:31,580 --> 00:55:34,280
<i>- Did you see that? 
 - Yeah, daebak.</i>

922
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:37,350
<i>Attorney Kang Joon Ho, 
who's beautiful inside and out.</i>

923
00:55:37,350 --> 00:55:39,070
<i>I'm always rooting for you.</i>

924
00:55:39,070 --> 00:55:41,770
<i>There's an old saying you 
can tell a lot by one's family.</i>

925
00:55:41,770 --> 00:55:44,380
<i>Out of conservatives, 
Kang Kyung Hoon seems the best.</i>

926
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:47,770
<i>What is Kang Kyung Hoon's former 
opponent Wie Dae Han up to now?</i>

927
00:55:47,770 --> 00:55:50,670
<i>Maybe getting free meals 
from the homeless center?</i>

928
00:55:50,670 --> 00:55:53,540
Why, this punk...

929
00:56:04,150 --> 00:56:06,990
<i>Stop putting on a show and 
focus on parliamentary politics.</i>

930
00:56:06,990 --> 00:56:10,390
<i>Kang Kyung Hoon didn't propose any 
legislation in the National Assembly.</i>

931
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:22,220
I'm getting a call. Who is it?

932
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:35,480
Excuse me.

933
00:56:42,570 --> 00:56:44,160
<i>- Where is my name?
- You're in first place!</i>

934
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:45,680
<i>You're at the top!</i>

935
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:46,750
[ 1: Wie Dae Han
2: Kang Joon Ho ]

936
00:56:46,750 --> 00:56:49,800
<i>- All right!
- You're number one!</i>

937
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:51,870
<i>- You did it!
- This is awesome!</i>

938
00:56:51,870 --> 00:56:53,340
- Of course.
- Yup.

939
00:56:54,830 --> 00:56:56,480
Don't be discouraged.

940
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:00,530
Second place is amazing, too.

941
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:02,710
Wie Dae Han.

942
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:05,270
Hey, Kang Joon Ho.

943
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:08,210
Long time no see.

944
00:57:09,850 --> 00:57:11,340
I know.

945
00:57:11,340 --> 00:57:12,810
How have you been?

946
00:57:12,810 --> 00:57:13,750
Huh?

947
00:57:14,730 --> 00:57:18,230
I'm doing well, just taking 
care of my district.

948
00:57:18,230 --> 00:57:20,570
I guess you're still in politics.

949
00:57:20,570 --> 00:57:24,030
Of course, people are 
watching. How can I not?

950
00:57:24,030 --> 00:57:25,550
You know.

951
00:57:25,550 --> 00:57:28,070
Anyway, tell your father
 to take a break now.

952
00:57:28,070 --> 00:57:30,500
And leave politics to 
young people like me.

953
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:32,510
If the water stands still, it'll go bad.

954
00:57:32,510 --> 00:57:34,500
It's been still for too long.

955
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:37,450
Let's grab a beer 
when you have time.

956
00:57:37,450 --> 00:57:40,300
Well, that sounds good.

957
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:42,500
But I don't know when I'll have time.

958
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:44,220
Many are asking for me.

959
00:57:44,220 --> 00:57:47,230
I came out tonight, too, since 
they were begging me to come out.

960
00:57:47,230 --> 00:57:48,350
Is that right?

961
00:57:48,350 --> 00:57:50,830
Then we'll take our time.

962
00:57:50,830 --> 00:57:52,070
Okay.

963
00:57:52,070 --> 00:57:53,450
I'll see you next time.

964
00:57:53,450 --> 00:57:55,110
- Okay, goodnight.
- All right.

965
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:05,020
Yes, I'm almost there...

966
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:19,490
You're the one who called 
a designated driver?

967
00:58:21,430 --> 00:58:24,540
What a funny situation.

968
00:58:26,010 --> 00:58:29,250
I think you'll be uncomfortable.
 I'll call another driver.

969
00:58:39,930 --> 00:58:41,880
No, it's fine.

970
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:44,430
I don't pick and 
choose my customers.

971
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:46,800
Is this it?

972
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:48,280
Give me your keys.

973
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:50,560
You waited a while, huh?

974
00:58:57,620 --> 00:58:59,420
You know Assemblyman
 Wie Dae Han, right?

975
00:58:59,420 --> 00:59:01,230
We're high school alumni.

976
00:59:01,230 --> 00:59:03,450
Of course, I do.

977
00:59:03,450 --> 00:59:05,430
Assemblyman Wie Dae Han.

978
00:59:05,430 --> 00:59:09,460
But what are you doing here, 
Assemblyman Wie...

979
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:14,210
Give me your keys.

980
00:59:24,670 --> 00:59:25,840
What's this?

981
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:27,750
I called for a designated driver...

982
00:59:27,750 --> 00:59:29,570
and Wie Dae Han showed up.

983
00:59:44,150 --> 00:59:46,710
How do you know Hye Jin...

984
00:59:48,020 --> 00:59:49,620
Oh. We attend the same church.

985
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:52,880
Don't misunderstand. 
She's like a sister to me.

986
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:55,890
Any rumors will scare 
away her suitors.

987
00:59:57,520 --> 00:59:59,210
I'm okay.

988
00:59:59,210 --> 01:00:01,600
If my suitors go away, 
I'll just marry you.

989
01:00:07,970 --> 01:00:10,880
How is designated 
driving? Isn't it rough?

990
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:13,280
It depends on who the customer is.

991
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:15,480
I hear you've done this over a year.

992
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:17,500
You've got guts.

993
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:19,470
My father says that

994
01:00:19,470 --> 01:00:21,380
you need guts for politics.

995
01:00:21,380 --> 01:00:25,290
For the record, Assemblyman Kang is 
the reason I decided to get into politics.

996
01:00:25,290 --> 01:00:26,780
Really?

997
01:00:26,780 --> 01:00:30,020
Do you remember our bet
 in high school for the grades?

998
01:00:31,730 --> 01:00:34,000
Yes. Yes, I do remember.

999
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:38,270
When I placed the top of
 the class, my mom's store...

1000
01:00:38,270 --> 01:00:40,690
almost got kicked out of the market.

1001
01:00:40,690 --> 01:00:42,870
Due to Assemblyman Kang's influence.

1002
01:00:47,420 --> 01:00:50,390
It's polite to let the 
bygones be bygones.

1003
01:00:53,970 --> 01:00:56,260
Since he started it, 
let's see it through.

1004
01:00:56,260 --> 01:00:57,860
And then?

1005
01:00:57,860 --> 01:01:00,610
I went to Assemblyman Kang 
and begged.

1006
01:01:00,610 --> 01:01:05,500
That I won't take your spot, so please 
let my mom's store remain at the market.

1007
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:09,400
I studied mediocre to keep 
my mom's store safe.

1008
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:11,090
But that was more difficult...

1009
01:01:11,090 --> 01:01:13,100
than being the top of the class.

1010
01:01:13,100 --> 01:01:14,730
What does that have...

1011
01:01:14,730 --> 01:01:17,220
anything to do with 
you going into politics?

1012
01:01:17,220 --> 01:01:19,660
I made a decision after that incident.

1013
01:01:19,660 --> 01:01:21,270
That I'll become an assemblyman.

1014
01:01:21,270 --> 01:01:22,470
I'll become an assemblyman

1015
01:01:22,470 --> 01:01:25,360
and chase out all the
 bad assemblymen.

1016
01:01:29,350 --> 01:01:30,960
But then I got kicked out.

1017
01:01:32,250 --> 01:01:34,660
The bad assemblymen 
were quite powerful.

1018
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:38,290
If that's true,

1019
01:01:38,290 --> 01:01:40,950
I'll apologize on my father's behalf.

1020
01:01:40,950 --> 01:01:43,310
No need for an apology.

1021
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:47,500
We should just bury the past.

1022
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:49,270
However,

1023
01:01:49,270 --> 01:01:52,710
isn't it wrong to get into politics 
over a personal vendetta?

1024
01:01:54,150 --> 01:01:56,080
What about the poor citizens?

1025
01:01:58,620 --> 01:02:01,530
Oh, oh, stop, stop, 
the red light! Stop!

1026
01:02:06,220 --> 01:02:08,100
All right.

1027
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:09,930
Man...

1028
01:02:09,930 --> 01:02:11,810
It's not going well.

1029
01:02:11,810 --> 01:02:14,090
All right, godori!

1030
01:02:14,090 --> 01:02:17,210
I'll bring it for now.

1031
01:02:17,210 --> 01:02:19,420
Oh, yeah!

1032
01:02:19,420 --> 01:02:21,040
Great, great!

1033
01:02:22,170 --> 01:02:24,410
I'm shaking them.

1034
01:02:24,410 --> 01:02:25,820
One go!

1035
01:02:25,820 --> 01:02:29,070
Wow, she's a master hwatu player.

1036
01:02:29,070 --> 01:02:30,560
Aren't you scared of us?

1037
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:31,610
Not scared at all.

1038
01:02:31,610 --> 01:02:34,530
You guys coming over makes
 me feel secure, uncles.

1039
01:02:34,530 --> 01:02:36,700
Won't you go now? 
Hurry up and go.

1040
01:02:38,040 --> 01:02:39,320
S***.

1041
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:41,530
Aigoo, not working.

1042
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:44,120
Geez...

1043
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:46,950
Okay.

1044
01:02:46,950 --> 01:02:49,530
Oh, yeah!

1045
01:02:49,530 --> 01:02:53,130
I got gwangbak there!

1046
01:02:53,130 --> 01:02:55,280
Okay, two go!

1047
01:02:57,520 --> 01:02:59,250
Man...

1048
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:09,540
Are they starving or something?

1049
01:03:09,540 --> 01:03:12,800
I told you, two chickens 
won't cut it.

1050
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:14,660
Let's order one more then.

1051
01:03:14,660 --> 01:03:16,720
I'll buy this one.

1052
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:18,920
I want fried.

1053
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:20,810
Okay.

1054
01:03:21,850 --> 01:03:24,920
Hey, Da Jung. I was just 
about to call you.

1055
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:27,360
We ordered two seasoned 
chickens earlier.

1056
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:29,740
<i>Please deliver one fried, too.</i>

1057
01:03:29,740 --> 01:03:31,970
What are you talking about?

1058
01:03:31,970 --> 01:03:33,820
Is something the matter?

1059
01:03:33,820 --> 01:03:37,030
Your orders are backed up, 
and it'll be a while?

1060
01:03:37,030 --> 01:03:38,950
Something's going on.

1061
01:03:40,410 --> 01:03:42,210
I understand. I'll be right there.

1062
01:03:42,210 --> 01:03:44,790
Okay, please come asap.

1063
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:51,600
No one's playing Go-stop? 
I don't see anyone playing. Hurry up.

1064
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:52,920
Let's go.

1065
01:03:55,430 --> 01:03:56,770
Yes, yes.

1066
01:03:56,770 --> 01:03:59,510
It's right after the intersection.

1067
01:03:59,510 --> 01:04:01,570
Yes, yes.

1068
01:04:01,570 --> 01:04:02,960
Okay.

1069
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:04,770
I was nervous because

1070
01:04:04,770 --> 01:04:07,760
you were talking and 
not focusing on driving.

1071
01:04:12,140 --> 01:04:14,360
I have insurance.

1072
01:04:14,360 --> 01:04:16,710
They'll take care of 
the body shop fees.

1073
01:04:16,710 --> 01:04:18,310
It's just a car.

1074
01:04:18,310 --> 01:04:20,270
Thank God, no one was hurt.

1075
01:04:23,220 --> 01:04:25,970
- You called a designated driver?
- Yes, this car.

1076
01:04:28,390 --> 01:04:29,720
Well, then.

1077
01:04:37,390 --> 01:04:39,950
Let me give you a piece 
of advice as a friend.

1078
01:04:39,950 --> 01:04:42,270
Control your rage.

1079
01:04:42,270 --> 01:04:45,010
So you won't have accidents
 in both driving and politics.

1080
01:04:45,010 --> 01:04:46,380
I'll get going.

1081
01:04:46,380 --> 01:04:48,560
Let me ask you one thing.

1082
01:04:51,070 --> 01:04:53,890
I hear you'll be running in the next 
general election in your father's place.

1083
01:04:54,910 --> 01:04:56,050
Is it true?

1084
01:04:56,050 --> 01:04:57,270
I'm thinking it over.

1085
01:04:58,460 --> 01:05:00,590
Then let me give you
 a piece of advice as a friend.

1086
01:05:02,180 --> 01:05:03,740
Don't get into politics.

1087
01:05:05,030 --> 01:05:08,110
It's a tough place for 
timid boys like you.

1088
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:13,040
Perhaps so.

1089
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:15,060
However...

1090
01:05:15,060 --> 01:05:17,560
I know I can do better than you.

1091
01:05:19,140 --> 01:05:20,500
Politics.

1092
01:05:23,550 --> 01:05:24,630
See you later.

1093
01:05:43,470 --> 01:05:44,840
Hey, Soo Hyun.

1094
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:45,900
Sunbae.

1095
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:48,070
I think something's 
happened to Da Jung.

1096
01:05:48,070 --> 01:05:49,340
What?

1097
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:54,480
When is the chicken coming?

1098
01:05:58,380 --> 01:05:59,930
Unni.

1099
01:05:59,930 --> 01:06:03,530
The ahjussis are staying 
here like that?

1100
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:06,970
No, they'll leave soon.

1101
01:06:06,970 --> 01:06:08,930
Stop worrying and go to sleep.

1102
01:06:08,930 --> 01:06:10,230
You too, Tae Poong.

1103
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:14,240
Maybe that noona is not coming?

1104
01:06:17,090 --> 01:06:18,500
No.

1105
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:19,990
She'll come.

1106
01:06:25,580 --> 01:06:27,970
I said, when is the chicken coming?

1107
01:06:30,540 --> 01:06:33,630
I think our order got canceled.
 I'll order it from another place.

1108
01:06:38,710 --> 01:06:40,560
Soo Hyun unni?

1109
01:06:40,560 --> 01:06:42,910
This is a chicken restaurant?

1110
01:06:42,910 --> 01:06:45,340
I guess you don't know.

1111
01:06:45,340 --> 01:06:47,280
It's a hot chicken spot these days.

1112

1113

what should we do?

1123
01:07:30,010 --> 01:07:32,280
We shouldn't have
 left them like that.
