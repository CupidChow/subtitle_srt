00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:20,970
It's not something I should
blab to others about.

180
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,780
Per Sun Mi's belief, Da Jung...

181
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:32,830
is my daughter.

182
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:37,580
Da Jung may have no
blood relations with you,

183
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:40,080
but she's not a stranger, either.

184
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,110
What is it you want to say?

185
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:44,750
Please consider Da Jung

186
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,430
regarding this...

187
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:50,050
and take it to your grave.

188
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:51,470
Please...

189
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,450
I humbly ask of you.

190
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:54,580
Please?

191
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,540
Please, I beg you.

192
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:01,340
I humbly ask of you...

193
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:07,690
Fine, I will.

194
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:11,630
All right. Thank you.

195
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,520
There.

196
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,810
I'll go with them to Chuncheon
and help with the move.

197
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:23,390
You focus on the election
campaign, Father.

198
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,130
Okay.

199
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,800
Tak, your teenage angst
is old news, right?

200
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,470
That is old news.

201
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:33,070
No need to worry about us.
Just win the election.

202
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:35,230
If you lose again, I'll be humiliated.

203
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,220
Right.

204
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:40,540
I'll be elected to save
you humiliation.

205
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:44,950
Aigoo...

206
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:48,790
I'm sorry Ahjussi can't
go with you.

207
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:49,910
It's okay.

208
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:51,930
We're nine years old now.

209
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,160
I have something for you, Ahjussi.

210
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,400
Huh?

211
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,930
What is it?

212
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,850
If you hold this,

213
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:06,840
you'll feel as if I'm always with you.

214
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:17,390
Aigoo, thank you.

215
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:20,260
I'll treasure it always.

216
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:31,690
Unnis, if you guys ever miss me,

217
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:34,540
you can borrow the
handkerchief from Ahjussi.

218
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,010
We will. Thank you.

219
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:41,240
Excuse me for a minute.

220
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,330
You must be upset,
but what can you do?

221
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:10,900
Today's debate...

222
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,610
is important for both
of us, Sunbae.

223
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:17,000
Yes, it's important.

224
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,550
It's the most crucial face-off
during this election.

225
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,460
Sunbae.

226
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,510
Jung Woo will help
with the move today.

227
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:28,890
You focus on prepping
for the debate.

228
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:31,280
They'll all be reared and ready.

229
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:34,420
You're right.

230
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,050
You know already.

231
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:41,080
No one has a way with
words the way I do.

232
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:49,140
<i>Wie Dae Han!</i>

233
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:51,240
<i>Wie Dae Han! Wie Dae Han!</i>

234
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,710
Yes. The People's Party,
"The Nation's Dad."

235
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:56,370
I'm candidate No. 4!

236
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:58,310
And what is my name?

237
00:15:58,310 --> 00:15:59,870
<i>Wie Dae Han!</i>

238
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:01,020
I can't hear you!

239
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,920
<i>Wie Dae Han!</i>

240
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,460
Yes, that's right.

241
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:07,560
My name is Wie Dae Han.

242
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:11,140
But everyone, after
taking in four kids,

243
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:13,140
I'm not the only "great one."
(Sounds like Wie Dae Han)

244
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:15,240
To protect your families,

245
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,730
you swallow your tears
and sweat blood.

246
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:21,170
For this day and age,
you're all great,

247
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,630
honorable...

248
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:25,960
and the true heroes of our nation.

249
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,430
That's you, everyone!

250
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:31,170
<i>Wie Dae Han!</i>

251
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:32,820
<i>Honorable!</i>

252
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,540
<i>And true!</i>

253
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:37,710
<i>Wie Dae Han, the nation's hero!</i>

254
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,410
<i>Wie Dae Han! Wie Dae Han!</i>

255
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:43,820
This is enough for the campaign trail.

256
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,650
Let's go prep for the debate.

257
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:48,890
<i>Wie Dae Han! Wie Dae Han!</i>

258
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:51,120
The one-on-one debate is key.

259
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,940
Don't worry about Ha Beom Soo.

260
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:54,150
Why not?

261
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:57,010
Won't Wie Dae Han be
targeting him anyway?

262
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:59,550
If he beats Ha Beom Soo,
he'll take first place.

263
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:01,110
That's true.

264
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:07,890
Now we must target Wie Dae Han,
a fellow independent candidate.

265
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:12,150
The man next to Wie Dae Han
with the kids yesterday.

266
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,230
I remembered who he is.

267
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:21,780
- Who is it?
- The kids' biological dad.

268
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:24,580
Wasn't the kids' biological dad MIA?

269
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:27,140
Yes, the former Violent
Crimes Unit detective.

270
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:30,020
I saw his photo when I covered
Wie Dae Han previously.

271
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:34,360
The timing of his visit is odd...

272
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,450
It's odd, right?

273
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:37,180
And a good thing for us.

274
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:42,030
We have a point to base
our attack on Wie Dae Han.

275
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,660
Okay.

276
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:46,260
Assemblyman Wie...

277
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:49,700
Who should be your
target from here?

278
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:52,190
Aigoo, why even ask?
Ha Beom Soo, of course.

279
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:53,770
Of course.

280
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:56,690
You're tied for first place
in the approval ratings.

281
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:58,810
Then what about Ha Beom Soo?

282
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:01,220
- I'm sure it'll be me.
- That's right.

283
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:06,630
Then who would
Kang Joon Ho target?

284
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:08,240
Ha Beom Soo.

285
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,290
Joon Ho is an independent, too.
He won't target me.

286
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:12,590
Wrong!

287
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:15,140
Since you'll be targeting

288
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,970
Ha Beom Soo,

289
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:20,900
Kang Joon Ho will focus
his attack on you.

290
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:24,070
- So it'll be a 2:1 battle?
- Nope.

291
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,710
Why not?

292
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:28,490
It'll be a 3:1 battle for you.

293
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:31,290
Kim Hye Jin will target you as well.

294
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:34,000
Why would Kim Hye Jin target me?

295
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:36,830
Kim Hye Jin's current approval
rating is in fourth place.

296
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:38,730
She has no chance
of getting elected.

297
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:42,530
Wouldn't Kang Kyung Hoon unify
her votes with his son's?

298
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:46,230
Kang Joon Ho and
Kim Hye Jin will team up,

299
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:49,950
and intensify their attack to
oust you, Assemblyman Wie.

300
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:52,470
To create a match-up between

301
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:55,030
Ha Beom Soo and Kang Joon Ho.

302
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:04,890
Right on, Ko Bong Joo.

303
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:07,270
You're a clever one at times.

304
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:09,970
I've always been clever.
You just didn't listen to me.

305
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,600
All right, fine then.

306
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:17,440
It'll be 3:1 battle.

307
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,670
I see.

308
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:21,260
3:1 is nothing. Yup.

309
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,830
Hey, Ko Bong Joo.

310
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:25,160
I don't talk about it,

311
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:28,280
but I used to battle 17:1 during
my school days, and I was fine.

312
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:32,390
I'm sure you were one of the 17.

313
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:39,680
Clever. Yup, you're a clever one.

314
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:44,280
Discussing policies during
the debate won't impede

315
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,970
the presidential election.

316
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:49,710
That's what will deliver
a crushing blow.

317
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:55,230
With this, we can completely
oust him from the election.

[ "Dispute" Election Special Debate:
Central Inju City Candidates ]

335
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:13,400
Yes, hello, everyone.

336
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:17,020
Exactly in 13 days, the 21st general
election will commence.

337

<i>This is a special election episode.</i>

338
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,470
<i>Central Inju City candidates
are joining us.</i>

339
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:25,360
<i>We're anticipating a heated
"Dispute" for this debate.</i>

"The Nation's Dad" and
"The Nation's Son."

341
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:29,510
The independent
candidates are on fire.

342
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:31,980
Central Inju City is
being cited by the

343
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:34,040
netizens as "The People's District."

344
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,450
It's the hottest topic
of this general election.

345
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:39,700
The district has close ties
with our show as well.

346
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:42,420
It turns out three out
of the four candidates

347

I don't see anyone as
great as my dad.

355
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:01,450
What the?

356
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:04,490
No longer "Ahjussi."
You call him Dad now.

357
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:10,770
Yes, as many of you know,

358
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:14,080
I served as the Minister
of Land and Transportation.

359
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,650
If you vote for me,

360
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:17,830
during my term,

361
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:21,360
I'll commission a first-ever
metropolitan railway

362
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,590
connecting Inju City
to the capital area.

363
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:25,620
<i>I'll be sure to initiate such project.</i>

364
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:29,300
What's his approval rating?

365
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:32,330
Candidate Ha and Wie Dae Han
are both at 28%.

366
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:33,940
They're tied.

367
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:37,590
I'll commission special subject high
schools and international high schools,

368
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:39,910
and expand the city's library.

369
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:44,100
I'll turn Central Inju City into a
prime location for education.

370
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:49,530
I'll commission television
and film sets to be built

371
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:52,990
and combine all the
infrastructure of our district.

372
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:55,780
I'll transform Central Inju City
into a "media valley"

373
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:59,310
<i>and will create many desirable
jobs for young people.</i>

374
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:02,230
Wie Dae Han's kids?

375
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:04,540
They went down to Chuncheon today.

376
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:06,920
We wouldn't want him
to be lonesome.

377
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:09,030
Let's stir things up, shall we?

378
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:11,200
<i>Of course, per other candidates,</i>

379
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,150
<i>transportation, education,
and employment</i>

380
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:15,310
are all important issues.

381
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:18,900
But after living with
four kids by chance,

382
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:22,700
eating, conversing,
studying, and sleeping.

383
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:25,310
Nothing else tops housing
issues in importance.

384
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:27,560
That's right, you go.

385
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,630
<i>As opposed to glittering promises,</i>

386
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:31,840
<i>I've brought forth just one.</i>

387
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,100
<i>Better housing with
more affordability.</i>

388
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:37,180
<i>This will be my utmost priority, </i>

389
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:39,080
<i>and I'll strive to carry it out. </i>

390
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:43,430
I tell you, that Wie Dae Han...

391
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:45,310
I mean, your dad.

392
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:47,830
He's such a great speaker, isn't he?

393
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:49,040
He sure is.

394
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,820
I'm back!

395
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:51,920
<i>- Good, good.
- Hello.</i>

396
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,080
You did great.

397
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,570
The debate started.

398
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:55,940
- I watched on my way here.<b><i>- It's now...</i></b>

399
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:57,520
<i>time for one-on-one debate.</i>

400
00:23:57,530 --> 00:24:01,430
Father looks great on screen, and
he's great with words. Wow...

401
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:03,130
He's crushing the other candidates.

402
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:05,330
<i>Everyone is given five minutes.
During that time,</i>

403
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:07,190
you may use it up on
one candidate,

404
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:09,290
or spread it among
several candidates.

405
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:10,440
Then first up.

406
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,920
Candidate Ha Beom Soo
will kick things off.

407
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,940
Yes.

408
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:17,360
I have a question for
candidate Wie Dae Han.

409
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:22,750
"Better housing with
more affordability."

410
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:26,990
Is this even a possible feat?

411
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:29,770
I do not understand the
point of your question.

412
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:33,340
I mean, the Republic of Korea is
not a communist nation.

413
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:35,980
How can we supply better housing

414
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:38,950
at lower prices?
That's what I'm saying.

415
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:40,610
Yes.

416
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:43,660
First of all, increasing the
number of rental apartments

417
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:47,120
is one of your Jeonjin Party's
core policies.

418
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,470
Does this mean the Jeonjin Party
is a communist party?

419
00:24:56,290 --> 00:24:59,870
How is that same as what
you're pledging, candidate Wie?

420
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:01,150
You're stating

421
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:05,090
you wish to supply good
housing at lower prices.

422
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,550
Then are you saying

423
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:10,940
the rental apartments don't fall
in the "good housing" category?

424
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:15,610
No, that's not what I'm saying...

425
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:17,780
Of course, it's impossible to
provide an enormous residential

426
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:20,480
and commercial apartments
such as yours so cheaply.

427
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,060
I'm not Superman, you know.

428
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:27,450
Isn't that right?

429
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:30,680
No, that's not what I'm saying here...

430
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,790
Wait a minute.

431
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:35,240
You keep saying,
"that's not what you mean."

432
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:38,030
Either I do not understand well,

433
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:40,030
or your reason for logic is lacking.

434
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:42,060
<i>The viewers will decipher.</i>

435
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:43,000
<i>Yes.</i>

436
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,960
What's wrong with
Ha Beom Soo's team?

437
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,920
They didn't adequately
prep him for the debate!

438
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:53,630
And now, candidate Kang Joon Ho
will select an opponent for debate.

439
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:56,850
I'll also question candidate
Wie Dae Han.

440
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,490
What I want to ask is...

441
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:07,030
The kids' dad taking
them to Chuncheon.

442
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:08,760
That's grounds for an attack?

443
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,920
Hey, why not?

444
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:13,430
He used the kids to revamp himself
into "The Nation's Dad."

445
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:16,850
Now that biological dad is back,
it looks like he's passing off the kids.

446
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:18,660
Except for his bloodline.

447
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:28,690
The housing issue
you're addressing.

448
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:30,750
How much of it is possible?

449
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:35,180
It's a realistic strategy.

450
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:38,510
Actually, when we were
the panel here,

451
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:42,090
we had a dispute
regarding this topic.

452
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:43,750
Yes, I remember.

453
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:47,790
Candidate Kang, you said at the
time that housing voucher

454
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:51,270
system is better than
rental apartments.

455
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:52,590
Yes.

456
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:53,840
Correct.

457
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,880
I still standby that statement.

458
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:56,940
Yes.

459
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:59,310
Due to our dispute that day,

460
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:02,760
my spectrum on reforming housing
issues has become broader.

461
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,380
And if we apply the housing
voucher system

462
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:07,710
to the problems apparent
in rental apartments,

463
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:10,180
then carrying out my
strategy will be more

464
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:12,250
effective and realistic. Yes.

465
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:17,330
And finally, it's candidate
Kim Hye Jin's turn to debate.

466
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:20,110
Please select your
opponent for questioning.

467
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:26,180
<i>Kim Hye Jin will target you as well.</i>

468
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:29,660
Kim Hye Jin will rattle you
by saying the

469
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:32,180
kids were used to
revamp your image.

470
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:37,750
The candidate I want to question...

471
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:42,180
<i>With this, we can completely
oust him from the election.</i>

472
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:49,140
is candidate Ha Beom Soo.

473
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,830
Oh, yes.

474
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:57,340
You went on a business trip to
Singapore last October, correct?

475
00:27:58,580 --> 00:27:59,620
Yes.

476
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:03,800
As you know, Singapore is very
well-developed and managed.

477
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,730
I went to conduct an inspection.

478
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:11,570
Apparently, you inspected
the casinos, too.

479
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:12,950
Pardon?

480
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:17,690
I'm not sure what
you're talking about.

481
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:23,830
I was told you gambled in the
hotel-casino during your Singapore trip.

482
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:27,420
Look, candidate Kim.

483
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:28,730
Your timing is inappropriate.

484
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:31,830
How could you spew
groundless negative statements?

485
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:34,030
They're not groundless.

486
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:37,370
We've obtained information
that during your

487
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:40,820
business trip, you went
to the casino located

488
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:43,760
inside the Marine Hotel.

489
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,870
You still deny it?

490
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:53,010
[ Marine Hotel: Ha Beom Soo ]

491
00:28:57,870 --> 00:29:00,620
Well, this is from last year.

492
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:03,370
My memory didn't recall the details.

493
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:07,590
The casino industry is quite
helpful in attracting the

494
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:09,350
foreign tourists, doesn't it?

495
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:13,080
Therefore, I stopped by
while conducting business.

496
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:16,670
Oh, I see.

497
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:18,400
So...

498
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:22,370
while checking out the place, you gambled
more than 100 million won?

499
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:24,180
While illegally exchanging currency?

500
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,570
Just what is
Kang Kyung Hoon thinking?

501
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:37,450
He's leaving Wie Dae Han alone,

502
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:40,420
and destroying only our candidate!

503
00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:44,530
We twisted Ha Beom Soo's neck...

504
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:49,560
When should we wring
Wie Dae Han's neck?

505
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:52,260
No need to rush, is there?

506
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:55,260
Wie Dae Han must keep his ground...

507
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:58,050
for Attorney Kang to take our hand.

508
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:07,200
Wow, she knocked out
Ha Beom Soo with one blow.

509
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,650
Kim Hye Jin did such
a commendable thing.

510
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:14,140
Perhaps she still has
feelings for you?

511
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:16,870
Mr. Aide.

512
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:20,290
We shouldn't be resting
on our laurels.

513
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:24,100
But we should. You're
a shoo-in for first place.

514
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:29,380
Since they took out
Ha Beom Soo first, don't you get it?

515
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:31,590
Get what?

516
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:33,320
Kang Kyung Hoon...

517
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:37,430
thinks I'm an easier foe
than Ha Beom Soo.

518
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:40,190
I see. You're right.

519
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:43,120
You're without a party,
so he's underestimating you.

520
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,600
I say let's show him what
you're all about. Okay?

521
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,650
Okay!

522
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:54,200
Let's show Kang Kyung Hoon
for underestimating us.

523
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,820
Show him what?

524
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:57,290
Huh?

525
00:30:57,290 --> 00:30:58,650
My stuff.

526
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:00,550
My hot stuff, okay?

527
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,690
So do you even want
to win this election?

528
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:12,150
I must win!

529
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:14,230
Coming in second
won't get me anything.

530
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:18,230
Then why don't you
follow my instructions?

531
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:22,550
I don't want a shameful victory.

532
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:24,970
Your behavior is more shameful.

533
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:27,050
Acting hoity-toity during a war.

534
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:29,440
What if your comrade dies
while you strike a pose?

535
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,680
You don't think I like
being hoity-toity?

536
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:34,560
I'm just protecting you
on the battlefield.

537
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:39,590
Sorry.

538
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:42,260
I left you alone in your shame.

539
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:47,670
Going forward, I'll do
as you say. I mean it!

540
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,100
Thanks to Kim Hye Jin,
Ha Beom Soo is out.

541
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:56,800
But no cause to celebrate.

542
00:31:58,230 --> 00:31:59,810
I know.

543
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:04,010
Wie Dae Han will take
Ha Beom Soo's approval ratings.

544
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:06,710
In our current situation,

545
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:10,150
there is only one way
to beat Wie Dae Han.

546
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:13,140
What is it? What, what?

547
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:15,560
To unify with Kim Hye Jin.

548
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:24,760
I guess I ran a bit late.

549
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,660
No, we just got here, too.

550
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:30,830
You just said that you'll do as I say.

551
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:34,740
Thank you for helping out
candidate Kang.

Wie Dae Han ]

553
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,970
Aigoo, thank you.

554
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:48,190
Really...

555
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:50,160
you're all putting in so much effort.

556
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,030
No.

557
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:52,820
Candidate Wie, you're
working the hardest.

558
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:54,590
It's all good. Fighting till the end!

559

<i>- Fighting!

560
00:32:56,330 --> 00:32:59,530
I won't let your efforts go
to waste. I'll win the election,

561
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,560
and be a good assemblyman!

562
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,220
Wie Dae Han!

563
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:05,520

564

00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:13,890
Yes.

567
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:17,340
He's with candidate Kim right now.

568
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:19,670
What are your thoughts?

569
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:23,400
Do you think Joon Ho will
accept the "unification" card?

570
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:26,170
You running for office.

571
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:29,440
Proposing "unification."

572
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,750
Is this my father's scenario?

573
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,510
Probably about half.

574
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:40,620
And the other half?

575
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:42,490
It was my choice.

576
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:45,800
I wanted to try politics,
so I decided to run.

577
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:48,240
I'm fourth in the approval ratings
with the election two weeks away.

578
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,620
It's obvious I won't be elected.

579
00:33:54,370 --> 00:33:57,550
When we see tomorrow's approval
ratings after tonight's debate,

580
00:33:57,550 --> 00:34:01,390
Wie Dae Han will be even
further ahead of you.

581
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:06,240
It's obvious I'm not the only one...

582
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,750
who won't be elected.

583
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:11,020
Unification doesn't guarantee victory.

584
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:13,160
Some may be disappointed
at our uniting forces

585
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:15,220
and withdraw their support.

586
00:34:16,390 --> 00:34:19,070
Nothing is 100% certain in an election.

587
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:21,290
Unification doesn't guarantee victory,

588
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:23,830
but if we don't, we'll lose
to Wie Dae Han.

589
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:25,360
99%.

590
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,060
I told you about my decision.

591
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:40,190
Now it's your turn to decide.

592
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:45,210

594
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:53,380
So the kids moved in okay?

595
00:34:53,430 --> 00:34:54,930
Of course.

596
00:34:54,930 --> 00:34:58,030
I even wiped the floor
sparkling clean.

597

598
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:05,230
Why eat just that?
Have some chicken.

599
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:07,760
I had chicken while watching
the debate earlier.

600
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,830
I'm full.

601
00:35:09,830 --> 00:35:10,530
Oh, right.

602
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:13,830
Father, your debate tonight
was a total daebak.

603
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:16,430
Anyone who watched tonight

604
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:18,030
would vote for you 100%.

605
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:20,100
Aigoo, you're overreacting.

606
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,860
It's not to that level.

607
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:24,470
- Whoa, so unlike you. Why be humble?
- Huh?

608
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:26,200
Soo Hyun, what did you think?

609
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,540
- Me?
- Yeah.

610
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:30,500
If I had to assess it objectively,

611
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:33,530
you were the best of the bunch.

612
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:34,800
Oh, really?

613
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:39,410
Well, if the lead writer
of the"Dispute" thinks that,

614
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:41,130
it's a total success.

615
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:43,430
It's all thanks to you. Hold on.

616
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:45,360

- Stop.

00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,620

No, I'm asking the wrong question.

notifying the candidate beforehand.

648
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:38,780

sent off to Chuncheon.

00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:10,240
beneath the superficial facts.

661
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,050

I checked, and the text was
indeed from Kang Joon Ho's team.

673

00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:16,130
That's it.

883
00:51:16,220 --> 00:51:17,850
Good. Hey...

884
00:51:17,850 --> 00:51:20,650
no more campaign cars
beginning tomorrow.

885
00:51:20,650 --> 00:51:22,030
Let's just walk.

886
00:51:22,030 --> 00:51:25,190
How can we cover the
district by walking?

887
00:51:25,190 --> 00:51:27,060
Even if we make the rounds
and make some noise,

888
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:30,230
if authenticity isn't conveyed,
it's for nothing.

889
00:51:30,230 --> 00:51:31,210
Oh...

890
00:51:31,210 --> 00:51:33,880
Wow, it's convincing.

891
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:34,890
Okay.

892
00:51:35,630 --> 00:51:37,230
- Let's see it again. 
- Here.

893
00:51:37,230 --> 00:51:38,730
Exactly 1%, correct?

894
00:51:40,370 --> 00:51:43,220
Yes, I'm out on the streets.
I'll meet the retailers.

895
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:45,710
<i>Running a noisy campaign
during the election</i>

896
00:51:45,710 --> 00:51:47,830
<i>is a form of pollution
and disturbance.</i>

897
00:51:47,830 --> 00:51:49,260
- Why, hello.
- Yes, hello.

898
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:51,270
Aigoo, the economy is a hot mess.

899
00:51:51,270 --> 00:51:53,280
Due to the recent inflation,

900
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:54,450
it's beyond bad.

901
00:51:54,450 --> 00:51:55,950
<i>Let's get on our feet,</i>

902
00:51:55,950 --> 00:51:59,240
<i>and listen to ordinary citizens
instead of talking. </i>

903
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:01,090
Give jobs to senior citizens.

904
00:52:01,090 --> 00:52:03,490
Yes, ma'am. I'll do my best.

905
00:52:03,490 --> 00:52:05,950
- Hello, ladies.<b><i>- The limitation imposed by walking</i></b>

906
00:52:05,950 --> 00:52:09,460
<i>will be offset by broadcasting live
on the Wie Dae Han channel.</i>

907
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:10,600
How is raising children?

908
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:11,800
It's really tough.

909
00:52:11,830 --> 00:52:14,630
Education fees are hefty
and such. It's hard.

910
00:52:14,630 --> 00:52:15,630
Aigoo...

911
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:17,260
There's so much fine dust.

912
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:18,860
It's hard to go outside.

913
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:20,180
Aigoo, I see.

914
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:22,080
It's worrisome.

915
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:23,300
Hello, you're working hard.

916
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:24,770
I'm Wie Dae Han.

917
00:52:24,770 --> 00:52:26,640
- May I have a minute?
- Yes, sure.

918
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:28,570
How is the delivery service
business these days?

919
00:52:28,570 --> 00:52:30,510
The shipping fees are too low.

920
00:52:30,510 --> 00:52:32,400
An increase in the fees
would be great.

921
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,060
How is work these days?

922
00:52:34,060 --> 00:52:36,590
We start working in early
morning hours.

923
00:52:36,590 --> 00:52:39,700
It's nerve-racking due to
speeding cars in the morning.

924
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:43,540
Everyone, please consider the safety of
sanitation workers in the mornings.

925
00:52:43,540 --> 00:52:45,700
Please do not speed.

926
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:46,680
Do us this favor.

927
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:48,310
- Hello, sorry to interrupt your meal.
- Oh, hello.

928
00:52:48,310 --> 00:52:49,900
I'm Wie Dae Han.

929
00:52:49,930 --> 00:52:53,030
These days, the carpool
system is hard for us.

930
00:52:53,030 --> 00:52:56,230
It's so hard to meet our
company payouts. It's so hard.

931
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:59,840
Aigoo, the prices went up by a lot.

932
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:03,370
<i>After paying for the kids' tutors,
we're always in the red.</i>

933
00:53:03,370 --> 00:53:06,390
<i>I know how much it
costs to raise kids.</i>

934
00:53:06,390 --> 00:53:08,830
I used to have four kids
until recently.

935
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:14,150
I heard you sent three of them
to their biological father.

936
00:53:14,150 --> 00:53:16,560
She's talking about us! About us!

937
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:19,580
You be quiet. I can't hear.

938
00:53:20,570 --> 00:53:23,490
<i>I grew quite fond of them
while we lived together.</i>

939
00:53:23,490 --> 00:53:25,720
I wanted to keep living together,

940
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:27,380
but that would be selfish.

941
00:53:28,410 --> 00:53:29,770
I guess.

942
00:53:29,770 --> 00:53:31,940
Their biological dad
wants to raise them.

943
00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:33,240
Nothing you can do.

944
00:53:34,290 --> 00:53:37,440
<i>Instead, even though
I'm not the kids' dad,</i>

945
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:38,980
<i>I'd like to be their sponsor.</i>

946
00:53:38,980 --> 00:53:40,860
<i>If the kids run into any hardships...</i>

947
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:43,290
Hyung, what is a "sponsor"?

948
00:53:45,150 --> 00:53:47,060
It's like a superhero.

949
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:50,200
I miss him already.

950
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:51,430
Ahjussi...

951
00:53:51,430 --> 00:53:52,940
Me, too.

952
00:53:52,940 --> 00:53:54,620
We're watching him right now.

953
00:53:59,030 --> 00:54:01,280
Why did you turn it off so quickly?

954
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:03,390
If it's fun, I want to see it, too.

955
00:54:03,390 --> 00:54:05,000
It's nothing much.

956
00:54:13,850 --> 00:54:16,360
What were you watching
that was so fun?

957
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:18,370
- A cartoon!
- A video game.

958
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:27,900
I see.

959
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:30,260
I think I know what you watched.

960
00:54:30,260 --> 00:54:34,320
That Wie Dae Han TV or
whatever. It was that, huh?

961
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:36,600
According to today's public poll,

962
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:40,240
Wie Dae Han is leading
candidate Kang by 2%.

963
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:42,440
How many days until the election?

964
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:44,010
Five days.

965
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:50,480
I think it's now time to tighten up
the leash on Wie Dae Han.

966
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:55,180
Man, I can't walk anymore.

967
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:57,160
Let's take a car tomorrow, okay?

968
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:59,930
Aigoo, you're such a whiner.

969
00:54:59,930 --> 00:55:01,910
How much does it hurt, huh?

970
00:55:01,910 --> 00:55:03,910
- Look, look. The skin is all peeled.
- Aigoo, aigoo...

971
00:55:03,910 --> 00:55:05,960
Hey, this looks bad...

972
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:07,150
Ow!

973
00:55:07,150 --> 00:55:08,700
Aigoo, what a crybaby.

974
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:14,240
I know it's a minute difference,

975
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:16,190
but we still beat Kang Joon Ho.

976
00:55:16,190 --> 00:55:18,410
It was worth the hardship.

977
00:55:18,410 --> 00:55:20,380
Right? Hey.

978
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:24,920
Compared to the three-step
pilgrimage, this is nothing.

979
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:28,050
Chicken delivery!

980
00:55:28,050 --> 00:55:29,520
- Oh?
- Huh?

981
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:31,040
Aigoo, really.

982
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:33,630
It's hard for you to get around.
Why come all the way here?

983
00:55:33,630 --> 00:55:35,300
I know.

984
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:37,630
Attorney ahjussi's entire
family is involved.

985
00:55:37,630 --> 00:55:39,040
I should at least deliver chicken.

986
00:55:40,230 --> 00:55:42,720
Aigoo, she's such a good daughter.

987
00:55:44,030 --> 00:55:46,290
I'm Wie Dae Han's blood, you know.

988
00:55:49,090 --> 00:55:50,260
Please dig in.

989
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:51,890
- Let's eat.
- Okay, yes, yes.

990
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:53,320
All right, then.

991
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:54,890
Let's eat. Wow...

992
00:55:54,890 --> 00:55:55,720
[ Central Inju City:
Assemblymen Approval Rating ]

993
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:58,540
[ Public Poll Results:
Kang Joon Ho 38%, Wie Dae Han 40% ]

994
00:55:58,540 --> 00:56:01,200
What's more important
than the 2% difference

995
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:04,820
is that Wie Dae Han's approval
ratings keep climbing up.

996
00:56:05,730 --> 00:56:09,030
Why don't we change our
campaign strategy, too?

997
00:56:09,030 --> 00:56:11,970
Since our way is no different
than any previous methods,

998
00:56:11,970 --> 00:56:13,700
we're not getting noticed.

999
00:56:15,230 --> 00:56:18,230
Not everyone is
a showman, you know.

1000
00:56:18,230 --> 00:56:21,530
Let's say Wie Dae Han dances
around in his underwear.

1001
00:56:21,530 --> 00:56:23,930
People will think it's entertaining.

1002
00:56:23,930 --> 00:56:26,260
But what will they think
if you did that?

1003
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:28,900
Geez, I'm not saying
let's put on a show.

1004
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:34,160
I meant something that will
change the voters' minds...

1005
00:56:34,230 --> 00:56:36,730
We'll need that "something,"
wouldn't we?

1006
00:56:36,730 --> 00:56:39,130
Aigoo, everyone knows that.

1007
00:56:39,130 --> 00:56:41,430
It's hard to figure out how.

1008
00:56:42,230 --> 00:56:43,330
I know..

1009
00:56:46,970 --> 00:56:49,640
Reporter Nam, you're working hard.

1010
00:56:50,620 --> 00:56:53,220
We'll keep pressing and
score a victory.

1011
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:54,670
Thank you.

1012
00:56:56,490 --> 00:56:59,370
I need to speak with Joon Ho alone.

1013
00:57:00,450 --> 00:57:02,820
Yes, sir. I'll leave you alone.

1014
00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:05,750
According to today's public poll,

1015
00:57:05,750 --> 00:57:08,130
you're behind Wie Dae Han by 2%.

1016
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:12,550
It's a minute difference, and
we still have five more days.

1017
00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:16,110
I mean, we even unified the votes.

1018
00:57:16,110 --> 00:57:18,570
Why do you think you're
behind Wie Dae Han?

1019
00:57:18,570 --> 00:57:22,200
We unified the votes before the election,
and a big party is supporting me.

1020
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:24,760
Because our strategy
seems engineered,

1021
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:27,020
the voters are turning their backs.

1022
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:28,560
I think otherwise.

1023
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:31,510
Wie Dae Han has an interesting story,

1024
00:57:31,510 --> 00:57:33,290
but you don't.

1025
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:37,840
If your assessment is correct,

1026
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:39,950
then an election is useless.

1027
00:57:39,950 --> 00:57:43,400
I can't come up with a moving story
five days before the election.

1028
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:45,240
However,

1029
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:48,380
we can expose that
Wie Dae Han's story...

1030
00:57:48,380 --> 00:57:50,230
is a complete lie.

1031
00:57:51,470 --> 00:57:52,850
What are you talking about?

1032
00:57:52,850 --> 00:57:56,390
Wie Dae Han's kids' biological father...

1033
00:57:56,390 --> 00:58:00,650
gave us a piece of information.

1034
00:58:00,650 --> 00:58:03,920
<i>It was a complete show from the start.</i>

1035
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:07,050
<i>Wie Dae Han is not
Da Jung's biological dad.</i>

1036
00:58:07,050 --> 00:58:09,710
<i>Was Wie Dae Han aware of this, too?</i>

1037
00:58:09,710 --> 00:58:11,020
<i>Of course.</i>

1038
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:13,450
<i>He even ran a paternity test.</i>

1039
00:58:13,450 --> 00:58:17,100
<i>Then who is Da Jung's
real biological father?</i>

1040
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:20,170
<i>I used to be a Violent
Crimes Unit detective.</i>

1041
00:58:20,170 --> 00:58:22,990
<i>He was a sex offender
I was trailing after.</i>

1042
00:58:24,010 --> 00:58:27,620
<i>Sun Mi was raped and gave
birth to Da Jung as a result.</i>

1043
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:35,770
This...

1044
00:58:37,110 --> 00:58:38,670
Is it true?

1045
00:58:38,670 --> 00:58:41,650
We couldn't rely on his words alone,

1046
00:58:41,650 --> 00:58:44,540
so we ran a DNA test discreetly

1047
00:58:44,540 --> 00:58:47,550
on Wie Dae Han and his "daughter."

1048
00:58:47,550 --> 00:58:49,040
It's true.

1049
00:58:52,530 --> 00:58:54,680
If we release this to the press,

1050
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:57,160
they'll have a field day writing articles.

1051
00:58:57,160 --> 00:59:00,630
Then Wie Dae Han will fall
in a blink of an eye.

1052
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:05,280
Why did you bring this to me...

1053
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:07,120
instead of releasing it to the press?

1054
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:10,090
I'm also a father who has a child.

I don't think he'll just bury it.

You called me out so late.

What?

1106
01:01:54,130 --> 01:01:56,270
During our high school days,

1107
01:01:56,270 --> 01:01:58,460
I was envious of you, to be frank.

1108

What are you talking about?

1109
01:02:01,140 --> 01:02:04,150
You lacked for nothing.
Why would you envy me?

1110
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:07,790
You're right.

1111
01:02:07,790 --> 01:02:09,490
I didn't lack much.

1112
01:02:10,470 --> 01:02:11,970
But even so,

1113
01:02:11,970 --> 01:02:14,350
I felt lacking in many ways,

1114
01:02:15,250 --> 01:02:17,560
and made the best effort
whenever I could.

1115
01:02:18,740 --> 01:02:20,750
I didn't want to lose the top spot.

1116
01:02:22,010 --> 01:02:24,610
While I struggled in school
in such fashion,

1117
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:28,180
you did whatever you wanted,

1118
01:02:28,180 --> 01:02:30,350

Both in grades and popularity.

1120
01:02:33,340 --> 01:02:34,550
I was envious.

01:02:35,580 --> 01:02:37,430
With a hint of inferiority complex.

a compliment or sarcasm,

01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:51,530
but life is not easy for anyone.

1127
01:02:51,530 --> 01:02:55,260
I'm sure you had your own
obstacles to overcome,

1128
01:02:56,890 --> 01:03:00,010

You know that?
