Let's eat.

00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,630
Yes, sir.

5
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:35,220
I didn't get the surgery.

6
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,990
I'll have the baby.

7
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:42,150
Our baby...

8
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:44,840
that's inside of me.

9
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:53,460
What is Da Jung saying?

10
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:55,680
Is this true?

11
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:57,870
Yes.

12
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:05,140
You'll really have this baby?

13
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:09,040
I know.

14

That I'm totally baffled and
unbelievable right now.

15
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:16,250
Yes, as you just said...

Let's hear it first.

18

Why are you so baffled right now?

19
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,030
As you said, Ahjussi.

20
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:33,690
If Mom had chosen to
terminate her pregnancy...

21
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:38,910
then I wouldn't be here.

You'd think we had an earthquake.

27
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,040
Sorry.

28
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,440
It's a habit.

29
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:33,870
Why?

30
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,240
Are you scared?

31
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:39,410
No.

32
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:41,190
Why would I be scared?

33
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:45,640
I'm the one who said
to keep the baby.

34
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,450
When you said that...

35
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,630
it's not because you wanted to.

36
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:00,490
You just felt very bad for me.

37
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:05,030
I tried to get rid of the
baby because...

38
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:08,880
you're about to make
your debut, and I felt bad.

39
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,750
Why should you feel bad?

40
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,340

41
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:17,340

Honestly...

44

I want to have this baby.

45
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:40,430
But this isn't for me to decide alone.

Sunbae, I know this
puts you in a bind.

54
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:17,230
But consider how Da Jung feels.

55
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:21,010
From her standpoint, having an abortion
is like denying her own existence.

56
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:24,200
Don't spew abstract statements.

57
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,620
I know one thing for sure.

58
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:26,700
What's that?

59
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,440
Having a baby is denying
her own reality.

60
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,430
I have the responsibility
to get them to realize it.

61
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:34,290
We're the adults here!

62
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,880
Abortion?

63
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,980
Didn't you say it was immoral?

64
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,300
Hey, that's...

65
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,380
I personally don't think it's immoral.

66
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:45,880
That's what I'm saying.

67
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,720
How can all abortions be immoral?

68
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,540
In many cases, it's a bad idea
for all parties involved.

69
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,270
So for all women deciding
on an abortion...

70
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:55,350
should be respected as such.

71
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:58,160
- I agree.
- But...

72
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,040
same goes for deciding
to have the baby.

73
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:04,760
Da Jung may be minor,
but she's wise.

74
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,530
Da Jung's decision...

75
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,340
We should respect it.

76
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,310
Jung Soo Hyun.

77
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:19,780
If Da Jung were your sister,
you'd still allow it?

78
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,420
Having a baby.

79
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:24,390
At least...

80
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:28,310
I wouldn't enforce my
disapproval like you.

81
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,240
We'd worry over it together,

82
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,730
and share the pain together.

83
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,620
Hey, I reached this decision
after deliberating.

84
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:43,180
Emotions do not solve problems.

85
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,790
Father.

86
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:08,320
We finished talking things over.

87
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,680
Then you made a decision.

88
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:15,270
If you have the baby, say goodbye
to your dreams and the future.

89
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:17,470
You'll be entering
a pitch dark tunnel.

90
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:19,980
But Da Jung...

91
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,400
went in that tunnel alone today.

92
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:26,350
What do you mean?

93
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:28,910
The operating room.

94
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,260
From now on...

95
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,140
I won't send her off alone.

96
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:42,670
Father.

97
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:45,180
I'm truly sorry, but...

98
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:47,710
we've...

99
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:51,370
decided to have the baby.

100
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,400
You're an idol trainee.

101
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,030
Are you giving up your debut?

102
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:06,590
That's...

103
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:09,340
not for me to decide alone.

104
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:13,110
I need to discuss it with my
CEO and the other members.

105
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:14,980
And your parents?

106
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:16,800
Do they know about this?

107
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,310
No.

108
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:20,410
They're not in Korea.

109
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:22,720
They emigrated to Canada.

110
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,540
I understand.

111
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:31,740
Go on home.

112
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:33,740
Yes.

113
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,240
Will you be okay by yourself?

114
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,100
Of course, I'll be okay.

115
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:41,930
Parents always give in
to their children.

116
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:55,680
Daebak, this is unbelievable.

117
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,010
How could she decide
to have the baby?

118
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:00,870
I understand how Da Jung feels.

119
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:02,080
You do?

120
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:06,430
Everyone has one thing
they can't let go of.

121
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:08,960
For Da Jung, it's her mom.

122
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,630
And she wants to take after her.

123
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:15,370
Unni, do you have one, too?

124
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,820
Something you can't let go of.

125
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:26,920
I understand how you feel.
I understand.

126
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,710
I do, but...

127
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:32,220
think it over for a few more days.

128
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:36,560
What decision would be best for
you and Jung Woo's future.

129
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,940
I'm not sure if this is a good
thing or a bad thing, but...

130
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:41,740
I...

131
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,940
don't ever look back on my decisions.

132
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,900
Thinking it over for a few more days...

133
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,380
won't change my mind.

134
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,910
That Jung Woo.

135
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:00,740
He's been a trainee for three years.

136
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,550
Your decision...

137
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:05,690
is canceling out those three
years. You know that?

138
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:07,990
That's why I had decided
to get an abortion.

139
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:09,950
So I won't hinder him.

140
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:11,100
So what happened?

141
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,360
As I was lying on the operation table...

142
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:18,310
<i>I realized those were all excuses.</i>

143
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:23,680
<i>It wasn't about being
a hindrance to Oppa...</i>

144
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,380
<i>but I was consumed by fear.</i>

145
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:30,910
Mom said this to me
before she passed away.

146
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:34,570
That having me...

147
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,220
was the best decision
she's ever made.

148
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:45,070
I don't know if I can follow
in her footsteps...

149
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,040
but I know I won't regret my decision.

150
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:54,360
I think you've forgotten.

151
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,100
We have a contract.

152
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:00,680
This is a violation of our contract.

153
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,790
Do you understand?

154
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:03,430
Yes, I know.

155
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:07,980
My siblings and I are
crashing at your place,

156
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:10,100
and now I'm having a baby, too.

157
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,480
It's shameless.

158
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,860
If you know that, why are
you doing this? Huh?

159
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:17,130
I know, but...

160
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,540
I really can't...

161
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,840
bring myself to get rid of it.

162
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:29,440
I'm sorry.

163
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:31,640
I mean it.

164
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:43,400
This isn't something an apology
and tears will take care of.

165
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:48,350
As your guardian, I can't allow this.

166
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:50,030
No way.

167
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,110
You're right.

168
00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:00,390
I shouldn't be crying over
something like this.

169
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:04,050
There will be more difficulties
while raising my child.

170

<i>Oppa, are you really okay?</i>

171
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:37,890
<i>Of course I am.</i>

172
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:39,520
<i>My CEO is a nice man.</i>

173
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:42,110
<i>He'll understand when I tell him.</i>

174
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:44,340
<i>What if he doesn't?</i>

175
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:46,030
<i>You know.</i>

176
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:48,580
<i>I was struggling because being
an idol didn't suit me.</i>

177
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:51,760
<i>I'll be a dad instead of an idol.</i>

178
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,460
<i>I feel bad because I think
I'm ruining your future.</i>

179
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:07,440
<i>Then should we think this
over for a few more days?</i>

180
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:14,110
<i>Should we reconsider?</i>

181
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,640
<i>You're the most precious
person to me.</i>

182
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,240
<i>What scares me the most...</i>

183
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,510
<i>is that you'll regret ever meeting me.</i>

184
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:34,950
<i>Us getting together and the
decision we made today.</i>

185
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:37,060
<i>I'll make sure you won't regret it.</i>

186
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,390
To sum everything up,
this is the current status.

187
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:51,380
Da Jung has no idea she's not
your biological daughter,

188
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:55,820
and no one knows that
you two have a contract.

189
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:59,850
But Da Jung goes and
gets herself pregnant.

190
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:01,160
And even worse,

191
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,850
she announced that
she'll have the baby.

192
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:05,430
And you're...

193
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:09,360
trying to convince Da Jung
to have an abortion.

194
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,340
But in front of the entire nation,

195
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:16,240
you made a fuss saying
abortions are immoral.

196
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:21,440
This is amazingly exciting.

197
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,730
Is this fun for you?

198
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:27,940
Huh? Is it fun?

199
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,450
So what will you do?

200
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:32,580
Hey.

201
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,610
If she really has this baby,

202
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:37,430
people will focus on us even more.

203
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:40,150
Forget the contract,
I'll be stuck permanently.

204
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:43,210
I'll be taking care of the four siblings
and Da Jung's baby for life.

205
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:44,490
No way.

206
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,340
Over my dead body, no way.

207
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:48,440
What if she insists on
having the baby?

208
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,270
If she insists?

209
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,790
The way of the world isn't so easy.

210
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:02,740
Da Jung won't be having this baby,
so don't worry about it.

211
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,640
What's going with the
rental apartments?

212
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:10,110
Most of the market retailers are
siding with the rental apartments.

213
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,420
Right?

214
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:16,810
You must be the king
of "dissonance..."

215
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:18,990
Hey.

216
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,970
It's not "dissonance,"
it's "internal dissonance."

217
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:23,820
Repeat after me.
"Internal dissonance."

218
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,940
- "Internal dissonance."
- Yeah, that's it.

219
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:27,450
Now you got it.

220
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:32,640
Anyway, Kang Kyung Hoon will be at the
international high school protest tomorrow.

221
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:36,910
Really?

222
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:42,410
Then let's give him the VIP treatment.

223
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,360
Hey, guys.

224
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,020
How are the bean sprouts?

225
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:04,770
I made it for the first time,
so I'm not sure if it's good.

226
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,060
It's no good!

227
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:12,490
It's really salty.

228
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,420
Really?

229
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:18,370
No, it's delicious.

230
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:19,660
Right, Song Yi?

231
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,640
Yes, it's yummy.

232
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:25,020
Came right out of the sea.

233
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:28,830
It's impolite to complain.

234
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:30,510
In front of the cook.

235
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:33,510
What gives? You're taking my side.

236
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:35,420
But it's true.

237
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:38,210
Cooking for a family is
no laughing matter.

238
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:39,810
You're right.

239
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:42,570
All the dishes here
require a lot of work.

240
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:44,370
Eat up.

241
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:47,710
I think all mothers are admirable.

242
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:50,530
They cook every day,
make rice, clean,

243
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:52,540
do the laundry, and
look after the kids.

244
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:55,070
They never get a break, never.

245
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:59,810
When they're babies, you can't
communicate, and they poop all day.

246
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:02,510
When they get bigger, they're
ungrateful and start acting out.

247
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:05,640
Plus, do you know how much
it costs to raise a kid?

248
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,770
From birth to college graduation,

249
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:09,780
it'll cost 300 million won.

250
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:12,430
Aigoo, I wish they
came with money.

251
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,370
Thank you for the meal.

252
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:23,410
Da Jung, you should eat
more before you go...

253
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:27,170
Aigoo, seriously...

254
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:29,760
You should let her eat in peace.

255
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,340
Let her be.

256
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,560
By the way,

257
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:37,020
I hear this week's "People's Assembly Hall"
deals with housing issues.

258
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:38,650
How did you know?

259
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:40,350
Ms. An called me yesterday.

260
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:41,820
I'll propose this week's bill.

261
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,280
Did you have something in mind?

262
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,640
Yes, I do.

263
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,530
I'm very keen on young
people's housing welfare.

264
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,560
Yes, yes, thank you for your help.

265
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,430
In order to revive the market,

266
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:55,160
we'll have to be more vocal, right?

267
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,330
<i>Aigoo, of course.</i>

268
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:58,310
We'll see you later at City Hall.

269
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:00,010
- Yes, ma'am.
- We have faith in you.

270
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:01,550
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
Have a good day.

271
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:03,060
Yes, yes, please get going.

272
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,350
Yes.

273
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:05,490
Mr. Jung!

274
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:10,130
Aigoo, Chairman.
What brings you by so early?

275
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:12,610
Oh, you want chicken
for your hangover?

276
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:15,420
You have the nerve to
stab me in the back.

277
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,670
Stab you in the back?

278
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:18,540
I hear you're going around

279
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:21,980
persuading all the market's retailers
to support the rental apartments.

280
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:23,940
Chairman, that's not it...

281
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:25,410
I'm speechless.

282
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:28,190
Who do you think keeps
this market in business?

283
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:29,390
Aigoo, really.

284
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:31,510
The ignorant folks
are always like this.

285
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:33,620
You have no principles at all.

286
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:37,810
Chairman, you're being too harsh.

287
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:41,090
We're educated well enough, too.

288
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:44,120
All the owners here are
educated enough.

289
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,080
Just because I run a chicken joint,

290
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,250
you shouldn't look down on me.

291
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:49,260
That's enough.

292
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:52,010
Let's see how well
your business does.

293
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:55,450
I'll post on mom's cafe
about this place.

294
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:56,830
Hey, hey, Chairman...

295
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:57,830
- Chairman...
- Hey!

296
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:01,120
- Are you talking to me?
- Yeah.

297
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,490
You see anyone else there?

298
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:03,410
What the...

299
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:05,420
How dare you speak down on me?

300
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,730
No.

301
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:11,790
- Mi Sook, please don't.
- Move your hand.

302
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:13,740
Calm down.

303
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:16,140
Use your words. No hitting, okay?

304
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:19,250
Even if...

305
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:21,450
there are no customers,

306
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:25,370
we all work from early
mornings to late at night.

307
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,760
You should be helping
people like us.

308
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,590
You shouldn't go around
spreading ridiculous rumors!

309
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:31,690
Give me a break.

310
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:35,140
You folks are the ones
spreading ridiculous rumors.

311
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,440
Oh, yeah?

312
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:37,990
Let's duke it out

313
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:39,940
and see who's more ridiculous.

314
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:42,030
I'll stay here, so don't
worry about the store.

315
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:45,450
Go to the protest and show
that woman who's the boss.

316
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:47,070
- Really?
- Yeah.

317
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:48,270
Okay!

318
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:51,450
Let's see who wins, you hear?

319
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,490
Unni, here.

320
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:00,690
Thank you.

321
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:06,170
One of my acquaintances...

322
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:09,320
is pregnant, but still single.

323
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,750
Who is it?

324
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,630
Is it someone I know?

325
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:14,870
No, you don't know her.

326
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,270
And?

327
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:18,710
And...

328
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:21,760
she says she'll have the baby, but...

329
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,960
I'm torn if I should be
stopping her or not.

330
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,700
- How old is she?
- Huh?

331
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,410
Well...

332
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:32,020
she's still in college.

333
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:33,110
Whoa.

334
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:36,220
What are you torn about?
You should stop her at all costs.

335
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:39,430
She couldn't get a job.
How will she raise the baby?

336
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:42,450
Does her family own a building
in Gangnam or something?

337
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:44,380
Building, my foot.

338
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:47,770
Aigoo...

339
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:49,940
You look distressed.

340
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,640
Attorney Kang.

341
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,190
What brings you by...

342
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:55,980
I was in the area and
came to cheer you on.

343
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:59,670
Attorney Kang, what's
that you're holding?

344
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:01,990
Please make me look good on TV.

345
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,640
- Bribing you with spicy rice cakes.
- Daebak.

346
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,340
Actually, I was just about to call you.

347
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,440
I guess this week's topic is out?

348
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:11,390
Yes.

349
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:13,960
Assemblyman Wie is in
charge of that this week.

350
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,060
What is it?

351
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:18,590
Probably the expansion of rental
apartments for the communities.

352
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:20,130
I like that.

353
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:23,430
I had wanted to debate
regarding that issue.

354
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:27,570
[ No international high school!
/ No apartments! ]

355
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:31,560
Pooreun Rental Apartments
will ruin Central City!

356
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:35,540
<i>Central City will be ruined!</i>

357
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:40,020
Supporting young people
will revive Central City!

358
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:42,110
<i>Revive! Revive!</i>

359
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:44,130
<i>We'll revive!</i>

360
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:47,730
For Central City's advancement, an
international high school is the answer!

361
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:51,800
<i>International high school!</i>

362
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,990
2,000 new residents

363
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:56,490
mean 2,000 more for the market!

364
00:20:56,490 --> 00:21:00,280
<i>2,000 more! 2,000 more!</i>

365
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,510
Everyone, everyone.

366
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:04,130
Assemblyman Kang Kyung Hoon
is here to support

367
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:06,150
the international-high school!

368
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:10,760
We'll now hear from
Assemblyman Kang!

369
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,600
<i>- Kang Kyung Hoon!</i><b>- Hello, everyone.</b>

370
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,960
I'm Kang Kyung Hoon,
the son of Inju City!

371
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:21,570
I'll just make a brief statement.

372
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,700
Rental apartments for young people?

373
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,690
Yes, it's necessary.

374
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:30,920
However, there is an order
to everything, isn't there?

375
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,840
<i>That's right!</i>

376
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,640
There is a reason for the saying,

377
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,490
"One's environment makes the man."

378
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:41,510
The best area for
raising your children is

379
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:43,720
an area with excellent schools!

380
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,080
<i>That's right!</i>

381
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,820
Let's bring in the
international high school

382
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:52,090
and make Central City
an enviable place

383
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:55,310
for all the best mothers out there!

384
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:58,010
Please stay strong!

385
00:21:58,010 --> 00:21:59,550
<i>Kang Kyung Hoon!</i>

386
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:01,160
<i>International high school!</i>

387
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,790
<i>Kang Kyung Hoon!</i>

388
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:03,990
<i>International high school!</i>

389
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:05,000
Hello!

390
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,390
I'm Wie Dae Han.

391
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:12,610
<i>Wie Dae Han! </i>

392
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:19,990
<i>Wie Dae Han!</i>

393
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:21,370
Everyone!

394
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:24,190
Let's say an international
high school gets built,

395
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:27,990
and all the best moms
move to Central City.

396
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:30,910
But even the smartest kid

397
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:34,200
would not be able to attend
this international high school.

398
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,990
Do you know why?

399
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:39,610
Because tuition is
astronomically expensive!

400
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:43,640
Everyone, he's right!

401
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,420
To attend this high school,

402
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:49,380
the tuition will be more
than 10 million won!

403
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:55,050
Who here is able to send their kids

404
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:57,310
to that international high school?

405
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:59,080
<i>Not us!</i>

406
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,690
An international high school

407
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:04,820
will only promote discord
among the residents,

408
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:07,140
and incite private education.

409
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:09,890
However, the rental apartments

410
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:12,390
will infuse hope to

411
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:16,020
the young people who are
struggling in this day and age!

412
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:18,220
And their energy will

413
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:23,030
transform Central City into a town
overflowing with vitality!

414
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,030
<i>That's right!</i>

415
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,350
Wie Dae Han is an
unbeatable speaker.

416
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:33,110
Not even the greatest scholars.

417
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,170
<i>Central City will revive!</i>

418
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:38,030
Everyone, everyone!

419
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:41,960
Have you already forgotten what
this man here has done?

420
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:46,550
He left his own father to kill
himself at a study dorm.

421
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,260
<i>She's right!</i>

422
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,520
It's true.

423
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,830
That's in the past.
Why bring it up again?

424
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:56,190
Aigoo, he even abandoned
his own father.

425
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:58,040
Would he take care
of the young people?

426
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:01,680
Even a dog would laugh
at this, everyone.

427
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:07,410
Will you be all right?

428
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:09,240
- If you can't, I'll just...
- I'm fine.

429
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,720
Everyone.

430
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,270
Everyone!

431
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,340
Yes.

432
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:21,020
I am...

433
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,010
a "sinner."

434
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,840
I hated my father,

435
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:34,210
so I had looked the other way.

436
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,460
But everyone,

437
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,820
a "sinner" is still a human being.

438
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:44,780
I regret my wrongdoings,

439
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:47,050
and I'm paying my repentance.

440
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:51,070
After my father passed away,

441
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,600
<i>I only realized this
after I went to the </i>

442
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,890
<i>study dorm to gather his belongings.</i>

443
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:05,120
<i>Even though I was a bad son,</i>

444
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:06,240
[ Assemblyman Wie Dae Han ]

445
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:08,770
<i>he was still proud of me.</i>

446
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:14,310
<i>During my three-step pilgrimage, </i>

447
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:16,640
<i>I made a promise to my father.</i>

448
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,730
<i>That I'll conduct politics on
behalf of people like him.</i>

449
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:25,430
That I'll be a son he can be proud of!

450
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:29,860
This is why I'm standing right here.

451
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:34,830
They may be of a different
generation from my father,

452
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:37,320
but just as he did...

453
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:40,780
they're suffering in
various study dorms!

454
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:44,500
I want to be on the young
people's side, everyone!

455
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:47,410
<i>That's right!</i>

456
00:25:47,410 --> 00:26:01,260
<i>Wie Dae Han!</i>

457
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,890
I wasn't aware Wie Dae Han would
be leading the opposing protest.

458
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:08,460
My apologies.

459
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:11,550
We'll check things more
meticulously going forward.

460
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:13,890
Trust is like that.

461
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:16,880
It's hard to earn, but easy to lose.

462
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,840
I'll keep that in mind.

463
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:23,110
However, we now have a new card.

464
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:24,270
Card?

465
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:28,410
Someone tailing Wie Dae Han
sent over an interesting photo.

466
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:35,130
That looks like
Wie Dae Han's daughter.

467
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:37,780
Yes. Go on to the next one.

468
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:43,570
We did some checking,
and she's 11 weeks pregnant.

469
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:46,680
Even though he stated that
abortions are immoral,

470
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:49,040
I don't think he'll let
her have the baby.

471
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,010
Interesting.

472
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:00,730
Kang Kyung Hoon.

473
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,940
He's no ordinary man.

474
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:06,140
He didn't even blink an eye.

475
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:08,800
The stronger the foe,
the more I can shine.

476
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:13,320
Since we have the upper hand,

477
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,020
let's keep pushing.

478
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,940
Yes, of course.

479
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,840
You don't have plans later, right?

480
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:23,520
Tonight?

481
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,020
Why?

482
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:27,390
Chairman Baek wants
to have dinner.

483
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,740
I see.

484
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:31,310
Okay.

485
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:33,820
If the party's chairman
is taking note,

486
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,990
you've passed through
the ring of fire.

487
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:40,690
Too early to be resting
on my laurels.

488
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:42,640
The general election is
still far away.

489
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,240
That's true.

490
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,390
Who knows what unexpected
events may occur.

491
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:49,310
There's Da Jung's issue, too.

492
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:51,740
That will be resolved today.

493
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:58,450
She ditches school,

494
00:27:58,450 --> 00:28:01,070
and sleeps all day long.

495
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:02,660
What a life.

496
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:25,420
<i>Honestly...</i>

497
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:27,620
<i>I want to have this baby.</i>

498
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:32,120
<i>What do you want to do, Oppa?</i>

499
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:38,100
Jung Woo, CEO is asking for you.

500
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:54,960
<i>Come in.</i>

501
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,040
Hey.

502
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:12,680
All right, then.

503
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,220
Thank you for your time today.

504
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:18,440
You're the busy one, not me.

505
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:21,390
Let's play golf sometime.
I'm happy to have met you.

506
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:27,260
Your CEO is very cool,
you're blessed.

507
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:30,220
If you do as he says,
you'll strike it big.

508
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:36,240
- Okay, then.
- I'll see you out.

509
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:01,950
Your debut is two months away.

510
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:03,800
Are you out of your mind?

511
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:06,190
I'm sorry.

512
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:07,850
Don't argue with me.

513
00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:10,710
I'll make the appointment.
Get her an abortion tomorrow.

514
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:12,460
Get it done...

515
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:14,290
and get rid of the girl, too.

516
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:16,800
I...

517
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,840
can't do that.

518
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:21,720
This punk, are you crazy?

519
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:26,230
I feel terrible toward you
and the other members.

520
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:30,180
But I want to protect
Da Jung and the baby.

521
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:34,340
How noble you are.

522
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:38,910
This blame falls 100% on you.

523
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:42,160
Pay up three times the
contract cancellation fee,

524
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,760
and leave the group.

525
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:04,850
I hear "Dispute" will be covering
the issue of the rental apartment.

526
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:06,760
Wow...

527
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,690
Just who is your informant?

528
00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:10,560
You know everything.

529
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,640
Geez...

530
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,880
You must do well.

531
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:16,590
Kang Joon Ho is not to
be taken lightly.

532
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:20,160
He's more difficult to deal
with than Kang Kyung Hoon.

533
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:24,800
Those wealthy kids have
no chance against me.

534
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:28,340
They're only ritzy on the outside,
but weaklings inside.

535
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:34,800
Hello, sir.

536
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,940
Assemblyman Wie.

537
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:39,240
How long has it been?

538
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,970
I think being a dad suits him.

539
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:43,540
Thank you.

540
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:45,630
Chairman, you're looking great.

541
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:47,690
You must've found the
fountain of youth.

542
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:48,990
Is that right?

543
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:54,200
Even if they're empty
words, it's still nice.

544
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,430
- Okay, have a seat.
- Yes, sir.

545
00:31:56,430 --> 00:32:00,200
We have high expectations,
Assemblyman Wie.

546
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:04,180
Our party is lacking
a star these days.

547
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:05,550
Yes.

548
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,870
I'll do my best to meet
your expectations.

549
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:11,820
Good.

550
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:13,190
Let me pour you a shot.

551
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:16,440
Mayor Jung, give him
your full support.

552
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,440
Yes, sir.

553
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,240
I want our party to take
over Central City.

554
00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:23,280
Of course, we should.

555
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:26,090
Assemblyman Kang has
overstayed his welcome.

556
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:29,820
The rumor that Kang Kyung Hoon's son
will run in the general election.

557
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:31,660
It's all over Yeouido.

558
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:34,680
Yes, he said so himself.

559
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,490
He's thinking over the
general election.

560
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:40,000
Thinking over means
that he'll be running.

561
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,950
If he runs, this paints a fun picture.

562
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:46,340
It'll be "The Nation's Son..."

563
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:49,270
versus "The Nation's Dad."

564
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:56,360
This district will be the hottest topic
in the next general election.

565
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,580
If we gain the upper hand here,

566
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:02,170
we'll shift the presidential
election as well.

567
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:06,890
I'll do my best. Yes.

568
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:08,330
Mother.

569
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:09,610
Thank you.

570
00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:11,780
Don't ask Hye Jin to come
and go as you please.

571
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:13,250
She's a busy girl.

572
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:15,190
I didn't ask her to.

573
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:17,430
Hye Jin, did I do that?

574
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:19,230
No.

575
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:22,480
I come over to see you, Mother.

576
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,870
Going to restaurants and
shopping with you

577
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:28,380
is more fun than hanging
out with my friends.

578
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,920
Did you hear that?

579
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:34,430
Hye Jin and I get along
so well. Don't you know?

580
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:39,250
Since I live with two such
boring and stoic men,

581
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:41,800
I'm so envious of people
who have daughters.

582
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,490
After we got close,

583
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:46,480
all of my envy disappeared.

584
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,560
Let's not delay any more.

585
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,370
Set the date for this year.

586
00:33:50,370 --> 00:33:51,610
That's right.

587
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:55,110
A man needs his own family
to achieve great things.

588
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:58,630
Hye Jin is a suitable
candidate for your wife.

589
00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:00,650
I've already told you.

590
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:02,820
Hye Jin is like a sister to me.

591
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:06,270
Since you're already close,
you just need a wedding.

592
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:07,440
Isn't that right?

593
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,320
There is someone I like.

594
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:16,440
Who?

595
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:20,740
Well, I don't want to
tell anyone yet.

596
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:23,740
If you'll discuss marriage,
don't call Hye Jin over.

597
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:25,440
It's rude.

598
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:29,800
It's not rude.

599
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:32,230
I come over on my own will.

600
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:36,720
But I am curious about the
person you have feelings for.

601
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:41,960
He's not answering the phone,

602
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,860
and not answering my texts.

603
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:48,250
Oppa has never been like this...

604
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:49,810
I'm a little worried.

605
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,780
Men are like that.

606
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:57,450
If they're disturbed about
something, they go into a cave.

607
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:00,770
If you wait, he'll come back out.

608
00:35:02,490 --> 00:35:03,900
Unni...

609
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:07,820
Don't I seem pathetic to you?

610
00:35:09,730 --> 00:35:11,440
Well,

611
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,580
not quite pathetic.

612
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:15,220
Truthfully,

613
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:17,690
you do seem thoughtless.

614
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:19,740
So why aren't you stopping me?

615
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:22,040
If I do, will you listen to me?

616
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:25,280
No.

617
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:31,490
Sunbae will try to stop you.

618
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:35,620
I'll just stay by your side.

619
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:38,470
You can lean on me
when going gets tough.

620
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:47,340
Since the man upstairs
took my mom early...

621
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,300
I think he sent me to you.

622
00:35:55,850 --> 00:35:57,110
Hey!

623
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,360
You're pregnant?

624
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:06,560
Yes, I understand.

625
00:36:18,350 --> 00:36:21,050
What grade is your daughter in?

626
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:22,990
She's a junior in high school.

627
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:26,760
Why are you mentioning Da Jung...

628
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:29,420
An article...

629
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:33,780
stating she's pregnant
just popped up.

630
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,170
My God, holy moly...

631
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:42,840
How could something
like this happen?

632
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:46,890
And the baby's dad is
an idol trainee.

633
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:50,620
From what I saw on TV,
she looks boy-crazy.

634
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:52,880
We don't know if this is true.

635
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,340
It's from the gossip pages
of Wall Street News.

636
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:57,570
I'm sure they're gossiping
for a reason.

637
00:36:57,570 --> 00:37:01,350
Wie Dae Han stated on TV that
he thinks abortions are immoral.

638
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:03,550
What will happen now?

639
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:06,900
To abide by the law,
she must have the baby.

640
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:10,090
This means Wie Dae Han
will be a grandfather?

641
00:37:10,090 --> 00:37:11,790
Grandpa Wie Dae Han.

642
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:15,230
Please stop.

643
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:17,740
What? What did I do?

644
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:21,270
If the article is correct,
a family is about to be shattered.

645
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:23,100
Is it something to laugh about?

646
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:30,800
Leaking this gossip piece...

647
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,540
Was it you?

648
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:33,680
Yes.

649
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:37,930
We must pay back for what
you had to go through today.

650
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:40,880
Did you confirm on the abortion?

651
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,890
Well, not yet...

652
00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:46,450
You'll have the rice
before it's fully cooked?

653
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,150
I think I expected too
much from you.

654
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:55,560
Can I talk to you for a minute?

655
00:37:58,420 --> 00:37:59,750
Go on home.

656
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:01,600
Yes, sir.

657
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:10,380
The article...

658
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:12,490
It was you, right?

659
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:13,910
Yes.

660
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:17,980
I found out about it by chance.

661
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:20,190
I released it for the good
of the public.

662
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:22,320
But it's a personal matter.

663
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,250
What does it have to
do with the public?

664
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:28,360
It's important info to judge
a particular politician's character.

665
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,660
Of course, people should know.

666
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:33,240
Must you really resort to this?

667
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:36,340
If I can win,

668
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:39,380
I would do something
even worse than this.

669
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:41,710
This is the way I learned
and conducted politics.

670
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:43,810
Because you conduct
yourself this way...

671
00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:46,430
the citizens detest politicians.

672
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:48,220
Anyone can...

673
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:49,850
be critical of others.

674
00:38:49,850 --> 00:38:52,830
If you don't like my style,
then do it yourself.

675
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,860
Stop the lecturing,

676
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:58,200
and show them what a
"healthy conservatism" should be!

677
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,550
The world has changed,

678
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:03,440
but you're still the
same as you were...

679
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:06,180
20 years ago.

680
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:14,320
You're such a weakling.

681
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,310
Even if it's not true,

682
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:19,410
there's no point in
hearing any nonsense.

683
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:21,520
Yes. I'll take care of it.

684
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,440
Let's go.

685
00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:34,340
It's really not true?

686
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:39,270
The gossip column makes
up stories every day.

687
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:43,680
You keep your kids in check.

688
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:46,020
If a politician's kids get in trouble,

689
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:48,100
they don't criticize the kid.

690
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:50,760
They criticize the politician instead.

691
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:55,730
"The Nation's Dad" could
spiral down in an instant.

692
00:39:55,730 --> 00:39:57,340
Aigoo, I know that.

693
00:39:57,340 --> 00:40:00,050
I used to be the
"Nation's Sinner" until recently.

694
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:01,520
Aigoo.

695
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,560
This is why gossip column
is deemed trashy.

696
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,460
It's a complete fabrication.

697
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:07,920
Aigoo, don't worry.

698
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,050
She's a junior in high school.

699
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:12,310
It's not possible for
her to be pregnant.

700
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:14,690
Aigoo, it's an error, an error.

701
00:40:14,690 --> 00:40:18,240
Reporter Heo, what's
the matter with you?

702
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,610
Aigoo, really.

703
00:40:19,610 --> 00:40:22,710
Unless you pull the article, I'll press
charges for falsification and defamation.

704
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:25,040
Don't say I didn't warn you, okay?

705
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:28,010
I'm not screaming at you...

706
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:30,940
Reporter Heo. Reporter Heo?

707
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:31,930
Reporter...

708
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:33,640
You bastard!

709
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,940
Darn it.

710
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:41,440
What will you do?

711
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:44,590
What do you mean,
what will I do?

712
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:46,110
I'll deny it,

713
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:49,520
and get her an abortion discreetly.

714
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:52,420
It'll be difficult to be
discreet at this point.

715
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:54,900
Kang Kyung Hoon's paparazzi
could be trailing you.

716
00:40:56,570 --> 00:41:00,630
Since it turned out this way,
why not just keep the baby?

717
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:02,170
What, punk?

718
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:05,430

If Jung Woo's identity is revealed,

898
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:24,210

Why did you want to meet today?

902

Since Jung Woo is no
longer with our agency,

903
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:37,490
we could care less if your daughter

904

left the group,

947

01:00:44,210 --> 01:00:46,360
I'm getting a bad feeling...

1075
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:58,900
Before I speak about today's bill,

1076
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:02,270
I want to offer sincere apologies...

1077
01:01:02,270 --> 01:01:05,010
regarding my recent family issues.

1078
01:01:05,010 --> 01:01:07,720
- No way...<b><i>- What's even worse</i></b>

1079
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:10,630
<i>is that I was not being honest.</i>

1080
01:01:12,350 --> 01:01:15,820
I have consistently denied
my daughter's pregnancy.

1081
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:20,100
But she is...

1082
01:01:21,180 --> 01:01:22,340
pregnant.

1083
01:01:31,870 --> 01:01:34,410
What show is he putting on now?

1084
01:01:34,410 --> 01:01:35,470
Huh?

1085
01:01:38,670 --> 01:01:40,350
<i>She's 12 weeks pregnant and...</i>

1086
01:01:40,350 --> 01:01:41,930
Why, this punk...

1087
01:01:41,930 --> 01:01:43,480
Has he gone mad?

1088
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:45,750
<i>My daughter...</i>

1089
01:01:46,950 --> 01:01:49,160
wants to have the baby.

1090
01:01:51,820 --> 01:01:54,070
During our last broadcast,

1091
01:01:54,070 --> 01:01:56,760
I stated abortions are immoral.

1092
01:01:58,290 --> 01:02:00,950
But after I found out about
my daughter's pregnancy,

1093
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:04,440
I advised her to get an abortion...

1094
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:08,990
even though she wanted
to keep the baby.

1095
01:02:08,990 --> 01:02:11,450
<i>In accordance to my statement,</i>

1096
01:02:11,450 --> 01:02:14,600
<i>I was being immoral.</i>

1097
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:17,220
<i>I know it was shameless,</i>

1098
01:02:17,220 --> 01:02:20,040
<i>and my actions weren't logical.</i>

1099
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:24,960
I was worried about
my young daughter's future,

1100
01:02:26,150 --> 01:02:28,360
and it felt very...

1101
01:02:30,010 --> 01:02:32,970
burdensome for me to bear.

1102
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:37,530
That is why I demanded
her of such a thing.

1103
01:02:39,290 --> 01:02:41,630
But my daughter's words...

1104
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:45,160
really moved my heart.

1105
01:02:48,410 --> 01:02:50,710
<i>She said she wanted to</i>

1106
01:02:50,710 --> 01:02:52,500
protect her baby...

1107
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:55,690
as her mom had done.

1108
01:02:58,610 --> 01:03:01,180
When her mom gave birth to her,

1109
01:03:01,180 --> 01:03:03,670
she didn't have me by her side.

1110
01:03:04,540 --> 01:03:06,640
<i>But her baby's dad...</i>

1111
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:08,940
<i>is by her side.</i>

1112
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:13,140
She knows she won't be
regretting her decision.

1113
01:03:17,950 --> 01:03:21,750
So I've made a decision to
respect my daughter's wishes.

1114
01:03:23,230 --> 01:03:25,130
And I'd like to say this...

1115
01:03:26,250 --> 01:03:28,680
to my daughter right now.

1116
01:03:31,420 --> 01:03:34,440
<i>Even though I wasn't
by your mom's side,</i>

1117
01:03:36,170 --> 01:03:38,110
I promise...

1118
01:03:38,110 --> 01:03:40,290
to stay by your side.

1119
01:03:43,710 --> 01:03:46,300
<i>- Isn't he amazing?
- I can't believe this.</i>

1120
01:03:46,300 --> 01:03:47,560
<i>My apologies.</i>

1121
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:50,120
<i>Wow, that's really great.</i>
