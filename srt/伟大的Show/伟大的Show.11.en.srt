Never mind.

183
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:17,600
What's that?

184
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,200
Oh, this...

185
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,250
I found it in the bookcase
while cleaning the study.

186
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:25,700
Do you remember what you
said when I gave this to you?

187
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:31,270
What did I say?

188
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,470
<i>I'll keep this with me always.</i>

189
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:37,870
<i>During hard times,
I'll look at this and pledge...</i>

190
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:40,180
<i>that I'll be a politician
who protects the people.</i>

191
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,780
Wie Dae Han,
"The Nation's Protector."

192
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,440
Let's go, fighting!

193
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:01,470
[ A divisive era, unified in politics ]

194
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:03,250
[ A divisive era, unified in politics ]

195
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,220
[ Assemblyman Baek Soo Chang:
 A divisive era, unified in politics ]

196
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:15,100
Divisiveness isn't
necessarily a bad thing.

197
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:18,950
Why would Chairman Baek host this
 on a weekday during the daytime?

198
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:20,750
How can we make advancements?

199
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,250
Why?

200
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:26,330
He wants to see who
are his loyal followers.

201
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:30,160
If Chairman Baek ousts you,
you'll be left in the cold.

202
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,880
Hey, let's take the easy way.

203
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,550
Okay? The easy way.

204
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:40,200
Hatred causes division
 to stand still.

205
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,960
I felt out the market
 retailers last night,

206
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,850
and they won't budge.

207
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:50,090
If a shopping mall gets built,
 they'll go kamikaze.

208
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:51,990
So you should sweet-talk them.

209
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:53,850
That's not as easy as it sounds.

210
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:55,920
They should build it elsewhere.

211
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,730
They should move the site...

212
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:11,770
Get your head on straight, punk.

213
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:15,590
The situation is so serious.
I'm about to lose my mind.

214
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:18,510
Woo's Distribution says
that's the best location.

215
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:20,260
What am I supposed to do?

216
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:22,370
Geez, I'm going crazy.

217
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:25,820
Of course, freedom and
equality are universal...

218
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,570
Director Lee is over there.

219
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:28,960
I'll try persuading him.

220
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,190
Hey, don't.

221
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:32,020
Don't. I said, stop.

222
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,650
Director Lee.

223
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:36,240
- Hello.
- Aigoo...

224
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,310
Good seeing you again.

225
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:39,480
Yes, Assemblyman Wie.

226
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,110
Seeing you again today,
 I feel twice as happy.

227
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:43,770
Yes, I know.

228
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:47,050
I feel a sense of closeness to you.

229
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:49,640
As if we've known each
other for 10 years.

230
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:54,240
Then the two of you can be
brothers starting today.

231
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,690
Shall we?

232
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:58,260
Please speak casually to me.
 I'm younger than you.

233
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:03,120
Actually, I had wanted to
run something by you.

234
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,170
This isn't the place.

235
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:07,690
Later. Do it later.

236
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:09,620
No, no, it's all right.

237
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:12,020
Our Dae Han has something to say.

238
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:14,860
It doesn't matter where
 we are, go ahead.

239
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,450
Aigoo, thank you.

240
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:25,210
Since you're a busy man,
 I'll get straight to the point.

241
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:29,190
The multi-purpose shopping mall
you're pursuing in Inju City.

242
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:32,270
What do you think about
 changing the location?

243
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:36,050
Why?

244
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:40,580
Well, I sought out advice from
a few Feng Shui experts.

245
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:43,060
They said the prison site
would be the

246
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:45,500
worst location for
 your shopping center.

247
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,120
The moment you open,
you could go out of business.

248
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,100
Totally.

249
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,900
I worried for you, Director Lee.

250
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:54,270
And also...

251
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:58,480
it's too close of a distance
to the Inju Market.

252
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,430
Since it concerns their livelihood,
they'll be very resistant.

253
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:06,160
Our Dae Han may know politics,

254
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,760
but not so much economics.

255
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,780
We made this decision
after evaluating

256
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:13,690
the site from all perspectives.

257
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:15,760
For us to give that up,

258
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,860
it'll be a threat to our
company's livelihood.

259
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,470
Well, then.

260
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:24,300
But Director Lee.

261
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:27,530
If you give me a little more time,
 I'll look further into this matter...

262
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:30,000
Do you consider the
market retailers

263
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,760
to be the only citizens?

264
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,630
To you, Assemblyman?

265
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,180
Hey, I'm not done looking.

266
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:04,480
Whatever. Are you studying it?

267
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,140
You're breaking the mood.

268
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:08,500
Anyway, this is really fun.

269
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,580
I know.

270
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:13,180
Han Da Jung, it'll be daebak
if you upload this as is.

271
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:16,480
Man, you guys.

272
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,480
You have a great eye for webtoons.

273
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,120
What's with them?

274
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,250
They're like her maidservants.

275
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,230
Hey!

276
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:28,860
Han Da Jung is an "insider" now.

277
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,820
You'll just standby and watch?

278
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:34,120
You "outsiders," don't be jealous.
Then you lose.

279
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:37,270
If it bugs, you guys
draw webtoons, too.

280
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,330
Look who's here!

281
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:46,440
Oh, Assemblyman Joo.

282
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,220
- Wow.
- Yes.

283
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:50,520
Assemblyman Joo,
it's been so long.

284
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,480
I know.

285
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,220
It's been over three years,

286
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,200
I haven't seen you since
 you lost the election.

287
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,980
You know him, right?
 Wie Dae Han, "The Nation's Dad."

288
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,560
Of course.

289
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:02,140
You're even more
 handsome in person.

290
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:04,490
Aigoo, please.

291
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:07,340
It's just that cameras can't
capture my good looks.

292
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:14,340
It's a joke.

293
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:18,150
I see you're still silly as ever.

294
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:22,050
I heard you got arrested for
 hitting someone recently.

295
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:26,560
As you know, I can't stand injustice.

296
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,360
Yes.

297
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,780
That's true. You do have a temper.

298
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:32,190
When he was an assemblyman,

299
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:34,720
he caused ruckus everywhere.

300
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,160
That's something all right.

301
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,510
We all know that
 newly-elects are nobodies.

302
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:39,650
I know.

303
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:42,850
Even re-elected assemblyman
 like me are on my toes.

304
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:46,150
Not sure if he's spirited
or immature...

305
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:51,140
We'll now take the
 commemorative photos.

306
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:53,770
All Jeonjin Party assemblymen,
please come to the podium.

307
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:54,720
Let's go.

308
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:01,050
Aigoo.

309
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:05,310
Why are you here?

310
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,110
Pardon?

311
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:10,000
You're not an
assemblyman anymore.

312
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:15,140
Chairman Baek, congratulations.

313
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:16,650
Hello, Assemblyman Joo.

314
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:18,250
Yes.

315
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:21,250
Come here, come up here.

316
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:32,450
Look at Joo Gwang Chun.

317
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:35,830
His parliamentary politics
 are in the gutter,

318
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:38,880
but Chairman Baek likes him,
 so he gets re-elected.

319
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,850
- Let's take the picture.
- Okay.

320
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:43,430
"To support the weaklings."

321
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:44,890
I love you, Chairman Baek!

322
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:46,140
One, two, three!

323
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,000
That's only possible
when you have power.

324
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:52,220
Team Leader Baek, fighting!

325
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:53,750
- One, two, three!
- Fighting!

326
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:00,270
I was elected as
our party's chairman.

327
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:02,530
You don't even call to
 congratulate me?

328
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:04,940
You have many who
will besides me.

329
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:08,260
I watched last night's broadcast.

330
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:10,720
Wie Dae Han gave it
 to you real good.

331
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,410
This arena is like that.

332
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:14,680
If they see an opening,
they barge right in.

333
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,670
Then they scratch and bite you.

334
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:19,480
If I fall for my opponent's tricks,

335
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,560
the chessboard will get messy.

336
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:24,970
Whether trick or strategy,
you lost to Wie Dae Han.

337
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:26,890
The adviser election.

338
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:29,660
The general election is
 a long ways off.

339
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:31,320
Aigoo...

340
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,690
You shouldn't be sitting pretty.

341
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:37,590
You're still wanting to
run without a party?

342
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,020
Yes.

343
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,750
I see.

344
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,820
Then officially...

345
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:48,170
resign from the party today.

346
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:50,920
Yes?

347
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:04,110
Am I interrupting
your conversation?

348
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:06,060
No, I'm glad you're here.

349
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,270
Have a seat.

350
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:14,270
If you'll talk marriage...

351
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:17,680
I can't marry someone who
has feelings for another.

352
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,160
I'm here...

353
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:22,810
to discuss the general
election with the chairman.

354
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,550
The general election?

355
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:27,710
Chairman Kang advised me.

356
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:30,130
To run in the general election as

357
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:32,930
DN Party's candidate
 for Central Inju City.

358
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:36,630
Just what are you thinking?

359
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:39,670
Our party should turn
over a new leaf.

360
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:43,760
And we'll need many
 talented young ladies.

361
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,960
You said you'll think it over.

362
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,590
Have you made a decision?

363
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,320
Yes, Chairman.

364
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,230
I lack in many areas,

365
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:54,840
but I'll do my best for the party.

366
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:09,040
Are you serious about
running in the election?

367
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,260
Of course, I'm serious.

368
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:14,250
Why all of a sudden?

369
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:17,760
I won't be able to climb any
 higher in my media career,

370
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,290
and my love life isn't
going the way I want.

371
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:24,080
When Chairman Kang
 made the suggestion,

372
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,230
I decided on a new challenge.

373
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:29,040
See you at the station.

374
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:43,700
Yes, Sunbae.

375
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:47,380
You seem totally fine.

376
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,800
Why wouldn't I be?

377
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:52,680
Wie Dae Han delivered a
knock-out punch last night.

378
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:55,190
I thought you might be banged up.

379
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:57,230
If you'll say stupid jokes,
 I'll get going.

380
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:59,540
If you leave right now,
you'll regret it.

381
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:02,470
You must repay Wie Dae Han
 for what he did.

382
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,430
What do you mean?

383
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:09,310
The proposed third Woo's Mall
location is making a stir, correct?

384
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,580
Since you're a reporter,
 I guess news travels fast.

385
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:15,780
And?

386
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,970
The man in charge of Woo's Mall

387
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:20,840
is Director Lee Kang Heon
of Woo's Distribution.

388
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:25,760
And he happens to be...

389
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:29,500
the nephew of Jeonjin
Party's Chairman

390
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:32,150
Baek Soo Chang. His nephew.

391
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:34,010
<i>Director Lee.</i>

392
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:35,540
<i>Chairman Baek.</i>

393
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:37,090
<i>Mayor Jung Han Soo.</i>

394
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:38,500
What do you think?

395
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,260
Can't you see the picture?

396
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:44,140
I thought it was strange
that Mayor Jung was

397
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:46,550
rushing the voting for
 the rental apartments.

398
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:49,810
That's common knowledge.
Everyone knows.

399
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:52,670
The juicy bits start now.

400
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:55,740
I was at Chairman Baek's book
 launch ceremony today.

401
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,950
<i>- Good seeing you again.
- Yes, it is.</i>

402
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:00,400
<i>Seeing you again today,
I feel twice as happy.</i>

403
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,360
<i>Yes, I know.</i>

404
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:05,230
<i>Director Lee of Woo's Distribution
 and Wie Dae Han...</i>

405
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:08,630
were engaging in
a friendly conversation.

406
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:17,140
Reporter Nam called.

407
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:20,460
He told Attorney Kang
as per your request.

408
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:24,640
"If I fall for my opponent's tricks,
 the chessboard will get messy."

409
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:28,420
Chessboards are
supposed to get messy.

410
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:36,550
Of course, the market
retailers will oppose.

411
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:39,730
But nine out of ten area's residents

412
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:42,350
will welcome Woo's Mall
with open arms.

413
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:50,350
I know what Inju Market
means to you, but...

414
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:52,610
Assemblyman.

415
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:56,340
Let's turn a blind eye just once.

416
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:58,610

417

The finish line is near.
How can we stop?

418
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:04,690
I...

419
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:06,700
can't stop.

420
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:09,510
Then you'll persuade
 the retailers?

421
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:10,810
I must.

422
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:12,800
What's politics anyway?

423
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:16,070
The art of mediating
between conflicts, isn't it?

424
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:17,540

He's running for the market

I think he's entering

Well, we don't know that.

440

Woo's Mall is getting built here.

450
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:52,010
That's the rumor,
but it's not for sure yet.

451
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:52,910
What do you mean?

452
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:55,070
I heard from my investor friends.

453
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:56,300
It's been confirmed.

454
00:24:56,300 --> 00:25:00,210
You should've notified me
 of such rumors ahead.

455
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:01,120
Why should I?

456
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,020
Had I known, I would've purchased
an apartment in the area.

457
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:07,920
Woo's Mall will make the
housing prices jump! Man...

Gosh, Producer Koo has quite a talent.

459
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:12,750
What talent?

460
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:14,450
A talent for pissing people off!

461
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:17,110
She's right, she's right.

462
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:18,620

Even though I wasn't elected,

480
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:08,800
I'll strive to make an effort

481
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:12,570
for the advancement
 of Inju Market.

482
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:22,380
Yes, up next is our star of the day.

484

and a soon-to-be grandfather.

485
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:32,640
We'll now hear from our

486
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:36,350

491
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:53,590

all elected me...

as your adviser.

493
00:26:55,780 --> 00:27:00,640
That's why my heart
 feels burdened.

494
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:04,670

 getting built swirled around,

495
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:07,020
you must've been quite worried.

496
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:11,370

497
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:13,250
those rumors...

498
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,890
are true.

<i>- So it is true!

Who did you hear it from?

501
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:23,240
<i>- We're in trouble.
- What can we do here?</i>

502
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,220
<i>- Is this for real?
- It can't be.</i>

503
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:30,030
<i>- Assemblyman Wie.
- What's going on?</i>

504
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:32,570
Hey, why are you on your knees?

505
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:34,620
You elected me to
stop Woo's Mall.

506
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:37,480
Yes, we did, but why
 get on your knees...

507
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,900
But that's...

508
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,470
not something I'm able to stop.

509
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:44,670
I'm sorry.

510
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:47,150
<i>- You've got to be kidding me.
- What on earth?</i>

511
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:49,540
<i>- So we're helpless?
- Nothing we can do?</i>

512
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:51,300
<i>- What do we do now?
- Say something.</i>

513

514

I don't know what he's up to.

520
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:10,700
He's gotten worse after
 Dad left. I'm worried.

521
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:14,970
Gosh, I wish Sunbae could
pay more attention to him.

522
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:18,270
If he becomes the adviser,
he'll be busier, right?

523
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,450
Yes, probably so.

524
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:24,910

is torturing people, right?

536
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:00,600
approximately 10%
of the prison site

537
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,330
overlaps into the 1km
 radius of Inju Market.

538
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:05,050
Well, then...

539
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:06,660
Legally speaking,

540
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:09,310
Woo's Mall can't be built
 on the prison site.

541
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:10,700
Correct.

542
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:15,350
However, if Woo's Distribution
 forfeits this 10%,

543
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,950
then Woo's Mall can be built

544
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:19,990
even without your consent.

545
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:21,590
<i>What the heck?</i>

546
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:24,150
<i>This is nonsense!</i>

547
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:25,310
So...

548
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:27,370
what can we do here?

549
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:30,030
We can't just sit and do nothing.

550
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:31,900
Of course not.

551
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,440
So...

552
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,500
I was thinking this over...

553
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,210
Everyone.

554
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:39,210
Woo's Distribution will

555
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:42,880
want to utilize the entire
prison site for their mall.

556
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,540
What do you think of
conceding this 10%...

557
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:49,240
and receive the
maximum compensation?

558
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,280
<i>Compensation, my foot!</i>

559
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,090
<i>No way, absolute rubbish!</i>

560
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:56,260
We haven't even fought back.

561
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:58,130
Why bring up
compensation already?

562
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:00,200
Look at Gwangcheon
Mangwon Market.

563
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:03,260
Even after protests,
they still built malls.

564
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:05,900
The prison site is nearby.

565
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,960
Will we follow suit and be
ruined like the others?

566
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,660
It's a losing battle!

567
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:11,990
We should at least
get a lot of money!

568
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:16,350
Settle down!

569
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,820
In your opinion,

570
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:21,690
how much do you think
they'll pay up?

571
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:27,210
I can't confirm on the
exact amount yet,

572
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:29,190
but I'll request the maximum...

573
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:33,170
I don't care how much
 we get. I oppose.

574
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:36,540
This place is like our home,

575
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:38,390
and our offspring.

576
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:39,940
What parent would

577
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:42,070
sell their offspring
for some bucks?

578
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:43,920
I will not stand for it!

579
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:46,680
<i>- Offspring? What the heck?
- Are you crazy?</i>

580
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:01,670
Wie Dae Han!

581
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:11,310
The confirmation on Woo's mall.

582
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:13,020
You really found out today?

583
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:15,670
Are you saying...

584
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:17,840
I'm lying or something?

585
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,220
Who knows.

586
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:27,140
Father.

587
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:30,730
I completely understand
how you feel, but

588
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:33,250
you must stay rational
at times like this.

589
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:34,840
Getting a payout.

590
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:37,180
That's your idea of being "rational"?

591
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:40,320
I'll make sure we get the maximum
 payout for compensation...

592
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,510
Once Woo's Mall gets built,

593
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:44,660
some retailers will
go out of business,

594
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:47,170
and small businesses
in the vicinity will suffer.

595
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:50,010
The compensation isn't
enough to satisfy anyone!

596
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:51,330
Father.

597
00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:53,860
If we keep opposing and resisting,

598
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:57,240
they'll just concede that
 10% of the land and proceed.

599
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,810
If that's the case,
forget any compensation!

600
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:01,050
Forget it.

601
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:04,440

He's having a fit, of course.

613

Is there another way besides
receiving compensation?

614
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:41,750
If there were, I wouldn't
be so frustrated.

cause an incident.

619
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:57,110

00:46:29,470 --> 00:46:31,780
To make a parking lot
next to the market

895
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:33,950
and to remodel completely,

896
00:46:33,950 --> 00:46:37,030
we have to receive
that amount. Okay?

897
00:46:37,030 --> 00:46:38,260
<i>Yes, I understand.</i>

898
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:41,430
If we don't do that for the retailers,

899
00:46:41,430 --> 00:46:43,760
you and I are both sons of b****es.

900
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:44,730
You know, right?

901
00:46:44,730 --> 00:46:46,050
Hey, you sound drunk.

902
00:46:46,050 --> 00:46:47,670
Stop drinking and go home.

903
00:46:47,670 --> 00:46:49,210
Yes, sir.

904
00:46:49,210 --> 00:46:50,890
Hyungnim.

905
00:46:50,890 --> 00:46:52,440
I trust you.

906
00:46:59,090 --> 00:47:01,600
How did Mayor Jung know ahead?

907
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:02,640
About what?

908
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,660
Voting on the rental apartments.

909
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:06,090
That it'd be thrown out.

910
00:47:06,150 --> 00:47:09,650
He probably checked the public
 opinion discreetly beforehand.

911
00:47:13,690 --> 00:47:15,680
Sunbae, talk to you later.

912
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:20,200
You've been drinking.

913
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:23,440
Yup.

914
00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:27,910
And I'm not in the mood today.

915
00:47:27,910 --> 00:47:29,850
Just go on your way.

916
00:47:29,850 --> 00:47:32,810
I'm not sure why you
 wanted the adviser position.

917
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:38,790
But since you're elected,
do a good job.

918
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:46,450
Kang Joon Ho.

919
00:47:46,450 --> 00:47:49,800
You think you're all that, huh?

920
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:52,880
But you're nothing
without your papa.

921
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:54,140
You know that?

922
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:55,770
What are you talking about?

923
00:47:55,770 --> 00:47:56,690
Hey.

924
00:47:56,690 --> 00:47:59,820
Have you ever accomplished
anything without your dad's help?

925
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:01,380
Have you? Huh?

926
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:02,980
You're born with a silver spoon.

927
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:05,280
You don't know what hardship is.

928
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:06,940
You're drunk. Go home.

929
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:08,020
Nope.

930
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:10,620
While I'm at it, I'll state more facts.

931
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:11,780
I said, stop.

932
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:16,420
You moving here.

933
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:19,960
To me, it seems like you left home
to spice up your love life.

934
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:21,840
Being a belligerent
drunk at our age...

935
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:24,730
is not cute.

936
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:30,520
You'll run without a party, huh?

937
00:48:31,870 --> 00:48:34,650
Wow, that's great for me!

938
00:48:34,650 --> 00:48:38,940
Without your dad's help,
you'll be an easy foe.

939
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:40,850
Man, seriously. Hey.

940
00:48:40,850 --> 00:48:43,930
Do you actually think
your dad will let you be?

941
00:48:43,930 --> 00:48:46,250
You're like a helpless child.

942
00:48:46,250 --> 00:48:47,220
A baby.

943
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:49,350
Kang Joon Ho, a baby.

944
00:48:49,350 --> 00:48:51,200
Huh? Baby.

945
00:48:55,790 --> 00:48:57,520
Are you sober now?

946
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:01,760
Wow...

947
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:06,320
Kang Joon Ho is hitting someone.

948
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:07,390
Whoa...

949
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:11,110
Wow. Fine.

950
00:49:11,110 --> 00:49:14,390
All right, good, good.

951
00:49:14,390 --> 00:49:17,440
You should at least have
 guts to go up against me.

952
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:18,420
Right.

953
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:19,900
But...

954
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:22,540
you mark my words, got it?

955
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:25,000
What you did today.

956
00:49:25,350 --> 00:49:26,650
This.

957
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:30,990
I'll repay you during the
general election.

958
00:49:30,990 --> 00:49:32,560
Okay?

959
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:41,570
Okay, I'm off.

960
00:49:55,930 --> 00:49:58,170
We can leave now.

961
00:49:58,170 --> 00:50:01,100
You won't stop by
Attorney Kang's place?

962
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:02,700
Why?

963
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:06,430
Wie Dae Han did my job for me.

964
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:21,020
Aigoo...

965
00:50:25,810 --> 00:50:27,100
Fine.

966
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:31,260
Let's keep marching ahead.

967
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:38,890
If we resist signing the agreement,

968
00:50:38,890 --> 00:50:40,550
what will happen?

969
00:50:40,550 --> 00:50:44,100
Well, that will put
Woo's Distribution in a bind.

970
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:46,470
The city will push for adjustments.

971
00:50:46,470 --> 00:50:47,930
So...

972
00:50:47,930 --> 00:50:51,430
we'll really receive 4 billion won
for compensation?

973
00:50:51,430 --> 00:50:52,700
Of course.

974
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:55,540
Trust me, no need to worry. Yes.

975
00:50:59,050 --> 00:51:01,350
He's at it alone again.

976
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:12,980
Hello!

977
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:14,380
<i>Attorney Kang is here.</i>

978
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:16,240
<i>- Hello.
- How are you?</i>

979
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:17,980
What are you doing here?

980
00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:20,030
Vice President wanted
 a legal counsel.

981
00:51:20,050 --> 00:51:23,050
Having an attorney by
 our side is reassuring.

982
00:51:23,050 --> 00:51:23,950
I see.

983
00:51:23,950 --> 00:51:25,950
- It's okay, right?
- Of course, yes.

984
00:51:25,990 --> 00:51:29,460
Anyhow, thank you
both in advance.

985
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:32,270
The president is
struggling by himself.

986
00:51:32,270 --> 00:51:34,110
Let's wrap up the negotiations well.

987
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:36,570
Let's go.

988
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:46,030
We'll now commence the

989
00:51:46,030 --> 00:51:48,230
negotiations between
Woo's Distribution

990
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:50,770
and Inju Market retailers.

991
00:51:50,770 --> 00:51:53,650
First, the opening statement
from Inju City's mayor.

992
00:51:53,650 --> 00:51:56,050
Thank you for taking the time today.

993
00:51:56,850 --> 00:51:59,950
I do not believe traditional
markets and shopping centers

994
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:02,350
should be at odds with each other.

995
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:04,940
If we come to an agreement
 with an open mind,

996
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:07,840
I believe we can co-exist together.

997
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:12,050
We'll first hear from
 the market's side.

998
00:52:12,050 --> 00:52:13,930
Yes.

999
00:52:13,930 --> 00:52:17,090
Leading up to today's meeting,

1000
00:52:17,090 --> 00:52:19,950
we faced strong opposition
 from retailers,

1001
00:52:19,950 --> 00:52:22,260
and many difficulties.

1002
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:24,550
<i>Truthfully, as we speak,</i>

1003
00:52:24,550 --> 00:52:27,660
<i>the president of the retailers
association is holding a protest.</i>

1004
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:29,750
Yes, we're aware of it.

1005
00:52:29,750 --> 00:52:31,200
Thank you for...

1006
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:34,840
joining us today and for
opening up your hearts to us.

1007
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:37,120
If Woo's Mall gets built
on the prison site,

1008
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:39,980
we'll be suffering the
consequences on our end.

1009
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:44,050
We're requesting proper
compensation regarding that.

1010
00:52:44,050 --> 00:52:45,950
Yes. Of course, you should.

1011
00:52:47,050 --> 00:52:48,850
Give them what we've prepared.

1012
00:52:57,140 --> 00:52:59,070
[ Market revitalization
negotiation agreement ]

1013
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:04,300
- You look it over on my behalf.
- Yes, sir.

1014
00:53:06,350 --> 00:53:08,950
[ The agreement between Woo's Distribution
 and Inju market as follows ]

1015
00:53:08,950 --> 00:53:10,550
[ Compensation Amount:
200 million won ]

1016
00:53:12,930 --> 00:53:15,020
[ Compensation Amount:
 200 million won ]

1017
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:25,690
What is this? Compensation...

1018
00:53:25,690 --> 00:53:27,890
Is this the correct amount?

1019
00:53:27,890 --> 00:53:30,750
It may not be a satisfactory amount,

1020
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:32,810
but it's the best we can do.

1021
00:53:32,810 --> 00:53:34,320
Is this a joke?

1022
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:36,890
200 million won?

1023
00:53:36,890 --> 00:53:39,450
<i>- What?
- 200 million won?</i>

1024
00:53:39,450 --> 00:53:41,160
<i>Not what we were told!</i>

1025
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:42,340
Mayor Jung!

1026
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:45,230
The parking lot and the sunroof is
unthinkable with this amount!

1027
00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:50,980
Now, now, please, please, please.

1028
00:53:50,980 --> 00:53:52,860
Everyone, please calm down.

1029
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:54,520
Let's talk this out calmly.

1030
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:56,610
Rome wasn't built in
 a day, you know.

1031
00:53:56,610 --> 00:53:59,060
They screw us right off
the bat. What talk?

1032
00:53:59,060 --> 00:54:00,670
How can we talk?

1033
00:54:00,670 --> 00:54:03,160
This is wrong! This can't be!

1034
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:04,900
Co-exist? My foot.

1035
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:07,570
Man, no need to even
 listen anymore!

1036
00:54:07,650 --> 00:54:11,850
Mayor Jung, you came as
 their representative today.

1037
00:54:11,870 --> 00:54:13,620
It's a misunderstanding.

1038
00:54:13,620 --> 00:54:15,490
Everyone here knows.

1039
00:54:15,490 --> 00:54:19,960
I made a supreme effort to bring in
the rental apartments on the prison site.

1040
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:21,300
Now, now.

1041
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:23,020
Please sit back down,

1042
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:24,560
and let's continue.

1043
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:27,310
<i>- Let's sit for now.
- Fine.</i>

1044
00:54:27,310 --> 00:54:30,800
That was a ploy to
 squelch any opposition

1045
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,640
regarding Woo's Mall.

1046
00:54:33,650 --> 00:54:36,550
- Isn't that right?
- What do you mean by that?

1047
00:54:36,550 --> 00:54:39,620
I heard Director Lee's uncle...

1048
00:54:39,620 --> 00:54:43,030
is Jeonjin Party's
Chairman Baek Soo Chang.

1049
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:46,150
Mayor, you're also
 in the Jeonjin Party.

1050
00:54:48,630 --> 00:54:49,870
And?

1051
00:54:49,870 --> 00:54:52,870
Therefore, I had reasonable doubts.

1052
00:54:52,870 --> 00:54:55,560
Director Lee and
Mayor Jung teamed up

1053
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:58,910
to plan the Woo's Mall
project from the start.

1054
00:54:58,910 --> 00:55:01,260
Since Inju Market is
close in proximity,

1055
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:04,520
and to appease the market
 retailers' opposition,

1056
00:55:04,550 --> 00:55:05,950
perhaps...

1057
00:55:08,650 --> 00:55:12,800
you planted someone
among the retailers.

1058
00:55:15,140 --> 00:55:16,810
Attorney Kang.

1059
00:55:16,810 --> 00:55:18,760
You must know your statement

1060
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:21,920
aligns with falsification
and defamation, correct?

1061
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:24,490
To ramble on like that,
you need evidence.

1062
00:55:24,490 --> 00:55:25,640
The evidence.

1063
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:29,250
Unfortunately, it's circumstantial
and not physical.

1064
00:55:30,350 --> 00:55:31,660
However,

1065
00:55:31,660 --> 00:55:35,590
a confession will carry equal weight as evidence.

1066
00:55:35,590 --> 00:55:37,680
Assemblyman Wie stated

1067
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:39,620
he found out about
Woo's Mall confirmation

1068
00:55:39,620 --> 00:55:42,370
the day he was elected
 as an adviser.

1069
00:55:42,370 --> 00:55:44,830
<i>The confirmation on Woo's mall. </i>

1070
00:55:44,830 --> 00:55:46,170
<i>You really found out today?</i>

1071
00:55:46,170 --> 00:55:48,040
<i>As if I'd lie?</i>

1072
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:51,890
At Jeonjin Party Chairman Baek's

- Shut up and get lost!</i>

1248
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:32,490
<i>Everyone, please stop.</i>

1249
01:07:32,490 --> 01:07:33,600
<i>Let's go.</i>

1250
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:35,550
<i>To clean up all the garbage,</i>

1251
01:07:35,550 --> 01:07:37,530
<i>I'll have to run around myself.</i>

1252
01:07:37,530 --> 01:07:40,440
<i>If you dig deeper, my father
 could be incriminated.</i>

1253
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:41,780
<i>Why give me this information?</i>

1254
01:07:41,780 --> 01:07:43,060
<i>I want to trust you.</i>

1255
01:07:43,060 --> 01:07:44,540
<i>You should pay for your sins.</i>

1256
01:07:44,540 --> 01:07:49,200
♫ <i>It's still nice to be together</i> ♫
