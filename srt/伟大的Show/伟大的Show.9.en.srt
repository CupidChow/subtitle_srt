All right...

4
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:26,750
Well, let's hear what this is about.

5
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:31,600
You're back after abandoning
your kids for two years.

6
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,210
What kind of ugly behavior is this?

7
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:34,370
Ugly behavior?

8
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:36,150
Then what else is this?

9
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:39,980
Tae Poong and Song Yi cried their eyes
out since you disappeared on them again!

10

What are you trying to pull?

11
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,400
What the heck are you trying to pull?

12
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,170
I'm doing your job right now!

13
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:57,480
So why the heck would you do that?

14
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,760
You have no blood relations
 to Da Jung at all!

15
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,170
What...

16
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,500
What are you trying to say?

17
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:25,350
When I interrogate the bad guys,

18
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:27,770
they're all the same.

19
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:31,720
They all deny it at first.

20
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,770
It'll all come to light anyway.

21
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,160
I don't know where
you've heard and what...

22
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,450
What do you mean from where?

23
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:48,800
From Da Jung's mom, who else?

24
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,260
Sun Mi said that...

25
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:54,950
Da Jung's father is dead.

26
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,200
What's your deal?

27

What to do here?

29
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,250
Should I bury it or expose
it to the press?

30
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:27,940
Yes.

31
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,850
You're right.

32
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:34,370
Da Jung is not my
 biological daughter.

33
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:37,550
But she believed me
to be her father.

34
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:41,070
She had no parents but with
three younger siblings.

35
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:43,410
I could not kick her out.

36
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:49,700
Do you think I'm an idiot? S***...

37
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:53,940
If you had such pure intentions,

38
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:58,160
why did you lie that you're
 the biological father?

39
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,330
- Well, that's...
- Whatever.

40
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:07,290
I'm not interested as to
what your intentions are.

41
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,930
What's important is...

42
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:15,110
that you scammed the entire nation.

43
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:26,580
And?

44
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:29,940

If you give me that money,

48
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,670

And I'll disappear quietly.

52
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,060
Isn't that the best for me,
 the kids, and you?

53
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,340
Honestly,

54
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:14,410
I want him to go away asap.

55
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:18,530
But he's your siblings' biological dad.

56
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:21,420
He's no dad, really.

57
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:25,510
After he got here, the kids
are having a harder time.

58
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,330
Then...

59
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:32,270
you want Sunbae to be
your siblings' dad, too?

60
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:34,740
Yes.

61
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,780
That'd be the best for my siblings.

62
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:40,380
I'm really shameless, huh?

63
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,990
No.

64
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:46,160
It takes courage to ask for
 help during hardships.

65

You're doing the right thing.

66
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:51,080

ask Sunbae or me for help.

you're finished.

 biological father or not,

he should be thanking you
 for taking care of the kids.

96
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:20,770
How could he demand money?

97
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:24,850

What do you really
think I should do?

Just get down on your knees,

and beg. You don't
have the money,

 for the kids.

103

He wants 30 million won for
 his kids. That wouldn't work.

It's common in junior

They all take turns hurling
 insults at the target victim.

240
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,900
The chatroom is like
 a torture chamber.

241
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:50,810
Then can't you just
 leave the chatroom?

242
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:51,980
If you do, they re-invite you.

243
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:53,750
If you leave again,
 they re-invite you again.

244

It's like pouring water
 into a broken pot.

358
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:01,510
I know. I know, but...

359
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:05,100
I don't see any other way.
I'm at a loss.

360
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:08,220
If Han Dong Nam exposes this,
it's over for the kids and me.

361
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,330
Then who'll take care of them?

362
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:11,810
Seriously,

363
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:13,620
you shouldn't worry
 about the kids right now.

364
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:16,910
Get your head on straight,
strengthen your resolve,

365
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:20,500
and think of what will be
beneficial to you right now.

366
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:28,970
One million won?

367
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:32,120
Why the heck is he
withdrawing one million won?

368
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:37,010
Maybe he's off gambling somewhere.

369
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:41,020
Man, I'm going crazy here.

370
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:43,680
Wait, Song Yi.

371
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:46,550
Hey, I have to run.
I'll see you later, okay?

372
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,320
30.

373
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,160
I'm in.

374
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:12,230
Since you were MIA,
I thought you quit gambling.

375
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:15,740
I was in Vietnam.

376
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:18,140
A friend of mine has
a business there.

377
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:20,510
Vietnam is good.

378
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:22,310
I guess you made some money.

379
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:24,570
D***it...

380
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:26,950
Hey.

381
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,510
The police! Stop what you're doing!

382
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:36,220
<i>- My God!
- Run, it's the police!</i>

383
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:38,610
Everyone, freeze!

384
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:40,540
Stay still, stay still.

385
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:41,570
Hey!

386
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:44,590
Prohibit everyone from leaving.

387
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:53,520
How is Song Yi?

388
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:54,850
Her temperature is normal.

389
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:57,150
When she finishes the IV,
she can go home.

390
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:00,350
What a relief. Thank you.

391
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:14,140

We were looking for you.</i>

393
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,390
<i>I thought it was Daddy,
so I followed him...</i>

394
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:27,520
<i>but it was someone else.</i>

395
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,370
<i>I couldn't find you either, Ahjussi.</i>

396
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:32,000
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

397
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,260
Daddy...

398
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:41,200
Hey, Song Yi.

399
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,540
It's Ahjussi.

400
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:43,870
Are you feeling okay?

401
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:56,040
[ Tak's homeroom teacher ]

402
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,420
Excuse me for a minute.

403
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:59,100
Ahjussi.

404
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:02,420
Can't you answer the phone here?

405
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:06,830
Okay, hang on.

406
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:10,500
Yes, Ms. Yes, hello.

407
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,210
<i>Hello, sir.</i>

408
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:13,520
<i>I'm calling because</i>

409
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,430
<i> the violence prevention
committee made their decision.</i>

410
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:18,610
I see. What did they decide?

411
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:21,120
They assigned 20 hours
of community service.

412
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,880
I'm glad he won't be transferred.

413
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:26,330
That's great.

414
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:27,940
Thank you.

415
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:30,510
Thank you so much.

416
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:32,710
<i>Not only this incident,</i>

417
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:36,350
<i>but Tak doesn't get along
with his classmates.</i>

418
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:39,750
<i>I'm hoping you could pay
more attention to him.</i>

419
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:41,380
Ahjussi,

420
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:42,890
you can put me down.

421
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:45,070
I can walk.

422
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:47,420
Why? Are you uncomfortable?

423
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:49,720
That's not it...

424
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,420
I don't want to tire you out.

425
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:55,510
It's all right. I'm not tired at all.

426
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:58,420
Ahjussi.

427
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:00,890
I said I'm totally fine.

428
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:03,330
That's not it...

429
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:05,120
I'm hungry.

430
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,210
Huh?

431
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:07,450
You're hungry?

432
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:09,130
Well, we can't have that.

433
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:11,170
Let's go eat something. Let's go!

434
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:12,730
Let's go!

435
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:20,190
Say, ah.

436
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:21,300
All right.

437
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,690
I can eat on my own.

438
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:25,050
You can?

439
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:27,220
Okay then, here.

440
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:29,810
I'll put some in here.

441
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:31,350
Okay.

442
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:34,490
- Blow on it and eat slowly, okay?
- Okay.

443
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:36,710
All right, here.

444
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:39,080
It's hot, so eat slowly.

445
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:47,770
Song Yi, how do you like
 living with me?

446
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:49,800
- I like it.
- Really?

447
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:53,630
But please don't tell
Dad that I said

448
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:55,440
I like living with you.

449
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,540
Why not?

450
00:24:56,540 --> 00:25:00,600
Because if he finds out,
he won't be happy.

451
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:05,230
Okay.

452
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:10,840
Aigoo.

453
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:12,050
It's still hot, huh?

454
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:14,250
Aigoo, it's not cooled down yet.

455
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:17,650
Song Yi, while the
porridge cools down,

456
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:20,050
- how about a nonsense quiz?
- Yes.

457
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:22,970
All right then. Guess the answer.

458
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:26,200
What's a hospital ward for monks?

459
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,270
The ICU. (sounds like monks)

460
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:29,100
Wow, correct answer.

461
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:30,850
Now the second one.

462
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:34,050
What's the opposite of Incheon
front shore? (sounds like daddy)

463
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:35,560
It's Incheon mommy.

464
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:38,780
Whoa, correct answer.
Wow, you're good.

465
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:41,150
You won't get this
one though. Okay.

466
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,440
How do you say
"apology letter" in English?

467
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,210
Global. (sounds like
a "punishment by writing")

468
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,080
Song Yi, you know everything!

469
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,530
You're a smarty-pants, huh?

470
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:50,580
It's my turn now.

471
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:51,920
All righty, I'll get them all.

472
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,980
I've been studying up
on the nonsense quiz.

473
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:55,050
Okay, go ahead.

474
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:57,540
What's the opposite of
a classroom election?

475
00:25:57,540 --> 00:26:00,220
The opposite of
a classroom election...

476
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:01,950
The opposite of
a classroom election.

477
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:04,950
- It's the class vice president election.
- Wrong.

478
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:07,650
The answer is "the president lying down."
(election sounds like "standing up")

479
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:10,040
The president lying down...

480
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,790
The opposite of standing
up is lying down.

481
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:15,710
You're right.

482
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:18,150
Aigoo, I didn't know that one.

483
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:20,350
Song Yi, you're a genius.

484
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:28,880
Thank God the wound
wasn't very deep.

485
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:32,050
Since I'm still alive,

486
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:34,600
I guess I should continue working.

487
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,910
Thanks for your concern.

488
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:38,940
No need to thank me. I'm a
doctor treating his patient.

489
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:41,340
Well then, please enjoy your visit.

490
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:43,040
- Thank you.
- Yes.

491
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,920
I was shocked when
 I heard the news.

492
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,280
It's a contusion,

493
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,410
so you must receive treatments.

494
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:57,870
I'll visit you every day.

495
00:26:57,870 --> 00:26:59,840
Aigoo, don't bother with that.

496
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:00,770
It's all right.

497
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:05,010
This is why we shouldn't have
rental apartments in our town.

498
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:06,500
Why not?

499
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,670
Look at your dad.
How can you ask that?

500
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:12,720
If that gets built, we'll be swarmed
with the likes of that punk.

501

The young people who are
disgruntled with our society.

502
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:17,570
That's completely off base.

503
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:20,900
If that's the case, I should
 live far away, too.

504
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,850
Since I'm disgruntled
 with our society.

505
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:26,350
Look at him talk.

506
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:32,550
Where did Daddy go?

507
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:34,250
Huh?

508
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:40,540
I'm not sure, either.

509
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:42,780
I have something to
brag to him about.

510
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:45,460
About what?

511
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:49,580
My teacher said I did well
with my presentation today.

512
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:51,140
What presentation?

513
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:53,570
My future dreams in front
of the entire class.

514
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:54,940
Aigoo, you did?

515
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,620
What did you say?

516
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:58,670
An assemblyman!

517
00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:00,060
An assemblyman?

518

Tae Poong, you want to
be an assemblyman?

519
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:06,410
Yes! I want to be a cool
assemblyman like you.

520
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:10,820
Seriously, do I seem cool to you?

521
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:13,120
Yes! You're on TV shows,

522
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,710
we did shoulder rides
at the amusement park,

523
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:18,090
and you rescued me
 like the "Iron Man."

524

00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,560
<i>It's the Inju Police Department.</i>

537
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,800
<i>Does Han Dong Nam live with you?</i>

538
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,040
Please drive carefully.

539
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,430
You'll cause an accident.

540
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:03,130
They say misfortune
 follows the unlucky ones.

541
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:06,060
I'm sorry about this.

542
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:08,460
They'll issue a fine for
summary indictment.

543
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:10,430
It won't be much, so don't worry.

544
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:12,480
And you call yourself a dad?

545
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,250
What?

546
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:14,980
You left your sick child
and ran off to gamble!

547
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:15,860
You're no dad!

548
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:17,900
The nurse said she's better,

549
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:19,350
so I came outside for a bit.

550
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:23,550
You're using my precious
 kids to put on a show.

551
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:24,990
You shouldn't talk.

552
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:26,180
That's right.

553
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:28,280
They are precious.

554
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,990
So how could you
abandon them like that?

555
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:32,050
Oh, my.

556
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:34,790
People are applauding,

557
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:37,450
so you must think
you're really a good dad.

558
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:40,380
But in the end, both you and I

559
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:43,430
are scumbags who use their kids.

560
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,090
Since your circumstances
 are better than mine,

561
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:50,410
keep up "The Nation's Dad" act.

562
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:52,160
It's a mutual win-win.

563
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,080
What's your problem?

564
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:58,400
Okay, fine.

565
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,270
I'm not a good guy either,

566
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:02,420
but I'm better than you.

567
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:04,310
I'll take your place.

568
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:05,510
The kids' dad.

569
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:09,390
You made the right call.

570
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:11,390
Let me ask you one question.

571
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:12,940
Ask away.

572
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:15,620
What will you do when
you run out of money?

573
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:18,730
You can't guarantee you
 won't do this again.

574
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:24,600
I know I'm a scumbag, but...

575
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:28,190
I can't use my kids to
barter for money again.

576
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:30,070
Don't you worry.

577
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:32,370
Just get the money ready.

578
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:37,850
The bank is closed.

579
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:40,350
I'll give it to you tomorrow.

580
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:44,000
Then I'll disappear tomorrow as well.

581
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:48,750
This is your last night with the kids.

582
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:51,850
You should say a proper goodbye.

583
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:05,140
Daddy, when will you be
 back from Vietnam?

584
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:06,400
When?

585
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:11,190
After about 100 days or so.

586
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:17,300
No, I can't count to a hundred yet.

587
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,250
Hey, Han Tak.

588
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:22,400
Punk, I'm leaving tomorrow,

589
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:25,280
and you're only staring
at your phone?

590
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,370
What happened with the
violence prevention committee?

591
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:34,180
I got community service.

592
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:37,640
Right, punk. You shouldn't have
 stabbed your friend's thigh.

593
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:42,110
I know what Tak did was wrong,

594
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:44,420
but we don't know when
we'll see you again.

595
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,980
Can't you speak nicely to him?

596
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:48,660
You're taking after your own dad.

597
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:50,430
Lecturing me and all.

598
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:56,960
Sorry if I offended you.

599
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,490
Hello.

600
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:14,400
I see many of you joined us today.

601
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,340
Aigoo, "Sohwak Bro."

602
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:17,720
It's your first time?

603
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,530
Why, hello. Hope to see you more.

604
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:23,460
Boss, please serve the chicken first.

605
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:26,400
Hey, who's this?
"Tae Jung Tae Sae Beyonce."

606
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,320
You're here again.

607
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:29,320
- Boss...
- How are you?

608
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:33,090
<i>Jinjin Naja, what did you say?</i>

609
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:36,740
<i>Oh, I shouldn't put
my face this close?</i>

610
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:38,160
It's too much, huh?

611
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:40,350
I'm sorry.

612
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:43,030
What can we do?
 I was born this way.

613
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:44,350
But there is an upside.

614
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:45,790
In group pictures,

615
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:47,140
I totally stand out!

616
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:48,660
Hey, you!

617
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:50,480
I said, serve the chicken first.

618
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,190
The chicken, the chicken!

619
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:55,720
We're live right now.
Why are you yelling like that?

620
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,860
That woman, really.

621
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:59,080
Anyway, I'll see you in a bit.

622
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:04,610
Aigoo, I hope you enjoy.

623
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:06,770
You watch our broadcast, right?

624
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:08,160
Dig in, dig in.

625
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:15,630
Luckily, Assemblyman Kang's
wound wasn't too deep.

626
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:17,170
Yeah.

627
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:21,650
Sunbae, is something
on your mind?

628
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:23,320
Why the long face?

629
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:29,460
It's not me, I'm worried
about the kids.

630
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:31,620
Their dad is leaving tomorrow.

631
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:34,980
So is he really going to Vietnam?

632
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:38,960
That's what he says, so it must be.

633
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,560
Aigoo, I don't know about this.

634
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:44,120
I'm sorry to say this about that man,

635
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:46,260
but I don't believe him.

636
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:50,340
I want the kids to continue
 living with you, Sunbae.

637
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:52,780
Da Jung wants that, too.

638
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,460
Da Jung said that?

639
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:58,970
Yes.

640
00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:02,700
That living with you would
 be best for her siblings.

641
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:07,110
I'm glad they don't
 hate me, at least.

642
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:12,490
Even though their dad is leaving,

643
00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:15,300
what do you think of
Da Jung staying with me?

644
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:17,140
And you take in Jung Woo.

645
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:21,250
Well, that works for me, but

646
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:22,730
will you be okay?

647
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:23,680
Yes.

648
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,990
After spending a few days
with Da Jung,

649
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:27,150
it was good for me, too.

650
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:29,340
- I felt less lonely.
- I see.

651
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:34,330
You're an only child,
so you must've been lonely.

652
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:37,570
I'm also an only child,
so I understand.

653
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,490
What's this?

654
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:19,460
It's your spending money.

655
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:21,270
Save it for emergencies.

656
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:22,740
I don't need it.

657
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:24,340
Why wouldn't you need it?

658
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:26,060
You're crashing at
someone else's house.

659
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:27,840
You should have some
money, at least.

660
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,150
Fine.

661
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:30,450
Thank you.

662
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,430
Hey.

663
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:38,880
If you play games every day,
you'll grow up to be like me.

664
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,120
- You know that?
- Fine, I get it.

665
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:50,910
Don't make trouble again.

666
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:53,620
Take good care of
Song Yi and Tae Poong.

667
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:56,510
I'll make money and
 come get you guys.

668
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:19,060
This is crazy, really.

669
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:21,220
You don't have the money, anyway.

670
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:23,890
Mom had left me some
money for when I get married.

671
00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:27,610
<i>But why would you give
 that money to him?</i>

672
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:29,810
You know he'll gamble it away.

673
00:37:29,810 --> 00:37:30,960
I'm sure.

674
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,160
<i>If you know that...</i>

675
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,140
why give it to him?

676
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:36,350
After giving it some thought,

677
00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:38,540
that 30 million won...

678
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:42,630
is not a high penance to
 pay for using the kids.

679
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:54,180
What are you doing?

680
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:58,020
Hey, you're not in bed?

681
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,880
I feel...

682
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,370
uneasy and can't fall asleep.

683
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,790
Are you relieved and sad
your stepdad is leaving?

684
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:11,350
Yes, I'm relieved but not sad at all.

685
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,500
Then what's disturbing you?

686
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,820
Do you blame me?

687
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:20,060
Getting pregnant while
 in high school,

688
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:23,950
and my stepdad appears
 suddenly only to leave again.

689
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:26,280
I have three younger siblings,

690
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,340
but they're still so young.

691
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:30,550
You're right.

692
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:33,180
I see why you'd feel uneasy.

693
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:40,500
But...

694
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:46,980
if it weren't for you,
I would've felt even worse.

695
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:49,160
I would've been at a loss,

696
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,000
and very scared.

697
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:57,080
♫ <i>Today was another difficult day</i> ♫

698
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:59,480
I'm also at a loss,

699
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,380
and feel scared at times.

700
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,050
But things have
a way of moving along.

701
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:08,790
Nothing I couldn't handle.

702
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:12,950

704
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:19,630
You're right.

705
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,650
Let's gather our strength.

706
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:26,740
Both of us.

707
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:30,920
Yes.

708
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,440
Let's do a "fighting."

709
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:34,200
Fighting!

710
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,940
Fighting! All right.

711
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:40,630

00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:45,330
You have feelings for

00:58:21,570 --> 00:58:24,970
He'll become DN Party's chairman
 before the general election.

1069
00:58:28,270 --> 00:58:31,270
<i>Assemblyman Hahm Tae Chun whose
 son was arrested on drug charges</i>

1070
00:58:31,270 --> 00:58:34,870
<i>was a strong chairman
candidate for the DN Party.</i>

1071
00:58:34,870 --> 00:58:38,150
<i>As this happened three weeks
before the party's election,</i>

1072
00:58:38,150 --> 00:58:43,190
<i>it's expected Assemblyman Hahm will
 suffer a critical political loss.</i>

1073
00:58:43,190 --> 00:58:45,360
Assemblyman Wie Dae Han is here.

1074
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:46,760
What should I do?

1075
00:58:48,710 --> 00:58:52,090
He's here for a visit, of course,
we should let him in.

1076
00:58:52,090 --> 00:58:53,090
Yes, sir.

1077
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:12,210
How are you feeling?

1078
00:59:12,210 --> 00:59:13,950
I'm okay.

1079
00:59:13,950 --> 00:59:16,580
Things must've been
 hectic for you.

1080
00:59:16,580 --> 00:59:18,580
Thank you for paying me a visit.

1081
00:59:18,580 --> 00:59:19,710
Don't mention it.

1082
00:59:19,710 --> 00:59:20,990
Of course, I should.

1083
00:59:21,990 --> 00:59:23,040
Have a seat.

1084
00:59:28,660 --> 00:59:32,390
Since the assailant is
 reported to be my supporter,

1085
00:59:32,390 --> 00:59:35,060
I'm feeling very heavy-hearted.

1086
00:59:35,060 --> 00:59:39,040
Politics isn't to be
 conducted by oneself.

1087
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:41,590
You must rule over
your supporters, too.

1088
00:59:41,590 --> 00:59:43,730
Aigoo, you're absolutely right.

1089
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:46,290
I've learned...

1090
00:59:46,290 --> 00:59:49,480
a great lesson from you,
Assemblyman Kang.

1091
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:53,130
You're even willing to
sacrifice your own body.

1092
00:59:53,130 --> 00:59:56,740
Wow, you're something, really.

1093
00:59:56,740 --> 00:59:59,390
Buddha only sees other Buddhas,

1094
00:59:59,390 --> 01:00:02,720
and fraudsters only
see other likes of you.

1095
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:04,280
A fraudster.

1096
01:00:05,850 --> 01:00:07,590
You say a fraudster...

1097
01:00:07,590 --> 01:00:09,670
But there are levels there, too.

1098
01:00:09,670 --> 01:00:12,970
I have a long way to go to
measure up to you.

1099
01:00:12,970 --> 01:00:15,220
Aigoo, such a long ways off.

1100
01:00:15,220 --> 01:00:16,750
Aigoo...

1101
01:00:16,750 --> 01:00:20,240
You stage a premeditated attack
 to void out the rental apartments,

1102
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:23,900
and got rid of me, who's
a pesky thorn on your side.

1103
01:00:25,140 --> 01:00:26,650
As for you,

1104
01:00:26,650 --> 01:00:29,040
you got sympathy votes from
 your party due to the attack,

1105
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:31,470
and destroyed your rival
Hahm Tae Chun using his son.

1106
01:00:31,470 --> 01:00:34,220
You're a shoo-in for
the chairman position.

1107
01:00:34,220 --> 01:00:36,460
Wow, really.

1108
01:00:36,460 --> 01:00:39,550
I could never paint this
big of a picture. Nope.

1109

You're amazing.

1110

You pay me a visit, and
you weave a good tale.

You don't know your butt
from your head.

1112

You haven't changed
 with age at all.

1113
01:00:52,220 --> 01:00:53,310
Aigoo.

1114
01:00:53,310 --> 01:00:54,460
That's how I am.

1115
01:00:54,460 --> 01:00:57,020
Regardless of the time and place,
my imagination runs wild...

1116

Aigoo, my mouth is the
 problem, my mouth.

1117
01:01:01,150 --> 01:01:03,950
My apologies if I've upset you.

1118
01:01:03,980 --> 01:01:06,980
If you know I'm upset,
then you may leave.

1119

Yes. Well, then...

1120

Please take care.

1121
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:19,420
You know when I came to see
you back in high school?

1122
01:01:19,420 --> 01:01:21,370
You remember, right?

1123
01:01:21,370 --> 01:01:26,190
I recall the advice you
gave me back then.

1124
01:01:26,190 --> 01:01:30,000
<i>As you know, for a nation
to run itself properly,</i>

1125
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:33,680
<i>every single citizen must
do their duties well,</i>

1126
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:36,890
<i>and should not covet
another's position.</i>

1127
01:01:36,890 --> 01:01:40,820
You told me not to covet
 another's position.

So please vacate yourself.

1131
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:56,270
What did you say to him?

1132

Just a small preview
before the real game.

1133

apartments voting will go?

What will happen to

1142
01:02:37,230 --> 01:02:39,380
It was thrown out,
so not much we can do.

1143
01:02:39,380 --> 01:02:41,310
It'll stay empty.

1144

Geez, it's a golden piece of land...

1145
01:02:44,340 --> 01:02:48,210
I'd rather have an international high school

1147
01:02:52,580 --> 01:02:54,480
I was careless.

1148
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:57,370

Yes.

1152
01:03:03,650 --> 01:03:05,870
Since Hahm Tae Chun is
out of the running,

1153
01:03:05,870 --> 01:03:08,320
Kang Kyung Hoon will be
 voted the chairman.

1154

What do you think it means?

1157

To secure his party's support
before the general election,

1158
01:03:17,100 --> 01:03:19,620
and make sure his team
secures the nominations.

1159

he's a tougher opponent
than Kang Kyung Hoon.
