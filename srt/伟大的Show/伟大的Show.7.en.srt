00:00:53,878 --> 00:00:55,406
(All characters, organizations,
places, entities, and events...)

2
00:00:55,407 --> 00:00:56,753
(in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:57,136 --> 00:00:59,017
(Public Assembly)

4
00:00:59,066 --> 00:01:00,397
In the previous episode,

5
00:01:01,166 --> 00:01:03,337
I argued that
abortion is a crime.

6
00:01:05,467 --> 00:01:07,576
But after finding out
about her pregnancy,

7
00:01:09,276 --> 00:01:11,077
I recommended an abortion...

8
00:01:13,346 --> 00:01:15,216
to my daughter who
wanted to keep the baby.

9
00:01:16,587 --> 00:01:17,987
According to my logic,

10
00:01:18,947 --> 00:01:20,956
I was asking her
to commit a crime.

11
00:01:22,157 --> 00:01:23,757
I know that this is shameless,

12
00:01:24,557 --> 00:01:26,697
and also that it doesn't
make much sense.

13
00:01:29,166 --> 00:01:31,566
I was worried about my
young daughter's future,

14
00:01:33,297 --> 00:01:34,867
and it was too much...

15
00:01:37,036 --> 00:01:39,676
for me to handle as well.

16
00:01:41,336 --> 00:01:43,907
Maybe that's why I asked
her to do such a thing.

17
00:01:46,377 --> 00:01:48,116
But her words...

18
00:01:49,887 --> 00:01:51,717
moved me.

19
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:58,987
She said she wanted
to protect her child...

20
00:02:00,657 --> 00:02:02,096
just like her mom did for her.

21
00:02:05,767 --> 00:02:07,497
When her mom had her,

22
00:02:08,396 --> 00:02:10,206
her father was not there.

23
00:02:11,607 --> 00:02:12,836
But right now,

24
00:02:14,077 --> 00:02:15,597
she has the baby's
father by her side.

25
00:02:17,077 --> 00:02:19,717
So she said she was confident
that she will not regret her choice.

26
00:02:25,187 --> 00:02:28,157
So I decided to
respect her choice.

27
00:02:30,586 --> 00:02:31,857
And using this opportunity,

28
00:02:33,527 --> 00:02:35,327
I would like to say
something to my daughter.

29
00:02:38,127 --> 00:02:40,437
I wasn't able to stay
by your mother's side.

30
00:02:42,866 --> 00:02:44,007
But...

31
00:02:45,107 --> 00:02:46,406
I will be there for you.

32
00:03:05,086 --> 00:03:08,956
Dae Han socked it to me good.

33
00:03:10,067 --> 00:03:12,767
I didn't fathom she would...

34
00:03:14,537 --> 00:03:15,767
keep the baby.

35
00:03:16,067 --> 00:03:18,306
We leaked it to the tabloids
and set it all up for him.

36
00:03:19,137 --> 00:03:22,646
You gave Dae Han
some great publicity.

37
00:03:23,007 --> 00:03:24,107
I'm sorry, sir.

38
00:03:32,487 --> 00:03:34,716
That guy on my desk...

39
00:03:36,656 --> 00:03:38,227
(Han Dong Nam)

40
00:03:39,496 --> 00:03:42,596
Do you mean Wi Dae
Han's children's real dad?

41
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:45,067
Yes. Find him.

42
00:03:45,896 --> 00:03:46,896
Yes, sir.

43
00:03:48,836 --> 00:03:52,167
But why do you want...

44
00:03:52,567 --> 00:03:54,006
I'm curious...

45
00:03:54,007 --> 00:03:57,676
what will happen if
there are two dads.

46
00:04:02,017 --> 00:04:04,387
Just wait a little while.

47
00:04:05,387 --> 00:04:08,257
I'll show people
your true colors.

48
00:04:09,757 --> 00:04:10,826
Get home safely.

49
00:04:10,827 --> 00:04:12,286
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

50
00:04:12,287 --> 00:04:16,026
Do you think all these staff members
are here to air your personal show?

51
00:04:16,396 --> 00:04:18,636
Why are you talking about
your personal life on live TV?

52
00:04:18,827 --> 00:04:20,737
It took a lot for me to say it.

53
00:04:20,866 --> 00:04:22,466
It was all for this show.

54
00:04:22,806 --> 00:04:25,606
What does your admitting
your daughter is pregnant...

55
00:04:25,607 --> 00:04:26,737
have to do with our show?

56
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:29,806
The viewers wouldn't
have heard a thing I said.

57
00:04:30,107 --> 00:04:32,006
They would've only wondered
whether that jerk's daughter...

58
00:04:32,007 --> 00:04:33,317
was really pregnant.

59
00:04:34,246 --> 00:04:37,017
It's true his statement
wasn't on topic,

60
00:04:37,917 --> 00:04:40,616
but it took a lot of
courage. Let's let it slide.

61
00:04:44,656 --> 00:04:47,757
Sir. How could you
move us like this?

62
00:04:48,857 --> 00:04:50,366
Thank you for being so kind.

63
00:04:50,597 --> 00:04:52,966
I felt bad that I may
have hurt the show.

64
00:04:52,967 --> 00:04:54,136
Hurt it?

65
00:04:54,467 --> 00:04:56,806
The ratings hit seven percent.

66
00:04:57,006 --> 00:04:59,707
We're sweeping the top
five most trending keywords.

67
00:05:00,506 --> 00:05:02,107
- I'm glad.
- Right?

68
00:05:02,576 --> 00:05:04,607
Let's go out for
dinner to celebrate.

69
00:05:04,847 --> 00:05:07,417
It's on me. Let's
go to a buffet!

70
00:05:08,816 --> 00:05:10,015
I'm sorry,

71
00:05:10,016 --> 00:05:12,147
but I need to go home early.

72
00:05:12,446 --> 00:05:13,957
The kids are waiting for me.

73
00:05:14,787 --> 00:05:16,727
Yes, let's go out another time.

74
00:05:17,186 --> 00:05:18,357
Do you have plans?

75
00:05:20,227 --> 00:05:21,357
I can't make it either.

76
00:05:22,357 --> 00:05:24,796
Then let's go ourselves.

77
00:05:24,797 --> 00:05:26,496
My treat. Top-quality
Korean beef.

78
00:05:28,196 --> 00:05:30,116
Let's go another time
when everyone can make it.

79
00:05:33,537 --> 00:05:34,676
I'll get going then.

80
00:05:43,946 --> 00:05:45,717
I thought you'd
deny it all the way.

81
00:05:46,186 --> 00:05:47,917
What made you say
that on the show?

82
00:05:50,227 --> 00:05:51,787
I decided...

83
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:54,196
to let Da Jung keep the baby.

84
00:05:55,196 --> 00:05:57,426
I've been denying her
pregnancy all this time.

85
00:05:58,366 --> 00:05:59,866
I should apologize
to the nation.

86
00:06:00,696 --> 00:06:03,066
What made you suddenly
have a change of heart?

87
00:06:05,167 --> 00:06:07,707
Da Jung sent me a
picture just before the show.

88
00:06:08,837 --> 00:06:09,876
A picture?

89
00:06:10,676 --> 00:06:11,946
The sonogram.

90
00:06:13,977 --> 00:06:15,876
She said looking at
it gave her strength,

91
00:06:16,816 --> 00:06:18,516
and that she wanted
to protect the baby,

92
00:06:20,386 --> 00:06:21,906
and I couldn't get
myself to stop her.

93
00:06:24,957 --> 00:06:26,926
They say no parent
can deny their child.

94
00:06:27,256 --> 00:06:28,457
You're a real dad now.

95
00:06:33,337 --> 00:06:36,207
Do you have a
baby in your belly?

96
00:06:36,866 --> 00:06:37,866
Yes.

97
00:06:37,867 --> 00:06:40,037
Then are we getting a
little brother or sister?

98
00:06:40,176 --> 00:06:43,306
Stupid. Not a little brother
or sister. A niece or nephew.

99
00:06:43,676 --> 00:06:46,217
Awesome. Do you know
what a niece and nephew are?

100
00:06:46,676 --> 00:06:48,477
That's basic knowledge.

101
00:06:48,847 --> 00:06:51,186
You'll be my brother-in-law now.

102
00:06:51,347 --> 00:06:53,857
Song Yi, you are a genius.

103
00:06:54,087 --> 00:06:55,616
Give me a break.

104
00:06:56,727 --> 00:07:00,357
My good man. Your
words are quite harsh.

105
00:07:00,797 --> 00:07:03,027
Please be careful going forward.

106
00:07:03,566 --> 00:07:04,826
It's not good for the baby.

107
00:07:05,597 --> 00:07:08,797
Sure. What a great
brother-in-law we have here.

108
00:07:17,707 --> 00:07:20,116
Okay, let's go to sleep.

109
00:07:21,176 --> 00:07:23,347
You too. It's late.
You should go.

110
00:07:24,116 --> 00:07:25,587
I should say hi to Father first.

111
00:07:26,256 --> 00:07:27,886
I want to thank him too.

112
00:07:34,457 --> 00:07:36,297
Good work today. Goodnight.

113
00:07:37,597 --> 00:07:39,967
Will you be okay?

114
00:07:40,696 --> 00:07:41,696
About what?

115
00:07:42,366 --> 00:07:44,407
Once Da Jung has a baby,

116
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:46,707
you'll be a grandpa.

117
00:07:47,306 --> 00:07:48,376
Grand...

118
00:07:52,576 --> 00:07:53,816
You're right.

119
00:07:56,816 --> 00:08:00,657
That's right. I'll give it a
shot. National Grandpa.

120
00:08:01,987 --> 00:08:03,157
I like how cool you are.

121
00:08:04,256 --> 00:08:06,527
True. You said back then...

122
00:08:07,126 --> 00:08:08,126
What?

123
00:08:08,127 --> 00:08:10,667
That you have a superhero's
blood flowing through your veins.

124
00:08:12,496 --> 00:08:14,537
You'll do great
as a grandpa too.

125
00:08:16,936 --> 00:08:19,435
Have you ever seen a superhero
take down villains alone?

126
00:08:19,436 --> 00:08:20,607
He needs a partner.

127
00:08:21,907 --> 00:08:24,707
I was able to make this decision
because you were by my side.

128
00:08:25,607 --> 00:08:27,547
- You'll help me, right?
- Forget it.

129
00:08:29,076 --> 00:08:30,616
You must be tired. Go in.

130
00:08:31,616 --> 00:08:32,686
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

131
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:41,657
If you forgive me this once,

132
00:08:43,566 --> 00:08:45,696
I will do my utmost to
carry out our agreement.

133
00:08:58,847 --> 00:09:01,146
If you still refuse,

134
00:09:01,147 --> 00:09:03,487
I'll have no choice but to
go public about our contract.

135
00:09:05,287 --> 00:09:06,556
What?

136
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:20,566
(Quiet!)

137
00:09:20,567 --> 00:09:24,307
(Episode 7: Secrets and Lies)

138
00:09:26,937 --> 00:09:28,136
Welcome back.

139
00:09:29,536 --> 00:09:30,607
Where is Da Jung?

140
00:09:31,646 --> 00:09:33,577
She went to tuck
her siblings in.

141
00:09:37,317 --> 00:09:40,256
Thank you for your approval.

142
00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:43,125
Should I bow to you to show
how much I appreciate it?

143
00:09:43,126 --> 00:09:44,187
No need.

144
00:09:45,427 --> 00:09:46,857
What's the plan now?

145
00:09:52,866 --> 00:09:56,766
I'll be more determined
to work harder.

146
00:09:57,207 --> 00:10:00,536
I am going to earn money
by working part-time jobs.

147
00:10:00,636 --> 00:10:02,107
Why are you running
part-time jobs?

148
00:10:03,677 --> 00:10:04,776
What?

149
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:08,476
Thing is...

150
00:10:08,477 --> 00:10:10,416
Jung Woo got kicked
out of the agency.

151
00:10:10,847 --> 00:10:11,847
Father.

152
00:10:11,848 --> 00:10:13,286
She deserves to know.

153
00:10:14,487 --> 00:10:15,916
It's about her baby's father.

154
00:10:17,286 --> 00:10:18,856
He is right.

155
00:10:18,857 --> 00:10:20,697
Don't hide these things from me.

156
00:10:21,827 --> 00:10:24,796
I didn't want you
to get worried.

157
00:10:27,737 --> 00:10:31,506
Did you get kicked out
because of what happened to us?

158
00:10:31,737 --> 00:10:34,207
If so, do we have
to pay a penalty?

159
00:10:36,036 --> 00:10:39,245
There is some money
that I have to pay back.

160
00:10:39,246 --> 00:10:41,116
I will try to take care of it.

161
00:10:41,546 --> 00:10:44,146
You should come up with a
plan for your future instead.

162
00:11:02,097 --> 00:11:04,136
Thank you for your approval.

163
00:11:06,107 --> 00:11:07,276
And I am sorry...

164
00:11:08,937 --> 00:11:11,707
that I sent that text
before the show.

165
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:14,447
I understand...

166
00:11:15,317 --> 00:11:16,757
that you want to
protect your child.

167
00:11:19,957 --> 00:11:22,687
But isn't it too much when you try
to threaten me with the contract?

168
00:11:23,656 --> 00:11:25,487
Like I said,

169
00:11:26,957 --> 00:11:29,395
I will do my utmost to
carry out our agreement.

170
00:11:29,396 --> 00:11:31,467
And how are you
going to do that?

171
00:11:31,567 --> 00:11:32,996
Anything.

172
00:11:33,766 --> 00:11:36,837
If it helps you get re-elected
as an assemblyman.

173
00:11:40,837 --> 00:11:43,807
Due to the choice I made today,

174
00:11:44,307 --> 00:11:46,507
both you and I would have
to live very different lives.

175
00:11:48,677 --> 00:11:51,746
And you don't need to threaten
me with that contract too.

176
00:11:52,817 --> 00:11:54,357
What does that mean?

177
00:11:54,457 --> 00:11:56,827
I openly said that you
will give birth to that child.

178
00:11:57,227 --> 00:11:58,386
So?

179
00:11:58,457 --> 00:12:01,655
People would be more
interested in how we live.

180
00:12:01,656 --> 00:12:03,427
More than ever.

181
00:12:03,567 --> 00:12:04,967
Now,

182
00:12:05,026 --> 00:12:06,765
it's almost impossible for
us to cut our ties completely...

183
00:12:06,766 --> 00:12:08,837
once our contract term is over.

184
00:12:14,477 --> 00:12:17,447
I might as well have
tied you down too.

185
00:12:20,677 --> 00:12:21,677
I'm sorry.

186
00:12:21,678 --> 00:12:23,415
No need to apologize.

187
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:25,016
I brought that on myself.

188
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:28,256
But I can't be
like your real dad.

189
00:12:30,827 --> 00:12:32,687
I will continue to act
as your legal guardian.

190
00:12:39,866 --> 00:12:41,396
That's enough for me.

191
00:12:42,337 --> 00:12:43,937
I am sure you are tired.

192
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:46,036
I hope you rest well.

193
00:13:10,396 --> 00:13:11,467
Mom...

194
00:13:12,766 --> 00:13:14,866
Do you think I can do this?

195
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:31,446
(Da Jung)

196
00:13:31,447 --> 00:13:33,817
Since we decided not to
feel sorry to each other,

197
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:36,116
I am not going to apologize.

198
00:13:37,187 --> 00:13:39,126
I am going to be
grateful all my life.

199
00:13:39,957 --> 00:13:42,226
Thank you for
protecting our baby...

200
00:13:42,227 --> 00:13:43,927
even at the cost of your debut.

201
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:46,666
I am the one who
should be thankful.

202
00:13:52,266 --> 00:13:53,437
But...

203
00:13:54,036 --> 00:13:55,636
why am I so scared?

204
00:14:00,347 --> 00:14:01,447
(Shut up and fry!)

205
00:14:02,146 --> 00:14:03,546
Here you go. Eat.

206
00:14:04,046 --> 00:14:05,846
- Dad.
- Huh?

207
00:14:05,847 --> 00:14:08,956
Why are there fewer
customers than usual?

208
00:14:08,957 --> 00:14:11,057
Usually, around this time,
I can't even find a seat.

209
00:14:11,557 --> 00:14:13,926
You are right. Is there
something going on today?

210
00:14:13,927 --> 00:14:15,457
It's weirdly empty.

211
00:14:17,296 --> 00:14:19,937
Dad, did you see the show?

212
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:21,737
Of course, I did.

213
00:14:22,337 --> 00:14:24,466
I have to say...

214
00:14:24,467 --> 00:14:27,207
Wi Dae Han is quite a character.

215
00:14:27,437 --> 00:14:28,437
Why?

216
00:14:28,438 --> 00:14:29,946
Oh, come on.

217
00:14:29,947 --> 00:14:32,846
What other people
may keep to themselves,

218
00:14:32,847 --> 00:14:36,217
he just confesses on TV!
It's not easy, you know.

219
00:14:37,187 --> 00:14:39,745
I mean, his name
has a good ring to it.

220
00:14:39,746 --> 00:14:42,487
He is going to make a
name for himself, for sure.

221
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:44,326
Make a name for himself? No way.

222
00:14:44,327 --> 00:14:46,286
He is going to get
into very big trouble.

223
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:49,155
Even if she wants the
baby, she is just a schoolgirl.

224
00:14:49,156 --> 00:14:51,036
What is she going to do
after she has the baby?

225
00:14:51,427 --> 00:14:53,226
You are right.

226
00:14:53,227 --> 00:14:55,996
Doesn't she have young
siblings to take care of?

227
00:14:56,536 --> 00:14:57,806
Now that I think about it...

228
00:14:57,807 --> 00:15:01,005
Dae Han is quite rash.

229
00:15:01,006 --> 00:15:03,177
Come on, Da Jung is not alone.

230
00:15:04,246 --> 00:15:08,217
There's also the baby's father.
We don't need to worry now.

231
00:15:25,067 --> 00:15:26,197
Come on.

232
00:15:30,006 --> 00:15:31,265
Now...

233
00:15:31,266 --> 00:15:34,937
it's been almost ten years
since Ji Hyun passed away.

234
00:15:37,006 --> 00:15:39,307
Are you just going to
sit there and not work?

235
00:15:39,347 --> 00:15:40,745
Go in and fry chicken.

236
00:15:40,746 --> 00:15:44,286
Of course. I will do
that. I'm on my way.

237
00:15:54,957 --> 00:15:56,597
(Kim Hye Jin)

238
00:15:56,697 --> 00:15:58,126
Enjoy your meal.

239
00:15:58,597 --> 00:16:00,272
Why did you want to
see me so late at night?

240
00:16:00,296 --> 00:16:01,737
I have something to say,

241
00:16:01,996 --> 00:16:04,165
but I thought talking about it
over the phone is not appropriate.

242
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:07,776
If you can't talk over the
phone, it's not about work.

243
00:16:10,546 --> 00:16:12,447
You already know that
I like Mr. Kang, right?

244
00:16:14,546 --> 00:16:15,717
So?

245
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:20,016
I was wondering
if you like him too.

246
00:16:22,457 --> 00:16:24,286
This feels like
an interrogation.

247
00:16:25,557 --> 00:16:28,496
Sorry. I am not good at
beating around the bush.

248
00:16:34,597 --> 00:16:36,636
Then I will be
direct with you too.

249
00:16:37,837 --> 00:16:40,177
You are correct. I'm
interested in Mr. Kang.

250
00:16:40,837 --> 00:16:42,876
If this is why you
wanted to see me...

251
00:16:42,937 --> 00:16:44,347
then I should get going.

252
00:16:44,646 --> 00:16:46,246
This makes me feel
very uncomfortable.

253
00:16:47,146 --> 00:16:48,577
Then what about Dae Han?

254
00:16:49,116 --> 00:16:50,946
Weren't you two
close during college?

255
00:16:50,947 --> 00:16:52,745
You two seem quite
close these days too.

256
00:16:52,746 --> 00:16:54,756
Both physically and emotionally.

257
00:16:56,386 --> 00:16:58,857
You are right. We are close.

258
00:16:59,057 --> 00:17:01,626
We are neighbors, and
we also work together.

259
00:17:01,756 --> 00:17:03,766
But that's it.

260
00:17:04,026 --> 00:17:06,696
Is that so? Do you think
he feels the same way? You

261
00:17:06,697 --> 00:17:09,895
should ask him. Why
are you asking me?

262
00:17:09,896 --> 00:17:12,136
You have quite an imagination.

263
00:17:12,266 --> 00:17:14,906
Trying to fix me up with someone
who is about to be a grandfather.

264
00:17:15,307 --> 00:17:16,536
I need to go.

265
00:17:35,227 --> 00:17:36,296
(Lawyer Kang)

266
00:17:36,327 --> 00:17:38,727
Are we still on for night
fishing tomorrow night?

267
00:17:40,566 --> 00:17:42,436
Of course. We promised.

268
00:17:42,437 --> 00:17:44,997
Although it's my first time
fishing, so I am not very confident.

269
00:17:48,407 --> 00:17:50,146
(Real-time keyword ranking,
Wi Dae Han, Debate, daughter)

270
00:17:50,147 --> 00:17:52,406
The most searched
keyword is Wi Dae Han.

271
00:17:52,407 --> 00:17:54,846
Followed by Wi
Dae Han's daughter.

272
00:17:56,477 --> 00:17:58,846
Your popularity as National
Dad was starting to wane.

273
00:17:59,046 --> 00:18:01,516
That baby is your lucky charm.

274
00:18:01,556 --> 00:18:03,755
Low-birth rate is
a serious issue.

275
00:18:03,756 --> 00:18:05,826
Having a child is
an act of patriotism.

276
00:18:07,026 --> 00:18:09,555
People like me should be elected
as to the National Assembly.

277
00:18:09,556 --> 00:18:12,397
I am going to have four children
and a grandchild before marriage.

278
00:18:15,737 --> 00:18:18,736
Is that...

279
00:18:18,737 --> 00:18:20,377
a baby on your back?

280
00:18:20,637 --> 00:18:22,336
What? Who is this?

281
00:18:22,806 --> 00:18:24,745
Who are you?

282
00:18:24,746 --> 00:18:26,245
What? How did he get here?

283
00:18:26,246 --> 00:18:28,717
- Do something. He's slipping.
- Do what?

284
00:18:29,877 --> 00:18:31,387
Stop crying.

285
00:18:31,586 --> 00:18:32,586
Oh no.

286
00:18:33,046 --> 00:18:34,816
Why are you here?

287
00:18:35,157 --> 00:18:37,127
How did you get...

288
00:18:50,536 --> 00:18:51,737
What?

289
00:18:53,167 --> 00:18:55,177
Am I really going
to be a grandfather?

290
00:18:59,147 --> 00:19:00,516
Darn it.

291
00:19:03,647 --> 00:19:05,117
Is he even inside?

292
00:19:12,187 --> 00:19:13,386
There are tons of them!

293
00:19:13,387 --> 00:19:15,526
Why are those people here?

294
00:19:16,026 --> 00:19:18,766
Why do you think? It's thanks
to the great father and daughter

295
00:19:19,397 --> 00:19:20,397
What are you going to do?

296
00:19:20,398 --> 00:19:22,737
Everyone's going to know
who I am because of you.

297
00:19:22,937 --> 00:19:25,467
Just wear a mask outside.

298
00:19:25,566 --> 00:19:27,677
You can pretend that
you're a superstar.

299
00:19:28,477 --> 00:19:30,407
Forget about them
and get ready for school.

300
00:19:30,606 --> 00:19:31,806
I'll send them away.

301
00:19:34,217 --> 00:19:35,246
He's coming.

302
00:19:38,516 --> 00:19:40,286
When did she decide
to keep the baby?

303
00:19:40,617 --> 00:19:42,417
How does it feel to
be a grandfather soon?

304
00:19:42,617 --> 00:19:44,256
Did your daughter
drop out of school?

305
00:19:44,657 --> 00:19:46,727
You must be having a
hard time working so early.

306
00:19:47,397 --> 00:19:50,227
I'll be setting up a
press conference,

307
00:19:50,427 --> 00:19:53,026
so please refrain from
coming to our house like this.

308
00:19:53,326 --> 00:19:54,667
It doesn't matter for me,

309
00:19:55,296 --> 00:19:57,606
but my kids are still young
and not public figures.

310
00:19:58,867 --> 00:20:02,606
Please help protect
my children's privacy.

311
00:20:04,246 --> 00:20:05,845
Could you at least answer this?

312
00:20:05,846 --> 00:20:07,966
Is it true that the baby's
father is an idol trainee?

313
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:10,447
Gosh.

314
00:20:10,917 --> 00:20:13,086
That would be great
for us, of course.

315
00:20:13,246 --> 00:20:14,806
That's what I call
a win-win situation.

316
00:20:15,016 --> 00:20:16,586
We get the publicity,

317
00:20:17,056 --> 00:20:19,227
and Jung Woo won't
have to pay the penalty.

318
00:20:25,096 --> 00:20:26,526
If I answer that question,

319
00:20:27,336 --> 00:20:28,596
will you all go away?

320
00:20:30,506 --> 00:20:31,606
Sure, we will do that.

321
00:20:33,237 --> 00:20:35,806
He is an idol trainee.

322
00:20:36,377 --> 00:20:38,005
See? I told you.

323
00:20:38,006 --> 00:20:40,745
He was a member of a group
called "Chaos", set to debut soon.

324
00:20:40,746 --> 00:20:43,117
- "Chaos"? Look that up.
- "Chaos"?

325
00:20:49,657 --> 00:20:52,157
I settled the penalty problem,
so don't worry about it.

326
00:20:53,927 --> 00:20:56,157
Okay. Thank you.

327
00:20:58,467 --> 00:20:59,867
You should give up on school.

328
00:21:02,296 --> 00:21:04,467
No. I'm going to keep attending.

329
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:08,237
I want to finish this
semester, at least.

330
00:21:11,606 --> 00:21:13,647
The whole school will
know you're pregnant,

331
00:21:14,016 --> 00:21:16,177
and the kids and their
parents won't leave you alone.

332
00:21:17,016 --> 00:21:18,617
I'll have to deal with it.

333
00:21:20,246 --> 00:21:22,387
I want to be a proud mother...

334
00:21:24,187 --> 00:21:25,856
for my baby.

335
00:21:27,296 --> 00:21:29,056
I don't want to
hide like a criminal.

336
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:32,126
I know how you feel, but...

337
00:21:32,127 --> 00:21:34,197
I've been looking
it up all night,

338
00:21:34,437 --> 00:21:37,336
and pregnant students
also have a right...

339
00:21:39,367 --> 00:21:41,776
to education.

340
00:21:41,937 --> 00:21:46,046
But what about the others' rights
being violated because of you?

341
00:21:48,417 --> 00:21:49,617
Didn't I tell you yesterday?

342
00:21:50,687 --> 00:21:52,527
You're going to have
to live a different life.

343
00:21:54,217 --> 00:21:55,687
Give up school.

344
00:21:56,286 --> 00:21:57,806
The principal will
say the same thing.

345
00:21:59,957 --> 00:22:01,697
We have to let her
attend if she wants to.

346
00:22:03,556 --> 00:22:04,896
The right to education...

347
00:22:04,897 --> 00:22:07,197
is a basic human right
guaranteed by the constitution.

348
00:22:08,836 --> 00:22:10,907
Yes. It is, sir.

349
00:22:12,336 --> 00:22:13,806
I was touched...

350
00:22:14,036 --> 00:22:16,576
by you and your daughter's
courage yesterday on the show.

351
00:22:17,207 --> 00:22:20,746
Of course, there may
be some parents...

352
00:22:20,947 --> 00:22:23,276
who oppose having a
pregnant student at school.

353
00:22:23,987 --> 00:22:25,887
Yes, sir. That's what I mean.

354
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:29,585
As a parent,

355
00:22:29,586 --> 00:22:31,586
I fully understand
how they feel.

356
00:22:32,256 --> 00:22:35,055
But that's why the principal...

357
00:22:35,056 --> 00:22:36,697
must resolve these conflicts.

358
00:22:37,026 --> 00:22:39,867
I will try to persuade
the parents,

359
00:22:40,096 --> 00:22:41,367
so don't worry.

360
00:22:45,207 --> 00:22:46,207
Yes, sir.

361
00:22:46,566 --> 00:22:48,276
Some of you may already know,

362
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:50,237
but the school has
been discussing it,

363
00:22:50,907 --> 00:22:54,276
and Da Jung will keep
studying with you all.

364
00:22:58,687 --> 00:23:03,387
I hope you can be
considerate towards Da Jung.

365
00:23:03,687 --> 00:23:05,957
What? Wasn't she dropping out?

366
00:23:06,356 --> 00:23:09,025
She wants to stay and
the principal agreed,

367
00:23:09,026 --> 00:23:10,546
so she will be
finishing the semester.

368
00:23:11,197 --> 00:23:12,826
Is she crazy?

369
00:23:13,367 --> 00:23:15,697
What's wrong with our school?

370
00:23:16,367 --> 00:23:18,506
It is a special case,

371
00:23:18,937 --> 00:23:22,106
but she has the right to
education, just like the rest of you.

372
00:23:22,437 --> 00:23:24,677
Sir, it's different.

373
00:23:24,977 --> 00:23:27,423
What if she accidentally bumps
into someone and has a miscarriage?

374
00:23:27,447 --> 00:23:29,116
Who is going to
take responsibility?

375
00:23:29,117 --> 00:23:30,647
That's why you need
to be considerate.

376
00:23:31,046 --> 00:23:32,886
Don't run around
in the classroom...

377
00:23:32,887 --> 00:23:35,286
and talk quietly if you can.

378
00:23:35,487 --> 00:23:38,487
Why do we have to be careful
at school because of her?

379
00:23:38,756 --> 00:23:40,836
Being pregnant isn't
something to brag about, is it?

380
00:23:40,996 --> 00:23:42,296
- That's right!
- Exactly!

381
00:23:45,326 --> 00:23:46,825
Why do we have
to be the victims?

382
00:23:46,826 --> 00:23:47,897
Sir.

383
00:23:48,266 --> 00:23:51,366
It's all right with me, so please
treat me just like the others.

384
00:23:51,367 --> 00:23:52,707
I'd feel better that way.

385
00:23:56,776 --> 00:23:59,707
I'm sorry to be a bother
to you. I really am.

386
00:24:00,276 --> 00:24:01,516
If you're sorry,

387
00:24:02,276 --> 00:24:03,477
drop out of school.

388
00:24:03,947 --> 00:24:06,045
Go Min Ji, that's enough.

389
00:24:06,046 --> 00:24:07,586
Why do you keep picking on me?

390
00:24:07,816 --> 00:24:09,686
She's the one who got
pregnant and is causing problems!

391
00:24:09,687 --> 00:24:11,687
- That's right!
- Exactly!

392
00:24:14,756 --> 00:24:17,157
You're a nation-wide star now.

393
00:24:17,467 --> 00:24:19,766
You might even become
the president soon.

394
00:24:20,796 --> 00:24:23,836
Gosh, why are you
complimenting me?

395
00:24:24,266 --> 00:24:26,213
Did you see the debate regarding
the low-income apartments yesterday?

396
00:24:26,237 --> 00:24:28,877
Contentwise, you lost.

397
00:24:29,276 --> 00:24:31,806
Sure. I couldn't prepare
much because of Da Jung.

398
00:24:32,106 --> 00:24:33,176
Who cares?

399
00:24:33,177 --> 00:24:36,346
People only remember
the image and not the logic.

400
00:24:36,917 --> 00:24:39,816
You may have lost the
combat, but you won the war.

401
00:24:41,717 --> 00:24:43,186
How is the public opinion?

402
00:24:43,187 --> 00:24:45,325
Before you came in, 70
percent was for the school...

403
00:24:45,326 --> 00:24:47,086
and 30 percent was
for the apartments,

404
00:24:47,397 --> 00:24:49,227
but we're up to 50-50 now.

405
00:24:49,356 --> 00:24:52,326
We will have to win
the mothers' favor...

406
00:24:52,727 --> 00:24:54,096
and go up to 70 percent.

407
00:24:55,336 --> 00:24:57,706
You know that's the
hardest part, right?

408
00:24:57,707 --> 00:24:59,836
Of course, I do.

409
00:25:00,306 --> 00:25:02,737
But who is Wi Dae Han?

410
00:25:03,237 --> 00:25:04,846
You're the National Dad.

411
00:25:07,276 --> 00:25:09,746
Oh, what happened with
your daughter's school?

412
00:25:10,447 --> 00:25:13,246
- Don't they suggest she quit?
- Of course.

413
00:25:14,117 --> 00:25:15,816
That should be the
natural response,

414
00:25:16,417 --> 00:25:18,056
but they're doing
the exact opposite.

415
00:25:19,056 --> 00:25:21,227
The principal called, sir.

416
00:25:22,157 --> 00:25:23,967
Is she going to keep
attending the school?

417
00:25:24,427 --> 00:25:26,996
It seemed like Wi Dae
Han wanted her to quit,

418
00:25:27,467 --> 00:25:30,566
but he was able to lead her
into attending as you instructed.

419
00:25:32,467 --> 00:25:35,437
When they reveal her pregnancy
and say she will have the baby,

420
00:25:35,977 --> 00:25:37,576
the people will like that.

421
00:25:38,006 --> 00:25:42,346
But when their kids face a
disadvantage because of her,

422
00:25:42,776 --> 00:25:44,086
it won't be the same.

423
00:25:44,887 --> 00:25:45,917

427
00:25:55,927 --> 00:25:58,426

- No.

sensitive and important time.

class as a pregnant girl,

433
00:26:11,106 --> 00:26:13,045
how will they focus
on their studies?

434
00:26:13,046 --> 00:26:15,877
- We can't let that happen.
- They won't be able to.

435
00:26:18,016 --> 00:26:20,586

take a look at this! Hurry!

- Yes.

- He's my type.
- He's so handsome.

439
00:26:31,367 --> 00:26:32,727
Too bad.

440
00:26:33,026 --> 00:26:35,197
He would've been so
popular if he debuted.

441

top keyword ranking.

442

down our restaurant.

What are you talking about?

450
00:27:04,066 --> 00:27:05,467
Calm down and explain it to me.

451
00:27:06,397 --> 00:27:11,266
Well, we suddenly had so
little customers yesterday...

452
00:27:12,006 --> 00:27:13,505
and our regular customer...

453
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:16,206
wouldn't even look at
me when I greeted her.

454
00:27:16,207 --> 00:27:18,677
It was so weird,
so I looked it up,

455
00:27:19,246 --> 00:27:21,416
and there was a post on a
neighborhood mommy website...

456
00:27:21,417 --> 00:27:24,487
that was talking ill
about our restaurant.

457
00:27:24,617 --> 00:27:26,616
That's the only
reason I could find,

458
00:27:26,617 --> 00:27:28,816
and I don't know what
I should do about it.

459
00:27:29,187 --> 00:27:32,487
Why are you calling
everyone about it?

460
00:27:32,856 --> 00:27:33,987
Hang up right now!

461
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:37,897
I was just mad and upset!

462
00:27:38,127 --> 00:27:40,367
Then who am I
supposed to whine to?

463
00:27:40,897 --> 00:27:42,595
- First, - Yes?

464
00:27:42,596 --> 00:27:45,707
I'll find out what's going
on, so don't worry about it.

465
00:27:46,407 --> 00:27:47,477
Okay.

466
00:27:48,836 --> 00:27:50,237
- What's going on?
- What?

467
00:27:50,947 --> 00:27:54,377
There's a post on a mommy website

influence on the moms in that area.

470

I heard there are many restaurants
that closed down like that.

471
00:28:04,756 --> 00:28:06,026
I'll have to find a way.

472

Hello. I see you're
all working hard.

00:28:13,796 --> 00:28:15,397

474
00:28:15,937 --> 00:28:18,736
I was here for a
radio show today,

475
00:28:18,737 --> 00:28:20,605
so I stopped by to
support you guys.

476
00:28:20,606 --> 00:28:22,437

- Thank you.

need to talk to you for a minute.

480
00:28:36,286 --> 00:28:37,526
- I'll be back.
- Okay.

00:28:38,256 --> 00:28:39,387
Good luck.

483
00:28:43,526 --> 00:28:44,967

have claustrophobia?

00:28:49,096 --> 00:28:50,967
It's good to get some exercise.

486
00:28:51,707 --> 00:28:53,367

I've never seen a chicken

00:29:09,256 --> 00:29:12,855

00:31:03,066 --> 00:31:04,566
Hello, Mr. Kang.

531
00:31:05,606 --> 00:31:07,306
When should I meet
you at the studio?

532
00:31:07,566 --> 00:31:10,536
I'm so sorry,

533
00:31:10,836 --> 00:31:12,806
but I have a family
matter to handle,

534
00:31:13,046 --> 00:31:14,617
so I can't make it today.

535
00:31:16,417 --> 00:31:17,447
Really?

536
00:31:17,786 --> 00:31:20,956
Okay. I can't say I'm not
disappointed, but what can you do?

537
00:31:20,957 --> 00:31:22,056
Okay.

538
00:31:22,516 --> 00:31:24,657
Does he have
nothing better to do?

539
00:31:27,556 --> 00:31:29,596
Chaos.

540
00:31:30,127 --> 00:31:31,566
Okay. Nice.

541
00:31:32,627 --> 00:31:36,637
So I don't owe you
a penalty, right?

542
00:31:37,867 --> 00:31:41,106
That's right. This
is my problem.

543
00:31:41,137 --> 00:31:42,576
I care about people too much.

544
00:31:44,207 --> 00:31:45,506
Thank you.

545
00:31:47,346 --> 00:31:50,146
Are the other
members practicing?

546
00:31:50,147 --> 00:31:53,217
They don't even
have time to pee.

547
00:31:55,157 --> 00:31:57,487
They left early this morning
to shoot a music video.

548
00:32:20,506 --> 00:32:23,217
I wanted to say bye.

549

(Sweat poured out together
is fragrant. By Jung Woo)

551
00:32:38,697 --> 00:32:41,796
Okay. Let's go sweat.

(Jungnam Study Abroad Agency)

553
00:32:53,407 --> 00:32:55,647
Hey, what are
you doing? Move it.

554
00:32:56,947 --> 00:32:59,217
Okay. I will.

555
00:33:04,586 --> 00:33:06,286
How...

556
00:33:06,556 --> 00:33:08,055
Aren't you scared?

557
00:33:08,056 --> 00:33:11,766
You punk. Why is this
scary? Money is what's scary.

558
00:33:12,427 --> 00:33:15,065
I hired you because
you begged and begged.

559
00:33:15,066 --> 00:33:16,167
Get over here.

560
00:33:19,306 --> 00:33:20,367
Okay.

561
00:33:32,586 --> 00:33:34,657
Money is scary,

562
00:33:37,586 --> 00:33:39,856
but this is much scarier.

563
00:33:48,336 --> 00:33:51,406
What? Someone who would
want to retaliate against us?

564
00:33:51,407 --> 00:33:53,835
Yes. Looking at what she
wrote on the mommy site,

565
00:33:53,836 --> 00:33:56,536
it couldn't have been
an average customer.

566
00:33:56,737 --> 00:33:59,377
I'm sure she has a grudge
against the two of you.

567
00:33:59,477 --> 00:34:02,216
That's right. Can't
you think of anyone?

568
00:34:02,217 --> 00:34:04,016
I don't know.

569
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:06,646
As you know,

570
00:34:06,647 --> 00:34:08,555
your dad would
let people hurt him,

571
00:34:08,556 --> 00:34:10,816
but he would never hurt others.

572
00:34:10,856 --> 00:34:14,696
I know that's how Dad
is, but you have a temper.

573
00:34:14,697 --> 00:34:15,897
That's true.

574
00:34:16,756 --> 00:34:17,967
What was that?

575
00:34:20,167 --> 00:34:23,967
Whatever. Let's see how
well your business does.

576
00:34:24,096 --> 00:34:27,907
I'll be sure to post about
your restaurant online.

577
00:34:29,836 --> 00:34:31,575
It was that woman.

578
00:34:31,576 --> 00:34:33,546
What? Who?

579
00:34:33,947 --> 00:34:36,045
Who else?

580
00:34:36,046 --> 00:34:37,776
Jae Hoon's mom.

581
00:34:39,246 --> 00:34:41,487
You're right.

582
00:34:41,617 --> 00:34:44,755
She's mad about the
low-income apartments.

583
00:34:44,756 --> 00:34:45,756
That's right.

584
00:34:45,757 --> 00:34:49,755
She wouldn't have posted that
just because of what happened.

585
00:34:49,756 --> 00:34:53,665
No, no. That woman is
capable of much worse.

586
00:34:53,666 --> 00:34:56,036
Who's Jae Hoon's mom?

587
00:34:56,037 --> 00:34:59,137
She was a big supporter
of the international school.

588
00:34:59,867 --> 00:35:01,807
This is trouble.

589
00:35:02,106 --> 00:35:03,676
If it was her,

590
00:35:03,677 --> 00:35:07,306
she won't take it down even
if I get on my knees and beg.

591
00:35:07,307 --> 00:35:11,447
Why would we get on our
knees? What did we do wrong?

592
00:35:11,646 --> 00:35:13,746
I'm going to
break her fingers...

593
00:35:13,747 --> 00:35:15,255
Calm down.

594
00:35:15,256 --> 00:35:17,455
- Ma'am.
- Calm down, will you?

595
00:35:17,456 --> 00:35:20,255
You need to be
cool-headed in times like this.

596
00:35:20,256 --> 00:35:23,056
Yes, she's right.
Please calm down.

597
00:35:23,057 --> 00:35:24,927
I'm sure there's a way.

598
00:35:25,566 --> 00:35:28,637
Why don't we show it to them?

599
00:35:29,867 --> 00:35:31,336
Show what to whom?

600
00:35:31,467 --> 00:35:32,866
You frying the chicken.

601
00:35:32,867 --> 00:35:35,276
They'll probably believe
it if they see it themselves.

602
00:35:35,836 --> 00:35:38,376
Let them see it themselves.

603
00:35:38,646 --> 00:35:42,045
That sounds easy,
but how will we show it?

604
00:35:42,046 --> 00:35:44,586
We can't bring everyone here.

605
00:35:44,947 --> 00:35:47,217
You can film it and
post it on the website.

606
00:35:48,756 --> 00:35:52,956
They'll think it was
filmed as a promotion.

607
00:35:53,387 --> 00:35:56,026
I guess you're right.

608
00:35:58,066 --> 00:36:01,435
Then our restaurant is ruined.

609
00:36:01,436 --> 00:36:03,935
It's completely ruined.

610
00:36:03,936 --> 00:36:06,136
You and your big mouth.

611
00:36:06,137 --> 00:36:08,705
This is all your fault!

612
00:36:08,706 --> 00:36:11,307
Why are you pinching me?

613
00:36:11,407 --> 00:36:13,506
I'd do a livecast.

614
00:36:15,447 --> 00:36:16,476
What?

615
00:36:17,117 --> 00:36:18,146
A livecast?

616
00:36:22,356 --> 00:36:24,355
That's it. A one-man broadcast.

617
00:36:24,356 --> 00:36:27,026
If we post the URL on the
website, they'll check it themselves.

618
00:36:28,256 --> 00:36:31,126
If we broadcast live
throughout business hours,

619
00:36:31,626 --> 00:36:33,565
they can't insist it was
only during the filming.

620
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:36,436
That's right. And it'll help
promote the restaurant.

621
00:36:36,737 --> 00:36:38,566
Why didn't I think of that?

622
00:36:38,867 --> 00:36:41,605
Nice, Tak. Great idea.

623
00:36:41,606 --> 00:36:42,775
Nice.

624
00:36:42,776 --> 00:36:44,237
It's a great idea.

625
00:36:44,307 --> 00:36:45,446
So...

626
00:36:45,447 --> 00:36:47,676
- Oh my. Hello.
- Hello.

627
00:36:47,677 --> 00:36:49,876
Mr. Kang.

628
00:36:53,117 --> 00:36:54,617
What are you doing here?

629
00:36:55,017 --> 00:36:56,257
I was craving chicken and beer.

630
00:36:56,856 --> 00:36:59,887
It's so nice to see you. I didn't
think I'd get to see you today.

631
00:37:08,507 --> 00:37:10,877
Why isn't Mr. Wi going with us?

632
00:37:11,346 --> 00:37:13,575
He has work to do.

633
00:37:13,576 --> 00:37:17,686
I hope Soo Hyun and
Mr. Wi get married.

634
00:37:17,687 --> 00:37:21,086
Me too. Then she'll
become our mommy.

635
00:37:21,087 --> 00:37:22,687
Why would she? She isn't stupid.

636
00:37:32,096 --> 00:37:33,467
What about the night fishing?

637
00:37:33,837 --> 00:37:36,136
I canceled it since
you couldn't make it.

638
00:37:36,266 --> 00:37:37,976
It's no fun going alone.

639
00:37:39,906 --> 00:37:43,607
What? Do you go night
fishing together and stuff?

640
00:37:43,906 --> 00:37:44,976
Do you?

641
00:37:46,647 --> 00:37:47,917
My gosh.

642
00:37:49,116 --> 00:37:51,757
What about that matter?
Were you able to resolve it?

643
00:37:53,056 --> 00:37:54,687
We're still in the process.

644
00:37:56,257 --> 00:37:58,397
Dae Han, what
are you doing here?

645
00:37:59,357 --> 00:38:02,397
Why? Are you curious?

646
00:38:04,266 --> 00:38:07,066
I am fairly close
to her parents.

647
00:38:07,067 --> 00:38:08,806
We are practically a family.

648
00:38:09,467 --> 00:38:11,576
Right?

649
00:38:16,706 --> 00:38:17,706
Mr. Kang.

650
00:38:19,976 --> 00:38:21,886
Can I ask you
something straight up?

651
00:38:23,147 --> 00:38:24,346
Do you like Soo Hyun?

652
00:38:27,786 --> 00:38:29,326
Why would you ask that?

653
00:38:29,487 --> 00:38:32,556
It's okay. It's not
a difficult question.

654
00:38:34,996 --> 00:38:36,897
Yes, I do.

655
00:38:37,527 --> 00:38:39,667
A lot, at that.

656
00:38:44,406 --> 00:38:46,906
- Come on!
- Ouch!

657
00:38:48,076 --> 00:38:50,976
Sorry. Don't mind us.

658
00:38:51,277 --> 00:38:53,616
- Continue with your conversation.
- Go ahead.

659
00:38:55,917 --> 00:38:58,456
Do you like him too?

660
00:39:01,757 --> 00:39:04,087
It's rude to ask her
that kind of thing.

661
00:39:04,656 --> 00:39:06,226
- What about you?
- What do you mean?

662
00:39:06,656 --> 00:39:07,996
Do you have feelings for her?

663
00:39:15,266 --> 00:39:18,277
That's enough. What are
you, high school students?

664
00:39:20,437 --> 00:39:23,346
You two. Go home.

665
00:39:25,547 --> 00:39:27,576
- Me too?
- But chicken...

666
00:39:28,947 --> 00:39:30,347
- How...
- The chicken just came...

667
00:39:32,116 --> 00:39:34,015
Why did you have to
come out of the blue?

668
00:39:34,016 --> 00:39:35,656
The chicken just came out.

669
00:39:38,226 --> 00:39:40,826
Go back home. Please.

670
00:39:45,636 --> 00:39:46,667
Kang Joon Ho.

671
00:39:52,806 --> 00:39:53,937
Why Soo Hyun?

672
00:39:54,877 --> 00:39:55,906
What do you mean?

673
00:39:56,076 --> 00:39:58,217
Why do you have to
like her of all people?

674
00:39:59,947 --> 00:40:01,646
I have no reason...

675
00:40:01,647 --> 00:40:04,147
to ask for your
permission on whom I like.

676
00:40:06,087 --> 00:40:07,087
See you.

677
00:40:08,286 --> 00:40:09,806
Are you going to
run for the election?

678
00:40:12,757 --> 00:40:13,757
No.

679
00:40:15,067 --> 00:40:17,996
I won't. I don't think politics
is the right field for me.

680
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:22,928
How many politicians would
actually think politics is right for them?

681
00:40:23,067 --> 00:40:24,666
There are two
types of politicians.

682
00:40:24,667 --> 00:40:26,976
They do it with a sense
of duty or for power.

683
00:40:27,576 --> 00:40:29,447
If you are not interested,

684
00:40:29,647 --> 00:40:31,887
it means you are not
interested in either duty or power.

685
00:40:32,147 --> 00:40:33,277
Which one are you?

686
00:40:34,076 --> 00:40:36,087
Is it duty or for power?

687
00:40:36,317 --> 00:40:38,286
Of course, it's a sense of duty.

688
00:40:38,616 --> 00:40:41,786
My duty to remove people like
Assemblyman Kang from office.

689
00:40:44,627 --> 00:40:45,656
See you.

690
00:40:46,357 --> 00:40:47,926
It's not true...

691
00:40:49,197 --> 00:40:50,917
that I am not interested
in duty nor power.

692
00:40:53,366 --> 00:40:54,366
Rather...

693
00:40:55,167 --> 00:40:57,567
I just know very well...

694
00:40:59,206 --> 00:41:01,126
what the family of a
politician must go through.

695
00:41:12,717 --> 00:41:14,656
Are you dating that lawyer?

696
00:41:15,226 --> 00:41:16,786
No, I am not.

697
00:41:17,326 --> 00:41:19,996
Then what is it? Are
you not interested in him?

698
00:41:20,297 --> 00:41:23,666
I don't know! I will take
care of my own business.

699
00:41:23,667 --> 00:41:25,496
You focus on the restaurant.

700
00:41:25,967 --> 00:41:27,596
What do you mean you don't know?

701
00:41:28,067 --> 00:41:31,306
He says he likes you. A lot too!

702
00:41:31,536 --> 00:41:34,276
There's no time to waste!
He seems like a great guy.

703
00:41:34,277 --> 00:41:35,606
Just go for it!

704
00:41:35,607 --> 00:41:36,805
- Dad.
- Huh?

705
00:41:36,806 --> 00:41:39,116
You know he is the son of
Assemblyman Kang, right?

706
00:41:39,476 --> 00:41:41,316
You said you didn't like
his father, remember?

707
00:41:42,417 --> 00:41:43,447
Look at her.

708
00:41:43,886 --> 00:41:46,956
When did I ever
say I didn't like him?

709
00:41:47,456 --> 00:41:51,356
We may not agree
on political views,

710
00:41:51,357 --> 00:41:54,796
but it's a completely different
story if he becomes our in-law.

711
00:41:54,797 --> 00:41:56,197
- Am I right?
- Of course.

712
00:41:56,667 --> 00:42:01,607
He is much better-looking
than Assemblyman Kang.

713
00:42:02,007 --> 00:42:05,337
And he seems like a
nicer man than his father.

714
00:42:06,107 --> 00:42:08,107
Why don't you date him
since he likes you already?

715
00:42:08,976 --> 00:42:10,906
Stop getting ahead.

716
00:42:12,746 --> 00:42:13,976
I'll go home.

717
00:42:27,397 --> 00:42:29,467
Yes, I do.

718
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:32,437
A lot, at that.

719
00:42:33,237 --> 00:42:34,896
I have no reason...

720
00:42:34,897 --> 00:42:37,406
to ask for your
permission on whom I like.

721
00:42:52,886 --> 00:42:55,587
("You Are My Sunshine")

722
00:42:59,596 --> 00:43:00,697
What are you going to do?

723
00:43:01,527 --> 00:43:03,326
Now our parents know.

724
00:43:04,397 --> 00:43:05,797
I don't know.

725
00:43:07,266 --> 00:43:11,107
You hesitate to be with him
because of Dae Han, right?

726
00:43:12,036 --> 00:43:14,176
Not true at all.

727
00:43:16,076 --> 00:43:17,147
It's just...

728
00:43:18,576 --> 00:43:20,377
I am worried about Da Jung,

729
00:43:21,987 --> 00:43:24,487
and I am not ready to like
someone so passionately.

730
00:43:26,156 --> 00:43:27,956
I am not sure if I
am ready to date.

731
00:43:29,786 --> 00:43:31,857
Why can't you like
him passionately?

732
00:43:38,996 --> 00:43:40,337
Is it because of me?

733
00:44:27,377 --> 00:44:29,716
(2005)

734
00:44:29,717 --> 00:44:30,717
Hey.

735
00:44:31,487 --> 00:44:34,356
Could you please return
this? Today is the last day.

736
00:44:34,357 --> 00:44:36,225
Why should I? It's not mine.

737
00:44:36,226 --> 00:44:38,357
Come on, it's for your sister.

738
00:44:38,456 --> 00:44:41,726
Not today. I don't feel well.

739
00:44:41,897 --> 00:44:44,697
And most importantly, it's
SHINHWA's comeback today.

740
00:44:45,136 --> 00:44:47,112
You can stop by the
department store on your way out.

741
00:44:47,136 --> 00:44:50,305
I am going to be
late if I drop by.

742
00:44:50,306 --> 00:44:52,475
- Where are you going?
- I am going to see a movie.

743
00:44:52,476 --> 00:44:53,507
With who?

744
00:44:55,107 --> 00:44:56,206
Dae Han.

745
00:44:56,906 --> 00:44:58,616
Really? A date?

746
00:44:59,547 --> 00:45:02,015
I wouldn't call it a date.

747
00:45:02,016 --> 00:45:04,146
He just offered to
show me a movie for...

748
00:45:04,147 --> 00:45:05,316
working hard on that
student declaration.

749
00:45:05,317 --> 00:45:07,156
That is a date!

750
00:45:07,757 --> 00:45:10,556
Fine. I am sorry, SHINHWA.

751
00:45:12,027 --> 00:45:13,156
Give me the bag.

752
00:45:14,627 --> 00:45:17,226
- Here you go.
- Be on your best behavior.

753
00:45:19,366 --> 00:45:23,266
Are you sure you can help me
and give up on your boy band?

754
00:45:23,507 --> 00:45:26,376
What can I do? My only
sister is very bad at dating.

755
00:45:26,377 --> 00:45:28,377
I, the generous sister,
should be the one to help.

756
00:45:28,547 --> 00:45:30,377
- Don't cross the line.
- Then I won't go.

757
00:45:30,706 --> 00:45:31,917
I am so sorry.

758
00:45:32,317 --> 00:45:35,547
Why do you like Dae Han, anyway?

759
00:45:36,116 --> 00:45:37,516
He is good-looking.

760
00:45:37,846 --> 00:45:39,286
And I know you like him a lot.

761
00:45:39,687 --> 00:45:42,456
I am so nervous!

762
00:45:42,687 --> 00:45:44,757
(Theater entrance)

763
00:46:07,176 --> 00:46:08,176
Dae Han.

764
00:46:09,246 --> 00:46:11,346
- Hey.
- Sorry. Did you wait for long?

765
00:46:11,817 --> 00:46:13,756
No. I just got here too.

766
00:46:13,757 --> 00:46:14,757
- Good.
- Good.

767
00:46:15,386 --> 00:46:17,426
Shall we?

768
00:46:23,167 --> 00:46:25,066
I love you for being alive.

769
00:46:25,067 --> 00:46:26,866
Of course, my baby.

770
00:46:48,217 --> 00:46:49,656
That's mine.

771
00:46:50,357 --> 00:46:51,726
What are you doing?

772
00:46:52,357 --> 00:46:54,656
- Sorry.
- What a weird guy.

773
00:47:07,877 --> 00:47:09,975
I had so many
things I wanted to buy.

774
00:47:09,976 --> 00:47:11,076
Let's see.

775
00:47:12,846 --> 00:47:13,947
What is happening?

776
00:47:17,246 --> 00:47:18,886
- I was so surprised!
- What is going on?

777
00:47:20,817 --> 00:47:23,326
Honey, turn on your
phone light! Now!

778
00:47:26,197 --> 00:47:27,425
Look for the emergency bell.

779
00:47:27,426 --> 00:47:29,027
- Where is the emergency bell?
- Hello?

780
00:47:29,297 --> 00:47:30,925
- What's going on?
- Is anyone there?

781
00:47:30,926 --> 00:47:32,466
- Call someone!
- Hello?

782
00:47:32,467 --> 00:47:34,096
- Isn't anyone picking up?
- What?

783
00:47:34,366 --> 00:47:35,635
- What should we do?
- Hello?

784
00:47:35,636 --> 00:47:37,906
(The phone is turned off...)

785
00:47:38,536 --> 00:47:40,507
- Eun Mi!
- What are we going to do?

786
00:47:57,956 --> 00:47:59,757
- It was really sad.
- Right?

787
00:48:01,326 --> 00:48:03,796
I think I drank too much soda.
I need to use the restroom.

788
00:48:03,797 --> 00:48:05,536
- Go ahead. I'll wait here.
- Okay.

789
00:48:12,206 --> 00:48:14,107
(6 Missed Calls.
Ji Hyun 1, Dad 5)

790
00:48:14,706 --> 00:48:16,576
What's going on?

791
00:48:23,487 --> 00:48:24,746
Yes, Dad?

792
00:48:25,817 --> 00:48:26,987
Soo Hyun.

793
00:48:29,357 --> 00:48:30,556
What's wrong, Dad?

794
00:48:31,087 --> 00:48:32,496
Ji Hyun...

795
00:48:35,257 --> 00:48:36,967
Ji Hyun...

796
00:48:38,467 --> 00:48:40,866
went to the department store...

797
00:48:41,667 --> 00:48:44,706
and the elevator crashed down...

798
00:48:49,476 --> 00:48:50,547
Soo Hyun.

799
00:48:52,116 --> 00:48:53,176
Soo Hyun?

800
00:48:55,386 --> 00:48:57,047
Soo Hyun, open the door.

801
00:48:57,786 --> 00:49:00,217
Open the door!

802
00:49:06,926 --> 00:49:11,197
How are we supposed to
go on if you act like this too?

803
00:49:14,167 --> 00:49:16,937
Soo Hyun, open the door!

804
00:49:17,467 --> 00:49:21,437
What do we do?

805
00:49:22,706 --> 00:49:24,507
Soo Hyun!

806
00:49:24,777 --> 00:49:28,377
We need to go on
with our lives, don't we?

807
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:32,487
Soo Hyun, open the door!

808
00:49:49,636 --> 00:49:50,737
(View Message)

809
00:49:51,107 --> 00:49:55,377
(I got the refund! It's all thanks to
me if it works out with Dae Han.)

810
00:50:21,797 --> 00:50:24,237
Sales are low at my dad's
restaurant, so I need to work.

811
00:50:25,337 --> 00:50:27,277
I'll be taking
next semester off.

812
00:50:30,206 --> 00:50:33,047
Is that why you didn't show
up for the student council?

813
00:50:33,547 --> 00:50:34,717
Yes.

814
00:50:36,487 --> 00:50:39,217
How bad is it?

815
00:50:41,616 --> 00:50:44,156
I don't think I have
to explain that to you.

816
00:50:50,467 --> 00:50:53,036
I came here because you
kept calling and texting me,

817
00:50:55,197 --> 00:50:57,067
but I hope you won't
call me anymore.

818
00:50:59,206 --> 00:51:00,406
Even if you do...

819
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:03,846
I won't be answering.

820
00:51:08,547 --> 00:51:09,616
Soo Hyun.

821
00:51:12,357 --> 00:51:15,656
Did I do something wrong?

822
00:51:20,757 --> 00:51:22,197
It's not like that.

823
00:51:23,326 --> 00:51:26,206
I hate it when people want to be by
my side when I'm having a hard time.

824
00:51:27,167 --> 00:51:28,266
I have to go.

825
00:51:42,286 --> 00:51:44,217
It still makes me sad.

826
00:51:46,461 --> 00:51:49,600
I realized how influential
those mommy websites are.

827
00:51:49,930 --> 00:51:51,076
That's why the store owners...

828
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:53,460
don't have a chance against
the people who run those sites.

829
00:51:53,970 --> 00:51:56,671
I can't go around
meeting all those mothers.

830
00:51:57,941 --> 00:52:01,980
I'll make full use of the sites to
boost support for the apartments.

831
00:52:01,981 --> 00:52:04,009
Love Inju is the
biggest one, right?

832
00:52:04,010 --> 00:52:07,020
I think so. The host, Inju Mom,

833
00:52:07,021 --> 00:52:08,551
is Jae Hoon's mom, for sure.

834
00:52:09,790 --> 00:52:12,760
I guess she used it to
control public opinion.

835
00:52:13,421 --> 00:52:14,620
I guess so.

836
00:52:14,990 --> 00:52:18,059
There might be better
websites if we look hard enough.

837
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:20,560
Why don't we win
them over to our side?

838
00:52:25,401 --> 00:52:27,140
(Shut up and fry!)

839
00:52:28,301 --> 00:52:30,810
What's this?

840
00:52:31,341 --> 00:52:32,440
What's going on?

841
00:52:32,441 --> 00:52:36,611
I put up a post to explain
the situation and it got deleted!

842
00:52:36,751 --> 00:52:37,849
What?

843
00:52:37,850 --> 00:52:40,980
Is she running it
however she wants to...

844
00:52:40,981 --> 00:52:42,790
just because she's
the site manager?

845
00:52:42,990 --> 00:52:45,719
If they're only going to
keep the posts they like,

846
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:47,321
why run a community website?

847
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:49,790
I can't stand it anymore.

848
00:52:49,961 --> 00:52:52,460
I'll go and take that
woman's fingers...

849
00:52:52,461 --> 00:52:56,070
Hey, wait. You
better hold it in, dear.

850
00:52:56,071 --> 00:52:58,099
Please keep your
fists to yourself.

851
00:52:58,100 --> 00:52:59,739
Darn it!

852
00:52:59,740 --> 00:53:01,970
Sit down.

853
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:04,640
Wait a minute...

854
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:07,039
Wi D Han doesn't care
about students or parents...

855
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:08,880
and only looks out
for his daughter.

856
00:53:08,881 --> 00:53:10,509
Why, that little...

857
00:53:10,510 --> 00:53:11,880
- What is it?
- Why?

858
00:53:11,881 --> 00:53:13,150
- What is it?
- What's going on?

859
00:53:13,151 --> 00:53:14,950
What is it?

860
00:53:15,021 --> 00:53:17,151
He says he cares
for the residents,

861
00:53:17,251 --> 00:53:19,420
but he couldn't even
handle his own child...

862
00:53:19,421 --> 00:53:21,461
and a teenager got pregnant.

863
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:24,461
Not only that, but she's
still going to attend school.

864
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:26,630
He doesn't care about the
stress our kids will be getting,

865
00:53:26,631 --> 00:53:29,231
especially when they should
be focusing on their studies.

866
00:53:29,631 --> 00:53:32,401
The dad and the daughter
are both so annoying!

867
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:34,070
Why, that little...

868
00:53:34,071 --> 00:53:36,510
How could she say that?

869
00:53:36,841 --> 00:53:38,040
Gosh!

870
00:53:41,481 --> 00:53:42,950
(Lawyer Kang)

871
00:53:43,751 --> 00:53:46,981
If you have time tonight,
will you accept my battle?

872
00:53:47,551 --> 00:53:49,720
What are you trying to do?

873
00:53:50,290 --> 00:53:52,321
Stop that!

874
00:53:53,990 --> 00:53:55,361
(Da Jung)

875
00:53:55,990 --> 00:53:58,860
Soo Hyun, are you free tonight?

876
00:53:58,861 --> 00:54:00,660
Darn it!

877
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:02,301
(Lawyer Kang Joon Ho)

878
00:54:07,801 --> 00:54:11,540
I'm sorry. I have
plans tonight as well.

879
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:13,510
I'll accept the
battle another time.

880
00:54:19,251 --> 00:54:20,481
That's so cool.

881
00:54:20,751 --> 00:54:23,719
You're amazing.
Why are you so good?

882
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:25,890
Go away.

883
00:54:26,461 --> 00:54:27,560
I'm sorry.

884
00:54:29,461 --> 00:54:31,360
Just watch if you want to.

885
00:54:31,361 --> 00:54:32,700
Just don't get too close to me.

886
00:54:33,260 --> 00:54:35,700
All right. I'll just
get close enough.

887
00:54:37,531 --> 00:54:40,171
Hey, what does BLP mean?

888
00:54:40,540 --> 00:54:41,540
What?

889
00:54:41,541 --> 00:54:44,139
I heard Hwang Soo
Hyun calling you BLP.

890
00:54:44,140 --> 00:54:45,240
What is that?

891
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:48,810
Our family receives
a basic living pension.

892
00:54:48,841 --> 00:54:50,151
It's short for that.

893
00:54:51,950 --> 00:54:54,120
Doesn't that even make you mad?

894
00:54:57,091 --> 00:54:59,220
- Move over. Get out.
- Okay.

895
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:02,360
Hey, BLP. Did you make a friend?

896
00:55:02,361 --> 00:55:03,861
You two look close.

897
00:55:05,830 --> 00:55:08,531
Hey. I heard your
sister got pregnant.

898
00:55:09,671 --> 00:55:10,770
Shut it.

899
00:55:10,771 --> 00:55:13,739
You have a stranger for a dad...

900
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:15,340
and a pregnant teenage sister?

901
00:55:15,341 --> 00:55:17,340
What a messed up family!

902
00:55:17,341 --> 00:55:19,281
That's so messed up.

903
00:55:19,341 --> 00:55:20,780
I said, shut it.

904
00:55:20,781 --> 00:55:23,280
BLP and Messed Up Family.

905
00:55:23,281 --> 00:55:26,021
You suit each other so well.

906
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:36,559
It's working!

907
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:38,159
Gosh!

908
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:39,861
You look so great on screen.

909
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:42,199
- Move your head back.
- Okay.

910
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:43,901
See?

911
00:55:44,470 --> 00:55:47,239
Do you think this will work?

912
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:49,711
It won't hurt to try, Dad.

913
00:55:49,910 --> 00:55:53,440
It could be a hit and promote
your restaurant as well.

914
00:55:53,441 --> 00:55:57,550
It feels weird to have the
camera observing me, though.

915
00:55:57,551 --> 00:55:58,849
- Right?
- Yes.

916
00:55:58,850 --> 00:56:01,949
I get nervous in front
of the camera too.

917
00:56:01,950 --> 00:56:05,150
Don't worry about it and act
naturally. Pretend it doesn't exist.

918
00:56:05,151 --> 00:56:06,420
- All right.
- Okay.

919
00:56:06,421 --> 00:56:07,860
- Good luck!
- Good luck!

920
00:56:07,861 --> 00:56:09,260
- Good luck!
- Good luck!

921
00:56:11,430 --> 00:56:13,059
You have to keep
your head far away.

922
00:56:13,060 --> 00:56:15,031
Oh, far away?

923
00:56:16,430 --> 00:56:17,830
Hello.

924
00:56:18,031 --> 00:56:20,639
Let me talk to you about
our fried chicken restaurant.

925
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:23,639
We received three stars...

926
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:25,039
which is the highest
hygiene rating in Inju City...

927
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:26,340
What are you doing?

928
00:56:26,341 --> 00:56:28,910
Try to sound natural!

929
00:56:30,410 --> 00:56:33,321
What are you doing? You
don't have your gloves...

930
00:56:34,551 --> 00:56:38,550
on, sir. You must be so
nervous that you forgot.

931
00:56:38,551 --> 00:56:39,989
Oh, yes.

932
00:56:39,990 --> 00:56:42,659
I usually always put gloves on.

933
00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:44,429
Are you doing some
kind of comedy act?

934
00:56:44,430 --> 00:56:46,429
Try to act natural, will you?

935
00:56:46,430 --> 00:56:48,861
Okay. Wait.

936
00:56:49,801 --> 00:56:52,699
No, this could be their concept.

937
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:53,941
It's hilarious.

938
00:56:54,001 --> 00:56:56,270
They're going to get
a ton of views like this.

939
00:56:56,271 --> 00:56:57,739
You're right.

940
00:56:57,740 --> 00:56:59,710
Just go on. It's great.

941
00:56:59,711 --> 00:57:01,140
You're going to be a hit. Go on.

942
00:57:01,740 --> 00:57:02,781
Okay.

943
00:57:03,510 --> 00:57:05,409
After mixing it nicely...

944
00:57:05,410 --> 00:57:06,780
Here.

945
00:57:06,781 --> 00:57:07,850
Then...

946
00:57:07,981 --> 00:57:09,150
(I'll tune in next time too)

947
00:57:09,151 --> 00:57:11,850
We will fry the chicken.

948
00:57:12,921 --> 00:57:16,930
You must be careful
not to fry your fingers.

949
00:57:17,390 --> 00:57:18,390
Oh my.

950
00:57:18,930 --> 00:57:20,460
Thus,

951
00:57:20,461 --> 00:57:22,730
we will start
frying the chicken.

952
00:57:22,731 --> 00:57:25,731
- Just fry them already.
- Okay.

953
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:30,210
That's right. Dae Han.

954
00:57:30,211 --> 00:57:31,211
Yes?

955
00:57:31,310 --> 00:57:34,509
Inju Mom posted
on the website...

956
00:57:34,510 --> 00:57:37,010
about Da Jung staying in school.

957
00:57:37,881 --> 00:57:38,910
She did?

958
00:57:41,281 --> 00:57:45,350
Seriously. This woman is
determined to ruin me. Darn it.

959
00:57:45,790 --> 00:57:46,890
What will you do?

960
00:57:47,421 --> 00:57:50,160
What else? I'll have to give
her a taste of her own medicine.

961
00:57:50,660 --> 00:57:52,260
Why that woman...

962
00:57:58,071 --> 00:57:59,099
(Tak's teacher)

963
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:00,240
It's Tak's teacher.

964
00:58:02,970 --> 00:58:04,040
Hello?

965
00:58:04,611 --> 00:58:07,111
(Sunghan Hospital)

966
00:58:10,381 --> 00:58:13,050
Don't make things
worse, and stay quiet.

967
00:58:13,051 --> 00:58:15,281
I'll take care of it. Okay?

968
00:58:26,131 --> 00:58:28,461
Hello, ma'am. You must
have been so scared.

969
00:58:29,731 --> 00:58:30,771
I'm sorry.

970
00:58:36,810 --> 00:58:39,341
I was so surprised when I
got the call from their teacher.

971
00:58:39,781 --> 00:58:42,010
You must have been
incredibly shocked.

972
00:58:43,180 --> 00:58:44,281
I'm terribly sorry.

973
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:49,381
Is Jae Hoon okay?

974
00:58:50,251 --> 00:58:51,821
Do I look okay to you?

975
00:58:53,290 --> 00:58:55,790
My gosh. Jae Hoon.

976
00:58:56,330 --> 00:58:57,490
You poor thing.

977
00:58:57,790 --> 00:58:59,191
Look at this cast.

978
00:58:59,901 --> 00:59:00,961
I'm sorry.

979
00:59:01,501 --> 00:59:02,699
What are you doing?

980
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:04,770
Apologize to Jae Hoon
and his mom. Now!

981
00:59:04,771 --> 00:59:05,930
You said to stay still.

982
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:09,240
What?

983
00:59:11,010 --> 00:59:13,539
I meant don't say
anything stupid.

984
00:59:13,540 --> 00:59:15,260
You should apologize.
Your friend got hurt.

985
00:59:15,381 --> 00:59:16,510
Go on.

986
00:59:18,711 --> 00:59:19,720
Sorry.

987
00:59:20,151 --> 00:59:21,580
I'm speechless.

988
00:59:22,021 --> 00:59:25,321
Hey. Do you expect us to
believe you're actually sorry?

989
00:59:26,390 --> 00:59:27,990
What are you doing? Do it right.

990
00:59:28,521 --> 00:59:29,560
Now.

991
00:59:29,830 --> 00:59:32,691
Look at him, Mom. He looks like
he wants to stab me in this leg too.

992
00:59:33,461 --> 00:59:35,660
Are you trying to kill someone?

993
00:59:35,961 --> 00:59:39,539
A jerk like him belongs
in juvie, not at a school.

994
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:40,740
Ma'am.

995
00:59:44,271 --> 00:59:45,271
What are you doing?

996
00:59:45,272 --> 00:59:47,640
Ma'am, it's my fault.

997
00:59:47,981 --> 00:59:51,051
I should've taught him
better as his father. I'm sorry.

998
00:59:51,481 --> 00:59:54,150
I'll discipline him well so
this never happens again.

999
00:59:54,151 --> 00:59:57,091
So, please. Please
forgive him just this once.

1000
00:59:57,620 --> 00:59:58,620
I'm sorry.

1001
00:59:59,961 --> 01:00:02,590
Hey, kid. What do
you think you're doing?

1002
01:00:02,591 --> 01:00:03,929
Your dad is on his knees.

1003
01:00:03,930 --> 01:00:05,430
I know I wasn't right,

1004
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:07,759
but that jerk insulted my
family, called another kid BLP,

1005
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:09,231
and made me lose my temper.

1006
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:11,801
How dare you raise
your voice at me?

1007
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:13,640
He was right.

1008
01:00:13,771 --> 01:00:16,211
Your family is messed up.
What's wrong with saying that?

1009
01:00:16,410 --> 01:00:17,810
And what? BLP?

1010
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:20,680
That stands for basic
living pension, right?

1011
01:00:21,180 --> 01:00:23,780
You kids abbreviate just about
everything, so why not that?

1012
01:00:23,781 --> 01:00:26,111
- Look here, ma'am!
- Oh my gosh.

1013
01:00:26,450 --> 01:00:28,020
You can't even keep
your kid in check.

1014
01:00:28,021 --> 01:00:29,281
How dare you yell at me?

1015
01:00:29,990 --> 01:00:33,060
You're right, I can't
keep my kid in check.

1016
01:00:33,490 --> 01:00:35,789
But clearly, you're just as bad.

1017
01:00:35,790 --> 01:00:36,830
What was that?

1018
01:00:37,330 --> 01:00:39,130
Like father like son.

1019
01:00:39,131 --> 01:00:40,401
That's right.

1020
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:43,071
Tak can't stand
injustice, just like me.

1021
01:00:43,671 --> 01:00:45,099
I guess Jae Hoon
takes after you...

1022
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:47,699
and likes to divide people
and attack the weak.

1023
01:00:47,700 --> 01:00:50,410
- Are you done?
- No, far from it.

1024
01:00:51,271 --> 01:00:52,771
You're Inju Mom, aren't you?

1025
01:00:53,481 --> 01:00:55,257
The one who posted the nasty
post about the chicken restaurant.

1026
01:00:55,281 --> 01:00:57,809
- Why are you changing the topic?
- It's the same topic.

1027
01:00:57,810 --> 01:01:00,080
They're both about mom and
son slandering other people.

1028
01:01:01,021 --> 01:01:02,251
Fine.

1029
01:01:03,021 --> 01:01:05,020
Tak will take responsibility
for the assault.

1030
01:01:05,021 --> 01:01:08,990
But you will have to take
responsibility for posting lies.

1031
01:01:16,830 --> 01:01:17,830
I'm sorry.

1032
01:01:20,341 --> 01:01:21,740
I'm speechless.

1033
01:01:25,740 --> 01:01:27,981
Why didn't you
tell me that sooner?

1034
01:01:29,881 --> 01:01:30,981
Did you ask?

1035
01:01:33,220 --> 01:01:35,651
Anyway, whatever the
situation, you can't assault people.

1036
01:01:36,551 --> 01:01:39,921
Assault is the lowest
way of expressing rage.

1037
01:01:40,490 --> 01:01:42,170
You're not even my
dad. Stop lecturing me.

1038
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:43,790
What was that?

1039
01:01:44,531 --> 01:01:46,190
If you want to act
like an old fogy,

1040
01:01:46,191 --> 01:01:47,631
have your own
kid and do it to him.

1041
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:52,430
Tak. Hey, kid.

1042
01:01:57,111 --> 01:01:59,010
(Studio apartments)

1043
01:02:12,521 --> 01:02:13,990
This is where he
has been living?

1044
01:02:18,490 --> 01:02:19,490
Jung.

1045
01:02:24,301 --> 01:02:25,330
What happened?

1046
01:02:26,771 --> 01:02:27,870
What happened to your foot?

1047
01:02:30,510 --> 01:02:33,410
I hurt my foot while working.

1048
01:02:33,781 --> 01:02:34,910
It's nothing serious.

1049
01:02:43,450 --> 01:02:46,220
Anyway, what brings you here?

1050
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:49,160
What...

1051
01:02:50,131 --> 01:02:52,930
Why didn't you tell me
you were living like this?

1052
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:57,700
Jung. I'm really okay.

1053
01:02:58,330 --> 01:03:00,441
This place is
nicer than it looks.

1054
01:03:01,941 --> 01:03:03,370
It's so nice and cozy.

1055
01:03:05,810 --> 01:03:07,509
Keep it down!

1056
01:03:07,510 --> 01:03:10,611
See? I can't sleep
well by myself,

1057
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:14,251
but I sleep really well here because
it's like they're sleeping with me.

1058
01:03:20,021 --> 01:03:22,461
Let's not do this here.

1059
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:24,531
Let's go home and
have dinner together.

1060
01:03:40,341 --> 01:03:42,040
Darn it. Who is it?

1061
01:03:44,350 --> 01:03:45,450
Who is this?

1062
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:55,091
How could we make someone
who's injured live there alone?

1063
01:03:56,691 --> 01:03:58,660
What other choice do we have?

1064
01:03:58,830 --> 01:04:01,390
It's already overcrowded with
the kids. There's no room for him.

1065
01:04:02,001 --> 01:04:03,031
No.

1066
01:04:03,830 --> 01:04:06,200
Don't mind me. I'm totally fine.

1067
01:04:06,870 --> 01:04:08,240
You always say you're fine.

1068
01:04:08,870 --> 01:04:11,810
- I want to live with Jung Woo.
- Me too.

1069
01:04:12,111 --> 01:04:13,910
No.

1070
01:04:18,651 --> 01:04:20,350
And Jung Woo isn't
the problem right now.

1071
01:04:21,521 --> 01:04:22,550
Then?

1072
01:04:22,551 --> 01:04:25,321
The school violence committee
is meeting today because of Tak.

1073
01:04:26,691 --> 01:04:28,720
He may be forced
to transfer out.

1074
01:04:29,461 --> 01:04:30,660
That punk.

1075
01:04:31,560 --> 01:04:33,961
Da Jung, you're in
no position to talk.

1076
01:04:34,100 --> 01:04:35,301
You're just as bad.

1077
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:41,880
Here comes the man of the hour.

1078
01:04:42,870 --> 01:04:45,010
You haven't eaten
yet, right? Come eat.

1079
01:04:47,140 --> 01:04:48,140
Come in.

1080
01:04:49,611 --> 01:04:50,680
Is someone here?

1081
01:04:55,421 --> 01:04:56,950
- Daddy!
- Daddy!

1082
01:05:13,001 --> 01:05:15,801
Hello, I'm Han Dong
Nam. I'm their dad.

1083
01:05:54,140 --> 01:05:57,680
(The Great Show)

1084
01:05:58,651 --> 01:06:01,580
You are Da Jung's
biological dad, right?

1085
01:06:01,921 --> 01:06:03,850
He's very suspicious.

1086
01:06:04,021 --> 01:06:06,420
That spoon and
chopsticks are Mr. Wi's.

1087
01:06:06,421 --> 01:06:08,190
It's all the same thing.

1088
01:06:08,191 --> 01:06:10,660
He's a total thief. All
he needs is a knife.

1089
01:06:10,731 --> 01:06:11,759
1,000 dollars?

1090
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:13,760
I'm so glad you're with me.

1091
01:06:14,100 --> 01:06:15,400
What's going on here?

1092
01:06:15,401 --> 01:06:16,430
(Kim Hye Jin)

1093
01:06:16,671 --> 01:06:18,099
I want to be the best.

1094
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:20,099
Tak stabbed his
friend in the leg.

1095
01:06:20,100 --> 01:06:21,570
It's better than being hit.

1096
01:06:21,571 --> 01:06:23,100
I'm regretting it deeply.

1097
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:25,240
Can't you be our dad,
not just our guardian?
