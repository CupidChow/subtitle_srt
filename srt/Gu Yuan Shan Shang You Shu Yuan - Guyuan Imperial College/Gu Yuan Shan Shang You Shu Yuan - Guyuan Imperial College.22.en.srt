1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,040
1。

2
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:20,000
Eat it.

3
00:00:20,839 --> 00:00:22,160
Eat it.

4
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:23,719
Do you like it or not?

5
00:00:23,719 --> 00:00:24,800
If you don't eat, you'll be hungry,

6
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:27,440
arm

7
00:00:27,559 --> 00:00:27,960
It hurts,

8
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:28,480
Be careful.

9
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,519
Watch your arm.

10
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:32,640
Then tell me, how do you want to eat?

11
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:45,359
Heaven and earth are black and yellow, the universe is wild,

12
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:48,719
the sun and the moon are full, the sun and the moon are bright, the nights and nights are on the list,

13
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:49,520
So annoying.

14
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,479
I don't know when your arm will heal.

15
00:00:54,759 --> 00:00:56,520
I've been sickly since I was a child,

16
00:00:56,679 --> 00:00:58,759
so I should recover slowly.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,200
Let Master Feng show it to you again.

18
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:02,840
It's okay.

19
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,519
Don't disturb him.

20
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:08,840
When will my escort come to an end?

21
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:13,640
I'm not in a hurry.

22
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:14,879
Why are you so anxious?

23
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:24,200
Is Heaven and Earth Xuanhuang Cosmic Wild Soup

24
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,239
ready?

25
00:01:25,239 --> 00:01:25,959
Go and have a look.

26
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:26,519
Yes.

27
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,200
Wait for me. I'll be back soon.

28
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:34,159
It's killing me.

29
00:01:34,359 --> 00:01:35,359
Wen Qi,

30
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,480
how did you recover?

31
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,840
Wen Qi.

32
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,000
Goodbye,

33
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,599
That's embarrassing,

34
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:56,680
Tang,

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,840
Wen,

36
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,920
Stand up.

37
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:06,799
Brother Qi,

38
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:08,439
help me think of a way.

39
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:09,879
What should I do?

40
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,039
What should I do?

41
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:12,280
Hey, hey, hey.

42
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:13,840
What should I tell her?

43
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,800
You pretended to be sick and lied.

44
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:19,360
It's because Brother Li secretly told me

45
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,599
that...... he might be going back to the northwest.

46
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,680
Why didn't you just tell her?

47
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,080
I'm afraid she'll worry about me.

48
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:27,719
You see,

49
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,080
she always said I was melodramatic,

50
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:30,680
Actually, she thinks more than anyone else.

51
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:33,919
What are you two talking about?

52
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:34,879
You're here.

53
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,039
Don't be angry, okay?

54
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,520
See you at the back door

55
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:43,560
after class tonight,

56
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,120
I need to talk to you.

57
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:52,400
So,

58
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:53,800
she forgave me.

59
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,120
These men and women

60
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,400
are both real and false.

61
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,639
Sister Wu,

62
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:07,000
Sister Wu,

63
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,479
What are you thinking?

64
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,240
Don't worry.

65
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,560
Leave this place to us tonight.

66
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,719
That's not what I'm worried about.

67
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:17,080
Are you thinking,

68
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,280
how do you tell Tang Wenqi?

69
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:20,800
About you leaving?

70
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,560
Then.

71
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,000
What's your plan?

72
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:28,400
I'm still not going to tell him.

73
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,759
If you don't tell me,

74
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,560
you won't be so sad.

75
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:35,120
You're right,

76
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,199
but you have to leave after all.

77
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,199
That's why

78
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:41,439
I want to say goodbye to him.

79
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,400
Don't worry.

80
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:44,439
I'm sure it'll be fine.

81
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:45,879
I promise.

82
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:47,919
Today is the most unforgettable day for you.

83
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:50,520
Thank you, Ling Xiu.

84
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,319
By the way,

85
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,840
So,

86
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,439
about Tang Wenqi pretending to be sick,

87
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:56,599
Aren't you angry?

88
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,120
Why?

89
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,360
anyway

90
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:05,199
I also want to stay with him for a while.

91
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,479
If you can stay for a while, you can stay for a while.

92
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,319
You asked me to come here in the middle of the night.

93
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:22,000
I don't know what I want to do.

94
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,600
Tang Wenqi,

95
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:31,160
do you still remember that place.

96
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,279
remember

97
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:46,040
The place

98
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:48,399
where you blew me up.

99
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:53,480
You called me out in the middle of the night,

100
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:54,680
just to talk about this,

101
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:56,399
Or

102
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,199
are you going to explode again?

103
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:01,680
What are you thinking?

104
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:04,079
What are you doing?

105
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,120
Watch carefully.

106
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,319
Three,

107
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:10,560
Two,

108
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:11,839
One.

109
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,360
At our place,

110
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,839
write your wish in the lamp.

111
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:34,920
And then put it in the sky.

112
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,800
It will come true.

113
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,560
I will.

114
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,759
I really hope that

115
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,519
all our wishes can come true.

116
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:02,680
Of course I will.

117
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:08,879
If one day I'm gone,

118
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,600
will you think of me?

119
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,560
Of course I will.

120
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,720
When will you think of me

121
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:21,759
eating,

122
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,000
Sleep,

123
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:25,519
go to class,

124
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:28,160
I think

125
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,920
I'm used to it.

126
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:32,680
I have you by my side all the time.

127
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,360
I can come here.

128
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:41,759
I'm lucky

129
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,959
to have met you.

130
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,920
Luckily, I'm the one.

131
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:52,120
What will you do

132
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:55,120
if one day you can't find me?

133
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,120
I'll keep looking,

134
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,519
keep looking,

135
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:04,920
No matter where you go,

136
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,720
no matter what you're doing,

137
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:10,279
I'll always be there for you.

138
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,439
I'll be with you.

139
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,480
You.

140
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,839
I'm not clean anymore.

141
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,759
I'm dirty.

142
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,920
It won't be clean after a kiss.

143
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:54,120
Help!

144
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:05,000
Three,

145
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:06,120
Two,

146
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:07,800
One.

147
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,399
You're the girl I like.

148
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,360
Wu...

149
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,480
I like you.
