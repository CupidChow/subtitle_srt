1
00:00:20,679 --> 00:00:22,000
You ingrate.

2
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:23,879
You two can play by yourself.

3
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:25,719
I'm the only one who's redundant.

4
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:29,640
I knew it.

5
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,440
You scared the hell

6
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,479
out of me. Why are you mumbling here alone?

7
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:35,679
Nothing.

8
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,719
You two can play by yourself.

9
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:40,359
I'm just an extra.

10
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,399
Why are you asking?

11
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,600
I knew you were angry again.

12
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,000
What do you mean again?

13
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:48,320
I got it.

14
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:52,479
Are you angry because Qi Shan and I have a better relationship?

15
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:57,000
So,

16
00:00:57,399 --> 00:00:58,600
you like me,

17
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,359
What are you talking about?

18
00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:02,159
We're both men.

19
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,760
Then why don't you twist?

20
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,120
Forget it.

21
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:08,560
You won't understand.

22
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:10,480
Why don't I understand?

23
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,439
I got it.

24
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:16,640
You like

25
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:17,359
Qi Shan,

26
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:18,680
What?

27
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:20,680
What are you thinking?

28
00:01:22,359 --> 00:01:24,200
You stood up for him today.

29
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:25,799
You even took him for treatment,

30
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,799
but you get jealous when I ask about him.

31
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,799
If it's not love, what is it?

32
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,959
Admit it if you like him.

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,760
Okay, I'm begging you, okay?

34
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:35,400
Can you leave me alone for a while?

35
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:36,359
Tell me about it.

36
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:37,359
What are you talking about?

37
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,280
Go now.

38
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:39,760
Tell me about it.

39
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:40,920
If you don't leave, I'll leave.

40
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:44,640
Shy.

41
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,879
You're stubborn.

42
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,799
This pair is such a good match.

43
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,680
What's your name?

44
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:00,239
Smell the chicken and dance.

45
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:03,840
I'm so smart.

46
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,960
Brother Qi asked me to take you to change your dressing.

47
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,560
The sun is on the west side.

48
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,039
Don't you have classes to attend?

49
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,120
I'll be back as soon as I get you there.

50
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:20,319
That's fine.

51
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:23,280
Don't say I'm delaying your class.

52
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:25,439
Stop competing with E Fei.

53
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:26,479
He's a reckless man.

54
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:28,280
It's not worth getting hurt because of him.

55
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,520
I can't let him bully Brother Qi.

56
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,280
Anyway, don't do this in the future.

57
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,680
It's not good for you.

58
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:36,479
I see. Let's go.

59
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:41,919
It hurts.

60
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,080
You're a girl. Why are you

61
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,199
fighting with a boy?

62
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:48,639
I'm bored to death.

63
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,280
What girl?

64
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,719
I'm a man.

65
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:57,199
No matter how old and foolish I am,

66
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:00,800
I still can't figure out the pulse of men and women.

67
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:02,960
What a girl

68
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:03,879
Husband,

69
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:05,080
Master,

70
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,960
don't tell Mr. Shan, okay?

71
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:09,439
Then you have to come up with a reason.

72
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,520
Why else would I risk helping you?

73
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,080
I can't tell him that I did it to get explosives.

74
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:16,599
Blow yourself up.

75
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,560
Me,

76
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,159
I just want to study.

77
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,280
Can't you read it yourself at home?

78
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:24,319
Why do you have to study

79
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,000
in the school like a man?

80
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,120
Who says reading is a man's right?

81
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:29,680
In our place,

82
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:30,879
men and women learn together,

83
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,840
When we study together,

84
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:37,919
how come I've never heard of such rules in the northwest?

85
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:41,080
If you just want to have such a place,

86
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:43,240
you can tell me about it.

87
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,319
In our place,

88
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:46,639
women can study,

89
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,439
And you can do whatever you want.

90
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:50,520
Besides,

91
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:52,400
men are born to women.

92
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,599
Her courage and strength are given by women.

93
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,039
Why can't I read a book here?

94
00:03:58,599 --> 00:03:59,439
In fact,

95
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,439
women are no worse than men.

96
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,840
So you're willing to keep it a secret for me.

97
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,319
What you said

98
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,319
really convinced me.

99
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,719
Give me a high five.

100
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,519
This is a way to express happiness.

101
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,319
This is also the rule there.

102
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,199
Come on

103
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:22,279
High-fiving

104
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,639
is a quick way to learn.

105
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:28,920
All right.

106
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:30,639
I've changed the medicine.

107
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:32,800
Go back and get some rest.

108
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,120
Remember,

109
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:38,759
be careful.

110
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,000
Don't give yourself away.

111
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,319
Got it, old man?

112
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:45,079
What?

113
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,720
Little old man,

114
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:49,120
Brother Wu,

115
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:50,439
Do you want to take a bath with me?

116
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,839
Yeah, go get some fun.

117
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,240
I don't need to go.

118
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:55,120
Since you entered school,

119
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,279
I haven't seen you take a shower.

120
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:56,920
You dirty thing,

121
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,199
I just like to wash it before going to bed.

122
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,759
I just went a little later than you.

123
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:01,839
Wen Qi,

124
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,040
cut the crap.

125
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,639
Brother Wu will be there later.

126
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:05,920
However,

127
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:07,480
the bathhouse ran out of hot water later,

128
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,319
Brother Wu, do you always bathe in cold water?

129
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,720
I have a strong sense of yang.

130
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,959
I like to take cold baths,

131
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,480
I can't freeze you to death.

132
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,560
None of your business.

133
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,480
Nobody cares about you.

134
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,600
I'm really

135
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,519
… Alright, alright.

136
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,120
What's wrong with you two?

137
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:21,240
Every time you say only three sentences, you start quarreling.

138
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,199
I'm too lazy to talk to him.

139
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:28,600
I heard that there is a hot spring on the mountainside,

140
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:29,839
which is very comfortable.

141
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,879
And it has nourishing effect.

142
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:34,319
The most important thing is that few people know about it.

143
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:35,759
Why don't we

144
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:37,000
go together some other day.

145
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,720
Who wants to go with you guys?

146
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,639
You wish.

147
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,079
Childe Wu

148
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:51,680
only likes to take cold baths,

149
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:52,199
You.

150
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:52,800
Wen Qi,

151
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,240
Childe Tang is right,

152
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,279
I won't go with you.

153
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,160
Brother Wu,

154
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,560
whether you want to go or not.

155
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:17,920
It's so comfortable.

156
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,240
Hot bath.

157
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,519
I miss you so much.

158
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:29,839
Lingxiu, you … Why don't you make any noise when you

159
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:32,240
walk?

160
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,399
You're a woman,

161
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:34,680
why should I make a sound?

162
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:37,079
You saw it.

163
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,399
I know it even if I don't look at it.

164
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,600
Now that you know it,

165
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,240
I'll open my mouth to wash it.

166
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,240
By the way,

167
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,040
I heard from father that,

168
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:47,319
You know a place

169
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,439
where girls can go to school too,

170
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:49,720
That's right.

171
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,360
I want to go there too.

172
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:52,879
What?

173
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,079
You want to study too?

174
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:56,800
But your father is so open-minded,

175
00:06:56,879 --> 00:06:58,240
there's no reason not to let you go.

176
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,120
It's a rule that women don't go to school,

177
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,839
but I've also read books,

178
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:04,720
I'm just curious about life in the Academy.

179
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,480
This is not a rule.

180
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:07,800
Lingxiu,

181
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:08,839
is that you?

182
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:09,839
Why would anyone do that?

183
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:11,240
Oh, no. It's E.

184
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:13,079
Come up and hug me.

185
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:14,240
Lingxiu,

186
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,639
don't come over. I'm taking a shower.

187
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:18,920
Tell me,

188
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:19,839
why did you come to see me?

189
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,480
Well,

190
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,519
I want to ask you,

191
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,959
About the trip down the mountain I told you last time,

192
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:26,439
what have you thought about it?

193
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,120
No.

194
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:28,199
Don't refuse to go.

195
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:29,160
Sister Ling Xiu,

196
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:30,120
as you know,

197
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:31,279
I've liked you for a long time.

198
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:32,680
All right, stop it.

199
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,240
I've already turned you down.

200
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:35,959
Why are you staring at me all the time?

201
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,639
Let me explain.

202
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,439
What

203
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:42,959
are you two doing?

204
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:43,959
This is inappropriate.

205
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,160
You saw it.

206
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,319
Wu Wancheng,

207
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:47,279
get up here!

208
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:47,959
Me

209
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,959
All right, leave now.

210
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,560
Thank you, Ling Xiu.

211
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:03,560
Don't rush to say thank you.

212
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:06,959
Your womanhood is hidden for the time being,

213
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,560
But I'm afraid you'll have a hard time

214
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,519
in Guyuan Academy in the future.

215
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:12,560
You must be more careful.

216
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:15,360
Luckily, I don't have much contact with E Fei.

217
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:16,680
He should be fine.

218
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:19,800
What did you say?

219
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:22,319
Master Hong

220
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:24,000
will be late for Cuju training when he goes out

221
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,439
and the senior will take care of him first,

222
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,879
We're in charge of E Fei.

223
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:34,320
I'm so unlucky. Open the door for the bad luck,

224
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,960
Bad luck at home.

225
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,840
Brother Wu,

226
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:38,240
are you okay?

227
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:39,799
I'm fine.

228
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,720
I just have a hard life.

229
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,679
You must be familiar with me.

230
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:48,879
My name is E Fei.

231
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,600
I'm your senior.

232
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,039
I'll be in charge of your training from now on,

233
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,240
please take care of me.

234
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:03,720
Where's Tang Wenqi?

235
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,120
Why isn't he here?

236
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:08,000
Take a look.

237
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,080
But just because he is the son of the mountain chief,

238
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,720
he acted recklessly.

239
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,840
Wu Wancheng, you're the same supervisor.

240
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,799
Why isn't he here?

241
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:16,879
Who am

242
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:21,240
I?
