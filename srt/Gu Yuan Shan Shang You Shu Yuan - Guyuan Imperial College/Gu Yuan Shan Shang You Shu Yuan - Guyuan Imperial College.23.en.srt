1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,120
1。

2
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,559
Excuse me. Excuse me.

3
00:00:20,679 --> 00:00:21,320
Excuse me.

4
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:23,839
Three,

5
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,160
Third place,

6
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:27,920
no more, no less, just third,

7
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:28,559
Boss,

8
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:29,440
you're third,

9
00:00:29,559 --> 00:00:30,800
Good for you.

10
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:32,759
Let me tell you,

11
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:34,000
my plan is very effective.

12
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,679
Keep it away.

13
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,600
I still have my strength.

14
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:44,439
Mr. Shan,

15
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,079
I'm sure you've all seen the results this time.

16
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:51,359
There are some students whose progress

17
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,679
is really obvious,

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,359
You can't praise me,

19
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,679
especially

20
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:01,000
Tang Wenqi,

21
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,520
You were excellent this time,

22
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:06,640
and besides,

23
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,439
Forget it.

24
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,400
What did you tell me?

25
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,599
Otherwise, you're not.

26
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,599
All right, all right.

27
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:18,560
Besides,

28
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:23,319
I want to apologize to Tang Wenqi.

29
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:28,599
I did wrong you that day.

30
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,879
I apologize to you.

31
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,319
Mr. Shan, what did you say?

32
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:38,480
Well

33
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:41,840
Tang Wenqi,

34
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,280
stop fooling around at this time.

35
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,480
It's okay. It's okay.

36
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,480
I've long forgotten about it.

37
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,400
Mr. Shan,

38
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,000
there's a guest at the entrance of the Academy.

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,920
Who is it?

40
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:01,640
Wu Wanda,

41
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,439
General Wu,

42
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,400
General Wu,

43
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,439
isn't there one day left?

44
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:06,959
Wu Wancheng,

45
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:08,240
your father is here to see you.

46
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:10,199
Go out with me to welcome him.

47
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,360
Yes.

48
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:13,759
But... But

49
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,039
what?

50
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,319
General Wu wants to pick up his seriously ill daughter,

51
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:19,759
daughter.

52
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,039
Are you

53
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:26,879
all right?

54
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:28,159
Let me have a look.

55
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,400
Dad, I'm fine.

56
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,560
Why are you sick?

57
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,080
Let's go.

58
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:33,919
I'll take you home.

59
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:34,319
Father,

60
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:35,520
I can't leave.

61
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:36,800
What's wrong?

62
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,680
Are you really a girl?

63
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:41,240
Tang,

64
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,039
General Wu,

65
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:46,080
How are you?

66
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,240
It's been a long time, Tang.

67
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:49,759
Let's talk another day.

68
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:50,400
Today,

69
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,159
I have to take my daughter home first.

70
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:52,840
Father,

71
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,639
No way.

72
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,840
She can't leave.

73
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:56,639
Why can't you

74
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,599
lie about your identity,

75
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:01,800
She disguised herself as a man and entered the official school.

76
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,120
This is a felony.

77
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:05,639
We've been friends for so many years,

78
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:08,199
can't you show me some respect?

79
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,680
I don't think

80
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:11,599
anyone would dare to do that?

81
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:23,960
Marquis E,

82
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:27,479
why did His Lordship bring so many officers

83
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:29,960
and soldiers to the Academy?

84
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,639
I received a report,

85
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:35,960
but someone dared to disguise as a man in the official school?

86
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,919
You hid it from the world.

87
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:38,240
Crime is the same as deceiving His Majesty,

88
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,400
about this matter,

89
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,319
I will report it to you.

90
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,080
Don't bother His Lordship.

91
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,639
This is the crime of deceiving His Majesty.

92
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:49,120
Can you afford it as a hill leader?

93
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:50,840
Guards,

94
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,479
Yes.

95
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:52,199
My Lord

96
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:54,479
Arrest them all and put them in jail.

97
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:56,280
I'll wait for trial on another day.

98
00:03:57,479 --> 00:03:59,080
Did Sister Wu really get it right?

99
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:00,319
Get in.

100
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:01,759
Get in.

101
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:03,360
Get in.

102
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:09,960
Look at

103
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,680
how arrogant and domineering he is,

104
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:14,520
You didn't expect this to happen, did you?

105
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:16,000
I knew it was you.

106
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,920
What's in it for you?

107
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,879
I'm willing to do it.

108
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,399
What do you care?

109
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:23,839
Wen Qi,

110
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:24,480
Wen Qi,

111
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,439
This is not the Academy,

112
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:27,439
but he is now the Crown Prince.

113
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:37,680
My father has told His Majesty,

114
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,600
His Majesty will interrogate him in person tomorrow.

115
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:41,800
Wu Wancheng,

116
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,199
enjoy your last night.

117
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,319
If you want to die,

118
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:51,519
I'll die with you.

119
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,040
Don't talk nonsense.

120
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:58,279
Now we can only rely on Lingxiu.

121
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:00,480
Wu Yumeng,

122
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:03,319
how dare you do such an immoral article.

123
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,360
There is no need for retrial.

124
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:04,920
Judge,

125
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,079
Execute.

126
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:06,879
But,

127
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:07,399
What?

128
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,560
Do you want to control me like the Empress Dowager?

129
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,279
I dare not,

130
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:14,600
Your Highness,

131
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:16,639
Let's take a break here.

132
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:19,079
The scenery here is nice.

133
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:23,399
Stop!

134
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,000
How dare you

135
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,920
Who shocked the Empress Dowager, Her Highness Feng Jia,

136
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,959
my daughter Feng Lingxiu,

137
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,720
I heard that Your Highness passed by the Academy today,

138
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,839
so she waited here.

139
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,480
If you want to ask the Empress Dowager to save her life,

140
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,920
I think you're crazy.

141
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:37,120
Guards,

142
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:37,920
drag him down,

143
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,199
I beg the Empress Dowager

144
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,040
to read the article in my hand before making a decision.

145
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,319
What are you waiting for?

146
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:42,920
Drag him out!

147
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:43,839
Wan'er,

148
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:44,800
Hold on.

149
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,920
Present the article.

150
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,759
Yes.

151
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:00,920
Take him away.

152
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:01,680
Yes.

153
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,199
What are you doing?

154
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:02,839
Stand up.

155
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:03,839
What are you doing?

156
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:04,360
Let's go!

157
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,079
What are you doing?

158
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:05,879
Let go of me!

159
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:06,759
His Majesty wants to see her.

160
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:07,439
Don't move.

161
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,720
Take us with you if you want to leave.

162
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:10,600
Wen Qi.

163
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:13,959
Tang Wen Qi.

164
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,000
I'm fine.

165
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,560
I'll be back soon.

166
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:28,000
At that time,

167
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,399
we'll set off the sky lantern together.

168
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:33,639
Take him away.

169
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,680
Let's go.

170
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:35,480
Let's go.

171
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:48,399
Mother just came back from the temple,

172
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:49,800
why don't you take a break?

173
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:53,480
I heard the imperial edict,

174
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,920
executed a female student of Gu Yuan Academy,

175
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,839
That's true.

176
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,959
This woman pretended to be a man and sneaked into the official school,

177
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:02,639
with ulterior motives.

178
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:04,120
Execute according to the law.

179
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:06,120
On my way back,

180
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,839
I came across an article,

181
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:09,040
I think

182
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,680
it's not easy for a woman to have such an opinion.

183
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,399
The article Queen Dowager said was written by Wu Yumeng.

184
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,360
I'd like to invite His Majesty to see someone

185
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:18,399
come in.

186
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:24,959
Greetings, Your Majesty.

187
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:26,240
Greetings, Your Highness.

188
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,480
You are Wu Yumeng, who is talking nonsense

189
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,279
about learning. I have made a decision,

190
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:31,680
You don't need to say more.

191
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:32,879
Your Majesty,

192
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,040
there are a group of students at the door who want to see you,

193
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:37,560
You mean the students of the Academy?

194
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,360
No.

195
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:40,600
It's the students who can't go to school.

196
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,279
Let them in.

197
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:43,560
Rise.

198
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,079
Yes.

199
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:50,439
Greetings, Your Majesty.

200
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,120
Greetings, Your Highness.

201
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,319
Rise.

202
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

203
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:56,639
Why are you here?

204
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,319
You're His Majesty.

205
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,279
Don't be rude.

206
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:00,079
It doesn't matter.

207
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:01,160
Let's go on to say,

208
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:02,920
"The grass citizen Zhou Yang,

209
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:05,480
He's a student of Master Wu,

210
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,399
and he's here to save them today.

211
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,360
How are you going to save her?

212
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,879
I heard that it's a rule that women can't study,

213
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,959
but Master Wu is a woman,

214
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:21,519
I don't think she's a worse teacher than a man.

215
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:23,199
Your Majesty, please listen

216
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,800
to the profound yellow universe,

217
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:32,720
The sun and the moon are full, the nights are long,

218
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:37,600
the cold comes and the summer goes, the autumn harvests and the winter hides,

219
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:42,639
When I reach the age of leap, Lu adjusts the sun and clouds,

220
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:48,879
causing the rain and dew to turn into frost,

221
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,080
Even though Wu Yumeng is a woman,

222
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,480
she has done many things that men can't do.

223
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:56,679
Your Majesty,

224
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,519
the Academy taught us to repay the people

225
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:00,639
and the country,

226
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,360
Then we shouldn't deprive

227
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,559
the people of the right to study.

228
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:06,000
Are you His Majesty?

229
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,039
Yes, I am.

230
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:07,639
What's wrong?

231
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:09,799
I have a gift for you.

232
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:10,519
Okay,
