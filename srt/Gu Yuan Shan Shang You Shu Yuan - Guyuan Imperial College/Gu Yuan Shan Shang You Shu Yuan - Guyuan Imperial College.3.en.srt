1
00:00:29,719 --> 00:00:30,679
What are you doing here?

2
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,799
Why don't you be with your good friend,

3
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,000
Wu Wancheng.

4
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,280
You're still angry.

5
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,880
It's just a matter of fact.

6
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,159
You're injured. Don't stay here.

7
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:41,960
Come back to the dorm with me

8
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:42,479
Let's go.

9
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,159
No.

10
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,240
I'm not going back.

11
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,200
I can't make up for my broken heart.

12
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,840
I want to make

13
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:51,520
a clean break with you.

14
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:53,719
Make a clean break.

15
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:55,439
Okay,

16
00:00:57,119 --> 00:00:58,280
I'll tell Brother Wu then.

17
00:00:58,439 --> 00:00:59,520
He said you lied to him,

18
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:01,479
but those materials are not mine at all.

19
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:03,920
But you secretly got them from the black market.

20
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:05,040
No,

21
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,480
Calm down.

22
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,079
Let go.

23
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:10,560
I'm not going.

24
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:13,400
But I still don't understand,

25
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,040
why didn't you tell Brother Wu the truth?

26
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:17,560
I don't want anyone to know that

27
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,480
I'm working on an invention,

28
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,200
So what if it's a research invention?

29
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:21,799
To be honest, in my opinion,

30
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,280
your research and inventions are very useful.

31
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:26,400
Really?

32
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:27,079
Yeah,

33
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:27,719
for example,

34
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,120
For example,

35
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,799
the artificial wings you invented,

36
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:31,480
And that

37
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,959
head-mounted umbrella,

38
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:34,799
I use it every time it rains.

39
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:39,760
I knew it.

40
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,959
Brother Qi knows me best.

41
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,719
Cut it out.

42
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:52,599
What is this?

43
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,680
This is my secret recipe.

44
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,359
What are you talking about?

45
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:57,000
There is no trace in writing.

46
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,400
Color when exposed to heat,

47
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,799
usually in the market,

48
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:00,840
They all sell at this price.

49
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,280
50 taels,

50
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,239
50 taels,

51
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:05,840
Today, my classmates

52
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,560
found a treasure. Ladies and gentlemen,

53
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:09,039
I can't afford it.

54
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:09,919
10 taels?

55
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,400
I can't afford it either.

56
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:11,960
Excuse me. Excuse me.

57
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:14,120
It's amazing.

58
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,479
-I want one. -I want one.

59
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:17,080
Okay, Mr. Chen. One bottle.

60
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:17,840
Anyone else wants it?

61
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:19,000
Hold on tight.

62
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,360
I'll have one, too.

63
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:22,680
Don't worry. Take it yourself.

64
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,520
-Give it to me. -This is yours.

65
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:25,879
Well

66
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,120
Okay, this is yours.

67
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:27,960
This is onion juice.

68
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,479
What onion juice?

69
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:31,599
This is the magic ink that I bought to develop color when heated.

70
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:32,840
It cost 10 taels?

71
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:33,759
Compensate me.

72
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,680
This is onion juice.

73
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,759
Smell it yourself,

74
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:39,560
The reason why the color appears when exposed to heat,

75
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,639
is because of the plant material in onion juice,

76
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:43,240
The handwriting will only be displayed

77
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:44,599
when you zoom when it's hot.

78
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,120
Other plants also have the same effect.

79
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:51,039
Do you think this thing is worth 10 taels?

80
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:51,960
Give me two taels,

81
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:53,240
and I'll make you ten bottles.

82
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:56,080
I'm a chemistry student,

83
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:58,039
I can't be fooled by this kind of elementary school stuff,

84
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,319
Two taels,

85
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:00,840
Tang Wenqi,

86
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,960
You lied to me.

87
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,800
Pay me back.

88
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:04,800
Well,

89
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,199
listen to me. Listen to me,

90
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:07,639
I … I … I … I … I … Well.

91
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:25,319
I'm sorry.

92
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:26,639
I'm sorry.

93
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:31,280
Refund! Refund! Refund!

94
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:32,520
Take it easy. Take it easy to refund the money.

95
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:33,800
Stop,

96
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,840
Chen Lan, Chen Lan, Chen Lan,

97
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,719
share it with them.

98
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,840
Come on. One for each.

99
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,080
Wu Wancheng,

100
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,719
Wu Wancheng,

101
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:44,960
It's you again.

102
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,560
I'm so unlucky when I meet you.

103
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,240
I haven't talked about you yet.

104
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:53,560
My clothes,

105
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:55,159
deserve it

106
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:09,599
Gosh, he hid private goods.

107
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,400
He hid private goods too,

108
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,960
Every time I met Wu Wancheng, I was unlucky,

109
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,120
and everything was ruined.

110
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,240
Gosh, why is he back too?

111
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,399
Why is he back?

112
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:27,600
Who closed the door in broad daylight?

113
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,319
Did my clothes

114
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:32,800
get stolen? This is

115
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,439
Tang Wenqi,

116
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:35,439
Oh no.

117
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,040
Father must be here to catch me.

118
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,279
Tang Wenqi.

119
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,160
Don't talk. Someone is

120
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:04,000
playing tricks on me in the Academy again.

121
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:06,399
I'll beat you to death today.

122
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,360
You.

123
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:17,759
You brat.

124
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,160
It's a mess.

125
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:39,319
My father wants to catch me.

126
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:40,839
I know.

127
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,079
What does it have to do with me?

128
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:45,759
You don't want me

129
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,000
to misunderstand you?

130
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,319
How could I misunderstand?

131
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,319
Nothing.

132
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,040
I said

133
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,800
Why are you blushing?

134
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:03,240
No, I didn't.

135
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:05,800
And he said

136
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,959
it wasn't as popular as it was,

137
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:13,360
You don't like men, do you?

138
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,879
What nonsense are you talking about?

139
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,720
You'll make trouble if you chase him away.

140
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:23,319
Why do you act like I'm right?

141
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:24,120
Let's go,

142
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,519
let's see what you've done to my room.

143
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:27,040
Go, go, go.

144
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:31,720
I don't really like men, do I?

145
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,240
Impossible. Impossible.

146
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,160
My legs are numb.

147
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:48,240
Really?

148
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:49,839
This door is broken.

149
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,920
Help! Is there anyone here?

150
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:56,600
Boss,

151
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:57,480
is that you?

152
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,720
Come on, open the door.

153
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:04,079
It's so late. I don't think there's anyone here.

154
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:09,160
This is an upgraded and enhanced version I made.

155
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,680
I don't believe you can't blow up the modern times this time.

156
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,800
Chen Lan, can you do it? Try harder.

157
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,079
You can't kick me.

158
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:23,160
I've tried my best, boss.

159
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:23,839
Why is it Tang Wenqi again?

160
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:25,560
Why is it Tang Wenqi again?

161
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:33,360
Really?

162
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:41,160
Boss,

163
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:44,600
Boss,

164
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,120
You've suffered a lot, boss.

165
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:49,759
Get a bucket of water. I

166
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,079
… I want to take a bath.

167
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:52,879
Okay, boss.

168
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:53,800
I'll be right there.

169
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,839
this time

170
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,360
Who is it?

171
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,560
It's really not me.

172
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,560
I haven't asked you yet.

173
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,720
Why did you admit it?

174
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,000
According to my investigation today,

175
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,959
you were the only one who left the prison last night.

176
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:14,199
Besides, you're the only one

177
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:15,279
who holds explosives in the Academy,

178
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:16,720
More importantly,

179
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,600
I'm still at the toilet.

180
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,800
I found a small footprint.

181
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:22,560
Of all the people in the Academy,

182
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,240
the smallest one belongs to you.

183
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,959
So the truth is,

184
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,560
the real murderer of the bombing is you.

185
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:31,639
Wu Wancheng,

186
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,519
Brother Wu did get up for the night yesterday,

187
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,200
But Brother Wu

188
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,600
ran out of explosives last time.

189
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,200
It better not be you.

190
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,679
It's not too late if you apologize to me now.

191
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:47,960
But if you lie to me,

192
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:51,960
in fact, I'm

193
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,759
Wu Wancheng. Mr. Tang Wenqi

194
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,600
asked you to look for him in the study.

195
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,919
Got it.

196
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:02,200
Forget it.

197
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,200
Let's make it clear to him tonight.

198
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,039
Let's go.

199
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:10,320
It's all your fault.

200
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:11,799
If you hadn't suddenly appeared,

201
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,279
I would have sold my onion juice,

202
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,519
If you sell my magic ink,

203
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:16,639
you won't be punished.

204
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:17,879
Why do you blame me?

205
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,960
If you hadn't lied to me,

206
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:21,360
would I have been implicated by you?

207
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:22,480
Will I be punished?

208
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,720
If you hadn't exposed me,

209
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:24,840
Neither of us will be punished.

210
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,279
The mountain chief said

211
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,480
you would be punished for playing tricks in the market.

212
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,519
My father also said,

213
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:30,759
you were punished for picking quarrels

214
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:31,960
and making trouble in class. I'm too lazy

215
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:34,759
to argue with you if I can't explain it to you clearly.

216
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:36,480
I don't need to talk to you.

217
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:40,360
They only rely on power and bully others.

218
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:46,159
Why don't you two say hello to him?
