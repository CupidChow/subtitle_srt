1
00:00:05,599 --> 00:00:06,400
1。

2
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,160
Are you asleep?

3
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,359
He seems to be asleep.

4
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,039
Luckily, he didn't notice us today.

5
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,880
If we leave early and come home late,

6
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,399
it's hard for Wen Qi not to find out.

7
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,479
Otherwise, we still

8
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:39,240
can't do it.

9
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,679
Absolutely not.

10
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:41,960
If he finds out,

11
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:43,759
there will be another risk that this matter will be exposed.

12
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,960
If you get involved with Tang Wenqi again,

13
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,320
when the mountain leader finds out,

14
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,960
I'm sure he'll be punished heavily.

15
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,280
It's better if you don't know.

16
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:50,840
By the way,

17
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:52,840
remember to keep the student roster.

18
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,600
I almost forgot if you didn't tell me.

19
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:00,840
All right,

20
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:04,799
you're not taking me to play,

21
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,840
I'd like to see what you two are up to.

22
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,239
I'm so sleepy.

23
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,239
I didn't get it.

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:11,680
Boss,

25
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:12,519
what are you doing?

26
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:13,239
Cover me!

27
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,480
In broad daylight,

28
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:17,680
is it possible that someone wants to assassinate you?

29
00:01:23,239 --> 00:01:24,000
Boss,

30
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,359
what are you doing?

31
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,799
Humorous,

32
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,079
Smile

33
00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:34,079
I told you to laugh.

34
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:35,760
Well,

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,680
aren't they always like this?

36
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,200
Yes.

37
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:40,079
By the way,

38
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:41,159
let's go now.

39
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:42,280
We have to clean up the classroom today.

40
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:43,280
Yeah, I almost forgot.

41
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,319
Let's go.

42
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:46,760
Boss,

43
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,480
where are you going?

44
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,480
Get lost!

45
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:50,239
Change your clothes first.

46
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:51,480
I'll go to the library to get your books.

47
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:52,719
Thank you, Brother Qi.

48
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,199
I want to see it today.

49
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:10,319
What are you hiding?

50
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:12,520
Why is he here?

51
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,360
Strange.

52
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:30,240
I saw that she put it in the closet.

53
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:45,599
You're not a man.

54
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:46,680
Can you speak?

55
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:49,919
You're actually a woman?

56
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:51,840
Get out of here if you see it.

57
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,400
Who saw it? What did you see?

58
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,080
You girl,

59
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,439
can you go out first?

60
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:56,960
Wait till I get dressed.

61
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,240
You said

62
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,400
you didn't know to close the door?

63
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,280
Brother Qi,

64
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,479
are you okay?

65
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,039
Brother Wu,

66
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:20,599
Sister Wu,

67
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:21,759
It's not right.

68
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,319
Oh,

69
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:24,039
How can you get used to it?

70
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,280
Okay Brother Wu,

71
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,479
you're actually a girl?

72
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,360
Gu Yuan Academy doesn't accept female disciples,

73
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,120
so I came in as a man.

74
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:34,319
So you want to study?

75
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:35,599
A talented woman disguised herself as a man,

76
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:38,000
in fact, for gunpowder.

77
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:40,400
Kind of.

78
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:42,439
That's very brave of you.

79
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,960
No wonder you used to speak up for women,

80
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:46,280
but now I understand.

81
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,479
In fact, what I want to say is,

82
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:53,560
we are still the same as before,

83
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,879
Just treat me like a man.

84
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,000
Hold on.

85
00:03:58,319 --> 00:03:59,120
I have a question.

86
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,039
You ask?

87
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:03,039
I saw it. You

88
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,360
don't have to be responsible.

89
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:06,639
Keep rolling.

90
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,280
I'm not willing to do it if you want to.

91
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,000
That's good.

92
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,479
Any other questions?

93
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,319
Yes,

94
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,399
What are you two doing behind my back lately?

95
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,480
What if you don't tell me?

96
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,720
I'll go tell my father.

97
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:26,839
You're not a man,

98
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,399
Wen Qi Wen Qi,

99
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:30,360
Okay Let me tell you,

100
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,240
actually Brother Wu and I

101
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,800
have been preparing a civilian academy recently,

102
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,560
It's a place

103
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,480
where all the people can come and learn.

104
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,800
This is a good thing.

105
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:38,959
Why didn't you tell me?

106
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:40,759
I kept it from you because I didn't want to get you into trouble.

107
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,040
Silly girl.

108
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,759
I don't care.

109
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,519
I know it anyway.

110
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,439
I want to join you.

111
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:47,839
Let's go together.

112
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:49,759
What are you going to teach him?

113
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,120
To teach people to shoot guns,

114
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:54,199
then I'll ask my father.

115
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:58,600
What should she do when she enters the Academy?

116
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,639
Wen Qi,

117
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:03,399
I shouldn't have let you know.

118
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,399
Wen Qi,

119
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,360
let's be

120
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,040
so kind together,

121
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,600
I don't believe you can teach people to read.

122
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:16,560
Calm down.

123
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:17,680
I have another question.

124
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:18,680
It's so annoying. Ask me.

125
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,160
Since your gender is fake,

126
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,160
what about your background?

127
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:25,199
My father is the real General Wu,

128
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,120
otherwise I wouldn't have been able to study in the Academy.

129
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,079
However,

130
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:33,560
I really haven't seen my father for a long time.

131
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,639
It's been a long time since we last met,

132
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,199
I think she's going to turn the tables.

133
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:39,800
General Wu, calm down.

134
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:41,439
I asked you to escort her back to her mansion.

135
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,839
That's how you do things for me.

136
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:44,199
Subordinate,

137
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:46,360
I didn't expect that,

138
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,319
Why would you stay in Gu Yuan?

139
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,480
She even disguised herself as a man and entered the Academy,

140
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,240
where she ate and lived with a group of men.

141
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,319
Someone else knows about it.

142
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:54,839
Which other family wants her?

143
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:56,439
I'm willing to make meritorious deeds,

144
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,199
and go to Gu Yuan to pick you up.

145
00:05:58,319 --> 00:05:58,839
Okay,

146
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,480
You're leaving today.

147
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,680
Be sure to take her back to the northwest.

148
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,399
Yes.

149
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,000
She's the girl in green that day.

150
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:24,120
Get out of the way!

151
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:25,800
Get out of the way.

152
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:28,279
Get out of the way!

153
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:28,879
Hurry up!

154
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:37,839
Could it be that

155
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:41,319
this is the legendary love at first sight.

156
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,720
I've been looking for you for so long.

157
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:47,240
It turns out that you've always been by my side.

158
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:48,759
I'm fine now.

159
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,839
Isn't this the girl from that day?

160
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,240
Why are you so dazed?

161
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,720
Do you still remember me?

162
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,560
I'm going to get changed.

163
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:02,000
It's not like I'm going to change my mind.

164
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,279
Brother Wu,

165
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,079
you wear women's clothes,

166
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,600
It's so pretty.

167
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:10,160
I think so, too.

168
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,839
Okay, let's go pick up the students.

169
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,360
It shouldn't be.

170
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,160
Why doesn't she remember me?

171
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,160
Wait.

172
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:24,240
Wu Wancheng,

173
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,240
think about it.

174
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,319
Wen Qi,

175
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:33,839
why are you here?

176
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,360
I want to take you to class,

177
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,720
just you?

178
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,199
Master Wu,

179
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:43,240
it turns out that you are the young woman Wen Qi is looking for.

180
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:44,839
Me,

181
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:45,839
Zhou Yang,

182
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:47,199
don't talk nonsense.

183
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,480
Brother's sister Qingyi is so gentle.

184
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,720
Look at

185
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,120
what she looks like.

186
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,000
Luckily,

187
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:56,040
it's not Master Wu. You're a woman.

188
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,120
Aren't women not allowed to go to school?

189
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,959
Why can't a woman go to school?

190
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,319
Everyone can go to school here,

191
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:06,879
so can my sister also come?

192
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:07,920
Of course.

193
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,000
All right, all right.

194
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:09,839
Let's clean it up.

195
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:10,600
Let's start our class.

196
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,800
Go to

197
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:13,319
your place.

198
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:16,040
Let me ask you one more time.

199
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:17,800
You really don't remember anything?

200
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:19,199
What should I remember?

201
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:20,279
That day.

202
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:27,519
Do you remember?

203
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,759
Are you crazy?

204
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:37,279
Students, open the bamboo slips,

205
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,440
and let's review yesterday's lessons.

206
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,360
Yesterday, we learned thousands of characters,

207
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,759
Heaven and Earth Xuanhuang,

208
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:46,159
The universe is wild,

209
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:47,799
the sun and the moon are full,

210
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:49,080
Make a list of Chensu.

211
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,559
He must have taken the wrong medicine today.

212
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,159
Can you stop messing around?

213
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:04,879
I'm listening to the class. Do

214
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,320
as you say,

215
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,600
I didn't say anything.

216
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:11,320
Can you stop staring at me?

217
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,720
Why am I staring at you?

218
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,240
You've been staring at Qi Shan?

219
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,039
Nonsense.

220
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,200
He's in class.

221
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:20,519
I'm not staring at him. I'm staring at you.

222
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:21,559
Is the class difficult?

223
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:23,120
I can do it, too.

224
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,159
I'll give you one.

225
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,440
Watch carefully.

226
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:27,639
Stop messing around.

227
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,240
Today, I'll give you a chance

228
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,279
to test the teacher.

229
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,360
Is that okay?

230
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,679
Okay,

231
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:37,440
Okay, I'll go first.

232
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,679
Winter comes and summer goes,

233
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:41,399
autumn harvests and winter hides. What's the next sentence?
