1
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:22,000
I have fallen in love with you.

2
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,480
Brother Qi,

3
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:31,879
I'm just a friend

4
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:33,520
to you.

5
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,359
I know.

6
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:42,320
You care more about Wen Qi

7
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:44,880
than I do,

8
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:47,119
Did I?

9
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:50,920
I don't know if you've noticed,

10
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:54,079
but you always call me Brother Qi.

11
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,679
Instead, I'll call him Tang Wenqi.

12
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:01,840
I knew it from the moment I found out about it.

13
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:03,960
I'm just a friend

14
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,760
to you.

15
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:11,159
-I'm sorry. -Brother Qi.

16
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,519
I finally found you two.

17
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,319
Aren't you studying?

18
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,079
We need to combine work and rest.

19
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:20,879
I suggest,

20
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,599
taking advantage of the rest time,

21
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,079
How about hosting a welcome dinner for Chestnut?

22
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:28,519
Wen Qi just told me that he wants to treat me to roast duck

23
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:29,439
and drink a lot of wine?

24
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:32,560
When did you two become so close?

25
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,519
I'm telling you,

26
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:35,680
Wen Qi is the most passionate person I've ever met.

27
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,400
Chestnut is cute, too.

28
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:43,599
I won't take part in it.

29
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:44,319
Brother Qi,

30
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:45,959
are you kidding me?

31
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,239
We, the Four Masters of Gu Yuan,

32
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,280
are indispensable.

33
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:50,120
I have something to do at home.

34
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:51,879
Brother Qi,

35
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:56,040
please, please.

36
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,040
Okay, okay.

37
00:01:58,239 --> 00:01:58,760
Okay,

38
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:00,159
I'll go.

39
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:00,840
Okay,

40
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,400
It's a deal then.

41
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,319
Okay.

42
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,439
Have you seen my work?

43
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:12,840
How am I supposed to know about your own stuff?

44
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:15,159
No,

45
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:16,319
I didn't throw it away either.

46
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,960
Think about it,

47
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:20,080
did Brother Qi help you revise your work today?

48
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,400
Is it in the closet?

49
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:23,360
I think so.

50
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,800
What did you

51
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,120
find?

52
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:38,080
Brother Qi is moving out.

53
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:46,560
Is there anything

54
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,159
bothering Brother Qi lately?

55
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:50,759
He didn't even want to go to the reception banquet that day.

56
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:53,680
That's not right.

57
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,719
He is excellent in character and learning.

58
00:02:57,159 --> 00:02:59,039
What troubles can there be?

59
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:02,159
Did we mess with him?

60
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:04,080
I … I didn't.

61
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,319
I haven't seen much of him in the past two days.

62
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:10,560
Then why?

63
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,159
I've been studying so hard recently,

64
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,159
and he praised me.

65
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,360
Is it because of me?

66
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:24,800
No matter what the reason is,

67
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:26,159
we don't want Brother Qi to leave.

68
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:26,680
Right?

69
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:27,840
Of course.

70
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,360
All right. You must listen to me.

71
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:31,479
Don't tell anyone

72
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:32,400
about what happened today.

73
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:33,520
But on the day of the welcome banquet,

74
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,000
you must give Brother Qi and I half an hour.

75
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,319
You're not trying to

76
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:39,719
seduce him.

77
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,439
Tang Wenqi,

78
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,240
Get lost!

79
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:46,280
Mr. Shan is here.

80
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:52,319
Li,

81
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,080
come on.

82
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:53,840
Let's have a seat.

83
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,080
What about Wu Wancheng?

84
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,520
It's okay. He has Brother Qi?

85
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:02,159
Brother Qi,

86
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:02,879
have a seat.

87
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:03,800
I saved a seat for you.

88
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,000
Have a seat.

89
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:08,360
No, thanks.

90
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,439
I'll sit here.

91
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:12,400
Look,

92
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:14,639
I told you there must be something wrong with them.

93
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:31,240
Ling Xiu

94
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:33,000
I've told you.

95
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,160
Call me Miss Feng.

96
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:35,000
Yes,

97
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,120
Miss Feng,

98
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,000
Tell me,

99
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,319
why do you come to me again?

100
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:42,959
I … I sprained my ankle, but why are you covering your

101
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:44,560
knee?

102
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,439
I hurt my knee, too.

103
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,439
Look.

104
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:51,759
I … I can't even stand still now.

105
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:53,720
All right,

106
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:55,240
stop it.

107
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,079
Actually, I want to ask you,

108
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:01,439
how are you thinking about getting married?

109
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:03,319
What do you think?

110
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:07,639
You

111
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:09,079
promised me.

112
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:12,839
Today,

113
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:14,319
I'll fill in the song

114
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,399
I didn't finish last time.

115
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:21,240
Qi Shan,

116
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,600
get up and talk about the artistic conception of that song.

117
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:34,839
Qishan,

118
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:36,240
I'm calling you.

119
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:40,639
Mr. Shan,

120
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,759
student,

121
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:44,800
I didn't hear you clearly.

122
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:47,519
You didn't hear me clearly?

123
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,720
Or Sichun?

124
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:51,920
Chen Lan,

125
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:52,959
Smell it

126
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,480
Who farted?

127
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,160
It stinks.

128
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:57,000
Boss,

129
00:05:57,079 --> 00:05:57,920
you really have no quality.

130
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:00,480
Who are you talking about?

131
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:04,199
Who let me say who?

132
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,399
All right, all right.

133
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,279
Stop messing around.

134
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:10,399
The final exam is approaching,

135
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:12,000
Qishan Qi

136
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,040
I hope you can

137
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,680
remember your status as a student,

138
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,879
It's your duty to study.

139
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:21,920
Okay,

140
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:22,920
sit down.

141
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,279
Mr. Xie.

142
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,680
If it weren't for our Li,

143
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,160
I wouldn't have taken out

144
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,439
the wine I've collected for so many years,

145
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:47,519
Come and try my peerless wine.

146
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,399
Thank you, bro.

147
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:50,279
Let's drink till we drop.

148
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,160
Come on,

149
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,519
Let's drink till we drop.

150
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,639
Why did I forget about the roast duck?

151
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:19,680
Chestnut,

152
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:20,759
Well,

153
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,240
Can you go get a roast duck with me at the door?

154
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:23,959
Okay.

155
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:25,720
Then come with me, Lingxiu.

156
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:27,639
I'm not going.

157
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,000
I want to be with Sister Wu,

158
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:30,920
Lingxiu,

159
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,759
Get me two more cucumbers

160
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:33,800
to get rid of the boredom.

161
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:34,360
Go,

162
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:36,000
Let's go.

163
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:48,720
You asked them to leave, didn't you?

164
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:50,639
It's a little obvious.

165
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,360
If Wen Qi hadn't begged me,

166
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:58,240
I wouldn't have shown up.

167
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,399
I'm not blaming you.

168
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,839
I think we should make it clear.

169
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:08,319
You and I know each other very well.

170
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:11,720
I'll try not to disturb you.

171
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:14,480
Brother Qi,

172
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:17,319
I never wanted you to leave.

173
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:19,480
You didn't do anything wrong.

174
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,639
That's why you don't have to hide from me.

175
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,800
Between us,

176
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,160
it's still the same as before,

177
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:25,000
Is that okay?

178
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,600
We can still be the same as before,

179
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:32,399
of course,

180
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,799
You'll always be my brother Qi.

181
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:35,519
Are you okay?

182
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:37,080
I'm sorry.

183
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,720
I thought

184
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,559
you were imagining things,

185
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,559
Have you forgotten what we told Tang Wenqi?

186
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:48,879
If you have anything to say, let's solve it together.

187
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:52,559
I'm sorry

188
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:54,080
for letting you down.

189
00:08:54,759 --> 00:08:55,639
It doesn't exist.

190
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,799
So don't even think about leaving the supervisor.

191
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,799
Stay here.

192
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:04,799
Oh no.

193
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:05,840
What's wrong?

194
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:08,080
I just handed in the application for retirement,

195
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,600
and I'm afraid you've already seen it,

196
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:11,600
Why don't you go and get it back?

197
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,559
I'll get it back.

198
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:13,480
Don't wait for me.

199
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,600
Hurry up.

200
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:23,799
It will be great if this matter is solved.

201
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:26,519
Where's Qi?

202
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:27,399
Why is it missing?

203
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:29,519
He went to get his retirement application.

204
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,679
He did hand it in.

205
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,480
If I had known, I would have torn it up.

206
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,720
You're right.

207
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
All right. It's all in the past.

208
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:38,759
Guys,

209
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:39,679
Kai Xuan,

210
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,720
Here we are.

211
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:43,399
Cheers!
