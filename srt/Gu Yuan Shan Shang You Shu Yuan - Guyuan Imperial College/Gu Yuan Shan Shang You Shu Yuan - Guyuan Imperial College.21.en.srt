1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,240
1。

2
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:23,320
Mr. Shan,

3
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:25,600
Tang Wenqi didn't write this note.

4
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,000
He didn't write it.

5
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,480
What evidence do you have?

6
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,840
Is there anything special

7
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:36,079
about the urgent words on this note?

8
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,439
The word "urgent" is wrong.

9
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,479
Yes,

10
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,719
The whole Academy

11
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,600
will write this urgent word wrong,

12
00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:47,520
There's only one person.

13
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,719
It's E Fei.

14
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:56,000
Wu Wancheng,

15
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,600
stop slinging mud at me,

16
00:00:58,359 --> 00:00:58,960
Mr. Shan,

17
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,600
if someone wants to frame me,

18
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,560
I don't know.

19
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:03,600
All right,

20
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,239
let's go to the supervisor of Senior,

21
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:08,640
Let's see if there's any onion water left.

22
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:12,480
Mr. Shan,

23
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:16,799
I admit my mistake,

24
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:18,439
I was confused for a moment,

25
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,959
so I hope you can forgive me,

26
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:21,400
It's you.

27
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:23,239
E Fei,

28
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,760
what's the motto of Gu Yuan Academy?

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,920
Houde,

30
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,159
Erudite,

31
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,319
What's wrong

32
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,640
with your behavior?

33
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:39,799
Mr. Shan,

34
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,400
a student like you,

35
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:43,319
Gu Yuan Academy can't tolerate you anymore.

36
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,439
Mr. Shan,

37
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:46,719
give the students one more chance.

38
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,599
Forget it.

39
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,159
Go back and pack your things.

40
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,239
Wen Qi,

41
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,239
Father,

42
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:07,560
Now that we've found out the truth,

43
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,240
I'll leave first.

44
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:13,960
Boss,

45
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,759
Tang Wenqi,

46
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:15,719
Let's go.

47
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:16,400
Let's go.

48
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,639
Yes, yes, yes.

49
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:23,000
For what happened today,

50
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:25,479
I owe my son an apology.

51
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,560
Apologize?

52
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,319
How can a father

53
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,639
apologize to his son?

54
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,120
Why not?

55
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:33,560
Since you made a mistake,

56
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,360
you have to apologize.

57
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,120
Unless you...

58
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:37,919
Unless what?

59
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,800
Unless you're not human.

60
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:43,080
Old man

61
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,120
Feng, Feng,

62
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,639
Tang Wenqi,

63
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:51,639
Wu Wancheng,

64
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:52,960
Qi Shan,

65
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:55,319
and Li Zigao, the new comer,

66
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,280
Take my Lingxiu.

67
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,879
I remember them all.

68
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:01,639
Even if I leave,

69
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,439
I won't let you go.

70
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:04,960
Brother Fei,

71
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:07,199
about what you asked me to investigate last time,

72
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:07,960
I found it.

73
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:08,919
What do you mean?

74
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:12,000
General Wu does have a son,

75
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:13,360
but not a son.

76
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,800
It's a daughter.

77
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,639
Daughter,

78
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,919
according to the time General Wu took to pick up and drop off his daughter,

79
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,080
This Wu Wancheng,

80
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,520
is most likely General Wu's daughter.

81
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,400
Wu... No wonder

82
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:30,759
I always think she's good-looking.

83
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,159
Go on.

84
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:34,039
Continue

85
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,400
According to the information,

86
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:37,280
General Wu also came to Gu Yuan recently,

87
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:39,960
But I don't know why.

88
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:42,439
God is helping me.

89
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,680
Go to General Wu's residence now.

90
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:46,919
If you say so,

91
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,759
Wu Wancheng has a sudden illness,

92
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:53,039
I don't believe this father can still sit still?

93
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:53,599
Brother Fei,

94
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:56,319
you want Wu Wancheng to show himself in public,

95
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,560
Clever,

96
00:03:57,879 --> 00:03:58,319
Hurry up!

97
00:03:58,919 --> 00:03:59,599
Yes.

98
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,159
She disguised herself as a man and entered the Academy.

99
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,520
This is the crime of deceiving His Majesty.

100
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,680
How can you escape this time?

101
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,480
You scared me.

102
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,000
I thought it was Tang Wenqi.

103
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,560
You

104
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,000
were packing,

105
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,000
That's right.

106
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,720
We're leaving soon.

107
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,079
I need to clean it up.

108
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,000
Have you really decided to leave like this?

109
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:47,120
I'm leaving sooner or later anyway.

110
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,920
If others find out who I am as a woman,

111
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,160
they will also bring trouble to other people in the Academy.

112
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,120
It's a good time to leave now.

113
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,480
You're right.

114
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,879
Tell me,

115
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:10,160
if I leave,

116
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,079
Do you still have a chance to come back?

117
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:17,000
Come in,

118
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,720
Wu Wancheng,

119
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:22,839
this is a letter from Tang Wenqi.

120
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:25,399
For me?

121
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:27,600
Thank you.

122
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:34,399
Tang Wenqi,

123
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,720
are you there?

124
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,800
Who are you?

125
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:41,959
Let go!

126
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:43,079
-No. -Let go. It's

127
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,040
you.

128
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:47,959
Wu

129
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,680
(E), E Fei,

130
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:50,839
Why are you here?

131
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,920
Where's Tang Wenqi?

132
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,199
You are indeed a woman.

133
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,600
From that day on, Tang Wen stood up for you.

134
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,959
I don't think it's right.

135
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,319
Sure enough,

136
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,480
you two have been in love for a long time.

137
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,720
A woman,

138
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,199
disguised as a man, entered the Academy.

139
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,399
And you're still living with the son of the mountain chief,

140
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,240
if word gets out about this,

141
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,399
I'll see how you behave,

142
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,079
if I agree with you,

143
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:26,040
Let go!

144
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,240
Let go!

145
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:29,360
You can just scold me.

146
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,040
No one knows you're here today.

147
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:33,959
Just in time.

148
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,160
Let me see if you're a man or a woman?

149
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,120
What are you doing?

150
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,519
Get your dirty hands off me.

151
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:46,040
Your lover is here.

152
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:47,480
I've put up with you for a long time.

153
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,839
Don't push your luck.

154
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:50,720
I'm pushing my luck.

155
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,079
When did you think I was a senior?

156
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,439
Do you deserve it?

157
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,120
Okay.

158
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,639
One, two, three.

159
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:05,720
Beat him!

160
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:13,560
Tang Wenqi.

161
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:18,399
Look,

162
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,720
how touching it is.

163
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:24,279
Is it possible for you to touch the daughter of the General's Mansion whenever you want?

164
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:26,839
Beat him!

165
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:38,680
Let's go.

166
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:48,079
You losers.

167
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:49,600
What's the use of raising you?

168
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,240
What?

169
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:54,399
He abused lynching,

170
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:55,519
and tried to mollify others.

171
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:56,439
We can't even arrest him.

172
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,199
Wen Qi,

173
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,480
don't move if you're hurt.

174
00:07:58,519 --> 00:07:59,600
Sit down.

175
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:02,199
Watch your arms.

176
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,680
It's not that I can't catch him,

177
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,079
but that I can't catch him at all.

178
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:06,439
When the local authorities heard that

179
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:07,839
he was His Lordship's son,

180
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,319
I don't dare to provoke you.

181
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,240
Let alone arrest him.

182
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,199
Then why don't you let it go?

183
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,079
Look at Tang Wenqi's arm.

184
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:19,240
It's fine,

185
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:21,759
The main reason is that if he touches you,

186
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,920
he must die.

187
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,160
But I don't think he really met me.

188
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:33,720
What else do you want?

189
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,360
I was just saying,

190
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,639
watch your arm.

191
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:39,039
-Watch your

192
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,320
arms. -Yeah,

193
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,559
I've already called him for you.

194
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,720
I'm mad at you too.

195
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,360
What else do you want to do?

196
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:58,039
I need a special escort.

197
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,320
Tang Wenqi,

198
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,080
is that necessary?

199
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:09,600
Why not?

200
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:11,519
I'm badly hurt.

201
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:13,600
You hurt your hand.

202
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,679
Why do you want me to hold you?

203
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,799
You dislike me?

204
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,679
You are no longer willing to share weal and woe with me.

205
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,000
It's okay. Just go.

206
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:26,559
I'll get better on my own.

207
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,559
All right, shut up!

208
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:30,679
Can't I help you?

209
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,600
It's so heavy. You're a pig.
