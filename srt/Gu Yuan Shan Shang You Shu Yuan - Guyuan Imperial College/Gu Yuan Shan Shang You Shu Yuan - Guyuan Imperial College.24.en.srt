1
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,240
Are you alright?

2
00:00:34,359 --> 00:00:35,039
I'm alright.

3
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:41,520
Are you alright?

4
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,439
I am fine.

5
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:48,159
What's up

6
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,479
his Majesty hasn't made the final decision yet.

7
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:53,520
So he asked us to return to the academy and wait.

8
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,759
I'm scared.

9
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,479
It doesn't matter.

10
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,600
It'll be all right.

11
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:05,159
Then let's go home.

12
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,560
Home?

13
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:07,599
Come on.

14
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:11,280
You don't want to leave?

15
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,280
I'm holding

16
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,120
Is the written judgment.

17
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:23,319
As the Chief,

18
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,040
please follow

19
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:26,959
according to the verdict in the paper.

20
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,359
Do you have any objection?

21
00:01:31,879 --> 00:01:32,319
No one.

22
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:32,920
No one.

23
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,719
With my orders,

24
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,480
I have known

25
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:41,439
about Gu Yuan's Academy.

26
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,920
Considering the current situation,

27
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:45,959
we are proposing the following requirements.

28
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,000
Firstly,

29
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,840
guyuan Academy

30
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:49,920
from now on,

31
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:51,760
a class of poor families will be set up

32
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,079
and select good disciples to study.

33
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,480
Second,

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,599
girls are allowed to enroll.

35
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,560
But she must attend classes in separate classes with men.

36
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:06,640
Three.

37
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:08,479
As an exception,

38
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:10,960
as a disciple of Wu Changliang.

39
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,360
Because she worked for the people

40
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:14,840
In the Academy,

41
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,120
It's granted

42
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,000
the token of the first female disciple.

43
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,199
Respect that.

44
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,800
This is the token granted by His Majesty.

45
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:33,120
Father, I really did it.

46
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,800
My daughter

47
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,360
I can do anything.

48
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:39,080
Miss Wu.

49
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,000
Good for you to stay.

50
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:41,639
I told you

51
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:43,159
everything we do is meaningful.

52
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:44,840
Let me have a look.

53
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,120
Tang Wenqi...

54
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:49,360
What?

55
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,159
I can share everything.

56
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,240
That's right.

57
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,879
I knew it.

58
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:54,680
You just knew it?

59
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,479
When did that happen?

60
00:02:57,879 --> 00:02:59,240
Was before you were born.

61
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:01,280
I worked with General Wu.

62
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,360
And we're close.

63
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,439
So I decide to get married.

64
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,120
Did I have to inform you?

65
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:08,360
I think

66
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,479
It's a bit rash.

67
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,919
Don't you want to marry me?

68
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:14,039
That's not what I mean.

69
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,039
On the other hand.

70
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,159
What's your opinion?

71
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,680
When did they fall in love?

72
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:21,759
Maybe it's love at first sight.

73
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,919
I think so.

74
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:27,120
What should we do now?

75
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:29,000
Pick a date

76
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:30,719
to prepare for the wedding.

77
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:32,639
Alright.

78
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:33,120
OK.

79
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,039
OK.

80
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:38,400
Right.

81
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:41,000
She is the first female disciple granted by His Majesty.

82
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:41,800
She is.

83
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:42,960
I didn't notice that

84
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,120
she is so lovely?

85
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:44,960
Enough.

86
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,000
Stop dreaming.

87
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,680
She's engaged with Wen Qi.

88
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,840
What a pity!

89
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,159
What are you looking at?

90
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:54,080
Let's see. There won't be any loss.

91
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:54,520
You can't.

92
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:55,800
We are engaged.

93
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,159
You have to wear men's clothes.

94
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,520
Why do you have to wear women's clothes?

95
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:00,719
I have announced my identity as the girl.

96
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:02,159
Why can't I wear women's clothes?

97
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:02,840
Because...

98
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,599
I'm not used to them staring at you.

99
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,199
You tell me what to do.

100
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:15,039
Fellow classmates,

101
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:18,879
we are getting married in a few days.

102
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,439
I hope all of you could come join us.

103
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,279
Congratulations. Congratulations.

104
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,079
Congratulations.

105
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:26,079
Congratulations.

106
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:26,800
Tang Wenqi, you're so childish

107
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,360
you're so childish.

108
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:29,959
Why did he run away?

109
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:31,560
We have to try out the wedding clothes.

110
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,439
That's unexpected.

111
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,439
He's also fearless.

112
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,079
He's shy?

113
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,399
I'm not shy.

114
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:47,439
I just didn't expect this day to come so soon.

115
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:49,519
I'm not ready.

116
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:51,360
How can I suddenly marry you?

117
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:53,319
Don't scare me.

118
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,519
I have made up my mind to marry you in this life.

119
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,319
I know.

120
00:04:58,399 --> 00:04:59,720
You've said that 800 times.

121
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:01,279
What if

122
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:03,720
how about changing the wedding dress to teal?

123
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:05,720
Why?

124
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:07,240
I think red is good.

125
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,040
It's festive.

126
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,160
The first time I met you,

127
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:11,480
you looked so familiar

128
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:14,480
that was the luckiest color in my memory.

129
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,639
Does it make more sense if we change it

130
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:18,560
If we change our wedding dress to cyan?

131
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,000
The one he loves is Qingyi,

132
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,800
or the real me.

133
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,279
Couldn't have

134
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,160
two Couldn't change

135
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:28,920
what do you think

136
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:31,920
I think...

137
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,000
I think my father wants to see me.

138
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,879
I'm leaving now.

139
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,639
It's weird.

140
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:47,199
Why are you here?

141
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:48,600
Lingxiu asked me to come.

142
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,879
I thought you were in a bad mood.

143
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:51,040
So I asked her to ask you out.

144
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:53,879
What's wrong?

145
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:55,959
How about

146
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:57,600
we should stop getting married.

147
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,360
Why?

148
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,360
I think

149
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,199
we rushed to see

150
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:06,000
you don't seem to know the real me.

151
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,759
That's not true.

152
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,879
In my heart, I always knew that you are the one I like.

153
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,079
Then let me ask you.

154
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,879
What do you like, the Girl of Green Coat, Wu Kuang,

155
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,160
or Wu Wancheng, who is always against you?

156
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,680
It's me!

157
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:23,800
It's that Qingyi sister he really loves.

158
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,639
But that wasn't me.

159
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,439
What are you laughing at?

160
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,519
You're a fool?

161
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,000
How am I silly?

162
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:34,560
Yes

163
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,040
the first time I met you

164
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:38,160
was Qingyi indeed.

165
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:39,360
But I was shocked

166
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,680
I only cared about

167
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:41,920
I cared about

168
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,160
Is the person who plays with me

169
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:47,959
do experiments with me,

170
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,160
get whipped together,

171
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:53,040
who light the sky lantern together.

172
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,199
Are you going to cry?

173
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:05,120
I'm laughing. Can't you see?

174
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,480
In this life,

175
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,000
I'm going to depend on you.

176
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:13,920
All right, all right.

177
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:15,319
But marriage...

178
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,279
Yes. Congratulations.

179
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,079
Congratulations. Congratulations.

180
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,399
Congratulations. Congratulations.

181
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:21,920
Congratulations.

182
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,439
Congratulations. Congratulations.

183
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,079
Bow to heaven and earth.

184
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,040
The second bow to the high court.

185
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,600
Bow to each other.

186
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,240
To the bridal chamber.

187
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,800
Hold on.

188
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,000
There's another important thing.

189
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,720
Those who catch it will be good luck.

190
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:57,360
Three.

191
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,000
Two.

192
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,759
-One. -Let's go!

193
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:04,399
I caught it.

194
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:05,120
Congratulations. Congratulations.

195
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,160
Congratulations. Congratulations.

196
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:19,519
Honey.

197
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:21,079
I'm going to lift the veil.

198
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:29,000
Lingxiu?

199
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:30,959
Why are you here?

200
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:32,559
Where is Master Li?

201
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:33,879
Did I go to the wrong place?

202
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:35,919
This is not right.

203
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,159
It's Tianzihao.

204
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:38,799
But they also...

205
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,519
Bad news!

206
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:45,360
Honey,

207
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:49,000
I prepared your favorite chestnut cakes.

208
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,120
I was wrong. All wrong.

209
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:57,480
I got the wrong room.

210
00:08:57,919 --> 00:08:58,919
That was an accident.

211
00:08:59,039 --> 00:08:59,679
This time,

212
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:01,360
I won't let you run away again.

213
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,000
Would you like to

214
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,759
with me for the rest of your life?

215
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,320
But I have another secret.

216
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,399
Our wedding night.

217
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:22,120
Are you going to make fun of me again?

218
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,480
Actually,

219
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:27,240
I accidentally came back from 1,000 years later.

220
00:09:27,559 --> 00:09:28,799
I am a modern man.

221
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:31,840
I also have a secret actually.

222
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,799
Actually,

223
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,960
I'm not an individual.

224
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,159
What are you doing?

225
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,639
It's such a happy day.

226
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:42,639
It's time for something serious.
