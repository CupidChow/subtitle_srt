1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:06,960
1。

2
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:22,199
Mr. E has been waiting for you in there for a long time.

3
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,960
If you don't show up,

4
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,960
I'm afraid our Chunhua Building will be torn down.

5
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:28,399
Red Girl, I'm tired.

6
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:29,359
I don't see any guests today.

7
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:30,000
What?

8
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:32,200
It's fine if it's someone else.

9
00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:35,159
But we can't afford to offend Mr. E.

10
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,000
Then let him come another day.

11
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,399
You don't understand what I'm saying, do you?

12
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:41,280
Let me tell you,

13
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,520
you have to pick up today's guest if you want.

14
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,000
You have to answer it if you don't want to.

15
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,560
If you take this customer today,

16
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,719
about your redemption,

17
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:51,439
I promise you.

18
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:52,679
Are you serious?

19
00:00:52,759 --> 00:00:53,600
Zilan.

20
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:55,399
When did Red Girl lie to you?

21
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,479
Okay,

22
00:00:56,679 --> 00:00:57,280
I'll go.

23
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:57,960
Let's go.

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,039
Let's get changed.

25
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:01,520
Did you see anything?

26
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,399
I'm not sure.

27
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:05,439
What are you waiting for?

28
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,879
Just go in and ask me.

29
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:07,680
Let's go

30
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,680
Wen Qi, don't be impulsive.

31
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:12,280
If Mountain Owner finds out we're here,

32
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,159
He will definitely expel us from the Academy.

33
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:16,680
And from what the procuress just said,

34
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,239
I'm afraid E Fei was there too.

35
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,920
It's just time to catch him.

36
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:21,840
Brother Qi,

37
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:22,920
if you don't dare to go,

38
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,560
Just stay here and eat steamed bread.

39
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,000
It's a little risky for Brother Wu

40
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,200
to break into brothels or not,

41
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,480
But it's exciting to think about it.

42
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,079
I don't care. Just die.

43
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,000
Young Master E,

44
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,680
Chunhua House is becoming more and more unreasonable.

45
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:43,599
It took me so long to hire someone.

46
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,040
Forget it.

47
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:48,400
I'm happy today,

48
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,159
Come on,

49
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,560
Have a drink with me.

50
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:52,480
Yes.

51
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,000
Childe E

52
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:06,879
Zilan is willing to play a song to cheer you up.

53
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,680
I didn't spend money here to listen to music.

54
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:18,759
Please take care of yourself.

55
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,560
It's a rule that Zilan doesn't sell herself

56
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,360
when performing arts.

57
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,120
Rules,

58
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,360
what kind of person are you?

59
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:28,400
You deserve to tell me the rules.

60
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,159
You even know how to write poems?

61
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,159
how

62
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,599
I want to study to change my life.

63
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,120
Unfortunately,

64
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:40,240
You're a woman,

65
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:41,759
and you're a lowlife.

66
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:43,840
I'll be a prostitute and slave for the rest of my life.

67
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:44,800
Just give up.

68
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,919
If you have a temper,

69
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:51,919
I like people like you.

70
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,080
Awesome.

71
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,439
Let go of me

72
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,520
E Fei, you jerk!

73
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:07,560
Miss, are you all right?

74
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:09,120
You

75
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,599
ruined my plan again.

76
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:11,439
E Fei

77
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,639
As a student of the Academy,

78
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:14,000
you came out to eat wine and flowers,

79
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,759
I'm afraid it won't sound good if it's spread.

80
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:18,520
As the son of His Lordship,

81
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,520
what can you do to me?

82
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,120
Despicable,

83
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,080
Shameless!

84
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,319
E Fei,

85
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:26,680
we don't have to tell Mr. Shan what happened today,

86
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,080
But you

87
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:30,319
must apologize to this girl.

88
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,280
What a joke.

89
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,240
I'll apologize to a whore.

90
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:35,800
It's okay, Mr. Wu.

91
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,800
Just go.

92
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:38,599
Zilan doesn't want to get you involved.

93
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:40,840
Okay,

94
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:42,719
It's okay if you don't apologize.

95
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,439
As for what happened today,

96
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,400
I'll tell you the truth.

97
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,280
You know my father's temper,

98
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,280
if you don't want to die a horrible death,

99
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:52,560
Apologize now.

100
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:55,479
It's my bad luck.

101
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:56,879
Miss Zilan.

102
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:57,919
I'm sorry.

103
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:02,240
Wait and see!

104
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,879
Good aim.

105
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,680
Thank you for your help,

106
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,280
Miss. You're welcome.

107
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,120
If he dares to come to you again in the future,

108
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:12,039
just tell us,

109
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,080
We'll teach him a lesson for you.

110
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,600
Are you really An Shi?

111
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,199
Sorry to make you laugh.

112
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,680
It doesn't matter.

113
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:21,839
Although you can't enter the Academy,

114
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,680
you can come to us if you need anything in the future.

115
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,399
We'll help you.

116
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,759
Zilan has a lowly identity,

117
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:27,319
which might ruin your innocence.

118
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,240
Everyone is equal before reading.

119
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:31,199
Besides,

120
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:33,040
you're good at writing articles.

121
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:36,160
It's a thousand times better than those disciples of the clans.

122
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,839
Don't belittle yourself.

123
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,319
Brother Wu,

124
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,759
it's improper for a man and woman to touch each other.

125
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:45,879
Excuse me.

126
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:50,160
Forget it,

127
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,639
you're no better than E Fei.

128
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,120
Tang Wenqi,

129
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:55,199
what are you doing?

130
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:00,399
Miss Zilan, it's getting late.

131
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,800
We'll come to you later.

132
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,160
Take care, Young Master.

133
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:07,680
Mr. Wu,

134
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:09,639
this is the book you lent me last time.

135
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:10,759
I've read it all.

136
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,879
Like I said,

137
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,360
you're more talented than all of us.

138
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:16,439
If I had this book,

139
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,279
I'd have to read it for ten days and a half.

140
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:19,879
Childe Wu, you're too modest.

141
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,319
Not only are you insightful,

142
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,720
And you have Bodhisattva's heart.

143
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:24,879
I don't know how much higher

144
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:26,319
than those pedantic scholars.

145
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:27,600
No, no, no.

146
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,600
Mr. Wu,

147
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:31,920
today I redeemed myself from Chunhua House,

148
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,399
I'm alone now,

149
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,720
and I have nowhere to go,

150
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:36,160
If you don't dislike Zilan,

151
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,560
you are willing to serve him.

152
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,759
Stop.

153
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,480
Zilan knows her identity is low.

154
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,120
But you are the only one in the world who treats me sincerely.

155
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,839
Zilan has no other desires.

156
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:47,120
Even if I'm a slave or a maid,

157
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:48,720
I'm willing to do it.

158
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,199
If you don't agree,

159
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:53,000
Zilan won't be able to kneel.

160
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,000
Me,

161
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,439
Get up first.

162
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,839
I don't dislike your background,

163
00:05:59,040 --> 00:05:59,879
I do.

164
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:05,759
Let me tell you a secret.

165
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,120
Actually, I'm just.

166
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,720
You're a girl.

167
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,680
Fine, Wu Wancheng

168
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,560
and Zilan will have a private meeting.

169
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:25,759
I can't believe you did such a thing.

170
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:26,839
Get off.

171
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,240
It was Miss Zilan who said she would serve me.

172
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,199
So you agreed?

173
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:37,519
Say yes.

174
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,240
Let's talk about it when we get back to the Academy.

175
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,279
Miss Zilan,

176
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:44,560
what are your plans in the future?

177
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,959
I've thought about it before I came here.

178
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,120
If you don't take me in today,

179
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,480
I'll walk around,

180
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,800
It's a big world.

181
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:52,839
Go for a walk,

182
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,800
Young Master taught me that.

183
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,680
Luckily, you didn't stay.

184
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,759
This guy is not a fuel-efficient lamp.

185
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:00,079
It can cause trouble to the dead.

186
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:07,079
Miss,

187
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:08,480
as a woman,

188
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,959
I have something to tell you.

189
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,680
Reading is not only to make us wise,

190
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:14,680
but also to make us independent and self-reliant.

191
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:16,079
He's not attached to others.

192
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,120
So,

193
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,000
you have to think about what you should do in the future.

194
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:21,160
How to create a world of your own?

195
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,800
Thank you, Young Master.

196
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,879
Zilan wrote it down.

197
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:26,439
What are you whispering about?

198
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,759
What does it have to do with you?

199
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:30,240
Miss,

200
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:31,279
see you around.

201
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,319
See you,

202
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:35,560
gentlemen.

203
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:39,680
Let's go.

204
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:44,800
Brother Wu,

205
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,399
do you have something on your mind?

206
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:49,800
Brother Qi,

207
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,879
what do you think of

208
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:53,720
setting up a school?

209
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,480
Why do you think so?

210
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:00,360
Have you ever heard that "there is no class in teaching",

211
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,000
which is what Saint Kong said.

212
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,279
But although this sentence is simple,

213
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,160
it is even more difficult to make it.

214
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,759
But this kind of education is really fair.

215
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:11,720
Instead of being like us now,

216
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:13,839
with family background and background,

217
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,160
Even gender,

218
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:17,240
should be used as the standard of measurement.

219
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,879
I think

220
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,319
we can provide a place,

221
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:24,560
So that everyone can receive education without any difference,

222
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:25,720
but,

223
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:27,720
If Mr. Shan finds out about this,

224
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,519
he might expel us from the Academy.

225
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,399
But what are we studying for?

226
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:33,519
It's to repay the people and the court.

227
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:34,600
In my opinion,

228
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:36,360
this kind of thing is really meaningful.

229
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,000
What do you think?

230
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:39,200
Brother Wu,

231
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,840
I'm really impressed with you.

232
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,320
I'm willing to be with you.

233
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:50,840
Gaga,

234
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,320
Bugu.

235
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,120
How is it going?

236
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,879
The location and address have been selected.

237
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,200
In my private house outside my home,

238
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,720
that student,

239
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,600
Xifeng has got the roster ready.

240
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,320
I was able to get it today

241
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,639
and it still came to this.

242
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,559
Any other instructions?

243
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,159
Can you tell Wen Qi about this?

244
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:23,320
Of course not.

245
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,600
I knew you were hiding something from me.

246
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,080
What's wrong with you? You can't

247
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:27,840
walk quietly. When did you come?

248
00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:29,559
What are you hiding from me?

249
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,519
Tell me.

250
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,559
Master Feng,

251
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:36,600
what does Master Feng want from us?

252
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:37,559
That's right.

253
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:38,120
Master Feng,

254
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:38,840
let's go now.

255
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,519
Don't delay.

256
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:40,320
Okay, okay. Let's go.

257
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:42,559
Don't run. Make it clear.
