1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:06,839
1。

2
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,519
Darn Tang Wenqi,

3
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,399
if my leg heals, I'll kick you to death.

4
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:27,079
Brother Wu.

5
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:31,239
Are your feet feeling better?

6
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,439
What are you doing?

7
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,479
We haven't seen each other for a few days.

8
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:34,960
Why do you suddenly have such a hobby?

9
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:37,399
Are you feeling better?

10
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,359
It's this one.

11
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,799
How do you know?

12
00:00:45,799 --> 00:00:47,240
I just ran into Lingxiu at the door.

13
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:48,679
She told me you were badly hurt.

14
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:50,039
She told me to take good care of you.

15
00:00:50,679 --> 00:00:51,359
It's okay.

16
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:52,880
It's just over-dressing,

17
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:53,359
Look,

18
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,159
you can still move,

19
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:55,880
That's good.

20
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,039
No,

21
00:00:58,399 --> 00:00:59,759
Why did you come back early?

22
00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:02,280
My father found me a royal physician back home,

23
00:01:02,439 --> 00:01:03,280
and I took a few medicines,

24
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:04,079
I'm fine now.

25
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,319
That's great.

26
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,959
-No. -Are you okay?

27
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:07,480
It's okay.

28
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,519
Let me help you to bed.

29
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:09,159
No.

30
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:09,920
Let me help you to bed.

31
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:10,319
Let me help you.

32
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:10,879
Let me help you.

33
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:11,840
What are you two doing?

34
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:13,560
Wen Qi,

35
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,560
you're back.

36
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,359
Brother Qi,

37
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,480
don't talk to him.

38
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:17,719
He's the one who hurt me.

39
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,079
No, I didn't.

40
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,439
Don't wronged others.

41
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,319
I wronged you.

42
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,400
I found the evidence and I wronged you.

43
00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:25,879
What kind of evidence?

44
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,599
Have you seen the soles of Brother Qi's feet?

45
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,599
I've seen his feet. I

46
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:32,640
just want people who pass by that road,

47
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,719
There will be black mud on the soles of your feet,

48
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,280
how can you say that I am the murderer?

49
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:36,480
Me,

50
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,040
I am

51
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:39,519
… Why didn't you suspect Brother Qi?

52
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:42,280
Why would I suspect him?

53
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:43,719
He's recuperating at home.

54
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,159
How could he have time to harm me?

55
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,000
Okay,

56
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,879
Anyway, you two are the best in the world.

57
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:56,040
No,

58
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,359
your friendship,

59
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,799
Unbreakable,

60
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,239
Anyway,

61
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:01,319
I will definitely find the murderer.

62
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,760
Wait till then to apologize to me.

63
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:05,640
Wen Qi,

64
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,599
Brother Wu … It's not that I don't listen to

65
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:08,199
him.

66
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:08,520
No, no, no, no, no, no, no,

67
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,000
no, no, no, no.

68
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,039
I don't want to listen.

69
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,199
I'm sleepy.

70
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,000
Sleep,

71
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:17,759
Wen Qi,

72
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,199
I didn't mean that.

73
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:27,680
Brother Wu,

74
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,080
what are you doing?

75
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:31,800
You don't understand.

76
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,560
The exam is coming soon.

77
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:36,439
I want to pray for the koi to be possessed,

78
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:38,840
but I didn't get the koi,

79
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,479
Just use a few goldfish instead.

80
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:44,360
It's amazing to pray that

81
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:45,159
you must pass every exam.

82
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,599
I'll say goodbye, too.

83
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:51,680
Wait.

84
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,719
I always get the first place in the exam.

85
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,639
Why should I worship it?

86
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,080
Good tea.

87
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,159
Good tea.

88
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,400
All right,

89
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,879
get ready for class.

90
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:11,919
Qi Shan,

91
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,400
where's Tang Wenqi?

92
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,199
He,

93
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:23,240
I think he's out of his mind.

94
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:24,879
You don't even dare to attend my class.

95
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,159
Mr. Shan,

96
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:27,919
let's go to class first.

97
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:29,439
All right,

98
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,879
Master Feng,

99
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,719
Go and get him back.

100
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:34,599
What's going on?

101
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,599
I don't know.

102
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:38,919
Oh no.

103
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:41,759
Tang Wenqi will surely be beaten up this time.

104
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:43,599
What?

105
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:44,759
Fifty rattan sticks.

106
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,719
That's right.

107
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:47,400
Or did you call him personally?

108
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:49,039
That's called "cruel".

109
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:50,879
How is he now?

110
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,960
There's only half a life left, right?

111
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,599
Although he often skips classes,

112
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,280
he will never be absent on an important day.

113
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:01,919
Unless there's someone more important.

114
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:03,159
Don't mention it.

115
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:04,759
Boss went to the temple,

116
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,599
the temple,

117
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,039
Did he really go to look for the girl in Tsing Yi?

118
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:10,879
I don't know what happened to him recently,

119
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,800
but he saved a woman in Tsing Yi some time ago,

120
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:16,680
As a result, I fell in love with my family at first sight.

121
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:18,480
A few days ago,

122
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:20,600
I learned that he was staying at the temple,

123
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:21,879
As soon as I got the news,

124
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,839
I hurried there.

125
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,879
For a woman,

126
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,000
the mountain leader was furious when he found out,

127
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,000
Hang it up and hit it.

128
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:30,199
Brother Wu,

129
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,959
let's go get Wen Qi back.

130
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,480
Qi,

131
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:35,000
you go first. I'm going to get something.

132
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:35,959
I'll see you in the supervisor

133
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:36,759
later.

134
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:38,600
Brother Qi,

135
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,639
I asked Lingxiu for some medicine to promote blood circulation and remove blood stasis,

136
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,959
You can give it to Tang Wenqi.

137
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,079
You even know how to get me medicine?

138
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:48,319
You're injured and you're still playing.

139
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:50,000
What are you playing?

140
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:51,439
This is a coincidence,

141
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:52,560
not a toy.

142
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:57,639
I'm sorry.

143
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,399
What?

144
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,079
I'm sorry.

145
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:04,639
What?

146
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:06,240
I'm sorry,

147
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:10,279
I saw you looking for someone on the street that day.

148
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,639
I just want to play a little joke on you.

149
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:14,680
I told the beggar that I had seen her.

150
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:16,360
I didn't expect that you would really go.

151
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:17,560
He even skipped the exam.

152
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,800
I didn't expect Mountain Owner would be so cruel.

153
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,800
I know you said it.

154
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:22,680
You know,

155
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,720
why are you still going?

156
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:25,199
I didn't go.

157
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,480
You didn't go?

158
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:28,399
I lied.

159
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,000
I didn't go to the temple.

160
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,920
I went to the smithy,

161
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,040
the smithy,

162
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,519
I'm going to investigate the real murderer for you, right?

163
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,120
So,

164
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:41,079
it's really not you.

165
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:43,199
Ridiculous.

166
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,319
I, Tang Wenqi, have been sitting straight all my life,

167
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,360
how could I do such a little trick behind my back?

168
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,920
Then why did you lie?

169
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,160
Because I found out that

170
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,000
the person who released the trap was actually Chen Lan,

171
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,480
Chen Lan,

172
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,480
when did I offend him?

173
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:06,240
There's something fishy about it.

174
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,879
Let's talk about it after I figure it out.

175
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,800
It seems that I really wronged him.

176
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:13,600
Wu (Wu)

177
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:16,279
(Why did you come to the ancient times and do stupid things?

178
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:18,639
Okay,

179
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:19,879
Got it.

180
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,199
how about

181
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,360
Apply the medicine for me.

182
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,879
You hurt me.

183
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,759
We can't just let it go.

184
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:36,120
I'd like to see what you're doing. What are you doing?

185
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:37,399
apply medicine

186
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:39,079
Where is it?

187
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,040
Nonsense.

188
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,480
Ass, of course.

189
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,800
butt

190
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:45,480
Take off your pants.

191
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:48,879
You don't have to take it all off.

192
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:51,079
Why don't you take it all off?

193
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,040
If it's not convenient for you,

194
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:55,959
let me take it off for you.

195
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,639
Fine, fine,

196
00:06:57,639 --> 00:06:57,920
that

197
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,560
I … I … I … I … Wait for Brother Qi to come back.

198
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:00,680
Wait for Brother Qi?

199
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,160
I can take it off for you now.

200
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:02,920
No, no, no.

201
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,959
No, I really don't need it.

202
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,480
Thank you.

203
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:06,759
Help! Brother Qi.

204
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:07,600
What?

205
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,800
Lower your voice.

206
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:11,240
Do you want everyone to hear it?

207
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,120
Wait for me to sort it out.

208
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:15,040
Could it be that

209
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,120
you have feelings for Tang Wenqi too?

210
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,040
My point is,

211
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:21,879
Tang Wenqi is not the one who dug the hole.

212
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,360
Got it?

213
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:24,319
Understood.

214
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,439
So you like Qi Shan a little more?

215
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,879
Tang Wenqi is a bit more,

216
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:31,680
I don't think you understand.

217
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:37,000
This is so romantic.

218
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,920
A handsome young man,

219
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,800
and a young playboy,

220
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:43,439
How will the heroine choose?

221
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,680
What a bloody Mary Sue.

222
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:47,000
What will you choose, Sister Wu?

223
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,160
Calm down.

224
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,439
I'm not done yet.

225
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,040
Tang Wenqi also said that

226
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,639
the person who bought the trapper,

227
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:54,560
It's Chen Lan.

228
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,839
Could it be that,

229
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:00,120
Someone is going to join this romantic fight again.

230
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,240
I shouldn't have come to you today.

231
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:04,120
Goodbye.

232
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:05,920
Chen Lan

233
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,160
Mr. Shan is here.

234
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:12,920
Boss, you scared me.

235
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:13,639
Cut the crap!

236
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Why did you lend me your shoes?

237
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,000
Why do you ask?

238
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,319
Of course you have to wear shoes.

239
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,000
If you keep talking nonsense,

240
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:25,240
I'll get out.

241
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,399
Okay.

242
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,399
It's good to be punished.

243
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:31,800
I don't have to attend classes,

244
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:32,799
and nobody cares about me.

245
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,240
The people who live in Tianzi,

246
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:37,720
don't they have brains?

247
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:39,799
Younian is right. Look at them

248
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:41,519
getting hurt one after another,

249
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:42,480
I'm really relieved.

250
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,399
Wu Wancheng,

251
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:45,840
the son of a mere general,

252
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:47,799
You deserve to show off your power in front of me,

253
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,639
and Tang Wenqi,

254
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:51,399
You deserve to embarrass me

255
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,440
in public.

256
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:54,159
Yes,

257
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,360
our senior is His Lordship's son,

258
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:58,720
They only know how to play tricks,

259
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,120
but they don't dare to do anything.

260
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,919
And Chen Lan,

261
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:04,240
I just threatened him

262
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,960
with his father's small official position.

263
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:07,879
He's as good as a dog,

264
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,360
and he knows how to dig holes.

265
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,120
Why are you here?

266
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,240
I saw you and Chen Lan sneaking around,

267
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,120
so I sneaked out to have a look.

268
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,720
You heard it.

269
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,639
Yes, I did.

270
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,799
I have to beat him half to death today.

271
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,480
Calm down.

272
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,399
By the way, you're really nice to Chen Lan,

273
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,519
yet you're willing to beat a prince of the Marquis's Mansion for him.

274
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,039
It's not just because of him.

275
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,039
More importantly, he hurt you.

276
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:38,279
He did it for me.

277
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:41,720
I mean,

278
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:42,519
okay,

279
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,240
I'll go back to class first.
