1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:06,960
1。

2
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,440
This jade pendant,

3
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:23,320
only my father and his cronies know about it.

4
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,039
Uncle Tang, you don't recognize me, do you?

5
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:30,280
This jade pendant is true,

6
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,280
but at your age,

7
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,799
You're too young.

8
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:36,759
I … I … I … I practiced martial arts since I

9
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:38,119
was a child,

10
00:00:38,359 --> 00:00:40,119
I'm in good health.

11
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,000
It's not strange to be younger.

12
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:43,039
It's not strange.

13
00:00:44,359 --> 00:00:45,479
It's not strange.

14
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,679
When I think about it,

15
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,159
it's been more than ten years.

16
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,799
Back then,

17
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,840
our two families used to marry each other,

18
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,159
I'm not marrying that idiot.

19
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:00,079
Uncle Tang,

20
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:03,840
my father praised Gu Yuan Academy,

21
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,719
He asked me to bow to you.

22
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:08,719
All the way here,

23
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,040
I've been through the wind and frost,

24
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,719
The sun and the wind,

25
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:14,640
Uncle Tang,

26
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,959
Please accept me.

27
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,200
Please get up,

28
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,000
nephew. It's been a long journey.

29
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,719
It's not hard. Actually,

30
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,120
your father and I are close friends

31
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,319
and should be taken care of.

32
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:28,560
Okay,

33
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,200
I'll ask someone to arrange a supervisor for you

34
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,319
Uncle Tang Are you willing to let me stay?

35
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:34,719
Of course,

36
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:36,079
Qi Shan,

37
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:36,719
No,

38
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,480
gunpowder. I'm coming.

39
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,599
I heard that you are the son of a general,

40
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,120
so I have to tell you about

41
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,319
the rules of the Academy,

42
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,079
The most important thing is to be in order,

43
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:49,920
when you see the teachers and seniors,

44
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,280
You have to say hello,

45
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,079
understand?

46
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,120
There's no handsome guy at all.

47
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,120
You're just a fourth-grade chicken.

48
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,040
What chicken?

49
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,760
Where are chickens in the Academy?

50
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:02,000
Are you listening to me or not?

51
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:02,719
Me,

52
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:04,840
You must be the new student.

53
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,640
I finally found him.

54
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,960
Why didn't I notice

55
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,280
his face was so small during the day,

56
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:14,039
I can't see him tonight,

57
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,400
so I went to pick him up.

58
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:17,879
Or is Qi Shan polite?

59
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
That's great. You can take him to the supervisor.

60
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,120
Senior is tired today,

61
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,479
so go back and rest first.

62
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,240
Take care, senior.

63
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:26,960
Okay,

64
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,639
I finally found you.

65
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:30,840
You found me.

66
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,520
I look familiar.

67
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:34,039
Hello. My name is Wu Wancheng.

68
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,759
From now on, we're roommates.

69
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:36,439
This way.

70
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,520
In this prison,

71
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,000
there might be gunpowder,

72
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,560
Let me take a good look.

73
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:02,000
Why are you here?

74
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:03,759
This is my supervisor.

75
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:05,120
Why can't I be here?

76
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,439
You live here too?

77
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:08,159
You live here

78
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,560
in the middle of the night and walk around,

79
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,840
I don't want anyone to sleep.

80
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,120
I don't want to talk nonsense with you.

81
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,120
Stay as long as you can.

82
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:14,280
Get out if you can't stay.

83
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,240
You're sneaking around in the middle of the night.

84
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:38,120
Why did people do experiments in ancient times?

85
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,680
This is sulfur.

86
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,240
He's making gunpowder.

87
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:53,159
You can't do this.

88
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:56,159
Candles don't burn completely,

89
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,439
the temperature is not enough to purify sulfur.

90
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:00,879
How do you know

91
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:03,840
the smell of my place? It's hard to know.

92
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,479
How should we purify it?

93
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,960
No,

94
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,719
why did you make gunpowder?

95
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:15,919
Personal hobby,

96
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,040
maybe,

97
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,879
Does he know that I'm making an invention?

98
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,920
Collecting gunpowder without permission is punishable.

99
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:24,399
You were blown up, too.

100
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:27,759
Palace Jade Liquor,

101
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,120
what are you talking about?

102
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:31,959
How is this wine?

103
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:34,199
What do you want to ask?

104
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:36,199
I don't think we're on the same side.

105
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,600
Anyway, no matter what,

106
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:41,000
do you want to work together?

107
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,120
According to what you've done,

108
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,279
you won't be able to make it in a month.

109
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:50,079
We can cooperate,

110
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,279
but we can't reveal the source of the materials.

111
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:55,199
It's just Qi Shan.

112
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,240
You want to protect your brother, don't you?

113
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,759
Okay, no problem.

114
00:04:59,240 --> 00:04:59,959
Bro

115
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:02,399
Luckily, you didn't suspect me.

116
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,240
Okay,

117
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,519
It's a deal.

118
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:07,079
We also have this here.

119
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:10,000
Sure.

120
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,839
I'm sure it'll be fine this time.

121
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:42,800
What are you doing?

122
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:44,160
Tang Wenqi,

123
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:46,519
be careful!

124
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:58,560
Wu Wancheng,

125
00:05:58,839 --> 00:06:00,160
do you want to go to school or not?

126
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,439
I was wrong, Mr. Shan.

127
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,959
Of course I want to go to school.

128
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,759
I have my own reasons.

129
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:06,120
Then tell me about it.

130
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,240
Why did you blow up the Academy?

131
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:09,160
Me

132
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:10,279
Wu Wancheng, come out!

133
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:11,040
Tang Wenqi,

134
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:12,079
what are you arguing about?

135
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:13,319
Father,

136
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,160
Mr. Shan,

137
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:17,600
look, I've been injured.

138
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:19,160
What kind of self-study do you need?

139
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,600
Can't I have a good rest?

140
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:21,680
Stand still.

141
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,240
What happened today,

142
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,920
has something to do with you.

143
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:26,079
Father,

144
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,560
It's not bad for me.

145
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,959
The explosives are all his.

146
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:30,439
It's all his fault.

147
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:31,519
It has nothing to do with me.

148
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,720
What a good Tang Wenqi,

149
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,079
how could he repay kindness with enmity?

150
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,800
Do you have nothing to do with the equipment

151
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:38,959
used to make gunpowder?

152
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,879
He usually does messy things,

153
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:42,720
Okay,

154
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,879
Since you're so energetic,

155
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:46,759
clean the yard for ten days.

156
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,959
I'm sorry, sir.

157
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,879
I won't play with fire in the Academy anymore.

158
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,279
Don't make me clean it.

159
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:54,000
Father,

160
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:56,639
How can I sweep the Academy?

161
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,639
I'm embarrassing you, aren't I?

162
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,759
Wouldn't it be embarrassing to blow up the school?

163
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:01,959
If you say it again,

164
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:02,959
scan it for a month.

165
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,560
Two people will be punished.

166
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,040
Why should I work alone?

167
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,720
I was dragged down by some idiot.

168
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:26,319
If you hadn't suddenly come in,

169
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:27,639
the explosives would have blown you up.

170
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,759
You admitted it too.

171
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,959
It's all your fault.

172
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:34,279
Why didn't you tell me that I saved you?

173
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:35,600
I saved your life.

174
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:38,240
You're the one who made the mistake.

175
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:39,560
Isn't that what you should do?

176
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:41,399
Don't tell me that.

177
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:43,439
As Mr. Shan said,

178
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,199
one and a half of us will be responsible for it.

179
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,199
Get back to work!

180
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:48,560
You.

181
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:59,160
Does this count as saving your life?

182
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,399
It's not right for you

183
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,959
to let go Wu Wancheng,

184
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:03,959
You're obviously a boy,

185
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,319
why are you

186
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,000
so soft?

187
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:11,079
Just do your job.

188
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,279
I really don't get it.

189
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:31,000
Sorry I didn't hold it steady,

190
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:32,039
Wen Qi,

191
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,200
What are you doing?

192
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,720
I've apologized.

193
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:35,840
I said I was not careful,

194
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,720
unlike some people,

195
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,200
He got injured.

196
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,600
I don't know how to apologize,

197
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:42,679
Tang Wenqi,

198
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,039
I told you, didn't I?

199
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,080
I didn't do it on purpose.

200
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,240
I didn't do it on purpose.

201
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:48,440
I didn't mean to get my rattan

202
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,480
drawn last time.

203
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:50,559
Last time when I was

204
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:51,480
Wen Qi,

205
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:53,600
Last time, it was a punishment for coming home late.

206
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:55,000
How can you blame Brother Wu?

207
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,679
We've known each other for so long.

208
00:08:57,759 --> 00:08:59,080
But you helped him.

209
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,279
I'm not helping him.

210
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,080
Brother Qi,

211
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,840
Tang Wenqi,

212
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,200
This is between you and me.

213
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,039
Tell me.

214
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:07,879
What do you want to do?

215
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,720
You made me suffer so much.

216
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:12,960
How about

217
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,240
I punch you twice,

218
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,279
Okay, you play,

219
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:18,919
Brother Wu

220
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:20,240
Wen Qi is a martial artist,

221
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,840
you can't stand his two punches.

222
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:23,120
Brother Qi is fine,

223
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,600
You fight

224
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,759
Wen Qi.

225
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,720
Wen Qi.

226
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,000
What's wrong with you?

227
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,519
I won't argue with a sissy.

228
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,600
You're the sissy!

229
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,440
Wen Qi,
