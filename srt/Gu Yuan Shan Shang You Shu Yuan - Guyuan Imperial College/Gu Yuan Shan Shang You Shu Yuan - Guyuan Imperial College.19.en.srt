1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,080
1。

2
00:00:57,759 --> 00:00:58,880
Come on, Tang Wenqi.

3
00:00:59,479 --> 00:01:00,640
It's such a great opportunity,

4
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:01,920
Kiss her.

5
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:28,079
Darts.

6
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:34,719
You want to play this?

7
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,400
When I was a park killer,

8
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:39,719
the stall owners saw me,

9
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:40,680
There's nothing I'm not afraid of.

10
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:42,200
The park is.

11
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:46,879
Stop asking and pay for it.

12
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,799
All right,

13
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:50,200
boss. Five rounds,

14
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,480
Okay,

15
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,120
Here,

16
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,680
Good for you, young man.

17
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,959
After marrying such a great wife,

18
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,400
You'll be lucky for the rest of your life.

19
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,400
No, I'm not.

20
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:01,159
Boss,

21
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:01,760
thank you.

22
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,840
Five more rounds.

23
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:03,920
No problem.

24
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:05,359
Come on.

25
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,000
Let's play.

26
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,599
He's even a park killer.

27
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,919
I think you're the boss's God of Wealth.

28
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,039
Are you done?

29
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:22,400
I'll pay you back.

30
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,120
That's not necessary.

31
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,319
Just tell me what gift you want next time.

32
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,479
I'll just buy one for you.

33
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:28,479
Why bother?

34
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:30,240
How do you know I like that hairpin?

35
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,280
How can I not know that you've seen through it?

36
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:35,680
What a pity.

37
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:37,759
I must practice darts hard next time.

38
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:38,759
Win it back.

39
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:40,240
Watch out!

40
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:03,400
I'm

41
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,159
so sorry,

42
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,280
I drank too much yesterday,

43
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:08,319
but I haven't recovered yet,

44
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:09,960
Why did you come out if you didn't recover?

45
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:11,759
I have to come.

46
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:13,000
I'm not coming. Didn't you go to see

47
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,960
some pretty man's show?

48
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,360
What kind of handsome man is there?

49
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,039
Besides,

50
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,000
what does a handsome man have to do with you?

51
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,400
Why is it none of my business?

52
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,400
You're mine.

53
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,360
Your what?

54
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,479
You can't say it, can you?

55
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,120
You're mine.

56
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,520
Oh no.

57
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,520
He's good at it.

58
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:50,319
He's not going to kiss me, is he?

59
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,680
Good roommate,

60
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,719
go away!

61
00:03:58,879 --> 00:03:59,919
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

62
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:00,680
Don't talk to me.

63
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:01,719
Where are you going?

64
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,919
Don't talk to me.

65
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,520
You're not looking for Lingxiu, are you?

66
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,319
Can't you tell they did it on purpose?

67
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,039
Where am I going?

68
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:09,719
Let's go.

69
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,719
I'll take you to a nice place.

70
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,839
This is the good place you mentioned?

71
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,040
I've prepared everything.

72
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,800
What are you doing?

73
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:31,439
Actually,

74
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,759
when I first met the woman in Tsing Yi,

75
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:36,360
I've made up my mind.

76
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,399
Let her see the most beautiful fireworks in the world.

77
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:43,680
So you studied gunpowder,

78
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:45,360
for fireworks.

79
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,639
Yeah,

80
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:49,439
I thought,

81
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:51,439
Look at that,

82
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:54,360
Three,

83
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:55,720
Two,

84
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,079
One.

85
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:05,839
It's so pretty.

86
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,040
So pretty.

87
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,000
Oh, right.

88
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,439
This is for you.

89
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:39,920
Isn't this the hairpin just now?

90
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:56,600
That's right.

91
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:58,560
Don't you want it?

92
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,040
You didn't pay for it, did you?

93
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:02,120
How is that possible?

94
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:03,800
I won this with my own hands, okay?

95
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:07,600
You are me.

96
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,920
-It's you. -What is your

97
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,319
good roommate?

98
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:19,480
You're the girl I like.

99
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,680
Wu...

100
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:23,720
I like you.

101
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:38,360
Lingxiu,

102
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:40,199
let me do it.

103
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:41,319
Don't tire you out.

104
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:43,600
Didn't you just say that?

105
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,600
Our husband and wife are united,

106
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,519
and our profits are cut off.

107
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,720
Husband and wife,

108
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:48,879
wait.

109
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:50,079
Husband and wife,

110
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:52,000
we,

111
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:53,639
Husband and wife,

112
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:54,959
all right,

113
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,079
Sprinkle the petals.

114
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,079
Okay, okay.

115
00:06:58,199 --> 00:06:59,040
Husband and wife,

116
00:06:59,079 --> 00:06:59,839
husband and wife,

117
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:01,079
Husband and wife.

118
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:08,959
By the way,

119
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:10,399
why are there petals here?

120
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,920
It doesn't matter.

121
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:54,560
This kind of campus love is so dreamy.

122
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:01,839
Are you all right, Brother Wu?

123
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:02,720
You're blushing,

124
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,959
How about I ask Lingxiu to show it to you?

125
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:05,920
No, no, no.

126
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,600
I'll just go out and get some fresh air.

127
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,519
Why are you dressed like this?

128
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:17,639
Is this something I can read without spending money on?

129
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,439
What are you doing?

130
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,279
Let me have a look.

131
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,759
Chestnut wants to see you. Go

132
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,959
and have a look.

133
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,199
What can he do for me?

134
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,840
Don't rush to get dressed.

135
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,799
Wait for me.

136
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:48,279
I don't know what kind of stimulation she suffered.

137
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,960
Love always hurts.

138
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,720
Don't talk nonsense.

139
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,080
My Lady,

140
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,159
I finally found you.

141
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:10,759
What's the matter? Why are you in such a hurry?

142
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,799
General,

143
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:12,879
you're here. What?

144
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:15,919
Oh no.

145
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,679
I'm really done for today.
