1
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,480
When you were running a private school,

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,519
did you ever think about the consequences?

3
00:00:25,399 --> 00:00:27,320
Why did you read a book in ancient times?

4
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:28,960
There are so many things to do.

5
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,119
Mr. Shan,

6
00:00:34,119 --> 00:00:35,759
I've already said hello to my father.

7
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:36,880
Father, what you mean is,

8
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:38,560
it hasn't spread yet.

9
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:40,280
Let's handle it internally.

10
00:00:41,479 --> 00:00:43,679
Thank you later, Marquis E.

11
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,399
But this is a serious matter.

12
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,640
I think,

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,159
it's better to expel these three people from the Academy.

14
00:00:51,799 --> 00:00:52,880
Otherwise, father's disciples

15
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:55,000
won't be able to explain it to him.

16
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:58,039
I knew you didn't mean well.

17
00:00:59,079 --> 00:00:59,719
Mr. Shan,

18
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:00,840
I came up with the idea.

19
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:02,520
Get rid of me if you want to rush.

20
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:03,200
Brother Qi,

21
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,200
what nonsense are you talking about?

22
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,959
Mr. Shan, it's me.

23
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:07,439
Stop it.

24
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,680
Go tidy it up.

25
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,079
Get ready to leave the Academy.

26
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,480
Father,

27
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,400
Give us another chance.

28
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:22,040
Mr. Shan, we really know that we were wrong.

29
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,680
Brother Qi,

30
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:26,079
what?

31
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:28,439
The three of them will be expelled from the Academy.

32
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,359
That's right, father.

33
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,200
Go and have a look.

34
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:32,920
Lingxiu,

35
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:34,439
go get that contract.

36
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,400
I'm going to save her.

37
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,480
Contract,

38
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,319
But,

39
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,200
This is the only way now.

40
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:39,760
Yes

41
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,239
head of a mountain

42
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,799
Do you need disciples to take the three of them out?

43
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:48,920
Tang Wenqi,

44
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,519
wait.

45
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:54,760
Mountain Chief,

46
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:55,760
Master Feng,

47
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,799
Master Feng,

48
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,799
these three people set up private schools,

49
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,840
To discredit the Academy,

50
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:01,840
I was ordered by the chief of the mountain.

51
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:02,439
Put them,

52
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,079
just in time,

53
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,319
That's why I'm here.

54
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:08,120
Master Feng, this is

55
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,960
Master Shan Do you remember this contract?

56
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:18,599
It seems that Master Feng

57
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,599
has agreed to succeed the next Mountain Chief,

58
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:22,960
As agreed on that day,

59
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,560
can you still count today?

60
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:25,599
Of course, count.

61
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:28,039
Seriously, any condition is fine.

62
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:29,960
Master, please go ahead.

63
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:34,240
I only ask Mr. Shan,

64
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:37,000
to give these three students a chance.

65
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,719
Master,

66
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,439
these three people made a big mistake.

67
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,400
I'm afraid there's something wrong with Sage's move.

68
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,599
It's not easy for me to explain to my father.

69
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,719
What a joke.

70
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:49,120
I'm Senior Tutor of the previous dynasty,

71
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:50,800
Your Majesty,

72
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,120
do I have to explain everything

73
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,199
to your father,

74
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,520
I dare not. All right,

75
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,520
all right.

76
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,039
In that case,

77
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,879
I'll give you three a chance.

78
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:05,360
Mr. Xie, get up

79
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,599
Thank you, Master Feng,

80
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:09,759
I can forgive you.

81
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:11,439
It's just that Tang Wenqi

82
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:13,639
is in the final exam this year,

83
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:16,319
You have to get into the top three.

84
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:17,639
Otherwise,

85
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:19,159
the punishment will remain the same.

86
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,080
What?

87
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,759
Top three.

88
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:30,560
Let Tang Wenqi get into the top three.

89
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:33,680
It's harder than letting a dog speak human language.

90
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,159
It's true,

91
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,520
but it hurts a lot to say that.

92
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,319
It's okay,

93
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:39,039
Brother Qi. She's right.

94
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:42,400
This is too hard.

95
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:46,159
Then we have to work hard.

96
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,800
You can't really leave the Academy, can you?

97
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,439
That's right.

98
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,240
I can't say it's E Fei's heart.

99
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:50,879
Exactly

100
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:52,360
How dare you threaten my father?

101
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:54,000
If it wasn't for saving his father's face,

102
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:55,280
he would have been killed long ago.

103
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,919
Don't fight for me if you have the ability.

104
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:58,879
Wen Qi,

105
00:03:59,039 --> 00:03:59,840
tell me the truth,

106
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,719
What do you know?

107
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,080
Then I'll know

108
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,599
where to make up for you, right?

109
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:08,080
Well,

110
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:10,879
don't you know,

111
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:12,479
You can't do anything.

112
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:18,519
What if Brother Qi is smart?

113
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:28,360
In that case,

114
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,439
for the sake of our future,

115
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,480
I hereby announce,

116
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:34,560
Tang Wenqi's Purgatory Tutoring Program,

117
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,000
It will be officially

118
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:40,399
launched tomorrow.

119
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:43,959
Let's not do it tomorrow.

120
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:45,079
Let's do it today.

121
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,560
Let's do the Black Yellow

122
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:50,800
of Heaven and Earth today,

123
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,439
The universe is wild,

124
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:53,720
the sun and the moon are full,

125
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,079
Chensu,

126
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,040
what are you doing?

127
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:12,560
I see the setting sun

128
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,519
in the misty bamboos among the hills.

129
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,839
Birds fly up the eaves,

130
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:20,240
clouds come out of the windows,

131
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:23,199
Tang Wenqi,

132
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,639
what are the last two lines of the poem

133
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:26,759
I taught you yesterday?

134
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,399
Birds fly up the eaves,

135
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:31,839
clouds come out of the windows,

136
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:33,120
Okay,

137
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:33,720
Okay.

138
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:40,680
Boss,

139
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:41,879
you have a nosebleed.

140
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:42,839
Blood,

141
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:43,759
What blood?

142
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:49,319
What should I do?

143
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:03,759
For the sake of success,

144
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,120
you have to stick to it.

145
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:23,199
Water,

146
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:24,439
I want some water.

147
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:38,439
Brother Wu,

148
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:39,399
we're out of water.

149
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:42,000
I'll go pick up

150
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,879
Li Zigao,

151
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:58,839
Why are you here?

152
00:06:58,959 --> 00:06:59,839
Long time no see,

153
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,160
Wu Wancheng.

154
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,279
It's so slow to fetch water.

155
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:12,319
You can be regarded as,

156
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,600
this one,

157
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:15,279
This is

158
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,680
for you to introduce,

159
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:18,839
This is chestnut.

160
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,120
I'm General Wu's deputy general.

161
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:22,399
Wu Wancheng grew up,

162
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:23,279
Li Zigao,

163
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,360
Put your hands down.

164
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,519
They know you're a girl,

165
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,639
they know,

166
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:37,399
It's a long story.

167
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:38,560
I'll talk to you later.

168
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:39,800
Okay.

169
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:45,879
Since you two know that Sister Hua Hua is a woman,

170
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,720
I might as well tell you,

171
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:50,600
In fact, I have another identity,

172
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:51,839
that is,

173
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,120
the fiancé

174
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:54,120
of Hua Hua's younger sister,

175
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:55,399
What?

176
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,439
What are you talking about?

177
00:07:57,639 --> 00:07:58,600
Can you introduce him to me?

178
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:06,759
From now on,

179
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:08,279
I'm also a member of Gu Yuan Academy.

180
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:09,759
Please take care of me in the future.

181
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:15,959
May I know your names?

182
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:18,959
His name is Qi Shan.

183
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:20,800
His name is Tang Wenqi,

184
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,399
I'll leave it to you from now on.

185
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:26,639
Boss,

186
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,720
Qi Shan is back.

187
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,879
Mu Xiu asked me to study by myself,

188
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:31,480
if I didn't order something delicious today,

189
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:32,440
I won't spare you.

190
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,080
What's this?

191
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:38,399
This one

192
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,720
It's the new signboard of the dim sum shop.

193
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,000
I specially asked Xi Feng

194
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,799
to buy the snacks,

195
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,960
You know me well.

196
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:48,120
Chestnut cakes are hard to buy.

197
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:50,559
I went there several times but I couldn't get it.

198
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:52,240
Wait.

199
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,559
What do you think this is?

200
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,559
Chestnut cake,

201
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,159
try it. It's delicious.

202
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:56,720
I don't want to eat.

203
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,679
Anyone who likes it can eat it.

204
00:08:58,559 --> 00:08:59,919
I won't stand on ceremony then.

205
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:02,360
Wen Qi,

206
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:04,279
don't you usually like sweets the most?

207
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,799
What's going on today? Who likes

208
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,720
chestnut cake? What's so good about it?

209
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:11,679
It's delicious.

210
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,039
It's delicious.

211
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:12,600
It's so noisy.

212
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:13,559
How to study?

213
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:20,200
Brother Qi,

214
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,279
what's wrong with Boss?

215
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,519
He's allergic to chestnuts. He goes crazy

216
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:24,919
when he sees chestnuts.

217
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:26,159
Allergic?

218
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:27,600
Why haven't I heard of it?

219
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:30,320
I only found out yesterday.

220
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,039
It's delicious.
