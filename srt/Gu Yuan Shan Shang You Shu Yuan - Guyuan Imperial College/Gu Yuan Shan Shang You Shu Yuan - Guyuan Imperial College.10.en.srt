1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:06,960
1。

2
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,160
Wen Qi,

3
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,839
this is the way you mentioned to punish E-Fei.

4
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:30,440
I've discussed it with Wu, Wan and Chengdu,

5
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:32,880
you just have to wait and see.

6
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,119
Qi Shan, lie down!

7
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:40,799
Tang Wenqi is making explosives again?

8
00:00:41,479 --> 00:00:42,399
What's wrong with you?

9
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:44,799
today

10
00:00:45,159 --> 00:00:46,000
Stop making explosives.

11
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:49,079
Get up.

12
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:50,000
What are you afraid of?

13
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:53,759
This is the tool Wen Qi used to punish E Fei.

14
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:55,520
Punish E Fei.

15
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:56,920
What's wrong with him?

16
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:01,000
What's wrong with him?

17
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,759
Don't you know?

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,640
Boss

19
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,439
Qishan,

20
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,359
you all know.

21
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:10,840
I know.

22
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,319
He threatened you with your father's official position.

23
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:15,760
However,

24
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,239
I can't just forgive you.

25
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,200
What do you think?

26
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:20,519
Boss,

27
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,920
I'm sorry.

28
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,480
I'm sorry, Wu Wancheng.

29
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:26,719
Don't be sorry.

30
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:28,319
Punishment.

31
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,159
I've made up my mind.

32
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:37,519
Change the punishment. Change the punishment.

33
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,680
My foot hurts so much.

34
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,560
Wear,

35
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:46,920
Did I walk through it?

36
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:48,959
I wish I had told you earlier.

37
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:49,879
Brother Chen,

38
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:51,519
thank you so much.

39
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:54,920
Come here.

40
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:00,000
I bribed Efei's

41
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,840
follower earlier today.

42
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,640
Guess.

43
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,680
What is he most afraid of

44
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,879
Ghost,

45
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,639
So our plan is to pretend to be a ghost

46
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,840
so that he can't get out of bed.

47
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,039
Ask questions,

48
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:13,680
Tell me,

49
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,639
What have you prepared?

50
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,240
Have you ever heard of it,

51
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:21,319
Smoke,

52
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:22,879
Fog,

53
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:25,520
Play

54
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:38,080
Tang Wenqi, if I ask you to get a skateboard,

55
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:38,960
how can you lose the chain?

56
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,319
Don't worry,

57
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:43,080
let me give you a once-and-for-all,

58
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,479
Don't use idioms if you don't know how to use them.

59
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,479
What are you two doing?

60
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:46,719
I don't think we can move anymore.

61
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:48,919
The wheel is ready,

62
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,439
the rope is ready,

63
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:53,360
Chen Lan,

64
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,400
hold the smoke bomb,

65
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:56,199
Order it as soon as I give you the signal.

66
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:59,319
The rest of you will follow my signal.

67
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:00,360
Got it?

68
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,680
Understood.

69
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:05,520
Smile.

70
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:15,919
E Fei, E Fei,

71
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,199
I'm here for you.

72
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:19,800
Who?

73
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,639
Who's there?

74
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:24,599
You betrayed my love,

75
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:26,639
took a debt of conscience,

76
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,159
At last, I shed tears

77
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:31,879
when I knew the truth.

78
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:35,479
I'll pester you for the rest of my life.

79
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,719
Aunt,

80
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:38,159
I'll do whatever you want me to do.

81
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,479
Don't pester me.

82
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:40,879
I'm still young.

83
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:46,599
Then why

84
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,599
isn't my house moving?

85
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,319
Let's go!

86
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,960
Hurry up.

87
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:08,879
Why did Master Feng

88
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:10,439
ask them to come?

89
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:13,000
I was supposed to be the student of E Fei,

90
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:14,800
but I don't know what's wrong with me today,

91
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:17,040
Those people took a group leave this morning.

92
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,199
Only Wu Wancheng and the others

93
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,879
know the Academy better.

94
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:23,759
All right.

95
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:24,839
Hurry up.

96
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:25,639
Okay,

97
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,639
Tang Wenqi,

98
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,600
who asked you to give laxatives to those minions?

99
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:32,800
None of his minions is a good person.

100
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:34,000
They deserve it.

101
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:36,360
But now, we have to

102
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:38,040
do some chores for them.

103
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,399
Don't you lose more than you gain?

104
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,399
I can do whatever I want.

105
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,399
Don't worry about me.

106
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,079
Don't think I don't know what you've done.

107
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,120
Behave yourself today.

108
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:49,920
Otherwise, I won't be able to protect you.

109
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:54,199
Let me tell you what we should pay attention to today.

110
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:56,480
Your task

111
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,759
is to register information for the examinee.

112
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,040
I want to screen out all the students from civilian backgrounds.

113
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,639
Because they are not qualified to take the exam.

114
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,639
Did you hear me clearly?

115
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,720
Understood.

116
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:09,759
What kind of rule is that?

117
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,360
I'm speechless.

118
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,160
Next

119
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,480
Name,

120
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:18,480
Where do you live?

121
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:19,240
Anshi,

122
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:20,160
a native of Guyuan,

123
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,560
Did you get any fame or merit?

124
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,639
I'm not talented.

125
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,720
I only have one scholar.

126
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,120
Now that I want to continue my studies at Gu Yuan Academy,

127
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,160
what do my parents do?

128
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:32,480
My parents run a shop.

129
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,920
What a pity.

130
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,720
Now I have no chance to be with the showboat.

131
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,480
I've been focusing on books since I was a child,

132
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,439
and I've written a lot of articles on weekdays,

133
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:40,839
Senior, you can have a look.

134
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:48,360
At Gu Yuan's level, he's a first-class student anyway.

135
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:49,920
As I know,

136
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:52,600
Gu Yuan Academy has always only admitted to the school of the last disciples,

137
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,000
But I still want to have a try today.

138
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,480
I really want to study in Guyuan Academy,

139
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:57,800
although I also know that

140
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,720
it's hard for merchants.

141
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,360
Calm down.

142
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:01,439
Let me ask for you.

143
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:04,959
No need to ask.

144
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:06,759
No means no.

145
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:08,079
Greetings, Mountain Owner Tang.

146
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:09,800
I've heard about you for a long time.

147
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:11,560
I've always wanted to worship you.

148
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:13,879
I wonder if I can have this chance today?

149
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,720
This is an article that students usually write.

150
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,519
You don't need to read it.

151
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:19,279
Gu Yuan Academy

152
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:21,560
has always been the best among the best.

153
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,959
Being from a family background

154
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,439
is also part of your strength.

155
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,199
A commoner is a commoner.

156
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,240
Even if you become an official in the court in the future,

157
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,439
your official career will surely be difficult.

158
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,079
I advise you to give up.

159
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:32,959
Why?

160
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:37,959
but

161
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,120
No buts. Next,

162
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,519
please.

163
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,439
Why are you still here?

164
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You remember me.

165
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,560
Of course I remember you.

166
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,040
Can I have a word with you?

167
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:01,519
Tell me. What is it?

168
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,720
I don't know if my name is taboo.

169
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,079
I am Wu Wan Cheng Anshi.

170
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:06,160
I would like to thank you, Brother Wu.

171
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:08,079
You don't have to do this.

172
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:10,279
Besides, I didn't help you much.

173
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,839
An Shi saw that Brother Wu wanted to fight for it for me.

174
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,759
I can't thank An Shi enough for that.

175
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:16,000
You don't need to thank me.

176
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,399
That's because you're really talented.

177
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,000
I also want to express my gratitude.

178
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:20,600
What are your plans in the future?

179
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,519
Although I can't enter Gu Yuan Academy,

180
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:24,800
I won't give up my dream.

181
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:26,079
Not bad.

182
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:26,879
Young man,

183
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:28,000
I have faith in you.

184
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,040
You can't get tired of

185
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:34,920
this steamed bread. Have a try.

186
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:36,759
Eat yours.

187
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:38,000
-I'm starving. -Why are you eating

188
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,759
gunpowder? You've

189
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:41,879
been working in the Academy all morning.

190
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:43,160
It's not easy to get half a day's rest,

191
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,920
but I still can't eat well and suffer no loss.

192
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:45,680
Wen Qi,

193
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:46,639
stop talking.

194
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:48,199
Brother Wu,

195
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:50,519
are you still upset about An Shi?

196
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,040
Because of family background,

197
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,079
social class,

198
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,079
You shut out a student.

199
00:07:58,279 --> 00:07:59,800
It's against the way of Confucius and Mencius.

200
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,399
Besides,

201
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,519
An Shi's talent is not inferior to ours at all.

202
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:05,959
What a pity.

203
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,800
It's a pity.

204
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,319
You know what a pity it is,

205
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:10,839
so you should cherish the opportunity and study hard.

206
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:12,439
Why are you pulling me?

207
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,560
Just like my father.

208
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,439
What's wrong?

209
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,159
Don't you think that woman just now

210
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,039
is somewhat similar to An Shi?

211
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,639
Maybe they are brother and sister.

212
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:38,879
What's there to make a fuss about?

213
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,799
Why do I feel like she knows me?

214
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,559
Could it be

215
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:45,559
a woman disguised as a man,

216
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:48,480
You two are too bold to guess.

217
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,759
You can just say that he is also a woman disguised as a man.

218
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:56,399
You can't really

219
00:08:56,759 --> 00:08:58,200
eat your own food.

220
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,679
Brother Qi, let's go.

221
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:01,960
-Eat more. -Brother Wu, wait

222
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:03,519
for me. Where

223
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:04,440
are you going? Wait for me.

224
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:09,200
Mr. Wang, you're here.

225
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:12,919
Come in, please.

226
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,120
Mr. Zhang invited

227
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:18,159
my aunt,

228
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:20,080
It's dark now.

229
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,399
You're finally back.
