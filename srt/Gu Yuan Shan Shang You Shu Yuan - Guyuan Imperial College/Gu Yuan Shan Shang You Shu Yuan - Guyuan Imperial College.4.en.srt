1
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,320
Senior, can't you see that we're being punished?

2
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:23,440
So?

3
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:25,160
Did it affect you? Say hello to me?

4
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,039
Sure. Hello,

5
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,440
senior.

6
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,160
Good boy.

7
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:31,760
Look how smart he is,

8
00:00:31,879 --> 00:00:33,039
even though he is the son of a mountain leader,

9
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,560
But you also know how to be soft,

10
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,600
unlike some people,

11
00:00:36,759 --> 00:00:38,640
He comes from the house of a third-rate military general,

12
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:40,039
yet he's still so arrogant,

13
00:00:40,119 --> 00:00:41,359
I'll give you a long memory.

14
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:49,560
My hand,

15
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:52,079
Senior,

16
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:52,960
I'm done taking a shower.

17
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,000
Is it time to go back and get changed?

18
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:57,679
How dare you laugh at me?

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,520
Come on,

20
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,560
Add this water to the basin.

21
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,359
Fill it up.

22
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:44,760
Why don't you take a shower in the big bathhouse?

23
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:45,799
You're back.

24
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,400
Chen Lan made a big bath tub,

25
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,079
enough for the four of us to wash together.

26
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:50,120
Let's go together.

27
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,879
Let's wash it together.

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,759
You're not shy, are you?

29
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,880
We're buddies. There's nothing to be shy about.

30
00:01:57,959 --> 00:01:58,560
Come on.

31
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,840
I … I'm not shy, we haven't showered

32
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,680
together.

33
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:04,759
-Come on. -No need.

34
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:05,840
Come on.

35
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,959
What are you doing?

36
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,320
I saw you standing still.

37
00:02:08,359 --> 00:02:09,160
Let me help you take off your clothes.

38
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,320
No, no, no.

39
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:10,759
Here, here,

40
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:11,359
here, come on!

41
00:02:11,359 --> 00:02:12,239
I really don't need it.

42
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:20,120
So you were the one

43
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,239
who blew up the toilet yesterday,

44
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,359
It's me.

45
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,000
But let me explain,

46
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,919
I had no choice but to go home.

47
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,199
Your home is in the northwest?

48
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:35,000
What does it have to do with blowing me up?

49
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,799
I can't tell him.

50
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:39,280
I want to blow myself back to modern times.

51
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:40,400
If you don't tell me,

52
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:41,600
I'll take it as you did it on purpose.

53
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:44,239
I really didn't know there would be anyone in the toilet.

54
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,799
Then why didn't you tell me?

55
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,079
How long do you want to hide it from me?

56
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:49,039
I was about to say it,

57
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:50,919
but I was interrupted.

58
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:51,759
And then

59
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:53,160
I, Tang Wenqi, hated it the most in my life

60
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:55,560
when my friend kept it from me,

61
00:02:57,039 --> 00:02:58,560
I'm sorry.

62
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,959
I can't believe he treats me as his friend.

63
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:10,160
Didn't we agree to take a shower together?

64
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:13,720
Rub it yourself.

65
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:25,160
Guyuan Academy

66
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:27,079
is the place to cultivate the backbone of the country.

67
00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:28,799
Besides being good at reading,

68
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:30,120
you have to be strong,

69
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,079
Your physical strength is outstanding.

70
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,959
Let's see how strong you are in the Cuju competition today.

71
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:34,560
Okay?

72
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,560
Okay,

73
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:37,919
Now let's start the group competition.

74
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:38,680
Pair in pairs. Team up

75
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,400
on your own.

76
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,759
Why are you alone?

77
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:48,919
I'm sorry I'm late, Master Hong.

78
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:49,600
It's okay.

79
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,039
Wen Qi, your team is here.

80
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,919
I object.

81
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:54,519
Don't object.

82
00:03:59,199 --> 00:03:59,959
All right,

83
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:02,480
let's start the kick training.

84
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:03,839
Be careful

85
00:04:03,839 --> 00:04:05,000
not to hurt your classmates.

86
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,719
Be careful.

87
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:06,279
Got it?

88
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:06,959
Understood.

89
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,240
You two, move. Move.

90
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:14,480
Give it to me.

91
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:16,279
That's right.

92
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,199
I haven't calmed down yet,

93
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,839
but no one in Guyuan Academy can beat me,

94
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,440
I'll kick you down today.

95
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,120
What an ugly smile.

96
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,360
Do you want to kick it or not?

97
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:27,759
Hurry up.

98
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,279
Surrender or not?

99
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:51,800
Again.

100
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:56,639
I'm sure you won't think of it.

101
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:00,120
I'm the first goalkeeper in the junior palace women's football team

102
00:05:03,719 --> 00:05:05,839
and my level is not as good as that of the men's football team,

103
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:08,399
Tang Wenqi,

104
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,639
did you lose? Call me daddy

105
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,920
and I'll give you a round.

106
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,000
Dream on!

107
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,199
Are you okay?

108
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:37,120
We're classmates. What are you doing?

109
00:05:37,599 --> 00:05:38,719
This is training.

110
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,360
Injuries are inevitable.

111
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,279
It's your turn to play with me.

112
00:05:42,599 --> 00:05:43,880
Just you

113
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,079
Come on, Brother Wancheng,

114
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:57,800
Sit down,

115
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:58,759
Sit down,

116
00:05:58,839 --> 00:05:59,440
be careful!

117
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:01,560
Brother Wan Cheng, you're really something.

118
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:05,040
Will you be gentle?

119
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:05,959
I'm sorry.

120
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:07,920
So what?

121
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,440
Surrender or not?

122
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:11,560
Yes, yes.

123
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,240
Dance.

124
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,399
Turn around and have a look,

125
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,159
Okay.

126
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:21,759
So handsome.

127
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,320
E Fei,

128
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,959
don't just bully the weak.

129
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,440
Kick with me if you dare.

130
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:47,680
Wait for me to avenge you.

131
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,759
E Fei, you are a sinister man. The soldiers

132
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:55,040
are not tired of fraud.

133
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,079
What's wrong?

134
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,040
I can't afford to lose.

135
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,519
Wait and see!

136
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,519
Wu Wancheng Brother Wu Wenqi

137
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,719
Don't be impulsive,

138
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,440
It's important to treat Brother Wu.

139
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,880
This pulse condition,

140
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,880
she's a woman,

141
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:15,480
Master,

142
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:16,519
is he okay?

143
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:19,079
It's nothing serious.

144
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,040
There are some bruises on your palms and legs.

145
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,839
Just bandage it after applying the medicine.

146
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:26,639
You fainted just now because you didn't have breakfast, right?

147
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,680
Lack of Qi and blood.

148
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,159
Go back and have some rest.

149
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,040
Just have some sweet food.

150
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:35,320
Thank you, Master Feng.

151
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,120
Remember to have breakfast every day.

152
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:42,920
By the way,

153
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:43,959
how is Brother Qi?

154
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:45,000
Is he okay?

155
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,759
Since you're fine, I'll leave now.

156
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:51,599
Is he crazy?

157
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,159
Brother Qi, let me

158
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,599
help you.

159
00:07:58,759 --> 00:07:59,639
How is your injury?

160
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,800
I'm fine.

161
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:01,560
But you,

162
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:03,399
why didn't you ask Doctor Feng to show you?

163
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:04,680
It's just a scratch.

164
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:05,480
It doesn't matter.

165
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:06,599
Well,

166
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:08,079
Tang Wenqi even sent me medicine.

167
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:12,199
I didn't expect this daredevil would care about people.

168
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,440
What the heck?

169
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:14,880
I'm here to paint it

170
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,320
for you. Brother Qi,

171
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,320
thank you for taking me to Master Feng.

172
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,640
What are you doing? It's a lady's gift.

173
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,239
It's over.

174
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,440
This darn muscle remembers me,

175
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,079
Me,

176
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:31,760
Me,

177
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,440
I'm just trying to liven things up.

178
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:41,239
Actually,

179
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,680
if you were a woman,

180
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:44,160
It's good, too.

181
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,520
Don't talk nonsense.

182
00:08:48,199 --> 00:08:49,680
I was just kidding.

183
00:08:49,719 --> 00:08:50,640
Why are you nervous?

184
00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:51,599
By the way,

185
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,079
have you seen Wen Qi?

186
00:08:53,359 --> 00:08:55,199
He disappeared after he delivered the medicine to me.

187
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,879
I haven't seen anyone yet.

188
00:08:57,879 --> 00:08:58,879
Who knows.

189
00:08:59,119 --> 00:09:00,640
He even threw a tantrum at me just now,

190
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,119
but I don't know who pissed him off.

191
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,400
Did you quarrel again?

192
00:09:03,719 --> 00:09:05,119
Why are you quarreling again?

193
00:09:05,359 --> 00:09:06,320
I just woke up.

194
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,800
He just said one word,

195
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,160
and then he got angry.

196
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,920
What did you say to him?

197
00:09:11,079 --> 00:09:13,040
So I asked him, how is your injury?

198
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,239
Is there a problem?

199
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,079
Wen Qi is such a sensitive guy.

200
00:09:17,719 --> 00:09:18,800
That's his temper.

201
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:19,680
Don't take it to heart.

202
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:21,680
I don't care about him.

203
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,959
I'll apply the medicine to you.

204
00:09:27,719 --> 00:09:28,359
Does it hurt?

205
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:29,079
It doesn't hurt.
