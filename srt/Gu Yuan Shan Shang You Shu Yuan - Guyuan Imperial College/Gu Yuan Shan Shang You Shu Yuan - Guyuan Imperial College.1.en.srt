1
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:24,679
Boss,

2
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:25,920
boss, run slowly.

3
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:26,960
Why are you so slow?

4
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,760
I've been waiting for this day for a long time.

5
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,119
Today, I'll show you

6
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,960
the power of the "Heaven-piercing Cannon",

7
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:35,799
Do it yourself or should I do it?

8
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:37,119
Boss,

9
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,079
you're not really going to tie this to me, are you?

10
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,439
Or what?

11
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:42,719
You didn't say you would help me realize

12
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:44,399
my dream of soaring,

13
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,079
Me,

14
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:47,280
I'm a little scared.

15
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:49,200
Forget it,

16
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,240
coward.

17
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,240
If not, I'll do it myself.

18
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:51,759
No.

19
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:53,159
Boss,

20
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,359
let's just forget about it.

21
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,119
If anything happens to you,

22
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,479
how can I explain it to Mr. Shan?

23
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,640
Cut the crap!

24
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,520
Get ready to light the fire.

25
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,680
My Lady,

26
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,799
I heard that the General will pick you up this time,

27
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:09,400
But I want you to get married.

28
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:10,680
What?

29
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:12,159
As soon as my mother passed away,

30
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,480
my father asked me to get married.

31
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:37,079
Why did it suddenly stop?

32
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:37,640
There's movement.

33
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,120
Let's get out of the car and have a look.

34
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:49,319
What kind of person?

35
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:50,000
Get out of the way!

36
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,439
Get out of the way.

37
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:52,680
Hurry up and sign up!

38
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,719
Get out of the way!

39
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,519
Hurry up

40
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:06,359
Oh no.

41
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,719
If I fail this course again,

42
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:09,000
I'll be expelled.

43
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,560
Where is this place?

44
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:49,159
Me,

45
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,639
I'm doing an experiment, right?

46
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:52,840
Why am I still wearing ancient costume?

47
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,960
I'm going back to ancient times,

48
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:58,919
You can't fail.

49
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,879
I have to find a way to go back.

50
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,000
Miss, you're awake.

51
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:12,280
Good-looking.

52
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,039
It's kind of heroic.

53
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,680
Miss,

54
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:24,520
did you save me just now?

55
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:25,560
I,

56
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,759
All right,

57
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,199
Needless to say,

58
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:31,919
just promise me your love.

59
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,159
You don't have to.

60
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,240
I have no plans to get married.

61
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,479
I understand.

62
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:38,759
Men

63
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,280
are duplicitous.

64
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:45,840
Since you're fine,

65
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,439
I'll take my leave.

66
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:48,919
You,

67
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,039
My feet are breezy

68
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,719
Go get the horse ready,

69
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:55,759
Young master,

70
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:56,840
it's time to go back.

71
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,960
The school will be closed if it's late.

72
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,919
If you can't go back, you'll be punished.

73
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,000
But,

74
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,400
let's find a nearby clinic,

75
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,599
Leave her to the doctor to take care of her.

76
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,719
Then we'll set off right away. We might be able to catch the door access control.

77
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:09,599
It seems like this is the only way.

78
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,120
Me

79
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:11,719
Come on.

80
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:24,199
How much did it cost to see a doctor in ancient times?

81
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:25,759
What if I can't afford it

82
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,639
and become a slave?

83
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:28,720
Childe Qi said,

84
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:30,839
"This is the jade

85
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,519
that fell from you. ",

86
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,759
It might be worth a few more.

87
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:36,680
Oh,

88
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,120
Wu Wancheng,

89
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:39,399
it turns out,

90
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:41,680
This is the badge of the original owner's brother.

91
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:44,240
Sir,

92
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,240
where is this place?

93
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,959
The town around Chang'an

94
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:48,480
is called Gu Yuan.

95
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:50,120
Chang'an,

96
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,240
I can speak Shaanxi dialect.

97
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,079
Listen to me.

98
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,480
Oh my god. Oh my god.

99
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:01,600
Here's your medicine,

100
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,199
30 taels,

101
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:04,519
Why is it so expensive?

102
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:06,240
Childe Qi Shan ordered you

103
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,439
to use the best one.

104
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,360
He's a good spender.

105
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,360
He paid for it and ran away.

106
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:13,120
Forget it.

107
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,800
Handsome guys deserve to be forgiven.

108
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:22,639
This is gunpowder.

109
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,680
That's right.

110
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:26,279
Since I was blown here,

111
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:28,439
I'm sure I can be blown back.

112
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:30,839
Thank you, Miss.

113
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:31,920
Sir,

114
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:33,040
let me ask you something,

115
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,839
Do you know where I can get gunpowder?

116
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,839
The gunpowder is under the control of the court,

117
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,000
you can't buy it

118
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:40,519
and you don't have the materials

119
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:42,199
Sir

120
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:46,519
Can you make a merciful exception?

121
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:50,920
Miss, you can go to Gu Yuan Academy.

122
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,839
There's someone there who can give you what you want.

123
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:56,120
Why is there gunpowder in the Academy?

124
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,519
This guy is really dark,

125
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,639
Okay,

126
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,720
I'll give it to you

127
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,000
Mr. Qi, who sent you here today,

128
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,439
is the son of the Assistant Minister of Works.

129
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,959
The Ministry of Works doesn't have gunpowder,

130
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,040
but there are all kinds of materials

131
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,720
to make gunpowder.

132
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,399
It seems that

133
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,800
if you want gunpowder, you have to deal with Qi Shan.

134
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,399
Chen Lan,

135
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:30,279
you have to catch me.

136
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:31,199
Don't worry.

137
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:33,240
Good brothers are in trouble together,

138
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,439
It's weird.

139
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,959
If it hadn't been for saving you,

140
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,959
I wouldn't have been late.

141
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:44,680
Boss,

142
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:45,759
jump quickly.

143
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:46,680
I'll go.

144
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:48,519
Why didn't I think of climbing over the wall?

145
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,639
Who is arresting me?

146
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:55,480
Brother,

147
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,639
can you make a merciful exception?

148
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,519
Get me in there too.

149
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,680
I don't have time to talk to you.

150
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:01,959
Let go. No one

151
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,560
dares to

152
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,879
break into Guyuan Academy at night.

153
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:10,639
Why are you so unlucky?

154
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,439
I was caught by the mountain chief.

155
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,600
How to punish your school for climbing over the wall?

156
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,519
Beat him,

157
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,959
Beat him to death.

158
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:23,360
Don't all the students of Gu Yuan Academy come from noble families?

159
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:24,800
There's no such thing as going through the back door

160
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,959
or accommodating people.

161
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,639
I'm here for something important.

162
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,680
No, you haven't entered school yet.

163
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,639
Just let me get out of here.

164
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,319
The biggest one is my father.

165
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,759
I'm sure he won't be soft.

166
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:35,079
You mean,

167
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:37,120
your father is the head of the mountain,

168
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,600
That's easy.

169
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:48,519
This unfilial son,

170
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,759
let them in.

171
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:52,240
Come in.

172
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,720
Do as I say.

173
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,720
How about this

174
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:04,199
Is it really good?

175
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,120
How do you know if you don't try?

176
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,879
Hurry up!

177
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:14,199
Daddy,

178
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,199
I know I was wrong,

179
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,199
Don't punish him, okay?

180
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,040
What are you doing?

181
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,680
How can I raise an unfilial son like you?

182
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,720
What a misfortune for our family.

183
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,720
Master Feng,

184
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:27,959
get him out of here.

185
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:28,959
Rattan whip 20,

186
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,879
not even a little less.

187
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:30,759
No, no, no.

188
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:33,200
Twenty lashes is too heavy, isn't it?

189
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,480
Look at him.

190
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,200
Look at him,

191
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,360
if he's not severely punished,

192
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:39,559
he'll have to come!

193
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:40,440
Get him out of here!

194
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,519
How dare you frame me!

195
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:46,399
I won't let you go.

196
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:48,200
Wait and see

197
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:55,679
Sir,

198
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:58,480
may I have your last name?

199
00:08:58,679 --> 00:08:59,840
I'm

200
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,600
Wu Wancheng,

201
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:03,159
Wu Wancheng,

202
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,120
why did Childe Wu come to Guyuan Academy?

203
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:10,000
To study, of course.

204
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,559
Since you want to study,

205
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:14,399
why don't you go through the front door and climb over the wall?

206
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:16,519
I'm going to talk about you guys.

207
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,360
I knocked on the door for half a day,

208
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,600
but no one answered the door for me.

209
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,399
In such a big academy,

210
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,639
don't you even have a security guard?

211
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:23,720
Security guard?

212
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:24,759
What is security guard?

213
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:29,679
It's okay. It's not important.

214
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,600
I want to ask,

215
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:31,919
can I go to school here?

216
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,000
Guyuan Academy

217
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,080
has always been strict with students,

218
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,360
The person you choose must have a family background.

219
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:41,080
I'm General Dingxi,

220
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,039
General Wu's son, Wu Wancheng,

221
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,799
With the badge as evidence,

222
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:46,519
I'm sorry that the original owner

223
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:48,559
can only impersonate your dead brother.

224
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:49,960
You're Wu's son?
