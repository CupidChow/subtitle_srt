1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:06,799
1。

2
00:00:19,399 --> 00:00:21,199
I'm glad to meet all of you here.

3
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,519
The happiest thing is,

4
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:24,359
I met Ling Xiu here,

5
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,440
Lingxiu,

6
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:30,960
are you willing to wait until I finish my studies,

7
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:32,079
Come back to the northwest with me.

8
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:36,640
She said,

9
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:37,640
"It's so touching.

10
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:41,679
Sister Ling Xiu,

11
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:42,479
congratulations,

12
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,119
All right, all right.

13
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:44,320
Come and drink!

14
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:48,759
Cheers!

15
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:54,200
But

16
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,200
I have one more question,

17
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,079
When did you know

18
00:00:57,079 --> 00:00:58,079
that...... is a woman?

19
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:00,920
It's a long story.

20
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:02,240
Not long, not long.

21
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,519
Actually,

22
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:06,000
she changed her clothes,

23
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:07,280
I saw it.

24
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:11,760
Didn't Brother Qi see it too?

25
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:13,079
I think so.

26
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:13,959
He said he saw it too.

27
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,480
Brother Qi saw it too.

28
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,359
When did he see it?

29
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,719
He said it himself.

30
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:20,120
When did he say it?

31
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:20,920
He.

32
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,840
It's all in the past.

33
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:24,760
What is the past?

34
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:25,359
No,

35
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,560
if he really sees it,

36
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,359
I had to gouge out his eyeballs.

37
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:29,959
As you can see,

38
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:31,239
why don't you gouge out your own eyes?

39
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:32,120
Why am I the same?

40
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,480
Why are you different?

41
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,719
Why am I the same?

42
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:35,719
I'm sure it's different.

43
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,920
Why are you different? You are the same.

44
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:37,719
I'm different.

45
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:38,480
Why are you so different?

46
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,359
It's different.

47
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:39,840
the same

48
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,599
It's different.

49
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,000
the same

50
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:41,640
It's different.

51
00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:42,159
the same

52
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:42,680
It's different.

53
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,159
All right,

54
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:43,719
it's the same.

55
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,439
Why are you two acting like kids?

56
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:46,359
That's right.

57
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,680
Stop talking nonsense.

58
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,200
Come on,

59
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,079
Drink,

60
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:50,200
Come on,

61
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,959
It's just different.

62
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,599
Childish.

63
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:57,040
Wen Qi,

64
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,680
let's play what I taught you

65
00:01:58,719 --> 00:01:59,400
last time. -How to draw

66
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,359
at the border? -No one is afraid of you.

67
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,400
People who float in the world of martial arts will get stabbed.

68
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,239
I'll kill you with one stab.

69
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:09,680
Come on, Chestnut.

70
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,800
You can't drink too much.

71
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,599
Again

72
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:16,719
One knife,

73
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,680
two knives,

74
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,319
one knife. That's all you can drink,

75
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,639
You even drank with others.

76
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:29,319
I think it's getting late.

77
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:31,080
Maybe I should take Lingxiu back first.

78
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,599
Be careful on your way back.

79
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,960
I know.

80
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,439
You care more about Wen Qi

81
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,479
than I do,

82
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,560
Did I?

83
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,919
I don't know if you've noticed,

84
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:58,159
but you always call me Brother Qi.

85
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,520
Instead, I'll call him Tang Wenqi.

86
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,639
Maybe,

87
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,520
I really like him.

88
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:18,280
What's wrong?

89
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,439
You don't recognize me?

90
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,719
I know you.

91
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:25,199
You don't recognize me?

92
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:28,479
I'm Wen Qi,

93
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,039
and you're.

94
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:35,159
You are my Miss Qingyi.

95
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:37,520
Who is your Tsing Yi girl?

96
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:38,560
Are you drunk?

97
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:55,520
You fell off a cliff that day

98
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,479
without conscience,

99
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,000
But I saved you.

100
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:12,680
Do you still remember me?

101
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,199
I'm going to get changed.

102
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,600
It's not like I'm going to change my mind.

103
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,920
So it was you who saved me.

104
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,839
Of course,

105
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,519
I finally found you.

106
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:48,879
I stole the application back.

107
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:51,240
That's good.

108
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:52,680
Wen Qi

109
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:54,839
What's wrong with Wen Qi?

110
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,519
He's drunk.

111
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:57,639
I don't have the strength to carry him anymore.

112
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,399
It's good that you're here. Take him back.

113
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,240
I'm so sleepy.

114
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,319
I'll go back to sleep first.

115
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:09,040
Wen Qi,

116
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,199
Wen Qi,

117
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:11,639
Wen Qi.

118
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:34,040
Tang Wenqi,

119
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,680
do I like him?

120
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:43,279
But what's the use of liking it?

121
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:47,120
I'm about to leave here.

122
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:50,480
Anyone here?

123
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:51,959
Open the door!

124
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,519
Who is it?

125
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,959
Anyone here?

126
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,680
Lingxiu,

127
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,639
why are you here?

128
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,079
Where's Sister Wu?

129
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:10,160
I need to talk to her.

130
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,120
She should still be resting.

131
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:13,560
What's wrong with you?

132
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,680
Why are you still sleeping?

133
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,560
Isn't this Muxiu just for rest?

134
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:31,360
I'm not dressed yet.

135
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:33,000
Wu Wancheng, can you control her?

136
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:35,279
Sister Wu,

137
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:37,680
Lingxiu,

138
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,480
Stop messing with me.

139
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,480
I stayed up late last night.

140
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:43,120
Let me sleep for a while.

141
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:44,800
Are you really not going?

142
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,839
This is the annual Lantern Festival.

143
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:48,199
Lantern Festival.

144
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,560
If you miss it once, you'll wait for a year.

145
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:56,439
It is said that there are also beautiful men performing.

146
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:58,759
Wait for me.

147
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,439
-I'll be quick. -Let's go. Wen

148
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,199
Qi, where

149
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:19,160
are you going?

150
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,920
I'm looking for chestnuts for something important.

151
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:30,839
Chestnut, slow down.

152
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:32,680
Slow down.

153
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:34,240
Aren't you afraid that your wife will run away with someone else?

154
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,199
I won't

155
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:36,240
My daughter-in-law?

156
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,319
Whose daughter-in-law?

157
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,600
I don't have

158
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,279
a daughter-in-law. Enough,

159
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:43,600
If you slow down, you won't be able to catch up with them.

160
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:45,480
Listen to me,

161
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:48,040
it's just a so-called beautiful male performance.

162
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,199
Look around,

163
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:51,639
in Guyuan City,

164
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:53,839
There are more handsome men than the two of us.

165
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:55,120
Okay,

166
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:57,279
When the time comes... If you fall in love with someone else,

167
00:07:57,399 --> 00:07:58,959
don't cry with me.

168
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,879
That makes sense.

169
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:04,040
Now that you know you're in a hurry,

170
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,319
why are you standing there?

171
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,480
Hurry up,

172
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:15,040
hurry up. It's all my bad memory.

173
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,000
I forgot that the performance of the handsome boy

174
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:17,759
is tomorrow. It's okay.

175
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:18,920
It will be the same if we look at it another day.

176
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,519
That's right.

177
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,959
If we hadn't come today,

178
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:22,480
we wouldn't have bought such a nice mask.

179
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:24,839
Sister Wu,

180
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,279
I'm going to get something for father.

181
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,720
Just wait for me at the mask stand.

182
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,279
Okay.

183
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,879
Where is the performance of the handsome man you mentioned?

184
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,600
I don't think you're looking for a handsome man,

185
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:40,440
but...... right?

186
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,279
It's all the same.

187
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:49,639
Wen Qi,

188
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,200
I'm suddenly in a bit of a hurry.

189
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:53,720
Wait for me at the noodle stand ahead.

190
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,799
I'll be right back.

191
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,960
You're the only one who has a lot of things to do,
