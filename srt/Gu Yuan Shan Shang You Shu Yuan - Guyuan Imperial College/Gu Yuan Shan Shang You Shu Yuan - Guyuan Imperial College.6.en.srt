1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,200
1。

2
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,679
Why are you calling me Young Master?

3
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,559
Tang Wenqi,

4
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,039
I think you're tired of living.

5
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:28,679
Young Master,

6
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,839
I'm going to

7
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:31,879
avenge E Fei today.

8
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,159
Do you dare to play another game with me?

9
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,240
Today's training,

10
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:38,280
I don't have time to play with you.

11
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:40,359
I want to report it to the mountain chief.

12
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,960
Let's see how he will deal with you.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,079
Are you scared?

14
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:48,759
Okay,

15
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:49,840
Are you trying to provoke me?

16
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,119
It's just

17
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:23,480
a good match. It's amazing.

18
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:25,200
Nice ball.

19
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,159
Again.

20
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:46,200
Cool,

21
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,079
How dare you hurt me?

22
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,200
What's wrong with hurting you?

23
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,239
If you don't respect him,

24
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:52,719
I'll rebel.

25
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:53,799
So what?

26
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,519
You.

27
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:55,480
What are you doing?

28
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,480
I'm leaving.

29
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:06,159
Fine. I told you

30
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:07,519
to train here,

31
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:09,039
If you fish in troubled waters here,

32
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,879
you'll be punished for running 50 laps around the school playground,

33
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:13,800
Well

34
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:19,840
What do you think?

35
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,560
Am I good?

36
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:21,240
Can't you get rid of

37
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:23,280
your anger? You're so good.

38
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,960
Don't you see that everyone has to run away?

39
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,840
I'm trying to attract fire for you, okay?

40
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,159
Why don't you know how to be grateful?

41
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,039
Thank you so much.

42
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:33,680
I can't do it anymore.

43
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,240
Boss,

44
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:36,680
why don't you run away?

45
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:37,919
I won't run anymore.

46
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:38,759
Run for me.

47
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,599
Really?

48
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:44,319
Brother Qi,

49
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:47,159
what's wrong with Tang Wenqi?

50
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:48,960
What are you smoking

51
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,159
in the morning? Go, go, go.

52
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:55,759
Brother Wu,

53
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:59,280
did you go to the hot spring secretly?

54
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:02,919
It seems that they were right.

55
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,439
they

56
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,199
Now the whole Academy

57
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:09,919
knows about you and Feng Lingxiu.

58
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:11,000
Me

59
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,520
I … I have nothing to do with Feng Lingxiu. I know

60
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,960
that.

61
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,479
It seems Wen Qi knew that E Fei would target Wu Wancheng,

62
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,120
so he made this decision.

63
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,319
Attract the fire,

64
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:23,199
as long as you know it.

65
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:24,719
Ling Xiu also told me

66
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,199
to be careful with E Fei today,

67
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,479
But now it seems that

68
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,879
he didn't do anything about it.

69
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,560
Don't take it lightly.

70
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,800
I'm afraid it's not that simple.

71
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:37,879
It seems that this academy is not easy to be treated.

72
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:39,159
Let's go back to modern times.

73
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,439
How could it fail?

74
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,520
I did it according to the textbook.

75
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,159
I've failed twice.

76
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,719
We're running out of materials.

77
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:03,800
No way.

78
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,400
I'm going to try again.

79
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,920
Success or failure depends on it.

80
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,920
Let's go home.

81
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:34,600
-Go home. -Go home.

82
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,600
That's me.

83
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,879
I only have one explosive left.

84
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,040
You always

85
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:58,000
make people worry about you.

86
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,240
You,

87
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,519
Your butt is on fire.

88
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,879
Water. Give me water.

89
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:19,519
I always thought that if I couldn't blow myself up in ancient times,

90
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,560
I wouldn't blow myself up, right?

91
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:27,480
Can't I go back?

92
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,240
Brother Wu,

93
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,759
are you not feeling well?

94
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:41,680
Brother Wu,

95
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:43,519
can you hear me?

96
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,680
Brother Wu,

97
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,560
I'm fine.

98
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,240
I just didn't accept the reality.

99
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,120
Accept the reality.

100
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:58,959
Brother Qi,

101
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,360
do you believe that people can change time?

102
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,839
Anything is possible.

103
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:10,120
Why don't you believe me?

104
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,079
If,

105
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:12,759
I mean if,

106
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,480
You can change the time.

107
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:16,480
When you go back to the past,

108
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,519
you find everything around you very interesting.

109
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:20,680
However,

110
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,720
you can never go back to your present life.

111
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:24,560
Will you be happy?

112
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,959
Then I might think,

113
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:30,680
why am I like this?

114
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,319
Everything has a cause and effect.

115
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,839
Since we're here,

116
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,879
there must be a reason for us to be here.

117
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:37,920
What it means to be here?

118
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,199
Yes.

119
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:41,199
Since you can't choose,

120
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,000
you might as well try to find

121
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,920
your own meaning.

122
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,360
And you said

123
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:48,079
everything around you was fun, didn't you?

124
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:48,920
That's right.

125
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:50,360
No, no,

126
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,439
no. I said it wasn't me,

127
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,079
And I said "if",

128
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:55,879
OK, OK.

129
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:56,639
Come and

130
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,959
take a look at

131
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,240
the freshly baked meat buns.

132
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:07,240
Miss, take one.

133
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,360
Okay Sir,

134
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:11,680
do you want an umbrella?

135
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:13,560
Dead face,

136
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,680
let's go and have a look at that.

137
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:15,360
Boss,

138
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:16,120
it just came out.

139
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,319
-This is so nice. -Okay.

140
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:18,399
Get

141
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,000
me one.

142
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,399
Brother Qi, hurry up. Didn't you say

143
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,879
you would take me shopping?

144
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,720
Why is it so slow?

145
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:27,360
Brother Wu,

146
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,680
we've already visited five streets in half an hour.

147
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:32,000
Why don't we sit down and rest before we leave.

148
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:34,079
Young man,

149
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:35,519
you have to be energetic,

150
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,399
Let's head to the next street.

151
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,399
Let's go.

152
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,439
Nice sachet.

153
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,839
Isn't this Mr. Yanxi, Tang Wenqi?

154
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,439
Why are you here again?

155
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,079
Are you stalking me?

156
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:06,639
Why would I follow you?

157
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,639
Brother Qi and I.

158
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,720
I went shopping with Brother Qi,

159
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,480
but he's too slow to catch up.

160
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,279
But you,

161
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,879
what are you doing here without class?

162
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,000
It's none of your business. You can just stay here

163
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,360
if you have nothing to do.

164
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,399
Leave me alone.

165
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,079
Mr. Tang seems to be doing business,

166
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:27,160
but the degree of hoarding of the goods,

167
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,399
This business is not easy to do.

168
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:32,759
Here it is,

169
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:33,600
Brother Wu.

170
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:35,759
I didn't expect you to run so fast with your short legs.

171
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:37,159
Wen Qi,

172
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,480
why are you here?

173
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,840
Where is Mr. Tang?

174
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,159
Doing business here,

175
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,440
Tang Wenqi,

176
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:44,639
I have an idea,

177
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:47,120
I can make all your goods sold out instantly.

178
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,080
Believe it or not?

179
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:49,960
Are you serious?

180
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,919
Of course,

181
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,840
I happen to be free today,

182
00:08:54,919 --> 00:08:55,960
I'll help you then.

183
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,480
I'm afraid you're not bragging.

184
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,240
Why should I brag?

185
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:03,879
But what about this?

186
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:06,519
It needs the three of us to do it together.

187
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,879
No way.

188
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,559
I'm sure it will be exposed.

189
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:17,200
Don't talk nonsense if you want to make money.

190
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:22,399
Let's get started when you're ready.

191
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,120
How about this

192
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,679
Is it really good?

193
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,320
Of course.

194
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,480
Everyone is here.

195
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,000
Let's take a walk and have a look.

196
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:34,600
Handmade smart toys are the best choice

197
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:37,960
for friends and family to send to children,

198
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,279
I only need 50 cents each today.

199
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:44,399
Don't miss it.
