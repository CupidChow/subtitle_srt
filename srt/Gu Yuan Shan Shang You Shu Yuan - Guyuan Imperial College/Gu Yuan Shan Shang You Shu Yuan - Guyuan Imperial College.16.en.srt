1
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:20,839
Chestnuts,

2
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:21,600
eat more,

3
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:23,320
You are so nice to me,

4
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,719
you must have other plans.

5
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:26,120
What can I do for you?

6
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,160
Let's eat.

7
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:30,679
Men and women,

8
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:32,240
shameless.

9
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:33,960
Wen Qi,

10
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:35,240
watch your mouth,

11
00:00:35,799 --> 00:00:36,439
What do you think

12
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,359
they look like?

13
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:39,799
Eat more.

14
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:50,359
What are you doing?

15
00:00:50,679 --> 00:00:51,280
Nothing.

16
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:52,759
-Eat drumsticks. -I won't eat them. Get

17
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,200
out of here.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:55,799
I won't get up.

19
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:58,399
Tang Wenqi, what's wrong with you?

20
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:03,840
Chestnut, let's go.

21
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:04,719
Let's visit the Academy

22
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:05,719
and go with Brother Qi.

23
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,840
Let's go

24
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,159
There's a small forest over there,

25
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,799
I'm telling you, it's great to study here.

26
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,680
Look at the lake,

27
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:19,680
You even raised a lot of goldfish?

28
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:21,519
Look at that.

29
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,840
She showed her fiancé around,

30
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,400
Why do you have to take us with you?

31
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,040
What fiance? I thought

32
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,359
Brother Wu said,

33
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:28,280
It's just a joke.

34
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,920
No one has time to hang out with them.

35
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,840
Brother Wu didn't ask you to come,

36
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,000
so I'm not coming,

37
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,480
No one will watch them if I don't come.

38
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:37,400
Do you want to come or not?

39
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,079
No way.

40
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:39,879
I have to let Chestnut know

41
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:40,959
what I'm capable of today,

42
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:42,719
Wen Qi,

43
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,400
Wen Qi,

44
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:44,400
Li,

45
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:47,280
let me introduce Xuesi Lake to you.

46
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:48,640
Okay,

47
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:48,959
Come on

48
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:53,560
The name of Xuesi Lake

49
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:56,959
comes from the teaching of our first Head of the Mountain.

50
00:01:58,959 --> 00:01:59,719
As the saying goes,

51
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:01,840
learn without

52
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:02,959
thinking. Go on.

53
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,439
Li Zigao, Wen Qi,

54
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:09,400
you've gone too far.

55
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,759
What are you afraid of?

56
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:11,840
He's a lieutenant.

57
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,919
Could it be that you don't know how to drink water?

58
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:13,960
He fell into the water when he was a kid,

59
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,080
and he was afraid of water,

60
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,159
You've gone too far.

61
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,120
Help!

62
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:19,759
But,

63
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:20,840
I don't know how to drink water.

64
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,759
I don't know how to drink water either.

65
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,000
I don't know how to drink water either.

66
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,120
Then.

67
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,520
What should we do?

68
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:40,919
Miss.

69
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,639
Thanks to you, Lingxiu.

70
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,280
Are you okay?

71
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:48,960
I'm fine.

72
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,719
Let's take a look at this student.

73
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:52,240
Li Zigao,

74
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,319
Li Zigao,

75
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:54,719
No way.

76
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:56,319
It seems like this is the only way.

77
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,639
Doctors save people.

78
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:04,919
Understand.

79
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,599
Tang Wenqi has gone too far this time.

80
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:16,080
Wen Qi doesn't know,

81
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,919
if he knows Brother Li is afraid of water,

82
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
He would never do that.

83
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,479
It's even worse if you know.

84
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,159
What about chestnuts

85
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:23,159
if Ling Xiu isn't here today?

86
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,680
I know.

87
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:26,639
How about this?

88
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,439
I'll ask Wen Qi to apologize to you.

89
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:29,800
You're not apologizing to me,

90
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,479
you're apologizing to Chestnut,

91
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,560
That's right.

92
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:34,280
I'll ask Wen Qi to apologize to Li,

93
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:35,199
okay?

94
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:35,759
Miss,

95
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,000
are you willing to marry me?

96
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,800
Are you out of your mind?

97
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,680
I'll give you two. I … I still have something to

98
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:48,919
say.

99
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,039
I'm not confused.

100
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,120
I fell in love with you at first sight.

101
00:03:57,719 --> 00:03:58,639
Miss,

102
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,960
can you give me a chance?

103
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:00,879
Li Zigao,

104
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,319
what a heartless man you are!

105
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,520
How dare you propose to someone else?

106
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,039
Look at me,

107
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,199
Tang Wenqi. What's wrong with you?

108
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:06,639
You're the one who's sick, right?

109
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,719
You're not angry that your fiancé proposed to someone else.

110
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,080
When did I say that he's my fiance?

111
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,319
He said it.

112
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:19,959
Wen Qi,

113
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,160
I told you it was just a joke.

114
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:22,879
Apologize to him.

115
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:23,399
Apologize,

116
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:27,399
I'm sorry, Chestnut. I didn't expect

117
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,000
that you really don't know how to drink.

118
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,160
I should thank you instead.

119
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,519
If it weren't for you,

120
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:37,879
I wouldn't have met such a nice girl.

121
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:41,480
That's great.

122
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,519
It's like a blind cat meeting a dead mouse.

123
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,600
That's right.

124
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:45,680
Don't talk nonsense if you don't know how to speak.

125
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,600
It's getting late.

126
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,399
The supervisor is closing soon.

127
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,279
We should go back.

128
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:50,040
That's right.

129
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,040
We have something else

130
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,040
to do.

131
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,240
Let's go.

132
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:53,920
Let's go.

133
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,800
I don't know your name,

134
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:02,959
Lingxiu.

135
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:04,319
Her surname

136
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,480
is Feng, Feng Lingxiu,

137
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:08,800
That's a good name.

138
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:09,879
Remember,

139
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,959
I don't know what I just asked,

140
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,959
have you thought about it?

141
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,879
May I ask

142
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,879
why you want to marry me?

143
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:20,879
Because I saved you.

144
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:21,920
No

145
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:25,279
It may be hypocritical to say it out loud,

146
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,399
since the first time

147
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,480
I saw the girl in a coma,

148
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:31,079
I knew it was you.

149
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,959
believe

150
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:34,759
Is it too early?

151
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,680
Go back and take the medicine according to the prescription,

152
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:40,319
and come back in seven days.

153
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:45,279
She smiled at me.

154
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,240
She must like me.

155
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,279
I've apologized to you.

156
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,000
Don't be angry, okay?

157
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,399
I don't understand.

158
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,920
Li Zigao didn't offend you.

159
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,120
Why do you have to target him?

160
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,399
Why didn't you offend me?

161
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,240
He said

162
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:15,600
he was your fiancé.

163
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,319
Fiance.

164
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,360
I see.

165
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:26,839
You must be jealous.

166
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,560
No, I didn't.

167
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:30,360
Jealous.

168
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,279
You still said no?

169
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,120
You just like me.

170
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:36,160
Me,

171
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:38,680
It's impossible for me to like you.

172
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,399
Then why are you angry?

173
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:42,839
I think,

174
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,879
even though you're showing off as a man now,

175
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:46,680
However,

176
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:48,920
it's better to keep your distance from other men.

177
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:51,920
Because if you are not careful,

178
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:54,519
there will be rumors of Longyang addiction,

179
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,399
It's not good for you.

180
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,000
I won't.

181
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,920
They all thought Ling Xiu and I were a couple.

182
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,759
Anyway,

183
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,959
Stay away from the man who has to leave. Heaven and earth

184
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,279
are black and yellow,

185
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:11,000
The universe is wild.

186
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,759
What about them?

187
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,399
I went to take a shower.

188
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:14,959
Just in time.

189
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:16,199
I need to talk to you.

190
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:18,920
Well,

191
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,519
I have something to ask you, too,

192
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,720
I know what you want to ask me?

193
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:26,639
You want to ask me why I'm here.

194
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,000
I thought you liked me.

195
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:33,040
I thought my father wanted us to get married.

196
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:35,800
That's why you revealed your fiancé's identity on purpose.

197
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,120
But when I look at it today,

198
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,319
I don't think so.

199
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,879
I just want to make fun of them.

200
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,279
Who do I like now?

201
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:45,120
You should know it, right?

202
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:46,800
This time,

203
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:48,399
I'm not here for your marriage.

204
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,680
Then why?

205
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,120
I was ordered by the general to pick you up,

206
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:58,439
but I received a letter from him on my way here.

207
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:01,800
The general was always worried about you

208
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:03,439
and decided to come in person.

209
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,560
They will arrive in a few days.

210
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,399
What did you say?

211
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,920
My father is coming.

212
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,079
Yes,

213
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,040
I can see that you have a good relationship with your classmates,

214
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,680
But

215
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,560
You don't have much time left.

216
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:23,800
Yes,

217
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:25,560
we don't have much time.

218
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,399
Tangtang Wenqi is studying,

219
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,559
I have arranged a review task for him.

220
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:33,639
Na Li

221
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,080
Li Zigao went to look for Lingxiu.

222
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:36,759
Then you and I are here to see you.

223
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,360
Brother Qi,

224
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,840
you really know me the best.

225
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,200
I haven't finished yet.

226
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,519
You know what I'm going to ask?

227
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:49,759
Actually,

228
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:51,919
I heard it yesterday.

229
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:53,679
I know.

230
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,320
Your father is coming to take you away.

231
00:08:57,639 --> 00:08:58,480
That's right.

232
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,840
I don't want to … Actually, I've never thought that life in the Academy can be so

233
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,679
interesting.

234
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,399
Many parts of your body infected me.

235
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,639
I understand.

236
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,120
Men

237
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,600
are duplicitous.

238
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:22,600
I'm done.

239
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:28,879
I want to.

240
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,159
I think,

241
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,960
I have fallen in love with you.

242
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,720
Brother Qi,

243
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:47,320
I'm not interested in you,
