1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:06,639
1。

2
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:20,640
Luckily, the snake is non-toxic.

3
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,000
After a simple dressing,

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,480
you can move freely tomorrow.

5
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,640
Thank you, Miss Lingxiu.

6
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:28,480
Be careful on your way back.

7
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:32,119
Wen Qi,

8
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,719
how could you be bitten by a snake?

9
00:00:34,359 --> 00:00:35,200
Well

10
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:37,520
It's a long story.

11
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,320
It's not long.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,560
Tang Wenqi's mouth has been open,

13
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,000
When you call that snake,

14
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:45,880
the snake will come out by itself.

15
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:51,200
Look how capable Brother Tang is.

16
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,399
And this unique job.

17
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,000
You let the snake bite you. You

18
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:55,880
can't say that.

19
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,200
By the way, how is Zhou Yang?

20
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:01,200
That's what I wanted to tell you.

21
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,320
Xifeng has found out Zhou Yang's address,

22
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,239
let's go and have a look after school tomorrow.

23
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:05,920
Okay,

24
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,920
It's a deal.

25
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:07,400
Wen Qi,

26
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,480
don't go.

27
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,319
No.

28
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,799
My feet are fine now.

29
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:11,400
Look,

30
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:14,079
it's a group activity,

31
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:15,239
I can't be absent.

32
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,799
It depends on what you can do.

33
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:17,719
Put it down.

34
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,159
Is it that exaggerated?

35
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:20,799
Come on,

36
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:21,760
Smell it.

37
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,319
Get out of the way.

38
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:22,959
Get off.

39
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,640
Smell it.

40
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,120
Get off.

41
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,239
Tang Wenqi, a liar,

42
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,599
agreed to come together

43
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,480
after school today.

44
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:29,519
I didn't even see anyone.

45
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,920
It shouldn't be.

46
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:32,840
Wen Qi is very concerned about this matter.

47
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:34,680
I don't think he'll give up like this.

48
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:36,719
Brother Wu,

49
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:37,680
it should be here.

50
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,200
This house is neither sheltered from the wind nor the rain,

51
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,760
it's really hard for Zhou Yang.

52
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:49,840
It's rare for them to have the heart to study.

53
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,480
Sister Wu,

54
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,359
Master Qi,

55
00:01:57,359 --> 00:01:58,840
Why are you here?

56
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,680
Zhou Yang,

57
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,280
why didn't you come to school yesterday?

58
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,799
We have good news for you.

59
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:04,840
Where have you been these two days?

60
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,280
Me,

61
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,400
I'm going back to the street to beg for food again.

62
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:10,120
And I won't go to school anymore.

63
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:10,919
Why?

64
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:13,280
My parents think it's useless to study,

65
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,280
why don't they work at home?

66
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,800
Or go out to beg for food like before.

67
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,240
This way, we can earn some money for our family.

68
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:21,319
Ridiculous.

69
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:23,319
How can begging be a way to make a living?

70
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:24,439
That's too much.

71
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,680
How can you treat your child like this?

72
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:27,919
Zhou Yang,

73
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:28,520
you go with me,

74
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:30,280
No matter how bad my sister is,

75
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:31,599
I won't let you beg for food.

76
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,439
Let's go.

77
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,199
Brother Wu,

78
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,280
calm down and don't act on impulse.

79
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,439
How can I calm down?

80
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:38,599
Do you want me to watch him beg for food for the rest of his life?

81
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,080
Sister Wu, I'm not leaving.

82
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,159
She has a younger sister at home,

83
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,599
and no one will take care of her after I leave.

84
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:47,919
Sister Wu and Master Qi,

85
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:49,599
you'd better leave now.

86
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:51,120
My father has a bad temper,

87
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,000
and he might get angry when he sees it.

88
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,560
Zhou Yang,

89
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:55,520
come in,

90
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:56,719
Leave now!

91
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:58,080
My father is here.

92
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,120
Who are you?

93
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:00,360
Why did you come to my house?

94
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:02,599
Hello, Uncle Zhou.

95
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:04,240
We're Zhou Yang's teacher,

96
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:06,000
we're all students of Gu Yuan Academy,

97
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,680
My name is Qi Shan

98
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,319
and his name is Wu Wancheng,

99
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:10,080
Gu Yuan Academy,

100
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,800
isn't that the place where a bunch of officials went?

101
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,919
You have nothing to do.

102
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,960
You even taught me dolls.

103
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:16,520
The thing is,

104
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:18,520
a few of us started a private school,

105
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,560
They don't accept money,

106
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,639
because they want the people to learn,

107
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:23,560
With books to read,

108
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,680
we think Yang Zhou is very talented,

109
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,280
So please

110
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,319
let him go to school.

111
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:32,919
So you said the same thing as Wen,

112
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,120
Wen?

113
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,240
I'm here.

114
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,680
You're here.

115
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,000
Why are you here?

116
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,240
Of course I'm working for Uncle Zhou.

117
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:48,879
What else can I do?

118
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:51,000
Uncle Zhou,

119
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,199
I've washed all my clothes.

120
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,240
All I need is to water the backyard.

121
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:56,080
Thank you for your hard work today.

122
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,000
That's a stranger No,

123
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,520
as long as we have a deal,

124
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,680
Just don't forget it.

125
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:01,960
Don't worry,

126
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:03,479
Zhou Yang will definitely go tomorrow.

127
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:04,280
Okay,

128
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:05,439
That's good.

129
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:11,719
Unexpectedly,

130
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,400
he's quite responsible.

131
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:17,000
To be frank and lenient,

132
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,959
to resist strictly,

133
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:18,959
What are you talking about?

134
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,360
Well,

135
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,480
how did you persuade him?

136
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,519
Me,

137
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:25,639
Uncle Zhou

138
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,439
is a tough one to deal with.

139
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,319
I have my own tricks. If you can't do it hard,

140
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,000
give him a soft one.

141
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,160
Cut the crap.

142
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,480
What's wrong? It hurts here.

143
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,199
It hurts.

144
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:41,120
You girl,

145
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,079
Why are you taking off other people's clothes?

146
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:43,680
You're still poor at this time.

147
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,079
Tell us what's going on?

148
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,040
I just did some work for Uncle Zhou.

149
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:49,680
Nothing.

150
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:50,879
You were like this,

151
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:52,079
and you washed the laundry and watered the floor just now.

152
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,439
It's not that

153
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:54,120
I can't do it.

154
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,839
You're bullying me.

155
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,639
I'm going to find him.

156
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:57,360
Come back.

157
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,000
Come back, come back, come back.

158
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:00,199
If you go now,

159
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,800
what if he reneges?

160
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,360
Tang Wenqi,

161
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:06,560
we are brothers,

162
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,120
Do you understand when you're in trouble?

163
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,079
You can act without permission next time.

164
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,160
I'll beat you to death.

165
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:13,720
Aunt, can you be gentle?

166
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:14,800
I'm sorry.

167
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,160
All right, all right,

168
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:17,199
go back.

169
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:18,959
Let's go.

170
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:25,560
What are you waiting for?

171
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,959
Take off your clothes.

172
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,800
If you're in pain, just say,

173
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,199
"Be a man. ",

174
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:41,920
What do you look like yelling all day?

175
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,399
Okay,

176
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:44,399
You said it.

177
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:54,839
You.

178
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:01,879
You …

179
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:03,199
You … What are you doing? You want me … I

180
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:05,759
want to say,

181
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,160
I wanted to scold you. Do you believe me?

182
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,839
You can scold me then.

183
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:12,160
What am I doing if you keep mumbling?

184
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,920
Me? What you?

185
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:16,199
Are you deaf because of your work?

186
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:16,879
No.

187
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,160
It's not me. I really didn't hear you.

188
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:20,800
I'm not clean anymore.

189
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,639
I'm dirty.

190
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:23,319
No,

191
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,639
it won't be clean after a kiss.

192
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:28,560
I don't dislike you.

193
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,600
You still dislike me?

194
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,120
I'll give it back to you.

195
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,839
That's all for today's class.

196
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,160
When you go back,

197
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:09,959
Remember Wen Shu.

198
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,360
Thank you, Sage.

199
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,639
No one is allowed to leave.

200
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,639
Arrest the three of them.

201
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:21,079
Oh no.

202
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:22,800
But they found out.

203
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,000
Who gave you the courage

204
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,319
to set up a private school,

205
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:29,319
We don't charge

206
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:30,920
for students.

207
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,839
Why not just teach them to read?

208
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:33,639
What a joke.

209
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,480
You're all useless students.

210
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,240
How dare you run a school without the permission of the imperial court?

211
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,560
He doesn't care about the rules at all.

212
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,439
And the little girl,

213
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:47,879
Wu Wancheng,

214
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:49,800
Have you taught them that

215
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,079
a woman's lack of talent is virtue?

216
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:52,680
Me,

217
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,600
E Fei,

218
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:55,399
don't go too far.

219
00:07:56,439 --> 00:07:57,040
E Fei,

220
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:58,560
I respect you as a senior.

221
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,399
Can you let the children go back first?

222
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,399
Let's talk about it when we get back to the Academy.

223
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,360
Or does Qi Shan know the rules?

224
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,079
Go back first.

225
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:15,800
All right,

226
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,199
it's time to go back.

227
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:19,160
Mr. Shan is still waiting.

228
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:22,879
Enjoy your last day in the Academy.

229
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,639
You,

230
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,040
Kneel down!

231
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:30,680
Tang Wenqi,

232
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,399
kneel down.

233
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,720
Are you deaf?

234
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,559
I told you to kneel down.

235
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:36,320
I won't kneel.

236
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,840
Those who make mistakes need to kneel down.

237
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:42,320
Do you think you did nothing wrong?

238
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,240
I don't understand.

239
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,960
It's not wrong to teach people knowledge

240
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,720
for free.

241
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,799
It's wrong to teach the people,

242
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:51,279
so what Chief Tang Shan means is,

243
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:54,080
Those from bad backgrounds

244
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,679
deserve to be poor for the rest of their lives.

245
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,159
They deserve to be ignorant for the rest of their lives.

246
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,799
They are not qualified to study, are they?

247
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:04,480
Tang Wenqi,

248
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:05,559
well said,

249
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:06,480
Good enough,

250
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:08,840
Okay,

251
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:11,080
I'll tell you today,

252
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,600
what did you do wrong?

253
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,519
Preferential admission.

254
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:16,480
Women don't learn,

255
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,240
it's a rule set by our ancestors,

256
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,159
You can't break it.

257
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:22,919
Today, the imperial court has its own official school,

258
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:24,559
and private schools are not allowed.

259
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,600
If someone finds out,

260
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,559
he will be severely punished.

261
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,600
Or he'll be flogged.

262
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:32,759
Or exile at the border,
