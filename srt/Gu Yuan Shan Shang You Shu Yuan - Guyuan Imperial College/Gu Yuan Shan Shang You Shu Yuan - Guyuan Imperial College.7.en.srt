1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,080
1。

2
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:21,160
Don't miss it.

3
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:24,039
Boss,

4
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,000
how much do you sell this toy?

5
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:27,519
50 cents a piece.

6
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:29,000
You're a young man.

7
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,160
Bro, do you want one?

8
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:31,079
Look,

9
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:32,600
it's only 40 cents on the next street.

10
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:34,359
How dare you say you're innocent?

11
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:36,240
What did you say?

12
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,520
Forty cents?

13
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,320
No way.

14
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:40,920
We'll definitely give you the lowest price.

15
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:41,960
This one

16
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,000
I just bought it from the next street.

17
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:45,000
It's only 40 cents.

18
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,000
All right. Today,

19
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:47,640
for the sake of reputation,

20
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:49,079
Thirty cents each.

21
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:51,280
No, brother.

22
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:53,479
We'll lose money.

23
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,399
Stop it, brother.

24
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:57,679
I'll sell it at a loss today.

25
00:00:57,759 --> 00:00:58,840
From now on,

26
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,240
all my toys are worth thirty cents each,

27
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,359
Thirty cents.

28
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:07,239
This is ten cents cheaper than the street next door.

29
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,760
Tell me if you're sincere?

30
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,879
We won't have these after we sell them out.

31
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:11,719
But brother,

32
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:16,000
we're really going to lose money.

33
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:22,480
My customers are my family.

34
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,920
Even if I lose money, I have to give benefits to my family.

35
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,879
But brother,

36
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,959
stop it,

37
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,319
It's only 30 cents a piece,

38
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,120
Come on,

39
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:37,280
Put it

40
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:39,359
on sale,

41
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,840
Boss is so kind.

42
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,040
I want three,

43
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,200
Come on.

44
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,159
I want one too.

45
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:45,280
Pack this up.

46
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,760
If it's late, it'll be gone. Slow down.

47
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,840
I want two. This is yours.

48
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,400
Get out of the way!

49
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:49,000
What about mine?

50
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:51,680
You two liars,

51
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:52,959
I just saw it on the next street,

52
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,719
The same toys they sell,

53
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:55,640
they only sell for ten cents.

54
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,079
How is that possible?

55
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,040
Look,

56
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,280
we have good workmanship,

57
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:00,200
It's different from it.

58
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,280
But you just said

59
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:02,480
they sold 40 coins on the street next door?

60
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,840
Where's the guy who was shopping on the next street?

61
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:08,120
It's you.

62
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,159
Gu Yuan Academy,

63
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:10,840
you must all be on the same side.

64
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,840
Today, we'll smash this swindler's booth.

65
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:14,479
Get rid of the evil for the people.

66
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:15,599
No, no, no.

67
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:16,199
Don't smash it.

68
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,120
Refund the money.

69
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:17,400
Smash,

70
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:17,879
Smash it.

71
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,520
Don't step on it. Don't step on it.

72
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,840
He made them all one by one.

73
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,159
Smash it.

74
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:21,560
Stop stepping on it.

75
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,120
Stop stepping on it.

76
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:22,520
Smash,

77
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:23,080
Smash,

78
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:24,000
Liar!

79
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:25,560
Let's go.

80
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,400
I was going to help you,

81
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:40,319
but I said I couldn't do it.

82
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:41,479
Forget it.

83
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:42,719
I'll go back first.

84
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:44,960
Tang Wenqi,

85
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:45,879
Tang Wenqi,

86
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,159
I'm sorry.

87
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:49,879
Forget it,

88
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:50,879
Look,

89
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,159
this can be glued together.

90
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:53,400
I'll stick it on for you when you get back.

91
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:54,639
It's useless to stick it together.

92
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:55,240
I'm leaving.

93
00:02:57,319 --> 00:02:57,879
Brother Wu,

94
00:02:58,759 --> 00:02:59,759
let him go.

95
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,919
Remember what I told you during the day.

96
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,240
Let's do this.

97
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:11,879
Do you hear me?

98
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,479
I saw you guys playing Cuju in the yard that day.

99
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:14,919
Yeah.

100
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:15,919
It's interesting.

101
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:17,039
But there are still few people.

102
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:18,120
Come and play with me next time.

103
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:18,919
No problem.

104
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:20,280
Quiet,

105
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,080
E Fei is coming,

106
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:24,639
In this morning's reading, we're going to have a game theory,

107
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:26,919
a game theory,

108
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,159
What are you doing?

109
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,000
Silence!

110
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,360
Today's topic is about education.

111
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:34,599
Who wants to come up and have a try?

112
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:35,159
Policy theory,

113
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:35,719
education.

114
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:40,199
Wu Wancheng,

115
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,800
I'll embarrass you today.

116
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,759
Wu Wancheng,

117
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:44,960
you do it,

118
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:46,840
Okay,

119
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,120
I'll let you know

120
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,080
what I'm capable of today,

121
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,479
On education,

122
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:55,759
Okay,

123
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:58,280
Then let me talk about today's education,

124
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,840
about our current,

125
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,960
In my eyes, Wu Wancheng,

126
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:04,199
today's education has only three words,

127
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:04,800
No.

128
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,400
Gong,

129
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,080
Ping,

130
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,319
It's not fair.

131
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:08,360
What's unfair?

132
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,520
There are three reasons

133
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:11,639
for unfair education,

134
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:13,159
First,

135
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,120
why are only men allowed to enter the university?

136
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,839
Men and women are equal.

137
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,360
Why can a man study?

138
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:20,600
And a woman who has no talent

139
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,759
means that she is an unrighteous person.

140
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:22,600
Second,

141
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,319
the state establishes institutions of higher learning,

142
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:26,639
But only for the children of His Majesty,

143
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,079
whether smart or dumb,

144
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,959
If you want to study, you can only look at your family,

145
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:31,800
This move

146
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:34,439
It can only make the poor people in the world even colder.

147
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:35,279
Cold in my heart,

148
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,680
this is unfair.

149
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,240
Third,

150
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,079
even if you enter the Academy,

151
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,040
We are both students of the Academy,

152
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,279
why do you have the right to be superior to others?

153
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,560
We don't judge heroes by their academic achievements,

154
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,560
we only look at the rank and rank of the clan,

155
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,920
These are three injustices.

156
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:53,000
These three injustices

157
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:55,040
are simply against the heavens.

158
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,240
Uneven in the world,

159
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,199
well said,

160
00:04:57,399 --> 00:04:57,800
Okay,

161
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,319
Okay,

162
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:00,319
Well said.

163
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:00,920
Well said.

164
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,920
I'm flattered.

165
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:04,160
I didn't expect you to be so insightful.

166
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,279
I heard from you that

167
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,160
you're dissatisfied with the court,

168
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,959
He's waiting for me here.

169
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:14,639
That's not what I meant.

170
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,800
When the weather is good today,

171
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,480
and the people are healthy.

172
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,160
That's all thanks to the imperial court.

173
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:23,160
It also shows that the emperor is governing the country well today,

174
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:25,079
and what I said today,

175
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:25,920
Only about education,

176
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,160
and only about education,

177
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,600
It has nothing to do with governing the country.

178
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:32,920
You may leave.

179
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,279
Brother Wu,

180
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,120
I didn't expect what you said to be so good.

181
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:40,839
I'm

182
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,639
hiding it.

183
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,079
He returned to Wu Wancheng

184
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,279
late again,

185
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:54,040
Qi.

186
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,560
None of your business.

187
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:00,519
You,

188
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,000
He can't take care of it.

189
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,839
What can I do?

190
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:06,040
Mr. Shan,

191
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,920
didn't you go down the mountain to give lectures?

192
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,279
E Fei asked me to come back,

193
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,600
or else,

194
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:16,079
The Academy is going to make a mess of the world.

195
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,439
Do you know the rules of the Academy?

196
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,720
I know.

197
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:23,959
Come back.

198
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,879
You unfilial son

199
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,160
again. Stand still.

200
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,319
Qi Shan,

201
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:40,600
you've always been calm,

202
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,439
I have high hopes for you,

203
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,839
how can you hang out with him?

204
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:46,720
Students,

205
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,079
and you,

206
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,759
I heard that while I was away,

207
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,560
you were fooling around in class,

208
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:54,560
He even bragged about the imperial court system,

209
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,199
the student is

210
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,040
the leader of the mountain,

211
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,920
Not only that,

212
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:02,160
Wu Wancheng also openly contradicted seniors like us.

213
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,079
He doesn't care about etiquette at all.

214
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,199
He even talked about education,

215
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,639
and said some outrageous things.

216
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:10,560
Don't bother me.

217
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:11,560
You're the only one who talks too much.

218
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,600
Shut up!

219
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,040
Because of you.

220
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:15,680
You've ruined both of them.

221
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,240
Completely unruly,

222
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:18,600
Okay,

223
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:20,160
The three of you,

224
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,560
each of you will be punished with 20 rattan whips,

225
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,560
Go get punished tomorrow morning.

226
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,360
Mr. Shan,

227
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,480
there's nothing wrong with my theory.

228
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,639
Why should I be punished?

229
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:29,079
It's wrong if you don't follow the rules.

230
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:29,759
But if I

231
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:30,399
talk back again,

232
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:31,839
Get out of the Academy.

233
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,079
Hit him.

234
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:47,879
Wu Wancheng's father,

235
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:51,240
I'll take his place

236
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:51,879
head of a mountain

237
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:54,360
I'm willing to take the rest of the cane whip for Brother Wu.

238
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,439
With your permission,

239
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,040
Okay,

240
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,839
Since you're loyal,

241
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,680
I grant your request.

242
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,519
Mr. Xie.

243
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:26,680
-Brother Qi. -Brother Qi, I'm

244
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:30,120
sorry.

245
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,360
It's okay.

246
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:35,679
I also made a mistake first.

247
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,000
You deserve to be punished.

248
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,320
But you shouldn't be punished for me.

249
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,200
You've already beaten him.

250
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,879
Don't blame yourself.

251
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:48,600
If I don't speak so fast,

252
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,399
E Fei won't be able to catch anything on me.

253
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,799
You won't be punished for me.

254
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,440
Don't blame yourself.

255
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,279
Brother Qi, Brother Qi,

256
00:09:00,759 --> 00:09:01,279
Brother Qi,

257
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:02,360
Brother Qi, Qi Shan,

258
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:03,559
Brother Qi.

259
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:14,840
Hold on.

260
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,759
Shouldn't we have a good talk?

261
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,440
No.

262
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,000
Do you have any misunderstanding about me?

263
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,320
It has nothing to do with you.

264
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:28,679
Tang Wenqi,

265
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,480
is there anything you can't talk about?

266
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,679
It has to be like this every time.
