1
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,039
This is too simple.

2
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,559
Next. Next.

3
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:25,760
Gosh,

4
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,239
students from Gu Yuan Academy,

5
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,920
If you can't recite thousands of words,

6
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,880
what rules

7
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,399
should you pay attention to for poems?

8
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,000
It rhymes,

9
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,479
and,

10
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,880
Also,

11
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:44,840
also

12
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:48,399
Rhyme,

13
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,159
Pair,

14
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:50,119
also

15
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,039
Concept,

16
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:53,399
or is Master Qi right?

17
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:55,679
Wen Qi doesn't know anything.

18
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,439
Who said I wouldn't?

19
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,400
Your question is too basic.

20
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:09,640
I … I forgot.

21
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,079
You love to take risks.

22
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:16,280
And a blx.

23
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:18,200
It's hopeless.

24
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,319
It's just a thousand-character script, isn't it?

25
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,719
I must memorize it tonight.

26
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:25,120
Tomorrow,

27
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,439
I can surprise the audience.

28
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:33,959
What are you doing here?

29
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,519
Stop hiding.

30
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,480
I saw it.

31
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:38,120
Are you memorizing thousands of characters secretly?

32
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:40,000
Leave me alone.

33
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:40,680
Go back to sleep.

34
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:43,079
You want me to go back?

35
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,760
And then you got involved here.

36
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:46,120
What roll?

37
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,799
What are you talking about?

38
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:48,879
Don't disturb me.

39
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,079
All right, go back now.

40
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:52,040
We have an early class tomorrow.

41
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:52,840
No way.

42
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,560
I'm still trying to make a living without steaming steamed buns.

43
00:01:56,239 --> 00:01:57,480
I was so embarrassed today.

44
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:03,879
I don't understand.

45
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,439
Why do you have to go up and ask the students questions today?

46
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,840
I didn't mean to prove that

47
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,159
he can do it.

48
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:12,639
I can do it, too.

49
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:14,240
He,

50
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,560
Why are you competing with Brother Qi?

51
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,680
He's always been good at studying.

52
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,000
You didn't know it until the first day.

53
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:21,840
I know.

54
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:23,840
That's why you only play with him.

55
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,960
You don't care about my feelings at all.

56
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,319
What are you doing?

57
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,360
Youyou

58
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,439
Jealous again.

59
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:33,120
No, I didn't.

60
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:38,000
I don't think you fell in love with me

61
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,800
because you saw the color.

62
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:40,080
How is that possible?

63
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,319
Then why are you competing with Brother Qi?

64
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,360
Me,

65
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:47,159
Forget it.

66
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,960
Tang Wenqi is always sensitive,

67
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,439
You can be forgiven for thinking that way.

68
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,599
Just worry more about his feelings in the future.

69
00:02:57,759 --> 00:02:59,280
Okay, I got it.

70
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,120
To be honest with you,

71
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,080
you and Qi are both my best friends.

72
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:05,879
I've never compared you.

73
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,319
So you don't need to do this.

74
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,599
Brother Qi is good at reading,

75
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,039
while you are good at cleverness,

76
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,919
The talent you invented,

77
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,000
is outstanding among the crowd.

78
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:18,919
So don't belittle yourself.

79
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,400
So you mean,

80
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,199
I'm not that bad.

81
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,000
Of course,

82
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,039
you're great,

83
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:25,960
It's great.

84
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,360
Don't be melodramatic.

85
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,439
Pack your things

86
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:32,280
and go back to the supervisor.

87
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:33,639
We have to go down the mountain tomorrow.

88
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:35,319
Downhill,

89
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,360
there's something wrong with the three of you.

90
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,280
Brother Wu,

91
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,439
are you changing women's clothes in the college?

92
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:43,479
It's easy to find out.

93
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:44,319
That's right.

94
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,719
Why don't you wear men's clothes?

95
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:47,319
That's so ostentatious.

96
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,120
Today is a rest day. No one in the Academy

97
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,039
will say it again.

98
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,759
I'm a young girl.

99
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:53,439
It's not easy to get the chance,

100
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:54,560
so of course I have to dress up.

101
00:03:56,599 --> 00:03:57,439
I don't know who I'll wear it for.

102
00:03:58,199 --> 00:03:59,560
I'm not wearing it for you anyway.

103
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,080
Let's go.

104
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,560
Who wants to see you?

105
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:02,159
Get out of the way!

106
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,840
woman

107
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,719
Another big secret has been revealed.

108
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,400
What?

109
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,520
Ladies,

110
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,800
seeing is believing.

111
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,039
If you don't believe me,

112
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,319
you can go with me tomorrow.

113
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,399
Okay,

114
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:18,920
If this is true,

115
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,199
it must be severely punished.

116
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:26,360
When you say "together",

117
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,240
you mean "peeping together".

118
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,600
Yes, Mr. Shan.

119
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:31,639
I'm a model for you,

120
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:34,079
How could you do such a nasty thing?

121
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:36,240
We have a legitimate reason.

122
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:37,560
question

123
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:43,480
I got you, Wu Wancheng,

124
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:44,399
You.

125
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:47,839
Daddy,

126
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:51,319
this is the Ladies'Mountain Chief you

127
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:52,600
mentioned. Greetings to you, Mountain

128
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,160
Chief.

129
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,560
You are

130
00:04:58,879 --> 00:04:59,600
the head of the mountain,

131
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,920
Are we rehearsing

132
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,319
for the performance in a few days?

133
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,240
Look.

134
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:05,720
We are so serious.

135
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:18,639
It's really serious.

136
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,920
What rehearsal?

137
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,920
In the women's dress you wore that day,

138
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,399
you're a woman.

139
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,160
Senior,

140
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:25,839
don't talk nonsense.

141
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,920
If you wear women's clothes,

142
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,439
you must be a woman.

143
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,480
That's right. So

144
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,639
I'm a girl, too?

145
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:33,480
Take off your clothes.

146
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,439
Show us.

147
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,480
Are you a man or a woman?

148
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:36,759
Senior E Fei,

149
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,480
how can you just let people take off their clothes?

150
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:40,480
We live together with Brother Wu every day,

151
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,920
how can we not know if he is a man or a woman?

152
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,519
Well,

153
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,199
if Brother Wu takes off his clothes,

154
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:45,439
It proves that he's not a woman.

155
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,000
You wronged him.

156
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:48,480
What should we do about it?

157
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:50,560
According to the school rules,

158
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,040
he should be expelled from the Academy.

159
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:55,639
Why?

160
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:56,639
All right,

161
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,680
that's all for today.

162
00:05:58,879 --> 00:05:59,600
Don't mention it again.

163
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:00,279
But, Mr. Shan,

164
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,279
are you talking nonsense?

165
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,240
I won't punish you.

166
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,839
We've already let him off the hook.

167
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,319
Take care, Mr. Shan.

168
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,360
Mr. Shan,

169
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,680
let me explain.

170
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,240
You two look so charming

171
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:18,920
in women's clothes.

172
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,360
If it weren't for saving you,

173
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:21,959
I wouldn't wear women's clothes?

174
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:23,279
Thanks to Wen Qi.

175
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,480
If he hadn't heard E Fei's complaint in advance,

176
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,680
we wouldn't have prepared for it.

177
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,399
Well,

178
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,519
thank me.

179
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:30,959
Thank you, Wen Qi.

180
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,959
But

181
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:36,519
the way you look in women's clothes

182
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,639
is OK, OK,

183
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,399
Well,

184
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,199
what do you mean

185
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,040
by natural beauty.

186
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,480
That's enough for you two.

187
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,319
All right,

188
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:51,319
let's go get changed.

189
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:55,199
Sure enough,

190
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,639
men are enchanting.

191
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:58,759
There's really no woman. What's the matter?

192
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,639
That's great.

193
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,040
You scared the hell out of me.

194
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:06,439
I mean, this student

195
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:07,920
is really good at writing.

196
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,240
Really? Let me see. Let me see.

197
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,959
Zhou Yang,

198
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,839
he's a little clever.

199
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:16,160
When I met him before,

200
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,120
he was the leader of a group of beggars.

201
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:18,839
Really?

202
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:20,279
There's something.

203
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:21,879
I suggest that

204
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,800
Zhou Yang be transferred to Class A tomorrow.

205
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:24,920
We should train

206
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,120
such students well.

207
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:26,720
I agree.

208
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,439
I agree too.

209
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:29,319
Can you not agree?

210
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,480
Do you know how to recite

211
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:32,720
thousands of characters?

212
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,399
If you can read more,

213
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:36,199
who are you talking about?

214
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:38,040
Who can't read?

215
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,240
Who can't recite

216
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:39,920
thousands of words?

217
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,120
You're the only smart one, aren't you?

218
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,279
If you study well,

219
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:43,319
I can't do anything

220
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:44,240
What do you think? Brother Qi,

221
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:45,319
have you made it clear?

222
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,399
They haven't seen Zhou Yang today.

223
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,360
Does anyone know where Zhou Yang's house is?

224
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,399
I asked him. He said

225
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:51,720
he lives in the mountains,

226
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,680
How should we find it?

227
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,519
How about this?

228
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,279
Wan Cheng and I will go to the mountains first,

229
00:07:58,439 --> 00:07:59,839
and you can teach the children.

230
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,279
All right.

231
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:01,720
Okay,

232
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:03,199
I'll ask Xi Feng

233
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:04,360
to inquire about Zhou Yang's residence later.

234
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:04,800
Okay,

235
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:06,399
How about the housekeepers meeting tonight?

236
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:07,240
Okay,

237
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:09,759
Zhou Yang.

238
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:14,759
Tang Wenqi,

239
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:15,680
slow down.

240
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:16,519
Me,

241
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:17,839
I'm a little scared.

242
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:18,759
Are you scared?

243
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,839
You came out in the middle of the night to blow up the toilet,

244
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:21,519
are you scared?

245
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:22,639
This isn't an academy,

246
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,560
but you're afraid of wolves

247
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,959
in the mountains.

248
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:30,920
I'm afraid of snakes, too.

249
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:33,879
Look, there are snakes,

250
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,480
Help!

251
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:47,360
Snakes,

252
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:49,080
Women,

253
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:51,000
You want to get my attention.

254
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,600
You don't have to do it this way.

255
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:54,720
I mean,

256
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,919
you have snakes on your feet.

257
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:05,600
I dropped you.

258
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:06,960
And he asked you to help me back.

259
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,200
Thank you so much.

260
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,200
You deserve to be bitten.

261
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,279
Who told you to scare me with snakes?

262
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,399
That means snakes like me too.

263
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,039
Believe it or not, I'll throw you into the mountain,

264
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,840
and throw me away.

265
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:19,360
Where can you find such a lovely friend?

266
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,320
You still talk so much when you're injured.

267
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:23,720
By the way,

268
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:26,240
Is Wu Wancheng your real name?

269
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,000
Wu Wancheng is my elder brother's name.

270
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,120
My name is Wu

271
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:31,480
(Wu) (Wu),

272
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:33,440
()

273
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,080
() (),

274
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:37,480
Take care of yourself.

275
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:42,320
I don't know where Zhou Yang is.

276
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,320
Is there any danger?

277
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,039
He's not in the mountains.

278
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:47,519
He should be at home.

279
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,320
I'm fine.

280
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:49,559
I'll keep looking tomorrow.
