1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:06,759
1。

2
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,160
General,

3
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,519
Miss is here.

4
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:25,600
Father.

5
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:32,200
Look at you now.

6
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:34,439
Do you still look like a girl?

7
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,039
I think it's good now,

8
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:40,240
and I've learned a lot here.

9
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,520
The girl who asked you to study here

10
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:45,000
should be well-bred at home.

11
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:47,280
Why are you showing up in public like this?

12
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:49,359
How can I get married in the future?

13
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,960
Then I won't get married.

14
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:52,039
What's so important about that?

15
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:53,840
For a woman,

16
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,479
the most important thing is to get married.

17
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:57,799
You said it's not important.

18
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:58,759
The most important thing for a person to live

19
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:01,200
is to live with value and meaning.

20
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:03,399
How can you depend on others because of your life?

21
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,640
You're really good at it.

22
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,799
Now you dare to talk back to your father.

23
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:07,560
General, calm down.

24
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:09,519
Don't speak for her.

25
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,200
Tomorrow, the two of you,

26
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,400
pack your things,

27
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,200
Leave with me.

28
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:16,560
My daughter wants to study,

29
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,799
to work for the people,

30
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:18,879
I want to serve the country more.

31
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,439
Reading books shouldn't be done by women,

32
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,000
why do you join in the fun?

33
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,840
Why can't women study?

34
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,319
Okay, okay.

35
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,519
In that case,

36
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,359
I'll give you five days,

37
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,000
Five days later,

38
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:34,439
if Gu Yuan Academy doesn't openly recruit female disciples,

39
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:35,159
Come home with me.

40
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:35,959
Father,

41
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:41,000
what's wrong with you?

42
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,120
I didn't sleep well

43
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,400
last night. I'm fine. I'm just a little cold.

44
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,400
Your hands are cold.

45
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,840
Are you sick?

46
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,239
I'm in class.

47
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:51,599
Don't pull your hands off me.

48
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:52,920
I'm fine.

49
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,319
I'll look for Lingxiu after class later.

50
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:54,920
No way.

51
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:56,079
You need to rest now.

52
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:57,680
Master,

53
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,159
Wu Wancheng,

54
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:02,280
I don't understand.

55
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:03,480
You're so sick.

56
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,959
I can't stay and take care of you.

57
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:07,120
The exam is in three days.

58
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:08,599
Reading is more important than me.

59
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,080
Don't worry.

60
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,719
I know everything I learned today.

61
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,280
Nonsense.

62
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:15,520
You think you can

63
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,840
take the medicine now.

64
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,800
Come on,

65
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:24,479
Take the medicine.

66
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,360
If you don't leave, I won't drink it.

67
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:28,240
If you don't drink it, I won't leave.

68
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:30,319
If you don't leave, I won't drink it.

69
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:31,039
Drink it.

70
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:31,800
Go now.

71
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,759
I just went out to get some snacks.

72
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,639
What's wrong with them?

73
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:35,039
Drink it.

74
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:36,039
She asked him to go to class.

75
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:36,800
He's not going.

76
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:38,759
Got it.

77
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:40,439
Take it.

78
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,039
Wen Qi,

79
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,080
the patient is taken care of by a doctor,

80
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,000
The three of us should go to class.

81
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:48,400
Let's go.

82
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:50,960
You,

83
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,400
Let's go.

84
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,800
Have a good lesson.

85
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,639
All right,

86
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:56,919
you can talk now,

87
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:57,919
What did you say?

88
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,719
You're suffocating yourself.

89
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,759
You still refuse to tell me.

90
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:03,800
I just have a cold. It's okay.

91
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,240
But Chestnut told me everything.

92
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,039
About General Wu.

93
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,319
It's okay. We'll be apart

94
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,759
sooner or later anyway.

95
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,639
Are you sure you don't want to part with it?

96
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,960
Of course I don't want to.

97
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,280
But which academy have you seen recruit female disciples?

98
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,439
Or I can ask father to beg the mountain leader.

99
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:28,520
Maybe there's still a chance.

100
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,599
Don't.

101
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,680
I've troubled Master Feng enough.

102
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,439
I can't give him any more trouble.

103
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:35,840
But I really don't want you to leave.

104
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:37,759
Why don't we

105
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,520
try again?

106
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,360
Just like the private school last time,

107
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,319
I almost made them

108
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:44,680
lose their books last time.

109
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:47,759
I really don't want to act on impulse anymore.

110
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,840
Is this really the only way?

111
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,479
If there's still a chance,

112
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,400
how great would it be?

113
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,960
So bitter.

114
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:00,280
Can you stop drinking?

115
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,439
Brother Qi,

116
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,439
I'm sorry Wen Qi,

117
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,839
I didn't mean to scare you.

118
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,160
You're just in time.

119
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,600
Help me see if my explanation is complete.

120
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,879
It's very good.

121
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:31,800
It's complete.

122
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,000
That's good.

123
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:36,040
I've been struggling for a long time.

124
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,120
I don't know if I'll take the exam the day after tomorrow.

125
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:40,480
I don't know if I'll take the exam the day after tomorrow.

126
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:41,399
All I know is,

127
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,920
if you keep going through this,

128
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:44,519
I'm afraid he won't make it to the exam day.

129
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,360
I have a poor foundation.

130
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,079
So I have to work harder.

131
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:49,920
Besides,

132
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,639
I'm going to be in the top three.

133
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,040
Don't you know how stressed I am?

134
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,560
I know you did it for us.

135
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:58,079
But I'm afraid it'll backfire

136
00:04:58,399 --> 00:04:59,680
if you go on like this.

137
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:01,720
Brother Qi,

138
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,199
do you think,

139
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,360
We've become unfamiliar lately.

140
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:10,480
No.

141
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,240
Maybe you've been working too hard these days,

142
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,759
so we don't have time to talk.

143
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:18,120
Maybe so.

144
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,480
Then you can go back first.

145
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:22,720
Let me have a look.

146
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,279
Wen Qi,

147
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:31,079
it's been a long time since you solved the Nine Continents.

148
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:32,959
I can't take care of these lately.

149
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:34,120
Besides,

150
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:36,279
I tried to solve it for a long time, but I couldn't solve it.

151
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:39,040
It's okay. Solve it.

152
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,480
Relax.

153
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:42,959
I'm leaving.

154
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:44,879
Qi,

155
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:47,439
I know you like Wu.

156
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:51,560
But she likes you.

157
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,360
What are we

158
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,240
thinking?

159
00:05:58,839 --> 00:06:00,160
We'll always be brothers.

160
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,160
Brother Qi,

161
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,560
I untied

162
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,279
my spring hair,

163
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:20,879
Autumn harvest In fact,

164
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,079
today's exam,

165
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,519
It's the time to test everyone's achievements in one year's study.

166
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,160
I hope you can wait for the exam with sincerity.

167
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,439
The exam

168
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:31,240
begins now.

169
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:17,199
Tang Wenqi,

170
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,240
how dare you cheat in the exam?

171
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:20,199
This is not mine.

172
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:21,560
How dare you make excuses?

173
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,800
It's really not mine.

174
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,600
Stand still.

175
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:25,959
Everyone, stop writing. Qi Shan,

176
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,759
put away the papers.

177
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:29,160
Everyone didn't agree with me.

178
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:30,519
You can't leave the exam room.

179
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,639
Yes.

180
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,079
How could Tang Wenqi cheat?

181
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,639
Tang Wenqi,

182
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,279
what's going on?

183
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:41,759
There is no handwriting on this paper,

184
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,160
how can you say it's mine?

185
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:44,360
You still want to lie to me?

186
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,120
This ink appears

187
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,279
when exposed to heat,

188
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,040
You're the only one in the Academy who knows how to play this trick.

189
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:18,879
Who else is not yours?

190
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,319
That doesn't prove it's me.

191
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:22,079
Mr. Shan, I really didn't cheat.

192
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,399
Why don't you believe me?

193
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,199
I want you to be in the top three!

194
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,160
I just hope you can learn from it,

195
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:29,160
work hard and make progress,

196
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,959
I didn't expect you to use this method to take the exam.

197
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,399
Dad, I really didn't cheat.

198
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:34,639
Why don't you believe me?

199
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,759
Because you usually play with things and lose your will.

200
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,159
It's not a plaything,

201
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,519
it's a coincidence,

202
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,200
It's my dream.

203
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,080
Dream?

204
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:52,480
Are you dreaming?

205
00:08:56,919 --> 00:08:57,919
What happened today

206
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:00,200
is the result of your plaything and your loss of will.

207
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,200
What consequences?

208
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,000
I really didn't cheat.

209
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,039
I don't believe you didn't see it.

210
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,519
Say something.

211
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,559
Stop fooling around.

212
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Don't you even have the courage to tell the truth?

213
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,120
Okay,

214
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:27,320
Then I have nothing to say.

215
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,799
Mr. Shan,

216
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,759
can I have a look at the note?
