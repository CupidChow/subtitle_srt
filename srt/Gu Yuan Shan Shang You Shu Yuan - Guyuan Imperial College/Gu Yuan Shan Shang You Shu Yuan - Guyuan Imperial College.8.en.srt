1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:06,919
1。

2
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:20,519
Brother Wu,

3
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,359
Brother Qi,

4
00:00:23,559 --> 00:00:25,120
Are you okay?

5
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:27,359
Let me get you a glass of water.

6
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,199
No.

7
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:32,479
I told you I'm fine.

8
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,479
Don't bother.

9
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,560
If you don't say it,

10
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,439
a man will shed tears,

11
00:00:40,759 --> 00:00:41,799
Stop crying.

12
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:44,679
I'm not crying.

13
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm strong.

14
00:00:59,479 --> 00:01:00,079
Boss,

15
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:00,960
where's Xie Huan'er?

16
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm annoyed.

17
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:02,479
Go away!

18
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,560
Tell me,

19
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,760
if you hurry up today,

20
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,439
So Qi Shan wouldn't have beaten us to it, right?

21
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:08,359
That's right.

22
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,640
What are you talking about? You

23
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,480
and I can see it.

24
00:01:14,599 --> 00:01:15,879
When Wu Wancheng fainted,

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,040
you were so anxious.

26
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:17,959
No, I didn't.

27
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:19,359
Why did you help people out

28
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,480
last time at the campus?

29
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,680
In the end, in order to attract fire and offend E Fei,

30
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:25,239
you just care about him.

31
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:26,000
Shut up!

32
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:26,560
Don't talk nonsense.

33
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,200
No, I didn't.

34
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:29,560
If you don't admit it,

35
00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:31,040
I won't be there for you.

36
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:32,359
There will be evening repairs

37
00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:33,000
later. Goodbye,

38
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:35,840
Let's talk a little longer.

39
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:39,120
Then tell me,

40
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,480
I don't really like men anymore, do I?

41
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:43,319
How about this?

42
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,760
You need to divert your attention

43
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,400
and look for it.

44
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:49,680
Miss Qingyi, whom you fell in love with a while ago,

45
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:50,760
is right.

46
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:53,519
My sister Tsing Yi,

47
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,599
this rattan is too harsh.

48
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,359
My vitality has been hurt.

49
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,400
It's hard for your body to take it.

50
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:02,480
Is it that serious?

51
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,680
Qi Shan is in a bad condition now,

52
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:07,599
I only have a few commonly used herbs around me,

53
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,680
I can't help him recover.

54
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,479
In your opinion,

55
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:12,800
what should I do?

56
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:15,439
Why don't we let Qi Shan go home?

57
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,000
Get a good doctor to recuperate.

58
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,800
Otherwise, the root cause of the disease will fall.

59
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,439
Got it, Sage.

60
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:23,080
I'll send him down the mountain tomorrow.

61
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,400
Brother Qi,

62
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:32,560
have a good rest.

63
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,240
Xifeng, thank you, Young Master.

64
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,439
Young Master,

65
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,439
have we met before?

66
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,120
It's getting late.

67
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:42,360
I have to go back now.

68
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:43,199
Brother Qi,

69
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,120
take a good rest.

70
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,759
And remember Master Feng's instructions,

71
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,080
I'm leaving now.

72
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,240
Who wants candied haws?

73
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,240
I'll eat it. I'll eat it.

74
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:57,360
I'll give it to me.

75
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:57,919
Okay,

76
00:02:58,039 --> 00:03:00,240
But this candied haws is not for nothing.

77
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,800
I have to do you a favor.

78
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,240
Is that okay?

79
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,240
Let me help you.

80
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,680
-Me too. -Help me.

81
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:05,080
Okay,

82
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,800
I'll give you one first,

83
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:07,680
Come on,

84
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,719
Give it to everyone for me.

85
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,960
Help me remember what she looks like.

86
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,039
Help me find clues about this person.

87
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:23,680
If there is any clue,

88
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:24,639
let me know as soon as possible,

89
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,039
Okay,

90
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,120
What if someone can help me find her?

91
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,319
There will be a bigger reward.

92
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:29,240
No problem.

93
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,599
That's what we're good at.

94
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:31,000
Okay,

95
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:31,599
Come on,

96
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,879
Lady Qing Yi,

97
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:36,919
I got it.

98
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,199
Kids,

99
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:43,879
what are you going to do?

100
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:44,800
Sir,

101
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,199
have you ever seen a woman in Tsing Yi?

102
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:48,439
She looks like this.

103
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:52,400
I remember now.

104
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:54,759
I saw her in a temple outside the city.

105
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:56,280
I think she's staying

106
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,280
there. Thank you, sir.

107
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,319
You're welcome.

108
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:02,240
I told you to scold me when Tang Wenqi was fine.

109
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,639
I'll teach you a lesson this time.

110
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,240
Why do I feel that

111
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,159
the person in the portrait

112
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:11,919
is more like this young master?

113
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,399
Sister Wu,

114
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,240
Lingxiu,

115
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:25,720
Hurry up!

116
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:26,879
Come and help me.

117
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:27,240
Luckily, I met you.

118
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:28,360
Help me!

119
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,600
Sister Wu,

120
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,240
I can't bandage it now.

121
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,600
Go back to the Academy as soon as possible.

122
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,480
Okay,

123
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:39,319
Watch out!

124
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,040
You were badly hurt this time.

125
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:45,800
Remember not to move around these few days.

126
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:47,720
You might hurt your bones.

127
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:49,839
Got it.

128
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,279
What bad luck.

129
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:54,000
How did you fall into the pit?

130
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,600
I don't think

131
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,959
it's your bad luck,

132
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,120
Someone must have hurt you on purpose.

133
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,759
You mean,

134
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:04,160
someone put the trapper there on purpose,

135
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,040
Not only that,

136
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,600
he must have dug a trap.

137
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,680
When I was at the trap today,

138
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,480
I found that the mud was wet,

139
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,959
This must be the new mud we just dug today.

140
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:18,680
The murderer must have known that you went down the mountain today,

141
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,959
so he tampered with the path you had to go through.

142
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,480
What a lack of virtue.

143
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:24,079
If I find him,

144
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,279
I'll slap him a few times.

145
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:27,480
It's not hard to find out.

146
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:28,920
Look at your shoes.

147
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,519
What's wrong with my shoes?

148
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,040
The mud in the Academy

149
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,879
is different from the mud on the mountain,

150
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:39,079
The Academy is yellow mud?

151
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:41,360
And the mud on the mountain is blackened,

152
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,800
so the murderer,

153
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:44,399
There must be black mud

154
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:49,120
on the soles of your feet,

155
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:51,000
Why are you so smart?

156
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,920
You're so smart.

157
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,720
What do

158
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,800
you mean?

159
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:01,519
It's just an exaggerated figure of speech.

160
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:06,399
Then I'm really ashamed of myself.

161
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:11,199
That's right. That's how it's used.

162
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,360
Why are you so cute?

163
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,040
Sister, take good care of yourself,

164
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,600
and I'll help you to class tomorrow.

165
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:16,839
Okay,

166
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,360
Be careful on your way back.

167
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,759
Don't talk to other men.

168
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:24,680
Watch out!

169
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:25,759
It's dangerous.

170
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,040
Black mud.

171
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,839
Why didn't you knock when you came in?

172
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,480
Why did I knock on the door when I entered my room?

173
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:41,240
Did you hurt your foot?

174
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,040
Leave me alone.

175
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,199
It's like no one wants to take care of it.

176
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,040
Tang Wenqi,

177
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:04,879
it's you.

178
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,720
What do you mean by me?

179
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,560
You put the trapper on the back hill?

180
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,759
I hurt my foot.

181
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,759
You were caught by an animal trap.

182
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,560
Stop asking.

183
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:13,560
You're the murderer.

184
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:15,040
I was kind enough to help you.

185
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:16,000
Don't falsely accuse me.

186
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:17,959
Stop crying and pretending to be merciful.

187
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:19,079
I want you to help me

188
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,560
fart. I didn't do it at all.

189
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,000
You're the one who farted,

190
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,800
Okay,

191
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,079
After I find out the real murderer,

192
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,600
I'll ask you to kneel down and apologize to me.

193
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,399
Tang Wenqi.

194
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,600
I think I know who the killer is.

195
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:37,199
If you look at this pit,

196
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,439
you'll know who the murderer is.

197
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,800
What are you looking at?

198
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:40,759
Look at the footprints.

199
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,279
Footprints,

200
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:45,480
Except for their footprints?

201
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:47,399
This is the only one left.

202
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,680
As long as we compare the size of our feet

203
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,920
with the students of the Academy,

204
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,800
Then we'll know who the culprit is.

205
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,040
But for the hundreds of students in the Academy,

206
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,480
could you let them try one by one?

207
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,399
How about this?

208
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,920
Use your shoes as a reference.

209
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:02,319
You'll know when you take it back

210
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:03,079
and compare it with them.

211
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:04,120
Me,

212
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:05,519
I can't do that.

213
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,600
These are my new shoes.

214
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,800
I don't want to step on mud.

215
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,560
I told you to take it off. Don't talk nonsense.

216
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,800
No, boss.

217
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,800
My mother made this for me herself.

218
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,879
It's useless.

219
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:16,360
I'll do it myself.

220
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:25,639
Boss,

221
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,759
you didn't do this, did you?

222
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:29,160
-I did it. -Why should I look into it? -You're so

223
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,079
careless.

224
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,440
But your feet are the biggest

225
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:35,639
in the Academy.

226
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,320
No one is your size.

227
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,519
That's right.

228
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,480
Could it be that the clue is broken?

229
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:46,000
If you ask me,

230
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:46,960
you should stop investigating.

231
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,159
You can explain it to Wu Wancheng.

232
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:49,799
No way.

233
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,879
We have to check.

234
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:51,720
But

235
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:53,480
there's no other clue.

236
00:08:56,679 --> 00:08:58,320
Did you take what I asked you to take?

237
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:00,039
Take it.

238
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,960
It should be the one who pinched Wu Wancheng.

239
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:06,799
Look,

240
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,039
There's blood here.

241
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,320
Each blacksmith has a different way of making the interface,

242
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,320
which is obviously the way of making the West King blacksmith.

243
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:16,360
Ironsmith Wang,

244
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,559
do you want to check the blacksmith shop again?

245
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,240
Yes.
