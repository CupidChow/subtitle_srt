1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Good morning.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:10,000
What kind of morning will we have on Wednesday, February 28th?

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
This year, 2024 is the year of the rooster.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Tomorrow is February 29th, when we will be visiting only once every four years.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The year of the rooster is a special year that is 366 days.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,000
By the way, do you know why there is this year of the rooster?

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Actually, the Earth is the sun.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Minato.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Minato.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Minato.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Minato.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I was surprised. I thought you were dead.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Stop it.

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Here.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Thank you.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It's still moving.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It's not broken.

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
What were you listening to on the radio?

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
A song I made a long time ago.

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The song about your first love with Minato.

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
How do you spend your special day?

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Hey, Himari.

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
What's wrong?

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Don't follow me.

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Why are you crying?

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
It has nothing to do with Kotaro.

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
You said everything.

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Look.

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Go.

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You're not a child anymore.

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Leave me alone.

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
What's wrong?

33
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Mom.

34
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Welcome back, Himari.

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Welcome back. You're early.

36
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Dad was here too.

37
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
What?

38
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
You can't be here.

39
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Stop it.

40
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Mom.

41
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It smells good.

42
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It's your favorite flower.

43
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Yes, my dad brought it.

44
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Is it a birthday present?

45
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It's your mom's birthday after 4 years.

46
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Yes, it's been 4 years.

47
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Your mom is finally 9 years old tomorrow.

48
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Even if it's your birthday every 4 years,

49
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
you're getting older every year.

50
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I see.

51
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Mr. Kayoda, can I come in?

52
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Yes.

53
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Himari.

54
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
What?

55
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
What's wrong?

56
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Nothing.

57
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Did you fight with Kotaro again?

58
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It has nothing to do with Kotaro.

59
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
He's just a child.

60
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
He's always so stubborn.

61
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
What?

62
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
The person I like...

63
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
...made me a lover.

64
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
The senior from school who told me about it?

65
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I should have liked him.

66
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I should have liked him.

67
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:32,000
It's wonderful to fall in love and fall in love with someone.

68
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
When you fall in love,

69
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
it's all so painful.

70
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I have a favor to ask you.

71
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Himari?

72
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
What are you doing?

73
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I want you to bring this box to my mom.

74
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Himari, can I come in?

75
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
The teacher told me today...

76
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
...to prepare myself.

77
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
But mom is fine.

78
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
When I moved to this hospital,

79
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
do you remember that you said you couldn't come to my birthday party?

80
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
But mom, you did your best.

81
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It was supposed to be the hardest,

82
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
but you always smiled.

83
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,000
So, I want to give you my best on your birthday.

84
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Himari, I have a favor to ask you.

85
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
What?

86
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I want you to go to Tokyo...

87
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
...and deliver this to him.

88
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I want you to go to Tokyo.

89
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I want you to go to Tokyo.

90
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I want you to go to Tokyo.

91
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I want you to go to Tokyo.

92
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I want you to go to Tokyo.

93
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I want you to go to Tokyo.

94
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I want you to go to Tokyo.

95
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I want you to go to Tokyo.

96
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Tokyo

97
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I'm glad it didn't break.

98
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
It took me two weeks to get the gift.

99
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Stop riding the bike.

100
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Stop riding the bike.

101
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Bikes are no good.

102
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
The helmet is no good.

103
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Where is it?

104
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
It's no good.

105
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Ms. Koyoda.

106
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Yes?

107
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Sorry, can you hold this?

108
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Just a little more.

109
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Sorry.

110
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Oh.

111
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
That's mine.

112
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
That's Minato.

113
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Do you know him?

114
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
He's the former head of the Kendo club.

115
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
He's handsome and has good grades.

116
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You don't know him?

117
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
No.

118
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
His mom got sick and quit.

119
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
His dad died in an accident.

120
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Minato is the only one who's in the hospital.

121
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Tokyo

122
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Excuse me.

123
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Is Minato here?

124
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
He's on leave.

125
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
His mom died.

126
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Tokyo

127
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Minato.

128
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
You've been working hard.

129
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
You've been taking care of your mom every day.

130
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Thank you.

131
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Thank you.

132
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
See you.

133
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Hey, Miu.

134
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
You came to buy my sartan again?

135
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
It's delicious.

136
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I'm glad Ryusei got a good grade.

137
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
You're the best.

138
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Miu, did you see Minato?

139
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
No.

140
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
He hasn't been to school.

141
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I see.

142
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Taima.

143
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I'm home.

144
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I'm home.

145
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Tokyo

146
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Excuse me.

147
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Excuse me.

148
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Minato

149
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I'm Tamashiro Miu, freshman year.

150
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Are you Minato?

151
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
What?

152
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Oh.

153
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I dropped this MD when I hit the hospital.

154
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Tokyo

155
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
This is mine.

156
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
That's mine.

157
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Sorry.

158
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
It's the same.

159
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Tokyo

160
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
You don't go to school?

161
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Tokyo

162
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
This is the best sartan in the world.

163
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
This is the sartan that my childhood friend's family makes.

164
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
It tastes like sugar.

165
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
It's delicious.

166
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Bye.

167
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Minato.

168
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
See you at school.

169
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Thank you.

170
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Tokyo

171
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Tokyo

172
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Miu, take a bath first.

173
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Wait.

174
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Don't come in without permission.

175
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Okay.

176
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Tokyo

177
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Long time no see.

178
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Long time no see.

179
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Tokyo

180
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Tokyo

181
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Tokyo

182
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Minato

183
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Tokyo

184
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Tokyo

185
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
It's early.

186
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I like you.

187
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I'm going to hear it.

188
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Tokyo

189
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000

Tokyo

195
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Tokyo

196
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Tokyo

197
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Tokyo

198
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
This sea continues to the future.

199
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,000
What kind of world is spreading beyond the sea?

200
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I want to go.

201
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
To the future.

202
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
What will you do after graduation?

203
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I'm going to Tokyo University.

204
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I'm not sure if I'll go to Okinawa.

205
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I want to try what I want to do.

206
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I want to live without regret.

207
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Minato-senpai, you can go anywhere.

208
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
You can be anything.

209
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
What do you want to do?

210
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I've always been used to music when I'm tired.

211
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
So I want to make music myself someday.

212
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
You want to make music, not listen to it.

213
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
That's great.

214
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
What about you, Tamashiro-san?

215
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Do you have any dreams?

216
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
My mother is a translator.

217
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I've been longing for it since I was little.

218
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
So I'm studying English.

219
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I see.

220
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:57,000
But I thought the future was just a beginning.

221
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I wish I could have a happy life.

222
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I know it's impossible.

223
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,000
But I think there are things that never change.

224
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I'll do everything I can to make it happen.

225
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Minato-senpai!

226
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Congratulations!

227
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Please come!

228
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Please take a picture!

229
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Please come!

230
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
What are you staring at?

231
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Are you going home?

232
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Yes.

233
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Today is your 4th birthday.

234
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:33,000
You must be preparing a feast for your mother.

235
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I didn't want to come this year.

236
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Miu!

237
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
What?

238
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Well...

239
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
What?

240
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
You look weird.

241
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Stop it!

242
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:18,000
You don't have to go to Minato-senpai's place.

243
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I'm going home.

244
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Minato-senpai!

245
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Today is your birthday.

246
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
I'm going home.

247
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Do you know?

248
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Why do you ask?

249
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I don't know.

250
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Minato-senpai, do you know this?

251
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
The man who proposed to you on February 29th,

252
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
you can't say no.

253
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
What's that?

254
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
It's like the old law in Ireland.

255
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
It's strange.

256
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
This is Japan.

257
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I know.

258
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
I just said it.

259
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
If you have a wish,

260
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
I'll make it come true today.

261
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
It's your birthday.

262
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
It's special.

263
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Will you really make it come true?

264
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Anything?

265
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
If it's something I can do.

266
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
I like you.

267
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Please go out with me.

268
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
No way.

269
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I can't do that.

270
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
What?

271
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
I can say no.

272
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,000
What wish should I make?

273
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
What should I do?

274
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,000
I want to hear Minato-senpai's song.

275
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
I don't want to say no.

276
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
I like you.

277
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Will you go out with me?

278
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Yes.

279
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
I'll call you again.

280
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Yes.

281
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Minato-senpai,

282
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:32,000
I'm going to Tokyo after I graduate high school.

283
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
I want to go to the sea with you.

284
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
I want to go to Tokyo with you.

285
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,000
I want to see the sea from the other side.

286
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
So,

287
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
please wait for me.

288
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Okay.

289
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I'll be waiting for you.

290
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Miyu.

291
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Yes.

292
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I'm sorry.

293
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
I'm sorry.

294
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
I'm sorry.

295
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
I'm sorry.

296
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
I'm sorry.

297
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
I'm sorry.

298
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
I'm sorry.

299
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
I'm sorry.

300
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I'm sorry.

301
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
I'm sorry.

302
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
I'm sorry.

303
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I'm sorry.

304
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
I'm sorry.

305
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I'm sorry.

306
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
I'm sorry.

307
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I'm sorry.

308
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,240
Android

309
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:03,900
Since when I have to talk and eat

310
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:06,340
Why been at a place like this

311
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:08,340
I can't believe you're going to university.

312
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:11,340
I've been studying for two years.

313
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:17,340
What?

314
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:21,340
Come back anytime.

315
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:23,340
I'll be here forever.

316
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:27,340
Ryusei, you too. Good luck.

317
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:08,340
Minato!

318
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:32,340
You're here.

319
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:34,340
Yes, I'm here.

320
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:38,340
I'm sorry.

321
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:00,340
Excuse me.

322
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,340
Are you a new student?

323
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:03,340
Yes.

324
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:06,340
Write your name and your school name here.

325
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:08,340
Yes.

326
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:18,340
Miyu?

327
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:20,340
What?

328
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:27,340
I'm Kasumi. I'm a vocalist for Minato's band.

329
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:30,340
I've heard about you from Minato.

330
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:33,340
I'm glad to meet you.

331
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:37,340
Thank you.

332
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:53,340
I practiced with Minato.

333
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:55,340
Can you teach me how to play the guitar?

334
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:56,340
Of course.

335
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:58,340
Come to my class next week.

336
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:00,340
Thank you.

337
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:11,340
Minato, how many new students are you going to have?

338
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:13,340
About 30 to 40.

339
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:14,340
Really?

340
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:16,340
Minato, you're so cool.

341
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:19,340
I was just saying, Kasumi, who was next to me.

342
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:21,340
You're so beautiful.

343
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:22,340
You two look good together.

344
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:24,340
Are you dating?

345
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:26,340
What?

346
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:28,340
You look like you're dating.

347
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:30,340
You two look good together.

348
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:32,340
You're so cool.

349
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:34,340
I was just talking to you.

350
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:35,340
What's that sound?

351
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:37,340
It's a deep sound.

352
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:39,340
I see.

353
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:41,340
Me too.

354
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:49,340
You're not going to do it until you're done.

355
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:51,340
What?

356
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:54,340
I'm told you're cool.

357
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:04,340
You're cute, Miyu.

358
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:10,340
When I'm with you, I feel relaxed.

359
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:12,340
I see.

360
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:17,340
I came to Tokyo because of you.

361
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:24,340
When things got better, you let me move forward.

362
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:29,340
I wanted to find my way in music.

363
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:32,340
It's all thanks to you.

364
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:34,340
I see.

365
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:38,340
I'm grateful to you.

366
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:43,340
You taught me how to play music.

367
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:45,340
I'm your Kasumi.

368
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:48,340
Why are you saying that?

369
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:52,340
I want to tell you how I feel.

370
00:32:56,340 --> 00:33:00,340
I'm serious about music.

371
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:03,340
Let's do our best together.

372
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:05,340
Okay.

373
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:08,340
I'm sorry.

374
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:10,340
What?

375
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:14,340
Hey.

376
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:22,340
What's going on?

377
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:24,340
Minato has changed.

378
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:27,340
He's a Tokyo person.

379
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:29,340
You haven't changed.

380
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,340
You're still the same.

381
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:33,340
I haven't changed.

382
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:35,340
I don't want to change.

383
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:41,340
You said you wanted to be Minato, not Minato.

384
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:44,340
Minato?

385
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:48,340
Yes.

386
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:50,340
You're an idiot.

387
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:52,340
Why?

388
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:01,340
Let's go home.

389
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:08,340
You're an idiot.

390
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:10,340
I want to go home.

391
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:14,340
I'm sorry.

392
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:20,340
Tell me.

393
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:22,340
I'm sorry.

394
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:36,340
What do you want?

395
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:38,340
It's a secret.

396
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:40,340
What about Minato?

397
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:42,340
It's a secret.

398
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:44,340
Show me.

399
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:52,340
I'm sorry.

400
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:56,340
I'm sorry.

401
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:58,340
Are you okay?

402
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:00,340
I'm sorry.

403
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:02,340
I'm sorry.

404
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:22,340
Minato said he liked this scent.

405
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:27,340
I liked this scent because of you.

406
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:30,340
I see.

407
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:34,340
When I was a kid,

408
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:38,340
I had a lot of flowers around my house.

409
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:41,340
So when I smell this,

410
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:45,340
I remember when I was happy.

411
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:53,340
Let's make a lot of happy memories from now on.

412
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:01,340
Minato, do you remember?

413
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:08,340
I asked you to play the song you made on your birthday.

414
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:10,340
I remember.

415
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:17,340
So play the song you made on your birthday.

416
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:21,340
I want to hear it in the sea in Okinawa.

417
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:23,340
In four years.

418
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:27,340
I'll do my best.

419
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:37,340
I promise.

420
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:56,340
I'm going home late today.

421
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:59,340
You have a lot of work to do every day.

422
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:01,340
Don't overdo it.

423
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:02,340
Yeah.

424
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:03,340
Good luck with your life.

425
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:04,340
See you.

426
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:06,340
I'm going.

427
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:12,340
That's all for the Leap Days MV.

428
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:14,340
Thank you for your hard work.

429
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:16,340
Thank you.

430
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:21,340
Thank you.

431
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:23,340
Thank you.

432
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:25,340
Thank you.

433
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:31,340
I'm leaving soon.

434
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:33,340
Are you ready for the recording next month?

435
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:34,340
Yes.

436
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:37,340
I'll check the draft for the draft for the draft.

437
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:38,340
Can you check it tomorrow?

438
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:39,340
Yes.

439
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:54,340
You're writing your own lyrics.

440
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:56,340
I'm thinking of you.

441
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:57,340
Wait.

442
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:59,340
This has nothing to do with work.

443
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:02,340
I promised my girlfriend.

444
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:05,340
I'm going to make a song by the next year.

445
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:07,340
Year of the Ox?

446
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:08,340
Yes.

447
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:11,340
You're a romanticist.

448
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:12,340
Show me.

449
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:13,340
No, no.

450
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:14,340
Please.

451
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:15,340
It's okay.

452
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:16,340
Please go home.

453
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:18,340
I know.

454
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:20,340
Don't get too worked up.

455
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:21,340
See you.

456
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:23,340
Good luck.

457
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:52,340
We love each other

458
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:54,340
Yes.

459
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:57,340
Unlike before we saved each other

460
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:59,340
We were upset

461
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:01,340
Cut it here.

462
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:04,340
It seems to be perfect.

463
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:07,340
The worst condition this is.

464
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:11,340
We can talk to each other about it.

465
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:15,340
We need to adjust.

466
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:16,340
Good.

467
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:17,340
Yes.

468
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:18,340
Let me know when to stop.

469
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:19,340
Nice so far.

470
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:50,340
I'm home.

471
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:52,340
Welcome home.

472
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:54,340
You're late again today.

473
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:56,340
I'll get you some food.

474
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:58,340
Thanks.

475
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:00,340
I'm sorry.

476
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:02,340
I'm sorry.

477
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:04,340
I'm sorry.

478
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:06,340
I'm sorry.

479
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:08,340
I'm sorry.

480
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:10,340
I'm sorry.

481
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:12,340
I'm sorry.

482
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:14,340
I'm sorry.

483
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:16,340
I'm sorry.

484
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:18,340
I'm sorry.

485
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:20,340
I'm sorry.

486
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:33,340
How's your job?

487
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:39,340
I failed the last interview I got.

488
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:45,340
I've destroyed all the companies in Tokyo.

489
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:47,340
I see.

490
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:51,340
I'm sorry, but I can't help it.

491
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:56,340
I'll think about other things, not just the company.

492
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:04,340
But you've been studying hard to become an interpreter.

493
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:07,340
Can you give up?

494
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:14,340
But I failed the last interview, so I can't help it.

495
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:16,340
That's true.

496
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:18,340
It's hard to study in the ice age.

497
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:20,340
It's different from Minato.

498
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:24,340
I'm sorry.

499
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:29,340
I'm sorry, too.

500
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:31,340
I'll go take a bath.

501
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:48,340
Are you ready for next week?

502
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:50,340
Yes, the staff is ready.

503
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:51,340
Thank you.

504
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:17,340
I'm sorry.

505
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:40,340
Minato.

506
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:43,340
Long time no see.

507
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:44,340
Kasumi?

508
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:49,340
Why are you here?

509
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:54,340
Actually, I was called by the staff at Minato's company.

510
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:55,340
Really?

511
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:59,340
Yes, I wanted to surprise Minato, so I kept it a secret.

512
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:01,340
That's great. Congratulations.

513
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:05,340
I haven't made my debut yet.

514
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:10,340
But I'll do my best to work with Minato someday.

515
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:11,340
I'm sorry.

516
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:19,340
Are you tired? You must be busy.

517
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:21,340
I just lack sleep.

518
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:41,340
I'm sorry.

519
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:04,340
Yes?

520
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:12,340
Ryusei?

521
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:14,340
Long time no see.

522
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:18,340
I was surprised.

523
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:20,340
You came all of a sudden.

524
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:23,340
My cousin's wedding is in Tokyo.

525
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:26,340
I was wondering if I could see you.

526
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:29,340
You didn't come back at the end of the year, did you?

527
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:34,340
I was worried about you and your parents.

528
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:36,340
You're going to investigate?

529
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:38,340
Well, that's...

530
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:43,340
I'm done.

531
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:44,340
Thank you.

532
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:49,340
How was your week?

533
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:51,340
It was great.

534
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:55,340
But Minato was cheering for me.

535
00:44:57,340 --> 00:44:59,340
You're getting along well.

536
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:00,340
I was surprised.

537
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:02,340
You were so quick to shake me off.

538
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:04,340
I thought you'd come back crying.

539
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:05,340
You're rude.

540
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:12,340
I'm sorry.

541
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:16,340
My parents...

542
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:22,340
They wanted me to come back to Okinawa after I graduated.

543
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:27,340
They asked me to tell them.

544
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:37,340
Well, I'll do what I want.

545
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:39,340
It's my life.

546
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:42,340
I'll tell you, but I'm on your side.

547
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:46,340
Thank you, Ryusei.

548
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:52,340
I want to be with Minato.

549
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:57,340
I want to see more of Minato's scenery.

550
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:03,340
So I want to do my best here.

551
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:05,340
I see.

552
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:16,340
-"O' diye."

553
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:41,340
Minato, you're late.

554
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:43,340
I didn't call you, so I was worried.

555
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:45,340
Sorry.

556
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:48,340
I had some work problems.

557
00:46:54,340 --> 00:46:55,340
What's wrong with this?

558
00:46:56,340 --> 00:47:00,340
Ryusei came over today and brought me some souvenirs.

559
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:02,340
I'm sorry.

560
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:04,340
I'm sorry.

561
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:06,340
I'm sorry.

562
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:08,340
He came over today and brought me some souvenirs.

563
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:11,340
He said he was in Tokyo for his cousin's wedding.

564
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:13,340
He came over?

565
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:16,340
He gave me some souvenirs and left right away.

566
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:22,340
Do you want some, Minato?

567
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:26,340
It's been a while since I've had a Sataan-dagi from Ryusei.

568
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:31,340
What's the harvest?

569
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:32,340
I've received a lot of things.

570
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:35,340
There are a lot of companies in Tokyo.

571
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:38,340
What about the job of a translator?

572
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:43,340
You saw the job of a translator in Okinawa, right?

573
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:46,340
Yeah.

574
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:49,340
But it's okay now.

575
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:51,340
I've decided.

576
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:54,340
You've decided?

577
00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:04,340
You've always wanted to be a translator since you were little.

578
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:07,340
That's all you wanted to be.

579
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:10,340
I was serious about it.

580
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:17,340
But besides dreams, I have a life that's important.

581
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:25,340
It's my dream to continue living my life.

582
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:26,340
But...

583
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:31,340
You're saying you want to continue living your life?

584
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:34,340
How long are you going to keep saying that?

585
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:38,340
It's your future. Think about it.

586
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:40,340
I'm thinking about it.

587
00:48:41,340 --> 00:48:43,340
I'm also thinking about it.

588
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:49,340
But I want to be with you forever.

589
00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:51,340
So...

590
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:58,340
I don't want to be with you forever.

591
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:14,340
I'm going out for a bit.

592
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:17,340
I'll go to bed first.

593
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:27,340
I'm going to bed.

594
00:49:55,340 --> 00:49:56,340
I'm going to bed.

595
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:15,340
Miyu.

596
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:20,340
I'm going to finish early tonight.

597
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:22,340
Why don't we go out for dinner?

598
00:50:25,340 --> 00:50:26,340
Okay.

599
00:50:44,340 --> 00:50:46,340
We're going to the port today.

600
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:49,340
It's pretty close to the port company.

601
00:50:50,340 --> 00:50:54,340
So if you're okay with it, you can move closer to the company.

602
00:50:55,340 --> 00:50:56,340
You're right.

603
00:50:58,340 --> 00:51:00,340
I don't know if I'll get it or not.

604
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:08,340
Miyu.

605
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:10,340
What?

606
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:13,340
Nothing.

607
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:15,340
What?

608
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:17,340
I thought you always eat deliciously.

609
00:51:18,340 --> 00:51:19,340
It's delicious.

610
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:21,340
I see.

611
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:25,340
If I'm with you, everything is delicious.

612
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:31,340
It was delicious.

613
00:51:32,340 --> 00:51:34,340
It's been a while since we had dinner together.

614
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:42,340
I'm sorry.

615
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:48,340
I work every day and it's late at night.

616
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:52,340
I can't take you to work.

617
00:51:53,340 --> 00:51:55,340
I'm busy with work.

618
00:51:56,340 --> 00:52:00,340
I'm sorry about the other day.

619
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:05,340
I left everything at home.

620
00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:10,340
I couldn't go on a trip.

621
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:17,340
Next time you get a job, you can take a week off and go on a trip.

622
00:52:18,340 --> 00:52:20,340
How about going abroad?

623
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:22,340
I'm sorry.

624
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:25,340
It's okay.

625
00:52:33,340 --> 00:52:34,340
Minato?

626
00:52:35,340 --> 00:52:36,340
What's wrong?

627
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:41,340
Miyu.

628
00:52:42,340 --> 00:52:43,340
I...

629
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:52,340
I can't be with you anymore.

630
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:56,340
What?

631
00:52:58,340 --> 00:52:59,340
Let's break up.

632
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:03,340
Why?

633
00:53:05,340 --> 00:53:06,340
I'm sorry.

634
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:10,340
I don't know.

635
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:15,340
I can't do anything for you.

636
00:53:16,340 --> 00:53:17,340
That's not true.

637
00:53:19,340 --> 00:53:20,340
No.

638
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:23,340
I don't want to.

639
00:53:24,340 --> 00:53:25,340
Why?

640
00:53:28,340 --> 00:53:29,340
Please break up.

641
00:53:33,340 --> 00:53:34,340
Please.

642
00:53:49,340 --> 00:53:50,340
I'm sorry.

643
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:53,340
I'm sorry.

644
00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:55,340
I'm sorry.

645
00:53:57,340 --> 00:53:58,340
I'm sorry.

646
00:53:59,340 --> 00:54:00,340
I'm sorry.

647
00:54:18,340 --> 00:54:19,340
I'm sorry.

648
00:54:49,340 --> 00:54:50,340
I'm sorry.

649
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:52,340
I'm sorry.

650
00:54:53,340 --> 00:54:54,340
I'm sorry.

651
00:54:55,340 --> 00:54:56,340
I'm sorry.

652
00:54:57,340 --> 00:54:58,340
I'm sorry.

653
00:54:59,340 --> 00:55:00,340
I'm sorry.

654
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:02,340
I'm sorry.

655
00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:04,340
I'm sorry.

656
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:06,340
I'm sorry.

657
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:08,340
I'm sorry.

658
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:10,340
I'm sorry.

659
00:55:11,340 --> 00:55:12,340
I'm sorry.

660
00:55:13,340 --> 00:55:14,340
I'm sorry.

661
00:55:15,340 --> 00:55:16,340
I'm sorry.

662
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:17,340
I'm sorry.

663
00:55:18,340 --> 00:55:19,340
I'm sorry.

664
00:55:20,340 --> 00:55:21,340
I'm sorry.

665
00:55:22,340 --> 00:55:23,340
I'm sorry.

666
00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:25,340
I'm sorry.

667
00:55:26,340 --> 00:55:27,340
I'm sorry.

668
00:55:28,340 --> 00:55:29,340
I'm sorry.

669
00:55:30,340 --> 00:55:31,340
I'm sorry.

670
00:55:32,340 --> 00:55:33,340
I'm sorry.

671
00:55:34,340 --> 00:55:35,340
I'm sorry.

672
00:55:36,340 --> 00:55:37,340
I'm sorry.

673
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:39,340
I'm sorry.

674
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:41,340
I'm sorry.

675
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:43,340
I'm sorry.

676
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:45,340
I'm sorry.

677
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:47,340
I'm sorry.

678
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:13,340
Mio.

679
00:56:16,340 --> 00:56:17,340
I'm sorry.

680
00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:24,340
I'm sorry for calling you so many times.

681
00:56:30,340 --> 00:56:33,340
This is the luggage in the room.

682
00:56:36,340 --> 00:56:38,340
I said you could throw it away.

683
00:56:43,340 --> 00:56:45,340
I have something to tell you.

684
00:56:46,340 --> 00:56:47,340
What is it?

685
00:56:51,340 --> 00:56:52,340
I...

686
00:56:52,340 --> 00:56:53,340
I...

687
00:57:15,340 --> 00:57:16,340
This...

688
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:24,340
I can't accept it.

689
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:31,340
I don't like you anymore.

690
00:57:34,340 --> 00:57:36,340
I don't want to see you anymore.

691
00:57:40,340 --> 00:57:42,340
Forget about me.

692
00:57:52,340 --> 00:57:53,340
I'm sorry.

693
00:58:23,340 --> 00:58:24,340
I'm sorry.

694
00:58:48,340 --> 00:58:49,340
I want to go home.

695
00:58:52,340 --> 00:58:53,340
I want to go home.

696
00:59:01,340 --> 00:59:02,340
Mom.

697
00:59:07,340 --> 00:59:08,340
Kotaro.

698
00:59:10,340 --> 00:59:12,340
Why are you here?

699
00:59:16,340 --> 00:59:17,340
Kotaro.

700
00:59:18,340 --> 00:59:19,340
Why?

701
00:59:23,340 --> 00:59:25,340
I like you.

702
00:59:27,340 --> 00:59:28,340
What?

703
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:40,340
I followed you because I was worried about you.

704
00:59:42,340 --> 00:59:44,340
You were always near me?

705
00:59:45,340 --> 00:59:48,340
I was watching you to save you.

706
00:59:49,340 --> 00:59:50,340
What is that?

707
00:59:52,340 --> 00:59:54,340
You should have called me from the beginning.

708
00:59:57,340 --> 01:00:01,340
I don't know the way to Tokyo anymore.

709
01:00:03,340 --> 01:00:04,340
I don't like it anymore.

710
01:00:05,340 --> 01:00:07,340
I want to go back to Okinawa.

711
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:15,340
But you asked me to do something important to you.

712
01:00:17,340 --> 01:00:19,340
What are you doing?

713
01:00:23,340 --> 01:00:24,340
I don't know.

714
01:00:29,340 --> 01:00:30,340
What is this?

715
01:00:43,340 --> 01:00:44,340
What's wrong?

716
01:00:53,340 --> 01:00:54,340
What's wrong?

717
01:00:55,340 --> 01:00:56,340
What's wrong?

718
01:00:57,340 --> 01:00:58,340
What's wrong?

719
01:00:59,340 --> 01:01:00,340
What's wrong?

720
01:01:01,340 --> 01:01:02,340
What's wrong?

721
01:01:03,340 --> 01:01:04,340
What's wrong?

722
01:01:05,340 --> 01:01:06,340
What's wrong?

723
01:01:07,340 --> 01:01:08,340
What's wrong?

724
01:01:09,340 --> 01:01:10,340
What's wrong?

725
01:01:11,340 --> 01:01:12,340
What's wrong?

726
01:01:13,340 --> 01:01:14,340
What's wrong?

727
01:01:15,340 --> 01:01:16,340
What's wrong?

728
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:18,340
What's wrong?

729
01:01:19,340 --> 01:01:20,340
What's wrong?

730
01:01:20,340 --> 01:01:21,340
What's wrong?

731
01:01:22,340 --> 01:01:23,340
What's wrong?

732
01:01:24,340 --> 01:01:25,340
What's wrong?

733
01:01:26,340 --> 01:01:27,340
What's wrong?

734
01:01:28,340 --> 01:01:29,340
What's wrong?

735
01:01:30,340 --> 01:01:31,340
What's wrong?

736
01:01:32,340 --> 01:01:33,340
What's wrong?

737
01:01:34,340 --> 01:01:35,340
What's wrong?

738
01:01:36,340 --> 01:01:37,340
What's wrong?

739
01:01:38,340 --> 01:01:39,340
What's wrong?

740
01:01:40,340 --> 01:01:41,340
What's wrong?

741
01:01:42,340 --> 01:01:43,340
What's wrong?

742
01:01:44,340 --> 01:01:45,340
What's wrong?

743
01:01:46,340 --> 01:01:47,340
What's wrong?

744
01:01:48,340 --> 01:01:49,340
What's wrong?

745
01:01:50,340 --> 01:01:51,340
What's wrong?

746
01:02:16,340 --> 01:02:17,340
Mie!

747
01:02:17,340 --> 01:02:18,340
Mie!

748
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:21,340
Mie?

749
01:02:27,340 --> 01:02:28,340
Welcome back.

750
01:02:28,340 --> 01:02:30,340
I heard you were coming home today.

751
01:02:31,340 --> 01:02:32,340
I'm home.

752
01:02:33,340 --> 01:02:34,340
Here, hold this.

753
01:02:40,340 --> 01:02:41,340
This...

754
01:02:41,340 --> 01:02:43,340
Why didn't you tell Minato?

755
01:02:47,340 --> 01:02:50,340
You should've told him you broke up.

756
01:02:52,340 --> 01:02:57,340
I feel bad for him, even though he doesn't feel like it anymore.

757
01:02:58,340 --> 01:03:00,340
You can't say that.

758
01:03:01,340 --> 01:03:02,340
What are you going to do?

759
01:03:06,340 --> 01:03:07,340
I'm going to tell him.

760
01:03:08,340 --> 01:03:09,340
I'm going to tell him.

761
01:03:10,340 --> 01:03:11,340
I...

762
01:03:12,340 --> 01:03:14,340
I didn't do well during the school break.

763
01:03:15,340 --> 01:03:19,340
I thought I'd give up on my dream of being a translator.

764
01:03:21,340 --> 01:03:25,340
I thought it'd be nice if I could be by Minato's side.

765
01:03:29,340 --> 01:03:33,340
That's why Minato gave me a hug.

766
01:03:33,340 --> 01:03:35,340
I was so touched.

767
01:03:38,340 --> 01:03:39,340
But...

768
01:03:40,340 --> 01:03:42,340
I had a baby in my belly.

769
01:03:44,340 --> 01:03:46,340
At first, I was completely white.

770
01:03:53,340 --> 01:03:57,340
I wanted to give birth to this baby.

771
01:03:57,340 --> 01:04:00,340
I thought I'd give up on my dream of being a translator.

772
01:04:03,340 --> 01:04:09,340
I wanted to be cool like my mother did when I was little.

773
01:04:10,340 --> 01:04:14,340
I wanted to make her look cool.

774
01:04:27,340 --> 01:04:28,340
I'm sorry.

775
01:04:30,340 --> 01:04:33,340
But I want to give birth.

776
01:04:35,340 --> 01:04:36,340
You want to give birth?

777
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:38,340
What about college?

778
01:04:39,340 --> 01:04:40,340
What are you going to do?

779
01:04:41,340 --> 01:04:42,340
I'm going to graduate from college.

780
01:04:43,340 --> 01:04:44,340
I'm going to look for a job.

781
01:04:45,340 --> 01:04:46,340
So...

782
01:04:47,340 --> 01:04:48,340
Please!

783
01:04:50,340 --> 01:04:51,340
Who are you to me?

784
01:04:58,340 --> 01:04:59,340
I'm sorry!

785
01:05:00,340 --> 01:05:01,340
It's me!

786
01:05:02,340 --> 01:05:03,340
Ryusei?

787
01:05:04,340 --> 01:05:05,340
What?

788
01:05:05,340 --> 01:05:06,340
It's me!

789
01:05:07,340 --> 01:05:08,340
It's my baby.

790
01:05:12,340 --> 01:05:14,340
I have her in my womb.

791
01:05:15,340 --> 01:05:16,340
So...

792
01:05:17,340 --> 01:05:18,340
Please!

793
01:05:23,340 --> 01:05:24,340
Dad!

794
01:05:25,340 --> 01:05:26,340
Dad!

795
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:28,340
Dad!

796
01:05:33,340 --> 01:05:35,340
What were you going to do?

797
01:05:36,340 --> 01:05:37,340
I'm sorry.

798
01:05:37,340 --> 01:05:38,340
I was surprised.

799
01:05:39,340 --> 01:05:40,340
Stop joking around.

800
01:05:42,340 --> 01:05:43,340
I'm not joking.

801
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:45,340
I'm serious.

802
01:05:51,340 --> 01:05:53,340
I wanted to give up on my dream many times.

803
01:05:54,340 --> 01:05:55,340
But I couldn't.

804
01:05:57,340 --> 01:05:58,340
I...

805
01:05:59,340 --> 01:06:01,340
I've always liked you.

806
01:06:02,340 --> 01:06:03,340
What?

807
01:06:06,340 --> 01:06:07,340
You didn't notice.

808
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:10,340
You're really stubborn.

809
01:06:13,340 --> 01:06:14,340
I'm sorry.

810
01:06:16,340 --> 01:06:18,340
I didn't want to say it for the rest of my life.

811
01:06:20,340 --> 01:06:21,340
But...

812
01:06:22,340 --> 01:06:24,340
I heard that you wanted to do your best.

813
01:06:24,340 --> 01:06:27,340
I wanted to support you by your side.

814
01:06:29,340 --> 01:06:32,340
I wanted to raise you and your child together.

815
01:06:38,340 --> 01:06:39,340
I'm sorry, Ryusei.

816
01:06:41,340 --> 01:06:44,340
I don't want to marry anyone.

817
01:06:47,340 --> 01:06:51,340
Do you still like Minato?

818
01:06:54,340 --> 01:06:55,340
I don't know.

819
01:07:01,340 --> 01:07:02,340
But it's okay.

820
01:07:03,340 --> 01:07:04,340
Let me be by your side.

821
01:07:07,340 --> 01:07:09,340
I don't know what's going to happen next.

822
01:07:10,340 --> 01:07:13,340
Maybe Minu will be my second wife.

823
01:07:15,340 --> 01:07:16,340
Second wife?

824
01:07:16,340 --> 01:07:17,340
What?

825
01:07:23,340 --> 01:07:25,340
That's how Minu laughs.

826
01:07:30,340 --> 01:07:31,340
See you.

827
01:07:46,340 --> 01:07:48,340
Minato's House

828
01:08:02,340 --> 01:08:03,340
Minato.

829
01:08:05,340 --> 01:08:06,340
I brought you some food.

830
01:08:10,340 --> 01:08:13,340
This is for you.

831
01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:15,340
Thank you.

832
01:08:16,340 --> 01:08:17,340
You look like a demon.

833
01:08:30,340 --> 01:08:36,340
I heard from a circle's junior that you're going back to Okinawa after graduation.

834
01:08:39,340 --> 01:08:40,340
I see.

835
01:08:40,340 --> 01:08:41,340
I'll go.

836
01:08:44,340 --> 01:08:46,340
If you need anything else, just let me know.

837
01:08:47,340 --> 01:08:50,340
I'll come to see you so you won't be lonely.

838
01:08:52,340 --> 01:08:53,340
You must be busy.

839
01:08:55,340 --> 01:08:56,340
You can take care of me.

840
01:08:57,340 --> 01:08:58,340
Do your best at work.

841
01:09:00,340 --> 01:09:02,340
I'm looking forward to your debut.

842
01:09:06,340 --> 01:09:07,340
What's that?

843
01:09:08,340 --> 01:09:11,340
Let's get better soon and make our dreams come true.

844
01:09:12,340 --> 01:09:16,340
I'll wait for you forever until Minato comes back.

845
01:09:27,340 --> 01:09:29,340
Tell me to wait.

846
01:09:37,340 --> 01:09:39,340
Minato's House

847
01:10:00,340 --> 01:10:01,340
What are you listening to?

848
01:10:07,340 --> 01:10:08,340
Here.

849
01:10:08,340 --> 01:10:09,340
Thank you.

850
01:10:28,340 --> 01:10:33,340
I haven't seen Minato's smiling face in a long time.

851
01:10:34,340 --> 01:10:35,340
I'm sorry.

852
01:10:36,340 --> 01:10:38,340
I made Minato alone.

853
01:10:40,340 --> 01:10:42,340
I made him feel bad.

854
01:10:45,340 --> 01:10:46,340
What are you talking about?

855
01:10:49,340 --> 01:10:50,340
Mom.

856
01:10:51,340 --> 01:10:52,340
I'm sorry.

857
01:10:53,340 --> 01:10:54,340
I'm sorry.

858
01:10:55,340 --> 01:10:56,340
I'm sorry.

859
01:10:57,340 --> 01:10:58,340
I'm sorry.

860
01:10:59,340 --> 01:11:00,340
I'm sorry.

861
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:02,340
Mom.

862
01:11:03,340 --> 01:11:06,340
I want you to keep smiling at Minato.

863
01:11:10,340 --> 01:11:11,340
That's okay.

864
01:11:16,340 --> 01:11:22,340
I'm looking forward to listening to Minato's song.

865
01:11:31,340 --> 01:11:32,340
Mom.

866
01:11:33,340 --> 01:11:34,340
I'm sorry.

867
01:11:35,340 --> 01:11:36,340
I'm sorry.

868
01:11:37,340 --> 01:11:38,340
I'm sorry.

869
01:11:39,340 --> 01:11:40,340
I'm sorry.

870
01:11:41,340 --> 01:11:42,340
I'm sorry.

871
01:11:43,340 --> 01:11:44,340
I'm sorry.

872
01:11:45,340 --> 01:11:46,340
I'm sorry.

873
01:11:47,340 --> 01:11:48,340
I'm sorry.

874
01:11:49,340 --> 01:11:50,340
I'm sorry.

875
01:11:51,340 --> 01:11:52,340
I'm sorry.

876
01:11:53,340 --> 01:11:54,340
I'm sorry.

877
01:11:55,340 --> 01:11:56,340
I'm sorry.

878
01:11:57,340 --> 01:11:58,340
I'm sorry.

879
01:11:58,340 --> 01:11:59,340
I'm sorry.

880
01:12:03,340 --> 01:12:09,340
After my mom died, everything became better.

881
01:12:12,340 --> 01:12:17,340
I didn't want to think about my future.

882
01:12:19,340 --> 01:12:21,340
I didn't enjoy doing anything.

883
01:12:22,340 --> 01:12:24,340
I didn't enjoy eating anything.

884
01:12:25,340 --> 01:12:29,340
This is the best sartan daki in the world.

885
01:12:33,340 --> 01:12:37,340
It's been a while since I tasted it.

886
01:12:40,340 --> 01:12:42,340
I thought it was a delicious person.

887
01:12:45,340 --> 01:12:49,340
I liked his face when he listened to music.

888
01:12:50,340 --> 01:12:53,340
Minato can go anywhere.

889
01:12:54,340 --> 01:12:55,340
He can be anything.

890
01:12:56,340 --> 01:12:58,340
My mom's words pushed me back.

891
01:12:59,340 --> 01:13:01,340
I want to listen to Minato's song someday.

892
01:13:03,340 --> 01:13:06,340
He gave me a dream again.

893
01:13:10,340 --> 01:13:16,340
I wished that this happy day would continue forever.

894
01:13:16,340 --> 01:13:19,340
I really wanted that.

895
01:13:21,340 --> 01:13:22,340
But...

896
01:13:28,340 --> 01:13:30,340
It's acute bone marrow disease.

897
01:13:31,340 --> 01:13:35,340
I'll get you a hospitalization right away, so please get hospitalized today.

898
01:13:36,340 --> 01:13:37,340
Please contact your family.

899
01:13:38,340 --> 01:13:39,340
Wait.

900
01:13:41,340 --> 01:13:43,340
Even if you suddenly say that...

901
01:13:46,340 --> 01:13:47,340
Why me?

902
01:13:48,340 --> 01:13:50,340
I finally got happiness.

903
01:13:55,340 --> 01:14:03,340
If I talk to you, I'll sacrifice everything and be by your side.

904
01:14:04,340 --> 01:14:05,340
I don't have a heart.

905
01:14:08,340 --> 01:14:13,340
If I stay with you like this, I'll be able to fulfill your dream.

906
01:14:16,340 --> 01:14:17,340
I don't want to do that.

907
01:14:28,340 --> 01:14:29,340
But...

908
01:14:31,340 --> 01:14:32,340
I don't want to leave you.

909
01:14:34,340 --> 01:14:39,340
I wanted you to be by my side more than anyone else.

910
01:14:41,340 --> 01:14:42,340
Miu...

911
01:14:42,340 --> 01:14:43,340
What?

912
01:14:46,340 --> 01:14:47,340
Nothing.

913
01:14:48,340 --> 01:14:49,340
What?

914
01:14:49,340 --> 01:14:52,340
I tried to tell you about my illness many times.

915
01:14:53,340 --> 01:14:54,340
But...

916
01:14:56,340 --> 01:15:00,340
I wanted to see your smile, so I couldn't say it.

917
01:15:01,340 --> 01:15:02,340
Please leave.

918
01:15:07,340 --> 01:15:09,340
I want to see you.

919
01:15:12,340 --> 01:15:16,340
After all, I was afraid to involve Miu.

920
01:15:19,340 --> 01:15:20,340
So I ran away.

921
01:15:42,340 --> 01:15:45,340
To be continued...

922
01:16:12,340 --> 01:16:15,340
To be continued...

923
01:16:42,340 --> 01:16:44,340
To be continued...

924
01:16:50,340 --> 01:16:51,340
Hey.

925
01:16:51,340 --> 01:16:53,340
The weather is nice today.

926
01:16:54,340 --> 01:16:56,340
Ryota-san, what about work?

927
01:16:56,340 --> 01:16:59,340
I'm working as a subordinate. I keep it a secret from the chief.

928
01:17:01,340 --> 01:17:04,340
I'm sorry to have bothered you with so many things.

929
01:17:05,340 --> 01:17:07,340
No one's bothering you.

930
01:17:07,340 --> 01:17:09,340
Don't worry about work.

931
01:17:09,340 --> 01:17:12,340
Just go back to work and get well.

932
01:17:14,340 --> 01:17:15,340
Oh, right.

933
01:17:17,340 --> 01:17:20,340
This is the company's file.

934
01:17:21,340 --> 01:17:23,340
It's important, isn't it?

935
01:17:24,340 --> 01:17:25,340
What was it?

936
01:17:25,340 --> 01:17:27,340
The promise of the old man?

937
01:17:29,340 --> 01:17:30,340
It's okay.

938
01:17:32,340 --> 01:17:34,340
It's over.

939
01:17:38,340 --> 01:17:40,340
Don't you regret it?

940
01:17:43,340 --> 01:17:45,340
Why did you break up with her?

941
01:17:46,340 --> 01:17:48,340
She was important to you, wasn't she?

942
01:17:51,340 --> 01:17:53,340
Because she's important.

943
01:17:54,340 --> 01:17:56,340
She's really important to me.

944
01:17:57,340 --> 01:17:59,340
I want her to be happy.

945
01:18:01,340 --> 01:18:03,340
Minato is strong.

946
01:18:03,340 --> 01:18:04,340
Minato...

947
01:18:06,340 --> 01:18:08,340
It's not like that.

948
01:18:09,340 --> 01:18:11,340
I wasn't prepared at all.

949
01:18:13,340 --> 01:18:15,340
Every time I think I'm going to die like this,

950
01:18:16,340 --> 01:18:18,340
Myu's face is floating.

951
01:18:22,340 --> 01:18:25,340
Minato, you said when you came in.

952
01:18:27,340 --> 01:18:29,340
I was saved by music.

953
01:18:29,340 --> 01:18:31,340
I was saved by music.

954
01:18:32,340 --> 01:18:36,340
So I want to be the one who makes that kind of music someday.

955
01:18:42,340 --> 01:18:45,340
There's someone waiting for you to make a song, right?

956
01:18:55,340 --> 01:18:57,340
I'm sorry.

957
01:18:59,340 --> 01:19:01,340
I'm sorry.

958
01:19:10,340 --> 01:19:13,340
Let's go to the coach tomorrow for the inspection.

959
01:19:13,340 --> 01:19:15,340
So we can do the inspection tomorrow,

960
01:19:15,340 --> 01:19:19,340
and you can gradually start thinking about which place you like to take.

961
01:19:19,340 --> 01:19:20,340
Sure.

962
01:19:20,340 --> 01:19:24,340
Each place is so beautiful, it really makes it hard to make a decision.

963
01:19:24,340 --> 01:19:27,340
But we need to build our hotel in the best location.

964
01:19:43,340 --> 01:19:45,340
I'm sorry.

965
01:19:57,340 --> 01:19:58,340
Hi.

966
01:19:58,340 --> 01:20:00,340
Ryusei?

967
01:20:06,340 --> 01:20:08,340
How's work?

968
01:20:08,340 --> 01:20:10,340
Are you doing okay?

969
01:20:10,340 --> 01:20:12,340
Not yet.

970
01:20:12,340 --> 01:20:14,340
I have to work harder.

971
01:20:15,340 --> 01:20:18,340
Myu's parents were worried about her.

972
01:20:19,340 --> 01:20:23,340
She tried her best to take care of Himari and work.

973
01:20:24,340 --> 01:20:26,340
She said she might collapse.

974
01:20:27,340 --> 01:20:29,340
It's okay.

975
01:20:29,340 --> 01:20:31,340
You're worried.

976
01:20:31,340 --> 01:20:33,340
I'm sorry.

977
01:20:38,340 --> 01:20:41,340
Did you keep in touch with Minato?

978
01:20:43,340 --> 01:20:45,340
No.

979
01:20:46,340 --> 01:20:49,340
I haven't been in touch with him.

980
01:20:51,340 --> 01:20:55,340
I don't know where he is right now,

981
01:20:57,340 --> 01:20:59,340
but I hope he's doing well.

982
01:21:02,340 --> 01:21:08,340
Minato took me to the far end of the sea.

983
01:21:11,340 --> 01:21:13,340
I couldn't go alone.

984
01:21:15,340 --> 01:21:17,340
I see.

985
01:21:18,340 --> 01:21:20,340
Did you have fun?

986
01:21:22,340 --> 01:21:24,340
Yes.

987
01:21:26,340 --> 01:21:28,340
I had a lot of fun.

988
01:21:31,340 --> 01:21:33,340
I'm sorry.

989
01:21:51,340 --> 01:21:53,340
This is for you.

990
01:21:53,340 --> 01:21:55,340
Don't complain.

991
01:22:01,340 --> 01:22:03,340
I'm sorry.

992
01:22:32,340 --> 01:22:34,340
Don't cry.

993
01:22:34,340 --> 01:22:36,340
You'll be tired.

994
01:22:37,340 --> 01:22:39,340
I'm not crying.

995
01:22:41,340 --> 01:22:44,340
Myu, look.

996
01:22:45,340 --> 01:22:53,340
You and Himari will have a long life.

997
01:23:01,340 --> 01:23:03,340
I'm sorry.

998
01:23:31,340 --> 01:23:33,340
Minato

999
01:23:40,340 --> 01:23:42,340
How's the preparation going?

1000
01:23:42,340 --> 01:23:44,340
I'll be right there.

1001
01:23:49,340 --> 01:23:51,340
Congratulations!

1002
01:23:53,340 --> 01:23:55,340
Why?

1003
01:23:55,340 --> 01:23:57,340
I'm happy.

1004
01:24:01,340 --> 01:24:04,340
It's been a long time since I laughed so much.

1005
01:24:04,340 --> 01:24:06,340
Ryota was happy.

1006
01:24:06,340 --> 01:24:10,340
He was waiting for Minato to come back to the company.

1007
01:24:12,340 --> 01:24:14,340
Kasumi is finally making her debut.

1008
01:24:14,340 --> 01:24:16,340
It's amazing.

1009
01:24:16,340 --> 01:24:18,340
It's not over yet.

1010
01:24:18,340 --> 01:24:23,340
I'm excited to see what the future holds.

1011
01:24:25,340 --> 01:24:27,340
I'm looking forward to it.

1012
01:24:28,340 --> 01:24:32,340
I'm glad you're okay.

1013
01:24:32,340 --> 01:24:35,340
You've done a great job for the past three years.

1014
01:24:35,340 --> 01:24:37,340
Thank you.

1015
01:24:37,340 --> 01:24:40,340
I'm really grateful to you.

1016
01:24:45,340 --> 01:24:54,340
I've always liked you since I was in college.

1017
01:24:54,340 --> 01:24:56,340
I liked you.

1018
01:24:58,340 --> 01:25:00,340
I'm glad.

1019
01:25:00,340 --> 01:25:02,340
It's a past story.

1020
01:25:04,340 --> 01:25:06,340
I didn't notice.

1021
01:25:06,340 --> 01:25:10,340
Minato is very proud.

1022
01:25:10,340 --> 01:25:12,340
He was very good.

1023
01:25:12,340 --> 01:25:15,340
He was the best when he met me.

1024
01:25:15,340 --> 01:25:17,340
He was the best.

1025
01:25:18,340 --> 01:25:24,340
But I loved Minato.

1026
01:25:26,340 --> 01:25:29,340
That's all for now.

1027
01:25:29,340 --> 01:25:32,340
I'll be your best friend.

1028
01:25:34,340 --> 01:25:36,340
Kasumi.

1029
01:25:40,340 --> 01:25:42,340
Thank you.

1030
01:25:42,340 --> 01:25:44,340
I'm sorry.

1031
01:25:48,340 --> 01:25:50,340
It's okay.

1032
01:25:53,340 --> 01:25:55,340
I heard from Ryota.

1033
01:25:55,340 --> 01:25:57,340
About your promise to Ryota.

1034
01:25:59,340 --> 01:26:02,340
You're going to Okinawa tomorrow, right?

1035
01:26:05,340 --> 01:26:09,340
I hope your promise comes true.

1036
01:26:13,340 --> 01:26:15,340
I'm sorry.

1037
01:26:15,340 --> 01:26:17,340
I'm sorry.

1038
01:26:17,340 --> 01:26:19,340
I'm sorry.

1039
01:26:19,340 --> 01:26:21,340
I'm sorry.

1040
01:26:21,340 --> 01:26:23,340
I'm sorry.

1041
01:26:23,340 --> 01:26:25,340
I'm sorry.

1042
01:26:25,340 --> 01:26:27,340
I'm sorry.

1043
01:26:27,340 --> 01:26:29,340
I'm sorry.

1044
01:26:29,340 --> 01:26:31,340
I'm sorry.

1045
01:26:31,340 --> 01:26:33,340
I'm sorry.

1046
01:26:33,340 --> 01:26:35,340
I'm sorry.

1047
01:26:35,340 --> 01:26:37,340
I'm sorry.

1048
01:26:37,340 --> 01:26:39,340
I'm sorry.

1049
01:26:39,340 --> 01:26:41,340
I'm sorry.

1050
01:26:42,340 --> 01:26:44,340
I'm sorry.

1051
01:26:44,340 --> 01:26:46,340
I'm sorry.

1052
01:26:53,340 --> 01:26:55,340
You should eat too.

1053
01:26:55,340 --> 01:26:57,340
Yes.

1054
01:26:59,340 --> 01:27:01,340
Was it good?

1055
01:27:01,340 --> 01:27:03,340
Yes.

1056
01:27:03,340 --> 01:27:05,340
You should eat banana.

1057
01:27:05,340 --> 01:27:07,340
I'll change.

1058
01:27:07,340 --> 01:27:09,340
Thank you.

1059
01:27:09,340 --> 01:27:12,340
Himari, Dad's going to feed you.

1060
01:27:12,340 --> 01:27:15,640
Himachan, let's eat with Dad.

1061
01:27:15,640 --> 01:27:17,140
Yeah, let's eat.

1062
01:27:17,140 --> 01:27:17,940
Okay.

1063
01:27:17,940 --> 01:27:20,540
Oh, did you eat kiwi already?

1064
01:27:20,540 --> 01:27:21,240
Yeah.

1065
01:27:21,240 --> 01:27:23,040
Kiwi.

1066
01:27:23,040 --> 01:27:25,040
It's good.

1067
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:25,840
It's good.

1068
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:27,040
It's good.

1069
01:27:32,440 --> 01:27:33,840
Look at this.

1070
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:35,140
You look just like Himari.

1071
01:27:35,140 --> 01:27:36,140
Really?

1072
01:27:36,140 --> 01:27:37,140
Yeah.

1073
01:27:39,540 --> 01:27:41,940
It smells good.

1074
01:27:41,940 --> 01:27:43,540
It's delicious.

1075
01:27:43,540 --> 01:27:44,540
Yeah.

1076
01:27:46,340 --> 01:27:50,040
I remember that for the past three years,

1077
01:27:50,040 --> 01:27:54,040
Ryusei has always been by my side.

1078
01:27:56,140 --> 01:27:59,340
So I told him

1079
01:27:59,340 --> 01:28:03,540
to become a real family with Ryusei.

1080
01:28:04,240 --> 01:28:07,740
Ryusei said before,

1081
01:28:07,740 --> 01:28:13,740
that he would wait for Miyu for 10 or 20 years.

1082
01:28:13,740 --> 01:28:17,740
He said he would wait for him forever.

1083
01:28:19,740 --> 01:28:23,740
You're so happy.

1084
01:28:23,740 --> 01:28:25,740
I'm so happy.

1085
01:28:31,940 --> 01:28:35,940
Make Ryusei happy.

1086
01:28:39,240 --> 01:28:40,740
Yes.

1087
01:29:53,940 --> 01:29:55,940
Here.

1088
01:29:56,940 --> 01:29:58,940
It smells good.

1089
01:29:58,940 --> 01:29:59,940
Here you go.

1090
01:29:59,940 --> 01:30:01,940
Thank you.

1091
01:30:05,940 --> 01:30:06,940
Ryusei.

1092
01:30:06,940 --> 01:30:07,940
Yeah?

1093
01:30:07,940 --> 01:30:08,940
Can I come in?

1094
01:30:08,940 --> 01:30:10,940
Yeah.

1095
01:30:10,940 --> 01:30:12,940
I'm going to the bathroom.

1096
01:30:12,940 --> 01:30:14,940
Okay.

1097
01:30:14,940 --> 01:30:16,940
I'm going to the bathroom.

1098
01:30:16,940 --> 01:30:18,940
Okay.

1099
01:30:18,940 --> 01:30:20,940
I'm going to the bathroom.

1100
01:30:20,940 --> 01:30:22,940
Okay.

1101
01:30:23,940 --> 01:30:25,940
I've always thought

1102
01:30:25,940 --> 01:30:29,940
I had to thank you.

1103
01:30:29,940 --> 01:30:31,940
What?

1104
01:30:31,940 --> 01:30:33,940
Ryusei.

1105
01:30:36,940 --> 01:30:39,940
Thank you so much.

1106
01:30:39,940 --> 01:30:45,940
For accepting both Miyu and Himari.

1107
01:30:45,940 --> 01:30:47,940
What are you talking about?

1108
01:30:47,940 --> 01:30:50,940
I'm the one who should thank you.

1109
01:30:51,940 --> 01:30:54,940
I'm so happy

1110
01:30:54,940 --> 01:30:58,940
to be Himari's father.

1111
01:31:00,940 --> 01:31:03,940
Ryusei is a good man.

1112
01:31:03,940 --> 01:31:07,940
I know he's going to struggle.

1113
01:31:07,940 --> 01:31:11,940
But I hope you'll take care

1114
01:31:11,940 --> 01:31:14,940
of both Miyu and Himari.

1115
01:31:14,940 --> 01:31:17,940
Please stop, Dad.

1116
01:31:17,940 --> 01:31:19,940
The real thing is tomorrow.

1117
01:31:19,940 --> 01:31:21,940
I see.

1118
01:31:21,940 --> 01:31:24,940
I'm looking forward to tomorrow's wedding.

1119
01:31:24,940 --> 01:31:26,940
Yes.

1120
01:31:26,940 --> 01:31:28,940
See you.

1121
01:31:49,940 --> 01:31:51,940
Why?

1122
01:31:51,940 --> 01:31:53,940
Why now?

1123
01:31:57,940 --> 01:31:59,940
What's going on?

1124
01:31:59,940 --> 01:32:02,940
Are you going to take Miyu again?

1125
01:32:02,940 --> 01:32:03,940
No, I'm not.

1126
01:32:03,940 --> 01:32:06,940
Then why are you here?

1127
01:32:06,940 --> 01:32:08,940
It's just...

1128
01:32:12,940 --> 01:32:14,940
What?

1129
01:32:14,940 --> 01:32:16,940
What's going on?

1130
01:32:17,940 --> 01:32:19,940
What?

1131
01:32:21,940 --> 01:32:23,940
Tell me the truth.

1132
01:32:27,940 --> 01:32:29,940
Miyu.

1133
01:32:29,940 --> 01:32:34,940
You've been going through a lot all by yourself.

1134
01:32:34,940 --> 01:32:36,940
You got pregnant and came back.

1135
01:32:36,940 --> 01:32:38,940
You had a baby.

1136
01:32:38,940 --> 01:32:41,940
You worked hard and raised it.

1137
01:32:41,940 --> 01:32:44,940
You got pregnant and came back?

1138
01:32:46,940 --> 01:32:48,940
No.

1139
01:32:48,940 --> 01:32:51,940
Himari is my...

1140
01:33:01,940 --> 01:33:04,940
Please go home.

1141
01:33:04,940 --> 01:33:06,940
Please.

1142
01:33:16,940 --> 01:33:18,940
I'm sorry.

1143
01:33:18,940 --> 01:33:20,940
I'm sorry.

1144
01:33:20,940 --> 01:33:22,940
I'm sorry.

1145
01:33:43,940 --> 01:33:47,940
The number you have dialed is unavailable.

1146
01:33:48,940 --> 01:33:50,940
Thank you.

1147
01:33:50,940 --> 01:33:52,940
It looks delicious.

1148
01:33:52,940 --> 01:33:54,940
Please eat another one.

1149
01:33:54,940 --> 01:33:56,940
What does it taste like?

1150
01:33:56,940 --> 01:33:57,940
Soda.

1151
01:33:57,940 --> 01:33:58,940
Soda?

1152
01:33:58,940 --> 01:34:00,940
One, two.

1153
01:34:00,940 --> 01:34:01,940
What does it taste like?

1154
01:34:01,940 --> 01:34:02,940
It's delicious.

1155
01:34:02,940 --> 01:34:04,940
Delicious?

1156
01:34:07,940 --> 01:34:10,940
Is Minato back?

1157
01:34:10,940 --> 01:34:13,940
No, he's not back yet.

1158
01:34:17,940 --> 01:34:19,940
Are you okay?

1159
01:34:19,940 --> 01:34:21,940
My baby.

1160
01:34:21,940 --> 01:34:23,940
Thank you for the food.

1161
01:34:47,940 --> 01:34:53,940
I've never felt this way before.

1162
01:34:53,940 --> 01:34:57,940
Sometimes I swear...

1163
01:34:57,940 --> 01:34:59,940
Miyu.

1164
01:34:59,940 --> 01:35:01,940
Miyu.

1165
01:35:05,940 --> 01:35:07,940
I'm home.

1166
01:35:12,940 --> 01:35:14,940
Ryusei?

1167
01:35:14,940 --> 01:35:16,940
What's wrong?

1168
01:35:18,940 --> 01:35:21,940
I'll make you happy.

1169
01:35:42,940 --> 01:35:45,940
You liked this smell, right?

1170
01:35:45,940 --> 01:35:47,940
What?

1171
01:35:47,940 --> 01:35:51,940
I liked this smell.

1172
01:35:51,940 --> 01:35:52,940
What?

1173
01:35:52,940 --> 01:35:53,940
But...

1174
01:35:53,940 --> 01:35:56,940
You said you liked this smell.

1175
01:35:56,940 --> 01:36:01,940
So your parents and everyone around you liked it.

1176
01:36:04,940 --> 01:36:08,940
You can't forget what you like.

1177
01:36:15,940 --> 01:36:18,940
I'm sorry. Please stop.

1178
01:36:45,940 --> 01:36:47,940
Thank you.

1179
01:37:09,940 --> 01:37:11,940
Thank you.

1180
01:37:15,940 --> 01:37:17,940
Thank you.

1181
01:37:45,940 --> 01:37:47,940
Thank you.

1182
01:38:11,940 --> 01:38:13,940
I like it.

1183
01:38:13,940 --> 01:38:15,940
What's wrong?

1184
01:38:16,940 --> 01:38:18,940
Miyu, what's wrong?

1185
01:38:18,940 --> 01:38:20,940
It's you.

1186
01:38:20,940 --> 01:38:22,940
What's wrong?

1187
01:38:22,940 --> 01:38:24,940
Let's go.

1188
01:38:43,940 --> 01:38:45,940
I'm sorry.

1189
01:38:45,940 --> 01:38:47,940
I'm sorry.

1190
01:38:47,940 --> 01:38:49,940
I'm sorry.

1191
01:38:49,940 --> 01:38:51,940
I'm sorry.

1192
01:38:51,940 --> 01:38:53,940
I'm sorry.

1193
01:38:53,940 --> 01:38:55,940
I'm sorry.

1194
01:38:55,940 --> 01:38:57,940
I'm sorry.

1195
01:38:57,940 --> 01:38:59,940
I'm sorry.

1196
01:38:59,940 --> 01:39:01,940
I'm sorry.

1197
01:39:01,940 --> 01:39:03,940
I'm sorry.

1198
01:39:03,940 --> 01:39:05,940
I'm sorry.

1199
01:39:05,940 --> 01:39:07,940
I'm sorry.

1200
01:39:07,940 --> 01:39:09,940
I'm sorry.

1201
01:39:09,940 --> 01:39:11,940
I'm sorry.

1202
01:39:11,940 --> 01:39:13,940
I'm sorry.

1203
01:39:29,940 --> 01:39:32,940
Himari, are you okay?

1204
01:39:41,940 --> 01:39:43,940
Yes.

1205
01:39:48,940 --> 01:39:52,940
Hello? Himari.

1206
01:39:52,940 --> 01:39:54,940
Dad...

1207
01:39:55,940 --> 01:39:58,940
Did you meet Minato?

1208
01:39:59,940 --> 01:40:01,940
He is...

1209
01:40:03,940 --> 01:40:07,940
...my real father.

1210
01:40:07,940 --> 01:40:08,940
I'm sorry.

1211
01:40:10,940 --> 01:40:11,940
That's right.

1212
01:40:12,940 --> 01:40:15,940
Why didn't you tell me such important things?

1213
01:40:18,940 --> 01:40:23,940
I promised my mom that I'd tell her when I was 20.

1214
01:40:26,940 --> 01:40:27,940
But my mom...

1215
01:40:28,940 --> 01:40:33,940
I wanted you and my mom to meet your real father.

1216
01:40:33,940 --> 01:40:35,940
That's not what I meant.

1217
01:40:37,940 --> 01:40:41,940
I don't know if you suddenly call me your real father.

1218
01:40:45,940 --> 01:40:46,940
I don't want to see him.

1219
01:40:50,940 --> 01:40:51,940
Himari...

1220
01:40:57,940 --> 01:40:58,940
Where are you going?

1221
01:40:58,940 --> 01:41:00,940
I'm going back to Okinawa.

1222
01:41:01,940 --> 01:41:02,940
But...

1223
01:41:05,940 --> 01:41:07,940
What about your promise to your uncle?

1224
01:41:07,940 --> 01:41:08,940
I don't know.

1225
01:41:10,940 --> 01:41:12,940
Could it be that you knew everything about Kotaro?

1226
01:41:14,940 --> 01:41:15,940
I don't know anything.

1227
01:41:17,940 --> 01:41:21,940
But I know that your uncle is very desperate.

1228
01:41:25,940 --> 01:41:26,940
But...

1229
01:41:26,940 --> 01:41:27,940
I don't know what to say.

1230
01:41:29,940 --> 01:41:32,940
When I get home, just tell me what you want.

1231
01:41:35,940 --> 01:41:36,940
Okay?

1232
01:41:56,940 --> 01:41:57,940
Dad...

1233
01:42:03,940 --> 01:42:04,940
Dad...

1234
01:42:10,940 --> 01:42:11,940
Come on.

1235
01:42:12,940 --> 01:42:13,940
Come with me.

1236
01:42:16,940 --> 01:42:18,940
Kotaro is here with me.

1237
01:42:18,940 --> 01:42:20,940
I'll wait here.

1238
01:42:20,940 --> 01:42:21,940
Kotaro is here.

1239
01:42:25,940 --> 01:42:27,940
You're not a kid anymore, are you?

1240
01:42:50,940 --> 01:42:51,940
What's wrong?

1241
01:43:02,940 --> 01:43:03,940
What?

1242
01:43:06,940 --> 01:43:08,940
Mochizuki Kasumi?

1243
01:43:09,940 --> 01:43:10,940
No way.

1244
01:43:11,940 --> 01:43:14,940
Can you lower the reverb a little?

1245
01:43:14,940 --> 01:43:16,940
And lower the volume a little.

1246
01:43:16,940 --> 01:43:19,940
Can you lower the reverb a little?

1247
01:43:19,940 --> 01:43:20,940
And then...

1248
01:43:21,940 --> 01:43:22,940
Minato...

1249
01:43:23,940 --> 01:43:24,940
The customer.

1250
01:43:25,940 --> 01:43:27,940
Let's take a break and try it.

1251
01:43:27,940 --> 01:43:28,940
Please.

1252
01:43:30,940 --> 01:43:31,940
Thank you for your hard work.

1253
01:43:31,940 --> 01:43:32,940
Thank you for your hard work.

1254
01:43:37,940 --> 01:43:38,940
Come here.

1255
01:43:46,940 --> 01:43:47,940
Okay.

1256
01:43:53,940 --> 01:43:55,940
Well, then, take your time.

1257
01:43:56,940 --> 01:43:57,940
What?

1258
01:44:10,940 --> 01:44:11,940
Are you...

1259
01:44:13,940 --> 01:44:14,940
Minato?

1260
01:44:16,940 --> 01:44:17,940
Yes, I am.

1261
01:44:30,940 --> 01:44:31,940
This.

1262
01:44:42,940 --> 01:44:43,940
The label.

1263
01:44:44,940 --> 01:44:45,940
Please take a look.

1264
01:44:46,940 --> 01:44:48,940
It's from my mother.

1265
01:44:55,940 --> 01:44:56,940
My mother is sick.

1266
01:45:01,940 --> 01:45:03,940
I don't think I can do it anymore.

1267
01:45:17,940 --> 01:45:19,940
Please listen to it.

1268
01:45:36,940 --> 01:45:38,940
I'm in the second one.

1269
01:45:38,940 --> 01:45:40,940
I'm in the second one.

1270
01:45:53,940 --> 01:45:54,940
Minato.

1271
01:45:55,940 --> 01:45:56,940
Are you okay?

1272
01:46:02,940 --> 01:46:03,940
I'm fine.

1273
01:46:08,940 --> 01:46:12,940
Actually, I'm getting married tomorrow.

1274
01:46:15,940 --> 01:46:16,940
You know...

1275
01:46:17,940 --> 01:46:18,940
I...

1276
01:46:19,940 --> 01:46:21,940
I have a baby.

1277
01:46:23,940 --> 01:46:25,940
It's called Himari.

1278
01:46:26,940 --> 01:46:30,940
He's always bright and like a sun.

1279
01:46:31,940 --> 01:46:33,940
He's my treasure.

1280
01:46:34,940 --> 01:46:35,940
And then...

1281
01:46:36,940 --> 01:46:38,940
I had a dream of being a translator.

1282
01:46:40,940 --> 01:46:45,940
He's always in a hurry, but he lives without regrets.

1283
01:46:49,940 --> 01:46:50,940
Hey, Minato.

1284
01:46:51,940 --> 01:46:55,940
Do you remember the first time we met?

1285
01:46:57,940 --> 01:47:02,940
Back then, Minato was going through a lot of trouble.

1286
01:47:04,940 --> 01:47:08,940
So, when I first saw Minato smile,

1287
01:47:09,940 --> 01:47:11,940
I was so happy.

1288
01:47:14,940 --> 01:47:19,940
When I thought I wanted to see that smile next to me,

1289
01:47:21,940 --> 01:47:25,940
I think I fell in love.

1290
01:47:26,940 --> 01:47:28,940
Ever since I met Minato,

1291
01:47:29,940 --> 01:47:31,940
I've been really happy every day.

1292
01:47:33,940 --> 01:47:39,940
If something bad or painful happens to Minato again,

1293
01:47:41,940 --> 01:47:43,940
I want to protect him.

1294
01:47:44,940 --> 01:47:47,940
I want to make Minato happy.

1295
01:47:49,940 --> 01:47:51,940
That's what I thought.

1296
01:47:51,940 --> 01:47:53,940
That's what I thought.

1297
01:47:55,940 --> 01:48:00,940
The smell of that flower I knew when I met Minato,

1298
01:48:02,940 --> 01:48:05,940
the way he touched the flower with shyness,

1299
01:48:07,940 --> 01:48:09,940
the happiness he felt when he was scared,

1300
01:48:11,940 --> 01:48:13,940
the pain of his heartbreak...

1301
01:48:14,940 --> 01:48:19,940
They're all treasures of my life that Minato gave me.

1302
01:48:25,940 --> 01:48:29,940
Minato gave me a shelter.

1303
01:48:35,940 --> 01:48:37,940
I'm glad I met Minato.

1304
01:48:37,940 --> 01:48:39,940
I'm glad I met Minato.

1305
01:48:42,940 --> 01:48:48,940
I hope the path Minato chose will continue to be happy.

1306
01:48:52,940 --> 01:48:55,940
Thank you, Minato.

1307
01:49:07,940 --> 01:49:09,940
Are you...

1308
01:49:12,940 --> 01:49:15,940
...my real father?

1309
01:49:18,940 --> 01:49:20,940
I'm sorry.

1310
01:49:21,940 --> 01:49:23,940
I'm sorry.

1311
01:49:24,940 --> 01:49:26,940
I'm sorry.

1312
01:49:28,940 --> 01:49:30,940
I'm sorry.

1313
01:49:31,940 --> 01:49:33,940
I'm sorry.

1314
01:49:34,940 --> 01:49:36,940
I'm sorry.

1315
01:49:38,940 --> 01:49:40,940
I'm sorry.

1316
01:49:41,940 --> 01:49:48,940
The person who raised you is your real father.

1317
01:49:48,940 --> 01:49:50,940
I'm sorry.

1318
01:50:03,940 --> 01:50:07,940
Hey, can you give this to your mother?

1319
01:50:08,940 --> 01:50:10,940
I'm sorry I'm late.

1320
01:50:10,940 --> 01:50:13,940
Can you show me that?

1321
01:50:20,940 --> 01:50:22,940
February 29th.

1322
01:50:24,940 --> 01:50:26,940
The same day.

1323
01:50:29,940 --> 01:50:33,940
You really don't have to see your mother.

1324
01:50:36,940 --> 01:50:38,940
I'm sorry.

1325
01:50:40,940 --> 01:50:43,940
I might not be able to see you again.

1326
01:50:49,940 --> 01:50:55,940
I'm not the one who wants your mother to be by your side.

1327
01:50:58,940 --> 01:51:00,940
Please go home.

1328
01:51:10,940 --> 01:51:12,940
I'm sorry.

1329
01:51:40,940 --> 01:51:43,940
I'm sorry.

1330
01:52:11,940 --> 01:52:13,940
Where's Himari?

1331
01:52:17,940 --> 01:52:19,940
She's in Tokyo.

1332
01:52:20,940 --> 01:52:22,940
She's going to see Minato.

1333
01:52:25,940 --> 01:52:30,940
I'm sure Himari will come back with Minato.

1334
01:52:32,940 --> 01:52:34,940
What do you mean?

1335
01:52:35,940 --> 01:52:42,940
I want you to spend the rest of your life with your real family.

1336
01:52:44,940 --> 01:52:49,940
With Miyu, Himari, and Minato.

1337
01:52:50,940 --> 01:52:53,940
I want you to spend time with them.

1338
01:52:54,940 --> 01:52:57,940
Why do you say that?

1339
01:52:57,940 --> 01:53:00,940
I did the worst thing.

1340
01:53:03,940 --> 01:53:11,940
I took the MD that Miyu put in Minato's post the day before the wedding.

1341
01:53:15,940 --> 01:53:19,940
So it didn't reach him.

1342
01:53:20,940 --> 01:53:24,940
I told him to go to Minato's house.

1343
01:53:25,940 --> 01:53:30,940
I told him to go to Minato's house.

1344
01:53:37,940 --> 01:53:39,940
I'm sorry.

1345
01:53:44,940 --> 01:53:46,940
I was scared.

1346
01:53:47,940 --> 01:53:53,940
I was scared to lose Miyu and Himari.

1347
01:53:54,940 --> 01:53:56,940
I'm sorry.

1348
01:54:09,940 --> 01:54:11,940
I'm sorry.

1349
01:54:14,940 --> 01:54:16,940
I'm sorry.

1350
01:54:16,940 --> 01:54:18,940
I'm sorry.

1351
01:54:21,940 --> 01:54:27,940
Ryusei was always on my side.

1352
01:54:31,940 --> 01:54:34,940
He made me happy.

1353
01:54:34,940 --> 01:54:36,940
I'm sorry.

1354
01:54:42,940 --> 01:54:48,940
Thank you for always being by my side.

1355
01:54:53,940 --> 01:54:56,940
For being Himari's father.

1356
01:55:00,940 --> 01:55:03,940
For being our family.

1357
01:55:05,940 --> 01:55:07,940
Thank you so much.

1358
01:55:13,940 --> 01:55:20,940
I want you to be by my side at the end.

1359
01:55:34,940 --> 01:55:37,940
I want you to be happy.

1360
01:55:59,940 --> 01:56:01,940
Mom.

1361
01:56:05,940 --> 01:56:08,940
I brought this for you.

1362
01:56:12,940 --> 01:56:14,940
From Minato.

1363
01:56:18,940 --> 01:56:21,940
I'm sorry I'm late.

1364
01:56:34,940 --> 01:56:36,940
I'm sorry.

1365
01:56:53,940 --> 01:56:55,940
Himari!

1366
01:57:04,940 --> 01:57:06,940
I'm sorry.

1367
01:57:34,940 --> 01:57:36,940
I'm sorry.

1368
01:57:49,940 --> 01:57:51,940
I'm sorry.

1369
01:58:04,940 --> 01:58:06,940
I'm sorry.

1370
01:58:09,940 --> 01:58:11,940
I'm sorry.

1371
01:58:13,940 --> 01:58:15,940
I'm sorry.

1372
01:58:16,940 --> 01:58:18,940
I'm sorry.

1373
01:58:19,940 --> 01:58:21,940
I'm sorry.

1374
01:58:22,940 --> 01:58:24,940
I'm sorry.

1375
01:58:25,940 --> 01:58:27,940
I'm sorry.

1376
01:58:28,940 --> 01:58:30,940
I'm sorry.

1377
01:58:31,940 --> 01:58:33,940
I'm sorry.

1378
01:58:34,940 --> 01:58:36,940
I'm sorry.

1379
01:58:37,940 --> 01:58:39,940
I'm sorry.

1380
01:58:40,940 --> 01:58:42,940
I'm sorry.

1381
01:58:43,940 --> 01:58:45,940
I'm sorry.

1382
01:58:46,940 --> 01:58:48,940
I'm sorry.

1383
01:58:49,940 --> 01:58:51,940
I'm sorry.

1384
01:58:52,940 --> 01:58:54,940
I'm sorry.

1385
01:58:55,940 --> 01:58:57,940
I'm sorry.

1386
01:58:58,940 --> 01:59:00,940
I'm sorry.

1387
01:59:01,940 --> 01:59:03,940
I'm sorry.

1388
01:59:04,940 --> 01:59:06,940
I'm sorry.

1389
01:59:07,940 --> 01:59:09,940
I'm sorry.

1390
01:59:10,940 --> 01:59:12,940
I'm sorry.

1391
01:59:13,940 --> 01:59:15,940
I'm sorry.

1392
01:59:16,940 --> 01:59:18,940
I'm sorry.

1393
01:59:19,940 --> 01:59:21,940
I'm sorry.

1394
01:59:22,940 --> 01:59:24,940
I'm sorry.

1395
01:59:25,940 --> 01:59:27,940
I'm sorry.

1396
01:59:28,940 --> 01:59:30,940
I'm sorry.

1397
01:59:31,940 --> 01:59:33,940
I'm sorry.

1398
01:59:35,940 --> 01:59:37,940
You're great at it.

1399
01:59:38,940 --> 01:59:40,940
You're great at it.

1400
01:59:41,940 --> 01:59:43,940
You're the crown class.

1401
01:59:43,940 --> 01:59:45,940
I hope he keeps his word.

1402
01:59:46,940 --> 01:59:48,940
Tell him it's okay.

1403
01:59:49,940 --> 01:59:51,940
What?

1404
01:59:52,940 --> 01:59:54,940
He's my friend.

1405
01:59:55,940 --> 01:59:57,940
I'm sorry.

1406
01:59:58,940 --> 02:00:00,940
That was bad.

1407
02:00:01,940 --> 02:00:03,940
You should take a break.

1408
02:00:04,940 --> 02:00:06,940
I have

1409
02:00:06,940 --> 02:00:12,940
The pain I forgot

1410
02:00:12,940 --> 02:00:18,940
I've been waiting for you

1411
02:00:18,940 --> 02:00:25,940
I feel I'll be alone

1412
02:00:25,940 --> 02:00:31,940
The weight of love you gave me

1413
02:00:31,940 --> 02:00:38,940
No matter which path I choose

1414
02:00:38,940 --> 02:00:44,940
No matter what answer I give

1415
02:00:44,940 --> 02:00:51,940
I'll surely continue to you

1416
02:00:51,940 --> 02:01:01,940
I'll walk towards you again and again

1417
02:01:03,940 --> 02:01:08,940
I have the pain I want to forget

1418
02:01:08,940 --> 02:01:15,940
I have the feelings I don't want to forget

1419
02:01:15,940 --> 02:01:22,940
This road we walked together

1420
02:01:22,940 --> 02:01:29,940
This road of memories we walked together

1421
02:01:29,940 --> 02:01:34,940
I have the pain I want to forget

1422
02:01:34,940 --> 02:01:41,940
I've been waiting for you

1423
02:01:41,940 --> 02:01:48,940
I've been waiting for you

1424
02:01:48,940 --> 02:01:51,940
There's no one else

1425
02:01:51,940 --> 02:01:54,940
Other than you

1426
02:01:54,940 --> 02:01:59,940
Goodbye

1427
02:02:01,940 --> 02:02:07,940
Thank you

1428
02:02:11,940 --> 02:02:13,940
Thank you
