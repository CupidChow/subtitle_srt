13
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:30,359
There are signs of perception
symptoms, and you're experiencing...

14
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:32,329
an incident that has
already happened again.

15

you felt because of the incident.

00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:41,040

30
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:58,050
What was the first case in which
profiling came into spotlight?

31
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,349
The Mad Bomber Case in America.

32
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:02,520
What is this? Is this a quiz?

33
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:06,159
Psychiatrist James Brussel was
in charge of the profiling.

34
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:09,759
He even knew that the culprit...

35
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:11,430
would wear a two-button suit,

36
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:13,870
and have it all buttoned up.
He had profiled him in detail.

37
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:16,169
And when the culprit was arrested,
he looked just like the description.

38
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:18,969
On the other hand, some believed...

39
00:03:18,969 --> 00:03:21,139
that it was just one of the police's
composite sketches.

When you are investigating a case,
you can't get an answer...

00:03:25,409 --> 00:03:27,550
straight away by simply
solving an algorithm.

42
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:31,050
One more question.

43
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,319
Who is the serial killer...

44
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:35,990
who said he could quit smoking
but not killing?

45
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:37,520
- That was...
- Yoo Young Chul?

46
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,560
Jung Dang Gyu.

47
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,360
He could not withhold the desire
to kill...

48
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,330
and killed himself in prison.

49
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:44,659
In Dante's "Inferno",

50
00:03:44,659 --> 00:03:47,969
he classifies the evil features
of humanity into seven levels.

51
00:03:48,069 --> 00:03:50,569
"Inferno" was written in 1310,

52
00:03:50,569 --> 00:03:52,300
so that was when
the term profiling...

53

Of course, it's Doctor Lee's lecture
on the world learned from books.

Did you call her?

73
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,779
She could get stressed out.
I shouldn't call her.

- It will be getting dark soon.

- Yes?

are you all right?

90
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,879
Yes, I'm fine. Continue.

91
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,180
We do not know if the kidnapped
victim has been murdered yet.

92
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:56,420
The police station in charge has
asked us for consultation.

93
00:06:57,189 --> 00:06:58,560
Call in the team members.

94
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:12,069
Did he really send this
to her family?

95
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:14,310
When did the victim go missing?

96
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:17,579
The police think that
it was 3 to 5 days ago.

97
00:07:17,709 --> 00:07:20,139
Why is the time of abduction
not exact?

98
00:07:20,379 --> 00:07:22,779
Victim Jo lived in a study room...

99
00:07:22,779 --> 00:07:25,779
and used to turn her cell phone off
for 2 or 3 days for her study.

100
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:29,990
That means her parents didn't know
that her daughter's gone missing.

101
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:32,259
It's not clear
when she was abducted.

102
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:34,259
There's no suspect.

103
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:36,529
There's a very low chance...

104
00:07:36,529 --> 00:07:38,459
that it is for money or revenge.

105
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:44,600
Wait.

106
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,310
It's not clear because of
the loud music,

107
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:51,410
but I think the man is saying
something.

108
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:54,610
The music was not added in.
It's from the site.

109
00:07:55,149 --> 00:07:58,120
It will take a while to separate
his voice.

110
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:01,319
Wait. What's that on...

111
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,449
the masked man's wrist?

112
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:05,689
Give me a second.

113
00:08:09,459 --> 00:08:11,930
That looks like some kind of
a pattern.

114
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,000
It could be a trace.

115
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:17,699
Are you telling me to find out what
this is before analyzing the voice?

116
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:19,339
Fine.

117
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:23,009
We might get a suspect if we compare
it to people around her.

118
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:25,180
Generally, sadistic criminals
tend to be...

119
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:27,110
someone the victim doesn't know.

120
00:08:27,449 --> 00:08:30,209
It is easier for the criminals to
torture and kill...

121
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,320
the person they don't know.

122
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,919
Filming a criminal action is...

123
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:37,419
a basic sign of sadistic fetishism.

124
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,490
Even though there's a danger of
exposing their identity,

125
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:42,789
they still film it and
send it to other people.

126
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:45,629
It comes from a strong desire
of domination.

127
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:47,870
They feel pleasure...

128
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,129
from the suppression and from
watching the victim suffer.

129
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,269
By showing how cruel they are,

130
00:08:52,269 --> 00:08:54,169
they make the victim fear,

131
00:08:54,169 --> 00:08:56,970
and it also shows their desire
to be recognized.

132
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,980
The important thing here is not why,

133
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:02,580
but to whom the video is sent.

134
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,789
Since 2015, there were
these three murder cases...

135
00:09:07,889 --> 00:09:09,820
that took place in Seoul
and Gyeonggi Province.

136
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,129
These three unsolved cases...

137
00:09:20,429 --> 00:09:21,830
have something in common.

138
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:25,039
What's wrong?

139
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:29,409
My baby. What happened to my baby?

140
00:09:29,409 --> 00:09:32,179
The first person to find the body
was the parent.

141
00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:36,549
The criminal abandoned
the dead body...

142
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:38,980
as if he knew the path of
their parents.

143
00:09:40,419 --> 00:09:43,190
But this time, he sent a video
instead of a body.

144
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,519
He's pursuing pleasure.

145
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:47,990
He's trying to make it
even more painful.

146
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:50,830
It will be worse for parents to
face their children suffer...

147
00:09:51,029 --> 00:09:53,929
than to see their dead bodies.

148
00:09:54,029 --> 00:09:56,570
Right. The criminal has evolved
extremely...

149
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:58,840
through three murders.

150
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:40,950
The bodies were found a week
after the victims went missing...

151
00:10:41,049 --> 00:10:42,710
in all the previous cases.

152
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:45,519
Going by the patterns, we have
about three days left,

153
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:49,490
but this time, they sent a video.

154
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,519
Sending a video means...

155
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:56,190
they're not interested
in the victims anymore.

156
00:10:56,789 --> 00:11:00,730
Team Manager Kang.
Jo Eun Jung's body was found.

157
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:04,399
There are lacerated wounds
in the neck, chest, and thighs.

158
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:06,769
She's also missing
a few fingernails and toenails.

159
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,610
By looking at the purple spot,

160
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:11,509
the torture went on for a few days.

161
00:11:11,509 --> 00:11:14,009
The place where he abandoned
the dead body is so different.

162
00:11:14,309 --> 00:11:16,009
Until now, the bodies were found...

163
00:11:16,149 --> 00:11:18,620
in a place where their parents
would find them first,

164
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,090
but this time, it was abandoned in
a place where no one would find it.

165
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:40,809
If the criminal's goal was
to conceal,

166
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:44,110
he wouldn't choose a place like that
when there are...

167
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,240
better places to hide it.

168
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:50,009
Why...

169
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:52,580
did he carry the heavy body...

170
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,220
and come all the way down here?

171
00:11:57,659 --> 00:11:59,820
There must be a reason
he changed the pattern...

172
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,759
like a change of mind.

173
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:04,700
No. We probably missed something.

174
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,759
Unless he was aiming for something,

175
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,899
he wouldn't have abandoned
the body here.

176
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,200
What if there's a private place...

177
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,970
hidden from hundreds of climbers?

178
00:12:24,179 --> 00:12:26,679
Team Manager Kang. Right here.

179
00:12:36,129 --> 00:12:39,799
A symbolical place
where it would...

180
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:44,700
maximize the pain of
the victim and her parents.

181
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:48,409
There's a reason why the criminal
chose this place for abandonment.

182
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:18,139
Eun Jung. It's Mom.

183
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:22,740
It's Mom. Get up. Let's go home.

184
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:33,779
This is Boksil.

185
00:13:34,789 --> 00:13:36,389
She's Eun Jung's sister.

186
00:13:38,659 --> 00:13:41,789
Her father bought her because
he was worried she might be lonely.

187
00:13:42,429 --> 00:13:44,899
Eun Jung loved her so much.

188
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,299
You made a grave for the puppy?

189
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:51,470
Yes.

190
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:57,340
It's where we go every time
we want to rest.

191
00:13:58,179 --> 00:13:59,340
Eun Jung said...

192
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,750
we should bury her here.

193
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:05,720
Are you...

194
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,990
wearing the same ring
as your daughter?

195
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,990
Didn't you see it?

196
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,730
Didn't you see it
when you found her?

197
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:19,860
We got this ring...

198
00:14:20,299 --> 00:14:22,970
on Eun Jung's 20th birthday.

199
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:32,539
The location of abandonment doesn't
have anything to do with her father.

200
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,980
The name written on the CD
was Eun Jung's mother.

201
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:36,980
(Namcheon, Eunsung-gu,
421-24 Gusung-dong, Lim Joo Sun)

202
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,320
Lim Joo Sun.

203
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:44,220
The receiver's name itself
was the message.

204
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,830
All the first finders of
three previous cases were...

205
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:51,929
also their mothers.

206
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:55,899
The criminal's target was...

207
00:14:56,970 --> 00:15:00,570
not the family but their mothers.

208
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:07,779
Why are you watching
this cruel video?

209
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:11,450
- Stop.
- What?

210
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,049
Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop.

211
00:15:13,049 --> 00:15:14,049
Right here.

212
00:15:14,389 --> 00:15:18,620
The man in this video isn't
doing this for himself.

213
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:21,889
He's aware of the audience.

214
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:26,000
Right there. It's moving.

215
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,230
It's not fixed.

216
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,230
That was because
she bumped into it.

217
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:32,600
Look. He's looking back.

218
00:15:32,669 --> 00:15:33,769
It's the third time.

219
00:15:39,879 --> 00:15:43,350
As you can see, the criminal is
aware of someone.

220
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:51,720
Team Manager Kang.
Here's the DNA test result.

221
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:55,360
It's weird.

222
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,830
The previous DNA...

223
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,769
and Eun Jung's DNA don't match.

224
00:16:03,269 --> 00:16:04,970
Because there's more than
one criminal.

225
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,100
Pardon?

226
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:09,169
One is torturing,

227
00:16:09,539 --> 00:16:11,639
and the other is filming it.

228
00:16:12,309 --> 00:16:15,679
It's folie a deux,
shared psychosis.

229
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:18,879
It's a psychological phenomenon of
sharing a same mental delusion.

230
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:22,350
It's like a fellowship
to bring out...

231
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:24,149
the cruellest part in them.

232
00:16:25,289 --> 00:16:27,419
The dominant criminal...

233
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:31,529
forces the other relatively weaker
accomplice to murder...

234
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:33,960
and uses it to threaten him.

235
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:38,370
That's how the dominated person
opens his eyes to a murder.

236
00:16:54,419 --> 00:16:56,450
I told you we've already looked
at it.

237
00:16:57,090 --> 00:17:00,090
No. There must be something.

238
00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:02,289
Stop.

239
00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:08,329
Play.

240
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:12,700
Wait.

241
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:16,039
See? I told you
she wasn't abducted here.

242
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:17,509
She just walked out.

243
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,809
You should come outside with me.

244
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:23,579
Sun Woo, you should keep watching
the footage.

245
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:47,910
This is the reason why there was
a shadow in the corner.

246
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:51,279
If you move in the blind spots,
it's possible...

247
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,539
to move without being seen.

248
00:18:08,089 --> 00:18:10,630
The culprit lured the victim without
being seen on the security footage.

249
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,569
But why did Jo Eun Jung
follow the culprit?

250
00:18:15,099 --> 00:18:16,200
Rewind the tape please.

251
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,450
She's holding a notebook.

252
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,750
But why did she hesitate?

253
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:38,190
What if it wasn't from her bag?

254
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:39,359
Rewind the tape please.

255
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:55,470
Excuse me.

256
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:08,150
Wait, Sun Woo. It's me.

257
00:19:11,089 --> 00:19:13,420
One person lured the victim,
and the other kidnapped her.

258
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:15,490
The accomplice must have been
hiding here.

259
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:17,690
It's an obscure and secluded place.

260
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,529
The two culprits kidnapped
the victims,

261
00:19:20,529 --> 00:19:22,869
while using the blind spots
to move unseen.

262
00:19:36,349 --> 00:19:38,319
This is how the culprit...

263
00:19:38,779 --> 00:19:39,880
lured Jo Eun Jung.

264
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,690
A kind heart to help others.

265
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:55,029
Mother, how did the examination go?

266
00:19:55,029 --> 00:19:56,430
I'm sorry.

267
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:59,099
You couldn't study even though
it's your exam period.

268
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,039
Did anything happen at the store?

269
00:20:01,269 --> 00:20:02,269
Were there many customers?

270
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:04,069
Of course you would say that.

271
00:20:04,509 --> 00:20:06,539
Nothing matters more
than selling more.

272
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:08,309
You must be feeling all right now.

273
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:10,579
Aren't you hungry?

274
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:11,980
Do you want me to cook something?

275
00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:14,279
It's all right.
I'll buy ramyeon on the way.

276
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:16,549
I'm nearly home.
Just boil water for me.

277
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:22,960
Do you need help?

278
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:28,869
Are you going up there?

279
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,089
Do you think
it was the same culprit?

280
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:57,059
If you look at the victim's age,
appearance,

281
00:20:57,059 --> 00:20:58,430
and the way in which
she went missing,

282
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:00,630
it seems likely.

283
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:03,170
The police station wants to start
an open investigation.

284
00:21:03,369 --> 00:21:04,529
They shouldn't.

285
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:06,670
The culprit didn't send
any videos yet.

286
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:09,069
That could indicate that
the victim is alive.

287
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:11,440
Once the police intervene,

288
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:14,910
this won't be fun for the culprits
any more.

289
00:21:15,579 --> 00:21:17,609
If they can't get fun
out of the victims,

290
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,079
they won't need them alive.

291
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:21,950
We need to analyze their
behavioral patterns and jobs...

292
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:23,589
to narrow down the suspects.

293
00:21:23,589 --> 00:21:25,019
Let's start profiling the culprits.

294
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:28,630
Seeing as the victims followed
them easily,

295
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:29,789
they must be good looking.

296
00:21:30,029 --> 00:21:32,529
And as the victims are in
their early 20s,

297
00:21:32,529 --> 00:21:35,200
the culprits will be
either in their 20s or 30s.

298
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,529
They abducted the victims freely...

299
00:21:36,529 --> 00:21:38,700
between morning to night
on weekdays.

300
00:21:38,869 --> 00:21:40,099
They disposed of the bodies...

301
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:42,470
during night or dawn.

302
00:21:42,809 --> 00:21:45,980
Considering the time of the crime
and the disposal of dead bodies,

303
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,779
it seems likely that
they don't have jobs.

304
00:21:48,009 --> 00:21:49,210
If they do,

305
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:51,450
the jobs won't be time constrained.

306
00:21:51,579 --> 00:21:52,819
As sadists,

307
00:21:52,819 --> 00:21:55,220
they would be unsociable.

308
00:21:55,319 --> 00:21:56,789
One of the accomplices...

309
00:21:56,789 --> 00:21:58,819
would be the leader,
controlling the other skillfully.

310
00:21:58,819 --> 00:22:00,859
Seeing as they torture the victims,

311
00:22:00,859 --> 00:22:02,190
it seems likely...

312
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:04,359
that they were abused
by their parents.

313
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:06,730
Mental stress that they receive
from such experiences...

314
00:22:06,859 --> 00:22:09,269
sometimes cause damage
in certain parts of the brain.

315
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,000
Some sadists...

316
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,400
who are violent and dominant...

317
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:16,339
try to get over
the feeling of helplessness...

318
00:22:16,339 --> 00:22:18,839
by using violence, committing arson,
or killing violently. In the end,

319
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:22,809
they're continuing the vicious cycle
of using violence.

320
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:26,180
One peculiar thing is that they
considered the close relationship...

321
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:28,420
of the victim and her mother
as an important factor.

322
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:30,549
They didn't pick random victims.

323
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,559
They have information on them,

324
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,059
and based on the information,

325
00:22:34,059 --> 00:22:36,789
they know about the parents'
behavioral patterns as well.

326
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:41,259
I'm sorry, but you need to
watch something.

327
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:46,200
If you have my daughter,
Kwon Yoo Jin,

328
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:49,910
please, please, don't kill her.

329
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:53,579
She is everything to me.

330
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:58,420
Please let Yoo Jin...

331
00:22:59,349 --> 00:23:00,650
come home safely.

332
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:03,720
The police consider the abduction
of Kwon Yoo Jin two days ago...

333
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,589
as a part of
the Namcheon Serial Abduction...

334
00:23:05,589 --> 00:23:08,529
and Murder Case that has continued
for the last two years.

335
00:23:08,529 --> 00:23:10,490
Call the media to stop broadcasting
more about this case.

336
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:11,829
Yes, sir.

337
00:23:11,829 --> 00:23:14,430
The police needs
to investigate quickly...

338
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:17,430
so that there would be
no more victims.

339
00:23:19,539 --> 00:23:22,640
Please don't kill me.

340
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:28,150
Please don't kill me.

341
00:23:29,549 --> 00:23:30,710
Next,

342
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:33,819
the police are investigating
the recent abduction cases...

343
00:23:33,819 --> 00:23:37,349
while considering the possibility
that it is a serial killing case.

344
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:39,019
However, according to
the persons concerned,

345
00:23:39,019 --> 00:23:43,230
there is no evidence yet
that can prove the possibility.

346
00:23:49,069 --> 00:23:50,269
Where are you going?

347
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:53,069
Do you really think that
they won't be able to find you?

348
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:08,890
Nana, did you stay up all night?

349
00:24:09,289 --> 00:24:11,190
I think I've seen this...

350
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:13,660
gruesome mask for over
3560 times since last night.

351
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:17,630
I've been engraving this image of
a poor girl being tortured by...

352
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:19,500
a masked mad man into my brain.

353
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,230
I've been...

354
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:25,069
watching this for 22 hours.

355
00:24:28,769 --> 00:24:30,269
Why are they placed like this?

356
00:24:30,269 --> 00:24:31,740
No, don't touch it!

357
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:37,079
My baby, you shouldn't see
horrible things like this.

358
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:40,180
You should stay like this
for a while and wait.

359
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,220
Oh, my.

360
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:47,359
I got it.

361
00:24:50,289 --> 00:24:52,299
It wasn't a special tattoo.

362
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:56,170
It's a common tattoo that
young men prefer nowadays.

363
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:58,940
We can't narrow down the suspects
with this.

364
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,769
I've seen this four years ago.

365
00:25:01,269 --> 00:25:02,940
Four years ago? Where?

366
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:05,779
In 2003, a famous celebrity
committed suicide after...

367
00:25:05,779 --> 00:25:07,380
his pornography videos had spread.

368
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:11,380
For eight months, there was a big
investigation on pornography sites.

369
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:14,049
I think I've seen that on
one of the files.

370
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,750
You should bring them.
Let's check them together.

371
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:20,089
The files have 67,321 pages.

372
00:25:20,089 --> 00:25:21,559
It could be too hard to check.

373
00:25:21,559 --> 00:25:22,630
67 thousand?

374
00:25:23,059 --> 00:25:25,859
Even if we had dozens of people,
we won't be able to check all that.

375
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,900
Should we analyse the audio first?

(Case Files)

377
00:25:35,869 --> 00:25:37,339
I can do it by myself.

378
00:25:37,339 --> 00:25:39,880
You should thank me.

379
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:41,910
Let me do this.

380
00:25:42,309 --> 00:25:44,750
I feel like I need to do something.

00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:10,039
from your daughter...

384
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,309

(Kim Jung Sook)

387
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:39,640
Ms. Kim, are you all right?

388
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,940
I heard everything...

389
00:26:48,009 --> 00:26:49,710
from the reporters.

390
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:51,509
I know what that is.

391
00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:53,779
Did you watch it?

392
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:56,950
I couldn't bear to watch it.

393
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:59,220
That was a good choice.

394
00:27:00,289 --> 00:27:01,730
Yoo Jin...

395
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:04,230
wanted to go to...

396
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:06,529
her friend's house to study.

397
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:09,700
But I told her to manage the store.

398
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:13,440
I had an examination for my thyroid.

399
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,970
It was because of me.

400
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:20,109
It wasn't.
Don't say that.

401
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:23,650
Every time my husband saw Yoo Jin,

402
00:27:25,049 --> 00:27:26,220
he told her to be sly.

403
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:30,619
He said the world is too dangerous
to trust anyone.

404
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:34,119
But...

405
00:27:35,289 --> 00:27:36,829
I told her that's not true.

406
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:39,930
I told her to be kind, honest,

407
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:42,599
and to help other people.

408
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:44,799
That's how we should live our lives.

409
00:27:49,009 --> 00:27:50,839
I didn't expect this to happen.

410
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:53,910
I shouldn't have said that.

411
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:56,980

Stop.

417
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:20,170
Magnify this table please.

418
00:28:26,779 --> 00:28:28,039
It's the same table.

419
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:30,210
That wall.

420
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:33,079
There was a picture on that wall.

421
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:36,019
If you consider the distance
from the window,

422
00:28:36,019 --> 00:28:38,150
the location of the nail
and the picture match.

423
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:39,660
It means it's the same place.

424
00:28:43,589 --> 00:28:45,460
The S written on his wrist...

425
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,170
meant S Culture.

426
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:50,730
S Culture?

427
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,740
They made a fake sadistic video...

428
00:29:00,779 --> 00:29:02,849
on a secretly operated
internet show.

429

It disappeared four years ago during
the investigation on pornography.

430
00:29:06,849 --> 00:29:10,220
There's no exact information because
they used overseas server.

431
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:18,960
No way.

His name is Kang Jae Deok.
He runs S Culture.

448
00:30:24,759 --> 00:30:27,930
He's 31 years old. He has a record
of several imprisonments for rape,

449
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:29,700
assault, and distribution
of pornography.

450
00:30:29,769 --> 00:30:31,400
His address is 6 Hahwae Street,
Namcheon.

451
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:34,039
He works at Sung Un Trading.
It's registered as a trading firm.

452
00:30:34,039 --> 00:30:35,569
Kang has records of...

453
00:30:35,569 --> 00:30:38,880
going under investigations for
domestic violence when he was young.

454
00:30:39,339 --> 00:30:41,440
The record says his mother ran away
long time ago.

455
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:44,549
There's also records of him
hurting himself in the prison.

456
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:47,019
His sadistic tendency grew...

457
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:49,019
as he was exposed to a long period
of violence.

458
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:15,910
Who are you?

459
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:21,990
Are you okay?

460
00:31:30,529 --> 00:31:31,559
Who is it?

461
00:31:32,099 --> 00:31:33,829
I'm here to see Kang Jae Deok.

462
00:31:35,329 --> 00:31:37,700
I'm Kim Hyun Jun
from Special Crimes Investigations.

463
00:31:38,569 --> 00:31:41,400
I'm here to investigate
on recent murder cases.

464
00:31:41,569 --> 00:31:43,740
Go away. He's not here.

465
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:45,380
Please cooperate
with the investigation.

466
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:48,380
Why would the police come
to my house?

467
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:50,349
There's nothing to investigate.

468
00:31:51,809 --> 00:31:52,980
Is there someone inside?

469
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,380
Go away!

470
00:32:21,609 --> 00:32:22,609

471
00:32:28,349 --> 00:32:30,549
Don't do anything stupid. Okay?

472
00:32:31,289 --> 00:32:32,460
I'm not going to the prison.

473
00:32:33,589 --> 00:32:34,819
I'm not going there again.

474
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:36,390
Never.

475
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:37,930
No. Stop.

476
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:44,930
Calm down. Calm down.

477
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,740
Get down here and let's talk.

478
00:32:55,079 --> 00:32:56,150
Kang Jae Deok.

479
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:10,559
Okay.

480
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:15,930
Your son jumped off...

481
00:33:17,099 --> 00:33:19,839
the roof while he was running away.

482
00:33:25,779 --> 00:33:27,180
Did he die?

483
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,430
You look sad.

484
00:33:42,859 --> 00:33:44,259
Are you serious?

485
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:47,599
How would you feel if you son dies?

486
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,700
I understand you're sad,

487
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,470
but your son is a strong suspect...

488
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:55,839
of 4 murders and 1 abduction.

489
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:58,670
That jerk is dead now.

00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:00,140
Get out of my house now.

491
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:02,779
I have to save the currently
abducted victim.

492
00:34:02,779 --> 00:34:05,109
Is there anything you know
by chance?

493
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,590
Disorder.

494
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:20,360
This dirty room is far away from...

495
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:23,130
the sadistic tendency
where he controls someone.

496
00:34:24,369 --> 00:34:26,039
No mirror means...

497
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,369
he rejects himself.

498
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:35,179
Showing a desire
to control someone...

499
00:34:35,849 --> 00:34:39,019
means he's controlled by someone.

500
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:44,820
He's a subordinate who feels
comfortable being dominated.

501
00:34:57,230 --> 00:35:00,039
It looks like the second victim,
Choi Eun Seo's fingernail.

502
00:35:01,699 --> 00:35:03,369
He kept a souvenir...

503
00:35:04,039 --> 00:35:05,539
to commemorate his murder.

504
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:29,070
There's nothing else found here.

505
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:32,300
Kang Jae Deok? I know him.

506
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:34,039
We broadcast together a few times.

507
00:35:34,969 --> 00:35:37,909
What? You saw it's all a lie.

508
00:35:38,039 --> 00:35:40,809
Anyone who film this for real
would be a psychopath.

509
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:43,079
Do you know anyone in here?

510
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:48,079
If I tell you, will you set me free?

511
00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:49,250
Look closely.

512
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:53,489
This guy.

513
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:57,789
He worked together with
Kang Jae Deok at S Culture,

514
00:35:57,789 --> 00:35:59,760
and he has the same tattoo
on his wrist.

515
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,429
Yoon Jeong Sub.
He's same age as Kang.

516
00:36:02,429 --> 00:36:04,400
He grew up in a child-care
institutions since he was 8.

517
00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:05,599
The address is...

518
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:29,630
Who are you?

519
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:32,360
Please excuse us.
We're from the NCI.

520
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:35,000
We're here for Yoon Jeong Sub.

521
00:36:37,269 --> 00:36:39,769
What's your relation to him?

522
00:36:42,039 --> 00:36:43,139
Please come in.

523
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:57,289
- He's not picking up.
- The person you are trying to...

524
00:36:57,289 --> 00:36:58,619
reach is unavailable.

525
00:36:59,019 --> 00:37:00,519
You decorated the house nicely.

526
00:37:00,989 --> 00:37:02,489
It's very organized too.

527
00:37:03,789 --> 00:37:06,300
My husband is very neat.

528
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:09,570
Has anything out of the ordinary
happened to Yoon Jeong Sub recently?

529
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,230
Anything out of the ordinary?

530
00:37:12,099 --> 00:37:14,539
No, nothing comes to mind.

531
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,969
Where is your husband right now?

532
00:37:19,309 --> 00:37:20,440
I'm not sure.

533
00:37:21,309 --> 00:37:23,809
Do you happen to know a man
named Kang Jae Deok?

534
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:26,619
Yes, I do. He's my husband's friend.

535
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:30,389
But could you stop asking questions,

536
00:37:30,389 --> 00:37:32,389
and explain to me why you're asking?

537
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:35,989
Kang Jae Deok is dead.

538
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:43,199
Kang Jae Deok was a strong suspect
for a serial murder case.

539
00:37:43,369 --> 00:37:45,500
He died from an accident
while on the run.

540
00:37:46,369 --> 00:37:48,199
But why are you looking
for my husband?

541
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:51,809
We have nothing to do with Jae Deok.

542
00:37:55,309 --> 00:37:56,380
Aren't you hot?

543
00:37:58,409 --> 00:37:59,420
No.

544
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:02,179
Your husband...

545
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:04,389
must like to drink.

546
00:38:07,019 --> 00:38:08,719
No, I drank those.

547
00:38:09,789 --> 00:38:10,789
But...

548
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:13,929
why did you come to find my husband?

549
00:38:13,929 --> 00:38:17,000
We were only questioning his
acquaintances out of formality.

550
00:38:18,269 --> 00:38:20,900
If you happen to think of anything,

551
00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:22,239
please call this number.

552
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:24,269
We'll be on our way.

553
00:38:31,449 --> 00:38:33,679
The house is tidy and organized.

554
00:38:33,679 --> 00:38:35,480
There are mirrors hanging
everywhere.

555
00:38:35,989 --> 00:38:37,949
I see traces of a sadist all around,

556
00:38:37,949 --> 00:38:40,760
trying to control all corners
of the house.

557
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:43,030
Did you see Song Yoo Kyung
button up her shirt,

558
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:44,630
and pull down her sleeves?

559
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:46,030
Yes.

560
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:47,860
It must be to hide...

561
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:49,769
bruises from being beaten by
Yoon Jeong Sub.

562
00:38:51,199 --> 00:38:53,199
She's been trained to be helpless.

563
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,809
Do you think it's a type of
Stockholm syndrome?

564
00:38:56,969 --> 00:38:57,969
It is.

565
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,179
Song Yoo Kyung believes that...

566
00:39:01,179 --> 00:39:04,010
if Yoon Jeong Sub is taken away,
she will have no one to rely on.

567
00:39:05,409 --> 00:39:07,650
It's difficult to look forward to
her cooperation.

568
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,119
I'll go in hiding...

569
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,690
until Yoon Jeong Sub returns.

570
00:40:27,199 --> 00:40:28,199
Song Yoo Kyung.

571
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:30,530
Song Yoo Kyung!

572
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:34,869
Search around the house now.
Hurry.

573
00:40:34,869 --> 00:40:35,869
Yes, sir.

574
00:40:36,869 --> 00:40:39,510
Sir, Song Yoo Kyung...

575
00:40:40,610 --> 00:40:41,780
has escaped.

576
00:40:41,809 --> 00:40:43,150
We have to find her.

577
00:40:43,349 --> 00:40:46,150
I'm sure she went to him.

578
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:56,159
This is the last time we see her.

579
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:58,860
Her phone is turned off.

580
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:01,199
If Yoon Jeong Sub finds out
that the police visited,

581
00:41:01,199 --> 00:41:03,070
he might resort to extreme measures.

582
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:04,730
Kwon Yoo Jin will be in danger.

583
00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:06,400
Please don't kill me.

584
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:19,349
Team Manager Kang, some woman
is here to see you.

585
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,769
Ms. Song,

586
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:45,880
what happened?

587
00:41:50,849 --> 00:41:51,909
I was nervous,

588
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:55,019
so I went looking for him.

589
00:42:07,429 --> 00:42:09,469
What did you tell your husband?

590
00:42:11,469 --> 00:42:12,670
I told him the truth.

591
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:17,110
The police came and asked about
a murder case.

592
00:42:18,039 --> 00:42:19,280
I told him everything.

593
00:42:20,239 --> 00:42:21,840
Did he beat you?

594
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:26,650
I don't know why he suddenly
did this to me.

595
00:42:26,650 --> 00:42:27,920
Ms. Song.

596
00:42:29,019 --> 00:42:31,349
If you are hiding anything,
please tell me the truth.

597
00:42:47,199 --> 00:42:48,539
To be honest, I...

598
00:42:49,309 --> 00:42:51,210
I can't drink.

599
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:54,579
Your husband must like to drink.

600
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:57,809
No, I drank those.

601
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:00,719
Usually, he's kind and good.

602
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:03,750
But once he starts drinking...

603
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:13,230
You pathetic woman...

604
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:17,030
I'm sorry.

605
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:20,539
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

606
00:43:20,539 --> 00:43:22,769
He'd only do it
when he's really drunk.

607
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:25,170
I'm sorry I lied.

608
00:43:25,469 --> 00:43:28,239
I was scared and I didn't
know what to say.

609
00:43:28,809 --> 00:43:29,809
I just...

610
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:32,480
didn't want to betray him.

611
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:35,679
I love him.

612
00:43:37,389 --> 00:43:38,489
That ring...

613
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:41,920
Did your husband give it to you?

614
00:43:42,519 --> 00:43:43,530
Yes.

615
00:43:44,389 --> 00:43:46,159
It was a birthday gift.

616
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,030
Why?

617
00:43:49,929 --> 00:43:51,800
Your birthday was a couple days ago.

618
00:43:51,829 --> 00:43:52,840
Yes.

619
00:43:53,699 --> 00:43:55,340
But how did you know?

620
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:56,440
That ring...

621
00:43:56,809 --> 00:43:59,070
Did you get matching ones
with your daughter?

622
00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:02,539
It was for Eun Jung's 20th birthday.

623
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:05,550
We got matching ones.

624
00:44:07,079 --> 00:44:09,750
It seems to be the victim's ring.

625
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:37,949
I went to find my husband.

626
00:44:38,809 --> 00:44:41,679
Whenever he'd play cards,
I couldn't reach him for days.

627
00:44:48,659 --> 00:44:50,489
We met in front of a bar.

628
00:44:52,429 --> 00:44:54,659
And he started beating
me out of the blue.

629
00:44:55,630 --> 00:44:58,730
I don't know where he went
afterwards.

630
00:44:59,469 --> 00:45:01,300
- Status?
- It's the second floor over there.

631
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:02,300
Let's go up.

632
00:45:04,670 --> 00:45:05,670
Raise.

633
00:45:07,909 --> 00:45:09,710
- Everyone, stop what you're doing.
- Yoon Jeong Sub.

634
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:14,349
Stay put!

635
00:45:14,349 --> 00:45:16,150
- What is this?
- Don't move.

636
00:45:40,539 --> 00:45:41,539
Follow me.

637
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:43,349
You don't need to watch.

638
00:45:43,349 --> 00:45:45,210
Would you like a cup of tea?

639
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:51,719
He doesn't look nervous at all.

640
00:45:52,489 --> 00:45:54,960
He won't open up his mouth easily.

641
00:45:55,289 --> 00:45:56,630
He's a dominator type.

642
00:45:56,889 --> 00:45:59,699
They prepare and practice
every single tiny thing,

643
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:01,500
just in case something like
this happens.

644
00:46:03,929 --> 00:46:06,570
(Kim Hae Jin, Choi Eun Seo, Lee Ji
Soo, Jo Eun Jung, Kwon Yoo Jin)

645
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:12,570
Turn off the AC in the
interrogation room.

646
00:46:12,809 --> 00:46:14,110
And dim the lights.

647
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:16,280
It's a form of psychological
interrogation.

648
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:17,880
People also call it psychological
torture.

649
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:19,949
Bright lights and complete darkness.

650
00:46:19,949 --> 00:46:23,320
The humidity and temperature keep
changing,

651
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:25,090
making the suspect nervous.

652
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:27,420
We have to create an environment
that's drastically different...

653
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:29,630
from the one he predicted
and simulated.

654
00:46:30,590 --> 00:46:31,829
Are you not going in?

655
00:46:36,769 --> 00:46:39,130
Wait, he's responding.

656
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:41,400
If we want to find out where
Kwon Yoo Jin is,

657
00:46:42,039 --> 00:46:44,039
we have to make him slip up.

658
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:47,380
I'll go in. I'll try provoking him.

659
00:46:56,619 --> 00:46:57,789
How do you feel?

660
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:02,860
DNA was found on the body.

661
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:06,730
It's being proceeded right now,
so the results will be here soon.

662
00:47:07,730 --> 00:47:09,400
We have all the evidence too.

663
00:47:16,309 --> 00:47:18,969
Is this what you used?

664
00:47:18,969 --> 00:47:22,179
Did you enjoy the women in pain
as you pulled their fingernails?

665
00:47:25,949 --> 00:47:27,079
What's that expression?

666
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:29,989
Do you admit it was your doing?

667
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:34,119
Just because you found some
tools in my car,

668
00:47:35,289 --> 00:47:37,489
are you saying I pulled out this
woman's fingernails?

669
00:47:40,829 --> 00:47:42,460
Kang Jae Deok lured them,

670
00:47:43,130 --> 00:47:44,300
and you kidnapped them.

671
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:49,000
The two DNAs are different, meaning
Kang Jae Deok took care of two,

672
00:47:49,469 --> 00:47:51,670
and you took care of the rest.
Right?

673
00:47:54,679 --> 00:47:57,710
Why? Did Kang Jae Deok say no
at first?

674
00:47:57,710 --> 00:48:00,679
So you ordered him to do this...

675
00:48:01,179 --> 00:48:02,349
to control him?

676
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:08,619
You've watched too many movies,
Detective.

677
00:48:19,429 --> 00:48:21,400
You worked at S Culture with
Kang Jae Deok, right?

678
00:48:23,710 --> 00:48:24,909
Kang Jae Deok.

679
00:48:26,409 --> 00:48:28,210
What's he doing these days?

680
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:33,019
Yoon Jeong Sub, listen carefully.

681
00:48:33,650 --> 00:48:35,849
We have more than plenty
of evidence,

682
00:48:36,989 --> 00:48:39,389
so you'd better quit that useless
pretense.

683
00:48:43,690 --> 00:48:45,289
Then just follow the law.

684
00:48:47,030 --> 00:48:50,599
Yoon Jeong Sub is acting
tough on purpose.

685
00:48:50,869 --> 00:48:52,699
It's an instinctive defense
mechanism.

686
00:48:52,829 --> 00:48:55,599
He's not the type to crumble down
with our usual methods.

687
00:48:56,309 --> 00:48:57,710
Where is Song Yoo Kyung right now?

688
00:48:59,070 --> 00:49:02,440
Yoon Jeong Sub, just you wait.

689
00:49:03,050 --> 00:49:05,880
Once this comes out, you won't be
able to break free.

690
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:10,019
Team Manager Kang.

691
00:49:11,550 --> 00:49:13,960
No, you can't do that.

692
00:49:14,590 --> 00:49:17,059
Song Yoo Kyung is probably
terrified right now.

693
00:49:17,130 --> 00:49:20,099
You're the one who can understand
her position the best.

694
00:49:20,199 --> 00:49:22,360
I know you can persuade her.

695
00:49:23,570 --> 00:49:24,670
But...

696
00:49:24,730 --> 00:49:26,699
We can't stall any further.

697
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:30,469
If things get more delayed, there
won't be any way to save Yoo Jin.

698
00:49:30,969 --> 00:49:32,139
The decision is up to you.

699
00:49:40,619 --> 00:49:42,320
What would you do?

700
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:52,789
I'm really bad at...

701
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:56,369
talking to strangers
unless it's online.

702
00:49:59,130 --> 00:50:01,239
I heard about your story, Yoo Kyung.

703
00:50:03,909 --> 00:50:05,010
And...

704
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:09,110
I remembered what I'd forgotten
about me.

705
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:12,579
Was it when I was 21?

706
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:15,079
He had a nice voice.

707
00:50:17,250 --> 00:50:19,590
I just kept thinking about him.

708
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:22,920
I wanted to do everything with him,
so I learned hacking.

709
00:50:25,530 --> 00:50:27,559
The man was an expert in it.

710
00:50:32,869 --> 00:50:35,000
- What in the world!
- Oh no!

711
00:50:35,099 --> 00:50:36,969
- And then...
- My money!

712
00:50:37,010 --> 00:50:38,269
- I found out...
- Oh no.

713
00:50:39,369 --> 00:50:41,309
that I'd killed a person.

714
00:50:42,909 --> 00:50:44,780
One day, I went home.

715
00:50:45,650 --> 00:50:47,719
And the house was completely empty.

716
00:50:50,019 --> 00:50:53,519
I lost everything at that moment.

717
00:51:03,099 --> 00:51:04,469
At first,

718
00:51:08,170 --> 00:51:09,599
he slapped my cheek.

719
00:51:10,739 --> 00:51:12,440
That was the start of it all.

720
00:51:12,739 --> 00:51:13,780
I'm sorry.

721
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:15,110
It only grew worse.

722
00:51:15,110 --> 00:51:16,409
It's all my fault.

723
00:51:18,309 --> 00:51:20,750
He was everything to me.

724
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:26,090
He took me in when I had
no one to rely on.

725
00:51:29,019 --> 00:51:31,230
No one can hurt you.

726
00:51:33,030 --> 00:51:34,630
They need your help.

727
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:37,170
You can help them.

728
00:51:39,099 --> 00:51:40,699
I'm so scared.

729
00:51:44,869 --> 00:51:46,780
We need you, Yoo Kyung.

730
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:50,809
Only your husband knows where
Kwon Yoo Jin is.

731
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:55,849
If we found out where she is,
we can save her.

732
00:52:00,059 --> 00:52:01,159
Will...

733
00:52:02,219 --> 00:52:03,929
Will it really be okay?

734
00:52:09,329 --> 00:52:10,530
The two of us...

735
00:52:12,130 --> 00:52:14,239
can save our past selves.

736
00:52:16,239 --> 00:52:17,440
All on our own.

737
00:52:45,969 --> 00:52:47,300
I...

738
00:52:48,469 --> 00:52:51,869
I want to save that woman
who was abducted.

739
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:55,179
Kwon Yoo Jin...

740
00:52:56,179 --> 00:52:58,909
Where is she right now?

741
00:52:59,710 --> 00:53:04,250
The police told me you
killed someone.

742
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:08,489
Did you really kill someone?

743
00:53:10,059 --> 00:53:11,159
You didn't, right?

744
00:53:12,130 --> 00:53:13,530
Why did you do it?

745
00:53:17,170 --> 00:53:18,900
It has nothing to do with you.

746
00:53:19,099 --> 00:53:22,639
I can't believe that you
killed someone.

747
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:27,239
Let this woman out.

748
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:29,510
I'm not going to say anything.

749
00:53:32,349 --> 00:53:33,849
This is why...

750
00:53:34,019 --> 00:53:37,889
I told you not to hang out with
people like Kang Jae Deok.

751
00:53:39,150 --> 00:53:41,389
It'd have been better
if you'd listened to me.

752
00:53:43,090 --> 00:53:44,960
Kwon Yoo Jin...

753
00:53:46,699 --> 00:53:48,900
Where is she right now?

754
00:53:50,269 --> 00:53:51,929
Why do I have to answer?

755
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:55,469
Wake up, Song Yoo Kyung!

756
00:53:56,469 --> 00:53:59,340
They want to frame us for murder
right now.

757
00:54:08,380 --> 00:54:09,519
Five people.

758
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:12,289
It's five people.

759
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:15,619
Honey.

760
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:17,960
Please tell me.

761
00:54:19,630 --> 00:54:20,630
I told you.

762
00:54:22,159 --> 00:54:23,829
It has nothing to do with you.

763
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:26,840
So just leave.

764
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:34,679
Hey, let her out and you guys
find where she is.

765
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:42,849
Why aren't you leaving?
Get out right now!

766
00:54:44,550 --> 00:54:45,650
You...

767
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:49,920
You're really not going to talk?

768
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:51,989
I...

769
00:54:53,929 --> 00:54:55,300
I will never talk.

770
00:55:29,199 --> 00:55:30,300
Did my husband...

771
00:55:32,699 --> 00:55:35,139
really kill those women?

772
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,840
You just need to fill out some
papers as a testifier.

773
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:40,679
And then you can go.

774
00:55:40,739 --> 00:55:42,909
I know it's hard,
but please cooperate with us.

775
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:46,920
How am I supposed to
continue living?

776
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:49,650
How am I supposed to
continue living?

777
00:55:51,289 --> 00:55:53,460
You have been really brave.

778
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:57,260
You can do anything by yourself,
Yoo Kyung.

779
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:01,559
Thank you.

780
00:56:04,369 --> 00:56:05,599
Just give me a moment...

781
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:16,409
Just give me a moment
to get some fresh air.

782
00:56:19,949 --> 00:56:21,650
Kang Jae Deok lured the victims,

783
00:56:22,050 --> 00:56:23,219
and you abducted them.

784
00:56:23,420 --> 00:56:25,449
There are two different DNAs,
which means...

785
00:56:25,449 --> 00:56:26,989
Kang Jae Deok killed two,

786
00:56:27,519 --> 00:56:29,519
and you killed the others, right?

787
00:56:30,329 --> 00:56:31,489
The orderly fashion of...

788
00:56:32,329 --> 00:56:34,400
Yoon Jeong Sub's house...

789
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:36,300
does not exist in the photo.

790
00:56:36,659 --> 00:56:39,170
And Yoon Jeong Sub and
Kang Jae Deok's...

791
00:56:39,969 --> 00:56:41,699
main trauma...

792
00:56:41,739 --> 00:56:43,570
does not concern hatred
for their mothers.

793
00:56:45,239 --> 00:56:46,539
Then why did these two...

794
00:56:47,110 --> 00:56:49,309
commit such crimes?

795
00:56:51,250 --> 00:56:53,150
He's acting tough on purpose.

796
00:56:53,719 --> 00:56:56,179
He pretended to be tough while
Hyun Jun was interrogating him.

797
00:56:56,179 --> 00:56:57,750
What does he do nowadays?

798
00:56:57,750 --> 00:56:59,090
Follow the law then.

799
00:56:59,090 --> 00:57:01,090
He is not being hostile.

800
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:02,960
He is being defensive.

801
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:05,059
It looks like he's acting.

802
00:57:06,190 --> 00:57:07,829
Turn on the footage
of Song Yoo Kyung.

803
00:57:07,929 --> 00:57:08,929
Yes, sir.

804
00:57:11,429 --> 00:57:13,840
She's not scared at all.

805
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:16,440
She looks scared to me.

806
00:57:16,739 --> 00:57:17,739
Stop.

807
00:57:18,210 --> 00:57:19,309
Rewind.

808
00:57:21,139 --> 00:57:23,980
She looked at his eyes first.

809
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:25,980
- Pardon?
- If she was scared,

810
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:28,420
she would have looked
somewhere other than his face.

811
00:57:28,420 --> 00:57:29,849
She wouldn't have been able to
look him in the eyes.

812
00:57:30,849 --> 00:57:33,019
Even while looking at horrible
pictures of the dead bodies,

813
00:57:33,190 --> 00:57:35,190
she's neither scared nor horrified.

814
00:57:35,690 --> 00:57:36,690
That woman...

815
00:57:37,130 --> 00:57:38,760
is too calm.

816
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:41,159
He is watching Song Yoo Kyung.

817
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,130
He is...

818
00:57:44,429 --> 00:57:46,800
waiting for her order.

819
00:57:46,869 --> 00:57:48,369
Will you really not tell them?

820
00:57:48,369 --> 00:57:49,369
Wait.

821
00:57:50,139 --> 00:57:53,239
This sounds like
she's checking something.

822
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:55,780
Wake up, Song Yoo Kyung!

823
00:57:56,210 --> 00:57:59,250
They want to frame us for murder
right now.

824
00:58:01,179 --> 00:58:02,219
Five people.

825
00:58:03,750 --> 00:58:05,019
It's five people.

826
00:58:07,389 --> 00:58:09,489
Did you really kill someone?

827
00:58:11,030 --> 00:58:12,190
You didn't, right?

828
00:58:13,059 --> 00:58:14,530
Why did you do it?

829
00:58:14,530 --> 00:58:17,570
She's appealing
emotionally to him...

830
00:58:17,570 --> 00:58:21,070
and ordering him
to confess his crimes.

831
00:58:21,070 --> 00:58:22,900
It has nothing to do with you.

832
00:58:23,170 --> 00:58:24,539
Let this woman out.

833
00:58:24,769 --> 00:58:26,409
I'm not going to say anything.

834
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:28,639
And she's ordering him...

835
00:58:29,139 --> 00:58:31,679
not to involve her in this case.

836
00:58:32,110 --> 00:58:33,110
You...

837
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:37,320
You're really not going to talk?

838
00:58:37,619 --> 00:58:38,619
I...

839
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:40,820
I will never talk.

840
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:42,019
Finally,

841
00:58:42,719 --> 00:58:44,630
she made him promise...

842
00:58:45,030 --> 00:58:47,429
that he won't tell anyone
about her.

843
00:58:48,329 --> 00:58:49,800
Where is she now?

844
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:55,769
Crazy witch.

845
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:59,170
We should kill whores like her.

846
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:04,010
You decorated the house nicely.

847
00:59:04,380 --> 00:59:05,949
It's very organized too.

848
00:59:08,050 --> 00:59:10,179
What did you tell your husband?

849
00:59:11,190 --> 00:59:12,349
I told him the truth.

850
00:59:13,289 --> 00:59:16,719
The police came and asked about
a murder case.

851
00:59:17,659 --> 00:59:18,889
I told him everything.

852
00:59:19,289 --> 00:59:21,300
She used Kang Jae Deok
and Yoon Jeong Sub...

853
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:23,829
to act like
she was a victim as well.

854
00:59:28,099 --> 00:59:29,840
Song Yoo Kyung was the person...

855
00:59:30,039 --> 00:59:31,469
that came up with...

856
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:35,139
and planned everything.

857
00:59:47,489 --> 00:59:48,489
Yes.

858
00:59:49,389 --> 00:59:50,389
Yes.

859
00:59:51,130 --> 00:59:52,130
Yes.

860
00:59:52,690 --> 00:59:53,699
What?

861
01:00:30,869 --> 01:00:33,329
To Song Yoo Kyung,
men are just tools.

862
01:00:33,329 --> 01:00:34,539
Shut your mouth!

863
01:00:35,070 --> 01:00:36,800
He's showing reactions.

864
01:00:37,739 --> 01:00:40,269
He won't ever give up.

865
01:00:41,510 --> 01:00:44,179
- Who are you?
- I am Reporter Son Suk Ju.

866
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:47,420
You should have ignored me.

867
01:00:47,619 --> 01:00:49,320
I didn't do anything wrong.

868
01:00:49,550 --> 01:00:51,820
I found
the body of Officer Lee Jin Joo.

869
01:00:52,119 --> 01:00:53,119
It's strange.

870
01:00:53,219 --> 01:00:55,760
It's not what we think, right?

871
01:00:56,590 --> 01:00:58,960
I think the culprit is after
all of us.
