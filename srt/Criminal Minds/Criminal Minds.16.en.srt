(Episode 16)

10
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,439
Do you want some help?

11
00:01:11,609 --> 00:01:13,480
Are you okay?

12
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:32,200
Only public law shall be like water,
and justice shall flow like sewage.

13
00:01:32,299 --> 00:01:35,170
Only public law shall be like water,
and justice shall flow like sewage.

14
00:01:58,219 --> 00:02:00,230
And justice shall flow like sewage.

15
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:22,349
This was his first murder
in a public place.

16
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:25,250
Did you get the security footage?

17
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:27,020
We're checking them right now.

18
00:02:27,349 --> 00:02:29,319
But there weren't any
near the back gate.

19
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:31,289
And there was no one in the church?

20
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,159
A woman said she saw
a suspicious person.

21
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,860
We are asking her some questions.

22
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:38,599
Sun Woo and Min Young,
you should go and listen.

23
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,030
Yes, sir.

24
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,710
He's getting bolder.

25
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,319
He doesn't seem to have been
influenced by the situation.

26
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,259
He's meticulous.

27
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:08,229
He suggests
his methods carefully...

28
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,300
as if he thinks of it as important
as the killing itself.

29
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:20,199
The pool of blood is
concentrated inside.

30
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,180
He must have covered him with cloth
after he killed him.

31
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:28,280
I didn't see his face.

32
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:32,150
He had a hood on.

33
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,789
His head had been lowered too.

34
00:03:35,219 --> 00:03:37,389
What made him look suspicious?

35
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,759
Something was off about him.

36
00:03:41,129 --> 00:03:44,530
I tried to talk to him as he was a
stranger who had come late at night.

37
00:03:45,229 --> 00:03:46,969
But he just stayed there.

38
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:51,370
I asked him if he was okay,

39
00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:54,009
but he just sat there.

40
00:03:56,409 --> 00:03:57,439
Did he...

41
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:00,610
show any reactions
when you talked to him?

42
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:03,979
That is...

43
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,419
It didn't seem like he was praying,

44
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,560
but he kept...

45
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:15,430
moving his fingers.

46
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:19,600
It looked like
he was playing a piano.

47
00:04:23,569 --> 00:04:26,300
He could have killed me, right?

48
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,870
Don't worry.

49
00:04:28,339 --> 00:04:31,540
The police will be protecting you
for a while.

50
00:04:32,379 --> 00:04:33,579
Thank you.

51
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,579
The culprit doesn't kill
random people.

52
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:40,019
He's only interested in people
that he has decided as a target.

53
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:44,220
Yes. These victims
must have been killed...

54
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:45,990
because of a similarity they had.

55
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,329
We need to find out what that is.

56
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:50,259
Yes, sir.

57
00:04:56,069 --> 00:04:57,399
Excuse me,

58
00:04:58,939 --> 00:05:00,670
but may I have a look at that?

59
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:14,589
Team Manager Kang, I was
researching the victims' past,

60
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:17,420
and I found out that
Father Han Sang Jin had been...

61
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:20,259
charged with child molestation
a year ago.

62
00:05:20,829 --> 00:05:22,189
Child molestation?

63
00:05:23,459 --> 00:05:24,529
What happened?

64
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:27,670
Many devotees started
a petition campaign,

65
00:05:27,769 --> 00:05:29,529
and they submitted it to the court.

66
00:05:29,899 --> 00:05:33,040
After that, the parents who had
reported it dropped the charges,

67
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,509
and he was found innocent.

68
00:05:36,339 --> 00:05:37,379
All right.

69
00:05:44,579 --> 00:05:47,220
I will go back into my office first.

70
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:48,720
I need to check something.

71
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,360
Go with Min Young.

72
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,430
Yes, sir.

73
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:57,259
- Yes, Hyun Jun?
- Nana.

74
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:01,300
I want to know if other victims
had been charged for something.

75
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:03,069
It's urgent.

76
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:06,399
In that case,
I'll research as fast as I can.

77
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,810
Okay.

78
00:06:10,709 --> 00:06:12,579
I will start with Kang Joon Seob.

79
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:15,110
All right.

80
00:06:15,649 --> 00:06:18,980
February 2015, he was charged
with dating violence,

81
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:21,319
but he was found innocent.

82
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:25,889
Han Ju Young worked at a daycare
center six years ago...

83
00:06:25,889 --> 00:06:28,430
and was charged for assaulting
a child which had resulted in death.

84
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:31,259
This isn't right.

85
00:06:31,629 --> 00:06:32,800
Was she acquitted?

86
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:34,600
Wait... Wait.

87
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:37,600
This is a different case.

88
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,810
In 2013, she was charged with
administration of...

89
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:43,339
methamphetamine
and ecstasy with her friends.

90
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:47,610
She was sentenced to one year
and a half of imprisonment...

91
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:49,879
and three years of probation
for violating the law on drugs.

92
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,579
This might actually
lead to something.

93
00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:00,060
Lee Hyun Jae, the taxi driver,
was charged with drunk driving.

94
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:02,089
And he was found innocent?

95
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:04,259
Yes, that's right.

96
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:08,199
He was found innocent during
his trial four months ago.

97
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:10,500
All right. Thank you.

98
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:18,839
Team Manager Kang.

99
00:07:21,449 --> 00:07:23,779
The victims have all been charged
with a serious murder...

100
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:25,750
but have been found innocent.

101
00:07:26,019 --> 00:07:27,490
Now we know...

102
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,420
the similarity that the victims had.

103
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,500
He was after the people...

104
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,100
who were found not guilty.

105
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:48,740
He didn't just put any stone
into the victim's ear.

106
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:49,810
There is a pattern on it.

107
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:50,839
A pattern?

108
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:54,879
This is the pattern that was on
the stone inside the victim's ear.

109
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:02,750
This is a "baraegi" pattern...

110
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:05,420
that was used to drive away
evil spirits since Unified Silla.

111
00:08:06,089 --> 00:08:07,730
- Baraegi?
- Yes.

112
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:10,459
It's also referred to as "Yacha"
or "goblin".

113
00:08:10,459 --> 00:08:11,529
I know this too.

114
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:15,069
This is like a guardian that
looks after the soul after death.

115
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:19,199
Yes, it was normally used
as a talisman.

116
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:22,970
They put it on roof tiles and
doorknobs of ancient monuments.

117
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:26,110
It's still being used
on modern buildings as well.

118
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,879
That means that the culprit...

119
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,379
considers the victims as evil
that he needs to conquer.

120
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,320
Yes.

121
00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:37,120
He planned every moment...

122
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:39,559
of his murder carefully.

123
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:43,360
The culprit attacks the victim
at once with a knife.

124
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:46,100
And then, he uses a blade
to make sure they're dead.

125
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,629
He also leaves a symbolic sign.

126
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,500
Then, he covers the eyes
of the victims.

127
00:08:53,269 --> 00:08:54,970
In cases like these,

128
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:57,379
the culprit's emotions
are excessively involved.

129
00:08:57,639 --> 00:09:00,440
They tend to express
the belief that they believe in.

130
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:03,379
That is why we need to focus
on the fact that the culprit...

131
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:07,179
covered the face of the victims
as if they were Lady Justice.

132
00:09:07,289 --> 00:09:09,490
This is closely related...

133
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:11,720
to his job.

134
00:09:11,889 --> 00:09:14,029
Lady Justice has its eyes covered...

135
00:09:14,029 --> 00:09:16,759
which signifies that the law
will be enforced...

136
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:19,659
regardless of social status
and wealth.

137
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:22,000
But unlike other countries,

138
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,370
the Lady Justice in front of
the Supreme Court in Korea...

139
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:25,700
doesn't have its eyes covered.

140
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:26,870
(We Should Cover the Eyes
of Lady Justice Right Now!)

141
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:30,779
It seems like he's trying to
express the unfairness...

142
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:32,580
of the judicial system in Korea.

143
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:37,250
The culprit, his family, or friends
could have been a victim...

144
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:40,149
of a serious crime.

145
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,490
It's likely that the culprit
is someone...

146
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:49,289
working for or near
the judicial system.

147
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:53,200
Then we will cross reference the
people working in the legal field...

148
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,529
and the victims who have been
involved in assault cases...

149
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:58,769
in the past.

150
00:09:58,769 --> 00:10:02,840
Even if we were right and
he is working in the legal field,

151
00:10:02,909 --> 00:10:05,710
he won't be noticeable.

152
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,159
The culprit knows...

153
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:30,629
that people don't really know
who he is.

154
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:38,539
His normal features
are the best shields...

155
00:10:38,539 --> 00:10:40,580
that help him protect himself.

156
00:10:41,549 --> 00:10:44,019
If the information we have gathered
goes public,

157
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:46,049
the culprit will only gain
more information.

158
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,490
Please make sure none of this
information leaks.

159
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:51,889
We have to make sure...

160
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:54,429
this doesn't go public
through the media.

161
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:56,929
If that happens, the culprit will...

162
00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:00,259
think that he has overpowered
the people by himself.

163
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:03,669
That confidence will only make him
kill more.

164
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,389
This is Yoo Min Young speaking.

165
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:30,460
Okay.

166
00:11:34,129 --> 00:11:36,000
Why, did something happen?

167
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:39,139
The culprit killed
another person again.

168
00:11:43,509 --> 00:11:45,210
This is the fifth victim.

169
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:48,549
It's a murder case from a year ago
at a bus terminal.

170
00:11:48,909 --> 00:11:51,250
A police was murdered...

171
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,419
after getting in a quarrel...

172
00:11:53,419 --> 00:11:55,289
and a physical fight
with a pedestrian.

173
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:58,019
The attacker Oh Jin Myung was found
not guilty,

174
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,059
and he was released.

175
00:12:00,059 --> 00:12:01,360
(Official documents regarding
Oh Jin Myung's case)

176
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,200
There was a witness testifying...

177
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,299
that Oh Jin Myung's behavior
was completely accidental.

178
00:12:06,429 --> 00:12:07,429
Her name is Han Seo Ra.

179
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,129
Because of her crucial testament,

180
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:12,240
Oh Jin Myung was found not guilty.

181
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:16,340
We will go and find out.

182
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:18,610
- Please back us up.
- Okay.

183
00:12:21,549 --> 00:12:22,950
You have to see this right now.

184
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:29,149
Do you remember the murder of
a taxi driver we reported yesterday?

185
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:31,120
It has been revealed
that this case...

186
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,690
had a similar context
as a vigilance murder...

187
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:37,460
like the homemaker murder case
that was reported a week ago...

188
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:40,629
and the dentist murder case.

189
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:42,929
It is interesting...

190
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:45,269
that the victims all had
court records...

191
00:12:45,269 --> 00:12:47,840
of past cases that caused
public rage.

192
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:51,539
It was revealed that they openly
enjoyed normal life...

193
00:12:51,539 --> 00:12:54,509
after they were all found
not guilty...

194
00:12:54,509 --> 00:12:58,419
from committing a felony.

195
00:12:58,419 --> 00:13:00,750
People are saying the culprit is
keeping justice for society...

196
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,820
when the law isn't doing that.

197
00:13:04,789 --> 00:13:08,090
Every station is broadcasting
this since the afternoon.

198
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,629
The culprit isn't...

199
00:13:11,129 --> 00:13:12,629
our only opponent now.

200
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,330
We will go to Han Seo Ra right away.

201
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,970
One day, heavy rain will fall...

202
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:23,570
and all trash will be washed away.

203
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:26,740
This is a line from the movie
"Taxi Driver".

204
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,909
People are even saying...

205
00:13:28,909 --> 00:13:32,450
that the police gave the culprit
an inside list of suspects.

206
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:34,690
Are you saying...

207
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:36,690
that someone leaked criminal records
to the media?

208
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:40,320
We know for sure that someone is
providing information to them.

209
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,330
Whoever that is,

210
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:44,799
that person must have free access
to court records.

211
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,370
Why aren't the culprits contacting
the media?

212
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:50,200
Culprits like this usually want...

213
00:13:50,299 --> 00:13:52,500
to be praised of their work.

214
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,970
That might not be important
to them right now.

215
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:57,610
They are still executing
their plan right now.

216
00:13:58,009 --> 00:13:59,340
They are going crazy
for this imaginary role...

217
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:02,850
such as "judge of justice" and
"cleaner of the streets"...

218
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:06,379
that people are calling them.

219
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:09,220
I will find some media records...

220
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:12,419
of controversial cases
that were ruled non-guilty.

221
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:14,629
I might be able
to point out victims...

222
00:14:14,629 --> 00:14:17,029
before the culprits do.

223
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:19,899
Team Manager Kang,
you need to see this first.

224
00:14:20,299 --> 00:14:23,669
About an hour ago, we started to
receive calls regarding information.

225
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,440
It is more serious than we expected.

226
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,039
I have some information.

227
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:29,669
What should I do to give
this information to the murderer?

228
00:14:29,669 --> 00:14:32,440
Why are the police trying
so hard to catch someone like this?

229
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,679
Are you jealous because they are
more competent than you are?

230
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:37,750
Help Min Young to find out...

231
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:40,350
who leaked the information
to the media.

232
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:44,590
Nana, please find out who released
this first, and report right away.

233
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:45,759
Yes, sir.

234
00:14:58,470 --> 00:14:59,669
Thank you.

235
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,669
Thank you.

236
00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:03,870
Thank you.

237
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:22,320
Let me go.

238
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,419
Are you okay?

239
00:16:23,419 --> 00:16:25,019
- Don't move.
- Let go.

240
00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:26,019
Don't move!

241
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:29,330
Let me go!

242
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,500
Stop.

243
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,470
Let me go.

244
00:16:34,899 --> 00:16:36,129
No.

245
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:39,039
Gong Hyung Kyu, 34 years old.

246
00:16:39,269 --> 00:16:41,809
He works as a private security guard
at a bank.

247
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:44,610
He was robbed last year,

248
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:46,879
so he received intensive care.

249
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:48,980
I think he started acting
strangely from that time.

250
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:51,549
He fits our profile.

251
00:16:51,549 --> 00:16:54,049
How is it going?

252
00:16:54,049 --> 00:16:56,090
He confessed every crime just now.

253
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:00,389
Why did you kill...

254
00:17:00,389 --> 00:17:01,830
Han Seo Ra when she has
no relation to you?

255
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:04,660
She deserved to die.

256
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,599
Why do you think so?

257
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,230
She received money to testify.

258
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:11,029
If she didn't do
a dirty deed like that,

259
00:17:11,029 --> 00:17:12,799
that man who killed
an innocent police...

260
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,569
wouldn't have been released.

261
00:17:14,769 --> 00:17:17,779
It is not your position to decide.

262
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:20,609
He lived a perfectly normal life...

263
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:23,509
after committing
an unforgivable crime...

264
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:26,049
and even boasted about it
like it was a heroic episode.

265
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:28,650
This world is...

266
00:17:29,789 --> 00:17:31,990
full of people who deserve to die.

267
00:17:32,589 --> 00:17:34,220
If you don't demonstrate like this,

268
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,430
people will suffer again one day.

269
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:40,700
It sounds...

270
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:44,970
like you are completely innocent.

271
00:17:45,569 --> 00:17:48,740
I did what I had to do.
It was obvious.

272
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:52,980
What did the taxi driver do wrong?

273
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:56,049
He ruined a family.

274
00:17:56,279 --> 00:17:57,609
He was drinking and driving.

275
00:17:57,609 --> 00:17:59,049
What about Han Sang Jin?

276
00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:01,819
He's not even human.

277
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:04,720
He violated children
that were like his daughter.

278
00:18:05,589 --> 00:18:07,059
He used their religion as a bait.

279
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:09,589
Is that why you stabbed his heart?

280
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:13,400
I regret killing him so simply...

281
00:18:14,029 --> 00:18:16,329
when I think of those children.

282
00:18:16,869 --> 00:18:18,569
I should have ripped
him into pieces...

283
00:18:19,569 --> 00:18:22,170
and choked him to give him pain.

284
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:23,170
Stop.

285
00:18:26,579 --> 00:18:28,009
I'll leave him to you.

286
00:18:34,049 --> 00:18:35,119
Gong Hyung Kyu.

287
00:18:37,619 --> 00:18:39,490
Were you that desperate
to become a star?

288
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,990
Or...

289
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:43,930
did you just kill everyone because
this was the chance to do so?

290
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,130
Come back to your senses.

291
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:49,400
You're going to regret imitating
them mindlessly.

292
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:54,240
Every one of the people I killed...

293
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,210
all deserved to die.

294
00:18:56,609 --> 00:18:59,140
I did everything. It was me.

295
00:18:59,339 --> 00:19:00,339
Me.

296
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:10,720
Gong Hyung Kyu is not related
to any of the other victims.

297
00:19:11,019 --> 00:19:15,259
I could provoke Han Gi Eun, who is
the reporter who first reported it.

298
00:19:15,789 --> 00:19:19,430
He reported articles daily
like it was an exclusive coverage.

299
00:19:19,829 --> 00:19:22,599
We could attract
the culprit from that.

300
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:25,369
- Let's meet him right away.
- Okay.

301
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:30,240
I searched the five victims
that were killed by the culprit.

302
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,680
There weren't any
overlapping points...

303
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:36,079
in the police who arrested them,

304
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:38,180
public defender, and prosecutor.

305
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:41,049
But it's confirmed that all of
the victims' cases were handled...

306
00:19:41,049 --> 00:19:43,450
at the Seoul Eastern District Court.

307
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:47,089
Okay, thank you.

308
00:19:49,329 --> 00:19:52,299
The NCI came to ask help from me.

309
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:55,069
Our team manager was busy,
so we came here instead.

310
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,529
Team Manager Kang Ki Hyung?

311
00:19:57,069 --> 00:19:58,900
It's such an honor.

312
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,970
He was on the high roll once.

313
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:03,410
It was even hard to get
an interview with him.

314
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:05,579
You also won't get one from him now.

315
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,180
Really?

316
00:20:07,509 --> 00:20:09,250
You must be really busy these days.

317
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:11,279
We also are as you can see.

318
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:13,750
Reporter Han.

319
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,019
("The cleaner of the streets
who took over the city")

320
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:19,890
You reported this case...

321
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:21,329
faster than anybody else.

322
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:24,730
You were even faster
than the police sometimes.

323
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:27,759
Where did you get the information?

324
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:30,700
Shouldn't you be faster
than the investigation...

325
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:33,839
if you're a good reporter?

326
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:39,309
I can help you if you want.

327
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:43,109
But I will have to meet
Team Manager Kang in person.

328
00:21:00,529 --> 00:21:02,029
We need to ask some questions.

329
00:21:02,029 --> 00:21:04,839
Please answer if you have anything
that comes to mind.

330
00:21:04,839 --> 00:21:06,200
The culprit would have been
usually quiet,

331
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:09,109
but would have displayed behavior
that stands out when in stress.

332
00:21:09,109 --> 00:21:10,869
Look at these papers.

333
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:14,509
It would be easier to find someone
who's not like that here.

334
00:21:25,089 --> 00:21:26,720
Wherever he is, he's not noticeable.

335
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,430
He will be like a ghost.

336
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:32,230
But he knows specific things
about cases.

337
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:36,329
He would have constant access
to crimes in any way.

338
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:40,940
It's highly possible that he gets
angry about crimes while he works.

339
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:50,150
If you talk about the well-known
crimes committed by vigilantes,

340
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:52,549
the culprit will have
a lenient perspective.

341
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:55,420
But he won't bring it up.

342
00:21:55,589 --> 00:21:58,019
Do you want an honest answer
from me?

343
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:03,059
This is a place where people dealing
with crimes work all day.

344
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:06,130
They won't be able to commit murder,

345
00:22:06,259 --> 00:22:09,230
but they would all want to punish
those who have...

346
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:13,170
better lives than us
although they have committed crimes.

347
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:17,470
Most of the people will have to
protect the culprits here.

348
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,640
Goodbye.

349
00:22:22,349 --> 00:22:26,119
(The Court Clerk)

350
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:29,319
How did you come up with the
hypothesis that it's a vigilante?

351
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:32,259
The culprit ensures
the safety of the people.

352
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:34,559
The safety of the people?

353
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:40,460
To be honest, it's true that
the police can't protect us.

354
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,970
The police can't establish
justice in the society...

355
00:22:44,299 --> 00:22:46,269
which is why the culprit
is doing it himself.

356
00:22:46,339 --> 00:22:50,640
Do you mean to say that the culprit
charged with murder is a hero?

357
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:54,609
People see things differently,
don't they?

358
00:22:54,809 --> 00:22:58,480
We need to hear more from you
about the victims.

359
00:22:59,319 --> 00:23:00,450
Here.

360
00:23:01,589 --> 00:23:02,650
This woman...

361
00:23:03,589 --> 00:23:05,859
was involved in a trivial case.

362
00:23:06,289 --> 00:23:09,890
Everyone was fooled by the lawyer
in the participatory trial...

363
00:23:10,029 --> 00:23:11,390
when he said that
addiction is also an illness.

364
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:16,299
And this man bought
the victim's family with money.

365
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:20,240
He had beaten up the woman
he was living with.

366
00:23:21,069 --> 00:23:23,039
He got tattoos all over her body
with his name.

367
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:24,410
But he was found not guilty.

368
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,579
How about Lee Hyun Jae?

369
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,180
It was drunk driving.

370
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,119
It was a tragedy,

371
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:34,380
but it can happen to anyone.

372
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:37,250
How about the culprit
we are looking for?

373
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:40,519
What do you think
has happened to him in the past?

374
00:23:40,859 --> 00:23:41,930
The culprit...

375
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:46,500
must have been involved
in a serious crime.

376
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,230
He would have been a victim.

377
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,970
It would have been more serious
than we think.

378
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,700
Is that...

379
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,539
why you think of him as a hero?

380
00:23:57,410 --> 00:23:58,410
Well.

381
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:03,109
Nowadays, we accept even
the strangest things.

382
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:07,720
It's true that the world
has become insane.

383
00:24:08,349 --> 00:24:11,349
No one can survive it
in their right minds.

384
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:16,890
This picture was not made public
by the media.

385
00:24:17,089 --> 00:24:19,500
This could make you a little
uncomfortable.

386
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:22,930
I'm accustomed to pictures
from crime scenes.

387
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,640
That's where we are stuck.

388
00:24:30,109 --> 00:24:33,240
Did he put that in to kill him
effectively,

389
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,950
or is it symbolic?

390
00:24:38,549 --> 00:24:39,680
It's interesting.

391
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:12,180
If it were you, why would you...

392
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:14,579
stab someone's ear with a stone?

393
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:17,250
Are you really asking this
because you need my help?

394
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:21,490
You made him...

395
00:25:22,029 --> 00:25:25,500
into a hero with ease.

396
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:26,900
So...

397
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:29,230
What is it you want to say?

398
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,630
Do you know...

399
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:34,569
that the emotions you experience
through serial killers...

400
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,940
are no different from killing?

401
00:25:39,509 --> 00:25:43,650
In fact, you would not have wanted
him to be caught for a while.

402
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:47,880
What happens to others
is none of your business, right?

403
00:25:51,289 --> 00:25:52,690
What are you doing?

404
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:56,529
If that's not the case, help us
find the culprit.

405
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:59,630
That's what you should really do.

406
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,430
Please cooperate with us.

407
00:26:02,869 --> 00:26:05,170
There has been an incident
at this court.

408
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:09,609
But these documents
are little strange.

409
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:18,109
The trial records of the victim,
Lee Hyun Jae, is missing.

410
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:20,380
Yes. According to the order,

411
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:23,150
there should be documents from
February 2017.

412
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:24,650
We should look into it.

413
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:28,259
Excuse me.

414
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:29,730
Yes?

415
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:31,230
Can you take a look at this?

416
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:33,299
Why can't we see records
from here?

417
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:38,769
It's because the court stenographer
hasn't interpreted it yet.

418
00:26:39,069 --> 00:26:41,299
Stenographer?

419
00:26:41,869 --> 00:26:45,809
We're also having trouble
because it's being delayed.

420
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:50,109
We did have a lot of work,
but he's on sick leaves often,

421
00:26:50,309 --> 00:26:53,380
and the interpretation work
has been delayed...

422
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:54,779
by 3 to 6 months.

423
00:26:58,490 --> 00:26:59,990
(Personal Information)

424
00:27:02,259 --> 00:27:03,490
(Personal Information)

425
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:06,700
(Personal Information)

426
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:11,400
(Pictures from the Crime Scene)

427
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:17,309
The victims have all been charged
with a serious murder,

428
00:27:17,309 --> 00:27:19,009
but have been found innocent.

429
00:27:19,009 --> 00:27:21,279
It's likely that the culprit
is someone...

430
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:24,279
working for or near
the judicial system.

431
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:26,180
He kept...

432
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:31,150
He kept moving his fingers.

433
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:32,890
It looked like
he was playing a piano.

434
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:39,960
Yes, Team Manager Kang.

435
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:42,200
Can you look into the stenographer
who was in charge...

436
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,000
of the records
of the victims' cases?

437
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,339
Yes, I will.

438
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:47,769
Stenographer?

439
00:27:47,869 --> 00:27:49,269
It's someone who's in the court...

440
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:51,640
and knows every specific details
about the case.

441
00:27:52,339 --> 00:27:54,009
Then that movement...

442
00:27:54,579 --> 00:27:57,180
He kept moving his fingers.

443
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:02,890
As he records violent and terrible
crimes every day,

444
00:28:04,019 --> 00:28:06,559
he could feel like he was the one
delivering the judgement.

445
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:10,960
That could have been
what intensified the trauma.

446
00:28:11,589 --> 00:28:14,859
Stenographers in the court
are like ghosts in the court.

447
00:28:15,329 --> 00:28:18,640
They just record the testimonies
of the court all day.

448
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:21,569
Where is he now?

449
00:28:24,339 --> 00:28:27,480
He should be in courtroom 412 now.

450
00:28:27,779 --> 00:28:29,349
That's the room we had visited.

451
00:28:32,019 --> 00:28:36,450
(The Court Clerk)

452
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:39,759
He would have heard everything.

453
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,700
The stenographer in charge of
the the victims' cases...

454
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:49,700
is Jung Do Il.

455
00:28:49,799 --> 00:28:54,369
Find out if he was involved
in any serious crimes in the past.

456
00:28:55,569 --> 00:28:57,869
In 2001, his family died...

457
00:28:57,869 --> 00:28:59,910
as a result of burglary.

458
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,880
He was only 15 years old then,

459
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,319
and he was the only survivor.

460
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:15,059
We're from NCI.

461
00:29:16,089 --> 00:29:20,099
Is the stenographer in charge
of this case called Jung Do Il?

462
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:23,599
No, he took a sick leave
and went home.

463
00:29:26,769 --> 00:29:29,970
He must have found out
that we're after him.

464
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:39,349
- Nana.
- Yes, Hyun Jun?

465
00:29:39,349 --> 00:29:41,519
Send us the address of Jung Do Il.

466
00:29:41,779 --> 00:29:43,250
Okay, I'll send it right away.

467
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:53,859
Team Manager Kang, his phone
is turned off.

468
00:29:54,829 --> 00:29:56,200
Do you think he went home?

469
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:58,569
Find out which case it was...

470
00:29:58,569 --> 00:30:01,500
that he finished interpreting
recently.

471
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:34,039
Jung Do Il will try to do his job...

472
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,069
until the end.

473
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:38,680
We need to find the victim that...

474
00:30:39,079 --> 00:30:40,740
he's after before he does.

475
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,940
Jung Do Il, this is the police!
Open the door.

476
00:31:38,329 --> 00:31:40,940
Do you think he wanted to prevent
someone coming from outside?

477
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:42,869
Jung Dong Il sat in court...

478
00:31:43,309 --> 00:31:45,140
and wrote in shorthand every day.

479
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,839
It must be that from one point,

480
00:31:48,309 --> 00:31:49,750
he couldn't stop talking...

481
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:53,279
even outside the court.

482
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:56,319
Apparently, he kept mumbling
even in the cathedral.

483
00:31:56,789 --> 00:31:58,250
He must have been compulsive,

484
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:00,390
and suffered from horrible auditory
hallucinations.

485
00:32:02,259 --> 00:32:04,089
This must be what...

486
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:05,599
the stone in the ears meant.

487
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:07,259
He wanted to return...

488
00:32:07,529 --> 00:32:09,970
the pain he'd suffered
to the victims.

489
00:32:25,079 --> 00:32:26,980
- Yes.
- Team Manager Kang.

490
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:29,920
I'm looking through Jung Do Il's
last shorthand court notes.

491
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:32,859
But none of the transcriptions for
recent victims...

492
00:32:32,859 --> 00:32:34,720
are up yet.

493
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,789
It's probably because the
situation has changed.

494
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:38,529
Now Jung Do Il, himself,

495
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,730
had to reach a verdict.

496
00:32:49,869 --> 00:32:51,970
That's the only photo.

497
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:55,210
His clock stopped ticking
after that day.

498
00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:58,920
This is his parents' life insurance
certificate.

499
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:01,150
He didn't even collect the benefits.

500
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:06,259
Yes.

501
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:08,829
I found the killer's past records.

502
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:11,460
Jung Do Il's father,
Jung Hyung Soo,

503
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:13,829
was a professor who taught
folklore.

504
00:33:14,529 --> 00:33:15,529
The murderer at the time...

505
00:33:15,529 --> 00:33:17,829
was a student of his,
Oh Kyeung Sub.

506
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:20,039
But...

507
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:07,480
at the time Oh Kyeung Sub's blood
alcohol level was 0.25 percent.

508
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:11,090
He claimed that Jung Hyung Soo
had abused him for years,

509
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:13,389
and suffered from psychological
damages as a result.

510
00:34:13,389 --> 00:34:15,389
He was sentenced to only 10 years.

511
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:18,800
And then, the sentence was
reduced to seven years.

512
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:23,369
Oh Kyeung Sub became religious
after being released from jail.

513
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:24,829
Right now,

514
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:27,070
he's abroad doing missionary work.

515
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:43,090
Team Manager Kang.

516
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:56,599
Does this mean he had this
many people to kill?

517
00:34:56,869 --> 00:34:58,400
He probably thought...

518
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,699
there was no stopping once
he'd started.

519
00:35:08,579 --> 00:35:11,110
The keyboard is so worn out that
the letters are erased.

520
00:35:12,579 --> 00:35:14,820
I can't understand what this means
at all.

521
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:17,949
This is an older version of
the shorthand keyboard.

522
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:22,590
In this case, stenographers use 36
letter and number keys...

523
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:25,829
to type as if playing harmonies
on the piano.

524
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,159
Depending on the stenographer,

525
00:35:27,159 --> 00:35:30,000
some even have their own
secret codes.

526
00:35:30,429 --> 00:35:33,239
Court stenographers in particular...

527
00:35:33,239 --> 00:35:35,570
mostly have their own unique system.

528
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:37,210
So other people can't decode it.

529
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:39,409
Jung Do Il...

530
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:42,380
probably knows that we're
looking for him right now.

531
00:35:43,679 --> 00:35:44,980
Where could he be?

532
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,849
We have to go inside his brain...

533
00:35:48,849 --> 00:35:49,989
and find out.

534
00:35:57,429 --> 00:35:59,400
There has to be an answer in here.

535
00:35:59,929 --> 00:36:03,769
Condense the list to
felons who were found not guilty.

536
00:36:04,769 --> 00:36:07,300
Considering how serious Jung
Do Il's murders are becoming,

537
00:36:07,539 --> 00:36:09,369
we should focus on violent crimes.

538
00:36:09,369 --> 00:36:11,739
Wouldn't it be faster to start
with the most recent cases?

539
00:36:11,739 --> 00:36:14,380
Jung Do Il has a neurotic
compulsion disorder.

540
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:16,449
People like him go to the
very beginning...

541
00:36:16,449 --> 00:36:18,010
to move onto the next job.

542
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:20,550
So we still have to rummage through
all of this.

543
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:22,590
Book bands.

544
00:36:24,889 --> 00:36:26,559
He marked it this way.

545
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,320
The traces are still here.

546
00:36:40,139 --> 00:36:43,440
Jung Do Il already knew
that we'd be here.

547
00:36:45,139 --> 00:36:46,539
If he got rid of the book bands...

548
00:36:46,539 --> 00:36:49,309
to get rid of evidence or to stop
us from finding him...

549
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:53,750
I have to look more into this.

550
00:36:55,690 --> 00:36:56,690
Nana.

551
00:36:56,989 --> 00:36:59,389
Yes, Hyun Jun.
What can I do for you?

552
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:03,030
Check court records for the dates
I'm about to tell you.

553
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,230
May 21, 2011,

554
00:37:10,199 --> 00:37:11,800
January 10, 2009,

555
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:15,070
September 24, 2014.

556
00:37:15,909 --> 00:37:16,909
Wait.

557
00:37:17,639 --> 00:37:18,639
Wait a moment.

558
00:37:19,139 --> 00:37:20,210
I remember.

559
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,710
It's the dates of the
victims' rulings.

560
00:37:23,309 --> 00:37:24,550
How many pages are there?

561
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:28,380
I found it.

562
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:30,550
In the court records of the dates
you gave me,

563
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:32,659
the five victims are included.

564
00:37:33,219 --> 00:37:34,820
They must be in here.

565
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:38,530
Wait.

566
00:37:39,199 --> 00:37:40,760
There's a murder case similar...

567
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:43,130
to that of Jung Do Il's family.

568
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,900
It happened in 2008.

569
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:48,469
Hwang In Chul who was in
high school at the time...

570
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:50,710
murdered his own parents.

571
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:54,440
He claimed to have suffered domestic
abuse for a long time...

572
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:57,179
and became mentally ill as a result.

573
00:37:57,179 --> 00:37:59,050
He was found not guilty
and let go.

574
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:02,789
I found it.

575
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:06,760
This was hidden in between
the drawers.

576
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,900
Jung Do Il's family was murdered...

577
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:21,940
by one of his father's students.

578
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:25,639
He must have thought that Hwang
In Chul, who killed his parents,

579
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:29,309
needed a new verdict
after being found not guilty.

580
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:58,610
The person you are trying to reach
is not available.

581
00:38:58,769 --> 00:39:00,440
Hwang In Chul isn't picking up.

582
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:03,050
And his wife Kang Ji Yeon
is still on the line.

583
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:04,980
Request emergency backup
to the local police station.

584
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:05,980
Okay.

585
00:39:14,989 --> 00:39:16,130
But I still bought it.

586
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:19,329
He deserves to die.
Kill him. Kill him.

587
00:39:36,409 --> 00:39:38,449
Okay. Hurry home.

588
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:46,360
(Emergency situation)

589
00:39:47,659 --> 00:39:50,960
- Hello?
- I'm Kang Ki Young from the NCI.

590
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,760
Is Hwang In Chul home?

591
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,599
He's not home right now.

592
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,900
What is this about?

593
00:40:06,409 --> 00:40:07,409
Where are you right now?

594
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:08,809
I was just on the phone with you.

595
00:40:09,579 --> 00:40:10,750
I'm in front of the house.

596
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:14,650
Honey, wait.

597
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:16,219
No, that's not it.

598
00:40:22,159 --> 00:40:23,360
I'll kill you.

599
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,530
In Chul!

600
00:40:25,659 --> 00:40:26,699
In Chul!

601
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:34,739
In Chul!

602
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:37,440
Don't come!

603
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:39,840
I'm going to kill him.

604
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:43,710
Let me go. He's my husband!

605
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:45,920
- Let me go!
- Don't come near me.

606
00:40:46,019 --> 00:40:48,150
In Chul! Mister, help me.

607
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:49,449
Help me!

608
00:40:49,449 --> 00:40:50,690
Do you see all those people?

609
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:53,090
Tell everyone here.

610
00:40:53,389 --> 00:40:55,090
How did you kill your parents again?

611
00:40:57,489 --> 00:40:59,329
He's my husband!

612
00:40:59,329 --> 00:41:03,530
Tell everyone that you shamelessly
lied to them.

613
00:41:03,730 --> 00:41:04,969
Tell them.

614
00:41:04,969 --> 00:41:05,969
I already...

615
00:41:06,739 --> 00:41:08,000
said everything then.

616
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,070
- No!
- Calm down.

617
00:41:10,639 --> 00:41:12,309
They kept hitting me.

618
00:41:12,469 --> 00:41:14,380
I had no choice!

619
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:16,710
Don't lie to me!

620
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:19,679
You repeatedly abused your parents.

621
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,750
Because of drugs, right?

622
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:23,989
You sold drugs!

623
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,219
And you still call yourself a son.

624
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:29,630
Your mom had to lie...

625
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:31,929
and say she did it instead of you.

626
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:35,869
She never knew her son would kill
her.

627
00:41:38,570 --> 00:41:41,099
Devils like you should never
have been born.

628
00:41:41,099 --> 00:41:42,500
Let me go!

629
00:41:53,650 --> 00:41:54,650
I'll go talk to him.

630
00:41:54,650 --> 00:41:56,019
He's too agitated.

631
00:41:56,519 --> 00:41:57,519
It's dangerous.

632
00:41:57,519 --> 00:41:58,849
We should still try.

633
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:00,019
Come with me.

634
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:04,730
Don't come here!

635
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,929
I'm not interested in you guys.

636
00:42:08,329 --> 00:42:09,329
Jung Do Il,

637
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:11,929
- let that go.
- No!

638
00:42:12,639 --> 00:42:13,969
I'm going to kill him.

639
00:42:13,969 --> 00:42:16,070
No, you can't!

640
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:18,010
Do you think he deserves to die?

641
00:42:18,010 --> 00:42:19,909
He should have died years ago.

642
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:23,409
He killed his parents,
but he's still here!

643
00:42:23,579 --> 00:42:25,010
I think so too.

644
00:42:27,449 --> 00:42:29,449
But it's not up to us...

645
00:42:29,449 --> 00:42:30,650
to kill him or let him live.

646
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,719
You think...

647
00:42:34,119 --> 00:42:36,289
a person like this deserves to live?

648
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:37,590
Jung Do Il.

649
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:41,960
We'll redo the whole investigation
on the crime he committed.

650
00:42:42,199 --> 00:42:43,269
I promise.

651
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:44,599
No.

652
00:42:45,369 --> 00:42:46,369
No!

653
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:50,269
It's up to me to punish
guys like this.

654
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:52,909
Get out of my way.

655
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:56,480
I'm going to kill him
and kill myself too!

656
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:00,980
Records show that Jung Do Il
repeatedly requested to meet...

657
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:03,449
the murderer who killed his parents.

658
00:43:04,289 --> 00:43:07,119
And the murderer Oh Kyeung Sub
only allowed it once...

659
00:43:07,389 --> 00:43:09,289
until he was released.

660
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:11,760
Then you will forever...

661
00:43:12,489 --> 00:43:15,030
lose the chance to find
out the truth.

662
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:17,670
Why did Oh Kyeung Sub...

663
00:43:18,469 --> 00:43:20,800
do that to your family?
For what reason?

664
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,869
That doesn't matter anymore.

665
00:43:24,570 --> 00:43:29,610
They were released because
of all of you here.

666
00:43:29,610 --> 00:43:31,280
I'm sorry.

667
00:43:33,519 --> 00:43:36,489
Please forgive me.

668
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:38,619
Forgive you?

669
00:43:38,619 --> 00:43:40,389
I repented to god.

670
00:43:42,090 --> 00:43:44,159
The lord forgave me.

671
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,260
I received forgiveness,
and I atoned.

672
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:52,170
Please don't come visit me.

673
00:43:53,099 --> 00:43:55,469
Only the lord can punish me.

674
00:44:01,579 --> 00:44:02,579
Hey.

675
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:06,019
Hey. What are you saying?

676
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:09,050
Hey!

677
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:11,920
Forgiveness?

678
00:44:12,090 --> 00:44:13,389
Forgiveness?

679
00:44:14,090 --> 00:44:15,289
Says who?

680
00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:18,530
Says who? Says who?

681
00:44:20,429 --> 00:44:21,659
Don't kid yourself.

682
00:44:22,199 --> 00:44:24,199
It's not the almighty who forgives.

683
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,590
Only public law shall be like water,
and justice shall flow like sewage.

684
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:47,219
Only public law shall be like water,
and justice shall flow like sewage.

685
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:49,730
Only public law shall be like water,
and justice shall flow like sewage.

686
00:44:49,829 --> 00:44:52,230
Only public law shall be like water,
and justice shall flow like sewage.

687
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:54,360
Only public law shall be like water,
and justice shall flow like sewage.

688
00:45:04,570 --> 00:45:06,940
Only public law shall be like water,
and justice shall flow like sewage.

689
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:09,280
Only public law shall be like water,
and justice shall flow like sewage.

690
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:51,219
Only public law shall be like water,
and justice shall flow like sewage.

691
00:46:04,699 --> 00:46:07,400
Only!

692
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:10,909
Only my judgement is the truth.

693
00:46:10,909 --> 00:46:12,610
Please don't kill me.

694
00:46:12,769 --> 00:46:13,940
Don't kill him!

695
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:16,449
Let go! Let me go!

696
00:46:16,449 --> 00:46:17,550
My son...

697
00:46:18,949 --> 00:46:21,079
She's pregnant with our child.

698
00:46:21,949 --> 00:46:24,320
No, it's too dangerous.

699
00:46:26,789 --> 00:46:29,989
Don't kill him. Please!

700
00:46:32,659 --> 00:46:34,360
Why you...

701
00:46:39,769 --> 00:46:40,769
- Oh my gosh!
- Goodness.

702
00:46:41,739 --> 00:46:42,769
- No!
- Goodness.

703
00:46:49,809 --> 00:46:50,809
Jung Do Il.

704
00:46:51,710 --> 00:46:52,750
Jung Do Il!

705
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:56,119
An ambulance! Bring an ambulance.

706
00:46:58,349 --> 00:47:00,960
Breathe. Breathe!

707
00:47:08,130 --> 00:47:09,130
I...

708
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:12,329
I just couldn't believe it.

709
00:47:13,369 --> 00:47:15,400
I couldn't believe that he
was fine living his life...

710
00:47:16,309 --> 00:47:18,809
after doing something so
horrible like that.

711
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:27,280
Jung Do Il.

712
00:47:28,050 --> 00:47:29,219
Jung Do Il!

713
00:47:38,989 --> 00:47:40,260
Are you okay?

714
00:47:50,469 --> 00:47:52,170
This is judgement by justice.

715
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:54,510
No!

716
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:55,940
- Let go!
- Hey!

717
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:57,510
- You!
- Take him!

718
00:47:57,579 --> 00:47:58,909
Let me go!

719
00:47:59,110 --> 00:48:00,980
- Ambulance!
- No!

720
00:48:01,650 --> 00:48:03,150
Let me go!

721
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:04,889
No!

722
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:06,150
Let go!

723
00:48:07,289 --> 00:48:08,460
- Ambulance!
- No!

724
00:48:10,659 --> 00:48:12,289
- Ambulance!
- What do I do!

725
00:48:12,289 --> 00:48:13,699
No!

726
00:48:16,699 --> 00:48:18,670
"I am against violence..."

727
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:21,269
"because even if it seems
to serve a greater good,"

728
00:48:21,539 --> 00:48:23,539
"it in itself is only temporary."

729
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:27,739
"As long as violence exists,
evil will persist forever."

730
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:29,210
Gandhi.

731
00:48:31,409 --> 00:48:34,179
What do you think about
the recent incident?

732
00:48:34,179 --> 00:48:35,550
He deserved to die.

733
00:48:35,550 --> 00:48:37,289
I think violent criminals...

734
00:48:37,489 --> 00:48:39,289
deserve to suffer through
the same thing.

735
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:41,559
I would have done the same thing.

736
00:48:41,619 --> 00:48:44,659
To be honest, the reality is
that you can't trust the law.

737
00:48:44,659 --> 00:48:48,829
This is terrifying. What do I tell
my children?

738
00:48:49,730 --> 00:48:50,929
I have no idea.

739
00:48:50,929 --> 00:48:52,570
Still, murder is wrong.

740
00:48:52,670 --> 00:48:54,239
He's a murderer.

741
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:57,110
He was executed in his own way.

742
00:48:57,110 --> 00:48:58,840
In some way, he's a hero.

743
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:00,380
Didn't the police shoot
him on purpose?

744
00:49:00,639 --> 00:49:02,039
I read online that...

745
00:49:02,039 --> 00:49:04,610
he was shot dead because they
thought he'd be found guilty.

746
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:11,519
Yes.

747
00:49:12,190 --> 00:49:14,820
Do you think Hwang In Chul's
murderer will get a jail sentence?

748
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:16,119
Yes.

749
00:49:16,630 --> 00:49:19,590
He had no relations to
Hwang In Chul.

750
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:22,329
He was only a copycat killer...

751
00:49:23,030 --> 00:49:24,269
who empathized with Jung Do Il.

752
00:49:24,530 --> 00:49:27,699
I think the media is steering this
case into a weird direction.

753
00:49:28,070 --> 00:49:30,469
I was spooked watching
the street interviews.

754
00:49:31,139 --> 00:49:34,880
The law can't do its job,
so the world is going insane.

755
00:49:36,579 --> 00:49:37,880
To be honest, even I...

756
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:40,719
have frequent moments when I want
to use my fist instead of the law.

757
00:49:41,349 --> 00:49:43,590
The public must feel more so.

758
00:49:44,519 --> 00:49:48,619
The problem is that he crossed
a line he shouldn't have crossed.

759
00:49:54,230 --> 00:49:55,230
Do you want to go for a drink?

760
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:01,739
Sure, let's.

761
00:50:18,019 --> 00:50:21,659
(Seoul Station)

762
00:50:26,699 --> 00:50:28,429
It's not too heavy? You're okay?

763
00:50:28,929 --> 00:50:30,469
That's good.

764
00:50:30,769 --> 00:50:31,829
Yes, Team Manager Kang.

765
00:50:32,829 --> 00:50:34,099
The trip was nice.

766
00:50:34,539 --> 00:50:37,409
The food was good, and
our hotel was comfortable.

767
00:50:38,670 --> 00:50:39,739
The kids?

768
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:42,380
- Auntie.
- Yes.

769
00:50:42,739 --> 00:50:46,280
Why are those guys sleeping there?
They don't have a home?

770
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:47,349
Well,

771
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:49,889
they might not have a home,

772
00:50:49,889 --> 00:50:52,920
or they might not be able to go
into their home.

773
00:50:53,090 --> 00:50:55,260
Why can't they go home?

774
00:50:55,659 --> 00:50:58,329
Well, I'm not sure.

775
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:02,960
Oh, right! We were going to
get some food, right?

776
00:51:03,199 --> 00:51:04,369
Shall we?

777
00:51:04,369 --> 00:51:06,230
I'm so hungry. Let's go.

778
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:08,969
Kids, here's some pasta. Eat this.

779
00:51:08,969 --> 00:51:10,909
Okay.

780
00:51:19,949 --> 00:51:21,380
Good times.

781
00:51:24,949 --> 00:51:28,590
Min Young, you've been surfing
on the web this whole time.

782
00:51:28,590 --> 00:51:30,190
What's going on?

783
00:51:31,190 --> 00:51:33,530
My landlord is talking about
my lease.

784
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:37,929
I feel like it might be better to
just buy my own house these days.

785
00:51:39,329 --> 00:51:41,969
You'll sign your name, but
the bank owns your house.

786
00:51:42,139 --> 00:51:43,409
That's pointless.

787
00:51:44,210 --> 00:51:45,210
Min Young,

788
00:51:45,710 --> 00:51:48,909
I've been working too hard
these days.

789
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:52,579
All I have is my looks and money.

790
00:51:52,809 --> 00:51:54,320
But I don't have anything
to spend it on.

791
00:51:54,849 --> 00:51:56,920
I don't have a husband to feed,

792
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:58,820
or cute children.

793
00:51:59,550 --> 00:52:01,519
This is all for Ha Eun's sake.

794
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:03,630
How much do you need?

795
00:52:04,690 --> 00:52:05,929
How much?

796
00:52:05,929 --> 00:52:07,760
Thanks, but I can't.

797
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:09,929
Min Young, life is all about timing.

798
00:52:09,929 --> 00:52:13,000
Being too square is a shortcut
to suffering.

799
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:14,840
Life isn't much.

800
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,639
You help each other out,

801
00:52:16,639 --> 00:52:19,809
rely on one another, and make
each other uncomfortable at times.

802
00:52:21,010 --> 00:52:24,150
I told you. All I have is money.

803
00:52:24,510 --> 00:52:26,150
Oh, and my looks too.

804
00:52:27,449 --> 00:52:30,349
Han Byul, give me some too.

805
00:52:32,250 --> 00:52:34,389
Hey, lady.

806
00:52:34,690 --> 00:52:36,789
- What?
- Come here.

807
00:52:37,829 --> 00:52:39,429
What's up with her?

808
00:52:39,429 --> 00:52:41,960
Well, he's just...

809
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:42,960
No, that's not it.

810
00:53:05,389 --> 00:53:06,820
You...

811
00:53:11,059 --> 00:53:12,360
My bad.

812
00:53:15,829 --> 00:53:17,369
National house prices have
surpassed...

813
00:53:17,369 --> 00:53:20,400
the average of 300,000 dollars
for the first time ever.

814
00:53:20,670 --> 00:53:21,900
According to the Bank of Korea,

815
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:25,010
the average of house prices,
including those of apartments,

816
00:53:25,010 --> 00:53:28,440
and houses was 330,000 dollars
this month.

817
00:53:28,510 --> 00:53:32,079
- Compared to last year...
- The place is so well decorated.

818
00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:34,619
This place must be expensive.
Right?

819
00:53:37,849 --> 00:53:40,619
But can you work here?

820
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:43,429
How is it?
You like this place?

821
00:53:44,289 --> 00:53:47,000
It is quite special,

822
00:53:47,730 --> 00:53:49,260
but I've never been to
a place like this.

823
00:53:51,030 --> 00:53:52,369
Should we have dinner first?

824
00:53:53,469 --> 00:53:55,570
There's food?

825
00:54:09,989 --> 00:54:11,519
I feel funny.

826
00:54:11,519 --> 00:54:12,650
You're fine.

827
00:54:12,849 --> 00:54:14,960
You'll feel better.

828
00:54:15,389 --> 00:54:17,630
No, but my head really hurts.

829
00:54:17,789 --> 00:54:20,429
You'll feel happy.

830
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,659
Are you sure you didn't
drug my drink?

831
00:54:25,869 --> 00:54:27,940
You must have.

832
00:54:37,449 --> 00:54:39,650
Where are you going?

833
00:55:05,769 --> 00:55:07,280
(Top one percent land
for the one percent!)

834
00:55:11,050 --> 00:55:12,449
(Submissions over)

835
00:55:12,449 --> 00:55:15,280
(Submissions over)

836
00:55:17,849 --> 00:55:21,389
Daedong Dream Village's biggest
strength is how efficient...

837
00:55:21,389 --> 00:55:24,360
the space is in consideration
to how people move around.

838
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:26,860
The space feels much bigger than
it actually is.

839
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:28,630
You can tell after seeing it, right?

840
00:55:28,630 --> 00:55:30,300
This size is most popular
these days, right?

841
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:32,530
- Yes.
- Take your time.

842
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:37,570
It would be so nice if the
kitchen always looked like this.

843
00:55:37,639 --> 00:55:40,409
Exactly. I'm sick of cleaning up.

844
00:55:40,409 --> 00:55:42,039
But look at how real the props look.

845
00:55:42,039 --> 00:55:44,550
They put so much care into
arranging showrooms these days.

846
00:55:45,650 --> 00:55:47,280
This isn't fake.

847
00:55:47,619 --> 00:55:48,679
- Really?
- No.

848
00:56:00,260 --> 00:56:01,860
(Lee Jin Hee)

849
00:56:04,269 --> 00:56:07,199
A woman was found murdered at
a showroom for Dream Village...

850
00:56:07,199 --> 00:56:09,400
in Moktan, Gyeonggi Province.

851
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:11,969
The victim's name is Lee Jin Hee.
She's 26 years old.

852
00:56:11,969 --> 00:56:14,510
She worked at a design firm.

853
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:18,010
And 24-year-old Yoo Ah Young.

854
00:56:18,050 --> 00:56:21,349
Likewise, she was found dead in a
showroom for Palace Town...

855
00:56:21,349 --> 00:56:23,079
in Gaesun-dong, Seoul.

856
00:56:23,789 --> 00:56:27,320
Both murders occurred in a showroom,

857
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:29,860
and the weapon use is similar too.

858
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:31,190
Considering the murder location,

859
00:56:31,190 --> 00:56:33,730
either the killer abducted
the victims,

860
00:56:33,730 --> 00:56:36,829
or lured them there.

861
00:56:37,829 --> 00:56:40,139
No traces of sexual assault
were found.

862
00:56:41,340 --> 00:56:42,869
According the police report,

863
00:56:42,869 --> 00:56:46,809
the killer used utensils in the
kitchen to cook and drink.

864
00:56:47,039 --> 00:56:48,480
After watching TV,

865
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:51,380
he even put in bath bombs to
take a bath...

866
00:56:51,380 --> 00:56:54,519
as if that was his home.

867
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:58,349
Why would anyone do that
in a showroom?

868
00:56:58,349 --> 00:57:00,119
A showroom...

869
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:02,159
is the manifestation
of the perfect home.

870
00:57:02,159 --> 00:57:05,360
The killer may obsess over
such fantasies and ideals.

871
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:09,159
Sun Woo and Hyun Jun,
go take a look at the crime scene.

872
00:57:09,159 --> 00:57:12,269
Nana, look closely...

873
00:57:12,269 --> 00:57:14,340
into if there were any similar
cases in the past.

874
00:57:14,340 --> 00:57:17,309
We can go through the records
from the first murder.

875
00:57:17,309 --> 00:57:18,670
- Yes.
- Okay.

876
00:57:21,610 --> 00:57:23,679
(Apartment construction approved)

877
00:57:56,949 --> 00:58:00,079
Undigested food was found
in the victim's stomach.

878
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:03,619
She ate here with the culprit.

879
00:58:41,989 --> 00:58:44,190
She ate here with the culprit.

880
00:58:44,230 --> 00:58:45,960
The floors are clean without
a single trace.

881
00:58:46,030 --> 00:58:47,559
Something doesn't fit.

882
00:58:47,630 --> 00:58:49,599
The showroom location...

883
00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:51,170
may be the culprit's signature.

884
00:58:51,269 --> 00:58:53,070
Save me!

885
00:58:53,269 --> 00:58:56,170
It's likely that the culprit worked
on construction sites.

886
00:58:56,170 --> 00:58:59,309
He's probably finding his own
way through the murders.

887
00:58:59,610 --> 00:59:02,210
Then the pattern may accelerate.

888
00:59:02,210 --> 00:59:04,110
Don't kill me.

889
00:59:04,210 --> 00:59:05,679
I haven't even started.

890
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:07,719
He won't give up on his fantasies.

891
00:59:07,780 --> 00:59:09,750
So he will kill again.
