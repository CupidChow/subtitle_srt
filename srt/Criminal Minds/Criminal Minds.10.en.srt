00:00:56,359 --> 00:00:59,929
I'll confirm the reports we received
one more time.

11
00:01:00,829 --> 00:01:01,829
I...

12
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:05,340
went to a shopping mall last year
to celebrate the first year...

13
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:07,239
anniversary of the company.

14
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:12,480
There were a lot of sales
going on.

15
00:01:13,579 --> 00:01:14,609
My goodness.

16
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:16,079
Sang Hyun.

17
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:17,219
Sang Hyun.

18
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:20,049
Jung Min.

19
00:01:21,019 --> 00:01:23,150
Jung Min. Jung Min.

20
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:25,319
Jung Min. Jung Min.

21
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:30,329
Jung Min.

22
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:33,159
Jung Min.

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,329
Over there.

24
00:01:36,939 --> 00:01:39,700
Do you remember the face?

25
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,609
I was out of my mind,

26
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:44,010
so I didn't even see his face.

27
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,340
But...

28
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:49,150
the woman I saw
at the shopping mall...

29
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:51,349
was a young woman.

30
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:55,689
I think she was mid 30s.

31
00:01:56,859 --> 00:01:59,760
I think she's the one who kidnapped
Jin Woo and Yu Na.

32
00:02:03,859 --> 00:02:04,930
Jung Min.

33
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:08,729
Do you remember what happened
in the car on that day?

34
00:02:14,539 --> 00:02:15,569
Okay.

35
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:20,680
Then can you remember
the driver's face?

36
00:02:23,379 --> 00:02:24,919
You didn't see his face?

37
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,650
It wasn't a man.

38
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:33,389
Then was it a woman?

39
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:46,169
Jung Min. I'll show you pictures.

40
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:48,169
Tell me if you recognize them.

41
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,139
Him.

42
00:03:00,819 --> 00:03:02,020
Did you see him?

43
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:13,530
I think we found another accomplice.

44
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,110
Criminals must have accepted
Jin Woo as their family.

45
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:24,840
Why do you think Jin Woo didn't
run away?

46
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:27,180
He helped other children run away,

47
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,879
but why would he go back to them?

48
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,319
As he was abused and raised by them,

49
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:33,819
he's probably showing signs of
Stockholm syndrome.

50
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:37,120
Then he considers himself as an
accomplice without realizing it.

51
00:03:38,189 --> 00:03:40,990
Or maybe the criminals
have Limas syndrome.

52
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:44,430
Three of them consider each other
as their family...

53
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:46,400
and continue to commit crimes.

54
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:48,900
One thing for sure is that...

55
00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:50,840
Jin Woo probably suffered...

56
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,909
from double emotions he can't
embrace at a young age.

57
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,280
Jung Min.

58
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:07,789
Jung Min.

59
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:10,120
Jung Min. Jung Min.

60
00:04:10,389 --> 00:04:11,560
Jung Min.

61
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:13,590
Mom.

62
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,569
Mom.

63
00:04:25,569 --> 00:04:27,310
Jung Min.

64
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:30,480
Jung Min.

65
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:38,879
Mom.

66
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:42,649
- Mom.
- Go. Hurry up.

67
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:45,160
When we see that he released
Jung Min at the last minute,

68
00:04:45,259 --> 00:04:48,060
maybe he's not running away...

69
00:04:48,259 --> 00:04:50,759
because he thinks he needs to
save the other children.

70
00:04:53,829 --> 00:04:56,569
Jin Woo is probably aware
that other children will be...

71
00:04:56,569 --> 00:04:59,600
in danger if he goes out
of their control.

72
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:08,079
He probably had to pay for it too
from time to time.

73
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,850
How did the criminals...

74
00:05:11,449 --> 00:05:13,120
observe and target...

75
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,250
so many children...

76
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,160
without getting caught?

77
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,490
According to the profile,

78
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:21,930
there's no connection or similarity
between the missing children.

79
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:24,000
Except for the fact that they're all
from the same region,

80
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,500
they are all different ages.

81
00:05:25,899 --> 00:05:28,970
There's no similar interest
between the parents.

82
00:05:29,569 --> 00:05:30,839
There must be something.

83
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:32,699
We're missing it.

84
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:36,939
There must be some ties between
the children and the criminals.

85
00:05:36,939 --> 00:05:40,850
Team Manager Kang. The parents
gathered at the meeting room.

86
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,879
But there's a problem.

87
00:05:45,449 --> 00:05:46,449
Hey.

88
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:51,060
Is it true that your son is
their accomplice?

89
00:05:53,189 --> 00:05:55,430
Tell me. Is it true?

90
00:05:55,629 --> 00:05:57,759
Why aren't you talking?
Speak!

91
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:58,759
Hold on.

92
00:05:59,129 --> 00:06:00,970
I don't know what you've heard,

93
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:02,100
but you must stop.

94
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:03,870
Then is it false?

95
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:06,399
I heard it clearly...

96
00:06:06,939 --> 00:06:08,870
that her son is their accomplice.

97
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:11,709
If any of our children are hurt
or something happens to them...

98
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:14,649
because of your son,

99
00:06:15,449 --> 00:06:17,449
I won't let you stay alive.

100
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:19,980
- Right.
- I won't let you get away with it.

101
00:06:21,019 --> 00:06:23,519
What moved us and you at first...

102
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:24,990
was her.

103
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:28,189
We're not here...

104
00:06:28,189 --> 00:06:30,860
to attack or protect anyone.

105
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:33,699
Anyone who will not cooperate
with us...

106
00:06:34,329 --> 00:06:36,170
can leave now.

107
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:38,839
Honey. No.

108
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:43,509
You need to cheer up.

109
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:47,550
Don't listen to what they say.

110
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,720
What they said is right.

111
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:56,889
At first,

112
00:06:59,089 --> 00:07:02,029
I was so excited about the fact
that Jin Woo was alive,

113
00:07:03,899 --> 00:07:06,160
so I forgot there were other people.

114
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,170
I didn't care...

115
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:17,279
whether Jin Woo was their accomplice
or not.

116
00:07:17,709 --> 00:07:19,339
Don't blame yourself.

117
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:22,209
Right now,

118
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:26,050
Jin Woo is trying his best
to see you.

119
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:30,050
So you need to...

120
00:07:31,089 --> 00:07:33,589
focus on meeting him again.

121
00:07:35,459 --> 00:07:36,490
But...

122
00:07:38,029 --> 00:07:41,569
I'm just so happy that
Jin Woo is still alive.

123
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:51,139
Okay. Great.

124
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:53,610
Check this out.

125
00:07:55,449 --> 00:07:58,379
If they were able to watch...

126
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,490
the children for a long time
without getting any suspicion,

127
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:04,560
they're probably well aware
of the children's psychology.

128
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,600
Nana.

129
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,670
What?

130
00:08:27,009 --> 00:08:29,750
Team Manager Kang.
We just found something.

131
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:36,820
Yu Na followed the silver car
in the surveillance camera...

132
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,360
for this.

133
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:39,889
Take a close look.

134
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:43,899
This was on...

135
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:45,600
at Yu Na's eye level.

136
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:51,269
Animal Welfare Association?

137
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Yes.

138
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,980
(Song Min Soo)

139
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:08,789
Yes. He's the one.

140
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:12,059
He was really nice to Yu Na.

141
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:14,090
Yu Na loves puppies,

142
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:17,090
so we went to their festival.

143
00:09:17,529 --> 00:09:20,460
Didn't you say Yu Na has an allergy?

144
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:23,730
Did Yu Na have a pet?

145
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,500
No. She can't have
any cats or dogs...

146
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,710
because of the allergy.

147
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:30,210
She can't even go near them.

148
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:36,149
The one with the allergy
was you, not Yu Na.

149
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:39,279
Yes, it was me.

150
00:09:40,889 --> 00:09:43,450
Team Manager Kang, most of
the parents with missing children...

151
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:46,220
have been to a conference held by...

152
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:48,230
the Animal Welfare Association.

153
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:50,490
They held the conference
every year...

154
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:53,000
and could easily get access
to their targets.

155
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:55,399
They would choose a target...

156
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:57,899
among the children who have
participated, and kidnap them.

157
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:01,470
I think we found the connection
between the culprits and the kids.

158
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:03,980
We will head to
Song Min Soo's office first.

159
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:10,350
Is there a problem?

160
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,220
But why did they...

161
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:16,190
kidnap children from a public place,

162
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:19,360
when they could have done it
secretly?

163
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:21,190
On September 9,

164
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:22,759
- at Songin Amusement Park...
- I'll visit the shelter and leave.

165
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,659
- Hwang Yu Na, a six-year-old girl,
- All right. Goodbye.

166
00:10:24,659 --> 00:10:26,259
- unfortunately went missing.
- Goodbye.

167
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,700
It's been six days
since she disappeared.

168
00:10:30,169 --> 00:10:33,039
Yu Na's parents are
having a hard time...

of every employee here.

172
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,679
Did you find something?

173
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:27,019
Take a look at him.

174
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,720
The wrinkles near his eyes
are there,

175
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:32,159
but his smile looks awkward.

(Campaign Activity Plan,

177

Manager Jang Jin Hwan?

178
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,769
Do you remember what Min Young
told us about hoarders?

179
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:50,570
Maybe the culprit collects children
like one might collect dolls?

180
00:12:51,409 --> 00:12:54,250
There's a study that says victims
of sexual or violent abuse...

181
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,980
collect alternative items...

182
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,179
to avoid their own anxiety.

183
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,549
They become a hoarder of sorts.

184
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:03,250
It's one of their
characteristics to...

185
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:04,860
repeatedly stack...

186
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:06,889
their belongs or trash.

187
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:14,299
All right.

from the past as soon as possible.

(Message from Ms. Hwang)

190
00:13:30,649 --> 00:13:33,179
He only has a sister
called Lee Sang Hee.

191
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:35,549
Why do they have different surnames
if they are brother and sister?

192
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:39,590
Is there a record of Jang Jin Hwan
being adopted...

193
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:42,190
when he was young?

194
00:13:42,629 --> 00:13:45,460
Yes. He was adopted
when he was seven,

195
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:50,129
and Lee Sang Hee was also adopted
to the same house when she was five.

- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

197
00:13:54,409 --> 00:13:56,139
They were adopted to Mo Young Sook,

198
00:13:56,139 --> 00:13:57,980
an owner of a boutique.

199
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,240
- Mom.
- Lee Sang Hee...

200
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,509
requested a change of her surname
to her original one.

201
00:14:01,509 --> 00:14:03,850
- Stand up. Stand up.
- Mom.

202
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:07,450
- Please forgive us. I'm sorry.
- Mom.

203
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:09,450
Go inside.

204

(To Jang Jin Hwan)

205
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,750
Have you seen him before?

206
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:38,850
Yes, I have.

207
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:42,590
He comes here often
to collect mails.

208
00:14:43,789 --> 00:14:46,419
Then he doesn't live here?

209
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,730
No.

210
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:51,659
Team Manager Kang, I think
there is another place...

211
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:53,129
where he hides the children.

212
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:56,629
I found something strange after
looking at his family records...

213
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:58,940
that you requested. Look here.

214
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:01,169
(Child Abuse Crime History Records,
Report on Incidents)

215
00:15:01,169 --> 00:15:04,240
He's been hospitalized for
broken bones a few times.

216
00:15:04,809 --> 00:15:06,940
The neighbors reported the family
a few times too.

217
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:08,779
But they were found innocent.

218
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:11,580
These two have been
abused and assaulted...

219
00:15:12,019 --> 00:15:13,720
by their parents frequently.

220
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,289
In 1982, Jang Jin Hwan was found
at an amusement park...

221
00:15:16,289 --> 00:15:18,490
after his parents left him.

222
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,090
Mom.

223
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,799
Mom.

224
00:15:26,029 --> 00:15:27,730
Mom.

225
00:15:28,769 --> 00:15:30,169
Mom.

226
00:15:31,269 --> 00:15:32,799
That's why...

227
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,639
they chose the amusement park.

228
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:37,370
These two are using the children...

229
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:39,840
to reflect their past.

230
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:43,110
They wanted the children
to experience...

231
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:44,750
what they had to go through.

232
00:16:05,769 --> 00:16:08,570
And while searching about
Lee Sang Hee,

233
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:11,139
I found a writing she wrote to
accuse a hospital...

234
00:16:11,139 --> 00:16:14,080
after getting an abortion
from that hospital.

235
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:15,309
Here.

238
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:27,389
(Arim Obstetrics)

239
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:29,360
It's the lyrics of a Japanese song.

240
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:32,500
Its title can be translated into
"A Cheap Flower",

241
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,000
meaning cheap and useless.

242
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:38,399
It can also mean a hand that can be
sold for a cheap price.

243
00:16:38,669 --> 00:16:40,399
It became a song called...

244
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,509
"Why Did You Come to My House?"
in Korea.

245
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:45,580
This must be a song that
her step-mother...

246
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:48,080
would have sung to her
whenever she abused her.

247
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,419
If these two people had no one else
to lean on while they were abused,

248
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,450
and together since they were young,

249
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:55,750
everything they did makes sense.

250
00:16:56,289 --> 00:16:59,490
They were registered as family,

251
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:02,259
but in fact, they were a couple.

252
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:04,960
Where would they have
hidden the children?

253
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,829
The place where they were abused
as children.

That's the address.

It's the neighborhood
where Yoon Seok Ho lives.

263
00:17:43,369 --> 00:17:46,500
Lee Sang Hee and Jang Jin Hwan
must have killed the stepparents...

264
00:17:46,869 --> 00:17:49,240
to make the house
into a space of their own.

265
00:17:50,009 --> 00:17:52,039
And they have done the very thing...

266
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:54,849
that they blame their parents for.

267
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:11,089
Why did you come to my house?

268
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,500
Why did you come to my house?

269
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,369
I've come to find a flower

270
00:18:18,369 --> 00:18:21,640

We're here to investigate

We'll take a look around.

275
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,720
There are many children.

276
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:44,019
Yes. Right.

277
00:19:47,259 --> 00:19:49,490
Are you a member of
Animal Welfare Association?

278
00:19:51,259 --> 00:19:54,299
But I don't see any cats of dogs
in the house.

279
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:57,529
Children in the picture don't
seem to look alike.

280
00:19:58,299 --> 00:19:59,500
So?

281
00:20:00,539 --> 00:20:02,140
Where are the children?

282
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:05,440
Their mom took them out.

283
00:20:06,579 --> 00:20:07,839
You know,

284
00:20:08,309 --> 00:20:11,079
it's not easy to be a good mother.

285
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,990

Be quiet.

Hey, where is he?

306
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:55,279
He should be out by now.

307
00:22:55,279 --> 00:22:57,410
I told you to keep an eye on him!

308
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:51,069
There's a surveillance camera
by the door.

309
00:23:51,069 --> 00:23:52,470
Get someone to watch it.

310
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,170
Lee Sang Hee might have escaped
with the children.

311
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:56,410
Yes.

There's an exit to the back door
in the basement.

316
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:03,569
It looks like Lee Sang Hee took
the children with her.

317
00:26:05,069 --> 00:26:06,069
Hello?

318
00:26:07,069 --> 00:26:08,910
- Yes. It's me.
- Captain.

319

I am afraid.

00:30:09,809 --> 00:30:11,410
It's been over eight years.

335
00:30:12,819 --> 00:30:13,980
What if...

336
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,119
Jin Woo doesn't recognize me?

337
00:30:19,259 --> 00:30:23,029
He'd have missed you
like you missed him.

338
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:25,259
Don't worry.

339
00:30:36,539 --> 00:30:37,609
Ms. Oh.

340
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:41,809
Ms. Oh, I am so anxious.

341
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:45,109
No one mentioned anything
about Hee Jae.

342
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:48,849
Gosh.

343
00:30:56,789 --> 00:30:57,789
They're here.

344
00:32:15,339 --> 00:32:16,869
Do you recognize me?

345
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,250
Mom.

346
00:32:24,049 --> 00:32:25,049
Yes.

347
00:32:25,349 --> 00:32:26,579
Where's Hee Jae?

348
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:28,690
Where is Hee Jae?

349
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:30,750
Why isn't Hee Jae coming?

350
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:32,720
Why isn't Hee Jae coming?

351
00:32:35,059 --> 00:32:39,259
Everyone is here.
Why isn't Hee Jae here?

352
00:32:39,259 --> 00:32:40,759
Why?

353
00:32:45,339 --> 00:32:46,869
- Mom.
- No.

354
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:48,299
Excuse me.

355
00:33:04,289 --> 00:33:05,359
Thank you.

356
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:08,019
Jin Woo brought it here...

357
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:11,430
saying that it was
Hee Jae's favorite thing.

358
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,880
Jin Woo.

359
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:31,910
How long did you stay there
with Hee Jae?

360
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,390
Hee Jae died...

361
00:33:38,789 --> 00:33:40,759
while trying to save Yu Na.

362
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:42,690
My Hee Jae.

363
00:33:44,529 --> 00:33:45,799
But why...

364
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,829
I am so sorry.

365
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:52,569
Hee Jae. Where is Hee Jae?

366
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:55,269
"Hope, in reality,
is the worst of all evils..."

367
00:33:56,369 --> 00:33:59,079
"because it prolongs
the torments of man."

368
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:00,079
Hee Jae.

369
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:01,079
Friedrich Nietzsche.

370
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:04,549
What happened there, Jin Woo?

371
00:34:06,319 --> 00:34:08,679
Just tell him everything.

372
00:34:13,019 --> 00:34:14,420
The man...

373
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:16,789
and the woman...

374
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:20,030
hit me and the others...

375
00:34:21,099 --> 00:34:23,170
with a whip.

376
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,670
And they hit the others...

377
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:30,440
again and again...

378
00:34:31,409 --> 00:34:33,809
while they were tied by a rope.

379
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,860
Jin Woo.

380
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:55,469
I wanted to ask you a favor.

381
00:34:57,429 --> 00:34:58,840
Let's take...

382
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,340
the dead children
to their family's sides.

383
00:35:07,579 --> 00:35:10,650
Dong Ha had beautiful eyes.

384
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:13,920
He had a round nose.

385
00:35:15,179 --> 00:35:16,349
Hee Jae...

386
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:18,960
was really cute-looking.

387
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,719
He had a round face,

388
00:35:22,989 --> 00:35:26,230
and when he smiled,
his eyes looked like a half moon.

389
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,300
He liked his robot.

390
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:32,900
He got angry
when others touched his robot.

391
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,510
He didn't like it when
others touched his things, right?

392
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:38,010
No.

393
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:41,780
It was because his mom
had bought it for him.

394
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:45,550
He didn't want to lose it.

395
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:55,789
(Kang Hee Jae)

396
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:15,880
I need to talk to you
about something.

397
00:36:16,449 --> 00:36:19,320
It's important. So meet me
at the address I sent you.

398
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:33,360
Aunt Sun Woo.

399
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:34,829
Han Byul.

400
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,269
What happened?

401
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:39,869
It's your day off.

402
00:36:41,639 --> 00:36:42,769
Have you forgotten already?

403
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:46,110
We decided to take turns
to look after Han Byul.

404
00:36:50,409 --> 00:36:51,679
Here, it looks so delicious.

405
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:55,050
Han Byul, open up.
Here is goes.

406
00:36:57,489 --> 00:36:58,489
Here.

407
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:14,369
Look in front of you.

408
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,039
Han Byul, we're going to start.

409
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:20,010
I'll push you.

410
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,280
Do you like it?

411
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:24,579
- Should I push harder?
- Yes.

412
00:37:24,579 --> 00:37:25,619
Harder?

413
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,030
Ha Sun Woo.

414
00:37:38,889 --> 00:37:42,000
You said you wanted to
say something.

415
00:37:47,969 --> 00:37:49,469
I will tell you.

416
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:50,909
Is it about the Reaper?

417
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:00,980
Open it.

418
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:31,079
So...

419
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:33,380
You knew about it?

420
00:38:34,179 --> 00:38:35,380
I had forgotten.

421
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:39,219
The Reaper took the earring...

422
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:43,530
that I bought for the wedding
anniversary.

423
00:38:45,159 --> 00:38:46,599
I was so careless.

424
00:38:48,099 --> 00:38:49,900
Then why didn't you tell us?

425
00:38:52,329 --> 00:38:54,400
Why didn't you tell me?

426
00:38:58,469 --> 00:39:00,440
This is something I must handle.

427
00:39:01,179 --> 00:39:04,110
You two can stop now.

428
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:05,980
Sir.

429
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:10,090
I don't want my team members
to be involved in this.

430
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:14,789
The deeper you go into this matter,

431
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:17,329
the higher the chance of
the team being put at risk.

432
00:39:43,289 --> 00:39:44,349
Do you...

433
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,260
not trust me?

434
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,829
I have a plan too.

435
00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:57,030
Don't tell the others
until then.

436
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:11,780
Has the water resources team
made the decision yet?

437
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:14,219
I think I'll go to New York
for three years.

438
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:16,190
That's where you stayed
for your study.

439
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:17,349
Give him advice.

440
00:40:17,519 --> 00:40:20,320
I was a poor student.
I didn't go anywhere.

441
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:23,860
What? There's a steakhouse
on the third street.

442
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:25,900
That's enough. Just eat your fruit.

443
00:40:26,659 --> 00:40:29,059
She went pale...

444
00:40:29,059 --> 00:40:30,400
after seeing the price on the menu,

445
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,130
and she was like, "What do we do?"

446
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:33,469
I said stop.

447
00:40:33,469 --> 00:40:36,610
The waiter thought we were ordering,

448
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:39,710
so he kept saying,
"Sorry. Tell me again please."

449
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,280
We ended up leaving.

450
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:44,679
- Gosh.
- He keeps making fun of me for it.

451
00:40:44,679 --> 00:40:47,519
How expensive was it?

452
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:48,980
We should go there.

453
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:50,219
- There's no need.
- You should try.

454
00:40:50,219 --> 00:40:51,250
I will.

455
00:41:06,039 --> 00:41:08,699
No. I can't do it.

456
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:12,239
I don't want to do it.

457
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:13,909
You're running out of time.

458
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,909
Go through the back door now.

459
00:41:23,949 --> 00:41:25,820
- Thank you for the dinner.
- You're welcome.

460
00:41:26,059 --> 00:41:28,889
Prepare well. Let's meet again
before you leave.

461
00:41:28,889 --> 00:41:30,929
- Sure. Let's meet up.
- Thank you for the dinner.

462
00:41:30,929 --> 00:41:32,289
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.

463
00:41:32,289 --> 00:41:33,900
Thank you.

464
00:41:34,199 --> 00:41:35,559
Oh, thank you.

465
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:45,639
Goodbye.

466
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:51,210
Let's go in.

467
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:01,019
Let's clean up tomorrow.

468
00:42:01,019 --> 00:42:03,630
No. It will attract bugs.

469
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:05,130
So what?

470
00:42:05,429 --> 00:42:08,000
What? You hate bugs.

471
00:42:08,699 --> 00:42:11,500
Leave the bottles and boxes outside.

472
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:15,369
Do you not know
where the recycle box is?

473
00:42:16,139 --> 00:42:17,409
As you say.

474
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:28,519
Did you leave the back door open?

475
00:42:29,219 --> 00:42:32,019
No. It must've been left open
since I went to get the wine.

476
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,840
You scared me.

477
00:42:56,650 --> 00:42:59,250
Just wait. I'm almost done.

478
00:42:59,719 --> 00:43:01,949
Let's stop now and go to bed.

479
00:43:01,949 --> 00:43:03,289
Fine. Fine.

480
00:43:27,739 --> 00:43:30,079
112 report center.
What's your emergency?

481
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:33,219
This is Hyungjoo,

482
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:37,150
73 Yeocheon-ri.

483
00:43:37,219 --> 00:43:38,989
Yes. What's the matter?

484
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:42,489
People are in danger here.

485
00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:44,889
Please help.

486
00:43:45,130 --> 00:43:48,199
Please calm down,
and tell me what's going on.

487
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,730
What's going on in there?

488
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:51,469
He said...

489
00:43:52,170 --> 00:43:53,869
the couple in this house...

490
00:43:54,699 --> 00:43:56,940
have too much.

491
00:43:57,239 --> 00:43:58,239
Pardon?

492
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:00,809
What is it that they have so much?

493
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:02,409
Money.

494
00:44:03,150 --> 00:44:05,880
Nice house. Imported car.

495
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,219
Luxury furniture.

496
00:44:08,579 --> 00:44:11,389
Please calm down.

497
00:44:11,550 --> 00:44:13,789
Please repeat one more time.

498
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:15,119
Please hurry up.

499
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:19,260
He'll begin soon.

500
00:44:19,429 --> 00:44:21,860
There's no time. Please.

501
00:44:23,199 --> 00:44:25,329
Hello? Hello?

502
00:44:27,139 --> 00:44:30,110
I'll tell you
what you're worried about.

503
00:44:31,269 --> 00:44:33,039
Now, the executor...

504
00:44:33,909 --> 00:44:36,650
will kill the owners of this house.

505
00:44:39,110 --> 00:44:41,449
Did you just say you're going
to kill someone?

506
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:43,949
Hello? Hello?

507
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:50,389
The victims are 34-year-old
investment company CEO,

508
00:44:50,389 --> 00:44:52,659
Yoon Sung Jin, and his wife,
32-year-old Lee Mi Hyun.

509
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:56,570
They were murdered in their house
in Hyungjoo about an hour ago.

510
00:44:56,769 --> 00:44:57,869
An hour ago?

511
00:44:58,230 --> 00:44:59,230
Yes.

512
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:02,239
The police arrived five minutes
after they were murdered.

513
00:45:02,239 --> 00:45:03,340
What? Five minutes?

514
00:45:03,809 --> 00:45:06,010
Who called the police so fast?

515
00:45:06,010 --> 00:45:08,940
The criminals called the police...

516
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:11,250
and said they'll kill them soon.

517
00:45:11,579 --> 00:45:14,280
Criminals? Does that mean
there is an accomplice?

518
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:17,750
Yes. The first reporter asked
for help...

519
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:19,190
in a terrified voice,

520
00:45:19,190 --> 00:45:20,820
but then, the other man
took the phone...

521
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:23,929
and said he will kill
all the sinners in that house.

522
00:45:24,389 --> 00:45:25,960
Sinners?

523
00:45:25,989 --> 00:45:28,260
Also, when the police arrived
at the site,

524
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:30,170
they found this on the bed.

525
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:37,110
That's "Dike" by Giuseppe Salviati.

526
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:38,840
"Dike"?

527
00:45:39,010 --> 00:45:41,880
Yes. She's the goddess of justice
from Greek mythology.

528
00:45:42,510 --> 00:45:44,610
She's often used as a symbol of law.

529
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,420
You know even in Korean court,

530
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:48,449
there's a statue of Dike,

531
00:45:48,449 --> 00:45:50,420
but unlike the myth,

532
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:54,090
she's holding a book instead of
a sword on her left hand.

533
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:58,690
I analyzed the pieces of the book.

534
00:45:58,690 --> 00:46:00,760
It's about the seven deadly sins
and the justice.

535
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:03,500
It's from page 32 of
Chapter 1 Greed Party.

536
00:46:04,030 --> 00:46:06,139
I don't think this book is
that well known.

537
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:08,900
The book makes a radical opinion
to control...

538
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:10,809
the people and the society with law.

539
00:46:11,269 --> 00:46:13,010
The seven deadly sins described
in the book are...

540
00:46:13,010 --> 00:46:15,579
jealousy, anger, indolence,
appetite,

541
00:46:15,579 --> 00:46:17,449
greed, arrogance, and sexual desire.

542
00:46:17,449 --> 00:46:19,409
It's same as what's written
in the bible.

543
00:46:19,409 --> 00:46:20,420
That's right.

544
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:23,519
But the greed among them.

545
00:46:25,219 --> 00:46:27,489
That's what they meant
when they addressed the victims...

546
00:46:27,489 --> 00:46:28,590
as sinners.

547
00:46:30,489 --> 00:46:33,059
They execute by the law
they created,

548
00:46:33,730 --> 00:46:37,000
and kill people to symbolize
execution.

549
00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:38,630
These types of criminals...

550
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:41,400
won't stop until they are caught.

551
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,539
There will be a murder again soon.

552
00:46:58,250 --> 00:47:00,519
What have we done?

553
00:47:01,519 --> 00:47:05,059
Why? Why did you do that?

554
00:47:05,789 --> 00:47:07,530
It wasn't necessary.

555
00:47:22,539 --> 00:47:25,280
You didn't punish them
for their sins.

556
00:47:27,179 --> 00:47:30,119
You just committed murder.

557
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:38,230
What am I going to do now?

558
00:47:41,829 --> 00:47:44,269
What do I do now?

559
00:47:54,010 --> 00:47:57,550
It's going to start soon.

560
00:47:57,610 --> 00:48:00,050
We don't have time. Please.

561
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:03,650
Hello? Hello?

562
00:48:06,659 --> 00:48:09,659
I'll tell you about
the seven deadly sins.

563
00:48:10,690 --> 00:48:12,530
It means the executioner...

564
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:16,199
will kill all the sinners here.

565
00:48:17,469 --> 00:48:20,099
The first suspect is scared...

566
00:48:20,369 --> 00:48:24,739
as if he's not doing it
on his own will.

567
00:48:25,969 --> 00:48:29,210
If he wasn't doing it on his own
will,

568
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:31,750
he would have screamed or something
to warn the victims...

569
00:48:32,179 --> 00:48:33,949
instead of reporting it.

570
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:37,250
What if he was being threatened
by his accomplice?

571
00:48:38,019 --> 00:48:40,920
If that were the case, he couldn't
have made the phone call.

572
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:45,789
The second culprit said that the
executioner will kill people.

573
00:48:46,190 --> 00:48:47,829
Do you think there's a third person?

574
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:50,230
We can't conclude that.

575
00:48:50,699 --> 00:48:52,500
Killers often...

576
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:55,800
refer to themselves in
third person.

577
00:48:56,869 --> 00:48:58,909
It can be that he's heightening
his status...

578
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:01,480
as the judge to show off his power,

579
00:49:02,010 --> 00:49:05,079
or on the contrary, to hide himself.

580
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:08,449
You're right. The serial killer,
Yoo Young Chul,

581
00:49:08,449 --> 00:49:10,889
also referred to himself as
"the murderer" when...

582
00:49:10,889 --> 00:49:14,860
describing the murders he committed.

583
00:49:15,190 --> 00:49:17,760
It means they're not
acknowledging their crimes.

584
00:49:19,159 --> 00:49:22,800
Seeing how skillful they were in
killing people in such a short time,

585
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:26,230
I doubt this is their first time.

586
00:49:26,670 --> 00:49:29,269
Gather all the case files that
are similar to this one.

587
00:49:30,039 --> 00:49:31,940
Yes, sir.
I'm already on it.

588
00:49:33,110 --> 00:49:35,780
Sun Woo, go over the victims'
bodies again.

589
00:49:36,449 --> 00:49:38,179
If it was murder,

590
00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:41,380
I'm sure there are other
distinctions we can find.

591
00:49:41,579 --> 00:49:42,579
Okay.

592
00:49:42,579 --> 00:49:45,090
Min Young, you gather detailed
information on the victims.

593
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:46,389
Don't miss anything.

594
00:49:47,489 --> 00:49:50,760
This killer has clear goals that
depend on what he believes in.

595
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:52,690
I'm sure he was selective with
his victims accordingly.

596
00:49:53,030 --> 00:49:56,469
There has to be some connection
with the killer.

597
00:49:56,969 --> 00:49:59,369
Han and I will go to the scene.

598
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:00,900
Let's go.

599
00:50:04,570 --> 00:50:08,110
This isn't some ordinary
crazy killer.

600
00:50:08,510 --> 00:50:10,610
Why would he do such a thing?

601
00:50:16,119 --> 00:50:18,349
Because of a sense of duty.

602
00:50:19,250 --> 00:50:21,690
Holmes and Deberg categorized
killers into four categories...

603
00:50:21,690 --> 00:50:23,230
depending on
motives and characteristics.

604
00:50:23,389 --> 00:50:27,059
The four types are visionary,
mission-oriented,

605
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:29,000
power-control, and hedonistic.

606
00:50:29,329 --> 00:50:32,469
In this case, the killer is
mission-oriented.

607
00:50:32,969 --> 00:50:35,469
They murder individuals or
groups they deem unworthy...

608
00:50:35,469 --> 00:50:37,510
according to their
twisted standards.

609
00:50:38,670 --> 00:50:40,210
They consider that their mission.

610
00:50:41,679 --> 00:50:43,309
In short, the killer creates...

611
00:50:43,409 --> 00:50:45,480
his own strange standards,

612
00:50:45,579 --> 00:50:48,849
and kills people, considering
that his duty.

613
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:51,389
And those types of killers...

614
00:50:51,690 --> 00:50:53,889
tend to move in groups.

615
00:50:53,889 --> 00:50:57,460
I see. Did you hear the recording
of the report call?

616
00:50:58,130 --> 00:51:01,230
The first person to report it
seemed to be dragged around.

617
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:03,730
Do you think he can be a victim too?

618
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:07,269
The relationship among accomplices
is not that simple.

619
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,070
In the case of the two killers that
murdered the Hwaseo-dong family,

620
00:51:11,670 --> 00:51:14,309
One of the accomplices, Oh Ji Man,
was dominating,

621
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:16,550
and the other, Choi Young Soo,
was submissive.

622
00:51:17,449 --> 00:51:20,949
Choi Young Soo didn't even
like going into the victims' houses.

623
00:51:22,250 --> 00:51:25,389
But in the end, the one that
murdered the whole family wasn't...

624
00:51:25,619 --> 00:51:27,559
the dominating Oh Ji Man...

625
00:51:28,190 --> 00:51:30,130
but the submissive Choi Young Soo.

626
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:37,199
There's more blood...

627
00:51:37,199 --> 00:51:38,800
than your usual murder scene.

628
00:51:39,469 --> 00:51:41,269
Where were the victims stabbed?

629
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:43,769
They weren't stabbed.

630
00:51:44,909 --> 00:51:46,210
To be more exact,

631
00:51:48,539 --> 00:51:49,579
it was like this.

632
00:51:57,690 --> 00:52:00,389
The two bodies have almost
the same wounds.

633
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:03,389
They're both long and deep.

634
00:52:03,389 --> 00:52:06,699
It penetrated both the main artery
and jugular vein in the neck.

635
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:11,030
The puncture wound runs deep and
long from the elbow to the wrist.

636
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:14,199
How familiar do you have to be
with anatomy to do this?

637
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:16,199
You just need to know where
the main artery is.

638
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:20,210
Does this killing method
mean anything?

639
00:52:20,710 --> 00:52:22,210
This was mainly used...

640
00:52:22,909 --> 00:52:25,250
to kill animals, not humans.

641
00:52:25,309 --> 00:52:28,880
It's very similar to how butchers
used to kill animals.

642
00:52:29,050 --> 00:52:31,250
Okay, let's try reenacting
the murder.

643
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:35,360
The murderer finds out that...

644
00:52:36,590 --> 00:52:38,329
his accomplice just
called the police.

645
00:52:39,590 --> 00:52:42,130
The police is on its way
and he's running out of time.

646
00:52:42,230 --> 00:52:45,400
He had to be fast.

647
00:52:57,150 --> 00:52:58,909
The killer stood watch here,

648
00:52:58,909 --> 00:53:01,019
and used the stairs to head
up to the bedroom.

649
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:16,869
Wait. What are you doing here?

650
00:53:23,809 --> 00:53:27,010
The killer probably killed
Yoon Sung Jin first.

651
00:53:28,179 --> 00:53:29,179
Why?

652
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:31,650
Usually, when there are
multiple people to kill,

653
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:33,480
they take out the biggest risk
first...

654
00:53:33,679 --> 00:53:35,780
so that the situation is
easier to control.

655
00:53:36,949 --> 00:53:40,360
In this case, that would be the
man, Yoon Sung Jin.

656
00:53:50,099 --> 00:53:52,199
Lee Mi Hyun died in the bathroom.

657
00:53:53,070 --> 00:53:54,940
She probably heard her
husband's scream,

658
00:53:55,239 --> 00:53:57,570
or felt something strange going
on and couldn't leave.

659
00:54:08,719 --> 00:54:09,750
Wait.

660
00:54:11,219 --> 00:54:13,559
Lee Mi Hyun tried to resist
in the bathroom.

661
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:16,360
But the killer used force
to open the door.

662
00:54:20,829 --> 00:54:23,670
And she was attacked right here.

663
00:54:25,570 --> 00:54:28,869
We didn't get any fingerprints
outside the door.

664
00:54:29,170 --> 00:54:31,269
Did he wear gloves?

665
00:54:33,610 --> 00:54:34,610
I don't know.

666
00:54:35,639 --> 00:54:38,849
Killers with a strong sense of
duty usually...

667
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:42,579
do not get rid of their traces
in the murder scene.

668
00:54:43,219 --> 00:54:44,250
Then...

669
00:54:45,889 --> 00:54:48,219
The first person to report the
murder...

670
00:54:48,219 --> 00:54:49,590
could have gotten rid of it.

671
00:54:59,969 --> 00:55:03,539
("Judge Greed With the Law")

672
00:55:06,610 --> 00:55:07,909
Oh my gosh.

673
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:32,170
He's experienced.

674
00:55:32,699 --> 00:55:35,099
Considering how long it took
him to kill them and run,

675
00:55:35,469 --> 00:55:38,570
it means he took care of all this
in 3 to 4 minutes.

676
00:55:41,579 --> 00:55:45,079
The station in charge covers
a lot of area.

677
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:46,679
And we don't have enough people.

678
00:55:48,219 --> 00:55:50,420
If we were only a bit faster...

679
00:55:50,650 --> 00:55:53,789
No. The police arrived on the
scene...

680
00:55:53,789 --> 00:55:56,420
3 minutes and 47 seconds after the
report. It was very fast.

681
00:55:57,030 --> 00:55:59,559
The national average was 5 minutes
and 21 seconds last year.

682
00:56:00,929 --> 00:56:03,670
Even in Seoul, with much more
personnel and a closer station,

683
00:56:03,730 --> 00:56:06,070
has an average of 4 minutes and
24 seconds. It's not much different.

684
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:08,969
Yes. He's right.

685
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:11,869
You did your best, detectives.

686
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:16,079
No one could have
prevented this case.

687
00:56:22,019 --> 00:56:24,019
- Yes, it's me.
- Hyun Jun,

688
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:25,920
you're at Yoon Sung Jin's place,
right?

689
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:27,260
("Judge Greed With the Law")

690
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:29,820
Is there a charcoal colored
sofa...

691
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:31,960
that's about 2m long?

692
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:33,500
Charcoal colored?

693
00:56:39,869 --> 00:56:42,369
Yes, there is a sofa.

694
00:56:43,139 --> 00:56:46,610
I just saw a video in a
media platform site.

695
00:56:47,739 --> 00:56:48,880
Yes, and?

696
00:56:49,110 --> 00:56:51,179
To be more exact,
it's called View Inside.

697
00:56:51,710 --> 00:56:55,050
It's a website where people share
illegal and obscene videos.

698
00:56:55,619 --> 00:56:57,349
One of the uploaded videos...

699
00:56:58,090 --> 00:57:01,190
seemed to be of a real crime scene.

700
00:57:02,489 --> 00:57:04,059
To be more exact,

701
00:57:04,159 --> 00:57:06,289
the murder of Yoon Sung
Jin and his wife.

702
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,860
A video of the murder scene?

703
00:57:09,199 --> 00:57:10,199
Yes.

704
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:14,840
The camera seems to be at the corner
of the room, towards the sofa.

705
00:57:27,849 --> 00:57:30,019
(Execution!)

706
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:34,659
No.

707
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:37,789
This is a warning.

708
00:57:37,889 --> 00:57:41,630
This is not a movie.
This is not a show.

709
00:57:43,869 --> 00:57:44,869
Did you see...

710
00:57:45,869 --> 00:57:48,139
how crazy the world is?

711
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:50,539
It begins now.

712
00:57:51,639 --> 00:57:53,679
This is the real beginning.

713
00:58:14,099 --> 00:58:15,099
I looked around,

714
00:58:15,099 --> 00:58:17,000
but there's no sign of a break in.

715
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,300
He only murdered the man this time
and abducted the woman.

716
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:21,000
Please help me.

717
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,099
There must be a reason
for changing his pattern.

718
00:58:23,099 --> 00:58:26,840
If you say one more thing,
you'll be punished for your sin.

719
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:29,909
Three accomplices follow
the same ends.

720
00:58:29,909 --> 00:58:31,510
This is the last warning.

721
00:58:32,809 --> 00:58:33,980
Something is not right.

722
00:58:34,250 --> 00:58:36,219
He called himself
an executioner.

723
00:58:36,889 --> 00:58:37,920
Don't move.

724
00:58:39,489 --> 00:58:41,219
Min Young. Where is Min Young?
