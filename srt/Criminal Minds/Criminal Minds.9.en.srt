We're looking for a child.

00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:50,960
A girl wearing a pink shirt
and short jeans...

12
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,789
You said she disappeared
when you weren't looking, right?

13
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:55,729
Did you see any strange people
nearby?

14
00:00:55,729 --> 00:00:57,500
Yes, something strange had happened.

15
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:00,170
Someone must have lost her child
because she was screaming out...

16
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:02,100
her child's name and looking around.

17
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,939
I saw her a while back too.

18
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,099
It's the same method.

19
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:07,969
We'll set up an investigation
headquarters for this case.

20
00:01:08,269 --> 00:01:11,340
He must be familiar with this area.

Eight years ago,

22
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:16,010
I lost my Jin Woo here the same
way she lost Yu Na here.

23
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:17,750
I lost my Jin Woo here.

24
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:20,079
The profiling wasn't perfect enough
to catch the criminal.

25
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:22,719
Please help me find Jin Woo.

26
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:24,159
- Get out.
- Please, I beg you.

27

- Get out.
- Please.

Nothing, not even perfect profiling,

29
00:01:27,129 --> 00:01:29,159
is more important than
saving people.

30
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:32,430
I knew...

31
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:36,200
that you were taking medications
for PTSD.

32
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,140
You should leave the team.

34
00:02:12,139 --> 00:02:15,569
that you were taking medications
for PTSD.

35
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:19,780
Why are you ignoring
the possibility...

36
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:23,110
that your personal feelings might
put your team members in danger?

37
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,349
It can be dangerous.

38
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:27,050
Seeing and hearing things...

39
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:28,550
are its presymptoms.

A girl has gone missing
at an amusement park that has...

43
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:52,610
This does not look like
a simple missing case.

44
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,810
Is there a specific reason why
you think so?

45
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:56,810
Yes.

46
00:02:57,819 --> 00:02:59,479
Take a look at this.

(Looking for a Missing Child,

48
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,490
- Here
- Thanks.

49
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:10,860
I found statistics that say there
have been more than 130,000 cases...

50
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:14,129
of child kidnapping, abuse, and
disappearance for the past 10 years.

51
00:03:14,229 --> 00:03:16,629
And there are over 11 children
that have not been found...

52
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:18,969
after their disappearance
in Songin last year.

53
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:20,939
What about other attempted
abductions?

54
00:03:22,009 --> 00:03:24,539
There were no other reports
of kidnapping or abduction.

55
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:26,539
They were all filed as
disappearance cases.

56
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,110
Really?

57
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,580
But why did you want me to look for
kidnapping cases?

58
00:03:32,349 --> 00:03:34,419
Is it because of the child
who went missing yesterday?

59
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:38,620
Look at this.

60
00:03:42,129 --> 00:03:44,000
She insists that her child...

61
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,300
also disappeared in the same way
that Yu Na did.

62
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,300
With a difference of eight years,
two children without connections...

63
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:53,300
disappeared from the same place
in the same way.

64
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:57,610
How likely do you think it is
for children to disappear...

65
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,840
with a pattern like this?

66
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,719
Do you think it was done by
the same culprit?

67
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:05,919
If that's true,

68
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,719
that means there was a gap
of eight years.

69
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:10,990
Why did the culprit start again?

70
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,159
We need to find out from now.

71
00:04:15,189 --> 00:04:17,259
There could have been more victims.

72
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:35,279
Who are you?

73
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:40,079
Jin Woo's mom is driving me insane.

74
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:42,589
Everyone wants redevelopment
of this area.

75
00:04:42,589 --> 00:04:45,160
But she won't leave this house
even though we promised...

76
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,620
to give her compensation.

77
00:04:47,259 --> 00:04:48,959
Is there a reason why she refuses?

78
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:52,399
She keeps saying that her lost son
might find his way back home.

79
00:04:52,899 --> 00:04:54,300
How would he find his way back?

80
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,329
It's been over 10 years.

81
00:04:56,569 --> 00:04:58,500
She's been giving out leaflets
with a picture of Jin Woo,

82
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,370
whom we don't know if he's
dead or alive.

83
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:03,680
Then a few years ago,
she became an alcoholic.

88

Thank you.

00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:05,800
Do you live here alone?

90
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:10,910
Yes.

91
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,649
I used to have a cat.

92
00:06:16,149 --> 00:06:17,149
But even the cat...

93
00:06:17,779 --> 00:06:19,180
ran out of the house.

94
00:06:20,889 --> 00:06:22,250
We'd like to...

95
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:26,360
hear about Jin Woo.

96
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:43,509
Eight years ago,
I also lost my child...

97
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:46,040
in that amusement park.

98
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:50,050
I registered his DNA to the police,

99
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:53,720
and I check bodies without guardian
for Jin Woo every year.

100
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:56,420
I didn't find him anywhere.
But...

101
00:06:58,259 --> 00:06:59,660
it's different this time.

102
00:07:02,259 --> 00:07:03,259
That day...

103
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:05,730
The day that Yu Na went missing,

104
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I came home and thought about it
carefully.

105
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:09,670
And this time, I am certain.

106
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:13,399
The people that took Jin Woo
kidnapped Yu Na as well.

107
00:07:14,769 --> 00:07:16,040
Did you go to the amusement park...

108
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,480
because you thought that the culprit
could kidnap another child...

109
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,949
using the same method?

110
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,410
For eight years,

111
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:28,889
I could not stay at home in my right
mind, not even for a minute.

112
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,360
I thought that Jin Woo
could come looking for me...

113
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,959
when I am not looking for him.

114
00:07:38,829 --> 00:07:40,199

Have you been collecting
all of this...

118
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,290
after Jin Woo went missing?

119
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,129
This is the only thing I could do...

120
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,160
during the past eight years.

121
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,500
Jin Woo will come back.

123
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:26,879
I saw Jin Woo.

124
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:29,610
It won't take long.

125
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:31,620
Come inside.

126
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,950
Sit over there.

127
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,720

Jin Woo!

130
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:21,629
Why didn't you...

131
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:24,340
tell the police about this?

132
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,809
No one believed me.

133
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,440
And because no one believed me,

134
00:09:32,509 --> 00:09:34,409
the truth became lies.

135
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:36,879
Lies became illusions,

136
00:09:37,419 --> 00:09:39,120
and illusions became delusions.

137
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:41,389
After that,

138
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,789
I was in pain because I thought
I could have gone insane.

139
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:47,590
But I...

140
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:50,460
definitely saw him.

141
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,169
It was Jin Woo.

142
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,799

143
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:01,009
promise me something.

144
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,909
From now on,
you should stop drinking.

145

You have been treated for alcohol
poisoning recently, right?

146
00:10:14,019 --> 00:10:15,850
If you keep on drinking,

147
00:10:16,789 --> 00:10:19,259
you won't last
until Jin Woo comes back.

148
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,259
If you don't stop drinking,

149
00:10:23,259 --> 00:10:25,830
we won't be able to help you
even if we wanted to.

150
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:27,899
Do you understand?

151
00:10:28,269 --> 00:10:29,399
I'm looking for a child.

152
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:31,039
Please take a look.

153
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:33,600
Please, take a look at this.

Excuse me. Please take a look.

Please take a look at this picture.

159
00:10:50,789 --> 00:10:52,720
I have tried everything I could do.

160
00:10:53,789 --> 00:10:55,259
To find Jin Woo,

161
00:10:55,929 --> 00:10:59,429
I traveled all over the country.

162
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:02,000
Have you seen this child?

163
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,740
Excuse me.
Please take a look at this.

164
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,100
I'm scared.

165
00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:10,610
Losing my child only took a moment,

166
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:15,480
but I'm afraid looking for him
will never end.

167
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,580
(Subway entrance)

168
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:29,330
These are the missing children
in Songin area in last 10 years.

169
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,500
My goodness. I can't believe
there are so many.

170
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:35,600
It's almost identical
to Oh Soon Young's data.

171
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:40,500
A total of 12 children are presumed
to be dead after being kidnapped.

172
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:43,269
If you look at the road map,

173
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,110
Soon Young has already...

174
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:50,580
figured out the number
of dead children.

175
00:11:51,049 --> 00:11:52,519
Just like what she said,

176
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:55,950
there's a high chance that
the missing children are alive.

177
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:58,120
I feel sad,

178
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:01,889
but there is a team for
missing and abduction cases,

179
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:04,360
and it's also hard to make
a conclusion due to many variables.

180
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,230
It's outside of our jurisdiction.
Let's stop here.

181
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:08,870
Team Manager Kang.

182
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:12,370
If someone shouts
the missing child's name,

183
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:16,039
and distracts people
to kidnap young children,

184
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:19,980
you shouldn't see it as a pattern.

185
00:12:20,809 --> 00:12:23,110
You can say that it's the criminal's
signature.

186
00:12:24,179 --> 00:12:28,649
Team Manager Kang. I don't think
you should take this lightly.

187
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:32,059
If Jin Woo's case and
Yu Na's case are related,

188
00:12:32,059 --> 00:12:34,460
there is a high chance that all the
missing children cases...

189
00:12:34,659 --> 00:12:37,600
since Jin Woo went missing eight
years ago, are related.

190
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,929
We need to consider it
when we profile.

191
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:44,169
If we investigate all the kidnapping
cases that took place...

192
00:12:44,169 --> 00:12:46,200
in public areas
in Songin from 8 years ago,

193
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:47,710
we might get an answer.

194
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:50,980
Right. If we find a connection
between Jin Woo, Yu Na...

195
00:12:51,009 --> 00:12:53,610
and all the children missing
in last 8 years,

196
00:12:54,309 --> 00:12:56,110
it could be a serial abduction case.

197
00:12:56,779 --> 00:12:58,649
Can we start right away, Ms. Hwang?

198
00:12:58,649 --> 00:12:59,649
Sure.

199
00:13:00,419 --> 00:13:01,789
Just give me the order.

200
00:13:10,659 --> 00:13:11,659
Team Manager Kang.

201
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:14,370
Unless we figure out the cause
or the motive for the crime,

202
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:16,570
even if Jin Woo was seen
three years ago,

203
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:18,399
there's no guarantee
that Jin Woo is alive.

204
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:19,399
Here.

205
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:27,340
Do you remember what you said
when you gave this to me?

206
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:32,320
This...

207
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:35,490
was your first NCI case.

208
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:38,059
Ha Sun Woo.

209
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:40,960
What we do here...

210
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:44,429
is chase after those
who lost human nature.

211
00:13:45,029 --> 00:13:47,500
We see the ugliest bottom.

212
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:50,230
I still see...

213
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:52,370
those monsters in my dreams.

214
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,070
Every time that happens,

215
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:56,539
I see the pictures of children
I saved.

216
00:13:57,809 --> 00:13:59,779
At that time, we saved Hyun Ji.

217
00:14:01,509 --> 00:14:05,049
When everyone told us we should
give up because she was dead,

218
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:08,120
you had refused to give up.

219
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:11,860
You said if there's even a slightest
chance of Hyun Ji being alive,

220
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,730
we should save her.

221
00:14:19,929 --> 00:14:21,970
That's probably
what Soon Young felt...

222
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,899
during the past eight years.

223
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,879
Bring me the rest of data.

224
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:35,779
Let's hurry and begin the profiling.

225
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:38,419
Yes.

226
00:14:44,659 --> 00:14:48,059
He has a sharp nose and slim face.

227
00:14:52,029 --> 00:14:53,529
He has a lot of hair.

228
00:14:55,899 --> 00:14:57,269
(Missing Child, Kim Jin Woo)

229
00:15:43,549 --> 00:15:45,250
Yu Na and her mom...

230
00:15:46,049 --> 00:15:47,480
probably stood around here.

231
00:16:09,909 --> 00:16:13,779
Yu Na and her mom were watching
the performance while holding hands.

232
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:24,690
The criminal probably stood around
here waiting for their target.

233
00:16:32,129 --> 00:16:34,230
Then some woman screamed.

234
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:38,240
Yu Na's mom was probably distracted
while looking at the woman...

235
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:41,440
and didn't realize she let go of
Yu Na's hand.

236
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:43,669
By the time, her mom turned around,

237
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:46,610
Yu Na was already gone.

238
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,750
Yu Na probably couldn't respond
because the man's hand...

239
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,320
was covering her mouth.

240
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:55,350
Other people thought...

241
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,720
the man was her father
comforting his crying daughter.

242
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Hurry up.

243
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:17,009
Soon, Yu Na was locked in the car,

244
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:21,279
and they disappeared
as if nothing happened.

245
00:17:22,509 --> 00:17:23,579
Then...

246
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,450
who is the driver?

247
00:17:50,339 --> 00:17:53,579
According to the profile,
there are at least three criminals.

248
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:55,579
Does that mean
there are accomplices?

249
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:59,019
Yes. It looks like they're moving
as a group.

250
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,890
If they're moving as a group,

251
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:07,190
they might have been kidnapping
children long before our timeline.

252
00:18:08,589 --> 00:18:09,789
If that's the case,

253
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:13,660
something worse than we expected
is happening.

254
00:18:18,039 --> 00:18:21,910
Why did you come to my house?

255
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:25,410
Why did you come?

256
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:29,910
I'm here to find a flower

257
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:33,549
I'm here to find it

258
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:36,349
Are you crying again?

259
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:39,650
Mommy told you
I hate children who cry.

260
00:19:40,519 --> 00:19:42,519
I told you not to cry.

261
00:19:43,819 --> 00:19:44,859
I'm sorry.

262
00:19:44,859 --> 00:19:47,119
Don't cry. Don't cry!

263
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:08,980
Team Manager Kang.

264
00:20:10,109 --> 00:20:11,109
Do you think...

265
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:14,950
the children are still alive?

266
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:21,359
For child abduction cases, unless
you find them within 24 hours,

267
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:23,930
the children are likely
to be found dead.

268
00:20:24,529 --> 00:20:25,960
In last three years,

269
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:28,500
there was not even one case...

270
00:20:29,029 --> 00:20:31,000
asking for money.

271
00:20:32,569 --> 00:20:35,170
If Jin Woo is alive, he's 16 now.

272
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:38,339
Do you think it's possible...

273
00:20:38,339 --> 00:20:41,210
to hide a 16-year-old?

274
00:20:41,849 --> 00:20:43,680
Most selective-type criminals...

275
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:47,480
get rid of the victims...

276
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:49,589
before they reach adolescence.

277
00:20:50,089 --> 00:20:52,759
That's possible if Jin Woo was
kidnapped at a young age.

278
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:56,029
The culprits would have consistently
exposed these children...

279
00:20:56,029 --> 00:20:57,930
to violence and stimulation.

280
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:14,980
They would have...

281
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,549
chosen a target.

282
00:21:19,579 --> 00:21:20,619
And then...

283
00:21:22,619 --> 00:21:24,289
used the child as sacrifice.

284
00:21:49,779 --> 00:21:52,819
When he was first kidnapped,
Jin Woo was only eight years old.

285
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:56,619
But through experience, he would've
learned to do as told...

286
00:21:56,619 --> 00:21:58,259
in order to survive.

287
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:01,289
He would now be used to
being obedient.

288
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:03,960
Then...

289
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:06,859
he could have Stockholm Syndrome.

290
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:09,329
The fact that
the culprits have him...

291
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:12,470
would be the reason why
he has not been found yet.

292
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:16,569
But there is a problem
that has not been solved yet.

293
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:38,059
What is your name?

294
00:22:42,369 --> 00:22:43,630
From now on,

295
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:47,069
you should never forget your name.

296
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:51,940
There are more children like you.

297
00:22:52,539 --> 00:22:53,940
We have all been kidnapped.

298
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:57,480
Why did the culprits kidnap
these children continuously?

299
00:22:58,079 --> 00:22:59,750
Why did they keep Jin Woo alive?

300
00:23:00,349 --> 00:23:02,490
Is it just to use him as accomplice?

301
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,160
These people...

302
00:23:06,589 --> 00:23:08,630
will give you a new name.

303
00:23:09,559 --> 00:23:12,829
But you should never forget
your real name.

304
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:14,900
Do you understand?

305
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:17,200
The culprits...

306
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:19,900
could never take the children
to a public place.

307
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:23,539
If we are right
and they are all alive,

308
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:26,440
where could they have
hidden the children?

309
00:23:27,779 --> 00:23:28,809
And how?

310
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:43,990
Mom!

311
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:54,170
Excuse me, but why are you
leaving like this?

312
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:55,769
What about our daughter, Yu Na?

313
00:23:56,109 --> 00:23:59,039
It's been over three days.

314
00:23:59,809 --> 00:24:01,950
If you just wait,
we will call you.

315
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:04,410
What are you talking about?

316
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:06,920
We have done everything we can.

317
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,420
We are going to be in charge
of this case from now on.

318
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:15,460
Min Young.

319
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:16,890
Right.

320
00:24:17,529 --> 00:24:19,359
We should have a talk.

321
00:24:26,269 --> 00:24:28,170
It's been exactly 52 hours.

322
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:31,609
As you know,
most murders after kidnapping...

323
00:24:31,609 --> 00:24:33,609
happen within 24 hours.

324
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:37,109
Do you think that the golden time
has passed already?

325
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,549
Yes.

326
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:40,819
We think differently.

327
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:43,220
This is an organized crime.

328
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:45,619
It could have a different pattern
from other cases.

329
00:24:45,789 --> 00:24:47,660
I've dealt with multiple cases
like this.

330
00:24:49,559 --> 00:24:52,829
The culprit most likely
took the child for sexual reasons.

331
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,099
It was done by a pedophile.

332
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,900
You should think about this again.

333
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,440
The victim took the risk of
gaining attention in public...

334
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:01,609
by making a big fuss...

335
00:25:01,609 --> 00:25:03,039
so they can kidnap a child.

336
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:06,279
It's not something that pedophiles,

337
00:25:06,279 --> 00:25:08,079
who do not like to be in public,

338
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:09,250
would do.

339
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:11,480
We believe they kidnap children...

340
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,349
for reasons...

341
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:16,250
other than money or
sexual harassment.

342
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:19,619
We see this as a continuation...

343
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,730
of other kidnapping cases in Songin,

344
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:24,900
and we're going to run
a reinvestigation.

345
00:25:26,029 --> 00:25:27,400
We need your cooperation.

346
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:40,380
Okay.

347
00:25:52,119 --> 00:25:53,259
Team Manager Kang.

348
00:25:57,230 --> 00:26:00,500
Is she alive? Is Yu Na alive?

349
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:02,299
Is she, Detective?

350
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,400
Honey.

351
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,470
Please tell us...

352
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:08,039
that Yu Na is alive.

353
00:26:08,099 --> 00:26:10,769
Please tell us that she is alive.

354
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:13,210
Yu Na...

355
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:15,579
will still be alive.

356
00:26:16,779 --> 00:26:18,420
- Thank you.
- She's alive.

357
00:26:20,549 --> 00:26:21,690
Yes?

358
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:25,220
Team Manager Kang.

359
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:31,759
Captain, I'm analyzing the footage
from the police station.

360
00:26:32,599 --> 00:26:33,960
I think I have something.

361
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,400
Tell me.

362
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:38,170
On every footage that Yu Na was on,

363
00:26:38,299 --> 00:26:40,500
a man is there as well.

364
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:42,809
Who is he?

365
00:26:44,839 --> 00:26:45,910
Yoon Seok Ho.

366
00:26:46,309 --> 00:26:48,549
He's an employee of the company
that subcontracts to...

367
00:26:48,549 --> 00:26:49,910
the company "Vienna"
that Yu Na's father manages.

368
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,150
Do you know him?

369
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,720
No.

370
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:56,920
I don't.

371
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:59,359
I don't know where he lives yet.

372
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:03,359
I'm looking for registered cars
that he might own.

373
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:51,210
Hey.

374
00:27:52,309 --> 00:27:53,380
Hey.

375
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:55,950
Hey.

376
00:28:00,019 --> 00:28:01,750
Wake up.

377
00:28:02,019 --> 00:28:03,349
Let's run away.

378
00:28:07,089 --> 00:28:10,829
Everyone went out to kidnap a new
child from the firework festival.

379
00:28:11,859 --> 00:28:13,930
We need to run away
before they arrive.

380
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,799
If they bring a new child,

381
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:21,140
one of us will be killed.

382
00:28:27,109 --> 00:28:28,450
Let's go find your mom.

383
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:30,750
You can't make a sound, okay?

384
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,799
Ouch, that hurt.

385
00:31:18,779 --> 00:31:21,720
Where are you going?

386
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:24,789
Let's go home with Mommy.
Mommy's here. Let's go home.

387
00:31:24,789 --> 00:31:26,759
- No.
- It's fine.

388
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:12,599
- Goodness.
- What on earth?

389
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:23,210
Yoon Seok Ho.

390
00:32:32,019 --> 00:32:35,329
Yoon Seok Ho. You're under arrest
for kidnapping.

391
00:32:35,329 --> 00:32:37,490
Let me go. Let me go!

392
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:41,730
Yoon Seok Ho. After his wife,
Jung Hyun Joo died,

393
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:44,299
he's been living working
as a daily laborer.

394
00:32:44,369 --> 00:32:47,400
He's working as a contract employee
at a subcontractor...

395
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,039
of Hwang Kyung Sik's BNI.

396
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:51,539
What was the reason
for his wife's death?

397
00:32:51,539 --> 00:32:54,539
It just says she died of hyperpnoea
while she was pregnant.

398
00:32:54,779 --> 00:32:58,380
Captain. It says Jung Hyun Joo
was hospitalized for a light cold...

399
00:32:58,380 --> 00:32:59,849
but she died for unknown reason...

400
00:32:59,849 --> 00:33:02,089
after showing signs of hyperpnoea.

401
00:33:02,819 --> 00:33:04,450
She was seven-months pregnant
at the time...

402
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:06,589
and died with her baby.

403
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:10,089
But something is strange.

404
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:12,599
BNI had a massive recall...

405
00:33:12,599 --> 00:33:16,099
on their detergent products
starting June of 2011.

406
00:33:16,299 --> 00:33:20,769
At the time, Yoon Seok Ho delivered
the products from the subcontractor.

407
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:23,710
Are you saying that's related to
Jung Hyun Joo's death?

408
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:28,180
I traced the pregnant women who died
of humidifier sterilizers in 2011.

409
00:33:28,509 --> 00:33:31,049
BNI tested their products...

410
00:33:31,049 --> 00:33:33,079
on their employees.

411
00:33:33,349 --> 00:33:36,619
There were young children who died
of Jung Young Joo's symptoms.

412
00:33:36,819 --> 00:33:39,859
That means Young Joo might be...

413
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:42,190
a victim of the sterilizer.

414
00:33:43,059 --> 00:33:46,029
If Seok Ho used the product
to test it,

415
00:33:46,029 --> 00:33:48,730
he pretty much killed
his own family.

416
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:50,769
Is that why he kidnapped Yu Na?

417
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,309
(Green Pharmacy)

418
00:35:43,309 --> 00:35:45,650
(Prescription)

419
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:03,269
Where is Yu Na?

420
00:36:04,369 --> 00:36:06,670
Why do I need to tell you that?

421
00:36:09,269 --> 00:36:11,639
Your wife, Jung Young Joo
who died in 2010...

422
00:36:12,639 --> 00:36:14,940
was the only person
who was not approved as...

423
00:36:15,309 --> 00:36:17,880
industrial accident.

424
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,619
Industrial accident?

425
00:36:20,849 --> 00:36:22,650
That's a joke.

426
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:26,860
They killed Young Joo
and the baby inside her.

427
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,460
They gave the products to us...

428
00:36:30,789 --> 00:36:33,300
way before it was released.
Did you know that?

429
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,969
They tested on us.

430
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:39,539
They knew
their products were not safe.

431
00:36:39,969 --> 00:36:43,510
Is that why you decided to
kidnap Yu Na?

432
00:36:44,469 --> 00:36:45,469
Yes.

433
00:36:46,179 --> 00:36:47,739
I kidnapped Yu Na.

434
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:49,909
I wanted to get back at them.

435
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:51,210
So what?

436
00:36:51,909 --> 00:36:52,980
Hold on.

437
00:37:03,489 --> 00:37:05,800
SSRI. Antidepressant.

438
00:37:06,659 --> 00:37:09,469
It also has antianxiety drugs
with benzodiazepine.

439
00:37:09,969 --> 00:37:12,369
Are you saying he has
a panic disorder?

440
00:37:13,269 --> 00:37:14,969
Based on his prescription,

441
00:37:14,969 --> 00:37:17,539
it's highly likely that he had
regular panic attacks.

442
00:37:34,519 --> 00:37:37,829
When he was in front of the subway
station, even though he could run,

443
00:37:37,829 --> 00:37:39,429
he turned back around. No.

444
00:37:40,099 --> 00:37:41,400
He didn't turn back around.

445
00:37:41,929 --> 00:37:43,500
He couldn't go in.

446
00:37:47,639 --> 00:37:48,639
Hello?

447
00:37:50,469 --> 00:37:52,210
Agoraphobia?

448
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:54,940
Okay.

449
00:37:55,539 --> 00:37:56,780
Call me if you find anything else.

450
00:37:59,079 --> 00:38:02,119
Is Yoon Seok Ho suffering from
agoraphobia?

451
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:06,389
The criminal picked a crowded place
to kidnap children.

452
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,829
That means Yoon Seok Ho
can't be the criminal.

453
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,989
If he didn't kidnap Yu Na,

454
00:38:11,989 --> 00:38:13,400
why did he run away?

455
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:16,769
I noticed you've been watching
Yu Na.

456
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:21,340
You studied her daily route and the
surveillance camera blind spots.

457
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,070
Why didn't you tell me the truth
from the first place?

458
00:38:26,739 --> 00:38:30,079
The fact that Yu Na is missing
must have shocked you too.

459
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:33,980
Since someone else took your chance,

460
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:36,550
you were probably disappointed
and troubled.

461
00:38:37,519 --> 00:38:38,690
What are you talking about?

462
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:45,429
Then you probably thought
it's actually great.

463
00:38:46,329 --> 00:38:47,730
Regardless of the means,

464
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:51,000
it happened, and it's making
her parents suffer.

465
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:53,099
What are you talking about?

466
00:38:53,869 --> 00:38:56,110
It was me. I did it!

467
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:57,710
No.

468
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:00,679
You didn't kidnap Yu Na.

469
00:39:02,579 --> 00:39:03,949
Why are you lying?

470
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:05,880
Were you afraid?

471
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:09,150
You couldn't do anything,

472
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:11,050
but why did you run away?

473
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:54,829
Don't cry.

474
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:58,900
Do you want to die?

475
00:40:00,699 --> 00:40:02,639
Please just stay put.

476
00:40:02,769 --> 00:40:04,139
Let us leave!

477
00:40:04,139 --> 00:40:05,809
Let us out!

478
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:08,880
Please let us out!

479
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:49,650
Eat at least a bit of it.

480
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:51,619
Or else,

481
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:53,989
you'll be dragged to the glass room.

482
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:58,889
No, I don't want to.
I want to go to my mom.

483
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:01,960
Just pretend to eat it.

484
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:03,599
If you go there,

485
00:41:12,409 --> 00:41:15,739
Dear youngest daughter,
you're not eating anything.

486
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:19,110
You have to be punished for that.

487
00:41:21,349 --> 00:41:22,420
Please let it pass just once.

488
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:27,659
It's her first time, so she
doesn't know anything. Please?

489
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:31,289
She might die if she goes there.

490
00:41:31,789 --> 00:41:34,000
She hasn't eaten a single thing
since she got here.

491
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:37,199
Then,

492
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:39,769
will you guys go instead of her?

493
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:07,829
It's very special...

494
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:10,699
to come in this room.

495
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,170
Right?

496
00:42:44,699 --> 00:42:46,199
You, little girl,

497
00:42:46,739 --> 00:42:49,099
haven't been listening to Mommy.

498
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:52,309
So Mommy is very angry.

499
00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:55,340
Naughty kids...

500
00:42:55,949 --> 00:42:57,780
have to come into this room,

501
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,849
and see their bad faces.

502
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:03,920
They have to think about
what they did wrong,

503
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:06,360
and tell Mommy.

504
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,889
Then Mommy will let you go.

505
00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:14,429
Dear girl.

506
00:43:15,059 --> 00:43:18,000
Come, Mommy will sing for you.

507
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:27,639
Why did you come to my house?

508
00:43:27,639 --> 00:43:31,449
Why did you come?

509
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:35,150
I'm here to find a flower

510
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:38,449
I'm here to find it

511
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:42,659
What flower are you looking for?

512
00:43:42,659 --> 00:43:46,260
What flower?

513
00:43:47,199 --> 00:43:50,829
I'm here for baby flowers

514
00:43:50,829 --> 00:43:54,000
For baby flowers

515
00:43:56,539 --> 00:43:57,639
Baby,

516
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:01,280
what does this song mean?

517
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:05,110
This song was written...

518
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:09,219
when your mother sold you to us.

519
00:44:10,190 --> 00:44:12,090
She abandoned you.

520
00:44:12,619 --> 00:44:13,760
No.

521
00:44:18,659 --> 00:44:20,760
Mommy told you not to cry.

522
00:44:21,429 --> 00:44:23,630
Mommy doesn't need kids who cry.

523
00:44:23,699 --> 00:44:25,500
Stop crying!

524
00:44:30,010 --> 00:44:32,539
Think about what you did wrong here.

525
00:44:42,849 --> 00:44:44,619
Let me go!

526
00:44:44,619 --> 00:44:47,090
What are you doing!

527
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:48,590
Let me go!

528
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:51,460
Let go!

529
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:55,860
What is Yoon Seok Ho trying to hide?

530
00:44:57,730 --> 00:45:01,170
Even if he knows something
about the culprit,

531
00:45:01,170 --> 00:45:02,440
he probably won't say anything.

532
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:05,070
Because what he wants...

533
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:07,840
is for Yu Na's parents to suffer
forever.

534
00:45:40,110 --> 00:45:41,280
Now I know...

535
00:45:42,739 --> 00:45:44,949
what Yoon Seok Ho tried to hide.

536
00:45:45,449 --> 00:45:47,449
Someone else was after Yu Na too.

537
00:46:02,099 --> 00:46:04,800
Yoon Seok Ho spied on Yu Na
for a long time.

538
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:58,320
And then he finds something strange.

539
00:47:04,829 --> 00:47:06,130
He discovers that the same van...

540
00:47:06,130 --> 00:47:09,030
has been around Yu Na every time.

541
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:11,570
If the culprits were a step
ahead of Yoon Seok Ho,

542
00:47:11,670 --> 00:47:13,739
it's likely that they knew Yu Na...

543
00:47:14,099 --> 00:47:15,900
much earlier than we'd thought.

544
00:47:17,610 --> 00:47:20,710
Let's first take a look at the
blackbox inside Yoon Seok Ho's car.

545
00:47:23,849 --> 00:47:25,050
Who in the world...

546
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:27,780
I mean, why would they do this
to kids?

547
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:30,989
If the culprits kept their eyes on
Yu Na for a while,

548
00:47:31,550 --> 00:47:34,190
I'm sure they had been in
the same place at one point.

549
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:35,960
Stop.

550
00:47:36,789 --> 00:47:38,760
Fast forward just a little bit.

551
00:47:40,829 --> 00:47:41,900
Stop there.

552
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:44,429
Zoom in.

553
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:46,570
And fast forward a little bit.

554
00:47:50,269 --> 00:47:51,469
Just one more frame.

555
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:54,579
Right there.

556
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:58,179
Yu Na sees something and
runs towards it.

557
00:47:59,079 --> 00:48:00,420
No one's there.

558
00:48:00,719 --> 00:48:02,949
Why does she seem so happy to
see something?

559
00:48:03,190 --> 00:48:05,519
You're right. Did she see a friend?

560
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:08,690
No. Yu Na's alone in the next block
security footage in the next block.

561
00:48:08,690 --> 00:48:10,159
She was alone all along.

562
00:48:11,159 --> 00:48:12,730
Zoom into Yu Na's face.

563
00:48:16,730 --> 00:48:17,730
Wait.

564
00:48:18,829 --> 00:48:21,369
She's smiling at something.

565
00:48:22,599 --> 00:48:23,840
What is that faint black thing...

566
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:26,170
behind that electric pole?

567
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:28,440
I'll zoom in.

568
00:48:30,949 --> 00:48:32,110
Yoon Seok Ho...

569
00:48:32,909 --> 00:48:34,519
is hiding and taking photos.

570
00:48:36,150 --> 00:48:39,219
If that's the case, he could have
shot what Yu Na...

571
00:48:39,219 --> 00:48:40,489
saw and ran towards.

572
00:48:41,690 --> 00:48:42,789
Wait.

573
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:47,360
These are the photos discovered
in Yoon Seok Ho's house.

574
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:51,170
Yes, this one.
It's from the same time.

575
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:36,750
From the background check we did
of all of their acquaintances,

576
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:38,880
no one owned a grey van.

577
00:49:40,579 --> 00:49:43,019
We can't find a full
license plate...

578
00:49:43,019 --> 00:49:44,989
in Yoon Seok Ho's photos
or in any of the security footage.

579
00:49:45,219 --> 00:49:48,119
Yoon Seok Ho circled around Yu Na
for six months.

580
00:49:49,019 --> 00:49:51,030
If the culprits have been on
the move before then,

581
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:55,030
that means they were in contact with
missing children from much earlier.

582
00:49:56,599 --> 00:49:58,769
There must be traces somewhere.

583
00:50:18,190 --> 00:50:21,190
Did Yu Na happen to have a pet?

584
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:26,159
No. She has a severe allergy
to cats and dogs.

585
00:50:26,159 --> 00:50:27,599
She can't even go near them.

586
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:35,840
Songin hosts a lot of festivals
and cultural events in particular.

587
00:50:35,869 --> 00:50:37,869
The time when Yu Na was abducted
was during a show,

588
00:50:38,539 --> 00:50:42,280
so maybe it's someone from a
theater group or the event staff?

589
00:50:45,150 --> 00:50:48,480
But there's one thing
I can't understand.

590
00:50:49,349 --> 00:50:54,119
If they were able to get that
friendly with Yu Na that easily,

591
00:50:54,719 --> 00:50:57,630
why did they choose such
a troublesome way to kidnap her?

592
00:50:59,090 --> 00:51:01,429
It may be because of the culprit's
particular obsession,

593
00:51:01,429 --> 00:51:04,170
or some other psychological factor.

594
00:51:05,329 --> 00:51:09,070
They probably need a location that
can secretly hide several children.

595
00:51:09,699 --> 00:51:13,909
The culprit probably owns a house
in the suburbs,

596
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:17,579
and the culprit probably hasn't
moved for a long time.

597
00:51:18,550 --> 00:51:21,320
The culprit uses a van to kidnap
the children during the weekdays...

598
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:23,420
and has been tracking them
for a long time.

599
00:51:23,849 --> 00:51:25,949
Considering the level of
obsession,

600
00:51:26,050 --> 00:51:29,559
the culprit probably has a
specialized job with no work hours.

601
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:33,559
Considering how long these
systematic crimes have continued,

602
00:51:33,659 --> 00:51:36,429
it's likely that two of the
accomplices are family,

603
00:51:37,030 --> 00:51:38,699
or a married couple.

604
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:26,280
If the kidnappings have continued
for over ten years as predicted,

605
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:29,250
then it's a very unique case unlike
any we've seen before.

606
00:52:29,750 --> 00:52:31,349
If it involved abnormal
psychological behavior,

607
00:52:31,349 --> 00:52:33,960
it's likely that they've been
reported before.

608
00:52:34,489 --> 00:52:36,929
The culprits may have separation
anxiety disorder.

609
00:52:36,929 --> 00:52:40,599
Being strict and violent with
children falls into those cases.

610
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:43,599
If that's the case, the culprits
were probably abused as children...

611
00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:46,539
or were exposed to violence
at a young age.

612
00:52:46,969 --> 00:52:49,469
It must be linked to a case
from before.

613
00:52:49,539 --> 00:52:53,440
It's likely that the trauma from
that led to committing crimes.

614
00:52:54,539 --> 00:52:58,909
Maybe the culprit collects children
like one might collect dolls?

615
00:52:59,610 --> 00:53:02,449
There's a study that says victims
of sexual or violent abuse...

616
00:53:02,449 --> 00:53:04,150
collect alternative items...

617
00:53:04,150 --> 00:53:06,449
to avoid their own anxiety.

618
00:53:06,449 --> 00:53:07,789
They become a hoarder of sorts.

619
00:53:08,719 --> 00:53:10,190
If they are hoarders,

620
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:13,059
they are probably skilled in
kidnapping and discarding children.

621
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:17,300
If they have a pattern of spending
a lot of time before the kidnap,

622
00:53:17,369 --> 00:53:19,630
it means they've failed before.

623
00:53:19,829 --> 00:53:23,309
Yes, they couldn't have succeeded
in kidnapping all the time.

624
00:53:23,409 --> 00:53:26,579
There must have been similar
attempts before this.

625
00:53:26,739 --> 00:53:28,480
- Release it to the media.
- No.

626
00:53:29,610 --> 00:53:31,150
If the culprit feels at risk,

627
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:33,349
Yu Na and the other children
may be in danger.

628
00:53:34,150 --> 00:53:37,219
The culprits couldn't have been
this organized from the beginning.

629
00:53:37,219 --> 00:53:39,719
They must have gone through trials.

630
00:53:39,719 --> 00:53:43,119
Then as you said, there must have
been several failed attempts.

631
00:53:44,690 --> 00:53:46,130
There is a need to make this public.

632
00:53:47,030 --> 00:53:49,969
If we find commonalities among
the victims' parents,

633
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:53,199
we'll be able to find
a clue in there.

634
00:53:53,199 --> 00:53:56,440
Gather the parents of the missing
children as soon as possible.

635
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:57,969
- Yes.
- Okay.

636
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:05,679
On September 9, at Songwon
Amusement Park,

637
00:54:05,679 --> 00:54:09,150
six-year-old Hwang Yu Na was
unfortunately kidnapped.

638
00:54:09,579 --> 00:54:11,789
It's been six days since she
went missing.

639
00:54:11,789 --> 00:54:16,460
Yu Na's parents are in
utter despair for their daughter.

640
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:18,030
The NCI...

641
00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:20,929
is looking for a slender woman
in her mid to late 30s,

642
00:54:20,929 --> 00:54:23,030
and two men as suspects.

643
00:54:23,130 --> 00:54:25,099
We are cooperating
with the police...

644
00:54:25,099 --> 00:54:28,070
and using all our resources
to find Yu Na.

645
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:31,469
The three suspects
use a silver van...

646
00:54:31,710 --> 00:54:34,110
to kidnap children around amusement
parks and crowded places...

647
00:54:34,110 --> 00:54:36,710
in a systematic way.

648
00:54:37,849 --> 00:54:41,880
Moreover, their jobs likely involve
frequent contact with children.

649
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:45,320
If you've experienced a similar case
as the one I've just described,

650
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:49,289
or if you've heard of or witnessed
a similar case, please contact us.

651
00:54:49,289 --> 00:54:53,800
For the numerous families who've
been suffering...

652
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:56,360
for years from losing
their children,

653
00:54:56,360 --> 00:55:00,369
if you know anything, anything at
all, please report it to us.

654
00:55:01,269 --> 00:55:03,070
Your phone call...

655
00:55:03,070 --> 00:55:07,039
- can save a child's valuable life.
- Dong Min!

656
00:55:07,309 --> 00:55:09,840
- If you experienced a similar case,
- Dong Min!

657
00:55:10,110 --> 00:55:12,010
or have witnessed one,

658
00:55:12,010 --> 00:55:15,849
please report it to NCI's
Special Crimes unit.

659
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:22,019
Here. Open your mouth.

660
00:55:28,329 --> 00:55:30,099
You've been to the glass room.

661
00:55:30,769 --> 00:55:32,170
You want to be punished again?

662
00:55:32,170 --> 00:55:35,539
No, don't cry. It's okay.

663
00:55:36,710 --> 00:55:38,639
I miss my mom.

664
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:42,639
Yu Na, what's your favorite food?

665
00:55:43,210 --> 00:55:44,250
Ice cream?

666
00:55:45,150 --> 00:55:46,250
Hey.

667
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:50,489
Can't you stay with me?

668
00:55:52,519 --> 00:55:55,260
We have to go back
to our room now.

669
00:55:56,219 --> 00:55:58,059
We sneaked in here.

670
00:55:58,090 --> 00:56:00,829
If you don't want to go
back to the glass room,

671
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:03,400
you have to eat.

672
00:56:04,730 --> 00:56:05,769
Promise me.

673
00:56:18,349 --> 00:56:22,820
I'm here to find a flower

674
00:56:22,820 --> 00:56:26,820
I'm here to find it

675
00:56:32,059 --> 00:56:33,090
Why?

676
00:56:33,659 --> 00:56:36,300
Sick children have to go
to the hospital.

677
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:37,829
Besides, this girl...

678
00:56:38,369 --> 00:56:40,269
hasn't been eating either.

679
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:44,369
No.

680
00:56:51,750 --> 00:56:55,280
You guys will be punished
soon too.

681
00:56:56,150 --> 00:56:57,349
Move out of way.

682
00:56:58,949 --> 00:57:00,389
Before I beat you.

683
00:57:04,389 --> 00:57:05,429
Let go.

684
00:57:06,329 --> 00:57:07,800
You little!

685
00:57:11,769 --> 00:57:14,739
I'll do it. I'll do it.

686
00:57:16,139 --> 00:57:17,139
What?

687
00:57:23,780 --> 00:57:25,309
I'll do it.

688
00:57:26,949 --> 00:57:30,250
I've always wanted to do it,

689
00:57:31,489 --> 00:57:32,550
Mom.

690
00:57:39,530 --> 00:57:40,559
Okay.

691
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:47,039
You have to stab it at once.

692
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:02,150
Just stay still.

693
00:58:03,179 --> 00:58:04,820
It'll be over soon.

694
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:35,579
You dared to fool me? You?

695
00:58:36,449 --> 00:58:37,449
You come here.

696
00:58:39,190 --> 00:58:40,460
No, no.

697
00:58:44,690 --> 00:58:45,690
You little!

698
00:58:49,159 --> 00:58:50,829
No, let me go!

699
00:58:50,829 --> 00:58:53,170
Stop crying and be quiet!

700
00:58:56,239 --> 00:58:57,570
No, stop!

701
00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:03,380
No, let go of me.

702
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:26,500
The kidnapper and the children...

703
00:59:26,630 --> 00:59:28,639
must have had a connection
somewhere.

704
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:30,440
I heard with my own ears...

705
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:32,210
that this woman's son is an
accomplice.

706
00:59:32,369 --> 00:59:34,739
He must have shown signs of
Stockholm Syndrome.

707
00:59:35,079 --> 00:59:37,210
Apparently, the culprits called the
victim's home,

708
00:59:37,210 --> 00:59:39,409
and told them they were
going to kill someone.

709
00:59:39,750 --> 00:59:41,219
Did you open the back door?

710
00:59:41,219 --> 00:59:43,920
No. Maybe it didn't close when I
went to get the wine.

711
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:48,090
People are in danger.

712
00:59:48,090 --> 00:59:49,219
Help.

713
00:59:50,889 --> 00:59:52,860
There's no time. Please.

714
00:59:53,460 --> 00:59:55,730
The killer considers it a duty
to murder...

715
00:59:55,730 --> 00:59:58,170
individuals that the killer
deems unworthy.

716
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:01,239
They never stop killing
until they're caught.

717
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:03,639
There will be another murder.
