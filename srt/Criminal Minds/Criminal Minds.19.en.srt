00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:43,049
Chungmyung Police station requested
cooperation...

10
00:00:43,049 --> 00:00:44,619
related to a serial sex offender.

11
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:48,420
The culprit knew well about
the victims' house structure.

12
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,859
He cut the power and
went in through the unlocked door.

13
00:00:51,859 --> 00:00:54,890
The culprit would be looking for
his next victim.

14
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:58,460
It wouldn't be so easy to be
in a team that focuses on...

15
00:00:58,460 --> 00:00:59,759
sexual assault cases.

16
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:03,100
Prior to leaving the team,
I had to take a difficult case.

17
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:05,269
Sun Woo had a hard time.

18
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:07,439
In the end,
she was sent to another team.

19
00:01:08,469 --> 00:01:11,010
He will move again in a few days.

20
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:12,310
We need to use a bait.

21
00:01:12,579 --> 00:01:13,709
I will do it.

22
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:17,180
The culprit works for
the research company's security.

23
00:01:19,019 --> 00:01:20,079
Ha Sun Woo.

24
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:21,790
Sun Woo isn't here.

25
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,459
I found the car.

26
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,930
Promise me that you will arrest him.

27
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:33,299
I promise.

29
00:02:14,139 --> 00:02:15,310
Why did you come so late?

30
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:17,639
I already had two cups of coffee.

Kim Yong Chul.

32
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,250
Where is Chief Director Baek?

33
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:23,620
Why are you in such a hurry?

34
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:26,650
Don't just stand there. Take a seat.

35
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:29,389
There must be a lot of things
you'd like to hear from me.

36
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:31,189
Don't think about
doing anything stupid.

37
00:02:32,689 --> 00:02:36,789
Kang Ki Hyung, your pet
is rather noisy.

38
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:40,199
You won't be able to step out
of this room.

39
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,469
Do you want to make a bet?

40
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:48,939
Let's see if I can just walk out
of this room in 10 minutes or not.

41
00:03:09,229 --> 00:03:11,099
Do you know about Rimbaud, the poet?

42
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:15,900
He is a crazy man who died
because he liked coffee so much.

43
00:03:23,009 --> 00:03:24,080
Kang Ki Hyung.

44
00:03:25,979 --> 00:03:27,580
Do you think I'm crazy?

45
00:03:28,009 --> 00:03:29,780
Don't try to fool around with me.

46
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:31,219
Oh, my.

47
00:03:32,219 --> 00:03:36,349
It'd be nice if you could just
admit that in the end,

48
00:03:36,689 --> 00:03:38,719
you are just like me.

49
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:41,360
You are just a killing machine.

50
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:44,629
Why do you think I'm like this?

51
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,930
Don't even dream of making a deal...

52
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,169
with me.

53
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:52,099
Why am I like this?

54
00:03:53,969 --> 00:03:55,009
Why?

55
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,009
Once upon a time, there was a boy.

56
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,349
He had a father who beat him
every day,

57
00:04:01,979 --> 00:04:03,979
and a mother who had to lay low
like a dead body.

58
00:04:05,449 --> 00:04:07,289
Living was no better than being dead
to him.

59
00:04:07,949 --> 00:04:11,919
Nobody paid attention to that boy.

60
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:14,860
Just before he nearly lost his life,

61
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:17,560
to escape from the fiery fit,

62
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,259
he set the place on fire.

63
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,170
He barely escaped.

64
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:29,740
That boy was imprisoned
in the mental hospital...

65
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,439
when he was 14 years old.

66
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:35,250
He had a hard time
after he killed his parents.

67
00:04:35,649 --> 00:04:38,050
While he was imprisoned
in the mental hospital,

68
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:40,490
he was injected
with unknown substances,

69
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:43,189
beaten up, and experienced
auditory hallucinations.

70
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:46,389
The boy was abused continuously...

71
00:04:46,389 --> 00:04:49,629
and racked by the guilt
of having killed his parents.

72
00:04:50,529 --> 00:04:52,959
So he set the hospital on fire
and escaped.

73
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:54,970
And then...

74
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,910
he became a real devil.

75
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,310
Once people make mistakes,

76
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:10,480
it's hard to escape from the
viscous cycle.

77
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,879
Humans act weak to the strong,

78
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:15,550
and strong to the weak.

79
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:17,560
Kang Ki Hyung.

80
00:05:18,189 --> 00:05:20,660
Do you know what people
call this kind of society?

81
00:05:21,259 --> 00:05:24,500
Kim Yong Chul,
I understand your pain.

82
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,730
But you do not know
what pain is like...

83
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,339
because you can't feel anything.

84
00:05:35,009 --> 00:05:37,680
You even killed people...

85
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,279
that the society doesn't care about,

86
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:45,579
that are without rights,
and forgotten by others.

87
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,949
That's your problem.

88
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:51,490
Can't you think simply?

89
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:57,129
Chief Director Baek San
understood me.

90
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,959
But then,

91
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:02,829
he's the type that pushes his luck.

92
00:06:19,449 --> 00:06:20,649
I told you.

93
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:24,019
I'll get to walk out of here
on my own accord.

94
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:28,089
But don't you want to know...

95
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:31,459
what's inside the bag that belongs
to a psychopath?

96
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,230
What is this?

97
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:39,540
This is my ticket
to my way out of here.

98
00:07:07,829 --> 00:07:10,000
You must know that
there's been a lot of word...

99
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,100
going around inside and outside
of NCI about Sun Woo.

100
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:15,410
Fortunately, at the scene
of the incident,

101
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,810
detectives from the police station
in charge were present,

102
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:19,639
so it was considered as
self-defense.

103
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:23,110
She only received three months
suspension from the job,

104
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:27,550
but it's also true that the status
of NCI fell greatly because of it.

105
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:33,620
This lecture is one way
we can calm down...

106
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,829
the negative public sentiment.

107
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:39,459
We need to inform people in and out
of NCI that we're still..

108
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:41,629
in a great state
through the lecture.

109
00:07:42,269 --> 00:07:44,839
One profiler compared the job
to Samjokgu,

110
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,899
an imaginary animal that
appears in Jeju Island's folktale.

111
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,709
It's an animal that can catch
the legendary fox with nine tails.

112
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,579
It's helpful to humans,

113
00:07:52,579 --> 00:07:56,350
but with only three legs, it's an
incomplete being in the real world.

114
00:07:56,509 --> 00:08:00,019
Historically, it's been said that
its incompleteness...

115
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,990
is its simple but perfect weapon
that allows it...

116
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:05,620
to hunt the legendary fox.

117
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:09,629
It stays near humans,
but it cannot be one of them.

118
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:13,629
But when the danger is imminent,
it does its job.

119
00:08:13,829 --> 00:08:17,569
The good and bad represented by
Samjokgu and the legendary fox...

120
00:08:17,769 --> 00:08:21,509
is like the relationship of
a profiler and a psychopath.

121
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:24,509
If crimes ceased to exist,

122
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:27,980
there would no longer be
profilers like us.

123
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:30,850
We'll take some questions now.

124
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:32,120
Do you have any questions?

125
00:08:33,649 --> 00:08:34,690
Yes?

126
00:08:37,889 --> 00:08:42,029
By saying that you can catch
criminals by thinking like them,

127
00:08:42,029 --> 00:08:45,500
are you saying that the criminals
and the profilers...

128
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,929
are on the same line, like two
different sides of the same coin?

129
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:53,100
Just like you said, the features of
profilers and psychopaths...

130
00:08:53,539 --> 00:08:55,240
are like two different sides
of the same coin.

131
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,840
It's all about not crossing the line
between the good and the bad.

132
00:08:59,309 --> 00:09:01,309
And protecting law and justice.

133
00:09:01,649 --> 00:09:05,480
That would be the eternal dilemma...

134
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:07,250
and issue for profilers.

135
00:09:08,289 --> 00:09:10,490
I'd like to ask
Profiler Kang Ki Hyung a question.

136
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:13,789
It's been a while since the Reaper
has escaped from prison.

137
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:16,490
If you're on the other side of
the coin like you said,

138
00:09:16,659 --> 00:09:19,259
you must know what the Reaper
must have on his mind.

139
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:22,169
Why haven't you arrested him yet?

140
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,740
And what do you think made him...

141
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,899
stop killing after escaping
from prison?

142
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:31,639
I'm sorry, but I do not think I can
answer that question here.

143
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:33,509
Please understand.

144
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:36,649
But I can tell you this.
We can arrest him,

145
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,919
and we will.

146
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:43,549
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

147
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,889
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

148
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:48,090
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

149
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,769
Can I have your autograph?

150
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:00,809
Where did you get this book?

151
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:03,110
It has gone out of print
and is hard to come by.

152
00:10:04,379 --> 00:10:05,610
Here.

153
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,509
What's your name?

154
00:10:07,509 --> 00:10:11,779
Yes. I'm a future profiler,
Ko Joon Hee.

155
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,889
(Root of Evil)

156
00:10:21,029 --> 00:10:22,029
Good luck.

157
00:10:23,929 --> 00:10:26,299
Can I get your business card?

158
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:41,149
The office looks empty
without Sun Woo.

159
00:10:41,549 --> 00:10:42,580
I know.

160
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:45,919
I didn't know Sun Woo had taken
such a big part of my heart.

161
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,320
Should we send her a picture?

162
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:50,519
Why not?

163
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:51,990
- Take a picture of me here.
- Okay.

164
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:53,990
Here we go.

165
00:10:57,759 --> 00:10:58,929
(You can use live focus.)

166
00:10:58,929 --> 00:11:00,799
1, 2, 3.

167
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:04,340
How do I look? Let me take a look.

168
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:07,509
The background looks
a little too empty.

169
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:10,940
It does. Sun Woo might be worried.

170
00:11:11,509 --> 00:11:12,980
In that case, let's do this.

171
00:11:15,009 --> 00:11:16,610
Blurring the background makes it
look a lot better.

172
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:17,679
It does.

173
00:11:18,019 --> 00:11:20,679
We're still working hard.

174
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:21,919
Don't worry.

175
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:24,889
I look much better like this.

176
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:26,990
Should I send this?

177
00:11:27,929 --> 00:11:28,960
Send.

178
00:11:29,029 --> 00:11:30,090
(Loading)

179
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:31,830
(The image has been saved
to the camera folder.)

180
00:11:38,769 --> 00:11:40,139
I'm so sorry.

181
00:11:54,649 --> 00:11:56,389
Do you want some help?

182
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:10,730
Here.

183
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,299
We found her early this morning.

184
00:12:42,299 --> 00:12:44,029
Out of her belongings,

185
00:12:44,669 --> 00:12:47,570
we found your business card.

186
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,509
What's her identity?

187
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:53,509
She's a student
majoring in criminal psychology.

188
00:12:55,009 --> 00:12:59,279
Yes. I'm a future profiler,
Ko Joon Hee.

189
00:13:07,659 --> 00:13:10,059
The first one who found her
is a detective from this area.

190
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,960
Detective Choi.

191
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,269
I'm Choi Hyun Jin. I work
in the Female and Youth Division.

192
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,570
I'm Kang Ki Hyung.

193
00:13:22,809 --> 00:13:25,009
Did you find anything suspicious?

194
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,649
(Root of Evil)

195
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:30,779
(Ko Joon Hee)

196
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,019
We found it on the scene.

197
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,019
The scene?

198
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,190
Are you referring to here?

199
00:13:43,659 --> 00:13:44,659
No.

200
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:47,899
Where she was kidnapped is different
from where we found her.

201
00:13:48,929 --> 00:13:52,399
This book was found in an alley
near her home.

202
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:54,169
When we checked the CCTV,

203
00:13:54,169 --> 00:13:56,269
we confirmed
that she was kidnapped there.

204
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,080
Sir.

205
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,679
Something's bothering me.

206
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:13,559
Ko Joon Hee's parents received
a video of her being tortured.

207
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:17,159
The way she was kidnapped...

208
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,960
resembles Song Yoo Kyung's case.

209
00:14:21,769 --> 00:14:22,830
Could it be a copycat crime?

210
00:14:27,769 --> 00:14:29,039
Do you want some help?

211
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,149
- Honey.
- Yes?

212
00:14:42,149 --> 00:14:43,919
Let's watch it together.

213
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:44,990
Okay.

214
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:50,490
What is it? It sounds strange.

215
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:03,309
I need to go see
the victim's mother.

216
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:12,850
Is the field where we found
your daughter...

217
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,620
a special place...

218
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:19,690
for you and Joon Hee?

219
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:23,759
They tore it down,

220
00:15:25,659 --> 00:15:27,529
and it's just a lot now,

221
00:15:28,169 --> 00:15:29,769
but it was the very first...

222
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:31,970
place we bought.

223
00:15:33,269 --> 00:15:35,370
It's where Joon Hee was born.

224
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,940
Even after we moved,

225
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,710
the two of us sometimes...

226
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:47,820
went to visit.

227
00:15:58,299 --> 00:15:59,899
(Criminal Psychology)

228
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:26,059
It bothers me...

229
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:30,190
that she came to listen
to our lecture that day.

230
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:37,740
If the criminal is copying
Song Yoo Kyung's case,

231
00:16:37,769 --> 00:16:39,600
could he have an accomplice too?

232
00:16:39,669 --> 00:16:41,710
It's a possibility.

233
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,509
Copycat criminals...

234
00:16:43,509 --> 00:16:45,639
consider themselves as equals
as the original criminal.

235
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:47,139
Not only do they copy the crimes,

236
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:50,250
but they also think
they're at the same level.

237
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:53,649
Are you saying they see the
murderers as heroes?

238
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,720
Most copycat criminals...

239
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:59,419
put themselves in the same level
as the murderers and admire them.

240
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,759
It's like a fandom.

241
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,329
They praise the murderer
and admire their crimes.

242
00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:05,900
If it's a planned copycat murder,

243
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:09,000
they copy it exactly
as if reviewing the original.

244
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,200
They would understand the crimes
inside and out.

245
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,569
The culprit for this case...

246
00:17:12,569 --> 00:17:16,069
copied the methods and pattern
of the Song Yoo Kyung case.

247
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:18,809
It's as if he saw it in person
and replicated it.

248
00:17:18,809 --> 00:17:20,539
The problem here...

249
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:23,809
is that he didn't just copy
the method and pattern.

250
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:27,220
Leaving the corpse
in the meaningful place...

251
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,950
for the mother and the victim...

252
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:31,019
is not something others know.

253
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:34,160
That was the unrevealed signature
of the Song Yoo Kyung case too.

254
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:36,759
How did the murderer...

255
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:38,660
know about that signature?

256
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:43,329
(Author Son Suk Ju,
publishing event)

257
00:17:46,069 --> 00:17:47,140
I thought...

258
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:51,509
he was hiding to avoid the Reaper
who escaped from prison.

259
00:17:51,579 --> 00:17:53,380
It's surprising to see him here.

260
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:55,880
While Kim Yong Chul
hid his true identity...

261
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,980
and lived with the victim's name,

262
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:00,849
Son Suk Ju was the only person
he kept in contact with.

263
00:18:00,849 --> 00:18:03,190
It's about Reporter Son Suk Ju.

264
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:05,359
I was checking on his whereabouts...

265
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:08,890
when I noticed that he called and
received calls from one number.

266
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:10,759
Why would Reporter Son Suk Ju...

267
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:21,440
The book is mostly about
the interviews of the case.

268
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:24,069
That means,
it would have been impossible...

269
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:25,579
to write such things
without contacting Kim Yong Chul.

270
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,609
Anyway,

271
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,009
he's the person that knows...

272
00:18:30,349 --> 00:18:33,349
about the murderer Reaper's
true identity, Kim Yong Chul.

273
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:40,420
- I'm sure he expected this.
- There's an announcement.

274
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:43,259
The scheduled meet and greet
with Son Suk Ju at 3pm...

275
00:18:43,259 --> 00:18:45,700
has been canceled
due to personal reasons.

276
00:18:46,329 --> 00:18:47,900
I repeat.

277
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:51,299
The scheduled meet and greet
with Son Suk Ju at 3pm...

278
00:19:00,579 --> 00:19:04,720
(Me, me, me)

279
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:21,200
Are you all right?

280
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:26,069
That's why I told you
to take a vacation.

281
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,599
How was the lecture?

282
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:29,839
Good.

283
00:19:32,609 --> 00:19:33,910
Someone asked a question.

284
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:39,150
"If you think
like the psychopathic criminals,"

285
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:41,490
"why can't you catch the Reaper?"

286
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:44,390
It'll only get more difficult...

287
00:19:45,859 --> 00:19:48,160
to not to go past that line...

288
00:19:49,029 --> 00:19:50,559
when we're on the border.

289
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:56,799
Give yourself some time to rest.

290
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:59,539
I heard
there was a copycat murder case.

291
00:19:59,539 --> 00:20:00,539
Yes.

292
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:04,809
They even copied the signature
that wasn't exposed through media.

293
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:07,640
I think Son Suk Ju disappeared
for good.

294
00:20:09,049 --> 00:20:11,950
I went through his email records,
and they were sent from the US.

295
00:20:12,019 --> 00:20:13,519
However, he never left the country.

296
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:16,190
Do you think it has something
to do with the Reaper?

297
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:18,420
The scheduled meet and greet
was canceled.

298
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:21,259
Even the publisher doesn't know
where he is.

299
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,930
How can he suddenly
get out of reach?

300
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:26,829
It's strange.

301
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Sun Woo.

302
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:37,210
No, it's nothing.

303
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:57,329
Why did you suddenly barge in?
We almost crashed!

304
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,519
Are you crazy?

305
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,589
This will be recorded
on my dash cam.

306
00:21:21,589 --> 00:21:23,049
What a crazy man.

307
00:21:23,049 --> 00:21:24,150
Gosh.

308
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,990
Are you all right?

309
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:00,990
What happened?

310
00:22:01,859 --> 00:22:03,289
I'll call an ambulance for you.

311
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:26,150
Jang Ae Ran. She's a victim
of shooting incident...

312
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:28,420
that happened around 3am
near the beltway entrance...

313
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:29,789
by Sin Mok Stream.

314
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:32,859
The culprit chose highway at dawn
on purpose...

315
00:22:32,859 --> 00:22:34,319
when there's no one.

316
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:36,589
There's an entrance to the
construction...

317
00:22:36,589 --> 00:22:38,099
that's connected to the nearby
intersection.

318
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:42,430
The road just opened, so there's no
surveillance camera yet.

319
00:22:43,369 --> 00:22:46,900
Considering the victim's age,
gender, the use of a shotgun,

320
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:50,710
and choosing the construction area
where the road gets narrow,

321
00:22:50,809 --> 00:22:52,410
it's just like Jang Gi Tae incident.

322
00:23:05,789 --> 00:23:06,819
Hey.

323
00:23:12,299 --> 00:23:13,299
Are you all right?

324
00:23:13,299 --> 00:23:15,470
It's fine.
I'll call an ambulance for you.

325
00:23:28,109 --> 00:23:31,450
He perfectly reenacted even the
details of the crime.

326
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:34,450
He's not a simple copycat.

327
00:23:42,759 --> 00:23:46,599
2 copycat crimes occurred
in just 2 weeks.

328
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:48,700
It not only happened in short time,

329
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:51,940
but if the public finds out
he imitated the crime NCI solved,

330
00:23:52,039 --> 00:23:55,970
it'll become a huge issue.

331
00:23:56,109 --> 00:23:59,079
We'll suppress the media as much as
possible and resolve it.

332
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:02,980
This is very strange.

333
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:09,420
Do you think there's someone
behind this incident?

334
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,990
There will be a limit to stop the
pressure from the superior office,

335
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:17,690
but I'll try my best to support you.

336
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,670
Resolve the case...

337
00:24:23,299 --> 00:24:25,500
as if it'll be your last one.

338
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:27,740
Yes, sir.

339
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:49,660
(The Reaper)

340
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:10,549
The dash cam and even the navigation
are completely destroyed.

341
00:25:10,849 --> 00:25:12,980
He's not a human.

342
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:17,049
How could he do this to someone?

343
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:19,059
He visited the site in advance,

344
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:20,859
and committed crime meticulously.

345
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:25,359
He expressed his anger
even more than Jang Gi Tae.

346
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,200
He shot the shoulder first,

347
00:25:27,829 --> 00:25:30,630
and fired at random
after the car stopped.

348
00:25:30,869 --> 00:25:34,569
It's the same method as the last
victim of Jang Gi Tae incident.

349
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:37,210
He committed crime...

350
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:40,210
with an evolved pattern of
Jang Gi Tae.

351
00:25:42,309 --> 00:25:43,980
Who would do this?

352
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:46,349
And why?

353
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:52,420
She has...

354
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:55,430
an initial bracelet on her wrist.

355
00:25:59,029 --> 00:26:01,970
He passed over the previous victim's
belonging to the next one.

356
00:26:04,769 --> 00:26:06,470
That's the Reaper's signature.

357
00:26:07,069 --> 00:26:09,910
Go over Kang Ho Young incident
again.

358
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:14,009
If he's really behind this,

359
00:26:15,779 --> 00:26:17,710
that's where we should start.

360
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,680
Yes, sir.

361
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:23,119
I looked over all the documents
you mentioned.

362
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,730
A button on the trousers is missing.

363
00:26:30,259 --> 00:26:32,460
According to the forensics
in charge of the case,

364
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:35,730
there was never a button
on the trousers.

365
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:39,440
They searched the area,
but never found it.

366
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:51,410
A button?

367
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:53,750
There wasn't any.

368
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,869
JH...

369
00:27:10,529 --> 00:27:12,900
could be Ko Joon Hee's initials.

370
00:27:13,869 --> 00:27:15,440
It's highly likely.

371
00:27:17,609 --> 00:27:20,680
According to the victim's mother,
she wore this necklace...

372
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:22,309
for a few years.

373
00:27:23,509 --> 00:27:25,680
Is this really from the Reaper?

374
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:29,490
Why would the Reaper do this?

375
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:45,400
("A Serial Murder Took Place in the
Same Town at Dawn")

376
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,019
What about this one?

377
00:28:08,589 --> 00:28:11,160
It will hide your belly.

378
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,329
I don't have belly.

379
00:28:12,329 --> 00:28:14,259
I'm saying even if you get belly...

380
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,099
For me? Really?

381
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,670
What's gotten into you?

382
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:37,690
Hae Won.

383
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:51,529
Remember, Kang Ki Hyung.

384
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:54,299
He'll never give up.

385
00:29:18,859 --> 00:29:21,869
(The Phantom Club)

386
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:40,650
(Criminal Psychology Research Club)

387
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:43,190
Hey, Nana. Can you...

388
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:45,759
Can I do it later?

389
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:48,119
I'm quite busy right now. I'm sorry.

390
00:29:48,359 --> 00:29:49,730
Nana. Where are you...

391
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:19,220
This book...

392
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:22,390
has two people's writings.

393
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:26,099
It has mixed tenses.

394
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:30,670
Also, everyone has his or her own
way of writing,

395
00:30:31,299 --> 00:30:33,240
but the expressions used here...

396
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:36,410
aren't just one person's.

397
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:42,710
I'm so nervous. Why do I get
so nervous from seeing you?

398
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:44,210
How did it go?

399
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:49,089
Ever since the book was published,

400
00:30:49,089 --> 00:30:51,589
there's been an increase of
secret fan clubs.

401
00:30:51,819 --> 00:30:53,859
I looked into every website.

402
00:30:53,859 --> 00:30:56,190
First, you access through
a normal domain,

403
00:30:56,289 --> 00:30:58,490
but once another website
approves you,

404
00:30:58,730 --> 00:31:00,029
you'll get an invitation.

405
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:02,970
Then there will be
an administrator's approval.

406
00:31:03,269 --> 00:31:06,170
You can finally join the website
after that.

407
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,440
That's not the end.

408
00:31:08,809 --> 00:31:10,109
After you put the password,

409
00:31:10,109 --> 00:31:12,640
there's a code they share.

410
00:31:13,309 --> 00:31:15,750
There's a shield to prevent
anyone from accessing.

411
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:18,150
It's a complete secret club.

412
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:20,880
I was able to break through
the protection program,

413
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,920
but it's crazy.

414
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:26,259
I don't understand why they make
something so horrible.

415
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:29,190
(The Reaper)

416
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:34,230
But I couldn't break
the final stage.

417
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:38,029
I'd be able to find something
only if I could break it,

418
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:40,769
but there's a lock on the password.

419
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:42,769
What are we going to do now?

420
00:31:46,839 --> 00:31:48,809
Han! What are you doing here?

421
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:56,690
I think I know the password.

422
00:32:06,029 --> 00:32:08,500
The secret school book clubs...

423
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:11,000
hide the password in books.

424
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,640
If we were to say...

425
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,440
that this...

426
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:19,710
was written by the Reaper,

427
00:32:20,579 --> 00:32:22,109
not Reporter Son Suk Ju,

428
00:32:22,509 --> 00:32:25,180
the first IP number would refer...

429
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:26,519
to his first book.

430
00:32:28,549 --> 00:32:31,390
If that's the case,
the 3rd IP number "232"...

431
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:32,759
would indicate
the total pages of this book.

432
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,529
The 2nd number "11"
refers to the number of chapters,

433
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:41,859
and the 4th number "27"
refers to the line.

434
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:43,769
"The man that undoes the buttons..."

435
00:32:44,329 --> 00:32:47,039
"goes past a woman's hand
with rings on it..."

436
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,910
"and picks up his glasses."

437
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:52,609
Let's pick words from here
and type them in.

438
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:59,220
Button, man, ring,

439
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,519
woman, hand, and glasses.

440
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:05,789
Wait.

441
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:07,960
Buttons and rings are...

442
00:33:08,259 --> 00:33:11,460
signatures from recent
serial copycat crimes.

443
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:13,630
I'll choose...

444
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:16,670
things that can be left behind
and arrange them again.

445
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,069
Oh, my gosh.

446
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:30,309
Buttons and rings have already been
used as signatures.

447
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:32,079
Then what would...

448
00:33:33,319 --> 00:33:34,349
the glasses mean?

449
00:33:34,349 --> 00:33:37,490
(The Phantom Club)

450
00:33:38,859 --> 00:33:39,960
What if...

451
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,829
Team Manager Kang,
if you think about it,

452
00:33:44,059 --> 00:33:46,829
the fact that the Reaper leaves
unique signatures...

453
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:49,470
is something that everyone can
recognize if they have...

454
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:50,930
studied criminology.

455
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,839
The media has covered
the data as well.

456
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:58,779
The problem is that the copycat
had Kang Ho Young's buttons.

457
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:02,650
That means that the Reaper
and the copycat are related.

458
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:06,079
The copycat must be
committing murder...

459
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:08,280
under the order of
the Reaper or someone related...

460
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,789
to the Reaper.

461
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:16,230
Team Manager Kang,

462
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:19,230
I'm not sure if I should be
doing this, but...

463
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:25,300
The culprit has been telling us
the dates of the murders.

464
00:34:30,309 --> 00:34:33,079
What do you mean he was telling us?
What do you mean?

465
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:36,650
I thought you were suspended.

466
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:42,719
Team Manager Kang, arresting
the Reaper is more important.

467
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:45,019
I'll try to be careful.

468
00:34:55,829 --> 00:34:57,400
(The Phantom Club)

469
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,070
This is the website that worships
the Reaper.

470
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:02,070
If you look at the dates
at the bottom of the page,

471
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:05,440
these indicate dates prior
to the recent serial murders.

472
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:08,210
Someone had been announcing...

473
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:10,179
the murder in advance.

474
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:14,519
It's just like we thought.
Someone had given orders,

475
00:35:14,519 --> 00:35:17,150
and the copycat committed
the murder on the given date.

476
00:35:17,619 --> 00:35:21,090
That means it could be any one of
the members from this website.

477
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:22,860
We searched through the website,

478
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:24,989
but that was all the indication
of dates we could find.

479
00:35:25,159 --> 00:35:27,900
There hasn't been a notice
indicating the next murder.

480
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,500
Keep checking the website,

481
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:32,900
and find out about the members and
the administrators of the website.

482
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:34,340
Yes, sir.

483
00:35:35,469 --> 00:35:37,840
This is really like a phantom club.

484
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:40,380
We can't check their personal
details with this.

485
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:42,380
If you look at the pattern
of the 1st and the 2nd case,

486
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:43,880
after someone uploads
the fanfiction,

487
00:35:43,949 --> 00:35:46,150
the murder happens within five days.

488
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:49,389
Team Manager Kang,

489
00:35:49,619 --> 00:35:52,050
I've been tracking the IP address
of the administrator.

490
00:35:52,389 --> 00:35:55,190
The website has been managed
secretly,

491
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,360
and it's been using proxy servers.

492
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,059
It's impossible for me
to track anymore.

493
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:01,800
We do not know...

494
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,699
when the murder would happen,

495
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:06,670
who the victim would be,

496
00:36:06,869 --> 00:36:08,639
nor which crime he would copy.

497
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:10,739
We can't determine
the time of the murder either.

498
00:36:10,809 --> 00:36:12,010
The story...

499
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:14,340
just indicates the place.

500
00:36:15,909 --> 00:36:16,909
Team Manager Kang,

501
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:19,380
another fanfiction story
has been updated.

502
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:28,489
(The Phantom Club)

503
00:36:28,489 --> 00:36:31,590
(The Third Fanfiction)

504
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:34,460
(Jeongbalsan Station Exit 1)

505
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:00,960
(Daekwang Church)

506
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,659
The man wearing a cap...

507
00:37:03,889 --> 00:37:06,500
goes deeper inside
while lowering himself.

508
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:08,059
In the dark room,

509
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:10,329
a middle-aged man puts his hand
in pure water...

510
00:37:10,329 --> 00:37:11,969
and bows down.

511
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:16,110
That's when the man's knife
heads toward the other's neck.

512
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,750
Help me! Help me!

513
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:08,519
Help me. Please help me.

514
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:09,760
Someone is trying to kill me.

515
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,730
Please help me.

516
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:16,500
Why are you doing this to me? Why?

517
00:38:16,699 --> 00:38:18,300
Please don't kill me.

518
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:52,369
The man covers the middle-aged man's
eyes with a black cloth.

519
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,800
After killing the middle-aged man,

520
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,969
the man leaves like a shadow.

521
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:09,550
The story is describing
the crime scene in detail again.

522
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:17,159
Stained glass. In front of a cross.

523
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:19,630
A middle-aged man who bows his head.

524
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,469
The story is describing a church.

525
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
The culprit...

526
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:30,670
is trying to imitate Jung Do Il
and commit a murder at a church.

527
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,380
Only public law shall be like water.

528
00:39:43,949 --> 00:39:46,820
Team Manager Kang, the culprit
has committed another murder.

529
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:53,429
This time, the culprit committed
murder at the same time that...

530
00:39:53,699 --> 00:39:55,300
the story was updated.

531
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:58,369
- They're here.
- They're here.

532
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,039
Does this case have anything
to do with the past cases of NCI?

533
00:40:03,039 --> 00:40:04,510
This does not seem to be
the copycat's crime.

534
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:06,039
What does the NCI think about this?

535
00:40:06,039 --> 00:40:08,380
People have been saying that
the Reaper is behind this.

536
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:10,250
What do you think about this?

537
00:40:10,309 --> 00:40:12,719
- Please make a comment on it.
- Please say a word.

538
00:40:12,719 --> 00:40:15,420
- Please comment.
- Please say something.

539
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:35,699
He did copy Jung Do Il's case,

540
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:37,769
but the pattern is
a little different.

541
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,440
It's not like the previous murders,

542
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:43,710
which were conducted in
a relaxed and a calm state.

543
00:40:45,449 --> 00:40:48,849
Also, this is not the place that
was mentioned in the story.

544
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,489
The wounds suggest...

545
00:40:53,889 --> 00:40:57,690
that the culprit stabbed the
victims' bodies hastily.

546
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:27,420
The victims must have run
all the way here...

547
00:41:27,559 --> 00:41:30,329
from the church to escape
from the culprit.

548
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:33,199
This would only be possible
if the culprit had been...

549
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:34,599
met with an unexpected situation.

550
00:41:35,829 --> 00:41:38,500
The culprit would have been
startled by the situation,

551
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,440
but he could not postpone...

552
00:41:41,239 --> 00:41:42,840
the D-Day.

553
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:46,039
The period between each
murder is getting shorter.

554
00:41:47,079 --> 00:41:49,039
They probably want to
prove to the world...

555
00:41:49,179 --> 00:41:51,050
that we are not strong...

556
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:53,780
and that the government
authority can fail.

557
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,320
But why didn't they...

558
00:41:57,550 --> 00:42:00,719
leave the previous victim's
belongings as a signature?

559
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:06,730
This was left next to the body.

560
00:42:07,099 --> 00:42:08,630
I thought it was the victim's,

561
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:10,829
but according to his family,
they're not his glasses.

562
00:42:13,969 --> 00:42:15,440
(Written by Son Suk Ju)

563
00:42:16,739 --> 00:42:18,340
It's Son Suk Ju's glasses.

564
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:25,449
On four different
fan fiction uploads,

565
00:42:25,449 --> 00:42:27,420
there is a comment that's
repeatedly uploaded.

566
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:32,349
What is this "MW99"
that's right beside the comment?

567
00:42:32,559 --> 00:42:35,460
I'm not sure. Could it be
the administrator's nickname?

568
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:36,530
What could it mean?

569
00:42:37,489 --> 00:42:39,929
It looks like an abbreviation
of some sort.

570
00:42:40,429 --> 00:42:43,900
Could it be like a secret code
that only they know?

571
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:45,869
If it's their code,

572
00:42:46,139 --> 00:42:49,539
then "MW" must be referring
to the same thing.

573
00:42:49,539 --> 00:42:50,570
I'll look it up.

574
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:55,440
"Mystery World".

575
00:42:55,949 --> 00:42:58,210
The "MW" stands for "Mystery World".

576
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:00,619
It's a tabloid newspaper provided
for the mystery novel advocates...

577
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:04,320
and the students majoring
in criminal psychology.

578
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:09,559
I'm sure there will be a clue
somewhere on here.

579
00:43:12,159 --> 00:43:14,500
Detective club members
are usually...

580
00:43:15,159 --> 00:43:17,969
the main readers
of chain newspapers like us.

581
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:21,369
It's hard to select
which story to publish.

582
00:43:21,539 --> 00:43:24,239
Do you know where these papers
are distributed?

583
00:43:24,539 --> 00:43:27,409
Mostly to universities
and mystery club rooms.

584
00:43:27,739 --> 00:43:29,780
If we weren't servicing online,

585
00:43:30,010 --> 00:43:31,750
we wouldn't have any business.

586
00:43:32,449 --> 00:43:35,150
People continue to buy space
for advertisement,

587
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:36,750
so we're able to make a living.

588
00:43:37,090 --> 00:43:38,090
Advertisements?

589
00:43:38,349 --> 00:43:40,389
Sun Woo, look at this.

590
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:42,889
Look at these past advertisements.

591
00:43:43,090 --> 00:43:45,030
This is the same location and time
for Ko Joon Hee's case,

592
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:48,559
and this one matches
Jang Ae Ran's case.

593
00:43:50,099 --> 00:43:52,869
Can you tell us
who paid for these advertisements?

594
00:43:52,969 --> 00:43:54,469
Those?

595
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,610
They just sent us money
starting last month.

596
00:43:57,869 --> 00:44:00,010
They wanted to stay anonymous.

597
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,679
It's hard to find out exactly who.

598
00:44:03,679 --> 00:44:07,250
We're happy to print advertisements
as long as we're paid.

599
00:44:18,659 --> 00:44:19,659
Yes.

600
00:44:19,659 --> 00:44:22,500
Sir, the criminals used
newspaper advertisements...

601
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:24,969
to share the time and location
in advance.

602
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:26,900
Okay.

603
00:44:35,909 --> 00:44:38,050
Check the CCTV footages
from the day of the lecture,

604
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:40,480
and compare them to the CCTV
footages of this area.

605
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:43,019
See if there is anyone
that look the same.

606
00:44:44,849 --> 00:44:45,889
Okay.

607
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:54,429
(Unidentified Number)

608
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:03,969
(Unidentified Number)

609
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:11,449
It's been a while, Kang Ki Hyung.

610
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:16,420
How are they?

611
00:45:17,849 --> 00:45:20,920
Do you like my presents this time?

612
00:45:21,559 --> 00:45:23,690
If you're still trying
to make a deal with me,

613
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:26,360
it'd be better that you stop.

614
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:38,710
I guess
you didn't like the presents.

615
00:45:38,809 --> 00:45:40,039
Kim Yong Chul.

616
00:45:41,039 --> 00:45:44,480
It's me that you want.
Don't touch other people.

617
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:49,150
I'm not sure.

618
00:45:51,550 --> 00:45:53,489
I must be getting old.

619
00:45:54,989 --> 00:45:57,630
I'm getting greedy.

620
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,030
Do you like surprises?

621
00:46:07,269 --> 00:46:08,400
Kim Yong Chul.

622
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:12,670
You scared me.

623
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,380
You must like surprises...

624
00:46:16,579 --> 00:46:19,880
to startle me like that.
You can look forward to it...

625
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:23,320
because it's going to get fun.

626
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:01,619
No. I'm fine, Mom.

627
00:47:01,889 --> 00:47:03,730
Something busy came up for him
at work.

628
00:47:04,829 --> 00:47:06,030
It's nothing.

629
00:47:06,659 --> 00:47:08,199
I told you, everything's fine.

630
00:47:08,929 --> 00:47:10,500
Dad's always busy.

631
00:47:11,670 --> 00:47:15,800
Mom. I'm fine, so don't worry.

632
00:47:16,210 --> 00:47:17,269
Okay?

633
00:47:35,389 --> 00:47:39,429
Sir, I analyzed the CCTVs
near the scene of the third murder.

634
00:47:40,099 --> 00:47:42,730
Out of the people
that were at the open lecture,

635
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:46,130
I found the identities
of three people that look similar.

636
00:47:46,670 --> 00:47:48,969
All three are rather tall,

637
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:51,210
and they're members
of the mystery club.

638
00:47:51,539 --> 00:47:54,880
All three of them were at the
lecture with Ko Joon Hee.

639
00:47:55,679 --> 00:47:58,409
Check if any of the three
have relationships...

640
00:47:58,409 --> 00:48:00,219
with the other victims.

641
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:03,820
Also, check their criminal records
or anything out of ordinary.

642
00:48:04,019 --> 00:48:05,650
Yes, sir. I'll check right away.

643
00:48:06,690 --> 00:48:08,860
What could the Reaper be planning?

644
00:48:09,059 --> 00:48:10,230
Gather the team for me.

645
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:11,960
Okay.

646
00:48:48,659 --> 00:48:50,530
Out of the cases we solved,

647
00:48:50,570 --> 00:48:53,369
let's condense down to the cases
with unique signatures.

648
00:48:53,369 --> 00:48:56,409
There aren't too many cases
the culprit can copy.

649
00:48:56,869 --> 00:48:57,869
Sir.

650
00:48:58,739 --> 00:49:00,980
There is another update
of the fan fiction.

651
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:05,380
It's a prediction
of the fourth murder.

652
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:09,989
(The Phantom Club)

653
00:49:09,989 --> 00:49:12,489
(There are cars passing by.
A man is in a car.)

654
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:33,440
Hello, I'm the one
that called yesterday.

655
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:37,079
I see you.

656
00:49:42,949 --> 00:49:44,449
No, I'll go over.

657
00:49:44,449 --> 00:49:47,960
(She laughs and says...)

658
00:49:49,619 --> 00:49:52,260
It's very close
to the Ahn Sang Cheol case...

659
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:54,429
that kidnapped women he met
by making secondhand deals.

660
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:58,469
If they uploaded a new posting,
there must be a new advertisement.

661
00:49:58,769 --> 00:50:00,440
I was just looking at it.

662
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:03,269
It just says 3:50pm for gathering.

663
00:50:04,969 --> 00:50:06,710
We only have three hours.

664
00:50:07,210 --> 00:50:08,780
We have to figure out
the location quickly.

665
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:11,809
Just as the fan fiction says,

666
00:50:12,010 --> 00:50:15,050
I'll look into bus stops
in front of department stores.

667
00:50:15,050 --> 00:50:16,550
I'll get started.

668
00:50:17,789 --> 00:50:20,489
In the fan fiction, there is
a passage that goes like this...

669
00:50:20,489 --> 00:50:21,690
before the deal happens.

670
00:50:22,659 --> 00:50:25,489
"I could feel the Reaper's phantom
that was chasing me."

671
00:50:25,989 --> 00:50:29,360
"The Reaper shattered into pieces
and scattered all over."

672
00:50:30,329 --> 00:50:31,699
"They jumbled up
in front of my eyes."

673
00:50:31,969 --> 00:50:32,969
This...

674
00:50:33,670 --> 00:50:36,199
must refer to anagrams.

675
00:50:37,210 --> 00:50:39,210
If the word "Reaper" gets scattered
and letters get mixed up...

676
00:50:39,369 --> 00:50:41,010
R, E, A, P, E, R.

677
00:50:41,179 --> 00:50:43,849
The letters in "Reaper" were used
to make new words.

678
00:50:44,010 --> 00:50:45,280
There are three vowels,

679
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:49,119
and on top of that,
they are two of the same vowel.

680
00:50:49,519 --> 00:50:50,750
You can't make a new word
from this combination.

681
00:50:55,059 --> 00:50:56,059
Parere.

682
00:50:56,429 --> 00:50:58,960
It means "to like" in Italian.

683
00:50:59,289 --> 00:51:01,630
Sir, parere is often used...

684
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:04,869
for naming restaurants or cafes.

685
00:51:05,769 --> 00:51:08,269
Nana. Out of the places you found,

686
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:11,769
are there any cafes with the word
"parere" in it?

687
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:13,639
Find out if there are any stores
with the word "parere".

688
00:51:14,210 --> 00:51:16,210
Yes. I'm sorting them out right now.

689
00:51:16,909 --> 00:51:19,750
Among them, within 1km,

690
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:22,550
there are three cafes
with the same initials.

691
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:25,050
Parere, amio parere,

692
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:26,920
and parere special rateau.

693
00:51:27,789 --> 00:51:30,429
We can't have a lot of manpower
in this secret investigation.

694
00:51:30,889 --> 00:51:32,829
You can only contact
the site support team.

695
00:51:32,829 --> 00:51:36,230
Divide into three places,
and lay in wait.

696
00:52:14,570 --> 00:52:17,440
(The Phantom Club)

697
00:52:24,949 --> 00:52:27,679
(The Reaper)

698
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:35,719
There must be at least one person...

699
00:52:36,489 --> 00:52:39,389
with a motive to murder
around the victims.

700
00:52:41,329 --> 00:52:42,360
Wait.

701
00:52:43,199 --> 00:52:44,269
Min Young.

702
00:52:45,630 --> 00:52:46,699
Look at this.

703
00:52:50,010 --> 00:52:51,110
The Phantom Club...

704
00:52:51,210 --> 00:52:53,480
originates from a mystery
solving website, "Journal Holmse".

705
00:52:54,309 --> 00:52:55,309
What about it?

706
00:52:55,309 --> 00:52:56,849
The first victim Ko Joon Hee.

707
00:52:57,050 --> 00:52:58,510
JH on her ring.

708
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:02,550
That's not her initials,

709
00:53:02,550 --> 00:53:04,320
but the website's initials?

710
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:05,619
Yes, I think so.

711
00:53:05,619 --> 00:53:07,659
Although this website is closed,

712
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:09,159
the initial administrator...

713
00:53:10,389 --> 00:53:11,690
was Ko Joon Hee.

714
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:16,030
It must be related to the suspects.

715
00:53:26,510 --> 00:53:28,510
Please look up a website called
Journal Holmse.

716
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:30,179
- Journal Holmse?
- Yes.

717
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:34,619
It's closed.

718
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:36,380
Look up...

719
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:39,320
if any of the suspects was a member
of the website.

720
00:53:43,219 --> 00:53:44,230
I found it.

721
00:53:44,690 --> 00:53:45,760
Kang Chi Hwan.

722
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:50,070
He's a classmate of the first
victim, Ko Joon Hee.

723
00:53:54,269 --> 00:53:56,809
If the birth of the Phantom Club
is Journal Holmse,

724
00:53:57,210 --> 00:54:01,380
it means both of them belonged
to the same club all along.

725
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:05,849
Look here.

726
00:54:05,849 --> 00:54:07,980
(Ko Joon Hee)

727
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:12,420
Do you think Ko Joon Hee realized
what Kang Chi Hwan was after?

728
00:54:12,650 --> 00:54:14,690
If they were in a relationship,

729
00:54:15,260 --> 00:54:16,929
it'd be easier to notice.

730
00:54:17,690 --> 00:54:21,230
What do you think made him stop
killing after escaping from prison?

731
00:54:24,199 --> 00:54:28,500
He currently goes to the same school
as Ko Joon Hee went to.

732
00:54:28,769 --> 00:54:30,309
He doesn't have any previous record,

733
00:54:30,309 --> 00:54:32,070
but he has a record of
early discharge...

734
00:54:32,070 --> 00:54:34,909
from the army due to
a mental illness.

735
00:54:36,309 --> 00:54:38,550
I searched the name Shin Hye Mi...

736
00:54:38,550 --> 00:54:39,980
who sent money to Mysterious World
account.

737
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:42,280
I confirmed...

738
00:54:42,849 --> 00:54:45,349
that those two are currently
operating Phantom Club.

739
00:54:45,650 --> 00:54:47,260
Send the suspect file...

740
00:54:47,889 --> 00:54:49,519
to Kim Hyun Jun immediately.

741
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:54,760
(Account details of Kang Chi Hwan)

742
00:54:55,329 --> 00:54:56,670
Phantom.

743
00:55:07,579 --> 00:55:08,940
It's 3:50pm.

744
00:55:09,010 --> 00:55:11,150
Do you think the culprit noticed?

745
00:55:25,829 --> 00:55:27,059
We had a breakout.

746
00:55:27,659 --> 00:55:30,369
There was a cleverly disguised IP.

747
00:55:31,530 --> 00:55:32,929
I'll change the plan.

748
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:39,610
Let's go out first.

749
00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:22,119
Are you here for a camera?

750
00:56:22,119 --> 00:56:24,590
Yes. You're late.

751
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:25,849
I'm sorry.

752
00:56:25,849 --> 00:56:28,519
It took me a while to find
a parking spot.

753
00:56:30,429 --> 00:56:32,489
Where's the camera?

754
00:56:32,489 --> 00:56:36,429
It's in the car.
I also brought some accessories.

755
00:56:37,730 --> 00:56:38,769
Will you go with me?

756
00:56:39,199 --> 00:56:40,539
I'll give you the camera,

757
00:56:41,039 --> 00:56:43,570
and I will also...

758
00:56:43,769 --> 00:56:44,940
give you a ride.

759
00:56:46,739 --> 00:56:47,739
Sure.

760
00:56:47,739 --> 00:56:48,840
Let's go.

761
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:13,300
It's Kang Chi Hwan.

762
00:57:14,139 --> 00:57:17,010
C48. By the crosswalk.
We found the suspect.

763
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:58,309
Move!

764
00:57:58,750 --> 00:57:59,750
Don't come.

765
00:58:01,619 --> 00:58:02,619
Come here.

766
00:58:02,750 --> 00:58:03,750
Come here.

767
00:58:08,219 --> 00:58:09,219
Kang Chi Hwan.

768
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:11,630
Put down the knife, and let's talk.

769
00:58:12,260 --> 00:58:14,130
We're not in that stage yet.

770
00:58:14,130 --> 00:58:15,300
Kang Chi Hwan.

771
00:58:18,699 --> 00:58:20,130
Everyone get out!

772
00:58:30,909 --> 00:58:32,949
What's going on?
What's wrong with him?

773
00:58:32,949 --> 00:58:33,949
What?

774
00:58:34,679 --> 00:58:36,889
What's going on?

775
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:39,489
My goodness.

776
00:58:39,789 --> 00:58:40,989
Put the gun down.

777
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:43,159
Put the gun down!

778
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:49,460
Kang Chi Hwan.

779
00:58:50,369 --> 00:58:51,429
Calm down.

780
00:58:58,469 --> 00:58:59,710
Let her go,

781
00:59:00,539 --> 00:59:01,809
and let's talk.

782
00:59:03,079 --> 00:59:04,679
We can talk this out.

783
00:59:06,809 --> 00:59:09,280
Don't try to trick me.

784
00:59:09,650 --> 00:59:10,789
No!

785
00:59:32,510 --> 00:59:35,309
You followed the posting
on the website.

786
00:59:35,309 --> 00:59:38,510
Don't you want to know what it feels
like to kill someone?

787
00:59:38,780 --> 00:59:40,519
There must be another follower.

788
00:59:41,150 --> 00:59:42,320
Chief Director?

789
00:59:42,820 --> 00:59:44,449
What are you trying to do with me?

790
00:59:44,590 --> 00:59:47,159
Kill her if you want to save
your daughter.

791
00:59:50,889 --> 00:59:52,889
You crazy jerk.

792
00:59:52,889 --> 00:59:55,059
You are just a killing machine.

793
00:59:55,199 --> 00:59:56,760
Now that he began,

794
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:58,400
he'll never stop.

795
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:02,039
The Reaper wanted to
destroy our team in the first place.
