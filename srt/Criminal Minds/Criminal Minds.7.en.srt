(Criminal Minds Korea)

9
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:43,920
Since 2015, there were
these three murder cases...

10
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,820
that took place in Seoul
and Gyeonggi Province.

11
00:00:46,049 --> 00:00:48,219
- These three unsolved murders...
- Excuse me.

12
00:00:48,219 --> 00:00:49,549
have something in common.

13
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:53,119
Their bodies were all found
by their parents.

14
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:55,729
But this time, he sent a video
instead of a body.

15
00:00:55,729 --> 00:00:57,799
He's pursuing pleasure.

16
00:00:57,799 --> 00:01:00,469
It will be worse for parents to
face their children suffer...

17
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:03,570
than to see their dead bodies.

18
00:01:03,969 --> 00:01:06,569
The location of abandonment doesn't
have anything to do with her father.

19
00:01:06,939 --> 00:01:09,709
The name written on the CD
was Eun Jung's mother.

20
00:01:09,709 --> 00:01:13,280
The criminal's target...

21
00:01:13,549 --> 00:01:15,549
was not the family
but their mothers.

22
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:17,849
The S tattooed on his wrist...

23
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,420
referred to S Cult.

24
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:22,849
Kang Jae Deok.
He runs the website S Cult.

25
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:24,920
- I'm not going to prison.
- Kang Jae Deok!

26
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,329
They made a fake sadistic video...

27
00:01:27,329 --> 00:01:29,430
on a secretly operated
internet show.

28
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,200
Who are you?

29
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,959
Do you know anyone in here?

30
00:01:33,769 --> 00:01:34,769
This man.

31
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:37,569
We're here to see Yoon Jeong Sub.

32
00:01:39,069 --> 00:01:41,409
He's usually nice and good to me.

33
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:44,239
I didn't want to betray him.

34
00:01:45,379 --> 00:01:47,310
He's the man I love.

35
00:01:47,609 --> 00:01:48,709
Let's...

36
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:52,420
save ourselves from back then.

37
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:56,090
She isn't frightened at all.

38
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:58,790
She saw pictures of victims
brutally murdered,

39
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:01,359
but she is shockingly calm.

40
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:03,799
What?

41
00:02:16,939 --> 00:02:19,280
(Episode 7)

42
00:03:07,689 --> 00:03:11,659
Was Song Yoo Kyung really the one
who tortured and killed the victims?

43
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:14,770
Was it really her?

44
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,870
I understand how you feel.
But our priority...

45
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:18,939
is saving Kwon Yoo Jin.

46
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,789
There's something
I just can't understand.

47
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:43,189
Why did Song Yoo Kyung come back,
knowing she was being chased...

48
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:44,229
by the police?

49
00:03:44,229 --> 00:03:45,699
Because of her faith...

50
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:48,370
that she could control
Yoon Jeong Sub.

51
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,400
I'm sure what she wanted
to avoid most...

52
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,810
was our finding him
before finding her.

53
00:03:53,969 --> 00:03:54,969
Because...

54
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:58,939
that would mean she could not
completely control him anymore.

55
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,409
(Kang Ki Hyung)

56
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:06,150
She thought she could control him
as long as she was with him.

57
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,120
Now that's confidence.

58
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,590
Look into Song Yoo Kyung for me.

59
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:10,659
Yes, sir.

60
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,659
Yoon Jeong Sub thinks
he's in full control,

61
00:04:14,659 --> 00:04:17,560
and that he and Song Yoo Kyung
are equal.

62
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:21,230
But in reality,
he is being dominated.

63
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:23,000
Based on the video,

64
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,139
he feared Song Yoo Kyung.

65
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:29,269
I'm sure he didn't want to admit
to who he was behind the mask.

66
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:33,180
That's why he thinks
he's protecting Song Yoo Kyung.

67
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,850
On the flipside,

68
00:04:34,949 --> 00:04:37,980
I'm sure the feeling
that he's being used by her...

69
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,879
is creeping into him
and making him nervous.

70
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:41,949
We have to use that,

71
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,689
if we want to find Kwon Yoo Jin.

72
00:04:44,689 --> 00:04:46,160
- Let's begin.
- Yes, sir.

73
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,759
Song Yoo Kyung.

74
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,870
What happened?

75
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:55,069
I was nervous,

76
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:58,199
so I went to him.

77
00:04:58,199 --> 00:04:59,899
Were you assaulted?

78
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:02,910
I don't know why he did it.

79
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:06,379
Don't keep anything from me.
Tell me everything.

80
00:05:06,779 --> 00:05:07,910
The truth is,

81
00:05:09,449 --> 00:05:11,279
I can't drink.

82
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:14,050
He's usually kind and nice.

83
00:05:14,449 --> 00:05:15,550
But...

84
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,889
once he drinks...

85
00:05:18,459 --> 00:05:20,160
He's breaking.

86
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,860
He's afraid.

87
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:23,189
Good.

88
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:26,000
Let's tell him we know
she's the killer,

89
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
- and begin questioning him.
- No.

90
00:05:29,069 --> 00:05:31,069
He knows what we're after.

91
00:05:31,069 --> 00:05:32,769
I'm sorry for lying.

92
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:35,610
I didn't know what to say.
I was afraid.

93
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,910
He's the man I love.

94
00:05:39,709 --> 00:05:41,480
He looks at peace again.

95
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:45,050
It looks like he's smiling
at the camera.

96
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:48,790
We need something to cut
the tie between them.

97
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,089
There is a way.

98
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:54,860
Do we have all the video files
we got from S Cult's server?

99
00:05:55,029 --> 00:05:56,930
Do you mean the Internet program
videos?

100
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:59,800
Yes. We can make fake evidence
with them.

101
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,800
Evidence?

102
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:03,970
Evidence that Song Yoo Kyung planted
in advance...

103
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:05,540
to make Yoon Jeong Sub
look like killer.

104
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,170
And we found it.

105
00:06:11,779 --> 00:06:13,279
I think I can understand...

106
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:15,879
why Song Yoo Kyung did this.

107
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:18,250
A doctor who treated Song Yoo Kyung
when she was 15...

108
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:21,550
found she was sexually assaulted
and abused, and called the police.

109
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:29,129
Help me.

110
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,240
Please call the police.

111
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,639
The police named her step-father
as the prime suspect.

112
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:43,170
Something isn't right.

113
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:47,680
If her trauma began with
her step-father's sexual assault,

114
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:51,449
why does she want to hurt
the victims' moms?

115
00:06:51,449 --> 00:06:52,850
How did the case end?

116
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:53,920
Not guilty.

117
00:06:54,389 --> 00:06:56,750
Song Yoo Kyung retracted
her statement.

118
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,319
She said nothing happened.

119
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:00,629
The truth must be
hidden in there somewhere.

120
00:07:00,689 --> 00:07:04,100
The record shows her mom
went to the police station.

121
00:07:05,129 --> 00:07:06,160
What if...

122
00:07:06,829 --> 00:07:09,670
her mom stopped her from testifying?

123
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:12,000
It's common for minors...

124
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,269
to make false testimonies because
they're afraid or threatened.

125
00:07:15,509 --> 00:07:18,740
Even with the child who died
recently from domestic violence,

126
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:21,279
the child told the police
that nothing happened,

127
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:22,649
so they stopped investigating.

128
00:07:22,649 --> 00:07:24,620
Then the incident
happened afterward.

129
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,790
The wounds are evident,

130
00:07:30,889 --> 00:07:33,759
and her medical record confirms
she had sexual intercourse.

131
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:38,459
Yoo Kyung. Tell them the truth.

132
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,259
Did your dad really do that?

133
00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:42,129
Yes, tell us the truth.

134
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:44,240
You don't have to be afraid.
Don't worry.

135
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:46,240
Well...

136
00:07:47,569 --> 00:07:48,569
Well...

137
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:52,110
It was that boy, wasn't it?

138
00:07:55,449 --> 00:07:58,750
- Mom.
- I said not to hang out with him.

139
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,850
Why did you do it? Why?

140
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:03,389
Still...

141
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,029
The truth is...

142
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:11,430
Mom...

143
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,170
What my mom said is true.

144
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:17,199
I...

145
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,470
I lied.

146
00:08:22,939 --> 00:08:24,480
During the worst moment of her life,

147
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:29,310
her mom, whom she trusted most,
didn't protect her.

148
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:36,820
The memories of that day
probably started all of this.

149
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,559
We have no time to lose.

150
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,360
What happened?

151
00:08:42,029 --> 00:08:44,399
Okay. I'll go in first,

152
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,899
so give me a sign when you're ready.

153
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,710
You don't need to lie in order
to protect Song Yoo Kyung anymore.

154
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:02,879
We've already found evidence...

155
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:04,379
that she's the real killer.

156
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,649
Don't lie to me.

157
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:09,250
I won't fall for it.

158
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:13,519
We know why you said,
"five people" to her.

159
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,629
Get it together, Yoo Kyung!

160
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:19,029
Those jerks are trying to frame us
for murder.

161
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:21,899
Five people.

162
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:24,669
Five people.

163
00:09:24,669 --> 00:09:26,740
Because the number of people
you and she killed...

164
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,909
was three, not five.

165
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:32,480
No!

166
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:36,779
The DNA found on the body...

167
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:39,720
of the first two victims,
Yoo Hye Jin and Choi Eun Seo...

168
00:09:41,889 --> 00:09:43,590
was confirmed to be
from Kang Jae Deok.

169
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,360
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

170
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,159
Once the fearful Kang Jae Deok...

171
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:50,830
refused to kill any more people,

172
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:54,700
Song Yoo Kyung approached you,
his friend,

173
00:09:54,929 --> 00:09:57,269
and continued with you
from the third murder.

174
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:07,750
Kang Jae Deok
was a fearful person.

175
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,850
Enough to choose death over prison.

176
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:14,250
Based on his profiling,
he couldn't keep souvenirs...

177
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:16,120
to relive the moments
he murdered the victims.

178
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,860
Thus, he did not put the nail...

179
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:21,289
in the pad himself.

180
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:25,399
Song Yoo Kyung had planned to tie
you and Kang Jae Deok together...

181
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:27,230
as accomplices and
get out of it scot-free.

182
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:29,629
Drop the lies. Where's Yoo Kyung?

183
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:31,539
He's starting to react.

184
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,970
It's ready. Let's begin.

185
00:10:35,409 --> 00:10:36,470
Here.

186
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,509
Song Yoo Kyung.

187
00:10:40,809 --> 00:10:42,250
Song Yoo Kyung is...

188
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:48,549
How did it go?

189
00:10:48,789 --> 00:10:49,850
Where is it?

190
00:10:54,789 --> 00:10:56,059
Did you check the content?

191
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:58,460
Okay.

192
00:11:01,669 --> 00:11:02,929
Tell me!

193
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:09,909
What did you do to Yoo Kyung?
Where is she?

194
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:22,519
Tell me!

195
00:11:25,259 --> 00:11:26,990
What did you do to Yoo Kyung?

196
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:29,730
Don't you dare touch her.
I won't forgive you.

197
00:11:30,059 --> 00:11:31,230
I'll kill you all.

198
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:34,529
I'll rip you to shreds
and kill you all.

199
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,190
Please...

200
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,370
We found this in your home.
When did you film this?

201
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:17,340
What are you up to?

202
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,179
We were right.

203
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:22,149
You're not the one
in the mask, are you?

204
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:26,379
Song Yoo Kyung planted it
in case of a situation like this.

205
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:30,220
According to her plan,
you and Kang Jae Deok...

206
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:32,720
killed all five of the women.

207
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:35,690
I'm sure she needed evidence
to prove that.

208
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:41,429
You're not special at all
to Song Yoo Kyung.

209
00:12:43,299 --> 00:12:46,340
To her, men are just tools.

210
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:50,409
You were used like Kang Jae Deok.
You were expendable.

211
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:51,840
Shut it!

212
00:12:52,539 --> 00:12:54,080
She is insisting...

213
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:57,049
that you threatened her and made her
partake in the crimes.

214
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:59,549
Once she feels
she can't get out of it,

215
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,250
she'll change her attitude
and help with the investigation.

216
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:04,720
Choose.

217
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:07,419
It's your last chance.

218
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:11,159
Wait.

219
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,029
Wait.

220
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:17,639
Did Yoo Kyung really say that?

221
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,870
That I threatened her,
and she had no choice?

222
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:39,960
Min Young, there's only one road
that leads to the reservoir,

223
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,460
so wait by the entrance of the road.

224
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,529
Got it.

225
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:17,230
Please!

226
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:19,559
Please, don't do this!

227
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:24,399
Please...
Please just kill me instead.

228
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,570
Please just kill me!

229
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:29,440
Come on. Why would I kill you?

230
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:40,549
Okay.

231
00:14:41,549 --> 00:14:42,549
Then...

232
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:45,120
I'll just finish you.

233
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:25,360
This is the place.

234
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:31,070
Kwon Yoo Jin was being held here
until recently.

235
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:49,049
It's Song Yoo Kyung.

236
00:15:56,429 --> 00:15:57,490
Hang on tight.

237
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,539
Careful.

238
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:31,759
Song Yoo Kyung. Calm down.

239
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:39,399
Let her go.

240
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:42,039
Put the knife down.

241
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:47,240
What's wrong with killing
a harlot like her?

242
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:49,509
I did nothing wrong.

243
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:53,149
I know. Please stop here.

244
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:57,519
You've suffered too much
to give up on the rest of your life.

245
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,730
If you stop here,
it'll be better than it is now.

246
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:05,630
What do you know?

247
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,569
Do you know how I've lived?

248
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:11,869
How painful my life has been?

249
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:26,519
Song Yoo Kyung.

250
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:29,789
I'm going to shoot.

251
00:17:36,529 --> 00:17:37,630
Let go!

252
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:40,099
I'm going to kill her!

253
00:17:40,299 --> 00:17:41,970
I'm going to kill them all!

254
00:17:53,309 --> 00:17:57,009
Let's save ourselves from back then.

255
00:17:57,349 --> 00:17:58,549
With our own strength.

256
00:18:02,619 --> 00:18:04,490
Kwon Yoo Jin!

257
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:08,589
You can never live the life
you used to.

258
00:18:10,029 --> 00:18:11,829
Just like me, you...

259
00:18:13,529 --> 00:18:16,700
You will suffer in agony
for the rest of your life.

260
00:18:23,309 --> 00:18:25,539
- They're here.
- Move aside.

261
00:18:25,539 --> 00:18:27,140
(Court)

262
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,759
Bring Eun Jung back to life.

263
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:44,599
Bring Eun Jung back to life now.

264
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:46,559
Eun Jung. Bring Eun Jung back.

265
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,569
- Why did you kill those women?
- Please explain.

266
00:18:48,569 --> 00:18:50,369
- Please say something.
- Why did you do that?

267
00:18:50,369 --> 00:18:51,470
Yoo Kyung.

268
00:18:56,839 --> 00:18:57,980
I'm sorry.

269
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,150
It's all my fault. Yoo Kyung.

270
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:39,349
Bring my daughter back. My daughter.

271
00:19:39,349 --> 00:19:42,289
- Die. Are you even a human?
- How could you do such thing?

272
00:19:42,289 --> 00:19:44,319
Bring my daughter back.

273
00:19:46,289 --> 00:19:50,230
If there was anyone who helped
Yoo Kyung to be brave,

274
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:52,500
this wouldn't have happened, right?

275
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,529
Are you blaming this
on the people around her?

276
00:19:56,869 --> 00:19:57,869
What?

277
00:19:58,299 --> 00:19:59,740
That's not how I see it.

278
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,970
Not everyone does such a thing...

279
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:04,039
because they were abused
when they were young.

280
00:20:04,579 --> 00:20:06,480
If you think of
the victims' families,

281
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:11,109
what she has done to them...

282
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,980
cannot be forgiven.

283
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:18,220
"Those who commit evil deeds..."

284
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:21,589
hurt others, but they hurt
themselves the most."

285
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:23,359
Socrates.

286
00:20:31,069 --> 00:20:34,299
Team Manager Kang. Here's the
briefing on Song Yoo Kyung case.

287
00:20:35,109 --> 00:20:36,369
Thank you.

288
00:20:37,109 --> 00:20:38,339
How's your wound?

289
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,079
This is nothing. I'm fine.

290
00:20:41,579 --> 00:20:43,450
It was a good profiling.

291
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:44,680
I still have a long way to go.

292
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:48,750
It just came to me because
it was in the book you gave me.

293
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:49,750
No.

294
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:52,660
If it wasn't for
your judgment and bravery,

295
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:54,519
Kwon Yoo Jin would've been killed.

296
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:56,390
You saved the victim.

297
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:01,700
That makes me want to study harder.

298
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:05,670
I'll be a great profiler
just like you.

299
00:21:18,619 --> 00:21:21,279
(Personal Information,
Kim Yong Chul)

300
00:21:23,019 --> 00:21:24,890
(List of Evidence)

301
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:35,799
I'm on the way.
Please send me the backup.

302
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:38,970
As I had asked, I need you
to keep this a secret.

303
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:42,710
Two months after Go Young Min
was accused of assaulting a minor,

304
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:45,509
he is cleared of the charges,

305
00:21:45,509 --> 00:21:47,180
and leaving the prosecutor's office.

306
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:51,680
While advocacy groups continue
to argue for his imprisonment,

307
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,849
his lawyer, Ha Yoon Man,
of Ha and Jang...

308
00:21:54,849 --> 00:21:56,690
says he is not guilty.

309
00:22:26,849 --> 00:22:28,690
Don't. Don't come near me.

310
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:32,259
Let me go, right now!

311
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:10,890
Here the question.

312
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,700
It's about
a female college student...

313
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:15,829
murder case happened in Chungbuk,
Yo-dong on March 20, 2001.

314
00:23:16,069 --> 00:23:18,970
It had no trace of blood,
evidence or witness.

315
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,500
There was no sign of sexual assault.

316
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,809
It's not like the criminal was after
valuables.

317
00:23:23,069 --> 00:23:26,539
Here, the criminal took something
very unusual.

318
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:29,250
What did the criminal take...

319
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:31,549
in this extended cold case?

320
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:33,819
A chopped hand.

321
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:39,759
What's wrong with you, Hyun Jun?
You're not realistic.

322
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:41,960
You're just so perfect.

323
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:44,759
Move on. Move on.

324
00:23:45,099 --> 00:23:47,160
It's about one of the most famous
cold cases.

325
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,329
It's a question on Cheonju-si
Nadeul River case.

326
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:52,869
Among 136 suspects for the case,

327
00:23:52,869 --> 00:23:56,069
one suspect was most suspicious.

328
00:23:56,069 --> 00:23:58,680
Here's the hint.

329
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:01,509
The biggest topic

I was one of the suspects.

00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:41,519
Was it you...

338
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:43,589
14 years ago?

339
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:45,690
I told you before.

340
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:48,089
I...

341
00:24:48,829 --> 00:24:50,559
I didn't do it.

342
00:24:51,259 --> 00:24:53,529
He asked me...

343
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:56,029
the same question.

344

There was a report that stated that
Go Young Min...

354
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:51,960
secretly ran a punishment site
through a borrowed name...

and that he spread videos of
minors getting punished...

Is it true that you didn't know
anything about Go's crimes?

for assaulting a minor

investigating him.

402

However, when the Prosecution's

is not available at this moment.

He was stabbed in exactly at
the pressure point.

413
00:29:29,569 --> 00:29:31,140
The knife narrowly missed
the bone...

414
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:33,579
and went deep into the organ.

415

But what's really strange is this.
Take a look.

416
00:29:38,279 --> 00:29:41,549
It looks like someone pierced
his ears forcefully.

The deceased victim, Han So Min,
didn't have her ears pierced.

know about this?

It was a case from

A person I know was at the scene.

434
00:30:36,609 --> 00:30:39,440
He was really surprised...

435
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,440
because an NCI agent was there.

it was already over.

was already dead.

was screaming like crazy...

while holding onto
the dead body of Go Young Min.

He thought she might have had
a personal grudge against him.

this must be serious.

He will never give up.

who was a sex offender,

498
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,659
was murdered mysteriously.

499
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:58,099
Many problems have been
brought up regarding the case.

500
00:34:58,530 --> 00:34:59,739
- Sun Woo.
- The essential problem...

501
00:34:59,739 --> 00:35:01,969
with the current
industrial system...

502
00:35:01,969 --> 00:35:03,940
have been brought up
as the main issue.

503
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:05,980
Who do you think the culprit is?

504
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:11,280
There seem to be
a lot of problems with that case.

505
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:14,849
If the victim's family had killed...

506
00:35:14,849 --> 00:35:16,320
Go Young Min,

507
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:19,619
why would they have gone through
such a dangerous and had process?

508
00:35:20,659 --> 00:35:21,789
Don't you think so too?

509
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:24,289
Do you think that a victim
who has lost someone...

510
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:26,800
could have killed someone...

511
00:35:27,159 --> 00:35:29,230
while letting Han So Min
die as well?

512
00:35:29,429 --> 00:35:32,840
In such cases, it is highly possible
that the culprit...

513
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,940
is someone you'd never
even think of.

Keep your eyes on the target

And make an isosceles triangle

Were you going to keep it a secret?

660
00:50:51,690 --> 00:50:53,420
Are you out of your mind?

661
00:50:54,519 --> 00:50:56,860
Why do you think he was after
Go Young Min?

662
00:51:00,230 --> 00:51:01,400
I think...

663
00:51:02,599 --> 00:51:04,400
he's not only after
Team Manager Kang...

664
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:06,800
but the whole team.

665
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:09,440
Destroying the team...

666
00:51:11,010 --> 00:51:13,840
will make Team Manager Kang
suffer more.

667
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:34,599
You...

668
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:39,300
should tell Team Manager Kang
before it's too late.

669
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,800
We need to be more careful.

670
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,510
Is that the only reason?

671
00:51:44,869 --> 00:51:46,510
As time goes on...

672
00:51:47,239 --> 00:51:48,940
I will tell him later.

673
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:55,019
All right. Let's talk later.

674
00:52:01,159 --> 00:52:04,489
Rumors surrounding
the shooting incident on the road...

675
00:52:04,489 --> 00:52:06,900
are being spread fast
on the Internet,

676
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:09,969
and the people are in more fear
than ever.

677
00:52:10,269 --> 00:52:12,230
Although a shooting incident...

678
00:52:12,230 --> 00:52:15,440
has happened in the middle
of the road in the daytime,

679
00:52:15,639 --> 00:52:19,210
the police has not been able to
identify the culprit...

680
00:52:32,219 --> 00:52:34,360
What is that crazy person doing?

681
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:44,000
What are you doing?

682
00:52:48,269 --> 00:52:50,239
Hey, are you out of your mind?

683
00:53:06,489 --> 00:53:07,619
(23 Ju 1633)

684
00:53:18,670 --> 00:53:20,570
These are photos of the victim...

685
00:53:20,570 --> 00:53:22,969
who has been shot on the 29th
at 3:00am near Yangchon-dong,

686
00:53:22,969 --> 00:53:24,840
at the access way of the ring road.

687
00:53:25,170 --> 00:53:27,340
The victim died on the spot.

688
00:53:30,210 --> 00:53:32,210
This shooting incident
happened one week after...

689
00:53:32,210 --> 00:53:34,679
the first case,
which happened on the 21st.

690
00:53:35,150 --> 00:53:38,449
Fortunately, the first victim
has survived,

691
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:40,760
but she hasn't gained
consciousness yet.

692
00:53:41,019 --> 00:53:43,690
We're not in the US
or Mexico, right?

693
00:53:44,090 --> 00:53:46,730
Actually, shooting incidents
in Korea...

694
00:53:46,730 --> 00:53:48,800
have been increasing every year.

695
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:52,829
Last October, a police officer
was shot...

696
00:53:52,829 --> 00:53:56,099
by an individual at
the Mount Opae Tunnel.

697
00:53:56,239 --> 00:53:58,170
They found 17 handmade guns...

698
00:53:58,170 --> 00:53:59,610
and explosives at his house.

699
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:03,349
How about black box footages
or witnesses?

700
00:54:03,349 --> 00:54:04,809
The first incident...

701
00:54:04,809 --> 00:54:06,880
happened at
a road construction section,

702
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:10,349
so there were no CCTVs
that were actually working.

703
00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:13,320
And it's hard to find a witness...

704
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:14,920
as there were only a few cars.

705
00:54:15,090 --> 00:54:18,389
The second incident happened at a
national highway with only few cars,

706
00:54:18,389 --> 00:54:21,400
and it happened at dawn,
making it hard to track.

707
00:54:21,659 --> 00:54:24,570
I'm looking at a black box footage
sent from the police station.

708
00:54:25,030 --> 00:54:28,599
The black sedan that belongs
to the culprit...

709
00:54:29,199 --> 00:54:31,170
looks blurry on every footage.

710
00:54:31,570 --> 00:54:33,639
How are the two victims related?

711
00:54:33,940 --> 00:54:37,349
There is no relationship except
that they are women in their 40's.

712
00:54:37,349 --> 00:54:39,880
If there is no relationship
between the two,

713
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:42,179
it could be a random hate crime.

714
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:44,219
Wait.

715
00:54:46,659 --> 00:54:48,789
Let's compare the victims' pictures.

716
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,969
They look similar,
but in fact, they are different.

717
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:00,070
If you look closely,

718
00:55:00,699 --> 00:55:03,000
the second victim's wound...

719
00:55:03,139 --> 00:55:04,610
looks larger.

720
00:55:04,610 --> 00:55:07,340
Do you mean there are two culprits?

721
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:09,210
It could be a copycat crime.

722
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:14,420
No, there is only one culprit.
He cut the muzzle of the gun.

723
00:55:15,019 --> 00:55:16,989
Gunpowder was mostly found...

724
00:55:17,250 --> 00:55:19,349
on the left cheek of both victims.

725
00:55:19,619 --> 00:55:21,090
They were shot with...

726
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:23,219
a long-necked rifle through
the window of the passenger seat.

727
00:55:37,469 --> 00:55:39,469
He learned from the experience...

728
00:55:39,969 --> 00:55:42,679
what he has to do if he wants to
shoot easily.

729
00:55:43,309 --> 00:55:44,380
Are you crazy?

730
00:55:45,610 --> 00:55:46,650
He's...

731
00:55:47,349 --> 00:55:49,449
picking up what it's like to murder.

732
00:55:51,219 --> 00:55:53,820
That's why we must take charge
of this case.

733
00:55:54,860 --> 00:55:57,590
The first round of investigations
were conducted on...

734
00:55:57,590 --> 00:56:00,099
people who have easy access to guns
like veterans and military people.

735
00:56:00,099 --> 00:56:01,829
However, it was reported to be
unsuccessful.

736
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,500
It won't be easy to chase him.

737
00:56:04,670 --> 00:56:08,239
If you want, you can just watch
the video on a private gun...

738
00:56:08,239 --> 00:56:09,739
manufacture website
to make one yourself.

739
00:56:11,539 --> 00:56:14,940
Then you're saying the criminal
made a shotgun himself?

740
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:17,909
There's no regulations
on illegal private guns...

741
00:56:17,909 --> 00:56:19,349
which makes it hard to locate him.

742
00:56:19,949 --> 00:56:21,219
It's a possible scenario.

743
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:30,190
If the car is this bad,
the driver must be...

744
00:56:30,329 --> 00:56:32,030
I think it really was a private gun.

745
00:56:32,690 --> 00:56:35,929
The bullet holes are all
different sizes.

746
00:56:38,670 --> 00:56:41,840
It means the force on the bullet
is not consistent.

747
00:57:47,170 --> 00:57:50,369
There's another shooting incident
on number 11 highway.

748
00:57:50,369 --> 00:57:52,210
This kind of murder is like drug.

749
00:57:52,210 --> 00:57:54,179
He'll look for the next target soon.

750
00:57:54,179 --> 00:57:56,440
- Captain. Please wait for a bit.
- Get out!

751
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:58,480
The criminal's losing
his sense of reality.

752
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:00,719
The world he sees has changed,

753
00:58:00,719 --> 00:58:02,250
and his role has changed.

754
00:58:02,250 --> 00:58:04,550
What's the rage in his heart?

755
00:58:04,550 --> 00:58:06,550
He'll be out of control.

756
00:58:06,550 --> 00:58:08,659
Only if we were any faster.

757
00:58:08,659 --> 00:58:10,559
Don't make any hasty conclusions.

758
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:12,489
Nothing's more important than
saving people.

759
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:15,829
We'll reveal the suspect profiling
to the public for report calls.

760
00:58:15,829 --> 00:58:17,130
Have you got the outline
of the criminal?

761
00:58:17,130 --> 00:58:18,929
Please tell us about
the current situation.

762
00:58:18,929 --> 00:58:21,969
You know the criminal will commit
a crime again.

763
00:58:24,739 --> 00:58:27,139
Hurry up. I need to start
profiling now.
