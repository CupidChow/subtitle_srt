10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,829
- It's dangerous.
- What is?

11
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:04,599
I've gained weight. I'm heavy.

12
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:05,670
You're not.

13
00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:09,109
What?

14
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:12,209
Why did the power go out suddenly?

15
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,480
I'll go check the fuse box.

16
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,109
Watch out when you go down
the stairs.

17
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:17,120
Okay.

18
00:01:34,099 --> 00:01:35,170
What was that?

19
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,680
Honey.

20
00:01:55,489 --> 00:01:57,920
Chungmyung Police station
requested cooperation...

21
00:01:58,219 --> 00:01:59,590
related to a serial sex offender.

22
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:02,760
6 months ago, 4 university
students were raped...

23
00:02:02,829 --> 00:02:05,430
in Christian university
located in Chungmyung.

24
00:02:05,629 --> 00:02:08,300
4 female students were raped
once every 10 days.

25
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:11,439
It stopped for six months,

26
00:02:11,569 --> 00:02:14,139
then it began with completely
different targets 15 days ago.

27
00:02:16,409 --> 00:02:19,110
The second victim, Jung Jin Hee, 37.

28
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,180
She was raped 15 days ago.

29
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:24,819
She's currently in Bookyung
where her parents live.

30
00:02:26,349 --> 00:02:27,520
There was an additional rape...

31
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,360
a week ago in a house
in Palbongro, Chungmyung.

32
00:02:31,689 --> 00:02:33,759
Her name's Choi Yu Rim, 34.

33
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:36,490
Her boyfriend, Kim Jae Seok,
was with her at the time,

34
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:39,229
and the culprit smashed
the back of his head.

35
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:43,639
Compared to the previous victims,

36
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,740
the current victims are
in their mid 30s.

37
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:50,139
There's no correlation
between the victims.

38
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:52,539
How do you know
it's done by a same person?

39
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:55,650
The culprit left a same voice
message to the victims.

40
00:02:58,419 --> 00:03:03,090
I can give you everything you want.

41
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:05,919
We were lucky to restore
one of the victims'...

42
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:07,590
broken cell phone.

43
00:03:07,789 --> 00:03:10,960
I can narrow down the age
by analyzing the voice.

44
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:14,669
The culprit's exposing himself
through the message...

45
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,830
as if he's showing off.

46
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:19,340
He's not trying to hide himself
at all.

47
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:21,009
Upon hearing the message,

48
00:03:21,009 --> 00:03:23,979
it sounds like the culprit knows
the victims well.

49
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:27,180
Was it possible to assume suspects
in the initial investigation?

50
00:03:27,449 --> 00:03:28,650
No. Not yet.

51
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:31,020
The message's distinctive,
but what's more unique is that...

52
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,550
starting with Choi Yu Rim
a week ago,

53
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:35,919
the culprit left a witness
on purpose.

54
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:38,319
Did the boyfriend witness
the scene of crime?

55
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,189
Yes. The boyfriend was there,

56
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,330
and he lost his consciousness.

57
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:45,629
If there are several victims,

58
00:03:45,729 --> 00:03:48,099
they could outline
the culprit's features.

59
00:03:48,129 --> 00:03:51,400
The thing is, the culprit raped
the victims so cruelly...

60
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,139
that they can't remember it.

61
00:03:53,669 --> 00:03:56,710
Even their testimony is ambiguous.

62
00:03:58,139 --> 00:04:00,849
They said he breathed heavily,
had sharp appearance,

63
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,780
and he wore a cap.

64
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,919
Any connections with ex-convicts?

65
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:08,819
Police secured the culprit's hair
from the scene of crime...

66
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:11,159
and went through a DNA test,

67
00:04:11,689 --> 00:04:13,319
but couldn't find any match.

68
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,689
First victims were
religious university students.

69
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,529
He had six months...

70
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:23,029
until he raped Jung Jin Hee
and Choi Yu Rim.

71
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,639
He selected completely different
crime targets.

72
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:31,639
It's important to figure out
why the culprit changed his targets.

73
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,180
We need to find out
what the six months' time means...

74
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:37,750
to the culprit
while he stopped the rape.

75
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,019
How's Choi Yu Rim's condition?

76
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,120
She's in hospital.

77
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:47,230
Sun Woo and Min Young can go talk
to the victims in hospital,

78
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:50,500
and Nana can join us
at the police station.

79
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:53,600
What? Me too?

80
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,230
You begin the interrogation.

81
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:07,350
When we look at
the first victims' houses,

82
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:09,850
they either lived in a studio
or a rooftop house.

83
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:13,579
Their neighbors could hear
their scream.

84
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:15,189
Why didn't they hear anything?

85
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:18,459
There's no trace of break-in
at the victims' houses.

86
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:22,029
No one knew until the victims
reported.

87
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:24,860
How did he get inside the house?

88
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,829
The culprit's committing crimes...

89
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:30,199
using his own pattern.

90
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,870
He made the victims to open
the door for him...

91
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:35,170
as if he was invited.

92
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:39,110
He might have a record of burglary.

93
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,149
No. I don't think so.

94
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:43,550
If he was going for an empty house,

95
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:46,120
he wouldn't harass the victims
this much.

96
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:52,360
The culprit raped the victims
multiple times in the same place.

97
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,660
Multiple times?

98
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:00,800
It turns out Palbongro area
where Choi lives...

99
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,899
had a power outage for two hours
on the day of the crime.

100
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,170
The culprit was aiming
for the moment...

101
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:10,009
when the victim's scared
in the dark.

102
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:14,680
The culprit wanted to see
the victims scared in the dark.

103
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:16,910
The victims testified that...

104
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:20,949
before they were raped,
they heard a loud noise outside.

105
00:06:21,189 --> 00:06:23,220
He was trying to distract them.

106
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,720
That's when he got into the house.

107
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:36,199
- I'm Team Manager Hong Sang Mi.
- I'm Kang Ki Hyung.

108
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:37,699
I'm in charge of this case.

109
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:41,610
As you know, my sexual crimes team
is simple.

110
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,439
It's cost-effective.

111
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,879
You requested us as soon as
you got the report.

112
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:49,310
Yes.

113
00:06:49,779 --> 00:06:53,680
I thought I should find out
the reason he changed the targets...

114
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,050
through profiling
to narrow down the suspect.

115
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,019
I heard you were Agent Ha's
senior...

116
00:06:59,089 --> 00:07:00,459
when she just became
a police officer.

117
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:05,230
Yes. We drank so much every time
the culprits we caught...

118
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:06,899
were released.

119
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,199
I can't imagine Sun Woo doing so.

120
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:15,240
You'll have to talk through
with the victims.

121
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:18,279
You'll find female agents
more helpful.

122
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:22,310
If you need my help,
I'm more than willing to help you.

123
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:23,850
- Sure.
- Okay.

124
00:07:26,649 --> 00:07:28,649
(Emergency Center)

125
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,629
Why did they tie her arms up?

126
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:39,029
I heard she attempted suicide
multiple times.

127
00:07:43,939 --> 00:07:45,040
Choi Yu Rim?

128
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:49,610
We're...

129
00:07:50,939 --> 00:07:52,579
from NCI.

130
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,980
Do you remember anything new...

131
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,879
that happened
on the day of the crime?

132
00:08:03,819 --> 00:08:05,019
I know it's hard,

133
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,730
but try to recall the memory please.

134
00:08:12,129 --> 00:08:14,199
Do you remember the culprit's face?

135
00:08:20,769 --> 00:08:22,040
When I close my eyes,

136
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,480
I can see his face.

137
00:08:26,209 --> 00:08:29,810
I can't even open my eyes anymore.

138
00:08:35,019 --> 00:08:36,320
Please.

139
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:38,559
Please...

140
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,490
How long do I have to...

141
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:41,659
It's all right.

142
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:44,529
Let's stop here.

143
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,929
We'll come back later.

144
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:57,379
Analysis of his voice...

145
00:08:57,409 --> 00:08:58,409
shows that...

146
00:08:58,409 --> 00:09:01,379
the culprit was a male
in his mid to late 30s.

147
00:09:02,179 --> 00:09:04,480
He would have been someone...

148
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,679
who could watch the victims all day.

149
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:08,389
We investigated and interrogated...

150
00:09:08,389 --> 00:09:10,620
people around the victims
for the last year,

151
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,919
but we could not find anyone
who was suspicious.

152
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,659
The culprit would have no personal
relationship with the victims,

153
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,799
but he would have talked
to the victims at least once.

154
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:23,429
He would be nice looking
and good at conversations.

155
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:25,370
The victims probably don't remember
the culprit...

156
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:28,070
because they didn't feel hostility
towards him.

157
00:09:28,409 --> 00:09:30,779
It would be possible if he was
someone that everyone can meet.

158
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:33,080
He could be a real estate agent,

159
00:09:33,309 --> 00:09:35,549
service technician,
internet installation engineer...

160
00:09:35,549 --> 00:09:37,009
I'm sorry to interrupt,

161
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:39,480
but we have interrogated
every one of those people.

162
00:09:40,049 --> 00:09:42,750
No, you must have made
a mistake.

163
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:45,059
The victims were of different age,

164
00:09:45,059 --> 00:09:48,889
they had different jobs,
and they led different lives.

165
00:09:48,929 --> 00:09:51,529
Seeing as the culprit set them
as the target,

166
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,269
he must have lived
near the victims...

167
00:09:54,269 --> 00:09:57,600
or had jobs that had something
to do with the victims.

168
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:00,500
(Emergency Center)

169
00:10:02,139 --> 00:10:03,440
At least the weather is nice.

170
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,350
He would have watched...

171
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:15,419
the victims from where he worked.

172
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:19,220
He would have only committed the
crime when his fantasy could be met.

173
00:10:21,429 --> 00:10:23,330
This means...

174
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:25,000
that he has access to...

175
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,730
not only the victims
but to everyone.

176
00:10:27,769 --> 00:10:29,669
- Min Ah?
- That'd be me.

177
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:32,039
- Thank you.
- He could be a cable engineer,

178
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:34,009
a gasman, or a maintenance engineer
for water purifiers.

179
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,009
If you widen your thoughts
from there,

180
00:10:36,009 --> 00:10:39,580
He would work at a place where
women can easily talk to men.

181
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,980
He could work at a beauty parlor,
a cosmetics store,

182
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:44,320
a library, a post office,

183
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,350
a delivery service,
or a convenience store.

184
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:55,360
Did anyone suspicious come to you
after the incident?

185
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,529
I told you everything
six months ago.

186
00:10:57,529 --> 00:10:59,730
Can't you just check the records?

187
00:11:00,299 --> 00:11:01,370
Sun Young,

188
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:03,230
I know this is hard for you.

189
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:05,899
But the number of victims
is increasing.

190
00:11:12,009 --> 00:11:15,009
I'm sorry, but we need to know.

191
00:11:15,009 --> 00:11:16,850
I'd like to ask you again.

192
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,080
Was there anyone near you...

193
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,850
who kept circling you quietly?

194
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:23,350
Ms. Hong,

195
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:27,789
I'd like to talk to Sun Young alone.

196
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:34,830
I'm sorry.

197
00:11:35,429 --> 00:11:38,269
We should have been more
considerate.

198
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,009
I'm an information specialist
at NCI.

199
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:44,340
I'm not an expert at profiling.

200
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:49,809
There is no one in particular...

201
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,620
that I can think of.

202
00:11:57,019 --> 00:12:00,460
Is there anyone who suddenly
quit a club, a gathering,

203
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:01,990
or took time off from school?

204
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:06,000
It wasn't someone around me.

205
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:10,730
I know that much.

206
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:13,970
We think that the culprit...

207
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:17,009
has been stalking other victims.

208
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,710
Did the culprit...

209
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:21,950
try to talk to you about something?

210
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,779
I don't remember anything else,

211
00:12:24,549 --> 00:12:25,549
but...

212
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:28,649
he had said something
really scary to me.

213
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:33,559
Look at me.

214
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:36,529
Look at me.

215
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:39,299
Look.

216
00:12:40,129 --> 00:12:41,230
Look at me.

217
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,139
The police...

218
00:12:48,139 --> 00:12:50,370
told me that he hadn't killed me
or anything,

219
00:12:50,539 --> 00:12:53,379
so I should forget about it
as if it was a bad dream.

220
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:56,649
They said there were many people
who were killed in the end,

221
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:59,149
and that it was a relief.

222
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,389
But...

223
00:13:07,529 --> 00:13:09,360
is it really a relief?

224
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,809
Before committing the crime,
there's order.

225
00:13:26,809 --> 00:13:30,250
But during the process, he becomes
disorderly and violent.

226
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:31,980
That means...

227
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:34,720
he's angry when he commits
these crimes.

228
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,019
That's probably why he is violent.

229
00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:44,460
"I heard a sound
after the electricity went off."

230
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,700
"That's when the culprit came
inside through the open door."

231
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,340
It's not like other crime patterns.

232
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,240
Especially sexual assault crimes.

233
00:13:54,769 --> 00:13:56,809
Before committing the crime,

234
00:13:56,809 --> 00:13:58,480
he plans it inside his head,

235
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,909
and then he carries it out.

236
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,009
He must get excited
while he watches...

237
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:05,549
the victims panic in disorder...

238
00:14:05,549 --> 00:14:06,919
after he turns off the electricity.

239
00:14:09,419 --> 00:14:11,460
Please check if there were...

240
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,190
similar cases like this in the past.

241
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:16,929
I was actually searching for cases.

242
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:18,700
I'll conduct a nation-wide search...

243
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:21,129
on cases in which the culprit
stole from or broke into houses...

244
00:14:21,269 --> 00:14:23,600
while the electricity
was turned off.

245
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,600
All right.

246
00:14:25,269 --> 00:14:29,210
Are you guessing that the culprit
committed other crimes before this?

247
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:31,240
Seeing as he plans his crimes,

248
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:34,850
it's likely that he started with
burglary or breaking into houses.

249
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:37,720
If you look at the crime patterns,
he's very bold...

250
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,350
and confident.

251
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:41,820
During his second crime,
he didn't try to hide anything.

252
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:44,149
He even left a witness to his crime.

253
00:14:44,289 --> 00:14:46,019
He leaves messages and witnesses,

254
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:49,830
makes the victims look at his face
forcefully,

255
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,000
and vents his violent anger
towards the victims.

256
00:14:53,129 --> 00:14:54,600
What do they mean?

257
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:59,100
They could have something to do
an experience in the past.

258
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,840
And we need to find that story.

259
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:06,179
The fact that he has left a witness
could be a message in itself.

260
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:07,649
The culprit...

261
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:11,350
is asking someone
to keep an eye on him.

262
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,019
Whoever it is,

263
00:15:13,549 --> 00:15:16,049
it must be someone
from the culprit's past.

264
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:19,419
There must be more victims
that we don't know of yet.

265
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:23,860
Only 11 percent of rape victims
report to the police in Korea.

266
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,929
The victims from the first case
were all Christians.

267
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:28,730
It would have been harder
for them to report.

268
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:31,039
The culprit would have
taken that into account as well.

269
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:34,100
He would have chosen victims
who are unlikely to report.

270
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:39,210
Why do you think he stopped
for six months?

271
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:44,320
There must have been a reason why
he had changed his mind.

272
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:48,289
It would have something to do with
the reason he changed his targets.

273
00:15:49,789 --> 00:15:51,389
It's been a while
since you worked together,

274
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:53,019
and yet it looks very familiar.

275
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:56,590
I didn't know she started
her career here.

276
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:57,860
I didn't...

277
00:15:58,159 --> 00:16:02,269
know that she'd be so successful.

278
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,139
Is NCI going to be officially
leading the investigation?

279
00:16:09,309 --> 00:16:12,340
The culprit would be looking for
his next victim.

280
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,009
We must move before he does.

281
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:17,409
Was there anyone suspicious
around the victims?

282
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:19,220
I think I have something.

283
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,789
Six months ago, a female student
from Chungmyung University...

284
00:16:21,789 --> 00:16:23,549
committed suicide.

285
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:26,220
Did she report any sexual assaults?

286
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,830
No, she didn't.

287
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:30,289
She committed suicide
during the period...

288
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:33,200
in which the culprit had stopped
committing his crimes.

289
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:37,840
I don't know why...

290
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,370
So Hee has anything to do with
the incidents you are talking about.

291
00:16:41,539 --> 00:16:42,570
Have you...

292
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:46,440
heard about the suicide incident
in Chungmyung University?

293
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:48,279
Of course.

294
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:50,610
The story was all over the media.

295
00:16:51,149 --> 00:16:52,480
We think...

296
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:56,019
that So Hee has something
to do with the incident.

297
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:59,860
What are you trying to say?

298
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:02,330
That's not possible.

299
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:05,000
My daughter...

300
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,529
wasn't someone who would be
the target of such crimes.

301
00:17:07,529 --> 00:17:08,700
Honey.

302
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:14,710
Did So Hee leave a will?

303
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,980
I'm sorry,

304
00:17:19,609 --> 00:17:21,750
but may we take a look at it?

305
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:23,650
There was no such thing.

306
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,799
Team Manager Kang,
I searched...

307
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:41,700
for similar cases in the past
as you asked me.

308
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:44,099
There have been multiple cases...

309
00:17:44,099 --> 00:17:47,500
that show similar traits at the
cities on the outskirts of Seoul...

310
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:51,039
like Moohyun, Hajeong, Songro,
and Yuljeong since five years ago.

311
00:17:51,579 --> 00:17:53,480
Five years ago,

312
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,680
there have been housebreaking
cases in Moohyun.

313
00:17:55,809 --> 00:17:57,579
But since the incident
that happened in Hajeong,

314
00:17:57,579 --> 00:17:59,349
it was turned into burglary.

315
00:17:59,549 --> 00:18:02,750
All the cases happened
after there was no electricity.

316
00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:04,920
During the last crime
that happened in Yuljeong,

317
00:18:05,619 --> 00:18:07,890
the culprit violently killed...

318
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:09,730
a dog that was in the yard.

319
00:18:10,029 --> 00:18:11,799
All the victims from
the first and second cases...

320
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:14,599
have something to do with the fact
that the electricity had gone out.

321
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:40,160
The suspect would choose a target
in advance...

322
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:43,230
and cut the electricity off
on purpose.

323
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:44,529
That's strange.

324
00:18:44,859 --> 00:18:46,859
Look at the direction
the suspect moved.

325
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:52,900
It starts here, and it connects
all the way to Chungmyung,

326
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:55,710
as if this is his final destination.

327
00:18:55,809 --> 00:18:57,069
The final destination?

328
00:18:58,539 --> 00:19:00,509
It must mean a case
that started in Chungmyung...

329
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:02,480
became the trigger.

330
00:19:03,849 --> 00:19:06,980
Nana, let's narrow it down
to men in their 30s...

331
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:09,450
and focus on people from Chungmyung.

332
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:11,460
Let's do the background check
for past cases again.

333
00:19:11,589 --> 00:19:12,589
Yes, sir.

334
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:18,329
Sir, this is hard
for us to bring up too.

335
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:22,430
We'll return So Hee's will
after the investigation.

336
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:23,500
It's hard?

337
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:27,000
What's hard? If it's so hard,

338
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:31,039
why did you come six months after
she was buried...

339
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:34,549
to ask me about how she died?
How does this make sense?

340
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:39,619
Both my husband and I...

341
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,890
are just barely living on.

342
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:49,130
I'm very sorry that we're asking you
at this time,

343
00:19:50,259 --> 00:19:52,730
but we don't want more people
to be victimized like her.

344
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,369
We'll do our best to prevent it.

345
00:19:59,869 --> 00:20:01,200
I'm sorry,

346
00:20:01,809 --> 00:20:05,380
but we don't want
to help you anymore.

347
00:20:21,089 --> 00:20:22,160
Wait.

348
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:00,859
Our daughter...

349
00:21:02,599 --> 00:21:04,769
was very precious to my husband.

350
00:21:08,069 --> 00:21:10,410
It's too hard for him right now.

351
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,319
We came too late.

352
00:21:23,289 --> 00:21:24,349
I'm sorry.

353
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:28,690
We're her parents, but we lost her.

354
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:32,460
We should have prevented it.

355
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:34,559
Really?

356
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,000
You're lying, right?

357
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:53,049
(Dear fellow students, I'm writing
because I need your help.)

358
00:21:56,819 --> 00:21:59,890
(Reply: No way! I would die!
Reply: I know who she is.)

359
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:18,680
So Hee...

360
00:22:19,779 --> 00:22:22,250
was pregnant due to the rape.

361
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:01,789
(Suicide, suicide)

362
00:23:08,589 --> 00:23:09,690
Mom,

363
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:11,529
Dad,

364
00:23:12,759 --> 00:23:14,359
I'm sorry...

365
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:16,529
I'm a disappointing daughter.

366
00:23:19,269 --> 00:23:21,539
The reason why the criminal
stopped committing crimes...

367
00:23:22,309 --> 00:23:24,779
was because of So Hee's suicide
six months ago.

368
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:27,339
He could have felt guilty.

369
00:23:27,779 --> 00:23:29,750
He must think that he killed her.

370
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,349
After that,

371
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:35,119
his sadistic characteristic
would have magnified.

372
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:40,059
Looking at the state
Choi Yu Rim is in,

373
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:43,660
it won't be long
before he commits murder.

374
00:23:47,029 --> 00:23:49,130
Ms. Hong told me
you're a good soju drinker.

375
00:23:49,299 --> 00:23:50,329
Is this true?

376
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:56,210
Well, I guess it wouldn't be
so easy to be in a team...

377
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:57,910
that focuses on
sexual assault cases.

378
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:02,250
Prior to leaving the team,
I had to take a difficult case.

379
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:04,210
What was it?

380
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:07,220
Was it difficult
even for an NCI agent?

381
00:24:12,819 --> 00:24:15,359
There's always a first
in everything...

382
00:24:16,589 --> 00:24:19,329
whether that beginning
is painful or happy.

383
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,500
They must have a reason of its own.

384
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:26,599
I must be here now...

385
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:29,470
because of my time there.

386
00:24:37,109 --> 00:24:38,150
Sir.

387
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:42,420
There is something I have to check
with Choi Yu Rim.

388
00:24:52,099 --> 00:24:53,329
Did the culprit...

389
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:58,400
mention anything about children
or family?

390
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
No.

391
00:25:00,569 --> 00:25:04,269
Then did he say anything
about his misfortunes...

392
00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:08,380
or about his relationship
with other people?

393
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:14,279
There was no chance
for me to talk with him.

394
00:25:14,579 --> 00:25:16,049
One of the victims...

395
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:19,619
found out that she was pregnant
with his child...

396
00:25:22,029 --> 00:25:23,529
and took her own life.

397
00:25:30,869 --> 00:25:34,440
Yu Rim, did you think of something?

398
00:25:48,049 --> 00:25:49,690
Actually,

399
00:25:50,589 --> 00:25:52,460
I was trying to get pregnant.

400
00:25:53,619 --> 00:25:55,059
I'm getting old.

401
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:59,599
I couldn't tell my boyfriend,

402
00:26:01,099 --> 00:26:04,700
but I went to get consultation
from the fertility clinic.

403
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:09,509
He...

404
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:12,279
didn't want a baby.

405
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:14,079
When did that happen?

406
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:19,980
I visited the clinic
about a month before the incident.

407
00:26:20,349 --> 00:26:21,690
Did you...

408
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:24,619
tell anyone about it?

409
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,789
No.

410
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:29,890
I jokingly mentioned
to my friends...

411
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:33,700
that I want a baby,

412
00:26:35,299 --> 00:26:37,730
but I didn't tell anyone...

413
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:39,740
that I was planning for it.

414
00:26:41,369 --> 00:26:44,940
The other victim Jung Jin Hee
who is also in her 30s...

415
00:26:45,079 --> 00:26:48,450
had visited the same
fertility clinic as Choi Yu Rim.

416
00:26:48,779 --> 00:26:49,950
When did she go?

417
00:26:51,049 --> 00:26:52,220
Around the same time.

418
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:55,519
She was divorced,
and she wanted a child.

419
00:26:56,819 --> 00:26:58,250
Check the hospital records.

420
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:01,789
The culprit must be a staff
at the clinic,

421
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:05,200
or someone who can easily approach
the patient records.

422
00:27:05,259 --> 00:27:07,700
Yes, sir. There's one more thing.

423
00:27:08,059 --> 00:27:09,730
Both of the victims...

424
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:13,000
were prescribed with Clomifene,
a medication that induces ovulation.

425
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:16,309
Before the medication shows effects,

426
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:18,579
the clinic wouldn't perform
any procedures on patients.

427
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:25,819
The culprit approached the victims
knowing they were taking Clomifene.

428
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:27,880
If it was prior to getting
artificial insemination,

429
00:27:28,049 --> 00:27:30,450
there would be a higher chance
they would bear his child.

430
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:33,960
If the criminal
is committing sexual assault...

431
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:37,160
to impregnate his victims,

432
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:40,759
then those women
were perfect targets for him.

433
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:44,099
In the beginning, he chose
young and devoted Christians.

434
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:46,740
They're easy to control,

435
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:49,170
and he figured
they wouldn't get an abortion.

436
00:27:49,569 --> 00:27:51,339
However,
when So Hee committed suicide,

437
00:27:51,569 --> 00:27:55,049
he changed his target
to women that want babies.

438
00:27:55,049 --> 00:27:57,210
But why is he maltreating...

439
00:27:57,210 --> 00:27:58,579
the victims?

440
00:27:58,849 --> 00:28:01,349
He might be trying
to impregnate the victims...

441
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:03,819
as a means of letting out
his resentment and rage.

442
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:08,059
If that's the case,
it must be connected to a trauma.

443
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:13,859
(Infertility Clinic)

444
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:16,970
I'm sorry,
but whoever committed such crimes...

445
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:18,329
has nothing to do with us.

446
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,970
As you can see, most staff...

447
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:23,140
and patients are women here.

448
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:24,940
He could be a subcontractor,
supplier,

449
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:27,039
or even from your security company.

450
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:28,880
I'm not saying we won't cooperate.

451
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:31,049
I'm saying there's nothing
we can cooperate with.

452
00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:34,619
It's really heartbreaking
what happened.

453
00:28:34,819 --> 00:28:36,990
However, you should see things
from my point of view too.

454
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:39,690
As you know,

455
00:28:40,789 --> 00:28:43,289
less people are getting pregnant,

456
00:28:43,289 --> 00:28:45,029
and if there's a weird rumor
about us,

457
00:28:45,029 --> 00:28:46,900
it'll be too much damage.

458
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:50,230
We're not interested
in this hospital's...

459
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:52,000
profit or stake.

460
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,299
One thing for sure is that...

461
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:55,869
victims were raped...

462
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,710
after they went to this hospital.

463
00:29:00,509 --> 00:29:02,609
Can you fill this out please?

464
00:29:03,549 --> 00:29:05,150
What's that form?

465
00:29:06,049 --> 00:29:07,079
Excuse me.

466
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:11,349
It's a simple survey to provide
customized service...

467
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:12,619
to patients.

468
00:29:12,619 --> 00:29:13,690
Team Manager Kang.

469
00:29:22,069 --> 00:29:23,500
Has this been leaked?

470
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,500
Has this...

471
00:29:27,539 --> 00:29:30,109
even been leaked?

472
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:31,740
I sold this once...

473
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:34,410
to a research company,

474
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:38,309
but we never leaked patients'
medical record.

475
00:29:38,309 --> 00:29:39,319
I'll keep that in mind.

476
00:29:39,579 --> 00:29:40,579
No.

477
00:29:41,019 --> 00:29:42,390
Hold on.

478
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:44,720
Can you talk to me in private
for a minute?

479
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,619
The police will explain to you
about the related laws.

480
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:48,960
No.

481
00:29:51,329 --> 00:29:54,130
Look into a research company
named Happy Finding.

482
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:56,529
- Sure, Team Manager Kang.
- Find out...

483
00:29:56,529 --> 00:29:58,430
if it's related to the university
the victims went.

484
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,299
(Chungmyung Christian University)

485
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:03,940
They were in charge of new students'
orientation.

486
00:30:04,069 --> 00:30:05,140
Okay.

487
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:06,480
Let's go to Happy Finding.

488
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,480
Yes, sir.

489
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:12,950
We're researching on the university
students' awareness.

490
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:16,150
The first question is...

491
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,460
Are you sure our ex-employee did it?

492
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:24,490
I need the database of research...

493
00:30:24,829 --> 00:30:27,430
from infertility clinic and
Chungmyung Christian University.

494
00:30:27,529 --> 00:30:30,299
You're not sure
if he's our employee yet.

495
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:31,500
If you want,

496
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:34,470
we can always come back
with a warrant in an hour.

497
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:38,839
Team Manager Kang. I sorted out...

498
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:42,980
single men from early 30s to
early 40s who worked...

499
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:46,579
at Happy Finding
from 10 years ago until now.

500
00:30:47,019 --> 00:30:48,789
I have 20 on the list.

501
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:52,589
Find an employee who has a record
of calling the victims.

502
00:30:52,859 --> 00:30:53,960
There are three.

503
00:30:55,789 --> 00:30:58,730
All three aren't related
to the past crime.

504
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:01,730
They've all left the company.

505
00:31:01,829 --> 00:31:03,670
We need to figure out...

506
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:06,339
a potential victim
among the survey participants.

507
00:31:06,369 --> 00:31:09,539
The culprit knew well about
the victims' house structure.

508
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:10,809
He cut the power...

509
00:31:10,809 --> 00:31:13,140
and went in through unlocked door.

510
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:16,279
Do you think it's related
vocationally?

511
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:32,029
Why would you stay naked?
What if you catch a cold?

512
00:31:32,059 --> 00:31:33,759
Come here. Dry.

513
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:17,809
Hey, Ga Ram.

514
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:19,880
Let's go sleep inside.

515
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,579
Come here, Ga Ram.

516
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:23,750
There, there.

517
00:32:24,779 --> 00:32:25,880
Come here.

518
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:29,819
There, there. Okay.

519
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:31,920
Let's go.

520
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:40,660
Sleep tight.

521
00:32:54,309 --> 00:32:55,509
An unidentified man broke into...

522
00:32:55,509 --> 00:32:58,819
an elementary school teacher Park's
house last night at 10pm...

523
00:32:58,819 --> 00:33:01,450
and got away after raping Park.

524
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:02,819
It turns out..

525
00:33:02,819 --> 00:33:06,859
- he's a serial rapist...
- A word, please.

526
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:08,930
who raped university students
in Chungmyung...

527
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:11,990
for three months starting
in November, 2016.

528
00:33:12,299 --> 00:33:15,029
It turns out that the police...

529
00:33:15,029 --> 00:33:17,930
hid the existence of the rapist...

530
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:20,440
who raped four female
university students,

531
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:23,069
and two more women after them.

532
00:33:23,069 --> 00:33:25,980
Unfortunately, it is still not...

533
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:30,109
NCI's trying its best to resolve
the case as soon as possible.

534
00:33:30,109 --> 00:33:32,319
There will be an official briefing
soon,

535
00:33:32,319 --> 00:33:35,420
so please don't write
any speculative articles or reports.

536
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,089
At least the weather is nice.

537
00:33:46,259 --> 00:33:48,099
Park Ga Hyun, 36.

538
00:33:48,299 --> 00:33:51,329
She raised her child alone
after her husband died.

539
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:54,500
- Where's the child?
- In the room with Ms. Hong.

540
00:33:54,569 --> 00:33:56,369
He left a witness.

541
00:33:56,369 --> 00:33:57,569
It's a relief.

542
00:33:58,109 --> 00:33:59,140
A relief?

543
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:00,880
The culprit locked the child
in the closet.

544
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,250
Fortunately, he didn't see
his mom being raped.

545
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:06,750
You're saying that's a relief?

546
00:34:07,019 --> 00:34:08,019
What?

547
00:34:12,889 --> 00:34:16,429
Did the power go out from 10pm
until midnight?

548
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:17,860
Yes.

549
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:20,300
It's same as the previous crime.

550
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:23,400
The culprit left a message
this time.

551
00:34:27,969 --> 00:34:29,710
"Annunciatio dominae".

552
00:34:29,969 --> 00:34:31,769
It means the Annunciation in Latin.

553
00:34:31,769 --> 00:34:34,909
It represents the moment Gabrielle
tells the Virgin Mary...

554
00:34:34,909 --> 00:34:37,780
that she'll be pregnant.

555
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:41,250
He made the victims to see his face,

556
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,750
left a witness,

557
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:46,090
and even left a message.

558
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:49,590
It sure is his signature.

559
00:34:49,659 --> 00:34:50,989
Now that it's open to the public,

560
00:34:50,989 --> 00:34:53,800
he wants everyone to acknowledge
him.

561
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:58,400
Park Ga Hyun has nothing in common
with previous victims.

562
00:34:58,769 --> 00:35:00,500
She's never been to
the infertility clinic.

563
00:35:00,539 --> 00:35:02,670
Do you think the culprit
changed the target again?

564
00:35:02,769 --> 00:35:03,840
If so,

565
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:07,010
something about the victim must've
stimulated the culprit.

566
00:35:07,239 --> 00:35:09,250
What's different about this case
is that...

567
00:35:09,409 --> 00:35:12,349
he went after a victim with a child.

568
00:35:12,349 --> 00:35:14,219
What if the child left...

569
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,150
is a message?

570
00:35:16,519 --> 00:35:19,519
It could represent his childhood.

571
00:35:19,719 --> 00:35:22,860
The fact that the culprit made
the victims feel his trauma...

572
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:25,730
is common among cruel criminals.

573
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:32,170
Hey, Nana.

574
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,940
Find out if the victim...

575
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:36,739
participated in an organization
or any online communities.

576
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:39,539
Go meet the victim, Sun Woo.

577
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:40,710
Yes, sir.

578
00:35:49,449 --> 00:35:51,119
I'm from NCI.

579
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:02,500
How's Ga Ram?

580
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:04,400
He's fine.

581
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:06,900
One of our agents is taking
care of him.

582
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:13,940
Ga Hyun.

583
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:17,579
Can you tell me...

584
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:19,880
what happened last night?

585
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:32,900
Promise me...

586
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:38,269
that you will...

587
00:36:40,369 --> 00:36:41,469
arrest him...

588
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,340
no matter what.

589
00:36:44,909 --> 00:36:45,909
Yes.

590
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,710
I promise.

591
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:03,789
Hi, Honey.

592
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:33,159
Are you all right?

593
00:37:35,489 --> 00:37:37,989
To be honest, it's a little hard.

594
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:40,130
May I ask you a question?

595
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:43,730
Sun Woo looks a little different
today.

596
00:37:44,269 --> 00:37:46,099
Do you know anything about it?

597
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:49,739
It's probably because of an
incident that happened in the past.

598
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:54,579
It's the last case she was in charge
of when she worked as a task force.

599
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:57,650
Six years ago, there was a case...

600
00:37:58,179 --> 00:38:02,219
in which waitresses of Seowoo-dong
area were abducted and raped.

601
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:05,619
Not many people cared
as they were waitresses at a bar.

602
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:08,460
And there were not enough officers
at the station to investigate.

603
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:11,190
That was when Sun Woo volunteered
to act as bait.

604
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:13,429
She said she wouldn't have become
a police officer...

605
00:38:13,559 --> 00:38:15,800
if she was going to choose
who deserved to be saved.

606
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:18,570
Tuck your hair on the right side
if you think you found the culprit.

607
00:40:34,869 --> 00:40:38,639
When we arrived at the scene,
the waitress had already died.

608
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,539
Sun Woo had a hard time.

609
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:43,579
And she was sent to another team.

610
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:46,150
Did you arrest the culprit then?

611
00:40:46,619 --> 00:40:49,019
Yes, he's serving his sentence now.

612
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:09,170
I searched for suspects
at the fertility clinic,

613
00:41:09,170 --> 00:41:12,039
the research company, and among
people around Park Ga Hyun.

614
00:41:12,269 --> 00:41:14,840
But there was no one
that fit our profile.

615
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:17,250
Was there any women
who filled the survey...

616
00:41:17,449 --> 00:41:19,349
who could be
the culprit's type of target?

617
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:21,719
Most of them were women
of infertile couples.

618
00:41:22,219 --> 00:41:24,920
They don't seem like women
that the victim would target.

619
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:27,059
I found someone
from the list of suspects...

620
00:41:27,059 --> 00:41:29,829
whose hometown is Chungmyung.

621
00:41:30,329 --> 00:41:32,389
He doesn't have anything to do
with the research company,

622
00:41:32,389 --> 00:41:34,929
but he was interrogated once
for spreading pornography.

623
00:41:35,869 --> 00:41:37,929
His name is Choi Min Ho,
and he is 34 years old.

624
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:40,670
He works as a security guard
at a bank.

625
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,710
He's the closest one to our profile.

626
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:44,570
What about the other one?

627
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:49,409
While I was researching on
Happy Finding,

628
00:41:49,409 --> 00:41:52,349
I found out that there have been
illegal database deals.

629
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:55,519
Park Ga Hyun was in the list
that has been illegally transferred.

630
00:41:56,019 --> 00:41:57,150
It's from a cafe
for divorced singles.

631
00:41:57,550 --> 00:42:01,889
One of the members, Oh Ju Hwan,
still lives in Chungmyung,

632
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:05,630
and he had been interrogated as
an accomplice in a similar case.

633
00:42:07,329 --> 00:42:09,670
We can't arrest a culprit
because he matches our profile.

634
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:12,699
If we move hastily
before we find evidence,

635
00:42:13,170 --> 00:42:14,769
it could only have reverse effects.

636
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:18,369
Yes. According to his
pattern until now,

637
00:42:18,769 --> 00:42:21,239
he will move again in a few days.

638
00:42:21,909 --> 00:42:23,110
We need to use a bait.

639
00:42:24,949 --> 00:42:26,750
We can answer the survey
with fake information.

640
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,019
I will do it.

641
00:42:30,449 --> 00:42:31,449
Sun Woo.

642
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:34,159
We can't.

643
00:42:34,659 --> 00:42:35,929
We don't have time.

644
00:42:36,130 --> 00:42:39,090
There could be more victims
if we don't.

645
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,769
What's my profile?

646
00:42:47,869 --> 00:42:49,199
You're a deputy director
at a law firm.

647
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,710
You are 36 years old and divorced.

648
00:42:52,239 --> 00:42:54,880
You answered the survey
48 hours ago.

649
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:57,380
The research company
has your information,

650
00:42:57,710 --> 00:42:59,550
so he won't overlook it.

651
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:03,389
Act naturally...

652
00:43:03,889 --> 00:43:05,489
so that he can watch you.

653
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:09,829
He won't wait long
like he did with his former victims.

654
00:43:10,690 --> 00:43:13,300
As soon as he appears,
we will go after him.

655
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:15,599
So act calmly.

656
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:17,829
We want him...

657
00:43:18,099 --> 00:43:19,800
to go inside.

658
00:43:20,469 --> 00:43:22,969
If he trespasses, we could obtain...

659
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:26,039
evidence with his DNA.

660
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:28,409
Ms. Hong and I
will be outside the house.

661
00:43:29,079 --> 00:43:32,719
Sun Woo, don't forget to keep
the radio connected.

662
00:43:34,349 --> 00:43:36,920
Sun Woo, are you all right
with this?

663
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:38,750
Of course.

664
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:40,519
Be careful.

665
00:43:44,730 --> 00:43:46,260
You don't need to worry.

666
00:43:59,539 --> 00:44:00,880
(Happy Finding)

667
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:55,530
All right.

668
00:44:57,630 --> 00:44:58,769
Keep watching.

669
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:42,539
The culprit has access...

670
00:45:42,539 --> 00:45:45,010
to not only the victims
but to everyone.

671
00:45:45,010 --> 00:45:48,119
He was in charge of the research
for the freshmen's orientation.

672
00:45:48,119 --> 00:45:51,150
The culprit was used to the
structure of the victim's houses.

673
00:45:51,989 --> 00:45:55,360
He cut off the electricity and went
through the door he had opened.

674
00:45:56,059 --> 00:45:58,460
Do you think that could have
anything to do with his job?

675
00:46:01,099 --> 00:46:03,599
He has a job that allows him...

676
00:46:05,230 --> 00:46:07,170
to watch the victims' houses...

677
00:46:08,039 --> 00:46:09,739
without suspicion...

678
00:46:10,539 --> 00:46:13,179
and to obtain information...

679
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:15,780
from a research company.

680
00:46:54,119 --> 00:46:55,119
Get ready.

681
00:46:56,119 --> 00:46:59,889
Find out if there's anyone who works
as the building maintenance...

682
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:03,630
of research company's building
was involved in these past cases.

683
00:47:25,809 --> 00:47:27,980
His name is Kim Hyung Soo,
and he is 35 years old.

684
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:31,750
He worked as a security guard
at Happy Finding.

685
00:47:33,219 --> 00:47:35,659
He was booked without detention
for a short while...

686
00:47:35,659 --> 00:47:38,289
for assaulting his girlfriend.

687
00:47:38,829 --> 00:47:42,030
Six years ago, he lived
with his girlfriend named Hannah.

688
00:47:42,030 --> 00:47:44,929
After the assault,
she moved out right away.

689
00:47:44,929 --> 00:47:46,940
About a year ago,
she married someone else...

690
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:48,670
and moved out of the country.

691
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:52,909
His ex-girlfriend's marriage
stimulated Kim Hyung Soo's trauma.

692
00:47:53,010 --> 00:47:55,010
Yes, I believe that's what happened.

693
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,780
Hannah registered her marriage...

694
00:47:57,849 --> 00:48:01,179
just a week before
the first sexual assault.

695
00:48:01,519 --> 00:48:02,579
I need you to check...

696
00:48:02,579 --> 00:48:05,849
if the same security car
was seen around the victims.

697
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:35,119
Let go.

698
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:40,789
(NCI Kim Hyun Jun)

699
00:48:45,159 --> 00:48:46,900
The number you're calling...

700
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:04,280
Oh Ju Hwan.

701
00:49:04,449 --> 00:49:06,280
You're arrested for serial rape.

702
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:07,679
- Pardon?
- Get up!

703
00:49:07,679 --> 00:49:09,179
What are you doing?

704
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:10,420
Hold still.

705
00:49:10,650 --> 00:49:12,289
- Get him.
- Let go!

706
00:49:12,289 --> 00:49:13,289
Stay still.

707
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:14,420
What is this?

708
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:16,690
What are you doing?

709
00:49:18,489 --> 00:49:19,489
(One missed call: NCI Ha Sun Woo)

710
00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:31,670
Yes, sir.

711
00:49:31,670 --> 00:49:34,880
The culprit works for
the research company's security.

712
00:49:35,010 --> 00:49:37,409
- Pardon?
- The car of the security company...

713
00:49:37,409 --> 00:49:40,449
was caught on the CCTV cameras
surrounding the victims' homes.

714
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:47,320
Ha Sun Woo.

715
00:49:48,159 --> 00:49:49,219
Ha Sun Woo.

716
00:49:52,630 --> 00:49:55,329
Sir, Sun Woo isn't here.

717
00:49:55,329 --> 00:49:56,699
Her phone is turned off.

718
00:49:58,099 --> 00:49:59,599
I don't think it's Oh Ju Hwan.

719
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:01,900
He was calling
an illegal massage parlor...

720
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:03,809
to find its location.

721
00:50:11,710 --> 00:50:14,150
Find out Kim Hyung Soo's address,

722
00:50:14,150 --> 00:50:16,280
and send it to Hyun Jun
and the team on ground.

723
00:50:23,989 --> 00:50:27,429
(Obstetrics)

724
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,110
Hannah.

725
00:50:37,909 --> 00:50:39,139
How can you do this to me?

726
00:50:39,139 --> 00:50:40,239
Move.

727
00:50:42,909 --> 00:50:45,079
I don't have your baby anymore,

728
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:47,250
so I won't ever have to
see you again.

729
00:50:47,250 --> 00:50:48,250
What?

730
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:49,920
Did you think...

731
00:50:50,550 --> 00:50:51,949
I'd marry...

732
00:50:51,949 --> 00:50:54,320
a poor man without a future...

733
00:50:54,519 --> 00:50:56,289
who always hits me?

734
00:50:58,989 --> 00:51:00,929
I'd rather die alone...

735
00:51:00,929 --> 00:51:03,570
than raise a child that looks you.

736
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:05,329
Don't you dare...

737
00:51:06,599 --> 00:51:08,500
touch me anymore.

738
00:51:21,079 --> 00:51:22,079
Let go!

739
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:30,730
Fine, kill me.

740
00:51:30,789 --> 00:51:31,960
Kill me!

741
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:34,360
- Just kill me instead!
- What are you doing?

742
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:35,530
Hey!

743
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:44,539
Kim Hyung Soo, Ha Sun Woo.

744
00:51:45,239 --> 00:51:46,940
Where are you?

745
00:52:21,809 --> 00:52:23,039
Where do you think he went?

746
00:52:24,809 --> 00:52:25,809
Yes.

747
00:52:26,449 --> 00:52:28,849
I need you to check
if Hyung Soo and Hannah...

748
00:52:28,849 --> 00:52:31,750
had a place registered
as home together before.

749
00:52:31,750 --> 00:52:33,519
After that,
track for the vehicle nearby.

750
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:34,760
Okay.

751
00:52:42,699 --> 00:52:45,170
I found Kim Hyung Soo's car.

752
00:52:46,769 --> 00:52:48,800
In 2011, Kim Hyung Soo and Hannah...

753
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:50,909
registered for the same house.

754
00:52:50,909 --> 00:52:52,110
This is the address.

755
00:52:52,639 --> 00:52:54,780
The area
is under redevelopment right now.

756
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,380
It's currently vacant.

757
00:53:16,730 --> 00:53:18,170
Were you waiting...

758
00:53:18,329 --> 00:53:20,239
to catch me there?

759
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:27,340
Are you looking for this?

760
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:29,210
You're just a weak woman...

761
00:53:29,639 --> 00:53:31,010
without this.

762
00:53:31,679 --> 00:53:32,679
That's who you are.

763
00:53:33,150 --> 00:53:34,219
Kim Hyung Soo.

764
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:37,349
Is this how you treat women?

765
00:53:37,349 --> 00:53:38,949
NCI agent...

766
00:53:40,090 --> 00:53:41,760
isn't much different.

767
00:53:42,090 --> 00:53:43,690
What would you know?

768
00:53:45,590 --> 00:53:48,260
You must not know me.

769
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:49,599
Once you get to know me,

770
00:53:49,969 --> 00:53:52,000
you'll change your mind.

771
00:53:53,199 --> 00:53:55,269
If you realize how much
they wanted me...

772
00:53:55,269 --> 00:53:57,170
and liked me,

773
00:53:59,139 --> 00:54:02,940
you'll be dying to have my child.

774
00:54:03,449 --> 00:54:04,449
No.

775
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:06,750
I know very well
how people like you are.

776
00:54:07,050 --> 00:54:09,820
You never dated a woman properly.

777
00:54:10,389 --> 00:54:12,750
All you do is try to overpower them.

778
00:54:13,989 --> 00:54:15,360
If you don't treat them harshly,

779
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:18,460
you can't even feel anything.
You're a perverted sadist.

780
00:54:19,059 --> 00:54:20,460
That's what you are.

781
00:54:21,199 --> 00:54:23,699
You were probably just as horrible
when you were young.

782
00:54:24,869 --> 00:54:27,039
Someone with a proper past...

783
00:54:27,639 --> 00:54:29,570
wouldn't treat women like you.

784
00:54:32,210 --> 00:54:35,510
So you know me well, don't you?

785
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:39,150
Shall we check?

786
00:54:40,179 --> 00:54:43,150
Let's see how different you are
compared to other women.

787
00:54:47,090 --> 00:54:49,389
How does it feel?
Does it feel real now?

788
00:54:50,030 --> 00:54:51,329
Shall we check?

789
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:55,800
No woman has ever looked at me
like you do.

790
00:54:56,329 --> 00:54:57,469
It excites me.

791
00:54:58,900 --> 00:54:59,969
Stay still!

792
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:02,800
You'll feel good soon.

793
00:55:04,639 --> 00:55:05,969
I said, stay still.

794
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:07,780
I told you, you'll feel great.

795
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:30,000
Let me ask you one thing.

796
00:55:31,929 --> 00:55:34,769
Why does someone like you
want a child?

797
00:55:34,769 --> 00:55:35,840
See?

798
00:55:37,769 --> 00:55:40,380
You also want to know me, don't you?

799
00:55:41,010 --> 00:55:42,639
You like it,
but you act like you don't.

800
00:55:43,650 --> 00:55:45,309
You act clean, but you're dirty.

801
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:47,849
You pretend to be chaste
when you're not.

802
00:55:47,849 --> 00:55:49,219
Come here.

803
00:55:49,219 --> 00:55:50,849
- No.
- Follow me.

804
00:55:50,849 --> 00:55:52,219
No.

805
00:55:52,949 --> 00:55:53,989
Go in.

806
00:55:54,389 --> 00:55:57,360
Don't cry. Stay quiet in there.

807
00:55:57,360 --> 00:56:00,300
No. I don't want to.

808
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:01,429
Mommy.

809
00:56:02,730 --> 00:56:04,199
Stop it.

810
00:56:05,469 --> 00:56:07,039
That's what women are like.

811
00:56:07,469 --> 00:56:10,539
I only served those women.

812
00:56:11,369 --> 00:56:12,869
I'm only trying to...

813
00:56:14,179 --> 00:56:16,880
