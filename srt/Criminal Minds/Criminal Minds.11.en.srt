One thing for sure is that...

10
00:00:42,579 --> 00:00:45,619
from double emotions he couldn't
embrace at a young age.

11
00:00:48,189 --> 00:00:51,689
But why did they
kidnap children from a public place?

12
00:00:51,689 --> 00:00:55,159
I heard it clearly
that her son is their accomplice.

13
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,530
The place where they were abused
as children.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,799
They were murdered in their house
about an hour ago.

15
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:04,900
An hour ago?

16
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:07,109
The criminals called the police...

17
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:09,439
and said they'll kill them soon.

18
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,140
Why did you do that?

19
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:15,049
What am I going to do now?

20
00:01:15,049 --> 00:01:16,609
Where were the victims stabbed?

21
00:01:16,609 --> 00:01:18,019
To be more exact...

22
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:22,890
This was mainly used
to kill animals, not humans.

23
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:29,230
I just saw a video in a
media platform site.

24
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:31,329
A video of the murder scene?

25
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:35,000
No. This is a warning.

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,170
Did you see how crazy the world is?

27
00:01:38,269 --> 00:01:40,439
This is the real beginning.

- Dad.

34
00:03:38,289 --> 00:03:41,860
Dad. Dad. Dad. Dad.

35
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:45,229
Dad. I'm sorry, Dad.

36
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,900
Dad.

37
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:52,039
I'm sorry, Dad.

38
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:53,710
Dad.

39
00:03:53,939 --> 00:03:55,240
Dad.

40
00:03:56,409 --> 00:03:58,080
I'm sorry, Dad.

41
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:59,310
Dad.

42
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:03,949
No. I'm sorry, Dad.

43
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:05,520
This world is corrupted.

44
00:04:06,849 --> 00:04:10,020
To bring the justice back,
we must get strong.

45
00:04:12,189 --> 00:04:13,360
This mark...

46
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:15,659
will prove it.

47
00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:18,230
No, Dad. Dad.

48
00:04:32,209 --> 00:04:34,649
I talked to some people who
visited Yoon Sung Jin's home...

49
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:35,709
on the day of the incident.

50
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,449
They didn't notice anything strange.

51
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:42,319
Also, they both have
a pretty good reputation.

52
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:45,959
They had no financial issues nor did
anyone have grudges against them.

53
00:04:46,389 --> 00:04:48,660
Then why did the criminal
target those two people?

54
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:51,930
If he was after greedy people
like he said,

55
00:04:52,029 --> 00:04:54,829
he may have picked a random house
while he was passing by.

56
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:57,069
Their house stands out.

57
00:04:58,069 --> 00:05:00,470
Their house isn't easy to reach
in terms of location.

58
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:04,709
No. There are even bigger houses
on the entrance of the road.

59
00:05:05,339 --> 00:05:08,550
We must find out what made
the criminal go after them.

60
00:05:09,449 --> 00:05:12,449
There must be an unseen connection.

61
00:05:14,889 --> 00:05:15,889
How did it go?

62
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:21,230
The cut on the victims are identical
to that of butchery.

63
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,360
It's very likely that one of the
culprits worked in a slaughterhouse.

64
00:05:24,459 --> 00:05:26,829
Here's the list of people who worked
in a slaughterhouse in this area.

65
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:34,910
Find out if any of these people
on the list...

66
00:05:35,069 --> 00:05:38,110
are even slightly related
to the victims.

67
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:39,310
Yes, sir.

68
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:40,680
Team Manager Kang.

69
00:05:40,949 --> 00:05:42,550
You must see this.

70
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,579
He said that...

71
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:48,949
this world is suffering from greed.

72
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,060
It's the voice of the caller.

73
00:05:53,259 --> 00:05:54,259
So...

74
00:05:55,459 --> 00:05:59,360
we need be judged sternly
by the law.

75
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,870
Does he mean the executioner
from his first call?

76
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:07,370
He could mean Dike, the goddess of
Justice from the tarot card he left,

77
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:10,269
or he could mean what he read
from the book.

78
00:06:10,509 --> 00:06:11,579
I think...

79
00:06:12,209 --> 00:06:14,850
someone is controlling him.

80
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:18,779
To bring justice back to this world,

81
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:22,319
I shall punish your sins
seven times.

82
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,620
I'm hearing this voice
for the first time.

83
00:06:25,089 --> 00:06:26,990
Do you think he has another
accomplice?

84
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:28,430
He said seven times.

85
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:32,160
That means there will be
six more cases like this.

86
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,939
Why would he upload a video
like this?

87
00:06:40,339 --> 00:06:41,370
Wait.

88
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:45,879
The laptop camera was turned on
suddenly.

89
00:06:58,389 --> 00:07:01,430
You saw what they are doing,
didn't you?

90
00:07:03,329 --> 00:07:04,529
I told you so.

91
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:08,430
This world is filled with people
trying to stop us.

92
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,920
The laptop has connected to the
internet by itself...

93
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,519
and is sending the video somewhere.

94
00:07:28,889 --> 00:07:30,089
Can we track it?

95
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,290
Yes, I have already started.

96
00:07:33,259 --> 00:07:34,360
(You can never stop us.)

97
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:35,889
Team Manager Kang.

98
00:07:38,329 --> 00:07:39,699
(If you try to stop us,
we will judge you...)

99
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:42,430
(in the name of the law.)

100
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:43,870
Someone...

101
00:07:44,569 --> 00:07:46,470
is controlling this laptop remotely.

102
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:50,939
Found out if Yoon Sung Jin has
made a call regarding...

103
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:53,279
computer repair
during the last six months.

104
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,550
Yes, sir.

105
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,980
If I look into it,

106
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:00,720
I will be able to find out
what the culprit has hidden inside.

107
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:02,589
The video that we just saw...

108
00:08:03,819 --> 00:08:06,019
is spreading really fast.

109
00:08:08,589 --> 00:08:10,089
How can they react like that?

110
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,560
This is horrible.

111
00:08:12,829 --> 00:08:15,629
Everyone must think that
this was a directed scene.

112
00:08:16,069 --> 00:08:18,699
They see so many images
on a daily basis...

113
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:21,509
that they think it's part of
a marketing for a horror movie.

114
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:23,980
The culprit was right
about one thing.

115
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:27,410
The world is becoming ill.

116
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,919
Yes, this is the
technical computer support service.

117
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,190
I received a laptop as a present,

118
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:40,490
but I can't hear any sounds.

119
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:42,429
All right.

120
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:44,559
What is the model of the laptop?

121
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,159
I don't know.

122
00:08:46,299 --> 00:08:50,200
If you look at the back,
there will be a number.

123
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:52,440
Do you...

124
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:57,440
by chance, have a camera
on your laptop?

125
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:58,940
Yes, I think so.

126
00:08:59,809 --> 00:09:02,580
But why do you ask?
My laptop has a problem with sounds.

127
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:05,580
I asked you just to make sure.

128
00:09:06,549 --> 00:09:09,389
All right, I think I can help you.

129
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:14,389
But first, I need to get
remote access to your laptop.

130
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,730
No.

131
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:22,799
Kill that witch.

132
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,740
What? Were you saying that to me?

133
00:09:28,269 --> 00:09:29,409
No.

134
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:34,779
This woman has just made a mistake.

135
00:09:36,379 --> 00:09:39,120
We don't need to do anything.

136
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:40,750
No.

137
00:09:41,549 --> 00:09:44,360
They must pay the price
for their sins.

138
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:48,889
Let's check what we already know.

139
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:51,730
He has an efficient way of killing.

140
00:09:51,929 --> 00:09:55,629
The victims' bodies all show traces
of being slaughtered like animals.

141
00:09:55,629 --> 00:09:58,600
We are searching for suspects among
people who have worked...

142
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,039
at nearby slaughterhouses.

143
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:03,470
As there are no similar cases in
the database over the past 10 years,

144
00:10:03,809 --> 00:10:05,809
it's likely that this
is his first murder.

145
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:08,610
One of the culprits thinks that
he is carrying out the law...

146
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:10,250
and making a judgement.

147
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,120
He may have schizophrenia...

148
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,419
which causes auditory and visual
hallucinations.

149
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:19,059
The other would have control
of himself to do the computer work.

150
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:23,029
In cases like this, the one
with the judgement leads the team.

151
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,399
That is the strange part.

152
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:27,059
When they have accomplices
like this,

153
00:10:27,529 --> 00:10:29,730
they follow the order
of the one with the judgement.

154
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,299
But that's not the case here.

155
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:34,409
If you listen to the phone call,

156
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:38,179
the informant tried to stop the man
but couldn't.

157
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:43,279
This shows that the accomplice
did not follow the order.

158
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:45,750
This doesn't fit
the general profile.

159
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,120
Maybe he called the police...

160
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,889
not to stop the murder...

161
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,490
but to prepare for when they
got caught by the police.

162
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:57,830
If that's not the case, he might
have an abnormal mentality...

163
00:10:57,929 --> 00:10:59,529
that enjoys situations like this.

164
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:03,299
The culprit accessed the victim's
laptop and observed him.

165
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:06,000
That means that the culprit tried...

166
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,610
to contact the victim in some way.

167
00:11:08,809 --> 00:11:10,539
But we couldn't track anything...

168
00:11:10,539 --> 00:11:13,080
from the victim's call records that
could trace back to the culprit.

169
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,409
I think he contacted the victims...

170
00:11:15,409 --> 00:11:18,820
through other methods
such as messengers or emails.

171
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:22,450
You should each organize your list
of suspects.

172
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:23,649
Yes, sir.

173
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:38,840
There was a report that says
they saw someone strange...

174
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,340
in front of Yoon Sung Jin's house
three months ago.

175
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:44,440
(Verification for Report of a Case)

176
00:11:44,539 --> 00:11:46,679
We'll visit the informant.

177
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:48,149
(Verification for Report of a Case)

178
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:54,820
Team Manager Kang.

179
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,200
- Lieutenant.
- Hello.

180
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:14,340
Did you find something?

181
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:16,340
Yes. We were looking around
his house...

182
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,710
and found evidence of forced entry.

183
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,710
The culprit must have accessed
the victim's laptop...

184
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:22,179
and found the password of his house.

185
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:25,679
Most passwords consist of
personal information.

186
00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:28,019
Yes. And he called again.

187
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:29,220
It was different this time.

188
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:31,419
It seemed like he was alone.

189
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:32,919
Who was it?

190
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:35,659
He called himself the "Executor".

191
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:37,600
Who is the victim?

192
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,299
The victim is Yoon Ju An,
41 years old.

193
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:43,269
He is the tennis teacher of
the house owner, Han Seung Hee.

194
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:46,440
He was found dead in the bedroom
with his neck cut open.

195
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,370
- Then...
- Yes.

196
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,340
I called the husband,

197
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,009
and he is on a business trip.

198
00:12:52,509 --> 00:12:54,110
What happened to Han Seung Hee?

199
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:56,980
Her car and keys are still here,

200
00:12:57,149 --> 00:12:58,250
but she has disappeared.

201
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,590
We're investigating the security
footage around the area.

202
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:17,370
(The Devil)

203
00:13:22,039 --> 00:13:23,440
It's adultery this time.

204
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:25,379
It's "The Devil" card.

205
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,809
This card represents
sexual corruption...

206
00:13:29,049 --> 00:13:30,919
or exposure of desire.

207
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:36,590
People who have committed adultery
have destroyed a family...

208
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,360
and deserve to be executed.

209
00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:40,620
This time he only killed the man...

210
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:41,990
and abducted the woman.

211
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:46,230
There must be a reason why
he changed his pattern.

212
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:01,110
He has been watching them
through this.

213
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,389
I condemn this woman to execution...

214
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:12,720
for the sin of adultery.

215
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,830
Please don't kill me.

216
00:14:15,029 --> 00:14:18,230
Please don't kill me.
I'll do everything you say.

217
00:14:19,129 --> 00:14:20,200
Please don't kill me.

218
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,669
Shut your mouth!

219
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:24,669
Father,

220
00:14:25,169 --> 00:14:27,970
this is murder.

221
00:14:28,769 --> 00:14:31,110
Please stop it.

222
00:14:31,309 --> 00:14:33,610
Shut it, you scumbag.

223
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:37,309
You are weak because of your mother.

224
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,649
Shut your mouth
and follow the judgement.

225
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:43,889
Executor, prepare the execution.

226
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:48,230
I'm sorry.

227
00:14:52,029 --> 00:14:53,460
I'm sorry.

228
00:15:04,909 --> 00:15:07,610
Do you have a hunch?

229
00:15:08,149 --> 00:15:09,980
When culprits have accomplices,

230
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,120
one is the ruler,
while the other is the subordinate.

231
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:16,250
And the relationship...

232
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,690
usually continues.

233
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:20,389
It's rare...

234
00:15:21,029 --> 00:15:23,559
that the relationship and the roles
are mixed...

235
00:15:24,059 --> 00:15:25,600
like in this case.

236
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:28,269
So?

237
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:31,799
The culprit might not be
who we think it is.

238
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:40,580
Laws exist to reform people,

239
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:44,980
not punish them.

240
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:50,350
Please forgive her.

241
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:52,460
Please don't kill me.

242
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,519
No.

243
00:15:54,529 --> 00:15:57,429
Humans never learn
unless they are punished.

244
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,070
If you say one more word,
you'll be punished as well.

245
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:04,129
I'm sorry.

246
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,769
I'm sorry, Father.

247
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:08,610
This is my last warning.

248
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:12,580
Don't think about doing anything
stupid and do as you are told.

249
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,429
Those who committed adultery...

250
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,070
shall be put to death,

251
00:16:38,269 --> 00:16:42,570
yet to make them pay for their sin
until the last moment,

252
00:16:42,809 --> 00:16:45,940
choose the most merciless
punishment.

253
00:16:46,379 --> 00:16:47,379
("The Seven Deadly Sins
and the Justice")

254
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:01,789
What do you mean
by the Executioner...

255
00:17:01,889 --> 00:17:03,360
doesn't actually exist?

256
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:07,799
An executioner is a person
who executes the law,

257
00:17:08,299 --> 00:17:10,430
and the criminal has a desire to...

258
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:12,970
carry out the laws he made.

259
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:14,569
That means...

260
00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:15,640
There...

261
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:18,309
may be only one criminal.

262
00:17:20,509 --> 00:17:22,980
The internal desire of
the weak criminal...

263
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:25,019
created another ego.

264
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:29,250
If the criminal actually has
a multiple personality disorder,

265
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:33,119
all the contradictory evidence
in the crime scene makes sense.

266
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:41,930
- Yes.
- Team Manager Kang.

267
00:17:42,069 --> 00:17:45,240
The crazy man posted a new video.
I'm connecting right now.

268
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:48,210
The number of downloads
is increasing geometrically.

269
00:17:48,369 --> 00:17:50,339
Put it on the monitor
as soon as you connect.

270
00:17:50,339 --> 00:17:51,609
Yes, sir.

271
00:17:58,119 --> 00:17:59,220
Okay.

272
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,890
Oh, my gosh.

273
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:07,859
I see it now.

274
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:13,359
Why the criminal killed people
that way.

275
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,099
It's not a slaughterhouse,

276
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:17,269
but a dog-breeding farm.

277
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:21,910
How many dog-breeding farms
are in this area?

278
00:18:22,069 --> 00:18:23,869
We don't have an exact data.

279
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,240
There are some dog-breeding farms
around here,

280
00:18:27,849 --> 00:18:29,650
but they're mostly illegal.

Kim Min Soo.

282
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:26,940
Kim Min Soo.

283
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:33,279
I don't think he's in.

284
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:35,279
We can't just leave...

285
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,480
after coming all the way here.

286
00:19:39,349 --> 00:19:41,250
The lights are on,

287
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:42,650
so he must be nearby.

288
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,289
I'll go check.

289
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,220
The reporter might show up,

290
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:47,759
so wait here.

291
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:49,430
Be careful. It's dark.

292
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:50,490
Yes.

Team Manager Kang.

294
00:20:01,809 --> 00:20:04,779
I found a website where they
buy dogs raised for food.

295
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:08,609
I'll get the database of people
who accessed and send it to you.

296
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:11,079
(List of Venders)

297
00:20:12,049 --> 00:20:14,480
Team Manager Kang.
Take a look at this data.

298
00:20:16,349 --> 00:20:18,660
A man named Kim Il Ho is
on the list.

299
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:21,359
He has a record of passing the first
entry bar exam 10 years ago.

300
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:26,130
Then three years ago,
he was fined for running...

301
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:27,660
an illegal dog-breeding farm
in Homan Mountain.

302
00:20:28,099 --> 00:20:30,200
After he passed
the first entry bar exam,

303
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,900
there was no record,

304
00:20:32,339 --> 00:20:33,769
then he ran a dog-breeding farm?

305
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:37,039
If he gave up after trying
for so long,

306
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,410
perhaps he couldn't fit
in with society.

307
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:40,980
That could lead...

308
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:44,049
to an abnormal obsession to the law.

309
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:48,420
He's the closest to our profile.

310
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:51,859
But the man in the video is not
that old.

311
00:20:57,329 --> 00:20:58,859
He has a son.

314
00:21:08,109 --> 00:21:10,410
There was a report on

315
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:12,740
by Yoon Sung Jin's house
three month ago.

317
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,910
We'll go meet the reporter.

318
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:19,549
He called to see...

319
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:23,789
how long it takes
for the police to arrive.

322
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:11,799
Go check the house
with the team manager.

323
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,259
The dog cages are this way.

324
00:23:46,529 --> 00:23:47,660
Freeze.

Sun Woo, it's me. Hyun Jun.

327
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:00,980
Sun Woo.

328
00:24:01,609 --> 00:24:03,250
Call the ambulance.

329
00:24:04,819 --> 00:24:06,980
What's wrong? Are you hurt?

00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:08,490
I'm fine.

331
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,190
Kim Min Soo is the criminal.

332
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,259
I know that.

333
00:24:18,059 --> 00:24:19,059
Min Young.

334
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,759
Where is Min Young?

335
00:24:22,099 --> 00:24:23,099
What?

336
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,829
It seems he already left.

337
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:53,859
They're gone now.

338
00:25:58,529 --> 00:25:59,730
Who are you?

339
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:04,029
Did you not hear me?

340
00:26:05,369 --> 00:26:08,640
I already introduced myself
when I called the police.

341
00:26:09,509 --> 00:26:10,569
Why...

342
00:26:15,079 --> 00:26:17,150
Why did you bring me here?

343
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:24,720
Once a verdict is given,

344
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:28,930
I will execute the law.

345
00:26:32,329 --> 00:26:35,230
Yoo Min Young of NCI.

346
00:26:36,369 --> 00:26:38,700
You protect the law.

347
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:45,609
But what have you done wrong?

348
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:03,990
We need to know exactly where
Kim Min Soo took Min Young.

349
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:06,400
There must be an evidence somewhere.

350
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:08,630
- You need to help me.
- Yes, Team Manager Kang.

351
00:27:09,299 --> 00:27:11,769
What should we do?
Are you all right?

352
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,400
Yes.

353
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:17,569
The computer is the only way
he communicates with the world.

354
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:19,380
Analyze everything.

355
00:27:19,809 --> 00:27:22,009
All right. I'll do everything I can.

356
00:27:22,009 --> 00:27:23,049
Here.

357
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:31,789
Check where he connected...

358
00:27:31,789 --> 00:27:33,819
and what he saw.

359
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:41,599
Game, internet articles,
and foreign soccer games.

360
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,900
There's nothing special.

361
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:46,000
Murderers with a sense of duty...

362
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,339
try to confirm their beliefs
constantly.

363
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:52,079
Kim Min Soo is obsessed with law.

364
00:27:52,509 --> 00:27:54,940
There would be something
that has to do with law.

365
00:27:56,579 --> 00:27:57,809
There's nothing like that here.

366
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:00,779
If not, he could have watched
murder videos,

367
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:02,650
or violent videos...

368
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:04,990
repeatedly through the internet.

369
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:07,960
There's nothing like that.

370
00:28:10,359 --> 00:28:12,259
After he converts the programs,

371
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:14,829
he just watches the live videos...

372
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,869
sent from people's webcams.

373
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:22,440
But why does each monitor
have tarot cards on it?

374
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:27,880
Adultery.

375
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:29,380
Deceit.

376
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:31,349
Greed.

377
00:28:32,849 --> 00:28:34,079
Theft.

378
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,930
Do you think he's been
watching these people...

379
00:28:43,329 --> 00:28:45,700
and waiting for them to
commit crimes?

380
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:13,859
What are you looking at?

381
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:18,799
I heard from the Executor.

382
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:23,099
You are the protector of law.

383
00:29:28,609 --> 00:29:30,109
Do you like blood?

384
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:35,809
Real justice begins from blood.

385
00:29:37,849 --> 00:29:39,119
From now on,

386
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:43,720
I'm going to run
an interesting test.

387
00:30:04,539 --> 00:30:05,609
Team Manager Kang.

388
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,750
I think I found out why Kim Min Soo
developed a mental illness.

389
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:15,519
He bought huge amounts of "Zoletil",
an anesthetic for animals.

390
00:30:17,019 --> 00:30:20,789
It's hard to buy them now as it's
classed as antipsychotic medication.

391
00:30:20,789 --> 00:30:23,460
But before, it was a drug that could
be bought without prescription...

392
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:24,490
at an animal pharmacy.

393
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:27,960
More than 90 percent of
multiple personality patients...

394
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,670
have memories...

395
00:30:29,769 --> 00:30:32,700
of sexual harassment
or violent abuse in their childhood.

396
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,609
He would have used drugs
to forget about them.

397
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:39,009
But it would have made the
symptoms worse,

398
00:30:39,009 --> 00:30:40,640
causing a vicious cycle.

399
00:30:42,279 --> 00:30:45,680
But Kim Min Soo's murders
only began recently.

400
00:30:46,279 --> 00:30:50,450
That means his symptoms
only began recently.

401
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:53,859
There must have been an incident...

402
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:56,660
that stimulated his trauma.

403
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:28,019
I think we found what caused
his multiple personality disorder.

404
00:31:46,839 --> 00:31:48,440
Aren't you hungry?

405
00:31:50,609 --> 00:31:52,920
If you're all right,
would you like some?

406
00:31:54,019 --> 00:31:56,450
Father cooked some meat.

407
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,390
Are you Kim Min Soo?

408
00:32:03,359 --> 00:32:05,430
Are you Kim Min Soo?

409
00:32:09,869 --> 00:32:11,000
Min Soo.

410
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:15,670
Who was the person
that came to me before?

411
00:32:17,509 --> 00:32:18,710
It was my father.

412
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:26,150
Did he hurt you badly?

413
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:30,319
He studied law for a long time,

414
00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:33,119
so he is very strict.

415
00:32:35,559 --> 00:32:37,259
It's all right, Min Soo.

416
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:39,529
Thank you...

417
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:41,599
for your concern.

418
00:32:46,099 --> 00:32:47,799
It tastes all right.

419
00:32:49,069 --> 00:32:50,440
Do you want some?

420
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,849
Min Soo,

421
00:32:58,150 --> 00:33:00,450
I want to ask you a favor.

422
00:33:03,819 --> 00:33:05,690
I want to eat comfortably,

423
00:33:07,089 --> 00:33:08,220
but my arms...

424
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:11,329
Can you let me go for a moment?

425
00:33:13,099 --> 00:33:14,660
My arms hurt.

426
00:33:19,099 --> 00:33:20,369
No, I can't.

427
00:33:22,109 --> 00:33:24,369
My father will scold me.

428
00:33:28,109 --> 00:33:31,710
But I will help you,
so you won't hurt anymore.

429
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:44,059
Min Soo.

430
00:33:44,789 --> 00:33:46,930
What are you doing?

431
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:48,900
Trust me.

432
00:33:49,769 --> 00:33:51,230
It will help.

433
00:33:51,769 --> 00:33:54,000
No, I'm all right.

434
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:55,740
I'm all right, Min Soo.

435
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:58,369
I don't need it. I don't need it.

436
00:33:58,509 --> 00:34:01,910
You can't tell Father about this.

437
00:34:02,549 --> 00:34:04,950
Father doesn't even know
that I have it.

438
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:08,150
No, no.

439
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:09,889
After a while,

440
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:13,289
it will feel good.

441
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:17,059
No, wait.

442
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,630
I'll make sure it doesn't hurt.

443
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:25,570
No.

444
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:46,090
You dirty witch!

445
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:49,789
How dare you trick my son
into doing this?

446
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:57,130
I will now reveal...

447
00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:01,840
whether you are qualified
to be a protector of the law.

448
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:09,409
Kim Il Ho has been dead
for approximately six months.

449
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:16,550
There's something strange here.

450
00:35:17,219 --> 00:35:19,289
There has been a record
every hour, every minute.

451
00:35:19,389 --> 00:35:21,289
"June 2, 9:19 am."

452
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,030
"If you need a kindling
for justice,"

453
00:35:24,159 --> 00:35:26,530
"you need to become one
on your own accord". Like this.

454
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,070
9:19 am, 11:25 am,

455
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:33,670
4:05 pm, 9:14 pm,

456
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,610
and 11:42 pm. It continues,

457
00:35:36,869 --> 00:35:38,840
but on one particular day,
he didn't write anything.

458
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:43,079
He could've forgotten to write
for one day.

459
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:47,579
No. Writing diaries would have been
an important job for Kim Min Soo.

460
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:50,619
He wouldn't have stopped
unless it was for a special reason.

461
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:54,019
I found out why.

462
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:57,130
"July 5."

463
00:35:59,099 --> 00:36:01,929
"Father has made a judgement."

464
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,599
"He wants to be executed."

465
00:36:06,199 --> 00:36:08,940
"I told him that I couldn't,
but Father..."

466
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:13,539
"told me to obey his judgement."

467
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,250
So Kim Min Soo killed his father...

468
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:19,949
as a result of
his father's judgement?

469
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:24,019
No, this was written
about two months ago.

470
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:28,059
It's assumed Kim Il Ho died
six months ago.

471
00:36:28,789 --> 00:36:30,130
The time doesn't match.

472
00:36:31,289 --> 00:36:33,699
He wrote the journal
as if his father is alive...

473
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,170
even though he died six months ago.

474
00:36:38,769 --> 00:36:40,269
On the day he skipped writing
his journal,

475
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:43,110
he experienced something
so traumatizing...

476
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:45,409
that he couldn't even write
about it.

477
00:36:45,739 --> 00:36:46,840
Perhaps,

478
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,980
his dissociative identity disorder
started that day.

479
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:53,849
Even after Kim Il Ho died,
he continued writing his journal...

480
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,250
with the same handwriting.

481
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:00,619
Kim Min Soo's room was messy,

482
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,559
whereas Kim Il Ho's room was
neatly organized.

483
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:08,260
It didn't change even after
Kim Il Ho died.

484
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:10,130
The owner is gone,

485
00:37:10,699 --> 00:37:12,369
but the trace remains.

486
00:37:13,469 --> 00:37:14,469
Yes.

487
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:18,039
One of Kim Min Soo's
multiple personality...

488
00:37:18,369 --> 00:37:20,010
is his father, Kim Il Ho.

489
00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:23,780
Kim Min Soo grew up under
a strict upbringing.

490
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:25,820
When it comes to right and wrong,

491
00:37:26,349 --> 00:37:28,449
he probably has a very black
and white view on things.

492
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:32,820
When Kim Il Ho said
he'll sentence himself to death,

493
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:36,590
Kim Min Soo experienced
a contradiction on his opinion.

494
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:39,900
He must follow his father's order
since he's the judge,

495
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,599
but he can't kill his father.

496
00:37:42,099 --> 00:37:45,530
So his personality spit to solve...

497
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:46,840
the contradiction.

498
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:51,940
That's when he made the Executioner
who executed his father's death.

499
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:56,849
What made the Executioner
was the rage...

500
00:37:57,050 --> 00:38:00,250
inside Kim Min Soo
after continued abuse.

501
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:05,719
He's a complete psychopath
with no human emotions.

502
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:10,329
He was moved solely
by Kim Il Ho's verdicts.

503
00:38:17,329 --> 00:38:18,869
Hyun Jun. Look at this.

504
00:38:19,369 --> 00:38:22,639
He lured people by posting online
that he'll fix computers for cheap.

505
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:24,909
After people saw this,

506
00:38:24,909 --> 00:38:27,610
they either called or contacted him
through a messenger.

507
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:30,949
There are so many people.

508
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:35,420
Can you login
with Kim Il Ho's account?

509
00:38:35,619 --> 00:38:38,889
What? You said he died
six months ago.

510
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:42,360
This system is
only three months old.

511
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:44,659
I need to find something.

512
00:38:45,659 --> 00:38:47,900
Sure. I'll take a look.

513
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:53,900
You're right. He has an account.

514
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:16,329
You said a murderer
with a sense of duty...

515
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:19,500
requires a continuous conviction.

516
00:39:20,699 --> 00:39:21,860
Is this what you meant by that?

517
00:39:22,969 --> 00:39:23,969
Yes.

518
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:28,469
The person who committed
these brutal murders...

519
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:31,840
is not Kim Min Soo, but his second
personality, Kim Il Ho.

520
00:39:41,349 --> 00:39:42,349
Hyun Jun.

521
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:11,079
Can you trace it?

522
00:40:12,579 --> 00:40:15,250
It's transmitted by the signal
inside the computer.

523
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:20,519
The IP changes every 30 seconds.
It's impossible.

524
00:40:22,289 --> 00:40:24,190
It's the message he's sending to us.

525
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:27,199
He's aware that we're here.

526
00:40:33,199 --> 00:40:34,969
All these pests...

527
00:40:35,539 --> 00:40:38,309
are criminals that are convicted.

528
00:40:38,869 --> 00:40:39,980
Choose one.

529
00:40:40,239 --> 00:40:44,280
I'll give you a chance to punish
one of them.

530
00:40:44,679 --> 00:40:45,679
What...

531
00:40:46,579 --> 00:40:47,780
do you mean by that?

532
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:56,460
Choose the person you want
to kill...

533
00:40:56,530 --> 00:40:58,630
in front of your colleagues.

534
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:04,800
Choose now,

535
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:07,900
or you'll die first.

536
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:11,210
Right now!

537
00:41:14,309 --> 00:41:15,780
"In dubio pro reo".

538
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:18,880
It means a defendant may not
be convicted by the court...

539
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:23,449
when doubts about his or her
guilt remain.

540
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:26,460
I'm sure you're well aware of it.

541
00:41:28,159 --> 00:41:29,829
What are you trying to do?

542
00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:34,360
Until you prove the crimes
they committed,

543
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,099
you can't punish them.

544
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:38,969
Prove?

545
00:41:51,949 --> 00:41:54,449
Just like how poachers hunt,

546
00:41:56,619 --> 00:41:57,889
you can't hunt...

547
00:41:58,619 --> 00:42:01,360
those who are not guilty
in the name of law.

548
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:04,460
Shut up and pick one,

549
00:42:05,659 --> 00:42:08,329
or I'm going to kill all of them.

550
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:13,039
You can never do that.

551
00:42:13,199 --> 00:42:14,500
Fine.

552
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,469
I'll prove it by killing you.

553
00:42:18,309 --> 00:42:19,510
Executioner.

554
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:38,659
Put her to death.

555
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:51,070
Hold on.

556
00:42:51,769 --> 00:42:52,809
Hold on.

557
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:55,079
I'll pick one,

558
00:42:57,050 --> 00:42:58,110
but...

559
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:01,320
let me pick who will survive first.

560
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:15,300
You'll choose who will survive?

561
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:18,670
Yes.

562
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:20,739
I'll pick...

563
00:43:22,039 --> 00:43:23,409
two people who will survive.

564
00:43:33,949 --> 00:43:35,050
The woman...

565
00:43:36,849 --> 00:43:38,289
alone on the right.

566
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:42,360
Kim Hee Ok. 42 years old.

567
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:45,429
Those who are foolish
and arrogant...

568
00:43:45,429 --> 00:43:47,400
are unreasonable.

569
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,829
It is from excessive arrogance.

570
00:43:57,210 --> 00:44:00,440
I found it. There's a record of
access in the webcam.

571
00:44:00,610 --> 00:44:04,409
Her phone number is 010-4521-4010.

572
00:44:08,119 --> 00:44:09,119
Hello?

573
00:44:09,389 --> 00:44:10,489
Kim Hye Yeon?

574
00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:13,989
I'm Ha Sun Woo from
Special Crimes team.

575
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:23,469
Now choose the person you want
to save among these two.

576
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,070
Say it.

577
00:44:28,769 --> 00:44:29,809
Who will it be?

578
00:44:31,869 --> 00:44:35,539
Who is it? Say who you want to save.

579
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:41,219
The man in the middle.

580
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:47,489
Kim Young Bae. 49 years old.

581
00:44:48,559 --> 00:44:51,829
You're not supposed to covet
what belongs to your neighbor,

582
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:55,130
but he committed a sin of jealousy.

583
00:44:58,500 --> 00:44:59,539
Good.

584
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:02,840
Since you did your job,
I'll go do my job.

585
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:03,940
Wait.

586
00:45:04,369 --> 00:45:05,539
Wait.

587
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:08,139
Besides...

588
00:45:10,110 --> 00:45:11,679
the couple,

589
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:16,590
did their two children commit
a crime?

590
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:21,389
They looked to be about
only 10 and 5 years old.

591
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:23,760
Is it because of greed?

592
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,429
They live in such a big apartment.

593
00:45:30,099 --> 00:45:31,099
Wait.

594
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,599
Min Young is aware of the camera.

595
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:39,340
If she knows we're watching,

596
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:41,010
she's sending us a message.

597
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:47,380
You think I wouldn't
know your scheme?

598
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:52,320
First, look into Kim Min Soo's
clients and find a family of four...

599
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:55,920
who live in an apartment with kids
around the ages she mentioned.

600
00:45:56,019 --> 00:45:57,030
Yes.

601
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:03,570
Goodness!

602
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:16,849
These four units...

603
00:46:17,110 --> 00:46:18,349
are families that satisfy
that condition.

604
00:46:18,449 --> 00:46:20,219
Send the police to these locations
now.

605
00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:21,280
Okay.

606
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:24,849
That scene was recorded, right?

607
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:27,159
- Yes.
- Play it again.

608
00:46:31,690 --> 00:46:33,360
"In dubio pro reo".

609
00:46:35,030 --> 00:46:36,429
It means...

610
00:46:37,769 --> 00:46:39,940
a defendant may not be convicted
by the court...

611
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:42,539
when doubts about his or her
guilt remain.

612
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:45,239
I'm sure you're well aware of it.

613
00:46:48,010 --> 00:46:49,550
What are you trying to do?

614
00:46:50,050 --> 00:46:53,179
Until you prove the crimes
they committed,

615
00:46:54,750 --> 00:46:56,119
you can't punish them.

616
00:46:58,090 --> 00:46:59,420
Prove?

617
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:03,360
Just like how poachers hunt,

618
00:47:05,389 --> 00:47:06,659
you can't hunt...

619
00:47:07,929 --> 00:47:10,030
those who are not guilty...

620
00:47:12,130 --> 00:47:13,769
in the name of the law.

621
00:47:13,969 --> 00:47:14,969
Wait.

622
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:17,309
Again when she just spoke,

623
00:47:17,309 --> 00:47:19,539
she looked into the camera.

624
00:47:21,579 --> 00:47:23,610
Poachers, hunting...

625
00:47:24,650 --> 00:47:26,650
Her words don't fit this situation.

626
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:29,449
It's also different from the way
she usually speaks.

627
00:47:30,349 --> 00:47:31,920
Maybe her message is that...

628
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:35,320
her location is somehow related
to hunting?

629
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:38,559
Identify the hunting locations
around that area.

630
00:47:38,929 --> 00:47:39,929
Yes.

631
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:50,239
(Security camera in operation)

632
00:48:04,690 --> 00:48:07,360
It's these three locations
on the map.

633
00:48:09,019 --> 00:48:12,190
It's completely surrounded
by mountains. It's too vast.

634
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:17,269
The broadcast is starting again.

635
00:48:27,239 --> 00:48:29,309
I declare the verdict.

636
00:48:36,550 --> 00:48:38,849
Those who are foolish
and arrogant...

637
00:48:38,849 --> 00:48:40,619
are unreasonable.

638
00:48:41,619 --> 00:48:44,559
It is from excessive arrogance.

639
00:48:45,789 --> 00:48:49,360
For deceiving the holy court
and committing falsehood,

640
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,230
I declare Yoo Min Young...

641
00:48:52,230 --> 00:48:55,570
to be executed exactly at 23:00.

642
00:49:00,179 --> 00:49:01,340
Yes, okay.

643
00:49:02,679 --> 00:49:05,280
They found a security camera
that filmed Kim Min Soo...

644
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:07,820
at 9:56pm near the apartment
complex.

645
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:11,489
How long has it been since this
broadcast started?

646
00:49:13,090 --> 00:49:14,489
10:13pm.

647
00:49:14,489 --> 00:49:16,829
If the CCTV taped Kim Min Soo
on 9:56pm,

648
00:49:16,929 --> 00:49:18,789
it took him about 17 minutes.

649
00:49:19,130 --> 00:49:21,500
How long does it take to
broadcast a feed like this?

650
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:25,000
Around 2 to 3 minutes.

651
00:49:25,130 --> 00:49:28,239
If this is him, and he drove
at a max speed of 80km per hour,

652
00:49:28,469 --> 00:49:30,869
Kim Min Soo should be within...

653
00:49:30,869 --> 00:49:33,010
a 25km radius from
the security camera.

654
00:49:33,610 --> 00:49:35,409
Show me just that area on the map.

655
00:49:36,179 --> 00:49:37,210
Yes.

656
00:49:42,019 --> 00:49:44,389
Identify locations within this range
that permit hunting.

657
00:49:46,690 --> 00:49:49,219
It's these three locations.

658
00:49:50,389 --> 00:49:51,460
We don't have time.

659
00:49:52,289 --> 00:49:53,900
Request for full backup.

660
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:55,360
Let's begin the search.

661
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:56,469
- Yes.
- Yes.

662
00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:12,449
Kim Min Soo,

663
00:50:13,250 --> 00:50:14,449
are you there?

664
00:50:23,190 --> 00:50:25,590
You brought me here,

665
00:50:27,059 --> 00:50:28,429
because of your father, right?

666
00:50:31,130 --> 00:50:33,840
You didn't like your dad
committing murders.

667
00:50:34,139 --> 00:50:35,969
So you called to
report the murder...

668
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:39,039
at the first murder scene
to prevent it.

669
00:50:39,469 --> 00:50:40,510
Because...

670
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:45,880
you truly love your father.

671
00:50:50,550 --> 00:50:52,090
Shut your mouth!

672
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:56,360
I'll protect you.
Get out of there, Min Soo.

673
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:58,559
I said, shut your mouth!

674
00:51:01,829 --> 00:51:05,869
Min Soo, get out of there.

675
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:08,940
Please.

676
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:16,079
Min Soo?

677
00:51:16,650 --> 00:51:17,909
Min Soo, is it you?

678
00:51:21,679 --> 00:51:23,019
Please untie me.

679
00:51:27,789 --> 00:51:29,119
I'll protect you.

680
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:31,659
Please let me go.

681
00:51:32,730 --> 00:51:34,030
Can you...

682
00:51:35,829 --> 00:51:37,900
really protect me?

683
00:51:41,139 --> 00:51:42,369
I promise.

684
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:44,369
Right now.

685
00:51:45,809 --> 00:51:46,940
Please untie me.

686
00:52:05,090 --> 00:52:06,289
Please...

687
00:52:07,829 --> 00:52:09,730
make it out alive.

688
00:52:36,389 --> 00:52:40,530
You dare deceive my son?

689
00:53:11,159 --> 00:53:14,530
He will execute the murder
in his own way.

690
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:16,500
We need to figure out what that is.

691
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:19,699
Kim Min Soo's mother passed
away when he was 10, right?

692
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:23,170
Kim Min Soo's mother...

693
00:53:24,670 --> 00:53:26,340
What was her exact cause of death?

694
00:53:26,780 --> 00:53:29,110
It says suicide in
the police report.

695
00:53:30,050 --> 00:53:32,010
But wait, there's something strange.

696
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:34,920
Apparently, Kim Il Ho said
something different.

697
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:39,150
He said she is being punished for
deceiving her husband...

698
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:40,820
and deserved to die.

699
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:42,159
What?

700
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:45,130
The officers then investigated
Kim Il Ho just in case,

701
00:53:45,230 --> 00:53:46,860
but he had a definite alibi.

702
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:49,699
They tried investigating with
homicide in mind,

703
00:53:50,030 --> 00:53:52,269
but in the end, they concluded
it was a suicide.

704
00:53:53,030 --> 00:53:54,170
Deceiving...

705
00:53:54,570 --> 00:53:56,969
Do we have the location
where she died?

706
00:53:59,340 --> 00:54:01,210
We don't have an exact location.

707
00:54:01,210 --> 00:54:03,349
It just says it's a mountain near
Hyungjoo-si.

708
00:54:05,150 --> 00:54:06,480
Wait.

709
00:54:07,050 --> 00:54:10,619
For deceiving the holy court
and committing falsehood,

710
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:12,550
I declare Yoo Min Young...

711
00:54:12,820 --> 00:54:15,090
But why does each monitor
have tarot cards on it?

712
00:54:15,559 --> 00:54:17,530
Do you see the tarot cards
on the monitor?

713
00:54:19,030 --> 00:54:20,659
Yes, I'm looking at it right now.

714
00:54:20,730 --> 00:54:23,869
Among those, what's drawn on
the card that says deceit?

715
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:26,599
A grave.

716
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:30,769
There's a grave on the tarot card
that means deceit.

717
00:54:31,610 --> 00:54:34,210
Someone's hanging from a tree...

718
00:54:34,210 --> 00:54:35,739
with a noose around their neck.

719
00:54:39,309 --> 00:54:42,349
There's a grave site on one of
the approved hunting locations.

720
00:54:42,550 --> 00:54:44,019
I'll send the address right now.

721
00:55:12,179 --> 00:55:14,579
I requested for backup, but it'll
take some time.

722
00:55:16,349 --> 00:55:17,920
We don't have time. Let's go up.

723
00:55:39,170 --> 00:55:40,239
Min Young!

724
00:55:58,659 --> 00:55:59,860
He's hiding.

725
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:04,130
He's hiding himself to ambush us...

726
00:56:04,130 --> 00:56:05,230
when we save Min Young.

727
00:56:07,969 --> 00:56:10,739
I'll go. Sun Woo, you remain
here and cover me.

728
00:56:27,889 --> 00:56:28,889
Min Young.

729
00:57:28,179 --> 00:57:31,019
Min Young. Open your eyes.

730
00:57:31,349 --> 00:57:32,590
Open your eyes. Please!

731
00:57:37,389 --> 00:57:41,929
Please save that woman.

732
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,300
My mother...

733
00:57:47,769 --> 00:57:50,139
is buried here.

734
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:54,679
Every time I look at that woman,

735
00:57:56,010 --> 00:57:59,780
I think of my mother.

736
00:58:01,250 --> 00:58:02,320
Kim Min Soo.

737
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:04,219
Kim Min Soo!

738
00:58:08,719 --> 00:58:09,820
I'm sorry.

739
00:58:10,989 --> 00:58:12,059
I'm so sorry.

740
00:58:16,429 --> 00:58:17,429
Min Young.

741
00:58:19,670 --> 00:58:21,670
Min Young, are you okay?

742
00:58:23,710 --> 00:58:24,809
Are you okay?

743
00:58:49,199 --> 00:58:50,199
Are you okay?

744
00:58:51,230 --> 00:58:52,530
This is nothing.

745
00:58:53,469 --> 00:58:54,500
I'm fine.

746
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:55,969
Good job.

747
00:59:04,050 --> 00:59:05,179
Thank you.

748
00:59:09,449 --> 00:59:10,619
It's going to be fine.

749
00:59:38,849 --> 00:59:41,380
Controversy surrounding the death
penalty has not been dying down.

750
00:59:41,380 --> 00:59:43,280
We've received an order from
the Justice Department.

751
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:45,690
It's the serial killer couple,
Jo Young Hoon and Ahn Ye Jin.

752
00:59:45,690 --> 00:59:48,619
Unidentified dead bodies have been
discovered in the yard of a house.

753
00:59:48,619 --> 00:59:51,960
It's orders to solve the case as
soon as possible as the woman...

754
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:53,960
was unexpectedly discovered when his
execution has been confirmed.

755
00:59:54,929 --> 00:59:58,070
You've been diagnosed with severe
antisocial personality disorder.

756
00:59:58,070 --> 01:00:00,969
You want to know that badly
how many more...

757
01:00:00,969 --> 01:00:02,300
women I've buried?

758
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:03,940
Stop playing games.

759
01:00:03,940 --> 01:00:07,340
The climax would be the moment
when Ahn Ye Jin is executed.

760
01:00:07,340 --> 01:00:09,210
We don't have much time.
