Were you really trying to find out
the truth,

or were you trying to hide it?

11
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:46,679
I told you to shut it!

12
00:00:47,689 --> 00:00:50,289
Are you saying there's an accomplice
among the police?

13
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:53,530
I couldn't find a trace of him.

14
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:55,990
Let me go.
I must stop Sergeant Oh.

15
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:59,560
Find Kim Hyun Jun now!

16
00:00:59,829 --> 00:01:00,969
No!

00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:03,539

Please find my daughter.

23
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,680
The three girls
all left the same text message.

24
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,480
Maybe they really did go on a trip?

25
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,120
They had an important match
coming up.

26
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,189
They found traces of the girls.

27
00:01:25,459 --> 00:01:28,260
How were three fully grown girls
taken all at once?

28
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:29,560
The abductor had an accomplice,

29
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,459
or if not, he could have waited
until they were separated.

30
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:35,769
They were found 30 minutes ago.

31
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:37,870
Someone damaged them on purpose.

32
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,209
It looks like an abduction
case motivated by vengeance.

(Episode 15)

35
00:01:47,609 --> 00:01:50,420
The police conducted a search
around where they found the bags,

36
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:53,319
but there was nothing unusual.

37
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:56,450
Is there anything suspicious about
where they found the bags?

38
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:59,859
Maybe that area
symbolizes something or...

39
00:01:59,859 --> 00:02:02,659
No, it didn't seem that way.

40
00:02:02,859 --> 00:02:05,700
If the culprit left
such a clear evidence like that,

41
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:08,270
it surely means...

42
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:11,039
that the vacant lot is
somewhere special to him.

43
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:16,009
Find out if there's any connection
with the girls and the parents.

44
00:02:16,009 --> 00:02:17,039
Yes, sir.

45

What are the jobs
of the victims' parents?

46
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:21,610
Lee Yoo Jin's parents work in
the real estate leasing service.

47
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:23,919
Park Song Yi's mom works
at a local call center.

48
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:26,750
Hong Hye In's dad owns
his own law firm.

49
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,620
The nature of a job in real estate
and law...

50
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:32,689
could bring about some unavoidable
troubles with people.

51
00:02:32,689 --> 00:02:35,289
You want me to look into that too,
right? Okay.

52
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:37,830
We couldn't find any evidence
of resistance at the swimming pool,

53
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:40,300
where the abduction likely happened.

54
00:02:40,729 --> 00:02:43,669
The girls could have easily followed
the culprit without a doubt.

55
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:47,939
The way you can overpower someone
without using any force...

56
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:50,780
is either you threaten the victim to
lose their motivation to resist,

57
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,210
or you build up
the trust beforehand.

58
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:53,580
There's no other way.

59
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:56,919
If the culprits actually
overpowered the girls,

60
00:02:56,919 --> 00:03:00,219
they must have
planned it out thoroughly.

61
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,349
They must have looked
up the girls' schedule.

62
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:05,259
They also must have
observed the girls for a while.

63
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,389
The culprit could be someone living
here or coming here often.

64
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:12,099
If an outsider was
stalking the girls,

65
00:03:12,099 --> 00:03:14,330
someone must have thought
it was very suspicious.

66
00:03:14,629 --> 00:03:16,270
It's been three days already.

67
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,069
It actually looks like...

68
00:03:18,569 --> 00:03:20,710
the girls could be already...

69
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:23,469
I don't think so.
The girls are still alive.

70
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:27,650
If you look at the message,
it specifically mentions...

71
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:30,110
that she will come back
on Friday night.

72
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:32,680
(I will come back by Friday night.
Don't worry.)

73
00:03:34,289 --> 00:03:36,750
As it has been repeatedly mentioned,

74
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:40,490
that means that day has a meaning
to the culprit.

75
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:44,960
The culprit must have chosen
Friday as the D-day.

76
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,930
We don't even have two days
until Friday.

77
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:51,139
Bring the victims' parents
to the police station...

78
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:52,939
and prepare the profile.

79
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,539
I will join you
after I tidy up some things here.

80
00:03:55,539 --> 00:03:56,669
Yes, sir.

81
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,990
I am so cold.

82
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,490
You are not the only one.

83
00:04:13,789 --> 00:04:15,330
I am cold,

84
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,860
thirsty, and hungry too.

85
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:20,500
Yoo Jin is sick.
She even has a fever.

86
00:04:20,629 --> 00:04:22,269
You need to think carefully.

87
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:26,399
Don't just stay there,
and stare into nothing.

88
00:04:28,209 --> 00:04:30,779
Your whining won't do anything.

89
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,040
Do you really need to
talk like that?

90
00:04:34,709 --> 00:04:35,980
Then...

91
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,680
how do you want me to talk?

92
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:44,790
We need to find a way
to escape this place somehow.

93
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:47,230
Being anxious won't change anything.

94
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,360
What?

95
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:52,899
You haven't even moved a finger.
You don't deserve to say that.

96
00:04:53,769 --> 00:04:56,769
Guys, we shouldn't do this.

97
00:04:57,269 --> 00:05:01,470
We're fighting against each other.
This is what he wants.

98
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:04,709
Why did he abduct us?

99
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:15,389
It seems like I'm getting numb
from the hunger.

100
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:19,360
Where are we?
How long have we been locked here?

101
00:05:19,589 --> 00:05:20,589
I wonder.

102
00:05:22,129 --> 00:05:24,199
It wasn't like this in boot camp.

103
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:26,899
I shouldn't have listened to her.

104
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,740
She's the one who talked us into...

105
00:05:31,069 --> 00:05:32,339
going to a club
without telling our parents.

106
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:41,279
Let us out of here!
Let us out of here!

107
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,410
Stop it. You're only wasting energy.

108
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:46,279
Get ahold of yourself.

109
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:50,019
We might die here.

110
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,509
What is happening?

111
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:10,610
Hello.

112
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:12,040
- He is Hye In's father.
- Okay.

113
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,480
Hello, we're from NCI.

114
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:18,680
She texted me saying
she was going out with her friends.

115
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:21,149
What is this about?

116
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:25,560
That is... At first, we thought
that was what had happened.

117
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,060
But it seems like something
has gone wrong.

118
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:31,759
So Hye In has really been
abducted?

119
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,529
I will explain everything, Mr. Hong.

120
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:39,339
As you know well enough,
Hong Hye In, Lee Yoo Jin,

121
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:41,170
and Park Song Yi went missing
three days ago.

122
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:45,579
We believe that these students
are still alive.

123
00:06:46,709 --> 00:06:49,180
If what the culprit wanted
was murder,

124
00:06:49,449 --> 00:06:53,180
they could have been killed
right away.

125
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:56,889
But as the culprit didn't kill them,
it could mean that...

126
00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:00,959
abducting them or locking them up
was more important than murder.

127
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:05,500
The culprit mentioned this Friday.

128
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:10,899
It is highly possible that
the culprit has a plan for that day.

129
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,170
We also need to focus on the fact
that there are three victims.

130
00:07:16,509 --> 00:07:19,009
There are not many cases in which
numerous victims...

131
00:07:19,009 --> 00:07:20,439
are abducted together.

132
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,410
The culprit must have had
a personal reason...

133
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:25,319
for him to abduct three people.

134
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,149
We believe that the culprit
is acquainted with the victims,

135
00:07:27,149 --> 00:07:29,920
and that he knows this town
very well.

136
00:07:30,389 --> 00:07:33,519
And seeing as the culprit
did not leave any traces,

137
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:35,689
damaged the victims' properties,

138
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:38,060
and exhibited them,

139
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,430
we think that it's highly likely
that this was caused by a grudge.

140
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,769
A grudge? But they are just kids.

141
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,910
Who would have such a grudge
in this small town?

142
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:53,540
No, we should think not only
about the victims,

143
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:56,910
but also their parents
and the people around them.

144
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:01,089
But such connections
will not surface easily.

145
00:08:01,389 --> 00:08:04,019
For cases like this,
it is highly likely that...

146
00:08:04,019 --> 00:08:07,860
the culprit is smart
and well-planned.

147
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:11,529
The culprit plans the crime
and watches the victims...

148
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:15,399
until the right moment comes
and he feels confident.

149
00:08:15,569 --> 00:08:16,899
Then he acts it out.

150

(Hong Hye In)

151
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:20,939
(Park Song Yi)

152
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:27,750
He would have prepared
a space to lock them in.

153
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:31,449
It is also possible that he could
have made a space of his own,

154
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,519
like an underground bunker or
storage to hide the victims.

155
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:37,019
What should we do first?

156
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:40,960
First, please gather information
incidents in the past...

157
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:43,629
or records that might
concern the victims.

158
00:08:43,629 --> 00:08:46,659
At the same time, I need you
to search nearby storages...

159
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:49,269
or unused buildings in this town.

160
00:08:49,269 --> 00:08:51,269
We only have one day left...

161
00:08:51,669 --> 00:08:54,840
until the D-day
that the culprit has set.

162
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:56,309
Please hurry.

163
00:08:59,409 --> 00:09:00,440
Yes, Nana.

164
00:09:00,809 --> 00:09:02,809
I did some research on the land.

165
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:06,580
It is hard to determine who owns it
as it's in litigation.

166
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,350
But until last year, it belonged to
Nam Taek Jin,

167
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:12,220
Lee Yoo Jin's grandfather.

168
00:09:13,059 --> 00:09:15,590
There was an old shopping center
on the land.

169
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:16,990
But it was torn down last year.

170
00:09:17,629 --> 00:09:20,529
But during the process,
there have been conflicts...

171
00:09:20,529 --> 00:09:22,370
with its tenants.

172
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:25,639
Thank you. Then please find out more
about the tenants.

173
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:32,210
Sun Woo, Hye In's father
has disappeared suddenly.

174
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:35,210
- What?
- After I explained the incident,

175
00:09:35,309 --> 00:09:36,809
he suddenly went out.

176
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,690
Mr. Hong, we're doing our best.
Please wait a little.

177
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:43,450
That scumbag. I will kill you.

178
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:47,159
But before he went out,
he said something strange.

179
00:09:47,789 --> 00:09:49,259
He said he'd kill someone.

180
00:09:49,259 --> 00:09:52,629
Does that mean he knows
who the culprit is?

181
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,700
Track his phone.

182
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,039
I know that strange things
have happened.

183
00:09:58,539 --> 00:10:02,809
But this is when you should get
ahold of yourself.

184
00:10:03,809 --> 00:10:05,679
I know I shouldn't say this,

185
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:10,720
but this could be a chance for you.

186
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:15,289
You should do your best,
so that you can do more for the...

187
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:19,059
What are you doing?

188
00:10:19,059 --> 00:10:22,029
- Where is my daughter?
- What?

189
00:10:22,029 --> 00:10:25,460
You pervert.
Where did you hide them?

190
00:10:26,299 --> 00:10:27,700
- You scumbag!
- Are you out of your mind?

191
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,399
- You scumbag!
- No!

192
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:30,840
- You!
- No!

193
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:36,669
Did you think I wouldn't know?

194
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:39,309
I will kill you, you jerk.

195
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,450
What is he even doing?

196
00:10:42,549 --> 00:10:44,980
Gosh, I will kill him. Gosh.

197
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:48,789
I am so thirsty.

198
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:54,889
Why am I suddenly so sleepy?

199
00:10:57,429 --> 00:11:00,629
Yoo Jin. Yoo Jin, don't sleep.

200
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:07,539
Do you remember when we ran
in the race last year?

201
00:11:08,009 --> 00:11:11,179
You caught up by 10m.
We won in the end.

202
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:14,580
That wasn't 10m.

203
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,350
It was more than that.

204
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:21,190
We called you Queen Yoo Jin.

205
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,419
What does that have to do with this?

206
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,529
We're going to die out here anyway.

207
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,330
I don't know how you can be at peace
when we are in such a bad situation.

208
00:11:34,629 --> 00:11:36,600
Hong Hye In, stop it.

209
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:38,600
What's going to happen to us?

210
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,039
Are we really going to die here?

211
00:11:42,169 --> 00:11:43,269
No.

212
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:46,039
If he's watching us,

213
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,379
there must be a way to lure him.

214
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:50,879
How?

215
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:54,820
If I had known that,
I wouldn't be here like this.

216
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:58,519
Don't treat Yoo Jin like that.
She's sick.

217
00:11:58,789 --> 00:12:01,330
Do you think I'm not?

218
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:03,289
I feel like I'm dying.

219
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:05,730
Stop it, Hong Hye In.

220
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:08,970
I hate whining people.

221
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:13,399
There are people who whine all day,
while others solve their problems.

222
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,409
I'm so sick of you.

223
00:12:23,779 --> 00:12:26,679
Hye In is scaring me.

224
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:33,389
(Motel)

225
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,470
Oh, my gosh.

226
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,620
The damaged bag...

227
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:07,419
was found in a place
related to Lee Yoo Jin's parents.

228
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:09,059
In that case,

229
00:13:10,129 --> 00:13:13,830
there must be a reason why the
victims' clothes were found here.

230
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:17,200
The culprit must be trying...

231
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,169
to disclose the secrets of the
people he seeks revenge against.

232
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,580
Thank you for your service.

233
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:29,710
Is there anyone...

234
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:32,080
who looks familiar to you?

235
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,590
Oh, wait!

236
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,759
This guy. I've seen him before.

237
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:47,669
So...

238
00:13:48,269 --> 00:13:50,570
why did he do that?

239
00:13:50,769 --> 00:13:54,370
He suddenly attacked me
like a dog in heat!

240
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:56,309
Goodness.

241
00:13:56,309 --> 00:13:59,940
I don't think you are
in a position to say so.

242
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,250
What?

243
00:14:02,649 --> 00:14:05,279
These are the pictures I found
on your computer in your office.

244
00:14:08,789 --> 00:14:10,289
How did you...

245
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:14,429
Did you search my computer
without my permission?

246
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:16,929
What did you do in the evening of
the last Monday?

247
00:14:17,029 --> 00:14:20,059
Are you suspecting me?

248
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,870
Just answer my questions.

249
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:25,399
I'm... That hurts.

250
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,669
It's not me.

251
00:14:29,409 --> 00:14:30,980
You are driving me nuts now.

252
00:14:31,509 --> 00:14:34,879
He just wanted my land.

253
00:14:37,149 --> 00:14:38,679
Why am I here?

254
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:42,620
You seem to be very sure
that the coach is the culprit.

255
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,320
May I ask you why?

256
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,889
It is him.

257
00:14:48,029 --> 00:14:50,960
He is the only one in town...

258
00:14:51,259 --> 00:14:53,100
who can do such
a dirty thing like that.

259
00:14:53,429 --> 00:14:55,029
What do you mean?

260
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:57,500
He...

261
00:14:57,970 --> 00:14:59,940
was previously
convicted of sexual assault.

262
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:04,639
According to what we found,
there's no such record.

263
00:15:05,509 --> 00:15:09,379
A few years ago, he almost got sued
for assaulting someone.

264
00:15:09,379 --> 00:15:11,250
So I helped him get away with it.

265
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:13,950
That's how he could keep his job.

266
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:17,450
I shouldn't have done that.

267
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:21,730
But I never knew
he was that ungrateful.

268
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:26,299
I was stupid.

269
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,000
How could I let him
take care of my daughter?

270
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,580
On the day your daughter
was kidnapped,

271
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:45,820
the coach has a solid alibi.

272
00:15:47,149 --> 00:15:48,149
What?

273
00:15:49,019 --> 00:15:50,490
Is that true?

274
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:53,059
You said you were gone
for three days for fishing.

275
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:54,759
I did.

276
00:15:55,129 --> 00:15:56,990
Are you sure you were just fishing?

277
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,059
What do you mean?

278
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,330
We found the girls' tracksuits...

279
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:05,539
in front of the motel
near the fishing site.

280
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:15,049
Who were you with in the motel room?

281
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:20,080
Tell me now.
Who was it?

282
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:22,620
Her name is Ahn Eun Jin.

283
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,120
She is my customer.

284
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,389
This is my private life.

285
00:16:28,389 --> 00:16:30,889
This has nothing to do
with the case.

286
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,529
Please keep this a secret.

287
00:16:34,029 --> 00:16:36,700
It's for her sake too.

288
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:45,509
We confirmed the girls' coach,
Kim Heung Sik's alibi.

289
00:16:45,509 --> 00:16:46,879
At the estimated time
of the disappearance,

290
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:49,779
the coach was treated
by some other parents.

291
00:16:49,779 --> 00:16:51,149
What's the result of
the bloodstain analysis?

292
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:55,350
The bloodstains we got from
the tracksuits are not the girls'.

293
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:58,259
At the moment, we don't have
a DNA match.

294
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:01,690
What's the result?

295
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:05,859
The police is searching around
the suspicious area now.

296
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:06,960
But we didn't hear anything yet.

297
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,430
What should we do?
We are really running out of time.

298
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:15,210
The culprit is very careful
and cautious.

299
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:16,410
He planned out every detail.

300
00:17:16,539 --> 00:17:19,640
Those two look
far different from that.

301
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,450
We analyzed all past events
related to the victims' family...

302
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:24,049
to see if anything came up.

303
00:17:24,049 --> 00:17:26,579
But we couldn't find any suspects
who had an obvious cause.

304
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,549
But the culprit left a trace...

305
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:32,390
at the place that has something
to do with the girls' parents.

306
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:37,230
What if we are heading in
the wrong direction?

307
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:39,130
That's not it.

308
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:43,029
There must be something
among the parents.

309
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:45,400
If there's anything...

310
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,109
that's common among the parents...

311
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:49,769
and if they know about it too,

312
00:17:50,309 --> 00:17:53,440
they wouldn't want to hide
anything at this moment.

313
00:17:54,579 --> 00:17:57,410
We also just saw
what Hye In's dad was like.

314
00:17:57,549 --> 00:17:59,180
That could be
something really small.

315
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:01,819
So small that they
wouldn't even think about it...

316
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:05,559
while it was something
important to the culprits.

317
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:08,130
Are the parents together now?

318
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:09,230
Yes.

319
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:10,890
Squad Chief.

320
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:14,700
Please reveal every
information little by little.

321
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,000
What? What does that mean?

322
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,500
They must be doubting
each other now.

323
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:22,670
While thinking about
saving their kids,

324
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:26,410
they must be also nervous about
the person who hates them.

325
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:28,079
Those two thoughts are coexisting
in their minds at the moment.

326
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,279
We've got to stimulate them
psychologically.

327
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:33,519
And find out
what happened in the past.

328
00:18:34,019 --> 00:18:35,220
Yes, I understand.

329
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:37,349
This is horrible.

330
00:18:38,819 --> 00:18:39,990
I'm aware of it.

331
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:43,559
I'll just pretend like
I didn't hear anything.

332
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:46,299
Can't you see how serious she is?

333
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:50,269
We are going to become
like her soon.

334
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,269
It's a matter of time.

335
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,670
There will be a way.

336
00:18:56,869 --> 00:18:57,980
Like what?

337
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,410
Did you not realize anything
after everything?

338
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:05,279
But... I don't think so.

339
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:10,349
I don't think I can't do that.
I can't.

340
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:12,259
Even though we don't do anything,

341
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:15,630
Yoo Jin is going to die first.

342
00:19:16,089 --> 00:19:17,259
Look at her.

343
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:19,630
She's almost dead.

344
00:19:22,869 --> 00:19:23,869
Just...

345
00:19:24,269 --> 00:19:27,200
think like we are saving some time.

346
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:28,670
But...

347
00:19:30,109 --> 00:19:31,240
Don't do this.

348
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:34,950
Song Yi.
You have to be realistic now.

349
00:19:35,009 --> 00:19:36,579
She is going to die anyway.

350
00:19:37,049 --> 00:19:38,680
We don't have to die too.

351
00:19:39,319 --> 00:19:40,319
Don't you think so?

352
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:41,589
But...

353
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:44,250
you want to kill our friend
to save our lives?

354
00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:47,319
We are best friends.

355
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:49,230
Do you think I want to do it?

356
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:52,960
But if this goes on,

357
00:19:53,329 --> 00:19:55,700
we are all going to die.

358
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:58,769
We don't have a choice.

359
00:19:59,339 --> 00:20:00,700
You know it too.

360
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,710
What if...

361
00:20:03,309 --> 00:20:06,079
we still cannot go out even
when we do what he told us to do?

362
00:20:07,009 --> 00:20:09,109
What if he is someone
gone completely mad?

363
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:13,180
What if he just wants to
kill us one by one like this?

364
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:16,349
Let's do
what he told us to do first.

365
00:20:16,349 --> 00:20:17,690
That's the only way.

366
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:21,660
Let's just tell him Yoo Jin's dead.

367
00:20:22,289 --> 00:20:24,329
He's been watching us.

368
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:26,029
He will find it out soon.

369
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,869
If we provoke him,
it will make things only worse.

370
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:31,769
We'll just do what he told us.

371
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:33,799
Right?

372
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:36,109
But I can't.

373
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:38,140
Are you not worried about your mom?

374
00:20:38,809 --> 00:20:40,880
Your mom's sick.

375
00:20:42,109 --> 00:20:43,180
Mom...

376
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:46,920
I'm the only one she has.

377
00:20:48,589 --> 00:20:51,619
She won't be able to live
without me.

378
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:58,059
Let's go home, Song Yi.

379
00:21:06,069 --> 00:21:07,569
We don't have a choice, right?

380
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:09,569
This is the only option, right?

381
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:12,809
You are right.
This is our only chance.

382
00:21:13,009 --> 00:21:14,440
Just think that way.

383
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,549
Yoo Jin is going to die anyway.

384
00:21:19,019 --> 00:21:21,319
We're just speeding it up, right?

385
00:21:21,319 --> 00:21:22,519
That's right.

386
00:21:29,059 --> 00:21:30,059
Sir.

387
00:21:30,759 --> 00:21:32,299
We made our decision.

388
00:21:33,829 --> 00:21:34,829
Hello?

389
00:21:56,849 --> 00:21:58,119
What's going on?

390
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:01,160
Nothing.

391
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:04,059
We will sort it out.

392
00:22:14,839 --> 00:22:16,069
My Song Yi...

393
00:22:17,309 --> 00:22:20,440
The competition she's spent years
preparing for is in two days.

394
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:24,210
What can she do?

395
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,589
My poor baby.

396
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:32,759
Hey, is the competition
even important now?

397
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:34,490
I can't believe you.

398
00:22:35,259 --> 00:22:38,730
Are you saying that money
is more important than that?

399
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:39,799
What did you say?

400
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,569
What is she saying now?

401
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:43,230
Don't get bothered.

402
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:45,470
That's all she got.

403
00:22:45,569 --> 00:22:48,039
I don't even know why
Yoo Jin hangs out with those kids.

404
00:22:48,309 --> 00:22:51,009
Are you talking about
my daughter, Song Yi?

405
00:22:51,009 --> 00:22:52,640
Did we say something wrong?

406
00:22:53,009 --> 00:22:55,680
Before knowing Song Yi and Hye In,
Yoo Jin was...

407
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:58,380
Don't do this again.

408
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:05,289
Song Yi...

409
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:13,559
Hey.

410
00:23:14,529 --> 00:23:16,630
Just say something.

411
00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:18,069
Leave him alone.

412
00:23:18,069 --> 00:23:19,670
For what?

413
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:22,740
How come the tracksuits were
found at such a filthy place?

414
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:26,809
What did you do
to cause such a situation?

415
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,880
What?

416
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:30,309
I know things are bad,

417
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:34,279
but you should think about
the things you are saying. Gosh.

418
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:37,150
I should think about what I say?
Do we need to save your face?

419
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:38,589
My daughter might die.

420
00:23:38,859 --> 00:23:41,490
Who's dying now?
I should be the one to say that.

421
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,900
How are you going to
explain the fact...

422
00:23:45,099 --> 00:23:47,400
that their bags were found
on your father-in-law's land?

423
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,430
What?

424
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:50,069
Are you blaming us?

425
00:23:50,069 --> 00:23:54,200
Maybe you are the ones
hiding something.

426
00:23:58,069 --> 00:24:01,609
I didn't want to say this,
but don't you know that...

427
00:24:01,609 --> 00:24:03,950
many people left this town
because of your father-in-law?

428
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:06,450
What? Is that all you have to say?

429
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:08,890
How can you talk to us like that?

430
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:10,190
Stop it.

431
00:24:11,019 --> 00:24:14,559
They are starting to
blame one another.

432
00:24:14,859 --> 00:24:17,289
That might be
what the culprit really wants.

433
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:21,160
He could be watching us
and enjoying himself.

434
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:23,369
We should stop them.

435
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:25,200
Something might come up.

436
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:27,470
We should...

437
00:24:29,109 --> 00:24:30,740
We should wait a little longer.

438
00:25:22,089 --> 00:25:25,559
You ignore others just because
you are a little rich.

439
00:25:25,859 --> 00:25:27,859
And you treated the tenants
really badly.

440
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,200
People in this town
are always talking badly about you.

441
00:25:30,869 --> 00:25:33,140
You guys seem like the only ones
who do not hear them.

442
00:25:33,369 --> 00:25:36,210
Did you think that just because
they act nicely in front of you,

443
00:25:36,539 --> 00:25:38,609
they really like you?

444
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:40,109
What?

445
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:42,349
You scumbag.

446
00:25:42,349 --> 00:25:43,380
Don't.

447
00:25:43,809 --> 00:25:45,619
Is that all you have to say?

448
00:25:45,819 --> 00:25:48,220
Well, you were the one
who tried to flatter us...

449
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:50,150
so that you could get
something out of us.

450
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:51,819
Flatter you?

451
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,789
You scumbag!

452
00:25:53,789 --> 00:25:55,089
- You!
- Stop.

453
00:25:55,089 --> 00:25:56,759
Stop this at once.

454
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:25,920
Fighting, blaming,
and attacking one another...

455
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:28,220
are the things that
the culprit wants.

456
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:31,059
The culprit knows you well.

457
00:26:31,829 --> 00:26:35,500
That is why he wants to attack you
and disclose your secrets.

458
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:36,970
That means...

459
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:41,670
you must know who the culprit is.

460
00:26:44,869 --> 00:26:47,740
Did you think that just because
they act nicely in front of you,

461
00:26:48,009 --> 00:26:50,049
they really like you?

462
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:51,609
What?

463
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:53,779
You scumbag.

464
00:26:53,849 --> 00:26:55,490
- Don't.
- Let me go.

465
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:57,720
Is that all you have to say?

466
00:26:57,890 --> 00:27:00,289
Well, you were the one
who tried to flatter us...

467
00:27:00,289 --> 00:27:02,190
so that you could get
something out of us.

468
00:27:03,029 --> 00:27:06,200
Find out if Mr. Hong has taken
a case...

469
00:27:06,759 --> 00:27:09,400
that concerns Yoo Jin's family's
properties...

470
00:27:09,769 --> 00:27:11,799
in the last few years.

471
00:27:11,799 --> 00:27:13,140
Yes, sir.

472
00:27:37,859 --> 00:27:39,059
All right.

473
00:27:39,799 --> 00:27:41,559
What do we need to do?

474
00:27:42,029 --> 00:27:44,599
He must be connected
to all of you.

475
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,970
Please think carefully
if there are people...

476
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:49,670
that you all know.

477
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:51,839
It doesn't have to be
a close friend.

478
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,380
You could have met by chance
or just passed him by.

479
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:57,450
If not,

480
00:27:59,079 --> 00:28:01,680
it could be someone from long ago
or something trivial...

481
00:28:01,819 --> 00:28:03,420
that you forgot about him.

482
00:28:05,859 --> 00:28:07,920
I do not think...

483
00:28:08,289 --> 00:28:11,660
that we did anything bad that
would make someone want to kill us.

484
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,130
Yes, Nana.

485
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:20,099
Hyun Jun, Park Song Yi's phone
was turned on again.

486
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,170
- Where is she?
- She...

487
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:26,440
She is within 500m radius
of Halleung Police Station.

488
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:38,519
Team Manager Kang.

489
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:45,700
Don't let the parents out.

490
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,559
There are only two girls.

491
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,900
Something must have happened.

492
00:28:50,099 --> 00:28:51,130
Yes.

493
00:28:57,369 --> 00:28:58,839
- What happened?
- Wait.

494
00:28:58,839 --> 00:28:59,910
- Yoo Jin!
- Hye In!

495
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:02,180
- Hye In!
- The case is not over.

496
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:03,380
- Please wait.
- Let us go.

497
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:05,849
- Yoo Jin!
- Is that Song Yi? Is it?

498
00:29:05,849 --> 00:29:07,049
- Song Yi!
- Gosh.

499
00:29:07,049 --> 00:29:08,319
Let us go.

500
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:09,589
Why aren't you letting us go?

501
00:29:09,589 --> 00:29:11,490
Song Yi! Is that Song Yi?

502
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:12,960
- Song Yi!
- Yoo Jin!

503
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,089
Please wait for a moment.

504
00:29:14,089 --> 00:29:15,130
Move!

505
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:16,730
Where is Hye In?

506
00:29:19,529 --> 00:29:21,299
Didn't Hye In make it?

507
00:29:47,559 --> 00:29:49,160
Where is Hong Hye In?

508
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,160
Did you...

509
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:56,230
know who it was?

510
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:12,920
You need to tell me about
the situation you were in.

511
00:30:29,769 --> 00:30:30,869
Yoo Jin.

512
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:34,400
I know it'll be hard for you,

513
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,940
but please tell me everything
you remember.

514
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:41,079
Where were you locked up?

515
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:47,250
Is Hong Hye In still there?

516
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:52,559
What happened there?

517
00:30:54,259 --> 00:30:56,289
There was nothing we could do.

518
00:30:57,490 --> 00:30:58,900
Nothing.

519
00:31:01,299 --> 00:31:06,240
You've been through something
I could never imagine.

520
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,069
Whatever happened there,

521
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:13,140
it wasn't your fault.

522
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:17,049
Really?

523
00:31:19,319 --> 00:31:21,220
Do you really think so?

524
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:33,960
Choose...

525
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:40,900
He made us choose.

526
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:46,980
Song Yi is defending herself
because of her fear.

527
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:49,980
Don't ask her about the incident.

528
00:31:50,549 --> 00:31:52,779
Start slowly with daily questions.

529
00:31:54,019 --> 00:31:55,019
Yes.

530
00:31:55,019 --> 00:31:56,420
Listen to me.

531
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:57,890
- No.
- What happened?

532
00:31:57,890 --> 00:31:59,019
- Why don't you tell us anything?
- What's going on?

533
00:31:59,019 --> 00:32:00,559
- Are they all right?
- Why don't you tell us anything?

534
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:01,559
Why?

535
00:32:01,559 --> 00:32:03,190
- Wait.
- Are the children safe?

536
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:04,789
- Tell us.
- It's driving me crazy.

537
00:32:04,789 --> 00:32:06,799
- Tell us something.
- Wait.

538
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:07,960
Hey, wait.

539
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,430
Gosh, wait.

540
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:11,170
In the alley where...

541
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,269
the girls were found,
we found a car.

542
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:16,569
We think it was used for the crime.

543
00:32:22,109 --> 00:32:23,779
- It's me.
- Team Manager Kang.

544
00:32:23,779 --> 00:32:26,150
I found some law suits
you wanted me to find.

545
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:30,289
Hong Min Seok, Hye In's father,
was in charge of...

546
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:32,990
three law suits related to
Yoo Jin's family's properties.

547
00:32:33,089 --> 00:32:36,559
But there's no one who could be
associated to this case.

548
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:39,000
These are just civil suits.

549
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:42,000
I'll send you the list of people
involved in the case.

550
00:32:42,269 --> 00:32:43,400
Okay.

551
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:51,440
These don't seem like the right
motive for this kind of crime.

552
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:54,809
It says here that Lee Yoo Jin's
parents lost these two cases.

553
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:58,410
It's hard to find connections to
these law suits with Song Yi's mom.

554
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:02,349
But there must have been a reason
for the culprit...

555
00:33:02,619 --> 00:33:04,420
to have targeted these three.

556
00:33:06,819 --> 00:33:10,589
It specifically mentions that she
will come back on Friday night.

557
00:33:10,589 --> 00:33:12,630
(I will come back by Friday night.
Don't worry.)

558
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:15,059
It has been repeatedly mentioned,

559
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:18,799
which means that day has a meaning
to the culprit.

560
00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:21,769
Unlike what we thought,
the culprit...

561
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:23,339
released two people early.

562
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:25,910
We don't know whether one
of them is alive or dead.

563
00:33:28,509 --> 00:33:29,779
What could that mean?

564
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:31,450
Some culprits...

565
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:34,019
expose themselves on purpose.

566
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:35,920
They want the police or
other people...

567
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,549
to recognize them.

568
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:41,559
Please take Song Yi's mother home.

569
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:47,660
Do you know anyone here?

570
00:33:49,529 --> 00:33:52,099
Yes, I know a couple.

571
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:54,500
We live in a very
small neighborhood.

572
00:33:54,769 --> 00:33:56,809
Is there anyone here...

573
00:33:56,869 --> 00:33:58,910
who has a connection to you?

574
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:00,140
Perhaps...

575
00:34:00,779 --> 00:34:03,250
someone whom you had
a problem with.

576
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,009
No.

577
00:34:10,889 --> 00:34:12,190
Yes, just a moment.

578
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:16,429
Team Manager Kang, I found
something.

579
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:20,329
I looked up cases where the
charges were dropped,

580
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:23,800
and I found a person who sued and
then dropped charges few years back.

581
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:25,969
It's Ji Soo Chul, 52 years old.

582
00:34:26,039 --> 00:34:27,570
I looked up his address back then,

583
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:29,510
and it was 54 Hannam-dong.

584
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:30,610
Where is that?

585
00:34:30,809 --> 00:34:32,880
It's the empty lot where
the girls' backpacks were found.

586
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:34,409
A few buildings...

587
00:34:34,409 --> 00:34:37,349
were demolished there,
and that's the location.

588
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:40,420
Besides, Ji Soo Chul has a daughter.

589
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:43,650
And she was in the sports team
in the girls' high school.

590
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:45,659
What's his current home address
and where does he work?

591
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:47,489
His address is in the other city.

592
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:51,159
There are records of him working
at a distribution center here.

593
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:53,300
But it says he quit.

594
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,869
I'll send the information
to you now.

595
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:57,369
Good work.

596
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:01,170
(Ji Soo Chul)

597
00:35:02,369 --> 00:35:03,610
Do you know him?

598
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:05,010
Yes.

599
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:07,210
It's Yeon Hee's father.

600
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,380
They lived in this neighborhood,
but they moved a few years ago.

601
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:12,179
Do you remember anything...

602
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,550
about him?

603
00:35:15,019 --> 00:35:16,719
Nothing special.

604
00:35:17,219 --> 00:35:19,820
Goodness. It's not him.

605
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:22,829
He's such a gentle and nice man.

606
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:27,159
Everyone always said that he'd
live fine without the law.

607
00:35:30,269 --> 00:35:31,269
What's wrong?

608
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:33,769
Do you remember something?

609
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:37,909
Yes, I just remembered.

610
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:40,940
You did such a poor job
managing this place.

611
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:42,480
Please, Yoo Jin's father...

612
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:44,610
consider our situation.

613
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:46,650
The sewage back flowed.

614
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:48,420
How can you have us fix it?

615
00:35:49,090 --> 00:35:51,449
You know our situation.

616
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:54,460
We haven't been able to open for
business for weeks.

617
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:56,889
Is that our fault?

618
00:35:57,559 --> 00:35:59,730
No, that's not what I mean.

619
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:02,030
Do you know how many chances
I gave you...

620
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:04,030
because both our daughters
are in the sports team?

621
00:36:04,429 --> 00:36:07,769
Do you know how many months of
rent you're backed up on?

622
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,070
If you don't want to fix it,
just leave.

623
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:12,710
Excuse me?

624
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:16,179
Please, I beg of you.
You know how we live.

625
00:36:16,179 --> 00:36:18,280
Please give me more time.

626
00:36:18,849 --> 00:36:20,750
- Miss.
- Where are you touching?

627
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:23,050
- Please. I'm sorry.
- Goodness!

628
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:24,190
This is so annoying.

629
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:27,360
Goodness. This is pathetic.

630
00:36:31,489 --> 00:36:33,130
Why are you doing that
to my dad?

631
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,599
What did he do wrong?

632
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:38,300
How dare you look at me
like that, you little girl?

633
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Oh, no.

634
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:43,570
I'm sorry.

635
00:36:45,269 --> 00:36:47,210
Yeon Hee.

636
00:36:47,809 --> 00:36:50,550
And so? What happened afterwards?

637
00:36:51,349 --> 00:36:52,519
He asked me...

638
00:36:53,519 --> 00:36:55,480
to be a witness.

639
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:57,949
And you refused that?

640
00:37:00,619 --> 00:37:03,730
I see them every day in this
tiny neighborhood.

641
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:06,599
I didn't want confrontation.

642
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:14,239
Find out where Ji Soo Chul
is now.

643
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:16,539
And see if he has a place
to lock up the victims.

644
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:18,869
Yes, I'm on it.

645
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:25,079
Song Yi,

646
00:37:25,949 --> 00:37:28,920
I heard you were a runner
until you were in middle school?

647
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:33,389
I was in the running team in
middle school too.

648
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:36,989
I woke up early every morning...

649
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:40,400
and ran 10 laps every morning.

650
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:41,900
Right?

651
00:37:43,099 --> 00:37:44,730
Your mom told me.

652
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:48,300
You were good at every kind
of sport,

653
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,340
not just running.

654
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:53,639
But she made you swim...

655
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:55,210
because she didn't want you
to get tanned.

656
00:38:02,389 --> 00:38:05,550
Your mom was here for
two days...

657
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:06,960
without getting any sleep.

658
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:10,059
She couldn't even eat.

659
00:38:10,929 --> 00:38:12,599
She said she wouldn't do anything...

660
00:38:13,429 --> 00:38:15,099
until she found you.

661
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,929
So,

662
00:38:20,969 --> 00:38:24,639
can you tell me what happened now?

663
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:30,050
It was so cold.

664
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:32,880
I was so thirsty.

665
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:35,719
And...

666
00:38:36,989 --> 00:38:39,019
I was so hungry.

667
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:42,730
You want to...

668
00:38:43,289 --> 00:38:44,929
to use this?

669
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:46,360
Don't get weak.

670
00:38:47,929 --> 00:38:51,000
This is the only way we
can get out of here.

671
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:55,039
No, I can't do it.

672
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:57,940
You can't be like that.
We already decided.

673
00:38:59,579 --> 00:39:02,239
No, I don't think I can do it.

674
00:39:02,449 --> 00:39:05,050
Song Yi, look at me.

675
00:39:06,949 --> 00:39:08,849
This is an extreme situation.

676
00:39:10,519 --> 00:39:12,019
It's just like...

677
00:39:12,349 --> 00:39:15,760
those athletes who fell from the
Andes Mountains in the movie.

678
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:18,460
They got cold and hungry,

679
00:39:18,829 --> 00:39:21,000
so they ended up
eating their friend.

680
00:39:21,659 --> 00:39:23,699
Were they murderers
from the beginning?

681
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:26,469
No, they weren't.

682
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:30,139
They were good people.

683
00:39:30,269 --> 00:39:33,409
The situation made them that way.

684
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,710
They had no choice,

685
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:37,510
just like us!

686
00:39:50,289 --> 00:39:53,699
So you killed her?

687
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,840
I had no choice.

688
00:40:06,139 --> 00:40:09,650
If I hadn't, I would have died.

689
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:15,019
Should I...

690
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,820
just have died?

691
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:24,260
What do I do?

692
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:29,570
What happens to me now?

693
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:37,170
Yoo Jin,

694
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:39,239
look here.

695
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:51,489
Four years ago, Ji Soo Chul's
daughter Ji Yeon Hee...

696
00:40:51,489 --> 00:40:54,590
was a swimmer good enough to
be featured in the local papers.

697
00:40:55,090 --> 00:40:57,260
She failed to attend an important
competition.

698
00:40:57,329 --> 00:40:59,329
Afterwards, she repeatedly
received physical therapy.

699
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:01,929
But in the end, she had to quit
sports.

700
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,929
That competition was on a Friday.

701
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:14,139
It's where they stored pomegranates,
this area's specialty.

702
00:41:14,210 --> 00:41:15,949
It's been years since it closed...

703
00:41:15,949 --> 00:41:17,809
ever since harvest's been low.

704
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:35,599
Just a moment.

705
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:46,380
Ji Soo Chul, get up.

706
00:41:50,949 --> 00:41:51,949
I...

707
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:55,349
didn't do anything to her.

708
00:41:56,519 --> 00:41:57,949
I told you to get up.

709
00:41:58,889 --> 00:42:00,960
I didn't even come down here.

710
00:42:03,429 --> 00:42:05,260
You must have heard already,

711
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:08,760
but it's all their doing.

712
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:12,699
All I did...

713
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:17,369
was telling the world what kind
of people they are.

714
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:25,150
In the end,

715
00:42:26,019 --> 00:42:29,519
they were no different from
their parents.

716
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:54,380
Miss.

717
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,679
You saw it that day.

718
00:42:56,849 --> 00:42:59,449
Yoo Jin's father pushed Yeon Hee.

719
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:04,619
But Hye In's father came to me and
said Yeon Hee started the fight,

720
00:43:04,619 --> 00:43:06,960
and it's no use suing him.

721
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,420
Does that make sense to you?

722
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:11,760
Please help me.

723
00:43:12,389 --> 00:43:14,829
This is too unfair.

724
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:19,000
Yeon Hee might not be able
to do sports now.

725
00:43:19,739 --> 00:43:22,440
What am I going to do
with my poor girl?

726
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:26,679
Yeon Hee's Song Yi's friend.

727
00:43:27,409 --> 00:43:28,480
Here you go.

728
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:30,980
Take care.

729
00:43:54,039 --> 00:43:55,969
No, that's not what I did.

730
00:43:56,539 --> 00:43:57,940
That's amazing.

731
00:43:57,940 --> 00:43:59,070
See, I told you.

732
00:43:59,070 --> 00:44:00,409
Goodness.

733
00:44:08,849 --> 00:44:09,949
Arrest him.

734
00:44:31,510 --> 00:44:32,739
Look.

735
00:44:33,539 --> 00:44:37,710
Even young girls like that killed
their friend to live.

736
00:44:38,179 --> 00:44:39,849
That's what humans are.

737
00:44:40,019 --> 00:44:41,920
We're all selfish beings.

738
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:46,119
No one cares even when a person's
life is completely ruined.

739
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:19,119
I do feel sorry for that
little girl, Yeon Hee,

740
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:21,360
but all I did was legal.

741
00:45:22,159 --> 00:45:23,789
Making him drop charges?

742
00:45:24,289 --> 00:45:26,460
It was all for Yeon Hee's father.

743
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:29,699
Why continue a case that's
sure to lose?

744
00:45:30,530 --> 00:45:33,500
But what does that have
to do with this?

745
00:45:34,070 --> 00:45:37,139
Did you find my Hye In?

746
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:42,710
No, that was just a simple accident.

747
00:45:43,349 --> 00:45:46,679
Who knew she'd barge in like that?

748
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:48,750
We suffered a lot of losses too.

749
00:45:49,949 --> 00:45:53,059
I felt quite bothered,

750
00:45:53,059 --> 00:45:56,489
so that's why I let him not pay me
the two months' worth of rent.

751
00:45:57,489 --> 00:46:01,659
But why are you asking me this
useless story?

752
00:46:02,230 --> 00:46:05,030
And why aren't you letting
my Yoo Jin out?

753
00:46:05,329 --> 00:46:08,500
I hope you're not asking
any weird questions to her!

754
00:46:08,739 --> 00:46:10,239
I did see Yoo Jin's father...

755
00:46:11,010 --> 00:46:13,239
push Yeon Hee.

756
00:46:16,349 --> 00:46:17,349
At first,

757
00:46:18,550 --> 00:46:20,380
I was worried...

758
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:23,489
things would get uncomfortable
if I get involved.

759
00:46:24,989 --> 00:46:27,659
To be honest, this is what
I thought later on.

760
00:46:31,090 --> 00:46:32,360
Without Yeon Hee,

761
00:46:34,230 --> 00:46:37,730
my Song Yi would be able to
enter the competition.

762
00:46:42,369 --> 00:46:44,969
A small hole sinks a ship.

763
00:46:45,570 --> 00:46:48,679
And a small crime destroys people.

764
00:46:49,409 --> 00:46:50,480
Vernon.

765
00:46:52,050 --> 00:46:55,679
(National Criminal Investigation)

766
00:46:58,349 --> 00:47:02,019
Everyone, how do you all feel...

767
00:47:02,159 --> 00:47:06,230
about a much needed hangout
session tomorrow afternoon?

768
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:09,230
I have to visit my mom tomorrow.

769
00:47:11,530 --> 00:47:13,670
I'm sorry. I have a press conference
in the morning.

770
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,099
Then Hyun Jun, we can...

771
00:47:16,099 --> 00:47:17,809
I'm sorry, but I already have plans.

772
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:38,030
What am I doing...

773
00:47:38,829 --> 00:47:40,260
when I'm 30 already?

774
00:47:41,829 --> 00:47:45,269
Who cares! I can eat, drink,
and live alone!

775
00:47:45,570 --> 00:47:48,070
Everyone is alone in life.

776
00:47:53,739 --> 00:47:56,880
Hey, beautiful lady drinking
cocktails.

777
00:47:57,750 --> 00:48:00,650
- Happy birthday to you
- Happy birthday to you

778
00:48:00,719 --> 00:48:03,489
- Happy birthday to you
- Happy birthday to you

779
00:48:03,489 --> 00:48:06,690
- Happy birthday dear Nana
- Happy birthday dear Nana

780
00:48:06,690 --> 00:48:08,960
- Happy birthday to you
- Happy birthday to you

781
00:48:12,030 --> 00:48:13,199
Happy birthday.

782
00:48:14,429 --> 00:48:17,369
Blow the candles, and then you'll
get your gift.

783
00:48:17,369 --> 00:48:18,469
Really?

784
00:48:18,929 --> 00:48:20,639
I'm sorry for being late.

785
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,409
A very nice man wanted me
to give this to you.

786
00:48:29,579 --> 00:48:31,010
Have I told you this?

787
00:48:31,210 --> 00:48:33,349
I'm always thankful.

788
00:48:33,519 --> 00:48:35,679
Happy birthday. Don't ever forget.

789
00:48:36,050 --> 00:48:38,090
Kang Ki Hyung is always
behind your back.

790
00:48:39,219 --> 00:48:41,219
Blow the candles. It's burning.

791
00:49:32,739 --> 00:49:35,210
Only public law shall be like water,
and justice shall flow like sewage.

Only public law shall be like water,
and justice shall flow like sewage.

793
00:49:36,949 --> 00:49:39,110
Only public law shall be like water,
and justice shall flow like sewage.

794
00:49:39,110 --> 00:49:41,550
Only public law shall be like water,
and justice shall flow like sewage.

795
00:49:41,550 --> 00:49:43,150
Only public law shall be like water,
and justice shall flow like sewage.

796
00:49:43,349 --> 00:49:44,690
Only public law shall be like
water...

797
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:49,760
(Seoul)

798
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:56,329
Did you watch the soccer match
yesterday?

799
00:49:58,130 --> 00:50:00,369
They should select players
based on how well they play.

800
00:50:00,369 --> 00:50:02,099
But right now, it's all through
connections.

801
00:50:03,139 --> 00:50:06,940
Korean soccer is done for unless
they completely switch it up.

802
00:50:07,239 --> 00:50:09,239
I still had a bit of hope for
yesterday's match, but...

803
00:50:09,679 --> 00:50:11,780
the coach wanted to switch
strategies.

804
00:50:12,210 --> 00:50:14,480
They failed in controlling and
passing the ball in the first half.

805
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:16,820
No need to even mention
their shooting.

806
00:50:23,590 --> 00:50:24,960
Do you live in this neighborhood?

807
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:33,030

Only public law shall be like water,
and justice shall flow like sewage.

810
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:41,139
What did you just say?

811
00:50:46,150 --> 00:50:48,219
What's he saying? It's irksome.

812
00:50:48,219 --> 00:50:51,150
Only public law shall be like water,
and justice shall flow like sewage.

813

00:51:04,769 --> 00:51:06,070
We're here.

815
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:08,500
What do you want to see here?

816
00:51:09,539 --> 00:51:11,610
You have to take the elevator
there...

817
00:51:12,539 --> 00:51:14,380
if you want to get to the
subway station or the sidewalk.

818
00:51:16,309 --> 00:51:18,409
Only public law shall be like water.

819
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:20,949
Justice shall flow like sewage.

820
00:51:21,050 --> 00:51:23,190
Excuse me? What did you say?

821
00:51:29,929 --> 00:51:31,630
(Vacant)

822
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:34,000
Lee Hyun Jae. 41 years old.

823
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:35,730
He was found murdered...

824
00:51:35,730 --> 00:51:38,329
in his taxi under Guwol Bridge
early this morning.

825
00:51:38,530 --> 00:51:41,840
A deep cut from a sharp tool
was found on his neck.

826
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:44,510
He died from the
excessive bleeding.

827
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:47,579
There was an anomaly.

828
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:52,849
There's a rock embedded
deep in his ears.

829
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:56,750
If you look closely, you
can see that the handle is broken.

830
00:51:57,489 --> 00:52:00,460
It looks like he attached a handle
to a rock and rammed it down.

831
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:02,659
Is it like an arrowhead?

832
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:05,230
He ground a rock to make it
into a blade,

833
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:08,199
and broke the handle, so that
he could stab...

834
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:10,070
deep into the victim's brain.

835
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:11,829
Another abnormality...

836
00:52:11,829 --> 00:52:15,000
is that the victim's
eyes were covered.

837
00:52:15,070 --> 00:52:16,639
If his eyes were covered,

838
00:52:16,739 --> 00:52:18,969
it means the suspect felt guilty.

839
00:52:19,070 --> 00:52:23,349
That depends on whether he covered
them after or before the murder.

840
00:52:23,909 --> 00:52:25,380
(National Criminal Investigation)

841
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:28,320
These are two past murders...

842
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:30,349
that have the same pattern.

843
00:52:31,750 --> 00:52:33,420
Han Ju Young, 33 years old.

844
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:36,989
She was found a week ago in her
studio apartment in Hanseo-gu.

845
00:52:38,889 --> 00:52:41,230
And this is a dentist, Kang Joon
Suk, 30 years old.

846
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:43,099
He was found 10 days ago.

847
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:44,769
The police found him in the
kitchen...

848
00:52:44,769 --> 00:52:47,800
of his vacation home in Hupyeong
two weeks after his death.

849
00:52:47,969 --> 00:52:50,309
Considering the murder
method and pattern,

850
00:52:50,809 --> 00:52:52,139
one person did all this.

851
00:52:52,539 --> 00:52:54,210
The locations are different,

852
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:56,550
and the victims have no relation
with one another.

853
00:52:56,849 --> 00:52:59,449
There's a unique murder pattern
found here.

854
00:52:59,579 --> 00:53:02,079
The local police determined that
the murders would continue...

855
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:03,849
and passed the case along to us.

856
00:53:04,519 --> 00:53:06,860
The local station didn't
find any other clues?

857
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:09,260
You'll see once you read the
initial investigation report,

858
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:11,389
but the suspect is
practically a ghost.

859
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:13,360
The murders occur in the middle
of the night,

860
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:14,730
so there is no witness.

861
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,570
And none of the security
cameras...

862
00:53:16,570 --> 00:53:20,369
near the scene picked up
any suspicious activity.

863
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:24,210
And the police has made all
details private,

864
00:53:24,210 --> 00:53:25,469
so thankfully,

865
00:53:25,469 --> 00:53:28,909
the media hasn't figured out the
connection among the three cases.

866
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:30,309
This won't be easy.

867
00:53:30,610 --> 00:53:32,480
Profiling a murderer...

868
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:35,650
who kills people without a set
criteria...

869
00:53:36,519 --> 00:53:37,920
is extremely difficult.

870
00:53:38,449 --> 00:53:41,820
Sun Woo and Hyun Jun, go visit
the victims' homes.

871
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:43,559
We'll meet up at the local station.

872
00:53:43,630 --> 00:53:44,630
Yes, sir.

873
00:53:46,699 --> 00:53:49,400
With murder patterns that exhibit
an aggressive tendency,

874
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:52,429
the killer is usually a man in his
20s to 30s.

875
00:53:52,570 --> 00:53:53,900
The murder spots were deserted,

876
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:56,400
but he committed murder
in the middle of downtown.

877
00:53:56,539 --> 00:53:58,639
He didn't leave a single trace,

878
00:53:59,239 --> 00:54:01,139
meaning he's highly intelligent.

879
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:05,280
Yes, the murders seem spontaneous,

880
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:07,179
but they're actually meticulously
planned.

881
00:54:08,449 --> 00:54:10,420
The murderer carried a weapon
around.

882
00:54:10,889 --> 00:54:13,019
And he used the same murder
weapon...

883
00:54:13,150 --> 00:54:15,420
in the same way for
all the murders.

884
00:54:18,090 --> 00:54:20,030
The fact that the murderer
covered the victim's eyes...

885
00:54:20,030 --> 00:54:21,829
means two things.

886
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:24,500
Either the murderer is unsure
of his deed,

887
00:54:24,570 --> 00:54:26,800
or he wants to hide his identity.

888
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:29,199
I'm sure it's the victim
who drove the taxi.

889
00:54:29,269 --> 00:54:30,369
Even in the initial investigation,

890
00:54:30,369 --> 00:54:33,809
they didn't find any of the killer's
fingerprints in the car.

891
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:05,769
(Vacant)

892
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:13,949
The murderer didn't want...

893
00:55:13,949 --> 00:55:16,989
the victim to see him when
he was killing him.

894
00:55:17,449 --> 00:55:19,920
He covered the victim's eyes
after the murder,

895
00:55:20,289 --> 00:55:22,219
meaning he felt guilty.

896
00:55:23,219 --> 00:55:25,789
Only the express train goes to
Guwol Station past midnight.

897
00:55:26,090 --> 00:55:28,000
And the train doesn't stop at all...

898
00:55:28,230 --> 00:55:29,800
early in the morning when the
victim was killed.

899
00:55:35,539 --> 00:55:38,010
Records say that his last
passenger...

900
00:55:38,010 --> 00:55:39,940
was picked up at Youngsan-dong.

901
00:55:40,110 --> 00:55:43,510
Youngsan-dong is a gate area to
enter Seoul from West Gyeonggi.

902
00:55:44,510 --> 00:55:47,780
There's a famous driver
restaurant street over there.

903
00:55:48,019 --> 00:55:49,420
Drivers always stop by for a meal...

904
00:55:49,420 --> 00:55:52,750
before their night shift begins.

905
00:55:55,159 --> 00:55:58,360
Then that explains how the
murderer...

906
00:55:58,489 --> 00:55:59,559
picked the taxi.

907
00:55:59,559 --> 00:56:02,059
He meticulously prepared
and planned this.

908
00:56:13,139 --> 00:56:15,210
His neck was sliced here.

909
00:56:28,059 --> 00:56:30,190
And the stone axe was rammed
into his ear here.

910
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:40,940
I'm sure at first, Han Ju Young
tried to run,

911
00:56:56,050 --> 00:56:57,320
but she was caught right away.

912
00:56:58,619 --> 00:57:00,050
And she fell here.

913
00:57:14,769 --> 00:57:17,239
He must have known the victim
would die soon.

914
00:57:17,570 --> 00:57:19,440
Why do you think he bothered
to stab the ears...

915
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:20,880
and break the blade?

916
00:57:21,010 --> 00:57:22,739
There are a couple possibilities.

917
00:57:22,809 --> 00:57:24,809
First, if you stab the ears,

918
00:57:24,809 --> 00:57:28,079
the blade can penetrate the brain
in the fastest time.

919
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:30,119
The murderer must have intended...

920
00:57:30,190 --> 00:57:33,420
to kill the girl
in the most certain way.

921
00:57:33,489 --> 00:57:34,559
It must be a compulsion.

922
00:57:36,289 --> 00:57:37,760
He attempts the murder again...

923
00:57:37,829 --> 00:57:39,960
until he can be sure...

924
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:41,599
that the victim is dead.

925
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:44,199
Breaking the handle...

926
00:57:44,199 --> 00:57:46,670
occurs from time to time in
prison stab cases.

927
00:57:46,969 --> 00:57:48,570
Once the handle is broken,

928
00:57:48,639 --> 00:57:50,510
the opponent, who's already drained,

929
00:57:50,570 --> 00:57:53,139
can't pull out the knife that's
been deeply penetrated.

930
00:57:53,539 --> 00:57:56,039
You mentioned there might be
a couple of possibilities.

931
00:57:56,139 --> 00:57:57,650
What's the other one?

932
00:58:03,079 --> 00:58:07,090
Two famous serial killers in the US,
Lawrence Bittaker and Roy Norris,

933
00:58:07,159 --> 00:58:09,690
stabbed an ice pick on the victims'
brains...

934
00:58:09,690 --> 00:58:11,260
and broke the handle.

935
00:58:11,789 --> 00:58:15,199
Afterwards, there have been a
couple of similar copycat murders.

936
00:58:15,260 --> 00:58:16,559
Then are you saying...

937
00:58:16,630 --> 00:58:19,630
he's imitating a foreign serial
killer right now?

938
00:58:19,699 --> 00:58:21,400
We can't say yet.

939
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,769
What we do know is that
the killer...

940
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:27,480
has a complex profile.

941
00:58:27,539 --> 00:58:28,610
Excuse me,

942
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:31,579
but does profiling really work?

943
00:58:33,210 --> 00:58:37,050
Profiling is only the beginning to
cut down the list of suspects.

944
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:40,690
For example, if the killer
stabbed the victim first,

945
00:58:40,860 --> 00:58:42,289
it means he wanted to...

946
00:58:42,289 --> 00:58:44,860
control the situation quicker
and more efficiently.

947
00:58:44,989 --> 00:58:46,429
The killer probably thought...

948
00:58:46,530 --> 00:58:49,599
he couldn't control the victims
with strength.

949
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:53,429
The easiest mistake to make when
considering horrendous murders...

950
00:58:53,869 --> 00:58:57,639
is concluding that the killer
is a strong, muscular man.

951
00:58:57,710 --> 00:58:59,909
Profiling refutes such errors...

952
00:58:59,909 --> 00:59:01,309
and opens up new possibilities.

953
00:59:01,309 --> 00:59:02,539
To put it simply,

954
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:04,780
the killer likely has
physical problems,

955
00:59:04,780 --> 00:59:06,550
is small-built,

956
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:09,679
and lacks confidence.

957
00:59:09,750 --> 00:59:10,920
So,

958
00:59:11,420 --> 00:59:12,920
what's the conclusion of your
profiling?

959
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:16,619
Detective Kim, he was speaking.

960
00:59:16,659 --> 00:59:17,860
No, it's okay.

961
00:59:18,260 --> 00:59:19,829
Of course you are frustrated.

962
00:59:19,829 --> 00:59:21,960
Deducing the culprit
with profiling...

963
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:24,030
requires a lot of time.

964
00:59:24,099 --> 00:59:27,340
But I am sure of this.
This murder...

965
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:30,340
was meticulously planned
and controlled.

966
00:59:30,340 --> 00:59:31,610
Considering the murder pattern,

967
00:59:31,610 --> 00:59:33,809
the killer is too
tightly controlled.

968
00:59:34,039 --> 00:59:37,079
Considering the pattern
the killer has shown us,

969
00:59:37,409 --> 00:59:40,010
you can tell it's
like an execution...

970
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:41,650
for the victims.

971
00:59:45,420 --> 00:59:48,860
Usually, the marks that appear
in these serial murder cases...

972
00:59:48,860 --> 00:59:51,489
are a unique signature that no
one can copy.

973
00:59:51,889 --> 00:59:56,059
In that sense, the culprit we are
looking for commits murders...

974
00:59:56,059 --> 00:59:59,130
because he wants to satisfy the
inner desire when committing murder.

975
00:59:59,130 --> 01:00:02,300
And the murders will continue
until your fantasies are shattered.

976
01:00:02,369 --> 01:00:03,969
In other words, the culprit...

977
01:00:03,969 --> 01:00:07,340
won't stop murdering others
until he's arrested.

978
01:00:08,710 --> 01:00:11,309
From now on, the details we find
at the murder scene...

979
01:00:11,309 --> 01:00:13,150
must be kept as absolute secrets.

980
01:00:13,210 --> 01:00:16,550
From this point on, we'll establish
Urgent Investigations HQ in the NCI.

981
01:00:17,219 --> 01:00:19,750
I ask for your cooperation to
find the killer as soon as possible.

982
01:00:19,849 --> 01:00:20,860
Okay.

983
01:00:20,860 --> 01:00:23,619
If we've profiled correctly,

984
01:00:23,690 --> 01:00:26,190
the murderer will be feared
much more...

985
01:00:26,389 --> 01:00:28,460
than your average
serial killer story.

986
01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:53,219
The culprit apparently killed
another person tonight.

987
01:00:54,889 --> 01:00:56,519
- Get out!
- Stop!

988
01:00:56,659 --> 01:00:58,630
He confessed to his murders.

989
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:01,699
This world is filled with people
who don't deserve life.

990
01:01:01,699 --> 01:01:03,829
The police can't restore
justice again,

991
01:01:03,829 --> 01:01:05,769
so they're doing things on the side
and seeming more suspicious.

992
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:09,099
You mean the murder suspect
will become a hero?

993
01:01:09,699 --> 01:01:10,769
Interpreting shorthand?

994
01:01:10,769 --> 01:01:11,909
The judge is inside,

995
01:01:11,909 --> 01:01:14,239
and he knows
the details of the cases.

996
01:01:15,909 --> 01:01:18,309
He must know that we're after him.

997
01:01:18,309 --> 01:01:20,179
There has to be an answer in here.
