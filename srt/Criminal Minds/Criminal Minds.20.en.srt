Why did I run away?

18
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,620
I realized...

19
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:01,390
it'd be a hassle.

20
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:04,700

so I can't let my parents down.

Don't be like this.

Don't be like an amateur.

36
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:51,810
Maybe other people practiced...

37
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:55,180
committing fake murder for fun.

38
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:58,680
Is that wrong? It's not a crime.

39
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,919
They didn't kill for real.

40
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,919

41
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,189
Isn't that website...

42
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:09,889
really interesting?

43
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:13,400
When I read from it,

44
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:16,699
my fingers start to tingle,

45
00:03:17,539 --> 00:03:18,699
and sometimes...

46
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:22,770

committing murder.

what it feels like...

49
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:34,349
to kill someone?

50

People will die eventually.

51
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:45,360

for people who are already dead?

53
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,969
He's not nervous at all.

54
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,469
He's aware that there's no clear
evidence to prove his murder.

55

If this continues,

56
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,810
he'll be transferred to
prosecutors for special injury.

57

keep him here.

Kang Chi Hwan's a first offender.

61

If he feels intimidated
by the surrounding,

62
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,569
he'll feel pressured
psychologically.

Do you remember this student?

64
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:48,459
You two studied the same major,

65
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:50,160
but she was recently murdered.

66
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:58,040
We operated...

67
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:00,939

68
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,740
"Journal Holmse".

69
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:06,939
I found her cute,
but then she got so clingy,

70
00:05:07,709 --> 00:05:09,480
so I stopped seeing her.

71
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:11,949
By the way,

72
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:14,019
who killed her?

73
00:05:23,029 --> 00:05:24,660
That's Ko Joon Hee we talked
about earlier.

74
00:05:25,899 --> 00:05:27,629
She's the first victim of
the incident.

75
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,540
She was
electrocuted with a stun gun,

76
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:33,810
abducted, tortured,

77
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:36,209
and abandoned at the end...

78
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:37,779
like a piece of garbage.

She's a victim of shooting incident.

81
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:51,990
There's a narrowing construction
area near Nadeulmok.

82
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:54,160
If you want to get
on the outer road,

83
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,560
you must pass this narrow road.

84
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,160
When the man selects a target,

85
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:03,069
he slows down on purpose...

86
00:06:03,769 --> 00:06:05,800
and blocks the woman's path.

87
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:10,040
The car behind gets upset,
so she comes up,

88
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,110
then the man doesn't
miss the chance...

89
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:14,379
and shoots the gun like this!

90
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:21,550
Did I get anything wrong?

91
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:25,720

pattern, method,

92

and even the after-measures.

93
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:29,730
It's all perfect.

94
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,670
How did you find the culprit's
signature?

95
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:36,930
Pardon?

96
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:40,910
It's all in the fan fiction.

97
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:43,910
I only repeated it.

98
00:06:44,139 --> 00:06:47,149
It sounds like you're admitting
your crime.

99
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:53,680
I think I told you earlier
that I'm smart.

100
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:58,360
Do you have any more questions?

101
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,029
You dimmed the light...

102
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:08,000
and lowered the temperature.

103
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:13,569
You showed me the photos of
victims on purpose,

104
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:17,709
and you continued to stay silent...

105
00:07:17,709 --> 00:07:20,339
to intimidate me psychologically.

106
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:24,579
What's wrong?

107
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,220
Did I miss anything?

108
00:07:34,029 --> 00:07:35,389
Is it possible...

109
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:38,930
to lower the temperature more?

110
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:41,730
I have a lot of heat in my body.

111
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:45,069
My brain works better...

112
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,970
when my head is cold.

113
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:52,939
Left-handed and tall.

114
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:56,379
He matches the suspect's appearance
caught on the surveillance camera.

115
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:59,180
He took the same lectures
with Ko Joon Hee,

116
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,689
and they joined the same club.

117
00:08:01,019 --> 00:08:02,819
They're administrators of
the fan fiction club.

118
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:06,060
Above all, on the day
the murder notice was posted,

119
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,889
he abducted Son Na Kyung
as what's written in the posting.

120
00:08:09,259 --> 00:08:10,959
Do we still need more evidence?

121
00:08:11,129 --> 00:08:14,300
Without a conclusive evidence,
we can't imprison him for murder.

122
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,930
The problem is...

123
00:08:16,569 --> 00:08:18,500
the website closed down...

124
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,540
because the information leaked.

125
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,079
I can't trace the club members
anymore.

126
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:26,540
I'm sure they moved the website...

127
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:28,750
instead of closing it.

128
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:30,980
Now that he's on it again,

129
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:33,889
he'll never stop.

130
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:46,330
(The Night Reaper)

131
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,539
(The Night Reaper)

132
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:14,990
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

133
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:17,360
Have you seen this person?

134
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,730
No, I haven't.

135
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,129
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

136
00:09:23,169 --> 00:09:25,370
Have you seen this person?

137
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:28,269
No, I haven't.

138
00:09:47,789 --> 00:09:48,830
Mother.

139
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,590
I...

140
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:54,200
can't get hold of Seo Young
for two days now.

141
00:09:54,429 --> 00:09:55,429
Yes.

142
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,799
We had a fight preparing
for the wedding,

143
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,870
but I could always get hold of her.

144
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:06,009
Don't you think I should
tell Father?

145
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:08,009
We need more time.

146
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:11,779
I know what you mean,

147
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:15,350
but solving the case is more
important than justifying oneself.

148
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:23,129
Trust me.

149
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:25,000
I will solve this.

150
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:34,110
We have some breaking news.
We're shocked to hear...

151
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:36,870
that during the chase that happened
in the middle of the town...

152
00:10:36,909 --> 00:10:39,340
as NCI was trying arrest
a suspect of an abduction case,

153
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:43,210
three citizens were hit by a car
and were hospitalized.

154
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:07,440
It's like we're on a pilgrimage.

155
00:11:08,309 --> 00:11:09,940
These are the traces of the Reaper.

156
00:11:11,779 --> 00:11:14,379
- This is the place.
- Look.

157
00:11:14,379 --> 00:11:18,049
(The Night Reaper)

158
00:11:18,049 --> 00:11:21,149
Guys, isn't this place
a little scary?

159
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,250
Really?

160
00:11:40,669 --> 00:11:43,639
These stories were kept secret, but
people started adding more to them.

161
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:46,379
It's hard to find the person
who wrote it first.

162
00:11:46,379 --> 00:11:49,049
The original site was closed down,
but people are making...

163
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,549
more and more similar websites
after this case became well-known.

164
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:55,490
It seems unlikely that we'd find
anything through the internet.

165
00:11:56,019 --> 00:11:58,919
If we can't stop the supporters,

166
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:02,590
many more of
Kang Chi Hwan will appear.

167
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:04,360
That could be the chaos...

168
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,129
that the Reaper wants.

169
00:12:11,139 --> 00:12:14,139
There have been superiors' orders
to abort the investigation.

170
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:16,340
From now on,

171
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:19,980
regional investigation unit
will be in charge.

172
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,309
All right?

173
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:25,419
The superiors seem to believe that
the fact that NCI is in charge...

174
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:29,320
could only stimulate
the culprits of this case.

175
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:33,519
As you may already know, the public
already has a negative view...

176
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,090
on this team,
and it could worsen.

177
00:12:35,289 --> 00:12:38,730
Chief Director Baek,
the Reaper is after us.

178
00:12:38,929 --> 00:12:41,929
Are you asking us
to step out in such a situation?

179
00:12:42,129 --> 00:12:43,830
This is an order,
so proceed accordingly.

180
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:46,399
Do you understand,
Team Manager Kang?

181
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:33,549
What? On Chief Manager Baek?

182
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:50,200
Team Manager Kang,
you should take a look at this.

183
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:52,470
Someone uploaded a strange writing
on the bulletin board.

184
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,639
Here.

185
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:54,909
(NCI Bulletin Board)

186
00:13:56,309 --> 00:13:57,879
(The woman was looking at a building
with so many windows.)

187
00:14:03,379 --> 00:14:05,080
(NCI Bulletin Board)

188
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,850
Someone could be...

189
00:14:08,049 --> 00:14:10,120
leaving us a message.

190
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,559
(The woman was looking at a building
with so many windows.)

191
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:19,500
"The woman was looking at a building
with so many windows."

192
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,429
"I will die here."

193
00:14:21,529 --> 00:14:23,629
"If possible,
I want it to be today."

194
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,100
"I hope you are the one
that kills me."

195
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:30,669
I think the style
has gotten a little different.

196
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:33,779
Until now, the stories have
directly described the murders.

197
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:36,879
But this one is indirectly
predicting a murder.

198
00:14:39,549 --> 00:14:42,820
A woman who is asleep.
A drowsy sunlight.

199
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:46,220
It's describing an afternoon.

200
00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:50,360
And there are passersby
and a bus stop.

201
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:53,460
People without facial expressions.

202
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:57,669
Team Manager Kang,
near the bus stop 271,

203
00:14:57,799 --> 00:14:59,700
there's a department store
with a clock tower.

204
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,840
In front of the store, there's
a crosswalk and an intersection.

205
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:13,320
It's describing the road we were
hiding to catch Kang Chi Hwan.

206
00:15:15,549 --> 00:15:16,690
The Reaper.

207
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:19,919
This must be the Reaper's writing.

208
00:15:21,429 --> 00:15:23,730
Son Na Kyung is hospitalized
at Seojin Hospital.

209
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:25,230
Yes.

210
00:15:27,129 --> 00:15:30,000
Team Manager Kang, I found out
where the chief director is.

211
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,000
He's at Seojin Hospital.

212
00:15:39,309 --> 00:15:41,980
The number you have dialed
is not available at this moment.

213
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:44,519
The chief director is not answering
my calls.

214
00:16:02,029 --> 00:16:03,269
Where am I supposed to go to?

215
00:16:25,659 --> 00:16:28,559
What do you want me to do?

216
00:16:28,929 --> 00:16:31,529
Why? Are you disappointed...

217
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,059
that it's not your daughter?

218
00:16:35,129 --> 00:16:36,529
Where is she?

219
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:39,000
If you really want to see her,

220
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:41,610
I'll let you see her.

221
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:06,359
How do you like it?

222
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:09,299
Now, if you want to
save your daughter,

223
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:12,170
kill the woman next to you.

224
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:16,069
What's wrong?

225
00:17:16,609 --> 00:17:19,710
Isn't your family the one thing
that you are afraid of losing?

226
00:17:20,309 --> 00:17:22,349
If you want something from me,
let's meet up.

227
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:24,720
Please.

228
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:26,980
Don't do anything to her.

229
00:17:27,549 --> 00:17:29,519
Are you begging me?

230
00:17:32,589 --> 00:17:34,160
Gosh, you guys.

231
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:38,599
Why is everything so complicated
with you guys?

232
00:17:39,859 --> 00:17:41,670
Your family is dying.

233
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:44,029
To save your daughter,

234
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,339
kill her.

235
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,109
Kim Yong Chul,

236
00:17:48,869 --> 00:17:50,970
you've got this the wrong way.

237
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:54,480
If you just do as I tell you,
I'll let your daughter go.

238
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:57,849
You have only once chance.

239
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:01,519
Do you see the drawer?

240
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:05,089
Open it.

241
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,940
Pick the scalpel up.

242
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,339
You know what to do.

243
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:34,789
Don't hesitate,
and kill her at once.

244
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:40,619
Son Na Kyung. Son Na Kyung.

245
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:44,150
I called the Chief Director's
house...

246
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:46,190
and found out that his daughter
has been missing for days.

247
00:19:49,089 --> 00:19:51,599
The Reaper must have abducted
his daughter to threaten him.

248
00:19:52,299 --> 00:19:55,069
He's using the same method
that he had used on me.

249
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,880
Track Chief Director Baek's car.

250
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:25,630
(National Criminal Investigation)

251
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,029
There's another posting
on the bulletin board.

252
00:20:28,099 --> 00:20:30,500
(Near Route 27, a quiet cafe
with a view of the lake.)

253
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:34,000
"Near Route 27,"

254
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,609
"a quiet cafe
with a view of the lake."

255
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:10,539
Why did you come so late?

256
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:12,940
I already had two cups of coffee.

257
00:21:13,539 --> 00:21:14,539
Kim Yong Chul.

258
00:21:15,349 --> 00:21:16,549
Where is Chief Director Baek?

259
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,950
Why are you in such a hurry?

260
00:21:19,849 --> 00:21:22,089
Don't just stand there. Take a seat.

261
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:24,720
There must be a lot of things
you'd like to hear from me.

262
00:21:24,859 --> 00:21:26,420
Don't think about
doing anything stupid.

263
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:28,990
Kang Ki Hyung.

264
00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:32,230
Your pet is rather noisy.

265
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:35,470
You won't be able to step out
of this room.

266
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:39,700
Do you want to make a bet?

267
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,210
Let's see if I can just walk out
of this room in 10 minutes or not.

268
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,000
Kim Yong Chul,

269
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,069
I understand your pain.

270
00:22:09,529 --> 00:22:13,339
But you do not know
what pain is like...

271
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:17,039
because you can't feel anything.

272
00:22:18,809 --> 00:22:21,450
You even killed people
that the society doesn't care about,

273
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:23,480
that are without rights,

274
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,119
and forgotten by others.

275
00:22:26,119 --> 00:22:29,450
You murdered such people.

276
00:22:30,789 --> 00:22:32,859
That's your problem.

277
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:35,789
Can't you think simply?

278
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:41,299
Chief Director Baek San
understood me.

279
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:43,470
But then,

280
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:47,339
he's the type that pushes his luck.

281
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,990
I told you.

282
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:05,460
I'll get to walk out of here
on my own accord.

283
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:08,430
But don't you want to know...

284
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:11,799
what's inside the bag that belongs
to a psychopath?

285
00:23:12,329 --> 00:23:13,400
What is this?

286
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:19,200
This is my ticket
to get me out of here.

287
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,420
Are you disappointed...

288
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:43,630
that it's Son Suk Ju,
and not Baek San?

289
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:46,529
You psychopath!

290
00:23:46,529 --> 00:23:48,299
Wait, wait.

291
00:23:51,539 --> 00:23:54,000
I have something I have to check on.

292
00:23:57,869 --> 00:23:59,279
It's breaking news.

293
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:03,650
A shocking report has come in
to YTB News.

294
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:07,220
The anonymous informer sent us
a video...

295
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:09,789
of five youths being confined.

296
00:24:09,789 --> 00:24:12,690
He claimed that if the students
are not rescued in time,

297
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:15,359
all of them will die.

298
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:18,160
According to an expert analysist...

299
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,829
Let's see how much time
we have left.

300
00:24:20,829 --> 00:24:22,029
It was confirmed.

301
00:24:24,299 --> 00:24:26,539
Shall we start over again?

302
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:31,509
We're getting countless calls
at the studio...

303
00:24:31,509 --> 00:24:33,980
from the viewers that just watched
the breaking news.

304
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:36,480
It is said that a child
of a powerful politician...

305
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,750
is among the five hostages,

306
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:40,779
making the situation even bigger.

307
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:45,819
Should we make a move first?

308
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,160
No.

309
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:49,690
Stand by for now.

310
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:51,190
Okay.

311
00:24:54,599 --> 00:24:55,599
Yes?

312
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,500
The situation doesn't look good.

313
00:24:58,069 --> 00:24:59,369
We're trapped in here!

314
00:24:59,369 --> 00:25:01,470
- Save us!
- Help!

315
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,210
- Help us!
- Help!

316
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:08,579
Help!

317
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,349
Help!

318
00:25:11,349 --> 00:25:13,650
- Help.
- Hurry...

319
00:25:14,779 --> 00:25:15,789
Move.

320
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:18,960
Move.

321
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:27,930
Well, Kang Ki Hyung.

322
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:31,839
Do you feel like talking now?

323
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,440
Tell me.

324
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:36,769
What is it that you want?

325
00:25:43,849 --> 00:25:46,079
He wants to go
in Team Manager Kang's car.

326
00:25:46,519 --> 00:25:49,650
He'll tell us where the kids are...

327
00:25:49,789 --> 00:25:51,119
once we get to the place he wants.

328
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:53,220
He might have a scheme.

329
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:55,190
The kids' lives are at stake.

330
00:25:55,259 --> 00:25:56,329
Just do as he tells us.

331
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:58,089
Team Manager Kang
could be put in danger.

332
00:25:58,089 --> 00:25:59,299
Just go with it for now.

333
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,299
Get the best agents
to follow them as a backup.

334
00:26:24,619 --> 00:26:27,059
Nice shot, Chief Commissioner.

335
00:26:38,069 --> 00:26:40,170
If you make a rash move,

336
00:26:40,299 --> 00:26:42,839
the kids might die. Remember that.

337
00:26:47,079 --> 00:26:48,180
Let's go.

338
00:26:57,589 --> 00:27:00,119
I'll contact you soon,
so please be on standby.

339
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:01,119
I will.

340
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:09,269
Nana, please trace a vehicle for me.

341
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:17,539
Chief Director Baek is a human,
just like you.

342
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:21,410
He acted all noble
and well-mannered,

343
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:24,609
but he lost his head
when it came to his family.

344
00:27:24,609 --> 00:27:26,519
Is that the only thing...

345
00:27:26,849 --> 00:27:28,119
you can do?

346
00:27:30,289 --> 00:27:32,259
You will never beat me.

347
00:27:32,819 --> 00:27:35,230
You'll end up accepting my offer.

348
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:39,799
You mentioned about the fire
at the mental hospital, right?

349
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:43,730
There's a part you omitted.

350
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:49,170
Aren't you curious
how delighted I was...

351
00:27:49,309 --> 00:27:52,779
while watching the people
struggling to survive in the fire?

352
00:27:53,509 --> 00:27:54,779
Don't worry.

353
00:27:55,009 --> 00:27:57,049
You'll get to
experience it yourself soon.

354
00:28:04,119 --> 00:28:05,490
Turn right.

355
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:10,160
Go straight.

356
00:28:20,369 --> 00:28:21,599
Where did the car go?

357
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:31,380
Hold on, Hyun Jun.

358
00:28:32,349 --> 00:28:34,019
Team Manager Kang's car disappeared.

359
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:36,890
From where they disappeared...

360
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:39,160
to underground passages
and tunnels,

361
00:28:39,559 --> 00:28:42,730
I'm searching for areas
that could lose signals.

362
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,630
But it's been a while
since I lost the signal.

363
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:48,799
I think they're going through
this underground passage.

364
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:50,299
Where could
this underground passage...

365
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:53,700
link to
that also do not have signals?

366
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,470
There are three possibilities.

367
00:28:57,369 --> 00:28:59,240
The closest one is...

368
00:29:03,349 --> 00:29:05,150
It's Baejae Tunnel.

369
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,549
It's close to where you are.

370
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:15,059
Okay, that's enough driving.

371
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,009
On top of the tunnel entrance
on a hill,

372
00:29:30,009 --> 00:29:32,509
there is a storage covered with ivy.

373
00:29:33,079 --> 00:29:35,309
It's a meaningful place for me.

374
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:37,849
Let's look at the time.

375
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,650
You have about five minutes.

376
00:29:42,289 --> 00:29:43,450
You better hurry.

377
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,130
It's too bad we're parting ways
like this,

378
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:55,369
but I'm sure we'll meet again.

379
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:17,619
He walked out that way.

380
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:20,359
I'll go check on the children.
Go chase the Reaper.

381
00:30:20,359 --> 00:30:21,359
Yes, sir.

382
00:31:26,789 --> 00:31:27,920
Help me.

383
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:48,210
Please.

384
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:49,680
Help me.

385
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:00,460
Wake up.

386
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:02,759
Am I going to die?

387
00:32:05,059 --> 00:32:06,200
Hurry up.

388
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,230
Hurry up.

389
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:37,230
It looks like liquid smoke
used for special effect.

390
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:41,160
Fortunately, it's harmless.

391
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:46,400
The Reaper expected the children...

392
00:32:46,599 --> 00:32:48,839
to feel fear in a closed space,

393
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:51,970
and that they'll fight
against themselves.

394
00:33:31,779 --> 00:33:34,349
You guys always do this.

395
00:34:42,219 --> 00:34:43,349
Help me.

396
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:45,920
Help me.

397
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:48,389
Help me.

398
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,159
Help me.

399
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,230
Seo Young.

400
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,699
Help me.

401
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:56,300
Seo Young.

402
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:58,170
Dad. Dad.

403
00:35:06,809 --> 00:35:07,880
Dad.

404
00:35:08,949 --> 00:35:10,010
Dad.

405
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:12,179
Seo Young.

406
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:14,550
- Dad.
- Seo Young.

407
00:35:15,719 --> 00:35:16,789
Seo Young.

408
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:19,489
Seo Young.

409
00:35:23,829 --> 00:35:24,889
Dad.

410
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:30,099
Dad. I'm scared.

411
00:35:35,539 --> 00:35:39,210
Let's go home now, Seo Young.

412
00:35:39,639 --> 00:35:40,710
Let's go home.

413
00:35:51,389 --> 00:35:52,460
Seo Young.

414
00:35:53,219 --> 00:35:54,590
You go first.

415
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:57,329
I'll catch up with you. Hurry.

416
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:10,340
Get out, Seo Young. Hurry.

417
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:56,889
Okay.

418
00:37:11,269 --> 00:37:12,369
Dad...

419
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:14,400
What about my dad?

420
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:17,010
We searched every old building...

421
00:37:18,739 --> 00:37:20,079
within the radius of 4km...

422
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:23,179
from where you were found.

423
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:28,650
I'll...

424
00:37:30,489 --> 00:37:31,889
find Chief Director for sure.

425
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:39,059
I got out alone. Alone.

426
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,670
Please save my dad.

427
00:37:43,969 --> 00:37:45,739
Please save my dad.

428
00:37:45,739 --> 00:37:47,639
Please find my dad.

429
00:37:49,409 --> 00:37:51,739
Please find my dad.

430
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:56,880
Where...

431
00:37:57,849 --> 00:37:59,679
should we start?

432
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:03,550
We can't catch him with
a usual investigation method.

433
00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:05,760
He was aware of tracking...

434
00:38:05,989 --> 00:38:09,190
that he erased his trace completely
as he moved.

435
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:10,929
I know it's the Reaper,

436
00:38:11,559 --> 00:38:14,159
but I can't believe
he can do all this alone.

437
00:38:14,699 --> 00:38:16,300
There must be another follower.

438
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:18,869
To get him,

439
00:38:19,269 --> 00:38:21,840
we must do exactly
what the Reaper did,

440
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:23,909
and attract his followers.

441
00:38:24,309 --> 00:38:27,110
We'll be able to attract the Reaper
that way.

442
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:30,210
I'm sure...

443
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,349
he watched everything at the site.

444
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:38,190
Team Manager Kang.
There's a video delivered to you.

445
00:38:39,059 --> 00:38:40,090
Play it.

446
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:09,590
What do you think?

447
00:39:10,449 --> 00:39:11,849
Do you like this one?

448
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:14,519
I think...

449
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,730
that's enough to make a good deal.

450
00:39:17,989 --> 00:39:19,260
What do you want?

451
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:21,829
You know what I want.

452
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:25,230
It's simple. Give up on that boy,

453
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:27,739
and tell the world...

454
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,210
that you'll stop chasing after me.

455
00:39:30,409 --> 00:39:31,769
That you have lost.

456
00:39:32,010 --> 00:39:33,440
That you'll give up now.

457
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:37,079
If you give up on your petty pride,

458
00:39:37,909 --> 00:39:40,150
Chief Director Baek will survive,

459
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:43,650
and I'll never appear again.

460
00:39:45,489 --> 00:39:48,789
Don't you think
it's a pretty good deal?

461
00:39:50,829 --> 00:39:52,230
I've told you already.

462
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:56,469
I don't make a deal
with a jerk like you.

463
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:01,039
Is your belief or justice
that important?

464
00:40:01,969 --> 00:40:06,179
Only novices care about such things
when someone's life...

465
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,710
is at risk.

466
00:40:09,579 --> 00:40:10,579
Kim Yong Chul,

467
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:13,380
we'll arrest you soon.

468
00:40:14,619 --> 00:40:15,679
Kang Ki Hyung,

469
00:40:16,849 --> 00:40:20,460
the needle in your pocket
will stab you soon...

470
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:23,329
unless you get rid of
your arrogant behavior.

471
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,960
You will never win at this game.

472
00:40:26,329 --> 00:40:27,429
Never.

473
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:33,139
Zoom in.

474
00:40:36,139 --> 00:40:38,210
Find me some personal details
on him.

475
00:40:39,909 --> 00:40:41,679
And find out the number
of the patrol car.

476
00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:44,050
Sir.

477
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:49,050
Someone helped him at the church
where the third murder happened.

478
00:40:49,289 --> 00:40:50,750
It could have been the Reaper.

479
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:54,989
The Reaper wanted to
destroy our team in the first place.

480
00:40:56,090 --> 00:40:59,130
That means the murders
had to be enacted...

481
00:40:59,199 --> 00:41:01,630
just the way it was written
in the fan fiction novels.

482
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:05,599
These criminals had even planned
the time of the murder.

483
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,599
That means it was important...

484
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:11,539
for them to know when we were
going to find the bodies.

485
00:41:14,309 --> 00:41:16,079
Do you have anything in mind?

486
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:23,849
It's not the Reaper.

487
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,260
The person that found Ko Joon Hee's
body in the first case.

488
00:41:30,429 --> 00:41:31,489
Do you remember him?

489
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:34,059
I'm Choi Hyun Jin. I work
in the Female and Youth Division.

490
00:41:34,059 --> 00:41:35,500
(Root of Evil)

491
00:41:35,699 --> 00:41:37,400
We found it on the scene.

492
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:40,570
Are you talking about
Detective Choi?

493
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:48,380
He's not just a supporter.

494
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:55,119
He was engaged to the Reaper's
seventh victim,

495
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:57,420
Han Ji Won.

496
00:41:58,789 --> 00:42:02,460
You're saying that he was the one
that waited at the scene...

497
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:04,929
for the Reaper to appear,
and helped...

498
00:42:04,929 --> 00:42:06,500
Kang Chi Hwan.

499
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:09,929
He's been acting as his supporter,

500
00:42:09,929 --> 00:42:12,599
so that he could get his revenge
on his fiancee.

501
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:13,599
We're exposed.

502
00:42:18,039 --> 00:42:22,480
(The Night Reaper)

503
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:17,159
Team Manager Kang, I have something.

504
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:21,329
A car behind the container
has started to move.

505
00:44:21,630 --> 00:44:22,800
Keep an eye on the car.

506
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,469
- Stay still.
- Let me go.

507
00:44:27,369 --> 00:44:29,039
You can't catch the Reaper.

508
00:44:29,039 --> 00:44:32,070
You can't catch him
with your weak ways.

509
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:38,179
Shut your mouth.

510
00:44:38,809 --> 00:44:41,179
Although you blame it
on the Reaper,

511
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,090
you're just another murderer.

512
00:44:43,090 --> 00:44:45,619
Don't kid yourself.
I'm going to kill him myself.

513
00:44:45,619 --> 00:44:47,190
Get a hold of yourself,
Choi Hyun Jin.

514
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:50,530
The Reaper already knew who you are.

515
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:53,360
He just played you.

516
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:06,679
Yes, sir.

517
00:45:06,909 --> 00:45:09,679
He was watching us nearby
as we expected.

518
00:45:10,150 --> 00:45:12,920
I'll follow him first.
You should come right away too.

519
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:17,420
I'm tracking him
through the security footage.

520
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:19,690
The backup forces are waiting
at the headquarters.

521
00:45:40,579 --> 00:45:42,039
This is where...

522
00:45:42,610 --> 00:45:45,780
the mental hospital that
Kim Yong Chul set on fire had stood.

523
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:49,349
He came back to the place
where all his pains have started.

524
00:45:49,590 --> 00:45:51,119
Do you think...

525
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:53,860
he didn't know that we were
after Choi Hyun Jin?

526
00:45:54,889 --> 00:45:57,159
Just like we were always
tracking him down,

527
00:45:57,889 --> 00:46:00,460
he would have been watching us.

528
00:46:01,130 --> 00:46:02,800
What if he had wanted us...

529
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:04,829
to come here?

530
00:46:04,829 --> 00:46:07,440
He would try to end everything here.

531
00:46:08,070 --> 00:46:09,469
The chief director is in danger.

532
00:48:07,519 --> 00:48:09,090
I think he just left the room.

533
00:48:46,329 --> 00:48:47,329
Chief Director Baek!

534
00:48:49,829 --> 00:48:50,869
Kim Hyun Jun.

535
00:48:51,369 --> 00:48:52,400
Step back.

536
00:48:58,969 --> 00:49:00,079
Kim Yong Chul.

537
00:49:02,539 --> 00:49:03,780
Stop fooling around.

538
00:49:18,190 --> 00:49:20,730
You're too uptight.

539
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:32,639
What is it? Was it not fun?

540
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:34,309
Where is our chief director?

541
00:49:35,210 --> 00:49:36,780
Tell us
before I shoot off your head.

542
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:41,920
If you kill me now,
you'll never find him.

543
00:49:42,449 --> 00:49:44,650
Don't put up a show,
and just tell me.

544
00:49:44,889 --> 00:49:46,690
He won't be able to last long.

545
00:49:47,659 --> 00:49:50,329
He's in bad shape right now.

546
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:51,989
All right.

547
00:49:53,630 --> 00:49:54,860
What's next?

548
00:49:57,530 --> 00:49:59,840
Put the guns down first
before we talk.

549
00:50:00,699 --> 00:50:02,769
Then we can start negotiating.

550
00:50:14,650 --> 00:50:16,889
Kang Ki Hyung, this is your chance.

551
00:50:18,190 --> 00:50:19,719
If you really want to kill me,

552
00:50:20,590 --> 00:50:22,190
shoot me now.

553
00:50:23,690 --> 00:50:25,730
Do you want me to kill you?

554
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:27,929
I thought that's what you wanted.

555
00:50:30,670 --> 00:50:32,099
Shoot me, Kang Ki Hyung.

556
00:50:34,039 --> 00:50:37,070
If you don't shoot me now,
you'll regret it forever.

557
00:50:39,139 --> 00:50:40,340
I told you...

558
00:50:41,210 --> 00:50:43,210
that you and I are the same sort.

559
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:47,820
Of course you'd deny it.

560
00:50:48,849 --> 00:50:50,150
Shut your mouth.

561
00:50:51,989 --> 00:50:54,059
How is that young police doing?

562
00:50:55,019 --> 00:50:58,030
He had such black eyes.

563
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:01,400
Every time I kill someone
with eyes like that,

564
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:03,599
my heart races.

565
00:51:04,269 --> 00:51:06,199
If I kill that young police...

566
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:09,170
and rip him to pieces
in front of you...

567
00:51:09,170 --> 00:51:10,340
Don't move!

568
00:51:11,369 --> 00:51:12,440
Shoot me.

569
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:15,480
Go ahead.

570
00:51:44,739 --> 00:51:45,940
Tell us.

571
00:51:47,079 --> 00:51:48,409
Where is he?

572
00:52:13,239 --> 00:52:14,340
You jerk!

573
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:15,800
Calm down.

574
00:52:18,139 --> 00:52:19,239
Open it.

575
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:22,179
It might not be what you expected
to see.

576
00:52:42,599 --> 00:52:44,070
It's only a start.

577
00:52:58,849 --> 00:52:59,949
Now,

578
00:53:00,849 --> 00:53:03,019
prove to yourselves...

579
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:05,489
how evil human beings can be.

580
00:53:16,329 --> 00:53:17,369
Sir.

581
00:53:37,590 --> 00:53:39,090
An instinct to survive...

582
00:53:39,719 --> 00:53:42,090
is a common instinct to all animals.

583
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:46,699
All humans are animals,
just like pigs.

584
00:54:27,570 --> 00:54:28,800
Am I wrong?

585
00:54:30,269 --> 00:54:31,469
You jerk!

586
00:55:11,150 --> 00:55:13,750
You should have shot me
when I gave you the chance.

587
00:55:15,550 --> 00:55:19,219
I already killed
Chief Director Baek.

588
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:25,130
You're so weak.

589
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:27,130
Kim Yong Chul!

590
00:55:35,199 --> 00:55:37,369
Shoot. Shoot me.

591
00:55:41,039 --> 00:55:42,510
Did I tell you?

592
00:55:43,110 --> 00:55:45,550
Out of all the people I've killed...

593
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:49,219
touching Hae Won's body...

594
00:55:49,619 --> 00:55:51,489
excited me the most.

595
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:54,260
It was the best.

596
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:13,480
Team Manager Kang.

597
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:16,110
Team Manager Kang!

598
00:58:00,849 --> 00:58:02,750
"The ultimate power and the
devil are fighting there."

599
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:04,750
"The battlefield is..."

600
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:06,690
"the heart of man."

601
00:58:07,460 --> 00:58:08,619
By Dostoyevsky.

602
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:34,480
Dad.

603
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:37,320
Why do waves come and go?

604
00:58:40,289 --> 00:58:41,590
Because it doesn't stagnate.

605
00:58:43,690 --> 00:58:45,030
What does stagnate mean?

606
00:58:47,230 --> 00:58:50,969
It means it's contained in one place
for a long time.

607
00:58:52,730 --> 00:58:54,699
Is stagnating bad?

608
00:58:57,639 --> 00:58:58,809
Well...

609
00:59:00,010 --> 00:59:01,639
It could be good...

610
00:59:02,380 --> 00:59:04,179
or bad.

611
00:59:07,250 --> 00:59:09,349
I think it's good.

612
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:14,489
Why do you think so?

613
00:59:16,019 --> 00:59:17,329
If something stagnates,

614
00:59:17,889 --> 00:59:20,599
it means I can be with it
for a long time.

615
00:59:24,699 --> 00:59:25,869
Do you miss your mom?

616
00:59:32,210 --> 00:59:33,210
It's fine.

617
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:37,780
Your mom will be with us...

618
00:59:38,849 --> 00:59:40,420
in our hearts.

619
01:00:03,969 --> 01:00:05,670
Uncle. Aunt.

620
01:00:11,809 --> 01:00:19,820
(Thank you for watching
