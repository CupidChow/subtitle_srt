(Episode 3)

10
00:00:56,429 --> 00:00:59,000
Excuse me. Can I borrow a charger?

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,070
- All right.
- Thank you.

12
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:05,870
When is the appointed time?

13
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:08,310
There isn't any available train.

14
00:01:09,109 --> 00:01:10,709
I could be late.

15
00:01:10,709 --> 00:01:11,909
It's not my fault.

16
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:13,140
What could I do?

17
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:14,510
That's how it is.

18
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:16,010
So?

19
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:20,989
Dear Lord.

20
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:31,129
Someone from Congressman Song's
team was at the forum.

21
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:32,930
It seemed like they were positive
about it.

22
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:35,530
I passed on the information
to Reporter Hwang,

23
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:37,670
and it will be included in
a three-page-long editorial column.

24
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,000
Well done.

25
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,140
Tell me the details
when you come back.

26
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:43,340
Yes, sir.

27
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,409
Here is the charger you asked for.

28
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,579
Thank you.

29
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,359
What is that?

30
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,659
Look. Look at the mark.

31
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:04,159
Please leave me alone.

32
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:05,299
Cho Seok Hwan.

33
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,330
Look at the folder.

34
00:02:08,969 --> 00:02:12,400
That is the mark for NCI.

35
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,139
I told you what happened there.

36
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:17,310
Get a hold of yourself.

37
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:19,879
Think carefully about...

38
00:02:20,449 --> 00:02:22,050
what we need to do.

39
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:42,500
Attention all passengers,

40
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:45,539
there has been an unexpected
incident,

41
00:02:45,539 --> 00:02:47,569
and the train has stopped.

42
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:50,110
Please stay seated...

43
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:51,909
and wait for a moment.

44
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:00,719
Did something happen outside?

45
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,219
It's nothing.

46
00:03:02,219 --> 00:03:04,389
I can't be late.

47
00:03:04,389 --> 00:03:06,120
If you wait a little,
it will be fine.

48
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,490
You don't have to worry.

49
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:09,330
The train will depart shortly.

50
00:03:09,729 --> 00:03:11,300
My goodness.

51
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:16,800
Excuse me. What's going on?

52
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,699
Are you on duty?

53
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,740
Yes. I'm in the NCI.

54
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:24,039
A murder suspect I was chasing...

55
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:25,740
got hit by a train and died.

56
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,979
I think his accomplice is
on this train.

57
00:03:28,979 --> 00:03:31,180
Is there anything I can do
to help?

58
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,379
Do you see them talking secretly?

59
00:03:33,949 --> 00:03:35,490
You shouldn't leave them be.

60
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:38,759
Just pretend you don't know.

61
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:40,060
Do you see that gun?

62
00:03:43,629 --> 00:03:44,659
Take it from him.

63
00:03:45,129 --> 00:03:46,759
What are you doing?
Let go.

64
00:03:53,939 --> 00:03:54,939
What's this!

65
00:03:57,409 --> 00:03:59,210
- Grab her.
- Don't move.

66
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,680
Don't move.

67
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,550
I won't. Calm down.

68
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:05,050
I won't move.

69
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,919
- Let go of the gun.
- Don't move.

70
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,620
Don't move.

71
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:17,329
Don't move.

72
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:20,600
Well done.

73
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,430
Well done, Seok Hwan.

74
00:04:26,269 --> 00:04:29,339
This is the security feed
from the train car.

75
00:04:29,339 --> 00:04:32,339
There are a total of seven
hostages in the car.

76
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:35,110
The two dead victims are the police
officer and the attendant.

77
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:36,879
Wait, pause the feed.

78
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:44,490
Oh, my goodness.

79
00:04:45,259 --> 00:04:46,459
That's Min Young.

80
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:47,660
Wait.

81
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:51,660
There. Can we see that part closely?

82
00:04:53,329 --> 00:04:55,569
No, not that part.
I want to see the suspect's face.

83
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:02,009
It's dyskinesia.

84
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,379
What? Dyski...

85
00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:06,009
He has a contorted face.

86
00:05:06,009 --> 00:05:08,509
In other words, he has
a spontaneous movement disorder.

87
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:10,879
It happens when someone doesn't take
or decrease the amount...

88
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:13,720
of the antipsychotic medication they
have been taking for a long time.

89
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,019
Does that mean Min Young...

90
00:05:15,389 --> 00:05:17,290
is being held hostage
by a crazy man?

91
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,389
He's not just a crazy man.

92
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:22,329
He's a crazy man with a gun,
who commits murder.

93
00:05:24,029 --> 00:05:25,430
Gather around here.

94
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:26,730
Gather around.

95
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,600
- You, come here!
- Okay.

96
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,600
Hurry up.

97
00:05:47,949 --> 00:05:49,019
Cho Seok Hwan,

98
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:50,589
why are you doing this?

99
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:52,060
Calm down...

100
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,790
and listen to me.

101
00:05:54,589 --> 00:05:56,689
I am sick of listening to you.

102
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:58,459
You listen to me this time.

103
00:05:58,930 --> 00:05:59,959
Mr. Cho.

104
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:03,430
She was always full of herself.

105
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:05,439
You should just kill her.

106
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,990
Why do they send such people?

107
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:28,930
Why do they? Why?

108
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,360
Why?

109
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,500
Hey,

110
00:06:31,529 --> 00:06:33,329
your boyfriend has gone insane.

111
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,769
Watch your mouth.
He's not my boyfriend.

112
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:37,769
Does he have a mental disorder?

113
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:39,699
Yes, he does.

114
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,939
But he'll calm down soon.
Just wait a moment.

115
00:06:43,009 --> 00:06:44,639
How do you know that?

116
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,480
He's my patient.

117
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:51,180
I was on my way to attend a
conference to present a case of...

118
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:52,720
a patient who has overcome
a serious mental illness.

119
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,720
Is there any way
we can calm him down?

120
00:06:55,389 --> 00:06:56,949
This has never happened before.

121
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,889
This is the first time he's shown
this kind of violence.

122
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:03,329
Think carefully.
There must be a way.

123
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:06,759
I believe...

124
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:10,970
he probably thinks that he's in
a dangerous situation right now.

125
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:14,870
We can only calm him down
if we get rid of his fear.

126
00:07:15,939 --> 00:07:17,410
I don't know what the problem is.

127
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:20,750
Are you all right?

128
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:22,610
Wait. Are you all right?

129
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:24,519
Here. It's all right.

130
00:07:25,449 --> 00:07:26,680
Keep breathing.

131
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,220
Don't do that.

132
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:33,759
His name is Cho Seok Hwan,
and he is 44 years old.

133
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,129
He lives in Nam-gu Manyeon-dong,
Busan.

134
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,100
He received a doctorate in
chemical engineering...

135
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,329
at Buseong University and developed
alternative energy sources.

136
00:07:40,329 --> 00:07:42,269
At that time, he once participated
in a one-man protest,

137
00:07:42,269 --> 00:07:44,040
arguing that a state institution
had stolen his patent.

138
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,569
Since then, he had been receiving
psychotherapy.

139
00:07:47,069 --> 00:07:49,610
I think there's a pregnant woman
on the train.

140
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:51,639
Yes. Her name is Oh Seung Eun,
and she's 35 years old.

141
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:53,310
She has a hospital record.

142
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,509
The person looking after her
is Cho Seok Hwan's doctor.

143
00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:57,949
Her name is Kim Ji Yeon,
and she is 35 years old.

144
00:07:58,319 --> 00:07:59,750
And that foreigner...

145
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:01,649
is Marie Liz, 24 years old.

146
00:08:01,649 --> 00:08:03,620
She works at the Press Office
at the French Embassy.

147
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:06,689
Who is the man wearing a hat?

148
00:08:07,689 --> 00:08:09,459
I can't find
his personal details yet.

149
00:08:09,529 --> 00:08:12,600
I can track the passengers with the
cards they use to buy the ticket.

150
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:15,329
But he's the only one without
any records.

151
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:17,769
One of the dead victims was
a police officer, right?

152
00:08:17,769 --> 00:08:18,769
Yes.

153
00:08:21,339 --> 00:08:24,740
If one of the suspects had been hit
by the train, causing it to stop,

154
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:28,709
and his accomplice secretly
boarded the train at that moment...

155
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:31,920
That would explain why he has
no record.

156
00:08:32,019 --> 00:08:33,350
Wait a moment.

157
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:35,389
I will run the facial recognition
system to see...

158
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:37,190
if he fits the composite sketch.

159
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,759
That's right. It's him.

160
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:44,000
He's Kang Won Hyung, the murder
suspect that the police was after.

161
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,700
He's wanted for...

162
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,769
breaking and entering 245
Bangi-dong, Sejong-si,

163
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:51,470
robbery,

164
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,600
and murdering the whole family
at around 11 o'clock last night.

165
00:09:24,539 --> 00:09:26,740
The Special Tasks Force has
the area surrounded.

166
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,470
The sniper is ready.

167
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:30,840
We decided not to make a move
until the negotiation is over.

168
00:09:31,009 --> 00:09:32,240
What does the criminal want?

169
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,509
He keeps telling us to bring
to bring the person in charge.

170
00:09:38,149 --> 00:09:40,350
I'm hostage negotiations team
manager, Jung Han Soo.

171
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:41,850
I'm Ha Sun Woo from NCI.

172
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:44,659
We'll take care of negotiations
from now on.

173
00:09:44,659 --> 00:09:48,190
Do you think you can negotiate with
a lunatic who doesn't trust anyone?

174
00:09:49,059 --> 00:09:51,960
First, we have to show him
that things...

175
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,129
are going the way he wants.

176
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:00,840
Park as close as you can
to the barricade.

177
00:10:01,139 --> 00:10:03,509
Wait for 30 seconds
when you arrive at the site.

178
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,309
Get off as you receive a report...

179
00:10:05,509 --> 00:10:08,149
as if you're a senior manager
who are running late.

180
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:13,049
Don't trust them so easily.

181
00:10:15,389 --> 00:10:16,820
Don't look at the train. Ignore it.

182
00:10:17,289 --> 00:10:19,919
You must act
as if you don't care about...

183
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:21,289
only a few hostages.

184
00:10:21,929 --> 00:10:23,789
Finally here. Here.
He's finally here.

185
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:26,330
He's here. He's finally here.

186
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:36,740
The criminal is keeping his eye
on the situation and reacting.

187
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,610
It's important to figure out
what the criminal's delusion is.

188
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,539
We have to use it.

189
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,389
Isn't it better to
send in the SWAT team?

190
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:55,730
I mean, we should do something. This
isn't going to make it any better.

191
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:57,929
He'll contact us soon if we wait.

192
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,559
You must wait
if you want him to answer...

193
00:11:00,659 --> 00:11:01,929
our questions...

194
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:05,570
until the criminal becomes anxious.

195
00:11:23,019 --> 00:11:24,720
I'll do it. Take me.

196
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,590
No. Do you think I'd let you
deliver my message to them?

197
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:29,330
Tell me what you want,
and I'll tell them.

198
00:11:29,659 --> 00:11:30,830
Take me.

199
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,000
Don't trust her, Seok Hwan.

200
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,529
He's right. Calm down.

201
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:43,110
No.

202
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,610
Say it clearly.

203
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:50,610
I'll kill you
if you give them any code.

204
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:52,320
Yes. Okay.

205
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:12,370
Hello.

206
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:13,370
Ask him who they are.

207
00:12:13,669 --> 00:12:15,240
He wants to know who they are,

208
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,009
the people who just arrived.

209
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,909
We're people who will
work things out.

210
00:12:22,549 --> 00:12:25,179
He wants to know
which position you're in.

211
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,320
Tell him to ask himself.

212
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:29,120
If he doesn't tell you,
I'm going to kill you.

213
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,090
I'm scared. Help me.

214
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,059
Please save me.

215
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:37,429
You're one of them, aren't you?

216
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:43,330
Tell me. If you don't,
I'm going to kill this agent too.

217
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:48,909
You know who I am...

218
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:53,080
better than anybody else.

219
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:55,110
Are you really in high position?

220
00:12:55,549 --> 00:12:57,480
Then you can get rid of it, right?

221
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,649
You can get rid of it, can't you?
Right?

222
00:13:02,019 --> 00:13:04,320
Yes, but...

223
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:07,529
it will take some time.

224
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,629
No, no, no, no, no.

225
00:13:09,629 --> 00:13:11,460
You have to get rid of it now.

226
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:15,100
You know it's not that easy.

227
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:18,700
I'll hang up now.

228
00:13:19,269 --> 00:13:21,139
One hour. I'll give you an hour.

229
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:22,740
I'll give you an hour.

230
00:13:23,509 --> 00:13:25,139
If you don't get rid of it
in an hour,

231
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:26,740
I'll kill them all.

232
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:33,580
Get rid of what?
What is he talking about?

233
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,220
We have to find out.

234
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:39,590
At least, we got time
to figure it out.

235
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:52,669
Wait.

236
00:13:54,309 --> 00:13:56,940
Rewind the video please.

237
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,440
Stop.

238
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:02,350
His arm.

239
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,519
It looks like someone dug into
his arm.

240
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:09,149
But why are there so many?

241
00:14:09,149 --> 00:14:10,720
What if he was trying to
get something out?

242
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:14,190
It might be a microchip
or something.

243
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:15,230
A microchip?

244
00:14:15,289 --> 00:14:18,230
The criminal seems like he has
a serious delusional disorder.

245
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,169
He thinks there is a tracking device
on his arm.

246
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:26,240
In 20 minutes...
In 20 minutes,

247
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,769
they will call.

248
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,110
We have 20 minutes left.

249
00:14:33,409 --> 00:14:35,909
How shall we take out
a microchip that's not even there?

250
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,820
He's suffering
a delusional disorder,

251
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,779
but he's quite articulate.

252
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:42,090
That means that
he can think logically.

253
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:45,889
We have to make a situation where
he'll think the chip's gone.

254
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:49,190
The thing is he thinks
the chip is in his arm.

255
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:51,860
Seok Hwan will watch his arm...

256
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,830
to make sure the chip is out.

257
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,110
Look.

258
00:15:03,009 --> 00:15:04,210
What are you doing?

259
00:15:08,809 --> 00:15:09,879
What?

260
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:17,690
Are you saying we should put on
a magic trick?

261
00:15:18,389 --> 00:15:20,289
Keep a chip in your hand,

262
00:15:20,289 --> 00:15:22,429
and act like you just took it out.
How does that sound?

263
00:15:22,429 --> 00:15:23,960
No. That's dangerous.

264
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:25,500
Do you have any other ideas?

265
00:15:25,659 --> 00:15:28,000
You're not even used to
the work yet.

266
00:15:28,169 --> 00:15:29,230
I'll wear the in-ear.

267
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:32,200
I'm sure you know about
his condition well,

268
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,370
so call me when you have it
figured out.

269
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,710
- Are you sure you can do it?
- Team Manager Kang.

270
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:39,740
Seok Hwan will kill the hostages
when time is up.

271
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,049
We have no other choice.

272
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:55,360
How did it go?

273
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:58,899
We'll send an expert to remove it.

274
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:06,940
When you face Cho Seok Hwan,

275
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,610
you have to consider everything
according to his delusions.

276
00:16:12,909 --> 00:16:15,549
When there are hostages,
even if we get an order to attack,

277
00:16:15,549 --> 00:16:17,679
there are times when we don't tell
the negotiator.

278
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:20,379
Because if something's wrong
in my voice or my choice of words,

279
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:22,590
everything will go to nothing.

280
00:16:24,789 --> 00:16:26,519
I was in the Special Tasks Force.

281
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:30,889
Don't make eye contact
with agent Min Young.

282
00:16:31,259 --> 00:16:33,629
Don't forget that you
are an expert...

283
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:35,470
in removing microchips.

284
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:36,929
Are you done now?

285
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,299
Tell him to stop, Seok Hwan.

286
00:17:13,369 --> 00:17:14,509
Stop there.

287
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:19,509
Don't worry. I have nothing.

288
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:21,910
I'm only here...

289
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:24,880
to remove the microchip...

290
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:26,980
inside your body.

291
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:29,190
Don't fall for it.

292
00:17:29,619 --> 00:17:31,049
Take off your bulletproof vest.

293
00:17:31,289 --> 00:17:32,859
I need to see what's on your body.

294
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,579
Don't try to do anything stupid...

295
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:56,210
or I'll kill her.

296
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:37,390
I was right.

297
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:40,859
See? I was right.

298
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,759
Look at this, Doctor. I was right!

299
00:18:45,029 --> 00:18:47,660
Everyone said I'm crazy,
but I was right.

300
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,500
Yes. I'm sorry, Seok Hwan.

301
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:52,140
I'm sorry I didn't trust you.

302
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:54,670
Seok Hwan.

303
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,940
You've gone through a lot.

304
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,380
It's all over now.

305
00:18:58,779 --> 00:19:00,410
Give me the gun.

306
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:21,630
Hey, do you really believe that...

307
00:19:22,099 --> 00:19:23,730
it came out from your arm?

308
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,740
I saw it.

309
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,640
He had in between his fingers
and took it out.

310
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,920
He was lying to me.

311
00:19:41,549 --> 00:19:43,690
He was lying to me.

312
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:47,490
He is probably a police officer.
Can't you see that?

313
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:55,029
Don't move.

314
00:19:55,029 --> 00:19:56,269
Why are you doing this?

315
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:00,470
I'm probably the only person
here that understands you.

316
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:01,839
Who are you?

317
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,140
Me?

318
00:20:04,509 --> 00:20:07,009
I am someone who is being watched by
the government like you.

319
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:11,480
I also have a lot of things to say
to this corrupt government.

320
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:15,289
From now on,
let's be on the same side.

321
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:18,890
Okay.

322
00:20:22,329 --> 00:20:23,990
There has been a change of plans.
Get out.

323
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:26,299
Leave the rest
to the Special Tasks Force.

324
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:28,329
When I give you the signal,
count to five...

325
00:20:28,329 --> 00:20:29,829
and get out as fast as you can.

326
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,369
When you face Cho Seok Hwan,

327
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:35,109
you have to consider everything
according to his delusions.

328
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,309
All right, Mr. Cho.

329
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:39,940
I...

330
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,109
am a police officer.

331
00:20:42,809 --> 00:20:44,349
See? I was right.

332
00:20:44,349 --> 00:20:45,849
He lied to you.

333
00:20:45,849 --> 00:20:47,450
- Shoot him.
- What?

334
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:49,150
We should kill people like him.

335
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:51,589
But...

336
00:20:52,259 --> 00:20:55,089
we weren't watching you.

337
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:57,190
The person we were watching...

338
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:00,200
was him.

339
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:03,730
What?

340
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:05,470
He is the reason why...

341
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,769
we stopped the train.

342
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,539
That's right. It's him.

343
00:21:10,609 --> 00:21:12,940
He's Kang Won Hyung, the murder
suspect that the police was after.

344
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,079
He's wanted for breaking and
entering 245 Bangi-dong, Sejong-si,

345
00:21:16,309 --> 00:21:17,680
robbery,

346
00:21:17,849 --> 00:21:19,950
and murdering the whole family.

347
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:22,390
You broke into a research lab
in Bangi-dong, Sejong-si...

348
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:25,190
with your accomplice
at around 11 o'clock last night.

349
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:27,589
You stole the researchers' data
and murdered them.

350
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:30,160
You got into this train
so that you can take away...

351
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:31,859
Doctor Cho's research data.

352
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,500
Am I not telling the truth?

353
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:34,769
What are you talking about?

354
00:21:35,529 --> 00:21:36,930
What are you... That's nonsense.

355
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:38,240
- Doctor.
- Yes?

356
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,640
He was the one
who was watching you...

357
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,339
and put the chip...

358
00:21:43,369 --> 00:21:44,470
inside your body.

359
00:21:45,539 --> 00:21:46,910
He wanted to steal your research...

360
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:50,150
on alternative energy resource you
developed to make a better world.

361
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:51,750
Stop talking nonsense.

362
00:21:52,549 --> 00:21:53,849
Wait, no.

363
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:56,819
He... He is the one lying.

364
00:21:56,819 --> 00:21:59,660
We were chasing him
to protect you, sir.

365
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:00,789
If that wasn't the truth,

366
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:02,529
how would I have known...

367
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:05,859
that there was a chip
inside your arm?

368
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:08,529
Isn't that true?

369
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,269
- You, scum!
- Don't let them fool you.

370
00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:14,000
Don't let them fool you.

371
00:22:14,269 --> 00:22:16,940
- You know how sly they are.
- We...

372
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:19,309
We're on the same side.

373
00:22:19,309 --> 00:22:20,380
Kang Won Hyung!

374
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:22,579
Tell him the truth.

375
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:26,220
You scum!

376
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:37,759
Cho Seok Hwan, finish him!

377
00:23:42,829 --> 00:23:45,160
No, don't take me.

378
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,700
Please, I beg you.

379
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:48,000
Please!

380
00:23:50,029 --> 00:23:52,069
Please, tell them.

381
00:23:52,069 --> 00:23:53,500
Please, tell them.

382
00:23:55,339 --> 00:23:56,339
Do you see that?

383
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,440
Look.

384
00:23:59,079 --> 00:24:00,240
Look at the mark.

385
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:06,980
She was always full of herself.

386
00:24:08,119 --> 00:24:09,819
It was him!

387
00:24:09,819 --> 00:24:11,019
He told me to do it.

388
00:24:11,019 --> 00:24:12,960
It's not my fault. I didn't do it!

389
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,519
It's not my fault.

390
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:16,460
My mom...

391
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:18,730
always talks to herself
like Cho Seok Hwan...

392
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:20,329
or talks to someone
that doesn't exist.

393
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,569
They see illusions...

394
00:24:22,829 --> 00:24:24,170
because they are delusional.

395
00:24:25,539 --> 00:24:26,539
Some day,

396
00:24:27,269 --> 00:24:28,539
I'll be like that too.

397
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:29,740
No.

398
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:33,009
Hereditary transmission of
a mental illness...

399
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:34,680
is only a possibility.

400
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:38,049
You should stop worrying.

401
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:39,519
Let's go.

402
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,990
“It's hard to fight an enemy..."

403
00:24:43,589 --> 00:24:44,690
who has outposts in your head.”

404
00:24:45,059 --> 00:24:46,289
Sally Kempton.

405
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:52,759
Min Young!

406
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:57,630
Thank you for returning safely.

407
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,769
I thought I'd never see you again.

408
00:25:00,769 --> 00:25:02,509
I've come back safely.

409
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:05,039
You are not crying, are you?

410
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,849
Thank you, Hyun Joon,

411
00:25:09,079 --> 00:25:10,410
for saving Min Young.

412
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:11,650
It was nothing.

413
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:13,420
We're a family now. It was my job.

414
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:15,819
I look forward to working with you.

415
00:25:16,819 --> 00:25:18,049
Look at him smiling.

416
00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:20,119
He's very handsome.

417
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:22,089
- Gosh.
- People usually...

418
00:25:22,089 --> 00:25:23,789
don't say these things aloud.

419
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:26,160
Oh, my. Did you hear that?

420
00:25:27,329 --> 00:25:29,470
Team Manager Kang,
we have a new family member.

421
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:30,599
We should have a meal together.

422
00:25:30,599 --> 00:25:33,900
My wife actually told me she was
going to invite you for a meal.

423
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:36,440
Really? I'd really l like that.

424
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,940
Do you guys like it too?

425
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:40,480
Join us.

426
00:25:40,579 --> 00:25:41,950
My goodness.

427

Murder Incident)

428
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:03,970
(Case Report on Nadeul River
Murder Incident)

429
00:26:23,349 --> 00:26:24,349
What are you doing?

430
00:26:50,049 --> 00:26:51,049
Here.

431
00:26:51,779 --> 00:26:53,779
They were repairing
the bridge posts...

432
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:56,619
near Nadeul River when
the incident happened in 2003.

433
00:26:56,619 --> 00:26:58,089
He would have been
24 years old then.

434
00:26:58,490 --> 00:26:59,990
The culprit was in his 20's,

435
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:02,690
not a native to the region,
but familiar with the area.

436
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:05,700
He may have been a sex offender or
spent time in a treatment facility.

437
00:27:06,529 --> 00:27:09,630
He fits the profile
you told me about.

438
00:27:13,099 --> 00:27:14,170
(Case Report on Nadeul River
Murder Incident)

439
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:28,250
From now on, you're mine.

440
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:30,789
Who said you could do that?

441
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:35,829
I did.

442
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:37,160
We're dating from now on.

443
00:27:55,309 --> 00:27:57,150
What about Hyun Jun?

444
00:27:57,450 --> 00:27:59,279
He'll be here.
I sent him the address.

445
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:01,319
He said he'll come with Han.

446
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,660
- Hello.
- We're here.

447
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,000
- Welcome.
- Hello.

448
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,099
- Welcome. Welcome.
- Hello.

449
00:28:18,099 --> 00:28:20,000
How are you, Han Byul?

450
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:22,039
You got a haircut.

451
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,519
- Eat a lot.
- Thank you.

452
00:28:32,849 --> 00:28:33,880
Here's meat.

453
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:36,019
- Awesome.
- What do you want to eat?

454
00:28:36,019 --> 00:28:37,490
I want japchae. I like japchae.

455
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:39,920
Han Byul. Don't bother him.
Go sit in your spot.

456
00:28:40,089 --> 00:28:41,119
No.

457
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:45,059
You're eating so well.

458
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,759
He looks like a nice guy.

459
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:50,170
- What are you talking about?
- Don't be like that.

460
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:51,839
- It's good because you feed me.
- I like him.

461
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:53,170
Really?

462
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:57,309
- Isn't it salty?
- It's fine.

463
00:28:57,869 --> 00:28:58,880
Go ahead. Eat.

464
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:04,380
Han Byul.

465
00:29:11,819 --> 00:29:13,319
What is this?

466
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:14,490
Eat a lot.

467
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:15,589
- Yes.
- Yes.

468
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:17,859
Hyun Jun.

469
00:29:17,859 --> 00:29:20,029
Team Manager Kang. Hurry up.
We'll start the quiz soon.

470
00:29:20,029 --> 00:29:21,460
Hyun Jun. Here.

471
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:25,269
Now, in "Chief Detective"
episode 880,

472
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,299
in the episode titled,
"It's Raining in Seoul",

473
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:31,069
what's the last thing that
Chief Han says as he resigns?

474
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:34,609
How do I know that? I'll just drink.

475
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:37,450
"The higher the building is,
the longer the shadow is."

476
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,849
What? No way.

477
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:41,750
Really?

478
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:43,950
My goodness.

479
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:46,519
It was a line that described
the crime rate will increase...

480
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:49,460
as the economy develops
and social polarization deepens.

481
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:50,529
Amazing.

482
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:54,400
My goodness. Han can't drink.

483
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,630
Give it to me. I'll drink for you.

484
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:02,309
I'll ask the next question.

485
00:30:03,809 --> 00:30:07,539
The high school girl murder case
in Nadeul River in 2003.

486
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:12,579
What's the number...

487
00:30:12,579 --> 00:30:14,680
of suspects who received
a DNA test?

488
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:20,089
136.

489
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,400
Is that correct?

490
00:30:28,769 --> 00:30:30,000
Hello. This is Kang Ki Hyung.

491
00:30:30,769 --> 00:30:31,869
Yes, that's right.

492
00:30:34,369 --> 00:30:35,539
The chief commissioner?

493
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,039
My gosh. I knew
this was going to happen.

494
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:39,140
- Wait. Wait.
- Hey.

495
00:30:39,779 --> 00:30:41,539
- Hop in.
- I don't want to go home.

496
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:43,210
What are you doing?
What is he saying?

497
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:46,019
- Drive safe.
- Bye.

498
00:30:46,019 --> 00:30:47,220
Bye, Hyun Jun.

499
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:08,809
Two months after Go Young Min,
son of Shilla Group's chairman...

500
00:31:08,809 --> 00:31:11,940
Go Byung Tae, was arrested for
the sexual assault of a minor,

501
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:14,509
he was acquitted and seen exiting
the Seoul Prosecutor's Office.

502
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:16,480
While various advocacy groups...

503
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,420
are continuing their protests,

504
00:31:19,549 --> 00:31:22,849
Ha Yoon Man of Ha and Jang, who
is Go Young Min's attorney,

505
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:25,619
said there was no pressure
in the court's decision,

506
00:31:25,819 --> 00:31:27,190
and law and principles...

507
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:29,589
- Law and principles?
- were applied equally...

508
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:32,599
What kind of nonsense is that?

509
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:36,630
Let's play some music, Nana.

510
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:39,099
What? Sure.

511
00:32:11,369 --> 00:32:13,670
Yes, this is Kang Ki Hyung.
I got your call yesterday.

512
00:32:21,109 --> 00:32:22,180
Yes.

513
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:27,480
You're here.

514
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,119
How do you feel?

515
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:31,890
You must be very busy, aren't you?

516
00:32:32,819 --> 00:32:34,460
You must come even
if you're busy.

517
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:37,829
I won't get to see you after today.

518
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:40,430
I'm glad to see you...

519
00:32:41,099 --> 00:32:44,700
before I leave this place for good.

520
00:32:45,029 --> 00:32:46,700
Don't say that.

521
00:32:47,170 --> 00:32:49,940
I should've visited you more often.
I'm sorry.

522
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:51,339
It's fine.

523
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:55,109
I know the position...

524
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,210
you're in.

525
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:07,589
It's been...

526
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:10,329
a long time.

527
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:16,970
Take a look at this.

528
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:21,240
(The Reaper Serial Murder Case)

529
00:33:23,369 --> 00:33:24,769
This is the reaper case.

530
00:33:24,869 --> 00:33:25,940
Yes.

531
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:30,009
I killed two more.

532
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:33,920
I stabbed them with a knife.

533
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:36,119
Once.

534
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:38,049
Twice.

535
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,059
Three times.

536
00:33:43,559 --> 00:33:46,099
It's hard no matter
how many times I do it,

537
00:33:47,029 --> 00:33:49,569
but I'll get used to it
if I continue.

538
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,339
I'm talking about murder.

539
00:34:03,349 --> 00:34:06,579
Do you recognize that voice?

540
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:08,250
Yes.

541
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:11,119
I could never forget that voice.

542
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:13,159
It's...

543
00:34:14,559 --> 00:34:16,059
all my fault.

544
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:18,630
It's my fault.

545
00:34:20,059 --> 00:34:22,130
We failed to catch him
because of me.

546
00:34:22,869 --> 00:34:24,469
What do you mean?

547
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:28,039
What was the real reason for
disbanding the investigation team?

548
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,280
At the time,

549
00:34:35,079 --> 00:34:38,110
I knew you were after him,

550
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:42,889
but I was afraid.

551
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:47,219
I couldn't bear...

552
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:48,989
seeing any more murders,

553
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:53,260
so I excluded you...

554
00:34:54,099 --> 00:34:56,829
from the investigation team.

555
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:03,570
Open this.

556
00:35:09,579 --> 00:35:12,780
If you stop chasing me,

557
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:14,750
I'll stop hunting...

558
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,989
while you're alive.

559
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:21,590
If you continue to chase me,

560
00:35:22,429 --> 00:35:23,730
my next target...

561
00:35:25,929 --> 00:35:27,800
will be your family.

562
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,570
Is this...

563
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,869
Yes. I made a deal with him.

564
00:35:40,139 --> 00:35:42,780
The investigation was
at a standstill,

565
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:46,050
and there was no way
we could catch him.

566
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:48,079
I couldn't...

567
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:53,989
let him get close to my family.

568
00:35:55,289 --> 00:35:56,429
I...

569
00:35:57,530 --> 00:36:00,300
shouldn't have done that.

570
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:02,570
I shouldn't have...

571
00:36:11,869 --> 00:36:14,610
It's all my fault.

572
00:36:16,409 --> 00:36:17,880
I'm sorry.

573
00:36:23,719 --> 00:36:25,389
When I die,

574
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,820
the deal is over.

575
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:31,760
Now,

576
00:36:33,159 --> 00:36:35,030
you'll be his target.

577
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,500
He...

578
00:36:38,829 --> 00:36:41,099
targets only the best.

579
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:30,320
Aren't you curious about
how I look?

580
00:37:42,199 --> 00:37:43,269
You...

581
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:08,019
Darn it.

582
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:12,559
Aram, I'm calling insurance
so just stay put.

583
00:38:12,559 --> 00:38:13,860
The tire blew out.

584
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:15,670
Someone's coming over.

585
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,300
Hello?

586
00:38:19,869 --> 00:38:20,869
Yes.

587
00:38:21,099 --> 00:38:23,269
One of my tires blew out.

588
00:38:23,269 --> 00:38:24,340
Do you need help?

589
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:26,010
I have a spare in my car.

590
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:27,539
It's okay. I...

591
00:38:30,409 --> 00:38:31,409
Honey!

592
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,019
What's going on? Are you okay?

593
00:38:34,619 --> 00:38:35,650
Honey!

594
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:37,449
Honey!

595
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:46,500
Please, don't.

596
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:50,530
Your watch looks good on your wrist.

597
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:52,500
I'll give it to you.

598
00:38:53,239 --> 00:38:54,670
I'll give it to you.

599
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,710
So please let me live.

600
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:01,139
Let me live.

601
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:28,800
I'm at the scene.

602
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:40,780
Ki Hyung.

603
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:41,949
Those glasses.

604
00:39:42,849 --> 00:39:44,750
It belongs to Kim Yong Chul,

605
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:46,260
the only survivor
and the last victim.

606
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,590
He takes an item from
his previous victim...

607
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:50,659
to leave it on the next.

608
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:52,329
That's his signature.

609
00:39:52,659 --> 00:39:55,530
I didn't inform the media
as you instructed.

610
00:39:55,929 --> 00:39:57,099
Do you think it's a copycat?

611
00:39:57,170 --> 00:39:58,429
Gather the team.

612
00:39:58,769 --> 00:39:59,769
Yes, sir.

613
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:04,940
It's the Reaper.

614
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:08,440
The legendary serial killer that had
the whole nation shivering in fear.

615
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:10,179
Yes.

616
00:40:10,179 --> 00:40:12,750
There have been eleven cases in the
past 10 years since 2000.

617
00:40:13,019 --> 00:40:14,849
He stayed in the northwestern
area of Seoul,

618
00:40:14,849 --> 00:40:16,889
and he murdered 21 men and women.

619
00:40:16,889 --> 00:40:18,289
Then one day, he just disappeared.

620
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:20,420
He doesn't have a preference.

621
00:40:20,619 --> 00:40:23,090
He doesn't care about age or gender
when murdering.

622
00:40:23,559 --> 00:40:25,389
He usually attacks the man first.

623
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:28,500
He only wounds them enough to
have them barely breathe,

624
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,670
and he forces him to witness
the woman...

625
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:33,170
as she dies a slow, painful death.

626
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,340
The Reaper doesn't feel joy
with the act of murder.

627
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:39,210
Rather, he's shown abnormal
qualities where he feels superior...

628
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,210
while witnessing his victims' pain.

629
00:40:41,239 --> 00:40:42,239
What's the reason?

630
00:40:42,579 --> 00:40:43,579
Power.

631
00:40:44,179 --> 00:40:47,019
He wants to show that he's more
powerful than anything.

632
00:40:48,349 --> 00:40:51,190
But why are you bring this case up?

633
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:53,159
There hasn't been...

634
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:55,389
a single Reaper case since 2010.

635
00:40:55,889 --> 00:40:57,530
So people said he died...

636
00:40:57,530 --> 00:40:58,760
or went in jail.

637
00:40:59,659 --> 00:41:00,699
Take a look at this.

638
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:05,400
(If you stop chasing me, I'll stop
hunting while you're alive.)

639
00:41:06,739 --> 00:41:07,840
It's a deal.

640
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:12,469
That's why he stopped murdering
people.

641
00:41:12,469 --> 00:41:15,380
A police chief made this ridiculous
deal with the murderer?

642
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:16,949
After Chief Commissioner Kwon died,

643
00:41:16,949 --> 00:41:18,980
he started murdering again.

644
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:22,280
He left Kim Yong Chul's glasses
at the scene.

645
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:24,849
Kim Yong Chul.

646
00:41:25,789 --> 00:41:28,719
Seven years ago, the Reaper
stabbed him dozens of times,

647
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:31,230
but he miraculously survived.
He's the only survivor.

648
00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:34,000
If the Reaper left this behind,

649
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,329
it means his next target
is Kim Yong Chul.

650
00:41:36,329 --> 00:41:37,869
I agree with him.

651
00:41:37,869 --> 00:41:40,139
We'll have to stop it
before it gets dangerous.

652
00:41:41,739 --> 00:41:43,440
Have you confirmed
Kim Yong Chul's whereabouts?

653
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:44,610
About that...

654
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:46,679
It's too clean.

655
00:41:46,809 --> 00:41:49,610
All records on Kim Yong Chul
during the past couple of years...

656
00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:51,949
have been wiped clean.
There's nothing.

657
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:55,480
Instead, I found something on Son
Suk Ju, the reporter you mentioned.

658
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,650
I dug through
recent records on him,

659
00:41:57,789 --> 00:42:01,119
and found consistent phone records
with a particular number.

660
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:04,489
He's been calling that number
every Wednesday,

661
00:42:04,489 --> 00:42:06,300
at the same time.

662
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:07,400
What number is it?

663
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,500
It's...

664
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,829
the number of
a phone booth downtown.

665
00:42:12,639 --> 00:42:14,440
Why would Son Suk Ju do that?

666
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,250
Reporter Son's book is mainly...

667
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:25,750
interviews regarding the case.

668
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:28,349
So it would have been impossible
to write...

669
00:42:28,349 --> 00:42:29,820
without contacting Kim Yong Chul.

670
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:32,349
Sun Woo will go with me to
visit Reporter Son.

671
00:42:32,519 --> 00:42:35,489
Everyone else will gather
information on the Reaper suspects,

672
00:42:35,489 --> 00:42:36,889
and sort through them.

673
00:42:36,889 --> 00:42:37,889
Yes, sir.

674
00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:44,969
(For repairs call 080-2580-201.
This phone number is 02-382-5518.)

675
00:42:59,719 --> 00:43:00,719
Hello?

676
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:02,719
Kim Yong Chul?

677
00:43:03,949 --> 00:43:05,090
This is Kang Ki Hyung.

678
00:43:06,719 --> 00:43:08,019
I have a favor to ask.

679
00:43:08,219 --> 00:43:10,659
The young couple that was
murdered recently.

680
00:43:10,989 --> 00:43:12,289
Is it the Reaper?

681
00:43:12,329 --> 00:43:15,599
The police has already concluded
that it's a copycat.

682
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:18,599
Team Manager Kang,
when it comes to the Reaper,

683
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:20,539
I know as much as the police.

684
00:43:20,969 --> 00:43:22,440
I remember sending you my book.

685
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:24,369
I need Kim Yong Chul's address.

686
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:30,110
What will I get in return?

687
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:35,079
What's more important to you?
Writing an article...

688
00:43:35,619 --> 00:43:37,690
or catching him?

689
00:43:44,730 --> 00:43:46,000
If I'm right,

690
00:43:46,699 --> 00:43:47,800
it won't be too long...

691
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:49,900
before the next murder.

692
00:44:09,590 --> 00:44:10,690
Don't worry.

693
00:44:10,849 --> 00:44:12,989
We're from NCI.

694
00:44:13,619 --> 00:44:16,329
How did you find me?

695
00:44:16,329 --> 00:44:18,289
Reporter Son Suk Ju told us.

696
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:39,210
Why have you come to me?

697
00:44:46,989 --> 00:44:49,789
Are these your glasses?

698
00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:52,260
Is he back?

699
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:01,300
We came here to protect you.

700
00:45:01,369 --> 00:45:02,539
Protect me?

701
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:04,739
What protection?

702
00:45:04,869 --> 00:45:06,480
We understand how painful...

703
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,739
that day must have been for you.

704
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:10,750
Understand?

705
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:12,380
You understand me?

706
00:45:15,949 --> 00:45:17,019
That's nonsense.

707
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:18,889
Think about it.

708
00:45:20,289 --> 00:45:23,159
Someone stabs you more than
30 times.

709
00:45:25,030 --> 00:45:27,159
The person you love is
lying dead next to you.

710
00:45:28,599 --> 00:45:31,869
I had to watch that
with my own two eyes.

711
00:45:34,099 --> 00:45:35,769
You guys don't know him!

712
00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:37,340
He's the devil.

713
00:45:49,019 --> 00:45:51,349
There's no need for you
to continue living like this.

714
00:45:51,719 --> 00:45:53,989
We can help you get treatment.

715
00:46:02,199 --> 00:46:05,000
I was going to propose to Yu Jin
that day.

716
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:07,699
Hey, stop.

717
00:46:12,510 --> 00:46:13,510
Is something wrong?

718
00:46:13,510 --> 00:46:15,239
I have to go to this place,

719
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:16,679
but I don't know how.

720
00:46:17,949 --> 00:46:19,519
Oh, this place?

721
00:46:19,619 --> 00:46:20,750
It's not far...

722
00:46:24,489 --> 00:46:26,360
No!

723
00:46:26,719 --> 00:46:27,719
- Yu Jin!
- Yong Chul!

724
00:46:31,289 --> 00:46:32,630
Yu Jin...

725
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:37,500
was clenching both her hands.

726
00:46:38,030 --> 00:46:40,570
She must have been
in so much pain.

727
00:46:43,909 --> 00:46:45,070
I wanted to...

728
00:46:46,210 --> 00:46:47,840
straighten her fingers.

729
00:46:50,150 --> 00:46:51,849
But they wouldn't.

730
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:57,349
Our agents will protect you.

731
00:46:57,849 --> 00:46:58,849
No.

732
00:46:59,519 --> 00:47:00,590
No.

733
00:47:01,519 --> 00:47:03,460
No one can protect me.

734
00:47:04,329 --> 00:47:06,500
He's only a criminal.

735
00:47:07,099 --> 00:47:09,230
There's no need to fear him so.

736
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:16,269
Then why can't you catch him?

737
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:20,480
We will catch him.

738
00:47:39,929 --> 00:47:41,800
(Seoul)

739
00:47:54,710 --> 00:47:57,679
I didn't want anyone
to know about this place.

740
00:47:59,179 --> 00:48:01,250
If I'm not even at this address,

741
00:48:02,179 --> 00:48:04,090
it'll probably be my last.

742
00:48:04,949 --> 00:48:06,050
Promise me...

743
00:48:07,090 --> 00:48:10,159
that you won't reveal this address
to anyone else.

744
00:48:11,829 --> 00:48:13,059
I promise.

745
00:48:16,099 --> 00:48:18,469
(7-6 Bukhansan-ro, Seongbuk-gu,
Seoul)

746
00:48:28,179 --> 00:48:29,380
You're still looking through those?

747
00:48:29,949 --> 00:48:31,579
It's been five hours.

748
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:33,849
So I just need two more hours.

749
00:48:33,949 --> 00:48:36,449
Right now, there are 368 cases left.

750
00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:40,460
Hyun Jun, why don't you
sit down too?

751
00:48:43,929 --> 00:48:46,090
Let's see. Where should I start?

752
00:48:47,130 --> 00:48:50,230
The woman cried and said...

753
00:48:50,869 --> 00:48:51,869
Ki Hyung.

754
00:48:54,070 --> 00:48:56,869
Of all the suspects from
2007 to 2010,

755
00:48:57,039 --> 00:48:59,510
I gathered only those who were
concluded as copycats.

756
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:01,380
Okay.

757
00:49:02,239 --> 00:49:04,179
I first slashed the man's throat.

758
00:49:06,679 --> 00:49:07,920
If the man doesn't die?

759
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:10,989
That's the best part.

760
00:49:14,389 --> 00:49:15,460
This place is really nice.

761
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:16,489
It is.

762
00:49:16,489 --> 00:49:17,590
I don't know.

763
00:49:19,559 --> 00:49:21,130
It's so frustrating.

764
00:49:21,329 --> 00:49:23,969
They're cleaning up now
and putting me in the car.

765
00:49:24,329 --> 00:49:25,670
What do I do?

766
00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:27,900
What a great way to
educate the kids.

767
00:49:28,539 --> 00:49:30,210
Am I the only parent here?

768
00:49:30,469 --> 00:49:32,510
I have a job too.

769
00:49:32,510 --> 00:49:34,039
Dong Young gets it from you.
Who else?

770
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:36,750
I see. He gets all the good
qualities from you,

771
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:37,809
and all the bad ones from me?

772
00:49:37,809 --> 00:49:39,179
This is broken.

773
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:43,119
Give it to me.

774
00:49:59,630 --> 00:50:01,070
Come here and clean this up.

775
00:50:01,070 --> 00:50:02,099
Fine, I will.

776
00:50:03,309 --> 00:50:04,969
When I stab someone,

777
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:09,710
this is how I feel.

778
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:11,380
It's so sweet.

779
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:15,920
You need to know that.

780
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:17,789
(Restricted Number)

781
00:50:25,659 --> 00:50:26,730
Who are you?

782
00:50:28,829 --> 00:50:32,929
I'm sure you know who I am through
Chief Commissioner Kwon Sang Ho.

783
00:50:35,199 --> 00:50:36,409
I did.

784
00:50:37,710 --> 00:50:40,610
It was just plain old blackmailing.

785
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:44,280
So?

786
00:50:45,179 --> 00:50:47,150
You'll stand by what you believe in?

787
00:50:47,250 --> 00:50:48,750
Is that how desperate you are
for acknowledgement?

788
00:50:50,150 --> 00:50:52,349
You're just a trashy criminal
who commits murder,

789
00:50:52,349 --> 00:50:55,559
because you can't accept your
own inferiority.

790
00:50:58,530 --> 00:51:00,929
So you won't make a deal with me?

791
00:51:01,659 --> 00:51:03,429
Don't you have anything
more original?

792
00:51:06,369 --> 00:51:07,369
Here.

793
00:51:08,099 --> 00:51:11,239
What will you surprise me with
this time?

794
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:13,880
I hope you don't disappoint me.

795
00:51:15,909 --> 00:51:17,150
You're funny.

796
00:51:18,409 --> 00:51:21,519
Fine. I'll make sure
not to disappoint you.

797
00:51:35,199 --> 00:51:37,630
Please. Please.

798
00:51:38,199 --> 00:51:41,070
Not the kids, please.

799
00:51:42,199 --> 00:51:44,610
Please, let me live.

800
00:52:36,190 --> 00:52:37,530
Peek-a-boo!

801
00:52:49,570 --> 00:52:51,170
Please, let us go.

802
00:52:51,170 --> 00:52:52,710
This is the emergency call center.

803
00:52:53,409 --> 00:52:55,510
What's your emergency? Hello?

804
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:57,050
Can you hear me?

805
00:52:58,880 --> 00:52:59,980
Hello?

806
00:53:01,579 --> 00:53:03,289
This is the emergency call center.

807
00:53:04,519 --> 00:53:07,119
What's your emergency? Hello?

808
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:14,760
Hello? Someone died here.

809
00:53:15,059 --> 00:53:16,260
Someone's dead!

810
00:53:28,510 --> 00:53:29,510
They're here!

811
00:53:32,150 --> 00:53:34,079
Is it true that this case
is related to...

812
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:35,380
the serial murders
in northwest Seoul?

813
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:37,489
If it's true, why has the
murderer resurfaced?

814
00:53:37,489 --> 00:53:38,519
Please say something.

815
00:53:38,519 --> 00:53:39,690
Control the media.

816
00:53:39,690 --> 00:53:40,760
- Let them pass.
- Move.

817
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:42,960
- Please leave a comment.
- Say something.

818
00:53:45,059 --> 00:53:48,230
Only the couple was here
at the scene last night.

819
00:53:48,630 --> 00:53:51,099
Thankfully the children
went out to get water,

820
00:53:51,099 --> 00:53:52,170
and avoided the horror.

821
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:54,170
Did you finish interviewing the
person to report it?

822
00:53:54,539 --> 00:53:57,039
The thing is, the murderer is the
one who reported it.

823
00:53:58,170 --> 00:54:00,480
He reported it using
the kid's phone.

824
00:54:00,579 --> 00:54:03,449
Then the children witnessed
the scene.

825
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:05,349
Yes.

826
00:54:16,929 --> 00:54:17,929
Who are you?

827
00:54:27,369 --> 00:54:28,599
Give me photos of the scene.

828
00:54:41,679 --> 00:54:42,820
It's his signature.

829
00:54:45,289 --> 00:54:46,320
I'll give it to you.

830
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:48,619
You can have it,
so please let me live.

831
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:54,559
Here. What will you surprise me
with this time?

832
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:57,369
I hope you don't disappoint me.

833
00:54:58,500 --> 00:54:59,730
You're funny.

834
00:55:01,039 --> 00:55:04,139
Fine, I'll make sure not to
disappoint you.

835
00:55:05,110 --> 00:55:06,170
Ki Hyung.

836
00:55:07,610 --> 00:55:08,610
Over here.

837
00:55:30,670 --> 00:55:31,730
What's wrong?

838
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:36,769
He called me last night.

839
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:39,969
I refused the deal,

840
00:55:41,079 --> 00:55:42,809
and immediately, this happened.

841
00:55:43,909 --> 00:55:44,949
So,

842
00:55:45,809 --> 00:55:48,219
are you saying this happened
because of you?

843
00:55:50,389 --> 00:55:52,519
This is the fault of
that crazy man...

844
00:55:52,519 --> 00:55:54,760
who committed these horrors,
not you.

845
00:55:56,260 --> 00:55:58,889
If Chief Kwon hadn't accepted
the deal,

846
00:55:58,989 --> 00:56:00,929
and ended the investigation,

847
00:56:01,530 --> 00:56:03,869
this wouldn't have happened.

848
00:56:04,670 --> 00:56:05,699
Don't you think?

849
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:10,210
You're just doing your job.

850
00:56:11,110 --> 00:56:14,780
If we quit, someone else
will fill our place.

851
00:56:17,079 --> 00:56:20,050
Let's go. I'm fine.

852
00:56:22,650 --> 00:56:25,449
Trust yourself,
and trust your team.

853
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:30,230
We'll catch that murderer.

854
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,170
He was a troubled kid in school.

855
00:56:37,469 --> 00:56:39,469
We couldn't really talk to
his parents either.

856
00:56:40,699 --> 00:56:44,110
He won't talk to anyone right now.

857
00:56:44,340 --> 00:56:46,440
He won't help
the investigation much.

858
00:56:48,579 --> 00:56:49,579
Okay.

859
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:54,920
Hello, kids.

860
00:56:56,449 --> 00:56:57,550
I'm sure you're bored.

861
00:56:58,190 --> 00:56:59,750
Can I show you something cool?

862
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:01,260
Look carefully.

863
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:03,889
Sun Woo, what's that behind you?

864
00:57:05,289 --> 00:57:07,159
It's a chick.

865
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:12,599
Here, look!

866
00:57:12,969 --> 00:57:14,769
Blow on my hand and
see where it went.

867
00:57:16,699 --> 00:57:17,710
Where did it go?

868
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:21,280
What's on your head?
There's a nest there.

869
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:23,039
Ta-da!

870
00:57:23,579 --> 00:57:24,610
Give me your hand.

871
00:57:25,550 --> 00:57:26,650
It's a present.

872
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:28,179
You have to take good care of it.

873
00:57:29,949 --> 00:57:30,989
It's a bit stuffy here.

874
00:57:31,289 --> 00:57:33,320
Do you want to go out
and talk with me for a bit?

875
00:57:43,199 --> 00:57:45,070
So you ride motorcycles?

876
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:49,599
I was a pretty famous delinquent
in my neighborhood too once.

877
00:57:49,869 --> 00:57:51,369
I rode motorcycles,

878
00:57:51,369 --> 00:57:53,039
picked on weak kids,

879
00:57:53,039 --> 00:57:55,309
took money from them,
and ran away from home.

880
00:57:55,639 --> 00:57:57,409
I'm not that bad.

881
00:57:58,679 --> 00:57:59,710
I see.

882
00:58:01,849 --> 00:58:02,849
But you know...

883
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:04,289
One day,

884
00:58:04,289 --> 00:58:07,190
I was riding a motorcycle with
friends and I fell.

885
00:58:07,190 --> 00:58:09,019
There was a police car
right in front of me.

886
00:58:09,059 --> 00:58:11,559
I didn't want to get into trouble,

887
00:58:11,559 --> 00:58:12,929
so I hid in an alleyway.

888
00:58:17,469 --> 00:58:19,170
Do you know what I saw there?

889
00:58:50,429 --> 00:58:52,070
Dad.

890
00:58:54,570 --> 00:58:55,570
Your dad...

891
00:58:56,170 --> 00:58:59,710
was that police officer?

892
00:59:01,510 --> 00:59:02,510
Yes.

893
00:59:03,179 --> 00:59:04,179
But,

894
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:06,949
what do you think I did then?

895
00:59:14,590 --> 00:59:15,989
I just ran.

896
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:17,889
How embarrassing.

897
00:59:19,429 --> 00:59:21,659
My dad was dying
right in front of my eyes.

898
00:59:24,599 --> 00:59:26,269
But you saved your little sister.

899
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:30,440
(NCI Kim Hyun Jun)

900
00:59:30,909 --> 00:59:32,570
This is my number.

901
00:59:33,039 --> 00:59:35,440
When things get tough,
call me anytime.

902
00:59:39,179 --> 00:59:40,280
Okay.

903
00:59:42,019 --> 00:59:43,250
Let's go back to your sister.

904
01:00:02,570 --> 01:00:04,309
I was so scared.

905
01:00:08,809 --> 01:00:11,550
I was so scared
I couldn't do anything.

906
01:00:14,150 --> 01:00:15,380
To be honest,

907
01:00:16,750 --> 01:00:19,519
I loved that we were
going camping that day,

908
01:00:20,989 --> 01:00:23,059
but I was so mean to them.

909
01:00:25,730 --> 01:00:27,230
I feel so horrible about that.

910
01:00:28,829 --> 01:00:31,829
I feel so sorry to my mom and dad.

911
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:37,869
What am I going to do
about Sae Young?

912
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:47,349
I'll make sure...

913
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:49,650
to catch him for you.

914
01:00:54,260 --> 01:00:56,690
Why did he choose such a
difficult pattern this time?

915
01:00:56,820 --> 01:00:58,590
A change in pattern...

916
01:00:58,590 --> 01:01:00,900
means something changed
in his mind.

917
01:01:02,030 --> 01:01:04,670
The space is so easy to notice.

918
01:01:05,130 --> 01:01:07,440
Besides, he even left an
inconvenient witness.

919
01:01:12,969 --> 01:01:13,980
Hyun Jun!

920
01:01:15,679 --> 01:01:17,550
Yes. Do you have something to say?

921
01:01:17,909 --> 01:01:18,949
No.

922
01:01:19,849 --> 01:01:21,449
This...

923
01:01:26,019 --> 01:01:28,719
This was inside Sae Young's pocket.

924
01:01:28,719 --> 01:01:31,030
She must have forgotten because
she was so scared.

925
01:01:43,570 --> 01:01:44,570
Ki Hyung.

926
01:01:44,809 --> 01:01:47,579
You need to call your wife
immediately.

927
01:01:48,039 --> 01:01:50,449
The Reaper left the siblings
a photograph.

928
01:01:56,119 --> 01:01:57,119
(Hye Won)

929
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:20,840
But mister,

930
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:23,139
where is my dad?

931
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:25,750
He'll be here soon.

932
01:02:30,119 --> 01:02:31,119
My gosh.

933
01:02:31,119 --> 01:02:34,420
(Restricted Number)

934
01:02:37,559 --> 01:02:38,760
This is Kang Ki Hyung.

935
01:02:39,630 --> 01:02:41,230
Your boy is very pretty.

936
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:46,230
His eyes look exactly
like his dad's.

937
01:02:47,199 --> 01:02:48,300
You...

938
01:02:48,900 --> 01:02:49,900
Dad?

939
01:02:50,809 --> 01:02:51,909
Yes, Han Byul.

940
01:02:53,739 --> 01:02:54,909
You're okay, right?

941
01:02:55,309 --> 01:02:57,449
Yes. When are you coming?

942
01:02:57,980 --> 01:03:00,380
I met your friend here.

943
01:03:00,949 --> 01:03:01,949
Han Byul.

944
01:03:02,250 --> 01:03:04,090
Can I talk to him for a second?

945
01:03:07,889 --> 01:03:09,320
Don't touch my kid.

946
01:03:10,420 --> 01:03:12,659
I'm sure you received my gift.

947
01:03:13,389 --> 01:03:14,429
How about it?

948
01:03:15,030 --> 01:03:17,630
Do you want to start the deal now?

949
01:03:40,289 --> 01:03:42,889
Mister, where is my dad?

950
01:03:42,889 --> 01:03:45,389
My son, Han Byul, is missing!

951
01:03:45,630 --> 01:03:47,329
The Reaper has Han Byul.

952
01:03:47,329 --> 01:03:49,099
I need your cooperation.
A boy is missing.

953
01:03:49,099 --> 01:03:51,000
Please think about it one more time.

954
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:54,699
Look forward to it.
Things will get really fun now.

955
01:03:54,699 --> 01:03:56,670
I searched all the security
cameras nearby.

956
01:03:56,670 --> 01:03:57,840
But there's no trace of him.

957
01:03:58,070 --> 01:03:59,909
He didn't let him live.

958
01:04:00,469 --> 01:04:02,409
He was aiming for the next chance
to kill him.

959
01:04:02,409 --> 01:04:04,110
Did he propose the deal again?

960
01:04:04,110 --> 01:04:07,250
He's going to the Reaper right now.
