(Criminal Minds Korea)

9
00:00:41,049 --> 00:00:43,210
The victims were all charged
with a serious murder,

10
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:44,880
but they were found innocent.

11
00:00:45,219 --> 00:00:47,520
The police can't establish
justice in the society,

12
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,189
which is why the culprit
is doing it himself.

13
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,689
Stenographer?

14
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:51,960
It's someone who's in the court...

15
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,189
and knows every specific detail
about the case.

16
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:58,799
But it's not up to us
to kill him or let him live.

17
00:00:58,929 --> 00:01:01,200
It's up to me to punish
guys like this.

18
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,939
The law can't do its job,
so the world is going insane.

19
00:01:11,209 --> 00:01:13,010
My head really hurts.

20
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:15,180
You'll feel happy.

21
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,049
Take your time, and look around.

22
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:25,060
A woman was found murdered at
a show house.

23
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,930
The killer lured them there.

24
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:29,760
The killer used the utensils in the
kitchen to cook and drink.

25
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,000
He even put in bath bombs to
take a bath...

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,500
as if that was his home.

27
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,840
The killer may obsess over
such fantasies and ideals.

28
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,099
Look into whether there were
any similar cases in the past.

(Episode 17)

30
00:01:54,849 --> 00:01:57,560
Hurry up. Why are you still there?

31
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,519
Why did the culprit choose
a show house?

32
00:01:59,689 --> 00:02:03,359
It could be because it's easy
to commit a crime here.

33
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:08,199
Show houses are not guarded
as well as we think they are.

34
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:09,599
They are mostly temporary buildings,

35
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:14,169
and not many of them have
permits to use surveillance cameras.

36
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:16,909
They are owned by
the construction company,

37
00:02:16,909 --> 00:02:19,039
but in fact,
they are open to the public.

38
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:25,550
It's possible that the culprit
works for the construction company.

39
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,990
He could be a worker
at the show house.

40
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,659
There'd be a lot of people
who have access to the show house.

41
00:02:31,789 --> 00:02:34,090
There are real estate agents,
workers of the construction company,

42
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:37,030
people who come to visit,
and the people who promote.

43
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:40,800
The password is probably
"0000" or "1234".

44
00:02:40,969 --> 00:02:44,270
That means we have a wide range
of suspects.

45
00:03:03,389 --> 00:03:06,520
Undigested food was found
from the victim's stomach.

46
00:03:07,889 --> 00:03:10,330
It means the victim had a meal
with the culprit here.

47
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:32,520
The victim would have been
attacked here suddenly.

48
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:45,000
Yes, that's true.

49
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:48,270
There was evidence of that
right here.

50
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:53,199
There should have been
bloodstains all over the place.

51
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,210
But the floor is clean
without any traces.

52
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:01,150
Team Manager Kang,

53
00:04:01,849 --> 00:04:03,780
In the similar incident
that happened two months ago,

54
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,819
the culprit left the victim...

55
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:07,319
and left the scene.

56
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:09,189
The culprit also left bloodstains
behind.

57
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:12,789
It's highly likely that the murder
was impulsive, not planned.

58
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:16,790
The victim's belongings
and bag have been ransacked.

59
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,600
But it's also possible
that it was done on purpose...

60
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,500
to make it look like robbery.

61
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:24,800
On the other hand, the crime scene
of the second murder...

62
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,810
shows no sign of murder
and was left clean.

63
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:31,480
Do you really think that these
were committed by the same culprit?

64
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:35,110
The type of victims,
the way he kills these victims,

65
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:37,649
and the fact that he kills
in show houses...

66
00:04:37,649 --> 00:04:39,649
can be his signatures.

67
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:42,689
We should think of them as murders
committed by the same culprit.

68
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,060
Yes.

69
00:04:44,459 --> 00:04:46,819
There are a lot of cases in which,
after an impulsive...

70
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:48,959
and accidental murder,
the culprit could not forget...

71
00:04:49,329 --> 00:04:53,060
what it felt to kill someone
and committed murder again.

72
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:55,930
That's what happened in
Jang Gi Tae's shooting incident.

73
00:04:56,569 --> 00:04:58,670
Hey, are you crazy?

74
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,680
Team Manager Kang, I've been
searching for similar cases.

75
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:12,019
A week before the first incident,

76
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,949
there was a similar
assault incident.

77
00:05:15,089 --> 00:05:17,160
The victims was Park Ji Sun,
28 years old.

78
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,389
She was working at an
on-site massage center at that time.

79
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:24,060
After she refused a man who tried
to drag her into a show house,

80
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:27,300
she was beaten up severely
before she managed to run away.

81
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,470
Who were the suspects?

82
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,800
Based on the victim's testimonies,

83
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,269
they looked into laborers or workers
near the show house,

84
00:05:35,269 --> 00:05:37,980
but they didn't find anyone
suspicious.

85
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:42,110
One week later,
the culprit committed murder,

86
00:05:42,379 --> 00:05:45,220
and then he started killing again
two months later.

87
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:47,790
After an impulsive murder,

88
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,920
the culprit would have
gotten scared.

89
00:05:50,089 --> 00:05:52,060
But after seeing that the police
could not find him,

90
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,889
he would have
regained his confidence.

91
00:05:54,029 --> 00:05:57,399
That means it's possible that
his pattern could speed up.

92
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:00,129
I need to meet the victim. Call her.

93
00:06:00,129 --> 00:06:01,230
Yes, sir.

94
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,970
When the forensics arrived,

95
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:08,339
the water in the bathtub
was still warm.

96
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:13,009
That means the culprit stayed here
until early in the morning.

97
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:24,420
It was estimated that the victim
was murdered between 12am and 1am.

98
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:27,560
That means the culprit killed
the woman, tidied up the mess,

99
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,430
and enjoyed his bath
during that time.

100
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:32,060
Something does not add up.

101
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:35,029
He left the body in the sink...

102
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,600
and enjoyed his bath.

103
00:06:37,899 --> 00:06:41,139
That means he wasn't afraid
to leave traces behind.

104
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:44,379
But he cleaned up the bloodstains.

105
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:47,850
A show house...

106
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:49,949
is the manifestation
of the perfect home.

107
00:06:49,949 --> 00:06:53,149
The killer may obsess over
such fantasies and ideals.

108
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:56,620
What if it wasn't the bloodstain
that the culprit had cleaned up?

109
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,819
The culprit could have cleaned up
because the house had gotten dirty.

110
00:07:01,529 --> 00:07:03,660
He wouldn't have wanted...

111
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:07,230
his perfect space to be left dirty.

112
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:24,420
After the incident, Park Ji Sun
hasn't been out a lot.

113
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,879
She has been diagnosed with PTSD,

114
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:28,920
and she is still receiving
psychotherapy.

115
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,689
She only agreed to meet us...

116
00:07:30,689 --> 00:07:32,589
after she heard there had been
more victims.

117
00:07:32,889 --> 00:07:34,230
But I don't know if this could work.

118
00:07:34,529 --> 00:07:35,529
Let's go.

119
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,129
Thank you for agreeing
to meet with us.

120
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:44,670
I know it's hard,

121
00:07:45,069 --> 00:07:47,769
but can you tell us
about what happened?

122
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:58,680
Hoon, do you want to buy some snacks
from the store?

123
00:07:58,750 --> 00:07:59,949
Yes, Mom.

124
00:07:59,949 --> 00:08:02,449
I'll buy the candy
that you like too.

125
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,600
That day,

126
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,899
I received a call for the first time
in a while.

127
00:08:15,269 --> 00:08:17,500
I had been sick because of cold,

128
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:21,040
but I went anyway.

129
00:08:34,649 --> 00:08:36,090
(Seoul, Dalnam-gu, Dae 3-dong, 83-3)

130
00:08:40,629 --> 00:08:41,889
I hesitated.

131
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,360
That wasn't...

132
00:08:45,929 --> 00:08:48,370
a normal place to be.

133
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:53,399
While I was standing there,

134
00:08:54,309 --> 00:08:57,539
a man wearing a cap came out.

135
00:08:58,409 --> 00:08:59,980
He told me to follow him.

136
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:02,909
He said this was the place.

137
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:17,129
Wait, this is not your house.

138
00:09:17,629 --> 00:09:18,730
Wait.

139
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:43,519
How did you get out of the
show house?

140
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,389
I don't know.

141
00:09:45,659 --> 00:09:47,259
I wasn't thinking straight.

142
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:50,830
I just wanted to live.

143
00:09:52,629 --> 00:09:54,070
I begged him not to kill me.

144
00:10:01,009 --> 00:10:02,710
If I think about it now,

145
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:06,840
I think he might have just
let me go.

146
00:10:08,309 --> 00:10:09,879
I don't know.

147
00:10:10,149 --> 00:10:13,220
Is there a special reason why
you think so?

148
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,250
I'm not sure, but...

149
00:10:17,889 --> 00:10:19,720
This is just my guess,

150
00:10:21,389 --> 00:10:23,460
but I think it was because of
my son.

151
00:10:24,059 --> 00:10:25,399
Your son?

152
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:28,970
Please don't kill me. I have a son.

153
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:32,399
I'm the only one he has.
He will starve to death without me.

154
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:36,039
Please don't kill me. Please.
Please!

155
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:37,039
Please!

156
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:38,639
(My angel, Hoon)

157
00:10:52,059 --> 00:10:54,429
Please help me! Please.

158
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:55,860
Help me.

159
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,429
Please help me!

160
00:10:57,429 --> 00:11:01,100
Please help me! Help me!

161
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:04,600
Help me.

162
00:11:14,309 --> 00:11:15,509
Do you...

163
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:18,179
remember anything about the culprit?

164
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,490
There was nothing special.

165
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:25,690
I already told the police
about this.

166
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,190
It's all right.

167
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:30,490
You can tell us anything
you remember.

168
00:11:31,929 --> 00:11:36,070
He wasn't dressed up nicely.

169
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:40,370
He was wearing an old jacket.

170
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,379
I noticed a lot of dirt
on his sneakers.

171
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:55,389
I think he had a stutter as well.

172
00:11:55,649 --> 00:11:57,490
I could smell alcohol too.

173
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:01,230
He had something in his hand,

174
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:04,059
and he kept on fiddling with it.

175
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:09,299
Do you remember what it was?

176
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,139
It was something
I've never seen before.

177
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:16,539
It looked like a weight.

178
00:12:17,009 --> 00:12:21,610
It was pointy.
It kind of resembled a bullet.

179
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:24,679
I'm not entirely sure,

180
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:26,980
but I think...

181
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:31,019
there was a hook of some kind.

182
00:12:31,059 --> 00:12:32,659
A weight with a hook?

183
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:36,960
Yes. It was made out of metal.

184
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:38,299
Hold on.

185
00:12:45,539 --> 00:12:46,639
Does it look like this?

186
00:12:47,269 --> 00:12:48,539
I think that's it.

187
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:50,309
It's a plumb.

188
00:12:50,539 --> 00:12:53,080
It's used to level structures.

189
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:54,750
It's often used
on construction sites.

190
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:00,850
Yes, I understand.

191
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:06,860
Sir, the result is out from the NFS.

192
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,860
On both the culprit's wine glass
and the victim's hair,

193
00:13:10,029 --> 00:13:12,700
they found a designer drug
of the amphetamine family.

194
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:13,830
Let's see.

195
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:19,639
This is the newest popular drug,
flakka.

196
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:22,610
It causes extreme delirium
and induces violent behavior.

197
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:24,409
It's also called the "zombie drug".

198
00:13:24,509 --> 00:13:27,009
It's expensive
compared to other drugs,

199
00:13:27,009 --> 00:13:29,379
so most of the deals
are made online.

200
00:13:32,149 --> 00:13:34,149
(National Criminal Investigation)

201
00:13:35,049 --> 00:13:37,820
I looked into the lives of victims
Yoo Ah Young and Lee Jin Hee.

202
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,159
I think I know how they were related
to the suspect.

203
00:13:40,389 --> 00:13:43,929
They were big spenders
compared to their earnings.

204
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:47,730
They were working part-time
as dating partners.

205
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:51,240
They usually met through a website
called Date Mate.

206
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:53,299
They call it a date mate,

207
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:55,710
but it's obvious
prostitution is involved.

208
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:58,509
Are there overlapping customers
between the two victims?

209
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:00,409
I looked into that already.

210
00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:03,779
There were no overlapping numbers
or online accounts.

211
00:14:04,179 --> 00:14:06,019
They likely used a fake number...

212
00:14:06,019 --> 00:14:08,549
or they could have signed in
with a hidden IP address.

213
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:12,690
The culprit chose female targets
through the profiles online,

214
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,529
then he lured them in.

215
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,440
Let's go through
all the cases up to now.

216
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,909
To the culprit, the show house...

217
00:14:29,009 --> 00:14:31,210
must have been a place
where he could fill with fantasies.

218
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:33,779
In the perfect space,

219
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:36,980
he would spend time
with a woman of his type.

220
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:40,549
But once that fantasy broke,
he would kill the woman.

221
00:14:41,149 --> 00:14:43,190
The type of victims he chose...

222
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:46,990
will likely be related to the type
of woman that cause him trauma.

223
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:50,190
It could be his mother, wife,
or a girlfriend.

224
00:14:51,429 --> 00:14:54,029
He would fall into a fantasy there,

225
00:14:54,029 --> 00:14:55,899
thinking that he could create
the perfect family.

226
00:14:57,169 --> 00:15:01,169
Just for that night, he'll think
of the place as his sweet home.

227
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:02,269
The show house.

228
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:03,470
Hye Bin.

229
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:31,399
According to Park Ji Sun's testimony
and the crime pattern,

230
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,840
I think it's likely that the suspect
works in construction.

231
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:38,710
He could be one of the workers
that assisted...

232
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:40,009
with making the show house.

233
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:43,809
He's looking for his own method
through the murders.

234
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:46,580
The first murder was impulsive,

235
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:51,019
while you can see aspects
that were planned for the second.

236
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:52,960
There's another thing to note.

237
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,789
During the second murder,
he took drugs.

238
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:58,360
He committed murder
under the influence.

239
00:15:58,429 --> 00:16:01,230
However, we didn't find
traces of drugs in the first case.

240
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:04,870
Park Ji Sun told us
that she could smell alcohol.

241
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:07,639
He was probably drunk
at that time as well.

242
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,879
He must have searched
for something stronger.

243
00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:14,679
If he's becoming addicted to drugs,

244
00:16:15,149 --> 00:16:18,049
then his urge to kill
will go beyond our control.

245
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,519
Which means he'll commit
another murder soon.

246
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:26,620
However, it won't be easy
for him to murder in the same way.

247
00:16:26,659 --> 00:16:29,129
If he doesn't give up his fantasies,

248
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,899
then he won't give up the space
which makes up the hallucinations.

249
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:35,370
It might not be a show house,

250
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:38,440
but he'll commit murder
in a similar environment.

251
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,539
You're right.
He might change his pattern,

252
00:16:41,539 --> 00:16:43,309
but he won't give up
on his fantasies.

This place...

264
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:37,019
seems a little strange.

265
00:18:37,859 --> 00:18:43,089
If it's okay with you,
can we go to a hotel?

Why bother when I have an apartment?

instead of the hotel. Let's go.

I'm from the real estate nearby.

- Let me just put this on.
- Wait.

306
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:44,029
I'll put it on. Give it to me.

There's a record of accessing
a dating website.

322
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,230
He used the same way to lure
the victim.

The victim's appearance is different
this time.

324
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:59,180
It means the action's more important
than the target...

325
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,240
or while he was choosing the target,

326
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:04,150
he couldn't endure the urge to kill.

327
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:06,220
He left without cleaning the site...

328
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:09,289
as if his purpose was to kill.

329
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:13,289
It wasn't enough to fulfill
his fantasy.

330
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:17,259
There was a variable
that he didn't expect.

331
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:19,529
I checked the amount of water
and electricity.

332
00:24:19,529 --> 00:24:21,930
It's found that it was used
for two weeks.

333
00:24:22,029 --> 00:24:23,670
The culprit doesn't have a house.

334
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:26,299
He keeps moving from a place
to place like this.

335
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:28,569
When the security at the show house
tightened up,

336
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:32,410
he chose this place as
his scene of crime.

337
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,549
- Hello?
- Team Manager Kang.

338
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,250
I checked all the surveillance
camera nearby.

339
00:24:44,789 --> 00:24:48,589
I think I found the man
Park Ji Sun testified.

340
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:54,230
I'm tracing the surveillance
cameras.

341
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,529
The last place he was captured...

342
00:24:56,529 --> 00:24:59,369
was the overpass construction site
in Jungwoon 7-dong.

343
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:03,240
There's a record of him going
towards the hill.

344
00:25:03,309 --> 00:25:05,940
Are there unsold apartments
in that area?

345
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:08,410
No. That's a redevelopment area.
Everyone moved out,

346
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:10,109
and the whole town's empty.

347
00:25:10,109 --> 00:25:14,349
It's annoying because it's full of
teenage runaways and the homeless.

348
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:17,450
I'll go check. Come with me please.

349
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:18,460
Yes.

350
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:20,490
I'll call you if I find anything.

351
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:28,769
If...

352
00:25:29,329 --> 00:25:32,240
the culprit is homeless,

353
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:34,740
how did he manage to pay...

354
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:36,970
those women?

355
00:25:37,069 --> 00:25:40,380
If the first murder was
impulsive and accidental,

356
00:25:40,609 --> 00:25:42,650
there's a possibility he could've...

357
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:45,579
committed a crime beforehand
to get money.

358
00:25:45,579 --> 00:25:47,750
What we must do right now is
finding a suspect.

359
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:50,289
A wandering suspect is dangerous.

360
00:25:51,019 --> 00:25:53,259
Reveal the results we have so far
to the public,

361
00:25:53,259 --> 00:25:54,619
and let's get informants.

362
00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:55,789
Yes, sir.

363
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:03,470
You'll find homeless people
over there.

364
00:26:05,569 --> 00:26:06,599
Let's go.

365
00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:20,319
Excuse me.

366
00:26:21,319 --> 00:26:22,890
I have a question.

367
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:28,890
Have you seen this person?

368
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:34,829
It's blur. I can't see anything.

369
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:37,630
Buy me a drink or something
before you ask.

370
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:43,069
I'm searching for a murder suspect.

371
00:26:59,559 --> 00:27:00,559
Put it down.

372
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:02,930
Now!

373
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:48,170
We're searching for a suspect
related to the recent...

374
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:49,809
show house murder case.

375
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:53,009
Please listen to the following
carefully,

376
00:27:53,079 --> 00:27:55,250
and if it matches the person
we're looking for,

377
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:58,009
please call the number below.

378
00:27:58,009 --> 00:27:59,450
The suspect we're looking for...

379
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:02,390
wanders around with
no place to stay.

380
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:05,559
It's highly likely that he worked as
a day laborer on construction sites,

381
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:08,259
or any jobs similar to it.

382
00:28:08,259 --> 00:28:12,029
By the way, Kim Jin Young
wanted to thank you.

383
00:28:12,329 --> 00:28:14,059
He said...

384
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:16,430
his relationship with his wife's
gotten better thanks to you.

385
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,740
Don't mention it.

386
00:28:18,869 --> 00:28:21,500
It was possible because they took
an active role in counseling.

387
00:28:22,609 --> 00:28:25,779
He could've been violent
unpredictably.

388
00:28:25,779 --> 00:28:27,440
He shows an obsession towards...

389
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,279
a shelter like a house or
a show house.

390
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:31,480
He could've wandered around
the area,

391
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,980
- What's wrong?
- or looked inside.

392
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:37,289
- Mr. Kang. What's wrong?
- If you see anyone similar...

393
00:28:37,289 --> 00:28:38,920
to the composite sketch,
please contact us.

394
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:41,359
Where did you get this?

395
00:28:43,259 --> 00:28:45,960
It looks interesting.

396
00:28:46,859 --> 00:28:48,329
I just picked it up on a street.

397
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,440
Then what's this?

398
00:28:57,769 --> 00:29:01,180
Why do you have the murder victims'
belongings?

399
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:03,079
What?

400
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:11,920
This is all his.

401
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:14,390
This isn't mine.

402
00:29:21,029 --> 00:29:22,230
What's his name?

403
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:25,440
Mr. Kang.

404
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:31,710
I don't know his name. We call them
by his last name.

405
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:33,140
Mr. Kang.

406
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:36,579
I'm not lying.
I only know his last name.

407
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:40,450
By the way...

408
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,619
why are you looking for this guy?

409
00:29:44,289 --> 00:29:46,460
He's a suspect of
three murder cases.

410
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:47,559
What?

411
00:29:48,089 --> 00:29:49,890
Murder?

412
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:52,160
Where's he now?

413
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:55,529
I don't know. I really don't know.

414
00:29:56,269 --> 00:29:57,930
He asked me to watch this...

415
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,000
until he comes back.

416
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,410
He asked me to watch this.
I'm serious.

417
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:03,910
He just asked you to watch it?

418
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:04,940
Yes.

419
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:06,410
Then why did you run away?

420
00:30:11,049 --> 00:30:12,420
Did you steal?

421
00:30:18,089 --> 00:30:19,359
Look, Han Gi Cheol.

422
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,859
If you don't tell me the truth,

423
00:30:22,859 --> 00:30:25,700
you'd be considered as
an accomplice to this crime.

424
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:35,369
I mean...

425
00:30:36,069 --> 00:30:37,839
he cherished this.

426
00:30:38,369 --> 00:30:41,680
I became curious, so...

427
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:45,279
I was only trying to see
what's inside.

428
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:49,319
That's all.

429
00:31:10,509 --> 00:31:11,609
Did he...

430
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:14,509
really commit the murder...

431
00:31:15,309 --> 00:31:16,680
that happened a few days ago?

432
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,319
Do you know anything?

433
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:26,089
It's just that he doesn't look
like the type.

434
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:28,259
Never mind.

435
00:31:29,329 --> 00:31:33,230
There's a witness who saw Han
Gi Cheol in the homeless shelter.

436
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:34,529
Any other calls?

437
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:37,170
We keep getting calls,

438
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:40,869
but they were just men
who looked similar.

439
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:45,109
These people had no houses,

440
00:31:45,109 --> 00:31:47,910
so the informants didn't know
much about them.

441
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:55,250
Team Manager Kang, we received
a report from the construction site.

442
00:31:55,819 --> 00:31:57,119
Call Sun Woo and take her with you.

443
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:58,250
Yes, sir.

444
00:32:06,529 --> 00:32:08,099
(Apartment Construction Site)

445
00:32:15,369 --> 00:32:18,309
Wait a moment. Where did I
put the file with the personal data?

446
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,509
Yes, it's him.

447
00:32:22,509 --> 00:32:24,680
His name is Kang Tae Soo.

448
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:27,049
He used to work here
until a few months ago.

449
00:32:28,549 --> 00:32:30,390
Why did you think it was him?

450
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:32,490
One of the laborers here told me...

451
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:34,589
he looked a little similar.

452
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,130
So I was reminded of him.

453
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:39,660
By the way, he was a little strange.

454
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:45,230
Hey, what are you doing
to someone else's house?

455
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:47,170
It's nothing.

456
00:32:47,269 --> 00:32:48,339
It's nothing.

457
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:57,009
Gosh, I think it's nearly over.

458
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:59,250
Aren't you going home?

459
00:32:59,549 --> 00:33:01,220
I will.

460
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:03,619
Gosh.

461
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:08,119
The view is so nice here.

462
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:09,529
You can move in now.

463
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:13,730
Who is this?

464
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:15,900
Whenever we built a house,

465
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:18,900
he acted as if it were his house.

466
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:21,839
He drank a lot too.

467
00:33:22,039 --> 00:33:25,240
So I couldn't have him keep working
for me anymore.

468
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:26,910
All right.

469
00:33:27,009 --> 00:33:29,910
I checked his personal details, but
his registration number is wrong.

470
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:33,420
Some daily workers often...

471
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:35,390
write down fake numbers.

472
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:37,789
They all have their stories.

473
00:33:37,789 --> 00:33:39,990
So we just let them be.

474
00:33:43,089 --> 00:33:44,130
Team Manager Kang.

475
00:33:45,829 --> 00:33:46,829
All right.

476
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,470
If I find something, I'll call you.

477
00:33:50,269 --> 00:33:51,299
Okay.

478
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:56,740
(Pictures from the Crime Scene)

479
00:34:00,309 --> 00:34:01,309
(Pictures from the Crime Scene)

480
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,619
The first incident shows that
he was impulsive,

481
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:13,619
but the second incident shows
that the murder was planned.

482
00:34:15,059 --> 00:34:16,090
What is it?

483
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,730
- Team Manager Kang,
- Yes?

484
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:20,829
someone is here saying that
the culprit is his younger brother.

485
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:32,010
Are you sure it's your brother?

486
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:36,179
Yes, I think it's my brother.

487
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:40,980
Here.

488
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:55,329
- I'm Kang Ki Hyung.
- I'm Kang Dong Joo.

489
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:56,670
Team Manager Kang.

490
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:04,110
His name is Kang Dong Min.

491
00:35:05,239 --> 00:35:07,380
Where is he?

492
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:11,480
To be honest, I was looking for him.

493
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:17,190
Until a few months ago,
he often called me.

494
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,389
I didn't know that
he lived on the streets.

495
00:35:22,929 --> 00:35:24,059
But...

496
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:27,099
are you sure
my brother is the culprit?

497
00:35:29,829 --> 00:35:33,800
It's true that he is the most
likely suspect as of now.

498
00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:42,650
Is there a reason why
you think it's him?

499
00:35:54,019 --> 00:35:57,860
We used to move around a lot
since we were young.

500
00:35:57,860 --> 00:36:01,800
Dong Joo, Dad makes houses, right?

501
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:04,070
But why don't we have
a house of our own?

502
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:06,070
I heard that we will move soon.

503
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:20,320
Give one to me, Mom.

504
00:36:31,889 --> 00:36:34,599
Mom always said that she was
sick of her life.

505
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,230
- One day, she left home.
- Dong Joo,

506
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:38,829
do these lights come from houses?

507
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:41,840
Yes. Do you see
the apartment over there?

508
00:36:42,139 --> 00:36:43,570
Dad told me...

509
00:36:43,739 --> 00:36:46,739
that we will live
in one of those houses.

510
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,150
That's exciting! Will we have beds?

511
00:37:05,289 --> 00:37:07,659
We finally got a leased apartment,

512
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:09,599
and we were going to move there.

513
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:13,639
I found out later...

514
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,710
- that Mom had stolen the money...
- Dad.

515
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:18,309
- and run away with another man.
- Dad.

516
00:37:18,309 --> 00:37:19,340
Dad.

517
00:37:20,139 --> 00:37:22,179
- Dad committed suicide.
- Dad.

518
00:37:22,610 --> 00:37:25,150
- Dad.
- We barely survived.

519
00:37:25,949 --> 00:37:27,349
My family...

520
00:37:28,179 --> 00:37:31,219
was destroyed so quickly.

521
00:37:31,989 --> 00:37:34,090
Maybe that's why he's obsessed
with houses.

522
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:38,030
He could have thought that
Mom had run away...

523
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,730
and Dad had committed suicide
because we didn't have a house.

524
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,070
After that,

525
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,269
Dong Min seemed to be lost.

526
00:37:49,869 --> 00:37:53,980
When did you last see your brother?

527
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:55,679
10 days ago.

528
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:58,909
I heard he was around Mohyeon-dong,
so I went there.

529
00:37:59,349 --> 00:38:00,980
It was too dark to see,

530
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:02,920
but someone...

531
00:38:07,289 --> 00:38:09,690
Someone was watching me.

532
00:38:11,429 --> 00:38:15,460
I think that was Dong Min.

533
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:20,739
- Team Manager Kang,
- Yes.

534
00:38:20,739 --> 00:38:22,969
I had Ms. Park check
Park Dong Min's face...

535
00:38:22,969 --> 00:38:24,369
with his picture.

536
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:26,380
I think he was the culprit.

537
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:28,239
Give out his identifications
and pictures...

538
00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:31,449
and make sure to increase
surveillance around Mohyeon-dong,

539
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:32,949
where the homeless are staying.

540
00:38:33,079 --> 00:38:34,250
Yes, sir.

541
00:39:05,409 --> 00:39:07,650
Excuse me,

542
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,050
do you know who he is?

543
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:12,659
Yes.

544
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:15,219
I saw him a week ago.

545
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,860
He was wearing the same clothes.

546
00:39:18,059 --> 00:39:19,559
Gosh.

547
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:30,340
Mister, grab the bottle
and come here.

548
00:39:30,409 --> 00:39:31,670
Let's drink together.

549
00:39:34,409 --> 00:39:35,440
What?

550
00:39:38,349 --> 00:39:40,119
Didn't he say anything?

551
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:42,420
I asked him to pick it up,

552
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,489
but he glared at me and went away.

553
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:49,190
Before that, he couldn't even
look me in the eye.

554
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:53,099
He seemed to have earned some money
as he looked great.

555
00:39:54,829 --> 00:39:56,269
I was shocked...

556
00:39:56,269 --> 00:39:59,400
when I found out that
he had killed three people.

557
00:40:02,739 --> 00:40:03,739
Excuse me.

558
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:06,710
What is that person doing?

559
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:11,309
He's just telling people what to do.

560
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:13,050
The cross means...

561
00:40:13,719 --> 00:40:16,250
that the church in this village
gives out good food.

562
00:40:16,989 --> 00:40:20,889
The triangle means that
there's a patrol around there.

563
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,059
We try to help each other out
by giving signs.

564
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:28,360
What's that sign next to the cross?

565
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:31,599
That's not our sign.

566
00:40:31,969 --> 00:40:35,170
Some weird guy must have
drawn that to confuse us.

567
00:40:37,909 --> 00:40:39,880
It looks like a plumb.

568
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:41,909
The murderer left a mark...

569
00:40:41,909 --> 00:40:44,380
to show that it's his house
wherever he stayed.

570
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:46,179
If we follow these marks,

571
00:40:46,619 --> 00:40:49,119
we might be able to find
Kang Dong Min's whereabouts.

572
00:40:49,449 --> 00:40:50,449
Yes, Team Manager Kang.

573
00:40:51,019 --> 00:40:53,619
We found a mark left behind
by Kang Dong Min.

574
00:40:57,090 --> 00:40:58,329
Yes. Understood.

575
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,139
Why are you investigating this?

576
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:48,079
The NFS already checked
and found out that the DNA...

577
00:41:48,579 --> 00:41:49,679
belongs to Kang Dong Min.

578
00:41:50,449 --> 00:41:53,849
A car black box also captured him
coming in here.

579
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:57,449
There was a soju bottle
and a burnt butane gas container.

580
00:41:58,690 --> 00:42:00,420
Kang Dong Min must have
ran out of money,

581
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:02,760
so he was trying to find
a replacement for the drugs.

582
00:42:02,829 --> 00:42:05,030
That is what the police assumed.

583
00:42:05,530 --> 00:42:09,000
Most fires spread from the point
of origin by following oxygen.

584
00:42:10,429 --> 00:42:12,170
However, what's left here...

585
00:42:12,869 --> 00:42:15,969
looks like the fire engulfed
the place instantly, then went out.

586
00:42:17,909 --> 00:42:19,739
The fire started over there,

587
00:42:19,739 --> 00:42:22,010
but the fire went out
as fast as it spread.

588
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:45,800
It's gasoline.

589
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,170
Someone had sprayed gasoline
all over here.

590
00:42:56,809 --> 00:42:57,809
Team Manager Kang.

591
00:42:58,650 --> 00:43:00,449
At the scene of the first murder
two months ago,

592
00:43:00,519 --> 00:43:02,619
the murderer left the victim
as she was...

593
00:43:02,619 --> 00:43:04,090
and fled the scene.

594
00:43:04,449 --> 00:43:05,889
The blood stains were all there.

595
00:43:06,219 --> 00:43:09,389
It's likely that the crime
was impulsive and unplanned.

596
00:43:09,559 --> 00:43:11,730
Meanwhile, the second murder...

597
00:43:11,789 --> 00:43:14,630
didn't leave a trace.
It was perfectly controlled.

598
00:43:15,730 --> 00:43:18,329
Do you really think
they're the same person?

599
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:20,900
There's something else
that's different.

600
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:23,369
The murderer of the second case
took drugs...

601
00:43:23,369 --> 00:43:26,179
and committed the crime
while being under the influence.

602
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:30,010
However, we didn't find any
traces of drugs in the first one.

603
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:33,980
This time, the victim's
characteristics are different.

604
00:43:36,219 --> 00:43:37,219
Yes.

605
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:41,920
Sir, Nana found something.

606
00:43:43,090 --> 00:43:44,260
September 3.

607
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:47,829
Some homeless people had a fight
near an underground passage.

608
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,570
I was searching for something else
in the region...

609
00:43:50,570 --> 00:43:52,769
when I coincidentally noticed
this on CCTV.

610
00:43:52,769 --> 00:43:55,900
I thought it was a little strange,
so I retrieved the video.

611
00:43:56,139 --> 00:43:57,170
Do you see that?

612
00:43:57,739 --> 00:44:01,239
The man in black with a knife
is Han Gi Cheol.

613
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:04,010
The one with the hat
is Kang Dong Min.

614
00:44:04,179 --> 00:44:07,019
It says September 3rd,
which is 55 days ago from today.

615
00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:10,250
It's just four days after the
first murder in the show house.

616
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:14,619
But if you look at the footages
of Kang Dong Min take later...

617
00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:20,730
It doesn't look like he was injured.

618
00:44:20,730 --> 00:44:21,730
That's right.

619
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,300
Something is off.

620
00:44:24,570 --> 00:44:27,500
As soon as we found out
his address, there was a fire.

621
00:44:28,070 --> 00:44:31,010
What if someone is behind it
and is controlling everything?

622
00:44:32,309 --> 00:44:34,739
Do you remember what Kang Dong Jun
looked like when he came to us?

623
00:44:36,610 --> 00:44:38,380
His eyes were red.

624
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:42,619
His lips were parched.
He kept on drinking water.

625
00:44:43,019 --> 00:44:45,820
He kept on wiping the sweat
from his palms.

626
00:44:46,389 --> 00:44:49,360
Those are common characteristics
of a drug addict.

627
00:44:50,889 --> 00:44:52,760
- That means...
- My goodness.

628
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:55,730
Send this to Hyun Jun.

629
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:57,800
Look into Kang Dong Jun again.

630
00:44:58,070 --> 00:44:59,840
Family relations, properties,

631
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:01,300
drug dealings,

632
00:45:01,539 --> 00:45:03,510
and even where he lives.

633
00:45:03,570 --> 00:45:04,670
Yes, sir.

634
00:45:04,809 --> 00:45:06,239
You two, come with me.

635
00:45:06,239 --> 00:45:07,239
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

636
00:45:08,610 --> 00:45:09,679
Yes.

637
00:45:09,949 --> 00:45:11,980
We found evidence of arson...

638
00:45:12,179 --> 00:45:14,750
where they found the body
of Kang Dong Min.

639
00:45:16,519 --> 00:45:17,519
Pardon?

640
00:45:20,659 --> 00:45:21,789
I see.

641
00:45:22,019 --> 00:45:23,630
I'll call you after I check.

642
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:26,300
I looked into what you requested.

643
00:45:26,559 --> 00:45:30,030
Kang Dong Jun is currently
going through a divorce.

644
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:34,599
It looks like there were
a lot of problems between them.

645
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:37,110
They filed a lawsuit
for property division.

646
00:45:37,309 --> 00:45:38,840
However, he's in a lot of debt,

647
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:41,679
so their house is already
no longer with them.

648
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:43,079
Okay. Great job.

649
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:46,050
Okay.

650
00:45:48,019 --> 00:45:51,989
Sir, Kang Dong Jun is currently
at a consultation center.

651
00:45:52,219 --> 00:45:55,190
Could it have been him all along?

652
00:45:55,389 --> 00:45:58,929
I think it's his brother Kang Dong
Min who committed the first murder.

653
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:00,429
However, for some reason,

654
00:46:00,699 --> 00:46:03,199
he could no longer commit crimes.

655
00:46:03,570 --> 00:46:06,840
Because a few days later, Kang
Dong Min was injured by a knife.

656
00:46:07,639 --> 00:46:10,469
Kang Dong Jun must have found
his dying brother...

657
00:46:10,469 --> 00:46:12,510
and realized
that he committed murder.

658
00:46:13,809 --> 00:46:15,480
That's probably when
he started his plan.

659
00:46:15,610 --> 00:46:17,210
He acted like his dead brother...

660
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:19,010
and committed the same crimes.

661
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,539
He must have copied his brother
up to the second one.

662
00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:45,309
He chose his victims...

663
00:46:45,309 --> 00:46:46,809
because of his hatred
towards his mother.

664
00:46:46,809 --> 00:46:50,550
That way, the police would continue
to chase the dead Kang Dong Min.

665
00:46:50,750 --> 00:46:52,610
After that, Kang Dong Jun
became confident.

666
00:46:52,610 --> 00:46:54,119
From the third murder,

667
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:56,849
he chose his own targets...

668
00:46:57,119 --> 00:46:59,619
and changed the location
to empty apartments.

669
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:04,530
The victims were probably
similar to his wife.

670
00:47:05,090 --> 00:47:07,099
That's when the case turned public.

671
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:10,500
Since he couldn't hide anymore,
he came to us.

672
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:14,869
He made us find traces
of Kang Dong Min...

673
00:47:15,039 --> 00:47:17,769
and started a fire
to close the case.

674
00:48:03,389 --> 00:48:05,289
The brothers grew up
in the same environment,

675
00:48:05,289 --> 00:48:07,159
so they shared the same trauma.

676
00:48:07,789 --> 00:48:10,260
They both must have suffered
the urge to murder.

677
00:48:11,159 --> 00:48:12,530
Unlike how he seemed,

678
00:48:12,829 --> 00:48:16,099
Kang Dong Jun's current life wasn't
that much different from Dong Min.

679
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:17,630
We were...

680
00:48:18,469 --> 00:48:20,239
chasing a ghost all this time.

681
00:48:20,239 --> 00:48:21,900
(Cozy Psychology
Consultation Center)

682
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:22,900
Come in.

683
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:26,980
I heard that you were coming.

684
00:48:27,510 --> 00:48:29,039
Yes. Here.

685
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:32,480
I forgot to give this to you
last time.

686
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:43,429
When we were young,

687
00:48:44,389 --> 00:48:46,900
our father gave this
to Dong Min as a present.

688
00:48:49,559 --> 00:48:51,670
You didn't have to
bring it yourself. Thank you.

689
00:48:51,769 --> 00:48:54,969
It's nothing. I was just passing by.

690
00:48:55,869 --> 00:48:57,210
Please sit down.

691
00:48:58,809 --> 00:48:59,880
Okay.

692
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:11,489
You must be heartbroken.

693
00:49:11,650 --> 00:49:12,719
I'm okay.

694
00:49:13,289 --> 00:49:14,820
When I think of the victims,

695
00:49:15,219 --> 00:49:17,389
I feel guilty
thinking of being heartbroken.

696
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:23,670
You seem to be close
with your family.

697
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,400
Yes. My son loves to
follow me around.

698
00:49:29,539 --> 00:49:30,940
It's really tiring.

699
00:49:31,110 --> 00:49:33,480
Your wife is beautiful.

700
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:35,039
Thank you.

701
00:49:35,679 --> 00:49:36,679
Then...

702
00:49:37,449 --> 00:49:39,409
is the case closed now?

703
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:45,190
It turns out that the fire
could have been arson.

704
00:49:45,489 --> 00:49:46,989
We're under investigation.

705
00:49:47,019 --> 00:49:48,460
It'll be closed soon.

706
00:49:48,789 --> 00:49:50,059
Arson?

707
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:53,059
Does that mean
someone purposefully started a fire?

708
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:55,559
It's only a possibility for now.

709
00:49:56,199 --> 00:49:57,630
If it turns out to be true,

710
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:00,199
that means the person
could be an accomplice.

711
00:50:00,199 --> 00:50:01,969
That's what we're focusing on...

712
00:50:02,570 --> 00:50:03,769
in our investigation.

713
00:50:04,539 --> 00:50:05,610
I see.

714
00:50:12,750 --> 00:50:14,719
We'll let you know
if we find anything.

715
00:50:15,079 --> 00:50:16,889
You must be busy. We'll get going.

716
00:50:17,190 --> 00:50:18,190
Okay.

717
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:32,429
Kang Dong Jun started to react.

718
00:50:32,429 --> 00:50:36,039
It looked like he wanted to ask
more about it, but stopped himself.

719
00:50:36,670 --> 00:50:39,469
He'll now take action.

720
00:50:39,710 --> 00:50:42,110
He could destroy evidence
if there's any.

721
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:43,780
That's the moment we're aiming for.

722
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:03,170
I already told you everything.

723

Look closely.

724

Do you want to be responsible for
all murdered women?

725
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:11,139
No. No.

726
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:13,239
I'm sorry.

727
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:14,780
I'm sorry.

728
00:51:15,110 --> 00:51:17,409
I didn't do it on purpose.

Hello? Hey! Hey!

Your mother left you a piece
of property before she died.

Kang Dong Min committed.

the next one...

785
00:57:12,699 --> 00:57:15,000
by acting like your brother.

Am I correct?

787

He doesn't admit it.

they couldn't get out of,

themselves.

his stuff for him.

Did you think...

797
00:57:53,610 --> 00:57:55,940
your brother was better off dead?

798
00:57:56,239 --> 00:57:57,809
Is that why you
killed your brother...

799
00:57:57,849 --> 00:58:00,280
and committed murders under
his identity?

talking about.

You physically abused...

814
00:58:43,730 --> 00:58:46,630
your children regularly.

815
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:49,530
Not only that, you do drugs and
have delusional disorder...

816
00:58:49,530 --> 00:58:51,900
that you secretly check on your
wife.

817
00:58:52,230 --> 00:58:54,199
I said I don't want to hear it.

818
00:58:56,969 --> 00:58:58,139
You just...

819
00:58:59,070 --> 00:59:02,010
wanted to escape the dump
you're living in.

820
00:59:03,750 --> 00:59:04,750
Am I wrong?

821
00:59:05,579 --> 00:59:08,380
Did you enjoy watching
drugged women beg you...

822
00:59:08,380 --> 00:59:10,050
to save their lives?

823
00:59:10,050 --> 00:59:11,690
Shut your mouth.

824
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:14,289
I could rip it out.

825
00:59:14,489 --> 00:59:16,989
Yes, this is it.

826
00:59:17,159 --> 00:59:18,829
This is the real you.

827
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:21,699
You...

828
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:24,230
just wanted to kill people.

829
00:59:24,630 --> 00:59:25,699
Didn't you?

830
00:59:26,630 --> 00:59:29,369
Don't hide like a coward
and tell me...

831
00:59:29,369 --> 00:59:30,969
that's why you killed people.

832
00:59:30,969 --> 00:59:32,639
Shut your mouth, you scum!

833
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:35,139
What do you know?

834
00:59:35,809 --> 00:59:38,710
What do you know about
the reason why I killed them?

835
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:41,079
What do you know?

836
00:59:41,219 --> 00:59:42,650
What do you know?

837
00:59:54,599 --> 00:59:55,699
Kang Dong Jun,

838
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:57,400
listen to me carefully.

839
00:59:58,469 --> 01:00:00,369
Just like what you said,

840
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:02,739
you're just a lowlife murderer.

841
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:09,440
Hey.

842
01:00:11,010 --> 01:00:12,079
Wait there.

843
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:13,610
Wait!

844
01:00:20,420 --> 01:00:21,420
Hey!

845
01:00:22,659 --> 01:00:24,159
What do you know?

846
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:25,690
What do you know?

847
01:00:25,690 --> 01:00:29,130
- You don't know anything.
- I have the primary DNA results.

848
01:00:29,130 --> 01:00:31,969
Several bloodstains of recent
victims were found from...

849
01:00:31,969 --> 01:00:34,269
Kang Dong Min's clothes
that Kang Dong Jun was wearing.

850
01:00:37,769 --> 01:00:39,510
It's clear that
he committed the crime.

851
01:00:39,769 --> 01:00:41,480
But he doesn't seem to repent.

852
01:00:44,250 --> 01:00:50,690
(I feel worn out every day.
It's so exhausting.)

853
01:00:52,289 --> 01:00:54,389
"Good did not separate..."

854
01:00:54,690 --> 01:00:57,630
"happy families
from unhappy families."

855
01:00:58,460 --> 01:00:59,730
"But men cannot..."

856
01:01:00,329 --> 01:01:02,599
"free themselves from them."

857
01:01:03,429 --> 01:01:04,670
Fyodor Dostoevsky.

858
01:01:25,420 --> 01:01:28,659
The culprit raped the victims
multiple times.

859
01:01:29,090 --> 01:01:32,429
Can you tell me about
what happened last night?

860
01:01:32,429 --> 01:01:35,460
When I close my eyes,
I can see his face.

861
01:01:35,460 --> 01:01:36,960
There's a witness to the message.

862
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:38,900
The culprit made the victim
see his face...

863
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:40,769
and expressed his violent anger.

864
01:01:40,769 --> 01:01:42,300
What does that mean?

865
01:01:42,769 --> 01:01:45,739
The culprit will be choosing
his next target.

866
01:01:45,809 --> 01:01:48,280
We need to move before he does.

867
01:01:49,780 --> 01:01:53,150
Promise me that you will arrest him.

868
01:01:53,150 --> 01:01:54,480
I promise.
