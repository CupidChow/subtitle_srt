00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,280
I'm in front of the building
that exploded...

10
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,719
around noon today in Hanseo-dong.

11
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,520
According to the police report,

12
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:52,359
the terrorist called the police
directly about 30 minutes ago...

13
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:54,689
and informed them that
he installed a bomb,

14
00:00:54,689 --> 00:00:56,490
and announced that he will
commit another crime.

15
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:59,600
The police is considering the
possibility of a serial bombing...

16
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,070
and is continuing...

17
00:01:03,369 --> 00:01:05,069
- I'm sure. Look.
- Please move back.

18
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:06,870
They're figuring out...

19
00:01:34,769 --> 00:01:35,900
What is the current situation?

20
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:38,099
A bomb was found
in front of an operating room.

21
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,569
But the patient is in critical state
and the surgery cannot be stopped.

22
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,370
It's "Prototype S".

23
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,439
There are numerous lines
connected to the detonator.

24
00:01:44,739 --> 00:01:46,540
This means that the only person...

25
00:01:46,709 --> 00:01:48,250
who can defuse the bomb
is the culprit.

26
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:49,980
Cho Tae Soo is 41 years old...

27
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:52,120
and works as an explosive expert
at a construction company.

28
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:55,590
He was sent overseas as a part of
the special forces seven years ago.

29
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:58,790
Contact the headquarters and check
if he got a burn injury in the army.

30
00:01:58,890 --> 00:01:59,959
Yes, sir.

31
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:02,590
Sun Woo, you should check if he has
any connections to this hospital.

32
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:03,959
Yes, sir.

(SWAT team)

34
00:02:11,139 --> 00:02:13,639
As you mentioned, there was an
explosion while he was in the army.

35
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,610
Seven died as a result.

36
00:02:21,449 --> 00:02:22,479
The white line.

37
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,699
I can't watch this anymore.
I will do it from now on.

38
00:02:40,729 --> 00:02:41,729
Follow the rules.

39
00:02:41,729 --> 00:02:44,169
It's his responsibility
to defuse the prototype.

40
00:02:57,419 --> 00:02:58,620
We have one minute left.

41
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,449
This is the last stage.

42
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:02,189
It's either the "Pass" button...

43
00:03:02,419 --> 00:03:03,520
or the "By-Pass" button.

44
00:03:04,389 --> 00:03:05,560
What's the next one?

45
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:10,659
Cho Tae Soon is lying.

46
00:03:14,129 --> 00:03:16,129
- Somehow...
- It's just like you said.

47
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,699
He didn't get any burn injuries
while he was in the army.

48
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:23,469
What's next? We don't have time.
Hurry.

49
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:26,080
"Pass".

50
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:27,979
Wait. Wait a moment.

51
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:34,550
"By-Pass".

52
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:38,759
"By-Pass".

53
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:40,659
Are you out of your mind?
He said "Pass".

54
00:03:40,789 --> 00:03:43,629
He wanted to kill people
from the start.

55
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:45,360
He won't blow a chance...

56
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,699
to kill people in front of him,
even if that means...

57
00:03:47,729 --> 00:03:49,069
he's going to prison.

58
00:03:49,069 --> 00:03:51,370
Are you sure? Are you?

59
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:01,180
Press the "Pass" button.

60
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:02,509
Press the "Pass" button.

61
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,120
Can't you hear me?
Press the "Pass" button.

62
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:08,020
Press the "Pass" button.

63
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:30,569
- Help me!
- Help me!

64
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:33,199
- Help me!
- Help me!

(Episode 1)

66
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:59,329
(One year later)

67
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,470
(This is the last model from 2000
in the color red.)

68
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,310
It's the exact color that I wanted.

69
00:06:07,569 --> 00:06:09,370
Are you really offering me
the car at that price?

70
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:10,910
(Yes, I have to go abroad
on a short notice.)

71
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:12,410
(You can go on a test drive
if you want.)

72
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:29,230
There are only a few of these
in Korea. This is a limited edition.

73
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,060
Of course. I know.

74
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:34,269
I searched a lot of websites
to find this model.

75
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:37,170
Do you want to check the engine?

76
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,439
I will take you back home.

77
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,980
You can turn right there.

78
00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:00,860
You were supposed to turn right.

79
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:07,399
I'll just get off here.

80
00:07:09,769 --> 00:07:11,339
What are you doing?

81
00:07:12,569 --> 00:07:13,670
Hey.

82
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:16,569
Stop the car.

83
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:19,110
Stop the car!

84
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,709
Stop the car!

85
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:47,240
Don't kill me.
Please, don't kill me.

86
00:07:47,769 --> 00:07:50,579
I didn't do anything. I was good.

87
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:05,259
(NCI)

88
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,600
I know that you're feeling anxious.

89
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,629
However, according to the rules,
we can't do anything until we...

90
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:19,000
receive an official request
from the police.

91
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:25,240
What does the police say
about the Park In Hye case?

92
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:28,709
They think that it's an abduction
case caused by resentment.

93
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:30,579
Resentment?

94
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:33,889
They think that it's related to
the Southwest Gyeonggi Province...

95
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,389
serial murder case.

96
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:40,789
What would Team Manager Kang say?

97
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:44,029
It's been a year.

98
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,059
It's about time he came back.

99
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:48,769
What do you think?

100
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:52,870
I think it's for him to decide.

101
00:08:53,139 --> 00:08:56,240
If you meet him, tell him
that this is the last chance...

102
00:08:56,409 --> 00:08:58,610
for him to come back.

103
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:02,779
I stabbed them.

104
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,220
Every time I stab them,
it's hard for me.

105
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:10,620
But if I keep doing it,
I'll get used to it.

106
00:09:11,419 --> 00:09:13,090
Killing.

107
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:19,000
There are two famous voices
in Korea.

108
00:09:19,529 --> 00:09:22,830
The first one is the culprit
behind Lee Hyung Ho's kidnapping,

109
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:23,940
"His voice".

110
00:09:24,539 --> 00:09:26,769
The other one is the voice
you just heard,

111
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:28,769
"This voice".

112
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,779
The culprit of the Northwestern
Seoul serial murder cases,

113
00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:35,649
known as the "Killer Reaper"
by the media,

114
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,980
has murdered 21 men and women
in the 11 cases he caused...

115
00:09:40,549 --> 00:09:44,059
for the last 10 years
since 2001.

116
00:09:45,389 --> 00:09:47,789
One of his peculiar signatures
was to place...

117
00:09:47,789 --> 00:09:50,059
the former victim's belongings...

118
00:09:50,429 --> 00:09:52,960
on the next victim he murdered.

119
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:57,269
The red heels on the last picture...

120
00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:00,340
had belonged to the former victim.

121
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:18,490
But as if to say that
he's had enough fun,

122
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,220
he disappears suddenly.

123
00:10:21,059 --> 00:10:22,259
That was seven years ago.

124
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,429
After that,

125
00:10:24,529 --> 00:10:27,899
no similar cases have been found.

126
00:10:29,169 --> 00:10:30,370
Why do you think so?

127
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,240
One of the theories by the police...

128
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,639
is that the culprit has already been
arrested...

129
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:38,679
on a charge that has nothing
to do with his murders.

130
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,049
But I think...

131
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:45,919
that he can't ever be
an anonymous prisoner.

132
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:49,889
The only reason he murders...

133
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,960
is to get attention from others.

134
00:10:54,389 --> 00:10:57,629
There is another theory
that he has already died.

135
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:01,129
In fact, that could be
the only way for...

136
00:11:01,129 --> 00:11:03,730
an obsessive murderer
to stop killing.

137
00:11:04,269 --> 00:11:06,299
Does the culprit really have
a mental disorder?

138
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:09,009
Or is he innately a psychopath?

139
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:13,379
Please take a look at people sitting
beside you.

140
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:18,649
Do you see anyone
who could be a murderer?

141
00:11:20,049 --> 00:11:21,149
The thing is...

142
00:11:21,289 --> 00:11:24,090
the criminal who commits
horrible murder...

143
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:27,960
can be anyone's neighbor...

144
00:11:29,929 --> 00:11:31,600
or family.

145
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:36,929
(Personal Details Report)

146
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:38,470
This is the fourth victim.

147
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:40,909
His pattern is getting faster.

148
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,240
According to the analysis,
we only have four days...

149
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,879
to save Park In Hye.

150
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:50,509
Have you ever had this thought?

151
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:52,950
Sometimes...

152
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,220
we could be wrong.

153
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:06,100
If there is another voice inside
your head shouting,

154
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,100
don't hide it.

155
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:15,240
That's the most violent thing
you can do to yourself.

156
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,440
That's what you told me before.

157
00:12:22,379 --> 00:12:23,809
You need to help.

158
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,720
That's what the chief director
wants too.

159
00:12:37,929 --> 00:12:40,629
This is the last known place
she had a cell phone signal.

160
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,169
If we have to look into every
single missing persons case,

161
00:12:43,169 --> 00:12:44,600
when do we get to do our work?

162
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:46,440
It's just a female college student
sleeping out for one night.

163
00:12:46,669 --> 00:12:48,440
We're not in the Female
and Youth Division.

164
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,740
They even make us do this.

165
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:52,679
She reserved a restaurant
and a cake...

166
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:54,580
for her friend going abroad,

167
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:56,509
but she disappeared
before few hours...

168
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:57,580
after turning her cell phone off.

169
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,379
And she came to a place
where she has never been.

170
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:03,950
This is not just
a simple disappearance.

171
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:06,220
What is it then
if it's not a simple disappearance?

172
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:17,200
Before her cell phone is turned off,

173
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:20,539
it took 2 minutes and 30 seconds
before 3 stations changed.

174
00:13:21,409 --> 00:13:22,409
That means...

175
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,840
the car is going over
70km per hour...

176
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:26,610
when her cell phone turned off.

177
00:13:30,149 --> 00:13:31,149
Yes, Squad Chief.

178
00:13:33,019 --> 00:13:34,019
Pardon?

179
00:13:35,019 --> 00:13:37,049
Yes. Okay.

180
00:13:37,889 --> 00:13:40,320
Hey, let's go.
They found the suspect.

181
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:46,600
This watch will make 10 minutes...

182
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:50,700
that only you can use.

183
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,200
But...

184
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,340
you must give me
your happiest memory...

185
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:58,009
in your life as a return.

186
00:13:58,610 --> 00:13:59,610
What do you say?

187
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:00,639
I say yes.

188
00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:06,379
What will you do
if you get 10 minutes, Han Byul?

189
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:08,149
- Play police.
- Again?

190
00:14:08,149 --> 00:14:10,450
I'm going to help you
with your work.

191
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,789
Then now, agent Kang Han Byul.

192
00:14:13,789 --> 00:14:16,929
Hide yourself. Start.

193
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:46,620
Honey.

194
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:48,490
What's wrong? Are you okay?

195
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:52,460
Are you really okay?

196
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:54,399
Yes.

197
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:56,429
I'm fine.

198
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,039
What did the doctor say?

199
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,940
What?
Is there something wrong?

200
00:15:02,909 --> 00:15:04,679
Are you really a profiler?

201
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,909
Why can't you figure it out?

202
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:10,610
Then...

203
00:15:11,419 --> 00:15:13,879
He said I'm healthy.
It's been 8 weeks.

204
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:25,330
(Personal Details Report)

205
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:27,929
If there is another voice inside
your head shouting,

206
00:15:29,299 --> 00:15:30,929
don't hide it.

207
00:15:32,169 --> 00:15:34,710
That's the most violent thing
you can do to yourself.

208
00:15:38,409 --> 00:15:40,610
That's what you told me before.

209
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:43,409
You need to help.

210
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:50,850
Did you get to meet Sun Woo today?

211
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,259
She called.

212
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:58,100
We're having a second child soon.

213
00:15:58,259 --> 00:16:00,559
You should return to your job now,
Team Manager Kang.

214
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:05,500
If it's something...

215
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,600
Han Byul and I can't do,
you have to overcome alone.

216
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:12,539
Try going back and fighting it.

217
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:14,809
Han Byul and I will guard the house.

218
00:16:25,159 --> 00:16:27,490
What should we name the baby?

219
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:36,269
The first missing person was from
Dochon-dong last December.

220
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,799
A month after, it was Sungsin-dong.

221
00:16:39,139 --> 00:16:40,600
Last month in Hwabok-dong.

222
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:43,210
And this time,
it's Ilyang Dunsan-dong.

223
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:46,539
It all happened around west of
Seoul and Gyeonggi Province.

224
00:16:46,539 --> 00:16:48,379
What's the result of
victims' autopsy?

225
00:16:48,379 --> 00:16:49,480
There were both...

226
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,879
evidence of strangulation and stab
wounds found on the victims' bodies.

227
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:53,879
Was it the knife first
or strangling first?

228
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:56,250
First, he strangled them until
they were unconscious.

229
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:57,889
Then he stabbed them with a knife.

230
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:01,889
From the second murder,
the suspect used a belt.

231
00:17:01,889 --> 00:17:03,830
At first, he used his bare hands,

232
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:05,799
then he realized it took too long.

233
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:09,299
If you see here, the suspect cut
the victim's nails.

234
00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:10,700
According to the analysis,

235
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,569
there were traces...

236
00:17:12,569 --> 00:17:14,640
of ethanol
under the nails of victims.

237
00:17:14,769 --> 00:17:18,039
It seems he tried to destroy
any possible evidence.

238
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,779
The suspect is learning thoroughly.

239
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:25,019
He is coming up with a plan...

240
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:27,720
to become a better murderer.

241
00:17:29,789 --> 00:17:32,319
Officer, you got the wrong guy.

242
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:35,990
Team Manager.

243
00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:38,059
He's not the guy. Let him go.

244
00:17:38,059 --> 00:17:39,059
Let me see.

245
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:42,170
Can you be responsible
for your claims?

246
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:44,799
Since March, 2016 until February of
this year, Choi Jae Man has been...

247
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,569
working at a delivery company.

248
00:17:46,839 --> 00:17:49,039
He was fired every time
after a few months.

249
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:52,009
What? He was fired every time...

250
00:17:52,509 --> 00:17:53,680
due to car accidents.

251
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,250
So you think it's insurance fraud?

252
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:02,720
That is not related.

253
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,250
Squad Chief.

254
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,359
This is from Choi Jae Man's house.

255
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,829
It's medicine to treat narcolepsy.

256
00:18:07,829 --> 00:18:10,930
This is his medical record that
he tested for the sleep problem.

257
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,299
So what you're saying...

258
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:14,930
is that he was working
without telling them of narcolepsy,

259
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:16,430
and kept getting into car accidents?

260
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:18,670
He's getting worse,

261
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:20,569
so he stopped working
since the beginning of this year.

262
00:18:20,569 --> 00:18:21,970
What I'm saying...

263
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:24,980
is the suspect can't commit a crime
that requires driving.

264
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:27,809
So? Are you trying to...

265
00:18:27,809 --> 00:18:30,609
bring up that Sananbo missing
persons case?

266
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:31,849
Is that it?

267
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,349
Please come in.

268
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:44,430
Please introduce yourselves.

269
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:46,730
We're NIS special crime team,
and we'll work in conjunction...

270
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:49,769
with you starting today
on the Park In Hye case.

271
00:18:49,769 --> 00:18:52,170
I'm NCI's behavior analyst,
Ha Sun Woo.

272
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:54,240
This is professor Lee Han,
a psychological analyst.

273
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:57,269
I'm Yoo Min Young
in charge of the media.

274
00:18:57,269 --> 00:18:58,880
Work in conjunction my foot.

275
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,910
You should be grateful
for no one dying.

276
00:19:01,509 --> 00:19:02,549
I'm leaving, sir.

277
00:19:02,779 --> 00:19:04,410
Hey. Where are you going?

278
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:05,650
That jerk.

279
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:11,559
We'll go over all the investigation
records and the suspect list.

280
00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:12,920
Please cooperate.

281
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:15,190
From now on, we'll call it...

282
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:17,960
the Southwestern Gyeonggi Province
Serial Murder Case.

283
00:19:18,299 --> 00:19:20,200
The first victim is Kim Yoo Bin.

284
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,230
She went missing
last year on December 4.

285
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:26,869
Yoo Sun Young went missing on the
last day of holidays, January 30.

286
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:30,170
Kang In Ha went missing on
Congressional Election Day, March 6.

287
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:33,180
Including Park In Hye's day of
disappearance, April 9, they all...

288
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:34,880
went missing on a national holiday.

289
00:19:35,009 --> 00:19:36,480
Following the SPSS law,

290
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,250
it is less than one percent...

291
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,650
that it can be coincidence.

292
00:19:39,819 --> 00:19:42,589
When profiling defines
it a serial murder,

293
00:19:42,589 --> 00:19:44,759
there are characteristics
of crime, and victims...

294
00:19:44,789 --> 00:19:46,220
and the characteristic
of a situation.

295
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:48,589
All three elements match.

296
00:19:48,589 --> 00:19:49,960
When looking at the crime method,

297
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,960
it seems the suspect has obsession.

298
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,730
It is also shown in
its unique murder pattern.

299
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:56,299
If we go over it once again,

300
00:19:56,299 --> 00:19:58,170
the first victim was found dead...

301
00:19:58,170 --> 00:19:59,539
a week after her abduction
on December 4.

302
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:01,470
The second victim was found
six days after her abduction,

303
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:05,210
and the third victim was found
five days after she disappeared.

304
00:20:06,009 --> 00:20:07,410
According to the profiling...

305
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:08,809
If that's the case,
it'll be four days...

306
00:20:08,809 --> 00:20:09,950
after the disappearance?

307
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:11,720
This is driving me crazy.

308
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:15,549
Because the first investigation
went wrong,

309
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:17,819
we already wasted two days.

310
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:21,329
That means we only have...

311
00:20:21,529 --> 00:20:24,430
48 hours left to save Park In Hye.

312
00:20:26,529 --> 00:20:29,400
We'll switch this
to an open investigation.

313
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,000
You'll be prohibited
from contacting the media.

314
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,539
The investigation report...

315
00:20:33,539 --> 00:20:36,309
will only be done
under the control of NCI.

316
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:39,579
Please note the guideline
that I'll give you now.

317
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:50,349
Hey, Hyun Jun.

318
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:52,220
Eat a lot.

319
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:53,319
Yes, ma'am.

320
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:57,089
I thought you'd go somewhere
else after getting upset,

321
00:20:57,289 --> 00:20:58,329
but you came here again.

322
00:20:58,329 --> 00:20:59,759
You have to eat fast and work.

323
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:01,299
If you don't want it, I'll eat it.

324
00:21:01,299 --> 00:21:02,299
No.

325
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:05,470
Look at me. I've lost weight.

326
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,970
Excuse me. Can you give us
more side dishes please?

327
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:08,970
All right.

328
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,579
What are you doing?
They want side dishes.

329
00:21:16,549 --> 00:21:17,549
Go on.

330
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,279
All right.

331
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:37,970
- Sorry.
- I won't let you come,

332
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:40,640
if you keep doing this.
You should act like a detective.

333
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:43,910
Hey, why do you come home so late?
You're all grown up.

334
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:47,480
How can a detective wear shoes
like that?

335
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:50,309
- You should buy one.
- All right.

336
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,720
Mother, I'll get going.

337
00:21:51,779 --> 00:21:52,980
All right.

338
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,670
There aren't any CCTVs nearby.

339
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:19,579
The abduction happened around here.

340
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:25,819
If Park In Hye got into the car
willingly...

341
00:22:29,589 --> 00:22:30,690
(Personal Details Report)

342
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:33,420
The last place that she used
her credit card.

343
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:36,460
(The last payment was at
5:35pm, Cafe Soo)

344
00:23:32,519 --> 00:23:35,220
(CCTV records at the scene
of the incident)

345
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:38,019
(CCTV in operation)

346
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:46,230
(CCTV in operation)

347
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:18,829
Don't bark, Maru. I'm sorry.

348
00:24:18,829 --> 00:24:20,230
It's fine.

349
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:22,200
I'm Yoo Min Young from NCI.

350
00:24:22,299 --> 00:24:24,299
This is Special Agent
Doctor Lee Han.

351
00:24:24,569 --> 00:24:26,440
I think he knows In Hye is gone.

352
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,039
He won't eat these days,

353
00:24:28,369 --> 00:24:30,339
and he's sensitive around strangers.

354
00:24:30,339 --> 00:24:32,039
Dogs don't feel anything like that.

355
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,609
It's probably because of the smell.

356
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:36,509
He's stressed because of
the apocrine...

357
00:24:36,509 --> 00:24:38,250
released from people's sweat glands.

358
00:24:38,579 --> 00:24:41,890
You look too young to be a doctor.

359
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:43,390
To be accurate,

360
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:44,960
I have two doctor's degrees
in medicine and psychology.

361
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:47,589
My thesis in philosophy
is still being examined.

362
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:50,730
I don't think there's a way
to express one's intelligence.

363
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:53,430
However, if I have to explain,
my IQ is 187,

364
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:55,730
and I can memorize 200 English words
every minute.

365
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:58,269
Yes, I am a genius.

366
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:03,009
It's all right, Maru.

367
00:25:04,109 --> 00:25:08,380
Park Jun Ha, was your sister
interested in classic cars?

368
00:25:09,109 --> 00:25:10,250
How did you know that?

369
00:25:16,289 --> 00:25:17,650
Were you following me?

370
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:19,859
This is your case report, right?

371
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:22,059
Why do you have my case report?

372
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:25,900
Her phone would have been turned off
around here.

373
00:25:26,599 --> 00:25:29,430
It indicates the place where
she was suppressed by the culprit,

374
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:31,569
not the place
where the incident had happened.

375
00:25:33,539 --> 00:25:36,039
I think the victim would have
gotten into...

376
00:25:36,039 --> 00:25:37,210
the culprit's car around here.

377
00:25:37,509 --> 00:25:39,910
It's by the roadside, so the victim
wouldn't have felt uneasy.

378
00:25:40,309 --> 00:25:42,450
There is a CCTV,
but this is a blind spot.

379
00:25:42,809 --> 00:25:45,349
The culprit is smart enough
to know all this.

380
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,720
I traced Park In Hye's phone.

381
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,150
If you connect the possible
route of the culprit,

382
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:52,289
this is how it would look.

383
00:25:54,259 --> 00:25:56,789
Do you always need to
have your say?

384
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:02,299
Then tell me what you think.

385
00:26:02,299 --> 00:26:04,700
It's Kim Hyun Jun. I have a name.

386
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:08,970
I already knew about the things
you said.

387
00:26:09,069 --> 00:26:12,210
The most important thing is to find
out why the culprit...

388
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:13,609
and the victim came back
to this place.

389
00:26:13,609 --> 00:26:14,680
It's me.

390
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:18,549
I think the victim was trying to buy
a used car.

391
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,079
A used car?

392
00:26:21,619 --> 00:26:22,650
All right.

393
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:26,220
It was a test drive.

394
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:30,859
Why? Is something wrong?

395
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:33,730
Let's go. I'll give you a ride.

396
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,799
Why should I ride your car?

397
00:26:42,009 --> 00:26:43,640
Stop! Stop!

398
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:45,579
Stop! Stop!

399
00:26:46,579 --> 00:26:47,609
Hey!

400
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:54,680
When did you start thinking of this
case as more than a missing case?

401
00:26:57,519 --> 00:26:58,589
Kim Hyun Jun.

402
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,990
Were you in the special forces?

403
00:27:02,759 --> 00:27:05,930
You look around whenever
we turn a corner...

404
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:08,730
because it's an old habit
from special training.

405
00:27:09,369 --> 00:27:11,900
The unique tie knot of your shoes...

406
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:13,940
must be a symbol of your troop.

407
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:16,170
You should just drive...

408
00:27:16,269 --> 00:27:19,009
and stop the useless profiling.

409
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:21,210
I don't believe it.

410
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,809
Your way of talking
and your mannerisms...

411
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,779
make you seem like a strong man
on the outside.

412
00:27:28,019 --> 00:27:30,490
However, the neat handwriting,

413
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:33,019
the consistent angles,

414
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:35,859
and the detailed numbering of the
report show your meticulous nature.

415
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:38,559
There's a high possibility...

416
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:40,559
that you're trying to hide
that personality...

417
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:43,730
and act tough because you
didn't have male siblings...

418
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:46,470
or a father when you were young.

419
00:27:50,039 --> 00:27:52,180
You don't think about
others' feelings,

420
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:55,509
you have to say everything
you want to with that arrogant tone,

421
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:58,779
and you touch others' things
without permission.

422
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:03,089
You're probably an only child.

423
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:06,490
And your car has
no accessories at all,

424
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:07,859
not even an air freshener.

425
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:10,859
It makes you seem like
a neat person on the outside,

426
00:28:11,029 --> 00:28:14,660
but in fact, inside,
you're a very complicated person.

427
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:19,069
Do you have family problems?

428
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:25,640
You should answer the call.
Don't mind me.

429
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,680
(There's a call)

430
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,009
It's Ha Sun Woo.

431
00:28:30,349 --> 00:28:32,980
There has been an order to transfer
the investigation HQ to NCI.

432
00:28:33,319 --> 00:28:35,690
You should come to the office
after you're finished.

433
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:37,119
All right.

434
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:53,000
These are the information on
the recent dead bodies.

435
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,299
Thank you.

436
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,240
(Susaek-dong,
Nam Ji Sun Missing Case)

437
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:59,910
(Seoul Unjang Police Station)

438
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,549
(Login records)

439
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,119
There are login records,

440
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:15,359
but there are no traces
of the conversation...

441
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:16,890
nor the other person's
login records.

442
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:20,099
That means someone planted
a virus...

443
00:29:20,099 --> 00:29:21,200
and erased everything.

444
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,430
How about the other victims?

445
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:23,569
I'll take a look.

446
00:29:26,069 --> 00:29:29,140
I found some records of that person
selling used goods.

447
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:32,039
However, there's nothing
on the last trade.

448
00:29:32,809 --> 00:29:35,349
There's nothing.
It's clean.

449
00:30:09,579 --> 00:30:12,180
The culprit chose women
of his type by looking at...

450
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:14,380
the used goods website's
member galleries.

451
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:16,819
It seems like he committed
crimes by luring them...

452
00:30:16,819 --> 00:30:18,450
with different used goods.

453
00:30:18,589 --> 00:30:21,660
The suspect would be a man
in his 20's,

454
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:24,660
who is good with computers
and handsome.

455
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:27,329
We should start by searching
the used goods website...

456
00:30:27,329 --> 00:30:29,269
that all the victims had been using.

457
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:30,799
We have one day left.

458
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:32,839
If we don't find her
within 24 hours,

459
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:34,839
she'll be murdered.

460
00:30:35,509 --> 00:30:36,839
It's already too late.

461
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:39,740
Team Manager Kang,

462
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:43,349
what do you mean it's too late?

463
00:30:44,049 --> 00:30:45,380
Is she already dead?

464
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,450
Who are you?

465
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:51,490
Who are you to say such nonsense?

466
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:53,390
Profiling?

467
00:30:54,059 --> 00:30:56,559
Is this what your profiling
looks like?

468
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:57,859
- Kim Hyun Jun.
- The victim...

469
00:30:57,859 --> 00:31:00,130
could be in grave danger,
and yet you're talking about...

470
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:02,569
how we have 1 or 2 days left.

471
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:10,069
So? You're going to give up again
and let her die?

472
00:31:10,069 --> 00:31:12,039
- Hey, stop it.
- Let go.

473
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:13,880
What are you going to do
about the dead people?

474
00:31:14,109 --> 00:31:15,579
How are you going to...

475
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:17,779
make up for their injustice?

476
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,069
No.

477
00:31:50,549 --> 00:31:53,150
Her nails are cut short
like the other victims.

478
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:56,349
He put clothes on her again
before he dumped her.

479
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:57,619
Just like the autopsy result,

480
00:31:57,619 --> 00:31:59,589
it's evident that he covered
her eyes.

481
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:03,190
Does it mean that
the suspect feels guilty?

482
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:05,430
No, then he wouldn't have chosen...

483
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:07,299
a place like this for abandonment.

484
00:32:07,329 --> 00:32:09,730
This is different from
the previous murder pattern.

485
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:12,970
I see hesitation marks
on this victim.

486
00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:17,269
The suspect kept evolving
by committing more murders,

487
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:18,779
but this time,

488
00:32:18,779 --> 00:32:21,440
he hesitated as if he's committing
murder for the first time.

489
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:24,349
It can't be the pattern of
the same suspect.

490
00:32:24,349 --> 00:32:25,779
If it's done by a same suspect,

491
00:32:25,779 --> 00:32:27,950
it could mean that he has
dissociative identity disorder.

492
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:30,589
Based on all sexual murder cases,

493
00:32:30,589 --> 00:32:32,960
there were no suspect with multiple
personality disorder, and...

494
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:36,390
except for the marks on the body,

495
00:32:36,529 --> 00:32:38,160
everything else matches.

496
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:39,529
Then what would be the reason?

497
00:32:39,529 --> 00:32:41,430
Did he experience
a psychological change?

498
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,130
The suspect is a smart guy.

499
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:45,839
It could be a trap
to confuse the investigation.

500
00:32:47,099 --> 00:32:50,170
He might be watching us
from somewhere.

501
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:00,980
Bypass.

502
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:02,390
Bypass.

503
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:04,420
Are you crazy? He said a pass.

504
00:33:10,859 --> 00:33:12,099
Sang Hyun.

505
00:33:15,799 --> 00:33:17,400
No.

506
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,339
Sang Hyun.

507
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:25,170
Hyun Jun.

508
00:33:25,779 --> 00:33:28,309
What about Sang Hyun?

509
00:33:28,779 --> 00:33:31,910

00:33:59,009 --> 00:34:02,880
(Sang Hyun's grave)

511
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,019
All our agents died
because of that jerk.

512
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:10,519
He must be shameless to come here.

513
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:18,389
Profiling?

514
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:22,000
Is this the profiling...

515
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,070
you do?

516
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:26,670
So? You want to give up again
and let her die?

517
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:33,110
Do you think you were wrong?

518
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:37,349
Well, dead men tell no tales.

519
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:43,619
(Choi Sang Hyun's grave)

520
00:34:43,619 --> 00:34:46,159
If I was sure of my profiling,

521
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,190
it would've been prevented.

522
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:11,210
Team Manager Kang.

523
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:12,619
Yes.

524
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:19,960
Is there something you want to say?

525
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,360
Do you happen to know...

526
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:25,389
Detective Kim Hyun Jun?

527
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,960
Bomb incident site.

528
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,269
He was there as an EOD member.

529
00:35:33,739 --> 00:35:34,739
Team Manager Kang.

530
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:38,539
It's awkward to say this right now.

531
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:40,510
Say it.

532
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:43,309
I'm truly happy that you're back.

533
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:46,019
What?

534
00:35:46,219 --> 00:35:48,619
Oh, me too.

535
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:53,219
Welcome back, Team Manager Kang.

536
00:35:56,989 --> 00:35:57,989
Thank you all.

537
00:35:58,159 --> 00:35:59,199
Team Manager Kang.

538
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:02,269
How did you know Park In Hye...

539
00:36:02,329 --> 00:36:03,699
was already dead?

540
00:36:05,469 --> 00:36:07,599
There was one more victim...

541
00:36:07,969 --> 00:36:09,710
that police did not notice.

542
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:12,710
19-year-old Nam Ji Sun, who went
missing on the 3rd of last month...

543
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:14,179
in Susaek-dong.

544
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:17,110
She was a runaway
when she went missing,

545
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:21,780
so the case went over to the Female
and Youth Division.

546
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:25,019
They thought she died
swept by heavy rain.

547
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:27,019
That makes Park In Hye fifth victim,

548
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,929
not the fourth.

549
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:32,059
That makes the suspect's D-day
three days,

550
00:36:32,559 --> 00:36:34,130
not four days.

551
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:36,599
That's today.

552
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:38,630
Call for a meeting.

553
00:36:39,039 --> 00:36:41,000
I'll profile on the suspect.

554
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,539
I'll tell you
the results of profiling.

555
00:36:43,969 --> 00:36:47,239
The suspect is in his mid-20's
to early 30's.

556
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,780
He's skilled at using computer,
smart...

557
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:52,849
and enjoys murdering so much
that he's addicted.

558
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,920
He's about 170cm tall.

559
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,750
He has
an average or thin body shape,

560
00:36:57,750 --> 00:36:59,119
and is good looking,

561
00:36:59,219 --> 00:37:01,019
but probably doesn't stick out.

562
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:02,760
He lives alone...

563
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:05,429
or even if he has family,
he doesn't see them.

564
00:37:06,159 --> 00:37:09,530
He probably has a job
where he can work alone.

565
00:37:14,539 --> 00:37:17,639
He's very articulate,
and knows the psychology of humans.

566
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:20,079
He could be a salesman.

567
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:23,610
Due to psychological trauma
in his youth,

568
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:27,050
there's a high possibility that
he suffers from paranoia.

569
00:37:27,719 --> 00:37:29,949
He releases the trauma of
his dead parents by abusing...

570
00:37:29,949 --> 00:37:32,760
- and watching the victims.
- Let me go.

571
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:33,760
Please.

572
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,389
For him,

573
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:39,199
murder is a strong method
to show his power.

574
00:37:40,099 --> 00:37:41,630
All the victims...

575
00:37:42,269 --> 00:37:44,070
were sexually harassed.

576
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:47,900
However, since there is no sign of
actual intercourse,

577
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:51,369
we can tell that the suspect
lacks sexual ability.

578
00:37:52,039 --> 00:37:54,710
The suspect must have
a criminal record.

579
00:37:54,909 --> 00:37:56,679
Such as car theft or arson.

580
00:37:57,409 --> 00:38:00,550
There's a high possibility that he
committed crimes since he was young.

581
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:01,579
This means that...

582
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,550
any one of you...

583
00:38:04,219 --> 00:38:06,920
may have met the suspect.

584
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:10,559
One thing that is certain...

585
00:38:11,329 --> 00:38:13,329
is that the suspect will continue
committing murder,

586
00:38:13,329 --> 00:38:16,329
and the cycle will shorten.

587
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:19,469
We need to find the suspect...

588
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:22,139
as soon as we can.

- I mean...
- You need someone to testify...

593
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:56,269
to prove your alibi.

594
00:38:56,269 --> 00:38:57,940
- This is everything you asked for.
- Yes.

595
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:59,579

Sir, this is the data NCI requested.

598
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:06,050
Among the same suspects,

599
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:08,320
I collected ones
with unclear alibis.

600
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,449
Hello, yes, speaking.

What are you doing?

603

Do you work at a call center
or something?

604
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:16,530
Everyone is making phone calls.

605
00:39:16,989 --> 00:39:19,230
If we have a suspect,
we can go arrest him.

606
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:20,429
We shouldn't hand it over.

607
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:22,769
My gosh.

608
00:39:22,769 --> 00:39:24,929

those sneakers.

- Get a new pair.
- Fine. I get it.

612
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:49,760
I should've asked for
their phone number.

613
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,130
Have you been waiting
for a long time?

614
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:58,170
I'm sorry. There was a traffic jam.

They're checking illegal parking
here. I'll need to move.

618
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:10,010
All right.

619

It's for my older brother.

You should drop me off
at the next traffic light.

drop by somewhere.

you told me about

00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:15,559
Hyun Jun, I need to talk to you.
Why don't you pick up?

650
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:17,730
- Gosh.
- Oh, my.

651
00:43:17,730 --> 00:43:18,869
Are you all right?

652
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,469
Call me back when you're not busy.

653
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:22,710
I'm sorry.

654
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:36,989
Goodbye.

655
00:43:40,719 --> 00:43:41,889
Hello.

656
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:43,530
Excuse me.

657
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:47,260
Do you remember this girl?

658
00:43:48,099 --> 00:43:50,230
It's the girl from before.

659
00:43:50,699 --> 00:43:51,900
Did you see where she went?

660
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:53,400
I saw her...

661
00:43:53,769 --> 00:43:55,969
standing over there for a while.

662
00:43:58,570 --> 00:44:00,239
Did she get onto a car?

663
00:44:00,239 --> 00:44:01,909
Yes, she did.

664
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:04,050
Did you see his face?

665
00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:06,550
I saw it from here.

666
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:08,480
I couldn't see his face.

667
00:44:11,719 --> 00:44:14,019
He is the most likely suspect
that fits our profile.

668
00:44:15,659 --> 00:44:17,530
You saw her get into a car, right?

669
00:44:18,059 --> 00:44:19,130
Which car was it?

670
00:44:19,130 --> 00:44:20,199
That is...

671
00:44:22,099 --> 00:44:24,230
Right, it looked like that one.

672
00:44:24,570 --> 00:44:26,670
It was a silver car.

673
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:29,199
Do you mean a SUV?

674
00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:30,539
Do you remember the plate number?

675
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:34,340
I'm sorry but I couldn't see
the license plate number.

Illegal parking control cars have to
be at the same places every time.

678
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:54,900
They would have to check
the same place every 30 minutes.

679
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:57,530
It would have the plate number.

Is anyone there?

686
00:45:23,230 --> 00:45:24,260
Help me!

687
00:45:44,050 --> 00:45:45,079
Hello?

688
00:45:45,079 --> 00:45:49,119
Do you the owner of the car
with the plate number "41 Ma 3118"?

689
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:51,920
Yes, I am.

690
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:55,760
I'm so sorry but I scratched your
car's bumper while parking.

691
00:45:56,019 --> 00:45:57,789
I think you should come out and see.

692
00:46:13,909 --> 00:46:15,210
Wait a moment.

693
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:20,420
Hey.

694
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:24,289
Are you the owner of the car?

695
00:46:25,090 --> 00:46:27,989
I'm sorry. I'm not good at parking.

696
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:30,329
I'm sorry.

697
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Don't move.

698
00:47:11,699 --> 00:47:13,039
Is anyone there?

699
00:47:26,050 --> 00:47:28,780
He must have imprisoned the victims
somewhere else.

700
00:47:29,789 --> 00:47:31,050
Where is he?

701
00:47:31,289 --> 00:47:33,460
He's being interrogated
on the first floor of the office.

702
00:47:36,929 --> 00:47:38,559
Rushing things won't help.

703
00:47:38,929 --> 00:47:41,099
Choi Na Young will still be alive.

704
00:47:41,659 --> 00:47:42,969
How do you know that?

705
00:47:42,969 --> 00:47:45,969
According to our profiling,
he is obsessed with keeping time.

706
00:47:46,130 --> 00:47:48,869
He'd be acting according to
the schedule he has planned.

707
00:47:48,869 --> 00:47:51,769
I told you I don't believe in
such nonsense.

708
00:47:52,269 --> 00:47:53,309
Move.

709
00:48:08,090 --> 00:48:11,630
It doesn't look like
a murderer's room.

710
00:48:12,059 --> 00:48:13,460
It looks like my cousin's room.

711
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:17,500
He must have been with someone.

712
00:48:17,630 --> 00:48:20,039
No, he was playing alone.

713
00:48:22,340 --> 00:48:23,969
By looking at this,

714
00:48:23,969 --> 00:48:25,809
I can figure out his personality.

715
00:48:26,039 --> 00:48:28,239
I can find out if he wanted to earn
scores, if he attacked,

716
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:30,710
or if he was using a trick.

717
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:36,250
He made 187 moves.

718
00:48:36,449 --> 00:48:37,989
He made a new house here...

719
00:48:38,289 --> 00:48:40,360
and left his old house empty.

720
00:48:40,489 --> 00:48:42,019
What is he like then?

721
00:48:42,219 --> 00:48:43,730
He's an extreme assailant.

Team Manager Kang Ki Hyung,
the profiler.

725

the people...

726
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:22,260
that criticized your work?

727
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:24,829
I don't think...

728
00:49:25,070 --> 00:49:28,570
you did anything wrong.

729
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:35,139
There is no way to stop...

730

731
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:40,619
about killing people.

732
00:49:42,119 --> 00:49:43,250
Are you acknowledging...

733
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:45,949
that you have committed murders?

You're right.

Why isn't it turning back on?

757
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:02,519
It won't ever turn back on.

758
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:05,360
It's a fake password
that he forged on purpose.

What are the numbers
below on the screen?

If there are emails or notes
stored in the computer,

The suspect's computer is protected
by the security program Dead Bolt.

770
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:38,860
We have to unlock this
to save the victim.

771
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:40,500
Dead Bolt generates a crack...

772
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:42,699
with a password so that you can't
use the software.

773

It'd be faster go inside

to retrieve the password.

775

But Park Jae Min has no wounds.

777
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:54,940
The autopsy report said...

778
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:58,809
that the victim's eyes had traces
of being taped.

779
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:05,349
He tried to hide himself
just in case.

780

It's not like for someone with
paranoia and OCD...

00:53:33,079 --> 00:53:34,750
there might be an accomplice.

791
00:53:34,750 --> 00:53:35,980
This won't be easy.

But he's obedient.

797
00:53:54,269 --> 00:53:56,139
That means the accomplice
is dominating.

He's arrogant and likes
giving orders.

But he's not smart
like the murderer.

800

He probably...

801
00:54:00,610 --> 00:54:02,480
thinks he's not good looking
enough for women.

802
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:04,250
So he needed someone else.

803

He pretended to protect
Park Jae Min,

804

and tried to treat him like
his lackey.

00:54:40,150 --> 00:54:41,679
Who is Ma Hyun Tae?

815
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:47,260
(Juvenile Probation Office)

816
00:54:51,730 --> 00:54:53,400
I cannot believe this.

817
00:54:54,099 --> 00:54:57,369
I thought he'd be doing well
as a good person.

818
00:54:57,429 --> 00:54:59,500
How could he have done that?

819
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:02,639
I know you were his parole
officer since he was released.

820
00:55:02,639 --> 00:55:04,309
Is there anything you heard?

821
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:07,739
Do you know if someone protected
him inside the detention center?

822
00:55:07,739 --> 00:55:09,010
Gosh, I don't know.

823
00:55:09,010 --> 00:55:12,849
Ji Min never had many friends.

824
00:55:14,119 --> 00:55:15,119
Sir,

825
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:18,190
do you think it can be that friend
he came with once?

826
00:55:19,219 --> 00:55:20,219
Who is that?

827
00:55:22,860 --> 00:55:25,889
It's his friend from the detention
center. His name is Ma Hyun Tae.

828
00:55:26,159 --> 00:55:28,159
Ma Hyun Tae. 25 years old.

829
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:32,070
He's been going in and out
of the center...

830
00:55:32,070 --> 00:55:33,539
since he was 15.

831
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:37,269
He's been questioned for driving
a car under someone else's name.

832
00:55:37,510 --> 00:55:38,610
What is his current address?

833
00:55:38,739 --> 00:55:41,579
He used to work in a car dealer shop
in Youngdaeng-dong.

834
00:55:42,110 --> 00:55:44,280
He recently moved to a nearby
service center.

835
00:55:48,519 --> 00:55:50,150
You first entered...

836
00:55:50,150 --> 00:55:52,320
a youth detention center
when you were 16.

837
00:55:53,190 --> 00:55:54,590
You're timid,

838
00:55:54,789 --> 00:55:56,489
and small.

839
00:55:56,619 --> 00:55:58,789
It must have been tough
to hold out on your own.

840
00:55:59,090 --> 00:56:01,159
You must have needed someone
to protect you.

841
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:05,000
And you probably relied on him
more and more.

842
00:56:09,539 --> 00:56:10,739
Who could that be?

843
00:56:12,539 --> 00:56:13,579
Ma Hyun Tae.

844
00:56:15,610 --> 00:56:17,579
Did he order you to take the woman?

845
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:41,269
Authorities have found leads on...

846
00:56:41,269 --> 00:56:44,170
the Southwest Gyeonggi Province
serial murder case...

847
00:56:44,170 --> 00:56:45,869
that has five victims.

848
00:56:45,869 --> 00:56:48,510
The police revealed that the
perpetrators searched for targets...

849
00:56:48,510 --> 00:56:50,179
on a used goods websites,

850
00:56:50,179 --> 00:56:51,949
and meticulously planned
their course of action...

851
00:56:51,949 --> 00:56:54,119
to prepare for the crime.

852
00:56:54,119 --> 00:56:56,449
This is the 112 report center.
What's the reason for your call?

853
00:56:56,989 --> 00:56:58,050
Hello?

854
00:56:59,519 --> 00:57:00,519
I...

855
00:57:01,519 --> 00:57:04,690
I have something to report.

856
00:58:03,150 --> 00:58:04,150
(Criminal Minds)

857
00:58:04,250 --> 00:58:05,849
There's less than an hour left.

858
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:08,920
People of this sort aren't like
your average criminal.

859
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:10,389
They will risk their lives...

860
00:58:10,389 --> 00:58:13,699
to complete the murder they've
planned out.

861
00:58:13,699 --> 00:58:15,699
You mean like that bomb terrorist?

862
00:58:15,699 --> 00:58:18,130
You're saying we can't
stop him again?

863
00:58:18,699 --> 00:58:19,800
There's not enough time.

864
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:21,300
Na Young is alive.

865
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:22,769
We can save her.

866
00:58:23,340 --> 00:58:24,440
Are you sure?

867
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:27,079
If you're wrong this time, there's
no more chance to save Na Young.

868
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:31,150
We have no other options.

869
00:58:32,210 --> 00:58:33,750
I have to make him talk.
