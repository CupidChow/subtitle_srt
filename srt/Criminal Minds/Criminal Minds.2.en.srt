This is the fourth time.

11
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:44,880
According to the analysis,
we only have about three days...

12
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,520
to save Park In Hye.

13
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:49,920
We're NIS special crime team,
and we'll work in conjunction...

with you starting today
on the Park In Hye case.

Work in conjunction, my foot.

16
00:00:53,659 --> 00:00:56,189
The culprit chose women
of his type by looking at...

17
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:58,560
the used goods website's
member galleries.

18
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,929
It seems like he committed
crimes by luring them...

19
00:01:00,929 --> 00:01:02,799
with different used goods.

20
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:04,069
We have one day left.

21
00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:06,269
If we don't find her
within 24 hours,

22
00:01:06,469 --> 00:01:08,340
she'll be murdered.

23
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,379
It's already too late.

24
00:01:11,409 --> 00:01:12,409
No.

25
00:01:12,409 --> 00:01:15,349
So? You want to give up again
and let her die?

26
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:18,450
Hello? Hello?

27
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:20,390
(The Southwestern Gyeonggi Province
Serial Murder Case)

28
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:24,959
He is the most likely suspect
that fits our profile.

29
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:27,730
Where's Choi Na Young?

30
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:28,760
Who's that?

31
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,599
The body had defense marks.

32
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:33,260
But Park Jae Min has no wounds.

33
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,730
He has an accomplice.

34
00:01:34,769 --> 00:01:37,469
He spent three years in a youth
detention center for theft.

35
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,340
It's his friend from the detention
center.

36
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:42,670
His name is Ma Hyun Tae.

37
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:45,010
Ma Hyun Tae. 25 years old.

38
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,349
He's been going in and out
of the center...

39
00:01:47,349 --> 00:01:48,879
since he was 15.

40
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:50,079
What is his current address?

41
00:01:50,379 --> 00:01:51,920
You first entered...

42
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,219
a youth detention center
when you were 16.

43
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:56,590
You're timid,

44
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:58,519
and small.

45
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:00,689
It must have been tough
to hold out on your own.

46
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:03,030
You must have needed someone
to protect you.

47
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:06,829
And you probably relied on him
more and more.

48
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,569
Who could that be?

49
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:15,409
Ma Hyun Tae.

50
00:02:17,409 --> 00:02:19,379
Did he order you to take the woman?

51
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,189
They don't turn the lights off
even at night...

52
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:29,620
in the youth detention center.

53
00:02:30,789 --> 00:02:32,689
So that we can watch each other...

54
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,360
just in case anyone commits suicide.

55
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:39,629
Usually, the leader of the room is
in charge of it.

56
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,830
Ma Hyun Tae was the leader,

57
00:02:42,129 --> 00:02:43,569
and I was the second.

58
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:46,770
Then one day, some kid...

59
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:49,569
sharpened his toothbrush...

60
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:51,479
and slit his wrist.

61
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:53,580
Look at him.

62
00:02:54,849 --> 00:02:57,150
After he was treated
in the medical room,

63
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,919
Ma Hyun Tae took him
to the furnace room, and then...

64
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:02,189
he handed me a pipe.

65
00:03:03,889 --> 00:03:05,759
He told me to prevent this
from ever happening again.

66
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:09,830
I did what Ma Hyun Tae told me
to do.

67
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:11,759
What the room leader says...

68
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,099
is the law.

69
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:17,270
So...

70
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:19,199
what is it that you want to say?

71
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,909
You only followed
Ma Hyun Tae's order?

72
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,460
Authorities have found leads on...

73
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:46,259
the Southwest Gyeonggi Province
serial murder case...

74
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:48,000
that has five victims.

75
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,639
The police revealed that the
perpetrators searched for targets...

76
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:52,340
on a used goods websites,

77
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,139
and meticulously planned
their course of action...

78
00:03:54,139 --> 00:03:56,240
to prepare for the crime.

79
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,639
This is the 112 report center.
What's the reason for your call?

80
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:00,180
Hello?

81
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:02,610
I...

82
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,879
I have something to report.

83
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:04,240
- Are you okay?
- Go follow him.

84
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,920
Go.

85
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,230
He killed Ma Hyun Tae.

86
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,860
We should never miss him.

87
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,860
I'll handle it myself.
Just leave it to me.

88
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,269
Stop the blood with this first.

89
00:05:27,699 --> 00:05:29,170
Focus on your driving.

90
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:30,740
Just do as I say.

91
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:37,540
Team Manager Kang.

92
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,779
Ma Hyun Tae is murdered.

93
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:41,850
We're currently chasing the culprit.

94
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:43,410
I see.

95
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:45,720
Be careful.

96
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,920
Keep me updated.

97
00:05:49,819 --> 00:05:51,220
It sounds very urgent.

98
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,689
Is everything all right?

99
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:59,399
Apparently Ma Hyun Tae got murdered.

100
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:03,170
Oh, really?

101
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,139
You look calm.

102
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:10,779
He always caused troubles.

103
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,139
Who killed Ma Hyun Tae?

104
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,779
I don't know.

105
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:22,019
Who would that be?

106
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:26,189
I mean, I told you already.

107
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,790
This will be...

108
00:06:29,459 --> 00:06:31,029
only the beginning.

109
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:49,639
Watch out for the stroller.

110
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:01,089
What was that?

111
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:03,920
Call the police. Call the police.

112
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:06,019
Are you okay?

113
00:08:08,629 --> 00:08:10,529
Give me your phone.
I'll call the police.

114
00:08:14,629 --> 00:08:15,629
Hey, Lee Han.

115
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,170
The suspect Sun Woo went to see
got murdered.

116
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:21,939
We don't have time. Try
abbreviations or birthdays.

117
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:24,839
Hey.

118
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,139
Are you sleeping?

119
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:30,410
What is it?
Did you think of something?

120
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:32,980
Everything has something to do
with numbers.

121
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,889
He also has chamomile tea and
melatonin. What does that indicate?

122
00:08:35,889 --> 00:08:37,820
They both help with insomnia.

123
00:08:54,669 --> 00:08:55,840
Gosh.

124
00:09:10,889 --> 00:09:12,659
- What is it?
- Let me see.

125
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,559
You have a deep cut.

126
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:18,159
You should have gone
to the hospital.

127
00:09:18,299 --> 00:09:20,029
It's fine. I'll take care of it.

128
00:09:20,029 --> 00:09:21,330
Stay still.

129
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:41,990
Hold on for a moment.

130
00:09:50,659 --> 00:09:51,799
Keep pressure on that.

131
00:10:02,509 --> 00:10:05,279
Did you check the car
I asked you about?

132
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,379
It was a stolen car?

133
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:15,620
Call me as soon as
you locate its whereabouts.

134
00:10:19,889 --> 00:10:22,289
It's okay now. Let's go.

135
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:30,600
It's on the second floor.

136
00:10:33,139 --> 00:10:34,169
Over.

137
00:10:34,169 --> 00:10:35,669
There's no trace of resistance.

138
00:10:35,909 --> 00:10:38,879
He must have been attacked
while he was defenseless.

139
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:44,220
It seems like it was punishment
for betrayal.

140
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,919
It must have been a warning
to someone.

141
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:49,820
I can even see fear in his face.

142
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:52,559
Who could do this?

143
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:54,429
It might not have been simple fear.

144
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:57,629
Are you trying to say it was
a psychological fear like trauma?

145
00:11:05,769 --> 00:11:07,909
- Are you feeling all right?
- I'm fine.

146
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:12,480
How is Park Jae Min?

147
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:14,149
It's as we expected.

148
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:17,250
He's clever,
but he's getting tired.

149
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:20,820
We need to tighten
our grip on his throat...

150
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:22,590
at one go.

151
00:11:26,659 --> 00:11:30,830
He has a passport and a brochure
for a passenger terminal.

152
00:11:33,429 --> 00:11:35,600
And he was calling the police
before he died.

153
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,200
What do you think that means?

154
00:11:39,139 --> 00:11:41,639
He must have been trying to
run away from the culprit.

155
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:45,110
Where do we start?

156
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,740
The youth detention center.

157
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,809
Something must have happened there.

158
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,879
Something must have happened...

159
00:11:53,149 --> 00:11:56,019
between Park Jae Min, Ma Hyun Tae,
and someone else...

160
00:11:56,389 --> 00:11:59,990
who has ordered Park Jae Min to
kill women and killed Ma Hyun Tae...

161
00:12:00,659 --> 00:12:02,330
to keep him quiet.

162
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:11,600
I can drive.
Why are you so stubborn?

163
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,799
It's fine.

164
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:15,070
We'll be there soon.
You should get some sleep.

165
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,509
You asked me how I knew the victim.

166
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,820
Do you remember
the hospital explosion...

167
00:12:25,649 --> 00:12:27,350
that happened a year ago?

168
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:30,960
Yes, but how is that related?

169
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,990
Na Young...

170
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:37,429
is the sister of my colleague
who died in the accident.

171
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:50,139
I was a police officer too.

172
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:55,450
I was in the Violent Crimes Unit
to meet the female quota...

173
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:58,149
and had to make coffee and
dinner reservations for two years.

174
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,549
All I did was organizing
sports day programs.

175
00:13:01,149 --> 00:13:03,549
I was never sent to the field.

176
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,789
They said it'd only cause them
trouble if I got hurt on site.

177
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:11,299
It only made me motivated.

178
00:13:13,029 --> 00:13:15,370
And that's what led me here.

179
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:20,100
I'm not complaining.
I'm just trying to say...

180
00:13:21,139 --> 00:13:22,669
I understand you.

181
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,980
Na Young is alive.

182
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:30,210
And we can save her.

183
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,600
The cat must be feeling lonely
without the owner.

184
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:54,470
What is it? Are you going to
talk about smells...

185
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:55,740
or something strange like that?

186
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:58,840
Cats could have germs called
toxoplasma gondii.

187
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,379
The probability of dying is
1.5 times higher if...

188
00:14:01,379 --> 00:14:02,909
- Then this...
- Oh my goodness.

189
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,220
We have one more chance now.

190
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,960
Wait.

191
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,460
What is it?

192
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:22,470
To a man living alone,
what would his cat...

193
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:24,169
mean to him?

194
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:27,539
It'd be like a family to him.

195
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:31,110
He went into youth detention center
after his father left him.

196
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:34,210
Some people who haven't been
loved by their parents...

197
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:36,379
have pets to give their love
to something weak...

198
00:14:36,379 --> 00:14:37,879
as a compensation.

199
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,789
Filius.

200
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:50,029
It's Latin for a son or a child.

201
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:52,860
You know this is the last chance,
right?

202
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:35,740
Yes.

203
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,879
- We don't have anything yet.
- Min Young.

204
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:41,779
Min Young, Min Young!
Min Young, Min Young!

205
00:15:42,379 --> 00:15:43,509
What?

206
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,360
I'm going to ask you a question.

207
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:56,490
There's something
I don't understand.

208
00:15:59,629 --> 00:16:00,759
Go ahead.

209
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,440
If what you said was true,
you would have been...

210
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,899
the second-in-command among
the children at the center.

211
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:10,340
You remember everything I say?

212
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:12,009
I never forget important things.

213
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:15,210
Even more so if it's a lie.

214
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:20,820
The more important thing is...

215
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:26,259
who was the boy
that slit his wrist...

216
00:16:26,259 --> 00:16:28,059
with a toothbrush?

217
00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:47,440
Scumbag.

218
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:50,480
I think...

219
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,220
it was you.

220
00:16:58,559 --> 00:16:59,690
Stop it!

221
00:17:04,759 --> 00:17:07,059
Should I keep going?

222
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:10,769
Or do you want to tell me?

223
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:27,950
I remember him. He had a hard time.

224
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:30,549
Children bullied him too.

225
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,690
Did anything strange happen?

226
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:37,329
That is...

227
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:39,799
Someone's life depends on this.

228
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,299
Please.

229
00:17:43,369 --> 00:17:46,700
Around that time,
one child was found dead...

230
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,640
in the boiler room.

231
00:17:51,579 --> 00:17:56,150
These two were the last witnesses
to have seen him.

232
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:57,480
(Prisoner Details)

233
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,519
But they wouldn't say anything.

234
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:05,990
The superiors wanted to keep it
quiet and settled it as an accident.

235
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:08,730
So neither of them talked?

236
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:10,130
No.

237
00:18:11,089 --> 00:18:13,430
They looked really scared...

238
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:16,329
and sat there quietly.

239
00:18:18,369 --> 00:18:19,799
Right there.

240
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,049
That day...

241
00:18:35,019 --> 00:18:36,789
I was hung upside down...

242
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,559
in a dark furnace room.

243
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:42,960
In front of me,

244
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:46,259
Ma Hyun Tae and the second leader
were standing there with a pipe.

245
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:58,809
They beat me so much...

246
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:02,880
that I didn't feel anything.

247
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:05,680
That's when...

248
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:08,089
they untied me.

249
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:11,490
I wondered...

250
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,019
if it's over now.

251
00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:16,589
But...

252
00:19:18,029 --> 00:19:19,599
I was wrong.

253
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:22,900
Kids that age...

254
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,740
don't know when to stop.

255
00:19:28,769 --> 00:19:30,410
Ma Hyun Tae came up and...

256
00:19:31,339 --> 00:19:32,809
took my pants off.

257
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:38,380
Then the second leader walked up.

258
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,920
He said he will make me...

259
00:19:43,089 --> 00:19:45,190
never to think of
committing suicide.

260
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,339
What next?

261
00:20:09,809 --> 00:20:10,910
But then...

262
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:14,279
someone came down to the basement.

263
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:17,990
Everyone was so surprised...

264
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:21,630
that they just froze.

265
00:20:23,329 --> 00:20:25,359
That person came up to me.

266
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:27,630
Then he said...

267
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:29,769
Do you want me to kill
one of them?

268
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,009
Then...

269
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:37,170
what will do you for me?

270
00:20:37,539 --> 00:20:39,880
I'll do anything.
I'll do anything for you.

271
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,650
Let's stay together until the end.

272
00:20:42,009 --> 00:20:43,109
There, there.

273
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:47,180
Now, which one? Pick one.

274
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,819
Which one?

275
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:59,559
I'm sorry. I'll never do it again.

276
00:21:00,099 --> 00:21:02,099
I'm so sorry, Jae Min.

277
00:21:02,329 --> 00:21:03,529
I'll never do it again.

278
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:05,740
Jae Min, I'm begging you. Jae Min.

279
00:21:05,769 --> 00:21:07,269
I'm begging you.

280
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:13,579
I'm sorry.

281
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:15,450
I'm sorry.

282
00:21:19,579 --> 00:21:20,680
I'm sorry.

283
00:21:23,589 --> 00:21:24,920
I'm sorry.

284
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,920
I'm sorry.

285
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:27,259
I'm sorry.

286
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:45,480
This is...

287
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:50,009
what happened in the furnace room
that day.

288
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,920
Who is that man?

289
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:56,420
I can't say.

290
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:58,759
Tell me who he is. Who is he?

291
00:22:02,589 --> 00:22:05,230
I can't say it. I can't say it!

292
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,200
You don't have to say it.

293
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,900
I already found who he is.

294
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:17,509
A correctional officer?

295
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:18,980
Yes.

296
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:21,309
Someone so close to figure out...

297
00:22:21,309 --> 00:22:22,950
the relationship of two people.

298
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:25,920
A person who has the power
to subdue the kids easily.

299
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:29,119
It's the list of guards who worked
there from 2011 until now.

300
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:30,519
Everything from age, height,
family, address,

301
00:22:30,519 --> 00:22:32,119
and even the medical record.

302
00:22:32,289 --> 00:22:34,059
I got all of it.

303
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:53,480
There's no suspicious guard
to be the suspect.

304
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,849
- Hello.
- Hello.

305
00:23:01,619 --> 00:23:02,619
Excuse me.

306
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,119
What does he do?

307
00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:08,630
He's a probation officer.

308
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:10,660
There are correction programs
held regularly.

309
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:13,900
A probation officer?

310
00:23:15,029 --> 00:23:17,430
Someone who can walk in and out of
here freely,

311
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,339
and has the same level of power
as the guards.

312
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,339
Someone who has a relationship with
both Park Jae Min and Ma Hyun Tae...

313
00:23:22,339 --> 00:23:23,769
and has paranoia.

314
00:23:24,609 --> 00:23:27,480
Jae Min didn't have many friends.

315
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:30,809
Could it be anyone who came
with Jae Min?

316
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:33,420
Ahn Sang Cheol.

317
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:39,059
Do you still see illusions
when you set fire?

318
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:40,420
Yes.

319
00:23:42,029 --> 00:23:43,890
They don't disappear.

320
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:46,960
Actually...

321
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:48,730
Yes?

322
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:51,069
I imagine stabbing women...

323
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:53,200
every time I do that.

324
00:23:55,369 --> 00:23:56,539
I see.

325
00:23:58,039 --> 00:24:00,039
Do you set fire every time...

326
00:24:00,779 --> 00:24:01,880
you have those thoughts?

327
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:04,109
Yes.

328
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:06,420
Mr. Ahn.

329
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:09,349
What should I do?

330
00:24:11,349 --> 00:24:14,160
A punk like you can't do anything
but to listen to me.

331
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:15,990
Pardon?

332
00:24:16,759 --> 00:24:18,460
Why would you start a fire?

333
00:24:19,859 --> 00:24:20,859
You should rather...

334
00:24:22,029 --> 00:24:23,630
kill women for real.

335
00:24:26,869 --> 00:24:27,970
Hey, look at me.

336
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:30,170
What do you say?

337
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:32,079
Do you want me to help you?

338
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:35,079
Yes?

339
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:45,259
Yes?

340
00:24:45,259 --> 00:24:48,390
Can you help me for real?

341
00:24:58,599 --> 00:25:00,599
We don't have time to wait.
We should just go in.

342
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:01,710
Do you think he would...

343
00:25:02,109 --> 00:25:03,710
confess when he's caught?

344
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:05,940
What if there's another accomplice?

345
00:25:07,009 --> 00:25:08,480
Let's wait for a bit now.

346
00:25:08,779 --> 00:25:10,650
They're working out the location
with the video.

347
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,150
It's me. How did it go?

348
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:18,920
He deliberately changed
the IP address.

349
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,490
It will take some time.

350
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,890
Okay. Call me
as soon as you find anything.

351
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,160
We don't have any other choice.

352
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,769
We must capture him
and make him confess.

353
00:25:29,799 --> 00:25:30,799
Wait.

354
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:36,470
Ahn Sang Cheol is moving.

355
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:02,630
Something's off.
Let's stop the car.

356
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:05,339
- What?
- There's no one on the street,

357
00:26:05,339 --> 00:26:06,670
but he stopped at the red light.

358
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:08,609
He doesn't forget to turn
on the signal.

359
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:10,710
He slows down for the yellow light.

360
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:13,940
Does he look like a murderer who is
on the way to get rid of his victim?

361
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:16,049
Ahn Sang Cheol has paranoia.

362
00:26:16,049 --> 00:26:19,349
Obeying the traffic law can be
a sign of paranoia.

363
00:26:19,349 --> 00:26:20,549
Paranoia?

364
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:23,450
No.

365
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,960
If he's obsessed to obey
the traffic law, he wouldn't...

366
00:26:26,089 --> 00:26:27,960
cross the stop line.

367
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:36,500
Let's stop the car for now.

368
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:51,009
Get out of the vehicle, punk!

369
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:07,559
Can we watch this
with maximum speed?

370
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:09,960
Okay, wait a minute.

371
00:28:12,829 --> 00:28:14,230
Stop. It's right there.

372
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:17,670
Do you see that? The wire is linked
to the light bulb.

373
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:20,299
Yes, but what about it?

374
00:28:20,299 --> 00:28:23,369
Let's focus on the light bulb and
watch it every 12 seconds.

375
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,039
All right.

376
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,779
Stop. Right there.

377
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:34,750
It's swinging back and forth
like a pendulum.

378
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:37,950
Can you see that it's swinging back
and forth at a constant speed?

379
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:39,460
Yes, I see it.

380
00:28:39,559 --> 00:28:42,730
It could mean that
the floor is slanted or...

381
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:44,630
It could be the subway.

382
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:46,630
I know because I've lived near one.

383
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:49,400
Every time the train passed by,
my room used to shake a little.

384
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,099
But it's too slow for that.

385
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,400
It's not because of the floor.

386
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:54,700
The light bulb is
swinging consistently...

387
00:28:57,869 --> 00:28:58,940
because of the waves.

388
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,079
It must be floating on water.

389
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:03,549
What?

390
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:05,950
It's a boat? Where?

391
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:09,450
The only place that can send
real time videos is Han River.

392
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:12,819
But there are more than 600
ships or storage units...

393
00:29:12,819 --> 00:29:14,019
docked near Han River.

394
00:29:14,019 --> 00:29:16,990
I found ones within the 30km radius
considering the moving distance.

395
00:29:18,329 --> 00:29:20,230
There's a high possibility
that it's one of these three.

396
00:29:20,299 --> 00:29:21,799
Can you get more specific locations?

397
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:24,529
For now, this is all we can do.

398
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:27,500
What should we do?
We barely have an hour left.

399
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:34,339
We need to do something
to make Park Jae Min talk.

400
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,079
I'll need everyone's help.

401
00:29:42,549 --> 00:29:46,289
Bring everyone in the building
to this place.

402
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:49,390
We must make him think that...

403
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:51,430
we're all focused on this case.

404
00:29:51,529 --> 00:29:54,630
And before the interrogation, lower
the temperature as much as possible.

405
00:29:54,759 --> 00:29:57,630
If his body temperature goes down,
his brain will work slower.

406
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:58,900
Yes, sir.

407
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:03,539
Fill the boxes with files.

408
00:30:03,539 --> 00:30:05,210
Put everything in,
even blank papers.

409
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:08,880
And write down names next to them.

410
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:11,750
Whose names?

411
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,890
(Ahn Sang Cheol)

412
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:21,559
These are all the documents
related to this serial murder case.

413
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:26,559
And it's all about one person.

414
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:30,299
He was arrested at last.

415
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:32,339
We're bringing him here.

416
00:30:35,509 --> 00:30:38,410
We want him, not you.

417
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:44,710
He told us that it was your idea
to lock the women inside the boat.

418
00:30:47,019 --> 00:30:50,789
He's already trying to blame you
for everything he did,

419
00:30:50,789 --> 00:30:53,819
while you're here
trying to protect him.

420
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:57,890
Don't lie to me.

421
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:00,029
He won't do that to me.

422
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:03,569
No, people tend to betray others...

423
00:31:03,569 --> 00:31:05,130
once their lives are at risk.

424
00:31:05,299 --> 00:31:08,240
Do you think he'd let you go
like this?

425
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,440
You don't know anything.

426
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:13,680
You don't know my relationship
with him.

427
00:31:14,309 --> 00:31:16,609
You must have thought of him
as a family,

428
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:19,619
while resenting your parents
that left you.

429
00:31:19,619 --> 00:31:22,819
So, where did that lead you?

430
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:29,630
Come to your senses.

431
00:31:30,829 --> 00:31:33,700
Ahn Sang Cheol is trying to
use your innocent mind.

432
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,099
He's worse than Ma Hyun Tae.

433
00:31:35,099 --> 00:31:37,730
He's a murderer
who is trying to use you.

434
00:31:37,829 --> 00:31:40,299
Shut your mouth. Shut your mouth!

435
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:42,069
Shut it!

436
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,279
I found this from the articles
left by the deceased.

437
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:57,150
It was in the wallet
that belonged to your late father.

438
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,829
Ahn Sang Cheol is not your family.

439
00:32:12,339 --> 00:32:14,170
These people in this picture...

440
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,809
are your real family.

441
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,220
This girl...

442
00:32:28,119 --> 00:32:29,549
isn't dead yet.

443
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:33,990
Jae Min, tell us where she is.

444
00:32:34,859 --> 00:32:38,960
We still have a chance to save her
and return her to her family.

445
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,079
We can get there first.

446
00:32:55,079 --> 00:32:56,509
We should wait for backup.

447
00:32:56,509 --> 00:32:59,420
No, I won't wait this time.

448
00:33:22,869 --> 00:33:24,039
It's here.

449
00:33:58,670 --> 00:33:59,779
Oh my goodness.

450
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:30,440
We don't have time.

451
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:31,940
Follow me.

452
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,340
Follow me.

453
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,550
There's no one inside.

454
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:42,949
Ahn Sang Cheol must have taken her.

455
00:34:42,949 --> 00:34:44,489
He knows that we're after him.

456
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:46,989
Let's divide the team into groups
and search for them.

457
00:34:46,989 --> 00:34:49,659
- I want to go with you.
- I won't let the injured come.

458
00:34:49,659 --> 00:34:51,530
You should stay here as support.

459
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:52,760
I can do it.

460
00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:54,960
This is an order.

461
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:57,369
Follow me.

462
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:13,380
Gosh, it's really hard to climb
this uphill road.

463
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:22,760
We don't have time. Get up.

464
00:35:23,659 --> 00:35:24,960
Get up.

465
00:35:28,969 --> 00:35:30,969
Are you tired?

466
00:35:31,429 --> 00:35:33,800
Let me see. Let me see.

467
00:35:43,579 --> 00:35:45,750
You shouldn't do this to me.

468
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:24,690
I can't see them anywhere.

469
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,360
We have 10 minutes left.

470
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:31,659
Even when he's cornered, he'll be
looking for a quiet moment to kill.

471
00:36:31,829 --> 00:36:33,000
We still have a chance.

472
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
These kinds of people are different
from normal criminals.

473
00:36:37,469 --> 00:36:39,099
They would put
their lives at risk...

474
00:36:39,699 --> 00:36:43,610
to complete the murder
that they have planned.

475
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,940
Just like the bomb terrorist?

476
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:49,280
Are you saying
that we can't stop him?

477
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:50,909
No, we can stop him.

478
00:36:51,579 --> 00:36:53,320
We just have to think like them.

479
00:37:10,769 --> 00:37:12,539
- Kang speaking.
- I looked into the grid...

480
00:37:12,539 --> 00:37:14,400
as you requested...

481
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,809
and found a shutdown youth
training center nearby.

482
00:37:17,809 --> 00:37:19,179
I'll send you the location now.

483
00:37:20,579 --> 00:37:21,679
Any other anomalies?

484
00:37:23,179 --> 00:37:25,349
Okay.
Send me the address right away.

485
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,320
It's this way.

486
00:37:31,889 --> 00:37:34,320
There's a building across the hill
towards east.

487
00:37:34,559 --> 00:37:36,630
He took Choi Na Young there.

488
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:38,929
Are you sure?
What evidence do you have?

489
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:41,630
If we're wrong again, we won't have
any more chances to save her.

490
00:37:41,699 --> 00:37:43,530
It's the youth training center...

491
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:45,170
Ahn Sang Cheol
worked at every weekend.

492
00:37:45,769 --> 00:37:47,170
Before the center closed down,

493
00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:49,469
there was a fire
presumed to be arson.

494
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:52,380
It's the same time he left there.

495
00:37:52,909 --> 00:37:55,440
I'm sure something happened there.

496
00:38:25,139 --> 00:38:27,840
It's almost the time we first met.

497
00:38:28,809 --> 00:38:29,880
Just wait a little longer.

498
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Now,

499
00:38:56,139 --> 00:38:57,139
let me begin.

500
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,369
There you go.

501
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:29,469
Let's see.

502
00:39:30,139 --> 00:39:31,210
No.

503
00:39:33,409 --> 00:39:34,409
Just like that.

504
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:40,179
Ahn Sang Cheol, stop right there.

505
00:39:45,219 --> 00:39:46,260
What is this?

506
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:48,360
Darn it.

507
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:50,889
Shoot me.

508
00:39:51,989 --> 00:39:53,159
I told you to shoot me!

509
00:39:54,929 --> 00:39:56,570
Throw away the gun
if you want her alive.

510
00:39:57,099 --> 00:39:59,400
Or just shoot me, so I can shoot
you too.

511
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,039
But that gun.

512
00:40:03,239 --> 00:40:04,739
Do you even know how to use it?

513
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:07,639
Your thing down there
under your pants.

514
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:09,909
You can't even get that thing up.

515
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:18,289
Stop there.

516
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:20,119
Don't you come any closer!

517
00:40:21,889 --> 00:40:23,159
Help me.

518
00:40:24,659 --> 00:40:27,159
I suppose you never had a chance
to use it anyway.

519
00:40:27,329 --> 00:40:29,030
Shall I say some things about you?

520
00:40:29,929 --> 00:40:31,400
I bet you've never...

521
00:40:31,570 --> 00:40:33,769
actually dated a girl in your life.

522
00:40:34,239 --> 00:40:37,309
You're a lowly scum who doesn't even
have the courage to talk to girls...

523
00:40:37,309 --> 00:40:39,010
without using violence.

524
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:42,440
You used to be at
a youth training center. Why?

525
00:40:43,349 --> 00:40:45,449
You can't forget
what happened there?

526
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:49,619
There,

527
00:40:49,889 --> 00:40:52,920
you asked a girl out for the first
time, but she rejected you.

528
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,360
Since that day, you probably thought
everyone...

529
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:58,230
laughs at you.

530
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:00,699
That's hilarious. He asked you out?

531
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:05,170
Stop blabbering and shut your mouth.

532
00:41:05,969 --> 00:41:07,369
What's wrong?

533
00:41:07,469 --> 00:41:09,869
There's something else you
really want to hide.

534
00:41:10,739 --> 00:41:12,440
It was probably afterwards...

535
00:41:12,809 --> 00:41:15,480
that your thing stopped working.

536
00:41:20,449 --> 00:41:21,579
Look at you.

537
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:28,489
Every time that memory popped up,
you abducted and stabbed women...

538
00:41:28,489 --> 00:41:31,559
because scums like you only
get turned on by things like that.

539
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:34,230
You're just a pathetic
impotent man...

540
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:35,599
with OCD.

541
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:36,670
Am I wrong?

542
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:39,670
Shoot me right now if you want to,
you pervert!

543
00:41:40,199 --> 00:41:41,570
I'll kill you.

544
00:41:50,579 --> 00:41:51,579
Don't move.

545
00:41:51,809 --> 00:41:52,920
Don't resist!

546
00:42:05,429 --> 00:42:06,429
Na Young.

547
00:42:07,059 --> 00:42:09,030
Na Young, wake up. It's me!

548
00:42:09,829 --> 00:42:10,900
Na Young.

549
00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:16,639
It's okay. You're okay.
It's all over.

550
00:42:17,469 --> 00:42:18,469
It's okay.

551
00:42:18,909 --> 00:42:20,909
It's okay. It's okay.

552
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:24,710
It hurts.

553
00:42:28,719 --> 00:42:29,789
Hyun Jun.

554
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:37,460
"The belief..."

555
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:40,130
"in a supernatural source of evil
is not necessary."

556
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:42,400
"Men alone are..."

557
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:44,630
"quite capable of every wickedness."

558
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:46,840
Joseph Conrad.

559
00:43:08,559 --> 00:43:09,989
Last night around 10pm,

560
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:12,130
the victim was safely rescued,

561
00:43:12,389 --> 00:43:15,230
and the suspect Ahn Sang Cheol was
immediately arrested at the scene.

562
00:43:15,559 --> 00:43:18,269
Ahn Sang Cheol is a likely suspect
for the four murders...

563
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,300
and two missing women we've
identified so far.

564
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:23,110
Her makeup looks incredible.

565
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:24,840
How does it look?

566
00:43:25,010 --> 00:43:27,909
It's makeup artist
Nana Hwang's work.

567
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:29,679
It looks natural,

568
00:43:29,679 --> 00:43:30,880
but perfect for her.

569
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:33,280
Then why is your makeup
always all over the top?

570
00:43:33,679 --> 00:43:35,820
The hostage for this recent case...

571
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:36,820
Never mind.

572
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:40,690
Min Young looks best...

573
00:43:40,690 --> 00:43:43,530
when she's in front of reporters.

574
00:43:43,889 --> 00:43:46,300
That's called a
psychological illusion.

575
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:49,599
Just wearing a uniform and standing
up high behind a podium...

576
00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:52,269
makes you look better
than everyone else.

577
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,840
We call this the Lee Han effect.

578
00:43:56,309 --> 00:43:57,309
Let's go.

579
00:43:58,610 --> 00:44:00,679
There's a new pasta place nearby.

580
00:44:00,739 --> 00:44:03,480
Their anchovy pasta is amazing.

581
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:05,010
You'll treat me, right?

582
00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:06,750
I maxed out my card for this month.

583
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:08,550
- Lee Han effect?
- Thank you for treating me.

584
00:44:08,619 --> 00:44:10,389
- Sure.
- Wait for me.

585
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:14,719
Are these the only recommendations
for field agents?

586
00:44:17,289 --> 00:44:20,559
This was added
by Team Manager Kang.

587
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:22,460
(Recommendation for Special
Crimes Unit)

588
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:25,869
Team Manager Kang Ki Hyung
recommended Kim Hyun Jun?

589
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:28,840
This is interesting.

590
00:44:30,639 --> 00:44:34,239
He graduated top in his profiling
class from the police academy.

591
00:44:34,809 --> 00:44:36,579
His background is not bad.

592
00:44:37,679 --> 00:44:38,909
What do you think?

593
00:44:46,019 --> 00:44:49,989
You said CEO Park told you he'll
help you out...

594
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:51,690
if you give him the buildings.

595
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:54,630
He threatened you, which is why
you killed him.

596
00:44:54,630 --> 00:44:57,469
I didn't kill him.

597
00:44:58,230 --> 00:45:00,000
That night, I...

598
00:45:01,369 --> 00:45:03,840
Anyway, it's really not me.

599
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:05,809
How many times
do I have to tell you?

600
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:07,539
If you didn't kill him that night,

601
00:45:07,539 --> 00:45:08,880
give me an alibi.

602
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:11,280
What did you do that night?
Where were you?

603
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:13,420
He didn't do it.
Just let him go.

604
00:45:14,849 --> 00:45:16,519
What are you talking about?

605
00:45:16,519 --> 00:45:19,050
Stabbing someone that hard
with a knife...

606
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:21,190
means intense rage
and self-expression.

607
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:22,360
If the motive's simple,

608
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:24,530
there's no need to be that
complicated and risky.

609
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:29,500
An alibi he can't reveal even
when he's caught as a suspect?

610
00:45:30,670 --> 00:45:32,130
Don't you need to question
a witness?

611
00:45:33,969 --> 00:45:36,409
I think his wife would know better
what he did that night.

612
00:45:36,409 --> 00:45:37,639
That's not true!

613
00:45:40,739 --> 00:45:42,539
Detective, I really can't.

614
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:44,650
I went to a motel that night.

615
00:45:44,650 --> 00:45:46,849
If my wife finds out that I went to
a motel again with another woman,

616
00:45:46,849 --> 00:45:49,380
she'll really kill me.
That'd be a real murder.

617
00:45:50,150 --> 00:45:51,150
What?

618
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:55,659
- My gosh.
- Goodness.

619
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:59,190
Call his wife. Get her to answer.

620
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:00,260
Get her number.

621
00:46:01,929 --> 00:46:02,929
Here.

622
00:46:11,710 --> 00:46:12,710
What is this?

623
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:15,679
It's a recommendation and
application form for the NCI.

624
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:17,610
Have you considered working with us?

625
00:46:19,849 --> 00:46:21,250
Why didn't you say...

626
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:23,449
that you're a profiler?

627
00:46:23,550 --> 00:46:24,619
I told you.

628
00:46:24,889 --> 00:46:26,190
I'm not interested in that.

629
00:46:30,989 --> 00:46:32,690
Do you still think the same way?

630
00:46:35,659 --> 00:46:37,800
Just as I misunderstood you,

631
00:46:38,469 --> 00:46:40,699
silence often creates
misunderstandings.

632
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:44,510
And sometimes, time solves it.

633
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:47,940
What is it that you want to say?

634
00:46:49,909 --> 00:46:52,210
I'm talking about what happened...

635
00:46:54,579 --> 00:46:56,289
that day.

636
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:06,860
Call me if you're interested.

637
00:47:42,730 --> 00:47:44,000
How are you?

638
00:47:47,369 --> 00:47:48,500
Sang Hyeon,

639
00:47:49,269 --> 00:47:52,110
I'm here to tell you
about something.

640
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:57,949
I've blamed NCI for your death.

641
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:03,650
But now, I don't know what to do.

642
00:48:15,159 --> 00:48:17,230
I know that you visit him
every year.

643
00:48:18,630 --> 00:48:20,639
You went to the
Violent Crimes Unit, right?

644
00:48:23,670 --> 00:48:24,969
I need to ask you something...

645
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:27,679
about what happened that day.

646
00:48:31,210 --> 00:48:35,480
Who gave the last order
before the explosion?

647
00:48:37,619 --> 00:48:39,349
Are you still curious about that?

648
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:41,559
There are days...

649
00:48:42,489 --> 00:48:45,690
when toothed wheels of a bicycle
don't fit each other.

650
00:48:47,199 --> 00:48:50,829
It was a day like that for me.

651
00:48:51,969 --> 00:48:53,070
Yes,

652
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:56,409
it was me.

653
00:48:57,769 --> 00:48:59,239
I was wrong.

654
00:49:02,039 --> 00:49:05,909
I couldn't tell you
because of the superiors.

655
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:10,250
In fact, I didn't want to tell you.

656
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:14,389
Why didn't I know then...

657
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:17,489
that the way downhill is so easy?

658
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:20,500
I'm going to spend...

659
00:49:22,699 --> 00:49:26,170
the rest of my life
with an apologetic mind...

660
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:28,400
for all of you.

Do you still have

673
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:12,429
Do you remember...

674
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:14,840
the first case...

675
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:18,070
you took at NCI?

Our job...

678
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:26,980
is to chase people
devoid of humanity.

679
00:52:27,650 --> 00:52:30,090
We have to see people
who are at the very bottom.

680
00:52:31,150 --> 00:52:34,920
Even I see monsters like that
in my dreams.

681
00:52:35,489 --> 00:52:39,159
But when I do, I try to look at
the children that we have saved.

682
00:52:40,230 --> 00:52:43,929
We don't always save children
from these monsters,

683
00:52:44,630 --> 00:52:46,539
but we do enough to feel proud.

Chief Director Baek is
waiting for you. Let's go.

689
00:53:49,099 --> 00:53:50,199
All right.

690
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:05,780
Director Hwang, is that the new
recruit with a bad temper?

691
00:54:05,949 --> 00:54:08,780
Yes, he's so handsome and tall.

692
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:12,449
I can smell the pheromone
of a tough male.

693
00:54:12,820 --> 00:54:15,760
It's wrong to say that pheromones
attract the opposite sex.

694
00:54:15,989 --> 00:54:18,030
Pheromones are released
inside insects...

695
00:54:18,030 --> 00:54:20,730
that induce certain behaviors
or growth.

696
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:24,530
And there is no scientific proof
that people exchange pheromones.

697
00:54:24,630 --> 00:54:27,400
In fact, there is no such thing
as pheromones...

698
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:28,599
between humans.

699

Of course, it's Doctor Lee's lecture
on the world learned from books.

Is today's topic chemistry?

701
00:54:34,179 --> 00:54:35,840
No, it's biology.

702
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:44,119
Someone from Congressman Song's
team was at the forum.

703
00:54:44,349 --> 00:54:45,949
It seemed like they were positive
about it.

704
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:48,519
I passed on the information
to Reporter Hwang,

705
00:54:48,519 --> 00:54:50,590
and it will be included in
a three-page-long editorial column.

706
00:54:50,590 --> 00:54:51,789
Well done.

707
00:54:51,989 --> 00:54:54,860
Tell me the details
when you come back.

708
00:54:54,860 --> 00:54:58,869
Yes, sir. I'll arrive at the office
in two hours.

00:55:10,409 --> 00:55:12,750
Attention all passengers,

710
00:55:13,079 --> 00:55:15,920
there has been an unexpected
incident,

711
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:17,849
and the train has stopped.

712
00:55:17,949 --> 00:55:22,059
Please stay seated
and wait for a moment.

713
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:24,190
Did something happen outside?

714
00:55:24,329 --> 00:55:25,460
It's nothing.

715
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:27,699
I can't be late.

716
00:55:27,699 --> 00:55:29,500
If you wait a little,
it will be fine.

717
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:30,730
You don't have to worry.

718
00:55:31,070 --> 00:55:32,699
The train will depart shortly.

719
00:55:33,070 --> 00:55:34,269

720
00:55:38,739 --> 00:55:39,739

721
00:55:40,010 --> 00:55:41,010

722
00:55:42,309 --> 00:55:43,550
Are you on duty?

723
00:55:43,550 --> 00:55:45,650
Yes. I'm in the NCI.

724
00:55:46,110 --> 00:55:47,920
A murder suspect I was chasing...

725
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:49,679
got hit by a train and died.

726
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:51,949
I think his accomplice is
on this train.

727
00:55:52,489 --> 00:55:54,789
Is there anything I can do
to help?

728
00:55:57,429 --> 00:55:59,230
Just pretend you don't know.

729
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:05,400
What are you doing?
Let go.

730
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:14,840
What?

731
00:56:15,409 --> 00:56:16,409
Don't move!

732
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:23,250
I'll get right on it.

733
00:56:27,289 --> 00:56:28,920
Today is his first day at work.

734
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:30,230
Introduce yourself.

735
00:56:30,329 --> 00:56:33,090
You can introduce yourself
after work.

736
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:36,769
We have a case. Team Manager Kang
called for a meeting.

737
00:56:37,170 --> 00:56:40,099
This is the security feed
from the train car.

738
00:56:40,099 --> 00:56:43,000
There are a total of seven
hostages in the car.

739
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,739
The two dead victims are the police
officer and the attendant.

740
00:56:45,739 --> 00:56:47,510
Wait, pause the feed.

741
00:56:54,449 --> 00:56:55,619
That can't be.

742
00:56:55,719 --> 00:56:56,719
Oh my goodness.

743
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:58,050

I'll kill you!

746
00:57:30,389 --> 00:57:33,250
Min Young's held hostage?

747
00:57:33,590 --> 00:57:35,190
I'll do it. Take me.

748
00:57:35,190 --> 00:57:37,289
It's the legendary serial killer
that had...

749
00:57:37,289 --> 00:57:38,789
the whole country in fear.

750
00:57:39,190 --> 00:57:41,460
We'll take over negotiations
from this point on.

751
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:43,230
He's an omnivore.

752
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:44,429
I'll kill everyone here!

753
00:57:44,429 --> 00:57:46,940
He has murdered people
regardless of age and gender.

754
00:57:47,139 --> 00:57:48,969
The one who reported it
is the culprit.

755
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,510
Are you saying this case
is your fault?

756
00:57:51,670 --> 00:57:52,940
It's all over now.
