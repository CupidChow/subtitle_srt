9
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:42,350
This shooting incident
happened one week after...

10
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:44,979
the first case,
which happened on the 21st.

11
00:00:44,979 --> 00:00:47,420
He will never give up.

12
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:52,659
Actually, shooting incidents are
becoming more frequent every year.

13
00:00:52,689 --> 00:00:54,590
The first round of investigations
were conducted on...

14
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:57,100
people who have easy access to guns
like veterans and military people.

15
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,859
However, it was reported to be
unsuccessful.

16
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:01,399
It won't be easy to chase him.

17
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:03,270
While I was restoring
the data you sent me,

18
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:05,700
I found something.
It's strange.

19
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,739
He thinks he's in full control,
and that...

20
00:01:07,909 --> 00:01:09,510
he is in an equal relationship.

21
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:12,010
But in fact, he would be
feeling anxious.

22
00:01:13,709 --> 00:01:15,209
I think it really was a private gun.

23
00:01:15,209 --> 00:01:18,450
The bullet holes are all
different sizes.

24
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,019
How about black box footages
or witnesses?

25
00:01:20,019 --> 00:01:21,989
It looks blurry on every footage.

26
00:01:21,989 --> 00:01:23,689
He knows what we're after.

27
00:01:23,689 --> 00:01:26,560
A shooting incident has happened
in the middle of the road...

28
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,760
I'm on the way.
Please send backup.

29
00:01:33,099 --> 00:01:35,769
If there is no relationship
between the two,

30
00:01:35,769 --> 00:01:37,840
it could be a random hate crime.

31
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,439
It could be a copycat crime.

32
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,840
Do you mean there are two culprits?

33
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,209
No, there is only one culprit.
He cut the muzzle of the gun.

34
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,709
Gunpowder was mostly found...

35
00:01:48,049 --> 00:01:49,980
on the left cheek of both victims.

36
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,879
They were shot with...

37
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,790
a long-necked rifle through
the window of the passenger seat.

38
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:56,189
He learned from the experience...

39
00:01:56,819 --> 00:01:59,459
what he has to do if he wants to
shoot easily.

40
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:02,959
He's picking up...

41
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:05,760
what it's like to murder.

42
00:02:07,629 --> 00:02:10,240
That's why we must take charge
of this case.

43
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,840
(Episode 8)

44
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:16,669
On the surface, it could seem like
he does not have a motive,

45
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,009
but he does.

46
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:21,849
Could it be based on
a personal rage or grudge?

47
00:02:22,349 --> 00:02:24,620
A Swiss psychiatrist, Hans Beyer,

48
00:02:24,949 --> 00:02:27,750
found the solution for inner
conflicts in violent behaviors...

49
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:31,419
and called murders that came from
such behaviors "Emotional Murder".

50
00:02:31,659 --> 00:02:34,090
It's important that we find out
why he is angry...

51
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,930
and what caused his anger
to explode.

52
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:43,169
What would have caused him
to start acting?

53
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,229
(Manager Kang)

54
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,969
- Hello?
- Jang Gi Tae.

55
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,509
Where are you, scumbag?

56
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:25,080
Do you have any idea how much money
I spent on that hospital director?

57
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,439
How dare you ruin it?

58
00:03:27,009 --> 00:03:28,979
Quit if you can't do it.

59
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:32,650
Sir, I am so sorry,
but something urgent came up.

60
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,020
I will take care of it as soon as
possible. I am so sorry.

61
00:03:36,819 --> 00:03:38,960
Sorry? You're sorry?

62
00:03:39,889 --> 00:03:43,490
If you can't solve this problem,
Chief Kang...

63
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,430
His anger would be the cause, right?

64
00:04:21,069 --> 00:04:23,230
We could say that Korea is...

65
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:24,399
a nation full of anger.

66
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:27,870
We can't just look into this
as violent driving case.

67
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:30,509
The culprit used a gun,

68
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:33,009
and the second incident tells us...

69
00:04:33,209 --> 00:04:36,610
that he murdered the victim
with a clear motive.

70
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,089
We need to find out
what happened to him recently.

71
00:04:41,589 --> 00:04:43,420
Culprits that use strong weapons...

72
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:45,360
like guns to suppress victims...

73
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,129
are usually...

74
00:04:47,129 --> 00:04:49,889
self-defensive and timid.

75
00:04:50,529 --> 00:04:52,699
His job could require
emotional labor.

76
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,569
Like sales work where you have to
deal with people.

77
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:56,730
He would be a man
over the age of 40.

78
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,339
Seeing as...

79
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:01,639
he chose a time when there weren't
a lot of people in the second case,

80
00:05:02,139 --> 00:05:04,240
he would have gotten used to
hiding his anger...

81
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:06,480
and not expressing his feelings
long time ago.

82
00:05:07,709 --> 00:05:08,750
I'm sorry.

83
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,350
Sorry.

84
00:05:10,949 --> 00:05:12,449
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

85
00:05:12,449 --> 00:05:13,620
- What is he doing?
- Gosh.

86
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:14,649
Get out.

87
00:05:14,649 --> 00:05:16,120
Why did he get in?

88
00:05:16,189 --> 00:05:17,490
Get out right now.

89
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,959
Get out.

90
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:26,829
Jung Hee.

91
00:05:26,829 --> 00:05:27,899
Let's go.

92
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:31,240
- Enjoy your meal.
- Enjoy your meal.

93
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,069
You too.

94
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:50,019
He'd always be busy with work,

95
00:05:50,019 --> 00:05:52,360
and he would have gotten used to
studying others' feelings.

96
00:05:52,889 --> 00:05:55,529
He'd also be a perfectionist
who does his work by himself.

97
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:58,899
He would have low self-esteem,
always trying to avoid...

98
00:05:59,129 --> 00:06:00,970
others' criticisms.

99
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:03,399
Moreover, he'd have
a weak personality...

100
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:04,740
and would never express anger.

101
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:05,939
Let go.

102
00:06:05,939 --> 00:06:07,209
Please don't do this.

103
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:09,339
- No.
- Please.

104
00:06:09,339 --> 00:06:11,639
Take it back if you're not going to
sell it to me with the same price.

105
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:14,810
I can't do that.
My superiors will kill me.

106
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:18,050
Mr. Jang, you've been saying that
for three years.

107
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:19,850
You're alive and well.

108
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:21,850
- Please...
- Hello.

109
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:23,550
- This is my last chance.
- Yes.

110
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:24,620
Get out of the way.

111
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:25,790
Hello.

112
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:28,329
Please wait a moment.

113
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:34,569
At one point, it would have become
hard for him to suppress the anger.

114
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:37,139
Can we look at it
psycho-pathologically?

115
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,600
We can.

116
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,509
I need a list of male patients
in their 40s and 50s...

117
00:06:47,649 --> 00:06:51,480
who have received psychotherapy
in Yangchon-dong

118
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,149
Hello.

119
00:06:55,019 --> 00:06:56,720
Thank you for coming.

120
00:06:57,319 --> 00:06:58,319
I'm Kang Ki Hyung.

121
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,589
I'm Head Detective Lee.
Come this way.

122
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:05,430
Come in.

123
00:07:06,899 --> 00:07:08,930
We have been on emergency duty
for three weeks.

124
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:10,399
It's an important case,

125
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:12,370
and the superiors are
pressing on us every hour.

126
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:16,709
We'll set up an investigation
headquarters for this case.

127
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:20,709
We did ask for your help,

128
00:07:20,779 --> 00:07:22,649
- but that's a little...
- But...

129
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,350
it will be
a cooperative investigation.

130
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:27,420
We need your help too.

131
00:07:30,689 --> 00:07:32,220
He learns quickly.

132
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,790
He cut the muzzle of his gun
and changed his car.

133
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:36,829
He committed his second murder
at night...

134
00:07:37,029 --> 00:07:38,100
so as to minimize the danger.

135
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:41,029
His first murder was probably
unintended.

136
00:07:41,029 --> 00:07:42,430
I think so too.

137
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,199
He left a witness.

138
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:47,000
If he didn't intend to
commit a murder,

139
00:07:47,069 --> 00:07:48,839
and it was accidental,

140
00:07:48,939 --> 00:07:51,680
the car from the first accident
would be his real car.

141
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:54,949
Let's announce the profiling
we've done so far...

142
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:56,449
and run a public investigation.

143
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,350
No, it will only stimulate him.

144
00:07:59,649 --> 00:08:03,420
We don't know how he will react.

145
00:08:05,019 --> 00:08:08,290
You know that he'll commit murder
again.

146
00:08:08,589 --> 00:08:11,360
Even if he does, we can't make
rash decisions.

147
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:21,540
The first victim has regained
consciousness.

148
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:31,420
We're from NCI.

149
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,549
We need to check a few things.

150
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:37,889
She told everything she knows
to the police.

151
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,059
Hey, I'm all right.

152
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,399
I can't remember specific details.

153
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:56,070
I can only remember fragments.

154
00:08:57,539 --> 00:09:00,509
You just need to think about
what happened slowly.

155
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:05,950
Close your eyes and imagine you're
back at the time of the incident.

156
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:09,289
Relax.

157
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,990
We're at the scene of the incident.

158
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:19,200
How was the weather?

159
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:21,429
It was nice.

160
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:24,139
It was very nice.

161
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,269
I was calling my friend
on the phone.

162
00:09:28,809 --> 00:09:31,210
I don't know. He doesn't study.

163
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:35,809
There's a car that is
interrupting me.

164
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:37,110
He doesn't listen to me.

165
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,419
I sound the horn,
but it doesn't work.

166
00:09:39,419 --> 00:09:40,419
Yes.

167
00:09:40,549 --> 00:09:43,820
I need to get to my child's school,
but I'm running out of time.

168
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:46,720
Is that why you passed the car?

169
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:50,830
Hey, wait. Excuse me.

170
00:09:51,629 --> 00:09:53,000
What is it?

171
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,070
I kept giving you signs
to go past me.

172
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:56,970
I was calling because of
an urgent matter.

173
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,700
You should drive properly.

174
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,500
Who are you to tell me to stop?

175
00:10:00,769 --> 00:10:02,840
I did act a little rashly.

176
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,740
I was angry too.

177
00:10:05,509 --> 00:10:06,509
What did...

178
00:10:07,509 --> 00:10:09,009
he say to you then?

179
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,990
He could have sounded the horn,

180
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,950
shouted curse words at you,

181
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,019
or done something to threaten you.

182
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:21,929
No.

183
00:10:23,259 --> 00:10:25,100
He couldn't say anything.

184
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,029
I didn't let him speak.

185
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:31,399
I'm always on my edge
whenever I drive.

186
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:34,740
I don't want to seem fragile.

187
00:10:36,539 --> 00:10:39,309
The first case was accidental.

188
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,549
He must have had suppressed anger.

189
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:42,950
It must have exploded.

190
00:10:43,179 --> 00:10:45,120
If the culprit had stimulated
the victim,

191
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,820
the next crime would
follow instantly.

192
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:49,220
This kind of crime is like a drug.

193
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:52,419
And this one especially concerns
shooting targeting random people.

194
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:08,809
Are you crazy?

195
00:11:12,179 --> 00:11:13,740
If the culprit...

196
00:11:17,419 --> 00:11:19,279
created the pattern...

197
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,350
that happened in the first case
again...

198
00:11:23,389 --> 00:11:25,220
He would look for
the next victim soon.

199
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:28,259
He would become uncontrollable.

200
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:08,029
Round and plump body

201
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,440
Wearing a red suit

202
00:12:12,269 --> 00:12:14,539
Sweet and sour smell

203
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:18,539
Dandy tomato. Tomato

204
00:12:49,539 --> 00:12:50,539
Hey.

205
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:53,210
What could I possibly do with him?

206
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,779
I'm only staying with him
because he's pathetic.

207
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,019
I think you should stay home today.

208
00:12:58,049 --> 00:13:00,250
Ji Young. Jang Ji Young.

209
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:02,419
- Hello?
- Hey, Jang Gi Tae.

210
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,950
Where are you?

211
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:07,529
Do you have any idea how much money
I spent on that hospital director?

212
00:13:07,529 --> 00:13:08,889
How dare you ruin it?

213
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:11,629
Quit if you can't do it.

214
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,529
Captain. I'm on the way to the site
as you said.

215
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:51,840
Please wait for a bit.

216
00:15:05,409 --> 00:15:07,809
My gosh. Oh, my gosh.

217
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,980
(NCI Emergency Station)

218
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,090
(I need help.)

219
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,009
Hey. Get off the car.

220
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:11,539
Get off.

221
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,139
Open the door.

222
00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:15,279
Open now.

223
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:18,350
I'll kill you today.

224
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,919
- What's going on?
- Don't take pictures.

225
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:23,250
What's going on?

226
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:24,860
Get off now.

227
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:27,190
Open the door.

228
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:29,360
Open the door.

229
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,529
The police is here.

230
00:16:30,529 --> 00:16:31,659
My goodness.

231
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,899
Come here.

232
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:42,740
I'm arresting you for violence,
damage to property,

233
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:45,610
obstruction of justice
and attempted murder.

234
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:47,409
Attempted murder?

235
00:16:48,409 --> 00:16:50,710
Look at you jerks.

236
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:52,850
She cut in first.

237
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:54,389
I was only teaching her a lesson.

238
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:55,850
Be quiet and follow me.

239
00:17:00,889 --> 00:17:01,889
My goodness.

240
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:19,710
My gosh.

241
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:18,569
Are you okay? I'm not a bad guy.

242
00:18:18,569 --> 00:18:22,039
I've been watching you. You're hurt.

243
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:24,539
I'll call 911.

244
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,210
Oh, my goodness.

245
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:02,210
Oh, my.

246
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:24,799
Are you okay?

247
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:27,500
Are you sure you don't need to
go to the hospital?

248
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:28,900
I'm fine, Captain.

249
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:31,740
Oh, I almost forgot.

250
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:35,640
The list of patients
between age of 40 and 50 ...

251
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,240
who got clinical tests
in Yangchon-dong you asked.

252
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,240
Here.

253
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:42,450
Hello?

254
00:20:46,849 --> 00:20:49,990
There was another shooting
in Route 11.

255
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,720
What?

256
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,680
Let's announce the profiling
we've done so far...

257
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,250
and run a public investigation.

258
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:24,349
You know the criminal will commit
a crime again.

259
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:29,930
Only if we were any faster,

260
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:32,000
she might have survived.

261
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:34,559
The profiling wasn't
perfect enough...

262
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:36,069
to catch the criminal.

263
00:21:36,769 --> 00:21:38,740
No other perfect profiling...

264
00:21:39,099 --> 00:21:41,299
is more important than
saving people.

265
00:21:42,609 --> 00:21:44,140
If that's holding us back,

266
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:46,910
sometimes we need
a different option.

267
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:48,609
Let's stop.

268
00:21:57,690 --> 00:21:58,789
Please say something.

269
00:21:58,789 --> 00:22:00,190
Is the criminal male or female?

270
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:01,490
Please tell us about
the current situation.

271
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:02,690
Please speak.

272
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:05,230
It's the third shooting now.

273
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:06,630
Do you have any clues
on who the criminal is?

274
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:08,369
Please tell us about
the current situation.

275
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:09,529
Are there any more victims?

276
00:22:09,529 --> 00:22:10,769
Please speak.

277
00:22:10,769 --> 00:22:11,799
Please say something.

278
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:12,799
What's going on?

279
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:14,470
Please speak.

280
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:15,640
Please tell us.

281
00:22:18,009 --> 00:22:20,509
Let's make a toast.

282
00:22:21,609 --> 00:22:24,380
For the prosperity of S Pharmacy.

283
00:22:24,579 --> 00:22:25,750
- For S Pharmacy.
- For S Pharmacy.

284
00:22:27,019 --> 00:22:28,220
Sorry, I'm late.

285
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:30,190
Manager Jang.

286
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:44,700
I'm sorry. Sorry.

287
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,069
Thank you.

288
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:49,440
You look great today.

289
00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:55,609
Since Manager Jang is here,
let's make a toast again.

290
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:58,220
For the prosperity of S Pharmacy.

291
00:22:58,549 --> 00:22:59,750
- For S Pharmacy.
- For S Pharmacy.

292
00:23:00,849 --> 00:23:01,990
Long time no see.

293
00:23:08,329 --> 00:23:09,690
I'm glad you could make it.

294
00:23:15,029 --> 00:23:17,630
Are you taking any medication,
Manager Jang?

295
00:23:17,869 --> 00:23:19,440
Your performance is getting better.

296
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:24,140
You must be back to yourself.

297
00:23:26,009 --> 00:23:27,410
Keep up your work.

298
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:30,650
I'm sure it's only a matter of time
until Sales Team Three...

299
00:23:30,779 --> 00:23:32,420
get our reputation back.

300
00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:36,650
We should...

301
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:40,390
beat General Manager Choi
in the next room.

302
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:47,960
Look at you, jerk.

303
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:50,130
Are you happy now?

304
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,400
Are you?

305
00:23:55,109 --> 00:23:57,170
You must be.

306
00:23:58,210 --> 00:24:01,910
You were crawling at the bottom,
but now your performance is great,

307
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:03,779
and you got power too.

308
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,680
Right?

309
00:24:09,319 --> 00:24:10,319
But...

310
00:24:11,349 --> 00:24:12,589
you know...

311
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:17,589
you're only a pawn, right?

312
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:31,839
Hey.

313
00:24:35,009 --> 00:24:36,109
Why you...

314
00:24:37,109 --> 00:24:39,950
If I'm a pawn,
what does that make you?

315
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:41,990
What are you?

316
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:43,190
Are you crazy?

317
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,890
What does that make you?

318
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,759
You crazy little...

319
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:57,869
Fix the project proposal...

320
00:24:58,029 --> 00:25:01,470
I made the day before,
and put it on my table...

321
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,940
before I kill you.

322
00:25:07,109 --> 00:25:08,980
Okay. Okay.

323
00:25:09,349 --> 00:25:10,750
You got it?

324
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:11,849
I got it.

325
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:06,990
Hold on.

326
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,529
What are these places?

327
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,799
Those streets are
under construction.

328
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:16,269
Why do you ask?
Is there something wrong?

329
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:34,980
Please send it
to the situation room.

330
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,019
Yes.

331
00:28:39,289 --> 00:28:41,519
When the victim types are
this apparent,

332
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,259
it means victims...

333
00:28:43,259 --> 00:28:45,059
symbolize something to the criminal.

334
00:28:45,059 --> 00:28:46,700
Who would that be?

335
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:48,630
Team Manager Kang.

336
00:28:50,069 --> 00:28:51,170
You should see this.

337
00:28:57,069 --> 00:28:58,640
Within the incident area,

338
00:28:58,809 --> 00:29:01,009
there are 10 streets under
construction.

339
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:05,420
Among them, these two places
are temporary merging sections.

340
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:07,750
Both places are...

341
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:10,049
within 5km from the site
of incident.

342
00:29:11,589 --> 00:29:15,019
It's the best place for the criminal
to pick a fight.

343
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:17,089
If the first incident was
an accident,

344
00:29:17,259 --> 00:29:18,660
he probably needed...

345
00:29:18,859 --> 00:29:21,130
a similar pattern as the first one
for his next crime.

346
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:24,099
He found
a temporary merging section...

347
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,799
and kept driving that place
over and over again.

348
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,470
Then we'll close down
all temporary merging sections...

349
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:32,309
within the area.

350
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,480
Detective.

351
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,009
Is this street still
under construction?

352
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:38,549
Yes. That's right.

353
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:41,819
There must be a witness
in the construction team.

354
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:44,890
Is it possible to meet the person
in charge from the day of incident?

355
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:47,759
There was one weird guy.

356
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:49,930
At first,

357
00:29:50,329 --> 00:29:52,630
I thought he was lost,
so I kept watching him.

358
00:29:53,299 --> 00:29:57,170
It was weird for someone
to dress up like a punk...

359
00:29:57,329 --> 00:29:58,539
but drive with care.

360
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,970
It's a proof the criminal is
losing reality,

361
00:30:03,369 --> 00:30:05,069
and he started a role play.

362
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:09,509
Is there anything else?

363
00:30:09,779 --> 00:30:11,309
Is there anything else you remember?

364
00:30:11,849 --> 00:30:14,579
When someone passed his car,

365
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,630
he reached his arm out
to the passenger seat.

366
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:38,880
How did he reach out?

367
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:41,910
Like this.

368
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:45,819
Who was sitting next to him?

369
00:30:46,019 --> 00:30:48,079
I checked again to see
if anyone's sitting beside him,

370
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:49,390
but there was no one.

371
00:30:52,589 --> 00:30:55,089
The car the criminal drove
is a family car.

372
00:30:55,329 --> 00:30:56,460
His arm movement...

373
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:59,829
was out of habit
to protect his family.

374
00:31:00,759 --> 00:31:02,369
He has a wife and a child.

375
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:08,670
Team Manager Kang. The criminal was
looking for someone to replace...

376
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:11,240
his wife,
but he's losing reality now.

377
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:14,910
His illusions will move to
real people now.

378
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:17,579
That means his wife and child
are in danger.

379
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:21,250
Hurry up. I need to start
profiling now.

380
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:26,690
Excessive masculine outfit
and action.

381
00:31:27,089 --> 00:31:29,460
His preferred victims are similar.

382
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:33,430
Also, the fact the first cause
of shooting was a woman.

383
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:34,859
All these tell us that...

384
00:31:34,859 --> 00:31:39,000
the criminal's is experiencing
a crisis in his masculinity.

385
00:31:39,069 --> 00:31:40,369
A crisis in masculinity?

386
00:31:41,869 --> 00:31:43,269
I don't understand
what he's talking about.

387
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:45,980
The first victim was a start,

388
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:50,109
but there must be a serious trauma
that caused all this.

389
00:31:50,509 --> 00:31:52,380
The incident must be...

390
00:31:52,519 --> 00:31:56,289
so painful for the criminal
to endure mentally.

391
00:31:56,549 --> 00:32:00,160
Are you saying the criminal is
having some kind of schizophrenia?

392
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:03,829
Somewhat right. The world he sees
has changed,

393
00:32:03,829 --> 00:32:06,000
and his role has changed.

394
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:08,559
He's between the age of 40 to 50
with plain appearance,

395
00:32:08,829 --> 00:32:10,269
and by looking at his crimes,

396
00:32:10,369 --> 00:32:14,299
he's timid and his family probably
doesn't accept him as a breadwinner.

397
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:17,509
He has three cars including
a black sedan, a blue sedan,

398
00:32:17,509 --> 00:32:19,410
and a blue SUV.

399
00:32:19,609 --> 00:32:22,009
By considering the testimony
of the first victim,

400
00:32:22,049 --> 00:32:24,980
the criminal is highly likely to be
a middle-class professional.

401
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:26,380
By looking at his crime pattern,

402
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:30,119
he must be familiar with this area.

403
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:34,789
It's possible that the criminal
can't carry on with the real life.

404
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,559
Since he's out of control,
he could kill...

405
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:40,859
everyone around him
for the worst possible scenario.

406
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:45,299
We're going to make a possible
crime site near construction area...

407
00:32:45,299 --> 00:32:46,539
and lure him out.

408
00:32:48,099 --> 00:32:49,809
- Let's take a look over there.
- Yes.

409
00:32:49,809 --> 00:32:50,809
This way.

410
00:32:52,009 --> 00:32:55,079
There will be a traffic stop
at every street under construction.

411
00:33:07,589 --> 00:33:09,730
We'll reveal the suspect profiling
to the public...

412
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:11,230
for report calls.

413
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:03,210
Manager Jang.

414
00:34:04,049 --> 00:34:05,049
What are you doing?

415
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:06,779
Hey.

416
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,289
Let's go out for lunch. It's on me.

417
00:34:09,289 --> 00:34:10,719
I'm fine.

418
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:12,889
You make me proud lately.

419
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:15,190
You probably suffered a lot.

420
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:17,289
Thank you for overcoming all that.

421
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:21,500
If I ever made you upset,

422
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,130
let it go.

423
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:27,400
What are you going to do
about the hospital supply deal?

424
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,110
Do you know how many deals
you ruined this month?

425
00:34:30,869 --> 00:34:31,869
I'm sorry.

426
00:34:31,869 --> 00:34:32,880
Sorry?

427
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:35,010
Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey.

428
00:35:08,809 --> 00:35:13,079
We're looking for a criminal
for the serial shooting incident.

429
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:17,119
Please listen carefully to
the features of the criminal,

430
00:35:17,289 --> 00:35:19,820
and if it matches the criminal
we're looking for,

431
00:35:20,019 --> 00:35:22,760
please report to the phone number
below.

432
00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:26,530
We're looking for a married man
between the age of 40 and 50.

433
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:30,369
We suspect that
the criminal's wife...

434
00:35:30,369 --> 00:35:33,199
looks similar to these victims.

435
00:35:33,369 --> 00:35:36,039
He drives a black sedan,

436
00:35:36,369 --> 00:35:38,510
a blue SUV, and a blue sedan.

437
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:41,239
He's highly likely to live in
Yangchon-dong area.

438
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:46,019
Also, he must have been shocked
after a serious accident.

439
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:57,489
Hey, Manager Jang.

440
00:35:57,929 --> 00:35:59,300
What's wrong with him?

441
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:02,130
- NCI speaking.
- I was looking up...

442
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:05,300
the accounts that made a purchase
on illegal gun websites.

443
00:36:06,139 --> 00:36:08,670
While I was dividing
men and women...

444
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:11,440
among black sedan owners
in Yangchon-dong,

445
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:14,710
I found someone who matches the
account on an illegal gun website.

446
00:36:17,349 --> 00:36:20,320
The black Granduer owner
who matches the profile...

447
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,619
is a 46-year-old woman
named Hwang Mi Young.

448
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:26,719
She has a history of buying bullets
on the same gun website in June.

449
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:28,960
A woman?

450
00:36:29,389 --> 00:36:33,800
Yes. There are three purchase
records under her name.

451
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:35,400
Have you looked up her spouse?

452
00:36:35,829 --> 00:36:37,000
Okay. Thank you.

453
00:36:39,099 --> 00:36:40,239
I think we found him.

454
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:42,909
He's a salesman at Sewon Pharmacy.

455
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:46,239
Jang Gi Tae.

456
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:48,880
Send me the information.

457
00:36:52,449 --> 00:36:54,179
His colleague in the team called.

458
00:36:54,179 --> 00:36:56,519
He ran out while watching the news.

459
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:00,559
Is there any significance
in his family?

460
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,530
Actually, Captain,

461
00:37:03,389 --> 00:37:05,190
one of his two daughters...

462
00:37:05,829 --> 00:37:08,199
is named Jang Ji Soo.

463
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:19,210
- I want to be tomato ketchup
- I'm almost there.

464
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:23,179
- I want to dance all day long
- She's excited.

465
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:26,579
- Dandy tomato. Tomato.
- She doesn't even sleep.

466
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:29,449
I know. I told you to come.

467
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:32,190
Okay.

468
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:36,230
Dad. Give me Jimmy.

469
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:39,800
Okay. I'll give it to you
when we arrive.

470
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:43,130
- Give it to me now.
- No. I'm driving.

471
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:44,329
Put your seat belt on.

472
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:48,969
Good girl.
Okay, I'll call you later.

473
00:37:48,969 --> 00:37:51,409
Round and plump body

474
00:37:51,409 --> 00:37:52,440
Good job.

475
00:37:52,539 --> 00:37:54,940
Wearing a red suit

476
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:12,059
Dad. Jimmy.

477
00:38:12,059 --> 00:38:13,059
Stay inside.

478
00:38:13,659 --> 00:38:15,829
Close the window. Stay calm.

479
00:38:18,329 --> 00:38:20,739
Dad. Jimmy.

480
00:38:22,139 --> 00:38:23,210
Hello?

481
00:38:23,369 --> 00:38:24,369
Jimmy.

482
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:28,110
Hello? My car broke down.

483
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:31,110
It's 435-8580.

484
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:32,579
Jang Gi Tae.

485
00:38:37,989 --> 00:38:39,389
Ji Soo. Ji Soo.

486
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:50,429
- Ji Soo.
- My goodness.

487
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:52,000
- Ji Soo.
- Ji Soo.

488
00:38:53,139 --> 00:38:54,869
- Hello?
- Ji Soo.

489
00:38:54,869 --> 00:38:56,070
Please save my daughter.

490
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:57,469
- Hello?
- Hello?

491
00:38:57,639 --> 00:38:58,940
- Ji Soo.
- Doctor.

492
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:00,679
- Anyone?
- Oh, my.

493
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,340
Please save my daughter.

494
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,309
Ji Soo.

495
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:13,860
What do you mean?
No insurance money?

496
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:15,789
An illegal parking
on the side of the road?

497
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:18,030
Are you saying that's why I can't
get insurance money?

498
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:20,099
Do you have any idea
how I paid for it?

499
00:39:20,099 --> 00:39:21,699
I need to get the insurance money.

500
00:39:21,699 --> 00:39:24,300
You have no idea
how I earned that money.

501
00:39:24,369 --> 00:39:26,599
I need to get the insurance money.

502
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,409
What do you mean?

503
00:39:29,869 --> 00:39:31,309
Why? Why?

504
00:39:31,639 --> 00:39:34,710
Do you know how hard this is?

505
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:36,510
Do you understand at all?

506
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,320
You need to do something.

507
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,550
Darn it.

508
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:15,420
(Youngest daughter
Jang Ji Soo, dead)

509
00:40:19,519 --> 00:40:21,889
(Serial Shooting Case)

510
00:40:23,730 --> 00:40:25,429
I'll go to the scene
of the incident.

511
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,929
(Youngest daughter
Jang Ji Soo, dead)

512
00:40:49,489 --> 00:40:51,090
Jang Gi Tae is...

513
00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:53,159
blaming his family for everything.

514
00:40:54,159 --> 00:40:57,190
He's avoiding his sufferings as
the situation becomes extreme.

515
00:40:57,389 --> 00:40:59,090
His family is in danger.

516
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:02,329
You are going to meet two friends?

517
00:41:02,599 --> 00:41:03,769
Did you eat?

518
00:41:04,329 --> 00:41:05,400
Of course.

519
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,510
- Honey!
- What...

520
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:11,570
Why are you doing this?

521
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,510
Why are you doing this?

522
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:14,579
Shut your mouth.

523
00:41:14,579 --> 00:41:17,110
All right. Why are you doing this?

524
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:19,250
- Oh, my.
- It's all right.

525
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:21,150
- Honey, why are you doing this?
- Get out.

526
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:22,280
Get out!

527
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:25,320
All right. All right.
Please calm down.

528
00:41:25,719 --> 00:41:27,090
We're going out.

529
00:42:15,099 --> 00:42:17,539
Are you crazy? What are you doing?

530
00:42:17,969 --> 00:42:19,739
Stop the car. Stop it.

531
00:42:19,809 --> 00:42:22,079
Dad, are you going to kill us too?

532
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:24,010
Please, please stop.

533
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:29,949
I can't breathe because of you.

534
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,659
How about me? How about Ji Young?

535
00:42:33,659 --> 00:42:35,659
Do you think we had an easy life?

536
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:38,929
You don't think about Ji Soo.

537
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:42,500
It hasn't been long
since she passed away.

538
00:42:43,199 --> 00:42:44,730
But you guys are all right.

539
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:48,300
It's not like you were the only one
who suffered.

540
00:42:49,309 --> 00:42:50,969
It was hard for us too.

541
00:42:50,969 --> 00:42:53,210
We wanted to die too...

542
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:55,280
while watching you turn weird.

543
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,480
Don't lie.

544
00:43:00,579 --> 00:43:03,019
To you, I don't exist.

545
00:43:05,619 --> 00:43:07,019
You've been...

546
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:10,130
laughing, talking, and living
a normal life by yourselves.

547
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:13,659
No, you don't know anything.

548
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:17,130
We already died
on the day Ji Soo died.

549
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:18,900
You don't deserve to say that.

550
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:22,440
You...

551
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:25,369
On the day she died,

552
00:43:26,239 --> 00:43:28,210
you were only talking about
insurance.

553
00:43:31,579 --> 00:43:32,579
Money.

554
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:34,380
Money.

555
00:43:34,679 --> 00:43:36,619
Money. Money!

556
00:43:37,449 --> 00:43:38,489
Money.

557
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:42,320
You value money more
than our daughter.

558
00:43:42,559 --> 00:43:46,400
You... You promised us
you'll make us happy.

559
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:49,969
But you ruined everything.

560
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:51,329
What?

561
00:43:53,539 --> 00:43:54,599
What?

562
00:43:59,210 --> 00:44:00,239
I...

563
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:03,849
Do you know how miserable
my life was?

564
00:44:04,849 --> 00:44:07,380
I... You think I ruined...

565
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:11,590
In case you have forgotten,

566
00:44:12,719 --> 00:44:14,559
you were always like that.

567
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:16,989
We're not even a family.

568
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:21,900
So please don't judge us
from your perspective.

569
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:24,829
Honey,

570
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:28,469
stop the car.

571
00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:30,969
Please stop the car.

572
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:32,239
Please.

573
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:03,570
- Gi Tae!
- Dad!

574
00:45:03,570 --> 00:45:04,739
- Lower the gun.
- Don't shoot.

575
00:45:04,739 --> 00:45:06,409
- Don't shoot.
- Stop.

576
00:45:06,539 --> 00:45:07,739
- Dad.
- Are you crazy?

577
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:15,179
It's all right.

578
00:45:15,449 --> 00:45:17,019
It's all right.

579
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:18,389
Dad.

580
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:28,460
I'm sorry.

581
00:45:29,099 --> 00:45:30,130
I'm sorry, Ji Young.

582
00:45:32,969 --> 00:45:34,869
It's all right. It's all right.

583
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:22,420
Team Manager Kang.

584
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:36,429
Jang Gi Tae, stop the car.

585
00:46:37,730 --> 00:46:38,869
Stop the car.

586
00:46:51,110 --> 00:46:53,250
Jang Gi Tae, stop the car.

587
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:54,519
Stop the car.

588
00:46:57,889 --> 00:46:59,190
Honey,

589
00:46:59,190 --> 00:47:00,659
grab the handle.

590
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:03,960
Grab the handle. Are you out of
your mind? Why are you doing this?

591
00:47:03,989 --> 00:47:05,130
It's over now.

592
00:48:06,150 --> 00:48:07,219
Don't shoot.

593
00:48:08,119 --> 00:48:09,159
Don't shoot.

594
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:28,880
Help me.

595
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:32,550
Help me.

596
00:48:33,719 --> 00:48:35,579
My family is inside.

597
00:48:36,219 --> 00:48:39,289
Jang Gi Tae, calm down.

598
00:48:40,690 --> 00:48:43,690
I'll look after your family
inside the car.

599
00:48:45,230 --> 00:48:46,659
But drop the gun first.

600
00:48:52,530 --> 00:48:55,769
My daughter... My daughter...

601
00:48:56,139 --> 00:48:58,739
Please saver her. Quickly.

602
00:48:58,739 --> 00:49:01,179
Quickly. Ji Young, Ji Young!

603
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:08,019
Save her.

604
00:49:08,349 --> 00:49:10,489
- Ji Young!
- Bodies that have been...

605
00:49:10,590 --> 00:49:11,989
dead for about 20 days
were in the room.

606
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:14,059
Jang Gi Tae.

607
00:49:15,889 --> 00:49:17,429
It's already over.

608
00:49:17,829 --> 00:49:19,030
What do you mean?

609
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:22,659
My family is inside.

610
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:25,329
- Jang Gi Tae.
- Please save them.

611
00:49:25,329 --> 00:49:28,440
Let me go! Let me go!

612
00:49:29,670 --> 00:49:31,010
Your family has already...

613
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:33,010
Please.

614
00:49:33,539 --> 00:49:35,809
Let me go. Let go!

615
00:49:36,909 --> 00:49:39,579
Ji Young. Ji Young!

616
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:14,710
"Fate is not satisfied
with inflicting..."

617
00:51:15,079 --> 00:51:16,579
"one calamity."

618
00:51:17,150 --> 00:51:19,250
Publilius Syrus.

619
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:30,760
They're juggling.

620
00:51:33,530 --> 00:51:36,360
Dad, I want to buy that.

621
00:51:37,769 --> 00:51:40,239
Do you want that cotton candy?

622
00:51:40,269 --> 00:51:43,909
Yes, Yu Na wants cotton candy.
Cotton candy!

623
00:51:44,170 --> 00:51:46,309
Wait here with Mom.

624
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:47,639
All right.

625
00:51:47,909 --> 00:51:49,849
Dad, be right back.

626
00:51:50,579 --> 00:51:52,210
Yu Na, do you want to watch that?

627
00:51:52,210 --> 00:51:53,679
- Yes!
- Let's go.

628
00:51:58,590 --> 00:51:59,920
Hello.

629
00:52:10,030 --> 00:52:11,400
Ah Reum!

630
00:52:12,599 --> 00:52:14,199
Ah Reum!

631
00:52:15,199 --> 00:52:19,840
Ah Reum! Ah Reum! Ah Reum!

632
00:52:24,110 --> 00:52:25,409
Oh, my.

633
00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:27,820
Yu Na, you should always...

634
00:52:29,179 --> 00:52:30,389
Where has she gone?

635
00:52:31,550 --> 00:52:32,550
Yu Na.

636
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:36,460
Yu Na? Excuse me.

637
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:37,960
Yu Na.

638
00:52:39,429 --> 00:52:40,429
Sorry.

639
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:42,460
Yu Na.

640
00:52:43,570 --> 00:52:44,570
Yu Na?

641
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:50,440
Yu Na?

642
00:52:51,909 --> 00:52:53,170
Where is she?

643
00:52:54,010 --> 00:52:55,079
Yu Na!

644
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:00,920
Yu...

645
00:53:14,599 --> 00:53:16,329
Honey, what's wrong?

646
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,570
Yu Na has disappeared.

647
00:53:18,730 --> 00:53:20,300
I thought she went to see you.

648
00:53:20,369 --> 00:53:22,099
What are you saying?

649
00:53:22,369 --> 00:53:24,809
She was holding my hand
next to me...

650
00:53:25,139 --> 00:53:26,269
when she disappeared.

651
00:53:26,269 --> 00:53:28,110
We should report to the center
for lost children.

652
00:53:28,179 --> 00:53:31,349
Yu Na! Hwang Yu Na!

653
00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:33,980
Yu Na! Hwang Yu Na!

654
00:53:34,019 --> 00:53:37,449
If you are looking after a child
called Hwang Yu Na,

655
00:53:37,449 --> 00:53:40,360
a girl wearing a pink shirt
and short jeans,

656
00:53:40,489 --> 00:53:44,059
please call the center
for lost children.

657
00:53:44,059 --> 00:53:45,630
We're looking for a child.

658
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:49,130
Do we have to wait like this?

659
00:53:49,429 --> 00:53:52,230
We're searching the area.
Please wait a little longer.

660
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:53,739
Ma'am,

661
00:53:54,539 --> 00:53:57,469
you said she disappeared
when you weren't looking, right?

662
00:53:58,139 --> 00:54:00,639
Did you see any strange people
nearby?

663
00:54:00,710 --> 00:54:02,380
Anyone acting strangely?

664
00:54:02,409 --> 00:54:05,449
Yes, something strange had happened.

665
00:54:05,579 --> 00:54:09,280
Ah Reum! Ah Reum! Ah Reum!

666
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:11,719
Someone must have lost her child...

667
00:54:11,719 --> 00:54:13,989
because she was screaming out
her child's name and looking around.

668
00:54:13,989 --> 00:54:16,019
I was looking at her for a moment.

669
00:54:16,519 --> 00:54:18,630
I saw her too.

670
00:54:19,190 --> 00:54:21,460
It's the same. It's the same method.

671
00:54:22,230 --> 00:54:23,469
I...

672
00:54:24,030 --> 00:54:27,869
lost my Jin Woo like that here.

673
00:54:27,869 --> 00:54:30,309
Ma'am! She's doing this again.

674
00:54:30,309 --> 00:54:31,739
- Let's go. Let's go.
- And then...

675
00:54:31,739 --> 00:54:34,440
she disappeared completely, right?

676
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:36,610
Detective, listen to me.

677
00:54:36,610 --> 00:54:38,980
- I...
- You reek of alcohol.

678
00:54:38,980 --> 00:54:41,579
Why do you cause problems every
time? This isn't about your child.

679
00:54:41,579 --> 00:54:44,690
- You should get out now.
- How can I give up on my child?

680
00:54:45,519 --> 00:54:48,719
Detective, please listen to me.

681
00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:51,090
Detective, please listen to me.

682
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:52,860
Eight years ago,

683
00:54:53,559 --> 00:54:57,329
I lost my Jin Woo here
the same way...

684
00:54:57,329 --> 00:54:59,400
she lost Yu Na here.

685
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,539
Please help me find Jin Woo.
Please.

686
00:55:03,539 --> 00:55:04,840
- Get out.
- Please, I beg you.

687
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:06,539
- Get out.
- Please.

688
00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:09,039
Gosh, do you think that's true?

689
00:55:09,039 --> 00:55:11,710
I'm so scared. My goodness.

690
00:55:34,369 --> 00:55:35,369
Yes.

691
00:55:36,099 --> 00:55:37,269
I know.

692
00:55:40,210 --> 00:55:41,610
I will.

693
00:55:54,059 --> 00:55:57,030
Why did you want to see me here?

694
00:56:02,230 --> 00:56:05,070
This is the result of
the examination of Jang Gi Tae.

695
00:56:06,329 --> 00:56:09,300
The BCL index is over 90.

696
00:56:09,940 --> 00:56:14,210
He wasn't able to make
sane decisions.

697
00:56:17,349 --> 00:56:18,650
As you know well enough,

698
00:56:19,679 --> 00:56:21,780
he has done such horrible things.

699
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:44,639
Quickly. Ji Young!

700
00:56:44,809 --> 00:56:45,969
Ji Young!

701
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:51,610
Ji Young! Ji Young!

702
00:56:55,619 --> 00:56:59,090
Why are you showing this to me?

703
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:05,090
The problem is that your results...

704
00:57:05,730 --> 00:57:07,400
aren't much different.

705
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:11,730
I knew...

706
00:57:12,599 --> 00:57:16,000
that you were taking medications
for PTSD.

707
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:19,369
(Examination Results)

708
00:57:20,409 --> 00:57:21,440
Why did you...

709
00:57:22,179 --> 00:57:26,010
ignore the team member's suggestion
to run a public investigation?

710
00:57:28,349 --> 00:57:29,550
The superiors...

711
00:57:30,820 --> 00:57:33,489
are worried about
your ability to make judgement.

712
00:57:36,489 --> 00:57:37,960
When we're in a dilemma,

713
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:41,599
it's our job to take
responsibility for it.

714
00:57:47,699 --> 00:57:50,000
You should leave the team.

715
00:57:58,710 --> 00:58:01,650
I think you should take a rest.

716
00:58:01,650 --> 00:58:03,219
That'd be better for the team.

717
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:05,590
I'm fine.

718
00:58:06,190 --> 00:58:08,219
Why did you visit Yoon Hee Chul?

719
00:58:11,829 --> 00:58:14,429
Do you think you'd be able to
think rationally...

720
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:17,530
when the Reaper comes back?

721
00:58:19,070 --> 00:58:21,639
Why are you ignoring
the possibility...

722
00:58:21,639 --> 00:58:25,309
that your personal feelings might
put your team members in danger?

723
00:58:30,579 --> 00:58:34,179
Think what's best for the team.

724
00:58:36,719 --> 00:58:40,090
I'm sure you'll make
a wise decision.

725
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:06,750
She's arguing
her child got kidnapped...

726
00:59:06,750 --> 00:59:08,949
just like how Yu Na disappeared.

727
00:59:08,949 --> 00:59:11,650
Excuse me. I'm looking for a child.
Please take a look.

728
00:59:11,889 --> 00:59:13,489
There's a high chance...

729
00:59:13,489 --> 00:59:15,090
that the missing children are alive.

730
00:59:15,090 --> 00:59:17,429
Kidnapping cases aren't
within our authority.

731
00:59:17,829 --> 00:59:19,590
I don't think you should
take this lightly.

732
00:59:20,329 --> 00:59:22,530
According to the profile,
there are at least three criminals.

733
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:24,469
Does that mean
there are accomplices?

734
00:59:24,469 --> 00:59:25,969
I think we're on the right track.

735
00:59:31,239 --> 00:59:34,039
For kidnap, unless you find
them within 24 hours,

736
00:59:34,039 --> 00:59:36,380
the children are likely
to be found dead.

737
00:59:36,710 --> 00:59:38,510
We need to find a group...

738
00:59:38,510 --> 00:59:40,150
including the missing children.

739
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:44,050
Something worse than we expected
is happening.
