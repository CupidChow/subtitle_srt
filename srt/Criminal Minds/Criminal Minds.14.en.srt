(Episode 14)

15
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,920
I know what happened...

16
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,560
at the training institute.

17
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:17,939
You were in charge of
the training institute...

18
00:02:18,139 --> 00:02:19,939
managed by the center, right?

19
00:02:21,449 --> 00:02:23,680
Was it this man?

20
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:30,759
There must be more victims...

21
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:32,919
like you.

22
00:02:34,129 --> 00:02:35,659
I know it has been hard for you...

23
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,960
and that your life has stopped...

24
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,500
that day.

25
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:42,270
Do you remember...

26
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:46,469
the Pollack Festival in your village
that was held in August, 2013?

27
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:52,009
It would have been your turn
to clean the institute that day.

28
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:57,719
Were you the person who went to
the institute that day?

29
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:01,520
His first target was...

30
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:03,960
Kang Ho Young,

31
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:08,030
and then it was me.

32
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,560
I didn't go to...

33
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,129
the institute that day.

34
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:22,169
I was relieved then...

35
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:27,650
that the brutal man had
someone else in his mind.

36
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:29,949
Who was it?

37
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:32,650
Was it...

38
00:03:35,389 --> 00:03:36,789
this student here?

39
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:46,229
He is Kim Jung Soo, 41 years old.

40
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,569
He worked as the chief of
administration at the center...

41
00:03:48,569 --> 00:03:51,300
for a few years before
the Nadeul River murder happened.

42
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,300
But he was not included in
the retiree list.

43
00:03:54,169 --> 00:03:57,610
That's why I thought it was strange
and investigated him.

44
00:03:57,879 --> 00:04:01,750
I found out that his car and house
were registered under Kim Hyun Jun.

45
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:05,550
But seeing as he wasn't on
the family register,

46
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,620
he must be an illegitimate child.

47
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:12,319
I couldn't find his current address
yet, so I am still trying.

48
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:15,129
How about Kim Hyun Jun?

49
00:04:17,129 --> 00:04:18,660
He had been...

50
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:21,100
interrogated by the police
a few times in the past.

51
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:24,639
He must have had a rough time
after his father died.

52
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,040
But after that, he entered
the Police Academy...

53
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,740
after receiving scholarship
from the center.

54
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:32,279
And we know what happened next.

55
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:36,250
His family members consist of
his mother and his brother.

56
00:04:37,949 --> 00:04:39,879
After his brother was involved
in a hit-and-run accident,

57
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,550
it seems
like he's still at the hospital.

58
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:44,420
Maybe that's why...

59
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:47,629
we never heard about his family
from him.

60
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:50,459
All right.

61
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:54,069
Team Manager Kang, Kim Jung Soo
does not have any credit card...

62
00:04:54,069 --> 00:04:55,529
or cellphone records.

63
00:04:55,899 --> 00:04:58,339
Wouldn't it be better
to ask the police for help?

64
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:03,879
Maybe the suspect already knew
that Detective Tae...

65
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,680
was already suspicious of Hyun Jun.

66
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:08,709
But why did Kang Ho Young choose
Hyun Jun...

67
00:05:09,149 --> 00:05:10,649
over all the police officers nearby?

68
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,819
Not yet.

69
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,850
We need to be sure.

70
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:18,819
Kim Jung Soo could have killed
Mo Ji Eun to keep her quiet.

71
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,459
The records say that he went
to the center for a business trip...

72
00:05:22,459 --> 00:05:24,430
the day Mo Ji Eun was murdered.

73
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,560
Then what...

74
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,670
He needed a perfect alibi...

75
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,269
to prove his innocence.

76
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:36,670
Team Manager Kang,
take a look at this.

77
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:40,180
This is Hyun Jun's statement.

78
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,250
He first said that he saw the person
who took the victim,

79
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,550
but he changed it later.

80
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,399
You've been investigating
this case by yourself...

81
00:06:01,769 --> 00:06:03,740
for the last 14 years.

82
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,839
Even when you were considered
a suspect,

83
00:06:08,069 --> 00:06:12,310
you didn't state the facts
you know about the case.

84
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:14,550
What are you trying to say?

85
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:17,550
You want to find out the truth,

86
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:20,689
but on the other hand,
you want to avoid it.

87
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,920
You were investigating this case...

88
00:06:23,089 --> 00:06:24,959
with ambivalent feelings...

89
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:28,089
because you're hiding something
that you can't tell anyone about.

90
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,490
Team Manager Kang.

91
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,730
Isn't that because...

92
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:34,430
the case has something to do with
a person who is important to you?

93
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:39,600
I heard you have a brother who stays
at the hospital after an accident.

94
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:42,839
What does that have to do with this?

95
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,480
Did you...

96
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:49,209
do a background check on me?

97
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:50,750
You...

98
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,480
probably saw your brother...

99
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:56,019
on the day Mo Ji Eun was murdered.

100
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:10,300
In your statement, you talk about
a man that met Ji Eun...

101
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,600
who was tall and had a cap on.

102
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:15,009
At first, you thought it
was your brother.

103
00:07:15,009 --> 00:07:17,009
But afterwards,
you said that it wasn't.

104
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,410
Why did you do that?

105
00:07:20,209 --> 00:07:22,949
At first, you were suspecting...

106
00:07:22,949 --> 00:07:25,149
your brother of being the culprit.

107
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,490
You'd have been afraid
that it could be the truth.

108
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,689
At that time,

109
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:39,759
you thought it was the best way
for you to protect your brother.

110
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:44,139
The fear that your brother could be
the real culprit...

111
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:46,870
would have tormented you.

112
00:07:47,939 --> 00:07:49,540
After the accident,

113
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,709
there was no way for you
to find out the truth.

114
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:54,810
Stop it.

115
00:07:55,379 --> 00:07:56,980
You would have also...

116
00:07:58,319 --> 00:07:59,550
thought about...

117
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,689
the reason why he had to kill
Mo Ji Eun...

118
00:08:02,889 --> 00:08:05,620
if he was the real culprit
of the Nadeul River incident.

119
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:07,529
I told you to stop.

120
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:09,660
In the center 14 years ago,

121
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:12,959
some people were sexually harassed.

122
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,170
What are you talking about?

123
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:19,199
Did you not know about this?

124
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:23,610
The chief of administration,
Kim Jung Soo,

125
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:28,250
had consistently harassed boys
in the center.

126
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:32,950
The people who had been
harassed by him was...

127
00:08:34,649 --> 00:08:37,559
Kang Ho Young, Choi Sang Ho,

128
00:08:40,929 --> 00:08:43,960
and another victim whose harassment
was witnessed by Mo Ji Eun.

129
00:08:51,539 --> 00:08:52,840
Kim Tae Jun,

130
00:08:54,139 --> 00:08:55,240
your brother.

131
00:09:03,049 --> 00:09:05,220
Unfortunately, your brother...

132
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,350
was one of the victims.

133
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,690
And Mo Ji Eun witnessed it.

134
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,720
He would have felt humiliated.

135
00:09:13,889 --> 00:09:15,259
He would not have wanted...

136
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:19,100
his only brother to know
what had happened...

137
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,470
because to you, your brother...

138
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,429
was like your father.

139
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:30,740
That's why your brother
met Mo Ji Eun first.

140
00:09:31,909 --> 00:09:34,679
At first, he would have wanted
to simply check if she really knew.

141
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:36,950
But he must have found out
that she did.

142
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,919
He would have thought
that she couldn't know about this.

143
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:43,090
He would have felt that he needed
to stop her from talking.

144
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:48,360
What do you think?

145
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:51,529
Tell me if I made a mistake
during my profiling.

146
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:54,100
You're talking nonsense.

147
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,070
Kim Hyun Jun.

148
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:59,370
Were you really trying to find out
the truth,

149
00:09:59,539 --> 00:10:01,570
or were you trying to hide things
out of fear...

150
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:03,210
that your brother
could be the culprit?

151
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:04,480
Shut your mouth.

152
00:10:05,179 --> 00:10:06,610
Shut your mouth!

153
00:10:09,049 --> 00:10:10,179
Let's talk about...

154
00:10:10,779 --> 00:10:12,480
the current incident.

155
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:15,690
Did you really fail to meet
Kang Ho Young that day?

156
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:17,019
What?

157
00:10:17,019 --> 00:10:19,019
Did you murder Kang Ho Young...

158
00:10:19,259 --> 00:10:22,360
so that you could hide the truth
about this case completely?

159
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,899
What do you know?

160
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:27,830
You don't know anything.

161
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:30,870
Tell me. Did you kill him?

162
00:10:31,539 --> 00:10:33,669
I told you to shut it!

163
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:48,590
Sun Woo.

164
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:50,350
Shouldn't we go in and stop them?

165
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:51,860
Stay still.

166
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,529
Team Manager Kang has a plan.

167
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:57,429
We should wait.

168
00:10:57,629 --> 00:10:59,799
Let me go. Let me go.

169
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:02,000
Let me go!

170
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:05,039
Listen to me, Kim Hyun Jun.

171
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:09,840
They won't be able to hear us
from the outside.

172
00:11:10,009 --> 00:11:11,279
Do you understand me?

173
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,090
What are you looking at?

174
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:25,919
Go back to work.

175
00:11:29,659 --> 00:11:31,059
Act naturally.

176
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,960
They might still be watching us.

177
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,539
Yes, it's me.

178
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,710
I found Kim Jung Soo's location.

179
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:47,710
I looked up to see if he's driving
the car in his father's name.

180
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:49,710
It's a luxury sedan.

181
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,919
He has a record of
speeding and parking violation...

182
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:54,649
from a location far from the center.

183
00:11:57,419 --> 00:11:58,659
Kim Jung Soo.

184
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,830
He manipulated his alibi on the day
of the Nadeul river incident.

185
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,360
He ordered Kang Ho Young
or your brother...

186
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,129
to bring Mo Ji Eun,

187
00:12:08,129 --> 00:12:10,429
and killed them to prevent them
from confessing.

188
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:14,370
Someone within the police
is helping him.

189
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:15,970
Are you saying...

190
00:12:16,909 --> 00:12:19,580
there's an accomplice
among the police?

191
00:12:21,909 --> 00:12:22,909
That's why...

192
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:27,820
the Nadeul River murder case remains
unsolved for 14 years.

193
00:12:29,549 --> 00:12:31,820
Kang Ho Young was scared.

194
00:12:32,259 --> 00:12:34,960
He knew he will be the target
one day.

195
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:38,460
Why do you think he couldn't
tell the police?

196
00:12:39,629 --> 00:12:42,600
I believe the case of your brother
is also manipulated.

197
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,039
After Mo Ji Eun died,

198
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:49,539
your brother probably found
Kim Jung Soo suspicious.

199
00:12:49,909 --> 00:12:51,909
He had to stop him from confessing.

200
00:12:52,309 --> 00:12:54,210
Kang Ho Young left...

201
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:56,779
something hidden that could be
an evidence for survival.

202
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:02,019
He tried to show you in person.

203
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:06,259
Who do you think manipulated
the case?

204
00:13:06,259 --> 00:13:07,460
Whoever it is,

205
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:10,360
he's going to start making a move.

206
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:23,000
You pervert.

207
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:25,500
It was a boy, not a girl?

208
00:14:26,669 --> 00:14:28,039
Come here. Come here.

209
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:29,139
We can talk.

210
00:14:29,139 --> 00:14:30,710
Come here, you jerk.

211
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:36,980
You disgusting pervert.

212
00:14:38,549 --> 00:14:41,620
Hey, how many people
did you do this to?

213
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:44,190
- Say it.
- Do what?

214
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:45,360
You little...

215
00:14:46,059 --> 00:14:48,860
5... No, 6.

216
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,399
It didn't mean anything.

217
00:14:54,629 --> 00:14:56,799
I just found them cute.

218
00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:00,000
You disgusting pervert.

219
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:03,070
Why did you kill Ji Eun?

220
00:15:03,809 --> 00:15:06,480
Why did you kill her?

221
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,549
Say it. Say it now.

222
00:15:08,549 --> 00:15:11,320
You jerk.

223
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:59,000
I searched all over, but couldn't
find any traces of him.

224
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,110
That's why...

225
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:13,110
the Nadeul River murder case remains
unsolved for 14 years.

226
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:17,610
I believe the case of your brother
is also manipulated.

227
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:22,450
What's going on?

228
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,820
Please call Detective Tae.

229
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,889
- Now?
- There's something I must tell him.

230
00:16:32,429 --> 00:16:34,299
What is it that you must tell me?

231
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:39,500
Team Manager Kang. I looked up the
police officer who investigated...

232
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:42,970
Hyun Jun's brother's bike accident
on August 12, 2003.

233
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:44,580
It's Sergeant Oh Jong Taek.

234
00:16:45,809 --> 00:16:48,649
If this is going by someone's
scenario,

235
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:51,009
he's someone who knows us well,

236
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:54,179
or someone who knows Hyun Jun
well.

237
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:57,990
Someone who knows Hyun Jun
better than anyone,

238
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:01,330
and who's been watching the case
from the past,

239
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,929
and has the power of control.

240
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:20,880
What are you looking at?

241
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:22,650
Go back to work.

242
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,849
It's Sergeant Oh.

243
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:27,789
What?

244
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:29,690
Are you sure about that?

245
00:17:29,789 --> 00:17:33,759
Why do you think none of us
couldn't find anything...

246
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:35,630
even after a long time?

247
00:17:36,029 --> 00:17:38,400
Why do you think Kang Ho Young
couldn't call the police,

248
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:39,930
but called me instead?

249
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:42,670
There's someone...

250
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:45,599
in the police manipulating the case.

251
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,940
At first,

252
00:17:49,539 --> 00:17:52,279
I testified that I saw the man who
took Ji Eun.

253
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:56,480
I also said that's my brother,

254
00:18:02,019 --> 00:18:04,119
but then I changed my testimony.

255
00:18:05,259 --> 00:18:07,289
I said I must've been mistaken.

256
00:18:07,859 --> 00:18:09,990
Why do you think Sergeant Oh
told me to do that?

257
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:12,829
He told you to change your
testimony?

258
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:16,230
There's only one reason.

259
00:18:16,599 --> 00:18:20,700
No one related to Kim Jung Soo
should be involved.

260
00:18:21,539 --> 00:18:23,569
That's the only way to protect
himself.

261
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:24,940
No.

262
00:18:25,579 --> 00:18:27,710
We need evidence.

263
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:30,750
Do you know who investigated
Kim Jung Soo's alibi?

264
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:33,519
And the officer who proved
Kang Ho Young's innocence?

265
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:38,160
Sergeant Oh was the first one to
arrive at the site...

266
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,420
of my brother's accident.

267
00:18:40,859 --> 00:18:42,890
Check the work history.

268
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:44,430
I'm sure...

269
00:18:45,259 --> 00:18:47,359
Sergeant Oh took Kim Jung Soo.

270
00:18:54,269 --> 00:18:55,440
Let me go.

271
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,710
I must stop Sergeant Oh.

272
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:59,140
No. You might get hurt.

273
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:00,480
Let me go.

274
00:19:01,809 --> 00:19:03,849
I must handle this myself.

275
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:06,380
Detective Tae.

276
00:19:07,049 --> 00:19:08,049
Hey.

277
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:10,450
Are you aware of
how serious this is?

278
00:19:10,819 --> 00:19:12,319
What if something goes wrong?

279
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:15,289
Don't worry.

280
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:18,799
It's all my responsibility.

281
00:19:24,269 --> 00:19:26,839
Call me as soon as you find
Sergeant Oh's location.

282
00:19:27,269 --> 00:19:28,309
Get it?

283
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:29,839
Sure.

284
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:40,980
Punch me.

285
00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:44,589
If anything happens to you,
this will make us even.

286
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:52,859
Sergeant Oh.

287
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:02,269
Are you sure you're okay?

288
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,369
Yes. I'm fine.

289
00:20:05,509 --> 00:20:06,740
I'll stop everything.

290
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,480
Something like that
won't happen again.

291
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,019
Ho Young.

292
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:25,599
Slow down.

293
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,130
Where's Hyun Jun?

294
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:37,740
Hi.

295
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,289
I saw everything.

296
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:50,920
Don't ever bully Tae Jun again,

297
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,019
or I'll call the police.

298
00:20:53,019 --> 00:20:54,019
What?

299
00:20:54,359 --> 00:20:56,759
Did he say that I did it?

300
00:20:56,829 --> 00:20:59,329
- He's right. Tae Jun was just...
- Go away.

301
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:01,130
You're no different.

302
00:21:23,019 --> 00:21:24,690
What a prick.

303
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:29,130
Kang Ho Young, what are you
doing?

304
00:21:40,069 --> 00:21:42,210
Hey! Go after him!

305
00:21:42,309 --> 00:21:44,039
Go now! Go after Kim Hyun Jun!

306
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:46,079
Find Kim Hyun Jun now!

307
00:22:15,569 --> 00:22:16,609
Yes, Nana.

308
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:19,880
Issue a search for Oh Jong Taek's
car, and get me the coordinates.

309
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,980
We don't have time. Hurry.

310
00:22:22,009 --> 00:22:24,180
Kim Hyun Jun has escaped. Report
as soon as he's found.

311
00:22:24,549 --> 00:22:25,720
I repeat.

312
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,720
Kim Hyun Jun has escaped. Report
as soon as he's found.

313
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:30,819
Kim Hyun Jun is not a dangerous
figure.

314
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:33,119
Kim Hyun Jun is a murder suspect
who took an officer's gun...

315
00:22:33,289 --> 00:22:34,519
and escaped.

316
00:22:35,029 --> 00:22:36,029
I repeat.

317
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,230
What are you doing?

318
00:22:39,299 --> 00:22:40,900
- Team Manager Kang.
- One of our agents...

319
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,730
may fall into danger
during the pursuit.

320
00:22:43,099 --> 00:22:46,099
Team Manager Kang, this situation
is difficult to stop.

321
00:22:46,339 --> 00:22:48,539
We have to find Hyun Jun first.

322
00:23:06,819 --> 00:23:08,059
You were right.

323
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:10,329
A CCTV near Kim Jung Soo's
house caught...

324
00:23:10,329 --> 00:23:12,299
Sergeant Oh's car passing by,

325
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:14,660
but the car disappeared at
the next intersection.

326
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:16,200
His phone is off too.

327
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:18,839
Continue tracking the car, and call
me as soon as you find something.

328
00:23:18,839 --> 00:23:19,839
Yes, Team Manager Kang.

329
00:23:24,039 --> 00:23:25,539
No one knew about the
information we'd discovered...

330
00:23:25,539 --> 00:23:28,109
aside from the local detectives.

331
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:30,509
Oh Jong Taek took Kim Jung Soo.

332
00:23:30,779 --> 00:23:32,049
Then what about Hyun Jun?

333
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:34,180
Hyun Jun caught on
faster than we did.

334
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:35,950
We have to figure out fast...

335
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:37,920
what Oh Jong Taek is after,

336
00:23:38,589 --> 00:23:39,920
and why he took Kim Jung Soo.

337
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:49,470
I told you to never appear in front
of my eyes ever again,

338
00:23:50,769 --> 00:23:52,700
and live in hiding, didn't I?

339
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,099
Yes.

340
00:23:57,210 --> 00:24:00,009
But you created another mess?

341
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:03,079
Idiots like you need to die.

342
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,579
How did I ever get involved
with an idiot like you?

343
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:09,519
Jung Soo.

344
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:12,690
Let's put an end to this.

345
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:16,130
Jung Soo, let go!

346
00:24:58,869 --> 00:25:00,670
I heard everything...

347
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:03,309
that happened at the center.

348
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:07,910
I'm going to lock up
all those guys...

349
00:25:09,109 --> 00:25:10,910
who did that to you and my brother.

350
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:22,259
What was it...

351
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:24,789
that you wanted
to tell me at the center earlier?

352
00:25:25,529 --> 00:25:26,700
Hyun Jun.

353
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,200
Congratulations once again.

354
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:37,440
Don't worry.

355
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:39,579
Trust me, and tell me.

356
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:41,750
Please.

357
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,680
A couple days before he died,

358
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,519
Ho Young came to visit.

359
00:25:49,619 --> 00:25:51,289
He was completely drunk.

360
00:25:53,059 --> 00:25:55,130
He said that he won't stay
put any longer,

361
00:25:57,029 --> 00:25:58,759
and that we can't turn back time,

362
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:01,359
but we can still make
things right.

363
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:04,230
He said he had evidence.

364
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,339
He hid the evidence...

365
00:26:07,339 --> 00:26:08,470
in a place only he knows.

366
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:10,140
Kang Ho Young.

367
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:12,180
What are you doing?

368
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,420
That must be why Ho Young told me...

369
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,789
Is Sergeant Oh...

370
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:27,589
really behind all this?

371
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:35,369
Kang Ho Young said he had
something to show you?

372
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:36,930
Yes.

373
00:26:38,069 --> 00:26:40,000
Perhaps Ho Young had...

374
00:26:40,269 --> 00:26:42,910
some sort of evidence
related to the past incident.

375
00:26:52,619 --> 00:26:53,619
(NCI Kim Hyun Jun)

376
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:56,950
It's me.

377
00:26:57,619 --> 00:26:58,789
Now I know...

378
00:26:59,789 --> 00:27:01,619
what Sergeant Oh was planning.

379
00:27:02,029 --> 00:27:03,029
What?

380
00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:04,630
Sergeant Oh doesn't know...

381
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,460
that we've figured out
who he is yet.

382
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,799
He wants to find the evidence,

383
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:11,200
fabricate Kim Jung Soo's death
as suicide,

384
00:27:11,299 --> 00:27:13,299
and get out of this
completely untouched.

385
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,039
Team Manager Kang, Hyun Jun's
phone is back on.

386
00:27:17,309 --> 00:27:18,309
Where is he?

387
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:20,839
He's near the Naeyeon intersection,
close to Choi Sang Woo's shop.

388
00:27:21,009 --> 00:27:23,950
We have to go. Hyun Jun
may fall into danger.

389
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:25,650
No, wait.

390
00:27:28,849 --> 00:27:30,019
Something's off.

391
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:33,220
Hey! Stop!

392
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:35,190
Hey!

393
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,029
Kim Hyun Jun! Stop there!

394
00:27:40,259 --> 00:27:41,299
Hyun Jun!

395
00:27:43,799 --> 00:27:44,869
Stay still!

396
00:27:48,339 --> 00:27:51,039
Hyun Jun is leading
the police there.

397
00:27:54,809 --> 00:27:57,680
Look into where Choi Sang Woo's
work truck is.

398
00:28:09,829 --> 00:28:11,190
I've found it.

399
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:13,400
It's on the outer road going
towards the center.

400
00:28:14,029 --> 00:28:15,970
It's where this whole
incident began.

401
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:18,400
It's the most natural location to
kill Kim Jung Soo,

402
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,839
and set it up as suicide.

403
00:28:20,299 --> 00:28:21,440
It's the institute center.

404
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:34,720
Don't kill me!

405
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:13,460
I am confessing to all my crimes...

406
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,289
with this recording,

407
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:19,099
and I intend to end my life to
atone for what I've done.

408
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:21,359
14 years ago,

409
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:23,970
when I worked at the youth center,

410
00:29:24,569 --> 00:29:27,700
Mo Ji Eun witnessed my shame,
and I...

411
00:29:29,069 --> 00:29:32,710
I killed Mo Ji Eun after a physical
quarrel.

412
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:07,480
And when Kim Tae Jun figured out
what I'd done,

413
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:09,880
I tried to stage a car accident,

414
00:30:10,509 --> 00:30:13,549
and kill him.

415
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:19,960
After that, Kang Ho Young, who
knew all the crimes...

416
00:30:21,089 --> 00:30:22,130
I'd committed...

417
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:26,500
Sergeant Oh. Sergeant Oh!

418
00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:28,700
Sergeant Oh!

419
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:31,029
It's not me.

420
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:56,089
You think it's unfair
for you to die like this?

421
00:30:57,829 --> 00:31:00,460
I didn't kill Kang Ho Young
and Kim Tae Jun.

422
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:03,930
You did.

423
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:10,970
Throw away the knife.

424
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:13,180
Hyun Jun.

425
00:31:13,579 --> 00:31:16,309
Hyun Jun, help me.

426
00:31:17,009 --> 00:31:21,319
Killing Ji Eun was a mistake.

427
00:31:21,579 --> 00:31:24,390
I didn't kill Ji Eun.

428
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,420
It was a mistake.

429
00:31:26,859 --> 00:31:28,190
This person was the one who hurt...

430
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:30,359
your brother, Tae Jun.

431
00:31:30,359 --> 00:31:31,460
Shut your mouth!

432
00:31:32,329 --> 00:31:33,630
How did you know?

433
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:35,059
Throw your knife away.

434
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,119
What you said before...

435
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:03,059
Is that the truth?

436
00:32:03,789 --> 00:32:04,789
Yes.

437
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:07,000
Did you kill Ho Young?

438
00:32:08,029 --> 00:32:10,500
You faked your alibi
on the day of the murder,

439
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:14,740
hid the truth about the murder
of a girl for 14 years,

440
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,910
and caused an accident...

441
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:20,109
that ended someone's life
to hide your wrongdoings.

442
00:32:20,109 --> 00:32:21,539
And the children...

443
00:32:22,309 --> 00:32:24,279
you harassed...

444
00:32:26,549 --> 00:32:28,519
were only 16 or 17 years old.

445
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:32,789
They were around
your daughter's age.

446
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:36,430
Tell me.

447
00:32:38,759 --> 00:32:39,900
Why did you do that?

448
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:41,730
Why did you...

449
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,730
do that to my brother?

450
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:46,940
Tell me.

451
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:52,279
Tell me!

452
00:32:56,549 --> 00:32:57,549
What is it?

453
00:33:05,789 --> 00:33:06,819
What is this?

454
00:33:07,859 --> 00:33:10,559
I think this would be enough.

455
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:12,900
What are you doing?

456
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:14,630
Father.

457
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:21,470
Think of this as a way
of helping a young man's life out.

458
00:33:21,769 --> 00:33:24,539
Just let this one slide by.

459
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:26,509
This was a mistake.

460
00:33:27,779 --> 00:33:32,079
A mistake? Do you think what he did
to the kids was a mistake?

461
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:36,119
A dead person is a dead person.

462
00:33:36,119 --> 00:33:40,059
But people who are living
must live on.

463
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,490
Grab your money and leave...

464
00:33:42,759 --> 00:33:46,059
before I charge you of
interfering a public official...

465
00:33:46,059 --> 00:33:47,730
and bribery.

466
00:33:48,029 --> 00:33:50,269
Come here. Come here, scumbag.

467
00:33:50,269 --> 00:33:51,329
Father.

468
00:33:52,269 --> 00:33:53,500
I heard...

469
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,440
your daughter has a rare disease.

470
00:33:56,940 --> 00:34:01,680
I also heard that you are
burdened by debts because of that.

471
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,849
Shut it.

472
00:34:04,309 --> 00:34:05,819
Come here, scumbag.

473
00:34:05,819 --> 00:34:07,619
Father!

474
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:10,489
Are you saying...

475
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:13,059
this is not enough?

476
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:18,559
Then what more can I do to help?

477
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:21,300
Gosh, what are you even doing?

478
00:34:30,809 --> 00:34:32,340
Yes, this is Oh Jong Taek
of the Serious Crimes Unit.

479
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:33,780
Chief Oh.

480
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:36,110
I told you not to call me.

481
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:37,880
- I will get going.
- Okay.

482
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:40,380
Why do you keep calling me?

483
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:42,719
Tae Jun must have found out...

484
00:34:43,489 --> 00:34:45,050
that I killed Ji Eun.

485
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:46,420
What?

486
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,760
How did he find out?

487
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,860
Ho Young must have told him.

488
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
This is Oh Jong Taek.

489
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:04,739
Yes, Tae Jun?

490
00:35:04,739 --> 00:35:06,880
I have something to tell you.

491
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,449
Really? What is it about?

492
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:17,849
In that case,
I'll go to the intersection.

493
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:20,519
Don't tell anyone before I arrive,
okay?

494
00:35:52,619 --> 00:35:54,860
Help.

495
00:35:58,760 --> 00:35:59,860
Number 590.

496
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:03,630
Number 590 in standby.

497
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:07,239
I am nearby. I can go there.

498
00:36:10,909 --> 00:36:12,239
Help.

499
00:36:15,179 --> 00:36:16,449
Help.

500
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:21,250
Put your gun down.

501
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:23,920
Put it down.

502
00:36:24,289 --> 00:36:25,389
Hyun Jun.

503
00:36:26,219 --> 00:36:28,219
I was so happy...

504
00:36:28,489 --> 00:36:30,260
when you became a police officer.

505
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:33,099
But...

506
00:36:34,329 --> 00:36:35,730
I was afraid at the same time.

507
00:36:35,929 --> 00:36:37,869
What I wanted more
than to be a police officer...

508
00:36:39,969 --> 00:36:42,510
was to be a father
who could save his daughter.

509
00:36:43,469 --> 00:36:45,510
I should have finished this sooner.

510
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:47,239
But it's too late.

511
00:36:49,409 --> 00:36:50,480
No!

512
00:36:55,789 --> 00:36:58,989
I'm sorry,

513
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:01,760
Tae Jun.

514
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:22,949
(Patient Kim Tae Jun, 34 years old,
persistent vegetative state)

515
00:37:49,039 --> 00:37:50,510
You're here.

516
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:54,809
You should employ a nurse.

517
00:37:57,750 --> 00:37:59,050
You didn't even call.

518
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:01,650
How did you come here?

519
00:38:02,289 --> 00:38:05,019
I had work nearby, so I dropped by.

520
00:38:06,889 --> 00:38:08,059
You've gotten thinner.

521
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:10,429
I know, right?

522
00:38:15,329 --> 00:38:19,269
He's been through a rough time
recently.

523
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:23,340
He's lying here...

524
00:38:23,909 --> 00:38:27,380
on the hard mattress
365 days a year.

525
00:38:29,079 --> 00:38:32,820
How can I even dream of
sleeping on a warm bed?

526
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:38,889
A parent can't do that.

527
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:45,489
I'll help him.

528
00:38:46,599 --> 00:38:47,800
You should take a rest.

529
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:09,679
(Mo Ji Eun)

530
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,519
It took so long...

531
00:40:48,949 --> 00:40:50,590
to come back here.

532
00:40:51,289 --> 00:40:52,960
You couldn't forget...

533
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,789
the same person for 14 years.

534
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,199
I finally see the view here.

535
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:10,769
I didn't realize how beautiful
this place was.

536
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:17,980
(Gopchanggo)

537
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:22,349
Feel free to enjoy it.

538
00:41:22,349 --> 00:41:23,849
Is this on you?

539
00:41:23,849 --> 00:41:24,849
Sure.

540
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:33,860
Actually, many people think...

541
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:36,070
this is tripe,

542
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:37,730
but the tripe actually...

543
00:41:37,869 --> 00:41:40,369
originated from the word
for animal's fat.

544
00:41:40,469 --> 00:41:42,539
So it actually means
intestines with a lot of fat,

545
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:44,710
instead of curly intestines.

546
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:47,610
Doctor Lee, I want to make
a suggestion.

547
00:41:47,739 --> 00:41:49,210
Shall we make a team?

548
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:50,409
What team?

549
00:41:50,409 --> 00:41:52,849
A quiz team. We can go on
all the quiz shows...

550
00:41:52,849 --> 00:41:55,050
and swipe all the prizes.

551
00:41:55,219 --> 00:41:57,320
I'll be in charge of your styling,

552
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,550
so how about splitting
the prize 6 to 4?

553
00:41:58,650 --> 00:42:00,059
Who's six?

554
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:01,289
Me obviously.

555
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:03,429
No way.

556
00:42:04,289 --> 00:42:06,400
Anyway, good job, everyone.

557
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:09,769
Good job, Team Manager Kang.

558
00:42:12,429 --> 00:42:13,639
So did everyone else.

559
00:42:15,369 --> 00:42:16,639
Good job.

560
00:42:16,969 --> 00:42:19,139
The most difficult thing for
a profiler...

561
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:21,579
is profiling his colleague.

562
00:42:22,809 --> 00:42:24,650
It means I doubt my colleague.

563
00:42:25,179 --> 00:42:28,619
I never doubted you,
not even for a moment.

564
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:33,460
Congratulations on returning,
Hyun Jun.

565
00:42:34,289 --> 00:42:36,059
I missed you, Hyun Jun.

566
00:42:36,429 --> 00:42:37,489
We can work as a team again.

567
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:39,190
Thank you.

568
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:41,760
Since the complete NCI is here,

569
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:43,699
shall we make a toast?

570
00:42:43,699 --> 00:42:44,699
Sure.

571
00:42:44,699 --> 00:42:46,400
For NCI.

572
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,539
- For NCI.
- For NCI.

573
00:42:52,039 --> 00:42:54,739
I'm glad it worked out.

574
00:42:55,809 --> 00:42:57,079
You did a great job.

575
00:42:57,079 --> 00:42:58,110
Thank you.

576
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:04,119
Do you want to say something?

577
00:43:04,389 --> 00:43:07,260
Can you give me some more time?

578
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:09,190
I thought we've already talked about
it.

579
00:43:09,429 --> 00:43:11,460
I still have things left to work on.

580
00:43:11,730 --> 00:43:13,030
Is it the Reaper?

581
00:43:18,869 --> 00:43:20,699
This is the black box video...

582
00:43:20,699 --> 00:43:22,239
that proved Hyun Jun's alibi.

583
00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:25,210
What about it?

584
00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:27,940
This is the part I recovered.

585
00:43:36,190 --> 00:43:37,190
What's wrong?

586
00:43:37,219 --> 00:43:39,460
Send this to the meeting room now.

587
00:43:44,889 --> 00:43:46,300
The man who killed Kang Ho Young...

588
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:49,000
wasn't Kim Jung Soo nor
Sergeant Oh.

589
00:43:51,929 --> 00:43:53,869
He's after the whole team.

590
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:57,369
He's trying to make the team
give in.

591
00:44:02,809 --> 00:44:06,019
(Kim Hyun Jun)

592
00:44:10,949 --> 00:44:14,820
(Kim Hyun Jun)

593
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,670
Right. What the Reaper wants is...

594
00:44:23,869 --> 00:44:25,969
bringing the whole team down.

595
00:44:26,670 --> 00:44:28,340
He wanted to see us...

596
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:31,909
doubting each other, and eventually
turning our back on each other.

597
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:39,619
Even if I give up,

598
00:44:40,519 --> 00:44:42,349
he won't stop.

599
00:44:42,849 --> 00:44:45,289
It'll only make him go after
my team members...

600
00:44:46,289 --> 00:44:48,159
to irritate me.

601
00:44:49,789 --> 00:44:50,829
Chief Director Baek.

602
00:44:51,590 --> 00:44:53,360
Please give me time until...

603
00:44:54,199 --> 00:44:55,530
I finish dealing with the case.

604
00:44:56,170 --> 00:44:58,030
He'll eventually realize...

605
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:00,469
that we will never give in.

606
00:45:02,699 --> 00:45:03,739
We will...

607
00:45:04,309 --> 00:45:06,480
be the one to catch him.

608
00:45:14,679 --> 00:45:18,019
Don't forget that I'm watching you.

609
00:45:23,090 --> 00:45:24,329
"I'm sure..."

610
00:45:24,789 --> 00:45:28,960
"no god, no evil,
or no hell exists,"

611
00:45:29,929 --> 00:45:31,500
"so don't be afraid."

612
00:45:32,599 --> 00:45:33,670
Nietzsche.

613
00:45:34,469 --> 00:45:35,500
Great.

614
00:45:36,610 --> 00:45:37,739
Deeper.

615
00:45:53,389 --> 00:45:55,019
Hey, Yoo Jin,

616
00:45:55,090 --> 00:45:57,559
what are you doing?

617
00:45:57,559 --> 00:45:59,090
Hurry up.

618
00:46:00,829 --> 00:46:01,900
Touch.

619
00:46:02,429 --> 00:46:03,469
Touch.

620
00:46:04,199 --> 00:46:05,230
Touch.

621
00:46:07,239 --> 00:46:08,340
Let me see.

622
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:14,010
The competition is near.

623
00:46:14,010 --> 00:46:16,250
Keep yourselves in the best
condition.

624
00:46:17,449 --> 00:46:19,679
I'm sure you're all aware
how important this is.

625
00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:21,849
Your life relies on...

626
00:46:21,849 --> 00:46:24,889
winning the competition medal.

627
00:46:25,150 --> 00:46:26,219
- Yes.
- Yes.

628
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:29,630
Constantly relax your muscles
at home,

629
00:46:29,630 --> 00:46:32,429
and manage your condition.
Dismissed.

630
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:34,530
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

631
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:41,469
Don't do anything stupid at night,
and go to sleep early.

632
00:46:42,469 --> 00:46:45,869
He acts like he cares about us.

633
00:46:46,809 --> 00:46:48,239
He must be very tired.

634
00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:51,949
Do you think he noticed
we're going clubbing?

635
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:54,949
If he did, he wouldn't be here.

636
00:46:55,449 --> 00:46:57,449
He looks so dumb.

637
00:46:59,619 --> 00:47:01,219
How do I look?
Do I look like an idol?

638
00:47:01,719 --> 00:47:03,690
- No.
- No.

639
00:47:05,059 --> 00:47:07,559
Fine, whatever.
Let's burn it up tonight.

640
00:47:07,630 --> 00:47:08,900
Let's go vent our stress.

641
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:10,599
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

642
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:14,239
Oh, your house is empty, right?

643
00:47:14,239 --> 00:47:16,570
Not just for tonight.
You can live at my house.

644
00:47:16,570 --> 00:47:17,710
Just come whenever.

645
00:47:19,639 --> 00:47:20,639
Are you sick?

646
00:47:21,079 --> 00:47:22,409
It's just a cold.

647
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:23,909
Don't worry about it.

648
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:27,250
This is nothing for a night out
after a while.

649
00:47:27,449 --> 00:47:28,679
What about your mom?

650
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:31,289
Turn off your location on your cell
phone.

651
00:47:31,289 --> 00:47:33,489
What if your mom comes to get you
again like last time?

652
00:47:33,719 --> 00:47:35,920
Hey, my mom's not that bad.

653
00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:37,559
- She is.
- She is.

654
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:40,030
I turned it off.

655
00:47:40,829 --> 00:47:44,300
Don't worry. I told her I'm going to
your birthday party.

656
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,170
Good job. I'm ready.

657
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:49,639
Hey, we're late.

658
00:47:49,809 --> 00:47:52,010
- Really?
- Let's go. Hurry up.

659
00:47:53,409 --> 00:47:54,940
I forgot something in the shower.

660
00:47:55,179 --> 00:47:56,780
Go get it,
and I'll meet you downstairs.

661
00:47:56,780 --> 00:47:57,809
Okay.

662
00:48:24,769 --> 00:48:25,909
Park Song Yi.

663
00:48:26,579 --> 00:48:28,679
Is it you?

664
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:31,550
No, it's not.

665
00:48:40,519 --> 00:48:41,590
Yoo Jin.

666
00:48:42,719 --> 00:48:45,889
If you don't do as I say,
she'll die.

667
00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:50,699
Oh, my gosh.

668
00:48:57,039 --> 00:48:58,110
Gosh.

669
00:49:00,909 --> 00:49:02,639
Where are we?

670
00:49:03,150 --> 00:49:04,380
Why is it so cold?

671
00:49:04,610 --> 00:49:06,150
We must be in the mountains.

672
00:49:08,050 --> 00:49:09,179
Are you okay, Yoo Jin?

673
00:49:11,989 --> 00:49:13,719
Why did he lock us up?

674
00:49:14,690 --> 00:49:16,059
What is he trying to do?

675
00:49:17,159 --> 00:49:19,760
He knew our names.

676
00:49:20,659 --> 00:49:21,829
Did you tell him?

677
00:49:22,059 --> 00:49:24,199
No, why would I?

678
00:49:24,869 --> 00:49:26,599
He knew my name too.

679
00:49:27,469 --> 00:49:28,469
So?

680
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:31,110
I didn't tell him anything.

681
00:49:31,469 --> 00:49:32,710
I was only asking.

682
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:38,349
That means he knew us all along.

683
00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:40,380
Is he someone we know?

684
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:43,590
I wonder if he does.

685
00:49:44,550 --> 00:49:45,889
He knows us?

686
00:49:49,929 --> 00:49:51,730
Then he could just...

687
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:54,730
tell us what he wants.

688
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:57,599
A normal person would
never do this.

689
00:49:57,730 --> 00:50:00,539
He must be crazy.
He can't be in his right mind.

690
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:02,139
Do you think he wants to kill us?

691
00:50:02,170 --> 00:50:03,909
Don't say that!

692
00:50:06,679 --> 00:50:08,380
We all have to stay alert.

693
00:50:08,409 --> 00:50:09,849
We can get out of here.

694
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:11,780
This is nothing.

695
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:14,420
We've survived worse training.

696
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:17,449
Yes. The three of us are together.

697
00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:19,119
He won't be able to do anything
with us.

698
00:50:19,289 --> 00:50:20,619
Okay.

699
00:50:22,489 --> 00:50:23,860
Are you really okay?

700
00:50:26,730 --> 00:50:27,860
Who are you?

701
00:50:29,329 --> 00:50:31,900
What do you want from us?

702
00:50:32,130 --> 00:50:35,369
All you have to do is make a choice.

703
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:36,840
A choice?

704
00:50:39,739 --> 00:50:41,510
What choice are you talking about?

705
00:50:41,539 --> 00:50:42,739
Listen carefully.

706
00:50:44,110 --> 00:50:45,809
2 out of you 3...

707
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:49,519
will leave this place alive. But...

708
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:54,019
the other one person will die here.

709
00:50:55,590 --> 00:50:56,760
It is up to you to decide...

710
00:50:57,289 --> 00:50:58,760
who dies.

711
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:03,869
That's the only way...

712
00:51:05,070 --> 00:51:07,239
you can get out of here.

713
00:51:18,250 --> 00:51:19,849
- Ready to order?
- Yes.

714
00:51:20,119 --> 00:51:22,150
I'll have six iced americanos.

715
00:51:22,150 --> 00:51:23,150
Okay.

716
00:51:23,949 --> 00:51:25,050
Here is your coffee.

717
00:51:25,050 --> 00:51:26,889
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

718
00:51:31,030 --> 00:51:32,030
Just a moment.

719
00:51:34,059 --> 00:51:35,059
Yes, auntie.

720
00:51:39,530 --> 00:51:41,139
Okay, put her on the phone.

721
00:51:41,969 --> 00:51:42,969
Here you go.

722
00:51:44,639 --> 00:51:46,139
Are you the detective?

723
00:51:48,210 --> 00:51:50,610
No one is believing me.

724
00:51:52,210 --> 00:51:55,519
Please find Song Yi, my daughter.

725
00:51:57,820 --> 00:51:59,789
Of course I reported her missing.

726
00:52:00,119 --> 00:52:03,289
But they're just telling me that
she ran away from home,

727
00:52:03,730 --> 00:52:05,989
and that I should wait for
her to come back.

728
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:10,300
I mean,

729
00:52:10,670 --> 00:52:12,599
how can I just stay home and wait...

730
00:52:12,599 --> 00:52:15,769
when my daughter is missing?

731
00:52:22,579 --> 00:52:25,780
I'm sure that something happened
to her.

732
00:52:26,519 --> 00:52:29,219
Something's stopping her from
coming back home to me.

733
00:52:29,949 --> 00:52:32,989
If you look here, the three girls
all left the same text message.

734
00:52:32,989 --> 00:52:35,719
After that, there are no traces of
them using their phones or cards,

735
00:52:35,789 --> 00:52:38,260
and not even logging into their
online accounts.

736
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:43,130
(I'm going on a trip with Song Yi
and Hye In. I'll be back by Friday.)

737
00:52:43,699 --> 00:52:45,300
The messages are exactly the same,

738
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:48,000
from every word to
every punctuation mark.

739
00:52:48,039 --> 00:52:50,010
Maybe they really did go on a trip?

740
00:52:50,739 --> 00:52:53,039
I was a varsity runner, so I know.

741
00:52:53,070 --> 00:52:54,079
They probably couldn't have.

742
00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:56,880
Yoo Jin, how does it feel
to win first place?

743
00:52:57,150 --> 00:53:01,079
Yes, I did win first place.

744
00:53:01,079 --> 00:53:02,519
I actually placed first.

745
00:53:02,519 --> 00:53:03,989
- It's me.
- Wait.

746
00:53:03,989 --> 00:53:06,150
Everyone, I actually placed first.
I'm the real winner.

747
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:07,659
- I was first.
- It was me.

748
00:53:07,659 --> 00:53:10,360
They had an important match
coming up.

749
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:12,889
They must have spent years
practicing for it.

750
00:53:12,989 --> 00:53:15,329
I'm sure they wouldn't have been
that irresponsible.

751
00:53:15,329 --> 00:53:17,699
It seems likely that something
happened.

752
00:53:17,730 --> 00:53:20,340
First, let's look into it.

753
00:53:21,969 --> 00:53:22,969
Yes, let's.

754
00:53:24,170 --> 00:53:27,739
When we know for sure, you can
report it to Team Manager Kang.

755
00:53:27,909 --> 00:53:30,150
Sure. Thank you, everyone.

756
00:53:32,150 --> 00:53:33,780
- We're first.
- All of us.

757
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:35,219
- Bye.
- Bye.

758
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:36,480
Good luck!

759
00:53:50,170 --> 00:53:56,340
(We hope the students succeed
in the upcoming match.)

760
00:53:58,269 --> 00:54:00,710
That CCTV isn't even working.

761
00:54:12,590 --> 00:54:15,920
This is where the girls
were last seen.

762
00:54:19,929 --> 00:54:21,300
If you look at the schedule here,

763
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:23,230
they finish training at 8pm on
weekdays,

764
00:54:23,230 --> 00:54:25,030
and they spend 30 minutes
showering and cleaning up.

765
00:54:25,030 --> 00:54:26,639
Then they go home.

766
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:30,840
They had a set routine.

767
00:54:31,239 --> 00:54:32,469
Students in the sports team said...

768
00:54:32,469 --> 00:54:35,380
that after their training, the girls
changed and put on makeup.

769
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:38,179
If someone abducted them,

770
00:54:39,349 --> 00:54:41,820
it means the person knew
the girls' schedule beforehand.

771
00:54:43,719 --> 00:54:46,090
(Police)

772
00:54:54,099 --> 00:54:55,900
Hello, Chief Jeon.

773
00:54:56,199 --> 00:54:58,199
I'm Yoo Min Young. We spoke
on the phone earlier.

774
00:54:59,670 --> 00:55:02,099
I saw you on TV often.

775
00:55:02,769 --> 00:55:05,110
Well, you brought it up,

776
00:55:05,110 --> 00:55:07,679
so I did tell the parents
to come in.

777
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:10,949
Buy why is the NCI getting
involved in a case like this?

778
00:55:12,210 --> 00:55:13,309
Detective Lee.

779
00:55:14,679 --> 00:55:16,920
I still can't reach Hye In's father.

780
00:55:18,050 --> 00:55:20,559
That girl lives alone
with her father.

781
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:22,960
But apparently, he went out
to fish for a couple of days.

782
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:25,059
We did leave a message.

783
00:55:25,329 --> 00:55:26,659
Okay, thank you.

784
00:55:26,699 --> 00:55:29,400
Are you sure they've been
abducted?

785
00:55:30,070 --> 00:55:31,929
Then why haven't we heard
anything?

786
00:55:31,929 --> 00:55:34,170
It hasn't been confirmed yet.

787
00:55:34,170 --> 00:55:35,400
Even if they were,

788
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:37,039
shouldn't we be asked for money?

789
00:55:37,039 --> 00:55:39,309
Or some sort of demand like that?

790
00:55:39,309 --> 00:55:42,280
We're investigating with several
possibilities in mind.

791
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:43,409
Detective,

792
00:55:43,510 --> 00:55:46,610
maybe they did go on a trip
like what they said.

793
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:49,280
My daughter's been very stressed
because of the match.

794
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:53,289
Does anything come to mind
in regards to this?

795
00:55:54,059 --> 00:55:56,289
Did anything strange
happen recently?

796
00:55:56,289 --> 00:55:59,090
Or did you see anyone
suspicious around?

797
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:03,130
Chief, they found traces
of the girls.

798
00:56:05,530 --> 00:56:06,739
I told you.

799
00:56:16,139 --> 00:56:18,050
If they were abducted here,

800
00:56:18,179 --> 00:56:21,250
how were three fully grown girls
taken all at once?

801
00:56:21,550 --> 00:56:22,980
The abductor had an accomplice,

802
00:56:23,349 --> 00:56:27,659
or if not, he could have waited
until they were separated.

803
00:56:29,690 --> 00:56:31,289
If he acted alone,

804
00:56:31,929 --> 00:56:34,400
he could have waited until he
put one girl down,

805
00:56:34,730 --> 00:56:37,530
and controlled the other two girls
with her as hostage.

806
00:56:46,010 --> 00:56:47,010
Yes, Min Young.

807
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:50,880
What?

808
00:56:52,210 --> 00:56:53,309
Okay, we'll head there now.

809
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:17,909
They were found 30 minutes ago.

810
00:57:28,250 --> 00:57:30,349
Someone damaged them on purpose.

811
00:57:30,989 --> 00:57:33,289
And they were left in a completely
open space for people to see.

812
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:36,519
It looks like an abduction
case motivated by vengeance.

813
00:57:59,150 --> 00:58:01,380
We didn't find any
traces of resistance.

814
00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:03,179
It had to be meticulously planned.

815
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:04,690
Let us out!

816
00:58:04,690 --> 00:58:07,519
We might really end up dying here!

817
00:58:08,219 --> 00:58:10,260
The abductor mentioned
a specific date.

818
00:58:10,260 --> 00:58:12,329
He set it as his D-day.

819
00:58:12,329 --> 00:58:13,960
We only have one day left.

820
00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:16,460
Hye In's father suddenly
went missing.

821
00:58:16,730 --> 00:58:17,730
What?

822
00:58:18,469 --> 00:58:20,739
What did you do last Monday night?

823
00:58:20,739 --> 00:58:22,400
You're suspecting me?

824
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:25,039
Kill a friend so we can live?

825
00:58:25,909 --> 00:58:28,679
It means you all probably
know the abductor.
