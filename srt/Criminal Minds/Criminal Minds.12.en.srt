(Episode 12)

10
00:01:32,099 --> 00:01:34,200
We've received an order from
the Justice Department.

11
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:41,939
In the past 10 years,

12
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,280
bizarre and brutal crimes that
the police can't expect...

13
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:50,049
have increased significantly.

14
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:52,849
The decision on resuming
capital punishment...

15
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:54,790
was determined...

16
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:58,120
after a long consideration
to prevent this.

17
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:00,159
I believe that...

18
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:03,030
there will be a lot of domestic
and international opposition.

19
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,359
Capital punishment is starting again
after 20 years,

20
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:11,069
and it's been decided before
clarifying the additional...

21
00:02:11,069 --> 00:02:12,840
crimes of the criminals.

22
00:02:12,969 --> 00:02:16,169
It seems they want you
to settle this as fast as you can.

23
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:20,509
Since it's a serious matter,

24
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:25,050
they think involving the NCI
is necessary...

25
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:27,490
to prevent any possible
opposition...

26
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:30,150
from the public.

27
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:34,830
Rather than searching for
additional crimes,

28
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:38,530
the government is looking for a
justification to show its citizens.

29
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:44,599
After brutally murdering a total
of 12 women in their 20s,

30
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:48,169
Young Hoon and Ahn Yeo Jin
were given the death penalty.

31
00:02:48,169 --> 00:02:50,840
It's been three days
since the capital punishment...

32
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,210
on the two murderers
has been finalized.

33
00:02:53,509 --> 00:02:55,849
It's the first execution since
December 31, 1997,

34
00:02:55,849 --> 00:02:58,580
when 23 convicted felons were
executed.

35
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:01,319
As it's been 20 years since the
last execution,

36
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:03,620
there has been a lot of interest
by the citizens...

37
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:06,020
and debates over the support of
the death penalty.

38
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,030
There's less than 48 hours
left until the execution,

39
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,930
and the NCI team has been
assigned the case.

40
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:15,270
As a result, the media is focusing
on whether or not they will find...

41
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:17,699
additional crimes committed by
Jo Young Hoon and Ahn Yeo Jin.

42
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:23,580
It's the serial killer couple,
Jo Young Hoon and Ahn Yeo Jin.

43
00:03:23,979 --> 00:03:25,909
15 years ago, in 2002,

44
00:03:25,909 --> 00:03:29,750
12 unidentified dead bodies
have been discovered in the yard...

45
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:32,580
of a house in Seoul,
Youngsan-gu, 870 Ohsan-dong.

46
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:35,849
When it was revealed that
that these remains belonged...

47
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:38,020
to women in their 20s who have
been missing since the early 2000s,

48
00:03:38,289 --> 00:03:40,360
the whole nation was shocked.

49
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:42,930
What do they mean
by additional crimes?

50
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,169
Are there any more victims
aside from the 12 women...

51
00:03:47,169 --> 00:03:48,900
they already confessed to murdering?

52
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:52,599
Two days ago, the remains of a body
were found in a construction site.

53
00:03:52,969 --> 00:03:55,969
Yoon Joo Hee. After being seen
on the surveillance camera...

54
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:59,539
in the university area,
she's been missing for 15 years.

55
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:02,780
The construction site
where her body was found...

56
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:06,620
was where the houses that
Jo Young Hoon, an architect, built.

57
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:10,960
According to the forensics,
their unique murder pattern,

58
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,419
eight times of cutting...

59
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:16,529
and the way the body is buried
are very similar.

60
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:19,529
Above all, the period Yoon Joo Hee
went missing...

61
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:21,370
matches the other victims.

62
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:23,939
As their execution has already been
determined...

63
00:04:24,069 --> 00:04:26,139
when this woman's remains
were found,

64
00:04:26,139 --> 00:04:29,639
the government wants us to resolve
this case as soon as possible.

65
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:31,310
I want you...

66
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:34,209
to go with Min Young to the house
they lived in.

67
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,810
Then meet us at the prison.

68
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,050
Yes, sir.

69
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:47,730
Ahn Yeo Jin confessed that
she murdered her son, Jo Si On,

70
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:49,990
but she didn't admit...

71
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,000
to the other 12 murders.

72
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,829
At first, she kept her silence,

73
00:04:54,069 --> 00:04:57,269
but later she confessed to engaging
in the murders with Jo Young Hoon.

74
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:00,540
Then she took an ambiguous attitude
by changing her testimony.

75
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:03,569
Is she trying to hide the additional
victims?

76
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:06,110
Do you think...

77
00:05:06,709 --> 00:05:09,649
Yoon Joo Hee is the last victim
the couple murdered?

78
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:13,319
Unlike Jo Young Hoon
who likes to show off his crime,

79
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:16,850
Ahn Yeo Jin was uncooperative
with the media in the prison,

80
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,060
so she got a nickname "Cold Witch".

81
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:22,459
The media probably exaggerated...

82
00:05:22,459 --> 00:05:24,629
after observing her in the court.

83
00:05:25,699 --> 00:05:28,670
Ahn Yeo Jin even murdered
her two-year-old son.

84
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:32,339
Not only that, but she buried...

85
00:05:32,339 --> 00:05:33,569
12 innocent women in their 20s.

86
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:37,339
There's something more important
than the number of women she killed.

87
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:40,410
In 38 hours,

88
00:05:40,579 --> 00:05:44,250
the victims who have not
been found yet...

89
00:05:44,819 --> 00:05:47,449
will be buried with those
two people for good.

90
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:15,110
(Gentle words are more powerful
than threatening words.)

91
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:18,250
(Yield and be consider to others
to create a better personality.)

92
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:20,790
In the remaining 36 hours,

93
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:24,519
two guards will constantly stand by.

94
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:27,959
Until the execution,

95
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:30,759
you'll be staying in a special
solitary confinement.

96
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,230
We will give you your personal
belongings as soon as they arrive.

97
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:37,800
(Gentle words are more powerful
than threatening words.)

98
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:40,709
(Restricted Area)

99
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:47,310
We will give you...

100
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:50,649
the food you want
for your last meal.

101
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,149
Is there anything in particular
that you would like to eat?

102
00:06:58,959 --> 00:06:59,959
Director.

103
00:07:01,589 --> 00:07:03,490
Isn't there going to be a full moon
tomorrow?

104
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,930
I want to see the last full moon
instead of getting my last meal.

105
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:15,240
That is against the rules.

106
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:43,329
Do you think Yoon Joo Hee...

107
00:07:43,939 --> 00:07:46,899
really is the last victim
that the couple has killed?

108
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:54,379
Our job is to find out the truth
by profiling the culprits...

109
00:07:54,379 --> 00:07:56,250
within the given time.

110
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:59,420
Yoon Joo Hee might not be
the last victim...

111
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,490
that Jo Young Hoon has killed.

112
00:08:33,649 --> 00:08:34,950
(Seohyun Prison Control Room,
Tuesday, 10:35 am)

113
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:36,950
In 2001, in the northeast area
of Seoul,

114
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:40,259
female students in their 20's
began to go missing.

115
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:43,029
The police received a tip
from an anonymous informant...

116
00:08:43,029 --> 00:08:46,529
who told them that she had seen
Jo Young Hoon...

117
00:08:46,529 --> 00:08:47,769
with the students.

118
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,299
The identity of the female informant
has not been revealed yet.

119
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:53,299
The police interrogated him,

120
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:56,769
and Ahn Yeo Jin and their son were
also present at the interrogation.

121
00:08:57,009 --> 00:09:00,009
The police sensed his abnormal
mentality through interrogation,

122
00:09:00,009 --> 00:09:03,649
and when they went to his house
three hours later with a warrant,

123
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:05,679
but his son had already
disappeared.

124
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:08,250
Instead, below his workroom,

125
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:10,960
they found 12 dismembered bodies
of the missing students.

126
00:09:12,659 --> 00:09:15,360
Jo Young Hoon decided to run away
to escape from the police,

127
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,299
and ordered Ahn Yeo Jin
to kill their son...

128
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,830
and to get rid of the dead body.

129
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:23,070
Jo Young Hoon testified that
he had found 12 victims...

130
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,539
with Ahn Yeo Jin and killed them
after abducting them.

131
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,009
Now, the number of victims
have been increased to 13.

132
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:33,179
And numerous pictures have been
found at his house.

133
00:09:33,179 --> 00:09:36,809
The report says that Jo Young Hoon
has pedophilic characteristics.

134
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,549
If you look at the pictures he took
before he killed the victims,

135
00:09:42,549 --> 00:09:46,759
the victims are wearing clothes
that are usually worn by children.

136
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:49,389
If you look at crimes committed
by people with Lolita Complex,

137
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,899
they have unique characteristics...

138
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:54,230
in which the victims' arms and legs
are cut off.

139
00:09:54,299 --> 00:09:58,799
Unlike Jo Young Hoon who was
reported to have a sexual disorder,

140
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:02,139
the police couldn't conclude
the state of Ahn Yeo Jin.

141
00:10:02,139 --> 00:10:05,379
It's highly likely that Ahn Yeo Jin
was a hybristophilia.

142
00:10:05,379 --> 00:10:06,409
(Hybristophiliac refers to women who
are attracted to criminals.)

143
00:10:06,409 --> 00:10:09,279
It's something like what happened
in "Bonnie and Clyde".

144
00:10:09,649 --> 00:10:12,750
Jo Young Hoon is under the
delusion...

145
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:15,519
that he has full control
over his victims.

146
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:18,860
He doesn't seem to be regretting
or blaming himself for the crime.

147
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:22,490
He would think of Ahn Yeo Jin
as something that he owns.

148
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:25,830
That's why he thinks he can rule
over her and be obeyed.

149
00:10:26,029 --> 00:10:27,529
Talk to him.

150
00:10:27,629 --> 00:10:28,629
Yes, sir.

151
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:31,700
You probably won't get
much out of him.

152
00:10:41,549 --> 00:10:44,549
Ahn Yeo Jin looked for the victims
from a nearby college.

153
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:47,250
And the victims came here...

154
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,649
after they saw the advertisement
that she posted.

155
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:54,090
It was an advertisement looking for
an assistant of Jo Young Hoon,

156
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:56,129
who was an architect.

157
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,570
This must have been his workroom.

158
00:11:25,389 --> 00:11:27,389
The worktable would have been
here somewhere.

159
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:33,929
And over the arched door,

160
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:36,029
there would have been a room
for torture.

161
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,120
The wounds from
the victims' bodies...

162
00:11:59,889 --> 00:12:03,059
match the tools that were in
his workroom.

163
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:08,100
He dismembered the dead bodies
here with his tools.

164
00:12:13,139 --> 00:12:15,110
And he would have buried them...

165
00:12:15,809 --> 00:12:17,370
under the floor over there.

166
00:12:25,149 --> 00:12:26,879
If you look at his records,

167
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:30,720
there is evidence that indicate
he was abused by his parents.

168
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:32,860
In that case,

169
00:12:34,059 --> 00:12:36,190
how do you think
Ahn Yeo Jin's childhood was like?

170
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:38,730
Her mother has never agreed
to do an interview...

171
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:41,570
during the last 15 years.

172
00:12:42,669 --> 00:12:44,299
It would be different now.

173
00:12:44,299 --> 00:12:48,210
Now, Ahn Yeo Jin was ordered
to be executed.

174
00:12:50,309 --> 00:12:52,110
Let's go meet her mother.

175
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,279
All right.

176
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:06,759
The hall in front of
the condemned cells...

177
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:10,690
are referred to the prison officers
as the way to the underworld.

178
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:20,769
Has Ahn Yeo Jin...

179
00:13:21,139 --> 00:13:22,940
met Jo Young Hoon
after she came here?

180
00:13:23,509 --> 00:13:26,940
No, after she was
sentenced to death,

181
00:13:27,549 --> 00:13:29,779
she said that she won't meet anyone.

182
00:13:29,779 --> 00:13:32,580
We have separated her from
other prisoners...

183
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:35,649
for her safety as well.

184
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:10,289
These are great works of art.

185
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,759
I had a lot of time here.

186
00:14:13,389 --> 00:14:15,629
The Director allowed me to do it.

187
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,299
I heard you wanted to
ask me something.

188
00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:23,730
I think it's time...

189
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:28,039
the victims' families found out
why they had to die.

190
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:56,269
Who are you?

191
00:14:59,269 --> 00:15:01,940
Are you Ahn Yeo Jin's mother?

192
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:05,710
We're from NCI.

193
00:15:07,009 --> 00:15:09,809
We have a few things to ask you
regarding your daughter.

194
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:14,820
It's true that I gave birth to her.

195
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:18,759
And it's true that she met
a scumbag as a husband...

196
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:21,889
and buried those women
under her house.

197
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:24,799
What more do you want to know?

198
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:29,100
She told us...

199
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:32,370
that she will tell us
why she killed...

200
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:33,769
these women.

201
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:37,039
I know it's hard for you,

202
00:15:37,809 --> 00:15:40,309
but please talk to us
for your daughter's sake.

203
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:11,980
Ma'am.

204
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:16,850
May I ask you how she was
during her childhood?

205
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:21,090
She had a normal life like you.

206
00:16:21,389 --> 00:16:23,090
She grew up well.

207
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,389
If only she never met that scumbag.

208
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:33,559
She was very gentle.

209
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:37,370
She did pretty well at school.

210
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,169
She was also good at drawing.

211
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:01,860
How was her relationship
with her father?

212
00:17:03,929 --> 00:17:04,930
Was she...

213
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:09,029
abused by her father?

214
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:14,140
I admit her father was pretty
strict.

215
00:17:15,269 --> 00:17:17,410
They used to argue a lot...

216
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:21,480
because they never agreed
with each other.

217
00:17:23,049 --> 00:17:25,750
What's the point of all this?

218
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:29,589
My husband is dead,
and my daughter is about to die.

219
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:34,730
If we get to know her childhood
and her relationships,

220
00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:40,259
we could find out how she was
involved in such matter.

221
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:47,269
Jo Young Hoon probably
kept Ahn Yeo Jin alive...

222
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,470
because they have
something in common.

223
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:52,940
It looks like...

224
00:17:54,109 --> 00:17:58,420
your daughter tried to share
Jo Young Hoon's pain until the end.

225
00:18:00,549 --> 00:18:04,920
Did your husband often
physically abuse her?

226
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:10,859
Still...

227
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:13,660
Yeo Jin...

228
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,200
didn't get beaten as much as I did.

229
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:22,410
You could've run away with her.

230
00:18:24,009 --> 00:18:26,710
I had no place to go with her.

231
00:18:30,049 --> 00:18:32,549
I wasn't confident enough
to live on my own.

232
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:37,319
I was worried about getting caught.

233
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:39,990
Did you report...

234
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:44,390
Jo Young Hoon's crimes...

235
00:18:45,099 --> 00:18:46,730
yourself 15 years ago?

236
00:18:49,829 --> 00:18:51,200
It wasn't me,

237
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,900
but...

238
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:56,869
I know who it is.

239
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:17,160
The mailman...

240
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:21,329
gave it to me this morning.

241
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:39,549
How did you get a doctorate
at such a young age?

242
00:19:40,519 --> 00:19:42,420
You must've studied a lot.

243
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,619
Your mother must be proud of you.

244
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,720
Thank you.

245
00:19:58,970 --> 00:19:59,970
Yeo Jin.

246
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,809
Ahn Yeo Jin.

247
00:20:03,109 --> 00:20:05,180
Do you still remember what I said?

248
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:07,140
We'll be recorded in history.

249
00:20:07,579 --> 00:20:09,450
This is our fate.

250
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:12,150
Our names will be remembered
for eternity.

251
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:13,150
Get out.

252
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:16,619
People will always remember us.

253
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:19,519
We can kill for real if we want.

254
00:20:19,589 --> 00:20:21,960
Do you know how happy that is?

255
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:23,589
Right, Yeo Jin?

256
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,130
Say it.

257
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:27,799
Say it.

258
00:20:29,569 --> 00:20:31,839
Did you make us encounter
on purpose?

259
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:36,970
And did you find something?

260
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:38,839
Yes?

261
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:48,750
38 out of 40 on the PCLI test.

262
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:52,589
You've been diagnosed with severe
antisocial personality disorder.

263
00:20:53,789 --> 00:20:55,490
It's not antisocial
personality disorder,

264
00:20:56,029 --> 00:20:57,690
but sexual disorder.

265
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:02,430
I think you have a beautiful smile,

266
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:05,039
but you're not smiling at all.

267
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,369
When I see an anxious face,

268
00:21:09,509 --> 00:21:11,109
I flutter.

269
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,549
Are there any more victims
besides the bodies discovered?

270
00:21:16,509 --> 00:21:17,579
If I tell you,

271
00:21:19,579 --> 00:21:21,549
what will you give me?

272
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:25,559
I'll give you a chance to ease
the pain of the victims' families.

273
00:21:30,529 --> 00:21:31,730
Justice apostle?

274
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:43,710
Uncuff her.

275
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:55,819
Thank you.

276
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,559
I need to flex to grab a brush.

277
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:01,319
What's the best thing...

278
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:03,559
about drawing?

279
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,029
Freedom?

280
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:14,500
Min Young. What can I help you with?

281
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,670
I need to talk to Team Manager Kang.
Is he available?

282
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:18,809
Of course.

283
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,009
I think it's fine. Hold on.

284
00:22:26,549 --> 00:22:29,250
Team Manager Kang, it's Min Young.
I think it's emergency.

285
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:30,250
Really?

286
00:22:30,619 --> 00:22:31,759
Team Manager Kang.

287
00:22:32,019 --> 00:22:34,619
I'm at Ahn Yeo Jin's parents' house.

288
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:36,690
Her mother gave me a letter.

289
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:39,730
I thought you need to know this
immediately.

290
00:22:40,029 --> 00:22:41,130
Read the letter.

291
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:44,099
- Mom.
- Mom.

292
00:22:44,099 --> 00:22:48,170
I know how much you're suffering
from this.

293
00:22:48,609 --> 00:22:49,940
When we come to think of it,

294
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:51,710
we were far from...

295
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:55,809
normal mom and daughter
relationships.

296
00:22:55,809 --> 00:22:57,009
I'm aware that...

297
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,079
you didn't have any other choice.

298
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:03,319
That's my personal story.

299
00:23:03,819 --> 00:23:06,819
Now that I'm a mother,

300
00:23:06,819 --> 00:23:09,359
I understand how you felt
in the past.

301
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:11,930
Understanding you...

302
00:23:12,029 --> 00:23:14,559
is the second gift I received
in this world.

303
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:16,900
I have something to tell you.

304
00:23:17,769 --> 00:23:20,339
It's about the first gift
I received.

305
00:23:21,269 --> 00:23:23,509
- The biggest gift I received...
- The biggest gift I received...

306
00:23:23,509 --> 00:23:25,410
is that people like you and me...

307
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,509
are somewhere that is
unimaginably far.

308
00:23:30,349 --> 00:23:32,650
As a mother and as a woman,

309
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:36,720
I didn't fulfill my duty,

310
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:39,420
so many children died.

311
00:23:40,059 --> 00:23:41,460
Every time I think about it,

312
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:44,799
I can't sleep at all.

313
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,559
Stop. Please stop.

314
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:47,960
Stop it. Stop.

315
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:55,809
It's fine. It's fine.

316
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:04,180
Did you say you didn't fulfill
your duty?

317
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:08,819
You didn't kill the victims,
did you?

318
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:13,519
Why didn't you testify at court?

319
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,890
I brought...

320
00:24:17,089 --> 00:24:20,960
female university students
to my husband's workplace.

321
00:24:21,329 --> 00:24:25,099
Isn't that because he said
he needed helpers?

322
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,500
No.

323
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:31,369
If I had paid attention,

324
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,980
I probably could've noticed.

325
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,579
That's...

326
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:38,279
completely different from
getting involved in a murder.

327
00:24:40,049 --> 00:24:41,720
Considering the letter,

328
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:45,690
you're trying to receive
the death sentence...

329
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,190
for the crime you didn't commit.

330
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,900
I don't think this will be enough
to receive a suspension.

331
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:59,900
To understand Jo Young Hoon
and Ahn Yeo Jin,

332
00:25:00,099 --> 00:25:02,640
we must approach them
as mentally ill patients.

333
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,710
Jo Young Hoon's desire developed
from emotional, mental,

334
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:08,750
and sexual abuse his mother had done
to him.

335
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,509
Through repeated abuse,

336
00:25:11,509 --> 00:25:13,650
he not only suffered from
a psychological trauma...

337
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:17,019
but he also created virtual reality
on twisted love.

338
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:19,259
He captured the victims,

339
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:21,829
and by looking at his signatures
on their bodies,

340
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:23,630
he fulfilled his fantasy.

341
00:25:24,259 --> 00:25:28,130
He was probably alone every time
his mother abused him.

342
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,170
To activate the virtual reality
he created,

343
00:25:31,269 --> 00:25:34,170
he must be alone with a victim.

344
00:25:35,109 --> 00:25:38,539
That means, when he commits murder,
it's his own world...

345
00:25:38,839 --> 00:25:40,740
where no one can interrupt.

346
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,849
If Ahn Yeo Jin was there with him,

347
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:46,319
she would be dead by now.

348
00:25:46,549 --> 00:25:50,549
But she confessed that
she killed her son.

349
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:53,819
She implied that she murdered
the women as well.

350
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:56,490
Team Manager Kang.

351
00:25:57,289 --> 00:26:01,230
Ahn Yeo Jin is the anonymous
reporter who reported Jo's murders.

352
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:04,630
She suffered from endless guilt.

353
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:06,970
She regretted and blamed herself
for a long time.

354
00:26:09,769 --> 00:26:11,140
When you read this letter,

355
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:13,640
you can't see the profile
of a woman who killed...

356
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,650
13 women and her own son.

357
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:22,690
Does that mean she chose to die...

358
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:25,160
by making a false confession?

359
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,289
For what reason?

360
00:26:27,089 --> 00:26:30,089
She might be in a failed
cognition state.

361
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:33,559
It's a mental state that forces her
to choose death...

362
00:26:33,799 --> 00:26:37,730
when she's in danger
of under stress.

363
00:26:38,069 --> 00:26:40,039
I once saw a study that said...

364
00:26:40,039 --> 00:26:41,970
30 percent of culprits of the
violent crimes cases that were...

365
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:44,470
found innocent on the second trial
after being found guilty at first...

366
00:26:44,869 --> 00:26:47,480
have made false confessions.

367
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,650
The most important reasons why...

368
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:52,480
the culprits make
false confessions is...

369
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:55,920
because they are being controlled
and have now self-control.

370
00:26:56,619 --> 00:27:01,259
It must be a result of having been
controlled by Jo Young Hoon.

371
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:02,829
But we need...

372
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:06,099
more solid evidence.

373
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:09,269
If we prove that Jo Young Hoon
was the one that killed his son,

374
00:27:09,799 --> 00:27:11,000
Ahn Yeo Jin...

375
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:15,140
would be able to get
a suspended death sentence.

376
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,410
She's protecting her paintings.

377
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:23,349
It's like she's protecting
her child.

378
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,519
Drawing is one way...

379
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:28,990
people express themselves.

380
00:27:30,619 --> 00:27:33,990
We need to find out what they mean.

381
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:35,660
- Execute them.
- Execute them.

382
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:37,130
- Stop.
- Stop.

383
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:38,500
- Execute them.
- Stop the execution.

384
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,599
- Execute them.
- Stop the execution.

385
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:41,430
- We are against execution.
- We are against execution.

386
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:43,599
- We are against execution.
- We are against execution.

387
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:45,369
We are against execution.

388
00:27:45,369 --> 00:27:46,670
- We are against execution.
- We are against execution.

389
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:47,839
- We are against execution.
- We are against execution.

390
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,769
- Execute them.
- Stop the execution.

391
00:27:49,769 --> 00:27:51,440
- Execute them.
- Stop the execution.

392
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,579
- Execute them.
- Stop the execution.

393
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:56,380
While people want to know if...

394
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:59,049
there are more victims of
Jo Young Hoon and Ahn Yeo Jin,

395
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:02,190
domestic and foreign media
are all interested in...

396
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:04,890
the activities of NCI who have
gone inside to interrogate.

397
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:06,789
With the revival of death sentence
after 20 years,

398
00:28:06,789 --> 00:28:09,259
everyone is interested and
there are never ending conflicts...

399
00:28:09,259 --> 00:28:11,230
regarding whether there it should
exist or not.

400
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:14,059
This just in,
NCI will be discussing...

401
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:17,630
the suspension of the death sentence
with Ministry of Justice.

402
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:20,970
And the tension is building here
in front of Seohyun Prison.

403
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,339
YTB will be reporting...

404
00:28:23,339 --> 00:28:24,869
until the last minute,
the last second,

405
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:27,779
so as to broadcast the situations
of the victims.

406
00:28:29,349 --> 00:28:31,180
Who gives them such information?

407
00:28:32,049 --> 00:28:33,349
Calm down, Min Young.

408
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,250
That's not what's important.

409
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:39,890
Sun Woo doesn't seem to be able to
get anything from him.

410
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:42,730
Call her. I'll go inside.

411
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,099
You?

412
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:48,359
- Okay.
- I want to go inside too.

413
00:28:49,299 --> 00:28:50,329
All right.

414
00:28:52,769 --> 00:28:56,640
I prefer the woman who came in
before to interrogate me.

415
00:28:58,509 --> 00:29:00,140
Isn't she coming?

416
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:11,019
Just kidding. It was a joke.

417
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:26,700
Who is this...

418
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:29,410
beautiful woman?

419
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:33,440
I'm the Public Information Officer
of NCI, Yoo Min Young.

420
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:37,650
Your voice is really...

421
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,819
Jo Young Hoon.

422
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,250
Sit down.

423
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:49,990
Hello, Yoo Min Young.

424
00:29:57,769 --> 00:29:59,240
Sit down, Jo Young Hoon.

425
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:05,509
Yes.

426
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,079
You too, Min Young.

427
00:30:32,839 --> 00:30:34,470
I went too far.

428
00:30:39,339 --> 00:30:41,539
It's good to see you smile.

429
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:43,549
Thank you.

430
00:30:44,849 --> 00:30:46,549
You don't smile often, do you?

431
00:30:49,619 --> 00:30:52,420
It seems like you haven't smiled
in a while.

432
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:01,500
I brought these from your room.

433
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:05,369
It's just a personal hobby.

434
00:31:08,539 --> 00:31:09,940
I don't know where this is,

435
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,140
but the river is flowing gently.

436
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,880
A child who is running freely.

437
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:24,420
12 roses.

438
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:27,859
You drew one rose for each victim...

439
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:30,589
that Jo Young Hoon has killed.

440
00:31:33,859 --> 00:31:34,930
This painting...

441
00:31:37,099 --> 00:31:38,769
is where you are wrong.

442
00:31:43,369 --> 00:31:44,769
It's not 12.

443
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:46,710
It has to be 13 roses.

444
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,480
In fact,

445
00:31:50,849 --> 00:31:52,980
the 13th victim was found yesterday.

446
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:58,720
It seems like you don't know...

447
00:31:59,259 --> 00:32:00,720
about the 13th victim.

448
00:32:03,589 --> 00:32:05,089
In fact,

449
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:09,400
you don't know any of the victims.

450
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:14,940
Of course, you didn't post
the advertisements.

451
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:18,069
As I told you before...

452
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:19,210
It's also a lie...

453
00:32:20,039 --> 00:32:23,450
that you are the one
who led the victims to his workroom.

454
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:27,420
Ahn Yeo Jin.

455
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:30,950
You've been working at
an art academy...

456
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:34,190
even before Jo Young Hoon
started killing in 2002.

457
00:32:35,329 --> 00:32:37,230
I've looked into your
work records...

458
00:32:38,259 --> 00:32:39,759
and found out that
you've been working...

459
00:32:39,759 --> 00:32:42,099
nearly all day
including the personal tutoring.

460
00:32:43,099 --> 00:32:46,599
But you insist that you took
the students to him...

461
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,710
during daytime.

462
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:52,210
But why...

463
00:32:53,009 --> 00:32:54,680
didn't they find out the alibi...

464
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,410
during the first investigation
15 years ago?

465
00:32:58,450 --> 00:32:59,450
That was...

466
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:03,490
because of your confession.

467
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:08,859
You don't know anything about
the 13 victims...

468
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:11,130
that he had killed.

469
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:13,859
Why did you make a false confession?

470
00:33:16,829 --> 00:33:18,200
He can no longer...

471
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:21,369
hurt you.

472
00:33:22,369 --> 00:33:25,579
Do you really want to know
how many more women...

473
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,250
I buried?

474
00:33:30,349 --> 00:33:35,079
I really wanted to have someone
like that before I die.

475
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:38,890
How about this?

476
00:33:41,289 --> 00:33:43,230
Do me a favor.

477
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:48,430
Then I will tell you everything
about the women I buried.

478
00:33:51,069 --> 00:33:52,099
That means...

479
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:57,609
there are more victims,
doesn't it?

480
00:33:58,740 --> 00:33:59,779
Don't you want that?

481
00:34:01,309 --> 00:34:03,509
There's nothing to lose.

482
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:06,779
All right.

483
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:09,449
What do you want?

484
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:14,760
Let me...

485
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:23,000
smell Min Young's hair...

486
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,699
just once.

487
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,239
Jo Young Hoon.

488
00:34:29,539 --> 00:34:31,210
Stop fooling around.

489
00:34:31,809 --> 00:34:32,809
Why?

490
00:34:33,579 --> 00:34:34,980
That's not too hard.

491
00:34:37,949 --> 00:34:40,050
And it's for her to decide.

492
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:43,889
Let's do it.

493
00:34:45,289 --> 00:34:46,289
Min Young.

494
00:34:47,389 --> 00:34:49,960
Why did you confess
that you killed your son?

495
00:34:54,059 --> 00:34:55,869
Why did you lie?

496
00:34:57,599 --> 00:34:59,239
I didn't.

497
00:34:59,469 --> 00:35:01,400
Then where did you bury him?

498
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:05,610
Do you...

499
00:35:06,679 --> 00:35:08,409
have a child?

500
00:35:09,079 --> 00:35:11,710
It has nothing to do with this case.

501
00:35:12,179 --> 00:35:15,079
Do you carry around
a photo of your child?

502
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:17,019
Stop changing the subject,
and answer me.

503
00:35:17,519 --> 00:35:19,119
Where is his body?

504
00:35:22,289 --> 00:35:24,230
Do you really think so?

505
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:50,889
Now...

506
00:35:52,219 --> 00:35:54,760
is it my turn to reply?

507
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,659
How old would Si On be...

508
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:01,800
by now?

509
00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:06,000
If he were alive,

510
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:10,510
he'd be about 16 or 17.

511
00:36:11,639 --> 00:36:15,309
You must be very curious of
how he'd have grown,

512
00:36:19,349 --> 00:36:23,690
since Jo Young Hoon eliminated the
chance for you to see your son.

513
00:36:24,389 --> 00:36:26,820
You must be very stressed
from your job.

514
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:35,699
Doesn't your wife have a hard time
because of your pressure from work?

515
00:36:36,469 --> 00:36:38,130
I don't have a wife.

516
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,469
I think that's a wedding ring.

517
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:51,750
Why are you still protecting
Jo Young Hoon?

518
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:54,849
You're not living with your wife,
right?

519
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:59,289
I think you are innocent.

520
00:37:04,789 --> 00:37:06,659
All people are guilty.

521
00:37:09,099 --> 00:37:11,199
But why should little children
suffer...

522
00:37:12,539 --> 00:37:15,739
because of the sins we've committed?

523
00:37:19,539 --> 00:37:20,710
Do you have children?

524
00:37:25,349 --> 00:37:26,579
How old are they?

525
00:37:27,849 --> 00:37:29,119
What are their names?

526
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:31,050
He's six years old.

527
00:37:31,949 --> 00:37:33,059
Kang Han Byul.

528
00:37:35,090 --> 00:37:37,429
What a pretty name.

529
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:40,760
If you happen to...

530
00:37:41,659 --> 00:37:45,230
have a photo, could you
show it to me?

531
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,369
I don't carry around a photo.

532
00:37:53,579 --> 00:37:55,210
Is it because of your job?

533
00:37:57,309 --> 00:38:01,150
Your job might put him in risk.

534
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:05,190
You want to protect your child.

535
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:10,059
You want to leave Han Byul
in a safer,

536
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:13,559
cleaner place.

537
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:18,530
Did you commit the murder
to protect Si On...

538
00:38:19,269 --> 00:38:20,840
from Jo Young Hoon?

539
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:24,309
As you protect Han Byul,

540
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:27,840
I am protecting my Si On too.

541
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:30,809
Then where did you bury him?

542
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:33,380
What's important is that...

543
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,619
my Si On is safe.

544
00:38:37,519 --> 00:38:38,719
Where is he?

545
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:41,519
In a better place than this.

546
00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:51,300
The women I've buried...

547
00:38:57,409 --> 00:38:58,909
There's no more.

548
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,219
There's no more.

549
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:24,300
Oh, right.

550
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:30,670
Do you know that the Justice
Department postponed...

551
00:39:31,809 --> 00:39:33,039
Ahn Yeo Jin's execution?

552
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:35,039
What?

553
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:37,880
There's no way.

554
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:42,590
There's no way.

555
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:44,690
There's no evidence that
Ahn Yeo Jin...

556
00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:47,090
killed her own son.

557
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:48,920
You know that.

558
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:51,989
Don't play tricks on me.

559
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:56,300
Ahn Yeo Jin killed him.

560
00:39:56,929 --> 00:39:58,599
I know.

561
00:40:01,469 --> 00:40:02,469
Take him away.

562
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:09,550
Do you want me to tell you...

563
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:14,119
the exact place Si On is buried?

564
00:40:15,519 --> 00:40:18,550
Do you want me to tell you...

565
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:22,159
the exact place Si On is buried?

566
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:24,960
I'm sure it's around here.

567
00:40:25,929 --> 00:40:29,329
Jo Young Hoon undertook the
construction of that balcony.

568
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:32,030
If the parents look from there,

569
00:40:32,369 --> 00:40:34,039
they'd have a clear view.

570
00:40:43,579 --> 00:40:46,980
There was an arched gate like this
in Jo Young Hoon's workshop.

571
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,679
Yes, you're right.

572
00:40:57,889 --> 00:40:59,400
Lolita complex.

573
00:41:00,199 --> 00:41:01,960
Then what's this round door?

574
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:04,199
The mother's womb.

575
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:09,070
Jo Young Hoon despised
his biological mother.

576
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:10,869
And simultaneously missed her.

577
00:41:11,369 --> 00:41:15,010
He projected his childhood
onto his victims.

578
00:41:15,010 --> 00:41:16,579
A child's helpless and passive
attitude...

579
00:41:16,579 --> 00:41:19,349
that symbolizes
the Lolita complex...

580
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:21,880
disproves that.

581
00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:33,599
(Tuesday, 1pm,
8 hours before the execution)

582
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:35,599
We identified the dead body.

583
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:38,000
It's not Ahn Yeo Jin's son.

584
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:39,400
Choi Seol Ah.

585
00:41:39,699 --> 00:41:42,539
She was 19 when she was murdered.

586
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:46,440
Why did Jo Young Hoon give the info
on another victim?

587
00:41:46,909 --> 00:41:48,010
It goes against his desire for...

588
00:41:48,010 --> 00:41:50,480
power, control, and dominance.

589
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:53,449
Taking the secrets of his victims
to his grave...

590
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:56,690
is probably what satisfies
Jo Young Hoon's desires.

591
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:58,750
Why did he give that up now?

592
00:41:59,090 --> 00:42:00,590
It must be because of Ahn Yeo Jin.

593
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:04,860
Ahn Yeo Jin will become
Jo Young Hoon's last victim,

594
00:42:05,059 --> 00:42:06,929
who satisfies his desires.

595
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:09,869
The moment Ahn Yeo Jin
gets executed...

596
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:12,969
is the climax that Jo Young Hoon
is yearning for.

597
00:42:13,039 --> 00:42:15,599
I'm looking into Choi Seol Ah's
acquaintances.

598
00:42:16,269 --> 00:42:19,210
In 2003, before she entered college,

599
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:21,909
Ahn Yeo Jin tutored her.

600
00:42:34,159 --> 00:42:36,659
Do you remember the girl,
Choi Seol Ah?

601
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:41,159
She didn't have much talent.

602
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:43,230
But she was a nice girl.

603
00:42:44,130 --> 00:42:46,070
We found her body buried...

604
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:48,199
under that house's back gate.

605
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:52,780
Did you refer Jo Young Hoon...

606
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:56,210
to remodel that house?

607
00:43:14,159 --> 00:43:15,530
That victim you mentioned...

608
00:43:16,070 --> 00:43:17,530
was not Si On.

609
00:43:19,739 --> 00:43:21,139
Oh, it wasn't?

610
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:26,510
Then who was it again?

611
00:43:28,510 --> 00:43:29,579
That girl...

612
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:33,050
She'd just barely graduated
from high school.

613
00:43:35,949 --> 00:43:39,190
Right. Yes, of course.

614
00:43:41,059 --> 00:43:42,059
Seol Ah.

615
00:43:42,889 --> 00:43:45,059
She was so pretty like her name.

616
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:48,130
I'll ask you one last time.

617
00:43:49,869 --> 00:43:52,739
How many more girls have you buried?

618
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:56,170
I don't have much time left.

619
00:43:56,809 --> 00:43:58,809
Don't you want to just
stop asking those questions,

620
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:01,710
and pray for me instead?

621
00:44:03,449 --> 00:44:04,550
Guard.

622
00:44:07,179 --> 00:44:08,849
I want to be alone.

623
00:44:09,449 --> 00:44:10,619
Don't kid yourself.

624
00:44:12,349 --> 00:44:14,090
It's not over yet.

625
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:17,989
Isn't that something I should say?

626
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:44,449
A flowing river surrounded
by bushes.

627
00:44:45,719 --> 00:44:47,219
There's a basket there.

628
00:44:49,929 --> 00:44:51,989
The child running on the hill...

629
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:54,230
seems to be around 10 years old.

630
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,469
But now that I'm looking at it
more closely,

631
00:44:58,699 --> 00:45:01,000
he does seem a bit older.

632
00:45:02,639 --> 00:45:05,909
Did you imagine your son when
painting this?

633
00:45:10,449 --> 00:45:13,880
Or did you base this painting
on Si On who's alive?

634
00:45:15,550 --> 00:45:16,590
I don't...

635
00:45:17,690 --> 00:45:19,659
have much time.

636
00:45:21,219 --> 00:45:23,530
Now I'd really like to be alone.

637
00:45:24,130 --> 00:45:25,260
Ahn Yeo Jin.

638
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:28,099
Where is your son right now?

639
00:45:30,099 --> 00:45:32,969
Guard. Please see him out.

640
00:46:17,179 --> 00:46:19,179
Replay my interview video
with Ahn Yeo Jin.

641
00:46:19,179 --> 00:46:20,179
Okay.

642
00:46:25,289 --> 00:46:27,389
Exodus 2:3.

643
00:46:29,690 --> 00:46:31,960
But when she could
hide him no longer,

644
00:46:32,159 --> 00:46:35,360
she got a papyrus basket
coated with tar and pitch.

645
00:46:35,530 --> 00:46:38,869
Then she placed the child among
the reeds along the river bank.

646
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:40,070
It's Moses.

647
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:43,909
The child should have drowned
in the water and died.

648
00:46:44,309 --> 00:46:46,780
Moses' mother put him
in a basket,

649
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:49,239
and hid him in the Nile River.

650
00:46:50,949 --> 00:46:52,679
Then where did you bury him?

651
00:46:53,719 --> 00:46:54,949
What's important is that...

652
00:46:56,019 --> 00:46:58,150
my Si On is safe.

653
00:46:59,019 --> 00:47:00,260
Where is he right now?

654
00:47:01,219 --> 00:47:03,289
In a better place than this.

655
00:47:03,989 --> 00:47:06,329
Jo Young Hoon didn't bury
his son.

656
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:09,429
Because Ahn Yeo Jin already
took care of it.

657
00:47:09,730 --> 00:47:13,639
Are you saying that she really
killed her son then?

658
00:47:13,699 --> 00:47:16,940
No. She sent him to somewhere safe.

659
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:20,510
That must be why she named his son
after...

660
00:47:20,510 --> 00:47:22,510
the holy hill of Jerusalem.

661
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:24,550
That means, from the moment
her son was born,

662
00:47:24,849 --> 00:47:26,820
she instinctively felt that he was
in danger.

663
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,920
We really don't have much time left.

664
00:47:34,519 --> 00:47:36,590
We have to find the son...

665
00:47:36,590 --> 00:47:38,360
if we want to delay her execution.

666
00:47:38,690 --> 00:47:40,559
The fact that Si On is alive...

667
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:44,369
is the conclusive evidence
that proves her innocence.

668
00:48:17,170 --> 00:48:19,030
Search all police and hospital
records...

669
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:21,570
from March of 2002.

670
00:48:21,739 --> 00:48:23,809
I'm searching every single local
newspaper to see...

671
00:48:23,909 --> 00:48:26,780
if there were any reports on an
abandoned child.

672
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:28,579
Yes, hello. Yes.

673
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:31,449
I'm saying that we basically...

674
00:48:31,449 --> 00:48:34,579
found the evidence to prove
Ahn Yeo Jin's innocence.

675
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:37,420
The maximum number of hours...

676
00:48:37,550 --> 00:48:39,519
Ahn Yeo Jin had to hide her son
is three hours...

677
00:48:39,519 --> 00:48:41,690
From when
the police received the report...

678
00:48:41,690 --> 00:48:43,130
to when they went to his workshop.

679
00:48:44,090 --> 00:48:47,130
According to our records,
the police went to...

680
00:48:47,130 --> 00:48:49,130
Ahn Yeo Jin's house at 6:35pm.

681
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:52,829
It was around rush hour,
so she couldn't have gone far.

682
00:48:53,869 --> 00:48:56,639
Whatever she did with Si On,
it must have been nearby.

683
00:48:56,869 --> 00:48:58,170
I'm searching for the location
Si On went missing...

684
00:48:58,170 --> 00:49:00,840
based on Ahn Yeo Jin and
Jo Young Hoon's house.

685
00:49:01,110 --> 00:49:04,550
I'm checking the address of the
students she tutored too.

686
00:49:06,949 --> 00:49:08,050
Team Manager Kang.

687
00:49:08,250 --> 00:49:11,050
There were three children that
were abandoned in March 2002.

688
00:49:11,989 --> 00:49:13,719
Among them, a two-year-old boy...

689
00:49:17,289 --> 00:49:18,389
isn't here.

690
00:49:20,099 --> 00:49:23,030
Why won't she tell us
where her son is?

691
00:49:23,570 --> 00:49:25,099
Because Jo Young Hoon is alive.

692
00:49:28,269 --> 00:49:30,440
Ahn Yeo Jin endured
this for 15 years.

693
00:49:31,139 --> 00:49:33,940
While he's alive,
she'll never reveal...

694
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:35,679
where Si On is.

695
00:49:35,679 --> 00:49:38,809
She'll be executed in an hour
regardless.

696
00:49:39,449 --> 00:49:41,219
If Si On is really alive,

697
00:49:41,349 --> 00:49:43,119
he'll never get to see his mother.

698
00:49:43,750 --> 00:49:46,460
We have to convince Ahn Yeo
Jin until then,

699
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:48,360
and find him.

700
00:49:48,619 --> 00:49:51,460
Perhaps she also...

701
00:49:52,190 --> 00:49:54,530
doesn't know where her son is?

702
00:49:55,130 --> 00:49:56,159
No.

703
00:49:57,570 --> 00:49:59,199
Ahn Yeo Jin knows.

704
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:10,480
Finally, the grand
show's about to start.

705
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:13,079
Can we?

706
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:18,820
Chief.

707
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:21,289
Please give me five minutes.

708
00:50:21,889 --> 00:50:23,760
I have to see Ahn Yeo Jin's cell.

709
00:50:24,230 --> 00:50:25,929
Give me five minutes and
I'll find evidence...

710
00:50:25,929 --> 00:50:27,300
I can't let you do that.

711
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:30,269
We've already surpassed
the official limitations.

712
00:50:30,469 --> 00:50:32,000
Just five minutes.

713
00:50:32,670 --> 00:50:34,039
Please stop now.

714
00:50:34,639 --> 00:50:37,110
You just need to give me
exactly five minutes.

715
00:50:39,510 --> 00:50:41,380
I can't give you more than five.

716
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:10,639
Thank you.

717
00:51:11,570 --> 00:51:12,940
Looking at the full moon...

718
00:51:13,809 --> 00:51:15,539
suddenly makes me want to live.

719
00:51:28,119 --> 00:51:29,320
Being alive...

720
00:51:30,530 --> 00:51:32,389
really feels good.

721
00:51:35,030 --> 00:51:36,130
Doesn't it?

722
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:03,289
When I was little, my mother...

723
00:52:04,590 --> 00:52:07,599
told me a story about the rabbit
that lives on the moon.

724
00:52:10,469 --> 00:52:13,400
Our generation believed that
while growing up.

725
00:52:14,869 --> 00:52:18,610
Did you tell your children that
story, chief?

726
00:52:20,510 --> 00:52:23,380
Of course I did.
I'm from the old generation too.

727
00:52:24,679 --> 00:52:26,780
I embellished it perfectly
and told them the story.

728
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:28,849
You must have been happy.

729
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:34,590
I once told the story to Si On too.

730
00:52:38,090 --> 00:52:41,099
The rabbit on the moon will
always keep an eye on us.

731
00:52:41,699 --> 00:52:43,000
Do you think Si On...

732
00:52:44,130 --> 00:52:45,869
still remembers me?

733
00:52:47,469 --> 00:52:49,909
I've only told him the rabbit
story once.

734
00:52:52,110 --> 00:52:54,309
But no matter where we are,

735
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:58,650
we're looking at the same moon.

736
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:00,880
That's what I told him.

737
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:05,090
Do you think he remembers?

738
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:04,079
Shall we go inside?

739
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:09,820
Thank you from the bottom of my
heart for giving me...

740
00:54:10,650 --> 00:54:12,349
an unforgettable final gift.

741
00:54:12,889 --> 00:54:14,059
Ahn Yeo Jin,

742
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:16,090
if...

743
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:19,460
there's anything left I can help you
with...

744
00:54:21,659 --> 00:54:22,829
Thank you.

745
00:54:30,510 --> 00:54:31,539
My goodness.

746
00:54:32,610 --> 00:54:34,739
Is this really Ahn Yeo Jin's son?

747
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:37,510
I'll ask the media for cooperation
to find him as fast as we can.

748
00:55:09,110 --> 00:55:12,750
Do you want to find peace
in the name of the lord?

749
00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:15,820
Yeo Jin.

750
00:55:18,489 --> 00:55:21,619
I'll wait for you there.

751
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:24,690
I achieved my own peace...

752
00:55:25,429 --> 00:55:28,500
19 times.

753
00:55:30,670 --> 00:55:33,639
Everyone was prettier than the lord.

754
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:37,409
Get moving.

755
00:55:41,539 --> 00:55:42,610
Jo Young Hoon.

756
00:55:44,349 --> 00:55:46,750
Why do you want to
embrace the secret until the end?

757
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:48,880
You probably know...

758
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:51,320
why.

759
00:55:57,489 --> 00:55:59,489
Let me go. Let me go.

760
00:56:03,570 --> 00:56:04,730
I'll walk...

761
00:56:06,199 --> 00:56:07,969
confidently on my two feet.

762
00:56:11,039 --> 00:56:12,440
Yeo Jin.

763
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:15,639
Don't be so afraid.

764
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:17,510
We'll last forever...

765
00:56:18,349 --> 00:56:19,980
even after we die.

766
00:56:23,150 --> 00:56:24,389
He just confessed...

767
00:56:24,690 --> 00:56:28,059
he killed six more people
than we know.

768
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:14,599
Do you have any last words?

769
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:26,510
I...

770
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:28,780
won.

771
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:36,380
Jo Young Hoon. Do you see this?

772
00:58:38,349 --> 00:58:41,389
It's your son, Si On,
whom you thought dead.

773
00:58:46,030 --> 00:58:47,030
No.

774
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:49,000
Your illusion is over.

775
00:58:51,099 --> 00:58:53,030
You perfectly lost.

776
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:55,800
No. No.

777
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:58,340
Stop joking. He's dead.

778
00:58:59,809 --> 00:59:03,139
Yeo Jin is coming with me.

779
00:59:04,309 --> 00:59:06,510
Do you think this is how it ends?

780
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:10,050
Don't you want to know
where the bodies are?

781
00:59:10,119 --> 00:59:11,590
You'll never know.

782
00:59:11,650 --> 00:59:13,389
I won.

783
00:59:13,590 --> 00:59:17,460
Yeo Jin belongs to me for good.

784
00:59:17,630 --> 00:59:19,760
It's my victory.

785
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:50,789
I can't let someone die...

786
00:59:50,829 --> 00:59:53,230
for the crime she didn't commit.

787
00:59:53,699 --> 00:59:57,030
If you have to live your life
as a son of a serial killer,

788
00:59:57,030 --> 00:59:58,800
what choice would you make?

789
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:01,369
It says the child's name is
Richard Ahn.

790
01:00:03,099 --> 01:00:05,039
Any last words?

791
01:00:05,170 --> 01:00:07,880
It's all for Si On.

792
01:00:08,039 --> 01:00:09,039
(Kim Hyun Jun)

793
01:00:10,949 --> 01:00:12,449
You must see this.

794
01:00:12,710 --> 01:00:15,780
Hyun Jun got arrested
as a murder suspect.
