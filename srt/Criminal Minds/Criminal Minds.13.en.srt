(Criminal Minds Korea)

9
00:00:40,549 --> 00:00:43,450
Unidentified dead bodies have been
discovered in the yard of a house.

10
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,020
It's the serial killer couple,
Jo Young Hoon and Ahn Yeo Jin.

11
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,890
Their execution has been confirmed
before we found her remains,

12
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:51,259
so the government wants us
to solve this case quickly.

13
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:55,259
Ahn Yeo Jin was the anonymous
reporter who reported Jo's murders.

14
00:00:55,259 --> 00:00:58,159
Do you really want to know
how many more women...

15
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,530
I buried?

16
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,299
Stop fooling around.

17
00:01:01,369 --> 00:01:03,399
If we want to delay
Ahn Yeo Jin's execution,

18
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:05,340
we must find the son.

19
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,280
Is this really Ahn Yeo Jin's son?

20
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:15,709
I achieved my own peace...

21
00:01:15,709 --> 00:01:18,680
19 times.

22
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:22,049
He just confessed he killed six
more people than we know.

23
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:29,430
Do you have any last words?

24
00:01:29,459 --> 00:01:31,799
I won.

25
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:33,469
Your illusion is over.

26
00:01:33,569 --> 00:01:37,540
Yeo Jin belongs to me for good.

(Episode 13)

28
00:02:32,889 --> 00:02:35,060
She cut out only the picture
from the newspaper,

29
00:02:35,259 --> 00:02:37,030
so I couldn't find the article.

30
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,500
He was two years old
when he went missing,

31
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,099
so he must be 17 now.

32
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:43,469
This must be Si On's
most recent look.

33
00:02:43,969 --> 00:02:48,110
Team Manager Kang. I searched for
Ahn's father, Ahn Sung Tae.

34
00:02:48,169 --> 00:02:50,210
Ahn Sung Tae has a record of
six years in prison...

35
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,740
for violence and attempted murder.

36
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:55,150
Even after he was released,
he was frequently imprisoned.

37
00:02:56,919 --> 00:02:59,319
Ahn Yeo Jin will never confess.

38
00:03:19,669 --> 00:03:21,409
Jo Young Hoon is dead.

39
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:26,280
He can't harm your son anymore,

40
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:30,150
so tell me where Si On is.

41
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:35,219
Let's stop this insanity.

42
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:41,759
It is...

43
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:45,360
a great gift...

44
00:03:46,229 --> 00:03:48,199
to be a parent in one's life.

45
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:51,270
But even at this moment,

46
00:03:52,069 --> 00:03:53,270
there are people...

47
00:03:54,539 --> 00:03:56,509
who are stamping on the gift.

48
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:01,849
Most parents also don't recognize
the value of the gift.

49
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:03,310
Ahn Yeo Jin.

50
00:04:04,449 --> 00:04:05,479
Tell me...

51
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,620
where Si On is.

52
00:04:08,419 --> 00:04:12,219
I made up my mind 15 years ago.

53
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,360
It had nothing to do
with my husband.

54
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:22,199
My decision was solely for Si On.

55
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:25,040
I'd like to respect your decision,

56
00:04:26,769 --> 00:04:29,540
but I can't let someone die...

57
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,879
for the crimes she didn't commit.

58
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:34,149
This...

59
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:37,779
isn't your problem.

60
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:39,750
You have no idea.

61
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:41,490
I do.

62
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:46,120
I do know why you made
that decision.

63
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:50,430
What kind of person your father was
in the past.

64
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:54,170
You said this before.

65
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,000
"Why should little children..."

66
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:02,040
"suffer..."

67
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:05,439
"because of the sins
we've committed?"

68
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:10,079
That was your own story.

69
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,589
Because you're aware of
how terrible it is...

70
00:05:14,649 --> 00:05:18,259
to live as an offender's child
in this world.

71
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:23,629
You know how traumatic it is.

72
00:05:28,269 --> 00:05:30,300
You sent Si On to a cleaner...

73
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,339
and safer place...

74
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:36,170
with no pain.

75
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:39,740
Because you wanted to keep him
where he could be happy.

76
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:44,279
We don't have much time.

77
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:46,480
Where is Si On?

78
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,019
Ahn Yeo Jin.

79
00:05:52,189 --> 00:05:54,029
Whatever the reason may be,

80
00:05:56,689 --> 00:06:00,230
I won't let
Si On lose the greatest present...

81
00:06:02,769 --> 00:06:04,500
he could get in his life.

82
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:07,509
Team Manager Kang.

83
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:09,670
What would you do...

84
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:13,750
if Han Byul had to live...

85
00:06:14,709 --> 00:06:17,980
as the son of a serial killer...

86
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:23,350
who had mutilated bodies?

87
00:06:27,329 --> 00:06:28,360
My decision...

88
00:06:29,129 --> 00:06:32,000
was the last present
I could give to Si On.

89
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:34,670
This...

90
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:37,240
doesn't involve you.

91
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:39,600
No one can stop me.

92
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:45,810
After Si On was born,
the only chance for Yeo Jin...

93
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:48,579
to get out of Jo Young Hoon's
watch...

94
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:51,779
was when she had
private lessons with students.

95
00:06:52,019 --> 00:06:55,589
Yes. And most students who
had been tutored by her...

96
00:06:55,589 --> 00:06:57,360
had affluent backgrounds.

97
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:59,089
I will examine the families...

98
00:06:59,089 --> 00:07:01,860
whose children had received lessons
from her since 2005.

99
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:05,129
I will also check if they have
any adopted children.

100
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:12,000
Come to think of it, Ahn Yeo Jin
used to ask her mother...

101
00:07:12,069 --> 00:07:15,439
to take her near the astronomical
observatory when she was a child.

102
00:07:16,009 --> 00:07:18,139
Even most of her paintings
in Yeo Jin's cell...

103
00:07:18,339 --> 00:07:22,180
had geometrical patterns
and astronomical meanings as well.

104
00:07:29,389 --> 00:07:32,620
This is a painting by a Spanish
artist, Luis Ricardo Falero.

105
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:35,029
His favorite theme was the sky.

106
00:07:35,529 --> 00:07:38,430
He mostly drew about
myths and fairies.

107
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:41,870
One of the unique traits that
his paintings show...

108
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:44,470
is the children-like smile
of women in the paintings.

109
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,839
But this one is hugging the moon.

110
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:51,009
Team Manager Kang, it says here
that Ahn Yeo Jin has taught...

111
00:07:51,009 --> 00:07:52,740
children from three families
in Bunjeong, Gyeonggi Province.

112
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:56,009
And one of these families
had adopted a child in 2004.

113
00:07:56,379 --> 00:07:58,149
Bunjeong, Gyeonggi Province?

114
00:08:00,649 --> 00:08:03,649
There is an observatory near
her mother's house.

115
00:08:04,389 --> 00:08:07,589
According to the report, she had
both love and hatred for her mother.

116
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:10,060
She must have thought that
the safest place...

117
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:12,629
was near her mother's place.

118
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:15,430
Sun Woo.

119
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:17,870
Send me the address.

120
00:08:24,209 --> 00:08:27,449
367, Hasoo 1-ro,
Bunjeong-gu, Gyeonggi Province.

121
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:30,009
He was adopted
to Go Yong Jin's family.

122
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,019
But something's strange.

123
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,759
Their son's name is Richard Ahn.

124
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:42,429
Even though his mom's name
is Hwang Seo Kyung.

125
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,590
Richard Ahn?

126
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:46,629
He has a separate address
registered under his name.

127
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,769
Send the address to Hyun Jun.

128
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:51,970
Team Manager Kang.

129
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:56,570
"The Cello Prodigy, Richard Ahn".

130
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:58,940
"Everyone is Praising
and Clapping for Him."

131
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:18,230
Sir.

132
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:21,070
We have found her son.

133
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:23,700
No one...

134
00:09:24,169 --> 00:09:26,940
has given me orders
to suspend her execution.

135
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:30,169
Before I receive an official
document about the suspension,

136
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:32,840
I have the responsibility to
carry out the law.

137
00:09:33,179 --> 00:09:36,710
My agents have gone to get her son.

138
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:39,850
We have also sent a request
to the Ministry of Justice.

139
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:42,789
Yeo Jin did not kill her own son.

140
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:46,259
If you only wait a little longer,

141
00:09:47,389 --> 00:09:49,230
you can soon meet Si On.

142
00:09:56,669 --> 00:09:58,769
Will we be able to make it on time?

143
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,769
We should at least try.

144
00:10:02,909 --> 00:10:04,779
(13 minutes before
Ahn Yeo Jin's execution)

145
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:26,330
We cannot wait any longer.

146
00:10:27,529 --> 00:10:28,830
Wait here.

147
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:30,429
Yes, sir.

148
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,179
Don't overdo yourself.

149
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,519
If, as a parent,
you could give your child...

150
00:10:45,649 --> 00:10:47,419
a life you couldn't even dream of,

151
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,320
you would have probably
done the same thing.

152
00:10:54,789 --> 00:10:55,889
Ahn Yeo Jin.

153
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:59,460
If Si On finds out about you,

154
00:11:00,529 --> 00:11:02,830
would he be able to understand
this situation?

155
00:11:03,669 --> 00:11:05,840
He doesn't need to know who I am.

156
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,440
That's the only thing I want.

157
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:12,080
I will save your life first.

158
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:13,779
My life...

159
00:11:14,779 --> 00:11:16,279
has ended...

160
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:18,250
the day I met Jo Young Hoon.

161
00:11:30,029 --> 00:11:31,029
This is the one.

162
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,779
Team Manager Kang, we've arrived.

163
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:46,539
No, we couldn't contact him.

164
00:11:47,179 --> 00:11:48,409
- Go Young Jin and his wife...
- Hello?

165
00:11:48,409 --> 00:11:49,610
won't answer their phones.

166
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,179
Is anyone home?

167
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:00,929
Time is up.

168
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:04,759
We need to go in.

169
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:06,460
Wait.

170
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,200
Kim Hyun Jun, break the doors
if you have to.

171
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:16,240
I will take full responsibility.

172
00:12:16,539 --> 00:12:18,179
Team Manager Kang Ki Hyung!

173
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:23,679
Sir,

174
00:12:24,179 --> 00:12:25,480
it won't take long.

175
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:28,120
We can prove it.

176
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,259
Wait here, and don't come outside.

177
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:38,129
We're from NCI.

178
00:12:38,929 --> 00:12:40,559
Are you Go Young Jin?

179
00:12:41,299 --> 00:12:42,299
Yes.

180
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,539
You didn't answer the phone,
so we had to come here.

181
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:48,470
We'd like to ask you a few things
about your son.

182
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:50,509
What about him?

183
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,480
Do you...

184
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:56,980
happen to know a child named Si On?

185
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:01,289
Who is that?

186
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:05,590
Did something happen to a child
named Si On?

187
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:11,299
Team Manager Kang,
I think we found him.

188
00:13:13,429 --> 00:13:14,730
We found your son.

189
00:13:20,769 --> 00:13:22,110
This is my decision.

190
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:24,539
Please...

191
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:28,210
don't make him the last victim
of Jo Young Hoon.

192
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:32,049
Team Manager Kang.

193
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:34,690
Please...

194
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,289
let me go.

195
00:13:45,029 --> 00:13:46,100
Ha Sun Woo.

196
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,700
That wasn't the boy
we were looking for.

197
00:13:55,009 --> 00:13:56,870
I must have made a mistake.

198
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:05,950
I'm so sorry.

199
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:07,850
We must have come
to the wrong address.

200
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:09,919
I'm sorry to have caused you
inconvenience.

201
00:14:10,289 --> 00:14:11,360
I'm sorry.

202
00:14:17,129 --> 00:14:18,129
Detective.

203
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:26,139
Thank you.

204
00:14:58,139 --> 00:15:00,539
I want your face to be
the last thing I see...

205
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:03,470
before I go.

206
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:05,710
Would that be all right?

207
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:39,799
"The best and most beautiful things
in the world..."

208
00:16:40,169 --> 00:16:43,210

You're mine, starting today.

213
00:17:11,369 --> 00:17:13,740
Who do you think you are
to say that?

214
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:17,339
It's up to me.

215
00:17:17,609 --> 00:17:18,740
Day one starts today.

216

Park Ji Ye, please
come up to the stage.

221
00:17:57,309 --> 00:18:01,349
The above student received
an outstanding grade...

222
00:18:01,349 --> 00:18:04,619
and became a good example to other
students with good conduct.

223
00:18:04,619 --> 00:18:06,420
So this certificate is given.

224
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:10,430
Congratulations once again
to Park Ji Ye.

225

good volunteer experiences.

Kim Min Jung, please come up
to the stage.

229
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,210
Is that Sang Ho?

230
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,049
He used to be so smart.

231
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:31,220
He's ruined now.

232
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:34,890
How did you make it here?
You're so busy.

233
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:37,720
You know lawyers aren't doing well
nowadays.

234
00:18:38,619 --> 00:18:41,359
I can't even afford the rent,
so I have to move out.

235
00:18:55,009 --> 00:18:56,009
Hurry up.

Wait.

240
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,630
What's going on?

241
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,769
Kim Hyun Jun, you're under arrest
for murdering Kang Ho Young.

242
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:25,240
Hold on.

243
00:19:26,369 --> 00:19:27,740
What are you talking about?

244
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:29,839
Let's not make a scene here
and leave.

245
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:30,940
Take him.

246
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:33,880

- Be quiet.

00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,910

I'll be lonely for a while.

00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,500
Someone will fill in soon.

257
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:26,859
Consider this...

258
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:31,029
as what's best for you and the team.

259
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:35,539
I know you've thought this through
enough to make this decision.

260
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:40,279
It also took me a while
to make this decision.

261
00:20:40,609 --> 00:20:41,809
Don't mind it.

262
00:20:42,309 --> 00:20:43,309
Sure.

263
00:20:44,579 --> 00:20:46,549
So you're going to take a rest
for a while?

264
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:48,119
Yes.

265
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:50,950
I'm planning to spend time with
Han Byul...

266
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,789
and pay a visit to my mother.

267
00:20:55,029 --> 00:20:56,029
Let's go out.

268
00:20:56,529 --> 00:20:58,460
Spend some time with us.

269
00:20:59,529 --> 00:21:01,970
It's been a while since we had
dinner with the whole team.

270
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:04,230
Let's go out for dinner together.

271
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:07,640
But why did the chief director
tell us to stay?

272
00:21:08,269 --> 00:21:09,309
I'm not sure.

273
00:21:09,809 --> 00:21:12,710
Is he going to give us
a compensation to appreciate...

274
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:14,339
what we've done?

275
00:21:14,509 --> 00:21:16,109
Or a surprise dinner?

276
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:19,880
Hyun Jun should be here
to enjoy this.

277
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:22,450
Why did he have to go
to his hometown now?

278
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:25,990
I wonder if he's arrived.

279
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:27,490
By the way,

280
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:30,730
I've never been to Cheonju.
What's it like?

281
00:21:30,759 --> 00:21:31,829
Cheonju?

282
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:34,029
It's a romantic city.

283
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:36,769
How about we all head to Cheonju...

284
00:21:36,769 --> 00:21:38,799
since we're on the topic?

285
00:21:41,539 --> 00:21:42,640
Where's Min Young?

286
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:44,339
She went to the press room.

287
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:45,980
Is everything all right?

288
00:21:46,279 --> 00:21:49,480
I want to treat you to dinner.

289
00:21:49,609 --> 00:21:51,549
And Team Manager Kang
has something to tell you.

290
00:21:53,579 --> 00:21:56,519
Sorry to interrupt.
You must see this.

291
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,819
We have some breaking news.

292
00:21:58,819 --> 00:22:02,259
As the identity of the murdered
man who was found...

293
00:22:02,259 --> 00:22:06,259
near Cheonju Dam in Cheonju-si,
Gyungnam, is discovered,

294
00:22:06,259 --> 00:22:09,329
the main suspect has been arrested.

295
00:22:09,329 --> 00:22:12,440
We'll talk to reporter Han Yeo Ul
in Cheonju Police Station.

296
00:22:12,569 --> 00:22:15,839
Hyun Jun got arrested
as a murder suspect.

297
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:17,839
Through the analysis...

298
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:19,640
- How did this happen?
- of the surveillance camera,

299
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:23,049
they've found crucial evidence
that Mr. Kim is the culprit.

300
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:24,950
Suspect Mr. Kim...

301
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:28,789
kept in touch with victim Kang
for many years until recently...

302
00:22:28,849 --> 00:22:31,759
and are both known to be
from the same youth center.

303
00:22:36,029 --> 00:22:37,460
Kang Ho Young, 32 years old.

304
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:40,000
The cause of death is skull
fracture by a blunt weapon.

305
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:43,529
He was found dead in the forest
near Cheonju Dam three days ago.

306
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:47,539
When the body was found,
it was decayed too much to identify.

307
00:22:47,539 --> 00:22:50,940
And mortem examination assumes
he died about 20 days ago.

308
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:52,609
According to the police
investigation,

309
00:22:52,609 --> 00:22:56,180
Hyun Jun's fingerprints and Kang's
fingerprints and blood were...

310
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:57,710
both found...

311
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:00,750
in Cheonju Youth Center gym,
the suspected murder site.

312
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:03,390
They also secured
a surveillance camera record...

313
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:06,089
of Hyun Jun walking out
from the site.

314
00:23:06,089 --> 00:23:10,190
Hyun Jun is also the last person
he called on the day of the murder.

315
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:11,930
And it's confirmed...

316
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:14,970
that Hyun Jun was at the site
at the estimated time of murder.

317
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:18,740
(Kang Ho Young)

318
00:23:19,099 --> 00:23:20,140
Let me answer this.

319
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,970
What's the criminal intent?

320
00:23:23,609 --> 00:23:25,440
Hyun Jun has no reason to do so.

321
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,509
I know. Why would Hyun Jun do that?

322
00:23:27,609 --> 00:23:29,710
And they are childhood friends.

323
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:32,950
Ha Sun Woo.

324
00:23:33,349 --> 00:23:34,349
Yes.

325
00:23:34,349 --> 00:23:36,349
Tell me what's on your mind.

326
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:40,859
Hyun Jun...

327
00:23:41,559 --> 00:23:44,130
has been tracing the Nadeul River
murder case.

328
00:23:46,099 --> 00:23:48,829
Kang Ho Young was one of the
Nadeul River murder case suspects...

329
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:53,500
14 years ago along with
Go Young Min, who recently died.

330
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,970
Hyun Jun was also a suspect.

331
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:57,269
Then...

332
00:23:58,009 --> 00:24:00,410
is what he said before true?

333
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,609
I was one of the suspects.

334
00:24:03,779 --> 00:24:06,819
This case of Kang Ho Young and
Nadeul River murder case...

335
00:24:08,019 --> 00:24:09,849
must be related.

336
00:24:10,589 --> 00:24:11,690
So you're saying...

337
00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:14,759
Kang Ho Young called you first
to meet up,

338
00:24:15,589 --> 00:24:16,859
but he didn't show up?

339
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:30,069
Then how would you explain this?

340
00:24:30,539 --> 00:24:31,740
(Call History)

341
00:24:33,079 --> 00:24:35,210
Do you think I killed Ho Young...

342
00:24:35,349 --> 00:24:37,480
to close
the Nadeul River murder case?

343
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:39,750
Hey.

344
00:24:41,349 --> 00:24:43,549
What I think isn't important now.

345
00:24:44,089 --> 00:24:45,160
This...

346
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,819
is what's important right now.

347
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:50,589
Even from the past,

348
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:54,099
you always thought I was
the murderer of that case.

349
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,500
So what?

350
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,269
The Nadeul River murder case...

351
00:24:57,670 --> 00:25:00,039
was your first murder case...

352
00:25:00,039 --> 00:25:02,369
after you were assigned to
the Violent Crimes Unit.

353
00:25:02,869 --> 00:25:05,980
You've been looking for
the evidence of the past crime...

354
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:09,180
due to the guilt regarding
the unresolved victim's sorrow.

355
00:25:11,049 --> 00:25:12,480
And your obsession...

356
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:15,250
only grew bigger.

357
00:25:15,319 --> 00:25:16,589
Be quiet.

358
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,759
If I'm the criminal,

359
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:21,759
do you think I'd be so foolish
to leave my fingerprints...

360
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:24,930
and get myself caught
by the surveillance camera?

361
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:31,200
Think about it.

362
00:25:32,269 --> 00:25:34,369
Due to your obsession...

363
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,609
You could be making things up.

364
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:37,740
Hey.

365
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:39,880
Don't try to fool around with me.

366
00:25:40,009 --> 00:25:42,309
Do you really want to solve
the Nadeul River Case?

367
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:44,549
Shut your mouth!

368
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:47,549
Find the real culprit
who killed Ho Young.

369
00:25:48,849 --> 00:25:51,119
That's what you need to do.

370
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:52,720
Hey.

371
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:54,930
Don't fool around with me.

372
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,559
You got out in the past,

373
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:59,700
but you can't get out this time.

374
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,160
You scumbag.

375
00:26:01,769 --> 00:26:03,970
What are you doing
without reporting to me?

376
00:26:05,299 --> 00:26:06,799
And what have you been doing?

377
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:10,410
I told you to report to me
when something happens!

378
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:13,640
It happened when you were away
on a business trip.

379
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:15,079
I'm sorry.

380
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:17,309
Both of you, get out.

381
00:26:18,619 --> 00:26:19,950
Get out, scumbag!

382
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Hyun Jun.

383
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:37,829
What's this about?

384
00:26:41,369 --> 00:26:42,410
Sun Woo.

385
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:44,839
Thanks.

386
00:26:48,009 --> 00:26:49,079
When I was young,

387
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:54,319
I used to visit Cheonju
every vacation.

388
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:56,589
My grandmother lived there.

389
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:04,430
Were you investigating...

390
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:07,759
the Nadeul River incident as well?

391
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,430
It was me.

392
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:12,299
I found the dead body first.

393
00:27:13,339 --> 00:27:14,369
What?

394
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:35,589
- You stole this card, didn't you?
- I didn't.

395
00:27:36,059 --> 00:27:37,890
Is this what your mom taught you
to do?

396
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:39,400
Go, and get your mother.

397
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:42,430
It's not like that.
I was asked to run an errand...

398
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,599
for my brother's friends there.

399
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:48,539
You probably stole it.
I will call the police.

400
00:27:48,869 --> 00:27:50,569
- I...
- She didn't do it.

401
00:27:50,569 --> 00:27:51,740
I saw everything.

402
00:27:52,039 --> 00:27:53,309
What she said is true.

403
00:28:20,839 --> 00:28:23,170
You can take my umbrella.
You're all wet.

404
00:28:24,769 --> 00:28:27,579
It's all right.
Someone's coming to fetch me.

405
00:28:27,809 --> 00:28:31,250
You should use this.
I don't like to be in debt.

406
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:48,559
What happened to the missing girl?
Could something bad have happened?

407
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:51,789
She's only in middle school.
Don't say that.

408
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:55,000
Anything can happen in the
dangerous world we live in today.

409
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:56,569
The mere thought of it scares me.

410
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:32,599
Kang Ho Young told you that
he had something to show you?

411
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:34,170
Yes.

412
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:37,210
Ho Young could have had...

413
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:40,279
some evidence of the incident
that happened in the past.

414
00:30:51,019 --> 00:30:53,019
Aren't you trying to fit things
into the situation...

415
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,630
due to your obsession
with the incident?

416
00:30:57,529 --> 00:30:58,559
We need to move away.

417
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,460
Yes?

418
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,569
You can't tell anyone.

419
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:10,670
Do you understand me?

420
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:12,180
Yes.

421
00:31:23,349 --> 00:31:25,859
It's all right. Study hard.

422
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:26,890
All right?

423
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:28,589
Okay. Goodbye.

424
00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:35,400
Are you just letting him go?

425
00:31:35,569 --> 00:31:37,569
We have suspects everywhere.

426
00:31:37,569 --> 00:31:39,369
We don't have time
to waste on children.

427
00:31:39,369 --> 00:31:42,670
His alibi on the day of the incident
is unclear.

428
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:45,410
Didn't you see him change his words
when we cornered him?

429
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,009
Gosh.

430
00:31:47,509 --> 00:31:50,380
He's just 11 years old.
He barely started studying.

431
00:31:50,549 --> 00:31:53,220
Don't waste your time on him
and find other suspects.

432
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:08,900
Hello.

433
00:32:09,099 --> 00:32:10,869
I'm Oh Jeong Taek.
We spoke on the phone earlier.

434
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:12,200
I'm Kang Ki Hyung.

435
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:14,500
Where is Hyun Jun?

436
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:15,809
He's in the interrogation room.

437
00:32:16,269 --> 00:32:18,740
I expect you to have taken into
account the consequences...

438
00:32:18,809 --> 00:32:21,440
for having arrested our agent
without informing us beforehand.

439
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:26,220
If this was an investigation held
without circumstantial evidence,

440
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:29,089
I am not going to let this slide.

441
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:31,490
And you also need to take
responsibility for the fact...

442
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:32,960
that you informed the media
about the arrest first.

443
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:36,630
We had found definite evidence.

444
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:39,730
He was investigating
the Nadeul River Case.

445
00:32:39,859 --> 00:32:41,599
It's our belief...

446
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:44,200
that someone involved in the case
is trying to frame him.

447
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:46,240
Do you agree on the fact...

448
00:32:46,299 --> 00:32:49,069
that the culprit of the Nadeul River
case killed Kang Ho Young?

449
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:51,970
What if a profile,

450
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,109
that NCI has so much trust in,
indicates one suspect,

451
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,980
and you are the one who proved it?

452
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:02,650
Don't you remember the profile?

453
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:07,059
It's nice to meet you.
To figure out serial killers,

454
00:33:07,059 --> 00:33:09,390
you need to consider their age,

455
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:12,099
background information, and...

456
00:33:12,759 --> 00:33:14,130
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

457
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:15,829
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

458
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:17,000
Thank you.

459
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:18,769
Thank you.

460
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,799
Excuse me, but this...

461
00:33:22,369 --> 00:33:24,109
is the case I'm investigating on.

462
00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:27,440
The biggest problem here is his age.

463
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:30,980
I...

464
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:35,650
had suspected Kim Hyun Jun as
the culprit and watched him...

465
00:33:36,019 --> 00:33:38,890
because of what Team Manager Kang
had profiled for me.

466
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:41,460
Considering the place where
the bodies were abandoned,

467
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:44,059
the culprit must be familiar
with the region.

468
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:47,759
According to forensics,
the Nadeul River murder...

469
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:51,930
and the murder of Kang Ho Young
were both caused by strangling.

470
00:33:52,099 --> 00:33:55,240
The culprit must be smart enough
to hide the crime...

471
00:33:55,369 --> 00:33:58,009
and be familiar with
the police investigation process.

472
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,440
He might have committed
crimes before,

473
00:33:59,539 --> 00:34:02,450
or he could work in
the law enforcement sector.

474
00:34:02,509 --> 00:34:05,380
Culprits of cases that have been
unsolved for a long time...

475
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:07,619
tend to be both
anxious and confident.

476
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:10,750
So it's likely for them to visit
the crime scene or the victims.

477
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:13,320
Some show interest
in the investigation...

478
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:15,190
and even participate.

479
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,889
Do you know...

480
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:19,260
who visits the victim's grave
every time he visits Cheonju?

481
00:34:21,929 --> 00:34:23,000
And...

482
00:34:23,429 --> 00:34:25,769
do you know who contacted
our police station frequently,

483
00:34:25,769 --> 00:34:28,300
showing interest in
the Nadeul River Case?

484
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:31,510
He knew both Mo Ji Eun,
the victim who died 14 years ago,

485
00:34:32,039 --> 00:34:33,840
and Kang Ho Young,

486
00:34:34,409 --> 00:34:36,110
the recent victim.

487
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:38,880
And he was the last person that
they contacted before they died.

488
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,820
According to my profile,
everything...

489
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:48,760
leads to one person.

490
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:51,489
Kim Hyun Jun.

491
00:34:52,059 --> 00:34:54,429
Do you think this is a coincidence?

492
00:34:54,829 --> 00:34:57,429
Detective, you have made
a critical mistake...

493
00:34:57,530 --> 00:34:59,039
in your profile.

494
00:34:59,269 --> 00:35:00,769
You said that the victim had either
committed a crime before...

495
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,809
or worked in
the law enforcement sector.

496
00:35:03,369 --> 00:35:06,539
But Hyun Jun had nothing to do with
that when the incident had happened.

497
00:35:06,539 --> 00:35:09,050
Yes, he has no criminal records.

498
00:35:11,409 --> 00:35:13,119
But before the incident,

499
00:35:13,349 --> 00:35:14,579
Kim Hyun Jun...

500
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:17,849
came to the police station often
for fighting incidents.

501
00:35:17,889 --> 00:35:21,389
So he knew very well
about the legal procedures.

502
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:22,559
How about his age?

503
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:25,860
He was only 17 then.

504
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:27,130
His age?

505
00:35:28,329 --> 00:35:29,900
You told me...

506
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:33,539
the culprit's age is
the most difficult to estimate.

507
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,769
"Just because
the age doesn't match,"

508
00:35:36,769 --> 00:35:39,380
"we shouldn't ignore a suspect
so easily."

509
00:35:39,909 --> 00:35:40,980
Do you remember saying that?

510
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:42,980
Just as Sun Woo said,

511
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:45,110
I'm sure he fell into a trap.

512
00:35:45,449 --> 00:35:46,449
Maybe...

513
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:49,519
the suspect already knew
that Detective Tae...

514
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:51,349
was already suspicious of Hyun Jun.

515
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:53,659
Kang Ho Young probably tried
to tell Hyun Jun...

516
00:35:53,659 --> 00:35:55,760
what had happened in the past.

517
00:35:55,829 --> 00:35:59,030
Someone must have kept watch
on Kang Ho Young...

518
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:01,059
and probably set up a plan
after realizing...

519
00:36:01,059 --> 00:36:02,670
that he's meeting Hyun Jun.

520
00:36:02,769 --> 00:36:05,840
And the time they found the body
is also suspicious.

521
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,969
It's as if they knew Hyun Jun was
going to attend the center's event.

522
00:36:09,969 --> 00:36:12,280
The body was found at such
a coincidental time.

523
00:36:12,610 --> 00:36:15,579
But why did Kang Ho Young choose
Hyun Jun...

524
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:17,550
over all the police officers nearby?

525
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,780
(Nana Hwang)

526
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:25,820
What happened with Hyun Jun?

527
00:36:25,889 --> 00:36:28,159
How's the situation? Is he okay?

528
00:36:28,389 --> 00:36:30,090
An arrest warrant was
issued for him,

529
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:31,690
so we only have two days.

530
00:36:34,099 --> 00:36:35,570
As you requested,

531
00:36:35,699 --> 00:36:38,369
I did a background check on all
of Kang Ho Young's acquaintances.

532
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:39,670
But I didn't find anyone...

533
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:42,440
who did something suspicious
on the day of the incident.

534
00:36:42,539 --> 00:36:44,070
I'll see if there has been any...

535
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:47,510
similar cases to the Nadeul River
case and get back to you.

536
00:36:47,579 --> 00:36:48,739
I'll go see Hyun Jun.

537
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:52,650
You two go to where the body
was found, and look for any traces.

538
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:55,250
There must be a reason why
the body was abandoned there.

539
00:36:55,349 --> 00:36:56,449
Yes, sir.

540
00:36:58,250 --> 00:36:59,789
Things aren't looking good.

541
00:37:00,889 --> 00:37:02,889
Did anyone know that
you were going...

542
00:37:03,389 --> 00:37:04,829
to meet Kang Ho Young?

543
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:08,159
As far as I know,

544
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:10,170
no.

545
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:11,969
Why did Kang Ho Young...

546
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:14,699
ask to meet you there?

547
00:37:15,869 --> 00:37:18,210
Do you have any idea what he
wanted to show you?

548
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:21,579
I don't know.

549
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:23,579
Is there anything...

550
00:37:23,849 --> 00:37:26,780
I should know about
the Nadeul River Case...

551
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:30,789
that's not in the case file?

552
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,119
Let me rephrase.

553
00:37:35,489 --> 00:37:36,590
What else...

554
00:37:37,289 --> 00:37:39,599
do you know about this case?

555
00:37:43,969 --> 00:37:44,969
Tell me.

556
00:37:46,739 --> 00:37:47,840
Are you...

557
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:51,510
profiling me right now?

558
00:37:51,739 --> 00:37:53,480
You have to help me...

559
00:37:54,139 --> 00:37:55,710
for me to help you.

560
00:37:57,809 --> 00:37:59,250
We trust you.

561
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:03,719
Everyone in the team and I will
do our best to help you.

562
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:09,989
If you remember anything, even
if it's something small,

563
00:38:10,090 --> 00:38:11,829
you should tell me first.

564
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,769
If there is anything I need to know,
tell me.

565
00:38:25,269 --> 00:38:28,340
It's not me he was after.

566
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:32,719
I think he's after not only
the team manager,

567
00:38:32,719 --> 00:38:35,119
but our entire team.

568
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:40,219
Give me a detailed report
on the youth center...

569
00:38:40,219 --> 00:38:42,760
and on Kim Hyun Jun too.

570
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:43,860
Sorry?

571
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:48,030
What do you specifically want
to know about Hyun Jun?

572
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:49,530
From his past to the present,

573
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:52,000
his acquaintances and
what he did in the past,

574
00:38:52,329 --> 00:38:54,869
look into everything related to
Kim Hyun Jun.

575
00:38:55,539 --> 00:38:59,510
Okay. I'll call you as soon
as I find something.

576
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:04,949
I think he's hiding something.

577
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,650
If he's really acting according to
someone else's plan,

578
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:11,320
it must be someone who knows
very well about us...

579
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:14,559
or what Hyun Jun does throughout
the day.

580
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:17,030
Do you think this is related
to the Reaper?

581
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,760
First of all,

582
00:39:21,199 --> 00:39:24,070
it's important to clear Hyun Jun
of murder charges.

583
00:39:24,869 --> 00:39:27,400
We have to think about all the
possibilities when approaching this.

584
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,340
Someone publicized the forgotten
Nadeul River Case.

585
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:34,480
It's possible that an outsider
planned all this...

586
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,710
to uncover the truth from the past.

587
00:39:38,949 --> 00:39:42,650
Then do you have someone
in mind?

588
00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:43,719
Not yet.

589
00:39:44,019 --> 00:39:45,760
But I'm sure that whoever it is,

590
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:49,389
we have to find out what
Kim Hyun Jun knows...

591
00:39:49,389 --> 00:39:50,860
about the Nadeul River Case.

592
00:39:51,329 --> 00:39:53,900
Only then will we know for sure
who's behind this...

593
00:39:53,929 --> 00:39:57,900
and why he wants to frame
Hyun Jun for the murder.

594
00:40:14,849 --> 00:40:18,420
The body is severely decomposed to
the point of being unrecognizable.

595
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:20,690
Do you think the body was abandoned
right after the murder?

596
00:40:39,679 --> 00:40:40,679
No.

597
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:44,380
The body was probably abandoned
after the 26th.

598
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:48,079
Then the killer kept the body
for more than two weeks?

599
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:50,920
Yes. He probably wanted to avoid
the discharge period.

600
00:40:50,989 --> 00:40:52,619
During the summer,

601
00:40:52,619 --> 00:40:55,420
Cheonju Dam discharges water on
set dates to control water levels.

602
00:40:55,719 --> 00:40:57,559
They announce their discharge
plans in advance.

603
00:40:57,829 --> 00:41:00,530
Recently, they've been discharging
water every 15 days.

604
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:03,800
The killer abandoned the body
in a ditch...

605
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:07,639
so that it wouldn't be washed
away after the discharge.

606
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:11,670
At first, it seems as if he left the
body in an inconspicuous place,

607
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:14,340
but in reality, he planned
everything so that the body...

608
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:16,110
would be found within a certain
period.

609
00:41:16,809 --> 00:41:18,650
You're right. He probably knew
exactly when...

610
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:22,219
the manager checks water levels
after the discharge.

611
00:41:32,659 --> 00:41:35,059
Every year, a flock of migratory
birds come to Nadeul River...

612
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:37,500
and create a beautiful scene
at this time of the year.

613
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:39,340
This is the perfect place
to see it.

614
00:41:40,199 --> 00:41:43,639
But what does that have to do with
this case?

615
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:45,440
You always see articles
on the newspaper.

616
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:47,039
This is where the festival happens,

617
00:41:47,409 --> 00:41:49,110
and you can photograph
the birds too.

618
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:54,250
I'm sure that someone took
a photo here.

619
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:57,989
I looked into the center.

620
00:41:58,219 --> 00:42:00,889
But there were no
management problems until now.

621
00:42:01,159 --> 00:42:04,429
It received several appreciation
plaques from the government too.

622
00:42:05,289 --> 00:42:09,300
I'm gathering a list of employees
who worked there 14 years ago.

623
00:42:10,869 --> 00:42:12,429
But it was so long ago,

624
00:42:12,429 --> 00:42:14,269
and they once lost
all their records in a fire.

625
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:15,739
So it's not easy.

626
00:42:15,739 --> 00:42:16,769
Fire?

627
00:42:16,969 --> 00:42:20,409
Yes. There's a record of a fire
that occurred in 2004.

628
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,909
Look into that.

629
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:25,409
What caused the fire, and
who were involved?

630
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:26,519
Okay.

631
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:52,110
(Appreciation plaque)

632
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:41,289
No one passes through this place
because of the construction.

633
00:43:42,889 --> 00:43:46,360
Why did they agree to meet here?

634
00:44:06,719 --> 00:44:09,280
(Cheonju Youth Center)

635
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:26,500
The center is familiar
to the two of them.

636
00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:29,969
If the place wasn't used
for a while,

637
00:44:30,469 --> 00:44:32,369
they probably considered it safe.

638
00:45:22,590 --> 00:45:24,389
This place is optimal...

639
00:45:24,659 --> 00:45:26,099
to hide something.

640
00:45:27,699 --> 00:45:29,429
The thing Kang Ho Young hid.

641
00:45:30,369 --> 00:45:33,599
The thing he wanted to show Kim
Hyun Jun after 14 years.

642
00:45:35,070 --> 00:45:36,510
What could it be?

643
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:10,840
The killer used the shortest path...

644
00:46:11,610 --> 00:46:13,179
that's completely hidden
from others...

645
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:14,909
to move the body.

(48GU2354)

(Garden Pond)

648
00:46:30,659 --> 00:46:32,090
Why did you come here?

649
00:46:32,190 --> 00:46:34,630
I told you not to contact me
or come here for the time being!

650
00:46:38,199 --> 00:46:39,230
Did you...

651
00:46:39,769 --> 00:46:42,099
really kill Kang Ho Young?

652
00:47:15,239 --> 00:47:17,309
The parents helped us
tremendously...

653
00:47:18,070 --> 00:47:21,309
to help this center find
a home here.

654
00:47:21,579 --> 00:47:24,710
But I had no idea I'd have
to meet them again...

655
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:26,750
for something like this.

656
00:47:26,750 --> 00:47:29,619
We have a couple questions
concerning the past incident.

657
00:47:30,090 --> 00:47:33,389
What does that incident have
to do with this?

658
00:47:33,590 --> 00:47:34,989
That's in the past.

659
00:47:38,059 --> 00:47:42,159
Stop bringing up past sorrows.

660
00:47:42,329 --> 00:47:46,269
We've suffered enough
because of that incident.

661
00:47:46,670 --> 00:47:51,070
Were there any problems
in the center at the time?

662
00:47:52,510 --> 00:47:54,610
It's already been concluded...

663
00:47:54,909 --> 00:47:57,710
that no one in this center...

664
00:47:57,710 --> 00:48:00,150
had anything to do with that case.

665
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:04,050
Why do you always come to the center
when something like this happens,

666
00:48:04,050 --> 00:48:06,119
and create a huge fuss?

667
00:48:07,489 --> 00:48:11,730
Was Kang Ho Young really
murdered in this center?

668
00:48:12,030 --> 00:48:15,059
That's something we've confirmed.

669
00:48:16,599 --> 00:48:19,699
I don't believe that.

670
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:21,539
My goodness.

671
00:48:22,269 --> 00:48:25,610
I don't have anything more to say,
so please be on your way.

672
00:48:37,219 --> 00:48:39,619
The head of the center
is hiding something.

673
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:43,530
Yes, he's overly defensive
about the past incident.

674
00:48:43,789 --> 00:48:47,530
Does that mean he's somehow
involved in it?

675
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,530
I'm afraid something...

676
00:48:49,530 --> 00:48:52,230
happened in the center before
Mo Ji Eun died.

677
00:48:52,670 --> 00:48:55,400
I looked into the fire
I mentioned earlier.

678
00:48:55,739 --> 00:48:57,309
- Go ahead.
- In February 2004,

679
00:48:57,309 --> 00:49:00,309
6 months after the Nadeul
River incident,

680
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,980
there was a fire at the center
which was suspected to be arson.

681
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:06,420
I found someone suspicious
in the list of suspects...

682
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:08,250
identified back then.

683
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:11,219
He's Choi Sang Woo,
currently 32-years-old.

684
00:49:11,820 --> 00:49:15,159
He was 18 in 2004 at the
time of the fire.

685
00:49:15,889 --> 00:49:18,329
Choi Sang Woo went to the
center back then.

686
00:49:18,829 --> 00:49:20,900
But around the time the
fire occurred,

687
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,570
his sister Choi Hee Jin
committed suicide.

688
00:49:23,869 --> 00:49:26,900
Because of that Choi Sang Woo
became a prime suspect for the fire.

689
00:49:27,369 --> 00:49:30,469
There's a witness statement saying
that when the police took him in,

690
00:49:30,510 --> 00:49:34,480
he threatened to kill everyone
at the center and caused a scene.

691
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:35,710
(Statement)

692
00:49:35,710 --> 00:49:38,309
Arsonists are likely to have an
impulse control disorder...

693
00:49:38,309 --> 00:49:40,949
where they feel pleasure
in causing fires.

694
00:49:41,949 --> 00:49:44,219
There's a high chance
for a serial arsonist...

695
00:49:44,219 --> 00:49:46,090
to turn into a serial killer,

696
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:50,190
but he's far from the profile we
have for Kang Ho Young's murder.

697
00:49:50,889 --> 00:49:54,000
Serial arsonists do not have this
long incubation periods.

698
00:49:54,329 --> 00:49:56,030
If he continued to live in the
same area,

699
00:49:56,030 --> 00:49:58,500
he must have had caused more fires.

700
00:49:58,630 --> 00:50:00,840
In this case, it's more likely that
the arson's caused by rage...

701
00:50:01,099 --> 00:50:04,010
and hatred rather than pleasure.

702
00:50:04,409 --> 00:50:07,710
Choi Sang Woo's been involved in
several minor battery cases.

703
00:50:08,639 --> 00:50:10,780
He was in and out of juvenile
correction centers...

704
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:12,309
for security issues too.

705
00:50:12,909 --> 00:50:15,280
He must have known better
than anyone else...

706
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:17,119
about the center's CCTV system.

707
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:20,219
If he held a grudge against the
center and caused the fire,

708
00:50:20,719 --> 00:50:23,289
he might be related to the
Nadeul River Case.

709
00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:27,000
If he tried to publicize an
unresolved case from the past,

710
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:30,869
he must already have enough
of a motive for murder.

711
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,739
Can we see a photo of his sister
who committed suicide?

712
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:37,840
Of course. Just a moment.

713
00:50:39,469 --> 00:50:40,539
I sent it over.

714
00:50:46,519 --> 00:50:48,179
Choi Sang Woo's sister,
Choi Hee Jin,

715
00:50:48,750 --> 00:50:50,789
went to the same center
as Mo Ji Eun.

716
00:50:59,659 --> 00:51:01,800
I heard a boy and girl were alone.

717
00:51:02,159 --> 00:51:03,670
Really?

718
00:51:04,730 --> 00:51:06,030
That's ridiculous.

719
00:51:10,869 --> 00:51:12,510
What if the girls...

720
00:51:12,869 --> 00:51:15,239
were sexually molested
in the center?

721
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:18,909
Maybe that was why Choi
Hee Jin committed suicide?

722
00:51:19,110 --> 00:51:21,650
What if Mo Ji Eun knew something,

723
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:24,190
and she was murdered to make
sure the secret never got out?

724
00:51:24,789 --> 00:51:26,789
Someone suggested that in the past,

725
00:51:26,889 --> 00:51:29,960
so all the girls at the center
were questioned.

726
00:51:30,289 --> 00:51:32,030
But they didn't find anything
suspicious.

727
00:51:32,030 --> 00:51:34,860
Go Young Min was pointed as a
suspect precisely because...

728
00:51:35,059 --> 00:51:36,570
he had a history of sexual offense.

729
00:51:36,769 --> 00:51:39,170
Considering how the youth
centers are so enclosed,

730
00:51:39,170 --> 00:51:42,400
we can't rule out the possibility
that the investigation was hushed.

731
00:51:43,739 --> 00:51:46,980
What if Choi Hee Jin committed
suicide because...

732
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:50,780
she was sexually molested or abused
at the center...

733
00:51:52,510 --> 00:51:55,480
there may be more than one victim.

734
00:51:56,489 --> 00:51:59,320
Mo Ji Eun could have been
one of the victims too.

735
00:52:01,059 --> 00:52:02,789
I have to stop by somewhere.

736
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:05,960
I'll call you when I get back.

737
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:12,000
Look more into what caused Choi
Hee Jin to commit suicide.

738
00:52:12,429 --> 00:52:15,869
I want you look into the list of
suspects from the past case.

739
00:52:16,369 --> 00:52:18,510
- Min Young, you'll come with me.
- Sure.

740
00:52:28,449 --> 00:52:29,719
- Hey.
- What?

741
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:31,349
- Did you hear that?
- What?

742
00:52:31,349 --> 00:52:33,789
They were together at the
training center.

743
00:52:33,789 --> 00:52:35,389
- The training center?
- Yes.

744
00:52:36,019 --> 00:52:37,360
What?

745
00:52:37,590 --> 00:52:38,829
That's ridiculous.
I'm getting goosebumps.

746
00:52:38,829 --> 00:52:40,000
I know, right?

747
00:52:41,659 --> 00:52:42,730
Hi.

748
00:52:46,130 --> 00:52:47,869
What if Choi Hee Jin committed
suicide because...

749
00:52:48,039 --> 00:52:50,170
she was sexually molested or abused
at the center...

750
00:52:50,639 --> 00:52:52,340
there may be more than one victim.

751
00:52:53,070 --> 00:52:56,079
Mo Ji Eun could have been
one of the victims too.

752
00:52:56,780 --> 00:52:59,579
He was a model student at school.

753
00:52:59,579 --> 00:53:01,280
He got good grades as well.

754
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:04,519
He won many awards
since he was young...

755
00:53:04,750 --> 00:53:07,420
in creativity competitions
or math competitions.

756
00:53:14,230 --> 00:53:15,500
Are you Choi Sang Woo?

757
00:53:15,699 --> 00:53:17,329
We're from NCI.

758
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:21,869
We have a few questions to ask
related to...

759
00:53:21,869 --> 00:53:23,670
the youth center arson in 2004.

760
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:26,679
I have nothing to say.

761
00:53:27,110 --> 00:53:30,150
The case closed a long time ago.

762
00:53:30,510 --> 00:53:32,650
Did you set the center...

763
00:53:33,619 --> 00:53:35,150
on fire?

764
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:37,349
I told you it's not me.

765
00:53:37,619 --> 00:53:39,590
As you know,

766
00:53:40,489 --> 00:53:42,659
we're not trying to keep you
accountable for it.

767
00:53:43,489 --> 00:53:47,460
We're investigating past
incidents at the center...

768
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:50,269
relating to the Nadeul river
murder case.

769
00:53:50,329 --> 00:53:51,769
I ask for your cooperation.

770
00:53:51,969 --> 00:53:53,340
Nothing happened.

771
00:53:53,699 --> 00:53:54,699
Then...

772
00:53:55,369 --> 00:53:58,210
can I ask why your sister committed
suicide?

773
00:54:00,739 --> 00:54:01,909
Please tell us.

774
00:54:02,809 --> 00:54:06,280
Does your sister's suicide have
something to do with the center?

775
00:54:07,179 --> 00:54:08,679
I said no.

776
00:54:10,519 --> 00:54:12,989
I have nothing more to say. Leave.

777
00:54:14,059 --> 00:54:15,789
Let me ask you one more question.

778
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:20,760
Did your sister go through
a bad experience at the center?

779
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:27,300
You have no idea.

780
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:30,239
Leave. I have nothing to say.

781
00:54:30,239 --> 00:54:32,670
What are you trying to hide now?

782
00:54:32,969 --> 00:54:34,380
I said leave!

783
00:54:34,809 --> 00:54:37,909
Do you think many people died
due to that incident?

784
00:54:38,349 --> 00:54:40,420
- You...
- Fine. All right.

785
00:54:50,889 --> 00:54:52,760
His personal relation's
too unstable...

786
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:54,699
to look people in the eyes.

787
00:54:54,699 --> 00:54:56,460
He shows signs of rapid...

788
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:59,269
personality changes
from depression to rage.

789
00:55:00,139 --> 00:55:02,400
Piles of medicine.

790
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:05,670
Evident trace of self-injury
on his wrist.

791
00:55:06,110 --> 00:55:08,880
Unpacked packages prove...

792
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:10,550
his compulsive consumption pattern.

793
00:55:10,550 --> 00:55:12,880
It's the typical signs of BPD.

794
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:15,750
BPD patients show a weak attitude,

795
00:55:15,750 --> 00:55:17,349
but when they're under pressure,

796
00:55:17,349 --> 00:55:19,449
they instantly become impulsive.

797
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:21,920
- You...
- Fine. All right.

798
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:24,860
Many BPD patients are caused...

799
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:28,199
by losing the object they loved,
an abuse in the childhood,

800
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:31,099
or a sexual trauma.

801
00:55:31,329 --> 00:55:33,230
It must be the same for
Choi Sang Woo as well.

802
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:35,269
But most BPD patients...

803
00:55:35,269 --> 00:55:38,309
have a fear that they would be
abandoned.

804
00:55:39,070 --> 00:55:41,639
He's closer to the type
with strong egos.

805
00:55:42,909 --> 00:55:46,719
He doesn't fit into the profile
that he started the fire...

806
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:48,820
due to his sister's death.

807
00:55:56,989 --> 00:55:58,630
- Hello.
- Team Manager Kang.

808
00:55:59,130 --> 00:56:01,360
I think I know why Choi Hee Jin
committed suicide.

809
00:56:01,929 --> 00:56:04,369
I was going through
her high school records,

810
00:56:04,469 --> 00:56:06,670
and I found school violence measure
minutes...

811
00:56:06,670 --> 00:56:08,840
in 2004 the year she committed
suicide.

812
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:10,639
Her name was on there.

813
00:56:11,309 --> 00:56:14,739
Aside from the problem
at the center,

814
00:56:14,739 --> 00:56:16,409
it seems she committed suicide...

815
00:56:16,409 --> 00:56:18,409
due to school violence.

816
00:57:04,030 --> 00:57:05,559
What should we do at the festival?

817
00:57:06,829 --> 00:57:08,630
I'm not sure.

818
00:57:09,829 --> 00:57:13,130
Actually, it's my first time
going to a festival.

819
00:57:16,639 --> 00:57:17,869
Sun Woo,

820
00:57:18,610 --> 00:57:20,909
let's just go to the festival now.

821
00:57:26,349 --> 00:57:29,079
- Team Manager Kang.
- There's a high possibility...

822
00:57:29,219 --> 00:57:31,590
that Choi Sang Woo didn't set
the fire because of his sister.

823
00:57:31,949 --> 00:57:35,690
We need to find out what
Choi Sang Woo went through...

824
00:57:35,690 --> 00:57:37,130
at the center in the past.

825
00:58:16,730 --> 00:58:18,829
I'm not the one. I didn't do it.

826
00:58:18,829 --> 00:58:21,769
Dae Soo. Dae Soo.

827
00:58:22,070 --> 00:58:25,739
Dae Soo. Wait. Dae Soo.

828
00:58:57,869 --> 00:59:00,280
Team Manager Kang. Hyun Jun
changed his testimony.

829
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:02,010
Did you kill Kang Ho Young...

830
00:59:02,010 --> 00:59:03,610
to close the case for good?

831
00:59:03,909 --> 00:59:05,710
We must stop them.

832
00:59:05,710 --> 00:59:07,480
Team Manager Kang has a plan.

833
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:10,119
Are you saying
there's an accomplice?

834
00:59:11,989 --> 00:59:14,019
Hurry up and find Hyun Jun!

835
00:59:16,619 --> 00:59:19,190
He's not aware that we know
who he is.

836
00:59:19,190 --> 00:59:20,659
I found his location.

837
00:59:23,699 --> 00:59:25,699
He's after the whole team.
