(Episode 5)

10
00:00:42,979 --> 00:00:47,049
When did you first find out that the
Reaper was after Team Manager Kang?

11
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,590
We found when he received a
threatening call from the Reaper...

12
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:53,460
and Han Byul disappeared.

13
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:56,159
Why do you think the Reaper
went for his family...

14
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:57,859
instead of Team Manager Kang?

15
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:01,369
That would cause more pain for him.

16
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:03,200
He has an abnormal mentality,

17
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:05,439
and he feels that he is superior
while watching others in pain.

18
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:06,439
All right.

19
00:01:07,269 --> 00:01:10,609
Tell me what happened on May 17,
the day he was arrested.

20
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:13,680
I don't really understand
this situation.

21
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:16,049
Don't you think so too?

22
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:18,549
You already know
what the Reaper did...

23
00:01:18,849 --> 00:01:20,189
to Team Manager Kang.

24
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:24,359
Do you think that Team Manager Kang
acted rationally that day?

25
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,230
I already wrote about that
on the report.

26
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:29,530
All right.
I will ask you a different question.

27
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:32,459
If the Reaper comes back,

28
00:01:32,829 --> 00:01:36,629
will Team Manager Kang be able
to investigate the case rationally?

29
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,370
Let me ask you a question.

30
00:01:38,739 --> 00:01:40,140
Why are you...

31
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,540
trying to confuse the team over
a case that is already over?

32
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:44,540
We need to stop him.

33
00:01:44,609 --> 00:01:47,049
The Reaper has escaped from prison,

34
00:01:47,209 --> 00:01:50,719
which means the same thing
could happen again at anytime.

35
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:57,859
Kim Hyun Jun refused to participate
in the interrogation again.

36
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,829
If he does not cooperate,
we will do something about it.

37
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:10,000
It's been a month since...

38
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,039
the suspect of the Seoul
Northwestern Serial Murder case,

39
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:16,610
Kim Yong Chul,
escaped from prison.

40
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:20,080
This is a state of emergency,
and the citizens are no longer safe.

41
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,710
However, the police seems to be
doing nothing,

42
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,879
and the citizens are getting angry.

43
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:27,389
According to the police,

44
00:02:27,389 --> 00:02:30,590
they do not even know
the whereabouts of Kim Yong Chul.

45
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:33,930
I found records indicating that
he has been taking "Tapazol",

46
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:36,629
which is used to treat
hyperthyroidism.

47
00:02:37,129 --> 00:02:39,699
He has received a lot of
antibiotic penicillin...

48
00:02:39,699 --> 00:02:42,199
like ampicillin and methicillin
to treat internal injuries.

49
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:45,069
That is why I examined
the medications sold at...

50
00:02:45,069 --> 00:02:46,569
all the pharmacies
in the country this month.

51
00:02:48,169 --> 00:02:51,240
I found out about a man who used
a fake identity to buy...

52
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,439
these medications
with a fake prescription.

53
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:56,509
It doesn't show his face clearly,
but the man in the footage...

54
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:58,080
looks similar to Kim Yong Chul.

55
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,020
No!

56
00:03:19,569 --> 00:03:20,569
Let go.

57
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:27,949
He also bought a narcotic painkiller
called Oxycontin.

58
00:03:27,949 --> 00:03:30,449
It has narcotic substances,

59
00:03:30,449 --> 00:03:33,590
so if you take too much,
you can have hallucinations.

60
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:35,789
It's highly addictive,
which is why it is regulated.

61
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,439
The psychological test results...

62
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,370
of Team Manger Kang came out.

63
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,509
It says that he shows signs of PTSD.

64
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:30,910
Did you know that?

65
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:34,180
After all, his wife passed away
right in front of his eyes.

66
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,810
It's only natural.

67
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,750
I let him work after the incident
only because he wanted to.

68
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,920
But the authorities are worried.

69
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,290
Why are you discussing his problems
with me?

70
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:48,389
I need you to give me
reports on him.

71
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:52,560
I don't understand.

72
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:55,269
What is it
you really want to tell me?

73
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:58,600
As you know well enough,
one can't overcome...

74
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,839
the symptoms of PTSD
in a short period of time.

75
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:05,040
The team will suffer from the after
effects during that period.

76
00:05:05,709 --> 00:05:08,810
The head office is discussing
whether they should eliminate...

77
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:11,819
Team Manager Kang
from the investigation.

78
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,389
If I were him, I would've killed him
on that spot,

79
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,720
but he was able to suppress it.

80
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,199
What are you trying to say?

81
00:05:25,629 --> 00:05:28,600
Team Manager Kang
will never fall apart...

82
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:31,300
because of Han Byul.

83
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:33,870
Don't involve
your personal opinions.

84
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:36,139
Make an objective judgement
for the team.

85
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:42,610
You may end up leading the team.

86
00:06:40,939 --> 00:06:45,009
(10 hours after the incident, 10pm)

87
00:06:55,589 --> 00:06:57,720
Are you okay?

88
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,600
- Blood.
- Oh, my.

89
00:07:08,899 --> 00:07:10,199
What's wrong with her?

90
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:14,110
(Emergency Medical Center)

91
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:16,139
Help. Help.

92
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:17,910
- Please help.
- Help us first.

93
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,779
- Doctor.
- Doctor, please help me.

94
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,579
- Here.
- Help me.

95
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,389
- Is it fun?
- Yes.

96
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:30,819
Ha Eun. Give me one.

97
00:07:31,389 --> 00:07:32,420
- Right.
- Here.

98
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,860
You must be very happy, Ha Eun.

99
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,860
Aunt Min Young is packing gimbap
for you.

100
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:40,529
It's great. It's wicked.

101
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,139
I told you not to use
that kind of language.

102
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,100
Sorry.

103
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:50,879
Hello?

104
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:53,480
I got it.

105
00:07:57,319 --> 00:08:01,550
Sorry, Ha Eun. It's an emergency.
I have to go.

106
00:08:04,089 --> 00:08:05,389
What about gimbap?

107
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:09,060
You promised to make gimbap
for the picnic.

108
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:11,899
Please take care of her.
I'll call you later.

109
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,430
Aunt Min Young.

110
00:08:14,829 --> 00:08:15,870
My name is Yoo Min Young.

111
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:17,439
I'm Seo Hye Young...

112
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:18,699
from the Centers for Korea
Disease Control Prevention.

113
00:08:19,339 --> 00:08:22,410
72 people were hospitalized
in Seoul area last night.

114
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:25,740
All victims are found to be
in the park yesterday around noon.

115
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,709
Then 10 hours later,
at 10 o' clock last night,

116
00:08:27,709 --> 00:08:29,410
we had our first casualty.

117
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:31,879
Right now at 7:20 AM,

118
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:34,490
it is reported that the number
of deaths is at 17.

119
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,620
According to the Centers for
Korea Disease Control Prevention,

120
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:40,059
anthrax bacteria was found
in the victims' blood.

121
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,159
Anthrax bacteria?

122
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:43,659
It's a biological weapon
that causes a fatal infection.

123
00:08:44,129 --> 00:08:47,500
When you're infected by
the anthrax bacteria,

124
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,370
your initial symptoms are
similar to a cold.

125
00:08:49,769 --> 00:08:53,039
If the infection gets worse,
you will eventually die.

126
00:08:53,269 --> 00:08:55,269
We don't have any similar cases
yet in Korea,

127
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:58,340
but Japan had a biochemistry
terror incident similar to this.

128
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:02,250
Twice on June 27 and July 2 in 1993.

129
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:04,220
The Aum Shinrikyu headquarters
in Tokyo...

130
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:06,220
cultivated anthrax bacteria
and distributed it.

131
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,720
After the 911 terror in the US,

132
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,419
people were terrified by terrorists
delivering white power...

133
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,289
with anthrax bacteria in it.

134
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:18,830
The thing is you don't die this fast
with anthrax bacteria.

135
00:09:19,629 --> 00:09:20,799
What if it's a variant of it?

136
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:26,539
Terrorists usually change the virus
for an easy infection.

137
00:09:27,909 --> 00:09:31,110
They probably developed it to
get infected by respiratory system.

138
00:09:31,539 --> 00:09:34,350
You're right. They made a variant,
so that people will be infected...

139
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:35,610
just from breathing.

140
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:36,950
These wounds here...

141
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:39,279
doubled in size
just after few minutes.

142
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,590
What's more dangerous is
not the outer wounds,

143
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:42,990
but the respiratory organ, lungs.

144
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:46,490
Once the poison gets inside the
lungs, there's no way to detox it.

145
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,460
Are you saying everyone will die?

146
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,559
How is the media?

147
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:52,159
There is a press ban...

148
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:54,529
for 24 hours
for the national security.

149
00:09:54,529 --> 00:09:58,169
Also, the victims are reported as
having an acute lung disease.

150
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,470
But you should let the victims know.

151
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:03,409
Haven't you thought about...

152
00:10:03,409 --> 00:10:05,580
the chaos it will cause once
this information leaks?

153
00:10:05,909 --> 00:10:09,710
Social Psychologist Le Bon said
everyone's reason and...

154
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:12,480
consciousness are annihilated in the
public by the group consciousness.

155
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:16,750
It means if the information gets
leaked, there may be a group panic.

156
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,720
Are you saying it is okay...

157
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:22,129
to let them die without knowing why
as long as it prevents chaos?

158
00:10:24,929 --> 00:10:26,529
Let's stop talking about
this problem here.

159
00:10:26,899 --> 00:10:29,769
The best way to save the victims is
not to tell them about the incident,

160
00:10:29,769 --> 00:10:33,269
but to find the way to solve this
as fast as we can.

161
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:35,039
- Team Manager Kang.
- Hyun Jun.

162
00:10:35,539 --> 00:10:36,639
Let's stop now.

163
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:48,090
There's a report on increase in
acute lung disease patients.

164
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:51,220
Due to the sudden increase
of patients with acute lung disease,

165
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:54,029
all emergency centers in Seoul
are paralyzed.

166
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,659
We'll hear from the reporter
Lee Hye Jin at the site.

167
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,759
This is not enough.

168
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:01,529
Are you ready?

169
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:03,730
Yes. I'm almost ready.

170
00:11:06,539 --> 00:11:10,570
Do they want to set up the case
control headquarter here?

171
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:14,950
This is not simple.

172
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:18,549
National terrorists might be
involved in this.

173
00:11:18,649 --> 00:11:21,950
I confirmed that there is no
movement in oversea terrorists...

174
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:24,860
such as North Korea or IS in this.

175
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,159
Are you sure it's the work
of an insider?

176
00:11:27,259 --> 00:11:30,059
Here's a list of people in Ministry
of National Defense,

177
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:33,730
Blue House secretaries and related
newspapers for investigation.

178
00:11:38,769 --> 00:11:40,100
If things go wrong,

179
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,639
the people on this list
will make you take responsibility.

180
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,509
You know what that means
better than anyone else.

181
00:11:46,509 --> 00:11:48,779
I'm not in the situation
to think about it.

182
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:53,120
Sure. I'll make them arrive here
in 30 minutes.

183
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:56,090
Get ready to profile them
right away.

184
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,059
Are you okay?

185
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:04,799
There's nothing for you
to worry about.

186
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:22,809
They're from Special Crimes
Investigation team.

187
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:24,879
They'll ask you a few questions.

188
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,250
You can stop if it's too hard.

189
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:34,929
Now, we'll do a memory processor
exercise.

190
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:38,600
Recall your memory
from the park yesterday.

191
00:12:39,029 --> 00:12:40,360
Will you be okay?

192
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,700
Did you go to the park
to ride a bicycle?

193
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:53,340
Remember the feeling of the sunshine
touching your skin...

194
00:12:53,509 --> 00:12:54,850
and the wind blowing
through your hair.

195
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:58,250
You can tell me anything
you remember...

196
00:12:59,049 --> 00:13:02,750
about the sounds you heard,
the people you saw,

197
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:05,190
and what they were doing.

198
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:08,889
It was very warm.

199
00:13:10,029 --> 00:13:12,029
The wind was cool.

200
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:17,399
Some people were with their family.

201
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,909
They all looked so happy.

202
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,779
Now, what do you see around you?

203
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,549
Trees...

204
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:30,879
and the forest.

205
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:36,019
There were some dogs out on a walk.

206
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:38,190
A hill.

207
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,559
What's there?

208
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,299
There was someone standing...

209
00:13:44,299 --> 00:13:45,659
in the back.

210
00:13:47,129 --> 00:13:49,600
A man.

211
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:51,940
What man?

212
00:13:53,769 --> 00:13:57,409
A man dressed in black.

213
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:01,409
The man's face...

214
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,879
isn't very visible.

215
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:07,649
Toxins are entering the parietal
lobe and causing a speech disorder.

216
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:10,450
It's a sign that
she's getting worse.

217
00:14:12,259 --> 00:14:15,159
Once more time. Try again.

218
00:14:19,529 --> 00:14:23,370
That's enough, Sung Yeon.
You can rest now.

219
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:26,639
Please tell me one more time.

220
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:28,070
Stop.

221
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:30,039
Let's stop now.

222
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:40,820
Let's go.

223
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:43,950
I'm not sure...

224
00:14:44,659 --> 00:14:46,960
if it's right to keep it a secret
from the family.

225
00:14:47,289 --> 00:14:49,690
What we must do now is to find
the man who spread...

226
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:52,200
the mutated anthrax bacteria
as fast as we can.

227
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:55,000
The antibody in the criminal's
anthrax bacteria...

228
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:58,240
is the only way to save the victims.

229
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,919
We will start profiling
the suspect...

230
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:13,879
of the anthrax bacteria Case.

231
00:15:14,049 --> 00:15:16,320
Please tell us if you know anyone...

232
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,389
who fits the profile.

233
00:15:17,389 --> 00:15:19,759
This case happened at a park.

234
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:22,529
Parks usually don't
symbolize things.

235
00:15:22,529 --> 00:15:25,100
That means, there had to be
a personal reason...

236
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,629
for the culprit to choose the park.

237
00:15:28,629 --> 00:15:31,769
Culprits who value
their personal feelings...

238
00:15:31,769 --> 00:15:34,370
are usually dreamers who believe...

239
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:35,669
what they are doing is important.

240
00:15:36,309 --> 00:15:37,740
He could have foreseen...

241
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:41,210
in the past that attacks like this
could happen in Korea.

242
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:44,419
People around him would
think of him...

243
00:15:44,419 --> 00:15:46,549
as unstable, paranoid,
and secretive.

244
00:15:46,549 --> 00:15:48,990
They would not wish to get
close to him.

245
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:52,120
He would have worked overtime
these last few weeks...

246
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,889
to create variants.

247
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:56,590
He would also have his own lab...

248
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:59,600
to grow the anthrax bacteria.

249
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,700
It's highly possible that he wrote a
book about bacteriological warfare.

250
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:06,539
But he would have become angry at
the fact that...

251
00:16:07,539 --> 00:16:08,909
no one was interested
in bacteriological warfare.

252
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,210
We don't have much time.

253
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:14,950
If we don't find him soon,

254
00:16:15,149 --> 00:16:17,980
he will cause serious problems.

255
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,480
I believe that the suspect...

256
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:22,149
is someone around you.

257
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,720
(Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention)

258
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:25,190
She's here.

259
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:28,330
What is the real reason behind
the shutdown of the park?

260
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:31,059
Is it true that someone has released
toxic gas?

261
00:16:31,299 --> 00:16:34,059
We are not sure about anything yet.

262
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,470
But as the paper I sent you says,

263
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:38,139
we'll hold a press conference
as soon as we find something.

264
00:16:38,139 --> 00:16:39,340
We ask for your cooperation.

265
00:16:42,139 --> 00:16:43,710
Has the area been cleaned?

266
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:45,580
Yes, it will be safe now.

267
00:16:46,809 --> 00:16:48,210
- A word please.
- A word please.

268
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:49,909
- Was it toxic gas?
- What was the problem?

269
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,889
Some people were with their family.

270
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:08,299
I saw dogs that came out for a walk.

271
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,400
They all looked so happy.

272
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:16,769
There was someone standing.

273
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:18,839
Someone was standing far away?

274
00:17:20,009 --> 00:17:21,109
A man...

275
00:17:21,809 --> 00:17:23,349
wearing black clothes on the hill.

276
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:34,359
The wind was blowing northeast
at the time of the incident.

277
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:37,190
He must have stood here.

278
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,059
If he released the powder here,
the wind...

279
00:17:43,299 --> 00:17:44,940
would have carried it over there.

280
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:46,599
Most of the victims...

281
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:49,509
were people who came out for a walk
and were unaware.

282
00:17:49,509 --> 00:17:51,309
Do you think the suspect
felt excitement...

283
00:17:51,309 --> 00:17:52,809
while thinking of the victims dying?

284
00:17:52,809 --> 00:17:54,809
If that was the case, he'd commit
crimes that would've allowed him...

285
00:17:54,809 --> 00:17:56,380
to witness the victims' reactions
right away.

286
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:58,220
There has to be another reason.

287
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:00,579
He could be excited by
watching the progress.

288
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:07,359
Do you see that man?

289
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:09,559
He's wearing a mask although...

290
00:18:09,559 --> 00:18:11,329
we didn't tell anyone
it was anthrax bacteria.

291
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:14,329
He's also wearing a backpack and
sneakers, so he can run at anytime.

292
00:18:16,069 --> 00:18:18,069
He could know the reason.

293
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:39,420
- Nana.
- Yes, Hyun Jun?

294
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:42,849
Check all the security footage
within 2km of Seoul Forest.

295
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:49,130
Did you find him?

296
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:51,930
Well...

297
00:19:52,599 --> 00:19:54,059
The thing is...

298
00:19:54,869 --> 00:19:57,569
none of them got a clear picture
of him.

299
00:19:58,069 --> 00:20:01,710
And he's wearing a hat, which makes
identifying him nearly impossible.

300
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:02,710
Let me see.

301
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:13,019
He must have received
systematic training.

302
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:23,359
I am Captain Cho Seok Hoon
of the storming party.

303
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:25,529
Could you check the footage
I found?

304
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:28,500
I think this person matches
the profiling.

305
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:31,230
This is a video of
the parliamentary hearing...

306
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,970
on "Jupiter Program".

307
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,309
The US forces
have been carrying...

308
00:20:35,309 --> 00:20:38,140
a huge amount of anthrax bacteria
that could kill millions...

309
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:41,579
into their operating base in Korea.

310
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,849
This is the situation we are in.

311
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:47,680
What would have happened
if it was done by...

312
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,150
North Korea?

313
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:51,859
If anthrax bacteria spreads
in parks or public facilities...

314
00:20:51,859 --> 00:20:54,160
as an attack
on unspecified individuals,

315
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,390
thousands, no, millions
of people will die.

316
00:20:57,329 --> 00:20:59,660
If we don't do anything about this,

317
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:02,930
our people could be massacred...

318
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,099
unprepared.

319
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,170
Find out what he said...

320
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:10,670
before the forest had been made.

321
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:11,680
Yes, sir.

322
00:21:13,009 --> 00:21:15,609
He wanted to build a biochemistry
research center...

323
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:18,380
with the land and money
they spent on the park.

324
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:19,650
It's possible...

325
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:21,650
that he has an accomplice.

326
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:23,650
What happened to him after that?

327
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:27,259
The council chose not to believe
Doctor Jang's violent words.

328
00:21:27,259 --> 00:21:29,660
He was banished by the National
Defense and Science Institute,

329
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:31,900
and other important responsibilities
he had.

330
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:34,059
How is he now?

331
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:36,029
I researched about it.

332
00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:40,000
He is currently working at "Fine",
a multinational pharmaceutical firm.

333
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,339
If he's at a pharmaceutical,

334
00:21:41,339 --> 00:21:43,509
he could have acquired
anthrax bacteria easily.

335
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:47,980
Team Manager Kang, it's 12 o'clock
and there are three more dead.

336
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:51,579
Go with Han to find out more about
Doctor Jang.

337
00:21:51,579 --> 00:21:53,579
If he has an accomplice,
he would have left a trace.

338
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,519
Sun Woo. Come with me to the
pharmaceutical firm.

339
00:22:16,009 --> 00:22:17,839
He hasn't come to work
for a few days.

340
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:19,680
We've been worried too.

341
00:22:20,279 --> 00:22:22,849
Did something happen to him?

342
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:25,279
We can't tell you the specifics.

343
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:26,880
- All right.
- I need to see his research lab.

344
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,220
All right. Follow me.

345
00:22:33,089 --> 00:22:34,089
It's here.

346
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:43,930
It seems like he doesn't leave his
house for a long period of time.

347
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:54,809
Hello?

348
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,849
Is anyone there?

349
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,480
It's negative.

350
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:29,680
There is no proof that he grew
the anthrax bacteria here.

351
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,480
Check to see if they found anything
in his home.

352
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:33,619
Yes, sir.

353
00:23:56,609 --> 00:23:58,940
- Hello.
- Did you find anything?

354
00:23:59,109 --> 00:24:01,410
It seems like someone has been
living here recently,

355
00:24:01,809 --> 00:24:03,950
but the door wasn't locked...

356
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:05,680
and something isn't right.

357
00:24:06,349 --> 00:24:07,920
Call me again
when you find something.

358
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,089
All right.

359
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,490
Lee Han, did you find...

360
00:24:14,289 --> 00:24:15,490
Where did he go?

361
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:23,400
Endodontology, sociology,
pathology...

362
00:24:24,269 --> 00:24:26,240
What's this? "Girls"?

363
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,529
Hey, Han.

364
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:32,500
Stay away.

365
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:34,500
You have to stay away.
Don't open the door.

366
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,500
What are you doing? Open the door.

367
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:37,730
Stop.

368
00:26:37,829 --> 00:26:38,900
Please.

369
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:41,970
This place...

370
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:44,470
is exposed to anthrax bacteria.

371
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:46,880
What?

372
00:26:48,279 --> 00:26:49,380
What?

373
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:53,480
Team Manager Kang. Han has been
exposed to anthrax bacteria.

374
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:54,750
What?

375
00:26:59,019 --> 00:27:02,029
Mom. I'm on the train.

376
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:04,029
I'll call you again.

377
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:08,259
Do you want to call your mom too,
Eun?

378
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,130
- Yes.
- Here.

379
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,880
Hello. This is Yoo Min Young.

380
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,180
Mom. This is me, Ha Eun.

381
00:27:23,509 --> 00:27:24,680
I told you to call me Aunt.

382
00:27:25,849 --> 00:27:28,180
My friend told me to call Mom...

383
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:30,420
before the train leaves.

384
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:35,130
We have a problem, Min Young.

385
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:37,660
What are we going to do
about Han now?

386
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:40,529
Sorry, I'll call you later.

387
00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:43,670
What are we going to do now?

388
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:50,440
Hey, Han. Are you crazy?
Get out of there now.

389
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:53,839
Just because I'm exposed to
anthrax bacteria for a long time,

390
00:27:54,279 --> 00:27:55,609
it doesn't mean it will get worse.

391
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:59,450
If you don't get out of there now,
I'll break this door down.

392
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,490
If you don't want me to beat you,
get out of there right now.

393
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:05,720
Now, you jerk.

394
00:28:06,289 --> 00:28:09,160
Hyun Jun. I'm not going to die.

395
00:28:10,859 --> 00:28:13,000
I'm a genius with IQ 187.

396
00:28:13,829 --> 00:28:16,029
Having a high IQ...

397
00:28:16,029 --> 00:28:18,569
means I'm good at solving problems.

398
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:24,440
If I look for it here,
I'm sure I can find the cure...

399
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:27,740
as well as the criminal.

400
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:45,200
(Police Line)

401
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:50,369
Wait for me. I'll come back.

402
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:08,519
The large intestines are 5cm deep.

403
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:11,019
This is only a surface wound.

404
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:14,089
In this case,

405
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:17,029
I just need to stop the blood.

406
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,109
Yes, Han. Listen carefully.

407
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:40,119
As soon as we're ready, agents with
protective suits will go in.

408
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:43,220
Leave when that happens
and get treated, get it?

409
00:29:43,319 --> 00:29:45,559
No, we need...

410
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:48,529
someone to investigate the case
in here.

411
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:50,990
Hey, do you really want me
to get upset?

412
00:29:51,529 --> 00:29:54,029
There's less than seven hours left
for victims.

413
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:56,900
Unless we find a clue, there's
no point of going to the hospital.

414
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,170
What if he doesn't find it?

415
00:30:01,869 --> 00:30:03,069
(Centers for Korea Disease
Control Prevention)

416
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:05,640
Tell him to get out of there now.

417
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:09,079
Team Manager Kang.

418
00:30:10,849 --> 00:30:14,920
I refuse to see another one of my
colleagues die before my eyes again.

419
00:30:21,589 --> 00:30:22,930
Let's trust Han.

420
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:26,599
That might save everyone.

421
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:38,410
I connected the surveillance
to the screen.

422
00:30:39,309 --> 00:30:41,740
We'll organize everything
we've found so far.

423
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:43,779
Tell me about the things you see
in there.

424
00:30:53,019 --> 00:30:54,559
When I entered the lab,

425
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,829
there was a trace of blood
from the culture room.

426
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:03,700
At the end of it, Doctor Jang Ji Ho
was dead with a damage in the skull.

427
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:05,740
By looking at the damage,

428
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,339
someone had struck him
with a club.

429
00:31:08,569 --> 00:31:10,410
By looking at the purple spot
on the dead body,

430
00:31:11,509 --> 00:31:12,980
he's been dead for few days.

431
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,279
Doctor Jang was already killed...

432
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:21,880
before the first attack...

433
00:31:22,349 --> 00:31:23,650
by the man I missed.

434
00:31:24,289 --> 00:31:27,960
Han. There must be evidence
to find the accomplice.

435
00:31:28,259 --> 00:31:29,930
We must find the criminal.

436
00:31:30,589 --> 00:31:31,759
I'll take a look.

437
00:31:40,839 --> 00:31:42,039
What do you see inside?

438
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:43,940
There are two desks.

439
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,309
One desk is very messy,

440
00:31:46,579 --> 00:31:48,980
but the other one is very organized.

441
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:51,480
Are you saying there are two
work desks?

442
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:02,230
Yes. There are two different
writings.

443
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:05,400
Oh, I found it.

444
00:32:06,329 --> 00:32:07,599
His name is Lee Seok Han.

445
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:09,869
He got his master's degree in
microbiology at Hankuk University.

446
00:32:10,329 --> 00:32:14,200
When he was doing his master's,
his professor was Doctor Jang.

447
00:32:14,539 --> 00:32:15,539
Lee Seok Han?

448
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,609
I'll check.

449
00:32:20,309 --> 00:32:21,509
Something's weird.

450
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,779
What? What is?

451
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:26,279
I'm deducing Seok Han's personality
based on his research.

452
00:32:27,019 --> 00:32:29,250
He uses defensive sentences
and has a defensive writing style.

453
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,490
He's not dominant
but very subordinate.

454
00:32:32,859 --> 00:32:34,519
He doesn't hold...

455
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:37,490
his opinions.

456
00:32:38,059 --> 00:32:40,660
Are you saying he's not the type
to lead the crime?

457
00:32:41,329 --> 00:32:43,299
Han, I found a picture.

458
00:32:43,299 --> 00:32:45,440
Check to see if he's the one
who attacked you.

459
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,670
It's not him.

460
00:32:52,109 --> 00:32:54,039
He's not the one we missed either.

461
00:32:55,109 --> 00:32:56,180
Are you sure, Han?

462
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:57,579
I'm sure.

463
00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:01,019
He doesn't have these eyes.

464
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:04,089
Han, you must hold tight.

465
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:07,059
There must be something about
the guy who attacked you.

466
00:33:08,759 --> 00:33:09,829
Yes.

467
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:22,440
(Day 5 - rats, Day 15 - dogs,
Day 30 - humans)

468
00:33:26,339 --> 00:33:28,309
There's a note on the clinical test.

469
00:33:29,009 --> 00:33:31,210
Day 5, rats. Day 15, dogs.

470
00:33:31,579 --> 00:33:32,920
Day 30, humans.

471
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:36,750
When you consider
the clinical test process,

472
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:40,789
you first test on rats, then
bigger mammals.

473
00:33:41,089 --> 00:33:43,859
Then, when you reach a certain
point, there's a simple test done...

474
00:33:43,859 --> 00:33:45,730
on humans.

475
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:49,269
Does this mean the suspect conducted
clinical tests prior to the attack?

476
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:51,900
Then we'd have an anthrax bacteria
patient already,

477
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:54,670
but there were no similar cases
before this one.

478
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:56,740
Maybe they didn't know they died
of anthrax bacteria.

479
00:33:57,369 --> 00:33:58,740
When MERS spread,

480
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:01,579
no one knew the first patient
had MERS.

481
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:04,779
Nana, are you listening to me?

482
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:08,820
Find out if anyone died from acute
lung disease three days ago.

483
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:12,559
Three days ago, three patients...

484
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:15,159
in different emergency rooms fell
into a coma and died...

485
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:16,329
from lung complications.

486
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:17,730
What are the victims' names?

487
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:21,800
30-year-old Min Joo Hee, 46-year-old
Park Chang Sun,

488
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,130
52-year-old Joo Young Guk.

489
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:26,269
We need to confirm if they were at
the same location that day.

490
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,769
They worked as event staff
at the same location.

491
00:34:29,309 --> 00:34:32,039
A private security company called
Eagle Security held the event.

492
00:34:32,539 --> 00:34:34,110
The head of the company
is Choi Ho Sung.

493
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:37,050
Oh, my gosh.

494
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:40,019
He worked with Dr. Jang...

495
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:44,420
for four years between 2009 and 2013
at the Agency for Development...

496
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:47,019
as a soldier.

497
00:34:49,929 --> 00:34:50,929
Han,

498
00:34:51,429 --> 00:34:53,329
confirm if this is the man's face.

499
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:00,670
It is! It's him.

500
00:35:04,039 --> 00:35:05,039
Yes.

501
00:35:05,809 --> 00:35:06,940
It was him.

502
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:10,480
Why are you changing your mind now?

503
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,420
I didn't intend to kill anyone.

504
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,750
South Korea needs to be
enveloped in chaos.

505
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:19,920
People need to think that
a war is coming again.

506
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,989
You're the one who said this country
needs chaos.

507
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:25,130
We can't stop now.

508
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:26,929
Didn't you create a new strain of
anthrax bacteria...

509
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,230
for that purpose?

510
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:30,130
Nuclear weapon can only be beaten
by stronger nuclear weapons.

511
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:31,469
The same goes for anthrax bacteria.

512
00:35:31,699 --> 00:35:33,769
I wanted to protect this nation...

513
00:35:33,769 --> 00:35:35,199
from bioterrorism.

514
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:36,610
Don't be ridiculous.

515
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,739
All you are is a traitor.

516
00:35:39,010 --> 00:35:40,909
I don't need a weak coward.

517
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:43,079
Cowards who can't understand...

518
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:44,949
just need a sure warning.

519
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:46,719
Just like you.

520
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:56,829
Let's summarize the situation.

521
00:35:57,530 --> 00:36:00,429
Dr. Jang was likely murdered before
the terrorist attack...

522
00:36:00,429 --> 00:36:03,230
because he opposed
Choi Ho Sung's plan.

523
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:05,800
Fear is a powerful weapon
that controls people.

524
00:36:05,969 --> 00:36:09,070
Lee Seok Han is probably listening
to Ho Sung's orders out of fear.

525
00:36:09,869 --> 00:36:10,940
What about Choi Ho Sung?

526
00:36:11,309 --> 00:36:13,440
His specialty in the military
was intelligence,

527
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:16,150
but he was dispatched overseas
when he was in his 20s.

528
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:17,780
Why did he leave the military?

529
00:36:17,909 --> 00:36:19,380
When he was a sergeant major,

530
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:22,179
he beat up a member in his unit
for incompetence.

531
00:36:22,179 --> 00:36:25,320
He's a performance-oriented type
who is very self-centered.

532
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:28,590
He's the type to see things to the
end once he's made the decision.

533
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:30,690
If Choi Ho Sung prepared another
terrorist attack,

534
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,199
he probably won't stop.

535
00:36:33,199 --> 00:36:35,929
Then what can be his last target?

536
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:37,400
I found something.

537
00:36:38,099 --> 00:36:39,239
But it's strange.

538
00:36:39,639 --> 00:36:41,469
It's code black.

539
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:42,670
Code black?

540
00:36:43,309 --> 00:36:44,840
I'll look into that.

541
00:36:45,539 --> 00:36:47,309
Team Manager Seo says they're done
cleaning the area,

542
00:36:47,309 --> 00:36:48,610
and they are going
to enter the building.

543
00:36:51,909 --> 00:36:52,949
Doctor.

544
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:54,719
Are you okay?

545
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:05,030
Give me access to code black.

546
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:06,659
There's a piece of information
I really need.

547
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:09,599
Chief Director, you have to take
the initiative and get it to me.

548
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:12,099
We need an exact profile on
Choi Ho Sung...

549
00:37:12,099 --> 00:37:14,570
to find the last target
of his terrorist attacks.

550
00:37:15,239 --> 00:37:16,769
I'll ask you again.

551
00:37:16,769 --> 00:37:18,610
Is this really the only way?

552
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:20,239
Yes. Please.

553
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:05,659
(Choi Ho Sung)

554
00:38:06,619 --> 00:38:08,260
When Choi Ho Sung was young,

555
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:10,789
he joined the war in Afghanistan.

556
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:13,360
He lost all his peers from
a biochemical attack.

557
00:38:14,559 --> 00:38:15,829
But it turned out
it was an accident...

558
00:38:16,099 --> 00:38:18,869
caused by a leak from
an alliance nation.

559
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,000
All pertinent information...

560
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,869
was destroyed to hide this fact.

561
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:29,079
Where might the suspect target next?

562
00:38:29,079 --> 00:38:30,880
Terrorists like Choi Ho Sung...

563
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,179
will probably go for the most
symbolic location.

564
00:38:33,719 --> 00:38:36,519
A public place, something like the
National Assembly Proceeding Hall.

565
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:40,760
I decoded some of the encrypted
files in Choi Ho Sung's computer.

566
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:43,030
I found a couple photos.

567
00:38:43,059 --> 00:38:44,329
I'll send them to you.

568
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:50,599
One is a photo of security cameras
near the park that was attacked.

569
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:51,869
Another is a photo...

570
00:38:51,869 --> 00:38:54,840
of security cameras in Dongan-gu
in Cheonan.

571
00:38:56,010 --> 00:38:57,969
Dongan-gu in Cheonan.

572
00:38:58,670 --> 00:38:59,809
War.

573
00:39:00,809 --> 00:39:01,940
Soldier.

574
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:04,849
And a symbolic place.

575
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,820
The Independence Hall.

576
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:13,389
Pigs go?

577
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:17,960
Wow, the plane's so cool.

578
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,199
- Isn't it?
- It is.

579
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:20,460
Birds go?

580
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,000
Chicks go?

581
00:39:24,269 --> 00:39:25,869
Pigs go?

582
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:32,210
Are you okay?

583
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:34,739
Let's hurry up and go inside.

584
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,650
(Hanyoung Equipments)

585
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:46,760
(Hanyoung Equipments)

586
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,010
No need to worry.

587
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,280
Lee Suk Han.

588
00:40:11,010 --> 00:40:12,619
The world will change now.

589
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,480
Okay.

590
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:25,389
The Independence Hall...
What do I do?

591
00:40:30,369 --> 00:40:31,469
What's wrong?

592
00:40:33,039 --> 00:40:34,739
Ha Eun's kindergarten...

593
00:40:36,639 --> 00:40:37,969
is on a field trip today.

594
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:40,980
I think it's the Independence Hall.

595
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:46,820
I have to call and tell them
to come back.

596
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:48,250
You know the protocol.

597
00:40:48,579 --> 00:40:50,889
You know what happens if
this leaks out to the public.

598
00:40:51,519 --> 00:40:52,690
I know.

599
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:55,559
I know I can't tell anyone.

600
00:40:57,829 --> 00:41:00,130
But you know what Ha Eun is like.

601
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,699
My sister and brother-in-law died in
an accident. She's so little.

602
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:05,769
I can't.

603
00:41:06,039 --> 00:41:07,840
I have to call her.

604
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,440
Yoo Min Young, calm down.

605
00:41:10,539 --> 00:41:12,070
I know how you feel.

606
00:41:12,579 --> 00:41:14,079
I'd feel the same.

607
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:17,409
But I can't let you...

608
00:41:17,409 --> 00:41:19,719
put other children in danger too.

609
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:26,159
This is our job.

610
00:41:27,059 --> 00:41:28,659
We have to beat this.

611
00:41:35,099 --> 00:41:36,170
Okay.

612
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,730
I understand. I'm sorry.

613
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:40,400
We can save them.

614
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:43,510
No, we will save them.

615
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:46,780
So you pull yourself together.

616
00:42:35,619 --> 00:42:37,329
(Independence Hall)

617
00:42:42,099 --> 00:42:44,000
- What's the situation.
- We've searched everywhere...

618
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,030
but the main hall.

619
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:47,369
SWAT team is attempting to
penetrate the Exhibition Hall.

620
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:48,800
We have to stop them
from going in.

621
00:42:49,639 --> 00:42:51,969
Special Task Force, be on stand by
at control HQ.

622
00:42:57,409 --> 00:43:02,719
(Protect the Nation)

623
00:43:04,389 --> 00:43:06,389
Be on stand by? What do you mean?

624
00:43:06,389 --> 00:43:08,019
We are in the middle of profiling.

625
00:43:08,019 --> 00:43:10,760
Until we have a full grasp on
the attacker's plan,

626
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,289
we must not be haste to move.

627
00:43:12,289 --> 00:43:14,929
Do you know how many people
are in the Exhibition Hall?

628
00:43:14,929 --> 00:43:16,230
Yes, I do.

629
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:19,500
But the attackers might not just
be after the visitors.

630
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,409
You're saying we have to
sit and watch...

631
00:43:23,539 --> 00:43:25,110
when we know they're in there?

632
00:43:25,110 --> 00:43:26,179
They already know...

633
00:43:26,309 --> 00:43:28,340
that we're coming after them.

634
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:29,610
If we act hastily,

635
00:43:29,809 --> 00:43:31,280
we'll be in bigger risk.

636
00:43:31,579 --> 00:43:34,079
We have to at least tell the
people inside to evacuate.

637
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:35,079
No, we can't.

638
00:43:41,090 --> 00:43:43,690
As you know well enough,
one can't overcome...

639
00:43:44,030 --> 00:43:45,889
the symptoms of PTSD
in a short period of time.

640
00:43:46,059 --> 00:43:50,099
The team will suffer from the after
effects during that period.

641
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:56,309
Charlie,

642
00:43:56,309 --> 00:43:57,309
we're on standby. Shall we move?

643
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,340
Send in Unit A in three minutes.

644
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:00,940
You can't do that. Stand by.

645
00:44:01,739 --> 00:44:05,409
If things go wrong, who do you think
will have to take responsibility?

646
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:08,219
Can you take the responsibility?

647
00:44:08,219 --> 00:44:10,289
I'll take full responsibility.

648
00:44:10,349 --> 00:44:11,449
Please stand by.

649
00:44:13,159 --> 00:44:15,489
One of our agents is recovering
the surveillance cameras...

650
00:44:15,489 --> 00:44:17,059
that were hacked from the inside.

651
00:44:17,690 --> 00:44:20,929
If we figure out the attacker's
plan and predict his next move,

652
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:23,170
we'll have the advantage.

653
00:44:23,230 --> 00:44:25,369
The Exhibition Hall surveillance
cameras are back up.

654
00:44:26,170 --> 00:44:27,500
Two minutes before operation.

655
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:29,269
We'll go in first.

656
00:44:30,570 --> 00:44:34,210
If you sense any danger,
request SWAT back up.

657
00:44:34,679 --> 00:44:35,710
Yes, sir.

658
00:44:38,909 --> 00:44:41,320
Unit A, remain in standby.

659
00:44:53,559 --> 00:44:55,900
Some of the cameras outside the
Exhibition Hall are back up too.

660
00:45:06,039 --> 00:45:07,079
I'll go to the second floor.

661
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:08,840
If you find anything,
contact me immediately.

662
00:45:19,349 --> 00:45:20,360
No.

663
00:45:22,889 --> 00:45:23,929
Please.

664
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:44,510
If he's after the people inside,

665
00:45:44,510 --> 00:45:46,420
he has to be out in the open.

666
00:45:47,550 --> 00:45:48,949
If I were the culprit,

667
00:45:49,719 --> 00:45:52,250
I wouldn't choose such an
ineffective method.

668
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:07,269
He needs wind.

669
00:46:08,969 --> 00:46:10,039
Wind?

670
00:46:21,550 --> 00:46:24,719
Team Manager Kang,
we know what he's after.

671
00:46:54,019 --> 00:46:55,179
It's the ventilation fan.

672
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:57,719
He placed the anthrax bacteria
in the duct.

673
00:46:58,019 --> 00:47:00,590
Okay. I'll send the team
to the equipment room.

674
00:47:01,059 --> 00:47:02,760
Check when the ventilation fan
turns on.

675
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:04,489
I'm on it, Captain.

676
00:47:04,989 --> 00:47:06,500
For the Independence Hall,

677
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:09,300
the fan turns on for 10 minutes
exactly at every hour.

678
00:47:10,130 --> 00:47:13,300
It's 52 right now,
so we have 8 minutes.

679
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:16,210
Stop the ventilation fan for the
Exhibition Hall right now.

680
00:47:16,210 --> 00:47:17,239
Yes, sir.

681
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:22,340
(Restricted area,
Admittance for staff only)

682
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:23,610
We have five minutes left.

683
00:47:23,909 --> 00:47:25,579
Don't get scared, and make
sure everything's ready.

684
00:47:26,219 --> 00:47:27,219
Yes, sir.

685
00:47:41,329 --> 00:47:45,170
Yes. It has to be shut
down manually.

686
00:47:46,639 --> 00:47:48,469
I'm at the control center myself.

687
00:47:49,610 --> 00:47:51,409
My goodness.

688
00:47:52,070 --> 00:47:55,079
What's with the sudden maintenance?

689
00:47:58,949 --> 00:47:59,980
Stop!

690
00:48:01,619 --> 00:48:04,550
Take your hand off from there
right now.

691
00:48:07,590 --> 00:48:08,889
This is my last warning.

692
00:48:10,130 --> 00:48:12,489
1, 2...

693
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:15,400
(Machine room ventilation)

694
00:48:25,969 --> 00:48:28,239
Moving onto the next step.
Start it now.

695
00:48:28,409 --> 00:48:31,079
Team Manager Kang, Choi Ho Sung
is escaping to the roof.

696
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:35,079
They definitely have a plan B.

697
00:48:35,079 --> 00:48:36,590
We have to figure out what that is.

698
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:45,960
Wind.

699
00:48:48,130 --> 00:48:49,730
Creating wind.

700
00:48:52,070 --> 00:48:55,500
Stream all the outer surveillance
cameras on the screen.

701
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,309
Sorry? Yes, Captain.

702
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:04,079
See if you see the same car...

703
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:06,179
from the park that was attacked.

704
00:49:06,349 --> 00:49:07,380
Yes, Captain.

705
00:49:11,289 --> 00:49:13,860
There are none. I don't see any.

706
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:16,460
Expand the parameters.
We don't have time.

707
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:17,460
Okay.

708
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:20,530
Pause.

709
00:49:23,099 --> 00:49:24,369
(Hanyoung Equipments)

710
00:49:26,030 --> 00:49:28,869
It's that one. It's the one that
was in the park.

711
00:49:39,179 --> 00:49:41,820
A car suspected to be driven
by an accomplice...

712
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:43,150
is approaching
the Independence Hall.

713
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:46,019
Requesting backup.

714
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:51,929
- Goodness!
- Gosh!

715

(Kim Ha Eun)

716
00:49:58,630 --> 00:50:01,000
You know what Ha Eun is like.

717
00:50:01,699 --> 00:50:03,670
My sister and brother-in-law died in
an accident. She's so young.

718
00:50:14,019 --> 00:50:15,079
- Gosh!
- Goodness!

719
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:04,070
Agents are currently chasing a man
suspected to be Lee Suk Han.

720
00:51:05,670 --> 00:51:06,699
Darn it.

721
00:51:08,670 --> 00:51:09,940
Lee Suk Han has been arrested.

722
00:51:11,170 --> 00:51:12,340
(Hanyoung Equipments)

723
00:51:38,329 --> 00:51:39,329
Freeze!

724
00:51:56,420 --> 00:51:58,420
If you move that finger of yours,

725
00:51:59,090 --> 00:52:00,690
I'll blow your head off.

726
00:52:04,630 --> 00:52:06,190
Atonement begins now.

727
00:52:08,099 --> 00:52:09,199
No!

728
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:21,110
Ready to block all signals.

729
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:23,250
Should I really do it though?

730
00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:24,880
We don't have much time.
Do it now.

731
00:52:26,010 --> 00:52:27,050
Captain.

732
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:29,920
Yes, sir.

733
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:37,190
- What?
- It's not working.

734
00:52:37,730 --> 00:52:39,030
- What's going on?
- Why is this happening?

735
00:52:46,599 --> 00:52:48,199
He planned to spread
the anthrax bacteria...

736
00:52:48,199 --> 00:52:51,309
with the help of the explosion
from the car.

737
00:52:53,539 --> 00:52:55,980
Until the cleanup team takes care
of the anthrax bacteria,

738
00:52:55,980 --> 00:52:57,750
everyone in here is in danger.

739
00:52:58,480 --> 00:52:59,510
If we use force,

740
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:01,380
it will explode immediately.

741
00:53:01,679 --> 00:53:03,590
We can stop the explosion
for a while,

742
00:53:03,590 --> 00:53:04,989
but we can't stop the next one.

743
00:53:04,989 --> 00:53:07,190
It will connect to the base stations
nearby in five minutes.

744
00:53:07,190 --> 00:53:08,820
The signal will come back on again.

745
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:09,929
You should get out.

746
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:11,630
I'll move from here.

747
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:12,889
Where's the safest place?

748
00:53:13,730 --> 00:53:15,360
Ha Sun Woo,
are you out of your mind?

749
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:16,969
Get out of there right now.

750
00:53:19,199 --> 00:53:20,500
I've already departed.

751
00:53:20,739 --> 00:53:21,940
I don't have much time. Hurry.

752
00:53:28,239 --> 00:53:30,880
Get out of there first.
Then I'll direct you.

753
00:53:40,619 --> 00:53:41,619
Oh, my.

754
00:53:48,929 --> 00:53:51,530
There's been an accident, that
area is completely backed up.

755
00:53:51,699 --> 00:53:53,739
There's no way out.

756
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:20,760
Sun Woo,

757
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:23,000
if you try to take it apart
by force...

758
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,530
or touch the wrong button,
it will explode right away.

759
00:54:26,199 --> 00:54:28,000
You have
1 minute and 30 seconds left.

760
00:54:30,210 --> 00:54:31,440
We still have time.

761
00:54:31,639 --> 00:54:32,940
What should I do?

762
00:54:33,170 --> 00:54:34,739
Listen to me carefully.

763
00:54:35,510 --> 00:54:38,250
You have to get rid of the explosive
connected to the receiver first.

764
00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:40,380
If you touch the wrong one,
it will explode.

765
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:46,119
It's the red one.

766
00:54:46,389 --> 00:54:47,559
Cut the red line.

767
00:55:03,610 --> 00:55:04,769
Next, cut the white line.

768
00:55:17,019 --> 00:55:18,019
Next,

769
00:55:18,349 --> 00:55:20,119
you can cut the thick power line.

770
00:55:25,090 --> 00:55:26,159
I cut it.

771
00:55:26,630 --> 00:55:28,400
- What's next?
- Lastly,

772
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:30,969
get rid of all the lines connecting
the detonator and the explosive.

773
00:55:33,230 --> 00:55:34,269
Can you do that?

774
00:55:50,349 --> 00:55:51,889
She has 10 seconds left.

775
00:55:58,159 --> 00:56:00,599
- I did it.
- Take the explosive out of the car.

776
00:56:00,599 --> 00:56:01,599
Hurry!

777
00:56:07,070 --> 00:56:08,070
Hello?

778
00:56:08,670 --> 00:56:09,670
Ha Sun Woo?

779
00:56:14,110 --> 00:56:15,110
Where's Ha Eun?

780
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:25,690
(The Independence Movement)

781
00:56:25,690 --> 00:56:26,690
Aunt Min Young!

782
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:37,800
Are you okay?

783
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:44,010
I think this is the vaccine!

784
00:56:54,820 --> 00:56:56,789
- She's here.
- She's here.

785
00:56:57,349 --> 00:57:00,789
The acute lung disease
that killed 22 people...

786
00:57:00,789 --> 00:57:03,829
was caused by
a new hemorrhagic virus.

787
00:57:04,030 --> 00:57:07,400
We have succeeded in developing
a vaccine for the disease.

788
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:10,699
The patients in treatment
are recovering fast.

789
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:15,099
Is he all right?

790
00:57:15,670 --> 00:57:17,469
He did get the vaccine,

791
00:57:18,010 --> 00:57:19,210
but his injury was very deep,

792
00:57:19,210 --> 00:57:21,340
and the infection had spread fast.

793
00:57:22,809 --> 00:57:23,980
For now,

794
00:57:24,309 --> 00:57:26,510
we need to wait for the progress.

795
00:57:31,789 --> 00:57:33,219
(Two weeks later)

796
00:57:33,219 --> 00:57:34,920
- Be careful.
- All right.

797
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:37,389
You've been happy all day.

798
00:57:37,889 --> 00:57:40,559
Why does she like gimbap so much?

799
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:43,159
It's because of a promise she made
with her mom a few years ago.

800
00:57:44,230 --> 00:57:46,230
She was going to go on a picnic
with gimbap,

801
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:48,840
but her parents had
a car accident the day before.

802
00:57:50,869 --> 00:57:52,110
Is this the right one?

803
00:57:55,010 --> 00:57:56,239
Do you really like it that much?

804
00:57:57,710 --> 00:57:59,650
- Han Byul.
- Han Byul.

805
00:58:00,050 --> 00:58:01,480
Here! Come quickly.

806
00:58:03,519 --> 00:58:07,159
I made these myself.
Eat up.

807
00:58:07,159 --> 00:58:09,920
How did you make it look so pretty?

808
00:58:10,730 --> 00:58:12,889
You should have a daughter
when you get married.

809
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:14,760
- Do you like it?
- It's delicious.

810
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:15,760
Is it?

811
00:58:19,699 --> 00:58:20,699
Get my ball.

812
00:58:22,139 --> 00:58:23,469
- Okay.
- You're good.

813
00:58:23,469 --> 00:58:24,469
Give it to me now.

814
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:27,980
It's been a while
since I've seen you smile.

815
00:58:29,210 --> 00:58:30,280
Has it?

816
00:58:30,409 --> 00:58:31,679
- Hyun Jun.
- Nana!

817
00:58:32,650 --> 00:58:33,849
- Hyun Jun...
- Gosh.

818
00:58:34,719 --> 00:58:36,989
- seems like a nice man.
- Hyun Jun!

819
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:39,690
Ha Eun's teacher told me...

820
00:58:40,050 --> 00:58:41,719
that someone with a radio...

821
00:58:41,719 --> 00:58:44,460
had told them to move aside, saying
he was doing maintenance work.

822
00:58:45,429 --> 00:58:46,900
He would have done that...

823
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:51,000
if he was there.

824
00:58:53,170 --> 00:58:54,840
What do you mean?

825
00:58:55,539 --> 00:58:56,940
He...

826
00:58:57,940 --> 00:58:59,369
was on the second floor.

827
00:59:00,110 --> 00:59:01,179
Then...

828
00:59:02,380 --> 00:59:04,179
it was Sun Woo?

829
00:59:06,780 --> 00:59:09,250
You should get outside.
We're doing maintenance work here.

830
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:10,820
It's too dangerous
for you to be here.

831
00:59:10,820 --> 00:59:12,989
You should go to another building
or go outside.

832
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:20,300
Let's fly!

833
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:21,960
Nice!

834
00:59:30,539 --> 00:59:31,539
Were you here?

835
00:59:33,610 --> 00:59:34,639
Even their families...

836
00:59:35,239 --> 00:59:38,150
don't know why
they had to be sacrificed.

837
00:59:39,579 --> 00:59:41,250
Someone should remember them.

838
00:59:44,190 --> 00:59:46,320
It would be nice if Han could come.

839
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:49,690
It's good to hear that
he'll be released soon.

840
00:59:53,329 --> 00:59:55,130
Why didn't you tell Min Young?

841
00:59:57,230 --> 00:59:58,929
I did what I was supposed to do.

842
01:00:00,269 --> 01:00:02,869
You would have done the same thing.

843
01:00:13,079 --> 01:00:14,920
The wind is so nice.

844
01:00:16,179 --> 01:00:17,219
Let's walk together.

845
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:21,159
“Convictions...”

846
01:00:21,159 --> 01:00:23,619
"are more dangerous foes
of truth than lies."

847
01:00:24,460 --> 01:00:25,460
Friedrich Nietzsche.

848
01:00:33,469 --> 01:00:34,469
Han Byul.

849
01:00:35,469 --> 01:00:36,469
Han Byul.

850
01:01:01,559 --> 01:01:03,460
When did the victim go missing?

851
01:01:03,460 --> 01:01:05,670
It was about 3 to 4 days ago.

852
01:01:05,670 --> 01:01:08,500
According to all the past cases,
the victims were found dead...

853
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:10,239
one week after they went missing.

854
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:13,039
If the culprit is following the
pattern, we have three days left.

855
01:01:13,039 --> 01:01:14,309
We need to find the victim.

856
01:01:14,809 --> 01:01:18,150
We do not know if the kidnapped
victim has been murdered yet.

857
01:01:18,579 --> 01:01:20,679
We can't delay any more time.

858
01:01:21,019 --> 01:01:22,619
There is more than one culprit.

859
01:01:23,150 --> 01:01:25,190
The culprit doesn't seem to be
doing this for himself.

860
01:01:25,420 --> 01:01:26,789
He's aware of the people
watching him.

861
01:01:26,789 --> 01:01:28,190
No, please.

862
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:30,460
Please save me.
