Han Byul.

11
00:00:56,359 --> 00:00:57,359
Han Byul!

12
00:00:57,859 --> 00:00:58,859
Han Byul!

13
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:06,840
(Restricted Number)

14
00:01:09,969 --> 00:01:11,109
This is Kang Ki Hyung.

15
00:01:11,109 --> 00:01:12,739
Your boy is very pretty.

16
00:01:13,379 --> 00:01:16,750
His eyes look exactly
like his dad's.

17
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:17,849
You...

18
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:22,590
Dad?

19
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,859
Yes, Han Byul.

20
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:27,890
You're okay, right?

21
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:29,060
Yes.

22
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:30,700
When are you coming?

23
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:33,769
I met your friend here.

24
00:01:34,269 --> 00:01:35,269
Han Byul.

25
00:01:35,629 --> 00:01:37,400
Can I talk to him for a second?

26
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:40,709
Don't touch my kid.

27
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:44,010
I'm sure you received my gift.

28
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:45,810
How about it?

29
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:49,010
Do you want to start the deal now?

30
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:54,620
Why aren't you answering me?

31
00:01:55,189 --> 00:01:57,459
Where’s your fighting spirit?

32
00:01:59,989 --> 00:02:02,459
Don't touch my kid.

33
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:04,629
Look forward to it.

34
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:06,900
Things will get...

35
00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:09,599
really fun now.

36
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,379
The Reaper has Han Byul.

37
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:28,620
Hae Won.

38
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,990
Sun Woo, Han Byul is missing.

39
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:35,060
I know. We're here now,

40
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:37,330
so don't worry. We'll find him soon.

41
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,500
All right.

42
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,569
I need your cooperation.
A boy is missing.

43
00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:48,169
It happened 40 minutes ago.

44
00:02:48,969 --> 00:02:52,080
I need to check the security footage
of the past hour from all floors.

45
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,080
Yes, sir.

46
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:05,719
Here, can we look at camera seven
from the second floor?

47
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:15,569
Let's look at the next camera.

48
00:03:21,009 --> 00:03:22,009
Camera nine.

49
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:29,849
Can you enlarge this screen?

50
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:43,129
Go to the next one.

51
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:50,370
Camera 15.

52
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:57,879
This is an emergency exit
leading outside.

53
00:04:01,009 --> 00:04:02,180
What happened?

54
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:05,750
I'm heading to the second floor.
He went outside through an exit.

55
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,349
I'm heading that way too.

56
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:27,870
Han Byul!

57
00:04:31,379 --> 00:04:32,379
Han Byul.

58
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:37,079
Are you all right? Did you get hurt?

59
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:40,019
No, but why are you here
instead of Dad?

60
00:04:40,019 --> 00:04:41,019
Han Byul!

61
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,379
Han Byul, are you all right?

62
00:05:05,009 --> 00:05:07,610
Are you sure it was the Reaper?

63
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:11,350
What?

64
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:26,000
I was worried that Han Byul
would have been startled.

65
00:05:26,529 --> 00:05:27,529
I'm relieved to see he's all right.

66
00:05:28,029 --> 00:05:30,470
He was looking forward to
playing with you at home,

67
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:31,839
but now he's fast asleep.

68
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:39,009
Please look after Ki Hyung.

69
00:05:39,709 --> 00:05:40,949
Of course I will.

70
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,649
Don't worry.

71
00:05:55,089 --> 00:05:57,759
He had such a hard time
before he got back into field...

72
00:05:58,629 --> 00:06:00,230
after the explosion.

73
00:06:00,829 --> 00:06:02,769
It was really hard for me
to see him like that.

74
00:06:04,269 --> 00:06:07,339
He constantly had nightmares
at night for a whole year.

75
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,509
This stab wound was
the fatal injury.

76
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:18,920
He died due to profuse bleeding
in his abdominal artery.

77
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,620
This one is the carotid artery.

78
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,920
He was stabbed in his exact
pressure point, even including...

79
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,560
his airway and throat.

80
00:06:24,689 --> 00:06:25,990
How about the previous victims?

81
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:27,759
They have similar wounds.

82
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,230
They died due to bleeding in
abdominal and carotid artery.

83
00:06:30,259 --> 00:06:32,660
If you take a look at the wounds,
you can see that he didn't hesitate,

84
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:34,930
causing clean fatal injuries.

85
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:37,029
By looking at
how he uses his weapon...

86
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:39,069
and how he went for
the exact pressure point,

87
00:06:39,069 --> 00:06:42,269
you can see that he has
surgical knowledge, skills,

88
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:43,339
and experience.

89
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,079
Has the Reaper really come back?

90
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,160
Aren't you going home?

91
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,759
No, I'm not finished with work yet.

92
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I...

93
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,269
About Han Byul and your wife...

94
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:11,699
I will request a protection program
for them to the superior office.

95
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:14,670
Yes, I think that will be
a good idea.

96
00:07:21,209 --> 00:07:23,250
How are you going to survive
without me?

97
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,250
You can't even wear your tie
by yourself.

98
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,220
Hae Won.

99
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:29,620
I'm sorry.

100
00:07:30,019 --> 00:07:32,160
You've already said that
so many times before.

101
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:34,529
I made this decision myself.

102
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:37,089
So, Ki Hyung.

103
00:07:37,529 --> 00:07:40,029
Straighten your shoulders
and cheer up.

104
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,209
Me too. Me too.

105
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:05,660
Team Manager Kang.
Don't worry so much.

106
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,259
Please look after my family.

107
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,029
I'll treat them
as if they're my family.

108
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:45,200
Based on Dong Young siblings',

109
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,100
we compared the suspect conditions.

110
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,399
When we consider his appearance,

111
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:53,700
he's about 178cm. He has
a low and calm voice of 40s.

112
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:56,669
There's a high chance that
he's a professional elite.

113
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:59,610
Among total of 310 copycat crimes,

114
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:02,350
12 suspects match crime file
released to the press...

115
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:05,220
and match appearance.

116
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,450
Separate them by their occupations.

117
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,590
These three have professional jobs
among them.

118
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,720
Find out what they've done lately.

119
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:16,360
Go Sung Jae was sentenced for
seven years for sexual assault of...

120
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,360
a woman and attempted murder
in 2010.

121
00:09:18,429 --> 00:09:20,299
He was released on parole as
a model prisoner two years ago.

122
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:24,240
He's currently teaching
at his father's computer academy.

123
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:27,909
Park Sang Gu immigrated to
Philippines three years ago.

124
00:09:28,669 --> 00:09:29,840
It is unable to identify...

125
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:33,679
recent traces of Seo Jin Hwan.

126
00:09:34,309 --> 00:09:37,250
When's the last record of Jin Hwan?

127
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,549
There's a record of him working
for errand services...

128
00:09:39,549 --> 00:09:40,720
a year ago.

129
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,120
Let's start with Go Sung Jin first.

130
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:49,889
Darn it.

131
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:00,470
- My goodness.
- Stop.

132
00:10:04,509 --> 00:10:05,980
- Don't come.
- Help me.

133
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:08,610
Please.

134
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:10,350
- Don't come.
- Save me please.

135
00:10:18,259 --> 00:10:19,690
Hey, Go Sung Jin.

136
00:10:31,539 --> 00:10:32,539
What?

137
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,169
What is this?

138
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:43,379
I didn't do it.

139
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,049
I really didn't do it.

140
00:10:45,049 --> 00:10:48,120
We already found a trace of you
visiting the website on...

141
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,019
Northwestern Serial Murder Case.

142
00:10:50,019 --> 00:10:53,320
That's because I heard Reaper
is back, so I was...

143
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,490
Then why did you run away?

144
00:11:01,299 --> 00:11:03,100
I'm asking you why you ran away.

145
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:06,870
It's not him.

146
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:10,509
We found a video tape of him
having sex with a runaway.

147
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:14,009
The time of record matches
the time of the camp site incident.

148
00:11:14,509 --> 00:11:17,250
See? I told you it wasn't me.

149
00:11:29,929 --> 00:11:31,500
I'm from NCI.

150
00:11:31,929 --> 00:11:33,500
He used to work here before, right?

151
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,370
No. Why do you ask?

152
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:38,240
Do you want me to find him?

153
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,340
Pay the deposit,
and give us two days...

154
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:42,740
Find him now.

155
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:47,179
I'll give you a minute to find
everything about Seo Jin Hwan.

156
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:50,379
Who is this guy?

157
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,779
Who do you think you are to...

158
00:11:55,649 --> 00:11:57,250
It's Yong Chul's testimony.

159
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:01,960
I heard Yu Jin...

160
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:07,629
was holding her hands tight.

161
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:10,700
It must have been so painful...

162
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,840
that they tried to spread
her fingers,

163
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:18,179
but they said they couldn't.

164
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:21,950
When I got up,

165
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,620
Yu Jin was...

166
00:12:29,789 --> 00:12:32,559
Can you come to the center please?

167
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:35,029
It looks like Se Hyung has
something to say.

168
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,600
Moong Chi, is everything okay?

169
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:46,799
Lately, I can't sleep,
and I keep having bad thoughts.

170
00:12:47,769 --> 00:12:49,710
Since when did that happen?

171
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:54,039
I think it started
about a month ago.

172
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:55,110
I have to run.

173
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:57,210
Help me.

174
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,289
We beat Unhappiness.

175
00:13:01,389 --> 00:13:02,850
Goodbye.

176
00:13:03,019 --> 00:13:05,159
(Dolls Like Me)

177
00:13:20,669 --> 00:13:23,070
Is this why you rushed
every Saturday?

178
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:24,879
It was not a date?

179
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:29,080
Yes. I usually counsel victims.

180
00:13:29,549 --> 00:13:31,750
Sometimes I do this.

181
00:13:33,649 --> 00:13:37,049
I thought you have something
to tell me, Se Hyung.

182
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:39,389
Mint candy.

183
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,230
Mint candy?

184
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:48,970
He smelled like mint candy.

185
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:04,750
It's raining so much.

186
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,700
You sped again.

187
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,399
You're not a car racer.

188
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:24,539
You didn't see me speeding.
You were sleeping the whole time.

189
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,700
I didn't violate any...

190
00:14:56,299 --> 00:15:00,299
Gyeonggi Province, Sungnam,
Eunjang-gu, 15 Dajung street.

191
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,539
There's no matching address
on GOPros.

192
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:07,340
Wait. That address...

193
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,350
That's near Jin Hwan's
Seo Young studio.

194
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:18,990
He damaged the site
even worse than before.

195
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:22,190
This time, he left the pendant...

196
00:15:22,789 --> 00:15:24,129
and took the ring.

197
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,740
It's Jin Hwan.

198
00:15:34,669 --> 00:15:36,309
Jin Hwan's photo studio...

199
00:15:37,509 --> 00:15:38,740
is near here.

200
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:22,250
Team Manager Kang.

201
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:31,529
I think Jin Hwan was here
the whole time.

202
00:16:32,899 --> 00:16:35,570
Why are there photos of Yong Chul?

203
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,340
He wasn't keeping him alive.

204
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:41,440
He was looking for a chance
to kill him.

205
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:51,350
What was that?

206
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:02,960
I'm sure the Reaper...

207
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:05,900
will try to make up for his mistake.

208
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:08,769
Yong Chul is in danger.

209
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:18,380
(Restricted number)

210
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,180
Hello?

211
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:35,130
How did you come here so fast?

212
00:17:35,259 --> 00:17:38,299
Actually, I was staying near here
since last night.

213
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,769
Eat up.

214
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:16,670
(Suspect Profile,
Seo Jin Hwan, 37 years old)

215
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:20,170
Okay, I got him.

216
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:21,569
He's Seo Jin Hwan.

217
00:18:28,849 --> 00:18:30,750
Stop. Stop!

218
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:31,750
Go!

219
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:50,500
Mister, mister! Hey!

220
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:52,470
- Stop!
- Stop!

221
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:02,349
- Gosh.
- Stop right there!

222
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:03,609
- Stop!
- Stop!

223
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,680
- Stop!
- Grab him!

224
00:19:33,779 --> 00:19:36,809
Is Seo Jin Hwan the real culprit of
the Northwestern Serial Murder case?

225
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:39,119
Is it true that there are more
unknown victims?

226
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:41,019
How will you investigate this case?

227
00:19:41,019 --> 00:19:42,349
A word please.

228
00:19:42,589 --> 00:19:43,950
The NCI has...

229
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:46,789
found a suspect that
fits the profile of the culprit...

230
00:19:46,789 --> 00:19:49,730
of the Northwestern Serial Murder
case.

231
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:53,099
After a chase, the police has
arrested the culprit of...

232
00:19:53,099 --> 00:19:55,430
the Northwestern Serial
Murder case...

233
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:58,170
that drove people into fear
near his house.

234
00:19:58,170 --> 00:19:59,200
That man...

235
00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:03,269
is the culprit who was arrested
for his copycat crime.

236
00:20:06,809 --> 00:20:07,980
It's been seven years.

237
00:20:08,579 --> 00:20:11,109
What do you think I have done
these last seven years?

238
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:15,619
Are you sure that he is the Reaper?

239
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:17,589
For now.

240
00:20:18,089 --> 00:20:20,190
He matches 90 percent of the
circumstances around the incident.

241
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:23,259
It there is 10 percent of truth
that does not match,

242
00:20:24,029 --> 00:20:25,200
what will you do?

243
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:26,730
What?

244
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,240
What are your parents like?

245
00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:38,910
You would have been brought up
in a good family,

246
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:42,309
who loved you
and treated you preciously.

247
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:46,549
By normal standards, I would agree.

248
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:49,549
Normal standards?

249
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:55,430
I was nine when my house
caught fire and my parents died.

250
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:57,359
People...

251
00:20:57,829 --> 00:20:59,029
treated me...

252
00:20:59,029 --> 00:21:01,500
like the most unfortunate person
in the world.

253
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,640
In fact,

254
00:21:06,069 --> 00:21:08,640
I was the happiest then.

255
00:21:11,579 --> 00:21:14,079
My dad used to beat me up
after he drank.

256
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:16,480
My mom used to get beaten up...

257
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,480
while trying to stop him
from hitting me.

258
00:21:21,019 --> 00:21:23,589
I had to watch all of that happen
while hiding in the corner.

259
00:21:24,789 --> 00:21:26,759
Every day, I felt like
I was in an abyss.

260
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:32,029
Yu Jin is very similar to my mother.

261
00:21:33,029 --> 00:21:34,900
That's why I wanted to marry her
as soon as possible.

262
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:38,240
You made me unfortunate,

263
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,440
but I am happy.

264
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,710
I thought that was...

265
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:47,079
the best revenge on my parents
who had made me like this.

266
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:56,119
You can't ever escape the abyss
once you are there.

267
00:21:57,019 --> 00:21:58,359
That's just the end.

268
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:08,799
Hyun Joon.

269
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,400
This was from Seo Jin Hwan's drawer.

270
00:22:12,869 --> 00:22:14,299
We took basic examinations.

271
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,210
What is this?
Is this genie's magic lamp?

272
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:28,420
I'll have a look.

273
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:51,839
I killed them all.

274
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:55,549
It was me from the start.

275
00:22:57,950 --> 00:22:58,980
Are you...

276
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,990
the real Reaper?

277
00:23:02,819 --> 00:23:03,950
I remember everything.

278
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:06,720
I committed my first murder...

279
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:10,559
on March 25, 2002, in Noeul Park.

280
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,329
A couple went into the forest.

281
00:23:15,829 --> 00:23:17,400
But they won't come out.

282
00:23:44,059 --> 00:23:45,200
The public telephone.

283
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,369
There was a public telephone.

284
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:51,539
I called the police.

285
00:23:53,369 --> 00:23:55,470
I committed murder again.

286
00:23:57,910 --> 00:23:58,910
Once,

287
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,509
twice,

288
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:03,210
three times.

289
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:06,180
If I keep doing it,

290
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:08,490
I'll get used to it, right?

291
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:26,269
- What's wrong?
- It's not him.

292
00:24:28,099 --> 00:24:29,640
We have finger prints,
forensic examination,

293
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:32,380
pictures, and he knows about
all the incidents...

294
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:33,809
and has the matching
physical conditions.

295
00:24:34,279 --> 00:24:36,410
And we even have his confession.

296
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:38,049
What more do you need?

297
00:24:38,109 --> 00:24:40,480
He was talking about
the third murder.

298
00:24:40,849 --> 00:24:43,519
The Reaper started to report
his murder on public phones...

299
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:45,019
since his fourth murder.

300
00:24:49,789 --> 00:24:51,630
Are you saying
that he's telling a lie?

301
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,599
He lowers his head,

302
00:24:54,599 --> 00:24:55,829
bites his lips,

303
00:24:55,829 --> 00:24:57,529
and scratches his hands.

304
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:00,200
These are signs of anxiety.

305
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:03,369
He looks afraid as if
he's being chased by something.

306
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:06,779
What would make him afraid?

307
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:08,450
The Reaper was after...

308
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:10,980
your family.

309
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:29,630
Where are they now?

310
00:25:33,339 --> 00:25:35,269
I don't know.

311
00:25:35,509 --> 00:25:36,640
I don't...

312
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:43,210
Look at this and tell me.

313
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:45,720
Did the Reaper threaten you?

314
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,950
I...

315
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:50,150
It was the Reaper. The Reaper...

316
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:52,059
must have threatened his family.

317
00:25:54,859 --> 00:25:57,359
He... He has my family.

318
00:25:57,359 --> 00:25:59,460
He has my family.

319
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,700
He has my son. My son.

320
00:26:02,099 --> 00:26:04,769
Please, I beg you. I'm sorry.

321
00:26:04,769 --> 00:26:07,440
Save them. My son, my son...

322
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,509
Team Manager Kang,

323
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:12,210
I don't know what went wrong...

324
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,539
What is it?

325
00:26:15,579 --> 00:26:17,609
I think we've been hacked.

326
00:26:19,779 --> 00:26:20,779
What?

327
00:26:25,019 --> 00:26:26,559
Tell me what happened.

328
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:28,220
The attack wasn't from outside.

329
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:30,859
Someone must have hacked into
our program internally.

330
00:26:32,099 --> 00:26:33,099
The flash drive.

331
00:26:33,829 --> 00:26:35,670
The evidence we brought
from Jin Hwan's.

332
00:26:36,269 --> 00:26:38,740
Reaper gave Jin Hwan the flash drive
on purpose.

333
00:26:45,579 --> 00:26:46,609
Give me a second.

334
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:51,279
This is steganography.

335
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,319
It's a cipher technique...

336
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:55,720
that plants confidential
information...

337
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,750
by encrypting it in an image
or mp3 file.

338
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:59,460
The moment you click on it,
it accesses the computer and hacks.

339
00:27:01,259 --> 00:27:04,329
The Reaper came up with all this to
break in to the protection program.

340
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:07,029
Let's try the vaccine program.

341
00:27:07,029 --> 00:27:08,059
I'm already trying it.

342
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:13,799
Luckily, he didn't get into
the protection program yet.

343
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:17,410
But if it's already planted, it's
a matter of time until he breaks in.

344
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:20,039
The Reaper knew this all along.

345
00:27:20,779 --> 00:27:22,380
That's why he used Jin Hwan
as a trap.

346
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:24,710
We're missing something.

347
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:27,220
I'm sure.

348
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:31,920
What if he's been watching us
all along?

349
00:27:32,759 --> 00:27:35,490
Pardon? What do you mean?

350
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:38,089
Wait.

351
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:40,529
Se Hyung said something last time.

352
00:27:41,259 --> 00:27:45,140
I thought you have something
to tell me, Se Hyung.

353
00:27:45,799 --> 00:27:47,039
Mint candy.

354
00:27:48,339 --> 00:27:49,339
Mint candy?

355
00:27:49,339 --> 00:27:52,339
He smelled like mint candy.

356
00:27:58,420 --> 00:27:59,579
I heard...

357
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:02,490
Yu Jin was...

358
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:05,460
holding her hands tight.

359
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,190
It must have been so painful...

360
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:10,160
It must have been so painful...

361
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:13,730
that they tried to spread
her fingers,

362
00:28:15,799 --> 00:28:18,230
but they said they couldn't.

363
00:28:18,599 --> 00:28:20,339
They said they couldn't.

364
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:23,910
but they said they couldn't.

365
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,980
How did Yong Chul...

366
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:32,119
know Yu Jin's fingers were broken?

367
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,349
By that time,

368
00:28:34,779 --> 00:28:37,920
Yong Chul was already stabbed
by the Reaper so many times.

369
00:28:43,329 --> 00:28:45,200
Even if he was conscious,

370
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,529
there's no way he would realize...

371
00:28:47,529 --> 00:28:50,099
her fingers are broken, but why...

372
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:52,839
did Yong Chul say that?

373
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:56,869
As if he did that.

374
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:28,609
Now I know...

375
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:31,440
why he killed couples...

376
00:29:32,109 --> 00:29:33,680
and said those things.

377
00:29:34,109 --> 00:29:35,880
You made me unfortunate,

378
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:37,680
but I'm happy.

379
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:41,049
I thought this would be
the best way to take revenge...

380
00:29:41,579 --> 00:29:44,490
on my parents who had
made me like this.

381
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:51,960
Aren't you curious about
how I look?

382
00:29:57,299 --> 00:30:00,099
Can you really capture the Reaper?

383
00:30:00,269 --> 00:30:04,839
What if there's a 10 percent truth
that doesn't match?

384
00:30:05,539 --> 00:30:06,740
What are you going to do then?

385
00:30:08,809 --> 00:30:11,849
You can't ever escape the abyss
once you are there.

386
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:14,079
That's just the end.

387
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:20,420
Yong Chul...

388
00:30:23,859 --> 00:30:25,230
is the Reaper.

389
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:31,369
My goodness.

390
00:30:38,009 --> 00:30:39,210
What do you think, Ki Hyung?

391
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,750
Are you surprised now?

392
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:45,619
This is getting fun now.

393
00:30:48,019 --> 00:30:49,420
Too bad for you.

394
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:53,589
If this video is playing,
it means...

395
00:30:55,359 --> 00:30:57,230
you're caught in a trap.

396
00:31:05,299 --> 00:31:06,970
Do you see these people?

397
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:09,769
Their lives...

398
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:12,940
are up to you.

399
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,680
What do you say?

400
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,250
Will you come to rescue them?

401
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:26,259
Are you still confident
that you won't regret?

402
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:31,059
Move. Didn't you see
he was playing with me?

403
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:32,529
It's me whom he wants.

404
00:31:32,859 --> 00:31:35,299
He's testing me over my family.

405
00:31:35,299 --> 00:31:37,599
No. That's his trap.

406
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:38,670
Can't you see?

407
00:31:38,839 --> 00:31:42,140
Team Manager Kang. This video
was recorded 12 hours ago.

408
00:31:50,009 --> 00:31:51,180
He will make you...

409
00:31:51,809 --> 00:31:54,980
lose both your family and belief.

410
00:32:15,509 --> 00:32:19,109
Yong Chul keeps getting rid of
ways for me to track him down.

411
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:22,750
He's shockingly fast.

412
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:25,480
Stop.

413
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:32,259
Please look after my family.

414
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:34,289
I'll treat them
as if they're my family.

415
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:42,430
This is Kang Ki Hyung. I think the
Reaper is tracking your location.

416
00:32:42,769 --> 00:32:44,200
He has his eyes on you.

417
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,799
I must know where you are right now.

418
00:32:46,369 --> 00:32:48,000
Call me as soon as
you hear this message.

419
00:32:51,069 --> 00:32:52,309
I got the location.

420
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,940
I'll send it to you right away.

421
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:33,349
Call the ambulance. Ambulance.

422
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:36,720
- Team Manager Kang.
- We have an injured.

423
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,750
We need an ambulance immediately.

424
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:39,759
An ambulance will be here soon.
Please stay with me.

425
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:42,690
I'm sorry, Team Manager Kang.

426
00:33:46,059 --> 00:33:48,630
Are Hae Won and Han Byul safe?

427
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:06,819
Yong Chul knows Hae Won's number.

428
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:09,320
What is Hae Won's number?

429
00:34:09,389 --> 00:34:12,420
Team Manager Kang.
I didn't tell him.

430
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:14,960
I didn't tell him.

431
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:17,630
It'd be faster for you...

432
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:20,360
to kill me than to make me say it.

433
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,130
You won't be able to...

434
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:27,639
get away from this pain so fast.

435
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:32,710
You must stay alive,

436
00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:35,139
so that you can tell Ki Hyung.

437
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:37,349
His family...

438
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:00,170
Team Manager Kang.

439
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,909
I'm right here. I'm beside you.

440
00:35:02,909 --> 00:35:04,170
I have...

441
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:06,940
something to say to you.

442
00:35:09,449 --> 00:35:13,750
You probably didn't save the
numbers under the NCI name.

443
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:16,250
Who knows?

444
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:21,719
It might be a speed dial
to make it easy.

445
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:29,199
Hello? Seo Hae Won?

446
00:35:30,969 --> 00:35:33,170
Sorry. Wrong number.

447
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,710
Hello? Seo Hae Won?

448
00:35:37,239 --> 00:35:38,440
- Seo Hae Won...
- Yes. That's me.

449
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:42,380
Oh, it's you.

450
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:43,610
Don't answer.

451
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:45,480
That's not me.

452
00:35:50,519 --> 00:35:52,119
Sorry for frightening you.

453
00:35:52,659 --> 00:35:55,690
I'm Jang Jin Won
from NCI's Special Security Team.

454
00:35:56,159 --> 00:35:57,630
There's been a problem.

455
00:35:58,159 --> 00:36:00,099
The special agent
who had been protecting you...

456
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,059
got murdered.

457
00:36:02,329 --> 00:36:03,369
What?

458
00:36:03,699 --> 00:36:05,539
What are you talking about?

459
00:36:06,699 --> 00:36:07,940
Also, Ms. Seo.

460
00:36:10,139 --> 00:36:12,809
I don't know how to tell you this,

461
00:36:14,409 --> 00:36:16,710
but Team Manager Kang...

462
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:19,150
was also murdered.

463
00:36:27,619 --> 00:36:30,989
After this call ends,
do not call anyone.

464
00:36:31,559 --> 00:36:33,960
And you must throw away the phone
you are using right now.

465
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,199
It might have been tapped.

466
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:37,730
Do whatever you can to
find another phone,

467
00:36:38,099 --> 00:36:39,340
and call me.

468
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:41,440
Wait, please. Is Ki Hyung really...

469
00:36:44,269 --> 00:36:45,710
Are you really sure?

470
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,849
I'm ashamed I have to tell you this.

471
00:36:51,079 --> 00:36:52,179
I'm so sorry.

472
00:36:53,449 --> 00:36:54,679
I'm sorry.

473
00:36:57,349 --> 00:36:58,650
See you again.

474
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,289
Ms. Seo's heading...

475
00:37:02,889 --> 00:37:04,630
towards the Reaper.

476
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:07,900
Please hang in there.

477
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:11,199
Team Manager Kang,
I'm sorry.

478
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:13,840
I'm really...

479
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:22,280
We can't track Ms. Seo's phone.
What do we do?

480
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,949
We'll find a way somehow.

481
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,320
We're connected.

482
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,690
Kim Yong Chul called Hae Won...

483
00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:31,289
using an agent's phone.

484
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:32,960
He told her that I'm dead,

485
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,360
and that she's in danger.

486
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,530
We'll trace the phone right away.

487
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:38,960
Did you receive any calls
from Ms. Seo?

488
00:37:39,159 --> 00:37:41,800
No, Kim Yong Chul told Hae Won
to abandon her phone,

489
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:44,530
and to call him with another phone.

490
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,539
Team Manager Kang,
where are you?

491
00:37:46,539 --> 00:37:47,739
I'll go to you right now.

492
00:37:47,739 --> 00:37:50,139
Hae Won might call me.

493
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:51,639
Team Manager Kang,

494
00:37:52,039 --> 00:37:53,440
please come to the office first.

495
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,010
Hae Won would at least try
to confirm it.

496
00:37:56,309 --> 00:37:58,110
How can she believe that I'm dead?

497
00:37:58,110 --> 00:37:59,980
You have to remain calm.

498
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:02,519
She would believe Kim Yong Chul
in the current situation.

499
00:38:03,219 --> 00:38:05,119
He's always been a step ahead.

500
00:38:05,789 --> 00:38:07,559
He could have found out...

501
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:10,260
where Ms. Seo is already.

502
00:38:11,829 --> 00:38:14,300
Do you have any idea...

503
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:15,559
on where he could be?

504
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:16,670
I found it!

505
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:20,840
Kim Yong Chul is busily going
around high rise buildings.

506
00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:22,099
Where is that?

507
00:38:22,269 --> 00:38:23,369
He's still in Seoul.

508
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:25,570
Captain, I'm sending you
the coordinates right now.

509
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:31,710
Team Manager Kang.

510
00:38:32,579 --> 00:38:33,579
Team Manager Kang.

511
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:36,449
Did he just hang up?
What is this sound?

512
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:38,719
It's Team Manager Kang.

513
00:38:39,519 --> 00:38:41,219
He's calling Kim Yong Chul.

514
00:38:42,329 --> 00:38:44,289
(NCI Team Manager Kang Ki Hyung)

515
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:48,829
It's been a long time,
Kang Ki Hyung.

516
00:38:49,699 --> 00:38:50,900
Tell me where you are.

517
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,400
Oh, you're mad?

518
00:38:56,409 --> 00:38:57,639
Don't worry.

519
00:38:58,039 --> 00:38:59,980
I'll treat them...

520
00:39:00,039 --> 00:39:02,510
very carefully.

521
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:05,849
Why? Is that too boring?

522
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:08,780
Hello?

523
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:15,730
Your silence is scaring me.

524
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:17,690
As far as I know,

525
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:20,429
Kang Ki Hyung never despairs.

526
00:39:21,099 --> 00:39:22,130
Am I wrong?

527
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:24,230
I never despair just like you said.

528
00:39:24,329 --> 00:39:25,329
Do you know why?

529
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:28,739
Because you're much more
predictable than you think.

530
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:37,750
Right. There you go.

531
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:40,949
That sounds more like the
Kang Ki Hyung I know.

532
00:39:40,949 --> 00:39:43,119
You don't actually know
where Hae Won is.

533
00:39:43,219 --> 00:39:44,849
That's why you're making
her find you.

534
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:48,260
Oh no, this is very disappointing.

535
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:50,960
Do I seem that lazy to you?

536
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:53,530
You're just putting on a show
to prove...

537
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:55,000
you can overpower me.

538
00:39:55,969 --> 00:39:58,630
You're saying I'm just a nobody
putting on a dumb show?

539
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:00,400
Kim Yong Chul.

540
00:40:00,969 --> 00:40:03,670
Your mother tried to
protect you from your father.

541
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:05,369
But she couldn't.

542
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:08,210
That's why you hated her.
Isn't that true?

543
00:40:09,579 --> 00:40:10,949
After your mother died,

544
00:40:10,949 --> 00:40:13,750
you started seeing all women...

545
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:15,989
as weaklings.

546
00:40:15,989 --> 00:40:17,619
That's what you think!

547
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:22,389
I think differently.

548
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:24,989
When was it that you
lit your house on fire,

549
00:40:25,659 --> 00:40:27,699
and killed your parents?

550
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,030
Were you nine years old then?

551
00:40:32,699 --> 00:40:34,900
That was just an accident.

552
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:36,809
I bet that incident...

553
00:40:37,139 --> 00:40:39,739
was unbearable for you.

554
00:40:40,539 --> 00:40:43,309
Who wrote that story for you?

555
00:40:43,949 --> 00:40:46,019
It's not that interesting.

556
00:40:46,119 --> 00:40:47,420
It's pretty boring actually.

557
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,320
Kim Yong Chul.

558
00:40:50,389 --> 00:40:51,820
You're not simply...

559
00:40:52,289 --> 00:40:54,460
a famous serial killer to me.

560
00:40:55,989 --> 00:40:57,530
You're the Reaper.

561
00:40:58,389 --> 00:40:59,760
I can promise you this.

562
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:03,070
We will study you.

563
00:41:03,469 --> 00:41:05,329
We will not ignore you.

564
00:41:07,539 --> 00:41:09,409
Why are you pretending
to be so weak?

565
00:41:09,869 --> 00:41:11,369
This is only the beginning.

566
00:41:18,949 --> 00:41:20,480
Please, Kim Yong Chul.

567
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:23,750
Think again.

568
00:41:24,789 --> 00:41:25,960
How about it?

569
00:41:27,219 --> 00:41:28,559
Do you get it now?

570
00:41:29,789 --> 00:41:33,699
Are you slowly realizing
what true fear is?

571
00:41:35,699 --> 00:41:38,030
You've never actually
lived a proper life.

572
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:41,340
People you love, a home,

573
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:44,809
happy laughter...

574
00:41:46,039 --> 00:41:47,510
That's why...

575
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:50,949
I want to take those things
from you.

576
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,250
Why? Can't I?

577
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:02,489
Wait, who is this?

578
00:42:05,289 --> 00:42:07,500
Hae Won has such a nice smile.

579
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:11,900
I'm sure she smells nice too.

580
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:15,300
But where is the cute boy?

581
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:25,079
I've found him.

582
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:29,389
Wait, wait.

583
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:32,420
Yes, Ms. Seo.

584
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:34,889
I'm here and waiting.

585
00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:37,230
No, Ms. Seo.

586
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,500
Just leave the door open.

587
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:40,829
I'll go in right now.

588
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,929
Okay, I will.

589
00:42:45,699 --> 00:42:46,940
Kang Ki Hyung,

590
00:42:48,139 --> 00:42:49,670
I'm very sorry about this.

591
00:42:49,769 --> 00:42:52,539
I think I have to get going.

592
00:42:53,110 --> 00:42:56,079
Your beautiful wife...

593
00:42:58,010 --> 00:42:59,820
is waiting for me.

594
00:43:11,559 --> 00:43:13,300
Where do you think the Reaper...

595
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:14,630
will take Ms. Seo and Han Byul?

596
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:17,769
The Reaper is the type that always
has to control his opponent.

597
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:21,969
That's why he made Ms. Seo
go to him.

598
00:43:22,139 --> 00:43:24,440
He wants to showcase his power
to Team Manager Kang.

599
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:25,809
He'll probably take them...

600
00:43:26,409 --> 00:43:29,650
to the place that will emotionally
affect Team Manager Kang the most.

601
00:43:31,079 --> 00:43:34,420
The place that will emotionally
affect Team Manager Kang the most...

602
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:36,489
Wait.

603
00:43:37,719 --> 00:43:39,519
What did Kim Yong Chul
say on the phone earlier?

604
00:43:40,559 --> 00:43:41,559
The door.

605
00:43:42,159 --> 00:43:43,630
He told her to keep the door open.

606
00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:45,130
The house.

607
00:43:45,659 --> 00:43:46,860
Team Manager Kang's house.

608
00:43:48,030 --> 00:43:49,130
The Reaper...

609
00:43:50,730 --> 00:43:53,639
wants to take everything Team
Manager Kang has.

610
00:43:58,440 --> 00:43:59,440
Team Manager Kang.

611
00:44:02,809 --> 00:44:03,909
Yes?

612
00:44:04,309 --> 00:44:06,750
The Reaper is heading to your home.

613
00:44:08,719 --> 00:44:09,820
I know.

614
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:12,190
Team Manager Kang.

615
00:44:12,989 --> 00:44:14,590
The Reaper is calling you.

616
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:18,630
(Agent Kim Sang Soo)

617
00:44:22,659 --> 00:44:23,670
Ki Hyung,

618
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:25,969
are you okay?

619
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Of course.

620
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:29,670
I'm fine.

621
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,280
But why...

622
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:36,480
did the new agent say...

623
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:46,559
Ki Hyung.

624
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:48,360
Hae Won,

625
00:44:49,730 --> 00:44:52,860
Kim Yong Chul is listening to our
phone call, right?

626
00:44:53,199 --> 00:44:54,199
Yes.

627
00:44:55,630 --> 00:44:56,730
I'm sorry.

628
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:59,170
I just trusted him.

629
00:44:59,570 --> 00:45:00,599
Hae Won,

630
00:45:01,469 --> 00:45:02,769
I know it's going to be heard,

631
00:45:04,409 --> 00:45:05,769
but don't let him see...

632
00:45:07,409 --> 00:45:09,210
you being weak or scared.

633
00:45:10,679 --> 00:45:11,780
Okay.

634
00:45:12,010 --> 00:45:13,320
Don't be scared, Hae Won.

635
00:45:14,179 --> 00:45:15,650
Did Kang Ki Hyung...

636
00:45:16,190 --> 00:45:18,550
tell you about the deal
he made with me?

637
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:21,219
The deal?

638
00:45:21,789 --> 00:45:22,889
Don't listen to him, Hae Won.

639
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,389
He's only trying to make you mad.

640
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:28,360
So you should have told her instead!

641
00:45:29,530 --> 00:45:32,400
Oh, I'm sorry.

642
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:36,510
Because of your arrogant ego,

643
00:45:37,239 --> 00:45:40,110
your beautiful Hae Won
will die soon,

644
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:42,980
along with your little boy.

645
00:45:44,349 --> 00:45:46,280
What is he saying?

646
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:47,420
Ignore him.

647
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:49,320
Ignore him, Hae Won.
Don't listen to him.

648
00:45:49,849 --> 00:45:51,119
I trust you.

649
00:45:51,949 --> 00:45:53,219
I'll trust you.

650
00:45:55,690 --> 00:45:56,690
Hae Won,

651
00:46:00,530 --> 00:46:01,829
Han Byul is next to you, right?

652
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,030
Tell him this.

653
00:46:04,570 --> 00:46:06,369
I really need...

654
00:46:07,369 --> 00:46:09,469
Han Byul's help in investigating
this case.

655
00:46:10,510 --> 00:46:12,670
Han Byul, did you hear that?

656
00:46:13,210 --> 00:46:15,710
Come here.
You have to say hello to your dad.

657
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:20,980
Hi, dad.

658
00:46:26,090 --> 00:46:27,320
Hi, Han Byul.

659
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:28,989
Dad.

660
00:46:29,489 --> 00:46:31,789
Is your friend a bad person?

661
00:46:36,170 --> 00:46:38,699
Yes, Han Byul.

662
00:46:40,739 --> 00:46:41,800
Listen.

663
00:46:42,969 --> 00:46:46,010
You're going to solve a case...

664
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:48,710
with me.

665
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:52,849
I really need your help.

666
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:56,949
Do you understand what I'm saying?

667
00:46:57,250 --> 00:46:59,619
Yes, don't worry dad.

668
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:01,920
Han Byul.

669
00:47:03,190 --> 00:47:04,389
Can you hug...

670
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:08,630
your mother...

671
00:47:10,829 --> 00:47:13,070
for me?

672
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:29,889
You know...

673
00:47:31,650 --> 00:47:34,159
how much I love you, right?

674
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:38,889
Mom.

675
00:47:49,239 --> 00:47:50,909
Han Byul, start.

676
00:47:51,570 --> 00:47:54,340
Tick tock, tick tock.

677
00:47:55,780 --> 00:47:58,010
Mom, I need to go now.

678
00:47:58,179 --> 00:48:00,650
I'm investigating a case with Dad.

679
00:48:11,929 --> 00:48:13,500
He's so cute.

680
00:48:15,929 --> 00:48:19,329
I'll be good,
Detective Kang Han Byul.

681
00:48:23,469 --> 00:48:25,570
Honey, Ki Hyung.

682
00:48:26,739 --> 00:48:28,110
Are you coming for me?

683
00:48:29,139 --> 00:48:30,980
I'm so scared, Ki Hyung.

684
00:48:39,590 --> 00:48:40,690
Hae Won,

685
00:48:42,059 --> 00:48:43,289
I'm so sorry.

686
00:48:43,789 --> 00:48:46,659
You don't need to apologize.

687
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:51,170
I was so happy with you.
That's more than enough for me.

688
00:48:52,329 --> 00:48:53,670
Han Byul would think so too.

689
00:48:54,039 --> 00:48:57,369
You don't need to feel sorry for me.

690
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:05,480
Honey,

691
00:49:06,619 --> 00:49:07,619
I...

692
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:10,889
I want to see you one last time.

693
00:49:11,789 --> 00:49:12,949
But I probably won't.

694
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:18,360
So please tell Han Byul...

695
00:49:19,630 --> 00:49:21,730
that I didn't leave him alone.

696
00:49:24,230 --> 00:49:25,329
Promise me.

697
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,369
Promise me.

698
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:30,039
I promise, Hae Won.

699
00:49:30,510 --> 00:49:31,769
I promise.

700
00:51:10,409 --> 00:51:11,570
Gosh.

701
00:51:52,010 --> 00:51:53,550
I will kill you...

702
00:51:54,219 --> 00:51:57,690
and find your little son.

703
00:51:59,050 --> 00:52:01,159
I will show him his dead parents...

704
00:52:01,789 --> 00:52:03,090
and tell him...

705
00:52:04,130 --> 00:52:06,760
that it's all his fault.

706
00:52:08,059 --> 00:52:09,400
And then...

707
00:52:38,389 --> 00:52:39,530
Die.

708
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:44,500
Die.

709
00:52:45,829 --> 00:52:46,900
Die.

710
00:52:48,239 --> 00:52:49,300
Team Manager Kang.

711
00:52:51,139 --> 00:52:53,880
If you become swayed by
people who don't deserve to live,

712
00:52:54,639 --> 00:52:56,380
we become the same person.

713
00:53:15,059 --> 00:53:16,329
Shoot me.

714
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:19,130
Shoot me.

715
00:53:43,389 --> 00:53:44,789
What were you doing there?

716
00:53:45,030 --> 00:53:47,429
I was investigating a case like you.

717
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:48,730
I'm a police officer.

718
00:53:48,829 --> 00:53:52,699
Kang Han Byul, thank you
for investigating the case with me.

719
00:53:53,269 --> 00:53:55,670
I will always need your help.

720
00:54:24,929 --> 00:54:26,900
I was investigating the case...

721
00:54:27,369 --> 00:54:29,900
just like you told me to.

722
00:54:31,739 --> 00:54:32,739
Well done.

723
00:54:35,039 --> 00:54:36,780
Well done, Kang Han Byul.

724
00:54:37,610 --> 00:54:38,809
Well done.

725
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:58,599
Han Byul, are you all right?

726
00:55:51,389 --> 00:55:52,920
Hae Won.

727
00:55:53,659 --> 00:55:54,719
Hae Won.

728
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:59,030
Hae Won.

729
00:55:59,590 --> 00:56:01,300
Hae Won.

730
00:56:30,489 --> 00:56:32,929
"I think that if the devil
does not exist,"

731
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:34,800
"but man has created him,"

732
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:37,670
"he has created him in his own
image and likeness.”

733
00:56:38,769 --> 00:56:40,070
Fyodor Dostoyevsky.

734
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:48,400
How are you going to survive
without me?

735
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,429
You can't even wear your tie
by yourself.

736
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:27,599
I'll be back.

737
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:43,849
You're good.

738
00:59:43,849 --> 00:59:45,750
I think Han Byul is better.

739
00:59:50,059 --> 00:59:52,429
This time, I'll put it here.

740
00:59:53,730 --> 00:59:54,730
Like this.

741
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:57,400
Breaking news.

742
00:59:57,400 --> 01:00:00,500
The culprit of the Seoul
Northwestern Serial Murder case,

743
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:03,369
Kim Yong Chul,
escaped from prison...

744
01:00:03,369 --> 01:00:06,309
at 1am this morning,
15 days after his arrest.

745
01:00:06,639 --> 01:00:08,780
He is said to have escaped
while he was urgently being...

746
01:00:08,780 --> 01:00:12,309
transferred to the hospital after
he had attempted suicide.

747
01:00:38,210 --> 01:00:39,210
(Criminal Minds Korea)

748
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:42,309
Sometimes, it creates variants that
are more vulnerable to infection.

749
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:44,210
It's a typical biological weapon.

750
01:00:45,210 --> 01:00:47,519
Even inhaling it can result in
a fatality rate of 95 percent.

751
01:00:48,019 --> 01:00:49,849
Would the culprit feel excited...

752
01:00:49,849 --> 01:00:51,289
while watching the victims die?

753
01:00:51,420 --> 01:00:53,420
He might know the reason why.

754
01:00:54,159 --> 01:00:55,820
We can't rule out the possibility...

755
01:00:55,820 --> 01:00:57,760
that a foreign terrorist group
was involved.

756
01:00:57,929 --> 01:00:59,389
I won't let...

757
01:00:59,989 --> 01:01:02,000
my team member die
in front of me again.

758
01:01:02,300 --> 01:01:03,659
We don't have much time left.

759
01:01:03,659 --> 01:01:05,329
The world is going to change now.

760
01:01:06,769 --> 01:01:08,599
We must not let him get away.
