I'm concerned that our fourth uncle might feel alone,

00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,380
so I'd like you and Ren to go over there.

I understand that.

15

Why didn't you tell me the truth?

16
00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:33,180
The truth was too hurtful to be told.

17
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,500
If you had told me earlier

18

What I owed him before

26
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,660
must be paid in the rest of my life.

With Zhousheng Chen.

177
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,260
Then we went abroad

178
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:51,210
and stopped going there that often.

179
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,230
You like ancient literature, don't you?

180
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:55,870
Then you should've been born in our family.

181
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,760
Not many of your siblings

182
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:58,940
are into that.

183
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:01,230
You're right.

184
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:02,840
The other day you sent us

185
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:04,160
the tune names for choosing your wife...

186
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:06,600
I was doing it for fun.

187
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:08,890
By the way,

188
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:10,090
is it time to take your medicine?

189
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:13,190
Come.

190
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,160
Shi Yi, see you.

191
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:16,780
Bye.

192
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:35,850
Watch your mouth next time.

193
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,800
Not everything

194
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,090
can be joked about.

195
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,420
I felt something was wrong

196
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:42,980
as soon as I said it.

197
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:44,730
Sorry.

198
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:49,580
I'm almost there.

199
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,040
I'll walk you to the yard.

200
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:53,670
No need. It's close enough.

201
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,020
What?

202
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:56,520
Are you mad at me?

203
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:58,780
No.

204
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:00,980
If you're seen by my mom and grandma,

205
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:02,660
you'll have to listen to their nagging again.

206
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:04,170
I want you to use the time

207
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,750
to go back and rest.

208
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:08,170
You work until one or two in the morning every day.

209
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:09,680
How can you ignore your health?

210
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:14,250
Enough.

211
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:17,510
Let's go.

212
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:09,980
You're back.

213
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,180
Sleep with me for a while.

214
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,380
I haven't washed up yet.

215
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,220
The lights are on.

216
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:28,220
Are they asleep?

217
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:30,180
Keep it down.

218
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:31,940
They would be awakened by you.

219
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:32,420
Well,

220
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:32,940
I mean

221
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:33,820
if he is still up,

222
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:34,740
you should go up and ask

223
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:35,260
whether they'll have breakfast

224
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:36,100
together

225
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,020
or separately.

226
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:37,700
I'm not going.

227
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,780
What if they are sleeping?

228
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:41,460
Are people sleeping with lights on?

229
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:42,700
Of course.

230
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,260
You can see the shadows.

231
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:49,020
It's not my fault.

232
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:49,940
Really.

233
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:52,420
You are too loud.

234
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:53,540
Go and fetch me some cherries.

235
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:54,700
I'm not going.

236
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:55,620
It's too late.

237
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:56,700
Cherries picked in the sun

238
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:58,020
are not tasty.

239
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:00,820
We have a curfew

240
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:01,760
in this month.

241
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:02,940
We are not allowed to go out at midnight.

242
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:05,460
Then go and get me some lotus roots.

243
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:06,860
Tomorrow

244
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:08,470
I'll make Sweet Lotus Root with Sticky Rice

245
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,740
for Shi Yi.

246
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,180
Lotus roots.

247
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:13,580
By the water.

248
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:15,620
No way.

249
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:18,190
It's too dangerous to go near the water at night.

250
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:19,530
I'll go by myself then.

251
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:21,900
Forget it,

252
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:23,060
I'm coming with you.

253
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:07,020
Zhousheng Chen?

254
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:12,890
He didn't wake me up again.

255
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,020
You are up.

256
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,820
He turned off my alarm.

257
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,020
Did you finish breakfast already?

258
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,180
The old lady said

259
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:26,620
your daily schedule

260
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:27,500
could be different from ours,

261
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:28,900
so she told us not to wake you up.

262
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:30,900
Try this.

263
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:33,060
I've been waiting for it for months

264
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,340
since it was only a bud.

265
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,540
Finally, we can eat it.

266
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:36,660
For months?

267
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:39,620
Right.

268
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:41,180
The buds come out at the end of May.

269
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:42,340
The flowers bloom between July and August.

270
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,340
In September, the flowers wither and the roots take shape.

271
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,180
Did you raise lotuses before?

272
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,820
I raised some

273
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,060
when I learned how to paint them.

274
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:52,020
I kept painting them from the germination of their seeds at the end of April

275
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,260
to the end of their flowering season.

276
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:54,300
And I picked it up again next year

277
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,140
after the winter.

278
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,020
That lasted for years.

279
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:59,100
No wonder you are so good at it.

280
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:00,900
You are very patient.

281
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:02,940
It's tasty.

282
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:04,380
Really?

283
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,619
My great-uncle also likes my cooking.

284
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,180
I don't usually cook for people,

285
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:09,420
not even for the lady,

286
00:17:09,619 --> 00:17:10,980
not even if they beg me.

287
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:12,780
And every year,

288
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,140
I always hide

289
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:14,900
the lotuses I like

290
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:16,220
from other people.

291
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,609
Teach me.

292
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,140
Can you cook?

293
00:17:20,089 --> 00:17:21,130
I'm passionate about cooking.

294
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,260
We share the same hobby.

295
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,220
You can be my confidant.

296
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,220
I'll teach you

297
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,640
after the Ghost Festival.

298
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:30,200
It's the Ghost Festival today.

299
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,220
Are there any family events?

300
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:32,740
Yes. To release lanterns on the water.

301
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,060
On the water?

302
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:35,820
I only watched it once

303
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,180
when people released some on land,

304
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:38,460
but never on water.

305
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,220
Then come back here every year.

306
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:41,340
We do it every year.

307
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,620
In my previous Ghost Festivals,

308
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,260
if we worked very late,

309
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:47,780
we would just tell each other

310
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,020
to go home earlier

311
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:49,900
and not to stay out late,

312
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,260
since it was the Ghost Festival.

313
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:52,460
It's fine.

314
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:53,700
Lin Fei and I will go with you.

315
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:54,260
Don't worry.

316
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:55,460
Finish your meal.

317
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:56,340
I'll do some cleaning.

318
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:19,980
What are you looking for?

319
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,580
Something practical.

320
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:24,820
Practical?

321
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:26,930
I don't think

322
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:27,940
there is anything practical here.

323
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,540
We only have things that are too precious

324
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,660
to be taken out.

325
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,460
I saw it when I was ten.

326
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,190
It should be here.

327
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:49,690
You have a good memory.

328
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:55,740
Why are you putting it back?

329
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,100
I just need to know it's here.

330
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:00,860
It's the Ghost Festival.

331
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,340
Not a good day to give gifts.

332
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:04,500
I thought you never

333
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,420
believed these things.

334
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,140
It's about her.

335
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,340
I'd rather be too cautious

336
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:10,580
than sorry.

337
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:34,500
Figure divination?

338
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,260
I saw it before

339
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,300
in a script.

340
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,100
So I want to look for more information.

341
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,460
Are these books

342
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:44,100
from the right end of

343
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:45,580
the third row of the tenth shelf on the second floor?

344
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:46,820
You read it before?

345
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,540
Ren did.

346
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:49,300
After he finished,

347
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,380
I helped him put them back.

348
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:52,860
Why would Ren be interested in these?

349
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:56,180
We spent one Spring Festival in the ancestral temple.

350
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:57,580
Our fourth great-uncle told Ren

351
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:58,580
a story

352
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:01,140
about figure divination.

353
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:02,420
What's that story?

354
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:05,620
There was an ambitious general

355
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:06,700
living in the Northern Dynasties.

356
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,100
After a palace coup

357
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,380
where he saved the crown prince's life,

358
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:10,860
he came up with an idea of taking his place

359
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:12,620
and being the emperor himself.

360
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:15,460
To convince all the ministers and people in the country,

361
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:16,740
he followed ancient rules

362
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:17,720
and asked craftsmen

363
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,100
to make dozens of molds for him

364
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:21,740
to build gilded bronze figures in public.

365
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:23,700
But he

366
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,100
failed every time

367
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,220
and all the molds were ruined.

368
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:29,730
He got downhearted

369
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:30,930
and asked the crown prince to give it a try.

370
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,310
But unexpectedly,

371
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:34,130
the crown prince succeeded on his first attempt.

372
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,510
He realized that it should be God's will.

373
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:37,710
Thus, he dropped his delusional idea

374
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,960
and supported the crown prince's enthronement.

375
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:41,460
Through this story, our fourth great-uncle wanted to

376
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,500
let Ren understand

377
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:43,250
that everyone

378
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:44,540
has their own fate

379
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:45,580
and should never expect things that don't belong to them.

380
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,120
Ren didn't buy it

381
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:48,350
and came to ask me.

382
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,640
What did you say?

383
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:52,380
I said

384
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:54,840
the craftsmen might have made

385
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,250
two different kinds of metal molds.

386
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,370
Some had a higher melting point than bronze,

387
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,670
and the others had a lower one.

388
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:01,370
As long as they wanted,

389
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,900
they could always

390
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:04,200
get in the way of the general.

391
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,350
Right.

392
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,900
Ancient people might have no idea of melting points.

393
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:09,380
But the craftsmen dealt with

394
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:10,540
metallic materials all the time.

395
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:11,730
They must have known the difference.

396
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:14,660
By the way,

397
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:16,320
Lian Sui told me

398
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,500
grandma wanted to go home.

399
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,470
I can

400
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:19,320
send her home together with you.

401
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:22,090
Aren't you going to release lanterns with

402
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:23,060
Wenxing tonight?

403
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:24,540
I'll send grandma home.

404
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:26,230
Sure.

405
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:28,120
Come back before dark.

406
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,000
It's a special day.

407
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,140
OK.

408
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:54,590
Grandma.

409
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:56,980
Shi Yi told me

410
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:59,460
to go back before dark today.

411
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,030
So I can't be with you

412
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:02,040
tonight.

413
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:03,310
All right.

414
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:05,380
I'm an old woman.

415
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,430
I don't need you here with me.

416
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,530
Go and be with your wife.

417
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:13,300
That's the most important matter.

418
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:17,320
Here. Be careful, grandma.

419
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,260
Chen.

420
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,900
I'm afraid that grandma might find out

421
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:31,060
about Wenxing's condition.

422
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:33,220
If she asks about it,

423
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:34,900
please help me stall her off.

424
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:38,500
Mr. Mei and I

425
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:39,780
are going to see the doctor now.

426
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,930
Come as soon as you can.

427
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:43,260
OK.

428
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,340
Thank you.

429
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:51,080
We're all family.

430
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:52,400
What's more,

431
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:54,020
Wenxing grew up in my house,

432
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:55,500
and I know that doctor

433
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:56,660
better than you do.

434
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:58,500
Just go.

435
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,620
Alright. Bye.

436
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,420
Mom, I have other things to do.

437
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:02,900
OK.

438
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:05,580
Be safe.

439
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:33,260
Be careful.

440
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:35,260
You are back.

441
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:37,180
-Here.
-Alright.

442
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:38,940
Grandma hasn't eaten yet.

443
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:40,020
Cook for her.

444
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:40,660
OK.

445
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:44,340
I was thinking

446
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:48,010
that Wan would not let me leave this time.

447
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,900
But she agreed

448
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,140
so fast and easily.

449
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,940
What's going on in the family?

450
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:00,980
Nothing, grandma.

451
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:05,280
I don't believe her.

452
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:07,820
I only believe you.

453
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:09,950
You never lie to me.

454
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,020
Go.

455
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,860
Your wife is waiting for you at home.

456
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:19,820
OK, grandma.

457
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:21,460
I'll come back in two days.

458
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:23,060
OK.

459
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:26,860
You said two days.

460
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:29,400
Don't be late.

461
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,820
I promise. Two days.

462
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:31,770
Deal.

463
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:33,680
OK. Go.

464
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:34,350
Bye, grandma.

465
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:34,820
Go.

466
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:49,460
Why must I let her

467
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:51,700
stay in the mountains to recuperate?

468
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:55,140
It's too humid here.

469
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:57,700
It's all my fault.

470
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:05,380
Doctor Lin,

471
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,620
how is Wenxing's condition?

472
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:12,660
Her condition

473
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:14,700
is even worse than I thought.

474
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:18,300
Before you came,

475
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:20,460
we were talking about the treatment.

476
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:23,260
Doctor Lin suggests a heart transplant operation.

477
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:25,100
He wishes

478
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:26,900
Wenxing can stay in the country for further treatment,

479
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:29,300
so that it'll be easier to

480
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:30,980
find a suitable heart donor.

481
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:04,220
I know you feel bad for Wenxing.

482
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:06,410
We've worked it out over the years,

483
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:09,480
and we can surely work it out again this time.

484
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:49,380
Mr. Wang,

485
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:50,540
stop here, please.

486
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:51,460
All right.

487
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:17,860
Ancestors,

488
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:20,620
if you are watching this,

489
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:21,780
please bless

490
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,380
my older brothers and sisters-in-law

491
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:24,700
with a smooth life,

492
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,740
including Mei Xing.

493
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:42,300
When I was a kid, my mom told me

494
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:45,420
we should release lanterns on the water during the Ghost Festival,

495
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:48,020
so that the ancestors could see us

496
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:49,060
and bless

497
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:51,020
all the generations of Zhou family

498
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:52,420
with a happy and healthy life.

499
00:27:58,840 --> 00:27:59,630
In the future,

500
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,100
I will also bless you.

501
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:12,540
People die.

502
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:15,660
Shi Yi,

503
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:18,020
if,

504
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:20,340
I mean if

505
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,980
I am gone one day,

506
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:27,140
you and Chen

507
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:29,300
don't have to come back to see me every year.

508
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:32,460
I would be satisfied as long as you think about me.

509
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:33,700
Touch wood.

510
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:35,500
Knock on the wood to withdraw those unlucky words.

511
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:36,660
Come on.

512
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:43,500
Silly kid.

513
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:45,100
There are so many people who love you

514
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,220
and stay by your side.

515
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:47,540
Even for them,

516
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:49,260
you should live on and live well.

517
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:50,980
Never say those

518
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:51,700
bad words again.

519
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:01,260
Here.

520
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:02,900
I don't feel cold, Shi Yi.

521
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:06,420
Why are your hands so cold?

522
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:08,300
I've always been like this.

523
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:09,460
In winter,

524
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:11,020
I dare not touch others' hands,

525
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:12,620
for I'm afraid they would feel cold too.

526
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:14,900
The wind is too strong here.

527
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:15,900
Let's go back.

528
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:17,060
Sure.

529
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:17,980
Here.

530
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:20,740
Sir, we are going back.

531
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:21,740
All right.

532
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,100
Shi Yi.

533
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:25,340
I...

534
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:26,100
Shi Yi.

535
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:26,540
What...

536
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:28,100
Sir, help her!

537
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:29,900
I can't swim.

538
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:31,140
Shi Yi.

539
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:32,020
Shi Yi.

540
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:32,620
I...

541
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:33,500
Shi Yi...

542
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:38,980
Wenxing.

543
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:40,380
Wenxing.

544
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:41,700
Come back up.

545
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:43,460
You can't take this.

546
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:46,740
Wenxing, come on up now.

547
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:47,180
Right.

548
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:47,900
-Wenxing.
-Why did she fall into the water?

549
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,380
-Wenxing.
-Get some help now.

550
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:50,060
Come up now.

551
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:53,180
Your body can't take this.

552
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:00,420
Something bad happened.

553
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:02,660
What's wrong, Uncle Lin?

554
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:03,620
Shi Yi.

555
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:05,580
Shi Yi fell into the water.

556
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:06,220
What?

557
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,380
What happened?

558
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:22,100
[Family of Books and Rituals]

559
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:13,580
Do you know why?

560
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:15,740
Who else was on the boat?

561
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:17,740
Only Wenxing and a boatman.

562
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:23,100
Mr. Mei,

563
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:25,580
Wenxing is having a high fever.

564
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,420
I took the liberty of coming to you.

565
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:28,820
They told us to keep quiet about it.

566
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:37,740
Don't tell Zhousheng Chen for the moment.

567
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:35,940
"The Bones of the Beauty"

568
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:38,140
is a legendary story

569
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:39,660
in ancient times.

570
00:33:43,650 --> 00:33:45,500
It's about the Junior Prince of Nanchen whose meritorious military service was illustrious,

571
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,800
and an aristocratic girl.

572
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:50,820
That girl's name

573
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:52,930
was also Shi Yi.

574
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:23,060
The ending of the story

575
00:34:23,179 --> 00:34:24,300
is too cruel.

576
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:27,980
Until they died,

577
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:32,500
the "Fu on the Imperial Park" on the wall of the royal mansion

578
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:34,340
was still unfinished.

579
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:39,460
Why didn't they talk about it

580
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:40,860
before they left each other?

581
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:43,179
Neither of them finished the prose.

582
00:34:55,949 --> 00:34:58,610
That may be the beauty of regret.

583
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,820
Perhaps they were both hoping

584
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,140
that one day

585
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:13,420
they could finish it.

586
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:41,420
Uncle Lin,

587
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:42,780
why don't you go up and talk to him?

588
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:44,660
He hasn't eaten all day.

589
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:56,620
It would be strange if he could

590
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:58,900
eat anything now.

591
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:46,420
Haven't you eaten?

592
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:50,740
Shi Yi hasn't eaten either.

593
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:58,260
Being married

594
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:00,940
means you have one more family member.

595
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:03,700
If you live on your own,

596
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:06,580
you'll experience aging, sickness and death

597
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:07,740
only once.

598
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:09,580
But for married people,

599
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:10,940
they have to experience all this of

600
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:12,260
their beloved as well.

601
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:17,020
More challenges await on the road.

602
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:18,780
You can't just stop eating and drinking

603
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,500
when things get tough.

604
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:28,980
The meal is cold.

605
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:31,660
I'll warm it up for you.

606
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:34,380
Uncle Lin,

607
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:35,900
just leave it here.

608
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:37,140
I'll have it later.

609
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:42,820
Zhousheng Chen.

610
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:52,620
Shi Yi.

611
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:55,780
Shi Yi.

612
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,050
Shi Yi.

613
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:08,980
Can you hear me?

614
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:19,060
You are awake.

615
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:24,140
How are you

616
00:40:24,350 --> 00:40:25,420
feeling now?

617
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:32,180
I'll get the doctor.

618
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:57,340
What are you doing down here?

619
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:58,380
Is she awake?

620
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:01,740
Bring some light food for her.

621
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:03,260
It's already done.

622
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:04,340
I'll go and get it.
