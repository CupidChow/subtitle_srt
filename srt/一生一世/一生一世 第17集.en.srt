Wait.

00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:52,259
What's wrong?

6
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:54,120
Let's get down to business first.

00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:03,100
Get into bed.

8
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:05,500
Now?

Yeah, come on.

10
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,580
It's still not dark enough, but we'll make do.

11
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:14,580
Come on, into bed!

12
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:17,860
Are you sure?

13
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,620
At this time of day?

14
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:20,780
I'm sure.

15
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:21,579
Hurry up.

Close your eyes.

18
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:41,940
Why should I close my eyes?

19
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:42,940
Close them.

20
00:02:48,579 --> 00:02:49,900
Don't open them.

21
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,579
Okay, open them.

22
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,940
Surprise! Welcome to your new home.

Thank you.

24
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:14,670
Just a thank you?

25
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:15,700
So stingy.

26
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:18,740
I don't mean to be.

27
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,340
It's nice. Very nice.

28

I work later than you.

29
00:03:25,579 --> 00:03:26,420
If you're home alone

and afraid of the dark,

31
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,340
just leave this on.

32
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,940
I bought the night light specifically for you.

33
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,750
Did I say I'm afraid of the dark?

34
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,190
Can't you just pretend?

35
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:39,340
I'm so afraid of the dark.

36
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,579
Look at you!

37
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:44,460
You even need your wife to teach you how to coax her.

38
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:48,340
This is your own star map.

39

Do you like it?

40
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:55,860
I do.

41
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:57,660
If you like it,

42
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:58,620
I can buy all the different patterns

43
00:03:58,620 --> 00:03:59,540
for you.

44
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:01,180
I'll buy whatever you like.

45
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,100
If you don't like them,

46
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,220
I'll just buy and keep them for now.

47
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,580
Because even if you don't like it now,

48
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:06,840
you might change your mind later, right?

49
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,720
No, I can't look at you any longer.

50
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:20,589
I'm afraid I'll get the wrong idea in the daytime.

Where are you going?

52

I'm going to buy a wiring board.

53
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,820
You only felt touched for a few seconds?

54

It's not that.

55

and take a good look when I get back.

58

You bought so much stuff.

I just stopped to look around several times.

And an old lady

talked to me for more than 20 minutes.

She's had a hard time,

I go back to the same place every day.

I know you're concerned about him.

131
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,560
I tormented him a lot when I was young.

132
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:09,280
Now that I've grown up, I should make up for it

133

That's right.

138
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:26,380
I lived in his house during the two years of my surgery.

139
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:28,260
I didn't feel comfortable when I first got there.

140
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,260
I cried every day,

141
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:32,180
through the morning and the afternoon.

142
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,580
I even cried at night.

143
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:37,340
I couldn't stand it now that I think about it.

144
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:40,940
But he never

145
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,700
ever lost his temper with me.

146
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,750
Every day, he was just like,

147
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:45,820
Zhou Wenxing,

148
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,750
I'll scold you if you cry again.

149
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:52,340
He said it every day, bluffing.

150
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,470
But he didn't really mean that.

151
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:00,180
It's the first night of living together.

152
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,420
What's the big feast?

153
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:03,660
Noodles with scallion oil,

154
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,900
mixed jellyfish, smashed cucumbers

155
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,560
with tomatoes in white sugar.

156
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,580
That's all you had?

157
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,500
There's nothing to eat at home.

158
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,160
He was in a hurry for a meeting.

159
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:15,180
He went into his study after dinner

160
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,510
and hasn't come out yet.

161
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:17,520
He's really

162
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:19,780
a mediocre chemistry professor.

163
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:23,040
What a mediocre first night of living together.

164
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:28,080
He's come out. I'm hanging up.

165
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,540
What are you looking for?

166
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,460
I'm looking for drinking water.

167
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,420
Hot or cold?

168
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:37,620
Both are fine.

169
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:39,260
Cold water is in the fridge.

170
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,900
Hot water and room temperature water are here.

171
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,900
How about some room temperature water?

172
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:43,340
Okay.

173
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,660

00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:44,630
ask the kitchen for it yourself.

344
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:45,040
Okay.

345
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:46,190
Bye-bye.

346
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:47,180
Bye-bye.

347
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:04,460
A little red

348
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:05,370
Two-leaf green

349
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,960
[A little bit of red, Two rhythms.
Triangle Grass, Four Seasons.
Five Lianzi, Six harmonies]

350
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,350
Triangle grass.

351
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:07,360
Four Seasons.

352
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:08,500
[Seven-leaf lily. Eight-horned maple. Nine flowers. Ten dusts. Hundred Herb Cream, Thousand Day Red]

353
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,400
Five Lianzi.

354
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:09,410
Six harmonies.

355
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:10,490
Seven-leaf lily.

356
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:11,610
Eight-horned Maple.

357
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:12,550
Nine flowers.

358
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:13,640
Ten dusts.

359
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:14,860
Hundred Herbs Cream.

360
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:15,960
Thousand Day Red.

361
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:18,190
This is the answer given by Shi Yi.

362
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,500
Watching you wash the glass

363
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,980
makes me think it's not glass

364
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:22,340
but crystal.

365
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:23,980
If you have time,

366
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:25,780
can you wash all the cups in the cabinet

367
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:26,900
all over again?

368
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:29,100
No problem.

369
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,180
When I was working in the lab,

370
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,900
most of the work

371
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:34,820
was to wash all kinds of bottles.

372
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,660
Eventually it became a pastime.

373
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,420
When I was happy, I washed them.

374
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:40,220
When I was not, I washed them too.

375
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,060
Can you expand this business

376
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:43,980
to washing clothes?

377
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:45,910
I'll stock them up in one place.

378
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,300
Wash some when you're happy.

379
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,560
Wash some more when you're not happy too.

380
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:50,380
I can try.

381
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,020
No cheating.

382
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,420
By the way, I thought about installing a sterilizer

383
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:57,420
here in a few days.

384
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,200
Whatever you want.

385
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,540
I'll go back to the bedroom then.

386
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,440
What are you doing?

387
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:46,300
Sleeping.

388
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,220
Come in.

389
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,940
I've got your pajamas for you.

390
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:04,980
Do you usually

391
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,420
wear pajamas?

392
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,640
Or do you just wear anything you like?

393
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,660
Pajamas?

394
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:19,150
I'll go inside and get changed.

395
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:42,780
This is my first time

396
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,040
seeing you in pajamas.

397
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:46,260
I'll go to bed now.

398
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:47,710
Where are you going?

399
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:49,790
Come sleep here.

400
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:51,940
Are you used to sleeping on the left side

401
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:52,940
or the right side?

402
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:57,740
Didn't you say...?

403
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:03,220
I can sleep on either side.

404
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:05,080
Then I'll sleep on the right side.

405
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:09,260
Come on.

406
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:14,820
I'm going to turn off the lights.

407
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:26,460
Right.

408
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:27,460
I also bought you

409
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:28,460
some loungewear.

410
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:29,940
They're a style you haven't worn before.

411
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,540
I've put them in your closet.

412
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:33,270
Okay, I'll wear them tomorrow.

413
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:35,320
Good night.

414
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:36,720
Good night.

415
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,760
It looks like it just rained here.

416
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:11,780
It might have.

417
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:13,860
Luckily, I'm not wearing heels.

418
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:18,080
Excuse me, shall we go?

419
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:19,020
Yes.

420
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:20,540
So, are you two having a meal?

421
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:22,000
Or are you just having tea?

422
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,300
We're having a meal.

423
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:24,740
This way, please.

424
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:27,860
Come on.

425
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:30,880
Please take a look at the menu.

426
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:32,940
You two are really lucky.

427
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:34,340
If it wasn't for the customer

428
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:36,220
who cancelled the order the other day,

429
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:38,680
there wouldn't have been boats around here.

430
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:40,860
Can you recommend some dishes?

431
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:41,860
Mostly something filling.

432
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:43,300
We came here with an empty stomach.

433
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,830
It's all filling food here.

434
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:47,060
They're all very good, so feel free to order.

435
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:47,540
Okay.

436
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,020
Hi.

437
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:53,780
You've been here before?

438
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,420
It's my first time too.

439
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:57,460
I asked someone before we left.

440
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:58,820
I see.

441
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,860
You don't look like someone who would enjoy

442
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:02,020
this kind of life.

443
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:06,620
Excuse me.

444
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:08,980
There are two young people over there

445
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:10,620
who want to get on the boat too.

446
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:12,480
But I said the boat was chartered.

447
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:13,860
They want me to

448
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:15,620
discuss with you two.

449
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:16,700
Can you spare that

450
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,660
empty table

451
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:18,780
for them?

452
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:22,940
As long as my wife is okay with it,

453
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:24,300
I have no problem with it.

454
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:25,380
Get them on board.

455
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:26,740
Okay. Thank you.

456
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:27,300
Thank you.

457
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:27,900
Thank you.

458
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:30,060
Well, you two read the menu first.

459
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,500
Call me when you're ready.

460
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:32,310
Okay.

461
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:35,440
What do you want to eat?

462
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:37,670
I'll eat whatever you want.

463
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:40,440
I'll have this one.

464
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:41,500
Okay.

465
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:44,500
One more of this one.

466
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:46,340
I want to eat this.

467
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:47,260
Okay.

468
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:01,860
One dish

469
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:02,780
would be enough for us.

470
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:04,020
We can't finish two dishes.

471
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,100
It's a waste.

472
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:07,260
It's a rare occasion to go out.

473
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,790
It's quite beautiful here.

474
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:12,840
The worst thing would be to live an overly frugal life after we go back.

475
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:19,180
They look like students

476
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:20,620
or recent graduates.

477
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,630
Such a relationship is so rare.

478
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,500
I remember when I first graduated

479
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,820
and went into the studio,

480
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:28,940
there was an intern recording engineer

481
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:30,540
who got along with his little girlfriend like this too.

482
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:32,100
They were very careful with their money.

483
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,300
What to eat every day

484
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:34,140
from Monday to Friday,

485
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,220
they had it all planned out

486
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:35,980
just so they could have something nice

487
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:36,940
on the weekend

488
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:38,060
or go to the surrounding area for a walk

489
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,390
at the end of each month.

490
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:42,060
They worked together to make money

491
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,300
with the same goal.

492
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:44,700
I envy them.

493
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:50,940
I wish I could have

494
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:51,740
met you earlier

495
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:53,140
when you were in college.

496
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:55,660
When I was in college,

497
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:57,780
you were just in junior high school.

498
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:01,200
Show-off. I know you went to school earlier than me.

499
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,580
It's a

500
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:23,620
rabbit.

501
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,860
Have you ever seen a hand puppet show?

502
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:27,140
Grandma taught me some.

503
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:28,140
I'll show you.

504
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:29,900
Sure.

505
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,050
But you have to work with me.

506
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:35,140
Me?

507
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:40,140
I'll try my best.

508
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,740
Guanghan Palace is really cold.

509
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,620
It's about to be mid-autumn.

510
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,780
I don't see any people from outside.

511
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:52,620
I might as well go for a walk with the crowds.

512
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:53,500
It's livelier.

513
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:58,520
This gentleman...

514
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:01,500
Have we met somewhere before?

515
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:09,390
Yes?

516
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,260
What's your name?

517
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:15,500
Zhousheng. Chen as the first name.

518
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:20,940
I've heard of

519
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:22,540
your name before.

520
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:24,940
Where did you hear it?

521
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:27,340
You're well-known.

522
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:29,860
Of course I heard it from some other people.

523
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:32,740
What did they say?

524
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:36,860
Drunk on the Baigu beach.

525
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:38,820
Singing wild.

526
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:41,380
A pot of liquor and a horse.

527
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:44,260
How many people in the world are like this king?

528
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:49,980
These are the lines you dubbed before?

529
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:53,140
I think

530
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:54,480
you'd be a good actress

531
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:55,780
if you planned to act.

532
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:57,820
Dubbing itself is

533
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:58,750
a kind of acting.

534
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,460
I had acting classes before I started my career.

535
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:01,620
The teacher was someone

536
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:04,480
that specifically taught acting in a drama school.

537
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:13,520
It's going to rain.

538
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:24,620
Sorry, Chen.

539
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:26,180
I only have one umbrella here.

540
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:27,100
It's okay.

541
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:27,860
We like

542
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:28,700
the vibe of getting wet.

543
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:29,630
You guys just go.

544
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,250
Okay, we'll go first.

545
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:35,620
Come on.

546
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:43,460
Let's go too.

547
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,500
You put my clothes on.

548
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:53,900
I'll go out first.

549
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:57,160
Come on.

550
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:00,660

Yes.

621
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:52,460
And you?

622
00:34:54,469 --> 00:34:55,179
I do.

623
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:23,780
[Celestial orbital theory]

you like kids?

630
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:51,900
Yes, I do.

631
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:53,820
I've always liked kids.

632
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,500
I was thinking

633
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:57,660
there are no flower girls in Chinese weddings.

634
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,060
If you like kids too,

635
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:00,300
we could do our make-up

636
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:02,230

Open the door. Open the door.

643
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:07,940
There's a leak in your house.

654
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,060

00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:11,260
Why aren't you leaving? You'll be late.

I'll see him out.

658
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:15,620
I'm going to the research center.

Bye.

660
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:23,860
You don't know your way around Shanghai.

661
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:24,900
I won't give you the car key.

662
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:25,900
Is Uncle Lin here?

663
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:27,840
He's in Zhenjiang.

664
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:30,390
Then you can only take a taxi

665
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:31,790
to the research center.

666
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:33,340
Tell me in advance when you get off work.

667
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:34,420
I'll pick you up.

668
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:36,020
I can come back by myself.

669
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:37,860
I'll pick you up and go to my parents' house.

670
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:38,990
They've caught you.

671
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:40,780
Surely, we'll have to explain in person.

672
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:43,020
Do you want me to go explain?

673
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:44,820
Just go first.

674
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:46,100
We haven't matched our statements.

675
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:46,980
I'm afraid if something goes wrong.

676
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:49,040
It's easier for me to solve it myself.

677
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:50,600
Just go.

678
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:53,500
Just go.

679
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:54,980
You better get inside.

680
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:55,510
Bye, bye.

681
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:13,420
Are you going out?

682
00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:15,780
Well.

00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:17,020

00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:24,140
What? Is it inappropriate?

686
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:26,870
Yes, I think it's a little inappropriate.

687
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,430
Is there a shopping center near there?

688
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:31,700
Yes, there is.

689
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:32,860
Turn left in front of you.

690
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:34,900
After you leave the neighborhood, turn left again.

691
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:36,430
There is a shopping center.

692
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:37,140
It takes...?

693
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:38,500
10 minutes by foot too.

694
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:40,500
Thank you.

695
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:41,380
Okay.

696
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:48,060
You really don't know anything.

697
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:49,220
Can't you look it up?

698
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:00,720
Grandpa, please sit down.

699
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:02,420
I'll make you some tea.

700
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:03,220
Save it.

701
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:06,180
Sit.

702
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:15,500
Me and him...

703
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:17,340
Although it's your own business

704
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:19,300
to decide to live together,

705
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:20,780
you have to inform your parents

706
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:21,900
of it in advance.

707
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:24,380
The most important thing is

708
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:25,420
their family

709
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:27,380
won't even meet with us till now.

710
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:28,540
Think about

711
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:31,020
how your parents feel.

712
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:34,500
Grandpa, you've wasted the tea.

713
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:36,060
Can't you say something good

714
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,020
for Chen?

715
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:39,540
He gave you

716
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:40,820
several teapots before, right?

717
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:42,180
The ones inscribed by famous masters.

718
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:43,980
And the stuff he gave you later,

719
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:45,420
brushes and ink.

720
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:46,780
You forgot who sent them

721
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:48,340
after putting them in the cabinet.

722
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:51,580
Their love is true.

723
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:52,980
But the parents tried to stop it.

724
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:54,620
Their parents are not understanding.

725
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:55,700
You are not either?

726
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:57,990
All right. I will say nothing about it.

727
00:41:58,540 --> 00:41:59,540
That's right.

728
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:01,460
Our Yuan is right.

729
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:02,590
She makes sense.

730
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:06,030
Grandpa.

731
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:07,100
Look at Chen.

732
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:08,260
How poor he is.

733
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:09,500
He was so scared by you

734
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:10,620
that he didn't even dare to say a word

735
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:11,820
before running away.

736
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:13,360
We didn't say anything

737
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:14,820
before he ran away.

738
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:16,340
Besides, well...

739
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:17,940
Grandpa, come here.

740
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:18,780
I just saw

741
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:19,940
there's a crab.

742
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:20,980
Guess

743
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:22,580
what the crab's name is?

744
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:23,630
What's its name?

745
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:24,740
What is it called?

746
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:27,320
Sodium chloride and monosodium glutamate.

747
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:29,340
What?

748
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:37,880
Okay, turn around.

749
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:44,190
Why have you lost weight again?

750
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:46,360
Are you on a diet lately?

751
00:42:46,810 --> 00:42:47,390
No.

752
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:48,780
Do you even weigh

753
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:51,180
as much as a junior high school student now?

754
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:52,720
Why don't you eat more,

755
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:54,400
take better care of your body?

756
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,300
I look forward to your coming

757
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:56,300
to talk with me

758
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:58,030
every time the season changes.

759
00:42:58,060 --> 00:42:58,980
But now you're here,

760
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:00,260
I'm afraid that you two siblings

761
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:02,300
would criticize me together.

762
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:07,660
I want to order some suits.

763
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:09,980
My eldest brother

764
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:11,260
has the best command of my family's suit-making skills.

765
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:12,980
But he's a slow maker.

766
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:14,420
You must order them

767
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:16,260
for an important friend.

768
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:19,420
His apprentice is not qualified yet.

769
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:22,190
Why don't you say anything?

770
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:25,670
Didn't you say everything I had to say?

771
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:28,860
Who is it for?

772
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:32,580
You don't have to know.

773
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:34,900
Write down what size you need and show me.

774
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:36,100
I'll measure for you.

775
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:40,180
I make eye-measurements.

776
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:42,820
Either you bring the person here,

777
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:44,060
or find a time and

778
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:45,750
I'll come to him.

779
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:48,140
No exceptions?

780
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:49,300
No exceptions.

781
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:50,740
My apprentice can make an exception.

782
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:51,340
I can't.

783
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:55,220
He's not lying to you.

784
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:57,140
Our family started with suits.

785
00:43:57,340 --> 00:43:58,670
They're all hand-made.

786
00:43:58,780 --> 00:43:59,500
Regular clients

787
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:00,940
have to register their information

788
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:03,180
just in case someone tries to cheat

789
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:04,540
or take the suits from our family

790
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:05,740
to learn the craft.

791
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:08,620
Forget it.

792
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:11,780
He's not that particular about it anyway.

793
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:12,740
I just can't think of

794
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:14,460
what to give him for his birthday.
