[Episode 13]

4
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,520
Xiaoyu bought herself a furnished apartment,

5
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,880
she's going to move out at the end of this month.

6
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,000
If you come back,

7
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,479
I'll sort out her room

8
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,930
and turn it into a study.

9
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,200
The bedroom remains what it was.

10
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,840
We just finished decorating that house,

11
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,960
I suggest we move in

12
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,340
after a years' airing.

13
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,480
It's okay for daily activities, but not for sleeping,

14
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,340
that would be bad for your health.

15
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,840
Good news is I've got a ready-made house

16
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,840
for you to live in.

17
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,640
Hello, are you still there?

18
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,600
I'm here.

19
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,700
Then why didn't you say anything?

20
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,760
I was just

21
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,040
overwhelmed all of a sudden.

22
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,560
What did I say?

23
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:35,520
You were talking about

24
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,300
us moving in together.

25
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,400
Shouldn't we talk about that?

26
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,930
It's not that we shouldn't.

27
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,040
I was just picturing it.

28
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,480
Don't take what I said

29
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,480
the wrong way.

30
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:49,910
What I meant was that

31
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:51,220
I was picturing

32
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,020
us living together.

33
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:55,740
I didn't take it the wrong way,

34
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,540
no need to explain for yourself.

35
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,260
Next week, I will attend

36
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:05,260
an International Space conference.

37
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:07,060
If you are interested,

38
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,440
you can come in advance

39
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,460
and we can go back to Shanghai together

40
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:11,860
once the conference is over.

41
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,820
You finished your job there?

42
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:16,300
Completely.

43
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:17,540
Wait, let me check my visa

44
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:18,740
and my work schedule.

45
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:30,540
My Schengen visa is still valid.

46
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:34,220
Along with two days on weekend,

47
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,740
that makes four days off.

48
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:38,950
As long as I can make it to Shanghai during the day.

49
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,660
Okay, I got it.

50
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,820
I will book the ticket for you later.

51
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,260
Good night, in Germany.

52
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:50,360
Good night.

53
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,980
Zhousheng Chen, open the door.

54
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:21,709
Zhousheng Chen.

55
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:27,790
What's going on?

56
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:29,780
Here, here, here.

57
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:30,980
Move, move.

58
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:35,260
Do me a favor.

59
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:38,220
She's drunk.

60
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,230
Zhousheng Chen.

61
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,820
I don't know which hotel

62
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,140
her husband's staying in.

63
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,740
So I had to send her here.

64
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,100
This is...

65
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:48,580
She's married.

66
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,700
It's not appropriate to send her to a hotel.

67
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:53,300
If it's not okay to send her

68
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,220
to a hotel

69
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:55,500
why would you take her to my place?

70
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,700
Then tell me what should I do?

71
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,900
You're not going to throw her on the streets, are you?

72
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,760
What if she ran into some bad guys?

73
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,860
All right, all right, all right.

74
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,180
You may keep her here.

75
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,180
But you need to stay here as well.

76
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:07,900
Got it.

77
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,470
Move her into this room.

78
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:12,500
Easy, easy.

79
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:14,300
Frank.

80
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,500
Why did you take her into my room?

81
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,100
Thank you.

82
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:02,820
If you had a quarrel with Wenchuan

83
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:05,160
and didn't want him to come to pick you up,

84
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,200
I can call someone else

85
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:08,580
to take you back at dawn.

86
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,030
No need for that.

87
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,180
I am more familiar with Bremen than you.

88
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:16,340
Okay.

89
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,020
I have always wanted to apologize

90
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,340
for your engagement.

91
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,380
I didn't expect that accident

92
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,180
would ruin your plan.

93
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:31,340
It's okay.

94
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:47,600
I am going to divorce with Zhou Wenchuan.

95
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:52,940
We both acted on impulse

96
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,020
and none of us thought it through,

97
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,540
which turned into a drama.

98
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,500
I am afraid my parents won't stand for this,

99
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,660
not to mention your mother,

100
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,340
who is so sensitive about her reputation.

101
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,220
We decided to sign an agreement first,

102
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,340
and after a year,

103
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,720
we will make it public with an excuse.

104
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:21,380
Why would you rush into marriage?

105
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,340
I didn't rush into it.

106
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,180
I was just doing what I wanted

107
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,020
when it's appropriate.

108
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:38,060
I could understand if you did this

109
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,380
in order to go home

110
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,060
and take back what's yours from your second uncle.

111
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,860
But this reason you just said,

112
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,100
I don't buy it.

113
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:47,860
I don't like to talk with others

114
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,460
about my private affairs.

115
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:51,740
The sun has yet to rise,

116
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,070
you can go back to sleep.

117
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:53,980
In a while,

118
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,200
when Frank gets up,

119
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:57,150
I'll ask him to get your breakfast.

120
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,780
You have always

121
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,350
been very careful about marriage,

122
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,760
thinking it over a lot.

123
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:15,660
You also said

124
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:18,460
you didn't have any expectations for marriage.

125
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,900
If you ever get married,

126
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,140
you get married for your family.

127
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,680
What a surprise it was, this time.

128
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:33,100
Maybe this is the difference

129
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:35,100
between business and pleasure.

130
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,140
Do you have any other problems?

131
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,140
If not,

132
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:43,659
I will go back to work.

133
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:22,870
Come and join us.

134
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:24,420
No, thanks.

135
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,950
Thank you for bringing me here.

136
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:27,910
You're welcome.

137
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:33,700
I have to go now.

138
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:35,540
Chen.

139
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,740
When did you arrive?

140
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,430
I have been waiting for 23 minutes.

141
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:48,940
I am famished

142
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,060
after staying outside for too long.

143
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:50,620
Would you mind me joining you

144
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:51,540
for breakfast?

145
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:53,580
Not at all.

146
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,900
You haven't seen Chen for a long time,

147
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,430
why not stay for breakfast?

148
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:07,240
You guys enjoy.

149
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,020
I have an appointment with my supervisor.

150
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,060
I will get a cab for you.

151
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:10,860
No, it's okay.

152
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,740
I can't believe you are just flying off.

153
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,020
Even though you are

154
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,680
legitimate husband and wife.

155
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:04,140
You have to apply some pressure

156
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,100
between you and him.

157
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,870
You are simply being too soft with him.

158
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,780
How am I being soft?

159
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,220
When my mother used to take her team for competitions,

160
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,580
as long as my father was available,

161
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:15,980
he would follow her to have fun together.

162
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:18,220
That way, they saved on hotel money while being able to travel around.

163
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,980
How long have your mom and dad been together?

164
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,660
They have already been married so long

165
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:22,660
they could tell what's on each other's mind

166
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:24,020
at a glance.

167
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,900
You guys are different.

168
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:28,580
You just got married and

169
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,070
barely know each other.

170
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:31,300
At this moment,

171
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,540
you could use

172
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,630
some cleverly applied pressure..

173
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,420
What kind of pressure?

174
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,380
If only I had a boyfriend,

175
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:41,140
so that

176
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:43,660
I could demonstrate that for you every day.

177
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,310
For example, this time.

178
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,340
You could've said.

179
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:48,020
"I'm busy, I haven't got time."

180
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,540
And he would start to wonder

181
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:51,470
about what's going on in your head.

182
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,620
Did he make you feel left out

183
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:56,180
so that you refused to go and used an excuse?

184
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,740
Once he starts to self-reflect,

185
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:58,500
we get him.

186
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:01,940
He feels more anxious and nervous than you.

187
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,540
That means he is like losing

188
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,670
the initiative in your relationship.

189
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,740
Whoever takes the initiative in a relationship

190
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:09,940
gains the upper hand.

191
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,540
Xiaoyu.

192
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,940
I met him when I was 26.

193
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:18,680
If I'm lucky enough

194
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,140
to live to 80,

195
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,980
I have only got 54 years left,

196
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,400
less than 20,000 days.

197
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:26,380
You know he is a researcher.

198
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,420
It will be like this when he is on a business trip,

199
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:29,980
being away for several months.

200
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,460
Maybe the time we really spend living together

201
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,860
is less than 10,000 days.

202
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:33,700
Minus the time

203
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,340
I would be busy, overworking

204
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,440
and off on business trips myself.

205
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:38,500
So the days we will get to spend together

206
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,900
are even fewer than that.

207
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,340
That's why,

208
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:45,620
within the limited amount of time I have left to spend with him.

209
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:46,580
I don't have any time

210
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:48,620
to think about using such tricks or applying pressure.

211
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:49,780
I need to seize every single minute

212
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:50,740
to be with him.

213
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,120
Do you understand?

214
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:53,860
All right, all right.

215
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:56,140
Forget it, forget what I said.

216
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:03,020
Don't worry, there won't be any delay.

217
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:05,150
I have calculated the time for you.

218
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,220
Great, I trust you.

219
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:15,860
You are only gonna be there for a few days,

220
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,220
why would you take so many books?

221
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,020
They are not books,

222
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,140
just some materials I printed

223
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:20,740
for me to read on the journey.

224
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,660
The characters Qinghe

225
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,340
indicate the origin of the family.

226
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,200
Qinghe County,

227
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:37,740
which is in today's Shandong Province.

228
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:46,740
[Map]

229
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,620
It is so far.

230
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:03,940
Hello, Sir.

231
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:05,020
Hi.

232
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:05,980
Can you get me

233
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:07,740
a pair of lady's slippers later?

234
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:08,660
Are we expecting any guests?

235
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,460
Do I need to prepare a guest room?

236
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:11,780
No need for that.

237
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:13,200
My wife is coming here.

238
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:14,740
Then I will give the bathroom

239
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,140
a good clean later

240
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,540
and light up some aromatic incense.

241
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:19,500
Which type does your wife prefer?

242
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,780
I am not sure about that.

243
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:25,620
Can you choose one for me

244
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,460
that's least possible to go wrong?

245
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:27,920
Will do.

246
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:30,660
Right,

247
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,620
she particularly loves to go to the temple,

248
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,900
so try to find some incense with a similar fragrance.

249
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:35,900
Okay, got it.

250
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:36,860
Also,

251
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:39,020
get me some extra pillows

252
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,080
that are different

253
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:41,540
in softness and thickness.

254
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:42,300
I don't know what type

255
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,860
would she prefer to sleep with.

256
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:44,320
Will do.

257
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,180
Thank you.

258
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,950
Distance makes the heart grow fonder.

259
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:58,270
Like I expected.

260
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,260
Stop striking a pose.

261
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:00,960
Let's walk.

262
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:04,780
Well, you are the one who's in a hurry,

263
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:05,580
not me.

264
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:07,780
So says you, she's my wife,

265
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:08,740
not your wife.

266
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:09,550
Hurry up.

267
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,300
Let's go

268
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:18,020
to pick up Mr. Zhousheng's wife.

269
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:28,740
[For other directions, please take the elevator to the Service Center]

270
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,380
When did you arrive?

271
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:32,260
Well, about half an hour ago.

272

00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:44,820

♫When all my hopes are dashed♫

276
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,580
I also saw a girl.

00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:48,740
Despite only getting a glimpse,

278

♫How can I remain calm♫

279
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:50,900
her face is almost etched

280
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:51,700
in my mind

281
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,400
in a way I can never forget.

282
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:58,280
♫What if my destiny never fooled me♫

283
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:56,120
If I happened to see her again,

284
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:58,140
maybe I will be like you,

285
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,340
and propose without hesitation.

286
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,020
♫What if the time was more tolerant♫

287

This is my wife, Shi Yi.

This is my college classmate,

295
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:28,300

Mei Rugu.

299
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:37,780
Weathered willow and withered lotus flower, only the plum remains the same.

300
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:39,500
That's a good interpretation.

301
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,900
Nice to meet you, Mr. Mei.

302
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:42,940
Nice to meet you, Miss Shi Yi.

303

I am done.

305
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,460
Enjoy.

306
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,040
Why are you staring at me like that?

307
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:29,900
-Hi.
-Hi.

308
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:32,320
You seem to have lost some weight.

309
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:34,980
Do I?

310
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,140
Your face is slimmer

311
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,380
than I recall.

312
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,390
Have you been eating properly?

313
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:46,420
I've been staying organized

314
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:47,800
and eating regularly.

315
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,030
I don't think I've gotten slimmer.

316
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:52,820
If I were you,

317
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,580
I would answer,

318
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,740
I missed you so much that I gradually lost some weight.

319
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,060
All right, I got it.

320
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:05,260
If the same thing

321
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:06,260
happened next time,

322
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,140
I would say,

323
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,900
I missed you so much

324
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,990
that I gradually lost some weight.

325
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:28,020
Here,

326
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,100
they've got room service,

327
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:29,980
24/7.

328
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:30,780
While I am not around,

329
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:31,860
if you need anything,

330
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,220
you can call reception.

331
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:38,150
You've been living in this place for quite some time?

332
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:39,180
Yeah.

333
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,640
I have been living in this place for ages.

334
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:45,040
Do you live here alone?

335
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:46,740
How's that possible?

336
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:47,940
He can't resist the loneliness.

337
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,470
He lived with someone else.

338
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:53,110
Did you really live with other people?

339
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:57,420
Yeah.

340
00:18:59,420 --> 00:18:59,940
You see.

341
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,870
He even admitted that himself.

342
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:05,620
In the past,

343
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,140
I used to think a lot about

344
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,260
work stuff at night,

345
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:09,780
all of a sudden.

346
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:12,100
That requires talking and analyzing with other people.

347
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:12,780
That's why

348
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:13,980
I shared the apartment

349
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:15,460
with one of my colleagues before.

350
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:16,900
He just moved out.

351
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,540
He's a guy.

352
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,300
You guys don't waste a minute when it comes to your work.

353
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:26,900
I will put your luggage

354
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:27,980
in the room.

355
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:28,820
Okay.

356
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:31,780
Well.

357
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:35,540
A newly married couple who have reunited after a long separation.

358
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:36,980
You must loathe me, the lawyer

359
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,110
getting in your way.

360
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:39,580
But rest assured,

361
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:40,840
I know what I should do.

362
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:43,520
I will leave the moment I finish my business.

363
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:44,640
Please have a seat.

364
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:51,460
It's kind of scary to face a lawyer

365
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:52,790
right off the plane.

366
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:54,900
It's not me who scares you.

367
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,830
The content of the agreement does.

368
00:19:59,020 --> 00:19:59,900
[Supplemental Agreement for Distribution of Property Signature]

369
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,980
[Signature]

370
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,340
This is the supplementary agreement

371
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,340
for the property settlement agreement

372
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,540
between you and him.

373
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:05,340
It is acting as

374
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:07,800
a supplement to your prenuptial agreement.

375
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,060
After you got married,

376
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,460
he inherited all his father's

377
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,740
personal assets

378
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,390
and 90% of the Zhou family's property.

379
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:16,780
It took us two months

380
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:18,580
to almost finish the take-over.

381
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:20,940
Here

382
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,020
are the movable properties and immovable properties

383
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,780
Zhousheng Chen changed their owner's name to you

384
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:27,040
after you got married.

385
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:29,780
Did his father give him

386
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:30,780
all his assets?

387
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:33,260
What about Wenxing and Wenchuan?

388
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:34,430
I don't know.

389
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:37,460
Even if I did, I couldn't tell you either.

390
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:40,060
As a lawyer, I have my professional integrity.

391
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,500
You don't have to manage these.

392
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:47,100
What we are going to sign today is necessary documents.

393
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,610
This is just following the procedure.

394
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:49,670
This is in triplicate.

395
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:51,670
It will be enough for you to read one.

396
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:53,660
I have marked the pages

397
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:54,820
where you need to sign your names

398
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:56,580
[Signature]

399
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,540
with stickers,

400
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:58,550
in case you miss any.

401
00:20:59,300 --> 00:20:59,900
Thank you.

402
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:03,340
I will sign these and hand them to you before you go.

403
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,380
Is that too late?

404
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:11,590
The reason why I laughed is that

405
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,630
you and him are so alike.

406
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:16,060
You try to predict the next step

407
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:17,340
for whatever you do.

408
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:18,940
I haven't asked you when you could get it done,

409
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,270
yet you already told me.

410
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:22,980
I like to work with people who are reliable

411
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,500
and organized.

412
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,630
Of course, I need to be that myself.

413
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:29,380
If my partners

414
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:30,180
were like you,

415
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,470
that would save me a lot of trouble.

416
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:34,880
Take your time.

417
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:01,120
Are you not curious about his courtesy name?

418
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:03,660
What is it?

419
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:05,260
Changfeng.

420
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:08,700
Changfeng?

421
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:13,500
The waves rise as the high wind comes,

422
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:16,280
like the lonely land around a high mountain.

423
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,620
Raging waves pounding the banks,

424
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:22,580
turning and striking at each sharp turn.

425
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:25,070
Sure enough you can say that.

426
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:30,740
In Xi'an...

427
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:34,500
I mean the couple of days when you were in Xi'an,

428
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,360
I was there too.

429
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:37,240
But I didn't get to see you.

430
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,100
I did hear him talking about you.

431
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,300
What did he say?

432
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:44,350
He said there was a very romantic story

433
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:45,820
about how you two met.

434
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:50,940
It was actually pretty awkward.

435
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:02,220
Help me get the message to him

436
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,520
that I won't be waiting for him.

437
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,020
Okay.

438
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,300
Here, thanks.

439
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,350
It was nice meeting you.

440
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:17,980
Likewise.

441
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:20,550
I am his best friend.

442
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:21,620
If you have any difficulty

443
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:22,620
in the future,

444
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:24,420
you can always come to me.

445
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:25,980
Okay.

446
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:28,060
-Bye.
-See you.

447
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:42,140
OCD.

448
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:26,900
I didn't go interrupt you

449
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,630
as I saw you being very focused.

450
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:29,110
Here.

451
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,340
Wedding ring?

452
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:40,420
Shi Yi.

453
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:42,820
I need to tell you

454
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:44,260
one thing.

455
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,860
I took the ring off

456
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,980
when I was washing my hands a couple of days ago.

457
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,700
But something suddenly happened after I had washed my hands,

458
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:52,620
so I went out.

459
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:54,660
By the time I came back,

460
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:56,060
the ring was gone.

461
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:58,300
That's why just now

462
00:26:58,420 --> 00:26:59,780
the ring was sent here.

463
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:01,820
Not the previous one.

464
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:04,300
By which you mean,

465
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:05,880
the first one got lost,

466
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:07,870
and this is already the second one.

467
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,100
Yeah.

468
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,100
Stupid.

469
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:14,660
If you didn't tell me that,

470
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:16,060
I would never have known.

471
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:17,700
Two months of not seeing each other,

472
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:18,300
you are still

473
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:20,700
the researcher who is honest and reliable.

474
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:26,540
It seems that, ever since I could remember,

475
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:28,100
this is the first time

476
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:30,340
I've been called a stupid.

477
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:32,580
So arrogant.

478
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:36,580
What do you think?

479
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:38,240
Do you want to go out for a meal?

480
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,940
Great, we could spend some time together as well.

481
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:42,200
What do you want to eat?

482
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:45,660
Any place you're familiar with.

483
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,860
Somewhere I'm familiar with?

484
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,500
It seems that apart from the apartment

485
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,700
and the laboratory,

486
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:55,120
I am not familiar with anything here.

487
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:57,220
I have been used to that kind of routine,

488
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:59,660
commuting between the apartment and the laboratory.

489
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:00,860
Then we have no choice,

490
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:02,260
I have to show you around.

491
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:04,520
Have you been here?

492
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,220
No, but I've done my homework.

493
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:08,350
Let's go.

494
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:22,900
I have seen pictures of this place

495
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:23,900
on the internet.

496
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:29,300
The documents Mei Xing wanted me to sign

497
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,100
mentioned your

498
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:32,360
Ten Years of Capital Introduction Plan.

499
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:33,910
Are you interested?

500
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,220
My father studied economics.

501
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:37,950
I often heard him talk about it.

502
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:39,620
In fact, those ten years

503
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:40,820
are only phase one.

504
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,580
At present, every country

505
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,540
is intensifying their efforts in scientific research

506
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:47,020
to speed up digitalization

507
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:48,550
and intellectualization.

508
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,460
That's why we can never stop.

509
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:51,720
We must pick up our pace

510
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:53,300
so as to seize the commanding heights

511
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,820
of global manufacturing.

512
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,940
Nevertheless, these efforts require capital.

513
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:59,540
A constant flow of capital.

514
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:01,540
Large enterprises are fine,

515
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:03,060
while small and medium enterprises,

516
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:04,460
like start-ups,

517
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:06,460
might find themselves struggling.

518
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:08,340
That's why I want to help them.

519
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:11,540
This kind of investment,

520
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:13,340
especially in the high-tech field.

521
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:14,820
It's hard to expect short-term return.

522
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:16,940
Will your mother and the seniors at home

523
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:17,860
understand?

524
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,700
The path to being understood

525
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:23,260
is pretty hard indeed.

526
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:27,070
You have my support from now on.

527
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:29,980
Thank you.

528
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:49,780
What kind of flowers do you like?

529
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:51,180
Me?

530
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,230
I want to give you some flowers.

531
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:55,750
You want to give me flowers?

532
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:02,420
I forgot that you are allergic to pollen.

533
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:06,660
Wait a sec.

534
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:16,880
This is for you.

535
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:17,820
Do you like it?

536
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:20,860
Yeah.

537
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:23,820
Good afternoon, Professor Zhousheng.

538
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:26,840
Do you know him?

539
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,140
This is only three minutes

540
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:30,540
away from the institute.

541
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:32,760
Then let's go somewhere else.

542
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:34,300
Why?

543
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,060
Because I am not mentally prepared

544
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,220
to see your colleagues.

545
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,380
Besides, I just got off a long flight.

546
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:39,580
And I don't look good.

547
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,060
You don't?

548
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:44,860
Just go.

549
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:02,660
Are you taking a shower just to go out?

550
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:05,100
I'm not.

551
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:06,660
I spent the whole night in the laboratory

552
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:07,700
and felt kind of dirty.

553
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:10,100
I just want to take a shower and get changed.

554
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:31,980
We are going to stay together tonight.

555
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:51,800
♫Time cannot steal memory♫

556
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:55,170
♫Try my best♫

557

♫To locate your trace♫

♫Spring flowers and autumn moon♫

559
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:06,040
♫I put them deep down in my heart♫

♫To write you a song and a poem♫

561
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,060

♫With tenderness and caution♫

563
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:12,220

♫To rewrite the ending of what happened in our preexistence♫

565
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:18,380
You gotta take a shower later.

566
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:19,530
I will just clean up real quick.

567
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:22,180
♫And resume our story♫

568
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:20,580
It's okay.

569
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:21,900
Are you going out?

570
00:32:22,530 --> 00:32:24,950
♫You show up in my dream,♫

571
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:23,940
There's something going on in the lab.

572
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:24,870
I need to attend a

573
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,180
teleconference which will take a long time.

574
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:29,180
♫Gradually getting clearer♫

575
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:28,940
Are you coming home tonight?

576
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:30,900
I absolutely will.

577
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:33,260
However, it's going to be late as usual.

578
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:36,260
Wait.

579
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:40,620
Your hair is too wet.

580
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:42,350
You can leave after it's dried.

581
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:44,900
Did you bring it here?

582
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:48,160
I guessed you wouldn't have it, so I took one with me.

583
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:49,340
I really don't.

584
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:52,430
I'll blow-dry my hair then.

585
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:23,500
There's steak, some vegetables

586
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:24,580
and bread in the fridge.

587
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:25,900
If you don't like eating any of them.

588
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,060
Call room service.

589
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:30,340
I know, I'm not a child.

590
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:31,340
I saw where the restaurant was

591
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:32,340
when we were

592
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,380
on our way back.

593
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:36,140
I gotta go.

594
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:43,340
Take care.

595
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:43,940
Okay.

596
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:07,910
Zhousheng Chen.

597
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:11,900
I heard a complaint about your

598
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,900
embezzlement of the project funds.

599
00:34:14,139 --> 00:34:14,600
This...

600
00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:16,139
What a joke.

601
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:21,100
There's nothing wrong with the previous agreement, right?

602
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,580
The work has been made public,

603
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:23,780
and we also applied for the patent.

604
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:25,310
There's no problem with it.

605
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:26,780
As for the funds,

606
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:28,699
we will find out by looking into it.

607
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:30,429
Shall we go in and talk about it?

608
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:32,940
Not today.

609
00:34:33,219 --> 00:34:34,219
My wife is here.

610
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:35,940
Your wife is here?

611
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:37,460
She just took

612
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:38,780
a dozen hours' flight to come here

613
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:39,780
and must be tired.

614
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,380
She must be sleeping now.

615
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,580
Let's make it another day,

616
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,710
and not disturb her.

617
00:34:43,739 --> 00:34:45,020
Good, I will invite you

618
00:34:45,139 --> 00:34:46,340
and your wife for dinner someday,

619
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:47,670
to show my hospitality.

620
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:48,380
Okay.

621
00:34:48,739 --> 00:34:49,100
Bye.

622
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:49,699
Bye.

623
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:17,260
What time is it?

624
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:25,380
5:47.

625
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:28,980
Come to bed.

626
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,550
The sofa is uncomfortable.

627
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,140
I just got back from the laboratory.

628
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:35,340
My clothes are dirty.

629
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:36,660
I will go take a shower

630
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:37,630
and get changed.

631
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:39,100
I don't mind.

632
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:40,750
Come up here.

633
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:21,660
Is it really so hard for you to sleep with your wife

634
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:22,820
on the same bed?

635
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:25,780
It's not hard.

636
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:28,580
I was afraid of waking you.

637
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:31,220
I am already awake.

638
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:35,350
Are you going to keep sleeping?

639
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:37,700
Yeah.

640
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,580
I wasn't sleeping well

641
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,300
before you came back.

642
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:43,580
Now my head feels dizzy

643
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:45,270
and I want to keep sleeping.

644
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:47,500
You go do thatt.

645
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:01,320
Were you going to do something

646
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:03,020
after I sent you the flowers?

647
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:07,500
I have always been

648
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:09,180
terrible with words.

649
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:12,190
Yet you always surprise me.

650
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:14,670
And there are so many surprises

651
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,460
that I am speechless.

652
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:22,150
Then how are you gonna repay me?

653
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:26,860
Repay?

654
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:30,900
How do you want me to repay you?

655
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,110
Help me fall asleep.

656
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:43,460
How would you fall sleep more easily

657
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:44,900
normally?

658
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:50,020
Listen to music, or poems.

659
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,580
I will fall asleep

660
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:53,740
after listening to them for a while.

661
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:54,660
When I was young,

662
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:56,300
in order to help me memorize poems,

663
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:58,460
my mother used to read them for me every night before sleep

664
00:38:58,460 --> 00:38:59,520
and I got used to it.

665
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:05,380
Then I will read some poems.

666
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:09,190
Can I choose which poem?

667
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:12,580
You don't have to recite the whole poem, just one or two lines.

668
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:13,340
Sure.

669
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:16,020
Bai Juyi.

670
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:27,820
I drank too much last night,

671
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:32,220
and I drank throughout the night.

672
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:35,940
I ate too much for breakfast,

673
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:39,870
and I fell asleep after I eating full to bursting.

674
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:43,380
Stop kidding around, I'm too sleepy.

675
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:46,220
I'm just responding to your request

676
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:47,420
to recite some poems.

677
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:49,100
You did it on purpose,

678
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:50,440
choosing these lines.

679
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,700
Things like drinking too much last night

680
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:54,260
and being full to bursting today,

681
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:55,460
just to make me laugh.

682
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:58,820
All right, I will try to behave.

683
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:06,100
The white porcelain cup is crystal clear.

684
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:09,820
The fire is blazing inside the stove.

685
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:13,440
The tea leaves give off the scent of alcohol,

686
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:16,940
and the water is now bubbling.

687
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:21,060
When I poured the tea into the cup, it looked fabulous.

688
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:24,060
After I drank it, the fragrance still lingered.

689
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:29,660
That's it?

690
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:43,660
One, two, three, four, five,

691
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:48,740
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

692
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:51,900
Eleven.

693
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:58,080
♫The day we met♫

694
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:02,090
♫Time froze♫

695
00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:06,970
♫It's your smiling eyes♫

696
00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:10,990
♫That made the hustle and bustle of the world gone♫

697
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:13,760
♫Every moment♫

698
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:19,680
♫Drives away the weariness of the past♫

699
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:21,960
♫Love spreads♫

700
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:25,780
♫I'm glad you're here♫

701
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:28,430
♫One more day with you♫

702
00:41:28,430 --> 00:41:30,340
♫Love gets deeper♫

703
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:32,340
♫Making it a poem♫

704
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:35,830
♫Kissing through the long years♫

705
00:41:36,090 --> 00:41:38,620
♫Wrapping love around my fingertips♫

706
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:42,400
♫Make a vow in silence♫

707
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:43,960
♫Embrace again♫

708
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,920
♫A few forever♫

709
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:48,010
♫Nothing will change♫

710
00:41:48,010 --> 00:41:51,940
♫With the same warm sunny day♫

711
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:56,090
♫Give you my true love♫

712
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:59,800
♫Thank you for being there♫

713
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:15,390
♫One more day with you♫

714
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,570
♫Love gets deeper♫

715
00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:19,510
♫Making it a poem♫

716
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:22,870
♫Kissing through the long years♫

717
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:25,930
♫Wrapping love around my fingertips♫

718
00:42:25,930 --> 00:42:29,700

00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:31,320

00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,260
♫A few forever♫

721
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:35,150
♫Nothing will change♫

722
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:39,180
♫With the same warm sunny day♫

00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:43,120
♫Give you my true love♫

724
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:46,810
♫Believe you can feel the same♫

725
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,670
♫Maybe it's the snow falling without a sound♫

726
00:43:17,430 --> 00:43:21,160
♫Maybe it's the flower in the mirror without a trace♫

727
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:25,890
♫I've seen all the scenes of the passing years♫

728
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:25,620
Even the most beautiful face

729
00:43:25,890 --> 00:43:30,570
♫They're not as good as you, not as good as you♫

730
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:28,140
will have to age.

731
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:31,300
You are the best in my mind.

732
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,580
♫I look at a ripple♫

733
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:34,700
I can see the bones of beauty inside you.

734
00:43:35,170 --> 00:43:38,730
♫It's like there's no wind and no sunshine♫

735
00:43:39,070 --> 00:43:43,800
♫The more silent my love becomes♫

736
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:40,540
Where?

737
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:47,800
♫The more my heart turns to rain♫

738
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:47,900
In here.

739
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:52,320
♫There is grace in your eyebrows♫

740
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:52,460
People's faces are shaped by their hearts.

741
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:53,900
If they are kind at heart, they look kind in their face.

742
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:56,850
♫I'll spend my whole life looking for it♫

743
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:55,760
One has to have dignity

744
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:57,380
before having the bones of beauty.

745
00:43:56,850 --> 00:43:59,700
♫Don't blame me for the sporadic sweet talk♫

746
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:04,760
♫I wake up from my dreams and I'm even colder♫

747
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:02,980
I realize I am totally dwarfed by you

748
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:05,020
in terms of mastering the art of language.

749
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:09,950
♫My heart that can't stand being away from love♫

750
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:14,710
♫Hides nothing from you♫

751
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:16,020
Do you still remember the composition Shanglin Fu?

752
00:44:14,710 --> 00:44:17,510
♫The scene I look down for♫

753
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:17,900
The first time we met,

754
00:44:17,510 --> 00:44:19,700
♫Gets clear after saying goodbye♫

755
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:19,380
I could think of

756
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:23,550
♫Every glimpse means missing you♫

757
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:23,500
no better line than

758
00:44:23,550 --> 00:44:29,480
♫Even if to be a stranger to you♫

759
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:26,220
“Her beauty is breathtaking and charming with only a touch of make-up”

760
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:27,300
to describe you.

761
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:36,140
I have got you a wedding gift.

762
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:40,460
What gift?

763
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:48,380
I see you love wearing shirts.

764
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:50,200
So, I bought some cuff-links.

765
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:54,940
When I was shopping,

766
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:56,580
I said I was buying these for my husband.

767
00:44:56,580 --> 00:44:58,340
The clerk asked what kind of color do you like,

768
00:44:58,340 --> 00:44:59,600
but I didn't even know.

769
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:01,510
That's why I didn't specify

770
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:04,780
and then bought them in five different colors.

771
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:08,660
What color do you prefer?

772
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:11,820
I like them all.

773
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:14,020
Be serious.

774
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:19,300
If I have to choose one, then…

775
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:21,980
this one.

776
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:27,180
Shi Yi.

777
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:29,100
Thank you.

778
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:32,580
I bought some vegetables.

779
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:34,580
Are you having dinner at home today?

780
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:36,780
Last night's meeting in the lab

781
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:38,100
still hasn't finished.

782
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:39,220
I just took a few hours' break just to come home

783
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:39,980
and see you,

784
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:41,470
in case you got worried.

785
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:42,580
I will go back to the meeting

786
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:43,940
in a minute.

787
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:47,420
It's okay.

788
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:48,740
These last few days,

789
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:51,070
you must have had a lot of work to transfer.

790
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:53,860
What a pity.

791
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:56,180
I bought the Bundesliga tickets

792
00:45:56,180 --> 00:45:57,910
and I was going to surprise you.

793
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:00,780
Do you love football?

794
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:02,980
I know nothing about it.

795
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:04,380
Xiaoyu is a die-hard fan.

796
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:05,700
She urged me to watch it

797
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:08,100
and asked me to give her some live coverage.

798
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:10,740
I will make you something

799
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:11,460
as fast as I can.

800
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:12,580
You go brush your teeth and wash your face.
