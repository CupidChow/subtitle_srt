00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,360
But you sitting here all day long

176
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,020
wouldn't help with anything,

177
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,560
not to mention that your injury hasn't healed yet.

178
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,100
You should go back and take some rest.

179
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:20,560
It's okay.

180
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:22,320
I'll be fine.

181
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:47,960
Have some water.

182
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,860
We need to think about what to do next.

183
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,160
Life needs to go on,

184
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,520
and we don't know when Shi Yi

185
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,640
can wake up.

186
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,040
The good thing is

187
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,640
that you , I,

188
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,960
and the care attendant

189
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,940
can take turns to take care of her.

190
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,120
But what are you

191
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,520
going to do with the one outside?

192
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,480
We both know him well.

193
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,840
To be fair,

194
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,840
he's always been a good kid.

195
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,690
But it's true that without him,

196
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,040
our daughter wouldn't have

197
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,770
had to suffer this misfortune.

198
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,400
How about this?

199
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,360
Let's have a talk with him

200
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,600
and see what he's going to do.

201
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,120
Ignoring him like this

202
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,079
will get us nowhere.

203
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:42,960
Chen.

204
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:50,960
Mr. Shi.

205
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,420
Please come in.

206
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,680
I never left.

207
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,210
I'm always here for you.

208
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,680
I'm there

209
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,370
whenever you want to see me!

210
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,720
Chen.

211
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:09,960
We need to talk.

212
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,320
In front of Shi Yi,

213
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,660
we'd like to figure out a plan for the future.

214
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,080
We had no idea

215
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,640
that you two got married.

216
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,800
We thought

217
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,760
separating you two would be

218
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,530
the best for everybody.

219
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,840
But we didn't expect that you had

220
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,440
obtained your marriage certificate already.

221
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,720
Of course,

222
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,440
a certificate

223
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,160
is not everything.

224
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,200
So,

225
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,880
if… if you want to leave,

226
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,360
we won't stop you.

227
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,840
We can take care of Shi Yi ourselves.

228
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,120
When she wakes up,

229
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,440
you can get an official divorce.

230
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,600
I won't leave her,

231
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,970
neither will I divorce her.

232
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,560
That's not what Shi Yi and I want.

233
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,640
We've told you

234
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:37,360
that we don't want you to take responsibility.

235
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,160
Why won't you just let go?

236
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,920
She's my wife,

237
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,760
always have been and always will be.

238
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,040
We've been destined

239
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,480
to be together forever

240
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,040
since the moment we met.

241
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,280
What if she never wakes up?

242
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,560
If she never wakes up,

243
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,400
I'll take care of her for the rest of my life.

244
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,680
In fact, this week,

245
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:22,760
every day I'd wake up

246
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,400
at 5:30 a.m.

247
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,490
and leave the hospital.

248
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,170
After I get home,

249
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,360
I'd take a shower and change,

250
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,920
and then go to work.

251
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,520
I have my three meals

252
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,320
in the cafeteria of the institute.

253
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,930
After leaving work on time,

254
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,120
I'd ask the attending doctor

255
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,480
about Shi Yi's condition.

256
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,640
I did some calculations.

257
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,560
It takes me 20 minutes to drive

258
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,600
from the institute to the hospital,

259
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,960
40 minutes during

260
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:07,720
the peak hours.

261
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,840
Though it's a little far,

262
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,020
it's not a big problem.

263
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,040
If you agree,

264
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:21,680
I can find

265
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,840
a closer hospital,

266
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,180
so that I can save some time

267
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,840
on the commute.

268
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,840
Shi Yi once told me

269
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,400
that she disliked hospital.

270
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,280
So I'm thinking

271
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,340
after her condition has stabilized,

272
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,120
I'll arrange private medical care

273
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,250
for her and take care

274
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,240
of her at home.

275
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,080
That way,

276
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,960
I can have more time

277
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,640
to spend with her.

278
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:57,880
I'm not quite sure

279
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,760
what you are getting at?

280
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,280
I've prepared to maintain

281
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,720
our marriage in this way.

282
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,320
I have faith that she'll wake up,

283
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,220
but I've also prepared myself

284
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,400
for the possibility of waiting

285
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,360
for a lifetime.

286
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,080
Your words

287
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,680
are something touching,

288
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,320
but I still can't let you off

289
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,360
or forgive you.

290
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,360
Mrs. Shi,

291
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,960
you are her mother.

292
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:48,920
Be it hatred, hostility,

293
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,320
or rage,

294
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:54,400
I accept however

295
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,760
you feel

296
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,440
about me.

297
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,040
But Shi Yi and I have never had

298
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:03,280
any problem in our relationship.

299
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,300
I can't live without her,

300
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,550
neither can she without me.

301
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:14,020
I believe

302
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:17,060
what Shi Yi wants

303
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,100
to see the most

304
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,550
is a complete, happy family

305
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:23,420
when she wakes up.

306
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:36,620
You can go back now.

307
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,620
She means for you

308
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:04,140
to go home and have some sleep.

309
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:06,310
We'll take turns

310
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:10,460
and take care of Shi Yi in the future.

311
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:21,440
Thank you, Mr. Shi!

312
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:41,260
Off you go.

Mrs. Shi.

334
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:03,380
Her father stayed up a few nights in a row

335
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:04,590
and fell ill.

336
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:10,380
I'll leave her to you tonight.

337
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:12,660

00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:34,640
♫Nothing will change♫

347
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:38,720
♫With the same warm sunny day♫

348
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,750
♫Give you my true love♫

349
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:46,310
♫Thank you for being there♫

350
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:49,500
I remember

351
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:52,140
every little detail

352
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:53,260
about what I did,

353
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:54,780
ate and said

354
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:56,140
in this week.

355
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:58,980
If you don't mind,

356
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:00,540
I'd love to share them

357
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:01,540
with you.

358
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:14,820
Although there's a wall between us now,

359
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:18,820
it won't stop me from thinking of you every day.

360
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:40,780
[Family of Books and Rituals]

361
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:46,860
Our family values blood ties the most

362
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:50,030
and has little tolerance for family feud.

363
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,100
Qin Wan,

364
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:53,820
things have become like this

365
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:55,620
because you overprotected him.

366
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,200
Our family has been hit hard this time!

367
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,060
And Chen's wife

368
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:00,910
is still in a coma!

369
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:13,660
The parents should take the blame for their children's mistakes.

370
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:15,220
He did such a horrible thing

371
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,610
because I failed in educating him.

372
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:20,140
I should leave even if

373
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:22,860
you don't ask me to.

374
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:25,880
Everyone, think about it.

375
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:27,300
Qin Wan has been managing

376
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:29,160
the clan for years and she's never

377
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,630
made any major mistake.

378
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:32,300
This time

379
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:34,500
it was Wenchuan's fault.

380
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,660
We can't blame Qin Wan for it.

381
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:37,460
That's right.

382
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,860
I'm not trying to give you a hard time.

383
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:44,290
But if she hadn't spoiled him so much

384
00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:46,100
after Wenxing was gone,

385
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,170
something like this wouldn't have happened.

386
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:52,620
Shi Yi is still unconscious.

387
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:55,540
With so many things going on,

388
00:31:55,890 --> 00:31:59,620
there's no trustworthy person to whom I can hand over the house yet.

389
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,820
When Chen and Shi Yi

390
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:09,300
come back,

391
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:11,140
I will step down

392
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:13,310
and move back to the Qin family.

393
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,760
You guys are chatting?

394
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:22,230
We came five minutes early.

395
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:23,660
We'll wait outside.

396
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:24,660
Please continue.

397
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:26,950
We'll take our leave.

398
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:27,750
You guys talk.

399
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:00,620
I'm a junior here.

400
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:02,340
Usually

401
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:03,910
I wouldn't speak first.

402
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:06,020
But,

403
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,210
today I'm here

404
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:09,710
to discuss an agreement with you two

405
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:11,390
as Zhousheng Chen's lawyer,

406
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:19,100
I'm not familiar

407
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,710
with their matters.

408
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:22,890
I'll let Mei Xing explain.

409
00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:29,670
Because of what happened to his wife,

410
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:32,260
he can't calmly face his family,

411
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:34,900
so he entrusts me with everything.

412
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:36,750
He and I

413
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:38,940
have gone over every article

414
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:40,580
in this agreement

415
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:41,980
when we were in Germany.

416
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,420
I can explain everything

417
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:47,580
you want to know

418
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:49,840
about the articles on his behalf.

419
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:52,460
His interest has always

420
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:54,120
been in scientific research.

421
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,240
When the investment plan is over,

422
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,380
which is in 10 years,

423
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,840
he's going to let Ren take over the Zhou family.

424
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:02,500
He has only

425
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:03,940
one condition, though,

426
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:06,050
that the foundation of the family business

427
00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:07,310
must be based in China,

428
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:09,030
which can never change.

429
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:13,270
You two are both Ren's guardians.

430
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:16,190
Please take a look at the agreement.

431
00:34:23,739 --> 00:34:24,940
I have no objections.

432
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:28,540
Even though I didn't give birth to Ren,

433
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,420
I'm the one who raised him.

434
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:32,820
He shares the same character and aptitude

435
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,020
as his elder brother.

436
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:36,699
But the Zhou family has traditionally

437
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:38,139
had the eldest son be the primary heir.

438
00:34:38,139 --> 00:34:38,699
He said

439
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:40,980
you would have a way

440
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:42,840
to persuade the diehard members.

441
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:44,460
There's no need to worry.

442
00:34:47,949 --> 00:34:49,940
Though I adopted Ren,

443
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:52,380
you are after all his father.

444
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:53,610
You should make

445
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:55,900
a decision on this.

446
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:02,460
I don't have

447
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:04,240
to hide anything from you two.

448
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:06,260
Given what happened,

449
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:07,620
I can't stay and continue

450
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:09,220
to manage this home anymore.

451
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:11,990
You can discuss the future matters

452
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:14,060
with Zhousheng Xing.

453
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,060
Ms. Qin.

454
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:19,350
Please hear me out.

455
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:22,590
What I'm about to say next concerns you.

456
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:25,020
He said

457
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:27,940
you had fully devoted yourself

458
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:29,470
into this family for years,

459
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:31,260
as if it was your child.

460
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:34,280
Over the past 20 years,

461
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:36,220
you've never given up on this family

462
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:37,900
despite all the hardships and difficulties.

463
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:38,740
And now

464
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,220
you don't have to, either.

465
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:43,180
You are more attached to this family

466
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:44,220
than he is.

467
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,220
The people here

468
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:47,640
are like you children.

469
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,080
If you insist on leaving,

470
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,290
no one will stop you.

471
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:55,280
But if you want to stay,

472
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:57,580
you are more than welcome to.

473
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:34,740
Today is my birthday.

474
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:36,380
What kind of gift

475
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,860
will you get for me?

476
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:44,340
I asked madam Wang

477
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:46,000
to make this outfit for you

478
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:47,050
on short notice.

479
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,340
It's named "cloud gown."

480
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,420
It was made by 10 embroidery girls,

481
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:53,680
implying flawlessness and perfection.

482
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:58,700
By the way,

483
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:00,900
I bumped into the doctor just now.

484
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:02,580
He warned me

485
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,700
that you might get confused

486
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:06,790
and not be able to recognize me

487
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:08,080
when you first wake up.

488
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:10,820
So I'll have to keep telling you

489
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:12,740
that we've gotten married

490
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,300
and that I'm your husband

491
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:15,980
in case you drive me out

492
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:19,030
and give the nurses something to laugh about.

493
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:26,800
I did one thing without asking

494
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:29,900
your permission, though.

495
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:32,380
I've found

496
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,760
an apartment in Xi'an.

497
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:35,940
We'll go there after your room

498
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,420
is ready.

499
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:41,580
And

500
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:45,700
your parents have approved.

501
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:46,540
I'll try to put away all the books

502
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:48,670
in the living room within half an hour.

503
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,460
And I'll let Cheng

504
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:50,990
put a movie on for you later.

505
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:52,580
I'll come back to check on you

506
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,110
after I'm done organizing.

507
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,420
"The bones of the beauty,"

508
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:49,790
"are rarely seen in this world."

509
00:39:50,610 --> 00:39:54,260
"Some may have good bone structure, but not beautiful facial features."

510
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:58,120
"Many have beautiful facial features, but not good bone structure."

511
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:01,140
"Most people are shallow, seeing only the skin-deep appearance"

512
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:04,070
"and not the bones, the inside beauty."

513
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:07,670
Zhousheng Chen,

514
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,090
when writing this name,

515
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:12,090
two people would come to my mind.

516
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:14,100
One is you,

517
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,480
and the other is the reason I met you.

518
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:21,940
We talked about him a few times.

519
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:23,530
Because of the story of

520
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,540
the Junior Prince of Nanchen,

521
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:28,000
I took the initiative to introduce myself to you

522
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,600
at the airport in Guangzhou,

523
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,850
which was something

524
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:33,830
I'd never imagined I would do.

525
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,010
What was

526
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:38,860
your first thought about me?

527
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:40,520
You can tell me tomorrow

528
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:41,750
if it's good.

529
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:44,070
Otherwise,

530
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:47,080
you'd better say you had forgotten.

531
00:40:53,830 --> 00:40:55,020
It's said that

532
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,210
he was a power-driven traitor.

533
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:00,110
I didn't believe that, though.

534
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:00,900
So

535
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:02,660
I searched all the clues I could find in the ancient books

536
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:04,120
and wrote a biographical note

537
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,450
on Zhousheng Chen,

538
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:08,070
the Junior Prince of Nanchen.

539
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:11,420
Of course,

540
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:13,220
as a scientist,

541
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:15,310
you may need evidence to support it.

542
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:18,010
Even so, please read this through,

543
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:20,860
or I won't marry you!

544
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,890
Why was he dismembered?

545
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:35,220
Because he was known

546
00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:36,830
for his beautiful bones.

547
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:38,860
That was why the crown prince

548
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:41,060
decided to punish him by dismemberment

549
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,700
in front of everyone

550
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:44,580
to make an example of him.

551
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:50,580
[How stainless the water-lily rises from its slimy bed, how modestly it reposes on the clear pool.]

552
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:55,420
The Junior Prince of Nanchen stayed single for his whole life,

553
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:57,060
yet the rumor said he had a romantic relationship

554
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:58,820
with the crown princess.

555
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:01,120
After he was executed,

556
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,700
the crown princess also died.

557
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:06,060
Some said

558
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:08,370
she jumped off a 30-meter tower

559
00:42:08,370 --> 00:42:09,830
in Nanchen Royal Mansion.

560
00:42:10,410 --> 00:42:11,690
Some, however, said

561
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,700
she jumped off the city wall of the capital.

562
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:19,020
As opinions vary, no unanimous conclusion can be drawn.

563
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:23,130
Only the transcript of "Fu on the Imperial Park"

564
00:42:23,130 --> 00:42:24,220
that the crown princess copied in the library of the mansion

565
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:26,420
remained a trace of evidence and became

566
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:30,780
a much-told story by later generations.

567
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:37,690
All glory of his life

568
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:40,060
was summed up in a few words

569
00:42:40,970 --> 00:42:43,230
and has been long forgotten by the world.

570
00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:00,220
Would you like to take a picture?

571
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:04,620
Seeing that you are dressed neatly

572
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:06,940
and in a good mood,

573
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:09,260
I feel much relieved.

574
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:10,780
About what?

575
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:13,240
Do you know how long you've

576
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:14,600
been sitting here?

577
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:16,950
I've been watching you for half an hour now

578
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:19,110
in case you'd do something stupid.

579
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:21,220
Excuse me,

580
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:26,060
is there anywhere I can go horseback riding in Chang'an?

581
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:28,060
I don't know about Chang'an,

582
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:29,480
but I'm sure Xi'an has one.

583
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:31,140
You need to go to a tourist spot, though.

584
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:32,780
Go online and check the travel strategy.

585
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:33,640
I'm sure you can

586
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:35,800
find a horseback riding place

587
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:37,340
where you can enjoy a trail ride

588
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:38,340
and have some fun.

589
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:41,460
Don't do it in the downtown area.

590
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:15,020
Uncle Lin, I want to go back for one day.

591
00:44:15,910 --> 00:44:16,970
There's something

592
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:18,140
I need to finish.
