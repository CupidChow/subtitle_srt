00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,300
She's wearing the dress you made.

175
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,280
This time, my second oldest brother wins.

176
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,480
Okay, stop it.

177
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,400
Have a seat.

178
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,200
I can't stand too long.

179
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,080
I won't be over-polite.

180
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,080
I'll just sit down.

181
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:05,800
Madam.

182
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,500
This is the oldest son of the Zhou family.

183
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:10,880
Hello, Ma'am.

184
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,280
I've seen you before

185
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,040
when you were four years old.

186
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,330
It's been so many years.

187
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,320
I've made a lot of clothes for you

188
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,400
but I never saw you.

189
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,220
I didn't expect that now when I see you again,

190
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,840
you'd be here with your bride.

191
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,520
Hello, Ma'am.

192
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,760
Good, good.

193
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,760
They only gave me the size before.

194
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,690
But I couldn't see the real person.

195
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:42,480
Clothes should match the person anyway.

196
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,880
Not just the size,

197
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,360
but the looks, temperament,

198
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,600
they all must be taken into account.

199
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,300
I've been making clothes all my life.

200
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,560
I've never met a girl

201
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,920
who has got both

202
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,520
such a good body and such good looks.

203
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,640
Well, well.

204
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,090
Grandma, you flattered me.

205
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,520
No, no, no.

206
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,920
I'm over 100 years old.

207
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,440
I'm too old to make small talk.

208
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,360
What I said is all true.

209
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,960
Grandma is right.

210
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,320
In the eyes of

211
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,400
us tailors,

212
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,720
you're a treasure.

213
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,080
You've worn this dress already,

214
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,440
so you can't wear it again for the engagement.

215
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,120
Since last time

216
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,560
you chose my brother's dress,

217
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,280
I'll make one for you this time.

218
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,340
I'm okay with that.

219
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,680
Okay, it's a deal.

220
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,960
Let's go take measurements for you now.

221
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,820
I'll start now.

222
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,080
Don't be in a hurry.

223
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,480
Grandma, if I don't,

224
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,280
they'll snatch it from me again.

225
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,000
Okay, okay.

226
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,900
I'll wait for you here.

227
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,080
Take a look around.

228
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,340
I'll go get something.

229
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,600
Most of the cheongsams here

230
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,060
are ordered by his family.

231
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,440
I made it.

232
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,410
It's beautiful.

233
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,480
My family's work.

234
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,200
From the Republican period?

235
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:22,680
Yes.

236
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,580
It's a photo taken during the Republic of China.

237
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,960
My ancestral family is from Ningbo.

238
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,800
They started in the late Qing Dynasty and early Republican era.

239
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,720
At that time, the tailors here

240
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,540
were called Red Gang tailors.

241
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,120
Because Ningbo was among the first cities

242
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,980
to trade with foreign countries,

243
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,460
they first started to make western clothes.

244
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,800
As they became more and more professional,

245
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,720
they gradually formed

246
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,680
such a school.

247
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,720
Since you specialize in western-style clothing,

248
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,080
why is this place full of cheongsams?

249
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,280
My younger brother is obsessed with Chinese clothing

250
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,720
while I prefer western styles.

251
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,520
My sister's style is rather mixed,

252
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,080
and hasn't fully settled yet.

253
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,610
You're talking about me behind my back again.

254
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,400
Miss Shi.

255
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,660
Let me take your measurements first.

256
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,570
Raise your hand.

257
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,080
Your legs are so long.

258
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,520
I have a cousin

259
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,920
applying for dance school

260
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,160
who is required to have legs 14 centimeters longer

261
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,400
than her upper body.

262
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,680
You exceed that standard by

263
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,240
about two centimeters.

264
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,360
Actually, I've already made

265
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,120
the cheongsam.

266
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,200
I'll make some adjustments over the next few days.

267
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,260
I'll call you again

268
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,090
to let you try it on in a few days.

269
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,120
I forgot to ask just now, but

270
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,400
why did you choose

271
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,520
this dress?

272
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,240
Because…

273
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,080
I like this color.

274
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,320
Young master.

275
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,080
Goodbye.

276
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:54,890
I'm leaving.

277
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,400
Take care.

278
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:24,320
Brother, I'll go take a stroll by myself.

279
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,120
Brother, what's wrong with her?

280
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,880
She was happy just now.

281
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,640
Maybe she thought of what happened between

282
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,900
her and Zhou Wenchuan.

283
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,780
They are not right for each other.

284
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,850
How many times have they broken up?

285
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,330
Now Zhou Wenchuan is getting married.

286
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,080
What's there to be sad about?

287
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,360
Here's the problem.

288
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:52,980
They quarreled

289
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:53,960
so casually.

290
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,320
She thought that this time would just be another of those times.

291
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,240
Last time she was drunk

292
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:57,920
and told me,

293
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,760
she's been waiting for Zhou Wenchuan

294
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,820
to make up with her.

295
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,050
She never thought he would suddenly get married.

296
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,720
Young people are too impulsive.

297
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,540
It's too late for regrets.

298
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:36,940
[Recording Studio]

299
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:29,840
Miss Shi Yi.

300
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:41,380
[All these years of fighting with the world, are you still radiant and interested in things?]

301
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,850
Congratulations on the award.

302
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,730
What is this?

303
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,490
It's made of meteorite.

304
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,680
Meteorite?

305
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,120
Shouldn't this kind of thing be

306
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,380
collected in a museum?

307
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,700
Where there is a collection, there is a sale.

308
00:17:59,120 --> 00:17:59,920
It can be sold?

309
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,680
How are they sold? By weight?

310
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,200
Meteorites are usually measured by category

311
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,160
or stocks.

312
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,490
Stone meteorites are the most common.

313
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:11,000
The more valuable kinds are iron meteorites,

314
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,060
glass meteorites,

315
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,180
lunar meteorites,

316
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,370
Martian meteorites

317
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,560
and diamond meteorites.

318
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,160
They're all sold by the gram.

319
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,060
If a meteorite is witnessed falling,

320
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,240
it's more valuable.

321
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,800
Thank you for the information.

322
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,930
Thanks for the gift.

323
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,400
This is not expensive, right?

324
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,640
I want to wear it every day.

325
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,160
I'm afraid it's too expensive to wear.

326
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,620
It's not expensive at all.

327
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,040
Good.

328
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,680
To celebrate your award,

329
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,240
I'll treat you to dinner.

330
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,280
Let's go.

331
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,000
Thank you.

332
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,640
This time it took 38 minutes.

333
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,970
So her customary shower time duration

334
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,600
should be between 25 and 38 minutes.

335
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,340
Do young people in love

336
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,600
like to observe from a distance?

337
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,880
I just want to know more about

338
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,240
her living habits.

339
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,730
After all, we have to live together in the future.

340
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,020
It's good for two people to get along,

341
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,840
and easier to reduce conflicts before they happen

342
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,040
if I understand her life habits.

343
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:56,040
You actually don't want to leave.

344
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,400
You'd rather go up

345
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,900
instead of talking to yourself here.

346
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,420
Let's go to the institute.

347
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,920
Why did he give you

348
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,440
a meteorite watch?

349
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,560
It seems to be related to his past work.

350
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,690
It may be a souvenir.

351
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,200
I don't know if it's waterproof.

352
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,040
I just want to know

353
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,890
is there any radiation?

354
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,200
It's for me.

355
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,290
I don't think so.

356
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,240
Why are you looking at me?

[Where's my boyfriend!]

358
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:06,880
Boring.

359
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,490
I'm going to bed.

360
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:28,720
Sir.

361
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,440
No date tonight?

362
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,280
It's over.

363
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,440
It's over?

364
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,080
Sir,

365
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,400
don't you need to stay overnight today?

366
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,730
No, I don't think so.

367
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,120
You're not telling me

368
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,480
that you always bring your girlfriend

369
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,120
to her home

370
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,210
and say goodbye politely, are you?

371
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,800
Pretty much.

372
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,760
A gentleman.

373
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,040
What gentleman?

374
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,760
That's because

375
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,960
they've only been together for a while.

376
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,400
They're not close enough for him to stay overnight.

377
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,330
Sir, I was wrong.

378
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,600
Sir, we're going back to the dormitory.

379
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,200
Let's go.

380
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:01,760
Tell me

381
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,050

No, I'm not.

[Zhousheng Chen]

389

I'm used to doing this when I don't feel calm.

390

[Shi Yi]

Our wedding house in Shanghai is ready.

397
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,040
I wanted to tell you several times tonight

398
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,970
but I couldn't find the right time.

399
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,880
Why are you here?

400
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,100
I came to have breakfast with you.

401
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,880
I already had it.

402
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:39,480
You told me

403
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,010
you usually wake up at 7:00.

404
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,160
So I figured I'd come at the right time.

405
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,280
I didn't think I'd miss it.

406
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,000
I just somehow got up early today.

407
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,260
You haven't eaten yet?

408

Of course he hasn't.

Do you want to go upstairs?

I'll make you something to eat.

412

Sure.

413
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,560
If it's convenient for you.

414
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:03,960
It's convenient.

Let's go.

416
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,000
I wonder

417

if this is to your taste.

It's delicious.

00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,540
or did you get a cold again?

Is it hot?

I feel like I have a low fever.

You're not

going to give me Chinese medicine again, right?

430
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,890
Not if it's not working.

431
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,360
That's made with perilla leaves.

432

It's good for curing a cold.

433
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,520
But it's no longer

434

simply a cold you're having.

435
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,080
I should have let you finish it last time

and sleep here overnight to sweat it out.

437

You'd have been fine right away

I'll give you the fever medicine.

443

Then you take a nap

444
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,600
and the fever will come right down.

445

I'll go make up a room for you.

Sleep until you wake up naturally.

It will be better for your recovery.

453
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,000
Put it there.

454
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,400
I'll just wash it myself.

I'm done.

Go to sleep now.

No one will disturb you.

Go to sleep.

461
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,440
I've explained everything.

462
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:34,880
You go back

463
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,500
and check the contents carefully again.

464
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:37,850
Okay.

Then we'll go back.

Bye.

467
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,800
It's just a marriage.

He needs to redecorate the house?

470

It's just a new bed.

471
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,720
Zhousheng Chen asked you to do this?

472
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,400
Absolutely he did.

473
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:53,880
How dare we

474
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,410
if he didn't make the order?

475
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:56,480
I'm going.

476
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,640
Pretending to resist

477
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,240
and acting like a gentleman in front of people,

478
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,160
he even changed the bed

479
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,490
behind people's backs.

480
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,960
What's wrong, bachelor?

481
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,700
Are you jealous of my brother?

482
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,320
You know I'm jealous

483
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,320
and are trying to hurt me on purpose?

484
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,760
Now you only recognize him as your brother,

485
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,640
not me.

486
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,560
How could I do that?

487
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,400
I came here

488
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,000
when I heard you were back.

489
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,120
I can take that.

490
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,880
My brother is getting married soon.

491
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,370
You're still not settled down?

492
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:35,140
I haven't found someone to settle down with.

493
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,240
What kind of girl do you like?

494
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:44,960
Every time I ask you this,

495
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,290
you don't say anything.

496
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,720
I like to work.

497
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,040
Also,

498
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,280
if you ask me professional questions again

499
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,120
in the future,

500
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,480
I may have to charge you for the consultation.

501
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,040
You would dare charge me?

502
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,260
You're coming.

503
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:09,720
Uncle Lin.

504
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:12,450
I'm here to deliver a set of clean clothes.

505
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,680
He told you?

506
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:14,400
Yes.

507
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,000
He said you gave him

508
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:16,930
fever medicine.

509
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:17,680
He's afraid when he wakes up,

510
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,680
his clothes will be all sweaty.

511
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,200
So he asked me to bring it here.

512
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,600
That's very thoughtful.

513
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,560
He's been like this since he was a kid.

514
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,200
Come in and sit for a while.

515
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:27,930
No, I'm fine.

516
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,040
We're getting the furniture in for

517
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,640
your bridal room these days.

518
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,720
I'm a little worried. I have to go check it out.

519
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,240
If the wallpaper is scratched,

520
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,300
it'll be terrible.

521
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,080
Thank you, Uncle Lin.

522
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,160
It's nothing.

523
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,850
When you have children,

524
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:40,960
I'll be busier.

525
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,040
I'm going.

526
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,040

Uncle Lin sent clean clothes.

00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,420

00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,200
You're up?

560
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,840
I'm not used to sleeping for so long.

561
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,880
You've been watching TV?

562
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,199
Do I look weird?

563
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:12,120
It's the first time I've seen it.

564
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,000
It feels fresh.

565
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:21,770
Your fever is finally gone.

566
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:22,360
Why didn't you take any medicine

567
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,440
for the fever?

568
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,360
I usually let this kind of low fever

569
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,480
get better on its own.

570
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:29,770
Do you feel uncomfortable?

571
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:30,639
No dizziness?

572
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,360
I don't feel it when I'm working.

573
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,400
You don't take care of yourself.

574
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,199
Right.

575
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,360
I saw you had some bottles of nail polish

576
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,239
in the bathroom.

577
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,159
There are volatile solvents in the ingredients.

578
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:46,120
It's ethyl and has acetate.

579
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,000
It's really bad for your health

580
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,460
if you smell too much of it.

581
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:49,520
Be sure to use it

582
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:50,940
in a ventilated place.

583
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:53,679
Although I can't understand its composition,

584
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:54,920
those who have used it know

585
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:55,840
it's got a pungent smell.

586
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,800
So I usually use it

587
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,920
in the balcony.

588
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,620
I didn't think of that.

589
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:04,960
You so don't

590
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,480
know about girls.

591
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,520
Why would you research into it?

592
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,560
I wanted to do something

593
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,080
to help others.

594
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,440
I think research

595
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,280
can help more people,

596
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:26,810
for example, my sister.

597
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,080
She has had a heart problem,

598
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:28,960
a congenital issue with blood supply,

599
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,280
since she was born.

600
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,000
She hasn't had a strong body.

601
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,400
But she has been studying medicine

602
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,200
to help more people.

603
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:36,890
Unfortunately,

604
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:39,720
she left school before finishing her studies.

605
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,010
Because of her health problem?

606
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,640
Will you stay home for dinner at night

607
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,560
or should you go back to Zhenjiang?

608
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,420
I'm staying in Shanghai this week

609
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,240
in a hotel.

610
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,600
I've applied for a temporary room

611
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,760
in the dormitory building of the Shanghai Research Institute.

612
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,600
I have a lab there.

613
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,000
You didn't tell me.

614
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,840
I didn't come here often in the past.

615
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,360
Recently, I've been working on a new project

616
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,600
with an observatory.

617
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:23,440
I brought two

618
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,720
research assistants.

619
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,280
Would you like to take a look?

620
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:36,880
Is that okay?

621
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,330
It's not confidential?

622
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,600
Go get changed.

623
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:40,640
Now?

624
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,000
Wait for me.

625
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,760
Find me an empty bag.

626
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,160
I'll put them all in.

627
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:58,120
No need.

628
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,250
I'll just wash them.

As a guest,

630
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,320
I shouldn't cause the host any trouble.

631
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,880
You're not just a guest.

632
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:07,300
I know that.

633
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,240

how could you

637
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,040
let me sleep in your bed?

638
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,360

The workers have spread the word,

675

saying it's a conspiracy by Liu

who's trying to force the factory to close down

00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,160
Okay, this way.

686
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:53,280
If you don't give us

687
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,520
a fair explanation today,

688
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,580
we're not leaving.

689
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:56,960
Yes, we're not leaving.

690
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:57,600
You must give us an explanation.

691
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,320
We've been working here for so many years.

692
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,960
You can't just close the factory.

693
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:00,720
That's right.

694
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,240
We have a whole family to support.

695
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,500
What should we do then?

696
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:05,920
Make way

697
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:06,840
Move! Move!

698
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,080
Our major shareholder is here.

699
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,040
Make way, make way, make way.

700
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,500
Come on, get out of the way.

701
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:11,960
Who's coming?

702
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,450
Mr. Zhou is here.

703
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,290
This is Mr. Zhou.

704
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:18,640
Hi.

705
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,930
I'm Zhousheng Chen.

706
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,920
The Zhou family has just held an investment fair.

707
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,320
You all know that, right?

708
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,120
Even if you don't believe Liu,

709
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,980
you should trust this gentleman.

710
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,000
Who is he?

711
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:29,840
Who is he?

712
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,600
Bring the sewage monitoring report

713
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:35,480
here first.

714
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:39,120
We don't normally use the report.

715
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,000
I don't know where it is.

716
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,140
No sewage inspector here?

717
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,480
Of course there is.

718
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,120
But

719
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,300
one of them is at home having a baby

720
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,480
while the other is away on business.

721
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,960
There's a room full of reports.

722
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,090
It's hard to find it.

723
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,760
Ammonia, nitrogen, PH.

724
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,760
Chromaticity, suspended matter.

725
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:01,840
Documents with these words,

726
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:02,970
bring them all here.

727
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,120
Well.

728
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:08,760
Okay, okay.

729
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,920
What do we call you?

730
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:14,880
Boss?

731
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,080
Don't call me boss.

732
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,680
Just call me Zhousheng Chen.

733
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,560
You know all about

734
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,400
this issue affecting us, right?

735
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:24,500
I just found out today.

736
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,480
How much can you know in only one day?

737
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,520
Why are you here

738
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:30,440
if you're not clear about the situation?

739
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,240
That's right.

740
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,520
You yourselves asked to meet the major shareholder.

741
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,600
Now he's here,

742
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,040
you don't believe him.

743
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:37,960
How many days

744
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,240
have you been blocking Liu's house?

745
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:40,770
Think about it yourselves.

746
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,720
You're so unreasonable.

747
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:46,800
I came here this time

748
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:47,400
hoping

749
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,600
to assure you.

750
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,360
About the accusation this time,

751
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:52,360
as long as you can prove yourselves innocent,

752
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,880
our production won't be impacted.

753
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:56,080
Neither would your reward be impacted.

754
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,360
What if we're not innocent?

755
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,290
What will you do?

756
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,160
Yes.

757
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,440
Yes, yes, yes.

758
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:02,770
Why did you say that?

759
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,400
Say it. Say it.

760
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:06,800
Don't be afraid of them. Say it.

761
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,800
Say it. Say it.

762
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,720
Last year, the district authority requested us

763
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:12,960
to remove all

764
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:16,000
equipment that exceeded the discharge permit.

765
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
We dismantled more than a dozen broken tanks.

766
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,800
But we didn't remove all of them.

767
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:24,920
You mean

768
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,740
you did violate the rules?

769
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:28,040
That's right.

770
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,200
We all know that.

771
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,120
Yes, we all know that.

772
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:33,880
Your family is so powerful.

773
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,410
Figure out a way to solve it.

774
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:36,920
I can't.

775
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:40,840
Why did you come here if you can't handle it?

776
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:41,560
That's right.

777
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:42,280
Am I right?

778
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:43,480
Why are you here?

779
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:44,680
If there are violations,

780
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:46,480
you must follow the procedures.

781
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:47,840
The person in charge of the factory should write

782
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:48,880
and sign a self-investigation report,

783
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,360
then voluntarily accept the penalty.

784
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:51,560
Starting from today,

785
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,800
the entire factory will be suspended until this is rectified.
