[Episode 3]

4
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,520
It feels like I'm in a fantasy world,

5
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,100
coming here abruptly at midnight like this.

6
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,600
You said you liked classical novels.

7
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,320
So I figured

8
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,420
you would like this kind of place.

9
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,520
I do like them.

10
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,320
But I read them

11
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,900
as a collection of novels.

12
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,720
Some people like to read modern novels

13
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,280
while others like to read classical ones.

14
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,680
It's just a matter of personal preference.

15
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,600
I think we

16
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,920
have some things in common.

17
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,520
For example?

18
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,280
For example,

19
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,720
I like to collect Wu Ge's embroidery.

20
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,760
Wu Ge contains many erotic songs

21
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,340
and poems about what happens in the bedroom.

22
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,690
I don't think they are the same.

23
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,480
By the way,

24
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,160
is it hard

25
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,600
doing experiments?

26
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,000
It's all right.

27
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,400
It depends on the project.

28
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,240
Some are harder.

29
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,040
Some of the raw materials

30
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,600
come in big bags.

31
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,560
So students need to

32
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,720
carry them to the lab themselves.

33
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,860
That sounds like a lot of work.

34
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,579
That's how it was when I was a student.

35
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,890
There were actually worse things.

36
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,040
But

37
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,720
I enjoyed it all.

38
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,360
This is your Steamed Drunken Crabs.

39
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,560
We didn't order this.

40
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,560
Today is our restaurant's anniversary.

41
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,640
This is on the house.

42
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,760
Enjoy your meal.

43
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,079
Thank you.

44
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,280
Hairy crabs in this season

45
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,280
are the best.

46
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:24,920
Here.

47
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,920
I don't eat this.

48
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,960
You don't eat crab?

49
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,000
I used to.

50
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:32,320
Not anymore.

51
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:34,840
All right.

52
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,079
Let's eat.

53
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,560
I've arrived.

54
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,080
I'll be going back and forth

55
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,520
between Shanghai and Zhenjiang

56
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,850
for these three months.

57
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,440
Zhenjiang?

58
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,380
What's the matter?

59
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,400
My ancestral home is Zhenjiang.

60
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,370
What a coincidence.

61
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,080
Yes, how coincidental.

62
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,080
The number in your phone…

63
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:48,960
You can reach me anytime

64
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,440
you want.

65
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,440
I'm going up then.

66
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,600
Go on.

67
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,100
Good night.

68
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,180
Good night.

♫The day we met♫

70
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,200
♫Time froze♫

71

♫It's your smiling eyes♫

72
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,320
♫That made the hustle and bustle of the world gone♫

73
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:38,050
♫Every moment♫

74
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:43,900
♫Drives away the weariness of the past♫

75

00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:54,610
♫Love gets deeper♫

♫Making it a poem♫

♫Give you my true love♫

88
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,680
I didn't realize

89
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,640
you had a close lady friend.

90
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:24,150
♫Thank you for being there♫

91
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,840
She's just a regular friend.

92
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,360
Yes, an important regular friend.

93
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,800
Xiaoyu, breakfast is ready.

94
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:57,360
You said he asked you out at 11:00

95
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,080
last night?

96
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,040
Had supper at 1:00.

97
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,180
And then sent you home at 2:00?

98
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:03,720
Is he not afraid

99
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,580
you'll think of him as a hooligan?

100
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,400
If it was anyone else, I wouldn't have agreed to it.

101
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,240
But since it was him,

102
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,640
there was nothing strange.

103
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,280
He used to answer my emails in the middle of the night.

104
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,080
I'm used to it.

105
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,320
How long will he stay in Zhenjiang this time?

106
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,000
What for?

107
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,850
I didn't ask him.

108
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,000
Probably a business trip.

109
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,320
But they're treated nicely this time.

110
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,840
They got him a car and a driver.

111
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,960
That's because of work.

112
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,040
He doesn't own it.

113
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:28,840
But he should be able to afford a car

114
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,160
with his age.

115
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,480
I'm not sure

116
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,730
if he can afford to buy a house, though.

117
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,970
But you have a house.

118
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,040
After you get married,

119
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,040
you guys can move in together for a while.

120
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,900
I'll have to find a new place then.

121
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,400
So far I've only

122
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,280
had dinner with him once.

123
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,920
If there is a first time, there is a second time.

124
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,440
If there is a second time,

125
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,770
there will be countless times after that.

126
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,680
Anyway, let me know in advance

127
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,280
if you two are going to live together,

128
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,610
so I can find a new place.

129
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,580
Do you have some loose screws?

130
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,680
Yeah.

131
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,640
That's why I'm still single.

132
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,960
Eat your food.

133
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,610
I'm so scared that I can't hold my chopsticks.

134
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,100
You sure you don't want to ride a bit more?

135
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,080
Where on earth did you go last night?

136
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,890
Coming back until the morning.

137
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,320
I had a midnight supper.

138
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,000
With a girl?

139
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,040
If it was a man,

140
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,880
you would have asked me to join you.

141
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,039
Yes, with a girl.

142
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,000
Another one?

143
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,440
The same one.

144
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,159
Shi Yi?

145
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,800
It's a nice day today.

146
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,480
I'll take you to some of the workshops

147
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,880
later on.

148
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,050
They were left by my father before.

149
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,700
Aren't they far from here?

150
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,720
Not too far and not too close.

151
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,960
Is there enough time for you to tell me

152
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,360
about Miss Shi Yi?

153
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,960
Well, I'm afraid not.

154
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:07,800
Give me something.

155
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,460
A brief introduction will do.

156
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,040
A few words won't do.

157
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:15,920
Come on, man.

158
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,250
Let's go.

159
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:52,840
Well,

160
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,500
your brother is going to get married.

161
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,080
Your brother is in talks with

162
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,540
an overseas water company

163
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,760
and three buildings in Bremen.

164
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,720
The funds required are staggering.

165
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,520
The procurement plan will be completed next month.

166
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,650
You still have time.

167
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,920
You're a professional.

168
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,000
Tell me

169
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,360
what I should do.

170
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,580
Announce that your family

171
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,280
will invest significantly into national industries

172
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,880
and support national manufacturing

173
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,410
in the investment meeting.

174
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,680
Show people that

175
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,400
your family will focus on the domestic market

176
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,720
for the next ten years.

177
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,280
Do this to affect their confidence.

178
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,480
All right.

179
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,040
But at the same time you have to get married.

180
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,570
If you don't get married, it's all empty talk.

181
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,880
Your father wrote

182
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,120
very clearly in his will.

183
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,320
All of his children

184
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,850
will be given corresponding shares after marriage.

185
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,930
There are no exceptions, which means you too.

186
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,320
I know that.

187
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,210
You don't have to emphasize it.

188
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,480
It's just that marriage

189
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,210
is not something

190
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,680
I can decide on my own.

191
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,120
I did some calculations.

192
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,640
If you start seeing

193
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,120
the girl your mother introduced to you from tonight,

194
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,120
you can expect to get married in May.

195
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,640
You're making fun of me, right?

196
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,140
Here, look at these again.

197
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,720
What are these?

198
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,570
Zhou Wenchuan's business.

199
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,940
There's something fishy about them.

200
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,520
You should hurry up and

201
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,250
take back the business at home.

202
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,320
If not,

203
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,480
I'm really afraid

204
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,760
he'll get your entire family involved.

205
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,320
Is there any other way?

206
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,600
Get married first.

207
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,960
I have a suggestion.

208
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,000
What?

209
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,080
Shi Yi.

210
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,840
She likes you.

211
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,940
You have feelings for her too.

212
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,680
I admit it.

213
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,040
She's very special to me.

214
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,280
But don't you think it's ridiculous

215
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,920
if I talk to her

216
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,840
about marriage right now?

217
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,080
Everything I said to you

218
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,520
were not to tease you.

219

They are my sincere advice.

I haven't seen you for a while.

Have a seat.

233

Auntie said you just came back from Germany.

234
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,600
Yes.

235
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,160
I studied in Europe too.

236
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,780
You won't go back to Germany anymore, right?

237
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,800
That's right.

238
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,240
Since you're staying for good,

239
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,240
won't the lab

What's the matter?

243
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,040
I'm having troubles solving some questions

244
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,970
and I would like my brother to help.

Go ahead.

246
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,840

show you around.

Okay.

Come, this way please.

[Shi Yi's personal information]

255
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,280
Actually, ever since you met her

256
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,540
at Guangzhou Airport,

257
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,760
our whole family has found out about it.

258
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,500
Mother knew about her too.

259
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,320
Who gave this to you?

260
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,240
Someone close to my father.

261
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,080
You know,

262
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,100
I'm his only son

263
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,240
and I'm naughty,

264
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,820
so I always get what I want.

265
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,320
You're so lucky.

266
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,520
She's so pretty.

267
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,140
And she's a celebrity too.

268
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,320
She is…

269
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,920
She is just one of my

270
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,140
ordinary friends.

271
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,660
Okay then, I'll leave now.

272
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,880
Chen, you're going out?

273
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,520
I've met her twice,

274
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,040
the girl mom introduced to you.

275
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,120
She's nice.

276
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,680
But she's even younger than me.

277
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,040
So it feels weird calling her elder sister-in-law.

278
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:32,920
If she's someone nice,

279
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:35,120
I shouldn't stop her from finding someone better.

280

No.

00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,040
I have some rubbing alcohol and cotton swabs here.

347
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,560
You can clean the wound first.

348
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,200
Thank you.

349
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,080
It's okay.

350
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:47,400
Well.

351
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,600
I can do it myself.

352
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,480
Don't mind me.

353
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,640
Be safe, then.

354
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,680
Okay, thanks.

355
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,400
It's okay.

356
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,520
Are you okay?

357
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,160
Yes, I'm fine.

358
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,220
Should I take you to the hospital?

359
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,120
Uncle Lin, take him to the hospital.

360
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,020
No, no, no, it's not appropriate.

361
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,040
I'm fine on my own.

362
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,160
I don't want to cause you trouble.

363
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,090
I'm free anyway.

364
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,200
I'll be glad to help you.

365
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:49,640
Okay.

366
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,200
Sir, you're a funny guy.

367
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,720
Is this your car?

368
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,400
It's his.

369
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,520
I wanted to take a walk

370
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,600
and didn't feel like taking the car.

371
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,720
You should hurry up.

372
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,760
Go to the hospital.

373
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,160
You're wounded so badly.

374
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,520
Thank you.

375
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,520
It's okay.

376
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,160
Thank you.

377
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:07,800
It's fine.

378
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,280
The girl who helped you just now

379
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,560
is his girlfriend.

380
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,080
No wonder.

381
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,960
They're both so kind-hearted.

382
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:19,600
Get in.

383
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,240
Thank you.

384
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,720
Take it easy.

385
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:23,960
Thank you.

386
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:06,520
Remember

387
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,320
to finish the milk in the fridge.

388
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,040
By the way, I know you're going back to Zhenjiang to pay homage to your ancestors.

389
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,520
But would you go look for him?

390
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,200
He didn't give me

391
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,400
his own phone number.

392
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,760
It'll be weird to call him.

393
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,960
I don't think it's a good idea.

394
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,360
And people usually gather with their families

395
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,620
on Qingming Festival.

396
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,120
It's not a good time to ask him out.

397
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,240
Make some time out.

398
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,410
Let's talk about it when I get back.

399
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,120
He should be more proactive.

400
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,960
Wasn't he proactive to ask me out for dinner

401
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,960
in the middle of the night last time?

402
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,090
I guess that counts.

403
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,960
Since he took the initiative last time,

404
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,000
I've decided to do something for him.

405
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:38,930
When I come back,

406
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,520
I'll treat him to dinner.

407
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,240
Then we'll be even.

408
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,880
Have a meal.

409
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,000
Talk about family, career, and friends.

410
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,600
Then after dinner, take a walk along the river.

411
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,960
When walking, get closer to each other.

412
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,360
Casually touch his hand a few times.

413
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,040
Be casual about it.

414
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,640
Then casually hold his hand

415
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,240
and finally close your eyes.

416
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,560
You and your wild imaginations.

417
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,880
I only talk about it.

418
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:08,720
But that's what you want

419
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,560
to do in your mind, right?

420
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,920
Did you go looking for Shi Yi?

421
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:37,360
Yes.

422
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,340
Had supper with her again?

423
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,040
I didn't see her.

424
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,210
What were you doing there then?

425
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,760
You didn't just wait for her

426
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,320
downstairs, right?

427
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,760
I was downstairs.

428
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,280
I wanted to make sure...

429
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,760
I had feelings for her.

430
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,040
And how did you test that?

431
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,720
If I'll get bored

432
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,800
going back and forth for eight hours again

433
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,120
for her.

434
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,250
And the answer is...

435
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,200
I enjoyed every second of it.

436
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,940
You're finally admitting it.

437
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,200
So what's next?

438
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,650
What are you going to do?

439
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,880
Next, I'm going to

440
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,520
propose to her.

441
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,320
You've been checking your phone

442
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,040
constantly

443
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,000
after we left Shanghai.

444
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,600
Is it work related?

445
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,680
I have a friend in Zhenjiang.

446
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,970
I'm wondering if I should contact him.

447
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,370
We have nothing to do

448
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,840
after visiting the grave.

449
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,040
If you want to see your friend, go ahead.

450
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,640
He might not be in Zhenjiang.

451
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,600
He might have gone back to his hometown.

452
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,530
You can't call him and ask him that?

453
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,520
Do you feel embarrassed to ask this person?

454
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,400
Mom!

455
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,480
Fine, I won't interfere.

456
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,520
I'm not against you having friends.

457
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,000
But if

458
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,160
you want to have a boyfriend,

459
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,360
you must bring him to see me.

460
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,090
I have to help you check him out.

461
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,840
You're going too far.

462
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,080
Your mother

463
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,010
is sometimes very conflicted.

464
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,200
She's afraid that you'll have too high of a standard

465
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,440
and won't be able to get married.

466
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,520
However, she's also afraid that

467
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,920
you'll get cheated

468
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:30,880
by those

469
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,600
powerful and influential people

470
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,640
since you're so beautiful

471
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,370
and end up doing something bad.

472
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:36,640
No, I wouldn't.

473
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,880
I am not interested in money.

474
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,340
I won't be seduced by that.

475
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,640
Here are the agreements you want.

476
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,840
You drew them up so quickly?

477
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,960
I have a template.

478
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:48,580
[Pre-Nuptial Agreement]

479
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:50,700
[Whereas both parties are about to register their marriage and become legally married, according to the Marriage Act...]

480
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:58,940
[Full section]

481
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,760
Miss Shi Yi has come to Zhenjiang.

482
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,620
They just passed the checkpoint.

483
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,560
How do you two keep bumping into each other?

484
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,960
She's here in Zhenjiang.

485
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,700
Why not tell her in person?

486
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,120
Let's go home first.

487
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,320
What?

488
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,520
Afraid you'll get rejected?

489
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,360
How much do you think

490
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,520
the probability of success is

491
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,040
if you're asked to propose to a girl

492
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,480
you've only been

493
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,760
on one date with?

494
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,360
That depends on how charming you are.

495
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,480
Are there so many people visiting the graves this year?

496
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,680
We've been stuck in traffic for an hour already.

497
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:11,340
I don't think they're all going for that reason.

498
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,880
I heard from Shi Feng that many entrepreneurs

499
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:14,800
have been going in and out of Zhenjiang

500
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,600
in the past two days.

501
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,800
They say it's about investing in projects.

502
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,680
Maybe that's why.

503
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,040
There are investment projects here?

504
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,700
How come I haven't heard of it?

505
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,920
They're not investing in Zhenjiang.

506
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,760
There is a conference

507
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,180
that's being held here

508
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,400
meaning to attract investment

509
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:34,730
and support the local high-end manufacturing industries.

510
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,650
Doing business abroad has been

511
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,610
pretty risky this couple of years.

512
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,840
So the upgrade of the manufacturing sector

513
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,000
is sure to come.

514
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,160
In other words, the development of the high-end manufacturing industry

515
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,760
would be the top priority in the next few years.

516
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,400
Shi, you've said so much.

517
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,600
But what does it have to do with traffic jams?

518
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,560
Well,

519
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,240
they've invited rich businessmen

520
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,400
to invest here.

521
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,410
The people who invited them have a vision.

522
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,400
Not only that,

523
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,880
they also have to be capable

524
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,920
in order to attract more capital.

525
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,520
They also need to have a kind heart,

526
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,180
to help the national economy.

527
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,760
Yes, a kind heart.

528
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,440
As expected of a father and daughter,

529
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,370
you two are always on the same page.

530
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,000
The son of an old friend of mine

531
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,840
is also here

532
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,360
for this investment meeting.

533
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,400
He wants to take this opportunity

534
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,800
to learn from his father.

535
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:52,920
I've met

536
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:53,860
his son before.

537
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:54,920
Okay.

538
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,520
You're not getting to the point.

539
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,080
Your uncle

540
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,720
is inviting him to dinner tomorrow night.

541
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,280
You should go too.

542
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,320
Get to know them.

543
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,520
I don't think I'll go.

544
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,120
Go and get to know each other.

545
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,450
You guys can be friends.

546
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:08,920
That's right.

547
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:09,920
What do you think?

548
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,120
After getting his master's degree,

549
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,320
he joined his family's business.

550
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,320
He's a practical person.

551
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,180
He worked his way up as a sales rep.

552
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:15,960
He's not

553
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,520
arrogant at all.

554
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,600
It's a shell company.

555
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,080
A shell company?

556
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:22,840
No, no, no.

557
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,800
I used the wrong expression.

558
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:27,130
It's a company that produces briefcases.

559
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,560
That's right.

560
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,480
And...

561
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,760
he's also

562
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:32,720
going to that investment meeting.

563
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,650
If you have time,

564
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,880
you could come with me.

565
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,520
I'll introduce you to each other.

566
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,180
Take a look.

567
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:38,840
I'll take a look at it later.

568
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,370
I'll go see Yuanyuan first.

569
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,400
Zhenjiang has changed so much.

570
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,480
Don't go.

571
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,440
That man is not handsome enough.

572
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,880
Little girl.

573
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,720
What are you thinking about?

574
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,360
I'm thinking is it too noisy here

575
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,680
to make a phone call?

576
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:28,520
Noisy?

577
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,520
How is this place noisy?

578
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,120
Uncle Lin.

579
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,600
Let me use your phone.

580
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:56,560
Thank you.

581
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,280
What's so funny?

582
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:04,960
Make the call.

583
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,840
I'd better do this in my room.

584
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,010
It's quieter there.

585
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,040
He's making it so tense.

586
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,450
He's just cautious.

587
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,320
Hello?

588
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,680
Hello? It's me.

589
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:16,720
I know.

590
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,720
You're in Zhenjiang.

591
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,240
How do you know?

592
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,160
I found out

593
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,760
right after you passed the checkpoint.

594
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,760
Checkpoint?

595
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:32,200
I think you should have heard

596
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:35,160
about the special event that's being held in Zhenjiang.

597
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,560
That's why they are registering

598
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,760
the cars entering and leaving the city.

599
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,520
I heard about it.

600
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,440
There is an investment meeting.

601
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,000
That's right.

602
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:51,080
I have the information about your family.

603
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,400
I checked with the people at the checkpoint just now

604
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,600
and confirmed it was your father's car.

605
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,560
I'll explain this

606
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,320
to you when we see each other.

607
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,680
Right now,

608
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,760
I have something to ask you.

609
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:07,960
Go ahead.

610
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,600
I need to

611
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,380
get engaged to someone right now.

612
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,560
Miss Shi Yi.

613
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,199
Are you his girlfriend?

614
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,360
Don't talk nonsense.

615
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,320
I heard that Mr. Zhousheng

616
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,480
has a fiancee.

617
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:32,639
So, it's all true.

618
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,280
He does have a fiancee.

619
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:37,639
Then why did he ask me out?

620
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:38,840
What kind of man is he!

621
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,080
Shi Yi.

622
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:50,520
Thank you

623
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:51,840
for telling me that.

624
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,380
I hope the two of you will be happy.

625
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,320
That's not what I mean.

626
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,120
What I'm trying to say is,

627
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:04,840
Shi Yi,

628
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,980
would you like to be engaged to me?

629
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:20,560
Shi Yi.

630
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,120
What you're saying is...

631
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,560
What I said is true.

632
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,240
We're not

633
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,240
strangers anymore

634
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,000
and we have feelings for

635
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,480
each another.

636
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,280
Maybe we can get engaged and give it a go.

What is it?

677
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,440
You know about my family.

Of course I'm not.

723
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:30,880
Okay.

724
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,240
So what do we do next?

725
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,360
What's going on?

726
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,780
Who are you engaged to?

727
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,200
Next,

728
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:45,600
can you tell me

729
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,720
your body measurements?

730
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,280
I need to get you

731
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,530
some clothes later.

732
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:59,440
92, 62, 90.

733
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,840
This, this is?

734
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,840
My BWH.

735
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,640
I got it.

736
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,160
Could you give me a second?

737
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,660
I can't believe I said yes.

738
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,760
I may also need to know

739
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:33,400
your neck circumference, the measurements of your upper arm,

740
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:37,600
forearm, wrist, calve, thigh

741
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,600
and ankles.

742
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,280
Then I'll come back to you

743
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,680
when I'm done measuring.

744
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:46,520
Okay.

745
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,880
I'm impressed.

746
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,400
When did you come up?

747
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,640
Trust me.

748
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:16,600
If a girl

749
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,320
agrees to become your fiancee,

750
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,840
she must like you.

751
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,080
You're good, Professor.

752
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,840
The first time you called, you had a midnight supper.

753
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:32,300
The second time you called, you asked for her hand in marriage.

754
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,440
You are

755
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:35,960
efficient,

756
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,080
just like your experiments.

757
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:39,560
Didn't we communicate with each other

758
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:42,280
with email for six months already?

759
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:46,200
Are you trying to convince yourself?

760
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:48,680
She already said yes.

761
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:49,620
Mr. Zhousheng.

762
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,320
You have to believe in yourself.

763
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,440
You have your charms.

764
00:40:58,800 --> 00:40:59,440
Really?

765
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,530
Where are you going?

766
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,360
To prepare a gift for her parents tomorrow.

767
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,480
Shi Yi.

768
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,840
This must be the biggest gossip in the world.

769
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:19,560
You haven't told me yet

770
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,880
but my heart is already racing!

771
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,320
Give me a break.

772
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,360
If you don't tell me,

773
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:25,820
I'll open the door and announce the news now.

774
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,480
My parents don't know about this yet.

775
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,960
They'll find out eventually.

776
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:29,800
I didn't tell them

777
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:30,800
I had a boyfriend.

778
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,120
Someone's being bold.

779
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,850
Are you doing a flash marriage?

780
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:36,930
I don't think it's that.

781
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,080
We've known each other for six months already.

782
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:38,940
What does he do?

783
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:39,800
Is he handsome?

784
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:40,960
How did you meet him?

785
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,280
Let me think about

786
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:45,520
how to explain this to my parents, okay?

787
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,920
This is so exciting.

788
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,920
There are her parents,

789
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,840
uncle, aunt

790
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,160
and a cousin.

791
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:10,760
Uncle Lin, could you help me

792
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,000
pick a gift

793
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,400
that's appropriate?

794
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,320
You've come to the right person for that.

795
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,160
Although Uncle Lin had a relationship in the past,

796
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,640
I never had to give a bride price

797
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:21,040
to her father.

798
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:24,400
Clearly, I didn't ask

799
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:26,080
the right person.

800
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,560
I'm just kidding.

801
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,120
The older, the wiser.

802
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,200
Let's go upstairs.

803
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,600
I will help you choose something. Let's go.

804
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:39,080
Mom.

805
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:39,960
Sit down

806
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,760
Are you hiding something from me?

807
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:42,290
Sit down.

808
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,360
Classes have been tough lately, right?

809
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:48,690
I'll give you a massage.

810
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,080
I know what you're up to.

811
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:51,140
Tell me, what is it?

812
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,200
I've got a boyfriend.

813
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:00,170
The one you mentioned this afternoon?

814
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:06,520
He just proposed to me.

815
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:10,720
What?

816
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,240
Didn't you two just start dating?

817
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:15,640
Yes.

818
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:17,880
But he really wanted to get engaged.

819
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,040
I said yes.

820
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,040
Shi Yi.

821
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:25,120
I really don't know

822
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:26,240
what to say.

823
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:28,400
Have you given it some thought?

824
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:31,080
I don't know.

825
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:32,720
I just wanted to say yes.

826
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,000
He sounded very sincere

827
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,320
when he proposed just now.

828
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:36,320
I was shocked too.

829
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:39,080
I didn't think he would suddenly propose to me.

830
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:40,040
Fine.

831
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:41,410
I can see that

832
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:42,560
you like him.

833
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,920
But what's the rush?

834
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:46,650
I really don't understand.

835
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:48,640
Can't you two take time?

836
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:52,440
I don't know how to explain it to you.

837
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:54,080
Mom.

838
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:55,410
You should meet him.

839
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,240
You'll like him when you see him.

840
00:43:58,400 --> 00:43:58,960
Yeah,

841
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:00,520
of course I'll meet him!

842
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:02,480
What's his name?

843
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:03,240
What does he do?

844
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,600
His name is Zhousheng Chen.

845
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:05,480
He's an associate professor.

846
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:06,540
He's under thirty.

847
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:08,980
What about his family?

848
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:10,280
And what do his parents do?

849
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:11,410
Where are they from?

850
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:12,640
From Zhenjiang.

851
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:13,240
Same as us.

852
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:14,720
You little rascal.

853
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,880
You didn't tell me about it this afternoon.

854
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:18,160
This afternoon,

855
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,160
I didn't expect

856
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:21,580
he would propose to me.

857
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:23,120
So I didn't say anything.

858
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:30,600
Well.

859
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,480
Since he's here,

860
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:34,540
let's meet him here

861
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:36,180
and have dinner together.

862
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,000
But I should warn you

863
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:38,800
we have to have another discussion

864
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,560
after we've met with him.

865
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:41,600
You hear?

866
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:44,400
He said he would come tomorrow.

867
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:48,680
This guy.

868
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,280
Is he really in such a hurry?
