6
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,630
You are drinking alone?

7
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,300
Want some?

8
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,660
No, thanks.

9
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,140
What's up?

10
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:46,620
Nothing.

11
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:50,740
Then why are you constantly staring at your phone?

12
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,700
I sent Shi Yi a text,

13
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,280
yet she hasn't responded.

14
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,430
Why don't you just call her?

15
00:03:58,940 --> 00:03:59,980
She's in sleep,

16
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,840
I am afraid I will disturb her.

You two

18
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:10,020
are too polite to be a couple.

19
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,350
Shi Yi went to the hospital.

20
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:30,530
Give me the car key.

21
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,060
Why do you want the key?

22
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:33,290

Are you okay?

27
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,120
Let's go.

Why did you bring Wang Yingdong here?

29
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,960
We were at the same party just now.

30
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:06,060
I was drunk, so I was unable to drive.

31
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,660
He knew that I was coming for you

32
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,700
and never gave me a chance to say no.

33
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:13,620
Well, put this under your wrist.

34
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,440
Where did you get this?

35
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,590
I bought it downstairs.

36
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:20,020
No, thanks. I am good, I am not feeling cold.

37
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,990
Well, then you take care of her.

38
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,340
Okay, I got it.

I'll go get the nurse.

I had feelings for him if I used it.

You are very good at keeping the right distance, huh?

47

Of course.

60
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,780

Did you come here together?

65
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,620
I was afraid he might get distracted

66
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:40,900
due to his worry about you,

67
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,020
so I came along.

68
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,140
And I happen to have an old friend

00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,940
that I'll go visit in Shanghai tomorrow.

We gotta go.

Can you accompany her throughout the night?

72
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:57,560
Is that even a question?

73
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:58,620
I am her husband.

If I don't keep her company, who else will?

75

Here's the thing.

76
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,340
We know that you are usually very busy.

77
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,200
As her friends,

78
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:09,680
we will definitely come here for her, right?

79
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:10,340
Thank you.

00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:13,590
Bye.

82
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:14,140
Bye.

83
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,180
Then I am leaving too.

Where are you going?

85
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,500
You two have made it to see each other,

86
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,940
which means my job is done.

87
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,540
I am going somewhere for fun.

88
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:31,510
Bye.

89
00:07:42,909 --> 00:07:44,240
Why is your hand so cold?

90
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,060
The hospital Wenxing often goes to

91
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:52,940
is near here.

92
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,640
Do I need to take you there?

93
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,740
The doctors there will be better.

94
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:58,820
I am too tired to move.

95
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:04,420
I didn't know

96
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,640
Wang Yingdong would come here today.

97
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,110
Are you jealous?

98
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:13,540
No.

99
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:17,780
Get closer to me.

100
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:20,860
Closer.

101
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:22,800
Come on.

102
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,100
I will do it when we go home.

103
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:47,920
Wait a minute for me.

104
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:49,180
I will be right back.

105
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:51,340
Stay here.

106
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,060
Hi, I'm wondering

107
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,700
how long it will take

108
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:13,700
before she can go home?

109
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,660
Your wife is Shi Yi, right?

110
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:16,780
That's right.

111
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:21,340
At least three hours.

112
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,940
Are there any wards available here?

113
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:28,060
They've already been occupied.

114
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:29,380
Thank you.

115
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:44,860
Hello.

116
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,350
This is Zhousheng Chen.

117
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,340
Help me book a ward

118
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:49,220
near the Central Hospital.

119
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:51,180
Thanks.

120
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:55,780
I am only here

121
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,420
to get some tea today.

122
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:00,020
I never expected to see you coming for me.

123
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,020
This is a very remote area

124
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:02,460
where it's difficult to get a cab.

125
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,700
How are you gonna go back

126
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:04,820
if you get drunk?

127
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:07,820
Let's drink first

128
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:09,980
and not talk about future for now

129
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:10,980
Right.

130
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,460
If you overdrink,

131
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,700
there's a staff dormitory here.

132
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:17,580
Great alcohol.

133
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,500
Take it slowly.

134
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:19,660
The heated alcohol

135
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,260
is easy to make people drunk.

136
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:29,020
What's the matter? You have something in mind?

137
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:32,180
Grown-ups

138
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,020
all have something in mind

139
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:36,020
that they find it hard to talk about.

140
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:38,740
That's right.

141
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:40,150
Here.

142
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:48,260
I don't have a lot of friends here

143
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:52,140
and I am afraid that I would say something wrong if I get drunk.

144
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:54,050
So I couldn't come to those I am familiar with either.

145
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:56,530
That's why you are here for me?

146
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,100
Okay, okay.

147
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,660
Isn't it good that I could go home to sleep

148
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:10,980
after getting 3 to 4 hours of infusion

149
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,300
over there?

150
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,660
Your husband cares about you.

151
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:15,740
Isn't it better to have a ward?

152
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:17,340
So that you can sleep whenever you want.

153
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,220
Take a good rest.

154
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:18,820
Thank you.

155
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:26,900
Go have a rest now, it's over 10 pm now.

156
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:31,340
Sit down.

157
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:33,780
Sit here.

158
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:36,840
You are not sleepy?

159
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:37,820
No.

160
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,540
I have to chat with you.

161
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:42,660
All right, go ahead.

162
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:45,620
I am a patient, you want me to talk?

163
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:49,780
Okay, then I will be the one to speak.

164
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:54,870
What do you want to hear?

165
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:00,100
Describe what was on your mind when you felt jealous just now.

166
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,460
Just tell me about it.

167
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,260
Not feeling well.

168
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,020
And?

169
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,670
It's just not feeling well.

170
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,420
Don't put me off.

171
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:21,000
Did you fail your Chinese tests when you were young?

172
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:24,020
I was not bad at Chinese,

173
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,200
although I never got a full mark.

174
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:29,190
Who could get a full mark in Chinese tests?

175
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:31,420
Do you actually know

176
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,960
what it means to be modest?

177
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,580
For those I am not good at,

178
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:37,910
I am always very modest.

179
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:40,140
What about those you specialize in?

180
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,980
In the fields where I specialize,

181
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:43,540
modesty leads to fear.

182
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:46,070
It will stop people from making progress.

183
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,340
That's way off the point.

184
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,340
You brought it up first.

185
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,220
All right, my fault.

186
00:12:58,380 --> 00:12:59,740
Go on.

187
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,100
Talk about how you feel about jealousy.

188
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,750
Where are you going?

189
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,020
Your question is pretty tough to answer.

190
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:11,860
I need more time

191
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:12,980
to think about it.

192
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,300
How's the water temperature?

193
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,230
The water you fetched must be warm.

194
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:33,700
You see, you are such a grown-up,

195
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,900
yet you still want me to take care of you.

196
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:36,500
How about me helping you

197
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,700
wash your feet later?

198
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:38,920
No need for that.

199
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:40,320
Lin Fei.

200
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:50,060
It's late at night, what's going on?

201
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,380
Why are you not sleeping?

202
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:52,420
Me Xing overdrank

203
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,060
in the tea plant on the outskirt.

204
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:54,660
Would you mind

205
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:55,920
helping me pick him up?

206
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,020
No, not at all.

207
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:57,860
It's just overdrinking.

208
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:58,900
Lin Fei, hurry up and go pick him up.

209
00:13:58,900 --> 00:13:59,780
Okay, no problem.

210
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:00,710
Needless to say,

211
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,140
I won't feel easy if this was handed to others.

212
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:02,940
Hurry up.

213
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:14,670
Slowly, slowly.

214
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:16,660
I am sorry to bother you today.

215
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:17,220
Mr. Zhao.

216
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:18,540
Don't mention it.

217
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,180
It was my fault as well.

218
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:22,740
I shouldn't have given him so much to drink.

219
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:24,040
Uncle Zhao.

220
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,210
I am not drunk.

221
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,820
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you are not, you are not.

222
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:28,540
Let's keep drinking.

223
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:30,300
-Go on.
-Let's keep drinking after getting in the car.

224
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,100
Be careful.

225
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:31,700
Let's go.

226
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:32,160
Slowly.

227
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:34,460
Watch out, watch out.

228
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:37,820
Yeah, okay.

229
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:45,190
Sorry to trouble you, Mr. Zhao.

230
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:48,500
Now go.

231
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,830
Okay, we are leaving, Mr. Zhao.

232
00:14:58,010 --> 00:14:59,000
Drive slowly.

233
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:00,310
Be careful.

234
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,040
Get off the car.

235
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:21,820
Get off the car.

236
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:22,680
Get off the car.

237
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,470
Don't dilly-dally.

238
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:27,200
Get all of your

239
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:27,900
valuable stuff out.

240
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:28,620
Bro.

241
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:29,980
I didn't take anything

242
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,260
valuable with me today.

243
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:31,860
Cut the crap.

244
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,060
Now, take it out.

245
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,240
I only have this watch

246
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,210
with me.

247
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:39,660
You can have it.

248
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:40,740
Anything else?

249
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:41,580
I, I

250
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,060
have nothing else to give you.

251
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:43,860
Nothing else?

252
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:18,530
What are you doing?

253
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:20,620
What are you doing?

254
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,940
Mind your own business.

255
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,000
What are you doing?

256
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:28,290
-Go.
-Go.

257
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:29,570
Go.

258
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:39,620
Mr. Mei.

259
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:40,840
Uncle Lin.

260
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,460
What's going on here?

261
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:43,740
They are robbers.

262
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:48,510
Do we need to call the police?

263
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:51,620
No.

264
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:53,700
My father doesn't want me

265
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,760
to get involved in the business here.

266
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:58,060
It would be more of a trouble if he knew this.

267
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,630
Don't tell anybody what happened today.

268
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:00,830
Including my father.

269
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:02,060
But...

270
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,940
But if we don't call the police.

271
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:06,900
What if it was not a robbery?

272
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,900
Didn't you get beaten for no reason?

273
00:17:12,619 --> 00:17:13,380
I know whom to blame

274
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,619
for this.

275
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:18,500
All right, let's go home first.

276
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,800
No, I'm not going home.

277
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,030
How about hospital?

278
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:24,190
Just to tell our family about it.

279
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:25,790
Wenxing is mousy,

280
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:28,140
she would be more worried

281
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,020
if she sees what I look like right now.

282
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:31,480
Let's go dress the wounds.

283
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:32,640
All right.

284
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,300
Slowly.

285
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,590
You drive that car home.

286
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:37,700
I will take him to the hospital.

287
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:38,100
Okay.

288
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:38,780
Slowly.

289
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:40,210
Here.

290
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:50,940
You are back.

291
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:54,140
Where is Mei Xing?

292
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,820
He drank too much

293
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:58,980
and let nobody touch him,

294
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,380
so he went to sleep there.

295
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,710
Uncle Lin went to find you, did you see him?

296
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:04,870
Yeah, we did.

297
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:06,950
He is with him there.

298
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,720
Thank you for tonight.

299
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:10,940
I have to go now.

300
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,060
Zhousheng Chen.

301
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:47,340
Are you sleep walking?

302
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:52,270
You haven't fallen asleep yet?

303
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,660
I did, and now I am awake.

304
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:57,820
I walked around

305
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:58,700
your bed

306
00:19:58,860 --> 00:19:59,980
and I noticed the central air-conditioner

307
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,940
is blowing right towards your legs and feet.

308
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:02,860
I am afraid you might catch a cold,

309
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:04,780
so I went to turn up

310
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:05,820
the heat.

311
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:08,860
I have the quilt on me, the cold air won't get me.

312
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,000
You like to kick the quilt.

313
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:13,860
Nonsense.

314
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,440
I never do.

315
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:26,270
I just realized marriage is pretty good.

316
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,460
You just realized

317
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:35,220
how good it is to get married?

318
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:37,900
I have been to hospital alone

319
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,500
ever since I started to work.

320
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:41,260
I would feel sorry

321
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:43,380
if I had to bother my friends

322
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,100
as they needed to work the next morning.

323
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,620
If I asked my parents to come with me,

324
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,220
I would be afraid they would get too worried.

325
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,060
What about you?

326
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,860
Who would go to a doctor with you?

327
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:53,380
I have always been alone.

328
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,660
Only when I had a minor surgery

329
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,990
that I asked my classmate to go with me.

330
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:00,350
Didn't your family accompany you?

331
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:01,900
They didn't know.

332
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:03,500
Well, why didn't you ask someone from the corporate

333
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,300
to come along?

334
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,820
I didn't know them at that time.

335
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:10,980
No wonder

336
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:13,180
the driver in Bremen said

337
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:15,380
he had never seen you in the company.

338
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:17,660
I didn't have to.

339
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,860
I was not interested anyway.

340
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:22,620
Then who would drive for you?

341
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,750
You were not good at driving, were you?

342
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:28,660
It only takes ten minutes

343
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,380
from my institute to the apartment on foot.

344
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:31,640
I didn't need to drive.

345
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,740
Well, there were definitely occasions

346
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:35,200
when you need them, right?

347
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:36,170
When you need to go to the supermarket

348
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:37,710
and buy some food or daily essentials,

349
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:39,570
a car is handy for carrying stuff.

350
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:40,620
Whether they are food

351
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:41,980
or daily essentials,

352
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,840
my institute has got them all.

353
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:45,740
You are the one

354
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:47,860
with the least requirements for your life

355
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:49,390
among all the people I know.

356
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,040
What a couple,

357
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,720
you guys have been talking since the moment you moved in

358
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,240
and you are still talking once she woke up in the middle of night.

359
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,870
What a great relationship you have.

360
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:57,860
You don't feel uncomfortable, right?

361
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:58,380
No.

362
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:00,620
The lady's husband.

363
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,260
Our patient needs to rest.

364
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,060
Time to sleep.

365
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,200
Then I'll go to bed.

366
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:18,750
Good night.

367
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:20,060
Good night.

368
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:36,660
I can't fall asleep.

369
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:44,980
Zhousheng Chen.

370
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:48,060
Can you talk with me a little bit longer?

371
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:53,520
Professor Zhousheng?

372
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,680
Mr. Zhousheng?

373
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:00,780
Zhousheng Chen.

374
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:05,210
Fell asleep so soon?

375
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,760
Why did you come down here?

376
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:34,510
I can't fall asleep if you are not holding me in your arms.

377
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,280
Go sleep on the bed.

378
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,380
I want to sleep here.

379
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:47,220
All right.

380
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:54,300
Good night.

381
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:56,310
Good night.

382
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,050
Why is your face black and blue?

383
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:45,840
I accidentally fell down.

384
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:48,660
You alcoholic.

385
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:50,780
Why can't you drink at home?

386
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,180
Why did you have to go out?

387
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:54,540
Your family has got too many rules, I dare not.

388
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:55,580
I gotta go.

389
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:57,240
You guys continue.

390
00:24:58,180 --> 00:24:59,380
Thank you, Uncle Lin.

391
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:02,820
Come over here, I will apply some medicine for you.

392
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,230
I have been applied.

393
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:10,600
What's the matter?

394
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:13,120
Lean against here.

395
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:24,020
Here, come on.

396
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:29,270
Did you feel better?

397
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:33,550
Afraid, are you?

398
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:36,980
This is the result of you hiding things from me.

399
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,020
The reason why I didn't tell you

400
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:42,120
is exactly because I was afraid that you would get too worried.

401
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,900
How many times have you taken this medicine these days?

402
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,020
There was much more

403
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,980
last time I checked it last week.

404
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:49,820
I dropped some yesterday

405
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:51,220
and I forgot to refill it.

406
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:55,400
You need to check it every day from now on.

407
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:59,380
Why did you drink?

408
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:02,350
Are you bored at staying at my home?

409
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:06,740
To release the pressure, obviously.

410
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:08,800
There is too much pressure from work.

411
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:12,080
You have a big household with a large fortune

412
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:13,620
and your family is investing on manufacturing

413
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:16,150
which has the most powerful growth momentum.

414
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:19,790
I can't sleep, not even a single night.

415
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:23,580
Bring me along when you go for a drink next time.

416
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:24,860
Bring you along?

417
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,260
Well, the next day,

418
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:28,140
I will get kicked out by your mother.

419
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:30,060
I will be just watching without drinking.

420
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:31,740
At best, it's like when I was a kid

421
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:33,540
and I wanted to have liquor filled chocolate,

422
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:36,000
you could let me have a lick of that on the sly.

423
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:37,940
I remember when we were kids

424
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:39,740
and you were having a chocolate,

425
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:41,000
you would lick it first

426
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:42,980
and then put it in my mouth.

427
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,340
And you would start to cry if I didn't take it.

428
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:46,940
As a result, when my father came in,

429
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:47,980
he thought I was the one who secretly

430
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:50,100
let you eat the liquor filled chocolate

431
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,360
and gave me a good kick.

432
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:53,140
He almost

433
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:54,200
wasted his own son.

434
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,660
If you want to drink next time,

435
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:02,380
drink at home.

436
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,180
Anyhow, you have Uncle Lin

437
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:06,040
and Uncle Chen to take care of you.

438
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:10,660
Okay.

439
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:26,260
[Family of Books and Ritual]

440
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:29,180
Uncle Lin.

441
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:31,340
Look at the water on the ground.

442
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:32,470
Stay away, far away.

443
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:33,340
What a pity

444
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:35,990
if such a pair of beautiful shoes got stained.

445
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:41,300
Uncle Lin, I was gonna ask...

446
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:44,420
You want to ask about what happened last night, right?

447
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:46,660
They bumped into some robbers for money.

448
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:48,140
He didn't hold his temper after overdrinking

449
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:49,200
and took a few hits.

450
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:52,100
Where did the robbers come from?

451
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,740
He's a man,

452
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:57,060
it doesn't matter for him to take a few hits.

453
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:57,820
Meanwhile,

454
00:27:58,020 --> 00:27:58,980
isn't it a good thing

455
00:27:58,980 --> 00:27:59,820
for him to remember

456
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,550
not to overdrink in the future?

457
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:42,980
Yesterday,

458
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:46,040
Mei Xing got beaten by others.

459
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:50,860
Oh, yeah?

460
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:52,660
How's he?

461
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,400
Do you really have no idea

462
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:02,070
or are you pretending that you don't know?

463
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:17,780
My account is now being checked by my own family

464
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:22,470
while I am being watched by Mr. Mei and his son.

465
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,920
I don't even dare to go to the company,

466
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:28,790
yet I have to be treated unfairly by my own sister.

467
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,940
Am I not the poorest man here?

468
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,910
My life is way harder than you thought.

469
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:49,260
The moment Chen was back,

470
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:50,820
all my plans I'd made these years

471
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:51,660
were ruined.

472
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,500
I am not only losing my own money.

473
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,340
The ones who co-invested with me

474
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:58,200
are now trying to get even with me.

475
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,700
We are twins from the same mother

476
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,230
and we share the same blood.

477
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,140
The one you should take most care of

478
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:05,940
is me.

479
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:13,660
I just hope you are all safe and sound.

480
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:16,020
Who doesn't?

481
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:36,140
Here.

482
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:45,820
It still feels a bit hot.

483
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:48,260
Not really.

484
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:53,560
Our body temperatures are pretty much the same.

485
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:54,860
I will buy you

486
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:55,800
a thermometer.

487
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:56,920
We have one at home.

488
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:59,980
It's in the right drawer of the desk.

489
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:19,380
Here.

490
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,940
You see, 36.9 degrees,

491
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:25,960
pretty normal.

492
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:40,840
This is tasteless.

493
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:43,400
You are still recovering.

494
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:45,260
You should eat something bland.

495
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:48,260
Add some sugar, can I?

496
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:51,820
How much?

497
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:53,110
Half a spoon.

498
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:55,150
A quarter of a spoon.

499
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:03,740
Who is it?

500
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:12,220
Zhousheng Chen's wife?

501
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:13,140
It's mine.

502
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:16,100
It's the vegetables I bought, take them in.

503
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:17,980
Give it to me, please.

504
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:18,900
Here.

505
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:21,820
Thank you, thank you.

506
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,030
You bought vegetables.

507
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,700
We agreed, a quarter of a spoon.

508
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:55,060
You're stingy.

509
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:08,220
So that marks us

510
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:10,540
officially living our lives together.

511
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:15,300
So what do you

512
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:16,860
want to talk about?

513
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:18,820
House chores.

514
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,060
Okay.

515
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:23,460
I have hired a

516
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,620
cleaning lady to do the cleaning job

517
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:26,100
and she has been working for almost four years.

518
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:28,180
She will come over to have three times of thorough cleaning every week.

519
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:29,540
So, we don't have to

520
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:30,920
worry about cleaning.

521
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:32,540
She is from a financially embarrassed family

522
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:33,860
and she works really hard.

523
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:34,860
If there's no problem,

524
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:36,190
I don't want to fire her.

525
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:38,740
No need to fire her.

526
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:41,380
You have the final say in this house.

527
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:43,820
I can cook.

528
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:44,820
So, no need to

529
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:46,020
hire another one to cook for us.

530
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:47,300
Bad news is we need to wash to dishes

531
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:49,300
and clean up the kitchen ourselves.

532
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:51,860
Along with doing the laundry, hang the clothes out,

533
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:54,190
bring the clothes in and fold the clothes.

534
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:57,780
The fact that you can split one thing

535
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:59,300
into four

536
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:00,620
tells me that

537
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:03,560
you are really not a big fan of doing the laundry.

538
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:06,140
Washing and hanging them out in particular.

539
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:08,469
Bringing in and folding clothes are fine.

540
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:09,580
I'll do it.

541
00:34:11,739 --> 00:34:13,100
I like cooking,

542
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,300
but dislike washing the dishes.

543
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:17,020
I'll do it.

544
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:20,060
What about cleaning up the kitchen?

545
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:24,300
I'll do it.

546
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,739
That's my boy.

547
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:28,949
Here's your reward.

548
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:37,420
Now, do you think

549
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:39,639
getting married is actually not bad?

550
00:34:41,739 --> 00:34:43,100
I used to think

551
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:44,340
that it would be worth getting married

552
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:45,699
if someone could share the duty of

553
00:34:45,699 --> 00:34:46,980
doing what I hate.

554
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,420
You don't ask for too much

555
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:51,880
and are easily satisfied.

556
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:53,060
If you can put up with

557
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:53,820
having noodles every single day

558
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:55,340
in the future,

559
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:57,180
I can also take the job

560
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:58,300
of cooking.

561
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:00,710
Cooking is where my happiness is from.

562
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:05,180
Well, now.

563
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:06,900
Do you think marrying me

564
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,380
is actually a good thing?

565
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:10,380
The dishes I make taste like home

566
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:12,510
and are better than what aunties make.

567
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:16,380
I'd say I was lucky.

568
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:21,670
And washing the fruits.

569
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:26,350
I'll take it.

570
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:30,260
I am pretty sure

571
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:31,520
you are born

572
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:32,900
to marry me.

573
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:34,550
Everything I hate to do,

574
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:35,920
you can do them all.

575
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:38,310
I have always

576
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:39,880
been into washing things.

577
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:41,870
Dealing with all kinds of dirty

578
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:43,780
utensils or cabinets.

579
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:47,500
What about things in the sink?

580
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:52,340
I'll do it.

581
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,460
It seems like

582
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:36,660
you have never gone into this place.

583
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:37,780
No, I haven't.

584
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:39,620
Aren't you interested in

585
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:40,620
my workplace?

586
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:42,740
Of course, I am.

587
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:44,460
When I first knew you,

588
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,940
I searched it on the internet

589
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:47,500
and found some pictures of its interior.

590
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,060
So I have, more or less,

591
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:50,620
some knowledge about it.

592
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:52,740
This is my recording studio.

593
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:53,540
If you want to go in,

594
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:54,660
just walk in there.

595
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:56,620
Yours?

596
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:58,580
Yeah, my workshop rented it.

597
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:00,110
Let's go.

598
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:01,790
I will show you my property.

599
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:18,100
Hey, it's you guys.

600
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:20,360
Your feet are okay?

601
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:21,540
Yeah, yeah.

602
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:22,700
When it comes to this,

603
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:23,460
I gotta thank you

604
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:24,590
and your boyfriend.

605
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:26,940
Sorry, I've got a phone call.

606
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:29,500
Hello?

607
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:31,380
Yeah, yeah, I am sorry.

608
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:32,740
I will be right there.

609
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:34,200
Okay, okay, okay, will do.

610
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:35,980
I am sorry.

611
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:37,660
I've got too many orders.

612
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:38,380
I gotta go.

613
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:39,300
Bye.

614
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:40,100
Bye.

615
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:43,900
How did you know him?

616
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,980
Well, by chance.

617
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:51,070
Let's go.

618
00:37:58,420 --> 00:37:59,100
Miss Shi.

619
00:37:59,220 --> 00:37:59,820
Miss Lin.

620
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:02,260
This is our sound engineer, Lin Yao.

621
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:03,300
This is my husband.

622
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:03,780
Nice to meet you.

623
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:04,420
Nice to meet you.

624
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:06,060
It's the first time our beauty

625
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:08,060
brings her family member here, huh.

626
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:10,660
You just go on with what you're doing and I'll show him around.

627
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:12,180
This is the control room.

628
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:13,620
In there you have the recording studio.

629
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:14,680
That's the monitor

630
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:15,840
and the TV in there.

631
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:17,220
They have the same display signal.

632
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:18,100
That way, people on both sides

633
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:19,500
can see the same picture.

634
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:22,820
Let's get in there and have a look.

635
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:23,350
Let's go.

636
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:33,980
When doing the recording, there will be two mics positioned,

637
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:35,740
one close to you, one far away.

638
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:37,860
Can you guess why?

639
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:43,620
To record two sounds.

640
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:45,580
If you want to use the sound recorded near you,

641
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:46,820
use the one recorded by the mic that's closer to you.

642
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:48,340
Otherwise,

643
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:49,900
use the one recorded by the farther mic.

644
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:50,700
Almost there.

645
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:51,550
We read once,

646
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,020
and he will have two soundtracks.

647
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:53,940
When doing the sound mixing,

648
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:55,180
depending on the scenario,

649
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:58,180
he can choose either the closer one or the farther one.

650
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:02,280
So when you were playing the heroine,

651
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,740
you would sit here and dub

652
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,300
with a male voice actor?

653
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:07,740
Sometimes I would do dubbing together with another actor.

654
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:09,140
But it's quite rare

655
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:10,660
as two people dubbing together

656
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:11,780
is highly demanding

657
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:12,460
for their skills.

658
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:14,060
That's why we would usually do solo recording.

659
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:14,860
For example, I could,

660
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:16,820
from this afternoon all the way till tonight,

661
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:17,540
finish dubbing

662
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:19,940
about two to three episodes for my own part.

663
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:22,950
I would usually be the first one to dub.

664
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:24,920
Because it's always the hardest.

665
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:28,470
Let's go out and have a look.

666
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:45,580
With the size of such a recording studio,

667
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:46,900
how many voice actors

668
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:47,960
would you recruit?

669
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:49,540
That depends.

670
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:51,020
As long as we have voices

671
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:51,940
of all different ages,

672
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:53,420
from junior to senior.

673
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:54,980
We could have a whole package project working.

674
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:55,700
My workshop

675
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:58,190
has signed up with dozens of voice actors.

676
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,820
Miss Shi can stand on top of the pyramid

677
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:03,020
of her industry

678
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:04,580
at her twenties.

679
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:06,710
That's pretty impressive.

680
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:07,940
More impressive than I am.

681
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:08,900
No, not really.

682
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:10,460
You are flattering me.

683
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:17,340
Every time you stood down there waiting for me,

684
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:19,470
I would be standing here watching you.

685
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:32,460
Here you are.

686
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:34,900
[Debit card]

687
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:34,780
What is it?

688
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,020
My salary card which I just got.

689
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:44,140
It feels fantastic

690
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:47,300
to have someone hand to me his salary.

691
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:49,500
It's like I have the power in my grip

692
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:51,260
and I have you in my hand.

693
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:52,660
Miss Shi.

694
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:56,120
You have a very strong desire for control, do you know that?

695
00:40:58,420 --> 00:40:59,100
Shi Yi,

696
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:00,910
you are here.

697
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:18,860
Me and Wang Yingdong

698
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:20,380
are simply workmates.

699
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:24,540
He often comes here.

700
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:26,260
I know.

701
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:28,860
I have no feelings about him.

702
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:30,460
Not even a single bit.

703
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:32,260
I can see that.

704
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:37,500
Do you really not mind?

705
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:40,220
Yes, I do.

706
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:42,460
But I can manage to digest it myself.

707
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:47,740
Nevertheless, hearing that you said you do

708
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:49,700
makes me feel a bit proud.

709
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:52,260
Proud?

710
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:55,240
I love to see you getting jealous.

711
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:18,180
Mother,

712
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:20,190
if you are tired,

713
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:22,260
I can help you get upstairs to take a rest.

714
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:23,660
No, I am good.

715
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:30,380
You don't have to go.

716
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:33,140
Here, we've got more people to look after each other.

717
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:35,220
And the grandsons and granddaughters can make you happy.

718
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:36,480
How wonderful is that?

719
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:41,500
East or West,

720
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:44,780
home is the best.

721
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:47,740
I have been used to living at my own home

722
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:50,700
and I feel like a guest wherever I go.

723
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:52,030
I am not going there.

724
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:55,580
How about we wait till they come back?

725
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:56,530
Meet each other

726
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,660
and then leave after having a reunion dinner?

727
00:42:58,660 --> 00:42:59,780
Sounds good, good.

728
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:04,740
So, Chen and his newly married wife.

729
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:06,580
When are they coming back?

730
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:08,710
This weekend.

731
00:43:12,370 --> 00:43:14,050
This time after they return.

732
00:43:14,470 --> 00:43:16,660
You gotta treat them better.

733
00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:28,980
It reminds me of

734
00:43:31,530 --> 00:43:33,840
how I treated you

735
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,600
when I saw how you treat them.

736
00:43:42,510 --> 00:43:46,810
I was so stubborn and so subjective,

737
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:51,330
trying so hard to separate you and the second eldest son of the Zhou family.

738
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:57,440
It's already too late for me to regret now.

739
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:00,160
Too late.

740
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:03,360
Wan.

741
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:06,560
I hope you won't make the same mistake as I did,

742
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:10,040
okay?

743
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:12,840
Mother.

744
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:17,840
It's been 20 years.

745
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,460
Stop thinking about that.

746
00:44:49,910 --> 00:44:52,270
How regretful I am.
