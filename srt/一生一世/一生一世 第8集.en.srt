00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:56,940
Let's go.

173
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,540
Chen.

174
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:22,860
Slow down.

175
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:35,860
Chen.

176
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,820
Miss Shi Yi.

177
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,080
Chen.

178
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,660
I knew I could meet you here.

179
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,490
Did you walk down from up there?

180
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:49,030
It's okay.

181
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:51,340
Miss Shi Yi, how nice to meet you.

182
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,490
My name is Zhou Wenxing.

183
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:54,130
I am your future sister-in-law.

184
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:55,060
Nice to meet you.

185
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,620
My mom was there the other day,

186
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:59,180
sorry I didn't get a chance to talk with you.

187
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:01,310
But we can finally meet and talk today.

188
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,500
You are about to see my mom.

189
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:04,540
Are you nervous?

190
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:06,700
I'm fine.

191
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,140
Being nervous is totally normal.

192
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,950
Everyone at home is afraid of her.

193
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:11,560
Relax,

194
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:12,770
I've got your back.

195
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,380
You're really not built for mountain climbing,

196
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:16,710
so what are you here for?

197
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:20,100
It's...It's Xiaofu.

198
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,780
She says a pregnant woman needs a lot of walking.

199
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,110
I was worried about her,

200
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:26,110
that's why I joined her on her walk.

201
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,580
It's me.

202
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:31,860
The doctor says I need to walk every day for exercise.

203
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,180
Wenfang went out with me

204
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,220
and we happened to see Wenxing.

205
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,540
So, we went out together.

206
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:37,340
I can't pick up my pace as a pregnant woman.

207
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:38,780
She didn't make any great effort coming down here.

208
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,110
You don't have to worry.

209
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,630
Get in my car, let's go back.

210
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,140
I want to spend some time

211
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:46,220
talking with Shi Yi.

212
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:46,780
Hurry up.

213
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:47,820
It's okay.

214
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,280
We have plenty of time.

215
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:50,380
Yeah.

216
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,740
You don't have to do it now.

217
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:52,900
Let's get in the car for now.

218
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,900
I'm too tired from all this walking.

219
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,060
By the way, Chen,

220
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,060
we will try the dishes at noon.

221
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,260
Get home earlier,

222
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,220
or mom's gonna be unhappy again.

223
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:03,940
Bye.

224
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,340
We might need to

225
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,000
walk quite a way still.

226
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:19,980
It's okay, we have beautiful scenery to keep us happy.

227
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,110
We won't feel tired.

228
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:23,260
Let's go.

229
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:34,860
At your pace,

230
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:35,900
we might have to walk

231
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,030
for 50 or 60 minutes.

232
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:38,420
That far?

233
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,010
Can we make it in time to try the dishes?

234
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:41,820
Yes.

235
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:43,020
If not,

236
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:44,820
they are gonna have to wait for us.

237
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:47,080
After all, it's our engagement banquet.

238
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,920
This road is difficult to walk on.

239
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,540
I do morning exercise regularly.

240
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,820
I am in perfect health.

241
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:13,620
While you

242
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:14,900
stay in a lab every day.

243
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:15,760
Can you make it?

244
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,340
When I was in college,

245
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,420
I had a hobby.

246
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,620
That was mountain climbing.

247
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,820
Why is your brother and sister's last name Zhou?

248
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:33,280
While your cousin's last name is Zhousheng?

249
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,260
After my father passed away,

250
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,140
in order to make the family business

251
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:38,300
run properly.

252
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,060
My uncle temporarily

253
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,150
took over as the owner of the house,

254
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:44,220
and changed his last name to Zhousheng.

255
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,660
His only son Ren

256
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:48,080
also changed his last name accordingly.

257
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,860
Wenchuan and Wenxing are twins,

258
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,260
can you see that?

259
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:55,660
Kind of.

260
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,180
But Wenchuan is

261
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,760
more mature than Wenxing.

262
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:00,740
In fact, Wenxing didn't stay in college

263
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:01,820
for long enough

264
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,700
before she came back home to recuperate.

265
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:04,820
So her chance to experiencing the world

266
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:05,620
was cut short,

267
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:07,880
which explains why she can be a bit naive.

268
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:19,820
I mean,

269
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,420
the old traditions are good.

270
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:23,240
You can have a meal at the engagement banquet,

271
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,770
and another at the wedding.

272
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:26,960
Yeah.

273
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:28,540
I mean, their second eldest son is married.

274
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:29,950
Now the eldest one is getting married.

275
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:32,880
We won't get to eat these dishes in the future, right?

276
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:34,670
Of course, we will.

277
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:36,500
At the red egg party.

278
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:39,130
You are seriously thinking way ahead.

279
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:40,990
And the third daughter, Wenxing.

280
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:41,950
The fourth, Ren.

281
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:44,420
Plus the engagement, the wedding.

282
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,430
And the red egg party again.

283
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,260
The wedding, that's right.

284
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,990
That's what I'm talking about.

285
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:50,680
Chen is back.

286
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:53,850
Why did you walk up here?

287
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:55,780
Just let us know, we can pick you up.

288
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,500
I saw it was a good day today.

289
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,020
So, I wanted to take a walk through the mountains.

290
00:14:59,020 --> 00:14:59,820
That's right.

291
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:00,860
Young people who don't walk a lot,

292
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:02,320
might end up growing lazy.

293
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,470
Uncle Lin, we are going inside.

294
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:06,590
Go ahead.

295
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,550
Uncle Lin enjoys making fun of you.

296
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,420
That's who he is.

297
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,580
Why is Mei Xing not here?

298
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,820
He is much older than you.

299
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:23,540
It is very rude of you

300
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,200
to call out his name like that.

301
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:26,540
Then how should I call him?

302
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:27,540
Brother-in-law?

303
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:30,100
If you keep talking like this,

304
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,180
I'll get mad at you.

305
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:36,660
What's this dish?

306
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,630
Lotus seedpod fish maw.

307
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:40,940
Fish maw?

308
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,780
Fish maw needs to first

309
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,740
be soaked in oil for twelve hours.

310
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:47,460
After it gets soft,

311
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:49,790
Keep it at a heat of 180 degrees to bloat it.

312
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,740
Then soak it at a low temperature.

313
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:53,970
Put in some stock in to season it,

314
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:56,790
and simmer it for about a minute on a low heat.

315
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:58,640
Can you make it?

316
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:00,540
I can't.

317
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:02,870
Then why would you know it inside out?

318
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:05,720
I heard our chef mention it once,

319
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:07,060
and so I remembered it.

320
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:12,260
If it's someone who doesn't know you well,

321
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,140
they must be thinking

322
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:16,200
you're showing off having such a photographic memory.

323
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,020
Chen.

324
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:20,020
My sister-in-law is so beautiful

325
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:20,620
that you're reluctant to

326
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,820
talk with us.

327
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:24,780
Instead, we always see you whispering there.

328
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,460
The whole lot of us are

329
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:27,620
feeling left out.

330
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,820
So, our bridegroom-to-be,

331
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,180
shall we start?

332
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,220
Dig in.

333
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:45,900
Are the dishes to your liking?

334
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:53,820
Chen.

335
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:55,380
You lured her deep

336
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,500
into the mountains

337
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:58,660
without arranging any activities?

338
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,540
Nothing really.

339
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:06,500
My future cousin-to-be.

340
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:07,740
Think about it.

341
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:08,960
Marrying him means

342
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,300
you're gonna stay deep in the mountains every year,

343
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,500
which is very boring.

344
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,700
Only you think it's boring, I guess.

345
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:19,460
I think it's great.

346
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:20,460
There's fresh air in the mountains.

347
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:21,520
I really like that.

348
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,579
Unlike you,

349
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,300
I hate this place.

350
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,580
Please hurry up and be born soon.

351
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,800
I am about to become a primitive soul.

352
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,140
Well.

353
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,810
Mom wants to see my sister-in-law?

354
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:42,660
No.

355
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:44,080
Your mother says...

356
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:45,150
It's okay, say it.

357
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:48,580
It is the play's last performance tonight.

358
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:50,100
She wants everyone to be present.

359
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,420
But she says

360
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,740
that Miss Shi Yi came from afar

361
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,140
and she needs rest, so...

362
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,500
no need for her to be there.

363
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,220
That's it.

364
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,900
She's not seeing her daughter-in-law?

365
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,140
Jiaren, this is your favorite.

366
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:26,100
Thanks, mom.

367
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:39,600
My dear brother and future sister-in-law are trying the dishes.

368
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,100
For the sake of looking lively,

369
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,820
they especially asked the juniors to be with them.

370
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,420
That's so thoughtful of him.

371
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:15,620
Are the dishes to your liking?

372
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:28,220
Was it so dramatic?

373
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,260
Yeah.

374
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:30,620
I was looking from outside

375
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:31,620
and I held my breath.

376
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:32,700
Seriously.

377
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:22,620
It's you who fear the cold,

378
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:23,900
not your mom.

379
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:27,320
You didn't see my sister-in-law.

380
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:29,950
What an awkward situation you just put her in.

381
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:34,780
You have never been

382
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:36,040
a mean mother-in-law.

383
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:38,280
You treated Jiaren so nicely.

384
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,980
Be nicer to my sister-in-law, will you?

385
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:43,260
Everyone's got his or her own temper.

386
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:45,460
Your brother decided out of his own will

387
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:46,300
to marry a girl

388
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:48,500
I have never met before.

389
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:50,120
For that I respect him.

390
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:53,200
So if I don't favor this daughter-in-law

391
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,140
and do not want to see her,

392
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:56,340
you can't say a thing about that either.

393
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:00,860
Always some excuse.

394
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,220
What did you say?

395
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,500
I said you always have some point.

396
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:10,700
You can come up with a reason for anything on Earth.

397
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:18,460
Mr. Chen.

398
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,340
Every time you come here

399
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:22,740
with this army of people.

400
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:24,300
Those who have no idea what's happening

401
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,180
would assume the Zhou family

402
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:27,300
owes you money and is paying you back in clothes.

403
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,500
I'm a new tailor.

404
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:31,230
It's all bluffing with this number of people.

405
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,620
Is this about the future mother-in-law

406
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:38,750
inviting artists to

407
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:41,420
perform for the future daughter-in-law?

408
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,980
Miss Shi Yi is not there.

409
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:48,110
Does Mrs. Zhou not like her?

410
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:50,630
Sooner or later.

411
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,450
No hurry.

412
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:53,910
Come on, please.

413
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:00,900
My aunt used to

414
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,300
keep Jiaren around her

415
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,110
and treated her like her own daughter.

416
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:06,030
I was with Jiaren in the same elementary school.

417
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:07,160
She has been popular

418
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,550
since we were in school.

419
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,250
She had good grades,

420
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:12,650
and was the student representative chosen to give a speech every semester.

421
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:14,710
I mean, who wouldn't like her as a kid?

422
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:17,670
Zhousheng Chen didn't get better grades?

423
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:19,540
My cousin doesn't like to be in the limelight,

424
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:21,540
so no one would compete against her.

425
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:23,260
At that time,

426
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:26,260
all of the family thought they were going to get married.

427
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:28,820
No one expected things would turn out this way.

428
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:30,950
With someone so totally unconnected.

429
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:32,020
If it were me,

430
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,230
I would keep some distance.

431
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:39,860
Maybe it's not that surprising.

432
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,180
Maybe

433
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:44,100
Zhousheng Chen never really had any feelings for her.

434
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,340
It was all her crush.

435
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:53,340
Jiaren.

436
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:55,540
Next time you talk behind someone's back,

437
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,740
make sure you look over both shoulders.

438
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,860
If it bothered you,

439
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,000
just interrupt us from the beginning.

440
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,530
You'd eavesdrop for so long

441
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:05,360
and then blame us for not knowing you were there?

442
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,600
You took them as your pet?

443
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:20,940
I'd say it's a coincidence.

444
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:22,260
I bought these

445
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:24,740
outside of the hotel you stayed at in Xi'an.

446
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,740
Is there any difference

447
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:33,070
between raising crabs and other animals?

448
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:35,740
Compared with other pets,

449
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:37,600
crabs are better at escaping.

450
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,820
The first time I got them to the dormitory,

451
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:41,060
due to my lack of experience,

452
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:42,180
they caught me unawares

453
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,910
and almost all of them got away.

454
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,610
So, what do they like to eat?

455
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:49,550
Small fish and shrimps, things like that.

456
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,730
Just because Chen raises crabs,

457
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:54,200
all the crab dishes at the engagement banquet

458
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,130
were taken away.

459
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:57,020
No one's gonna believe

460
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,220
that there's no crab dishes

461
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,420
being served at an engagement banquet

462
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:00,950
on the Yangtze River delta.

463
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:05,400
There's an emotional attachment after you raise them.

464
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,490
Then from now on, I won't eat crabs anymore.

465
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:09,060
Then from now on, I...

466
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:10,900
won't tell you when I do!

467
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,380
New bedsheet, new duvet cover.

468
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:15,640
They are all brand new.

469
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:16,580
Just leave them there.

470
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,580
I can do it myself.

471
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:18,460
Okay.

472
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:19,660
If there's anything else,

473
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:20,990
feel free to let me know.

474
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,560
So, you can take a rest now.

475
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,360
I'll go to the next room

476
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:33,680
and get some sleep.

477
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:54,740
By the way,

478
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:56,100
if you need anything.

479
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:57,420
Just call me.

480
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:11,680
Come in.

481
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:14,820
I'd rather take my

482
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:15,700
pets back.

483
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:18,310
I am afraid they might wake you up at night.

484
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:19,190
Okay.

485
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,160
Good night.

486
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:32,200
Good night.

487
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:17,000
They are laid out the same way as in my family.

488
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:53,300
Hello?

489
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:56,440
I just wanted to say good night to you.

490
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:00,500
Did you buy all the stuff

491
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:01,660
in the sink?

492
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:04,820
I saw it once

493
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:05,860
when I went to your place,

494
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:07,120
and so I remembered it.

495
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:10,100
Again, showing off your memory.

496
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:12,140
No, that's not it.

497
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:16,300
Why do we have to use a phone

498
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:17,780
when we are one wall away from each other?

499
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:20,510
Isn't nighttime perfect for seeing one another?

500
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:22,550
I was afraid to disturb you.

501
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:25,060
Open the door.

502
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:44,060
I often work till 11 or 12 pm.

503
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:45,460
I can't go to sleep early either.

504
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:46,320
Mr. Zhousheng.

505
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:49,620
Something just happened over there,

506
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:51,150
they want you to come quick.

507
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:57,580
You take a rest,

508
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:58,740
I'll check it out.

509
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:09,740
Well now, do you want to have some tea?

510
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:11,590
Flower tea, good for sleeping.

511
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:12,910
No, I am not thirsty.

512
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:13,780
Okay.

513
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,180
Rest early.

514
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:17,160
Call me if there's anything else.

515
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:49,860
I simply pushed her on impulse,

516
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:51,940
I didn't expect anything like this to happen.

517
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:53,270
Where is everyone else?

518
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,020
They went to the hospital.

519
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:58,520
What about Zhou Wenchuan?

520
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:00,780
I don't know.

521
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:09,420
Why don't you ask me about it?

522
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:13,700
About what?

523
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:15,940
Ask me why

524
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:17,580
I argued with Tang Xiaofu?

525
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:19,420
I am not good at

526
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:21,620
dealing with these kinds of conflicts.

527
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:23,430
There's no point me asking why.

528
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:31,180
Because throughout the night,

529
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,350
they have been making comparisons

530
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:35,220
between me and your fiancée.

531
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:39,660
In their eyes,

532
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,740
I am a total loser.

533
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:47,300
Chen.

534
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:55,420
Jiaren.

535
00:29:58,620 --> 00:29:59,480
Where is Shi Yi?

536
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,060
In her room.

537
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:03,060
That's good.

538
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:06,310
We are a big family with a lot of big mouths,

539
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:07,620
so that means a lot of troubles too.

540
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:09,780
We need to make sure Shi Yi is protected from these.

541
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:11,510
If she hears this crap too much,

542
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:14,180
she wouldn't be confident enough to marry you.

543
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:16,140
That's why

544
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:17,720
you need to spend more time

545
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:18,540
with her.

546
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,500
And talk more with her, you know?

547
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:21,860
Yeah, I got it.

548
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:35,470
Where are you going?

549
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:37,860
I want to take a walk.

550
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:39,340
Don't go outside.

551
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,100
His mom takes saving face very seriously.

552
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:44,900
What happened tonight is a stain on their family reputation.

553
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,260
If you happened to see this,

554
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:48,120
she would definitely be unhappy.

555
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:50,180
We should just stay in here and not look,

556
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:51,910
pretend we don't know about it.

557
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:55,380
Okay.

558
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,500
I'll go back to my room, then.

559
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:58,540
Rest early.

560
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:58,260
You poor thing.

561
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:02,060
There's no one to keep you company tonight.

562
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:06,120
Come sleep with me.

563
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:07,230
Let's go.

564
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:14,840
You head to bed for now.

565
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:34,100
Chen, you are not sleepy?

566
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,620
She just went to bed,

567
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:39,340
so probably hasn't fallen asleep yet.

568
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:41,540
I don't want to risk waking her up again.

569
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:42,980
After half an hour or so,

570
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:43,940
I'll head back.

571
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:51,920
You are not going to sleep?

572
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:53,510
I am not sleepy, either.

573
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:55,380
The thing is, ever since you came back,

574
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:56,420
you've been followed by either the lawyer, Mr. Mei,

575
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:57,620
or my sister-in-law.

576
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:59,220
It's been impossible to get any alone time with you.

577
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:01,280
So I want to stay with you for a moment.

578
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:07,100
Chen.

579
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:09,340
I mean, you are doing a good job

580
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:10,460
in your scientific research,

581
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:12,180
and you are also very into this,

582
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,510
why would you come back?

583
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:18,220
You wouldn't understand

584
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:19,580
even if I told you why.

585
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,100
You couldn't figure it out.

586
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,430
But I could remember it.

587
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:23,820
I can't figure it out now.

588
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:26,620
But I could hold onto it and try to understand in the future.

589
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:27,460
I remember

590
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:28,780
when I was 3,

591
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:29,900
you told me that

592
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,940
because light travels faster than sound,

593
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:33,340
we always see the lightning first,

594
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:34,580
and then hear the thunder.

595
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:35,980
I can still recall it now.

596
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,540
Not bad memory.

597
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:48,260
In the past.

598
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:50,420
Domestic worker's wages used to be low

599
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:52,350
and that's why there are many OEMs.

600
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:53,780
Made in China...

601
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:56,700
This became the trend of manufacturing industry.

602
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:58,700
But now,

603
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:01,140
as the cost of Chinese labor increases,

604
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,070
Made in China

605
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,560
has gradually turned into

606
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:06,190
made in other countries.

607
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:08,219
So, a lot of OEMs face

608
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,980
either closure,

609
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,230
or transformation.

610
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:12,940
Capital always makes sure it's profitable

611
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:14,620
and take the world as its OEM,

612
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:17,070
so it only ever goes to low-cost areas.

613
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:19,300
But we can't do this.

614
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:21,590
A nation needs manufacturing.

615
00:34:22,179 --> 00:34:23,139
Be it high-tech,

616
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:25,219
infrastructural, technical ones,

617
00:34:25,219 --> 00:34:26,420
we can't give them up.

618
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:29,620
I don't want to see our family

619
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:31,420
abandon the domestic foundation

620
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:33,900
and only seek to make money out of money.

621
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:37,060
That's why I am back.

622
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:44,540
Do you remember that?

623
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:46,260
Yes, I do.

624
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:54,060
[Lotus Fragrance Pavilion]

625
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,520
Do you understand?

626
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:51,300
Yes.

627
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:50,860
It's pretty humid near the lake.

628
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:52,520
Be careful not to catch a cold.

629
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:00,540
Sit on my coat.

630
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:23,340
Seeing all those crappy things

631
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:24,740
happening tonight.

632
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,120
I suddenly pitied you.

633
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:29,940
A wife you just married

634
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:32,340
only cares about your brother.

635
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:36,820
What do you think?

636
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:41,700
She can do what she likes.

637
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:42,910
Did you have dinner?

638
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:44,180
I heard that

639
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:45,790
you returned all your food.

640
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:49,260
The stuff in your family is too delicate,

641
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:50,500
it's not made to be edible,

642
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,900
more like an exhibition.

643
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:55,940
Now you're starting to be sarcastic again,

644
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:58,150
looks like you are going to forgive me.

645
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:02,960
I just don't want to make it too nasty.

646
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:06,630
After all, we knew each other since we were small.

647
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,830
You said the same thing

648
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,160
when we had a quarrel back in high school.

649
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,500
In our second year in university, we fought and then went back to being friends,

650
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,740
back then you were saying pretty much the same thing.

651
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:15,670
You were saying,

652
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:17,740
due to the family relation,

653
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:19,400
you don't want it to turn ugly.

654
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:25,860
I will buy you some pot noodles tomorrow.

655
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:26,620
Next to the Jinshan Temple.

656
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:27,750
Your favorite kind.

657
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:33,020
I will go down the hill at 3:30 am

658
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:33,500
and come back at 5 am.

659
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,700
That way, I should make it to breakfast.

660
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:37,540
I don't buy it.

661
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,560
No one else needs to buy it,

662
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,230
as long as you do.

663
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:09,750
Mr. Zhousheng.

664
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:11,320
Do I need to wake her up?

665
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:14,100
No, it's okay.

666
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:15,680
Let her sleep a bit longer.

667
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:16,580
Okay.

668
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:26,500
Where is Xiaofu?

669
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:28,550
I didn't see her in the morning.

670
00:38:30,730 --> 00:38:31,790
She went back home.

671
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:35,360
She's not attending the engagement banquet?

672
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:36,700
It is said she'll be going into labor soon

673
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:38,140
and left last night.

674
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:02,980
Where is Shi Yi?

675
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:06,120
She's still sleeping.

676
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:12,190
Even though she's not married yet,

677
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:14,300
she should act like a local here.

678
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:16,580
I didn't tell her

679
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:18,110
what time we eat breakfast.

680
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:21,260
Chen.

681
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,630
I think your fiancee

682
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:25,220
is going to be a blessing for our Zhou family.

683
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:26,820
If she ever took over the household,

684
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:27,420
none of us would have to

685
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:29,280
get up so early to have breakfast.

686
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:42,760
Where is Wenchuan?

687
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:46,190
He didn't come back last night.

688
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:50,480
Let's eat, no need to wait.

689
00:39:57,620 --> 00:39:58,750
Have some porridge.

690
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:08,570
Uncle Chen.

691
00:40:08,570 --> 00:40:10,370
Change it to another bowl and take it to Man.

692
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:10,820
Okay.

693
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:12,420
While it's still hot.

694
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:12,940
Will do.

695
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:31,740
Why are you so late?

696
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:36,220
I overslept.

697
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:54,380
This morning,

698
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:56,180
the two of you,

699
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:58,180
come to the hospital with me.

700
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,100
You don't have to go, Jiaren.

701
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:36,700
Good morning, Shi Yi.

702
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:37,940
Good morning.

703
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:39,100
Did you have your breakfast?

704
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:39,780
I did.

705
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:44,700
It's so thoughtful of Chen.

706
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:46,820
In order to increase your appetite,

707
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:48,750
he even carved the lotus shape out.

708
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:50,540
He carved this himself?

709
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:51,620
Yeah.

710
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:54,220
Ren says he did it while he was taking a break

711
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:55,780
from doing experiments.

712
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:00,400
Did you sleep well last night?

713
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:02,340
Yeah, quite well.

714
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:04,380
He had to go out for something urgent.

715
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:06,260
So, he asked me to spend some time with you.

716
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:07,060
I am not a child

717
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:09,500
who always needs someone accompanying me.

718
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:10,340
But he hopes

719
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:12,300
you have someone with you

720
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:14,500
every single minute you are in this family.

721
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:16,430
Meanwhile, you look so beautiful,

722
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:17,180
many people are eager

723
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:18,340
to do that favor.

724
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:21,130
Just now, Ren was trying to take over from me.

725
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:27,180
When you're finished,

726
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:28,910
I will take you somewhere nice.

727
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:37,510
Chen says

728
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:39,620
you have always wanted to come here.

729
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:40,990
Where is this place?

730
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:42,180
The library.

731
00:42:42,730 --> 00:42:44,060
He says you asked him before

732
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:45,540
about the library.

733
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:48,390
That's why he guessed you would like this place.

734
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:50,080
There really is a library?

735
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:51,180
Yeah.

736
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:52,920
Let me show you around.

737
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:58,940
Here are some collections.

738
00:42:59,190 --> 00:43:00,580
The first time Chen went to your parents' place

739
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:01,780
to visit them.

740
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:03,620
He handpicked the gift.

741
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:05,900
He spent the whole night picking it.

742
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:10,220
There are people whose job it is

743
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:11,540
to clean this place every day.

744
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:13,340
So it should be dust-free.

745
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:15,340
By the way,

746
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:18,670
are you allergic to dust or any kinds of flowers or grass?

747
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:20,560
Chen, however,

748
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:22,340
is allergic to all of these.

749
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:24,710
One day if you quarrel with him,

750
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:26,380
you can make him smell a flower,

751
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:27,500
and he'll get rashes

752
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:28,740
all over his skin.

753
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:30,900
It's not very serious,

754
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:32,220
but it's a lot of fun.

755
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:35,220
I'm starting to seriously doubt

756
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:36,900
if you are a medical student.

757
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:38,580
Everyone tells me

758
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:39,940
allergies are no joke.

759
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:42,340
It can get pretty nasty if it turns serious.

760
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:43,860
I'm kidding.

761
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:46,580
In fact, his allergic reactions

762
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:47,940
are more like having a cold.

763
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:49,940
Like sneezing and a runny nose,

764
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:51,740
and a high body temperature.

765
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:53,700
As long as he stays away from the allergen,

766
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:55,300
He'll be fine by the next day.

767
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:10,300
Here I am in the region south of the Yangtze River,

768
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:13,100
while the tower in my dream is in the far northwest,

769
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:15,070
thousands of kilometers away.

770
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:19,390
How can there be poetry from Shanglin county?

771
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:22,960
How tall is this building?

772
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:24,820
Dozens of meters.

773
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:27,420
You can read any book you like here.

774
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:28,620
They are all copies written by others.

775
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:31,350
The original ones are well preserved elsewhere.

776
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:31,820
Let's go.
