Late 20s?

177
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,680
That's a dangerous age.

178
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,000
It's hard to say whether he's married or not.

179
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,880
In that case,

180
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,170
everybody who's over 18 is dangerous.

181

How are you supposed to develop your relationship?

Am I wrong?

Don't tell me you'll want to be in a platonic love for the rest of your life!

Of course it does!

198
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,440
Don't you think it's too coincidental?

199
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,840
Isn't it destiny?

Let me break it down for you.

202
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,360
You only need to buy a flight ticket.

203
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,480
You don't need to pay for the hotel,

Why would I be surprised?

224

They invited you to a seminar

225

226

to the lab.

230

It's a big timesaver.

346
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,120
Yes.

347
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,440
Xiaoyu came here for an interview

348
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,640
and we wanted to take this opportunity

349
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,800
to take a tour.

350
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,000
In one of the emails I sent you

351
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,290
I've mentioned her.

352
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,000
I'm sorry!

353
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,600
I haven't checked my mailbox for a while,

354
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,060
so I didn't see your email.

355
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:08,720
It's okay.

356
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,680
This is my business card.

357
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,480
Liu Shuai.

358
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,080
Yes. My name is Liu Shuai.

359
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,040
Pardon me,

360
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:17,800
I don't usually

361
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,530
carry my business card with me.

362
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,200
My name is Zhousheng Chen.

363
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,120
I'm an associate professor at Berkeley College of Chemistry.

364
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:23,960
I've been staying

365
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,440
at the Research Institute of Xi'an

366
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,840
for an exchange program.

367
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:27,700
Good! Good!

368
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:28,960
Shengchen!

369
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,090
It's a nice name.

370
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,740
You can just call me Shuai.

371
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,170
I'm Xiaoyu's coworker.

372
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,530
My family name is Zhousheng and my given name is Chen.

373
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,090
Mr. Zhou...Zhousheng!

374
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,040
It's a family name, huh?

375
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,360
Shi Yi,

376
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,520
what was it you said

377
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,680
just now?

378
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,100
It sounded quite nice.

379
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,000
Do you understand it?

380
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,360
Of course I do!

381
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,400
Why can't I?

382
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,240
But I'm telling you,

383
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,440
a sentence like that,

384
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:58,880
you have to

385
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,040
use your heart to understand it, you know?

386
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:01,880
Cut it out!

387
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,480
Go read the book "Stories to Awaken the World",

388
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,280
where there's a similar saying.

389
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,880
Listen,

390
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,680
the sentence means

391
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,320
people nowadays

392
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,120
only pay attention

393
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,580
to materialistic things.

394
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,560
Such as money,

395
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,440
car, house,

396
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,570
and appearance.

397
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,600
Seldom do they care about a person's inner beauty.

398
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,800
I got it! Got it!

399
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,320
Shi Yi forced me to read when we were little.

400
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,520
She's always been a bookworm.

401
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,120
She reads all kinds of books.

402
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,080
Mr. Zhousheng!

403
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,840
I must buy you a cell phone

404
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,120
when I get my salary next month.

405
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,160
I'll even pay the phone bills for you.

406
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,480
I went everywhere looking for you!

407
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,880
If it wasn't for the car of our institute parking outside,

408
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,340
I wouldn't have found you!

409
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,560
Shi Yi!

410
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:07,720
Hi!

411
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,960
Were you two going to meet with each other here?

412
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,620
No. We bumped into each other!

413
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,800
What's up?

414
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,480
We have a seminar later.

415
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,440
Did you forget?

416
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,160
Of course not.

417
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,560
I just came out for lunch.

418
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,020
I'll be going then.

419
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,560
I'll contact you later.

420
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,440
Bye.

421
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,200
Mr. Zhousheng.

422
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,480
I heard that the cherry blossoms

423
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,080
are blooming in the Azure Dragon Temple.

424
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,120
We are all not local people

425
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,160
and may not get the chance again.

426
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,020
Would you like to go there with us?

427
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,080
It's been raining these past two days.

428
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,280
If the rain stops

429
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,560
and you guys are still here,

430
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,840
then maybe we could set a date to go. Is that okay?

431
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:47,570
Sounds good!

432
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,520
It's a deal then.

433
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,880
Shi Yi will contact you by email.

434
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:52,640
See you!

435
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,260
See you!

436
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,560
Yes!

437
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,720
Look at you!

438
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,760
You make a living with your voice,

439
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,400
but you act like a mute

440
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,000
at the most critical moment!

441
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,130
Through today's

442
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,320
simple meal,

443
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,760
I found two good qualities

444
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,600
about him.

445
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,200
He's manly

446
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,180
and straightforward.

447
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,560
Actually that doesn't sound right either.

448
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,420
Ever since we were little,

449
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,280
I could always use you as an excuse

450
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,140
to ask someone out successfully.

451
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,480
In this way,

452
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,520
he isn't that special after all.

453
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,600
A pretty face

454
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,840
can only be maintained

455
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,120
from 16 to 36.

456
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,080
I like looking at pretty things.

457
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,280
It's even better when it comes in a pair.

458
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,200
Plus the good genes would be

459
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,200
passed down to the next generation.

460
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,080
You are way

461
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,600
above his league.

462
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,600
I think he's not bad.

463
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,600
He's

464
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,640
only got a special name.

465
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,320
Your name is good, too.

466
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,000
"A reputation that's well-known."

467
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,320
That's too obvious.

468
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,600
Boring!

469
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,120
Then let me come up with

470
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,360
a more romantic explanation.

471
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,040
Go ahead.

472
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,320
Let me think.

473
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,770
It's a little far-fetched,

474
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,330
but I'm sure you'll like it.

475
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,840
"I'd take the Yuhong Herb

476
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,200
and live in my dreamland forever."

477
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,200
Have you heard of that?

478
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:32,720
No.

479
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,180
What's that about?

480
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,520
Legend has it that in the Kunlun Mountains

481
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,380
exists a plant named Yuhong Herb.

482
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,060
If one accidentally takes it,

483
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,180
they would fall asleep for 300 years.

484
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,760
Hong Xiaoyu.

485
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,040
Hong Yu, Yuhong.

486
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,680
Don't you think your name

487
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,160
could actually mean

488
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,090
the Yuhong Herb?

489
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,360
I like this explanation!

490
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,160
That's what I'll tell people in the future!

491
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:00,180
The rain seems to be getting heavier.

492
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,520
Our Shi Yi is 26 years old.

493
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,970
Though she's stunning,

494
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,480
she's never been in love.

495
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,720
May Buddha bless her!

496
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:13,840
If she and the chemistry professor

497
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,240
are meant to be together,

498
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,320
then please stop the rain!

499
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,840
Buddha said yes!

500
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:52,080
I dreamt of Chang'an a lot when I was little.

501
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,440
I loved reading

502
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,120
stories about this place.

503
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:58,180
That's why I've always wanted to visit here.

504
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,800
You told me that before.

505
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,040
Go to sleep.

506
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,200
I don't think the rain will stop.

507
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:30,940
[Meilin]

508
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:41,840
Hello?

509
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:42,840
Hello.

510
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,890
You are getting famous now!

511
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,940
Producers are lining up to have you dub their shows.

512
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,520
A producer contacted me

513
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,240
and wanted you to be a supporting actress in his movie.

514
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,200
He said your look and temperament

515
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,760
are perfect for the role.

516
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,840
I told him

517
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,160
to drop that thought

518
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,040
and that you've turned down

519
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,200
quite a few auditions.

520
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,320
You only want to be a good dubber,

521
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,280
not an actress.

Don't tell me you're sunburnt.

You are here early, Mr. Zhousheng!

557

But of course, we are even earlier.

558

20 minutes early so that we wouldn't be late.

Okay.

Now that you are here,

575
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,840
you first need to know about its history.

576
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:39,640
In 1996,

577
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,240
the State Council declared

578
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,200
the Azure Dragon Temple

579
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,000
to be a critical national relic.

580
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,200
In 1986,

581
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,480
the temple brought in over 1,000

582
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,640
cherry blossom trees

583
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,900
and planted them here.

584
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,160
There are altogether 12

585
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,080
rare species of cherry blossom here.

586
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,320
Speaking of enjoying cherry blossoms,

587
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,840
one must come to the Azure Dragon Temple.

588
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:56,700
Why you may ask.

589
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,440
Because the temple has

604
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,160
Is the recording bad?

605
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,810
There's too much noise.

606
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,520
Let's go over there.

607
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:43,360
You seem to like Xi'an a lot.

608
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,640
When I first came here,

609
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,400
a friend of mine at the institute

610
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:54,920
gave me

611
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,440
a guide book to Xi'an.

612
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,240
If you like it,

613
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,800
I could give it to you.

614
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,280
This city

615
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,480
is full of stories.

616
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:07,920
True.

617
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,300
It was the capital of several dynasties.

618
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,770
Do you like reading?

619
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,200
Yes.

620
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,280
I set aside

621
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,400
a certain amount of time every day for reading.

622
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,060
What kind of books do you like?

623
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,800
As long as it's interesting,

624
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:25,680
I'd read it.

625
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,600
Have you visited

626
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,330
old-fashioned libraries,

627
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,600
where numerous books

628
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,460
are put on the wooden shelves?

629
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,480
Old-fashioned libraries?

630
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:42,960
Yes.

631
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,360
There are some in Jiangsu and Zhejiang.

632
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,690
My parents took me there when I was little.

633
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,600
The place I often go to

634
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,160
also has wooden shelves,

635
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,360
but they are all occupied

636
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,820
by bottles and containers

637
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,680
and all kinds of dangerous instruments.

638
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,000
Most of the things are

639
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,560
off limits.

640
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,250
It sounds interesting.

641
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,120
You think so?

642
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,960
Any incorrect operation

643
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:09,280
could lead to burns

644
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,440
or even explosions.

645
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,100
It's a high-risk profession!

646
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,199
If it's really like what you said,

647
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:18,860
who would want to work in a lab?

648
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,639
Well, it's not that scary.

649
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,860
But your operations must be correct.

650
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:26,000
When I first started uni,

651
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,480
there was one night

652
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:29,159
where I suddenly remembered

653
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:29,800
that I left something

654
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,880
in the lab.

655
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:32,120
I thought

656
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:34,480
I could go fetch it at six the next morning.

657
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,000
But at the next morning,

658
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:38,600
the empty lab somehow

659
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,239
had an explosion.

660
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,800
Half of the lab was blown up.

661
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,520
Luckily,

662
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:46,520
I got up five or six minutes late that morning.

663
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,440
Otherwise,

664
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:48,340
I don't know

665
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,090
what would have happened to me.

666
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:52,010
And then what happened?

667
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:54,560
And then...

668
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,570
Things didn't turn out too bad.

669
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:58,000
The dozen of samples I made

670
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
were still there.

671
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,400
And I moved them

672
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,620
to the lab next door

673
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,720
that afternoon

674
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,890
and continued the tolerance test.

675
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:12,520
Thank you!

676
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:22,900
What's the matter?

677
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,160
My legs look short.

678
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,040
Make them look longer!

679
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:25,760
Even longer?

680
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,490
Yea! Come on!

681
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:28,440
Fine!

682
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,900
Hurry up! One more!

683
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:31,560
Like this...

684
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,120
Hong Xiaoyu suggested we come

685
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:35,380
to the Azure Dragon Temple because of me.

686
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,720
I've heard of this place before.

687
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,080
There's also an Azure Dragon Temple

688
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,240
in that movie.

689
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,370
But the two temples are different.

690
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,560
This temple was built in the Sui Dynasty,

691
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,290
later than the one in the movie.

692

694

[Do good and receive good karma]

696
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,280
We should've gone to see the terracotta warriors.

697
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,210
At least the place is bigger there.

698
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,340
Where shall we go next?

699
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:00,890
I have a student,

700
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:01,680
whose family opened

701
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,080
a tea house in the neighborhood.

702
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,640
If you guys don't mind,

703
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,960
he'd like to invite you guys for some sea.

704

He's the guy you met

yesterday, by the way.

706

Do you have time?

707
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,080
Yes. I do.

She's free all day!

709
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,930
The tea house is nearby.

I'll bring you guys there.

711

You are reserved, and he's polite.

Would you guys like to take a picture?

719
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,360
No. It's okay.

720

Xiaoyu is. I'm here to keep her company.

726
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:50,520
I've never been to Xi'an,

727
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,480
so I wanted to come

728
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,740
and have a look around.

729
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:53,680
Xi'an has

730
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,180
many interesting places.

731
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,650
It'd take a while for you to visit them all.

732

Thank you!

Would you guys like to play some games?

735
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,560
Aeroplane chess, checkers,

736

or poker?

I'm okay with anything.

Aeroplane chess and checkers

739
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,160
are a little boring.

740
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,880
But you don't know how to play poker.

741

It's okay. I'll watch you guys play.

742
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,120
All right, then.

Yes.

Then I'll go get the cards.

746

I may as well show you after photographing.

751
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,360
Let me see that one first.

752

I haven't photoshopped it yet.

and the Ancient City Wall?

761
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,560
We are going to visit the Ancient City Wall

762
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,760
but we won't go to the Giant Wild Goose Pagoda.

763

Why is that?

764
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,600
The Giant Wild Goose Pagoda is very beautiful.

765
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,040
You should go check it out.

766

from the pagoda.

769
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:03,520
Then the place you guys are staying is very nice!

770
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,880
That hotel is nice for sure.

771
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:05,840

773

Mr. Zhousheng,

774
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,120

775
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,120
any hobbies?

776
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,560
I have quite a few.

777
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,600
I like watching TV dramas.

778
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,080
What's your favorite

779
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:24,680
TV drama?

780
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,280
"A Step into the Past".

781
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,540
"A Step into the Past"?

782
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,960
Even a chemistry professor likes time-travel dramas!

783
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,760
It's even "A Step into the Past"!

784
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:34,640
Do you remember

785
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,320
my ex during college?

786
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,720
He also loved that show.

787
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,080
He watched it four times.

788

789
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,760
over 70 times.

790
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,440
To be specific, it'd be

791
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:46,800
79 times.

792

79 times?

796
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,760

Yes.

This one. You can put it here.

804

00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:40,320
whom I've ever

862
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:43,440
wanted to marry.

863
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:49,840
Even now I'm still torn.

864
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:51,880
If you are hesitant

865
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:53,880
or confused about

866
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,400
your upcoming marriage,

867
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:56,760
you should talk

868
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:58,680
to Zhou Wenchuan, your fiance,

869
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,200
not me.

870
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:04,040
If you are here to bring me the invitation,

871
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:06,210
it's well received.

872
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:06,880
Thank you.

873
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:12,960
Maybe I'm not hesitant.

874
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:17,100
I'm just thinking about the past.

875
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:21,410
My wedding is scheduled early next month.

876
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:23,800
You will be there, right?

877
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:25,400
I should be back

878
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:26,840
at that time.

879
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:30,880
I'll see you then.

880
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:36,280
My colleague is still waiting for me downstairs.

881
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:37,080
I'm leaving.

882
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:39,320
Okay.

883
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:58,240
Professor.

884
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:00,440
What's the relationship

885
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:01,900
between you and Miss Tong?

886
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:04,760
There's nothing

887
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:06,000
between her and I.

888
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:07,770
That's good to know.

889
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:10,410
Why are you so happy?

890
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:13,440
Well, she came with a smile

891
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:14,600
and left in tears.

892
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:16,480
I thought she was your...

893
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:20,320
And I was worried about Shi Yi...

894
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:24,440
Why would you

895
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:25,920
think of Shi Yi at this moment?

896
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,760
Professor, stop playing dumb.

897
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:29,280
Shi Yi likes you.

898
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:30,940
It's very obvious.

899
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,000
I think she fell in love with you

900
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,360
when she first met you at the airport.

901
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:36,080
You treat her differently too.

902
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:38,280
Not only did you visit the Azure Dragon Temple with her,

903
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:39,720
you even called a taxi for her.

904
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:41,000
If you don't have feelings for her,

905
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,240
then what's all this?

906
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:44,780
Is that all you think about

907
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,280
when you're here?

908
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,560
I...I've been thinking about the experiments.

909
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:52,200
I'll do the experiment.

910
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:55,320
Close the door.
