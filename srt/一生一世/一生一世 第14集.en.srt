00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,840
Have you told her?

5
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,360
The sooner I tell her,

6
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,560
the more I'd worry.

7
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,880
I won't say anything until the delay is confirmed.

8
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,240
And you?

9
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,810
What's going on?

10
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,530
Are you drunk again?

Everybody has his own problems.

You can't help with mine.

13

So, don't ask.

Let's go.

15
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,770
It happened all of a sudden.

16
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,730
I don't think it was a coincidence.

17
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,440
It boils down to one thing,

18
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,240
to stop you from going back home.

19
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:43,880
I even skipped my lunch

20
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,440

21
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:47,630
Thank you so much!

22
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:49,480
I'll take you out for something nice after you are back!

23
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,840
I'll count on that!

24
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,230
You bet!

Bye-bye!

Miss Shi Yi.

27
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,450
What a coincidence!

28
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,320
Not quite.

29
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,680
I've been in Bremen for a week.

30
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:09,730
And I have been hoping to meet you.

31
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:12,870
Your brother didn't mention anything.

32
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,340
He didn't?

33
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,940
Maybe he was afraid that you'd misunderstand.

34
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,579
I'd misunderstand?

35
00:03:21,579 --> 00:03:22,420
About what?

36
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,460
He and my wife…

37
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,340
Your wife?

38
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,420
You may not know

39
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,460
that my brother was once engaged

40
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:41,860
with my wife Tong Jiaren.

41
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:46,880
It a was long time ago.

42
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,070
And because of that,

43
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:52,420
Jiaren had been following my brother's steps

44
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:54,020
during her schooling years.

45
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,060
They were like

46
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:56,860
childhood sweethearts.

47
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,500
But for some reasons,

48
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,830
their engagement got canceled later.

49
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:08,660
And then

50
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:10,940
she married me.

51
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,700
The things happened in between

52
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,100
were quite complicated.

53
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:22,780
You can ask my brother

54
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,260
if you wanna know.

55
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,260
My wife is as devoted into science

56
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,300
as my brother.

57
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,060
Honestly,

58
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,430
I don't quite understand them.

59
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:38,460
I'm as lonely

60
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,580
as you are.

61
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:41,800
I'd usually take a walk

62
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,840
in this neighborhood when I'm alone.

63
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:55,300

I don't want to ruin it

68
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:12,220
because of their relationship in the past.

69
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,500
So, I hope you can also keep it

to yourself.

71
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,600
Don't make a big deal out of it.

72
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:23,860
But it's got to be solved.

I haven't told others.

120

I don't think he did that.

121
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:41,500
But an investigation

122
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:42,820
is still necessary

124
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:47,580
It's an absurd accusation,

125
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:48,860
but he's willing to cooperate

126
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:51,420
and accept the financial investigation.

He came to you?

131
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:26,620
Did he give you

132
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,140
this ring?

133
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:38,180
Did he also tell you the relationship

134
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,980
between Tong Jiaren and me?

135
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:44,990
How much did he tell you?

136
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:46,380
Should I

137
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:47,740
tell you more?

138
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,420
You are not afraid that I'd be upset?

139
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:56,820
I believe

140
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,320
that you can make the right judgment.

141
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,700
Is this the ring you lost?

142
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:09,740
Yes.

143
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,220
No one would be that stupid

144
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,740
to give the ring engraved with a wedding date

145
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,100
to someone as a gift.

146
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:17,220
Perhaps someone found it and gave it to Tong Jiaren,

147
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:19,820
and then your younger brother misunderstood.

148
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,260
I'm glad you can think of it this way.

149
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,720
Don't you wanna explain it to him?

150
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:28,860
No need.

151
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:31,790
There's nothing that I should explain to him.

152
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,220
I've known Tong Jiaren

153
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:44,620
since childhood.

154
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:45,900
We went

155
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,140
to the same school

156
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,380
and studied overseas together.

157
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:51,980
Then we became colleagues at the same institute.

158
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:54,020
We worked together

159
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,340
once in a while.

160
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:58,140
Later,

161
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:01,340
her elder sister married my uncle,

162
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,420
so our engagement was canceled.

163
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,380
After that,

164
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:07,820
I don't know

165
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,140
what happened,

166
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,960
but she married Wenchuan.

167
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:12,820
Her elder sister?

168
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,500
She's Ren's mother.

169
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:18,780
But I've never seen her at home.

170
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,140
Ren's mother

171
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,020
passed away when Ren was only

172
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,380
a few years old.

173
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:38,620
Shi Yi.

174
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,580
Before, I didn't give much thought

175
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,180
to my marriage.

176
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:46,110
I only followed my family's arrangement.

177
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,540
If I did anything wrong,

178
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,940
or I made you unhappy,

179
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:50,480
please forgive me.

180
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:54,020
It'd be unreasonable to have you

181
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,780
apologize for the things happened in the past.

182
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:02,500
My grandma called me last night and told me

183
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,420
love was much more important

184
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,300
than reasoning

185
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:07,740
between a couple.

186
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,180
She reminded me

187
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,630
that if I made you angry,

188
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,420
upset, or sad,

189
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,260
it'd never go wrong

190
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:17,460
to apologize first.

191
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,470
She knows that I'm here?

192
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:20,460
Yes.

193
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,340
Why are you staring at me?

194
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:32,780
You are really not angry?

195
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,460
I'm really not!

196
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:39,940
Who's your

197
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,270
best friend in Germany?

198
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:43,980
My best friend

199
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:44,860
in Germany

200
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,120
is my former roommate.

201
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:47,700
Why don't we invite him over?

202
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,100
I wanna meet your friend.

203
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:50,220
Sure.

204
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,200
Does he like Chinese food?

205
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,660
Have you cooked any for him before?

206
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:55,620
He does.

207
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:56,460
I used to cook

208
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:58,060
all kinds of noodles for him.

209
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:01,580
You make our Chinese cuisine

210
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,820
sound so monotonous!

211
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:03,840
Wait for me.

212
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:25,520
Shopping list!

213
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:31,540
[Beef, tomato, potato, onion, peanuts, green pepper, pork belly, carrot]

214
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:35,340
Are they hard to find?

215
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:37,100
They are all common groceries.

216
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:40,580
I just noticed

217
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:42,400
that your handwriting

218
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,660
is really nice.

219
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:45,780
I asked you to check the items,

220
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:46,910
not my handwriting!

221
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,340
Let's go! Come on!

222
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,040
Let's go shopping!

223
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:07,460
Mr. Zhou.

224
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,260
All the documents that you signed

225
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:11,390
have been rejected.

226
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,060
All of them?

227
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:14,820
Yes.

228
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:17,140
They won't proceed the payment

229
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:19,400
unless they are signed by Mr. Mei.

230
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:20,300
But

231
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,460
today is the due day for the payment.

232
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,140
Where's my brother?

233
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:28,140
In his apartment.

234
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,270
This is from Mr. Zhousheng.

235
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:37,420
He said

236
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:38,580
the documents must be signed by Mr. Mei

237
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:40,180
no matter how urgent the project is.

238
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:42,040
There's no room for negotiation.

239
00:14:58,660 --> 00:14:59,420
This

240
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:00,900
should belong to you.

241
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:10,460
[April 7]

242
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,100
Don't you wanna ask me

243
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,430
something about him when he was in school?

244
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:35,900
We were taught

245
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:36,980
by the same professor.

246
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,700
And he taught me Chinese.

247
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:41,600
No wonder your Chinese is so good.

248
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:46,120
It's made of meteorite, isn't it?

249
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:47,940
You can tell?

250
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,520
This is our expertise.

251
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,520
I can tell that at one glance.

252
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,740
It's a gift from Zhousheng Chen, right?

253
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:58,660
He told you about it?

254
00:15:58,660 --> 00:15:59,460
Nah.

255
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,260
There's no way

256
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,920
he'd tell anybody about this.

257
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:05,260
But as his old classmate,

258
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:06,460
I can guess it.

259
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:08,100
Why?

260
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:13,700
The graduation gift

261
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:16,350
that his most respected professor gave to him

262
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,540
was a piece of meteorite.

263
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,220
He even made a joke and said

264
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,460
his Chinese wife often told him

265
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:26,620
that one of the most romantic

266
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,500
lines in China was

267
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:31,820
"I'll pick a star for you

268
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:33,500
as a gift."

269
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,140
So, the professor asked him

270
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,540
to save it

271
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:41,740
for his future wife.

272
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:47,900
Here. Have some fruit.

273
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,900
Alright! Thanks!

274
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,020
What is it?

275
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:06,579
Your friend said

276
00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:08,300
you were a very popular

277
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,790
playboy in the college.

278
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:11,579
We have a guest now.

279
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,670
But I need an explanation tonight!

280
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,359
Here's something else about him.

281
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,859
Before graduation,

282
00:17:21,369 --> 00:17:23,500
he buried himself in the lab every day.

283
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:25,380
He only stayed at school

284
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:28,099
and completely isolated himself

285
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:29,430
from the outside world.

286
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:32,660
I helped him

287
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,460
find this apartment.

288
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:40,140
Watch out.

289
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:46,700
It's a new apartment building.

290
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:48,540
The rent is cheap,

291
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:51,380
and it's close to the institute.

292
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:53,860
The only problem is

293
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:57,620
that we have to pay six months' rent in advance.

294
00:17:59,020 --> 00:17:59,860
It's okay.

295
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:02,020
I've never used my scholarship.

296
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,220
It should be enough.

297
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:03,900
Really?

298
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,220
Good for you!

299
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,680
Which room do you want?

300
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:10,740
I don't care.

301
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:13,100
Then I'll have this room.

302
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,340
You take that one.

303
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:16,140
Okay.

304
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:16,870
Alright?

305
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:17,310
Okay.

306
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:18,300
Let's go unpack.

307
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,100
See you later.

308
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,840
From bachelor's degree to master's degree,

309
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,620
none of your family has ever visited you.

310
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,620
I think at least

311
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:38,260
someone should come for your doctorate.

312
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:43,000
I'll lend you the travel fare.

313
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,260
Seriously! I have money.

314
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,100
Though you've never said anything,

315
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,420
everybody can see

316
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:55,870
that you aren't well off

317
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,950
since you seldom go out for fun.

318
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:05,310
Thank you for seeing me as a friend!

319
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:07,840
But I really don't need your help.

320
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:09,520
I have my scholarship.

321
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,420
Alright! Cheers!

322
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:13,740
To friendship!

323
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:14,600
To friendship!

324
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:20,500
We thought

325
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,340
he didn't date

326
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,520
because of his financial situation.

327
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:27,980
But Tong Jiaren told us later

328
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,590
that he's actually from

329
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:31,620
a wealthy family.

330
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:34,420
He just has no material desires.

331
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,140
Well, it's time to go.

332
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:48,180
It's rare for you to be together.

333
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,700
I'll disturb you no more.

334
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,060
I've told her

335
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,790
about the meteorite story.

336
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,500
No need to thank me.

337
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:13,540
Why did you give me this that day?

338
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,230
Anything special about it?

339
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:18,900
Nothing special.

340
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:21,550
It's just a gift?

341
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:24,780
Just a gift.

342
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:31,540
If there's anything

343
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,140
special about it,

344
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:35,980
it's that the first iron tool

345
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,660
was made from meteorite.

346
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:39,420
Is that special

347
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:40,700
enough?

348
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:42,820
What?

349
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:43,780
You want me

350
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:46,040
to keep the origin of the Iron Age in mind?

351
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,220
Come on. I'll take you to a place.

352
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:54,860
Where?

353
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,150
You don't have to work tonight?

354
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:58,860
I want to

355
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,900
take some time

356
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,460
and spend with you today.

357
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:33,020
[Welsh Black Beer]

358
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:31,120
Wait here for a moment.

359
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:02,900
[Welsh Black Beer]

360
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,540
Shi Yi! Are you okay?

361
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,460
It's alright! It's alright! Don't be afraid!

362
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:40,420
I'm here!

363
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:41,830
Don't be afraid!

364
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,310
She fell asleep?

365
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,520
She must have been terrified.

366
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,180
She was alone

367
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:19,980
in the car.

368
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,140
If I had been with her,

369
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,700
it could've been better.

370
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,140
It happened so suddenly,

371
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,940
and it was a strange place to her.

372
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,440
Of course she'd be scared.

373
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:34,540
I've sent a lawyer to the police station for some information.

374
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:36,470
She's only been here for a few days,

375
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,960
and something happened to your lab work.

376
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,420
Have some warm water.

377
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:18,520
Still thinking about things happened earlier?

378
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:21,460
I don't want to,

379
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:25,260
but it keeps coming to my mind.

380
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:32,620
It was just an accident.

381
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,460
There was a mansion

382
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:36,190
near the florist we went to.

383
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:37,580
Two logistic companies

384
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:39,180
holding standing contracts

385
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,020
with the stores

386
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,680
in the mansion had a conflict.

387
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,300
It was just the wrong place,

388
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:44,500
the wrong time for us.

389
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:56,420
I was going to buy you

390
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:58,020
a dried flower bouquet

391
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,500
to thank you for cooking dinner.

392
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,150
I have never thought

393
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:05,190
something like that would happen.

394
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:11,180
You've been trying to comfort me for a whole night.

395
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,390
Say something else.

396
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,220
There's something

397
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:24,060
I was going to tell you

398
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:26,640
after giving you the flower bouquet.

399
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:27,460
What is it?

400
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:31,100
The work handover

401
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,620
is harder than I thought.

402
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,260
So, you may

403
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:38,270
have to fly back home on your own this time.

404
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:42,700
Then when will you go home?

405
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:45,940
I'm not sure.

406
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:55,900
Work comes first. It's okay.

407
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:58,740
A.S.A.P.?

408
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,220
I promise!

409
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:10,780
Seems like today is all about bad things

410
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:12,100
and bad news.

411
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:21,220
What can I do

412
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:22,860
to cheer you up?

413
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:30,580
Sweet talk.

414
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:35,860
What sweet talk?

415
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:38,900
Say something sweet to make me happy!

416
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:43,310
Okay.

417
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:54,420
That's it?

418
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:58,500
I'm thinking what I should say.

419
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:09,820
I'm very pretty, right?

420
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:11,820
Among all the people

421
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:13,060
you know,

422
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:14,360
am I the prettiest?

423
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:19,100
Or, if you know someone who's prettier than me…

424
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:19,740
No.

425
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:22,580
There's no one

426
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:24,260
who's prettier than you!

427
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:51,550
♫One more day with you♫

428
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,650
♫Love gets deeper♫

429
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:55,660
♫Making it a poem♫

430
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:59,170
♫Kissing through the long years♫

431
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,990
♫Wrapping love around my fingertips♫

♫Thank you for being there♫

439
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:23,940
What are you thinking?

440
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:30,940
Why didn't you dry your hair?

441
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:41,220
I had a lot of meetings lately

442
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,820
and I'm way behind in my work.

443
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:44,380
I'll have to stay up

444
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,420
for work again.

445
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:00,340
You big nerd!

446
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:55,390
I'm going to bed.

447
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,120
Alright. Goodnight!

448
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,740
Shall I close the door for you?

449
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:02,540
No.

450
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,660
Won't I disturb you?

451
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:07,180
Of course not.

452
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:09,020
I can hear you

453
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:10,080
with the door open.

454
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:11,540
And that makes me

455
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:12,780
feel relieved.

456
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,720
He really slept in the study?

457
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:21,140
You are cooking spaghetti?

458
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:22,180
You get up!

459
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:25,700
I'm cooking oil-splashed noodles.

460
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:28,420
With this?

461
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:30,720
It's all I have at home.

462
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:32,520
And I'm short of ingredients.

463
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:34,900
But I'll do my best.

464
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:44,380
I stayed in an industrial park

465
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:45,340
for two months

466
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:46,390
in Xi'an before.

467
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:48,380
Back then that area was still under construction,

468
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:50,460
so there weren't any restaurants nearby.

469
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:51,700
Sometimes when I was busy,

470
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:53,100
I'd miss my meal,

471
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:55,420
so I learned how to cook this

472
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:56,880
from He Shan's mother.

473
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:59,420
But I could

474
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,100
only learn it over the phone.

475
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:02,180
As a result,

476
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,760
I failed quite a few times.

477
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,140
But now, I can pretty much

478
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:06,780
do it right every time.

479
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:11,060
Wouldn't you be tired of eating this every day?

480
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,780
I can make different flavors of noodles.

481
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:15,140
I've mastered them all.

482
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:16,980
Actually,

483
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,100
I learned all these

484
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,030
from the parents

485
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,340
of my students.

486
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:23,020
None of my students

487
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:24,620
knows how to cook.

488
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:33,220
Your cooking looks like an experiment.

489
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:38,940
Some people would really do experiments

490
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:40,220
in the kitchen.

491
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:43,700
What kinda experiments can you do in a kitchen?

492
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:46,780
There was a chemist

493
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,300
who did experiments in the kitchen.

494
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:49,500
And he knocked off sulfuric acid

495
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,620
and saltpeter powder by accident.

496
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:52,140
In fear of being yelled by his wife,

497
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:53,380
he picked up

498
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,780
the nearest apron,

499
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,450
cleaned everything up,

500
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:58,220
and hung the apron outside to dry.

501
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:59,620
He thought he could easily

502
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,500
cover it up,

503
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:02,180
but his wife

504
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:04,700
found out anyway.

505
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:08,480
Because the apron exploded into pieces.

506
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:11,699
But because of this accident,

507
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:12,500
he discovered

508
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:14,190
the first explosive fiber,

509
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,540
cellulose nitrate.

510
00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:25,820
Watching you cooking is so fun!

511
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:28,080
It's pleasing to the mouth and to the ear!

512
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:29,820
When you told me you'd cook noodles yesterday,

513
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:31,750
I thought it'd be instant noodles.

514
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,260
It's true that I used to cook

515
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:35,260
instant noodles a lot.

516
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:36,060
But later,

517
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:38,510
I learned how to cook all kinds of noodles.

518
00:34:39,699 --> 00:34:40,900
Is it because you love

519
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:41,989
eating noodles?

520
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:44,920
I just thought it was convenient.

521
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:45,820
In my opinion, noodles

522
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:47,620
are the most convenient staple.

523
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:48,980
Not only can they

524
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:49,980
satisfy our appetite,

525
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:51,420
but also take the shortest

526
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:53,260
time to prepare.

527
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:56,139
How pitiful!

528
00:34:58,820 --> 00:34:59,540
Pitiful?

529
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:02,340
Eating the same food all the time

530
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:03,940
will lead to nutritional imbalance.

531
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:04,980
When we go back to Shanghai,

532
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,020
let's eat more vegetables

533
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,150
instead of noodles.

534
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:08,460
I'll cook for you.

535
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:10,260
Okay.

536
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:11,470
Let's go.

537
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:17,460
Here. Have a taste.

538
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:29,020
Yummy!

539
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:30,060
If you weren't a researcher,

540
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:32,060
you could open a noodle restaurant.

541
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:33,030
I'm well aware

542
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:34,420
of my own cooking skills.

543
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:35,680
You are flattering me.

544
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:37,060
I like it!

545
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:44,700
When I…

546
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,820
When I go back home,

547
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:50,600
let's move in together.

548
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:55,240
I'll get you a bottle of water.

549
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:01,620
Here.

550
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:06,100
Did I put

551
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:07,340
too much chili?

552
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:08,870
I'll put less next time.

553
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:15,020
Uncle Lin said we need

554
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:17,340
a ceremony to make our marriage formal.

555
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:22,460
I agree.

556
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:27,260
Then how about I put

557
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:28,980
a camp bed for you in the study?

558
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,240
You won't mind, right?

559
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:35,420
No.

560
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:37,100
I won't.

561
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:45,140
You didn't cook anything for yourself?

562
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:47,310
I've had breakfast.

563
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:49,420
I usually get up three hours

564
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:50,460
before you do.

565
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:57,020
How do you know when I get up?

566
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,380
I paid attention to it when you stayed

567
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:00,220
at my home.

568
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:01,910
Makes sense!

569
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:04,420
Your family eats breakfast at 5 a.m.

570
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:05,460
When I got up,

571
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:07,350
they'd already had breakfast.

572
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:13,060
So tasty!

573
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,100
Here. Your hair drier.

574
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:25,020
You keep it.

575
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:27,190
You don't have one here, right?

576
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,060
Hold on.

577
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:41,640
I'll take this with me.

578
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:45,600
Is the car here?

579
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:47,540
Yes.

580
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,100
Then let's go.

581
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:50,460
Let me help you.

582
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,610
I have something to talk to him.

583
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:09,120
He told me you'd leave today.

584
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,250
I can give you a ride.

585
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:13,780
Let's go.

586
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:19,430
Let's drive her to the airport.

587
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:20,300
Come on.

588
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:37,860
Every time I go through the security,

589
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:39,260
I'd think of the first time we met

590
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:40,860
at the airport in Guangzhou.

591
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:42,150
You had nothing else

592
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:43,460
but one laptop bag,

593
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:45,380
yet they asked you for a recheck.

594
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:46,940
That was

595
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:48,140
the first time ever

596
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:50,020
I'd been asked for a recheck.

597
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:53,260
Thank you, security check!

598
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:58,300
The security check at Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport.

599
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:08,310
Are you thirsty?

600
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:11,420
A little.

601
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:15,140
Wait a sec.

602
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:16,560
I'll go get you a bottle of water.

603
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,700
It's okay, there's…

604
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:21,900
Why the rush! I haven't finished yet.

605
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:33,100
Here.

606
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:33,720
Thanks!

607
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:43,020
I could just buy one inside.

608
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:44,780
I just had a sip and I can't bring it in.

609
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:45,510
It's a waste.

610
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:48,580
It's okay. I can take it

611
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:50,160
and drink it on my way back.

612
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:55,380
We are talking

613
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:57,510
about a bottle of water before I leave.

614
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:00,910
I'll save the special words

615
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,500
for the next time when we

616
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:03,780
get together.

617
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:08,940
Then I'm leaving.

618
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,540
I'll let you know when I land.

619
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:12,180
Come home A.S.A.P.

620
00:40:12,490 --> 00:40:13,420
I'll miss you!

621
00:40:14,570 --> 00:40:18,010
♫Those familiar eyes♫

622
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:16,510
Bye-bye!

623
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:22,560
♫Lost the past when we shed tears♫

624
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:25,150
♫It won't change♫

625
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:27,680
♫Our fate of encounter♫

626
00:40:27,810 --> 00:40:30,880
♫The poem I'll continue to write♫

627
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:35,760
♫With your name in each line♫

628
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:38,330
♫If it started all over again♫

629
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:43,160
♫I'd still remember our love♫

630
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,010
♫It took♫

631
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:46,920
♫Hundreds of centuries♫

632

♫For our love to begin♫

633
00:40:50,930 --> 00:40:57,940
♫There's no way it'd end♫

634
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:26,420
I should have given her a hug.

635
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:28,940
But I haven't found a chance.

636
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:33,300
Why am I always like this?

637
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:40,060
Is the guy on the same flight with her

638
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:40,860
trustworthy?

639
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:42,060
Rest assured.

640
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:44,850
He's been my assistant for years.

641
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:47,180
He'll make sure she gets back home safely.

642
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:51,660
My man

643
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:54,120
went to the police station for information.

644
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:55,230
Unfortunately,

645
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:58,120
there was nothing wrong about it.

646
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:00,220
All the evidence

647
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:01,340
suggests that it was

648
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:02,670
only a random fighting.

649
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:03,620
You guys were just

650
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:05,950
two of the victims who happened to be there.

651
00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:07,830
But my instinct tells me that it wasn't that simple.

652
00:42:07,830 --> 00:42:09,490
You must go home immediately.

653
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:10,020
There are too many

654
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:11,950
uncertainties if you stay abroad.

655
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:13,300
When's the earliest can we

656
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:15,210
get the result of the financial investigation.

657
00:42:15,210 --> 00:42:16,740
30 something working days.

658
00:42:17,470 --> 00:42:18,480
More than a month?

659
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:19,940
If you want to go back,

660
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:21,870
I can arrange it for you at any time.

661
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,210
I can't go back without knowing the truth.

662
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:28,340
I need to wait till the result

663
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:30,140
of the investigation comes out.

664
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:31,180
Otherwise,

665
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:33,580
it'd not only be unfair to myself,

666
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:35,900
it'd also affect the institute's attitude

667
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:36,580
toward the future recruitment

668
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:38,100
of Chinese students.

669
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:41,020
As a lawyer,

670
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:43,000
I don't agree with you.

671
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:48,210
But as your friend,

672
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:50,780
I respect your decision.

673
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:54,140
Let's go.

674
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:13,700
[After the Eastern and Western Jin Dynasties, the imperial authority…]

675
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:16,060
After the Eastern and Western Jin Dynasties, the imperial authority

676
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:18,380
during the Southern and Northern Dynasties became even shakier.

677
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:19,660
The real power was in the hands of the generals

678
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:22,660
with military leadership and the prestigious clans.

679
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:25,540
Due to the strategic importance of Chang'an,

680
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:29,270
those who stationed there were seen as a threat to the capital city.

681
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:57,740
Hanging a tea bag in the closet can keep moths away.

682
00:43:57,740 --> 00:44:00,270
A bachelor like you wouldn't know about this!

683
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:13,700
Sir.

684
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:15,820
Would you like to change the sheet?

685
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:19,730
No need.

686
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:20,300
Okay.

687
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:20,920
Thanks.

688
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:48,900
What are you

689
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:50,260
puzzling over?

690
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:55,100
No puzzle, but no answer either.

691
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:57,820
About natural science

692
00:44:57,980 --> 00:44:59,460
