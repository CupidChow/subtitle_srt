[Episode 18]

4
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:46,280
What are you doing?

5
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:51,220
The things you said just now.

6
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:52,340
Who gave them to you?

7
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:53,800
Zhousheng Chen's cousin.

8
00:01:54,979 --> 00:01:56,020
What's going on between you

9
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:56,820
and Chen?

10
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,539
He sneaked in for a night?

11
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:00,430
We got our marriage certificate.

12
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,000
Shh.

13
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,620
You two are pretty gutsy.

14
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:07,220
Getting your marriage certificate in secret.

15
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:08,800
There's a reason for that.

16
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,660
Did you tell your mother?

17
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,270
He just got back.

18
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,430
We plan to tell them in a couple of days.

19
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:20,900
My dad called your dad

20
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,340
several days ago.

21
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:24,060
He was telling your dad that the two of you should break up.

22
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,220
He said Zhousheng Chen's family

23
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,820
didn't accept you as his girlfriend.

24
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:30,420
So you'll have a hard time over at their family.

25
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:32,390
Your parents...

26
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,940
Your parents even told my dad

27
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,300
they still can't let go the fact that

28
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,660
his parents didn't want to meet up.

29
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:40,340
Now you've even got your certificate

30
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:41,980
but his mother still refuses to see you.

31
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:44,579
Your parents will definitely become furious.

32
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,460
That's why

33
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:49,260
I don't know how to tell them.

34
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,350
What about Zhousheng Chen?

35
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,670
We haven't really talked about it.

36
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:57,480
Let's not talk about this.

37
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,740
I'll cook for you guys.

38
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,110
Good morning, sir.

39
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:10,420
Good morning, sir.

40
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:11,220
Good morning.

41
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,830
-Professor Zhousheng.
-Let's go.

42
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:15,430
Director.

43
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,590
Let me make the introductions.

44
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:19,520
He is the person

45
00:03:19,579 --> 00:03:20,660
in charge of our

46
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:21,380
key laboratory,

47
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:22,910
Professor Zhousheng Chen.

48
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:23,660
This is

49
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,100
Professor Zhang

50
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:26,460
from Department of Chemistry, Zhenghua University.

51
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:26,820
Professor Zhang.

52
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:27,340
Nice to meet you.

53
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,600
This is Professor Jin.

54
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:29,540
Professor Jin.

55
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:30,470
Nice to meet you.

56
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:31,420
By the way,

57
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:33,540
your school has hired him before, right?

58
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,820
Yes, I remember.

59
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,820
He was a visiting professor.

60
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:39,340
Mr. Zhousheng is young and talented.

61
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,900
You're about 25 or 26 years old?

62
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,340
I'm already 28.

63
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:46,780
I must say.

64
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,500
He's changed since he came back.

65
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,430
He's getting younger and younger.

66
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,579
This is the style my wife likes.

67
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,230
That's good.

68
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:57,100
A man who values his family

69
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:59,800
must have a strong sense of responsibility.

70
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:00,940
Would you mind showing us

71
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,260
your lab?

72
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,000
Please come in.

73
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:04,420
Okay.

74
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,260
Are you interested in

75
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,019
a collaborative lab

76
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:18,300
with our institute?

77
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:21,140
I don't have the energy anymore.

78
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,140
In fact, these two

79
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:24,180
have always been

80
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,420
in charge of the lab here.

81
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,500
I'm already working on

82
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,420
a new lab.

83
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:29,740
Li.

84
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:32,420
It seems that you can't retain talents.

85
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,400
Professor Jin.

86
00:04:34,659 --> 00:04:35,780
No matter what you say,

87
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:36,740
I've convinced him to

88
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:37,980
set up a lab here.

89
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:38,860
And you?

90
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,300
You didn't even have a chance

91
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,230
to convince him.

92
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,140
I can't compete with you

93
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,500
in talent grabbing.

94
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,100
Where is your new lab?

95
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:49,500
In Xi'an.

96
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:50,740
Xi'an?

97
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,260
I tried my best to make him stay.

98
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,180
But he's determined to go to Xi'an.

99
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,900
Why? Are your parents there?

100
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,180
I'm interested in the project they are doing.

101
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:02,020
Besides, my wife likes it there.

102
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:03,660
This way.

103
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:03,990
Okay.

104
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:09,910
Everything is the same.

105
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:11,780
Nothing has changed.

106
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,300
The last time we met,

107
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,680
your eldest brother was here.

108
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,700
All these years, you ran the Zhou family.

109
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,430
It's been hard work.

110
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:25,780
Now it's all good.

111
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,680
Chen is now in charge of

112
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:28,980
all the business.

113
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:31,020
The son takes over the business from his father.

114
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:33,340
As for me, I can enjoy my retirement.

115
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,300
I wonder if

116
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,220
Mei Xing has

117
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:39,260
a girlfriend to get married with?

118
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,480
Not yet.

119
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:46,240
I have no plans for the time being.

120
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:53,620
Wenxing

121
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:54,780
lived with your family for two years

122
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,260
when she was little.

123
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:57,940
She has a deeper bond with your family

124
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,470
than with her two brothers.

125
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,780
Every time you come here,

126
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:03,420
she would always greet you at the door

127
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:04,620
without fail.

128
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,300
I mean,

129
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,940
if neither of them

130
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,540
has a suitable match,

131
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,620
why not let them

132
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,120
spend some time together?

133
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:19,220
Mom.

134
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,100
You should have asked me first.

135
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,500
I'm asking you now.

136
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,140
But you misunderstood.

137
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:25,540
How embarrassing it is for us

138
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:26,800
to say it in front of us.

139
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,390
It seems that Mei Xing

140
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:34,820
still has a long way to go

141
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:37,000
in terms of dating.

142
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:38,060
You see?

143
00:06:38,659 --> 00:06:40,590
Even the person who grew up with you

144
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,200
doesn't dare to marry you.

145
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,060
Uncle Mei.

146
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,020
That's not what I meant.

147
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:46,740
It's okay.

148
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:49,380
Yes, Dad.

149
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:50,980
You're right.

150
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,260
Wenxing is too good.

151
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:54,590
I don't deserve her.

152
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:56,700
I've always hoped that

153
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:59,400
she could meet someone she really likes,

154
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:01,270
someone who treats her right,

155
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:03,490
keeps her company and takes care of her.

156
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,340
I really had no idea my mother and uncle

157
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:18,000
would suddenly bring this up.

158
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,180
I'm sorry.

159
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,020
Sorry for what?

160
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,340
I'm a big man.

161
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,580
I have thick skin.

162
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,220
You guys are leaving now?

163
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:28,980
Yes.

164
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,300
The thing you mentioned earlier...

165
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,380
Stay for dinner.

166
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,060
No.

167
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:40,870
It's too much trouble to eat at your house.

168
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,180
You have a big family.

169
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:45,020
We're going home.

170
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,500
It's more relaxing

171
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,020
to eat with my disciples.

172
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,220
Stay.

173
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:50,300
I'll have the chefs

174
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,700
make your favorite food.

175
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,180
Please carry on.

176
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:55,590
I have something to do.

177
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:06,440
Is that him?

178
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:07,940
It's not him.

179
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,100
If it's him,

180
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,260
I've just estimated

181
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,660
his measurements.

182
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,900
If you want me to make a suit for him, you can tell me anytime.

183
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:15,960
There is one thing.

184
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:17,940
I have a packed schedule.

185
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,740
I can allow you to skip the queue,

186
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,420
but you need to tell me at least three months in advance.

187
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:23,100
It's not him. Don't make any guesses.

188
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,100
It's not him?

189
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,260
It's not?

190
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:27,180
Can you stop looking?

191
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:35,320
Where's your eldest brother?

192
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:36,549
In Shanghai I think.

193
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:37,740
Shi Yi is there.

194
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,179
He must be with her.

195
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,360
He's not staying here?

196
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,860
My mother doesn't like Shi Yi.

197
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,220
She won't even let us

198
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:47,080
call Shi Yi sister-in-law in front of her.

199
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,220
Chen must not want her to come back

200
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:50,840
in case she'll suffer.

201
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,820
Why did you come so early?

202
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,280
I only realized

203
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:16,710
you were wearing slippers after you left.

204
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:20,140
When did you change them?

205
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:20,860
At the lab?

206
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,210
I bought them today.

207
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:23,500
My parents asked us

208
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,700
to go home for dinner.

209
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,940
Dinner?

210
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,990
Are your grandparents still home?

211
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:33,460
Yes.

212
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,620
Yuanyuan insisted on eating the dinner I cooked.

213
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:36,820
And my parents asked me to come over.

214
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,100
I had no choice but to make it first.

215
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,630
Let them heat it up tonight.

216
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,220
Before dinner,

217
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,780
go somewhere with me first.

218
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,220
Wait for me in the study.

219
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:58,380
[Happiness]

220
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,820
[Happiness]

221
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:12,830
We can go now.

222
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:16,740
Grandma made this.

223
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,340
I put it up to see how it looks.

224
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,180
Don't look, we're going to be late.

225
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:22,710
Let's go.

226
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,540
Should we come up with something to say

227
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:37,460
ahead of time?

228
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,420
So that we don't say the wrong things.

229
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,820
Actually, I don't know

230
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:41,880
what to say either.

231
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,260
My earlier plan was to

232
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,500
tell it to them directly.

233
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,580
Then excuse ourselves

234
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,910
so that you won't get beat up by my parents.

235
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:49,500
Ah.

236
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,620
I have another idea.

237
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,100
I haven't told you

238
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:57,260
because I was afraid you would mind.

239
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,220
I won't mind whatever it is.

240
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:00,580
I haven't said it yet

241
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:01,500
but you're already so agreeable?

242
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,230
You don't have any principles.

243
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,180
I'm thinking

244
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,220
we don't mention us getting the marriage certificate

245
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:09,260
before our families officially meet.

246
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,740
That means you'll have to bear with

247
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:11,700
being called my boyfriend

248
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:12,900
in front of my family.

249
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:14,780
When your relationship with your family

250
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:15,440
gets better

251
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:16,820
and we've set a date for our wedding,

252
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,350
then we'll tell my parents.

253
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:19,900
This is a step-by-step process.

254
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:20,700
So it may be easier for

255
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,260
my parents to accept it.

256
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,420
The only thing is that it won't be fair to you.

257
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:26,140
It's like I don't want to admit

258
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,740
our legal relationship.

259
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,220
Luckily.

260
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,750
Luckily, I'm protected by the law.

261
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,220
Don't worry.

262
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,300
You have half

263
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:39,660
of everything I have.

264
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:40,790
I won't do you dirty.

265
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:43,670
You'd better keep the promise.

266
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:47,610
Oh, right.

267
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:54,550
We wouldn't want to give the game away.

268
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:55,990
Let's go.

269
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:04,480
Shi Yi.

270
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,140
He's made his stance.

271
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,820
Regardless of his family's attitude,

272
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,020
he wants to be with me.

273
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,500
I agreed.

274
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,180
It's useless for him to make a stance

275
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:40,860
After all,

276
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,620
they are his family members.

277
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,220
You must face them.

278
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,780
You can't hide from it.

279
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:47,340
He'll take care of it.

280
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,680
It seems you've made up your mind.

281
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:52,980
If I hadn't thought Chen

282
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,220
is honest and reliable,

283
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:54,950
I would have…

284
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,620
He is honest and reliable.

285
00:13:59,060 --> 00:13:59,660
I'm telling you,

286
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:01,420
love

287
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:02,640
isn't everything.

288
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:04,460
You must have legal protection.

289
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,340
I'm warning you, you two shouldn't

290
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:13,340
live together too soon.

291
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:25,500
Forget I ever said that.

292
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:26,780
Anyway, the way

293
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:27,700
you young people think

294
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,620
is completely different

295
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,020
from our generation.

296
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:31,860
Don't worry, Mom.

297
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:32,980
I will only be with him

298
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:34,240
for the rest of my life.

299
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,900
I won't be with someone else.

300
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,820
The rest of your life is a long time.

301
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:46,960
How is he treating you?

302
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:50,270
Pretty good.

303
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:53,060
You have to be more specific.

304
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:53,780
I'll have you know.

305
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:55,020
Your mother has been there before.

306
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,100
To judge

307
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:56,860
if a man is devoted to you,

308
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:58,990
you mainly have to look at the details.

309
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,460
Details...

310
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,580
He didn't like to call before.

311
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,020
After he met me,

312
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:07,940
he would talk about what he did

313
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,700
and who he met that day on the phone

314
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,660
strictly in accordance with my requirements

315
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,580
every day.

316
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:13,500
He is patient

317
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,660
with me.

318
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:16,520
As long as I ask for something,

319
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:17,670
he never refutes it.

320
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,780
He tries to learn.

321
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:21,980
And

322
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,180
since we met,

323
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,100
he has never been angry with me.

324
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:28,260
He has never been stern with me either.

325
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,140
When he's not happy,

326
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:30,500
he would stay away,

327
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:32,600
afraid that he'll affect my mood.

328
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:43,420
The sound insulation at our house

329
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:44,540
is poor.

330
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,260
They don't know this.

331
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:48,620
But I know they always

332
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,420
have their girl talk over there.

333
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:53,940
And

334
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:55,780
I can feel

335
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,580
he has never had a girlfriend.

336
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:59,020
So far in the relationship,

337
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,940
I've basically been the one to initiate stuff.

338
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,740
He's always been well-behaved.

339
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:15,180
You lose, right?

340
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:20,260
Good game.

341
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,180
We should cook.

342
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:24,880
Uncle, let me help you.

343
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:26,700
Okay, okay.

344
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:30,940
Wash the vegetables.

345
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,220
Over there, wash it.

346
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:33,020
-Okay.
-Okay.

347
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:47,660
You shouldn't be doing this.

348
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:48,620
I'll do it.

349
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,820
It's okay. I'll do it.

350

Don't you have work tonight?

353
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,460
We should go.

354

We're going, Auntie.

363
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,140
Did you see that?

364
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,700
Your daughter has always looked like

365
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:10,260
she doesn't care about anything

366
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,500
since her childhood.

367
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:12,660
But now she's

368
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:15,260
getting serious about this lad.

369
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:16,860
You can tell?

370
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:18,990
She's my daughter.

371
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,420
How can I not know her?

372
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:21,380
Did you notice?

373
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:22,310
She took his hand

374
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,790
when they were leaving.

375
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,620
She's telling us

376
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:26,820
she chose him.

377
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,230
She likes him very much.

378
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:31,200
And that we shouldn't treat him badly in the future.

379
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:32,620
She got that from you, didn't she?

380
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:33,750
You always bully me.

381
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:35,140
When have I ever bullied you?

382
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:35,740
You tell me.

383
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,200
When have I ever done that?

384
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:39,270
Go mop the floor now.

385
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,710
Okay, okay, I'll mop the floor.

386
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,060
What's wrong?

387
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:31,580
It's rare

388
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:33,140
to see you so proactive

389
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:34,540
in front of your parents.

390
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:35,580
We're at my place,

391
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,310
of course I have to protect you.

392
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:40,540
I heard you call my mother auntie.

393
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,100
Then my brain immediately

394
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:45,660
thought about what it would be like if you called her Mom in the future.

395
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,700
Then I thought about going to your home.

396
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,830
And I wondered how to face your mother.

397
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,910
What do you think I should call her?

398
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,420
Auntie or Mom?

399
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,740
What do you usually call her at home?

400
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,140
I don't

401
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,100
see her much

402
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,260
because she's not my biological mother.

403
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:03,180
Ren and I call her Mother.

404
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,740
Wenchuan and Wenxing

405
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,420
call her Mom more often.

406
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,660
I feel that you and Wenchuan

407
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,910
are not very close with each other.

408
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:16,540
It's true that we don't know each other very well.

409
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:17,860
Actually, when we were little,

410
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:18,620
we lived

411
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:19,660
separately.

412
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:22,240
I lived at my grandmother's home.

413
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,220
Wenchuan and Ren

414
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,750
were raised by their nanny.

415
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:27,040
Then maybe from this year?

416
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:28,450
Since this year,

417
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,140
Wenchuan and I,

418
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,820
we've gotten a little bit closer.

419
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:32,950
What about Wenxing?

420
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:35,450
When Wenxing was little,

421
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:36,920
she wasn't good at studying.

422
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,360
So she would often

423
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:41,230
go to grandmother's house to ask me for tutoring.

424
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:43,050
But that was all an excuse.

425
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,460
She probably

426
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:45,820
felt bored in the yard.

427
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:47,980
So she always wanted to find an excuse to go out.

428
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:48,990
Asking me for tutoring

429
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:51,320
was the best excuse she could come up with.

430
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:55,380
Sorry, sorry.

431
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,100
It's okay.

432
00:20:58,690 --> 00:20:59,950
I'm not afraid of dogs.

433
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:01,900
I'm afraid.

434
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:05,530
I'm afraid it might bite you.

435
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,860
Ever since I was little, cats and dogs would become restless

436
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:09,790
when they see me.

437
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:11,120
I've gotten used to it.

438
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:12,860
Why is that?

439
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,900
A fortune teller told my mother

440
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,980
that I shouldn't have been born.

441
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:18,900
That's why.

442
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:22,580
I'm kidding.

443
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:23,550
Let's go.

444
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,280
In the next few months,

445
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:56,310
I may have to travel back and forth.

446
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,500
My work schedule has been packed recently.

447
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,320
I can only go back with you on weekends.

448

You don't have to go back with me.

I can go back by myself.

450
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,420
Going back and forth between the two places

451
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:06,880
is very energy consuming.

452
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,900
We only need to go back to Zhenjiang

453
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,040
on big occasions.

454
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,060
The rest of the time,

455
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:14,950
I will go back and forth between the two places.

456

00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:38,460
If it's an accident, why did you get someone to investigate it?

519
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:39,310
I'm paranoid.

520
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:40,560
You know that.

521
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,690
Why are you here?

522
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,440
I saw that you didn't come for breakfast this morning.

523
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,640
So I brought it to you.

524
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:53,420
Not many people can get up

525
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:55,450
at your family's breakfast time.

526
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:56,690
Isn't there tea at 10?

527
00:28:57,290 --> 00:28:58,490
That suits me better.

528
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:02,400
I have to meet some elders with your eldest brother

529
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,260
in the morning.

530
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,970
I have a lot of things to do before that.

531
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:06,770
If you've nothing else you need,

532
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,470
I'll see you this afternoon?

533
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:10,030
Okay.

534
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:20,880
Is what happened in Bremen

535
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:22,680
an accident?

536
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:24,760
Of course it was an accident.

537
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:25,440
You saw

538
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,610
the reply from the local police.

539
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:29,320
And it was on the news the next day.

540
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,250
It was a dispute.

541
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:52,470
Uncle Chen.

542
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:55,840
You are finally willing to come back?

543
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,480
I don't even know how to answer

544
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,480
your grandma's questions anymore.

545
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:00,800
What did she ask?

546
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:01,720
She said

547
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:04,460
"How long have they been married?"

548
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:05,700
"Is it about a year?"

549
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,120
I said it hasn't been a year.

550
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,650
It's only been a few months.

551
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:10,280
Then she stopped talking.

552
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,700
Muttering to herself.

553
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:15,080
I think she wants to have a great-grandchild.

554
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:31,880
Uncle Mei.

555
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,320
Chen.

556
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:36,100
Your father's old friends

557
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:37,340
have all come back

558
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:38,800
to help you.

559
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:43,530
It's hard for a man to succeed alone.

560
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,640
You need friends to help you.

561
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:48,760
Are we, your father's old friends,

562
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,060
important or not?

563
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:51,950
Your uncles

564
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,880
know clearly about that.

565
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:57,780
Get inside.

566
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:00,620
Don't make your uncles and aunts

567
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:01,770
wait for too long.

568
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:03,400
Okay.

569
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,320
My nephew is back.

570
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,130
Chen's back.

571
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,280
Let's sit down.

572
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,680
-Good.
-Good, good

573
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:23,100
Chen.

574
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:26,520
The family business seems to have been passed on to you.

575
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:28,480
But our family is old-fashioned.

576
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,140
We value family members

577
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:31,140
and ceremony.

578
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:32,620
Your wedding

579
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:33,820
must be held.

580
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:35,220
That's right.

581
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,740
So that the relatives coming from near and far

582
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:39,140
can meet your wife.

583
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:43,020
Okay.

584
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,020
I will definitely

585
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:46,980
make the wedding happen

586
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,260
within this year.

587
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:48,620
Good!

588
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:49,100
That's good.

589
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:49,860
That's great.

590
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:50,620
We'll be waiting for

591
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:51,880
your wedding banquet.

592
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,660
Yes, we are waiting for that day.

593
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:54,180
We'll definitely come over

594
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:55,260
at that time.

595
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,220
That's right.

596
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:18,660
Miss Shi.

597
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:20,140
Are you sick?

598
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:21,220
I've got a cold.

599
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:22,540
That's why I'm wearing a mask.

600
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:23,400
It's like this.

601
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,720
My superiors told us to

602
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:25,740
guard this first door.

603
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:27,470
So we have to know the residents

604
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,940
of every household.

605
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,100
The Miss Hong at your place,

606
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:32,150
did she move out?

607
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,420
Yes, she did.

608
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:34,580
In this case,

609
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:35,980
you're the only one in your house now?

610
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,340
I saw a gentleman yesterday...

611
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:38,000
My husband.

612
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:39,600
We just got married.

613
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,330
So he moved in with me recently.

614
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:42,780
I thought...

615
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:44,540
I thought

616
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:45,740
celebrities like you

617
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:46,540
don't tell people about

618
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:47,670
your private lives.

619
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,430
I'm not really a celebrity.

620
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:51,500
You were on TV wearing a long gown

621
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:52,500
and even got an award.

622
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,380
Is that not considered a celebrity?

623
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:56,460
I'm merely working behind the scenes.

624
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:58,340
You're too modest.

625
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:02,220
[Security guard]

626
00:33:58,860 --> 00:33:59,780
I have nothing else to ask.

627
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:00,820
I'll register him.

628
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:02,340
This way we won't have to

629
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:03,580
keep an eye on him anymore

630
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:04,140
while on duty

631
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:05,140
when he's in and out.

632
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:05,740
Thank you.

633
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:06,620
Okay. Bye.

634
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:07,400
I'll go now.

635
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:07,860
Okay.

636
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:11,540
He's so lucky.

637
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:13,620
Now that they're married,

638
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:15,679
why is he living in the woman's house?

639
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:16,739
This guy seems honest.

640
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:18,199
He shouldn't be like this.

641
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:21,420
You can't judge a man by his appearance.

642
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:23,179
It's hard to say.

643
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:24,739
Li!

644
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:26,460
When I'm done watering here,

645
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:27,920
please register it for me.

646
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,139
Okay.

647
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,179
What were you

648
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:31,340
muttering about?

649
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:32,540
Nothing.

650
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:34,699
I know that girl.

651
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,429
She's pretty, has a good job

652
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:37,920
and recently got married.

653
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:39,699
But her husband lives in her apartment.

654
00:34:39,699 --> 00:34:41,360
I'm afraid she'll be cheated.

655
00:34:42,139 --> 00:34:44,070
I've seen a lot of people like that.

656
00:34:44,139 --> 00:34:45,580
Bad boys of the lower class

657
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:46,420
look bad.

658
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:48,380
But the wicked ones

659
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:49,980
are of high class.

660
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:51,820
This kind of man

661
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:53,940
seems to be honest.

662
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:55,699
Most of them pretend it.

663
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:58,940
Girls today are so independent.

664
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:00,190
They can earn money.

665
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:02,080
They have their own opinions.

666
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:02,900
Most of them

667
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:05,860
want to find a man who stays at home

668
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,500
and can live a good life.

669
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:11,820
Ladies should beware of fake honest guys.

670
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:13,340
In my opinion,

671
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:16,300
fake honest guys are worse than true playboys.

672
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,620
Playboys go after beautiful women.

673
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:19,860
But fake honest men

674
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:22,220
want your beauty and money.

675
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:23,630
They're greedy.

676
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:24,900
Let me tell you.

677
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,560
You must talk to that girl.

678
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:28,140
I'm sorry.

679
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:30,140
You must tell her

680
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:31,260
to be careful

681
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,780
and don't be fooled.

682
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:34,060
Okay.

683
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:35,340
What I said just now

684
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,960
are good pieces of advice.

685
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:38,460
If she doesn't listen to me,

686
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:39,900
Okay, take your time watering.

687
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,260
I'll go register it.

688
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,220
she'll have a hard time later on.

689
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:44,860
We've all been there.

690
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:57,820
Grandma, I'm divorced.

691
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:04,240
I want to marry Man.

692
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:08,660
I know

693
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:12,060
I'm a nobody now

694
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:14,180
in my own home.

695
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:17,360
I'm not the eldest son,

696
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:18,920
and even got divorced.

697
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:22,620
I'm sure you don't think I'm the best candidate

698
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:24,680
to be your granddaughter's husband.

699
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:27,820
But today,

700
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,500
I kneel before you

701
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:31,220
to beg you.

702
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:33,820
I hope you can say yes

703
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:37,230
to grant me and Man

704
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,060
a chance to start over.

705
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:45,180
Your grandmother and I

706
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,140
have watched the three of you

707
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:50,220
grow up.

708
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:54,140
I never thought

709
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,980
things would turn out this way.

710
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:01,340
I really don't know what to say.

711
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:09,940
I'm getting older.

712
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:12,220
I don't like it

713
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:14,950
when people get down on their knees and talk to me.

714
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:16,060
Get up.

715
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:21,920
Granny wants you to get up.

716
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:23,100
Just do it.

717
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:37,070
As her eldest brother, let me ask you this.

718
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:38,620
You are divorced now.

719
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:40,620
What is Tong Jiaren

720
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:42,260
to your family now?

721
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,900
We have signed the agreement

722
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,530
and gone through the formalities.

723
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:52,120
But for the sake of the two families,

724
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:54,390
we have to wait for a year

725
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:55,980
to give a good explanation.

726
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:57,340
The hardest person to deal with in your family

727
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:58,200
is your mother.

728
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:00,220
Don't just try to

729
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:01,540
get a yes from our family

730
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:02,860
while you keep it from your family.

731
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:05,340
We only have one girl in our family.

732
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:06,980
She's very precious.

733
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:09,270
We won't let her suffer.

734
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,500
I've already told her.

735
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:20,000
I've told her everything.

736
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:06,960
You're still not meant to be

737
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:08,700
my daughter-in-law.

738
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:15,180
When are you going back to Bremen?

739
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:18,020
I'm not going back there.

740
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,820
Isn't your job over there?

741
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:24,380
Mom.

742
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:26,060
I've already made a deal

743
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:27,700
with a university in Beijing.

744
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,630
I'm going to Beijing in the winter.

745
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:31,660
Why not Shanghai?

746
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:32,980
It's closer to home.

747
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:36,740
It suits me better there.

748
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:39,660
But I will stay in Zhenjiang during autumn

749
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:40,790
to keep you company.

750
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:07,980
How long did it take Shi Yi

751
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:10,060
to come up with the pair of phrases that day?

752
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:10,990
Within seconds.

753
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:25,110
Now that you're married,

754
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:26,740
what do you think of it?

755
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:32,200
The fact that there's someone with me

756
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:34,220
when I wake up in the middle of the night.

757
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:35,580
What kind of answer is that?

758
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:36,220
Every married person

759
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:38,020
would have someone beside them.

760
00:40:40,090 --> 00:40:42,820
It's not quite what I imagined.

761
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:03,510
What are you laughing at?

762
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:05,740
You won't get it.

763
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:24,720
It's autumn, so it's easy to catch a cold.

764
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,300
Take care of yourself.

765
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:33,110
Drink your medicine first.

766
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:33,860
Thank you.

767
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:43,340
I don't think it has anything to do with the weather.

768
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:45,020
Then what does it have to do with?

769
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:46,750
Is it related to your marriage?

770
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:48,980
Maybe it's true.

771
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:54,020
Is it because you forgot to cover up

772
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:55,820
after exercising?

773
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:01,100
What are you talking about?

774
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:04,900
No, I think

775
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:07,990
he always hogs the blanket when sleeping.

776
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:18,420
But

777
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:20,300
it feels good too.

778
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:22,020
I can wake up

779
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:23,380
in his arms every day.

780
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:26,780
Do you mean to irritate me?

781
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:28,420
Oh,

782
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:30,500
are you not worried

783
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:32,540
that he goes away for a few days every week?

784
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:34,070
What's to be worried about?

785
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:35,980
Erm...

786
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:40,320
He may have two families or something like that.

787
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:42,660
You've been writing a lot of articles about family disputes, haven't you?

788
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:43,420
It's true.

789
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:45,440
There are so many cases like this.

790
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:46,620
They say they're out for business,

791
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:48,060
but they actually have another family.

792
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:48,860
There are men like this.

793
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:50,370
There are also women that do this.

794
00:42:50,370 --> 00:42:53,250
There are also those that are already married pretending to be single.

795
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:54,100
I just got married.

796
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:55,230
Say something nice.

797
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:58,940
Of course, there are also those who

798
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:00,460
keep each other company for decades

799
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:02,320
and pass away one after the other.

800
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:03,740
And then?

801
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:05,740
And then...

802
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:08,820
There is also someone who lost his partner.

803
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:10,940
The old man traveled all over the country

804
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:11,940
with a photo,

805
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:13,300
wandering around.

806
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:14,860
He searched for years.

807
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:18,220
The news

808
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:20,500
makes me cry every time I read it.

809
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:23,740
I hope he can find her soon.

810
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:26,600
The old man is a man of great love and loyalty.

811
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:27,920
It's tough for him.

812
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:30,110
I'm sure he'll find her.

813
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:34,500
I'm going to the train station this afternoon

814
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:35,540
to pick up a colleague.

815
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:37,140
I won't be accompanying you.

816
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:42,700
Will you be okay?

817
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:44,180
Do you want to go to the hospital?

818
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:44,940
I'm fine.

819
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:46,460
Call your husband?

820
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:48,540
It takes him several hours to drive back.

821
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:49,470
It's too tiring.

822
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:50,860
I'll finish the medicine and go to sleep.

823
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:51,380
Just go.

824
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:52,260
All right.

825
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:54,950
Text me before you go to bed.

826
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:55,830
I'm leaving.

827
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:56,660
Bye, bye.
