You're on an extra tight schedule this time.

I'm an old hand at this stuff.

I'll help you check if he's sincere.

called Lin Fei?

147
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,680
Lin Fei is actually Zhou Linfei.

148
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,280
In fact, the senior housekeepers

149
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,320
in our family

150
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,560
are all surnamed Zhou.

They are more or less our distant relatives.

152
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,280
But if the whole family

153
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,840
all uses the surname Zhou,

154
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,260
it might be confusing.

155
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,000
So we're used to calling people

156
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,400
just by the characters in their given name.

157
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,480
Indeed.

158
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,650
There are a lot of people, so it helps us distinguish.

00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,880
How come you're so…

174
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,160
So unromantic?

175
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:11,610
A little.

176
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,250
I want to ask you a question.

177
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,320
Go ahead.

178
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,040
You said that the two of us

179
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,960
are one of your research areas.

180
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,610
What if this research is in the wrong area?

181
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:33,880
You're making a

182
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,120
conceptual error.

183
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,360
What conceptual error?

184
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,000
The research area itself

185
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,600
can't be right and wrong.

186
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,450
Only the method of experimentation can be wrong.

187
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,410
And what if the experimental method is wrong?

188
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,240
If the experimental method is wrong,

189
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,640
we can change the method.

190
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,800
But the research area itself

191
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,080
will not change.

192
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,500
That sounds very convincing.

193
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,900
For example, the fact that

194
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,840
we're together

195
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,260
is not going to change.

196
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,000
If something goes wrong,

197
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,560
we can

198
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,360
change the way we get along.

199
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,520
Science and technology

200
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,160
are not only the greatest productive force.

201
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,960
They're also the best language.

202
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,410
Let's go.

203
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:32,840
Come on in.

204
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,000
This is the house I bought myself.

205
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,840
Xiaoyu and I share it.

206
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,100
She lives in that room.

207
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,300
Sit down first. I'll make some medicine for you.

208
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,460
What are you doing?

209
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,280
Nothing.

210
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,160
I just think it's cute.

211
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,500
It's Xiaoyu's.

212
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,720
You should wrap up in spring and wear less in autumn.

213
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,960
Don't be in such a hurry to wear

214
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,400
your summer clothes in spring.

215
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,000
The weather has been changing a lot in the past ten days.

216
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,400
It's easy to catch a cold.

217
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,840
I just have a mild cold.

218
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,440
I don't need to drink medicine.

219
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,920
This is herbal medicine to dispel the cold.

220
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:35,720
If it's a cold,

221
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,680
you'll feel better within a day.

222
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,930
It works so well?

223
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,120
Of course it does.

224
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,480
You didn't think

225
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,840
I deliberately made an excuse

226
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,440
to get you to come up, did you?

227
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,700
In fact, just now downstairs,

228
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,520
I didn't mean to say no.

229
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,480
I just thought

230
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,880
I did the engagement thing

231
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,120
out of blue.

232
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,600
So I want to take things slowly.

233
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,360
But really I did want to come up.

234
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,520
He feels shy now.

235
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,560
You sounded calm

236
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,800
when you proposed.

237
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,440
Yet now you're shy.

238
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,160
Next time you want to come up,

239
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,000
just say so.

240
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,980
You're in a hurry to leave?

241
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,040
I have to go back to Zhenjiang

242
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,200
tonight.

243
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,440
I'll have breakfast with my family tomorrow morning.

244
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,880
You're driving back overnight?

245
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,240
Then finish this and go.

246
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,170
I don't mean to kick you out.

247
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,920
I just mean if you leave now,

248
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,720
you can at least get two hours of sleep at home.

249
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,980
Otherwise you won't get any sleep at all.

250
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:51,880
Okay.

251
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,210
No need to...

252
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,580
You didn't waste a drop, that's good.

253
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,540
Let's go. I'll see you off.

254
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,440
I came back early this time

255
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,880
because you were

256
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,440
nominated for the award.

257
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,280
You found out so quickly!

258
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,680
My agent just told me.

259
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,780
Congratulations.

260
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,280
I may not win.

261
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,360
So

262
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,780
you're back for the award presentation?

263
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,320
Kind of.

264
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,640
The rest of my time will be spent

265
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,060
preparing for the engagement ceremony.

266
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,280
I'll head back, then.

267
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,880
I'll come back on the day of the award presentation.

268
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,360
Okay.

269
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,280
Bye.

270
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,280
That room on the 12th floor is the bathroom.

271
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
It looks like the heating lamp is on.

272
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,940
She's probably in the shower.

273
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,080
I'm back.

274
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,570
I went out for something to eat.

275
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,440
Smells like Chinese medicine.

276
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,170
You had some Chinese medicine?

277
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,160
Haven't you always hated

278
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,080
this smell?

279
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,160
I didn't want to disappoint her.

280
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,160
It's just a cup of Chinese medicine.

281
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:45,400
It's just a cup of Chinese medicine.

282
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,240
Chen.

283
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,520
Actually I really wanted to ask

284
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,480
the two of you…

285
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,920
You want to ask me

286
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,800
how we met?

287
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,890
Then tell me, in your own words.

288
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,800
At Guangzhou Baiyun Airport,

289
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,800
she caught up with me

290
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,410
and asked for my contact information.

291
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,680
A person who likes you

292
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,240
must be as weird as you.

293
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,960
I think I'm quite lucky.

294
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,840
I never thought

295
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,120
I would be liked by

296
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,320
a girl like her.

297
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,720
25 minutes.

298
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,280
So it takes her 25 minutes

299
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,520
to take a shower.

300
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,200
Uncle.

301
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,060
I've brought Chen's clothes.

302
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,480
He came back sick.

303
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,160
He was so tired that he fell asleep.

304
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,440
Let him sleep a little longer.

305
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,700
He'll change it later.

306
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,280
Why do you treat him

307
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,680
as if he were your own son?

308
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,440
In my heart,

309
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:32,920
he is my son.

310
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,800
Chen is back.

311
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,000
Really?

312
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:41,880
When?

313
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:42,940
Last night.

314
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,960
He went to Shanghai to see his fiancee first

315
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,120
and came back overnight.

316
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:46,760
He didn't even sleep.

317
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,240
Just dozed in the car for a while.

318
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,960
They are so close.

319
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:13,690
Chen, a small farewell is better than a new marriage, right?

320
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,640
Just write something

321
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,880
so you don't have to say too much to them.

322
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:48,730
What's this?

323
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,340
What you have to study in college.

324
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:54,880
Chen.

325
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,400
How did you sleep last night?

326
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,200
I was in Shanghai all last night.

327
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,130
I didn't have time to sleep yet.

328
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,040
I see.

329
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,370
Your mother and I

330
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,520
had a discussion.

331
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,320
We decided

332
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,610
to let your fiancee come to Zhenjiang.

333
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,000
In this way,

334
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,640
she can learn about the business

335
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,760
from your mother.

336
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,850
She doesn't need to.

337
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,840
Since you're getting married,

338
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,720
she needs to.

339
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,720
She's not a good fit for it.

340
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,760
Neither are you.

341
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,650
But you have to take it over.

342
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,400
Since you don't think it's a good fit,

343
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,300
it's not too late to rethink the whole thing.

344

Why are you eating my food again?

00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:57,570
This is mine.

348

You just ate my food.

Don't think I have to give in to you

About what?

359
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,720
It's about your bed.

Do you want to get a new one?

She has to stay here, right?

366
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,160
It's a new bride entering the family home.

367
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,160
You at least have to

368
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,760
change the bed first, right?

369
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:07,920
No need to.

370
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,160
I think it's fine.

371
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,280
Are you sure?

372
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,530
It's sturdy enough?

373
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,080
I don't see there being a problem.

374
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,040
I've been sleeping on it for so many years.

375
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,570
What could be wrong with it?

376
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,360
I'm going.

377
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,280
So,

378
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,410
you don't want to change it, right?

379
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,560
Otherwise, we'll change it.

380
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,800
Prepare to change the bed.

381
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,130
Change it to the biggest one, understand?

382
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,730
What are you talking about?

383
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,740
Why do you care about this?

384

Also, clean up

385
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,600
the guest room on the second floor too.

386
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,600
I'll sleep there.

387
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,080
Sleeping in separate rooms?

388
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,300
It's the first day.

The Junior Prince of Nanchen had no wife or children in his life.

But frequent rumors had it he had secret affairs

After the death of the Junior Prince of Nanchen,

the crown princess soon passed away also.

Why do you need to borrow a dress?

Why don't you just buy it?

I'll just wear it once.

430

Since I was a child, I have been unhappy

when my mother dressed me in red.

465
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,120

00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,160
Thank you.

517
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,240
You're welcome.

518
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,100
I'll leave now.

519
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,480
Grandma is relaxing in the sun inside.

520
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,200
Tell her

521
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,040
I had to leave.

522
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:58,840
Grandma.

523
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,600
Chen?

524
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,960
Chuan and Man just left.

525
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:07,600
I ran into them

526
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,600
outside just now.

527
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,160
These two kids.

528
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,720
I think they're in a good relationship.

529
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,200
Why aren't they married yet?

530
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,040
You're the older brother.

531
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:23,240
You have to think for your brothers.

532
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:23,840
Okay, okay, okay.

533
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:24,200
Well.

534
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,240
Uncle Lin.

535
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,800
You stay with Grandma for a while.

536
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,400
I'll go to the room to check it out.

537
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,880
Okay, okay, go ahead.

538
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:31,740
Come on.

539
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,480
Lin, sit down.

540
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,020
Okay, okay, I'll sit down.

541
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,480
How have you been these days?

542
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,240
I'm fine.

543
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,480
Have some grapes.

544
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:38,940
Grapes.

545
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,840
Have one.

546
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,560
I don't…

547
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,840
I'm getting old.

548
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,640
My teeth can't

549
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:44,640
take them.

550
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:45,680
It's so sour.

551
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,600
Have one.

552
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,600
It's sweet.

553
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:50,690
Okay.

554
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:51,280
Have one.

555
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,080
Eat up, eat up.

556
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,360
It's fine, it's fine.

557
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,280
Eat up.

558
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,480
Chen, you're here.

559
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,200
You should take a break here.

560
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,260
Don't get too busy.

561
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,000
Was this table

562
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,120
broken before?

563
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,000
A child that came last week

564
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,160
made a fuss and broke it.

565
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,640
I didn't have time to fix it.

566
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,770
It's already fixed.

567
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,000
I just thought

568
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,290
there's something I haven't done yet.

569
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,480
I'm used to being in the lab.

570
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,440
I always focus on details.

571
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,440
Don't mind me, Auntie.

572
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,240
Not at all.

573
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,360
Of course not.

574
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,320
You are filial and attentive.

575
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,600
I can tell.

576
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,240
I'll do it.

577
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,160
You go and rest.

578
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,240
I'll go check on Grandma.

579
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,640
Grandma?

580
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,020
You're sleepy?

581
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,640
I'm not sleepy, I'm not sleepy.

582
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:11,760
Chen

583
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,640
I have a lot

584
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,440
to talk to you about.

585
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:16,720
Grandma.

586
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,040
I'm not leaving tonight.

587
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,170
You're not leaving?

588
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,400
Okay.

589
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,320
Go to Grandma's room.

590
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,900
Grandma will give you something nice to eat.

591
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:26,770
Let's go.

592
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,460
Something nice to eat.

593
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,480
Come on, come on.

594
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,200
Sit there. Sit there.

595
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,840
Grandma will get you something tasty.

596
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:52,960
Here it is.

597
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:53,850
Look at this.

598
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,200
I found it! I found it!

599
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:58,850
Look at this.

600
00:30:59,000 --> 00:30:59,730
Look at this.

601
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:00,480
Isn't this

602
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,280
your favorite food when you were a kid?

603
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,720
Yes, it was my favorite.

604
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:05,760
Open it up and eat.

605
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,400
I mean,

606
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,220
when will your wife

607
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,000
come and visit me?

608
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:21,760
Grandma.

609
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,040
I didn't even tell you.

610
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,600
How did you know?

611
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,860
You're not happy to tell Grandma?

612
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:30,970
That's not true.

613
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,730
Actually, I came here today

614
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,440
to tell you about it.

615
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,200
But I haven't had the chance.

616
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:39,840
Okay.

617
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:40,460
Then...

618
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,600
How long have you been in a relationship?

619
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,960
We were engaged first and then fell in love.

620
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,120
What?

621
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,240
Is that the popular way among

622
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,680
young people now?

623
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,560
No, Grandma.

624
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,880
We're not like other people.

625
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,440
The doorbell rang. Can't you hear it?

626
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:23,980
I'm coming.

627
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,280
Hello.

628
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,320
It's you.

629
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,650
What can I do for you?

630
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,480
Uncle Lin

631
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,320
has ordered six engagement suits in our store.

632
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,480
The address is here.

633
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,280
Two sets are ready first.

634
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,280
They asked us to deliver them today.

635
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,720
I'm sorry you had to send them here.

636
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,480
I'm so sorry.

637
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,540
Please come in.

638
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,620
You don't feel at ease?

639
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:20,890
Yes, I'm at ease.

640
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,760
You've been having this habit since you were a kid.

641
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,160
Once you've got something on your mind,

642
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,620
you start rubbing things.

643
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,770
I'm afraid she wouldn't like them.

644
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,080
But now it's too late

645
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,080
to make a new one.

646
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,120
I really regret it now.

647
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:52,050
I should have taken her to buy them.

648
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,800
But in front of me,

649
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,680
she would only pick the cheap ones,

650
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,610
instead of picking the right ones.

651
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:01,840
Uncle Lin.

652
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,400
Am I thinking too much?

653
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,240
Yes, indeed.

654
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,860
Looking this way and that.

655
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,120
Hello?

656
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,679
Although you didn't ask me,

657
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:29,760
I want to say

658
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:30,960
I like them all.

659
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:36,080
I have the tickets for tomorrow.

660
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:36,800
I left two for

661
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,800
you and Uncle Lin.

662
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,280
Where should I send them?

663
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,440
Uncle Lin doesn't like crowds and all that excitement.

664
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,400
One is enough.

665
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:46,340
I'll ask someone to pick it up.

666
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:47,850
Bye-bye.

667
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:51,120
These two

668
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,920
are both your favorite colors.

669
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,440
You told him?

670
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:15,680
Uncle Lin.

671
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,490
Come with me to the lake.

672
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,360
Now?

673
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,500
Yes, yes. Hurry up.

674
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:22,800
What on earth?

675
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,440
I haven't driven in years

676
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:07,800
Uncle Lin.

677
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,120
You have to help me ease back into this.

678
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,580
It's not your style to just

679
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,260
pick it up again on the fly.

680
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,200
But there are times in life

681
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,130
when you need to make some changes.

682
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,680
You still remember the rules of the road, right?

683
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,000
How can I not remember?

684
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,450
I remember everything.

685
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,040
Since you do…

686
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:30,730
let's go.

687
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,130
I'm really leaving.

688
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:35,960
Okay.

689
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,280

00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:33,480
animated movies together.

863
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:34,160
This is it.

864
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:35,480
Yes, that's right.

865
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:36,810
Although I'm a newcomer

866
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,040
in the world of voice acting,

867
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:39,520
I learned a lot from Miss Shi Yi.

868
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:40,120
I've learned a lot.

869
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:41,520
This place is pretty far away.

870
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:42,720
You can't be caught on camera

871
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,520
and you can see Shi Yi clearly too.

872
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:45,200
Thank you.

873
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,360
You watch, I'll do my thing.

874
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:47,800
Good.

Thank you all.

I'm very happy, truly delighted.

It's a great honor.

906
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:00,080
Why are you sitting here?

907
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:01,640
I told them

908
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:03,160
I wanted to surprise you.

909
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:04,620
To just let me sit in a place

910
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,280
where I can see you clearly.

911
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:07,920
Do you know

912
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:09,370
what seat you're sat in?

913
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:09,840
The first row

914
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:11,440
is for the organizers' VIPs.

915
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:15,960
I more or less guessed that.

916
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:16,620
Shall we go?

917
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:19,400
You don't have to wait until the end?

918
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:19,960
No, I don't.

919
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:21,360
The award has already been given out.

920
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:22,820
It'll cause trouble later

921
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:23,680
if the staff find out

922
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:25,320
we're in other people's seats.

923
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:25,720
Let's go.

924
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:27,480
Your love and dedication

925
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:29,000
has completed this work.
