[Episode 9]

4
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,300
Do you have any books you like?

5
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,560
I quite like the books here.

6
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:56,100
Wenxing said that you went to settle something.

7
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,320
It's settled.

8
00:01:58,479 --> 00:01:59,680
As for the rest,

9
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,930
I don't think they'll need me anymore.

10
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:07,640
Let's go.

11
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,240
I want to take you somewhere.

12
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,520
Where?

13
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:11,730
Let's go.

14
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,040
You can have a full view of

15
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,640
the old manor from here.

16
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,060
You can even watch the sunset now.

17
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,400
What's up?

18
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,850
I have a fear of heights.

19
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,240
But it's not serious.

20
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,480
Sometimes, I'm fine.

21
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,640
But I think it's pretty bad today.

22
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,240
Come.

Chen.

51
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,400
Sorry for

52
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,720
disturbing you.

53
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,399
What's up?

54
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,740
J-Just an allergic reaction to dust.

55
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,880
Let's go then.

56
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,170
Let's go.

57
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,320
Chen.

58
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,000
Why didn't I realize before that

59
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
you are so good at acting pitiful?

60
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,360
Are you okay?

61
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,360
I'm fine now.

62
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,010
Don't worry.

63
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,580
I told you just now, right?

64
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,320
His allergy is not severe.

65
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,520
Although he is fine now,

66
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,440
you have to pay attention to him.

67
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,040
Usually, after his allergic reaction,

68
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,160
he feels weak at night.

69
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,960
Make sure

70
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,080
to stay by his side

71
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,400
and take care of him.

72
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,720
I forgot to tell you about the important matter.

73
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,200
Uncle Lin said that the car

74
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,000
is ready.

75
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,580
You can depart at any time.

76
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,060
Where are we going?

77
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,840
We are going to meet my elder.

78
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,000
Again?

79
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,690
How many elders do you have?

80
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,890
This is the most important one.

81
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,520
Are you afraid?

82
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,720
No.

83
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,480
I'm just a little bit nervous since I don't have the experience.

84
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,280
Don't be nervous.

85
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,120
Have you been to Chen's house?

86
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,000
Yes.

87
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,400
But it's different from here.

88
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,400
And they are different from you.

89
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,010
Where are you going?

90
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,200
Let's go into the house.

91
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:16,760
Okay.

92
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,520
Let's go in.

93
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,180
Let me help.

94
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,020
Be careful.

95
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:36,909
Be careful of the step.

96
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:39,500
Over there.

97
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,920
Let's sit over there.

98
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:47,280
Chen didn't tell me that you'd be coming.

99
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:50,120
So, I didn't prepare anything for you.

100
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,430
Have some sweets.

101
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:52,780
[Chocolate]

102
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,600
Have some sweets.

103
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,320
-Eat this.
-Thank you, Grandmother.

104
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,760
No need to thank me.

105
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,320
Go ahead and eat it.

106
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,720
I just eat it like this?

107
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,120
Yes.

108
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,040
What's wrong?

109
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,730
Is it not good?

110
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,160
No.

111
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,280
It's good.

112
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:33,380
Eat more then.

113
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,080
Eat more.

114
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,040
Your grandmother gave me this.

115
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,840
You liked it when you were young?

116
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:57,760
Yes.

117
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,920
You don't like it?

118
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,200
The flavor is very surprising.

119
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,000
But from today onwards,

120
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,560
I'll try to like it.

121
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,980
What are you doing?

122
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,560
This is

123
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,800
her favourite radio.

124
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,330
She listens to it every day.

125
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,440
Just now, I found that

126
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,700
its volume got softer.

127
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,000
So, I want to

128
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,000
fix it for her.

129
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,000
So, besides studying about Venus,

130
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,580
you know how to do this too.

131
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,960
You've been working ever since you came in.

132
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,320
Every time, after raining,

133
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,320
the moss on the floor will become very slippery.

134
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,480
She's old now.

135
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,930
I don't want her to fall.

136
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,680
You do this all by yourself?

137
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:09,840
I like to

138
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,360
do everything myself.

139
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,720
No matter

140
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,040
how many people you hire,

141
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,960
there's always something that they fail to take care of.

142
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,800
It feels better

143
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,320
to do it yourself.

144
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,200
Indeed.

145
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,480
My mother and uncles

146
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,120
hired a care provider for my grandmother before.

147
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,400
But later they found out that

148
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,320
the care provider didn't like to talk to her

149
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,560
and didn't give her enough time

150
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,360
under the sun.

151
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,880
After some discussions,

152
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,160
they decided to take turns

153
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,890
to take care of her themselves.

154
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,200
Some things may seem trivial,

155
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,760
but those are the things that

156
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,690
only family will pay attention to.

157
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,840
Are you thirsty?

158
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,400
Let me get you some water.

159
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,520
It's okay.

160
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,560
Shi Yi.

161
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,840
Come.

162
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,440
Come.

163
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,250
What is it, grandmother?

164
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:04,520
Come.

165
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,520
Give me your hand.

166
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,920
Good.

167
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:11,160
I kept this

168
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,960
for Chen's wife.

169
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:14,690
Thank you, grandmother.

170
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,640
Well.

171
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:18,430
You...

172
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:20,570
You should go out and chat with him.

173
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,440
Go on.

174
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,090
I want to take a rest.

175
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,000
I need a nap.

176
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,860
Let me hold you.

177
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:33,040
I just have a daughter.

178
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:37,520
I've disappointed

179
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,320
the Zhousheng family in this life of mine.

180
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:44,170
The eldest young master

181
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:48,100
shouldn't have married her.

182
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:52,780
If he knew about the second young master's story,

183
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,360
he wouldn't have married her.

184
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,760
Your grandmother has fallen asleep.

185
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:45,760
Just like my grandfather and grandmother.

186
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,490
No one can stop them from taking an afternoon nap.

187
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,240
Is there anything

188
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,760
special about this?

189
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,840
It has the circumference of 28cm.

190
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,600
It has 18 jadeite beads,

191
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,120
pink tourmaline flower carving,

192
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,240
coral beads and pearls.

193
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,490
It's a bracelet from the late Ming and early Qing.

194
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,960
Looks like I need to buy a safe

195
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,200
to keep them.

196
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,080
This is a rosary.

197
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,480
It has been used for chanting and praying

198
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,520
for generations.

199
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:20,760
Wear it.

200
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,960
I know.

201
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,720
This is the smallest one.

202
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,480
There are the 27-bead,

203
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,520
the 54-bead

204
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,600
and the 108-bead rosaries.

205
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,530
They are all rosaries for prayers.

206
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:33,560
This

207
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,980
belonged to my mother.

208
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,120
It belonged to your mother?

209
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,480
My birth mother.

210
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,000
The one you saw

211
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,380
is not my birth mother.

212
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,940
She is Wenxing and Wenchuan's birth mother.

213
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,520
They are your half-siblings?

214
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,490
Your grandmother is your birth mother's mother?

215
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,360
She is Wenxing and Wenchuan's

216
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,690
birth mother's mother.

217
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,120
Are you confused?

218
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,760
Because you are

219
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,080
quite close with your grandmother.

220
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,810
I never thought that you are not related by blood.

221
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,280
My birth mother and my grandmother

222
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,610
are distant relatives.

223
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,640
She was brought up here since young.

224
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,840
But my grandmother treated my birth mother

225
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,440
like her own daughter.

226
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,800
So, your mother

227
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,320
married your father first.

228
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,400
After she passed away,

229
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,400
Wenxing's mother

230
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,680
married your father.

231
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,120
In order to

232
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,600
marry my mother,

233
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,490
my father left the Zhou family.

234
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,440
After my mother passed away,

235
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,930
in order to let me

236
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,050
take after the Zhousheng surname,

237
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:51,410
he gave in and married Wenxing's mother

238
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:52,760
to appease the family.

239
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,340
He brought me back to the Zhou residence.

240
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,080
Before I went back to the Zhou residence,

241
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,200
I lived here.

242
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,600
So, he has lost all of his closest ones

243
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:12,800
in this family.

244
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,760
Uncle Lin.

245
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,060
You are eating stinky tofu again.

246
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,240
Give me the car key.

247
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,520
You want to go out?

248
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,640
I'm worried about your driving skills.

249
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,680
What about me?

250
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,740
I have my driving license with me.

251
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,720
Any other drivers

252
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,690
will be more reliable than him.

253
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,000
You can't be sure about that.

254
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,640
No one is perfect.

255
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,920
You are used to being at the top since young.

256
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,120
It's time for you to learn

257
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,850
how to accept your weaknesses.

258
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,520
Last time, in order to pick you up,

259
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,400
he drove around the lake

260
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,800
for an entire afternoon.

261
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:56,440
Well,

262
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,240
I don't need to drive

263
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,440
to work.

264
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,800
I can just walk.

265
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,560
So...

266
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,210
He has me when he comes home.

267
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:03,840
So, he doesn't even have

268
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,040
the chance to touch the steering wheel.

269
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:09,350
Let's go, Professor Zhousheng.

270
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,800
I'll let you experience my driving skills.

271
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:15,800
Go.

272
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,280
Drive carefully.

273
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:28,100
[Gather Fortune]

274
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,720
There's a mountain road nearby.

275
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:31,950
It's quite steep.

276
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,880
The year when I graduated from the university,

277
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,760
I once drove down from that road.

278
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,340
It felt dangerous

279
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:38,820
even driving at only 20 miles per hour.

280
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:39,700
Where is it?

281
00:15:58,380 --> 00:15:59,580
If you like car rides,

282
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,100
I'll take you out for a ride next time.

283
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,540
I know a few mountain roads.

284
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:03,800
They have great views.

285
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:17,380
Mister.

286
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:18,780
Your fruits are quite fresh.

287
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:19,340
Of course.

288
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:19,940
I plucked them

289
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:20,780
from my fruit farm this morning.

290
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:21,840
And they are cheap.

291
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,140
Are the oranges sweet?

292
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:24,140
Yes. Try one.

293
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:27,780
Thank you.

294
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,260
I'll take some oranges

295
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,220
and some pears.

296
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:35,660
Okay.

297
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:45,340
Mister.

298
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:47,600
Hello, Sir.

299
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:48,800
I'll take them all.

300
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:51,380
I'm sorry.

301
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,460
I was here first.

302
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:53,460
Yes.

303
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,670
I'm buying them for you.

304
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:58,500
It's okay.

305
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,520
My boyfriend will buy them for me.

306
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:06,960
You don't have a good taste in men.

307
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:21,180
What is it? What's wrong?

308
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:22,700
Nothing.

309
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:24,540
Nothing.

310
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:36,150
Have a taste.

311
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,500
Beautiful girls

312
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:45,380
always attract attention.

313
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,540
Chen's mother

314
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,140
was very beautiful.

315
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,060
When she was still in school,

316
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:55,980
she was the campus belle.

317
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,300
No, grandmother.

318
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:58,740
I'm not talking about me.

319
00:17:58,740 --> 00:17:59,740
He said something bad

320
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:00,940
to Zhousheng Chen.

321
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,160
I don't like it when others criticize him.

322
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,320
Not even a word.

323
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,250
Because of that?

324
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:10,860
Newly-weds

325
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:11,660
are so loving.

326
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:12,740
You don't get bored of

327
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:14,020
looking at your wife.

328
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,350
Let me take this to them.

329
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:22,230
Grandmother.

330
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:23,970
Have some fruits.

331
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,430
You are so good.

332
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,110
You still think about us.

333
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:29,380
Mother.

334
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:30,890
Mrs. Zhou.

335
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:34,440
What are you chatting about? You look happy.

336
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,320
We are

337
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,260
very happy every day.

338
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:39,850
Why are you here?

339
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:41,410
I'm here to visit you.

340
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,640
I only have one daughter,

341
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,900
Qin Wenjin.

342
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:54,340
Tonight,

343
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:55,890
I'm going to eat dinner

344
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:58,460
with my eldest grandson and his wife.

345
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,860
I don't have time for you, Madam Zhou.

346
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,670
Then, I won't disturb you further.

347
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,510
This is for you.

348
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:11,700

I went home.

And Chen was there,

359
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:39,920
she was even more unwilling to talk to me.

Don't mind her.

When I was young,

364
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:54,950
I was so adamant about right and wrong.

365
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,740
I thought that

367
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,850
I was forced to become Chen's stepmother.

368
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:04,120
Because of this, I had a fall-out with my mother.

But she can only stay in her room, battling with her illness.

No.

Of course.

Come closer.

400

Is it awkward for me to ask

401
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:45,080
such a specific question?

402
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:47,820
I think so.

00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:55,040
♫Corners of mouth and eyes♫

518
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:55,780
Yes?

519
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:59,980
♫Give you my intense♫

520
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:03,340

00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,580
You are lying.

♫Give me your untouched♫

523

♫Innocence and freedom♫

525
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:12,960

530
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:41,750
Chen.

531
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:42,880
You are up so early.

532
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:43,960
Where are you going?

533
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,020
I'm going for a run.

534
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,389
Why is he doing that in the morning?

535
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,159
He's not familiar with this place.

536
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:50,940
Go with him.

537
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:52,860
Uncle, you know me.

538
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:53,739
I don't run.

539
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:54,460
Go.

540
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:07,420
Let's take a break.

541
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:08,820
Let's take a break, Chen.

542
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:11,540
What's wrong?

543
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:12,500
They have been

544
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:13,460
talking

545
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:14,300
about you

546
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:15,380
since I was young.

547
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,480
Finally, I get to meet you today.

548
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:19,530
Whenever I came back before,

549
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:20,930
you were always not here.

550
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:21,900
Yes.

551
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,630
I was still in school back then.

552
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:27,140
Chen.

553
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,010
Are you a natural bookworm

554
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:30,860
or are you a self-made bookworm?

555
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,330
I think I'm born like that.

556
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:35,420
I knew it.

557
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:36,580
It must be an inborn talent

558
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:38,380
to be such a serious case of bookworm.

559
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:39,260
I told my uncle about it.

560
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:40,620
But he wouldn't believe me.

561
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:41,300
He always sets you

562
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:42,180
as my example.

563
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:45,900
Okay. Let's continue.

564
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:01,020
Uncle Lin.

565
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:02,060
You are back.

566
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:11,340
You are so sweaty.

567
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:13,400
Why aren't you heading to the shower?

568
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:25,830
I have to take a rest.

569
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:26,620
You should

570
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:28,100
learn from Chen.

571
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:29,260
You

572
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:30,500
lack training.

573
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:34,840
Is there water?

574
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:03,340
Good morning.

575
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:04,940
Good morning.

576
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:06,110
You just woke up?

577
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:07,740
Yes.

578
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:11,700
Do you want to join me for a morning run?

579
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:14,820
Sure.

580
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:17,020
Let me get changed first.

581
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:40,120
Good morning, Lin Fei.

582
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:40,940
Good morning.

583
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:42,070
Where are you going?

584
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,160
We are going for a morning run.

585
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:45,340
Lin Fei.

586
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:46,860
Eat properly.

587
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:47,900
What is it?

588
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,700
Do you want to go for a run too?

589
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:53,550
No. Go ahead without me.

590
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:55,580
Okay. We'll go for a run then.

591
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:57,390
Let's go.

592
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:57,700
Bye.

593
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:58,340
Bye.

594
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:01,900
He's not spending time with his girlfriend.

595
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:03,560
He's risking his life for her.

596
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:06,340
No.

597
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:06,900
I can't

598
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:08,510
stay here anymore tonight.

599
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:09,860
This is too scary.

600
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:00,500
Let's take a rest.

601
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:01,910
Okay.

602
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:09,070
Wait for a while.

603
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:22,990
Sit on top of this.

604
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:46,860
I didn't sleep well last night.

605
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:51,140
Why?

606
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:57,220
Because of me?

607
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:00,260
No.

608
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,430
That's not true.

609
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:07,020
Did you have a good sleep last night?

610
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,110
I had quite a good sleep.

611
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:12,100
I slept all the way until morning.

612
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:26,410
Yeah, all the way until morning.

613
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:49,940
Great-grandpa, thank you

614
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:51,000
for coming with me.

615
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,460
This is such a coincidence.

616
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:53,300
If it wasn't because of this engagement banquet,

617
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:54,660
he might not be at home.

618
00:40:55,230 --> 00:40:56,500
Behave yourself when you see him.

619
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:57,100
Of course.

620
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:00,290
Great-grandpa, be careful.

621
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:00,940
Be careful.

622
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:01,300
Okay.

623
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:06,020
When you change the sand,

624
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:08,350
put one or two tablespoons of salt into it.

625
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:12,140
Will it be depressing for them

626
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:13,270
to stay inside here?

627
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:16,540
We can't do it here.

628
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:18,430
But when we go back to Shanghai,

629
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:19,540
I plan to move them

630
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:20,940
into a bigger aquarium

631
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:23,540
and add some containers that they can climb on.

632
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:26,500
He's here.

633
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:31,780
He's your great-uncle.

634
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:34,340
Chen.

635
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:35,860
To be exact,

636
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:38,020
he's my distant relative.

637
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:40,660
Based on the seniority,

638
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:42,620
he has to call me great-grandpa.

639
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:43,630
We heard that

640
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:44,900
you are back from abroad.

641
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:46,500
So, he came here to greet you.

642
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:48,940
Greet him.

643
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:51,500
Who?

644
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:57,110
Greet him. He's your great-uncle.

645
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:00,420
Greet him now.

646
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:04,540
Uncle, take a seat first.

647
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:09,980
Why are you suddenly acting so shy?

648
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:11,420
Greet him.

649
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:16,980
Great-uncle.

650
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:22,300
She is my fiancee.

651
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:31,300
Great-aunt.

652
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:36,580
Go and

653
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:38,180
tell your great-uncle about

654
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:39,980
what you did after you came back.

655
00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:47,940
I came back from abroad after I graduated two years ago.

656
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,400
Now, I have my own company.

657
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:54,900
My throat has been a little bit itchy lately.

658
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:56,560
I have allergies from pollen.

659
00:42:57,580 --> 00:42:58,720
You take your time chatting.

660
00:42:58,720 --> 00:42:59,980
I'll go to the library.

661
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:09,340
Come.

662
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:12,260
Tell me more about your company.

663
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:17,020
It's just a small company. It's not worth the mention.

664
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:19,910
Chen, Mrs. Zhou is looking for you.

665
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:21,100
What is it?

666
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:24,840
The Tong family and the Tang family are all here.

667
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:39,780
The Tong and the Tang family

668
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:41,060
are in a fierce battle.

669
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:42,890
How pitiful

670
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,380
of their unconscious daughter.
