[Episode 21]

4
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,060
Has Shi Yi woken up?

5
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,020
I've told the kitchen to make something nutritious.

6
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,680
We'll send it to her tomorrow.

7
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,080
She just woke up today,

8
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:03,820
so it's better for her to have something light.

9
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,620
I want to talk

10
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,139
alone with Wenchuan.

11
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,020
Since you brothers have things to discuss,

12
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,700
we'll take our leave then.

13
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:17,940
I'll walk you out.

14
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:32,740
Chen.

15
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:34,579
What's wrong?

16
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:35,820
As soon as I got back,

17
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:38,420
I heard that something happened to Miss Shi Yi.

18
00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:42,660
Does this have

19
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,190
anything to do with you?

20
00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:48,840
Chen, what do you mean?

21
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,440
Are you saying I'm a part of it?

22
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,600
That lake is not deeper than two meters.

23
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:58,380
Even if a kid falls in,

24
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:00,580
there will be plenty of time to save him.

25
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,360
Besides,

26
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,680
isn't Shi Yi fine now?

27
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
People should be cautious

28
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,250
near water.

29
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,780
It's getting colder with every rainfall in the autumn.

30
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,760
After this rain,

31
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,940
it'll be autumn.

32
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:21,190
Right.

33
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,640
It'll be autumn.

34
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:24,560
Qin Wan,

35
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,829
in all these years,

36
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,160
you've been taking care of the family business

37
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,280
on your own.

38
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,700
It's not been an easy journey.

39
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,150
Now that the kids are all grown up,

40
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:37,270
it's time for you to rest and enjoy yourself.

41
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,680
The kids are older,

42
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,740
but there are also more problems.

43
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,150
So busy that I

44
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,950
don't even have time for you all.

45
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,480
We are family.

46
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:47,870
Don't say that.

47
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:49,640
No need to accompany us anymore.

48
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,710
We should go.

49
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:55,960
Bye.

50
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:57,200
See you.

51
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,260
Here, have some water.

52
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,640
Thanks.

53
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,980
I think it was

54
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,240
an accident this time.

55
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,140
The boatman is one of Uncle Lin's men.

56
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,560
In other words,

57
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:56,620
all the workers in the mansion

58
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:57,680
have been replaced

59
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,270
by Uncle Lin and Uncle Chen.

60
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:01,430
So there shouldn't be any problems.

61
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,720
I've thought about it.

62
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,380
Let's take this as a warning to him

63
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,380
for what happened to you that night.

64
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:10,860
If that's the case, then what I did was not

65
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:11,920
crossing the line.

66
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:18,970
Shi Yi is up, right?

67
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:22,500
She is.

68
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:25,780
By the way,

69
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,020
why is Wenxing in your place?

70
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,980
She had a fever last night

71
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:33,060
and no one could do anything about her.

72
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:33,860
It didn't seem proper for me

73
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,220
to go into your mother's yard.

74
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:35,659
So I asked them

75
00:05:35,659 --> 00:05:36,900
to send her to me.

76
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:38,980
I know how to

77
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:39,780
deal with her.

78
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:41,060
After all,

79
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:42,880
she grew up under my watch.

80
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,380
Compared to Zhou Wenchuan and me,

81
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,040
you are more like her brother.

82
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,240
Wenxing, what are you doing out here?

83
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,100
Here.

84
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:06,940
Chen,

85
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,300
I want to see Shi Yi.

86
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:12,340
You can go tomorrow.

87
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,740
You just had a fever.

88
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,060
I'm sorry.

89
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,120
If I'd known sooner...

90
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:23,620
I'm sorry.

91
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:28,940
No one would have wanted this to happen.

92
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,200
You don't understand.

93
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,880
I want to apologize in person.

94
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,540
Right now.

95
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,260
Let her go.

96
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:46,780
Otherwise,

97
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,740
she'll have trouble sleeping

98
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,400
and it'd cause more problems.

99
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:57,540
Fine.

100
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,620
Wenxing wants to check on you.

101
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:14,840
She is downstairs.

102
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,520
Tell her to come up now.

103
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:24,440
Let's measure your body temperature first.

104
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,420
You're still having a slight fever.

105
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:33,880
Are you having a headache?

106
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:34,700
A little.

107
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:36,820
Anything else?

108
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,520
A slight stomachache.

109
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,860
Your brain was deprived of oxygen for a while.

110
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,420
So these symptoms are normal

111
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:44,570
for someone that suffocated in water.

112
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:46,700
You'll feel better in a couple of days.

113
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,200
Get some rest.

114
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:06,780
Shi Yi.

115
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,700
I'm sorry.

116
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:13,790
I should've been more cautious.

117
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:15,660
I made you jump in to save me.

118
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,900
It was my fault.

119
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:20,380
I didn't know you couldn't swim.

120
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,300
When they were saving you,

121
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,740
Chen's face turned pale.

122
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,070
He didn't say anything else

123
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,380
but your name

124
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:29,800
when he was beside you.

125
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:31,740
I was really scared.

126
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:33,340
Terrified.

127
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,059
If anything happened to you,

128
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,700
Chen would hate me to death.

129
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:40,390
He would not.

130
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:41,659
He loves you.

131
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:48,740
All right.

132
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,340
It's fine now, Wenxing.

133
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,140
I'm fine, aren't I?

134
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:53,670
Stop crying, honey.

135
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:55,980
Both of you

136
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:57,460
need to rest.

137
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:58,390
Stop crying.

138
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,400
It's not good for your health.

139
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,180
Poor thing.

140
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,700
She can't stop crying.

141
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:11,460
And Chen can't say the right thing to stop her.

142
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,820
The only person that can make her stop

143
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:13,860
is Meixing.

144
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,420
Wenxing doesn't feel strong now.

145
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:37,960
I'll send her back.

146
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:39,940
Go and take care of Shi Yi.

147
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:42,700
Fine.

148
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:44,120
Come on.

149
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:47,310
Let's go.

150
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:56,380
Chen.

151
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:00,180
Your grandma didn't

152
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,340
get up today.

153
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,260
We thought she was reluctant to get up

154
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,580
because of rheumatism.

155
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,710
But then she started to talk nonsense.

156
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,660
What's the current situation?

157
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,100
We already talked to the doctor.

158
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,100
The doctor said

159
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:13,740
that she is just old

160
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,660
so she becomes easily confused.

161
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:18,580
If anything happens here

162
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:19,540
with Shi Yi,

163
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:20,580
call me.

164
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,720
I'll go over now to see her myself.

165
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:23,300
Sure.

166
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:13,740
Chen.

167
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:48,980
You've had a long day.

168
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,300
You haven't rested

169
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,740
since yesterday.

170
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:55,740
My mom

171
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,060
lives here

172
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,580
on her own.

173
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:01,020
Thank you for keeping her company.

174
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,380
And about Wenxing,

175
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,460
I know

176
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:09,010
that you are the most worried one in the whole family.

177
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:13,220
They are not only your family members,

178
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:14,540
but also mine.

179
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,420
For me,

180
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,870
family is always worth the effort.

181
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,020
Thank you.

182
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:32,620
Mom,

183
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:35,820
Shi Yi

184
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,660
is also my family,

185
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:39,460
someone close to me.

186
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:42,580
I don't want her to feel wronged.

187
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:46,340
Shi Yi...

188
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,300
What Shi Yi wants

189
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,220
is nothing else

190
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,260
but a

191
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,500
normal relationship

192
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,660
with her family.

193
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:22,380
Granduncle.

194
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:25,260
You are back.

195
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,340
We made some porridge in the morning.

196
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,220
She didn't feel like eating

197
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,420
and only had a little.

198
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:31,940
This was just cooked.

199
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:34,870
Give it here.

200
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:36,380
You...

201
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,600
What are you doing?

202
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:40,270
I'll go add a quarter spoon of white sugar.

203
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,620
Having something sweet now is bad, right?

204
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,550
There is also dried meat floss.

205
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,430
Shi Yi likes it this way.

206
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:49,620
I'll go and get the sugar.

207
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,550
Wait for me here.

208
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:09,000
Why didn't you have the porridge?

209
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:10,500
It's too plain.

210
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,580
You should try to have some.

211
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,300
I'll feed you.

212
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,220
It's sweet.

213
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,320
Where were you last night?

214
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,620
I went to go check on grandma.

215
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:42,740
Is she feeling unwell?

216
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,020
She is better now.

217
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,980
What about Wenxing?

218
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,540
Wenxing is not doing

219
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:02,460
well now.

220
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:05,780
Then why did you bring her here to see me?

221
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,340
She insisted.

222
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,100
I couldn't talk her out of it.

223
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:34,460
A lucky jade.

224
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:37,660
Right.

225
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:38,630
A lucky jade.

226
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:54,300
Please keep me safe.

227
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,300
The other day,

228
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,430
how did you fall into the water?

229
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,490
The boat was turning around

230
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:04,940
when Wenxing lost her balance.

231
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,400
I wanted to keep her steady

232
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,410
but fell in instead.

233
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:10,800
You lost your balance?

234
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,100
Maybe I

235
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,540
stood too close to the edge.

236
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,740
It was not flat where I stood

237
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:15,940
so I tripped and fell.

238
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:25,300
Here.

239
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,160
I don't want any more.

240
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,470
Lie down with me for a while.

241
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:31,790
Lian Sui said you barely had any sleep.

242
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,260
You must feel exhausted.

243
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:37,050
Finish your porridge first.

244
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:39,180
If I finish the porridge,

245
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,980
you will have to lie down with me.

246
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,600
As long as you eat it all up,

247
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,860
I'll lie down with you.

248
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,170
You are so annoying.

249
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,140
Here.

250
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:52,010
♫Time can't steal memories♫

251
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:55,520
♫With all my strength♫

252

♫Tenderly and carefully♫

♫Rewrite the end of the past♫

♫Let the story continue♫

259
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:25,540
♫You're in my dreams♫

260
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:29,000
♫It's getting clearer and clearer♫

261
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,570
♫When the heart beats, one, two, three, four♫

00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:34,400
♫It starts to tremble♫

♫I know what heartache feels like♫

♫Forever and ever is like a dream♫

♫I'll still be with you♫

272
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:25,100
It's already dark.

273
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,580
You were too tired.

274
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,100
Take me to grandma's

275
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,060
tomorrow,

276
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:39,750
will you?

277
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:42,870
But you have not recovered yet.

278
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:44,180
You need to rest.

279
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,820
I'm fine.

280
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:46,580
For real.

281
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:48,540
Grandma likes me.

282
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:49,980
She'd be happy to see me.

283
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,340
Just take me.

284
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,340
If you must visit her,

285
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:57,980
then you might need

286
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,380
to prepare yourself first.

287
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,580
She might not be able

288
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,020
to recognize you now.

289
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:07,340
She was fine

290
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,230
the last time we saw her, right?

291
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:14,660
Are you hungry?

292
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:17,660
A little.

293
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:19,140
I'll go and cook up something

294
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,260
for you.

295
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:22,620
Wait here.

296
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,180
Mother.

297
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,100
Auntie.

298
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:54,260
You look better.

299
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,710
Are you feeling better?

300
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,100
Much better.

301
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:02,220
I'll be fine after a few more days.

302
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:04,300
Young people recover fast,

303
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,580
but you cannot be careless.

304
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:07,980
It's all right to rest for a few months

305
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,620
after going through something so traumatic.

306
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:10,680
Do not be careless,

307
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:11,740
got it?

308
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:13,020
Yes.

309
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,700
Grandma chased me out.

310
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,160
It's better for me to leave.

311
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,160
You guys go ahead.

312
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:24,070
By the way, Chen.

313
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,410
Grandma is now confused

314
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:29,260
and thinks Jiaren is pregnant.

315
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,540
Don't burst her bubble.

316
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:34,950
Make her feel better for me.

317
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:36,580
All right.

318
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:40,940
Miss Shi, thank you

319
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,400
for visiting grandma.

320
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:44,460
Sure.

321
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:56,660
Your mom's sudden kindness toward me

322
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,260
makes me a little afraid.

323
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,480
What are you afraid of?

324
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:01,860
I can't tell.

325
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,460
What happened?

326
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:05,120
Why is she suddenly like this?

327
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:07,560
Come on.

328
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:08,540
Let's go in.

329
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,780
I'm too old now.

330
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:26,940
Who knows

331
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:29,620
if I can meet the baby?

332
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:32,060
Of course, you can.

333
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:34,720
We are counting on you to give him a nickname.

334
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,070
Really?

335
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,500
Your nickname

336
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,300
also came from me.

337
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:42,140
Right.

338
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,660
How time flies.

339
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,130
Now you are already going to have kids.

340
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,220
Chen.

341
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:52,790
Grandma.

342
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:01,180
Who is this?

343
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:02,100
Grandma.

344
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,420
This is Shi Yi.

345
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:04,300
My wife.

346
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:06,220
Nice to see you, grandma.

347
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:15,820
Wenchuan,

348
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,580
you brothers

349
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:20,420
barely see each other.

350
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,660
Now that the two of you are here,

351
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:26,900
why are you two not talking?

352
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,380
Our wives are here to chat with you

353
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:32,040
and we are good here watching.

354
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,180
Grandma, we came here

355
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:35,500
to see you.

356
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,180
We juniors have plenty of time

357
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,380
to talk to each other.

358
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:43,660
Have a seat.

359
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,660
Have a seat.

360
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:46,820
Sit.

361
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,540
A gentleman has three prohibitions.

362
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:07,260
When he is young and immature,

363
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:10,720
he should refrain from sex.

364
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:17,260
When he is an adult and mature,

365
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,650
he should refrain from competing.

366
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,730
He should refrain from competing.

367
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:31,660
When he is old and weak,

368
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,960
he should refrain from being greedy.

369
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:38,660
You brothers

370
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:41,720
are now adults and mature.

371
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,240
Remember to not

372
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:47,340
fight each other

373
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,160
over some lousy possessions.

374
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:57,870
Not everyone has the luck

375
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:03,660
to have brothers.

376
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:12,460
Grandma.

377
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:15,340
You are overthinking this.

378
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,910
Chen and I are fine.

379
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:21,060
Grandma,

380
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,370
it won't happen.

381
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:24,140
They are siblings.

382
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:25,840
Even if anything happens,

383
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,230
I'm here to help.

384
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:29,450
Right, grandma.

385
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,960
You are overthinking it.

386
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:38,340
Shi Yi.

387
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:39,320
Grandma.

388
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,220
Shi Yi.

389
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,260
It's our first time meeting.

390
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:47,300
I don't know

391
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:48,680
what you like.

392
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,480
I have these prayer beads

393
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:54,120
of 18 Buddha pearls.

394
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:56,220
I want you to have them.

395
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,640
Let's go and get them.

396
00:24:57,910 --> 00:24:58,580
Grandma,

397
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,380
you have already asked Zhousheng Chen

398
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:01,460
to give them to me.

399
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:04,710
Have I?

400
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,040
Yes, grandma.

401
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:07,370
She already got them.

402
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,440
Good, good, good.

403
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:13,500
I had been waiting to give them

404
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:15,610
to my eldest grandson's wife.

405
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:16,830
Thank you, grandma.

406
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,340
Mrs. Zhou asks you two

407
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:46,940
to join her for tea tomorrow.

408
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:08,820
I heard from Wenxing

409
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,800
that you read many ancient books.

410
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:12,100
Only some.

411
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,100
I think the words and sentences in ancient books

412
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,180
are just beautiful.

413
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:16,780
What are your favorite ones?

414
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:18,900
There's no specific type.

415
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,260
I like both the published ones

416
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:21,590
and the collected ones.

417
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,180
A girl that likes reading.

418
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:25,180
I like that.

419
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,380
What made you

420
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:32,820
fall for Zhousheng Chen?

421
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:36,300
I heard

422
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:39,950
that you communicated with each other via email for six months.

423
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:42,260
When you only knew

424
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:44,060
that he was a researcher

425
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:45,700
and nothing else,

426
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:48,060
why did you agree to marry him?

427
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,180
Actually

428
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,560
he has many attractive

429
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:54,640
characteristics.

430
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:55,470
For example?

431
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,050
For example,

432
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:02,170
the day we met each other in Xi'an.

433
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:03,390
It was a coincidence

434
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:04,580
and he left

435
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:05,520
briefly after.

436
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:06,740
He said

437
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:07,940
that if the rain stopped,

438
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:09,470
we'd talk about meeting up.

439
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:10,900
The rain stopped eventually at midnight

440
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,580
and he really sent me an email

441
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:14,900
which was very cute.

442
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,230
In the email, he said that it was 4:36am

443
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:19,180
when he left the lab and it was not raining.

444
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,340
And if it doesn't rain

445
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:21,740
at 11:30am,

446
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:23,980
then let's meet at Azure Dragon Temple at 12pm.

447
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:25,420
It was just an email

448
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:26,940
but it showed a lot.

449
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:29,540
It showed that he was disciplined and sincere.

450
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:31,270
A man that would keep his words.

451
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:32,800
They are all

452
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,540
the things I like about him.

453
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:39,660
What if he was faking it?

454
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:43,280
What if he was pretending so that you would like him ?

455
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:44,780
No way.

456
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:46,700
During our six months of email communication,

457
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:47,820
every one of his emails

458
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,100
was like that.

459
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:50,280
His emails

460
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,560
always make me laugh.

461
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:53,380
I've never met someone that is so

462
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,710
adorably disciplined.

463
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,740
Adorable?

464
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:00,490
Everything he does

465
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:01,690
seems adorable to me.

466
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,180
So adorable

467
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:04,860
that as long as I'm thinking about him,

468
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:06,020
no matter how busy work is,

469
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:07,420
I could never feel tired,

470
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:09,500
and no matter how annoying things become,

471
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:10,960
I would never be bothered.

472
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,940
I never thought

473
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,260
that you'd like him

474
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:18,240
because you think he is adorable.

475
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:20,260
Tell me more,

476
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,620
your perspective is very refreshing.

477
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:23,740
As his mom,

478
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:25,180
I've never seen this side of him.

479
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:26,420
From you,

480
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:28,420
I get to know him better.

481
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:32,140
I asked him

482
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,900
why he would dedicate himself to science.

483
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,260
He said that he wanted

484
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:38,060
to make more people happy.

485
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:39,900
It's odd.

486
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:40,960
I used to hate it

487
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:43,260
when people say fancy things like that,

488
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,320
but he is the only exception.

489
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,380
As long as it's him,

490
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,160
I'll totally buy it

491
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,640
and believe that's what he thinks.

492
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,170
Not at all would I think he's trying to fool me.

493
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,560
Looks like

494
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,120
you are the perfect girl for him.

495
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,200
However,

496
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:15,360
I still insist

497
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,640
on my previous thought

498
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:20,290
that you are not the right person for this family.

499
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,900
You come from a good family,

500
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,540
not very rich or powerful,

501
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:27,340
but very knowledgeable.

502
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:28,980
Your parents are happy.

503
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,310
You don't have siblings

504
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:33,860
or a complicated social life.

505
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:35,780
You have stable life routines

506
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:36,960
and stable things to do.

507
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:37,680
You have regular work

508
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,960
yet it's also flexible.

509
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,080
Is it all true?

510
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:41,960
Yes.

511
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,930
I stay with my parents on weekends.

512
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,860
On workdays, I read in the morning

513
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:48,240
and work from noon

514
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,240
to midnight.

515
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:51,560
All I have to face are the scripts

516
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,220
and the recording directors.

517
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:54,080
When I just started to work,

518
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,360
I didn't go to a fixed recording studio...

519
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,830
Later on I got my own studio,

520
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:58,530
I didn't need to run around anymore,

521
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:00,790
so there were fewer people for me to meet.

522
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:01,740
Besides,

523
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:03,660
I don't like offline activities,

524
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:04,910
so I barely attend any.

525
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:06,830
You've known your coworkers for years

526
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:08,630
and have several close friends.

527
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:11,910
Your social circle has always been small and intimate.

528
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:15,720
I like to put my time

529
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,260
into working and reading.

530
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:18,880
The rest

531
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,340
I spend it with my parents.

532
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,680
A simple social life

533
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,610
suits me better.

534
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:27,360
You've made such a

535
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,690
good life for yourself.

536
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:30,540
You have such a good job.

537
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,000
Why don't you go back

538
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:34,960
to your own life?

539
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:38,880
Shi Yi,

540
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:40,680
listen to me.

541
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:43,520
A few decades ago,

542
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,880
Ren's mom

543
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,700
passed away from an accident.

544
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,640
To protect Ren,

545
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:52,840
we decided to tell him about it

546
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,640
several years later.

547
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,160
However,

548
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,640
the entire Zhou family could not let it go.

549
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,720
The fourth uncle even called the police

550
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:03,800
to investigate me.

551
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:06,040
It was chaotic.

552
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,320
Until today,

553
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:10,070
the fourth uncle and I haven't seen each other.

554
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,200
Of course,

555
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:14,320
the fourth uncle is an honest and decent person,

556
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:16,690
he was also used by those relatives.

557
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:18,780
I never really blamed him for anything.

558
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:19,560
In a big family

559
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,180
like ours,

560
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,480
with so many people.

561
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:23,240
It's just like a small society.

562
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,500
Where there are both good and bad people.

563
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,840
Some people are good

564
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,560
while some are bad.

565
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:30,000
Some of them

566
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:31,740
may not do anything bad,

567
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:33,540
but they are far from being nice.

568
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:35,780
They'd only give you a hard time

569
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:37,510
and wish you a bad life.

570
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:40,190
It would be fine

571
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:41,870
if they were just strangers.

572
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,640
Unfortunately, they are your relatives.

573
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,240
What should you do with them?

574
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:48,680
You don't even like

575
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,560
complicated relations.

576
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,040
Why must you make yourself suffer

577
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:54,080
and join our big family?

578
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:01,400
Mom.

579
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,080
You look good.

580
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,420
What are you doing here?

581
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:12,350
You secretly invited Shi Yi for tea..

582
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:13,950
So I came to have some as well.

583
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:17,570
What were you guys talking about?

584
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:19,590
We were talking about...

585
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:24,440
We were just talking about Shi Yi's painting.

586
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,600
Mr. Chen is usually

587
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,730
hermitic and proud,

588
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:30,070
yet he said so many nice things about Shi Yi.

589
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,800
I like that painting too.

590
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,410
Too bad Mr. Feng got it.

591
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,560
Why don't you paint one more

592
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:41,110
and we can keep it at home?

593
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:58,040
Why don't I try to recreate it ?

594
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:35,290
It's very similar.

595
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:37,120
It's almost 70 to 80 percent alike.

596
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:39,179
But the feelings are very different.

597
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:42,320
It looks the same to me.

598
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:44,900
Shi Yi's painting is more

599
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,909
like the last lotus flower at the end of the summer.

600
00:34:46,909 --> 00:34:47,909
Cold and distant.

601
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,389
While Chen's painting is freer.

602
00:34:52,389 --> 00:34:54,449
It's more like the fresh lotus flower

603
00:34:54,489 --> 00:34:56,179
in a green pond

604
00:34:56,290 --> 00:34:58,270
at the beginning of summer.

605
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,700
My eldest brother is a fresh lotus flower

606
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:05,200
passionately waiting

607
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,730
for his partner to blossom.

608
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,850
So he is waiting for Shi Yi.

609
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:16,150
Is it similar?

610
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:17,710
Yes.

611
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,300
Look at how clean and pure the lotus flowers are.

612
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:55,580
[Look at how clean and pure the lotus flowers are. It should be the same for the heart.]

613
00:35:53,810 --> 00:35:55,940
It should be the same for the heart.

614
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,420
Chen,

615
00:35:57,610 --> 00:36:00,070
you are referring to a poem by Meng Haoran, right?

616
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:01,870
It goes well with this painting.

617
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:15,980
[Look at how clean and pure the lotus flowers are. It should be the same for the heart.]

618
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:28,600
Mother.

619
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,280
There you are.

620
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:36,400
Did Shi Yi draw this?

621
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:38,440
Chen drew it.

622
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:42,600
Chen?

623
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:45,790
Look at the lotus flower,

624
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:49,050
it is clean even though it's surroundings are muddy.

625
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:51,080
He wants to remind himself

626
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:53,900
that he should not be affected by worldly troubles

627
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:55,540
and to protect his own heart.

628
00:36:59,100 --> 00:36:59,900
This painting

629
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:03,300
is for us.

630
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:06,540
Why is it for us?

631
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:08,580
He is not good at expressing himself

632
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:10,440
so this is the only thing he can do.

633
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:14,180
He is trying to tell us

634
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:15,860
that he cares about Shi Yi

635
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:17,860
from the bottom of his heart.

636
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:21,700
If it's not that,

637
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:22,580
then how can he

638
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:24,300
imitate her work so well

639
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:26,060
from only looking at it once?

640
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:34,380
[Shufeng Garden]

641
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:39,820
Seems like

642
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:41,640
I am not right for your family.

643
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:43,620
Neither am I.

644
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:46,680
Were you like this when you were a kid?

645
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:50,030
I was similar to you when you were a kid.

646
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:51,380
Could you get used

647
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:52,860
to living in such an environment

648
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:53,990
when you were young?

649
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:57,480
I could not get used to it and I did not like it.

650
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:59,310
But I couldn' t get rid of it.

651
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:01,700
I think blood relationship

652
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:02,620
is the only connection

653
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:03,620
between people

654
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:05,070
that we can't get rid of.

655
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,060
I prefer a simple life.

656
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:10,780
You like Venus

657
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:11,780
better than Earth

658
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:13,380
where you live in.

659
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:16,340
Mars is also acceptable.

660
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:22,790
Do you regret it?

661
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,160
Suddenly coming back?

662
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:25,500
Back in Bremen

663
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:26,340
when you talked about these,

664
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:28,060
I did not know much about your family.

665
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:29,180
But now,

666
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:30,380
it looks like

667
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:31,780
no one wants you back.

668
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:34,460
I have no regrets.

669
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:37,220
No matter how much you achieve,

670
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:39,020
you should always try your best

671
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:41,150
to guard the ground beneath your feet.

672
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:42,610
If you can't,

673
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:43,940
your people will have no one

674
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:45,180
strong enough to rely on,

675
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:45,840
won't they?

676
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:50,040
Just like the Jewish people in old times.

677
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:51,540
No matter where they lived

678
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:52,420
in this world,

679
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,240
without a powerful homeland,

680
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:56,480
they could lose it all at any time.

681
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:05,940
You have too many things

682
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:07,260
stored here.

683
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:09,580
I'm fine with only occupying a small part.

684
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:10,260
But,

685
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:13,600
I want everything that's related to romantic love.

686
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:17,540
Sure.

687
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:19,040
It's all yours.

688
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:33,940
Lin Fei went to the Lake Tai

689
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:35,140
to get this fish this afternoon.

690
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:36,020
It's fresh.

691
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:38,580
Medicated diet coming through.

692
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,980
Is this all for me?

693
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:50,900
Your wife asked for it.

694
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:53,120
It's supposed to be very nutritious.

695
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:56,350
Granduncle.

696
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:58,300
Enjoy the food.

697
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:00,880
It's very nutritious.

698
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:09,940
You've been working too hard these days.

699
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:11,140
You can really use it.

700
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:13,460
I don't need any.

701
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:16,180
I looked it up online.

702
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,260
It's good for your health.

703
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:18,340
Try some.

704
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:24,700
Fine.

705
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:42,780
There is traditional Chinese medicine inside?

706
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:44,300
You had too much when you were young

707
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:45,700
and you don't like it now?

708
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:50,360
I don't fancy traditional Chinese medicine that much.

709
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:51,940
Bitter medicine is good for health.

710
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:53,020
And it's not even medicine.

711
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:54,340
It's just food that has medicinal properties.

712
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:55,380
It's tasty.

713
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:56,540
Just try some.

714
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:10,740
Have some more.

715
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:21,780
It's pretty good.

716
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:36,820
Where are you going?

717
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:37,950
Delivering grapes.

718
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:39,580
How many times are you doing this in one day?

719
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:40,580
Are you delivering grapes one by one?

720
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:42,580
Can't you give them some time alone?

721
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:44,380
I now wish

722
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:45,700
that they have already passed this passionate phase

723
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:47,260
and become an old couple

724
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:47,860
so

725
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:49,740
that they wouldn't feel bothered by me.

726
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:50,500
Gee,

727
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:51,460
he married her

728
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:52,860
for you, didn't he?

729
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:55,100
Can you give them some space?

730
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:57,280
None of your business.

731
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:15,350
Is something bothering you ?

732
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:18,020
Nothing.

733
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:20,340
I have been reading, haven't I?

734
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:22,900
You move around every other minute.

735
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:24,660
It doesn't seem like you're reading.

736
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:25,140
I...

737
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:49,700
You are not working either,

738
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:50,980
aren't you?

739
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:52,800
How else could you know

740
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:54,500
that I was not reading?

741
00:43:58,980 --> 00:43:59,620
How about

742
00:44:00,850 --> 00:44:02,380
we continue this on the bed?

743
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:05,430
No, let's do it here.

744
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:13,260
Granduncle!

745
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:16,540
Granduncle.

746
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:18,140
Come out for a minute.

747
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:33,860
I'm going out then.

748
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:04,170
Something happened.

749
00:45:04,350 --> 00:45:05,680
I'll go and check it out.

750
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:15,220
You should rest early.
