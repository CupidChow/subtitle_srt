4
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:56,990
Mr. Mei.

5
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,720
Come on in.

6
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:35,750
Something to drink?

7
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,160
I'll have some

8
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:40,230
-Wisk...
-Sorry.

9
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,960
My assistant took all the liquor.

10
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,220
There are only drinks.

11
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:45,070
In the fridge.

12
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,820
It's fine then. I'm not thirsty.

13
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:00,080
Our families are old friends.

14
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,720
You and I

15
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,150
should have been friends a long time ago.

16
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,430
In my opinion,

17
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:07,500
it's the most convenient

18
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,940
for you and me

19
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,040
to maintain this working relationship.

20
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,540
I haven't had a chance to read

21
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:15,820
the files your secretary sent yet.

22
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,550
If that's what you're here for,

23
00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:19,980
then you're bound to return empty-handed.

24
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:24,660
Is there a problem

25
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:27,900
with my project?

26
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:28,900
Or

27
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,440
have you found any loopholes?

28
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:34,900
If you are afraid that there are loopholes,

29
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,280
you can have your legal team

30
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,210
go over it again.

31
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,260
I don't mind.

32
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,180
Anyway,

33
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:43,200
I'm too busy now to read it.

34
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,980
Then I'll keep waiting.

35
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,800
I won't take anymore of your time.

36
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,100
By the way,

37
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:05,800
there's one more thing.

38
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:06,710
Go ahead.

39
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:09,950
My assistants didn't know how to behave.

40
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,700
If they have offended you in any way,

41
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:13,900
please forgive them.

42
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:15,660
It's nothing.

43
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,019
My lawyers

44
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,060
also

45
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,500
always strive for efficiency.

46
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,899
They can sometimes be unkind.

47
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:22,460
So if they

48
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:23,740
offend you in any way,

49
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,420
please forgive them too.

50
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:31,780
By the way,

51
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,500
I hate troubles.

52
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,060
I hate it when people drag me into trouble.

53
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,790
And I very much hate wasting time helping people.

54
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,580
I'm not a compassionate person.

55
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:45,180
So I don't have many friends.

56
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:47,460
Zhousheng Chen

57
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,700
is one of my few

58
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,620
best friends.

59
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:52,420
Furthermore,

60
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,700
he is the most important one.

61
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,470
My eldest brother is lucky.

62
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:25,180
So if something happens to him again in Bremen,

63
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:27,780
I'll definitely blame you for that.

64
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,510
He's of good character.

65
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,100
I am not.

66
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:36,740
He is tolerant.

67
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,430
I'm definitely not.

68
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,580
You remember this.

69
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,140
Mr. Mei.

70
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:46,040
I think you have a wrong impression of me.

71
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:48,840
You are the only person

72
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:49,500
who's had a conflict of interest with him

73
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,980
during these several years.

74
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:53,310
It's only natural to be suspicious of you.

75
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,240
Then let me give you a serious answer.

76
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,460
I'm his younger brother.

77
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,340
I'm more worried about his safety

78
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:00,500
than anyone else.

79
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:02,340
That's right.

80
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,580
Blood is thicker than water.

81
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,180
He's your own brother.

82
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:10,440
I won't hold you up.

83
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:12,060
I'll read your files

84
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,060
as soon as I can.

85
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:18,860
I'll wait for your good news.

86
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,100
I've been feeding them for a week now

87
00:06:54,659 --> 00:06:56,900
but I still don't even know their names yet.

88
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,820
The one with the big pincers is called sodium chloride.

89
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:01,420
The other one is called monosodium glutamate.

90
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:03,370
I know sodium chloride.

91
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:05,620
The other one, sodium glutamate?

92
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,220
MSG.

93
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,380
Ah I see.

94
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,100
By the way,

95
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:15,220
the internet at my new place is still not ready.

96
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,380
I want to move the day after tomorrow.

97
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,460
I won't cause you any trouble, right?

98
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,420
No. He won't be back for a while.

99
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:20,940
Why?

100
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,380
Something came up at the research institute

101
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:24,020
he worked in.

102
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:25,950
He's not sure when he'll come back.

103
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,180
The two of you only saw each other

104
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:35,980
a few times after getting married.

105
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,780
Now you have to live apart again.

106
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,530
Don't you think that'll affect your marriage?

107
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:43,330
We're taking things in stride and getting closer.

108
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:46,740
Ms. Shi.

109
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,900
You're in danger.

110
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:52,490
You're numbing yourself and living in your fantasies.

111
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:55,620
We only live once.

112
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:57,580
Why make it hard for yourself?

113
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:01,500
Fine, fine, you're tolerant.

114
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:03,900
Right.

115
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,700
The finals for the dubbing contest

116
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,020
is set in Wuzhen.

117
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,070
Do you want to go?

118
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,530
You're going to be one of the judges, so what am I going for?

119
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:11,690
I'm the main judge.

120
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,300
I can take one person with me.

121
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:18,100
Your professor can't go.

122
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,860
That's why you're begging me to go.

123
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,920
It's free of charge, do you want to go?

124
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,340
Did the organizers book the whole of Wuzhen?

125
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,540
Nothing like that.

126
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,100
They booked a few inns.

127
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:28,720
The organizers gave me two rooms.

128
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,580
If you go, I'll share one with you.

129
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:32,620
Fine.

130
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,430
This is going to be a difficult one.

131
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,540
Yes and no.

132
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:52,220
I'm just curious about Zhousheng Chen.

133
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:54,200
Think about it.

134
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,660
How could a scientist

135
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,300
with a simple background

136
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:57,940
who didn't know anything about business

137
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,670
before the age of twenty-eight

138
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,900
suddenly come back

139
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,520
and take the helm of the family business?

140
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,500
If you were asked to take over the family business,

141
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,560
you wouldn't do it?

142
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:07,710
I read all his papers

143
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,220
to get to know him better.

144
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:10,180
He's a

145
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,620
real scientist.

146
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:12,890
He's the real deal.

147
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,840
If he really wanted to inherit the family business,

148
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,100
why would he stay in a lab

149
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,900
and work his ass off for 10 years?

150
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,180
What's the point?

151
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:22,580
Fine.

152
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:24,440
You think about it.

153
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,880
I'll go back and catch up on my sleep. I have a headache.

154
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:02,180
I was busy with work for the past two days

155
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:04,780
and didn't have time to reply to your messages.

156
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:18,540
Where are you?

157
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,540
What are you doing?

158
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:38,210
I just got back from a business trip.

159
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:40,040
You were so busy that

160
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,060
you didn't even have time to send me a message?

161
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,700
I've been quite busy these days.

162
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:43,380
I'm sorry.

163
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,580
But I won't be working tomorrow.

164
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,040
I'm going to Wuzhen tomorrow.

165
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,740
To work or to have fun?

166
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,580
Fun, I guess.

167
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:58,780
Wuzhen.

168
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,480
Wuzhen is a nice place.

169
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,780
I visited that place before.

170
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:02,380
It's good.

171
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,340
So, are you going with friends?

172
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:10,700
Yes, my roommate.

173
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:13,300
Wuzhen.

174
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,120
Wuzhen is really nice.

175
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:17,180
One of the four ancient towns of Jiangnan.

176
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:17,980
If I have the chance,

177
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,840
I'd really like to go there again.

178
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,840
You're not working tomorrow, right?

179
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:28,620
Let's go together.

180
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:29,750
It's not far anyway.

181
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:33,080
Aren't you going with your roommate?

182
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:34,100
Would it be convenient?

183
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,100
She's on a business trip and I'm coming with her.

184
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,060
You can come along

185
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,900
and help me carry my bag.

186
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:40,880
No problem.

187
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:42,380
I'll make arrangements tonight

188
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:43,310
and let you know.

189
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,820
Okay, see you then.

190
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:45,490
See you later.

191
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:46,020
Bye, bye.

192
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:04,750
You're here.

193
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,030
I'll do the introductions.

194
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,140
This is Du Feng.

195
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,220
This is Shi Yi.

196
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:10,820
Hello.

197
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:11,380
Hello.

198
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:13,580
Your rooms

199
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:14,740
are not in the same inn as mine.

200
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:15,900
But it's not far away.

201
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,220
I'll be treating my colleagues to dinner tonight.

202
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:18,520
Why don't you two come as well?

203
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,620
What's the occasion?

204
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,680
I won a prize last time. So I promised.

205
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:22,420
Okay.

206
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,340
Let's go to the inn first.

207
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:30,740
Let me introduce you guys.

208
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,140
These are my colleagues.

209
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:33,060
Mr. Liu Jin.

210
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:34,220
The dubber for

211
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,300
the documentary of the Three Qin Lands.

212
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,460
This is Mr. Dong Pei.

213
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,060
And this is Mr. Wan Yongcheng.

214
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:38,900
My dubbing partner

215
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,300
in "Bones of a Great Man".

216
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,220
You've made such a detailed

217
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,300
introduction, Shi Yi.

218
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:44,580
Actually, we'll get acquainted

219
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:45,540
as we eat.

220
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:46,300
Come on, come on.

221
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:46,700
Right.

222
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:49,020
Thanks to Ms. Shi

223
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,460
for treating us to a meal.

224
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,020
Let me introduce you.

225
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:53,940
This is reporter Hong Xiaoyu.

226
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,660
She's usually a professional too.

227
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:56,900
Anyway, we are all the same today.

228
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:57,740
Those who can sit here

229
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,070
are all professionals.

230
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:00,180
Come on.

231
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,060
Tonight we gather in Wuzhen.

232
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:02,740
Let's let loose

233
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,740
and just have fun.

234
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:04,220
All right!

235
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,420
Cheers!

236
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,440
Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you.

237
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:10,580
Let's eat.

238
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:11,310
Come on, eat.

239
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,220
This is... this is yam, right?

240
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:18,540
Let me tell you.

241
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,300
When you're done eating,

242
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:22,020
don't wander around.

243
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,860
Most water towns

244
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:25,780
are haunted.

245
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,180
What?

246
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,220
Didn't you tell us last time?

247
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:32,300
The story of the water town in Jiangnan.

248
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,100
There was a man who lived there

249
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,580
that suddenly disappeared.

250
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:37,440
Then out of nowhere, he came back.

251
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,740
Why would you suddenly bring this up?

252
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:41,400
Don't you know Shi Yi is timid?

253
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:42,800
It's not even dark yet.

254
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:43,900
It's not that bad.

255
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,100
At night it will be.

256
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:46,700
All right, all right.

257
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,300
Let's eat.

258
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,820
How does he know you're timid?

259
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,100
People who have worked together with me for a long time know this.

260
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:00,830
It's normal.

261
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:02,900
It's not.

262
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:04,580
Not at all.

263
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:07,500
It's very abnormal.

264
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:08,980
Don't gossip.

265
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:14,340
One last question.

266
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:16,620
If your husband

267
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,180
knows someone likes you,

268
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:19,700
will he be jealous?

269
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:23,100
I think so.

270
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:24,820
You

271
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,260
think so?

272
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,340
That's why I said

273
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,140
you should marry someone who

274
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,940
loves you more than you love him.

275
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:35,700
I can see that you like him a lot.

276
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,020
How you guys got together.

277
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:38,580
You even agreed to legally marry him

278
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:41,040
without going through the proper ceremony.

279
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,670
You're too attached to him.

280
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:45,340
You're a precious heirloom.

281
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:48,020
But you sold yourself as a pearl at a roadside stall.

282
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,700
What kind of metaphor is that?

283
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,660
It is what it is.

284
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,500
His love for me is better than any ceremony.

285
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:56,420
He has never treated me

286
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:57,820
like a pearl from a stall.

287
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:01,140
[Zhousheng Chen]

288
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:05,150
I'll take a call.

289
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:07,760
Come on.

290
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:09,660
One more.

291
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,500
Okay. Cheers.

292
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:11,440
Cheers!

293
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:12,110
Have fun!

294
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:12,660
Cheers!

295
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:17,900
We're having a gathering,

296
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,230
it was a bit noisy there.

297
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,380
Then I'll start.

298
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:23,820
Go ahead.

299
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:25,620
This morning,

300
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:26,580
I got up at 5:45.

301
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:28,300
as I usually do.

302
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,190
But last night,

303
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,020
there was a heavy rainstorm in Bremen.

304
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,020
So the whole balcony

305
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:34,300
was full of water.

306
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:36,540
It took me ten minutes

307
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,260
to clean up the balcony.

308
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:39,260
Then it took me another

309
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:40,620
ten minutes

310
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,450
to bake a piece of toast,

311
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:44,090
and warm up a glass of milk.

312
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:45,740
It was dawn

313
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,430
when I finished breakfast.

314
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:56,480
I think someone has been interested in me recently.

315
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:57,710
Wang Yingdong?

316
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,140
How do you know?

317
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:03,220
I've always known.

318
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,380
Do you want to ask

319
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:10,900
if I mind?

320
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:14,860
You can take it as

321
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:16,580
I do mind,

322
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:17,900
that's why I want to

323
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,560
keep track of you all the time.

324
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,430
It's also because I mind

325
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:23,340
so I remembered his name.

326
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:26,340
Really?

327
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:29,580
Yes.

328
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,140
What?

329
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,900
Thinking about the wonders of marriage again?

330
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:03,240
If someone is pursuing your wife,

331
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:04,660
what would you do?

332
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:07,839
Wouldn't this solve the problem?

333
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:11,270
Someone's after your wife?

334
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,829
What's your solution then?

335
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:25,780
Why is Shi Yi so afraid of the dark?

336
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,140
It's rare to see an adult

337
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:28,740
to be this afraid of the dark.

338
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:30,420
It's normal.

339
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,540
After my grandmother got old,

340
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:34,420
she too refused to live at home by herself.

341
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,260
She either had someone with her,

342
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:38,390
or she went to her children's home.

343
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,520
There must be a story behind this.

344
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:46,060
Were you taking a random guess?

345
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:46,740
Was I right?

346
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:50,340
She

347
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,740
dreamed a lot ever since she was a child.

348
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:55,140
All her dreams were about wars.

349
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:57,020
After this went on for some time,

350
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:58,480
she began to fear the dark.

351
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,260
She didn't like to be alone.

352
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,940
And she didn't talk to the others.

353
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:03,940
She even went to see a psychiatrist.

354
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:04,540
But,

355
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:06,740
they didn't find anything wrong with her.

356
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:08,870
Then she took two years off from school

357
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:11,040
and got better when she came back.

358
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:13,060
But she's still afraid of the dark.

359
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:13,540
Of course,

360
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:16,000
she much better now than when she was a child.

361
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:18,860
But my mother said

362
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,140
maybe it's because she is

363
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,300
born artistic

364
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:23,190
and is more sensitive to stuff.

365
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:25,700
She is very good at Chinese painting.

366
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,060
In junior high school, she was one of

367
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,520
the best Guzheng players.

368
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,940
After she graduated from junior high school,

369
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,060
she didn't want to practice Guzheng anymore

370
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,340
and started to learn Guqin.

371
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:35,260
She won many more awards for that too.

372
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,720
She seems pretty capable.

373
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:43,140
What?

374
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:43,980
You seem

375
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:47,200
particularly interested in her.

376
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,460
No, I was just asking.

Shi Yi is married.

378
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,860
I know, you told me.

379
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,430
I'm telling you.

380
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,460
I have a thing about acting morally.

381
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:03,720
I'm only interested in unmarried women.

You're still awake at this hour?

384
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,980
I had a dream.

385
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,720
The same dream

386
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,800
repeated over and over again.

387
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:39,040
I knew I was dreaming.

388
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,630
But I just couldn't wake up.

389
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,200
I could only watch it.

390
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:43,980
A nightmare?

391
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:45,820
Yes.

392

Those water towns

393
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:50,460
more or less have stories with them.

394
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,790
I've heard some of folklores

395

before.

396
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:55,410
But I didn't believe them.

397

Are you too tired during the day?

398

I heard some strange noises.

I was copying the names of famous teas in the past.

He brought a lot of things here.

519
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:09,100
I've also prepared something for your colleagues.

520
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,630
All of Shi Yi's colleagues.

521
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:12,060
Thank you.

522
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,380
Such a good kid.

523
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:15,980
It's Chen's idea.

524
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:18,060
He said she was on a business trip.

525
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:18,980
If I only

526
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:19,980
prepared stuff for her,

527
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:20,980
it'd be impolite.

528
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:23,940
Shi Yi.

529
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:25,460
Can I take a look around?

530
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:25,990
Go ahead.

531
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:33,300
Lian Sui.

532
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,700
Why the sudden visit?

533
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:37,180
I don't know.

534
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:39,300
This morning Ren said you were in Wuzhen.

535
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:39,860
He didn't even give us

536
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:40,580
time to prepare

537
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:42,180
and just came straight here.

538
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:43,100
Right.

539
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:47,820
In fact, he also prepared a cook for you.

540
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,700
It wouldn't be nice to say it in front of your colleagues.

541
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:50,300
If need be,

542
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:52,900
you can get the cook to make you something nice.

543
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,420
Are you not happy?

544
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,340
Don't you miss us?

545
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:02,140
I miss you every day

546
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:04,520
and look forward to you coming home soon.

547
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:05,350
I do.

548
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:08,050
I'll go clean up first.

549
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:09,860
Ren.

550
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:10,820
I'll go back later.

551
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:12,080
Are you coming with me?

552
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:13,380
No.

553
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:15,700
I'll stay here.

554
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:17,900
You'll stay here?

555
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:19,220
What if

556
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,140
they are busy with work

557
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:22,270
and don't have time to take care of you?

558
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:24,300
Shi Yi.

559
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:27,070
When will you finish your work?

560
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:29,220
I need to go to the finals later.

561
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:31,150
After that, I can keep you company.

562
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:33,100
Can I come along?

563
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:34,380
Yes, you can.

564
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:37,340
But I don't have time for you.

565
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:39,300
Meilin.

566
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:40,660
Could you help me

567
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:41,660
take care of him.

568
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,620
The higher-ups are coming today.

569
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,020
I need to entertain them.

570
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:49,350
Then give me a ticket. I'll go on my own.

571
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,900
On your own?

572
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:51,940
That's right.

573
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,840
Don't you try to follow me.

574
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:57,340
I don't care.

575
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,420
I'll go then.

576
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:04,900
Shi Yi.

577
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:07,180
I'll stay here and read.

578
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:07,980
You do your work.

579
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:09,040
I won't bother you.

580
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,140
Okay.

581
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,260
Why do I feel like

582
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:42,620
a parent?

583
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:53,470
The emperor died in the Palace of Changle.

584
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,230
After the death of the emperor,

585
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:59,070
seals were given to the vassal princes and kings.

586
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,580
The Junior Prince of Nanchen...

587
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:16,060
Shi Yi, are you writing about

588
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:16,980
the Zhousheng Chen

589
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,110
from ancient times?

590
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:19,590
You know him too?

591
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:20,580
Yes.

592
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:22,000
He's in my family tree.

593
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:24,140
He was a traitor.

594
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:26,390
But he's pretty admirable.

595
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:27,660
Admirable?

596
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:30,950
He was with the crown princess,

597
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:32,540
isn't that cool?

598
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:35,270
Who was the crown princess?

599
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:37,820
She basically would become the future empress.

600
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:38,700
Yet she gave up everything

601
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:39,960
and jumped off the wall

602
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:40,980
for him.

603
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,340
Don't you think he's a cool guy?

604
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:46,340
That's true.

605
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:48,900
I heard from my mother

606
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:50,460
Chen deliberately

607
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,860
took his name.

608
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:52,860
So I became

609
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,190
more interested in him.

610
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:57,430
It's a pity that there's little information.

611
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:59,380
Yes, there is very little information about him.

612
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,660
And all the records said he was a bad person.

613
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:03,390
A traitor, a sycophant, a treacherous minister.

614
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,460
So you want to write

615
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:08,910
what you know about him?

616
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:10,920
I'm writing it for myself.

617
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,100
Just like you.

618
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:13,980
Chen was named after him,

619
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,340
so I'm so interested.

620
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,380
Then, after you finish it,

621
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:18,620
can you show it to me?

622
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:19,580
Sure.

623
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:22,070
But you have to finish reading this first.

624
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:22,900
Okay.

625
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:34,140
The Junior Prince of Nanchen refused to cry when he got the seal.

626
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:36,780
He said, "The seal is smaller."

627
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:39,180
"I'm afraid there have been changes in the capital."

628
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:40,580
Ren, it's time to go.

629
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,100
You should let Shi Yi rest.

630
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:44,960
Good night, Shi Yi.

631
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:45,820
Sleep early.

632
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:47,780
Leaving now?

633
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:48,910
Good night, Meilin.

634
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:49,640
Good night.

635
00:30:59,020 --> 00:30:59,900
I almost thought

636
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:00,820
he was going to stay here

637
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:03,100
and keep chatting until dawn.

638
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:05,780
But don't you think

639
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:06,900
he is such a good boy

640
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,300
when he's reading a book?

641
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:10,240
How come?

642
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:13,540
I have a feeling

643
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:14,820
Zhousheng Chen was like this too

644
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:15,750
when he was a kid.

645
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:21,260
I should get used to it.

646
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:33,500
What's wrong? You don't want to leave yet?

647
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,780
Are you thinking

648
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:36,420
if you were a girl,

649
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:38,180
you'd be able to stay overnight?

650
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:39,440
You don't understand.

651
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:41,180
Chen is worried about Shi Yi.

652
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:41,980
Otherwise

653
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:43,620
he wouldn't have asked me to come here.

654
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:44,500
Besides,

655
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:46,740
there is someone interested in her living here.

656
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,220
Though he's not a threat.

657
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:50,220
You guys

658
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:51,270
should work hard

659
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,660
and pay attention to the situation here.

660
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:53,190
Yes, sir!

661
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,460
He'll definitely become a jealous lover

662
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:59,020
when he grows up.

663
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:12,780
I'm going to meet

664
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:13,700
the winner this afternoon.

665
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:14,900
I can't take you there.

666
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,220
If you don't want to go home,

667
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:17,820
you can stay here and do your homework.

668
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:18,550
Is that okay?

669
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:21,500
Shi Yi.

670
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:23,460
I found that you're better at peeling mangosteens

671
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:24,740
than average people.

672
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:27,070
Don't we all do it like this?

673
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:28,880
The technique looks the same.

674
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,460
But because you're beautiful,

675
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:32,520
it's like an art when you're doing it.

676
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:34,420
You brat.

677
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:42,780
Congratulations.

678
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:44,580
You've got three more students.

679
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:48,380
They all want you to be their teacher.

680
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:49,780
Which one would you take?

681
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,940
I'll take your advice.

682
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:14,640
♫Give me your smiling♫

683
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:19,150
♫Corners of mouth and eyes♫

It's a pity if they got wet.

814
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:10,820
It would become wasted effort if the dye came off.

Sure.

816
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,380
I suddenly thought of

817
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:29,460
a plot of a movie.

818
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:31,390
I did dubbing for it in the past.

819
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:33,540
Let's hear it.

820
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:35,870
Qingcheng was under siege.

821
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:37,980
The Junior Prince of Nanchen led 10,000 cavalry,

822
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:39,140
travelled day and night,

823
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:40,540
and came to reinforce the city

824
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:42,270
against 130,000 enemy troops.

825
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:44,300
Twenty days later,

826
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,220
reinforcements arrived at the city.

827
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:48,880
The Nanchen courtiers did not expect anything.

828
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:50,780
But suddenly, they saw dozens of

829
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:52,060
long, raven-colored fabric hanging

830
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:53,500
on the city wall.

831
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:55,220
In tatters,

832
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:57,390
they fluttered in the strong wind.

833
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:58,740
The grey banner

834
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,860
was the banner of the Junior Prince of Nanchen.

835
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:01,980
The cloths flying around

836
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,780
on the walls of the city

837
00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:05,780
tell the courtiers

838
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:08,070
this city has not yet been breached.

839
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:10,190
Two hundred thousand reinforcements

840
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:11,640
shouted and cheered at once

841
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,170
with a loud and clear voice.

842
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:15,820
This is the great victory of Qingcheng.

843
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:18,860
I feel like I've gone back to my childhood

844
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:20,380
listening to your story.

845
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:22,260
When I was little,

846
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:24,350
there wasn't much entertainment.

847
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:25,620
Grandma had dry eyes

848
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:27,270
and couldn't watch much TV.

849
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:28,380
So every evening,

850
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:29,780
we listened to

851
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:32,100
the radio anchor telling stories.

852
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:33,460
Dry eyes?

853
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:35,540
Is she better now?

854
00:38:37,370 --> 00:38:38,860
She has many minor illnesses.

855
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:40,060
It's hard to recover.

856
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:42,900
Plus, she's getting older.

857
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:44,180
Maybe a good rest

858
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:45,580
is the best medicine.

859
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:54,140
It's raining.

860
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:55,620
It's raining. Hurry up and collect them.

861
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:57,180
Hurry up and collect them!

862
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:59,460
We'll give you a hand.

863
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:01,660
Thank you.

864
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:07,020
They must've been on a date here.

865
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:08,350
Look.

866
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,230
They are embarrassed already.

867
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:11,940
How interesting having a date here.

868
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:13,020
There are fabrics obscuring people's view.

869
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:14,680
They can be comfortable here.

870
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:31,900
Watch out.

871
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:34,080
Did you guys come back by boat?

872
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:36,140
I was worried

873
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:38,200
you guys would get caught in the rain.

874
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:40,460
It's raining so hard.

875
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:42,580
Are they not back yet?

876
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:44,820
Weren't you guys together?

877
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:45,220
No.

878
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:47,520
I had something to do so I came back first.

879
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:49,390
This is...

880
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:51,040
This is my husband.

881
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:07,260
Your wife is on a business trip, but you've travelled here to see her.

882
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:08,990
I happen to have some free time.

883
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:09,890
Good.

884
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,580
Here, take the umbrella.

885
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:13,540
No need, it's near.

886
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:14,700
We'll run over there.

887
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:15,700
-Let's go.
-Okay.

888
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:16,790
Let's go.

889
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:20,360
Young people are so romantic.

890
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:30,140
Ren.

891
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,420
I'll take my leave.

892
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:49,060
He knew you're back?

893
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:54,020
You told him without telling me.

894
00:40:58,660 --> 00:40:59,720
No wonder he knows.

895
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:02,100
Your luggage has been brought here.

896
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:07,820
What did you

897
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,740
call me just now?

898
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:15,650
I forgot.

899
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:17,260
Did I say something?

900
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,490
What are you working on?

901
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:30,740
The temperature.

902
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:31,540
I'm afraid

903
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:32,670
you'll catch a cold.

904
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,180
♫In the memory♫

905
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:59,700
♫The snow-covered city tower♫

906
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:06,280
♫When your name rings out♫

907
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:10,990
♫Finally blooming again♫

908
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:14,410
♫Like a flower of the soul♫

909
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:21,390
♫The dreams that have accompanied me through the light years♫

910
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:25,030
♫I know that with just one look♫

911
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:29,420
♫I can be sure it's the end♫

912
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:32,120
♫Not afraid of falling♫

913
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:37,490
♫Running to the world with you♫

914
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:41,700
♫The poem I'll continue to write♫

915
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:46,550
♫With your name in each line♫

916
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:49,100
♫If it started all over again♫

917
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:54,000
♫I'd still remember our love♫

918
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,760
♫It took♫

919
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,670
♫Hundreds of centuries♫

920
00:42:57,670 --> 00:43:01,560
♫For our love to begin♫

921
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:07,080
♫There's no way it'd end♫

922
00:43:18,110 --> 00:43:21,790
♫Those familiar eyes♫

923
00:43:21,790 --> 00:43:26,250
♫Lost the past when we shed tears♫

924
00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:28,770
♫It won't change♫

925
00:43:28,770 --> 00:43:31,340
♫Our fate of encounter♫

926
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:34,340
♫The poem I'll continue to write♫

927
00:43:34,650 --> 00:43:39,360
♫With your name in each line♫

928
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:41,870
♫If it started all over again♫

929
00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:46,830
♫I'd still remember our love♫

930
00:43:46,970 --> 00:43:48,670
♫It took♫

931
00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:50,580
♫Hundreds of centuries♫

932
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:54,270
♫For our love to begin♫

933
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:57,630
♫There's no way it'd end♫

934
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:59,150
♫When our story became history♫

935
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:01,040
♫In another world♫

936
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:02,870
♫There are another♫

937
00:44:02,870 --> 00:44:05,060
♫Pair of longing eyes♫

938
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:07,300
♫Have been waiting♫

939
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:13,800
♫For that everlasting romance♫

940
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:16,690
♫The poem I'll continue to write♫

941

♫With your name in each line♫

942
00:44:21,790 --> 00:44:24,470
♫If it started all over again♫

943
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:25,060
No need to turn the temperature up so much,

944
00:44:24,470 --> 00:44:29,160
♫I'd still remember our love♫

945
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:27,500
you'll sweat later.

946
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:30,790
♫It took♫

947
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:32,880
♫Hundreds of centuries♫

948
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:36,790
♫For our love to begin♫
