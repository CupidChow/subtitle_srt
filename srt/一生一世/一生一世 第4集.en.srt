4
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,440
Sis, you can't fall asleep?

5
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,680
I can't.

6
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,060
But I can't stay awake either.

7
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:11,720
I get it.

8
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,440
You're meeting his parents tomorrow.

9
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,840
I'm sure you can't sleep.

10
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,600
Keep your voice down.

11
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,400
When I think about the fact that

12
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,920
I'm going to meet my future cousin-in-law,

13
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,120
I can't sleep either.

14
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,200
I told you to keep your voice down!

15
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,040
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

16
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,960
I think

17
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,440
older people are so old-fashioned.

18
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,600
You just met him and then got engaged.

19
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,800
How romantic is that!

20
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,170
Are there still such men nowadays?

21
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,920
Don't generalize them.

22
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:44,010
There are still good men out there.

23
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,120
Yeah, my future cousin-in-law.

24
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,360
You haven't even met him.

25
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,690
And you think he's good?

26
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,329
It's my intuition, my sixth sense.

27
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,090
You're still awake?

28
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,880
I bought a new phone.

29
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,320
You do need a phone.

30
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,280
Otherwise

31
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,800
she'll feel insecure

32
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,400
if she can't get a hold of you.

33
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,840
This is the only impulsive thing

34
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,640
I've ever done.

35
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,960
I'm really scared it won't end well

36
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,160
and somehow ruins her chances at meeting someone better.

37
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:36,720
I think

38
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,650
getting married needs impulsiveness

39
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,960
and a lot of it.

40
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,920
I also saw a girl

41
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,440
in Xi'an.

42
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,440
Even though I only saw her for a few seconds,

43
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,240
her face

44
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:54,880
had left a deep impression

45
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,880
in my mind.

46
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,940
I can't forget her.

47
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,200
If I could see her again,

48
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,600
I would probably propose to her immediately

49
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,480
as you did.

50
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,520
I hope you can meet her again.

51
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,040
How is that even possible?

52
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,200
If it's fate, you'll meet her again.

54

what's it like to be in love?

59
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,520
You've asked

60
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,120
the wrong person.

You little brat.

All you think about is this stuff, huh?

74
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,120
I was thinking

75
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,160
if I should tell him to bring gifts

Do you think he is stupid?

Even I know

79

you have to bring gifts when meeting someone's parents.

He doesn't think like us.

81

He lives a simple

82
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,410
and boring life.

83
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,240
All he does is working in his lab

84
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,500
and going to meetings.

85
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,760
He could even watch a TV series

86

for more than 70 times.

87

Oh, he does sound a bit weird now.

88
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,200
But giving him a reminder

89
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,120
would seem like I'm asking for gifts.

90
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,450
It seems like a bad idea.

Are you nearsighted?

Farsighted?

111

Isn't that presbyopia?

Uncle, Auntie.

134
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,560
Take a seat.

135
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,280
Yes, have a seat.

136
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,080
Sit, sit, sit.

137
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,330
My mother is not able to come

138
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,480
because of her health.

139
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,400
But she asked me

140
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,850
to bring these as a token of appreciation.

141
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,080
You're too generous.

142
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:17,400
Bringing all these expensive gifts for us.

143
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,360
It's all my mother's intention.

144
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,920
Sis, these look so pretty.

145
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,280
They don't look fake.

146
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:30,720
I didn't know

147
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,120
what girls like.

148
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,880
So I prepared this in advance.

149
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,080
Hope you will like it.

150
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,320
There is even something for me?

151
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,850
Thank you, cousin-in-law.

152
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,600
It looks so good!

153
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,120
I forgot to make some tea.

154
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:44,800
I'll go get some tea.

155
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,400
Go, go.

156
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,000
Go, go.

157
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,400
Chen.

158
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,040
I heard from Shi Yi that

159
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,240
you've just finished

160
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,640
your exchange in Xi'an.

161
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,400
That's right.

162
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,660
I got back not long ago.

163
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,160
I've been going back and forth

164
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,720
between Zhenjiang and Shanghai recently.

165
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,320
You came to Zhenjiang

166
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,100
for ancestor worship, right?

167
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,920
That was one of the reasons.

168
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,320
The other is about the investment meeting.

169
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,560
The research you're working on

170
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,220
has something to do with this?

171
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,360
My family is the organizer

172
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,200
of this investment meeting.

173
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,440
That's right.

174
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,800
This invitation has the character Zhou printed on it.

00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,720
I didn't expect it to be your family.

176
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,200
Yes.

177
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,240
Great.

178
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,640
Great news!

179
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,360
It will benefit the people here

180
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,560
to attract investment.

181
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,620
It's a great thing!

182
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,880
I need to have a good talk with you today.

183
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,760
All right, stop it.

184
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,440
He came all the way here today to visit

185
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,200
Shi Yi's parents.

186
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,800
Talk about your business later.

187
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,040
Right.

188
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,760
This is not the business today.

189
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,960
Today it's for something else.

190
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,420
But I really didn't expect

191
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,560
the organizer and us

192
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,160
to be one family.

193
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,760
Yes, we'll be one family.

194
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,520
Here.

195
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,680
Have some tea.

196
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,720
Thank you, Uncle.

197
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,580
They have prepared such generous gifts.

198
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,920
I feel like it would look bad on us

199
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,240
to have lunch at home.

200
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,800
What does he like to eat?

201
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,960
I'll order some food.

202
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,420
We won't be eating at home.

203
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,810
His mother wants to invite me to lunch.

204
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,080
I see.

205
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,160
It's rare for you to come to Zhenjiang.

206
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,400
It's good to visit his home.

207
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,000
Am I right?

208
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,600
Let's go then.

209
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,840
I'm really sorry

210
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:45,880
for not being able to stay

211
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,160
for lunch today.

212
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,380
Look at you.

213
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,400
You've said you're sorry

214
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,600
for a dozen times.

215
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,960
My family

216
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,560
is quite casual about these things.

217
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,160
It's okay.

218
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,200
Shi Yi

219
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,680
rarely comes to Zhenjiang.

220
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,240
So it would be good for her to visit your mother.

221
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,100
How about this?

222
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,480
When you're in Shanghai,

223
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,240
come to our home for a meal, okay?

224
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:08,760
Okay.

225
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:09,980
You two can go then.

226
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,360
Wait for me.

227
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,520
I'll change into something formal.

228
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:18,890
Come with me.

229
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,490
Looks like Shi Yi really likes him.

230
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,360
It seems they have a good relationship.

231
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,080
I think so too.

232
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,960
What does your mother usually prefer

233
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,120
girls to wear?

234
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,120
You can wear anything.

235
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,200
No need to be so deliberate.

236
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,200
I can't be casual.

237
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,610
I have to respect her on our first meeting.

238
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,120
You've dressed yourself up

239
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,200
to meet my parents.

240
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,600
How can I not do the same for your mother?

241
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,120
Last night I had someone

242
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,560
prepare a few Qipao dresses for you.

243
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,320
They're all the styles

244
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,980
my family would usually wear.

245
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,480
If you don't mind,

246
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,160
I can ask the tailors to come upstairs.

247
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,360
They're downstairs.

248
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:02,880
Okay.

249
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,160
There was very little time

250
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,160
so we haven't had time to iron the dresses.

251
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,800
What if there's no time constraint?

252
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,720
Sewing accounts for 30% while ironing accounts for 70%.

253
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,960
Old people stress this,

254
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,920
especially his mother.

255
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,850
She's very particular about this.

256
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,160
Miss Shi Yi.

257
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,640
Look at these jewels.

258
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,090
Which one do you prefer?

259
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,640
Okay, the Qipao is ready.

260
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,130
What's the problem?

261
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,160
You have to go out.

262
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,520
I need to get changed.

263
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,680
Sorry.

264
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,280
Chen.

265
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,320
Actually, I'm also a businessman.

266
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:02,760
But

267
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,520
the economy in the past two years

268
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,780
hasn't been very good.

269
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,000
Oh my.

270
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,940
She looks so different

271
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,010
wearing a Qipao.

272
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,240
Yeah.

273
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,290
Miss Shi Yi, would you like some water?

274
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,410
No, I'm not thirsty.

275
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,240
Uncle Lin, you don't have to be so polite.

276
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:36,960
I should be.

277
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,800
When you came to work in Zhenjiang,

278
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,760
I thought Uncle Lin

279
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,290
was your temporary driver.

280
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,100
For you.

281
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:01,360
What is it?

282
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,760
Open it.

283
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,480
Isn't this for children?

284
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,040
My family

285
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,400
prepared this.

286
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,400
They asked me to give it to

287
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,640
my future wife.

288
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,220
It's engraved with my birth date.

289
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:20,060
[Xinmo   Gengzi   Jisi    Gengwu]

290
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,040
The birth date of Zhousheng Chen.

291
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,240
That's precious.

292
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,880
I have one too.

293
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,720
I'll ask my mother to find it.

294
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,920
But the one I have is only for collection.

295
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,840
It can't be worn.

296
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,720
Miss Shi Yi.

297
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,840
Even if your hundred-year-old lock can be worn,

298
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,400
it doesn't seem right

299
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,720
to let a man who's almost 30 years old

300
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,960
wear it.

301
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,400
I didn't mean for him to wear it.

302
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,660
I just want to give it to him as a souvenir.

303
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,440
Uncle Lin is joking with you.

304
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,480
It didn't sound like a joke.

305
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,680
He didn't even smile.

306
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,720
He's like this sometimes.

307
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,410
Let's chat a little.

308
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:14,560
Okay.

309
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,600
What does your family do?

310
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,240
Well.

311
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,240
It's complicated.

312
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:26,040
Our family was in manufacturing in the beginning.

313
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,480
Now we mainly focus on investments.

314
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,000
The invitation letters for the investment meeting

315
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,400
only had the character Zhou on it.

316
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,730
Why is it not Zhousheng?

317
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,800
There is a tradition in our family.

318
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,320
Only the eldest son's last name is Zhousheng.

319
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,580
What about the others?

320
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,300
The others' last name is Zhou.

321
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,440
In other words,

322
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,280
you are the only one in your family whose last name is Zhousheng

323
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:52,410
while all your younger brothers have the last name Zhou?

324
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,730
That's about right.

325
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,680
Why is that?

326
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,760
There are exceptions.

327
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,400
You will find out

328
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,730
when you meet my family.

329
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,400
Okay.

330
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,319
So are we going to start living together

331
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,280
after we meet your mother?

332
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,440
I don't think so.

333
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,560
I'm not asking this

334
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,490
because I want to live with you.

335
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,840
I've never gotten engaged.

336
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,640
So I'm not sure

337
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,370
about what you have in mind.

338
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,480
I think...

339
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,760
I think

340
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,680
we don't have to

341
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,880
change or disrupt

342
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,160
anything else in our lives

343
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,480
except for the engagement.

344
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,280
It's just like my research.

345
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,520
We'll decide on a research topic

346
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,440
before conducting experiments.

347
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,280
By doing so,

348
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,850
it would be a reasonable

Well, research topic.

You don't have to

353
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,680
be stressed out about this.

354
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,960
I should warn you

355
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,400
about my mother.

356
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,800
She may treat you

357
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,120
coldly.

358
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,330
It's not because of you.

359
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,520
It's because of me.

360
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,160
You two had a fight?

361
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,280
Sort of.

362
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,640
Is there anything I should avoid?

363
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,480
Or is there anything

364
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,680
to watch out for?

365
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,120
Nothing.

366
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,480
Okay.

367
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,000
I have one more question.

368
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,240
You have my family information?

369
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:27,850
Yes, I do.

370
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,490
Why do you have that?

371
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,570
My family wanted to know about you.

372
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:34,560
Because

373
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,850
our encounter was rather special.

374
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,020
Were they afraid that I'd be a bad person?

375
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,040
But

376
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,600
I was really surprised at myself

377
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,360
that day for stopping you.

378
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,450

Hello.

Do all the people around you all have the last name Lin?

382
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,280
He's my nephew.

383
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,680
No wonder.

384
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,780
Where are they?

Go on!

Look at them.

389
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,560
You should hurry!

390
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,330
You've lived here since you were a kid?

391
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,440
Only for a few years.

392
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,480

This is Shi Yi.

Hello, Auntie.

401

Hello, Miss Shi.

402
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,720
Have you had lunch yet?

403
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,080
I haven't.

404
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,440
It's the Qingming Festival these days

and typically cold foods are served.

406

Cooking with fire is forbidden during this period.

Okay. Thank you, Auntie.

There's no need to go out.

413

It's a little loose.

But it won't fall off.

I'll do some research on my own then.

you wouldn't be this sad

about my mother's attitude.

00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:39,800
I thought

452
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,320
you wouldn't be

00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,080
when all the preparations she had done these ten years

462
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,840
were all pointless

463

in the end.

No wonder what?

466
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,240
The way she looked at me

467
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,080
made me think I had said something

468
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,600
or did something rude.

00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,280
If you're here,

521
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,360
we can have a reason to come out

522
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,490
for something nice.

523
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,280
I'm not staying for long this time.

524
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,210
Maybe next time.

525
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,700
I've been scared to sleep these two days.

526
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,400
Miss Shi Yi.

527
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,000
Would you be afraid

528
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,420
to stay at an old house?

529
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,410
I think I'll be fine.

530
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,040
If I were you,

531
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,280
I'd get out of that place

532
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,280
with your pregnancy as an excuse.

533
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,680
I already didn't go to ancestor worship rituals

534
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,680
because of that.

535
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,240
I'm afraid I'll get a lecture from my parents

536
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,640
if I don't live there.

537
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,880
Good thing it's only once every four years.

538
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,760
Otherwise, if I had to live in that place all the time,

539
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,080
I'd go crazy.

540
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,040
By the way,

541
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,560
where would you

542
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,240
be stationed this time?

543
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,360
Xi'an?

544
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,900
I haven't decided yet.

545
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,320
If you're working here,

546
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,320
are you going to move your house

547
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,120
here?

548
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,920
Shi Yi works in Shanghai.

549
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,960
It's not convenient for her to go to Xi'an with me.

550
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:41,840
Maybe

551
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,080
I'll end up going back and forth

552
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,410
between the two places.

553
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,360
Living apart affects your relationship.

554
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,760
You need to hold him tight and not let him go.

555
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,560
Couples need to live under the same roof

556
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,020
to be considered a couple.

557
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,200
Yes.

558
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,080
If you had a child later on,

559
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,360
would you leave Shi Yi with the responsibility of taking care of the child?

560
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,200
Even if someone else can help with it,

561
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,840
the dad can't be absent.

562
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,360
We haven't thought that far.

563
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,020
People in the honeymoon phase

564
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,080
are blind to reality.

565
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:16,760
Chen.

566
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:17,920
You are a man.

567
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,140
You have to think about these things.

568
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:20,840
I know.

569
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,880
Someone sounds perfunctory.

570
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,810
I'm not being perfunctory.

571
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,530
I'm already thinking about it.

572
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,080
Do you come here often?

573
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,380
Not very often.

574
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,220
But my uncle

575
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:46,210
gets along the best with my father.

576
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,200
I see.

577
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,320
What?

578
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,360
I understand

579
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,220
what relationship they have now.

580
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,160
When are you leaving Zhenjiang?

581
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,930
The day after tomorrow.

582
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,440
I'll be gone for half a month after this.

583
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:07,640
When I return,

584
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:11,540
I'll go to your house to discuss the details of our engagement.

585
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,960
Don't you need to consider

586
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,450
your mother's opinion?

587
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,560
In this case,

588
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,960
only one woman's opinion

589
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,520
is worth taking into account.

590
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,380
And that's you.

591
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,220
But I'll have to face her later on.

592
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,440
It'll be fine.

593
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,560
There's one thing I want to ask you.

594
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,800
After I start working,

595
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,080
I might not

596
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,880
be able to answer all your calls.

597
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,000
So I'd like to

598
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,240
set a fixed time

599
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,240
when we can talk on the phone every day.

600
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,080
Every day?

601
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,330
All right, I can do that.

602
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,920
I'm relatively free

603
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:56,240
after I wake up,

604
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,480
before lunch and before I go to bed.

605
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,040
Okay.

606
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:01,640
Then let's call each other during these times.

607
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,880
Do you have any suggestions

608
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,080
on the specific time?

609
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,840
7 am, 11 am,

610
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,480
and 11:30 pm.

611
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,000
Okay.

612
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,440
7 am, 11 am,

613
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,520
and 11:30 pm.

614
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:18,880
I'm going in then.

615
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,290
Be careful on your way back.

616
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,960
Except for being made out of pure gold,

617
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,800
does it have other meanings?

618
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,440
It doesn't look like an antique.

619
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,080
I don't think it's anything special.

620
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:08,139
I think it's similar to the ones we had when we were kids.

621
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,040
This is much worse than the gifts

622
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,100
his mother gave us.

623
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,320
Is it possible that his mother is in charge of the finance

624
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,520
in their family

625
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:18,480
while he has no real power at all?

626
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:21,000
You sure are concerned.

627
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,199
A gold lock is simple.

628
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,080
I like it.

629
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,080
I'll give you mine if you like it.

630
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,159
I have a lot of them.

631
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,120
I got a dozen of them

632
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,600
when my relatives came to celebrate my one month after birth.

633
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,639
They're all in a drawer in my parents' bedroom.

634
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:34,040
I'll give them all to you.

635
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,929
Keep them for yourself.

636
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:45,179
[Xinmo   Gengzi   Jisi    Gengwu]

637
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,120
Your family is hosting the investment meeting,

638
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,560
but you had me give the speech.

639
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:00,840
I was so nervous.

640
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,160
If this is my profession,

641
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,560
I would have no problems.

642
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:05,760
But I still think you are right for

643
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,240
this kind of

644
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,880
business meeting.

645
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:10,640
Your speech just now

646
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,570
was pretty good.

647
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,730
Thanks, I guess, for the opportunity.

648
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,980
Did you contact Shi Yi?

649
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,520
Yes.

650
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,200
I made a phone call this morning

651
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,330
to say good morning.

652
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,480
And you'll call her again at night

653
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:34,720
to say good night.

654
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,760
There is one more at 11 am.

655
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:46,960
What's wrong?

656
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,320
Nothing.

657
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:50,480
As long as

658
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,200
your fiancee's fine with it,

659
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,560
I have no say in this.

660
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,040
I think I'm doing good.

661
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:57,760
She sounded like she was in a nice mood

662
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,560
on the phone.

663
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,000
She laughed twice.

664
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,080
Not bad.

665
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:16,500
Zhousheng Chen

666
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,380
came all the way here to see us off.

667
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,840
That's very thoughtful.

668
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,320
This kid does things by the book.

669
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,680
He doesn't seem arrogant or easily irritated.

670
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:26,410
He's definitely a researcher.

671
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,400
Let me ask you.

672
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,880
Don't you

673
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,200
guys get bored when you two are together?

674
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,160
Not at all.

675
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:35,720
Wouldn't it be too rigid to

676
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,040
have specific times to call each other?

677
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:38,720
On the contrary, I think

678
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:39,720
he's very serious about me.

679
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,680
Everything is nice as long as you like him, huh?

680
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:42,960
Uncle, auntie.

681
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,960
When I get back from my business trip,

682
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,000
I'll go to your home first

683
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,400
to pay you a formal visit.

684
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,520
Okay.

685
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,440
Work should still be your priority.

686
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,170
We are in Shanghai all the time.

687
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,400
You can come anytime.

688
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:55,530
Okay.

689
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,040
We're leaving then.

690
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:57,520
Okay.

691
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:58,560
Have a safe trip.

692
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,420
Okay. Goodbye.

693
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,240
I'll go then.

694
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:13,600
Remember to wear your seat belt,

695
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,000
even in the back seat.

696
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,120
Okay.

697
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,120
Bye, bye.

698
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:18,800
Bye.

699
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,640
What are you looking at?

700
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,400
They're already so far away.

701
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:40,800
Let's go.

702
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,560
The car is over there.

703
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,900
I've been back for an hour.

704
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,380
You didn't talk to me once.

705
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,120
You've been busy packing your things

706
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:02,600
and taking a shower.

707
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,930
You just got everything done, didn't you?

708
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,360
I want to talk to you about something.

709
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:18,640
What?

710
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,440
In Zhenjiang, me and Zhousheng Chen...

711
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:24,480
You met each other?

712
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,540
I knew the two of you

713
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,360
would meet up.

714
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,520
We did see each other.

715
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,680
Your relationship with him is developing well I see!

716
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,640
He asked you out or you asked him out?

717
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:34,500
He asked me out.

718
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:36,840
He got the hang of things now.

719
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:37,970
He's on the ball now.

720
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:38,960
Back in Xi'an,

721
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,290
he was still a naive boy.

722
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:42,960
See you later.

723
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:43,880
Am I right?

724
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,080
Go on.

725
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,520
What did you do on the date?

726
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,120
Watched a movie, had dinner?

727
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:53,760
You can't say?

728
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:56,960
Could it be that

729
00:38:58,720 --> 00:38:59,520
you guys had hugged?

730
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,440
No.

731
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,700
I knew things wouldn't go so fast.

732
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,920
Although I've only met Zhousheng Chen

733
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,200
a few times,

734
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,480
I can see that

735
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,280
he's a conservative person.

736
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,880
He proposed to me.

737
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:18,890
What did you say?

738
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,210
Say it again.

739
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,280
He proposed to me.

740
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,600
Why?

741
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,090
What do you mean why?

742
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,170
He wants to get married, of course.

743
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,440
You said yes?

744
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,800
I never thought

745
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,600
the only person around me

746
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,400
who would do a flash marriage is you.

747
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,860
I didn't expect myself to agree to it either.

748
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,600
But

749
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,400
it feels good.

750
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:01,880
I can tell.

751
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,040
You're glowing now.

752
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,320
Yeah right!

753
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:08,760
But

754
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,280
isn't he working in Germany?

755
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,200
What are you going to do

756
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:11,840
after you two get married?

757
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:12,960
Long-distance?

758
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,640
He had planned to come back long ago.

759
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:16,720
He went to Xi'an

760
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:17,480
because he had to help set up

761
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,640
the new lab.

762
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:21,160
He handed in his resignation letter a few days ago.

763
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,840
I think it will be a few more months

764
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,170
before he can come back.

765
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,120
This is so much information.

766
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,800
Let me process it first.

767
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:48,700
[Recording Studio]

768
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,440
Mother, I know

769
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,400
you wanted to give your life

770
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,490
in exchange for my life.

771
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,360
But I can't escape.

772
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:18,120
I can't let you die for me.

773
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,880
And I can't involve

774

the thousands of people in Qinghe.

775
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:34,560
Ever since I entered the royal mansion,

776
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,680
Master has taught me many things

777
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,520
and my peers loved me.

778
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:47,440
I've never been able to return the favor.

779
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:53,200
Today, Master died of injustice.

780
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:55,440
My peers were cruelly slaughtered.

781
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,760
My enemies are close to me

782
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:57,640
yet I can't kill them.

783
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,120
It's already a great pain.

784
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,600
There is no way I would marry him.

785
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,960
I'm sorry for letting you down, Mother.

786
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:26,400
Thank you for raising me.

787
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,180
Mother, please allow me to

788
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,160
renounce my last name

789
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,610
and to be removed from the family book.

790
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:50,960
From now on,

791
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:56,880
there won't be an unfilial daughter in the Cui family.

Thank you.

795
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,600
There are too many crying scenes in this drama.

Miss Shi.

797
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,440
A person who claimed to be your family

798
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,570
has ordered dinner for the whole crew.

799
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:42,240
I didn't know he ordered food for us.

800
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,080
Now that it's arrived, let's eat together.

This was specially ordered, right?

806
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:02,380
It's all restaurant food.

807
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:03,480
And by the looks of it,

808
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:04,640
it's not from some nearby restaurant.

809

Do we know him?

so that we can assess him.
