[Episode 16]

4
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,460
When I was a child, I memorized "Master Lu's Spring and Autumn Annals".

5
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:51,180
The elders in the family would say

6
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,259
"Beauties and

7
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,259
demoralizing music.

8
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:56,780
Don't enjoy yourself in them."

9
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,500
Beauty and pleasant music

10
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:00,980
are not worth indulging in.

11
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,620
Have you heard this?

12
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:07,860
At that time,

13
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,539
I thought they

14
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,340
were not worth indulging in.

15
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,460
But now,

16
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,580
I don't think so anymore.

17
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:19,980
Suddenly you're a smooth talker.

18
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,180
It's true that somethings

19
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,900
you don't need a teacher to learn about.

20
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:29,100
Xiaoyu asked us

21
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:30,780
to go see her when we're free.

22
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,420
What do you mean by "when we're free"?

23
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:42,620
Right.

24
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:45,020
A friend from the institute

25
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:45,940
told me

26
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,220
a man and woman had to show their marriage certificates

27
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,460
to stay together in a hotel.

28
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,300
Is that still the case?

29
00:02:55,579 --> 00:02:56,940
I don't know.

30
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:59,380
I always stayed with girls on business trips.

31
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:04,620
And I never stayed with a woman.

32
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,420
I didn't bring our marriage certificates.

33
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,460
I brought a photo though.

34
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:15,980
A photo?

[Marriage certificate]

36
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,820
When was this taken?

37
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,940
The day I picked up our certificates.

38
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:32,940
Why did you take it?

39
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,820
To treasure that moment.

40
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:40,020
It's not like I wouldn't give you the original.

41
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:42,460
It's a big risk to

42
00:03:42,579 --> 00:03:44,220
bring around the original document.

43
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,020
It's safer this way.

44
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,220
If you lose your phone,

45
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,700
wouldn't our information be leaked too?

46
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:54,180
I've put a lock on this photo.

47
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,460
It can't be opened without a password.

48
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:59,700
That's very thoughtful of you.

49
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:02,820
It's a habit of mine.

50
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,340
Where's Mr. Zhousheng?

51
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:30,740
He's not here.

52
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,500
Are these

53
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,260
going to be sent back to China?

54
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:42,340
Yes, someone will come by tonight

55
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,500
and deliver the stuff.

56
00:04:49,659 --> 00:04:50,940
Has he moved everything?

57
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:52,659
Yes.

58
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,460
He said

59
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:55,740
he's going back for good this time.

60
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,220
He asked us to clean it up.

61
00:05:35,659 --> 00:05:37,300
After nine years of living here,

62
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,820
he just left this place

63
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,380
without feeling anything.

64
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:00,940
Not bad.

65
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:02,260
We'll go back tonight.

66
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,460
I can eat whatever you want. Tonight.

67
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:04,300
Okay.

68
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:04,660
Okay.

69
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:05,180
Great.

70
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:06,500
Okay.

71
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:07,180
Sure.

72
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:08,940
The food here should be nice.

73
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:11,500
I thought you guys were

74
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:12,620
trapped somewhere.

75
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:13,780
You're back so early.

76
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:14,780
I came back early.

77
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:16,300
Lucky you.

78
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,260
We were taking shelter by the shore

79
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:17,900
until now.

80
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:21,380
I didn't have the chance to ask in the afternoon.

81
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,660
Meilin didn't make it clear either.

82
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:23,900
Shouldn't you formally

83
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,380
introduce your husband to us?

84
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,540
You guys are Shi Yi's colleagues.

85
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:29,780
As long as you know

86
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:30,740
I'm Shi Yi's husband,

87
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:31,580
that's enough.

88
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:33,460
Did you hear that?

89
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,860
This is Shi Yi's man.

90
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:38,820
We're going

91
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:39,940
back to Shanghai tonight.

92
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:40,980
What is your plan?

93
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,700
Are you going back with us

94
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,580
or are you going to stay with your husband?

95
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,940
It's the weekend. We'll stay one more night.

96
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:48,900
Okay.

97
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:50,740
Then I'll leave your wife

98
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:51,340
to you.

99
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,020
Thank you for giving me this opportunity.

100
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:54,820
I'll leave you two alone.

101
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:55,220
I'm going.

102
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:55,860
Bye, bye.

103
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:56,260
Bye, bye.

104
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:57,020
Bye, bye.

105
00:06:59,260 --> 00:06:59,580
Bye, bye.

106
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:00,980
Bye, bye.

107
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,340
-Finally, we're back.
-Let's go.

108
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,020
Do you check whether the door is locked

109
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,180
every time you go out?

110
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,140
I guess it's a habit.

111
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,580
There are many people here.

112
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,820
There weren't many people just now?

113
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:37,500
You came back on your own?

114
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:41,180
In fact, except for going home,

115
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,300
I am usually alone

116
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,380
when I go out.

117
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:46,300
Your lawyer seems to be better than you in this aspect.

118
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:48,020
At least he has a few assistants.

119
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,460
I also have assistants in the lab.

120
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,780
But outside of the lab,

121
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,020
I really don't know

122
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,580
what an assistant can do.

123
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,260
He can't help me eat.

124
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:00,660
He can't help me drink water.

125
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,180
He can't help me sleep.

126
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:08,300
What?

127
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,660
I'm trying to figure out

128
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:11,940
the similarities between you and normal people.

129
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,420
I can't think of many.

130
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:14,980
Even watching a drama,

131
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:16,780
your methods would be strange.

132
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:18,060
Few people can

133
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,380
watch "Qin Quest"

134
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,500
for 79 times.

135
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,180
I only do that during my leisure time.

136
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,100
I really don't want to waste

137
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,140
too much energy

138
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,820
on looking for a new TV series.

139
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:30,380
So I just keep watching it.

140
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,580
Every time I see

141
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:33,860
the last scene,

142
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:34,780
I know

143
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,419
what the next scene is going to be

144
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:37,740
and what the next lines will be.

145
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:39,700
It's interesting.

146
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,020
Maybe only you

147
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:43,020
find it interesting.

148
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,140
Maybe.

149
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:52,780
Watch out, the road is uneven.

150
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:53,780
And you're wearing high heels.

151
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:54,900
It's easy to trip and fall.

152
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:56,540
I know.

153
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,220
I'll hold your hand.

154
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,540
Why didn't I notice

155
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:11,700
he's so freaking cute.

156
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:22,620
Thank you for waiting.

157
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:25,860
Let me make the introductions.

158
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:27,580
This is Shi Yi's husband.

159
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,460
Professor Zhousheng Chen.

160
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:32,820
This is Du Feng, my friend.

161
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:34,260
Hi.

162
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:34,860
Hi.

163
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,180
What's this?

164
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:41,140
A liquor made by the locals. Smells good.

165
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,700
Sorry, I don't drink.

166
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,220
As a man

167
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,220
you have to at least drink some, right?

168
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:49,860
It's just a gesture of friendliness.

169
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,260
Don't force him to drink.

170
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,260
I didn't force him.

171
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,100
I merely urged him to.

172
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,420
I merely urged him to, my lady.

173
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,580
It's a strong liquor.

174
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:01,940
You're protecting him.

175
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,180
That's a no no.

176
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:05,900
Professor.

177
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,820
This is our first time drinking, right?

178
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:09,060
Yes.

179
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,620
Are you not gonna give me face then?

180
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:13,580
Let's do as we please.

181
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,340
I'll drink for him.

182
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:27,060
She's the one who doesn't drink at all.

183
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:30,780
That's true love.

184
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:32,300
Absolutely true love.

185
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:33,620
They're married.

186
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:34,540
How can it not be true love?

187
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:35,900
True.

188
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,460
After all, they are a family now.

189
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:40,660
I'm the outsider.

190
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:43,220
Whatever, let's eat.

191
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,340
Eat.

192
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,260
Don't drink on my behalf in the future.

193
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:54,860
I'm willing to.

194
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,540
You're strange.

195
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:35,300
You're neither leaving nor looking for them.

196
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,820
I don't want to bother them.

197
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,140
I don't want to go back either.

198
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:42,940
In this family,

199
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:43,780
I like Chen and Shi Yi

200
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,340
the most.

201
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,860
I always look forward to their return.

202
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,020
But I also don't want them to come back.

203
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,460
Chen doesn't fit in there.

204
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:56,500
Do you want one?

205
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,020
To relieve your sorrows.

206
00:11:58,580 --> 00:11:59,460
Childish.

207
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:03,460
I'll eat it later.

208
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:08,540
Let's go home!

209
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,500
Is Mr. Zhousheng from Zhenjiang?

210
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:23,980
Yes.

211
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:26,700
Just now, Xiaoyu said

212
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:28,260
you're a researcher, right?

213
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,220
A researcher that works in a lab.

214
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:33,500
And you?

215
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,500
You never said what you do.

216
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,100
I'm a civil servant.

217
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:41,420
Professor.

218
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,820
Here's your wife.

219
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:44,980
My gosh.

220
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:46,340
I'm telling you.

221
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,260
She really can't drink.

222
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:48,940
I don't care if she's going to act wild later on.

223
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,620
I'll get my last box of clothes

224
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:52,700
after I go back tonight.

225
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:53,620
From now on,

226
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:54,620
you guys can have fun there.

227
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,060
What's the hurry?

228
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,180
Why not?

229
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:58,620
Your husband is finally back.

230
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,180
You should quickly live a normal life.

231
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:02,460
We got to work. I'm going.

232
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:03,700
-Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye.

233
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,460
Bye.

234
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:10,060
Are you drunk?

235
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,380
No, I'm sober.

236
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:14,740
Try walking on your own.

237
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:15,940
All right.

238
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:20,940
Don't sway.

239
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,700
This place is quite interesting.

240
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,300
Now that we're leaving,

241
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,620
I'm really sad to leave.

242
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:33,740
Didn't you come here before?

243
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:37,500
Yes, I was here for work last time.

244
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:38,700
I didn't have much fun.

245
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,260
You just said you were moving out, right?

246
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:42,780
That's right.

247
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:43,980
Her husband is back.

248
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:45,660
I should move out.

249
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:48,260
Have you found a place to live?

250
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:50,780
I bought a house before New Year.

251
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,140
Where is it?

252
00:13:58,860 --> 00:13:59,860
Why are you asking so much?

253
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:02,340
I'm concerned about you.

254
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:11,660
It's in another district.

255
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:13,180
Not close to you.

256
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,900
We won't be running into each other anytime soon.

257
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:25,580
But you can always contact me.

258
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,540
It's not like I've left Shanghai.

259
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:29,060
Right?

260
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,060
True.

261
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,020
I feel a little dizzy.

262
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,820
I'd like to sit down for a while.

263
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:53,700
You want to stay here for a while?

264
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:07,700
Let's cover your legs up.

265
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:18,180
Do you want to lie on my lap?

266
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:21,060
Okay.

267
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:34,340
Get closer. I can't see.

268
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:36,820
What do you want to see?

269
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,260
You.

270
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:43,420
Just look at me like that.

271
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,900
I'm already very close to you.

272
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:58,780
Your facial hair is growing again.

273
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,540
Did it prick you just now?

274
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:07,260
I'm not going to talk to you about this.

275
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:24,540
This is also a lesson from God.

276
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:31,260
He has taught me to withdraw hatred and avoid coquetry.

277
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:35,380
And to change my nature.

278
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:40,580
Stop loving the past and withdraw from the sea of suffering

279
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:42,900
to realize the causes.

280
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,460
What are you laughing at?

281
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:52,500
Do you know what this play is about?

282
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,180
It's about a woman

283
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:58,580
lamenting that her glory is fleeting.

284
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:01,060
And that people should realize early that life is impermanent.

285
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:03,380
So you think

286
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:04,740
I'm lamenting this too?

287
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:10,099
You're wrong.

288
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,500
Zhousheng Chen.

289
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,540
You're wrong about what I'm going to say.

290
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:20,020
I know you don't like doing business,

291
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:23,500
and only like the people and things in the laboratory.

292
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,740
So what I want to say is,

293
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,180
since life is unpredictable,

294
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,420
don't put it off any longer.

295
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,300
When you're done with what you have to do,

296
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:36,940
just drop everything here.

297
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,260
From then on, you just need to

298
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:41,980
research your favourite planet, Venus.

299
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:44,540
Leave the rest to me.

300
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:51,740
I'll make you tea and cook for you.

301
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:54,140
I'll take good care of you.

302
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,660
From now on, I will be there every day.

303
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,580
I'll be your support.

304
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,380
Your closest family.

305
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,700
Since you don't like Zhenjiang,

306
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,540
we will live in Shanghai.

307
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,140
Shanghai will be our home.

308
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:23,660
I mean it.

309
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:25,540
Drunk people tell the truth.

310
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,540
Look at you.

311
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,180
Your face is all flushed.

312
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:36,500
Really?

313
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:38,460
I can't drink.

314
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:39,820
I get drunk when I drink.

315
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:42,700
But you look pretty

316
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,300
when your face is flushed.

317
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:50,740
Really.

318
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:00,980
I'm dizzy.

319
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,100
If you don't feel well,

320
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,980
should we go to our room and rest?

321
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:10,660
I'm even dizzier if I walk now.

322
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,980
I want to just hold you and lie down for a while.

323
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:36,740
Why are we here?

324
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:38,500
Are you

325
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,900
interested in Yuan?

326
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:42,180
Don't talk nonsense. I have my own plan.

327
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:47,060
Why did you come see me?

328
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,260
You failed your exams?

329
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:49,340
Do I look like

330
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,660
someone with bad grades?

331
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,660
Even a horse stumbles.

332
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,100
Come, I'll take you for milk tea.

333
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:54,980
Get in the car.

334
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:56,020
Where to?

335
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:57,420
I need to buy tea for my grandpa.

336
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:58,420
I can't go too far.

337
00:19:58,540 --> 00:19:59,580
I'll take you there.

338
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,340
What's wrong with him?

339
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,340
Sorry, Yuan.

340
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,380
He doesn't want to go home.

341
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,820
But he has no other friends.

342
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,020
So he came to bother you.

343
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,300
It's okay. I'm older than him.

344
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:11,660

00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,790
Shi Yi, we're leaving.

517
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:37,660
By the way, could you hold the umbrella closer to her?

518
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:38,750
I don't want her to get wet.

519
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:39,570
Don't worry about me.

520
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:40,180
Okay.

521
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,000
Thank you.

522
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,100
Young man.

523
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:47,860
You treat your girlfriend well.

524
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,220
I'm all dirty.

525
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:32,700
Have you talked to Tong Jiaren

526
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:34,260
this month?

527
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:37,460
Yes.

528
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:42,460
It's all about work.

529
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:46,140
Excuses.

530
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:48,940
It's not.

531
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:59,020
So, have you two ever…?

532
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:00,340
No.

533
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:04,460
You know what I'm asking?

534
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:06,740
I know.

535
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:11,820
Nothing in the future too.

536
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,500
There won't be any.

537
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:18,620
Not with anyone.

538
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,580
Not with anyone.

539
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,820
If I pass away first,

540
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:47,020
then stay single.

541
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,740
I'll make it up to you in my next life.

542
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:54,860
Make up with what?

543
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,460
To be your wife, of course.

544
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,620
If you do well in the next life,

545
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:01,820
I'll reward you in your next, next life.

546
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:15,340
I know you are materialistic.

547
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:17,020
You don't want to promise me.

548
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:23,900
I promise you.

549
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:28,900
Say it again.

550
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:31,630
I promise you.

551
00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:34,290

♫Give you my insignificant♫

559
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,480

♫All and all♫

561
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:10,820

00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:16,100
Turn off the light.

Do you still have the pomegranates you bought last time?

578
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:54,940
I want to eat some.

590
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:44,700
Good morning!

591
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:46,500
Excuse me.

592
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:48,660
Do you know a place nearby

593
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:49,620
that sells pomegranates?

594
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:51,060
It's too early.

595
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:52,740
It might not be available.

596
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:54,340
But,

597
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:55,970
there may be some

598
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:56,920
in those supermarkets

599
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:57,790
that's always open.

600
00:36:58,010 --> 00:36:59,060
You could go there and check it out.

601
00:37:00,490 --> 00:37:02,220
Do you have a car?

602
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:04,430
If only you came sooner.

603
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:05,520
My wife just

604
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,300
took the car.

605
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:10,140
But I have another one.

606
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:12,420
You have to be patient

607
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,900
to take out the flesh.

608
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:15,780
Yes.

609
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:16,950
When I was a kid,

610
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:17,980
I rarely ate it

611
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:18,940
because it was troublesome to peel.

612
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:21,620
Luckily, when my wife was pregnant,

613
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:23,100
she liked durian

614
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:24,380
instead of pomegranates.

615
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:29,380
Take your time, be patient.

616
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:38,460
Where have you been?

617
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:39,540
I've packed the stuff.

618
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:40,580
We can go home anytime.

619
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:47,100
Pomegranates?

620
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:48,460
There's a pomegranate vendor here?

621
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:50,100
I came across someone selling it.

622
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:57,300
I've loved pomegranates since I was a kid.

623
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,260
Just that they are too troublesome to peel.

624
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:05,780
That's right.

625
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:07,060
Did you bring back all the stuff

626
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:08,180
from Bremen?

627
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:09,740
Yes.

628
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:10,860
Where did you send it to?

629
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:13,420
Your house or mine?

630
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:15,140
The institute's dormitory.

631
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:19,500
The bachelor apartment?

632
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:22,940
You're occupying a bachelor's apartment as a married man.

633
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:24,580
Is the institute fine with that?

634
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:27,740
You're already married.

635
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,340
It's not a good idea to take up their place, right?

636
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:34,860
When the luggage is delivered to China,

637
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:37,020
I'll have them send it to the home.

638
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:39,140
Which home?

639
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:41,540
Our home.

640
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:43,340
Good boy.

641
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:49,820
It's so sweet.

642
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:58,580
Come on in.

643
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:04,180
These are slippers for you.

644
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:18,380
I've turned Xiaoyu's room

645
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:19,980
into a study room.

646
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:22,860
Okay.

647
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:25,020
Where are you going?

648
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:27,340
Didn't we agree

649
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,540
I'd sleep in the study when I got back?

650
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:34,860
Oh no, I forgot.

651
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:36,620
I forgot to buy a bed for you.

652
00:40:42,050 --> 00:40:43,140
I'll sleep here then.

653
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:44,500
Okay.

654
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:45,580
Then I'll get you

655
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:46,820
a quilt and a pillow tonight.

656
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:47,700
Okay.

657
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,180
I'll put the stuff in first.

658
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:12,780
Even if you want to sleep on the couch,

659
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,860
you can't just leave your things unpacked, right?

660
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:17,620
I have too many things.

661
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:19,260
I'll do the cleaning

662
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:20,220
on my own

663
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:21,500
after you're done unpacking.

664
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:23,300
You won't be able to do it yourself.

665
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:24,780
Only I know

666
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:26,020
what goes where.

667
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:43,780
That's all?

668
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:47,620
I have some clothes on the way.

669
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:48,460
They'll be here in a couple of days.

670
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:50,820
Okay, I'll help you put the clothes

671
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:51,940
in the closet first.

672
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:52,570
I've made space

673
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:53,300
on the left of the closet

674
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:54,300
for your clothes.

675
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:55,460
The right side is for me.

676
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:57,180
You can put these books in the study.

677
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:58,660
I've made space for your stuff too.

678
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:28,060
You have more books coming?

679
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:28,900
Yes.

680
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:31,740
Are these shelves enough?

681
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:33,260
If not, I'll make some more space for you.

682
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:37,500
Should be enough.

683
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:41,900
Do you usually

684
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:43,340
turn these two computers on together?

685
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:44,340
Yes.

686
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,380
Then there aren't enough sockets.

687
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:48,340
I'll go to the supermarket downstairs later

688
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:49,540
and buy a bigger one.

689
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:52,100
The supermarket downstairs?

690
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:55,100
Otherwise there will be no place to plug in the lamp.

691
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:57,910
Okay, I got it.

692
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:15,320
Wait.

693
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:17,660
What's wrong?

694
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:18,700
Let's get down to business first.
