00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:03,980
I appreciate it.

174
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,860
Uncle, Mother.

175
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:23,500
Wenchuan,

176
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:25,380
Mei Xing says Chen has been locked

177
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:26,460
in a small factory

178
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:27,940
for three hours already

179
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,870
and no one is there to open the door.

180
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:35,070
I will check it out.

181
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:52,280
Wenchuan.

182
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,220
Wenchuan.

183
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:58,530
You are not well,

184
00:12:58,530 --> 00:12:59,660
why did you come out?

185
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,260
There's something

186
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,960
I shouldn't speak in front of our mother.

187
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,260
Mei Xing says that

188
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,420
Uncle Zhao asked you about this.

189
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:09,860
You said you would go

190
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:12,550
and told everyone to leave this to you.

191
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,460
That's not what happened!

192
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:18,820
What I told Uncle Zhao was

193
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:19,780
no matter who locked the door,

194
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:21,510
the priority is to get Chen out.

195
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:24,220
I suppose gossip

196
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,680
is a sure way of twisting people's words.

197
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:28,690
Anything else?

198
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,900
I will go pick him up then.

199
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:32,910
Come back soon.

200
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:53,060
[Reception Office]

201
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:12,390
You're here as well, Mr. Mei.

202
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:34,210
Before you returned,

203
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:35,760
they would come to me every now and then.

204
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,820
At first, I thought

205
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:38,040
they were father's old friends,

206
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,100
so I tried to help them as much as I can.

207
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:41,500
Until I finally realized

208
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,160
I couldn't handle them at all.

209
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:44,500
They must be

210
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,300
ill-treating you since you just came back

211
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,660
and had little idea of what's going on.

212
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,900
Perhaps they thought you were more gullible than I was.

213
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:51,580
In fact, they just want your money.

214
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:54,310
They want you to invest in them endlessly.

215
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:57,740
What's that?

216
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,180
Water sample.

217
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:05,780
Scientists always do things differently.

218
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:08,380
Here's my advice.

219
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,680
The crueler you are, the less trouble you will have.

220
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,020
I have to go now.

221
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,470
Actually,

222
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,260
your younger brother

223
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,620
is more suitable to do business than you.

224
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:44,550
Unfortunately,

225
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:48,180
his mind is evil.

226
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,230
Come in.

227
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,560
Xiaoyu is still in bed.

228
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:20,470
A girl who has never been in a relationship

229
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,340
sure has all the energy in the world

230
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:23,800
when she gets a boyfriend.

231
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:25,620
Don't mind me.

232
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:27,630
Enjoy your time.

233
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,120
I take my leave.

234
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:40,960
Take a seat.

235
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:43,280
Did you drive back on your own?

236
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:44,620
Yeah.

237
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:45,900
It's so dangerous to drive at night.

238
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,160
Don't do that anymore.

239
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:48,820
There wasn't anything urgent anyway.

240
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:49,340
Okay.

241
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,000
Take a seat.

242
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:56,260
I am sorry.

243
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:00,200
Have a seat.

244
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:06,660
I promised

245
00:17:06,819 --> 00:17:08,819
to take you to see the wedding house.

246
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:10,740
The house won't run away,

247
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:11,700
neither will I.

248
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,980
They happen to be sticking the wallpaper in the master bedroom today.

249
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:15,980
I want you to have a look

250
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,510
and see if you like it or not.

251
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,300
Oh, and the bed has also arrived.

252
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,540
Uncle Lin didn't tell me

253
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:24,940
what's it like in the living room

254
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,339
and I have no clue either.

255
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:28,540
We can check it out when we get there.

256
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,540
But Uncle Lin did say

257
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:31,630
we are both

258
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:32,960
somewhat introverted.

259
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:35,510
So the living room doesn't really matter.

260
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:38,420
The study and the bedroom would be more important.

261
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:40,660
The most important thing right now

262
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:41,740
is your breakfast.

263
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,910
What do you want to have?

264
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,220
Breakfast?

265
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:49,670
The cereal the other day

266
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,660
would be good.

267
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,680
I gave you that

268
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,330
because there was nothing left at home that day.

269
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:57,780
It's okay, I like it.

270
00:17:58,900 --> 00:17:59,860
Okay, wait here.

271
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:36,520
Come on in.

272
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:48,100
Is this your house?

273
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:50,840
My father left it to me.

274
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,580
It is still being redecorated.

275
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,700
You can only move into

276
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,180
the wedding house

277
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,500
after your marriage.

278
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:58,600
Do you understand?

279
00:18:59,260 --> 00:18:59,940
Yes.

280
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,420
Show me around.

281
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:03,900
Okay.

282
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,180
This study room

283
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,660
will be yours in the future.

284
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,990
I will use the other one.

285
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,580
[Shi Yi]

286
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,100
What's this?

287
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,660
I asked someone to make a stamp with your name

288
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:33,920
and stamped them here.

289
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:34,980
What's it for?

290
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:38,530
The invitation cards would be stamped using a wooden carved stamp.

291
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:40,860
I asked them to let you pick the font first.

292
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:46,570
What type of font would your family prefer?

293
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,360
The seniors at home

294
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,700
prefer the Tang style.

295
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:54,500
They like neat and properly written regular script characters.

296
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:56,660
Among four great regular script calligraphers,

297
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:58,860
only Zhao Mengfu was from the Yuan Dynasty.

298
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,300
Since they prefer the Tang Dynasty,

299
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,560
we will choose from the rest of the three.

300
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,660
I quite like Yan Zhenqin's works.

301
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,740
However, he died of unjust treatment.

302
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,020
I suppose it is ominous to use that.

303
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,950
After all, we are having a wedding.

304
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,060
Forget it.

305
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:14,900
The Liu style.

306
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,640
The Liu style is a bit too serious.

307
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:20,990
Maybe it won't fit well on an engagement invitation letter.

308
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:26,060
[Shi Yi]

309
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:28,700
Since we ruled out the former three,

310
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,230
let's use the last one then.

311
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,140
You two are putting so much thinking into picking the right font

312
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,740
for your engagement invitation letter.

313
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,100
I can imagine

314
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:39,040
how much trouble you will have for your wedding.

315
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,220
Shi Yi, since you are free,

316
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:43,090
let's go and try on your dress.

317
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,380
Go give it a try.

318
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:48,340
Okay.

319
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:01,580
Why are there so many of them?

320
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:02,640
It can't be helped.

321
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:05,000
Our families have been very close to each other for generations.

322
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,340
We will make as many dresses

323
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,380
as we are told.

324
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:08,950
Do you like them?

325
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:10,740
Since this is your engagement banquet,

326
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:11,990
these sample dresses

327
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,100
were made by my brothers and I.

328
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,260
Your wedding dress on the other hand,

329
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:16,260
would be tailored by my grandma.

330
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:19,320
The dress she'll make for you would not only be beautiful.

331
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,260
My grandma barely made any dress

332
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,900
after she turned 70.

333
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:25,900
The last time she made a dress was for Zhousheng Chen's mother.

334
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,560
That was also a wedding dress.

335
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:31,300
That was at least 28 years ago then.

336
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:32,660
25 years.

337
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:36,060
Zhousheng Chen is 28.

338
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:37,640
But his mother got married

339
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,060
25 years ago?

340
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:41,910
Choose the one you like.

341
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,340
For us tailors,

342
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:47,180
people and clothes have a connection.

343
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:49,420
The one you like at first sight

344
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:50,580
is the one that suits you the most

345
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:52,640
and the one that looks the best on you.

346
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,740
I knew it would be that one.

347
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:58,110
It was pretty obvious that you took a few more glances at it

348
00:21:58,110 --> 00:21:59,460
when I was hanging it.

349
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,730
Let me try it.

350
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:15,620
I know your grandma is old,

351
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:17,810
can she still take the workload of making dresses?

352
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:19,220
She is in good health.

353
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,620
The reason she doesn't make clothes for other people

354
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:22,220
is not because of her health.

355
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:24,740
It's because ever since my grandfather passed away,

356
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:25,660
she didn't have the mood

357
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:27,520
to make festive dresses anymore.

358
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:29,940
Why

359
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,350
do they all love Qipaos?

360
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,380
Their family and ours are pretty alike.

361
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:36,060
Our families became wealthy during the last century,

362
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:37,190
in the 1930s and 40s.

363
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:39,700
At that time, the cheongsam was fashionable

364
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:40,780
and trendy.

365
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,130
My aunties' closets

366
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,160
were full of them.

367
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,510
It's a mark of their generation.

368
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:49,370
And now that habit has become second nature to them.

369
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,540
After this habit takes root,

370
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:52,800
it becomes a rule that restricts people.

371
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:54,860
Very clever.

372
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:00,700
This dress suits you very well.

373
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:03,020
It belongs to you.

374
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,490
The decorations at the cuffs can be taken out.

375
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:10,220
A beauty like you does not need a complicated dress.

376
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:12,220
Less is more.

377
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:14,420
Try the next one.

378
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,500
Hold on.

379
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,030
I want to go downstairs.

380
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:30,660
Why did you come downstairs?

381
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:31,660
I was thinking of

382
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,540
going upstairs to find you

383
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:33,600
when you were done.

384
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,180
Does it look good?

385
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:37,740
Yeah.

386
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:39,540
Come on in.

387
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:45,560
Chen.

388
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:47,530
What brings you here?

389
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:49,020
I heard that you and my sister-in-law

390
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,550
would come here to see the wedding house today.

391
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:52,140
As I've never met my sister-in-law,

392
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,470
I stopped by for a visit.

393
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,180
I am Wenchuan.

394
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:58,950
Nice to meet you.

395
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:01,210
This is my wife, Tong Jiaren.

396
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:02,790
Nice to meet you.

397
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:05,140
The two of you

398
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:06,400
seldom see each other.

399
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:07,860
How about staying for dinner?

400
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:09,020
I will get things ready.

401
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:09,660
Okay.

402
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:14,660
Shi Yi,

403
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:17,140
go upstairs to continue trying out the dresses.

404
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:18,380
You guys can wait for me in the living room.

405
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:19,710
I will go help Uncle Lin.

406
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:37,940
I will make some adjustments to the dress when I go back.

407
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,140
When I get to Zhenjiang,

408
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:42,340
I will take them to the Zhou Residence to have you try them.

409
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:46,660
You said

410
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,700
the two of you were not only colleagues,

411
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,830
but studied in the same school as well.

412
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,480
He is a lot smarter than me.

413
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:55,300
While I was still studying for my undergraduate degree,

414
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:55,980
he was already

415
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,440
a doctoral degree holder.

416
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:01,340
My brother is a

417
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:03,000
genius with an IQ score of 190.

418
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:04,140
He went to university

419
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:04,940
at 17

420
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:07,340
and got his doctoral degree at 19.

421
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,580
But as far as I know,

422
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:11,900
according to the Guinness Book of World Records,

423
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:12,860
the person who has the highest IQ ever recorded

424
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:13,860
is not my brother.

425
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:15,780
There is another person

426
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,380
who got a PhD in physics at 15.

427
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:18,700
Shi Yi.

428
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:20,660
Let me in on your secret.

429
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:22,520
How do you manage to keep in shape?

430
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:26,420
I don't try to keep myself in shape.

431
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:29,140
I do aerobics every day till midnight

432
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:30,420
and do yoga in the morning.

433
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:32,300
I don't even have staple food anymore,

434
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,830
but still, it doesn't work.

435
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:36,780
Grandma might have a heart attack

436
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:39,640
if she hears the noise you make when doing aerobics.

437
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,540
I actually do know of a way

438
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:54,420
to lose weight.

439
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:55,820
Utilizing acupuncture

440
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:57,220
or doing a belly massage.

441
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:59,500
It promotes urination and draws out the excess water, while simultaneously promoting metabolism.

442
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,380
As long as your metabolism is good,

443
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:01,260
your body will not store

444
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,460
too much fat or trash.

445
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:03,900
Thus, you can lose weight.

446
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:04,700
But be aware

447
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:06,460
that acupoint might cause your body to become heaty.

448
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:07,580
Remember to drink some warm water

449
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:08,660
before and after the acupuncture session.

450
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:09,780
Okay, I got it.

451
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:13,220
You know about acupuncture points too?

452
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:14,020
Just a little.

453
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:15,710
When did you learn that?

454
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:17,180
A long time ago.

455
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,380
When I was young, I had poor health

456
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:19,420
and visited the Chinese medicine doctor a lot.

457
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:20,820
Because of that, I became interested in the subject

458
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:21,620
and signed up for a class.

459
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:22,540
I learnt a bit.

460
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:24,980
Maybe I can give you a treatment someday.

461
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:26,740
No need, I am fine.

462
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,540
Your posture must be pretty bad

463
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:29,260
when you work on experiments.

464
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:30,980
That's why your neck must be stiff.

465
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:32,110
Let me have a go at it.

466
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:33,060
If you don't think it works,

467
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:33,990
then I will stop.

468
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:36,100
Your work is already very tiring.

469
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:37,780
If you need to give me acupuncture at night,

470
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:39,420
you might not get enough rest.

471
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:40,300
I won't get tired

472
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,420
if it's for you.

473
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:43,700
All right.

474
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,370
I had an appointment with my friend.

475
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:49,660
You guys continue without me.

476
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:50,520
I have to go now.

477
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:51,680
Let me give you a ride.

478
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,280
It's fine.

479
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:06,780
Do you like this?

480
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,160
I was just having that.

481
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,460
It's very delicious.

482
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,220
Man.

483
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:38,060
Man.

484
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,170
I thought you already left.

485
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:44,790
Let me drive you home.

486
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,360
No, it's okay.

487
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,380
You knew how much effort I had to put in

488
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:54,000
in order to take over

489
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:55,080
what my father had.

490
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,460
You are so smart.

491
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:02,100
What happened just now,

492
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,080
you definitely know what's going on.

493
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,880
You know very well

494
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:07,040
who she cares about and loves.

495
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,340
I can see that,

496
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:12,720
your wife has a crush on your big brother.

497
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:14,260
I am not the eldest son

498
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,260
and I only have my mother's support.

499
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:17,060
Thus I can only accept

500
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:18,460
who she tells me to marry.

501
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:21,810
Yes.

502
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,180
I owe you more than an apology.

503
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:29,980
You are a married man.

504
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:32,420
Act like one, please.

505
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:03,420
[With long eyebrows and beautiful, striking eyes, the man is charming and irresistible]

506
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:17,660
[the man is charming]

507
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:26,420
[and irresistible]

508
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:38,780
It's already late,

509
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:39,980
why aren't you in bed?

510
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,500
Did you write this?

511
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:47,500
I wrote it when I was bored.

512
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:50,830
Have you read it?

513
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,360
The whole passage.

514
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:55,000
The rhapsody Shanglin fu.

515
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:58,480
Can you give this to me?

516
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:01,100
If you like it,

517
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:02,820
I could put in more effort to write another one.

518
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:04,620
I scribbled this down previously.

519
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:06,100
No, I'll take this.

520
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:08,300
All right.

521
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,340
[Bones of a Great Man]

522
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,080
[In this world, very few people have got great bone structure. Some may have good bone structure, but not beautiful facial features; many have beautiful facial features, but not good bone structure.]

523
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:32,580
[Most people are shallow, for they only see the beautiful facial features, but not good bone structure.]

524
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:40,420
[With long eyebrows and beautiful, striking eyes, the man is charming and irresistible]

525
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:01,580
What's up?

526
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:04,020
In the past, you would never waste a minute

527
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:05,100
when you travelled

528
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,640
between Zhenjiang and Shanghai.

529
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,100
You would either read a book,

530
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,100
or a magazine.

531
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:15,670
This is the first time I see you zoning out.

532
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,380
Zoning out for a girl too.

533
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,740
You've put in effort

534
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:45,030
in designing the invitation letters.

535
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:47,620
The handwriting looks great.

536
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:48,340
He wrote it.

537
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,660
The engagement banquet is on next Saturday.

538
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:53,700
When I asked Shi Yi

539
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:55,100
to give me a list of her relatives she wants to invite,

540
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,340
she said she's fine

541
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,160
as long as you two are present.

542
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:00,340
Other families

543
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,860
only hold a wedding banquet.

544
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:02,820
And their present will be recorded

545
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:03,860
so they can return a gift in the future.

546
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:05,300
If we ask our friends and relatives

547
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:06,900
to come to our engagement banquet.

548
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:08,430
Do they need to bring gifts?

549
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:09,340
If not,

550
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,700
they won't feel right.

551
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:13,030
If they do, then I would feel embarrassed.

552
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,380
My daughter Shi Yi

553
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:15,460
never cared about

554
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:17,600
these social conventions in the past.

555
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,740
But she changed a lot

556
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:19,940
after she met you.

557
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:21,940
It has nothing to do with him.

558
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:22,870
It's my opinion.

559
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:26,300
My family will definitely send gifts in return.

560
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:27,740
The gifts we return

561
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,630
will surely be of higher value.

562
00:32:29,810 --> 00:32:31,820
So, please don't be too concerned.

563
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,300
Let's forget it.

564
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:34,260
Let's stick to

565
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,060
your family tradition.

566
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:36,990
Let's just treat it as a formality.

567
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:38,220
I agree.

568
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:40,020
Shi Yi's mother and I,

569
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,290
as parents from the girl's side,

570
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:42,550
will definitely come.

571
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:44,360
As for other relatives,

572
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:46,230
they can come to the wedding.

573
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:48,660
I think it depends

574
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:49,860
on the scale.

575
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:51,460
If it's a grand banquet,

576
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:53,220
it would seem disrespectful

577
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:54,940
if only the two of us went.

578
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:56,540
By the way, Chen.

579
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:57,540
Where is your family going

580
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:59,020
to hold

581
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:00,260
the engagement banquet?

582
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:02,020
And how many tables would there be?

583
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:03,340
Right now, it's 16 tables.

584
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:04,260
We are not going to hold it outside.

585
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:05,460
We'll have it at home.

586
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,820
They have a big family.

587
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:11,580
There are not as many people in our family.

588
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:13,380
Nor are there as many relatives.

589
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:14,720
How about this?

590
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:16,300
Let's say we

591
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:17,380
invite your uncle's family,

592
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:18,660
along with your grandma and grandpa.

593
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:20,060
So, we could sit at one table.

594
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:20,390
Yeah.

595
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:22,020
That wouldn't be disrespectful, right?

596
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:23,700
It's all up to you actually.

597
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:24,420
You don't have to care about

598
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,750
our family traditions.

599
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:27,180
This matter

600
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:29,200
is actually giving me a headache.

601
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:31,890
Well, every family gets their own problems.

602
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:32,740
In my opinion,

603
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:34,020
it may be because

604
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:35,020
you have a lot of family members,

605
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:37,730
that's why there are a lot of things to worry about.

606
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:39,260
Honey, what are you talking about?

607
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:41,060
Who would say his future son-in-law's

608
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,180
got too many things to worry about?

609
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:42,940
Seriously.

610
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:44,660
It's just chit-chat.

611
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:45,900
Right, you guys continue.

612
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:46,860
I, I will make a call

613
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:47,660
to your uncle.

614
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:52,180
The bond between each other

615
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:53,900
is sometimes hard to explain.

616
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,340
You two are now engaged

617
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:56,810
but we two

618
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:58,720
haven't had a proper conversation

619
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,650
or spent some time with each other.

620
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,900
What hobbies do you have?

621
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:05,600
Playing chess.

622
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,060
Go?

623
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:08,540
Chess?

624
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:11,199
I can play them all.

625
00:34:11,219 --> 00:34:12,620
Backgammon is fine, too.

626
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:14,940
You know how to play Backgammon?

627
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:16,909
Dad, you've found an opponent now.

628
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,500
Board games are good.

629
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:21,489
How a person is, is shown by the way he plays chess.

630
00:34:21,489 --> 00:34:22,889
Your innate characters,

631
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:24,139
and even how generous you are,

632
00:34:24,139 --> 00:34:25,920
everything is displayed on the chess board

633
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,340
Nothing can hide.

634
00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:29,820
Let's find time to play!

635
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:30,510
Okay.

636
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:39,580
My dad seems to like you very much.

637
00:34:41,449 --> 00:34:42,780
This is my first time being a son-in-law.

638
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,440
I don't have much experience.

639
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,080
I am just trying to do my best.

640
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:48,690
Then you need to impress him.

641
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:53,300
For the game later,

642
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:54,860
is it better for me to win,

643
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,060
or to lose?

644
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,340
What do you think?

645
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:05,620
Whether I win or lose,

646
00:35:06,290 --> 00:35:08,350
I need to be respectful and friendly.

647
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:29,380
Hurry up.

648
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:30,140
Okay.

649
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:40,820
Place it more to the inside.

650
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:41,680
How unsightly!

651
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:42,440
Will do, Sir!

652
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:45,510
I'm warning you!

653
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,360
You better do a good job at setting up the wiring.

654
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:47,980
There are many people wearing high heels

655
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,580
this month.

656
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:52,100
It would be disastrous if someone tripped!

657
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,620
Sui.

658
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,500
You're up early.

659
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:59,020
Have you had breakfast?

660
00:35:59,020 --> 00:35:59,700
I did.

661
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:07,300
Why don't you put the sheet on?

662
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:08,220
They will come tomorrow.

663
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:09,350
This is ridiculous.

664
00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:12,400
I will do it tomorrow morning.

665
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,920
No one will be sleeping on it tonight.

666
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,220
It will gather dust.

667
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,220
It's just one night.

668
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:19,820
How dusty can it be?

669
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:21,500
You should just put it on.

670
00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:24,010
They won't notice the dust anyways.

671
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:28,310
Where dust is visible to your naked eye

672
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:29,840
is called the ancient tomb.

673
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:33,960
Is it sweet?

674
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:35,820
Yeah.

675
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:38,640
Are you tired when you are sitting there?

676
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:42,220
Not...not really.

677
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:54,900
Why are you still sitting there?

678
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:55,860
Do the cleaning!

679
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:09,860
From tomorrow on, remember,

680
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:12,010
you shouldn't come here without permission.

681
00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:12,670
Why is that?

682
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:15,270
They aren't sleeping together, right?

683
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:17,220
Are you even a man?

684
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,380
I am.

685
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,870
I thought you knew men very well.

686
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,940
All right, I got it.

687
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,630
Madame Sui, where else should I clean?

688
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:31,500
The whole place.

689
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:32,180
Got it.

690
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:49,860
Still alive?

691
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:59,020
[Lotus Fragrance Pavilion]

692
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:54,110
Are you envious?

693
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:56,980
This is what the eldest son gets.

694
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:59,660
It's even grander than our wedding.

695
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:02,670
Aren't you supposed to be happy

696
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:05,430
that your big brother is getting married?

697
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:06,260
Yeah, I am.

698
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:07,460
How about you?

699
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:09,080
As his sister-in-law,

700
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:11,860
aren't you supposed to prepare a gift for him?

701
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:15,840
My parents have done that.

702
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:51,020
Thank you.

703
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:54,260
How are you doing?

704
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:55,780
Are you nervous?

705
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:58,660
I'm all right.

706
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,580
That didn't sound honest.

707
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:05,980
It's just whenever I think about going to their place,

708
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:07,380
the first thing that comes to my mind

709
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:08,420
is always his mother's face.

710
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:09,950
That's why I am a bit scared.

711
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:14,220
The relationship between mother-in-laws and daughter-in-laws

712
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:16,780
has always been a topic of Asian culture.

713
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:19,610
And always the trigger that leads to domestic problems.

714
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:20,810
Even a beauty like you

715
00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:22,380
cannot run away from it.

716
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:24,460
Why don't you help me figure it out

717
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:26,140
instead of making it even worse?

718
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:27,060
We can't help you

719
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:28,780
with something like this.

720
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:30,500
However,

721
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:32,500
you will live in Shanghai in the future

722
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,420
and his mother will live in Zhenjiang.

723
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:35,820
Which means you will only see her, once a month.

724
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:36,750
Don't be afraid.

725
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:38,600
You've got a point.

726
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:43,300
Actually, what I am most nervous about

727
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:45,060
is that I am going to

728
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:46,260
move in with him soon.

729
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:47,500
Soon.

730
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:48,670
Tomorrow night.

731
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:50,100
You girls feel me?

732
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:51,220
Totally!

733
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:53,700
That's why I came here

734
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:55,580
to give you some encouragement.

735
00:39:56,590 --> 00:39:57,770
Matters like this.

736
00:39:58,050 --> 00:39:59,900
Do it or not,

737
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:02,360
you will need to face it eventually.

738
00:40:02,370 --> 00:40:03,540
I am not trying to avoid it.

739
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:05,020
We are not having an affair.

740
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:06,020
Why should I hide!

741
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:08,900
It seems someone is not nervous.

742
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:10,740
She's actually looking forward to it.

743
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:12,900
Even her heart is racing.

744
00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:16,590
But honestly,

745
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:18,780
what stage are you guys in now?

746
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:19,340
Yeah!

747
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,580
Who's got the problem?

748
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:28,100
I think it's Zhousheng Chen.

749
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:29,180
It must be him.

750
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:30,140
Our dear Shi Yi

751
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:31,060
is as healthy as an ox.

752
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:32,300
And her mental health is great.

753
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:33,500
Stop it.

754
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:35,590
It's not the right time yet.

755
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:37,730
Maybe it's

756
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:38,890
our Shi Yi who's got the problem.

757
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:40,500
We can't only blame the guy.

758
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,920
You two definitely need to stay together for two weeks.

759
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:45,960
Here's a little advice.

760
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:46,660
Men

761
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:48,740
care about practicality.

762
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:50,900
You should take your shot, Shi Yi.

763
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:52,300
Stop fooling around.

764
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,780
You're already 27. You can't be shy about this!

765
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:00,460
I am looking for a bag to put my shoes in.

766
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:01,260
Staying there

767
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:03,060
I need at least a pair of high heels,

768
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:04,100
a pair of flats,

769
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:05,660
and a pair of sneakers.

770
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:06,620
Oh yeah,

771
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:09,510
do you think I need to bring a pair of rain boots?

772
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:10,620
They live

773
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:11,900
deep in the mountains, right?

774
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:12,580
I guess you do.

775
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:14,840
What if you come across some muddy roads?

776
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:17,750
Their home is connected to the main roads!

777
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:38,460
You are back.

778
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:40,450
Who's going to pick up the bride tomorrow?

779
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:41,450
I am a bit worried,

780
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:42,740
so I came back to have a look.

781
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:43,740
I will leave soon.

782
00:41:47,410 --> 00:41:48,410
Don't address her

783
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:50,100
as the bride.

784
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:53,180
Why not?

785
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:55,800
Just because his mother doesn't like Shi Yi?

786
00:41:56,390 --> 00:41:59,250
It's none of my concern whether she likes Shi Yi or not.

787
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:00,870
Marriage is a very formal thing

788
00:42:00,870 --> 00:42:02,060
for a girl.

789
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,050
We need to follow the steps.

790
00:42:04,310 --> 00:42:05,220
They are currently engaged.

791
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:06,660
It's not their wedding yet.

792
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:08,460
That's why she's not a bride yet.

793
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:10,780
I see.

794
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:16,260
This place

795
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:17,500
is finally going to have

796
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:18,860
a hostess living here.

797
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,610
Allow me.

798
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:35,560
Where is Uncle Lin?

799
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,340
Uncle Lin and Chen went to the wedding house.

800
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:38,870
They asked me to pick you up.

801
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:40,060
You need to go to the recording studio first, right?

802
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:41,540
Yeah, I have a recording session in the morning.

803
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:42,660
I heard from my uncle

804
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:43,500
that you have recording sessions

805
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:44,380
every month.

806
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:45,500
They are all about

807
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:46,940
doing charity and making donation

808
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:48,140
with some famous voice actors and radio anchors.

809
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:48,660
Yeah.

810
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:49,820
We have been doing it for 3 to 4 years.

811
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:51,420
It's like a get-together for some old friends.

812
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:52,220
Just for fun.

813
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:56,300
But how do you do charity with recordings?

814
00:42:57,210 --> 00:42:58,780
We have a fixed number of listeners.

815
00:42:58,780 --> 00:42:59,940
So we can do a program

816
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:01,990
and insert charity advertisements in between sections.

817
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:03,460
Other times we would compete with one another.

818
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:04,860
With one person representing one project.

819
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:05,660
Whoever wins,

820
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:06,940
the sponsor of the program

821
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:07,780
will donate the

822
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:08,710
to that project.

823
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,570
Having skills sure is nice.

824
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,590
Even if you're only doing a good deed, there would still be people to help you. .

825
00:43:14,590 --> 00:43:15,400
Hope in.
