4
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,640
Something happened at home.

5
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,370
I have to go back and take a look.

6
00:01:58,039 --> 00:01:59,440
Try to rest early today.

7
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,840
How's Wenxing?

8
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,690
She's recovering now.

9
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,370
She's in a terrible condition.

10
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:55,820
We have to schedule an operation for her as soon as possible.

11
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,120
Go.

00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:43,920
Chen.

13
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,280
Leave this place.

14
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,640
It's a big world out there.

15
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,440
Go live your own life.

Go.

19
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:36,920
Chen.

20
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,880
Step out with me for a moment.

21
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,280
What's wrong, Ren?

22
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,520
Mother won't let outsiders into the guest room.

23
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,920
Lin Fei could do nothing.

24
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,160
I came to tell you

25
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,050
Shi Yi didn't feel well last night.

26
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:52,120
When did the doctor say she'd wake up?

27
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,720
In three or four hours.

28
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:03,450
That's how life is.

29
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,320
Sometimes

30
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:08,110
there are no clouds in the sky.

31
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,640
And sometimes,

32
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,200
many different things can pile on top of each other

33
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,400
until they're heavier than a mountain.

34
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,570
You have to take it easy.

35
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,320
I used to

36
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,040
think

37
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,040
I could

38
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,000
easily handle the relationship

39
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,360
between people,

40
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,520
whether it's a blood relationship,

41
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,360
business relationship,

42
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:35,880
or other social relationships.

43
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,840
But I find

44
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,919
I can't handle easily the things

45
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,720
related to Shi Yi.

46
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,640
When I first heard about it,

47
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,080
I couldn't even think.

48
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,800
I didn't dare to ask the doctor

49
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,440
what was going on.

50
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,160
I didn't dare to go in either

51
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,960
when I was at the door.

52
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,960
I was really afraid

53
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,620
something bad would happen to Shi Yi.

54
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,720
Didn't the doctor explain it?

55
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,850
It's appendicitis.

56
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,320
She will be fine.

57
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,880
Don't work yourself up.

58
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,320
I hope so.

59
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:26,780
It's true this house

60
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,720
is not a good place to live in.

61
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,220
It's not conducive for her recovery.

62
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:35,450
I'm here to take care of Wenxing.

63
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,530
Since it's not a good place to live,

64
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,880
just leave if you want to.

65
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:19,600
Zhousheng Chen.

66
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,400
You're awake?

67
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:30,950
It's acute appendicitis.

68
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,200
I was afraid the doctors there wouldn't be able to treat it.

69
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,060
So I brought you back to Shanghai.

70
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,080
No wonder it hurt so much.

71
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,800
Going back to Shanghai for acute appendicitis,

72
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,660
you're making a big deal out of it.

73
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:48,320
It's neither a life-threatening disease

74
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,780
nor an insignificant one.

75
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,390
Now that you're back,

76
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,850
let's not talk about it.

77
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:55,250
Just take your rest and get well soon.

78
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,230
Are you thirsty?

79
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,830
I just brought you some warm water.

80
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:14,680
I want to sit up.

81
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,720
Okay, come on.

82
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,600
Come closer to me.

83
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,320
I'm tired of talking loudly.

84
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,760
I had a dream.

85
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,160
I dreamed that I didn't lose my memory

86
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,290
after I died in my last life.

87
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,680
Did Meng Po let you go?

88
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,680
Maybe it's because I hadn't done anything bad.

89
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,460
Or it's because

90
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,390
I've done too many bad things.

91
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:04,400
So Meng Po

92
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,050
forced me to drink her soup.

93
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,260
You are a great person.

94
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,500
I'm a great person?

95
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,260
You know what I used to be like?

96
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,640
That's right.

97
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,760
I knew you in my past life.

98
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,820
Why don't you say something to refute me?

99
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,920
I don't want to.

100
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,930
There's nothing wrong with this assumption.

101
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:34,280
When I'm older,

102
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:35,960
I will turn to theology

103
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,600
as Newton did.

104
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:39,390
Because of me?

105
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:41,090
Because of you.

106
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:44,500
I would be such a guilt-ridden person.

107
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,120
Are you hungry?

108
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,940
I'll go make you something to eat.

109
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:54,920
Wait for me.

You're not working today?

147
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,500
I'm taking the day off.

148
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,730
Take the day off?

149
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,280
What for?

150
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,500
To take care of you.

151
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,320
I just have an appendicitis.

152
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,050
I haven't had an operation yet.

153
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:53,760
Are you hungry?

154
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,160
I'll make you breakfast.

155
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:17,540
Hello.

156
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,640
He goes shopping at the supermarket

157
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,640
every working day at 2pm,

158

[Security Guard]

159
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,000
goes back at 3:30.

160
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:29,920
This guy doesn't work.

161
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,450
He's probably unemployed.

162
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,120
What's this for?

163
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,340
This is for shelling walnuts.

164
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,640
He prepared them all.

165
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:05,960
So finely cut.

166
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,359
It tastes different.

167
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,480
I find your quality of life has obviously improved

168
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,319
after you got married.

169
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,760
What has improved?

170
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:15,920
I don't know.

171
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,760
The house is the same, the people are the same...

172

But the atmosphere is different.

173
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,480
It used to be a bachelorette pad,

174
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,160
now it's a home.

175
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,359
A sophisticated male host

176
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:29,960
brings about a quantum leap.

177
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:32,600
The taste of life is in the details.

178
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,580
The male host provides

179
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:35,840
those details.

180
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:36,920
So you

181
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,360
didn't eat fruit and snacks

182
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,630
when you lived together?

183
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:40,290
Yes, we did.

184
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,290
When I felt like eating them,

185
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:43,550
I would do so over here.

186
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,570
Shi Yi.

187
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,110
We haven't eaten fruit today.

188
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,110
I'll go to the kitchen

189
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:51,570
to get some fruit for her.

190
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,140
It seems my future life

191
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:54,800
is not going to be easy.

192
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,040
Accept your fate.

193
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,680
You're together now.

194
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,360
What can I say?

195
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,340
He chased me so earnestly.

196
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,680
Give him a chance.

197
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,430
We don't disturb him

198
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:15,930
talking like this, right?

199
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,680
I've installed soundproof walls in my study.

200
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,610
He can't hear us.

201
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:21,120
He'll be out at 6 pm sharp to make dinner.

202
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,480
He cooks?

203
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,460
What's the matter?

204
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,250
Nothing.

205
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,480
I just wanted to ask

206
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:30,800
if you're feeling

207
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,080
unwell at all?

208
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,480
Or if you have anything

209
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,560
you want to do,

210
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,010
something you want to eat,

211
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,070
or to drink?

212
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,320
If you need anything,

213
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,050
just tell me.

214
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:42,300
I'll make it for you.

215
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,080
Then I'll leave you to it.

216
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:48,010
You guys continue.

217
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:49,270
I'm going back to work.

218
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:49,760
Okay.

219
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,480
Surely he doesn't just work all day

220
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,940
taking care of you at home?

221
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,720
He took a leave of absence,

222
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,650
to look after me.

223
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,930
It's a long way to go.

224
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:08,520
I'll try. I'll try.

225
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,520
I don't want you two to see me off, but you don't listen to me!

226
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,190
Do we still have to pretend to be polite?

227
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:26,670
I'm not pretending to be polite with you.

228
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:28,170
I take a walk every night at 8.

229
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:28,970
Right on time.

230
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:30,810
When you didn't live here,

231
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:32,270
where did you go for walks?

232
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,230
In Bremen,

233
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,920
there was a green area under the apartment building.

234
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,960
In Xi'an

235
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,240
I could walk to the Giant Wild Goose Pagoda

236
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,580
and back to the institute.

237
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:40,640
There was also a school playground next to

238
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,720
the institute in Shanghai.

239
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,520
Kinda like my dad,

240
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,270
he could always find a place to fish.

241
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,070
A day for him never went to waste.

242
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:53,560
Life must follow some routines so as not to

243
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,360
waste a lot of time for no reason.

244
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,120
I've learnt that lesson.

245
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,120
Professor of chemistry, goodbye.

246
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,560
That's enough. You should go now.

247
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,090
Let's go.

248
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,680
-Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye.

249
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:07,590
Let's go too.

250
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,640
Here, I've got some warm water for you.

251
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:32,150
You can go to the institute tomorrow.

252
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:33,270
I'm fine.

253
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,260
It's the same for me wherever I am.

254
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,320
Same job.

255
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,060
Same conference call.

256
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
It's not the same.

257
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,260
You can still work

258
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,510
at home 24 hours a day.

259
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,090
I can't do anything.

260
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,400
I always want to watch you.

261
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,130
Aren't you a dangerous beauty?

262
00:20:59,420 --> 00:20:59,960
Nothing.

263
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,250
Sit here and don't move.

264
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,160
I'll do it.

265
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:05,760
Take a good rest.

266
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,800
What are you doing here alone?

267
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:42,050
I've been growing lotus roots all summer.

268
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,780
There's no one left to eat them.

269
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:46,320
Yes, it's a pity.

270
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:49,060
It's my fault.

271
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:52,840
It's your fault.

272
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:57,160
Do you think the appendicitis

273
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,980
could have been brought on by diet?

274
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:05,740
[Lotus Fragrance Pavilion]

275
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,410
I don't know.

276
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:04,400
If you're not satisfied with the food,

277
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,660
you'll be in a bad mood.

278
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:08,700
If you're in a bad mood, you'll get appendicitis.

279
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:10,550
Her getting the appendicitis

280
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:11,920
is still your fault.

281
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:14,330
Do you know how to talk properly?

282
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:14,780
I'm just

283
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,440
following your implication.

284
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,780
Do you want to go to Shanghai?

285
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:30,640
Chen told us earlier

286
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:32,820
not to disturb them.

287
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,120
Go or not, it's totally up to you.

288
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,200
Let's go.

289
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:49,600
Ren.

290
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,240
Where are you taking me?

291
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:53,890
We're going to find Chen.

292
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:57,270
Okay, okay.

293
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:02,120
Did you bring all of Grandma's medicine?

294
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:02,720
Yes.

295
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:18,420
Who are we waiting for?

296
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,320
You'll find out later.

297
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,760
How have you been?

298
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,480
Good.

299
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:29,680
Who's the girl?

300
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:31,150
This is Shi Yi's cousin.

301
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,360
Good, good.

302
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,120
Get in.

303
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,960
Grandma, let me help you.

304
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,480
Be careful.

305
00:23:58,890 --> 00:23:59,620
Hello, Chen.

306
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:00,180
Chen.

307
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:02,610
Chen.

308
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:03,680
Grandma.

309
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,120
Why are you here?

310
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,600
Come on in.

311
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,400
Ren said Shi Yi had appendicitis.

312
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,280
Grandma was worried about her and came to visit her.

313
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,200
I wanted to come and check on her too.

314
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,330
So we came together.

315
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,480
It wasn't my idea.

316
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,720
Grandma wants to see you.

317
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,650
I can't stop her.

318
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,440
Sit down first, Grandma.

319
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,200
Grandma's in a very stable condition

320
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,600
except that she can't recognize some people.

321
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,280
Be at peace.

322
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,040
Chen, where's Shi Yi?

323
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,720
She's washing up inside.

324
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,440
You guys sit down first.

325
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,300
I'll go get her.

326
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,120
Okay.

327
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,250
What are you looking at?

328
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,840
I'm looking at the crabs.

329
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,900
There are guests outside.

330
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:53,690
Who are they?

331
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:56,720
Grandma, Ren, Yuanyuan.

332
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,200
Liansui, Lin Fei.

333
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:00,170
They came together.

334
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:01,300
They came together?

335
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:02,920
How did Yuanyuan come here with them

336
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,680
together?

337
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:05,240
Isn't Grandma in poor health?

338
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,000
Is it okay for her to come here like this?

339
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,400
Well, she's here anyway.

340
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,760
Wait for me.

341
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:16,960
I'll get dressed.

342
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:25,570
Why do you live here

343
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:27,180
instead of in the new house?

344
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,920
There's a new house?

345
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:30,770
I thought you

346
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,730
didn't have any house in Shanghai.

347
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,080
Are you thirsty?

348
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,400
You think Chen would get married

349
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,600
totally unprepared?

350
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:36,880
That's hard to say.

351
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:38,720
Your family is very tricky.

352
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:41,180
Your families

353
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,000
won't even see

354
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,120
our families now.

355
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,400
-Though we don't live in the old society anymore,
- Thank you.

356
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,680
you still have to

357
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,400
follow the basic etiquette.

358
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,200
Forget it.

359
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:53,700
For the sake of Chen's honesty,

360
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:55,560
I won't say anything bad about him.

361
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,030
The worst could happen is that

362
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:58,930
I'll consider him to have married into our family.

363
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:00,250
Shi Yi can afford him anyway.

364
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:01,850
She could raise three of him.

365
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:06,080
Why didn't you tell me

366
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:06,920
you were coming in advance?

367
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:07,160
Shi Yi.

368
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:07,560
Shi Yi.

369
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,080
I'll book a hotel for you.

370
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,680
We're not staying in a hotel.

371
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:16,990
It's a waste of money.

372
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,170
And not safe either.

373
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:19,440
I want to stay with you.

374
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,770
I'll stay wherever you guys want me to.

375
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:24,720
But

376
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,600
we can't hold so many people in my apartment.

377
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,730
Then I'll stay here.

378
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:29,690
They are guests.

379
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:31,120
Let them stay in the hotel.

380
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,450
I'm not going anywhere.

381
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,060
I want to stay with you.

382
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,200
Why?

383
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,540
I want to live in the same apartment with you.

384
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,180
How about this?

385
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,840
Grandma, Liansui and Yuanyuan

386
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,600
take the bedroom.

387
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,880
You and Lin Fei will sleep on the couch.

388
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:48,610
Is that okay?

389
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,090
What about you and Chen?

390
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,800
You...you can stay in a hotel.

391
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,060
I saw it on the way here.

392
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,720
There's a hotel right next door.

393
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,720
You can't leave.

394
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,900
If they don't leave, should they sleep standing up?

395
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,640
Chen and I

396
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,360
can sleep on the floor in the study.

397
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,760
When I was a kid at my relatives' home on New Year's Eve,

398
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,440
there were many people and not enough beds.

399
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,640
We often slept on the floor.

400
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,640
Right, Yuanyuan?

401
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,600
I slept on the floor in my great-aunt's home

402
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,800
seven or eight times.

403
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:13,360
Shi Yi.

404
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,000
Can I see your bedroom?

405
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:15,880
Of course.

406
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,320
Turn on the TV for Grandma.

407
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,320
Bring them some cards.

408
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,920
You don't know how to entertain the relatives.

409
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:27,960
Come on, Grandma.

410
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,840
What do you want to watch?

411
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:45,020
Shi Yi, is this all yours?

412
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:47,500
I used to live with someone else.

413
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,960
The study was her bedroom.

414
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,560
That's why my desk is here.

415
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:56,810
So the Bund is outside your house.

416
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,960
Do you stand here and look out

417
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,620
every morning when you get up?

418
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:01,600
I don't think so.

419
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,710
I've lived here too long.

420
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:03,660
The view outside

421
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:04,520
has gotten old.

422
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:05,930
That's true.

423
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:12,210
Did you come up with the idea of coming over?

424
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,020
Did you miss us?

425
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:14,640
Yes.

426
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,200
My dad took me to my fourth great-uncle's place.

427
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:17,880
I had a hard time

428
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,120
coming up with numerous excuses

429
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,720
and finally came home early.

430
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,720
But you guys left.

431
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,000
Are you not going to

432
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,930
go back anymore?

433
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,280
Why not?

434
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,370
Of course we're going back.

435
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,020
Come out and watch a movie with us.

436
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,050
Let's go.

437
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,800
Here comes the fruit.

438
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,280
You guys go ahead and watch.

439
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,360
I have work to do.

440
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:19,400
Good boy, we're not scared.

441
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,140
I'll teach you.

442
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,120
At a time like this,

443
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,680
eating non-stop to distract yourself

444
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,480
works best.

445
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,710
Shi Yi, eat. Aren't you afraid of the dark?

446
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,780
I have more courage than you.

447
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:05,180
I'm not afraid when I'm in a group of people.

448
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,370
-You're too timid.
-You scared me.

449
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,320
This child.

450
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,840
Don't scare my little grandson.

451
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,560
You dropped your chips.

452
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:43,600
This girl is your girlfriend, right?

453
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:48,660
Yes, she is.

454
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,080
She's so pretty.

455
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:57,430
There's a lot of competition, right?

456
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:01,800
There's

457
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,130
a whole lot of competition.

458
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:06,280
Look at you.

459
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:12,840
Good, good.

460
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:20,310
Miss.

461
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:22,850
My eldest grandson

462
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:23,920
is smart.

463
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:26,720
Smarter than the average person.

464
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:30,520
It's useless for a man to be good-looking.

465
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,860
Intelligence is the most important.

466
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:36,040
That way,

467
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,410
when you two have a child,

468
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:42,910
the child is going to have high IQ.

469
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,280
And when your child has a high IQ,

470
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:46,730
you don't have to worry about him

471
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:48,410
as a mother.

472
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,000
Yes.

473
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,810
Grandma obviously doesn't remember me.

474
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:01,820
But she praises me a lot every time she sees me.

475
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:02,680
You taught her?

476
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,680
That was all from her heart.

477
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:08,960
Grandma.

478
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:10,920
Good.

479
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:11,560
Good.

480
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,080
Good.

481
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,800
So filial. My grandson.

482
00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:17,020
I'll take it.

483
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:20,850
Okay.

484
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:25,240
Grandma.

485
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,250
Go to bed.

486
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,520
It's the first time I've slept in the same room with you.

487
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,680
I'm not used to it.

488
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,850
It'll also be the last time.

489
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:49,800
Do you think I would like

490
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,660
to sleep in the same room with you?

491
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,000
What do you think you want?

492
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:53,840
You gave up a nice hotel

493
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:54,970
to sleep on the sofa.

494
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,160
It's fun.

495
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,010
Now you say it's fun.

496
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,320
You usually don't even let other people

497
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,690
sit in the same car with you.

498
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:01,840
Now you don't mind?

499
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:07,520
Your feet are facing my head.

500
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,180
Can you change the direction?

501
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:10,600
I don't want to.

502
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,210
Who wants to be so close to you?

503
00:33:13,210 --> 00:33:14,410
Did you take a shower?

504
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,320
Of course I did.

505
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,730
I was the second to last to take it.

506
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:19,330
I don't want to stay close to you even if you did.

507
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,480
What's wrong? Did you not sleep well?

508
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:24,940
It was comfortable.

509
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,400
Comfortable?

510
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:31,760
Chen, you go to sleep.

511
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,040
We're all fine.

512
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:33,780
Really.

513
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,640
Then you guys get some rest.

514
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,040
You've reached the peak

515
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,200
of personally admiring him, right?

516
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,480
And Shi Yi.

517
00:33:58,530 --> 00:34:00,060
Only Chen is worthy of her.

518
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:18,070
Grandma's asleep?

519
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,400
Yes.

520
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,159
Lian Sui.

521
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:31,719
They call you Lian Sui, Lian Sui.

522
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,380
Your last name is Lian?

523
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,230
My last name is Zhou.

524
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,699
You're all related?

525
00:34:37,929 --> 00:34:38,730
That's right.

526
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:41,350
Some are close and some are distant.

527
00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:44,860
I'm kind of distant,

528
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:46,639
like a hundred thousand miles away,

529
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:47,639
kind of relative.

530
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:50,520
Then what do you call Chen?

531
00:34:51,330 --> 00:34:53,060
I should call him great-uncle.

532
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:53,679
Great-uncle?

533
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:54,800
I didn't ask him.

534
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,000
What about my cousin?

535
00:34:56,650 --> 00:34:57,970
Great-aunt.

536
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:01,760
She is so

537
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,520
young and beautiful.

538
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,720
How can she be a 'great' anything to you?

539
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:05,830
I have no choice.

540
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:07,490
She is a senior anyway.

541
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,040
I'm going to sleep.

542
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:10,700
Go to sleep.

543
00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:24,090
Good night.

544
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:25,580
Good night.

545
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,280
Is the floor hard to sleep on?

546
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:44,360
It's okay.

547
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:50,620
Did the doctor say

548
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,220
I need an operation last time?

549
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:54,280
Do I have to have my appendix removed?

550
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:56,770
I chose a more conservative treatment,

551
00:35:56,770 --> 00:35:57,870
taking some medication to reduce inflammation,

552
00:35:57,870 --> 00:35:59,600
so you don't need an operation.

553
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,410
If it gets inflamed again,

554
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:04,000
we'll see then.

555
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:08,810
It's better not get inflamed again, it'll hurt like crazy.

556
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:13,210
Think about it.

557
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:14,720
I'm quite delicate.

558
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:18,680
Not only am I afraid of the dark, but I'm also afraid of pain.

559
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,300
Do you think I'm delicate?

560
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:22,360
No, I don't.

561
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:23,560
Really?

562
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,880
But think about it.

563
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:29,980
I seem to have more advantages.

564
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:31,420
I can cook.

565
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:32,780
I can clean the house.

566
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:33,900
I can draw.

567
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:34,800
I can write.

568
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:36,230
I can also do dubbing.

569
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:39,470
Yes, you have a lot of good points.

570
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:48,220
♫In the memory♫

571
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:51,520
♫The snow-covered city tower♫

572
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:52,840
Why did you come down?

573
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:54,340
I want to sleep with you in my arms.

574
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:58,410
♫When your name rings out♫

575
00:36:57,110 --> 00:36:57,710
All right.

576
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:03,060
♫Finally blooming again♫

577
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:06,410
♫Like a flower of the soul♫

578
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:13,600
♫The dreams that have accompanied me through the light years♫

579
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,760
Zhousheng Chen.

580
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:17,120
♫I know that with just one look♫

581
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,680
I love you.

582
00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:21,640
♫I can be sure it's the end♫

583
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,240
♫Not afraid of falling♫

584
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:23,580
Did you hear me?

585
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:28,620
♫Running to the world with you♫

586
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:33,890
♫The poem I'll continue to write♫

587
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,760
November,

588
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,000
let's get married.

589
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:38,670
♫With your name in each line♫

590
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:37,160
We'll hold an official wedding reception.

591
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:41,350
♫If it started all over again♫

592
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:41,740
I'm asking you to answer I love you.

593
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:46,000
♫I'd still remember our love♫

594
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,720
Who asked you about the wedding?

595
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:46,500
That's my answer.

596
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,860
♫It took♫

597
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:49,800
♫Hundreds of centuries♫

598
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:53,580
♫For our love to begin♫

599
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,440
Good night.

600
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,040
Good night.

601
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:59,070
♫There's no way it'd end♫

602
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,880
Here, eat it while it's warm.

603
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,720
I make the best meatloaf.

604
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,740
Chen always eats several pieces.

605
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,640
It's really good.

606
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,120
I'm not lying, right?

607
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:29,960
Shi Yi.

608
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,080
Can I come and stay with you

609
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,360
on vacation?

610
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,240
Yes, you can.

611
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,840
But you have to put your studies first.

612
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:37,040
If you do well in your exams, you can stay for a few days.

613
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,770
If you don't do well, you won't get to stay as long.

614
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:42,920
If you have kids,

615
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,780
can I still come and stay here?

616
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:47,840
Of course.

617
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,160
Then I hope you'll have a girl.

618
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,000
Is there a difference if it's a boy or a girl?

619
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:55,680
There is.

620
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,290
If you have another boy,

621
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,680
I'll not be so novel to you anymore.

622
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,140
Rare things are precious.

623
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:02,760
We haven't even had a baby yet,

624
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,360
and you're already jealous.

625
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,210
All right, get out of here.

626
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:07,610
There's a lot of oil here.

627
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:11,440
Ren.

628
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:13,470
Let's go play cards.

629
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,000
I'm not going.

630
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,570
Then what are you doing?

631
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,440
Waiting to serve Shi Yi.

632
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,580
There are several plates. She can't carry them all.

633
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:36,850
Sir.

634
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:41,320
Sir, only one meat dish?

635
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,260
You should at least have two meat dishes.

636
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:48,760
There aren't any meat dishes

637
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,620
I'd especially like to eat today.

638
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,110
Sir.

639
00:39:58,540 --> 00:39:59,850
You now live in Shi Yi's house

640
00:39:59,850 --> 00:40:01,460
before marriage, right?

641
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:02,670
Yes.

642
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:05,080
Is it convenient?

643
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,720
It's quite convenient.

644
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,580
It's very close to the institute.

645
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,280
Then...

646
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,290
What did you do

647
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:19,180
with your salary all these years?

648
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:23,300
Why are you asking this all of a sudden?

649
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:26,090
No, I'm just curious.

650
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:30,240
Sometimes the lab

651
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,760
needs to buy some things.

652
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,280
Since the budget can't be approved on short notice,

653
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,040
I often

654
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,300
buy them myself first.

655
00:40:36,090 --> 00:40:36,670
Sir.

656
00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:38,100
If the lab needs something in the future,

657
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:38,920
tell me.

658
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:39,790
I'll buy it.

659
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:41,360
No need.

660
00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:49,580
I bought it for you, sir.

661
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:51,180
Sir, you have to take a tonic.

662
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,040
We don't like it. You have it.

663
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,420
It's all yours.

664
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:15,880
An old troublemaker,

665
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:16,840
and a young troublemaker...

666
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,280
you're taking them both off our hands.

667
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,280
I'm so impressed.

668
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:20,840
Don't blame Liansui.

669
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:21,760
I'm the one who brought them out here.

670
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:22,760
You dare to speak?

671
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,760
Your father was so angry yesterday.

672
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:25,880
You're his heart and soul.

673
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,050
You know that, don't you?

674
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:28,910
We were all scolded mercilessly.

675
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,830
Shi Yi, Chen I'm leaving now.

676
00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:33,120
Bye, Grandma.

677
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:34,460
Bye. Bye.

678
00:41:36,290 --> 00:41:36,930
Grandma.

679
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,420
Take care of yourself at home.

680
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:39,960
We will visit you often when we have time.

681
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,340
Good, good.

682
00:41:42,490 --> 00:41:43,410
Chen.

683
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,920
You must visit me when you have time.

684
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,050
I will.

685
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:49,230
Don't forget.

686
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:52,630
Be safe.

687
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:53,610
Take care.

688
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:00,560
Go back. Go back.

689
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:01,540
We're leaving.

690
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:01,930
Okay.

691
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:16,960
When we move in the new house after New Year,

692
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,160
let Grandma live here in Shanghai

693
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,240
if you don't want to leave her alone.

694
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:20,570
It's a big house anyway.

695
00:42:22,350 --> 00:42:24,810
Grandma doesn't want to leave the old house.

696
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:27,740
That's how older people think.

697
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:29,000
I suggest my grandparents that they

698
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,270
come to Shanghai for medical checkups every year.

699
00:42:30,270 --> 00:42:31,250
I've tried to persuade them,

700
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:32,780
but they won't listen to me.

701
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:36,450
This weekend,

702
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:37,700
my fourth great-uncle and my uncles

703
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:39,030
will all be in Shanghai.

704
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:41,750
Let's go back to our old house on Hunan Road

705
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:42,940
for a couple of days.

706
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:43,440
Okay.

707
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:46,860
So this is a formal

708
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:47,980
parents' meeting?

709
00:43:01,590 --> 00:43:02,320
Shi Yi.

710
00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:04,200
I think this style of decoration

711
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:05,600
is the kind you like.

712
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:07,400
Basically, I'm in charge of

713
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:08,660
the later decoration.

714
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:11,600
You're not even the hostess yet

715
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:13,240
but you're already taking charge, aren't you?

716
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:14,560
See, you were afraid

717
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:16,410
our daughter would suffer here.

718
00:43:16,410 --> 00:43:17,940
You're making it a big deal.

719
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:23,640
Uncle, Auntie.

720
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,160
This is my fourth great-uncle.

721
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,740
He is the most senior in our family.

722
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:29,040
These are my uncles.

723
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:30,590
Fourth Great-Uncle.

724
00:43:30,590 --> 00:43:32,190
They are Shi Yi's mom and dad.

725
00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:33,320
-How are you? How are you?
-Nice to meet you.

726
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:34,280
Welcome. Welcome.

727
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:35,240
Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you.

728
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:36,160
Welcome. Welcome. Welcome.

729
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:37,400
We're in-laws now.

730
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:39,960
If there is anything not to your liking,

731
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:41,020
please forgive us.

732
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:42,300
Not at all!

733
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:43,780
Take a seat first.

734
00:43:43,910 --> 00:43:44,350
Let's all sit down.

735
00:43:44,350 --> 00:43:45,780
Come on, let's all sit down.

736
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:46,440
Take a seat.

737
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:48,650
Shi Yi, make some tea.

738
00:43:50,070 --> 00:43:51,010
Come on.

739
00:43:52,070 --> 00:43:53,470
You've come all this way.

740
00:43:53,550 --> 00:43:54,330
As a rule,

741
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:56,380
we should have gone to see you first.

742
00:43:56,670 --> 00:43:57,600
We've made you

743
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:59,030
come all the way to Shanghai.

744
00:43:59,030 --> 00:44:00,030
It must be tiring.

745
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:01,070
It's nothing.

746
00:44:08,030 --> 00:44:08,600
Son.

747
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:18,930
You should be clear about

748
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:21,360
Wenxing's current situation.

749
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:23,960
Dad.

750
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:26,840
I'm sure everything will be fine with

751
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:28,640
Wenxing's operation this time.

752
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:30,320
And

753
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:32,600
I want to tell you that

754
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:35,320
I was always out in the world,

755
00:44:35,990 --> 00:44:37,650
not being able to settle down.

756
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,390
But recently I've realized

757
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:40,320
that actually,

758
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,220
the person I should cherish most

759
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:43,550
is right here by my side.

760
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:45,160
So don't worry.

761
00:44:46,010 --> 00:44:46,640
I understand.
