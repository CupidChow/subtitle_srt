[Episode 10]

4
00:01:51,259 --> 00:01:51,920
Hello, Mom?

5
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,620
Shi Yi, your father and I

6
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:56,070
came to Zhenjiang earlier than expected.

7
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,340
We had a discussion.

8
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,580
We feel

9
00:01:58,700 --> 00:01:59,979
that it's impolite of us

10
00:01:59,979 --> 00:02:01,700
to only meet Chen's parents

11
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,580
during the engagement banquet.

12
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:04,380
Can you

13
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,580
discuss this with him

14
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:06,180
and arrange for us

15
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,220
to meet his mother tonight?

16
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:08,680
See if she's free tonight.

17
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,660
Something happened to their family.

18
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,700
They might not be able to make it tonight.

19
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:15,560
What happened?

20
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:16,820
Is it serious?

21
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:18,380
It's just a conflict between their relatives.

22
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:19,579
I didn't ask him much.

23
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:22,260
Alright then.

24
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,180
But you must remember this.

25
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,040
No matter what,

26
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,980
the two families need to meet each other once

27
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,940
before the engagement banquet.

28
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:29,840
Did you hear me?

29
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:30,820
And

30
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:33,100
your grandparents are here as well.

31
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:34,500
So,

32
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,140
if Chen can't make it tonight,

33
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,380
you should come by yourself.

34
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:37,860
Okay?

35
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,380
Alright.

36
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,060
That's it for now.

37
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:43,980
What's wrong?

38
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:47,060
Something happened to Chen's family.

39
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:48,590
We can't meet them tonight.

40
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:50,950
How about tomorrow?

41
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:53,260
If they can't make it tomorrow, how about the day after tomorrow?

42
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:54,380
Anyway, we applied for leave.

43
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,020
We have ample time to meet them.

44
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:56,820
Alright then.

45
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,350
Let's go and take a walk.

46
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:05,980
Lian Sui.

47
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,140
Where is he?

48
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,070
I don't know.

49
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:12,900
Lin Fei,

50
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,460
where's Zhousheng Chen?

51
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:15,580
His mother wanted to see him
for an urgent matter.

52
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:16,300
He had to leave early.

53
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,300
He didn't get to tell you before he left.

54
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,020
Is that so?

55
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,700
Is there a car available here?

56
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,100
I don't need a driver.
I can drive it myself.

57
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:25,700
A car?

58
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:27,820
There isn't?

59
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:30,500
Everyone went out.

60
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,260
We don't have any cars for now.

61
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,260
I can call a cab for you.

62
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,900
But maybe you need to wait
for half an hour.

63
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,260
Ren has a car.

64
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,180
Go and ask him.

65
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,220
Hurry up.

66
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:41,980
I don't like to talk to him.

67
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,540
He's mean.

68
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:44,950
Are you going or not?

69
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,020
Fine. I'll go.

70
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,270
You're so annoying.

71
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,300
Let me pack my things.

72
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,220
I won't lend it to you.

73
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,280
I have mysophobia.

74
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,140
I dislike it when people sit in my car.

75
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,540
Even my father hasn't
ridden my car before.

76
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:08,620
Fine.

77
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:09,740
I think I should call a cab

78
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:10,740
for Miss Shi then.

79
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:12,790
Who's borrowing the car again?

80
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:14,500
Shi Yi.

81
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:15,580
She wants to go back home.

82
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,579
She wants to go to her uncle's house in Zhenjiang.

83
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:18,260
Ask her to wait for me.

84
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,519
I'll change my attire.

85
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:23,260
Why are you changing clothes

86
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:26,220
when you're seeing
your cousin's mother-in-law?

87
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:34,220
Miss Shi.

88
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,420
Thank you for lending me your car.

89
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:37,420
Don't mention it.

90
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,220
Is this outfit suitable when I meet

91
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,350
your parents later?

92
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,040
Are you planning to go with me?

93
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:44,950
Now there's no one home.

94
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,120
No one will eat with me once you leave.

95
00:04:49,659 --> 00:04:51,190
Sure. I'll bring you along.

96
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:55,420
The key.

97
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,540
Do I need to tell your mother

98
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,860
that you're following me back?

99
00:04:58,860 --> 00:04:59,460
No need.

100
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,580
Someone else will tell her about it.

101
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,020
What are you doing?

102
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,500
I'm following you guys as well.

103
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,140
No.

104
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,750
You're not allowed to sit in my car.

105
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:21,080
Miss Shi is much more aggressive
at driving than me.

106
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:36,540
Shi Yi!

107
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,860
You can go down for now.
I'll park the car.

108
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:39,460
Alright.

109
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:44,940
Hello, my name is...

110
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:45,860
Shi Yuanyuan.

111
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,720
Did Shi Yi tell you my name?

112
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,100
You're the youngest daughter

113
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,360
of Miss Shi Yi's uncle,

114
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,500
the only child of your family.

115
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,860
You went to a girls' school
during junior high.

116
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:54,659
You couldn't get used to it,

117
00:05:54,659 --> 00:05:56,620
that's why you transferred to
an ordinary key junior high school.

118
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,140
You got into its senior high directly.

119
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,900
Your result of the National Higher Education Entrance Examination wasn't great.

120
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:00,820
You repeated your grade for one year.

121
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,680
You're in your thirteenth grade.

122
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:06,140
I suppose this is the first time
we're meeting each other.

123
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:06,940
That's right.

124
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:08,660
How did you know about me?

125
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,860
We have information regarding
the engagement banquet's guests

126
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:11,460
so that it's convenient for us

127
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:12,300
to find a topic for our first meeting.

128
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,060
If not, the first meeting

129
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:14,060
would be awkward.

130
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,100
You're considerate indeed.

131
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,500
And, the food you like,

132
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:19,340
the food you dislike,

133
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:20,220
the food you avoid,

134
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,180
the food you're allergic to,

135
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:21,900
I didn't take a close look at them.

136
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,700
I gave them to the kitchen staff.

137
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,700
You're being too considerate.

138
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:26,300
Yuanyuan.

139
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:27,380
Shi Yi.

140
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:28,660
This is Zhousheng Ren.

141
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:30,140
He's the cousin of Zhousheng Chen.

142
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,670
It's a pleasure to meet you.

143
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,260
Let's go.

144
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:34,430
Let's go.

145
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:48,900
Before I met Miss Shi,

146
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:49,860
I thought Chen

147
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,520
was the incarnation of a monk.

148
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,140
He has no time for girls.

149
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:55,020
He only has time for his reagents,
test tubes,

150
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:55,880
and his papers.

151
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:57,700
Ordinary men

152
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,380
usually put on the same disguise.

153
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:01,500
They make it as if they're not
into worldly desires.

154
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,300
But in reality,

155
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,460
they're ordinary men.

156
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,790
All of them are the same.

157
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,540
Why should we lie to you?

158
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:08,340
Do you think there's a benefit to it?

159
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,400
Of course there is.

160
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:11,380
It can help your cousin to gain
a favorable impression before the wedding,

161
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:13,420
thus, making the elders like him.

162
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:20,540
I'm helping you out.

163
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,860
You're pulling the rug from under my feet.

164
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,390
I'm really helping you out.

165
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:25,740
Think about it.

166
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:28,220
Now, my grandparents

167
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,340
haven't managed to see your cousin yet.

168
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:31,600
We try our best to lower

169
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,659
our expectations

170
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,140
and we try to badmouth him.

171
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,940
So, when they meet him in person,

172
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,700
they'll find he's better than what they have expected,

173
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,780
then the wedding will proceed smoothly, right?

174
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:40,540
If

175
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,500
you raise their expectations of him too high,

176
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,300
they'll expect too much from him,

177
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,300
and find all kinds of faults with him

178
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,420
when they see him.

179
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:47,620
Why should we do so?

180
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:48,260
Am I right?

181
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:52,380
This little girl.

182
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:53,540
Look at that lass.

183
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:02,540
Look at you.

184
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:05,670
Your dark circles can
cover the entire earth.

185
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,780
Finish your milk.

186
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:09,660
You better sleep well when you go back.

187
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,060
Don't stay up late again.

188
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,180
If not,

189
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,300
your custom wedding dress will be wasted.

190
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,380
Alright, Mom.

191
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:16,580
By the way,

192
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,300
your aunt told me

193
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,860
that during the wedding ceremony,

194
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:20,660
the parents of both parties

195
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:21,980
need to give their speeches.

196
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:25,180
Do we need to give a speech
during the engagement banquet?

197
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,100
I have no idea.

198
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,580
I forgot to ask him about that.

199
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:28,710
I'm inexperienced.

200
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,360
If you're inexperienced,

201
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:33,710
that means I'm inexperienced as well.

202
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:36,860
This is the only time
I'm marrying off my daughter.

203
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:39,620
After you go back,

204
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,470
ask your future mother-in-law

205
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,700
and see when she's free.

206
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,740
We need to arrange for a meeting.

207
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,500
We need to be familiar with each other.

208
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,780
They're our future in-laws.

209
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,140
We need to face them
for the rest of our lives.

210
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:51,800
We must have a good start to it.

211
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:00,540
[Zhousheng Chen]

212
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,090
I'm downstairs.

213
00:08:59,090 --> 00:08:59,820
Don't worry.

214
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,020
He's here.

215
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:11,220
Over here.

216
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,380
Uncle, Aunt,

217
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,660
I've been quite busy
for the past few days.

218
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,660
That's why I had no time to visit you.

219
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:22,900
That's fine.

220
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:25,190
Shi Yi had explained everything to us.

221
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,840
Dad, Mom, we'll leave now.

222
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,100
Drive safely, alright?

223
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:30,540
Goodbye.

224
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,180
Goodbye, Shi Yi.

225
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:31,780
Take care.

226
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:32,540
Goodbye, Chen.

227
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:33,140
Okay, bye.

228
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:56,420
I don't know.

229
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:57,820
We don't know

230
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:58,500
how that happened as well.

231
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,160
Precisely.

232
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:06,420
Uncle Lin is here.

233
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:08,300
Why would the Tang family
report this case?

234
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,180
They already received
two notices of critical illness.

235
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:10,940
It's quite serious.

236
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,740
What did you guys see on that day?

237
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:13,660
We don't know either.

238
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:14,220
We only knew

239
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,820
that Tong Jiaren and Tang Xiaofu
had an argument.

240
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,420
After that, Tang Xiaofu got hurt.

241
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:18,060
That's right.

242
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,590
Wenchuan was the one
who sent her to the hospital.

243
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:21,620
-Hello.
-Hello, mister.

244
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:22,980
-I'm the housekeeper here.
-We know nothing about it.

245
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,100
You can tell me what's going on.

246
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:24,650
Yes.

247
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:26,730
How

248
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:28,060
did it become like this?

249
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:28,860
Yeah.

250
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:32,750
Let's go.

251
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:58,060
Mr. Chen!

252
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:00,860
Your mother and your uncle

253
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,520
need to see you for something.

254
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,200
Wait for me in the room.

255
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,380
I'll be back soon.

256
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:17,950
Let's go.

257
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:18,760
Let's go in.

258
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:39,670
Why are you here?

259
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:41,620
I'm here to find Shi Yi

260
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:44,080
so that she can try
the custom wedding dress.

261
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,420
It's quite noisy over there.

262
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,020
Even I can't stand the noise.

263
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:51,580
Something happened to my family.

264
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:54,310
I guess the engagement banquet
will be canceled.

265
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,180
You're back?

266
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,580
Sorry for waking you up.

267
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,780
I've never gotten the chance
to ask you this.

268
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:10,910
Is voice acting fun?

269
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:13,940
It's pretty interesting.

270
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:16,600
But you need to be very good
at imagining things.

271
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,430
For example?

272
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:21,300
For example,

273
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,500
the recording engineer
often tells me this.

274
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,340
Miss Shi Yi,

275
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:26,860
you need to imagine

276
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,660
that you're the one walking in the rain.

277
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:29,820
You're the one who fell out of love.

278
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,480
You need to cry without tears.

279
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:33,900
Back then, I felt pretty helpless.

280
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,100
When actors are performing,

281
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:35,900
they can refer to other actors.

282
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,060
For me, I can only look at my script

283
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,190
and the microphone.

284
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:41,320
I need to imagine how it feels like
to cry without tears.

285
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:45,980
Are you not used to

286
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:48,070
being with a person like me?

287
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,420
A little bit.

288
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:54,870
I'm afraid something might pop up.

289
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:56,900
Just like what happened at the gate
in the afternoon.

290
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,560
I don't know what was going on.

291
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,980
And I don't know
what I can do to help you.

292
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:04,380
It's Tang Xiaofu,

293
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:07,020
the wife of my cousin
whom you've seen before.

294
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:08,220
She was hospitalized

295
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,680
ever since that incident.

296
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:11,620
Last night,

297
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:13,860
the doctor gave us

298
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,720
two notices of critical illness.

299
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,700
How is she now?

300
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,780
It's not optimistic.

301
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:23,860
She only stayed here

302
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,140
because of the engagement banquet.

303
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,500
But she got into an accident.

304
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,560
Even now, her life is still in danger.

305
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:30,220
Today,

306
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,940
the people from her mother's side are here.

307
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,470
They had a heated argument.

308
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,020
The cops came just now

309
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,180
because the Tang Family

310
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,340
reported the case to the police.

311
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:40,600
They said someone was trying to harm her.

312
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,380
So...

313
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:53,260
So, after my mother's
careful considerations,

314
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:57,160
she plans to cancel
the engagement banquet.

315
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,220
Sorry, Shi Yi.

316
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:06,540
Seems like I've been apologizing to you

317
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:07,470
quite often.

318
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,820
I'm making myself look like a fraud.

319
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:24,300
There's no way we can hold a banquet

320
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,560
after something like this had happened.

321
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:30,020
Actually,

322
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,180
my parents aren't that hard to convince.

323
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,780
The problem is they brought
my grandparents to Zhenjiang

324
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:35,580
because of our engagement.

325
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,780
And my uncle and aunt are also here.

326
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:39,260
I'm afraid they might be unhappy.

327
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:40,580
I'll return home tomorrow

328
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:41,840
and explain it to them.

329
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,880
I should be the one who's upset

330
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,340
after our engagement has been canceled.

331
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:51,600
You should think of a way
to make it up to me

332
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,020
instead of apologizing.

333
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,080
Make it up to you?

334
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:00,990
Teach me how to do so.

335
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:03,700
Professor Zhousheng,

336
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,160
do you need me to teach you?

337
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,020
I think so.

338
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:10,460
No matter what I do,

339
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:12,060
it doesn't necessarily

340
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:12,920

I didn't sleep at all.

Did you really sleep well until morning?

346
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,700
Will you be happy

I didn't sleep until morning.

349
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:03,860
You're responsible for directing them.

350
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:04,900
Put them into the car.

Chen,

356
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:24,990
your mother had given us instructions

357
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,220
about your engagement banquet.

358
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,740
We've paid them.

359
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,460
They will leave this afternoon.

360
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,420
We've canceled all of the food.

361
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:57,780
Hurry up.

362
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:10,110
Have you taken your breakfast?

363
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:12,860
I'll ask them to
prepare something for you.

364
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,380
I plan to hold the engagement banquet

365
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:15,700
in Shanghai.

366
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:20,140
We only need the elders from both sides
to attend the banquet.

367
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,460
So, I hope you can

368
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:23,820
spare some time

369
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:26,000
to meet their parents officially

370
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:27,680

here before?

You'll be upset if I tell you the truth.

I'll be upset

I'm sure you thought

382
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,140
it was a poignant story.

383
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:29,010
You thought your mother was rejected by my family,

marry into the family,

Isn't that so?

Of course not.

than you.

There are some ingredients

It's a waste for you to throw it away.

that his wife might run away
because she was angry at him.

They have the right to be angry.

511
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:12,500
Pour Chen some tea as well.

512
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:13,790
Alright.

513
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:21,180
Alright.

514
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:28,540
Actually, we're here today because...

515
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:30,140
Let me break the news to them.

516
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,100
Lately,

517
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:37,180
something happened to my family.

518
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:40,060
My cousin's wife has been experiencing
preterm labor.

519
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:41,320
Her life was in danger.

520
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:44,100
Now, she's still in the hospital.

521
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:46,600
She hasn't regained consciousness yet.

522
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:48,540
Now,

523
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:50,820
my family is in chaos.

524
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:53,740
So my mother

525
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:57,940
wants to postpone our engagement banquet.

526
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:04,420
It's my family's fault

527
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,480
to change the date.

528
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:07,620
I'm here today

529
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,740
to explain our current situation

530
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:11,380
to you.

531
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:14,180
And I want to apologize to you.

532
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:16,500
I'm sorry.

533
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,080
So that's the case.

534
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:31,180
Chen,

535
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:34,150
I'm sure you didn't wish for

536
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:36,620
something like that to happen to your family.

537
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:38,700
There's no need for you to blame yourself.

538
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:39,140
Yeah.

539
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,900
Family trouble is unavoidable.

540
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:42,500
It's fine.

541
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:44,580
Yeah.

542
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:46,100
Our family

543
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:47,950
doesn't have the tradition

544
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:49,380
to hold an engagement banquet.

545
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,340
When Shi Yi's father

546
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:51,340
told us about it,

547
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:52,620
we just took it

548
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:56,060
as a relaxing trip to Zhenjiang.

549
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:58,180
We're here just to see our children.

550
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:59,260
I think

551
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,900
it's enough for the elders
of both families

552
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,220
to have a meal together.

553
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:05,280
Yeah, we should have a meal together.

554
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,020
You see, your uncle and I

555
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,900
have applied for a four-day leave.

556
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,760
After you go back, ask your mother

557
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,230
and discuss it with her.

558
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,060
We will

559
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:16,500
work around your schedule.

560
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,460
What do you think?

561
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:19,390
Yeah, we will work around her time.

562
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,020
My mother...

563
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:35,180
Don't tell me

564
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:37,230
your mother doesn't want to see us.

565
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:48,420
Why should we proceed with the engagement

566
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:50,350
if his mother despises our family?

567
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,580
Parents of both families

568
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:04,620
should have met with each other
before you proceed with the engagement.

569
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:07,420
My brother and sister-in-law thought they lived far away from you,

570
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:08,620
so they said nothing.

571
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:10,740
But now, the banquet is canceled

572
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:12,500
because of your family matter.

573
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,360
Considering the circumstances,

574
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:15,340
your parents

575
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:16,900
should book a restaurant,

576
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:19,300
explain the situation, and apologize to us

577
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:20,740
instead of sending you here

578
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:22,300
in hopes of resolving this issue.

579
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,260
Uncle,

580
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:24,790
that isn't the case.

581
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:27,140
Their family is quite complicated.

582
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:29,800
Every family gets some complicated issues.

583
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,340
You shouldn't be impolite

584
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:34,580
to your future in-laws.

585
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:36,500
Later,

586
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:37,740
I'll explain the situation
to you guys in private.

587
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:38,670
No need for that.

588
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:41,400
We'll be family in the future.

589
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:43,880
We shouldn't hide anything
from each other.

590
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:44,980
Sorry.

591
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,020
My mother

592
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:49,220
wasn't unsatisfied with your family.

593
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,750
She's unsatisfied with me.

594
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:54,940
My mother and I

595
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:57,400
are the causes of our every conflict.

596
00:29:58,980 --> 00:29:59,700
Sorry.

597
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:20,920
Have a seat.

598
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,900
Actually, I can understand why

599
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,500
your uncle was so furious

600
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:33,940
about it.

601
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:35,700
He's just afraid that you might suffer

602
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,500
when you marry into that family.

603
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:39,740
I understand.

604
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:43,500
He's in conflict with his mother.

605
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:44,340
That's why

606
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,960
he couldn't persuade his mother
to meet you.

607
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:54,850
Shi Yi,

608
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:56,600
I don't need you

609
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,420
to marry into a great family.

610
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:00,820
If you're not used

611
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,900
to a family like that,

612
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:04,790
you can still change your mind.

613
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:06,700
To be honest with you,

614
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:07,860
youngsters nowadays

615
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:10,920
treat their marriages and divorces
like child's play.

616
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:13,060
You two just got engaged to each other.

617
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:14,980
You still have the time and chance

618
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:17,100
to think twice about your marriage.

619
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:19,180
Although

620
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:20,580
I do like that boy,

621
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:23,220
I really hope

622
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:27,420
you could live as an equal
when you marry into another family.

623
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:29,940
Mom, I understand.

624
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:33,190
I will surely take good care of myself.

625
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:37,780
If you have the chance,

626
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:40,380
you should visit his relative
in the hospital.

627
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:06,100
Hello?

628
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:07,440
Hello, Professor.

629
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:09,280
I've published my thesis.

630
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:11,960
Congratulations.

631
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:14,150
They ask me to take them a meal.

632
00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:14,880
I'm thinking

633
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:15,960
to rent an entire cab

634
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:18,420
so that we can attend
your engagement banquet in Zhenjiang.

635
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:20,500
I've witnessed your love journey
together with Miss Shi

636
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,060
from the start till the end.

637
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:24,020
So, I must never miss out

638
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:26,280
on your engagement banquet and wedding.

639
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:28,980
The engagement banquet

640
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:29,940
is canceled.

641
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:31,380
Canceled?

642
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:32,540
But why?

643
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,340
Did Shi Yi change her mind?

644
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:38,620
Shi Yi and I are doing great.

645
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:39,660
There's no problem

646
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:40,990
with our relationship.

647
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:43,220
That's great to hear.

648
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:45,860
But you'll go on a business trip soon.

649
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,690
Won't you feel insecure

650
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:49,560
after your engagement banquet was canceled like this?

651
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:51,090
I feel very secure about it.

652
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:54,110
I'll hang up for now.

653
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:57,020
How was it?

654
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:00,480
My mother told me to ditch you.

655
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:07,340
You must be afraid, right?

656
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:08,660
I told you it would be best for me
to return here by myself.

657
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:10,590
But you insisted on coming with me.

658
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:15,260
What do you want to do now?

659
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:16,790
I want to make you happy.

660
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:20,860
Our family is the one
who canceled the engagement banquet.

661
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:22,860
Why are you trying to make it up to me?

662
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:24,950
Because you're more upset than me.

663
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:27,980
Last time, you said

664
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:29,580
there was a mountain path
which was very steep.

665
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:31,040
You didn't bring me there.

666
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:33,120
Let's go for a drive today.

667
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:38,740
Sure.

668
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:39,790
Let's go.

669
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:11,719
How do you feel?

670
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:12,380
Do you feel better

671
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:13,340
after our drive?

672
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:16,620
I think so.

673
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:19,550
Let's go.

674
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:21,980
I'll bring you to have something nice.

675
00:34:23,219 --> 00:34:24,100
What is it?

676
00:34:24,699 --> 00:34:25,500
It's a secret.

677
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,060
In the past, my mother

678
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:40,380
brought her students here
for their training.

679
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:41,260
It was during summer break back then.

680
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:42,260
