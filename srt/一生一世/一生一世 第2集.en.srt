but you haven't typed a word.

8
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:18,360
What's so important

9
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:21,680
that you are this

10
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,600
cautious about it?

11

Just a girl I recently met.

14

I've just met her,

15
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:35,400
and I've only seen her three times by chance.

16
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,280
Is she the kind that would marry you?

17
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,400
I notice

18
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,440
that when it comes to my marriage,

19
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,240
you are more anxious than anybody else.

20
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,480
She came to Xi'an for a trip.

21
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,760
She'll leave the day after tomorrow.

22

27

28

My suggestion,

29

30

31

That's what normal people would do.

32

38
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,200
the Junior Prince of Nanchen

39
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,280
only had one soul mate,

40

the crown princess.

42
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,000
It was said that

43
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,160
after he died, the crown princess

44
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,280
jumped off a building and died for love.

45
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,960
She may have jumped off the library

46

or the city wall.

47
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,480

It took you quite a while to finally get on.

It was the first time that I had taken a bus.

I didn't expect it'd be that crowded.

to call us a cab.

Yes.

You can get a very nice view of the city standing up there.

Most importantly, you can feel the history of that place.

348
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,240
I want to look around a little more.

349
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:06,880
May I?

350
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,000
Then let's

351
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,560
go to dinner

352
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,760
after touring the lab.

353
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,680
This way please.

354
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,760
Miss Shi Yi.

355
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:26,920
Instead of wine, I'll use tea

356
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:27,960
to make a toast to you!

357
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:28,720
Thank you!

358
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,120
Miss Shi Yi.

359
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,360
What do you do?

360
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,480
I'm a dubber.

361
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,080
Oh, I've heard about this job.

362
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,320
It's a very popular vocation nowadays!

363
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,960
I watched a TV program

364
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,320
where they invited dubbers as guests

365
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:41,920
or interviewed

366
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,840
the dubbers.

367
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,000
That's right!

368
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,480
I've watched that program before.

369
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:45,960
You didn't eat much.

370
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,240
In every episode, they invited...

371
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,520
You've been talking with them.

372
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,880
You didn't see that I ate a lot.

373
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,080
Full?

374
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:54,720
Yes.

375
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,280
They all have appealing voices.

376
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,200
Excuse me for a moment.

377
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:00,480
Making them more charming.

378
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:01,640
Exactly.

379
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:02,920
Miss Shi Yi.

380
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,080
What works have you dubbed for in the past?

381
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,640
I did a lot of documentaries.

382
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,160
I rarely dub dramas.

383
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,640
But this year I dubbed

384
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,360
a new drama named One and Only.

385
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,040
Have you watched that?

386
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:12,920
Yes.

387
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,720
Sir, do you need a receipt?

388
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:16,880
No need. Thanks.

389
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,120
Professor Zhousheng.

390
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,120
I've told you

391
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:20,960
that the meal is on me.

392
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,520
It's fine.

393
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,360
It's on me.

394
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,160
Miss Shi Yi.

395
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,880
Are you his girlfriend?

396
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,520
No.

397
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:36,920
Careful about what you say.

398
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:37,480
I heard

399
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,120
Professor Zhousheng has a fiancee.

400
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,280
I'm sorry, Miss Shi Yi.

401
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,240
I didn't know that.

402
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,240
It's fine.

403
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,360
I still have things to do. I have to go now.

404
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:02,960
Let me take you back.

405
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:03,720
It's okay.

406
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:04,880
I can easily get a ride.

407
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,600
It's already late.

408
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,960
It's not safe for you to go back alone.

409
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:12,960
Sorry, guys!

410
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:13,960
I have to leave now.

411
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,760
Bye-bye, Miss Shi Yi.

412
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,040
See you next time!

413
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,160
Bye.

414
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,240
I heard

415
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,280
the conversation between you and my students

416
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,640
at the restaurant.

417
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,840
They misunderstood the situation.

418
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:50,960
It's not true.

419
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,960
I am thinking about getting married,

420
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,160
but I haven't found the one I want to marry yet.

421
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,520
Okay, I'll head in.

I do not believe in it.

432
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:35,960
But

433
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,080

Hope you don't mind.

471
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,560
I believe you.

472
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,840
It's fate that brings

473
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,480
people together.

474
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:55,840
It's really not like

475
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,520
something he would say.

476
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,120
So,

477
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,760
you'll leave tomorrow, huh?

478
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,680
I have a lot of work waiting for me.

479
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,720
I have to go back.

480
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,680
Could you please

481
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,000
give me your

482
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,240
phone number?

483
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:13,760
Then when I

484
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,440
don't have internet access,

485
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,160
I can at least call you.

486
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,560
It's okay if you mind it.

487
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,200
I don't mind!

488
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:28,880
But you don't have a cell phone,

489
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,440
and I didn't bring pen and paper.

490
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:32,880
Wait a sec!

491
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:33,960
It's okay.

492
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,240
Just tell me.

493
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,240
I can remember it.

494
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,280
13141152099.

495
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,200
Got it.

496
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,360
Then I'm leaving.

497
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,040
Careful on your way back.

498
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:52,840
Okay.

499
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,160
Can't sleep?

500
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,080
Then let's stay up.

501
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,360
We have an early flight tomorrow anyway.

502
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,440
If someone tells you

503
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,640
that he's thinking about getting married

504
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,360
but he hasn't found the one he wants to marry,

505
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,720
how would you interpret it?

506
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,280
I want to get married,

507
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,840
but I haven't found my Miss Right.

508
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,440
He said that to you?

509
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,840
It's a good thing.

510
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,480
I think it's his confession to you!

511
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,040
Is it?

512
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,600
I don't think so.

513
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,320
You sure are happy about it!

514
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,040
Stop pretending!

515
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,240
Stop pretending!

516
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:57,320
Now,

517
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,680
let me analyze for you

518
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,360
what Professor Zhousheng is thinking about.

Before I came back,

691
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,080
I'd been working on something.

692
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,760
I think you've all heard of it.

We have.

694
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,120
It's an investment meeting, right?

695
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,160
It's a good thing.

696
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:03,480
Yea.

697
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:04,800
But

698
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,240
no one here has stated their position on

699
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,840
whether you'd join or not.

700
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:31,040
Why are you all looking at me?

701
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,280
Chen is the future head

702
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,560
of this family.

703
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,000
You should all

704
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,520
listen to him.

705
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:38,360
Right?

706
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,560
In recent years,

707
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:45,840
we've been

708
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,680
investing in overseas projects,

709
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,520
like buying properties

710
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,160
and utility companies.

711
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,480
This has already shaken

712
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:53,920
the foundation of our family business.

713
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:55,680
For generations,

714
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,480
our family

715
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,320
has always had our foundations of national industries

716
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,840
rooted in China

717
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,360
no matter

718
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,920
in times of prosperity or decline.

719
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,280
The key purpose for next month's

720
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,600
investment meeting

721
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,040
is to attract investors

722
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,240
to develop the domestic manufacturing sector.

723
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,520
As the host of the meeting,

724
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,360
we'll announce then that we are going

725
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,640
to redirect our investment funds

726
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,040
to domestic manufacturing.

727
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,280
That's why I hope I can

728
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:27,760
get your

729
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,560
full support.

730
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,040
Chen,

731
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,880
you've just come back.

732
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,680
There's no rush.

733
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,160
Take it slow.

734
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:48,840
Okay?

735
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:49,840
Yeah.

736
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,880
You just came back. Have some rest.

737
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,720
Regarding this matter,

738
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,480
it won't be too late to make a decision

739
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:57,920
until you and your uncle reach an agreement.

740
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,280
Exactly!

741
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,320
Since we've made a public announcement

742
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,160
that we'll hold an investment meeting,

743
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,720
then we must go through with it.

744
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:07,600
Moreover,

745
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,080
this is the first thing that Chen

746
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,640
is doing after coming back.

747
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,240
I, for one, will give

748
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,480
my full support.

749
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:17,560
However,

750
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:18,560
this meeting seems

751
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,000
more of a show

752
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,360
than of substance for our family.

753
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,760
Chen, you've just come back.

754
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,280
Take some rest first.

755
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:29,920
Some decisions

756
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,280
can't be made

757

overnight.

758

from here to Shanghai?

766
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,280
Driving during the night would take longer.

767
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,560
Four hours.

768

We'd get to Shanghai at about 11:00 p.m.
