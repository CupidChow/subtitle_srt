You sleeping in the living room

00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,680
will make it look like we're having a fight.

7
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,610
Grandma might have the wrong idea.

[Zhousheng Chen]

9
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:13,880
I could say that

10
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,480
I made you unhappy

11
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,230
and that I came out on my own.

12
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,480
Are you thirsty?

13
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,230
You are ruining my image by doing this.

14
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:49,960
No, I am not.

15
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:52,250
You said you made me angry.

16
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:52,760
Doesn't that imply

17
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,000
I have a bad temper?

18
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,460
My grandma won't think like that.

19
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,690
I'll sleep on the left side and you on the right.

20
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:02,620
We'll have our backs to each other.

21
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,420
Come on up here.

22
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:56,040
This is the place

23
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:58,290
you lived in when you were young?

24
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,480
So, at that time,

25
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,290
you and your grandma

26
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:04,680
had separate rooms?

27
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,200
Yes.

28
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,520
So, you started to live here

29
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,720
from a very early age.

30
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:11,760
Yeah.

31
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,000
It must've been very tiring for your grandma

32
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,260
to send you to and pick you up from school.

33
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:22,640
Zhousheng Chen,

34
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,920
apart from "yes, yeah",

35
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,100
do you have any other answers?

36
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,320
I noticed this when we

37
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,200
started calling each other.

38
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,100
You would only answer what I ask.

39
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:45,050
If not, you would just keep quiet.

40
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,920
It's just,

41
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:49,640
I don't know

42
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,040
what to talk to you about.

43
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:06,700
Why did you get up?

44
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:08,870
Let's have a chat.

45
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:12,520
How?

46
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,360
By sitting up and talking.

47
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,090
What would you normally talk about

48
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,850
when you are with your students?

49
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:25,500
Or,

50
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:26,680
when you were still in school

51
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,920
and was having a meal in the canteen.

52
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,580
You gotta talk when you are having a meal, right?

53
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,280
I don't usually talk

54
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,480
when I am eating.

55
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,050
Except when

56
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,320
it is about work.

57
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:41,159
If you keep this up,

58
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:42,960
the conversation would die out.

59
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:49,310
I mean, I, um,

60
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:51,909
I am really not a big fan of talking while eating.

61
00:05:51,909 --> 00:05:54,170
But I do enjoy listening to other people.

62
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,659
When I visited

63
00:05:56,659 --> 00:05:58,120
other schools in the past,

64
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,260
I would always enjoy

65
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:00,420
mealtime.

66
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,140
That's because the teachers

67
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,220
were all from

68
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:04,780
different fields.

69
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,140
Although mealtime was short,

70
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,960
I would always learn a lot.

71
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:16,820
I had a pretty boring life in the past.

72
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:19,780
I spent almost 15 to 16

73
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,140
hours

74
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:23,700
in the lab.

75
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:26,460
And only returned to the dorm at midnight.

76
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,380
When the sun was out, I was back in the lab again.

77
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,980
That's how it was in the past.

78
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:31,980
I didn't want to

79
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,800
bore you with

80
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,110
talks about my work.

81
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,230
But I'm not knowledgeable

82
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,260
in other fields.

83
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:42,909
We could just chit chat.

84
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,360
Chit chat?

85
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:48,320
Like what?

86
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,580
Like, what did you eat today?

87
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,860
Or, how was your day?

88
00:06:55,409 --> 00:06:56,500
We could even talk about the weather.

89
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,780
You name it.

90
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:59,580
This way, we could have more conversations

91
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,310
and I'll get to know you better.

92
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,300
Take another example.

93
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:06,080
The dish the aunty made today was a bit salty

94
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:07,900
and I had to drink a lot of water.

95
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:10,660
Yeah, it was a bit salty.

96
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,570
If the food is too salty,

97
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:14,370
it's bad for your blood vessels.

98
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,050
I will remind her tomorrow.

99
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:17,310
Why is it bad?

100
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,470
If there is enough nitric oxide

101
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:20,930
inside a person's body,

102
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:22,140
it will make the blood vessels

103
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:24,180
softer and more relaxed.

104
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:26,470
In other words, better blood flow.

105
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:28,200
If a person consumes too much salt,

106
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,530
it will hinder the release of nitric oxide

107
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:32,960
and affect the dilation of blood vessels.

108
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,230
Sure enough,

109
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,780
our conversations turn serious after a while.

110
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:42,260
I suppose it would be really hard

111
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,320
to gossip with you.

112
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,820
I'll go close the window.

113
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,240
No, it's okay.

114
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,690
It's quite comfortable to sleep

115
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:58,950
with the sound of rain.

116
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:01,080
You might catch a cold this way.

117
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,980
I have the quilt and you, right?

118
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:06,670
Have a good night.

119
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,200
Don't you need the covers?

120
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:36,419
I am not cold.

121
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:49,500
Shi Yi,

122
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:53,740
thank you.

123
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:56,620
What for?

124
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:00,900
I should be the one trying to

125
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,180
make you happy.

126
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,500
Yet, throughout the day,

127
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,030
you seemed to be the one putting in the effort.

128
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,340
I realize sometimes

129
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,060
you can be really honest.

130
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:25,060
Why aren't you saying anything?

131
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,100
Zhousheng Chen.

132
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:59,540
Turn around.

133
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,940
I want to look at you.

134
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:03,870
Turn around?

135
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:19,930
Like this?

136
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:22,430
Turn to face me.

137
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:40,540
Like this?

138
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:44,360
Good night.

139
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:47,360
Good night.

140
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:31,020
Did I wake you up?

141
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,100
It's okay, Grandma.

142
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,700
I am used to getting up early.

143
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:39,260
Grandma,

144
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:43,060
I want to ask you a favor.

145
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:44,630
What is it?

146
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:46,030
Tell me.

147
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,980
I will do whatever

148
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:49,380
I can.

149
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:56,940
I want to get the marriage certificate with Shi Yi.

150
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:03,380
Good, very good.

151
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,940
Very, very good.

152
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:24,900
[1 yuan]

153
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,520
Where did this come from?

154
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:57,500
Did you drop some money

155
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,190
while sleeping last night?

156
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,300
I found a coin on the bed.

157
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:04,540
[1 yuan]

158
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,860
You found money on the bed?

159
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,140
It dropped out

160
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,540
when I was making the bed.

161
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:15,620
How lucky.

162
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,780
Is your household registration permit

163
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:23,780
with your parents

164
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,020
or yourself?

165
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:26,020
With me.

166
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:28,870
I changed the permit when I bought the apartment.

167
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:35,720
Come over here.

168
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:44,380
Here.

169
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,100
Today,

170
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,940
I want to ask you something

171
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,680
in front of my grandma.

172
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:55,900
Sure.

173
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:00,380
I want to

174
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,620
have our marriage registered first

175
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:04,220
and after that, we can make up

00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:54,420
I will ask someone to bring you breakfast

515
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:55,580
later on.

516
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:33,460
Are you not going in?

517
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:36,740
I'll go in later.

518
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:38,820
After they finished eating.

519
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,900
It won't be too late that way.

520
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:50,060
Uncle Lin, are you not going in?

521
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,300
I'll stay here with you for a bit.

522
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,140
Chen.

523
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:07,820
Grandma.

524
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:09,540
Why are you here?

525
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:12,820
I brought our grandma here just to help you.

526
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:22,740
Mother.

527
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:25,840
Mother.

528
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:27,670
I thought you already had breakfast?

529
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:29,020
-Grandma.
-Grandma.

530
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:32,960
Wenxing got up late.

531
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,650
She was afraid you might blame her,

532
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,240
that's why she brought me along.

533
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:40,540
Wan.

534
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:42,020
You have been

535
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:44,900
too hard on the kids.

536
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:48,420
Sit down, sit down.

537
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:49,620
Grandma, have a seat.

538
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:55,970
Well.

539
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:59,760
The kids in our family.

540
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:03,430
Today is totally worth it.

541
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:08,360
The second son got married first.

542
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:12,700
The eldest, also has a wife.

543
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:16,150
How time

544
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:18,460
flies.

545
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,940
Grandma, you're mistaken.

546
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:23,750
Chen has not married yet.

547
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:27,900
Well,

548
00:40:28,110 --> 00:40:29,940
according to tradition,

549
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:32,180
he is not yet engaged,

550
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:35,120
but he's almost there.

551
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:35,940
Isn't it?

552
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:38,420
Yes.

553
00:40:39,390 --> 00:40:40,420
Me and Shi Yi.

554
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:43,720
We already obtained our marriage certificate.

555
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:59,190
Congratulation, Chen.

556
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,440
That mountain villa.

557
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,960
They haven't been there yet, right?

558
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:08,620
No, they haven't.

559
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:12,870
Let's burn some incense there.

560
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:16,620
So that the whole family could get some luck.

561
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:21,380
Bring your two daughters-in-law.

562
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:23,740
And also have a vegan meal

563
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:25,840
in the villa.

564
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:28,460
Okay.

565
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,330
Let's eat, the food's getting cold.

566
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:31,100
Yeah, yeah.

567
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:32,460
Dig in, dig in.

568
00:41:32,770 --> 00:41:34,270
Let's eat.

569
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:37,520
Let's eat.

570
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:53,980
[Family of Book and Rituals]

571
00:41:58,260 --> 00:41:58,780
Shi Yi,

572
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:00,060
my mother wants you

573
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:01,660
to sit in the same car with us.

574
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:07,940
Go ahead.

575
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:24,120
Please get in, Miss Shi Yi.

576
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,960
People need time

577
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:39,620
to solve their differences.

578
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:41,780
Let them go.

579
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:44,380
After some disputes,

580
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:45,920
maybe in the future,

581
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,680
their relationship

582
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:49,690
will be stronger than ours.

583
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:52,780
Grandma,

584
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:55,420
thanks for coming by.

585
00:42:57,590 --> 00:42:59,100
No need to thank me.

586
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,380
Lian Sui told me

587
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:04,210
you were not staying in the same room with Shi Yi

588
00:43:04,210 --> 00:43:07,040
last night, huh?

589
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:11,300
Did the two of you fight?

590
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:20,080
The two of you were fine at my place.

591
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:23,800
What happened when you came back here?

592
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:25,820
Our relationship is great.

593
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:27,020
We're fine, Grandma.

594
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:28,780
Let's get in.

595
00:44:04,130 --> 00:44:05,060
Shi Yi,

596
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:07,740
I haven't had the chance to tell you

597
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:08,940
that you look pretty.

598
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:10,340
Thank you.

599
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:13,180
Ren.

600
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:15,620
You can't judge people based on how they look.

601
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:17,140
I have told you.

602
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:19,540
Don't indulge yourself in

603
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:20,660
beautiful things and other pleasures.

604
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:23,020
They can turn into things that rot your soul.

605
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:24,150
Don't you remember?

606
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:25,340
I do.

607
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:27,140
Lust and pleasure

608
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:28,540
will distort one's mind.

609
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:30,460
And we should never get addicted.

610
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:31,340
But Shi Yi being good-looking

611
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:32,620
is a hard fact.

612
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:34,620
Giving praise to something beautiful

613
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:35,750
and appreciating it

614
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:36,660
is also

615
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:38,220
something you taught me.

616
00:45:20,830 --> 00:45:22,760
I won't recognize

617
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:24,180
your marriage.

618
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:26,600
You should seriously think about

619
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:27,500
whether you want to insist on

620
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:29,420
staying with my son.

621
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:41,780
Here we are.

622
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:49,190
What did you two talk about?

623
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:51,140
Nothing much.

624
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:53,470
I don't think it's anything significant.

625
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:55,780
Let's go.
