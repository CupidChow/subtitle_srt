[Episode 12]

4
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,880
Just now in the hall,

5
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,610
I didn't see you offer incense.

6
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,120
I am an atheist.

7
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,820
But I believe in Buddhism, what should we do?

8
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,920
You have my full respect.

9
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,720
So, in your eyes,

10
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,040
what's Buddha like?

11
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,960
Benevolent, I guess.

12
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,079
The reason Buddha left his wife and children behind and pursued Buddhism

13
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:52,040
is because

14
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,360
he cares about everything on earth.

15
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,590
Is there any difference

16
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:59,050
with how you perceive him?

17
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,140
There are some differences.

18
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,000
Like what?

19
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:04,480
I think he likes me.

20
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:06,650
That's why he's always smiling at me.

21
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,320
What are you laughing about?

22
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,720
The eye sees what the mind wants to see.

23
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,400
I always see things

24
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,600
from the positive side.

25
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,260
Which means I am living a happy

26
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,340
and positive life.

27
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,760
Makes sense.

28
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,480
Am I wrong?

29
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,280
There is no right and wrong.

30
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,320
Only the different perspectives.

31
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:26,890
Let's go to the villa

32
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:28,320
and wait for them there.

33
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,240
Did you finish?

34
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:41,640
Old Madam.

35
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:45,240
The guests we invited today are all sitting next door.

36
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:47,810
They all finished eating, right?

37
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,140
They are now having tea.

38
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:51,680
Mr. Feng heard that

39
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,120
the eldest son of Mr. Zhousheng Wen

40
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,520
is here with his fiancée.

41
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,520
So he wrote a piece of calligraphy

42
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,850
and was hoping to present it to Miss Shi Yi.

43
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:03,950
He's one of my father's friends.

44
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,320
This is hard to come by.

45
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,720
Mr. Feng's works are priceless.

46
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,000
Only his best friends

47
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,420
could enjoy his works.

48
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:17,050
The guests here today have been

49
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,519
friends of our family for generations.

50
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,100
We should all go and say hello.

51
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,660
Let's go.

52
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,520
My strokes are not as good as before after years of idling.

53
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,180
Your calligraphy is getting better and better.

54
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,400
Feng.

55
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,920
Mrs. Zhou, how are you?

56
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,520
I am fine.

57
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,080
Is he the eldest son of Zhousheng Wen?

58
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:06,840
Chen?

59
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:08,640
Yeah.

60
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,640
This is Shi Yi,

61
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:13,120
his wife.

62
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,660
Nice to meet you, Mr. Feng.

63
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:16,600
Is she his wife already?

64
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,240
Wait.

65
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,960
When was the wedding ceremony?

66
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,680
Why were we not invited?

67
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,520
Young people are impatient

68
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,160
so they registered their marriage first.

69
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,320
The ceremony is yet to happen.

70
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,550
Oh, that explains it.

71
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:30,240
Mrs. Zhou,

72
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,810
I haven't taken up my brush for a long time.

73
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,560
It only occurred to me

74
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,480
when I heard about your marriage.

75
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,880
Thus, I wrote a few characters.

76
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,340
Here, come and have a look.

77
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:40,750
Come and have a look.

78
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:46,280
Gentle breeze blowing softly, what a perfect match.

79
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:48,610
I first wrote “what a perfect match”

80
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:50,320
indicating your marriage.

81
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,120
After thinking for a bit,

82
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,220
I felt that these four characters

83
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,980
[Gentle breeze blowing softly]

84
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,560
were the most suitable words in a study.

85
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,520
That's why I wrote both of them down.

86
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,560
Thank you, Feng.

87
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,360
Mrs. Zhou,

88
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,140
Let's sit down and have a chat.

89
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,120
Okay, after you.

90
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,680
I don't have anything with me

91
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,880
to return as a gift.

92
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,810
What should I do?

93
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:17,680
It's okay.

94
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:18,680
Mr. Feng also

95
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,880
did this on the spot.

96
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,440
If you really want to give him something,

97
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,480
it will be okay if I sent him something

98
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,280
I had picked out

99
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,280
from the library.

100
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,920
Do you take your family library as a treasure-house?

101
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,780
Having everything you want in it.

102
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,200
Grandpa Feng.

103
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,600
I heard from aunty

104
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:36,200
that your calligraphy works are priceless.

105
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,580
My drawings are not as good as yours

106
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,430
but I still want to draw something for you.

107
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:41,280
I was wondering if Mr. Feng would mind.

108
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,080
Sounds great! I would be lucky to have a newlywed

109
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:46,010
gift me a piece of drawing.

110
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,840
Miss Shi, please.

111
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,320
Call me Shi Yi.

112
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,159
Shi Yi.

113
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,760
What a beautiful name.

114
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,220
Please.

115
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,340
Let me help you.

116
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,640
Mr. Feng. I am done.

117
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,400
Please.

118
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:19,920
Please.

119
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,240
Okay, let's have a look.

120
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,320
Check it out.

121
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,200
Great.

122
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:36,549
Good drawing.

123
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:40,440
You have found your treasure.

124
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:41,880
By the way,

125
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,720
where are you holding your wedding ceremony?

126
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,520
Zhenjiang.

127
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,480
Zhenjiang?

128
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,120
Then I will be

129
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,880
expecting your invitation.

130
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,020
-Okay, we will definitely invite you.
-Okay, great.

131
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,480
Yes indeed.

132
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,570
Where did you learn how to draw?

133
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,160
I used to copy the works from masters

134
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,040
when I was little at home.

135
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,200
I would often

136
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,320
lock myself in the room

137
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,800
just because I liked this hobby.

138
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,930
I noticed it was a good way to kill time.

139
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:10,360
Then I guess

140
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,620
you're just talented.

141
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,360
I loved drawing the lotus flower when I was young.

142
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,960
I also practiced figure painting.

143
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,560
However,

144
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,560
my painting of people was never good.

145
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,890
Maybe I'm just bad at it.

146
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,840
Right, I recall telling you that story,

147
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,080
at the Guangzhou airport.

148
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,830
The heroin in the story was also the same.

149
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,800
She followed the male lead and learned how to draw,

150
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,880
yet she never drew any human figure.

151
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,340
And she was best at drawing the lotus flower.

152
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:31,280
She was actually drawing the lotus flower

153
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,810
to represent the male lead.

154
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,280
It's not that she couldn't draw him,

155
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,540
but she didn't dare to.

156
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,560
She was afraid of others finding out

157
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,560
that she has a crush on the male lead.

158
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,560
It that the reason why

159
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,200
you are such a big fan of

160
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,530
the story of the Junior Prince of Nanchen?

161
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,320
I almost forgot,

162
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:45,960
you told me

163
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,690
that you knew the story as well.

164
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:49,740
Where did you hear about his story?

165
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:51,580
He is in our family tree.

166
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,280
I am also named after him.

167
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,200
Does your family have that recorded? I want to have a look.

168
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,860
Sure. I'll look for it at home.

169
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:13,040
Wenchuan followed your instruction

170
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:14,560
and married Jiaren,

171
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,200
so you were happy about it.

172
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:20,900
Chen, however,

173
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,040
did not do what you wanted.

174
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:29,030
But you should have calmed down after a few days.

175
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,240
Why do you have to make it such a big deal?

176
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:35,180
Well, Tang Xiaofu is still in a coma.

177
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,880
Was I wrong to call off the banquet?

178
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,600
No, what you did was perfectly fine.

179
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:43,400
But your refusal to meet with Shi Yi's parents

180
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:45,120
is wrong.

181
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:48,890
At the end of the day,

182
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,160
you just don't want

183
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,840
Shi Yi to be your daughter-in-law.

184
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,800
I just don't want her to marry Chen.

185
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,170
Marriage is

186
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,840
all about affection.

187
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:04,780
There's no point in talking about influences.

188
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:07,560
Then what about you and Zhousheng Xing?

189
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,000
Well,

190
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,800
at...at that...

191
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,520

192

what happened between me and Zhousheng Xing.

194
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,480
Do you know how much I have done

195
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,040
so many years

196
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:18,920
to protect what Chen's father

197
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,480
had left for us.

198
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,720
Besides,

199
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:26,720
Zhousheng Xing has been running the family business for 20 years.

200
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,880
Do you think

201
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,880
he's gonna just simply hand over the whole thing

202
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,200
back to Chen?

203
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,600
I still have some capability

204
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,000
to protect Chen.

205
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,600
But what if I get tired one day

206
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,430
and could no longer help?

207
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,730
What if his second uncle turned against him?

208
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:44,320
Who's gonna help him then?

209
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:49,720
Let's be real for a minute.

210
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,640
Chen and I are not blood related.

211
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:54,360
In this family,

212
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,760
he doesn't have any real family.

213
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,600
Neither are you.

214
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:04,720
True, I am not.

215
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:08,200
His wife could be considered his family.

216
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,000
After we're gone, his wife would be

217
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,120
the person that takes care of him

218
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,580
and helps him wholeheartedly in the future.

219
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,960
I am helping him

220
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,320
by introducing him to a girl with a powerful family.

221
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,720

225
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,530

many times afterwards,

230
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,860

Those don't sound like good reasons.

00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,490
from today on,

346
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,690
I will be your representative.

347
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,880
You are not afraid that I would sell you out?

348
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:53,920
Will you?

349
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,100
You can't be too careful.

350
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:00,540
But you shouldn't suspect someone whom you trust, right?

351
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,080
Done.

352
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,440
Even though you're the one who signed this,

353
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:20,200
I feel like I've become a slave.

354
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,760
When are you going to set off?

355
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:24,870
Soon.

356
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,520
I will fly to Bremen this afternoon.

357
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,560
I was planning to let you

358
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,720
meet Shi Yi.

359
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,340
We have time in the future.

360
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:35,840
Well, see you in Bremen.

361
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:38,130
I will be staying there for 2 months.

362
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:38,820
Okay.

363
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,160
Yu Jin.

364
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,410
I got some good news for you.

365
00:18:58,530 --> 00:18:59,640
What good news?

366
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,040
Did your mother call you back

367
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,370
for another blind date?

368
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,880
What are you talking about?

369
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,360
Our teacher sent us

370
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,440
and his colleagues at Bremen an email,

371
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,900
saying that he's married.

372
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,720
He is married?

373
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,880
Who would send out mass email to colleagues

374
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,810
after getting married these days?

375
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:18,600
He's probably living in the last century.

376
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,210
Maybe his wife is someone formidable.

377
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:22,960
No.

378
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:24,880
I think our teacher is doing this on purpose

379
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,120
to show his wife.

380
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,280
Perhaps as a gesture of loyalty?

381
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,910
Very possible.

382
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,480
My mother asked me

383
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,630
when we will go home.

384
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:06,060
I am busy these days.

385
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:11,680
I am about to go back to Bremen.

386
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:13,230
I am only free this month.

387
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,960
It's better we do it this week.

388
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,600
We just got married

389
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,860
so we should go back for a few days.

390
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,180
My brother just left,

391
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,960
but you are already so eager to join him?

392
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,330
This has nothing to do with him.

393
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,840
My laboratory is also in Bremen

394
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,040
and you knew that.

395
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,960
You are my wife,

396
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:42,910
I thought I should clarify this.

397
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,680
We talked about this before our marriage

398
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,000
and you had no problem with

399
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,270
me working in Bremen.

400
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:54,480
We just got married.

401
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,320
Isn't it too soon for you to leave right now?

402
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,480
We should have a baby.

403
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,050
To make my mother happy.

404
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,720
I am not ready yet.

405
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:20,320
The reason why I married you

406
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:21,700
is because my mother believed

407
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,900
that my family owed your family a favor.

408
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,880
And you married me

409
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,360
to spite my brother.

410
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,360
Between you and I,

411
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,930
there is no need to put up an act.

412
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,760
If you don't want to get married.

413
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,820
Then why did you propose to me?

414
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,040
Because my mother liked you.

415
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:47,440
I thought after marrying you,

416
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,500
I could receive my mother's support.

417
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:53,110
But it looks like I was overthinking it.

418
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:55,780
My mother only cares about being fair.

419
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,000
She never cared about me.

420
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,810
Have a good journey.

421
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,240
I hope you can

422
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,300
win my brother's heart in Bremen.

423
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:13,840
If you succeed,

424
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,450
we can get a divorce.

425
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,460
How did you get in here?

426
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,640
Like usual.

427
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,440
You're already a grown-up

428
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,560
but you still climbed over the wall?

429
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,880
If my brother caught you,

430
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,200
he would have broken your legs.

431
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,040
He does not care

432
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,760
if you're the second eldest son of the Zhou family.

433
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,360
I don't mind my legs breaking

434
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,700
if it means seeing you.

435
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,320
Why did we break up?

436
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,080
I didn't want to get married so soon.

437
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,720
My father's will says

438
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,440
that only after marriage could we inherit the family wealth.

439
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,500
You said it before.

440
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,280
My mother signed

441
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,680
all the documents today.

442
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,940
Zhou family is now in my brother's hands.

443
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,330
He seems like a nice guy.

444
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,880
I don't know him very well.

445
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,000
But it looks like,

446
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,520
even if he took over the Zhou family,

447
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,860
he is not going to give you a hard time.

448
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,740
You don't understand the situation.

449
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,690
You are merely a tailor.

450
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,290
What would you know?

451
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:23,160
Yeah, I don't understand the situation.

452
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,560
So, would the second eldest son of the Zhou family

453
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,280
please climb over the wall to get out?

454
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,280
Quietly

455
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,040
and discreetly,

456
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:31,880
okay?

457
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:47,900
Little tailor,

458
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,100
would you still love me

459
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,960
if I get a divorce?

460
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,450
Zhousheng Chen.

461
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,080
I will keep this here.

462
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,080
It's not convenient for you to travel with.

463
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,480
I will put it in the bedside cupboard.

464
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,800
In case of emergency

465
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:22,840
and I am out on a business trip,

466
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,170
you can get it yourself.

467
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,520
Here, the house key.

468
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,080
Hong Xiaoyu still lives here.

469
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,920
It's not appropriate if I took the key, right?

470
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,400
She locks her room.

471
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,040
I am giving you the key to the front door

472
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,120
and my bedroom.

473
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,260
Let's go, I will walk you downstairs.

474
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,210
You'll walk me downstairs?

475
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,680
I just walked you up though.

476
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,410
And now you want to walk me down?

477
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,850
I will take out the trash on the way.

478
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:05,480
Take care.

479
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,570
Wait for my call.

480
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:08,240
I will.

481
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:11,800
Wait.

482
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,920
Calling three times a day

483
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,540
would be too troublesome.

484
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,880
Is it interfering with your work?

485
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,720
I can adjust the time

486
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,980
to make the phone call.

487
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,040
We are married now,

488
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,240
let's make it easier.

489
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,320
If you want to talk to me,

490
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,440
let me know in advance.

491
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,440
If I am available,

492
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,450
then we'll call.

493
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:30,840
Okay.

494
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:35,520
Bye.

495
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,400
Bye.

496
00:26:59,160 --> 00:26:59,720
Miss Shi.

497
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,560
The trash collection

498
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,760
is not here yet

499
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,000
at this time.

500
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,440
You got the time wrong.

501
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,970
The garbage bin will only be here at 6 o'clock.

502
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,520
Yes, I got the time wrong.

503
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,680
I have to go in now.

504
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,410
The is a perfect song

505
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,800
for this moment.

506
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:59,520
♫The day we met♫

507
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:03,450
♫Time froze♫

508
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:08,400
♫It's your smiling eyes♫

509
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,630
♫That made the hustle and bustle of the world gone♫

510
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,280
♫Every moment♫

511
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,160
I should've given her a hug.

512
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:21,290
♫Drives away the weariness of the past♫

513
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,370
♫Love spreads♫

514
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,080
A hug would be perfect.

515
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:27,240

♫One more day with you♫

517
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,680
She would also want me to hug her.

518
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:31,840
♫Love gets deeper♫

519
00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:33,990

♫Kissing through the long years♫

521
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,360
Why didn't I see him off

522
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,600
at the airport?

523

♫Wrapping love around my fingertips♫

524
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,880

♫Make a vow in silence♫

526
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,180

534
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,640
Chen.

535
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:08,020
I gotta tell you something.

536
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,360
Shi Yi has an admirer

537
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,620
called Wang Yingdong.

538
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:14,310
He is supposedly pretty talented and famous.

539
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:17,170
As someone experienced.

540
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:18,520
I need to warn you,

541
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,980
long-term long-distance relationship

542
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:21,750
is not ideal for marital stability.

543
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:22,760
You should get back as soon as possible.

544
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:25,760
You wouldn't want your wife's heart stolen by others.

545
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,120
You never got married.

546
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,050
So what experience do you have?

547
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:33,000
I was better than you

548
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:33,960
when I was young.

549
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,540
I have dating experience.

550
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,800
You, are merely luckier than me

551
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,000
to have met Shi Yi.

552
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:40,960
Otherwise,

553
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,810
I don't think anyone would've wanted you.

554
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,640
Am I wrong?

555
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:47,800
You're right.

556
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,640
My personality

557
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,760
is indeed not ideal for marriage.

558
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,640
No, no, no.

559
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,560
You are not a perfect date,

560
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:57,720
but perfect for marriage.

561
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:05,080
I hope that's what she thinks.

562
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,560
With the presence of a rival,

563
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,500
you can never take it lightly.

564
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:29,360
Did you eat them all?

565
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:37,020
Are you upset?

566
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:39,700
What happened?

567
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,610
The engagement banquet didn't go as planned?

568
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:46,980
Your family and their family

569
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:47,960
had a fight?

570
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,930
Or was his mother mean to you again?

571
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,400
The engagement banquet was cancelled.

572
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,720
Don't be sad, don't be sad, don't be sad.

573
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,880
We're okay.

574
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,920
That dumb chemistry professor?

575
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,040
You are a pretty girl,

576
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,040
we can easily find someone like him.

577
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,600
Seriously.

578
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,640
What?

579
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,680
You fooled me.

580
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,160
I am married.

581
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:38,520
To be more specific, we got our marriage certificate.

582
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:43,650
No wonder that day.

583
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,210
Yes, on that day.

584
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,240
Not bad, not bad.

585
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,160
You two are good.

586
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,320
I am still confused.

587
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,140
I haven't told my parents yet.

588
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,120
You haven't?

589
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,640
Zhousheng Chen said

590
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,480
he would go to visit them with me

591
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,440
after he comes back from his business trip.

592
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,900
That would be more formal.

593
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:05,960
True.

594
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,240
It would be better

595
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,020
if you two went back together.

596
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,560
I seriously want to know

597
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,120
what on earth

598
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,200
he did

599
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,880
to persuade you to get registered with him.

600
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,720
Nothing special.

601
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,160
It's exactly because of that,

602
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,120
and even seeming somewhat stupid,

603
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,320
that shows his sincerity.

604
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,020
My thoughts were in a mess at that time.

605
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:29,920
But I had a strong feeling

606
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,040
at that time.

607
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:32,440
If I didn't say yes,

608
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:34,050
I would definitely regret it

609
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:35,310
for the rest of my life.

610
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:40,880
Congrats, congrats.

611
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:42,680
A married girl.

612
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,440
I will tell you more about the story tonight.

613
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,560
Let's go to the supermarket first.

614
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,480
I just saw that the fridge was empty.

615
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,740
How did you manage to survive these days?

616
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:52,070
No matter how I lived through the past few days,

617
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:54,430
it was nowhere as exciting as yours.

618
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:57,550
Let me have a look.

619
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,320
What a big yellow diamond.

620
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,360
You're a married girl now.

621
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,560
You guys are raising that crab

622
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,000
like your child.

623
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,880
Even the crab eats better food than I do.

624
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:22,000
If you won't eat it,

625
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,480
then what's the point of keeping it?

626
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,920
Do crabs drink yogurt?

627
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,280
Are you talking to me?

628
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,120
I thought you were my friend.

629
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,280
I am sorry.

630
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,360
It's okay.

631
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,770
Why didn't you tell me you had left?

632
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,370
You caused me to embarrass myself.

633
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:18,500
I called you, you didn't respond.

634
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,239
I took that guy

635
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:19,880
as you.

636
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:22,000
I even asked a super embarrassing question.

637
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,199
Damn it.

638
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,800
I thought about it carefully.

639
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,980
I don't think crabs can drink yogurt.

640
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:39,880
That man has been following us

641
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,199
since we walked out of the supermarket.

642
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:41,639
Yeah.

643
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,679
Back at the supermarket,

644
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:46,150
what on earth did you say to him?

645
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:47,120
I simply asked him

646
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,480
if crabs drink yogurt?

647
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,489
I didn't even know what I was doing.

648
00:34:55,929 --> 00:34:57,040
What a coincidence.

649
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,500
You guys live here as well?

650
00:34:59,280 --> 00:34:59,960
Don't get me wrong.

651
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,120
I am not stalking you.

652
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,520
I rent an apartment here.

653
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:04,520
Bye.

654
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,280
Bye.

655
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,000
Does he really live here?

656
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,080
Let's go.

657
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:16,760
Seriously.

658
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,680
After receiving your marriage message from someone,

659
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:44,760
we moved away

660
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,890
and there is a surprise in the bedroom,

661
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,680
I wish you a happy wedding.

[Recording Studio]

696
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,090
Wipe your sweat.

697
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
It's 40 degrees right now

698
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:58,640
and there's no air-conditioner.

699
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,840
Are you not afraid of getting a heat stroke?

700
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,160
The air-conditioner broke down a few days ago

701
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,240
and it produces a lot of noise.

702
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,640
That's why we had to switch it off to record.

703
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:04,840
In the past when there was no air-conditioner,

704
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,800
our predecessors made it through,

705
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,840
didn't they?

706
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,280
Your scientist fiancé.

707
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:17,800
Married.

708
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,440
Okay, married.

709
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,000
Is there any difference?

710
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:23,280
Living separately immediately after getting your marriage certificate.

711
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,800
Of course, there is, we are legally married now.

712
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,320
Are you legally occupying him?

713
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,120
From his heart to his body.

714
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,600
Keep it down!

715
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:31,360
All right.

716
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,730
Let me ask you something serious then.

717
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:36,480
What's he doing there for two months?

718
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:39,320
To do

719
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:41,970
microanalysis and semi-micro analysis

720
00:38:41,970 --> 00:38:43,610
of Venus's surface.

721
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:46,080
You're bullying me because I'm not knowledgeable.

722
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:46,970
It's pretty normal if you don't understand what I said.

723
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:48,000
I made that up.

724
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:50,560
Honestly.

725
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:51,680
I never knew

726
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,080
that you fell in love with

727
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,730
a scientist

728
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,260
whose ambition is to work for the development of human beings.

729
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:57,200
This type of person

730
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,400
must regard the relation between men and women

731
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,730
as unimportant, right?

732
00:39:01,350 --> 00:39:02,080
Maybe.

733
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,680
Is he interesting?

734
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,080
Yeah.

735
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:06,650
What do you guys talk about?

736
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:07,520
Everything.

737
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,040
Starting from

738
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,460
the origins of humans?

739
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:11,800
And the reason

740
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,490
homo erectus disappeared.

741
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,040
I admire that.

742
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,080
But,

743
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,040
he happens to be my

744
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,440
favorite type.

745
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:20,520
When I read

746
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,840
historical materials, I would always imagine,

747
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,440
if I were to live in the ancient times,

748
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,400
I would definitely fall in love

749
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,530
with someone who cares for the people.

750
00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:29,300
As a man, you gotta do something

751
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,680
that has nothing to do with fame or love.

752
00:39:31,850 --> 00:39:33,130
Talking about love day and night,

753
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:34,190
that's not my type.

754
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:35,920
I don't like

755
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,640
talking about love all the time, either.

756
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:38,200
However, I prefer

757
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,600
a man who has no ambition.

758
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:40,600
Instead, loves his family,

759
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,800
loves kids.

760
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:43,120
In other words,

761
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:44,280
he needs to be a househusband after marriage

762
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,590
and take care of my family

763
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:47,650
so that I can be free to do my business.

764
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:49,520
This type really works for you.

765
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:51,260
[Miss Shi, the car has arrived.]

766
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,450
I gotta go,

767
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,240
something just happened at home.

768
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:57,920
Is it your own family

769
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,380
or your husband's family?

770
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,250
Take a guess.

771
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,660
It must be your husband's family.

772
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,050
A girl in the relationship.

773
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:14,640
Uncle Lin.

774
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,840
You can wait in the car with the air-conditioner.

775
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:17,840
It's scorching outside.

776
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,560
I am too old to feel the heat.

777
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,290
Let's go.

778
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:23,600
Thank you.

779
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,040
What are you

780
00:40:51,470 --> 00:40:52,560
gonna plant here?

781
00:40:54,330 --> 00:40:55,040
Maybe mint.

782
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,480
This is close to the living room.

783
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,810
Mint can repel insects.

784
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:00,120
It would be pretty much it

785
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,400
after all the furniture has been moved in

786
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,320
this week.

787
00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:05,410
This is from the old madam.

788
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:06,250
What is it?

789
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:10,020
[Happy]

790
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,200
She didn't want to buy them,

791
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,840
so, she made them.

792
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,130
I explained it to her

793
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,040
that we'll put it up after the house is done.

794
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:18,170
As it would be a waste if we put it up now.

795
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,400
But we won't be newly-weds

796
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,600
when we move in later, right?

797
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,320
It might be weird to put this up later.

798
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,980
Before the wedding ceremony,

799
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:27,280
you will remain as Miss Shi Yi.

800
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,080
You can admit that he is your husband

801
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,150
after the wedding banquet has been held

802
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:32,080
and the Xi character has been put up.

803
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:32,480
Okay.

804
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,450
Seeing him getting married

805
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,840
is the biggest wish of my life.

806
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,360
Thank you for accepting him.

807
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:42,640
You said it like

808
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:43,640
he is going to remain single

809
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:44,880
if he didn't meet me.

810
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:46,840
He's got

811
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,530
no sense of humor at all.

812
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,370
Only you could put up with that.

813
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,680
I think it's not bad.

814
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:55,880
Deep down in my heart,

815
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,800
he is like half a son to me.

816
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:58,800
You are likewise

817
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,600
to be my half-daughter-in-law.

818
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:01,680
I thought about

819
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,210
doing something for you

820
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,480
to make up for the time when he is not around.

821
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:06,200
What a coincidence.

822
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:07,760
I'll be busy for the next two months.

823
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,400
I am glad he won't be in Shanghai.

824
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,800
Or I would be the one feeling bad

825
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,200
if he had to be alone.

826
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:14,320
You are always so thoughtful.

827
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:14,720
I'll go check

828
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:15,720
on their progress.
