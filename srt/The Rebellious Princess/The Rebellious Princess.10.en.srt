1
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,519
Orb

2
00:01:37,559 --> 00:01:38,400
I'm back

3
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,760
Who allowed you to come back

4
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,000
Your birthday is coming up

5
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,279
I haven't even spent your birthday with you yet

6
00:01:57,559 --> 00:01:58,519
Of course I'm coming back

7
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,199
What about the gifts

8
00:02:04,919 --> 00:02:06,160
I am the gift

9
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,520
Orb

10
00:02:12,559 --> 00:02:13,399
Don't talk

11
00:02:14,559 --> 00:02:15,440
What are you doing

12
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,320
Your punishment

13
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,759
Can't you

14
00:02:21,279 --> 00:02:22,160
Of course

15
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,320
You can punish it as long as you want

16
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,600
Father

17
00:02:53,839 --> 00:02:55,720
Who the hell are you bringing me to see

18
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,600
You'll know when you get there

19
00:02:59,119 --> 00:03:00,639
There's a toad. Help

20
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,080
There are toads

21
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:03,679
There's a toad. Help

22
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,440
Save me

23
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:06,520
Guards save me

24
00:03:06,679 --> 00:03:08,080
There are toads there

25
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,119
Prince Ben is wandering around the royal courtyard

26
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:18,119
Want to pick a bunch of flowers for the princess

27
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:20,039
Unexpectedly, I was disturbed by the toad

28
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:20,880
That's enough

29
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:22,399
Orb

30
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:24,800
This is from China this summer

31
00:03:25,119 --> 00:03:26,199
Prince Adafan

32
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,000
Know that your birthday is near

33
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,720
I have come to congratulate you

34
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,119
Right, right, right

35
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,880
Prince Adafan

36
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,759
I personally came to Weidu to present a gift this time

37
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,000
It's really sincere

38
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:51,199
I hope our two countries

39
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:53,360
In the future, we can turn war into friendship

40
00:04:01,119 --> 00:04:01,880
Where are the gifts

41
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,160
It's far away, just around the corner

42
00:04:04,559 --> 00:04:05,520
That's me

43
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:06,800
What treasure

44
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,520
It can represent the sincerity of good relations between the two countries

45
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:10,559
I'm the only priceless treasure

46
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,479
I see

47
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:17,080
Is it a clown

48
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,160
Come here this time

49
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:23,040
I also brought the Imperial Medical Garden

50
00:04:23,119 --> 00:04:24,399
A prescription developed for many years

51
00:04:25,239 --> 00:04:26,959
Can solve the cold poison of Princess Baozhu

52
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,519
This summer, Ming Jun is in power

53
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:32,160
It's a blessing

54
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:33,679
It's just

55
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,959
I don't know the prescription that can solve the cold poison of Baozhu

56
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:38,359
Where now

57
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:39,480
This is the father

58
00:04:39,559 --> 00:04:41,040
The reason why I was sent here this time

59
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,320
If your majesty will betroth the princess to me

60
00:04:43,559 --> 00:04:44,559
Make the two countries good

61
00:04:44,799 --> 00:04:46,640
The prescription should be given with both hands

62
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:48,880
I don't know Prince Adavan

63
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,679
Which princess do you want to marry

64
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,640
Instead of letting my father and Jin Jiu

65
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,959
Sad for my body

66
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:02,480
It's better to take this opportunity

67
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:04,239
Escape from Weidu Country

68
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,359
Father

69
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:09,640
My daughter wants to visit China this summer

70
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,040
Orb

71
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,519
I don't know Prince Adavan

72
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,880
Would you like to be a guide

73
00:05:18,239 --> 00:05:20,119
This must be Princess Baozhu

74
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,920
If the princess is interested, Adafan can't ask for it

75
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:25,760
Baozhu can't fool around

76
00:05:26,239 --> 00:05:27,040
What we are discussing now

77
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,160
But marital events

78
00:05:28,679 --> 00:05:29,320
I

79
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,839
I also have a way to detoxify

80
00:05:39,799 --> 00:05:41,040
If you want to marry a princess,

81
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,160
Is to relieve cold toxin

82
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,000
I hope your majesty will give me a chance

83
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:47,200
Mrs. Prison

84
00:05:48,799 --> 00:05:49,640
Guard

85
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,279
All right

86
00:05:51,799 --> 00:05:54,519
Jin Jiu is the bodyguard chosen by Baozhu

87
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,000
Prince Adafan

88
00:05:56,239 --> 00:05:57,519
Don't speculate at random

89
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,679
I'm afraid it will damage the friendship between the two countries

90
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,119
The marriage between the two countries

91
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:05,160
I hope your majesty will consider it carefully

92
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,839
It's about Baozhu's life

93
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,239
I hope your majesty will think twice

94
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:09,920
Three days later

95
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:11,399
Birthday of the orb

96
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:14,239
It was also the time when her cold poison broke out

97
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,200
Who can relieve her of the cold poison

98
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,359
Who is entitled to marry a princess

99
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:31,119
A good dog is out of the way

100
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,480
You're in debt again, aren't you

101
00:06:33,679 --> 00:06:35,600
This summer specialty I brought to the princess

102
00:06:35,799 --> 00:06:36,880
For the safety of the princess

103
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:38,079
Something sent from outside

104
00:06:38,359 --> 00:06:39,399
I have to try poison

105
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:44,640
You

106
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,720
Things are dirty

107
00:06:46,119 --> 00:06:47,519
Would you please prepare another one

108
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,399
You, you bully you too much

109
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,279
I'm telling you

110
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:52,079
There's nobody now. I'm not afraid of you

111
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:56,399
Come with us

112
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,239
Princess Baozhu Princess

113
00:06:59,359 --> 00:07:02,359
Adafan came to visit Princess Baozhu

114
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,559
Princess, you woke up

115
00:07:12,679 --> 00:07:13,519
Be honest

116
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:15,200
Do you two know who I am

117
00:07:15,559 --> 00:07:16,880
Be careful. I'll tell you later, the emperor

118
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,760
Kill you

119
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,880
You, you

120
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:21,799
Childe

121
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:23,600
What are you doing here

122
00:07:24,119 --> 00:07:25,040
Oh, my God

123
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:27,000
Is this a fairy

124
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,640
Waste wood

125
00:07:28,799 --> 00:07:30,640
Because you want to marry my sister, too

126
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:35,920
You said

127
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:38,359
Is the moon this summer so round

128
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:45,600
Do you have to go

129
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,920
Competition in three days

130
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:50,679
I don't want you to attend

131
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:53,279
Why

132
00:07:54,119 --> 00:07:54,959
Don't you tell me

133
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:57,239
You want to marry that Prince Ada

134
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:02,200
You can't poison me

135
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,559
But I hope you can live to be seven or eighty

136
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,359
By the way, keep my share alive

137
00:08:16,239 --> 00:08:17,720
To live to be twenty is a lifetime

138
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:19,839
Living to be eighty is also a lifetime

139
00:08:20,799 --> 00:08:22,239
As long as I can be with you

140
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:24,399
One second at a time

141
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,799
It's all a lifetime

142
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,880
If you insist on marrying until this summer

143
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:33,359
Even if I do a dowry

144
00:08:34,839 --> 00:08:36,320
I'll follow you for the rest of my life

145
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,719
Adafan, you did a good job

146
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,320
If you want to marry Baozhu,

147
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,599
I have nothing to say

148
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,559
Your Majesty can't

149
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:45,760
Your Majesty

150
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,479
Actually, what I want to marry is

151
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:51,960
Princess
