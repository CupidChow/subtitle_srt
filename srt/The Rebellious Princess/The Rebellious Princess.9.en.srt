1
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,800
Orb

2
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,239
Why are you so stupid

3
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:38,800
Without you

4
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,839
So what if I survive

5
00:02:39,839 --> 00:02:41,479
Why hasn't Shu De come back yet

6
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:44,039
Big princess is not good

7
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:45,279
Lou Guifei is here

8
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,720
Just say Shu De sleeps late and stop her quickly

9
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,759
It's too late

10
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,960
Mother Shu De has come to see you

11
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:54,240
Open a country princess

12
00:02:54,399 --> 00:02:55,839
It's late in the morning and don't get up yet

13
00:02:55,839 --> 00:02:57,000
What does it look like

14
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,600
Sister Huang, I've taken care of it

15
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,320
Mother concubine

16
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:17,919
Mother concubine

17
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,160
I won't say anything

18
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:21,800
She knows everything

19
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:23,720
How about Jin Jiu

20
00:03:24,279 --> 00:03:25,839
Has been safely out of the palace

21
00:03:27,119 --> 00:03:29,320
You let the prisoner die privately

22
00:03:29,679 --> 00:03:30,839
He's not a prisoner

23
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,880
He is someone I care about very much

24
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,639
Absurd

25
00:03:32,839 --> 00:03:33,800
A humble grass-raiser

26
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,360
How can you be confused with the princess

27
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,839
Mother concubine

28
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,039
I took Jin Jiu out of the palace

29
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:41,520
Confused

30
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,720
Your Majesty must not know about this matter

31
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:50,360
Sit down

32
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,880
Shu De released prisoners privately

33
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,360
Ruler twenty

34
00:04:13,679 --> 00:04:15,080
Sentenced to the Imperial Mausoleum for one year

35
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,600
Father, emperor and son know that they are wrong

36
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,480
Father can't, Your Majesty can't

37
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,160
Your Majesty, the orb is your daughter

38
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,920
Shu De is also your daughter

39
00:04:24,359 --> 00:04:25,959
How can you favor one over the other

40
00:04:26,359 --> 00:04:27,920
It was my idea to let Jin Jiu go

41
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,440
Shu De was coerced into helping by me

42
00:04:30,679 --> 00:04:32,239
If you want to punish her, punish me first

43
00:04:32,559 --> 00:04:33,440
It's nonsense

44
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,920
Let him go

45
00:04:35,239 --> 00:04:36,200
You're dying

46
00:04:38,239 --> 00:04:39,119
Father

47
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,480
I don't have much time

48
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,880
Why do you have to risk Jin Jiu's life

49
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:47,519
If you really think of your daughter,

50
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:48,880
Just let him go

51
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,239
Leave him alone

52
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:52,760
This is the Jin family owe you a life

53
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,839
You care so much about Jin Jiu

54
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,959
It's just that he cheated me and made me feel better

55
00:04:57,799 --> 00:04:58,600
Orb

56
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,359
Father won't hurt you

57
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,160
Jin Jiu, that boy

58
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,839
He can't be trusted

59
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,760
To my daughter is to like him

60
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,079
I forbid you to hurt him

61
00:05:11,359 --> 00:05:12,399
Sister Baozhu

62
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:13,559
Sister Huang

63
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:14,839
Bearer

64
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:17,119
Bring Princess Baozhu back to her bedroom

65
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:18,440
Strictly guard

66
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:20,600
Don't step out of the bedroom again

67
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,359
Notify the Dark Guard

68
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,320
Make every effort to arrest Jin Jiu and return to the palace

69
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:33,600
How dare you come here

70
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,880
Why don't you dare to come

71
00:05:36,239 --> 00:05:38,399
Do you know who you are now

72
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,760
I should be the one who deserves

73
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,720
Wanted man with a national reward

74
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:48,079
You're not looking for me

75
00:05:48,239 --> 00:05:49,359
To help you escape

76
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:52,200
I really came to ask you for help

77
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,959
But not running away

78
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,839
Take me to the palace

79
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,480
How dare you come back

80
00:06:00,799 --> 00:06:01,720
Are you really not afraid of death

81
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,760
Of course I'm afraid

82
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,920
Who is not afraid to die

83
00:06:04,559 --> 00:06:06,559
Especially when you have someone you care about

84
00:06:07,239 --> 00:06:09,279
Your Majesty treats the princess like a pearl

85
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,359
In your capacity

86
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,600
It won't work out with her

87
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,119
I didn't expect the dark guard

88
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,279
It turned out to be a pedantic person with a family concept

89
00:06:15,359 --> 00:06:16,600
How does the stockade leader see you

90
00:06:18,239 --> 00:06:19,320
Gentleman talks but doesn't start work

91
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:20,519
I still want to see Baozhu

92
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,720
You're gonna hurt me

93
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:22,880
It's time for her to be sad

94
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,679
I admire your courage

95
00:06:25,119 --> 00:06:26,440
It is worthy of being after the Jin family

96
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,119
If you can survive this time,

97
00:06:28,359 --> 00:06:29,480
I believe in the capital

98
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,079
There must be a place for you

99
00:06:34,559 --> 00:06:36,720
Are you soliciting me

100
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,160
I'm from Naihe Village

101
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,600
Be careful to go back

102
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,880
The stockade leader asked you to kneel and rub the clothes board

103
00:06:43,559 --> 00:06:44,480
To survive

104
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,799
There is hope

105
00:06:49,799 --> 00:06:51,359
Your Majesty Jin Jiu brought it to

106
00:06:56,679 --> 00:06:57,519
Your Majesty

107
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,359
Young people don't know the rules

108
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,799
There will be a price to pay

109
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:03,079
This is your majesty's rule

110
00:07:03,359 --> 00:07:04,440
It is the rule of the world

111
00:07:05,359 --> 00:07:06,959
But I just want to play by my own rules

112
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:09,720
Keep watch over the people I care about

113
00:07:10,119 --> 00:07:11,000
Spend one's life

114
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,000
I heard you came back by yourself

115
00:07:14,679 --> 00:07:16,640
Are you really willing to sacrifice everything for the orb

116
00:07:17,679 --> 00:07:18,880
Since I chose to come back,

117
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,959
You won't leave her

118
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:24,000
You can only delay her toxicity

119
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,760
But it can't save her life

120
00:07:26,239 --> 00:07:28,160
Even if it's just to delay her for a little longer

121
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,799
I'm happy too

122
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:32,880
Jin Jiu

123
00:07:33,559 --> 00:07:34,720
I don't have to kill you

124
00:07:35,119 --> 00:07:36,359
Not just for the orb

125
00:07:36,679 --> 00:07:37,959
But as a father

126
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,720
Thank you for your affection for Baozhu

127
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,200
Your Majesty

128
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:47,559
It's the birthday of Baozhu soon

129
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I hope you can make her happy

130
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,079
Twentieth birthday

131
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,040
I don't know next year

132
00:08:09,359 --> 00:08:10,079
Orb

133
00:08:12,119 --> 00:08:12,959
I'm back

134
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,679
You can't poison me

135
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:31,480
But I hope you can live to be seven or eighty

136
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:34,399
By the way, keep my share alive

137
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,239
To live to be twenty is a lifetime

138
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,520
Living to be eighty is also a lifetime

139
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:40,559
As long as I can be with you

140
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,080
One second at a time

141
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:43,640
It's all a lifetime
