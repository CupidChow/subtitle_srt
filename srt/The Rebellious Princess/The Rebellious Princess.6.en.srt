1
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,879
Which one is the little princess

2
00:01:36,519 --> 00:01:37,080
Got it

3
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:45,120
See princess

4
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,559
This hot summer day

5
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,279
Dressed so thick

6
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:19,080
Is she the little princess

7
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,240
The little princess suffers from cold

8
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:22,600
It must be her

9
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,639
Did I find you

10
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:30,119
That hey hey hey

11
00:02:30,279 --> 00:02:31,479
What exactly does it mean

12
00:02:33,839 --> 00:02:35,800
Hey, hey, hey, that's it. That's it

13
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,960
The Emperor arrives

14
00:02:41,679 --> 00:02:43,039
Father

15
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,160
Father

16
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,119
Treasure orb

17
00:02:45,399 --> 00:02:46,559
It's back

18
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,119
Stop

19
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,000
Give it to me

20
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,880
I I don't

21
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,000
You get down here

22
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,240
I can't live without it

23
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,679
Father, you'd better give it to me

24
00:02:55,119 --> 00:02:56,520
Or I'm really going to get rough

25
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,240
Orb

26
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,279
I have to die and live for such a trifle

27
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:01,199
How can you live up to your mother who died young

28
00:03:01,399 --> 00:03:03,240
I'm afraid the mother has already been reborn

29
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,399
Forget me

30
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,360
Treasure orb

31
00:03:06,839 --> 00:03:08,360
Read less useless books

32
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,960
Learn more about your daughter's family

33
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,119
Father can help you find a good Xu later

34
00:03:12,679 --> 00:03:13,639
You got married smoothly

35
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:15,399
Father can also arrange other sisters' marriages

36
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:16,479
Although my father arranged it,

37
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:17,720
About other sisters' marriages

38
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,279
It's enough for me to have a script for company in my life

39
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:21,559
Orb

40
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,759
Stop

41
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,199
Pay with one hand and deliver with one hand

42
00:03:35,679 --> 00:03:36,960
Bao Zhu Niang

43
00:03:37,119 --> 00:03:38,880
I will definitely let us Baozhu

44
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:41,399
Become the happiest girl in Weidu country

45
00:03:43,399 --> 00:03:44,919
You can't run around next time

46
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:46,160
Come

47
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,559
Let my father have a look

48
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:49,240
You've lost weight

49
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,839
Treasure orb

50
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,440
As a princess, run away at will

51
00:03:53,679 --> 00:03:55,160
It's really not like it

52
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,320
But pity you too

53
00:03:58,039 --> 00:04:00,000
I have lost my mother since I was a child

54
00:04:00,679 --> 00:04:03,000
Are you trying to say that I have a mother and no mother

55
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,479
You child

56
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:06,199
I didn't say that

57
00:04:06,559 --> 00:04:08,199
All right, don't even stand

58
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:09,279
Have a feast first

59
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,399
Go

60
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:12,559
Is Baozhu hungry

61
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,799
Worms have worms

62
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:30,359
Sister Huang is so cool

63
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,000
That's great

64
00:04:33,359 --> 00:04:34,760
There are cockroaches

65
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,799
Why are you afraid of me?

66
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:38,600
Brother is great

67
00:04:38,799 --> 00:04:40,440
It's her. That's right

68
00:04:47,359 --> 00:04:48,600
You lied to me

69
00:04:48,799 --> 00:04:50,119
I'm pregnant with your baby

70
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:51,720
And you seduced my sister

71
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:54,839
I can't believe you are pregnant with my child

72
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:03,760
I can't believe that Sister Huang actually made it

73
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,480
Such a foul affair in the palace

74
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,440
Sister Huang

75
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:09,720
Don't blame me for being cruel

76
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,279
This evil seed

77
00:05:11,559 --> 00:05:13,160
I have to remove it for you

78
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,799
Don't play. Don't play. I'm exhausted

79
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:26,760
You said you would play until the water flooded Yinshan

80
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:28,000
This is tired of shouting

81
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,920
You are a princess

82
00:05:30,119 --> 00:05:31,880
Golden branches and jade leaves have whatever they want

83
00:05:32,239 --> 00:05:34,079
Indulge in these word books all day

84
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:35,839
You are not afraid of being laughed at by others

85
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:38,160
Fulfill other people's expectations for princesses

86
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:39,799
Can it make me live a hundred years?

87
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,079
If you can't live happily in this life,

88
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:43,320
In case you die one day,

89
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,839
Wouldn't it be too bad

90
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:49,799
You still look better when you smile

91
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,679
Princess Ben always looks good

92
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:55,440
I'm tired

93
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:13,559
My sister is worried

94
00:06:13,679 --> 00:06:15,119
Sister Huang doesn't eat well outside the palace

95
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,720
Made some cakes specially

96
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,959
Sister Huang, try it quickly

97
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,000
The amount of abortifacient per fruit

98
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:24,160
They are all enough

99
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:25,959
This evil seed

100
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,720
Will be removed

101
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:33,720
I think you really want to eat it

102
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,000
Why don't you eat it all

103
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:39,799
This is Princess Shude's intention

104
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:41,720
I don't eat very well, do I

105
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:46,640
Sister, why don't you eat

106
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,519
I think my sister's cooking is not delicious

107
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,839
Don't you want to eat

108
00:06:51,679 --> 00:06:54,040
That is, this is Princess Shude's mind

109
00:06:54,359 --> 00:06:55,200
Eat quickly

110
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,880
Sit down and eat

111
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,320
Give me a clean meal

112
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,679
Or I'll make you look good

113
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:01,559
Obey

114
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,480
Good taste and good craftsmanship

115
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,519
I see you are full and support yourself

116
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,480
Punish you for not having dinner at night

117
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,200
Don't

118
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,359
This is what she made for me to eat

119
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,720
She recognized me

120
00:07:35,799 --> 00:07:37,600
Does she have me in her heart

121
00:07:38,119 --> 00:07:39,040
Just

122
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,720
You can get rid of this wild man first

123
00:07:52,359 --> 00:07:53,279
Father-in-law Jin

124
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,160
Princess

125
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:57,359
You'd better call me Xiao Jiu

126
00:07:58,679 --> 00:07:59,880
Xiao Jiuzi

127
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,040
I'm a complete man

128
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,480
Princess, you wanted me

129
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,760
There are many people and mixed eyes here

130
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:10,200
An hour later

131
00:08:10,359 --> 00:08:12,200
Shall we go to Qingliang Palace for a talk

132
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,559
Good good

133
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,839
I have something to do with the princess

134
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,519
Then I'll go first

135
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,279
The Jin family founded Yin Yao

136
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,200
I have made countless meritorious deeds for my royal family

137
00:08:29,679 --> 00:08:30,760
Can protect the driver ineffective

138
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,640
It aggravated my daughter's cold poison

139
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,079
Oh, no

140
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,840
I just saved your daughter

141
00:08:36,119 --> 00:08:37,479
You have to kill them all
