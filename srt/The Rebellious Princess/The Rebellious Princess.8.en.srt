1
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,041
It was your Jin family who made a mistake

2
00:01:34,401 --> 00:01:35,761
I asked you to prolong my daughter's life

3
00:01:36,401 --> 00:01:37,481
It's not too much, is it

4
00:01:41,001 --> 00:01:41,960
It should be so

5
00:01:42,361 --> 00:01:43,520
Don't blame me for being cruel

6
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:46,441
I just don't want to lose my daughter

7
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,481
Then say so

8
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,161
I don't have to die

9
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,640
Could you take that box away

10
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,840
It's scary to put it there

11
00:01:56,121 --> 00:01:57,240
You can keep it for your own use

12
00:02:10,121 --> 00:02:11,361
Jujube soup

13
00:02:14,081 --> 00:02:15,001
Really

14
00:02:17,161 --> 00:02:18,441
Is really my good daughter

15
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,441
Don't run around in the future

16
00:02:20,801 --> 00:02:23,081
Stay by my side and spend more time with me

17
00:02:24,001 --> 00:02:25,120
The father emperor

18
00:02:25,441 --> 00:02:27,280
Can you let Jin Jiu go

19
00:02:28,721 --> 00:02:30,001
You mean the fake waiter

20
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,441
His manners are short-tempered and his body is not clean

21
00:02:32,961 --> 00:02:34,361
I sent him to banishment

22
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,560
To banish the army

23
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:36,920
No, no, no

24
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:38,480
I forbid him to leave

25
00:02:39,321 --> 00:02:40,840
A clever waiter has something to do

26
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,601
You drink the medicine first

27
00:02:42,961 --> 00:02:44,200
Father will arrange for you again

28
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,441
What a fishy smell

29
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,920
The imperial doctor added a blind pig blood as a medicine guide

30
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,120
New formula

31
00:03:06,161 --> 00:03:06,961
Wrong

32
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,321
Jin Jiu must still be in the palace

33
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,760
Another meal. You feed pigs.

34
00:03:26,241 --> 00:03:27,120
Why are you here

35
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,760
Father really lied to me

36
00:03:29,241 --> 00:03:31,001
You wait. I'm gonna get you out of here

37
00:03:38,881 --> 00:03:39,801
Unexpectedly

38
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,601
You're the one I'm looking for

39
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,081
But you were so clever when you were little

40
00:03:44,441 --> 00:03:45,640
How did you change when you grew up

41
00:03:47,721 --> 00:03:48,680
How has it become

42
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,721
Become

43
00:03:52,241 --> 00:03:53,120
Saskatchewan

44
00:03:58,081 --> 00:03:59,721
It's not what you said

45
00:04:00,721 --> 00:04:03,241
You said you should protect yourself in the future

46
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,400
Orb

47
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,321
To see you again

48
00:04:08,881 --> 00:04:09,640
How nice

49
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,400
What are you doing

50
00:04:16,321 --> 00:04:17,200
I can't go

51
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,601
Why

52
00:04:18,881 --> 00:04:20,321
You'll die if you stay here

53
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,761
Only I can relieve the cold poison in your body

54
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,921
What are you gonna do when I'm gone

55
00:04:27,321 --> 00:04:28,201
If you unlock the lock again,

56
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,360
I called someone.

57
00:04:29,641 --> 00:04:30,280
You

58
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,080
Somebody, someone broke the prison

59
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,001
Somebody, please

60
00:04:34,601 --> 00:04:36,481
I don't care if you love it.

61
00:04:41,001 --> 00:04:41,800
Idiot

62
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:45,881
Shu De

63
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:48,161
Sister Huang, why are you here

64
00:04:48,881 --> 00:04:50,400
I have something to ask you

65
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,240
What's on me

66
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,120
Help me save Jin Jiu

67
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,201
Save Jin Jiu

68
00:04:59,921 --> 00:05:01,360
But my father said

69
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,360
It is a great crime to release prisoners privately

70
00:05:03,601 --> 00:05:04,921
Don't piss me off

71
00:05:05,641 --> 00:05:06,400
And

72
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,161
Why don't you save yourself

73
00:05:09,761 --> 00:05:11,441
Father looked at me closely

74
00:05:11,721 --> 00:05:12,881
I went to save it once

75
00:05:13,441 --> 00:05:14,881
Jin Jiu didn't cooperate

76
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:18,080
The size of this palace

77
00:05:18,321 --> 00:05:20,441
You're the only one I can trust

78
00:05:21,441 --> 00:05:22,641
But Sister Huang

79
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,041
My mother said

80
00:05:24,161 --> 00:05:26,080
The two of us are not the same

81
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,680
And my mother said

82
00:05:27,881 --> 00:05:29,120
She and your mother's concubine

83
00:05:29,201 --> 00:05:30,800
Two people are at odds

84
00:05:33,321 --> 00:05:34,881
What do you have to struggle with

85
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,921
Long Shude, let me ask you something

86
00:05:37,161 --> 00:05:38,280
Who am I to you

87
00:05:38,761 --> 00:05:39,680
You

88
00:05:40,001 --> 00:05:41,960
You are my most admired emperor sister

89
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,120
Then who are you to me

90
00:05:44,601 --> 00:05:45,481
I

91
00:05:46,201 --> 00:05:48,481
I'm your loveliest sister

92
00:05:48,921 --> 00:05:50,001
Then don't you have to

93
00:05:51,641 --> 00:05:53,240
Sister Huang is wrapped around me

94
00:05:53,641 --> 00:05:54,560
What do I need to do

95
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,761
Carp soup

96
00:06:15,601 --> 00:06:16,520
Isn't it too much

97
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:19,161
I donate blood, not milk

98
00:06:32,481 --> 00:06:33,360
True fragrance

99
00:06:45,881 --> 00:06:47,481
As heavy as a pig

100
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:49,960
You said you

101
00:06:50,441 --> 00:06:52,761
What thick cloak do you wear in summer

102
00:06:53,321 --> 00:06:55,080
I was mistaken for the little princess

103
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,240
I spent a lot of time with Baozhu

104
00:06:58,481 --> 00:07:00,400
Who stipulates that you can't wear a thick cloak in summer

105
00:07:01,601 --> 00:07:03,240
This is a trend. Do you understand

106
00:07:25,161 --> 00:07:26,601
Why did you get me out

107
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,960
I'm not that kind

108
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,721
It's just that someone asked me

109
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,800
Since it wasn't your intention

110
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,321
Then take me back

111
00:07:37,161 --> 00:07:38,120
The orb needs me

112
00:07:38,641 --> 00:07:39,680
You're crazy

113
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,041
You will die if you go back now

114
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,321
I'm not going back

115
00:07:43,721 --> 00:07:45,080
Baozhu will die

116
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,400
No, no, no

117
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:49,960
I promised Sister Huang that I would take you out

118
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,921
I can't break my word

119
00:07:56,761 --> 00:07:57,481
What are you doing

120
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,400
Take me back

121
00:07:58,481 --> 00:08:00,800
You let go, let go

122
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,800
Now that Sister Huang has said it,

123
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,481
I hope you live well

124
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,680
Don't let her down

125
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,960
Orb

126
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,400
Why are you so stupid

127
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:25,960
Without you

128
00:08:26,641 --> 00:08:28,120
So what if I survive

129
00:08:37,961 --> 00:08:39,240
Since I chose to come back,

130
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,800
You won't leave her

131
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,761
You can only delay her toxicity

132
00:08:43,201 --> 00:08:44,521
But it can't save her life

133
00:08:44,961 --> 00:08:47,001
Even if it's just to delay her for a little longer

134
00:08:47,761 --> 00:08:49,120
I'm happy too
