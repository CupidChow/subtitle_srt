1
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,801
You're not being bullied

2
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,320
How could I be bullied

3
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,161
Those officers and men at the door

4
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,161
Those

5
00:01:42,401 --> 00:01:44,320
It's not a long talk

6
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,041
He hates me

7
00:01:48,361 --> 00:01:50,361
I'm so likable

8
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,441
I'm the loveliest

9
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,401
Girl

10
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,200
Our boss wants to see you

11
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,681
See me

12
00:02:06,721 --> 00:02:08,041
You, you, you

13
00:02:08,681 --> 00:02:10,161
You're not a woman

14
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,640
Who says men can't be in charge

15
00:02:13,161 --> 00:02:14,721
But what you're wearing

16
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:17,640
I'm wearing the most popular neutral style at present

17
00:02:20,081 --> 00:02:21,560
Mother Kim

18
00:02:21,721 --> 00:02:23,441
Dad Bu Jin

19
00:02:24,001 --> 00:02:25,961
Why do you want me here

20
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,920
You made a fuss about drunk incense building today

21
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,161
There is a conflict between your husband and wife

22
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,280
We're not husband and wife

23
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,161
That's the little couple

24
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,400
Nor is it

25
00:02:38,801 --> 00:02:39,881
But they are men

26
00:02:40,001 --> 00:02:41,920
Is the most unreliable

27
00:02:42,321 --> 00:02:43,801
Aren't you a man, too

28
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:44,881
Yeah

29
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:47,120
I didn't say I was reliable either

30
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,361
The girl is absolutely good this time

31
00:03:05,521 --> 00:03:06,881
One by one, it is watery

32
00:03:07,361 --> 00:03:08,760
But the last time those girls

33
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,361
It's not very clever

34
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,721
Then the price is lower

35
00:03:16,721 --> 00:03:19,640
My great-aunt is really the lowest price

36
00:03:20,001 --> 00:03:22,081
You can't go any lower

37
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,961
How can I do this business

38
00:03:25,321 --> 00:03:27,241
We can't make any money either

39
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,081
Think again

40
00:03:30,801 --> 00:03:31,961
Okay, okay, let me think

41
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:32,840
Let me think about it

42
00:03:32,961 --> 00:03:33,961
What's going on

43
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,161
How do you do this

44
00:03:38,961 --> 00:03:41,280
Dad Kim, this is your fault

45
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,881
The girl I shipped

46
00:03:43,001 --> 00:03:44,200
You never bargain

47
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,441
There is no reason to give this brother a low price

48
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,801
You guys talk first. I'm leaving first

49
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,200
Wait

50
00:03:52,961 --> 00:03:55,241
This is called dog-eat-dog hair

51
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,040
So since you're okay

52
00:03:59,521 --> 00:04:00,400
I'll go first

53
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,721
Where are you going

54
00:04:03,721 --> 00:04:05,521
Can you pretend I haven't been here

55
00:04:09,361 --> 00:04:10,521
The princess didn't let you go

56
00:04:10,721 --> 00:04:11,961
You're not going anywhere

57
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:15,521
Princess

58
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,480
Don't you scare him

59
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,161
The princess came late to rescue him

60
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,641
Let the princess suffer

61
00:04:23,321 --> 00:04:24,001
No hindrance

62
00:04:24,321 --> 00:04:25,761
Fortunately, the officers and men came in time

63
00:04:26,161 --> 00:04:28,321
I was very happy when I went out of the palace for the first time

64
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,280
There is a lot of harvest

65
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,481
My name is Long Baozhu

66
00:04:34,601 --> 00:04:36,601
It is princess royal of Weidu country

67
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,280
She turned out to be a princess

68
00:04:40,001 --> 00:04:41,240
Then she wouldn't be

69
00:04:43,201 --> 00:04:44,280
No, no, no, no

70
00:04:45,161 --> 00:04:47,041
This orb is so difficult

71
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,520
How can it be the same woman that she was then

72
00:04:50,161 --> 00:04:52,921
But if you can enter the palace with Baozhu,

73
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,881
I would have found her sooner

74
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,881
Blame my eyes for not knowing the real princess

75
00:05:01,881 --> 00:05:02,641
Her Royal Highness the Princess

76
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,481
Can you take me into the palace

77
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,520
You want to come to the palace with me

78
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:08,641
Princess

79
00:05:09,001 --> 00:05:10,520
This man put you in danger

80
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,001
You can't stay

81
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,641
What is your identity

82
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:17,001
The princess didn't speak. Do you interrupt

83
00:05:19,001 --> 00:05:20,960
I am the top secret organization of the court

84
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,560
The Dark Defender of Hidden Obsidian

85
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,161
It turned out to be a strange poison in his body

86
00:05:27,481 --> 00:05:29,001
Waste wood that can't use internal force

87
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,601
If you can't use internal force, you are a loser

88
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:33,321
Small people are narrow

89
00:05:33,721 --> 00:05:35,921
Princess, you must never stay here

90
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,800
Why do you want to come to the palace with me

91
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,800
In fact, along the way

92
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:43,721
I have developed sincere feelings for you

93
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,481
I can't bear to leave you

94
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,120
Glib tongue

95
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,001
Princess

96
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:49,960
Can't stay

97
00:05:50,441 --> 00:05:52,041
It is up to the princess to decide whether to stay or not

98
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,560
I swear to follow your highness to the death

99
00:05:54,881 --> 00:05:56,881
Follow to the death

100
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,520
A man born a princess

101
00:05:59,881 --> 00:06:01,680
Death is the princess's death

102
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:03,840
OK, then you can follow me into the palace

103
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:16,761
Princess

104
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,721
Don't you go to the palace

105
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,840
This is the only way for men to enter the palace

106
00:06:24,161 --> 00:06:27,080
I don't want to be an incomplete man

107
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,960
But

108
00:06:29,161 --> 00:06:31,120
Men entering the palace violate the rules of the palace

109
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,080
The Dark Guard will never agree

110
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,280
It's simple

111
00:06:35,641 --> 00:06:37,161
Bribe the steward's father-in-law

112
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,001
Go back and tell the dark guard that it was cut

113
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:39,960
From then on

114
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,881
Heaven knows, earth knows, you know and I know

115
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,201
Isn't that a lie

116
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,120
This is called a white lie

117
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,921
I'm the only one in our family

118
00:06:48,321 --> 00:06:50,240
As long as the princess keeps my lifeblood

119
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,161
What would you like to read in the future

120
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,321
Wrap it on me

121
00:06:54,481 --> 00:06:56,041
Ensure online sparring all day

122
00:06:56,201 --> 00:06:56,881
How is it

123
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,280
It's a deal

124
00:07:05,201 --> 00:07:06,360
You just cleaned up

125
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,761
Don't have a good rest

126
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:09,120
How do you run around

127
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,881
According to what you say

128
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,680
It really hurts a little

129
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,161
Well, I'll go back to rest first

130
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,041
This dark guard is too cruel

131
00:07:33,441 --> 00:07:34,840
Do they have nothing to do

132
00:07:35,601 --> 00:07:36,840
Why are you staring at me every day

133
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,560
Come and eat some melon seeds

134
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:42,680
The captain of the dark guard

135
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,481
Doesn't he have any weaknesses

136
00:07:46,441 --> 00:07:47,641
Weakness

137
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,120
It seems that there is really one

138
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:52,761
What is it

139
00:07:53,321 --> 00:07:54,520
Naihe stockade leader

140
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,641
Naihe stockade leader

141
00:07:57,481 --> 00:07:58,601
You don't know, do you

142
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,280
Why is the stockade leader the lady of the dark guard

143
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,601
The Dark Guard seems ruthless

144
00:08:03,881 --> 00:08:05,560
In fact, I am very henpecked

145
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,800
Did he ever do it

146
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,201
I'm sorry about Lady

147
00:08:11,721 --> 00:08:13,201
This

148
00:08:16,161 --> 00:08:17,560
It seems that there is really one

149
00:08:17,881 --> 00:08:18,721
What is it

150
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,441
I heard that

151
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:26,960
Princess

152
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,201
Let's play hide-and-seek

153
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,721
If you find me,

154
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,360
We'll just

155
00:08:32,881 --> 00:08:34,441
This hot summer day

156
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,160
Dressed so thick

157
00:08:36,441 --> 00:08:38,600
Is she the little princess
