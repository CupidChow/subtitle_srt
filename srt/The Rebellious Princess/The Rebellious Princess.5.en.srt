1
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:32,801
I heard that

2
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,240
Loosen

3
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,960
Let go. I'm not healed yet

4
00:01:38,721 --> 00:01:39,520
Boy

5
00:01:39,681 --> 00:01:40,880
It's the wine you hid me from

6
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:41,840
For florets

7
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,361
As a former subordinate of the stockade leader

8
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,280
I retrieved her missing wine

9
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,840
It can be regarded as repaying her kindness

10
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,320
Boy, you have a lot of courage

11
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,721
How dare you?

12
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,361
I dare to steal my wife's wine

13
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,280
The consequences of boys provoking me

14
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,280
The princess can't protect you from leaving

15
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,441
Stop scratching

16
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,840
In broad daylight, you smelly rascal

17
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,961
Help me

18
00:02:12,601 --> 00:02:13,400
Go in

19
00:02:16,321 --> 00:02:17,640
Secret order of obsidian

20
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,241
First

21
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,760
Keep one's identity strictly confidential

22
00:02:26,081 --> 00:02:27,441
Violators die

23
00:02:27,961 --> 00:02:28,680
Second

24
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,560
One day hidden obsidian all day long hidden obsidian

25
00:02:32,161 --> 00:02:33,601
Withdrawal dies

26
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,721
Third

27
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,001
Do not harm the masses

28
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,560
Violator dies

29
00:02:38,801 --> 00:02:40,400
Dead and dead

30
00:02:41,001 --> 00:02:41,840
Die

31
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,881
Do I still have a way to live? This

32
00:02:51,321 --> 00:02:53,560
Are you going to sign or not

33
00:02:54,721 --> 00:02:56,241
If you don't sign, you will die now

34
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,040
Sign it and die worse

35
00:03:04,881 --> 00:03:07,001
Tomorrow is the day of entering the palace

36
00:03:07,361 --> 00:03:09,040
How are you born to be on duty beside your highness

37
00:03:09,241 --> 00:03:10,001
Maybe

38
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,521
Be able to die

39
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,601
Thank you for your advice

40
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,280
You will be able to enter the palace soon

41
00:03:23,801 --> 00:03:25,161
Little Princess

42
00:03:25,441 --> 00:03:26,920
I don't know if you remember me

43
00:03:29,361 --> 00:03:31,601
Stop, don't run, stop

44
00:03:32,001 --> 00:03:32,640
Quickly

45
00:03:32,961 --> 00:03:33,560
Stop

46
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,680
Are you all right

47
00:03:35,601 --> 00:03:36,961
Thank you

48
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:40,361
Come along with us

49
00:03:42,441 --> 00:03:43,001
Dad

50
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,120
Take the princess away

51
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,001
If you want to find the little princess of that year,

52
00:03:54,441 --> 00:03:56,441
We can only start from Baozhu

53
00:04:05,361 --> 00:04:06,441
Hair what Leng

54
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,081
Come and help me make up

55
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,161
How can I wear makeup as a man

56
00:04:13,721 --> 00:04:15,001
Be my man

57
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,521
There are only two choices

58
00:04:16,801 --> 00:04:18,721
Obedience and forced obedience

59
00:04:19,001 --> 00:04:19,800
Come here

60
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,120
Don't say it

61
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,441
When you're not talking

62
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,161
Kind of like a princess

63
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,441
Why don't you melt it

64
00:04:37,761 --> 00:04:38,601
Princess

65
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:40,001
Enter the palace tomorrow

66
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,240
Can you see it

67
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,680
How many other princesses

68
00:04:44,481 --> 00:04:46,601
Do you want to serve other princesses

69
00:04:46,881 --> 00:04:47,761
No, no, no, no

70
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:49,601
I was born to be your man

71
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,520
Death is your dead man

72
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,001
Little princess, in order to find you

73
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,481
I am committed to Baozhu

74
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,080
You must wait for me

75
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,680
Quickening

76
00:05:20,441 --> 00:05:21,481
All right

77
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:29,001
Jin Jiu, I'll kill you

78
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,001
Uncle Fu

79
00:05:37,761 --> 00:05:39,161
This nine-yang pill

80
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:41,041
Save the Princess

81
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,360
Nine Yin Dan

82
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,560
Leave it to Xiao Jiu

83
00:05:45,881 --> 00:05:46,881
Nine what Lord

84
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,360
Jiuyang Dan saves the princess

85
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:53,041
Nine Yin Dan for Xiao Jiu

86
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:56,400
Save the princess

87
00:05:56,761 --> 00:05:57,560
I see

88
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,240
I'll say it for the last time

89
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,400
Nine Yang Dan

90
00:06:01,001 --> 00:06:02,201
To the Princess

91
00:06:02,601 --> 00:06:03,921
Nine Yin Dan

92
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,041
To Xiao Jiu

93
00:06:06,641 --> 00:06:08,080
Xiao Jiu saved the princess

94
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,321
I know. I know

95
00:06:11,721 --> 00:06:12,601
Jin Ba

96
00:06:19,481 --> 00:06:21,280
Nine Yin to Xiao Jiu

97
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,761
It's not right

98
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:24,800
Nine Yin to Princess

99
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:26,641
Jiuyang to Xiao Jiu

100
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,321
It's all my fault that the old servant is deaf

101
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,201
Harm the little master and princess

102
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,441
Take the wrong medicine

103
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,001
The old servant has few days to live

104
00:06:44,201 --> 00:06:45,881
Don't worry about the little master

105
00:06:46,321 --> 00:06:47,721
And the princess

106
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:50,800
Relax

107
00:06:51,881 --> 00:06:53,761
Little Master

108
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:56,080
Little Princess

109
00:06:56,481 --> 00:06:57,601
You must live

110
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,041
Wait till I come to you

111
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,201
Princess Wan'an

112
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,441
The emperor has not yet arrived

113
00:07:20,641 --> 00:07:22,840
Please ask the princess to meet the other princesses first

114
00:07:23,001 --> 00:07:24,240
Take a short rest

115
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,161
Come on, come on, you go

116
00:07:26,601 --> 00:07:27,280
Yes

117
00:07:28,001 --> 00:07:29,360
I don't want to play with them

118
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,641
Let's wait in the garden

119
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:32,761
Princess

120
00:07:33,201 --> 00:07:35,080
Let's play hide-and-seek

121
00:07:36,161 --> 00:07:37,601
If you find me,

122
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,240
We'll just

123
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,201
Interesting, interesting

124
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,201
Then let's get started

125
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,321
Good

126
00:07:50,641 --> 00:07:51,960
Ninety-nine

127
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,321
Ninety-eight

128
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,441
Ninety-seven

129
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,280
Ninety-six

130
00:07:58,881 --> 00:08:00,001
Ninety-five

131
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,161
Little princess, I'm coming

132
00:08:07,481 --> 00:08:09,321
Ninety-four

133
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,641
Ninety-three

134
00:08:13,881 --> 00:08:15,481
Ninety-two

135
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,041
Sample, I see what tricks you have

136
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,761
You see

137
00:08:28,161 --> 00:08:29,960
Which one is the little princess

138
00:08:30,601 --> 00:08:31,161
Got it

139
00:08:33,321 --> 00:08:34,641
I'm pregnant with your baby

140
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,360
And you seduced my sister

141
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,920
I can't believe you are pregnant with my child

142
00:08:38,201 --> 00:08:39,040
Sister Huang

143
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,920
Don't blame me for being cruel

144
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,480
This evil seed

145
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,201
I have to remove it for you
