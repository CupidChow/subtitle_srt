1
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,840
This is the newcomer who will be transferred to the general village soon

2
00:01:36,161 --> 00:01:38,560
The stockade leader is Jin Jiu

3
00:01:39,161 --> 00:01:41,041
It is said that he is highly skilled in martial arts

4
00:01:41,481 --> 00:01:42,600
Be chivalrous and righteous

5
00:01:42,761 --> 00:01:43,960
Quite martial arts

6
00:01:44,121 --> 00:01:44,960
It's wicked

7
00:01:45,041 --> 00:01:46,320
This boy actually poisoned

8
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,640
Honest and clean, not greedy for money

9
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,600
Stop

10
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:51,761
Go

11
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,761
Where's my reward

12
00:01:53,001 --> 00:01:54,240
You boy is too greedy

13
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,681
Doing good deeds only wants to get a bounty

14
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,801
No, no, no

15
00:01:59,001 --> 00:02:00,960
It is natural to do good deeds and earn money

16
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,560
Do bad things and earn money. It's a lightning strike

17
00:02:04,681 --> 00:02:05,801
The princess left the palace for the first time

18
00:02:06,121 --> 00:02:07,081
I'm afraid I'll take risks

19
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,721
Baozhu is not deeply involved in the world

20
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:10,401
And took away a lot of treasure

21
00:02:10,761 --> 00:02:11,521
I'm afraid

22
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,521
Will be robbed of money by wicked people

23
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:15,680
Say it quickly

24
00:02:15,881 --> 00:02:17,081
Where are the rest of the gold bricks

25
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,441
Or I'll kill you with a brick

26
00:02:18,521 --> 00:02:19,200
I said I said

27
00:02:19,521 --> 00:02:20,680
Aunt forgive me

28
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,721
If the wicked rob money,

29
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,521
And rob a color by the way

30
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,961
How beautiful she is

31
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:26,920
Come with me

32
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,280
Aunt can't

33
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,120
This is the wife I just robbed

34
00:02:31,961 --> 00:02:33,400
You must bring people back to me

35
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,161
Yes yes

36
00:02:42,601 --> 00:02:43,200
Xiao Er

37
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,040
Excuse me, Naihe Village

38
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,521
You want to know about Naihe Village

39
00:02:46,721 --> 00:02:47,480
My husband

40
00:02:47,601 --> 00:02:48,721
Speak the hottest words today

41
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,321
But there are two or three things about the stockade leader

42
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,361
In other words, what can I do for the stockade owner

43
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,881
That's a woman who doesn't let a man

44
00:02:57,801 --> 00:02:59,920
She was dressed in red with joy

45
00:03:00,801 --> 00:03:03,321
Be good at using spider silk whip

46
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,200
The shameless man who hates flirting with commoners most in his life

47
00:03:07,321 --> 00:03:10,120
That's to see one and fight one

48
00:03:11,321 --> 00:03:12,680
Naihe stockade leader

49
00:03:13,321 --> 00:03:15,200
Great, we found the organization

50
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,840
This stockade leader is here

51
00:03:17,001 --> 00:03:18,560
You are not allowed to collect protection money

52
00:03:19,801 --> 00:03:21,801
Then don't blame us for destroying flowers

53
00:03:29,001 --> 00:03:29,920
Attack his footwall

54
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,361
Attack him in the head

55
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,361
You don't talk about martial arts

56
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,680
Which one of your words is true

57
00:03:50,361 --> 00:03:52,560
Girl, are you

58
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,081
A good dog is out of the way unless

59
00:03:58,961 --> 00:04:00,721
I would have turned my heart to the bright moon

60
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,241
However, the stockade owner covers five risks

61
00:04:11,601 --> 00:04:13,521
The stockade leader finally found you

62
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,760
Critical moment

63
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,801
You have to rely on the code in the village

64
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,080
What's your name

65
00:04:20,601 --> 00:04:21,520
Zaixiajinjiu

66
00:04:21,881 --> 00:04:23,400
Please accept me from the stockade owner

67
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,441
This silly boy really believes that I am the stockade leader

68
00:04:28,161 --> 00:04:29,080
All right

69
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,360
A big man has to have a sidekick around him

70
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,921
What kind of service does the stockade leader want

71
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,280
What about different standards

72
00:04:36,481 --> 00:04:38,321
Salary is also different

73
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,560
That has to show your use value

74
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:51,520
Where have you been

75
00:04:52,641 --> 00:04:53,400
Stockade leader

76
00:04:53,641 --> 00:04:55,080
This is my special honor to you

77
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,240
There is this silly boy

78
00:05:00,321 --> 00:05:01,400
Stay with me when time is running out

79
00:05:01,481 --> 00:05:02,680
Go this last time

80
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,041
It seems to be good, too

81
00:05:04,761 --> 00:05:06,520
Father, I'm sorry

82
00:05:06,761 --> 00:05:08,201
I don't want a Xu

83
00:05:08,321 --> 00:05:09,360
What I want

84
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,960
Is freedom

85
00:05:21,481 --> 00:05:23,041
It's still useful for you

86
00:05:28,761 --> 00:05:30,560
How dare you put on my shoes

87
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,881
No, no, no, no

88
00:05:32,321 --> 00:05:34,201
Who knew your feet were so big

89
00:05:34,441 --> 00:05:35,560
I'll change it for you right now

90
00:05:36,201 --> 00:05:37,161
You said I had big feet

91
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,120
You come back

92
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,840
Jin Jiu, stop for me

93
00:05:44,161 --> 00:05:45,240
The boss is not here

94
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,840
Let's change one

95
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,321
Do evil to others

96
00:05:51,481 --> 00:05:52,441
Come out, you

97
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,441
Gently, gently, gently

98
00:05:55,641 --> 00:05:58,161
Storyteller, you make me easy to find

99
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,881
Auntie has something to say

100
00:06:00,001 --> 00:06:02,041
I gave you all the latest words

101
00:06:02,161 --> 00:06:03,680
I'm tired of watching it for a long time

102
00:06:04,001 --> 00:06:05,041
Say so earlier

103
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,041
As long as you don't sing with your aunt

104
00:06:07,321 --> 00:06:08,680
I have the latest book here

105
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,120
It's all for you

106
00:06:10,921 --> 00:06:11,840
You have a poor understanding

107
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,080
Not worthy to play against me

108
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,441
Singing opera

109
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,520
The stockade leader still has this hobby

110
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,761
It's time for you to show your use value

111
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,080
Me

112
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,761
Pay for it

113
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,481
To

114
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,280
Castellan, wait for me

115
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,921
Don't call me stockade leader in the future

116
00:06:33,001 --> 00:06:34,161
Then what do you call you

117
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:36,240
Call me Master

118
00:06:36,881 --> 00:06:37,921
Master

119
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,800
This one is mindless and the other is unhappy

120
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,921
It's a perfect match

121
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,641
This is to make men happy

122
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,400
A paradise where dreams come true

123
00:06:50,761 --> 00:06:52,161
But the script says that

124
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,881
Casinos are nineteen layers of hell for women

125
00:06:57,721 --> 00:06:59,680
Whatever man's paradise it is

126
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,041
Or a woman's hell

127
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,560
Today, I'll take my master

128
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,601
Make a dash

129
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,001
After you

130
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,601
Poor ghosts dare to come in and gamble

131
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:11,120
Go quickly

132
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,520
How dare you call me poor

133
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,001
Master

134
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,761
Don't generalize with them

135
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,881
You don't want to see them

136
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:20,601
We want to meet you

137
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,680
It's not you who die today

138
00:07:22,881 --> 00:07:24,201
Is that we die

139
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:25,800
Master

140
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:26,881
Leave it to me this time

141
00:07:28,161 --> 00:07:28,960
Row

142
00:07:29,321 --> 00:07:30,761
Give you a chance to show

143
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:34,761
Yang toxin in my body is unsolved

144
00:07:35,001 --> 00:07:36,161
You can't use internal skills

145
00:07:36,721 --> 00:07:38,520
It seems that we can only use that trick

146
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,761
A cloud-piercing arrow

147
00:07:54,921 --> 00:07:57,041
Hordes of troops come to meet each other

148
00:07:57,441 --> 00:07:59,560
The first time I saw the arrow through the cloud, I shouted

149
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,680
Run fast

150
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,560
Stop, stop, stop

151
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,921
Don't run, don't run

152
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,001
I didn't say

153
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,400
How can you run two step and breathe like this

154
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,481
Am I afraid you're in danger

155
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,641
Those two gangsters have help

156
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:27,800
What do you mean

157
00:08:27,881 --> 00:08:29,520
I can't beat those gangsters

158
00:08:29,761 --> 00:08:30,680
No, no, no, no

159
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,321
I'm useless

160
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,560
It's really embarrassing for me to run away

161
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,761
Then we'll have a chance in the morning

162
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:40,881
Go back to Naihe Village

163
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:42,881
There are brothers in the village

164
00:08:43,001 --> 00:08:44,201
Why fear those wannabe

165
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,081
This silly boy is still thinking about the village

166
00:08:50,081 --> 00:08:50,841
No

167
00:08:51,321 --> 00:08:53,001
It is rare to meet such an interesting person

168
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,521
He must not get away

169
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,961
In this book

170
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,040
Why is there a secret code of Naihe Village

171
00:09:00,281 --> 00:09:02,480
After Naihe Village surrendered to the court,
