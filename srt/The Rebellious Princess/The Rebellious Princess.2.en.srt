1
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,920
This silly boy is still thinking about the village

2
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,681
No

3
00:01:39,161 --> 00:01:40,840
It is rare to meet such an interesting person

4
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,361
He must not get away

5
00:01:49,001 --> 00:01:50,721
I'm sleepy I'm sleepy

6
00:01:51,001 --> 00:01:53,441
We'll discuss the matter of returning to the village tomorrow

7
00:01:58,481 --> 00:01:59,121
All right

8
00:01:59,721 --> 00:02:01,721
Master, go to bed early

9
00:02:03,761 --> 00:02:04,441
Read

10
00:02:06,401 --> 00:02:07,240
Read a script

11
00:02:07,761 --> 00:02:09,761
Don't stop until I go to bed

12
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:27,521
From then on

13
00:02:27,521 --> 00:02:29,040
Have fun and worship her as a teacher

14
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,521
Come here, come here

15
00:02:31,801 --> 00:02:32,480
Come here

16
00:02:33,241 --> 00:02:33,881
Kneel down

17
00:02:41,601 --> 00:02:42,721
Hurry up

18
00:02:43,601 --> 00:02:45,801
One two three

19
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:34,920
Master

20
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,001
How do I feel that I have walked this road twice

21
00:03:38,001 --> 00:03:38,441
How do I feel that I have walked this road twice

22
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,081
How dare you question your master

23
00:03:41,601 --> 00:03:43,961
You can't find your way. It must be your bad eyes

24
00:03:44,241 --> 00:03:45,601
Go back to your stockade

25
00:03:45,801 --> 00:03:47,280
Why do you want me to find my way

26
00:03:48,441 --> 00:03:49,400
I

27
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,400
I can't go back now

28
00:03:52,241 --> 00:03:53,241
Why

29
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,881
Because

30
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,040
Because I still have

31
00:03:59,161 --> 00:04:00,721
More important tasks to be accomplished

32
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,040
What kind of mission

33
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,001
This way

34
00:04:07,241 --> 00:04:09,441
She clearly didn't know the way back to the stockade

35
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,801
I heard that the stockade owner hates eating coriander most

36
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:15,200
Don't

37
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:16,920
She is not the stockade leader at all

38
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,240
Why are you leaving?

39
00:04:22,881 --> 00:04:23,641
Coming

40
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,960
No, I have to try her

41
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,800
There are cockroaches

42
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,161
Not afraid, not afraid, I'm here

43
00:04:39,161 --> 00:04:40,400
Not to say

44
00:04:40,641 --> 00:04:42,520
Is the stockade owner most afraid of cockroaches

45
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,280
If she wasn't the stockade leader

46
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,761
The code in the village

47
00:04:47,881 --> 00:04:49,240
How could she know

48
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,161
Vernacular script

49
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,041
Where are you going

50
00:05:00,321 --> 00:05:02,080
I go to the toilet

51
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,481
Where is the script

52
00:05:09,721 --> 00:05:10,800
Which one

53
00:05:11,321 --> 00:05:12,881
It's the stockade owner she read

54
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,321
You mean the little aunt, don't you

55
00:05:17,321 --> 00:05:18,560
To this book

56
00:05:21,601 --> 00:05:22,761
In this book

57
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:24,921
Why is there a secret code of Naihe Village

58
00:05:25,161 --> 00:05:27,360
After Naihe Village surrendered to the court,

59
00:05:27,641 --> 00:05:29,881
The secret code of the past is known all over the world

60
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,201
As for the script

61
00:05:31,321 --> 00:05:33,400
In pursuit of the wonderful degree of the story,

62
00:05:33,761 --> 00:05:35,641
Of course, you have to write half-truths

63
00:05:36,761 --> 00:05:38,601
She really is not the stockade leader

64
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,560
Let me ask you something

65
00:05:42,601 --> 00:05:43,680
If a girl

66
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,360
Pretending to be your boss

67
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,080
Close to you and instruct you

68
00:05:48,601 --> 00:05:49,761
What exactly is it for

69
00:05:50,321 --> 00:05:52,960
That's like you want to be your wife

70
00:05:53,601 --> 00:05:54,960
Like me

71
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:56,041
Right

72
00:06:01,441 --> 00:06:02,161
Storyteller

73
00:06:02,481 --> 00:06:03,400
Sell this to me

74
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,761
This book is out of date. It's half price for you

75
00:06:08,881 --> 00:06:09,520
To

76
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,441
This one has no brains

77
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,520
I have a brain this time

78
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,041
Although she is a little cranky

79
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,761
But it's cute to smile

80
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,201
Be my maiden

81
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,680
It's not that you can't

82
00:06:43,641 --> 00:06:45,280
Lady, please drink tea

83
00:06:54,601 --> 00:06:55,601
It's too strong

84
00:06:56,001 --> 00:06:57,001
I can't sleep after drinking

85
00:06:57,441 --> 00:06:58,360
I'm sorry I'm sorry

86
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,441
You try it again

87
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,041
You can't make tea well

88
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,120
What's the use of asking you

89
00:07:09,881 --> 00:07:10,601
Lady

90
00:07:11,321 --> 00:07:12,001
I'm sorry

91
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:12,921
Lady

92
00:07:13,321 --> 00:07:14,680
This strength is OK

93
00:07:14,921 --> 00:07:16,080
Didn't you eat

94
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,240
Make a little effort

95
00:07:17,641 --> 00:07:18,441
Good good

96
00:07:19,721 --> 00:07:20,641
What about this

97
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,680
It hurts me to death

98
00:07:27,601 --> 00:07:28,641
I'm so miserable

99
00:07:29,161 --> 00:07:30,520
If she really becomes my wife,

100
00:07:30,921 --> 00:07:31,761
For the rest of my life

101
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:33,481
Won't there never be a day to turn over

102
00:07:35,761 --> 00:07:36,400
No

103
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,680
I have to run quickly

104
00:07:44,161 --> 00:07:45,280
Where are you going

105
00:07:46,481 --> 00:07:48,481
I'll I'll go to the toilet

106
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:50,400
Convenient

107
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,641
The toilet is over there

108
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:56,041
Look at me

109
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,280
I'm sleepy

110
00:07:57,481 --> 00:07:58,441
I'll go now

111
00:07:59,041 --> 00:07:59,800
Go now

112
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,721
Afraid you'll get lost

113
00:08:10,881 --> 00:08:12,120
I'm waiting for you here on purpose

114
00:08:14,441 --> 00:08:15,960
You're not done yet

115
00:08:16,641 --> 00:08:18,800
Going to the toilet so often

116
00:08:19,201 --> 00:08:21,921
I may not be in good health

117
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,240
Who said that

118
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,761
You are not the stockade leader at all

119
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,280
I

120
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,280
You are just imitating the stockade leader in the script

121
00:08:29,481 --> 00:08:31,360
I don't know why you pretend to be the stockade leader

122
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,041
But I don't have time to act with you

123
00:08:33,481 --> 00:08:35,040
She wants to play with you

124
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,720
Maybe it's you

125
00:08:37,081 --> 00:08:38,521
Think you're funny
