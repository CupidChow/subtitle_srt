0
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,800
My hairpin fell into the well

1
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,160
What to do

2
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,120
This is my favorite hairpin

3
00:01:48,639 --> 00:01:50,239
If you can't find it back,

4
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,519
How about this, then

5
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:55,080
I'll look for it for you later

6
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,319
Don't look back

7
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:57,400
Just now

8
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,959
Now

9
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:03,000
All right

10
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:04,519
Then I'll try

11
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:07,639
Be careful

12
00:02:17,559 --> 00:02:19,240
Long Shude, what are you doing

13
00:02:20,119 --> 00:02:21,559
Sister I

14
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:23,240
I

15
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:25,600
Jin Jiu, are you stupid

16
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,240
Sister, listen to me

17
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,160
I'm helping you with wild men

18
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,639
Can you let go

19
00:02:32,399 --> 00:02:33,800
Sister, listen to me, Jin Jiu

20
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:35,199
Don't publicize your family's ugliness

21
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,119
Shu De

22
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:37,759
You let go, you don't drag me

23
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:38,960
Let go

24
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:40,119
Let go

25
00:02:40,119 --> 00:02:40,919
Then I'll let it go

26
00:02:44,399 --> 00:02:45,479
Sister

27
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,360
Get up when you die again

28
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:55,119
It hurts me to death

29
00:02:56,039 --> 00:02:57,800
The whole body is scattered

30
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,919
Lean back a bit

31
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:03,880
You're a liar

32
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,320
And said that life is my man

33
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:06,800
Death is my dead man

34
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:07,880
As soon as you enter the palace

35
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,360
You pass when someone beckons

36
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,000
A man

37
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:13,240
Be happy to help others

38
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,199
Stop

39
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:15,800
You're a eunuch now

40
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:20,960
What are you looking for

41
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:24,720
Instead of letting you change your mind

42
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,520
Why don't we kill you now

43
00:03:27,119 --> 00:03:27,880
You

44
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,520
You

45
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:35,639
It's cold

46
00:03:35,839 --> 00:03:36,839
What's wrong with you

47
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,520
You're not pretending to be pathetic, are you

48
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,119
I'm not eating this. It's cold

49
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:46,759
Get up

50
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:52,399
What's wrong with you

51
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,520
Stop saluting

52
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:56,639
Find some trustworthy people

53
00:03:56,759 --> 00:03:58,240
Grab the rope and walk with me. Come on

54
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,080
What does it look like to bump into the wild

55
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,960
Mother concubine

56
00:04:03,559 --> 00:04:05,679
What are you doing in such a hurry

57
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,800
Mother concubine

58
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,880
I threw Sister Huang into the well

59
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,520
This is a good thing

60
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:15,279
Does anyone know

61
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:18,920
No one knows

62
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,239
Do you know the mother concubine

63
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,640
I just heard

64
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:25,040
It's the fake eunuch named Jin

65
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,079
But also made Huang Jie pregnant

66
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,920
And pregnant

67
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,239
Now I can catch my pigtails

68
00:04:31,559 --> 00:04:33,359
The emperor can't protect his faults this time

69
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,239
And I just heard

70
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,600
Mother Princess, let's save people first

71
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:41,000
Right, right, right

72
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:45,000
Fake eunuchs bring disaster to harem

73
00:04:45,559 --> 00:04:46,760
It also caused the orb to fall into the well

74
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,440
How dare you

75
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:51,000
Poor orb

76
00:04:51,239 --> 00:04:53,239
I was pregnant and fell into a well and was injured

77
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,160
I don't know the fetus in the abdomen

78
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,839
Nothing, nothing

79
00:05:00,679 --> 00:05:01,559
Imperial concubine empress

80
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:03,279
What do you mean by that

81
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,079
Jin Jiu, don't pretend

82
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,600
About you and Baozhu

83
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,320
We all know that

84
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:11,160
Let's make it clear first

85
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,079
What is pregnant with what fetus

86
00:05:13,679 --> 00:05:14,720
Shameless child

87
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,200
Someone dragged it out and beheaded it

88
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:17,200
Father, don't

89
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,440
Sister Huang

90
00:05:18,679 --> 00:05:19,119
Don't

91
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,239
You still protect him

92
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,640
He's one of mine

93
00:05:21,799 --> 00:05:23,079
Of course I have to protect it

94
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:24,480
You're a princess

95
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,600
Unexpectedly

96
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,480
You, you have private meetings with men

97
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,239
But

98
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,320
Baozhu, she was confused for a while

99
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,359
But this Jin Jiu should be killed

100
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,440
Don't kill

101
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,239
Wild men must be killed

102
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:39,720
Kill him and kill me first

103
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:41,239
Baozhu, shut up

104
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,440
Sister Huang

105
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:46,559
Do you want to listen to me as a wild man first

106
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,839
Say something

107
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,559
Say that finish giving death

108
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:51,959
Actually

109
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,079
The princess and I are clean and clear

110
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,640
I

111
00:05:56,279 --> 00:05:57,600
And a boy

112
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,079
Imperial physician

113
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,320
Report back to your majesty and check it out

114
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,640
This person's yang fire is exuberant for a long time

115
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,160
It is indeed

116
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,480
A pure boy

117
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:21,440
You see I'm not lying to you

118
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,440
I saved the princess

119
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,760
You don't have to thank me too much

120
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:26,320
Just reward me with anything you like

121
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,559
Somebody drag him down

122
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,040
Put in jail and wait for it to happen

123
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:33,760
That's how you thank your benefactor

124
00:06:34,119 --> 00:06:35,880
Father, he saved my life

125
00:06:38,679 --> 00:06:39,600
All right, Sister Huang

126
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,640
Today in the well

127
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,279
Jin Jiu saw me unconscious

128
00:06:42,359 --> 00:06:43,559
Is there anyone

129
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:45,359
Don't sleep. Hold on

130
00:06:47,679 --> 00:06:49,720
This seems to be a symptom of cold toxin attack

131
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:51,720
Don't

132
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,239
She's the little princess

133
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,720
It's cold

134
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,839
Fu Bo divided the wrong medicine that day

135
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,200
I am stagnant in yang qi

136
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,119
That little princess must be cold poison to the bone

137
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,559
So are we

138
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,600
It's cold

139
00:07:08,359 --> 00:07:09,399
It's cold

140
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,440
I wonder if this will help

141
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,079
I can only try it first

142
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,079
Your Majesty

143
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,160
Is your father's name Jin Ba

144
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,799
Yeah

145
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,200
The Jin family founded Yin Yao

146
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,160
I have made countless meritorious deeds for my royal family

147
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,480
Can protect the driver ineffective

148
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:47,679
It aggravated my daughter's cold poison

149
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,040
Oh, no

150
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:51,799
I just saved your daughter

151
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:53,440
You have to kill them all

152
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,440
Your Majesty

153
00:07:55,799 --> 00:07:56,799
Can you keep me alive

154
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,559
I will definitely make up for it

155
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,359
My blood

156
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:03,000
It can inhibit the princess's cold poison

157
00:08:03,239 --> 00:08:04,880
I tried it out underground

158
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,880
Since you volunteered in person, then

159
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,359
I don't have to waste my breath, do I

160
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,600
I don't have to die

161
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,399
It was your Jin family who made a mistake

162
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,119
I asked you to prolong my daughter's life

163
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,880
It's not too much, is it

164
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,679
I don't have much time

165
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:26,040
Why do you have to risk Jin Jiu's life

166
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,920
If you really think of your daughter,

167
00:08:28,239 --> 00:08:29,279
Just let him go

168
00:08:29,679 --> 00:08:32,479
You're not looking for me

169
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,840
To help you escape

170
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,640
I really came to ask you for help
