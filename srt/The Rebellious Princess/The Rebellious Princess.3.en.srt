1
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,839
Going to the toilet so often

2
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:36,959
I may not be in good health

3
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,120
Who said that

4
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:39,199
I'm in good health

5
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:42,519
Let's get started quickly

6
00:01:47,559 --> 00:01:51,080
Said that Wu Songshan had drunk wine on this day

7
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,720
Kuang Li thud on Jingyanggang

8
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,319
Wu Songgang lay down and rested

9
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,680
This is amazing

10
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,239
Behind the mountain came out

11
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,480
King of Tigers and Beasts

12
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,080
Boy

13
00:02:07,279 --> 00:02:09,080
This tiger really doesn't

14
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,039
There will be no future

15
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,919
Where is this childe going

16
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,960
I'm afraid you'll be hungry

17
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:52,880
Come out and buy you breakfast

18
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,679
Buy breakfast

19
00:02:55,839 --> 00:02:58,839
You came to this wilderness with your baggage on your back

20
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:01,360
Just to buy me breakfast

21
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,960
I think you want to run away

22
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,479
You are not the stockade leader at all

23
00:03:08,559 --> 00:03:09,000
I

24
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,199
You are just imitating the stockade leader in the script

25
00:03:11,559 --> 00:03:13,440
I don't know why you pretend to be the stockade leader

26
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:14,880
But I don't have time to act with you

27
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,199
You, you mustn't leave

28
00:03:16,399 --> 00:03:17,559
You said you'd hang out with me

29
00:03:20,559 --> 00:03:21,119
You

30
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:22,119
You give it back to me

31
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,800
I'll pay you back if you don't leave

32
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,639
You

33
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,160
Don't make me hit a woman

34
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,919
I'm afraid of myself when I get angry

35
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,080
Good. You won

36
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,360
I'll give it back to you

37
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,600
Keep your word

38
00:03:37,279 --> 00:03:39,399
Is that what you're looking for

39
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,440
Why are you there

40
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,559
I'm curious

41
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,399
The efficacy of this juexue

42
00:03:51,399 --> 00:03:52,199
Line line line

43
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:54,160
I think you are good. I can't beat you

44
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:55,839
I don't want my letter from the head office, do you

45
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,800
You are not allowed to run

46
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:57,679
Don't you go

47
00:03:57,679 --> 00:03:59,240
Don't chase me, don't go

48
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,160
You stop for me

49
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,839
Stop for me

50
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:06,639
You

51
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,199
Stop

52
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,160
Why can he get in and I can't

53
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:15,720
Beauty and the Beast are forbidden

54
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,279
Stay with the most festive one

55
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,519
Let's get the rest out of here

56
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,119
Pour wine

57
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,480
Childe seems to have something on his mind

58
00:04:50,679 --> 00:04:51,799
Tell me about it

59
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,959
It's bad luck to say it

60
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:57,519
I was haunted by a crazy woman

61
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,279
Insane

62
00:05:01,239 --> 00:05:02,839
Crazy woman

63
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,160
Clearly we have nothing to do with each other

64
00:05:05,559 --> 00:05:06,720
Why do I have to play with her

65
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,760
Role play

66
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:09,279
What are you talking about not being a crazy woman

67
00:05:11,559 --> 00:05:13,119
She wants to play with you

68
00:05:13,359 --> 00:05:14,920
Maybe it's you

69
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,799
Think you're funny

70
00:05:17,119 --> 00:05:18,239
Take a fancy to me

71
00:05:19,239 --> 00:05:19,959
Forget it

72
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,200
Even if she can get my people

73
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,920
She can't get my heart either

74
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,880
Keep me walking like a dead man

75
00:05:26,119 --> 00:05:27,279
What fun can it have

76
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,200
Stay by my side

77
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,720
Is that what makes you so miserable

78
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,959
You, you, you, you

79
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:37,000
You

80
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,359
You've gone too far

81
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,440
I

82
00:05:45,359 --> 00:05:48,079
Am I not the one who should run

83
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:07,760
Smelly man heart breaker

84
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,160
Stop, stop, stop, stop

85
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,399
Don't run, don't run

86
00:06:12,799 --> 00:06:13,640
Stop

87
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,880
You stop for me

88
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,079
Heart breaker

89
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:17,040
Grab him

90
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:21,519
The girl who stole in

91
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,160
Good-looking

92
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,959
Keep an eye on her for me

93
00:06:25,359 --> 00:06:26,040
Not good

94
00:06:26,359 --> 00:06:27,440
She's in danger

95
00:06:29,799 --> 00:06:31,279
But she is so good at martial arts

96
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,559
I don't need to save it

97
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,440
Nothing really happened to her, did she

98
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:45,200
Unexpectedly from ruin

99
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,679
Are you still a man

100
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,239
I don't blame you for my carelessness

101
00:06:57,119 --> 00:06:59,119
How dare you stand here

102
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:00,399
If anything happens to me,

103
00:07:00,559 --> 00:07:02,200
I will haunt you all my life

104
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,559
I'm so cold and hungry

105
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,239
Somebody help me

106
00:07:16,119 --> 00:07:17,720
No, I have to go back

107
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,119
Why is the restaurant closed

108
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,839
No matter what, go find Baozhu first

109
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:34,920
Orb

110
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,760
Was she being

111
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:45,799
I'm sorry

112
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:47,679
Orb

113
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,559
I will definitely protect you in the future

114
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:57,920
I'm Jin Jiu for the rest of my life

115
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,160
I will take good care of you

116
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,600
Never give up

117
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,279
Are you stupid

118
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,640
I

119
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,359
You're not being bullied

120
00:08:16,119 --> 00:08:17,799
How could I be bullied

121
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,640
Those officers and men at the door

122
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,640
Those

123
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,799
It's not a long talk

124
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:27,480
My name is Long Baozhu

125
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,600
It is princess royal of Weidu country

126
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,000
I swear to follow your highness to the death

127
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,399
Follow to the death

128
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:36,880
A man born a princess

129
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,280
Death is the princess's death
