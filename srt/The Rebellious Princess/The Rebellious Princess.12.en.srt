1
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:36,801
Orb

2
00:01:38,041 --> 00:01:38,920
Take care

3
00:01:39,761 --> 00:01:40,801
You too

4
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,161
Stop

5
00:02:02,361 --> 00:02:03,481
We are out for a walk

6
00:02:03,761 --> 00:02:04,880
I forced him to elope

7
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,200
Don't you hurt him

8
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,240
Protect the princess

9
00:02:20,361 --> 00:02:22,400
What about the strange dog hole

10
00:02:24,801 --> 00:02:27,200
Which troublesome person blocked the dog hole

11
00:02:39,801 --> 00:02:41,480
Father and Father

12
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,280
Father

13
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,120
Thank you

14
00:03:02,321 --> 00:03:03,280
Take care of her

15
00:03:04,361 --> 00:03:05,241
Your Majesty rest assured

16
00:03:24,081 --> 00:03:25,400
Where shall we go next

17
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,680
Why do you need to plan to fight the sword at the end of the world

18
00:03:32,361 --> 00:03:33,400
Mr. Storyteller

19
00:03:34,601 --> 00:03:36,321
This is the latest transcript

20
00:03:36,441 --> 00:03:38,640
Give you two a wedding gift

21
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,640
Ice Princess and her little waiter

22
00:03:44,961 --> 00:03:46,241
I like this name

23
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,640
Thank you, sir

24
00:03:50,361 --> 00:03:50,961
Go

25
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,161
Yin and Yang reconcile with heaven-sent marriage

26
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,441
Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful

27
00:04:05,601 --> 00:04:07,001
Baozhu washed his feet

28
00:04:28,761 --> 00:04:30,001
From Mr. Storyteller

29
00:04:30,201 --> 00:04:31,080
Who knows

30
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,761
It's full of incomprehensible things

31
00:04:36,001 --> 00:04:37,960
Read less such books in the future

32
00:04:38,321 --> 00:04:39,321
Bad for the eyes

33
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,761
I'll tell you

34
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,800
People have a narrow way to go in rivers and lakes

35
00:05:37,441 --> 00:05:39,960
Either you die or we die

36
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,680
I haven't seen kung fu soar for some time

37
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,921
You, you wait

38
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,001
We'll be back

39
00:06:16,441 --> 00:06:18,041
Run for a walk

40
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,321
I seem to be getting worse

41
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:29,481
Run fast

42
00:06:32,201 --> 00:06:33,001
Orb

43
00:06:33,481 --> 00:06:34,560
I have internal strength

44
00:06:35,921 --> 00:06:36,520
Orb

45
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,560
We can be together forever

46
00:06:45,721 --> 00:06:46,761
What the hell is going on

47
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,161
I'll tell you if you get close

48
00:07:00,001 --> 00:07:03,240
Guan Guanzhu is in the river continent

49
00:07:03,441 --> 00:07:06,680
My fair lady and gentleman are good

50
00:07:07,441 --> 00:07:08,680
Come on, come on

51
00:07:09,161 --> 00:07:11,201
You said your prenatal education is prenatal education

52
00:07:11,481 --> 00:07:13,800
Wearing this outfit is strange

53
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,120
It makes me think

54
00:07:20,881 --> 00:07:23,960
I call this teaching by words and deeds

55
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,520
Father

56
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,960
Is that sister Baozhu inside

57
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,761
Why do I feel a little different?

58
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:33,041
Looks like

59
00:07:33,441 --> 00:07:34,840
Seems to have gained a lot of weight

60
00:07:36,001 --> 00:07:37,041
We eavesdrop here

61
00:07:37,201 --> 00:07:38,560
Isn't it so good

62
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,800
Sister Baozhu

63
00:07:45,601 --> 00:07:46,201
Come

64
00:07:48,881 --> 00:07:50,201
Sister Baozhu

65
00:07:55,161 --> 00:07:55,960
That's enough

66
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,280
That's enough

67
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,680
Be careful

68
00:07:59,001 --> 00:08:00,001
Don't you press it

69
00:08:00,641 --> 00:08:01,840
Pressing on what

70
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,680
Sister Baozhu

71
00:08:09,201 --> 00:08:10,441
You have a little jewel

72
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:12,360
Xiao Jin Shi

73
00:08:12,721 --> 00:08:13,680
Little orb

74
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,161
Xiao Jin Shi Xiao Bao Zhu

75
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,201
Xiao Jin Shi Xiao Bao Zhu

76
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,921
Xiao Jin Shi Xiao Bao Zhu

77
00:08:18,001 --> 00:08:19,481
Xiao Jin Shi Xiao Bao Zhu

78
00:08:20,481 --> 00:08:22,520
The emperor promised to take my last name before

79
00:08:22,641 --> 00:08:23,321
Xiao Jin Shi

80
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,360
Little orb

81
00:08:24,481 --> 00:08:25,960
Xiao Jin Shi Xiao Bao Zhu

82
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,601
All right, all right, all right, all right, all right

83
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,721
You two

84
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:30,120
I've made up my mind

85
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,921
He will be called Little Dragon Ball in the future
