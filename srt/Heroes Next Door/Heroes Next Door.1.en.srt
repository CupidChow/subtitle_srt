THIS DRAMA IS A WORK OF FICTION.
ALL CHARACTERS, PROFESSIONS, PLACES,

COMPANIES, ORGANIZATIONS,
ETHNIC GROUPS AND EVENTS ARE NOT REAL.

00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:44,962
ALL CHILD AND ANIMAL SCENES WERE FILMED
SAFELY UNDER EXPERT SUPERVISION.

5
00:00:47,256 --> 00:00:51,134
<i>Immediately after James Sullivan</i>
<i>purchased a big plot of land in Kiyun-si,</i>

6
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:53,804
<i>the government made the area</i>
<i>a specialized IT zone.</i>

7
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:55,264
- A beer, please.
- Yes.

8
00:00:55,347 --> 00:00:57,766
- <i>The property prices have skyrocketed</i>
- Here you go, sir.

9
00:00:57,850 --> 00:00:58,934
- <i>since the announcement.</i>
<i>- Thank you.</i>

10
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:03,021
<i>Yes, the property prices have doubled</i>
<i>in a month since the announcement.</i>

11
00:01:03,105 --> 00:01:04,314
<i>There are barely any listings now.</i>

12
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:07,818
<i>People say Sullivan</i>
<i>may scrap the investment plan...</i>

13
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:09,486
Look at that face.

14
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:10,988
Look at his face.

15
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,447
What now?

16
00:01:12,531 --> 00:01:13,866
He said he wasn't interested at all,

17
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:16,326
but look how happy he is
to hear that land values have gone up.

18
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,453
I don't care if it goes up.

19
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:22,040
Why would it be my business
when I plan on staying here forever?

20
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:25,919
Why wouldn't you care?
Why wouldn't it be your business?

21
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:30,132
The land you're sitting on
is turning from dirt to gold as we speak.

22
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:33,135
- Don't you get it?
- Really? Where? I don't see it.

23
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:36,096
Hey, I told you not to drink
on an empty stomach.

24
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,015
Have some of this, too.

25
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:40,184
It's on Byeong-nam today, anyway.

26
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:41,476
- Me?
- Yes.

27
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:44,313
Give that to me. I'll pour it for you.

28
00:01:44,396 --> 00:01:48,192
Right. I heard you saw a doctor
with your wife this morning.

29
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:49,443
What did he say?

30
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:54,865
Do you really need
everything spelled out for you?

31
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:59,328
He's been gloomy all evening.
I could tell from way earlier.

32
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:01,997
You're so thick-headed.

33
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,709
You're so smart that you know everything

34
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:07,711
- and crave so much food, right?
- That's right.

35
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:10,047
Right. I got something for Byeong-nam.

36
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,131
What?

37
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:17,346
Excuse me, my favorite snack is here.

38
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:21,141
- Come here. I'll chew them up for you!
- Stop it!

39
00:02:21,225 --> 00:02:23,644
My wife got tested for Alzheimer's today.

40
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:30,400
The result should be out in two days,

41
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:33,362
but the doctor told me to brace myself.

42
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:35,572
Do I really need to see the result, then?

43
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,367
- Come on.
- Come on. Let's drink together.

44
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:40,369
And your wife isn't just anyone.

45
00:02:40,452 --> 00:02:42,079
- She'll be fine.
- Yes.

46
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,872
Let's toast her health.

47
00:02:43,956 --> 00:02:45,207
Sure.

48
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,709
- For your wife's health!
- Cheers!

49
00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:49,127
- Cheers.
- Right on.

50
00:02:49,962 --> 00:02:51,505
Everything will be fine.

51
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:56,343
Hospitals are excellent these days.

52
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:58,220
Have another drink.

53
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:02,850
Right.

54
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,187
Have another drink,
my immature and clueless friend.

55
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:10,440
- Gosh, seriously.
- Hey, so...

56
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,861
- Hey, stop.
- What?

57
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:15,737
- Hey!
- Sorry.

58
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:18,156
Didn't I tell you
that alcohol was holy water?

59
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,076
It's because of that guy
driving with the headlights on.

60
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,578
Man, what is he doing?

61
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:24,371
He must be out of his mind.

62
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:26,623
He's driving like a menace. It's scary.

63
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:29,668
I told you we needed security cameras
at intersections...

64
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:39,344
What?

65
00:03:39,428 --> 00:03:40,846
What? Did he crash?

66
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,431
- What's going on?
- What?

67
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:44,558
- What?
- What happened?

68
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:45,726
- What?
- Hold up.

69
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:52,024
- Oh, man.
- What if someone's inside?

70
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:55,277
- Call 911!
- What's their number?

71
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,737
- Ji-hun, call 911!
- Yes!

72
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,157
- Call 911!
- Let's save the people first.

73
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,241
Okay.

74
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:08,373
What? Where are you going?

75
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:09,625
Oh, gosh.

76
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,378
Hey, get me some tools.

77
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:15,506
- Okay.
- You need to hurry!

78
00:04:16,131 --> 00:04:17,257
Hurry! Go!

79
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:22,387
Oh, goodness.

80
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:23,388
We have to go!

81

FIRST EXPLOSION
ON AUG 16, 2025 AT 12:30 A.M.

EPISODE 1:
HASN'T EVEN SERVED IN THE MILITARY

83
00:05:35,711 --> 00:05:39,631
<i>Here's some news about Kiyun-si,</i>
<i>Sullivan's new hot specialized zone.</i>

84
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:41,258
<i>He's an ethnically-Korean IT genius</i>

85
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:44,761
<i>and the founder of the Joinus Company,</i>
<i>also known as one of the top ten figures</i>

86
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:46,555
<i>with the most global influence.</i>

87
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:50,350
<i>CEO Sullivan purchased a big plot of land</i>
<i>on the outskirts of Kiyun-si.</i>

88
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:53,270
<i>The government then announced plans</i>
<i>to make this region</i>

89
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,856
<i>Asia's largest specialized zone</i>
<i>for IT tourism.</i>

90
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:59,651
<i>This attracted nationwide attention,</i>
<i>and within a month of the announcement,</i>

91
00:05:59,735 --> 00:06:03,197
<i>the region had witnessed</i>
<i>exponential increases in property prices.</i>

92
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:05,616
<i>Everyone is keeping a keen eye</i>

93
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:10,913
<i>on Kiyun-si's development</i>
<i>after being chosen by James Sullivan.</i>

<i>The local governments and businesses are</i>

95
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:15,167
<i>moving fast to welcome the development.</i>

MAMMOSEU MART

97
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:17,836
<i>Next up, the weather.</i>

98
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:21,965
<i>The sky is clear all across the country,</i>
<i>including Kiyun-si.</i>

99
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:25,719
<i>The temperature has risen quite a bit,</i>
<i>so you'll feel some heat in the afternoon.</i>

100
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:29,306
<i>But the humidity level isn't high,</i>
<i>so it'll be a pleasant day.</i>

101
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:42,069
Yes?

102
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:45,072
- You have a delivery.
- Thank you.

103
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:46,323
- Have a good day.
- Thanks.

104
00:06:58,252 --> 00:06:59,419
Good morning.

105
00:07:05,843 --> 00:07:08,345
My princess,
did someone kidnap you at night?

106
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,055
Your hair looks like
you've been dragged somewhere.

107
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:11,515
Water.

108
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:12,766
Yes, water. Come here.

109
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:17,062
All right.

110
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,442
Here.

111
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:27,197
Daddy will make you
the best egg fried rice,

112
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:28,490
so go and wash your face.

113
00:07:28,574 --> 00:07:29,867
You have to eat and go to kindergarten.

114
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:33,078
Make my hair into bunny ears.

115
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:35,414
What?

116
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:38,625
You promised to wear
the apple bun hair to kindergarten.

117
00:07:39,001 --> 00:07:40,836
Don't tell me you've forgotten.

118
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:43,380
Fine, give me bunny ears
when we go to the amusement park.

119
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:47,342
Got it, Princess Bunny.

120
00:07:48,844 --> 00:07:49,720
Wash up.

121
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:55,684
It's chilly.

122
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:07,321
Yes?

123
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,868
- And you are?
- I'm the head of the neighborhood.

124
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:14,244
I live in the next building.

125
00:08:14,328 --> 00:08:16,246
I just wanted to drop by
before going to the store.

126
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:19,625
Moving is a lot of work, isn't it?

127
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,210
Gosh, I'm dying here.

128
00:08:22,461 --> 00:08:24,087
So what brings you here?

129
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:26,924
I need your confirmation of residence.

130
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:28,842
You actually live here, right?

131
00:08:28,926 --> 00:08:30,761
- Yes.
- Please sign it, then.

132
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:35,390
We haven't had anyone move in for so long.
It's so nice to see a new face.

133
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:40,437
And you might get in trouble
if you don't sort your garbage properly,

134
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:43,106
so read this carefully
and follow the rules, okay?

135
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:46,318
The youth association president
does daily rounds to check.

136
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:48,529
- Rounds?
- Of course.

137
00:08:49,321 --> 00:08:51,323
I didn't know this neighborhood
had a youth association president.

138
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:53,075
That's so cool.

139
00:08:59,331 --> 00:09:01,124
My, my.

140
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:03,794
NEIGHBORHOOD RECYCLING AREA

141
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:16,223
What lunatic
didn't even bother to recycle?

142
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:32,197
This one is out of their mind.

143
00:09:36,869 --> 00:09:38,620
Man...

144
00:10:04,021 --> 00:10:05,355
Try it!

145
00:10:15,199 --> 00:10:16,200
How sweet.

146
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:18,952
FRESHLY PICKED SWEET APPLES
Sweet, right? See?

147
00:10:19,036 --> 00:10:21,371
It's red, glowing,

148
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:23,916
and absolutely delicious-looking!

149
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:29,087
So, why are you giving away
a whole extra bag of such good apples?

150
00:10:29,171 --> 00:10:31,089
You must lose a lot of money doing that.

151
00:10:31,173 --> 00:10:34,593
You're only seeing one side of this,
aren't you?

152
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:36,470
- What now?
- Ladies,

153
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:38,180
it's not just studying
that has a prime era.

154
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:40,265
Fruit also has its peak era.

155
00:10:40,349 --> 00:10:42,142
And when are they most delicious?

156
00:10:42,226 --> 00:10:45,062
Right now! It's at its best right now.

157
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:48,232
Therefore... When? Just today.

158
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:49,441
How many bags?

159
00:10:49,525 --> 00:10:51,777
One extra bag for everyone!

160
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:55,030
If you still don't believe me,
just take one bag.

161
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:57,950
What? Why? I didn't say I didn't want it.

162
00:10:59,243 --> 00:11:01,078
It's just too good to believe.

163
00:11:01,662 --> 00:11:04,373
- Here.
- Let's go. All right.

164
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:06,291
Hold up.

165
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:10,003
These may just look like regular apples,

166
00:11:10,212 --> 00:11:12,673
but they're heavy
because they're filled with honey.

167
00:11:12,756 --> 00:11:13,757
Can you carry them fine?

168
00:11:13,841 --> 00:11:16,510
They're too heavy, even for me to carry!

169
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:19,221
Why not?

170
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:21,473
See?

171
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:25,394
- I'm totally fine.
- Easy. Nice.

172
00:11:25,477 --> 00:11:28,397
I could carry all of this
if you gave it to me for free.

173
00:11:28,939 --> 00:11:31,441
Okay, my special lady.

174
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:32,901
Here's one more for you.

175
00:11:32,985 --> 00:11:34,486
But here's a question.

176
00:11:34,945 --> 00:11:38,532
Do you know what happens
when an apple gets old?

177
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:40,993
What?

178
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:48,458
It becomes a Granny Smith.

179
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:51,420
Granny!

180
00:11:53,088 --> 00:11:53,922
Sure.

181
00:11:55,257 --> 00:11:57,718
- I hope you sell a lot.
- Thanks.

182
00:11:58,552 --> 00:11:59,761
Get home safely!

183
00:11:59,845 --> 00:12:01,096
It's delicious.

184
00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:11,356
Hello, ma'am.
I guess your arm is all good now.

185
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,108
I thought you couldn't even lift a spoon.

186
00:12:14,693 --> 00:12:17,112
Oh! Gosh, I'm still in pain.

187
00:12:17,196 --> 00:12:20,240
I don't have the energy to lift
a single finger,

188
00:12:20,324 --> 00:12:22,659
but I still have housework to do,
so I'm forcing myself.

189
00:12:22,743 --> 00:12:26,580
Come on. I heard you say
you could lift anything heavy just fine.

190
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:29,750
I got it all on camera, thank you.

191
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:32,836
Who gave you permission to film me?

192
00:12:33,295 --> 00:12:35,672
- Who gave you permission?
- Oh, gosh!

193
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:40,844
This is illegal in Korea!

194
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:42,721
Ma'am, wait!

195
00:12:43,555 --> 00:12:48,602
It's all on the dashcam here!

196
00:12:49,061 --> 00:12:50,938
That's not illegal!

197
00:12:51,647 --> 00:12:54,191
Don't be a Granny Smith.

198
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:57,277
Granny Smith!

199
00:12:57,361 --> 00:12:59,363
- Granny Smith!
- What's wrong with you?

200
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:01,615
Granny Smith!

201
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:03,867
- What's with you?
- Two bags!

202
00:13:03,951 --> 00:13:06,703
- Oh, yes!
- That's mine!

203
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:09,498
VEOTIGO INSURANCE

204
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:12,209
Yes.

205
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:14,586
OUR ANSWER LIES ON SITE

206
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:17,464
So, both parties were at fault.

207
00:13:17,548 --> 00:13:20,133
<i>Both parties are technically at fault</i>
<i>because it was a flashing light,</i>

208
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:21,635
<i>but the other car</i>
<i>was most likely speeding.</i>

209
00:13:21,885 --> 00:13:24,137
There must be skid marks or something.

210
00:13:24,221 --> 00:13:25,389
<i>There's nothing.</i>

211
00:13:25,597 --> 00:13:28,809
<i>They rushed for whatever reason</i>
<i>and cleaned up everything within an hour.</i>

212
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:31,103
Any witnesses?

213
00:13:33,105 --> 00:13:34,606
No cars? And the driver?

214
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:39,987
Sure, look into it and call me.

215
00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:43,949
What's all that?

216
00:13:45,284 --> 00:13:46,493
All right.

217
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:50,038
For you and the team to try some.

218
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:55,419
You brought two boxes for us to try some?

219
00:13:56,003 --> 00:13:57,671
Hey!

220
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,007
The orchard owner gave you these,
didn't he?

221
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:02,634
No, he bought it himself.

222
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,387
There are three more boxes
in the parking lot.

223
00:14:06,722 --> 00:14:09,016
Five boxes in total? With what money?

224
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:10,726
With the project fund, of course.

225
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:13,145
You should've seen it.

226
00:14:13,604 --> 00:14:17,649
Ms. Lee carried these two heavy bags
like it was nothing,

227
00:14:17,733 --> 00:14:20,194
and Mr. Kim appeared out of nowhere.

228
00:14:20,277 --> 00:14:23,030
He was like,
"I guess your arm is all good now."

229
00:14:24,948 --> 00:14:26,992
You're the employee of the month.
You're the best.

230
00:14:27,284 --> 00:14:30,162
Orchards are struggling these days.

231
00:14:30,245 --> 00:14:32,831
It's so bad
that this orchard owner set up a truck--

232
00:14:32,915 --> 00:14:34,166
Again?

233
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:36,752
Here's our Mother Theresa again.

234
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:39,296
Are we a charity?

235
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:41,423
Mr. Kim, why didn't you stop him?

236
00:14:41,507 --> 00:14:44,343
Believe me, I tried. But you know him.

237
00:14:44,426 --> 00:14:46,970
He doesn't listen to anyone.

238
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:50,307
This is so much money!

239
00:14:50,432 --> 00:14:51,850
It wasn't much.

240
00:14:52,768 --> 00:14:55,646
It's 400,000 won for 5 boxes,

241
00:14:55,729 --> 00:14:58,148
but I got a huge discount on them.

242
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:00,734
I paid 300,000 won.

243
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,406
- What? Again?
- My blood pressure is rising again.

244
00:15:07,366 --> 00:15:11,578
My gosh! I told you to see a doctor
and get your meds soon!

245
00:15:11,662 --> 00:15:13,956
- Hey.
- My gosh.

246
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:18,043
I'm off to the hospital
to meet with the grasshopper patient.

247
00:15:19,169 --> 00:15:20,796
Hold up.

248
00:15:27,386 --> 00:15:29,388
Such peace without my wife's nagging.

249
00:15:30,347 --> 00:15:32,683
I just want a month of this good rest.

250
00:15:35,561 --> 00:15:37,729
You can easily make it two.

251
00:15:44,486 --> 00:15:45,529
Who's there?

252
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,457
Do you want to know how?

253
00:15:58,834 --> 00:16:02,546
How to look even more in pain
than you already are?

254
00:16:05,424 --> 00:16:07,426
- Get whiny?
- Whiny?

255
00:16:07,926 --> 00:16:10,721
Life is all about a strong mind.

256
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:11,889
A strong mind?

257
00:16:11,972 --> 00:16:15,142
It's a crime and a fraud
to pretend to be in pain when you're not.

258
00:16:15,225 --> 00:16:19,146
So you must know
how to draw the pain from the inside

259
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:21,773
and express it to others.

260
00:16:24,443 --> 00:16:27,321
Oh, gosh, there's my master.

261
00:16:27,404 --> 00:16:28,697
Sorry for not recognizing you sooner.

262
00:16:29,031 --> 00:16:31,575
Master, how do I do that?

263
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:34,036
I can tell
you have a stiff neck and shoulders.

264
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:35,245
That's right.

265
00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:39,958
I jumped into a fire to save people,

266
00:16:40,042 --> 00:16:42,711
and my old shoulder pain

267
00:16:42,794 --> 00:16:45,047
seems to have fired up again
from the shock.

268
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:47,883
Yes, the shock. That's the key.

269
00:16:47,966 --> 00:16:50,219
Now, be in pain sincerely.

270
00:16:50,302 --> 00:16:51,345
This?

271
00:16:52,262 --> 00:16:54,306
Oh, no. My shoulder!

272
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:57,351
My shoulder is now in so much pain
after talking about it.

273
00:16:57,434 --> 00:16:59,811
That's the kind of trauma you experience
after a car accident.

274
00:16:59,895 --> 00:17:01,813
It's so hard to recover from those.

275
00:17:01,897 --> 00:17:04,733
The human body is so fascinating.

276
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:09,279
Man, I think the pain is getting worse.

277
00:17:09,363 --> 00:17:12,574
Right? Good work.
Do that when the insurance company comes.

278
00:17:12,658 --> 00:17:14,910
Thank you for this enlightenment.

279
00:17:14,993 --> 00:17:16,036
It's nothing.

280
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:18,288
You have to get the angle right.

281
00:17:22,626 --> 00:17:23,669
Who are you?

282
00:17:24,127 --> 00:17:25,379
Me?

283
00:17:26,129 --> 00:17:27,214
I...

284
00:17:29,091 --> 00:17:30,300
I'm...

285
00:17:31,969 --> 00:17:35,097
Oh, this guy, Ji Dong-man.

286
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:38,475
- I'm his friend.
- The big bearded guy?

287
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,937
Yes, that's right.
And he's so loud when he chews.

288
00:17:42,229 --> 00:17:43,605
He got discharged yesterday.

289
00:17:44,565 --> 00:17:45,732
Oh, really?

290
00:17:46,942 --> 00:17:51,405
He didn't say anything about leaving
when I spoke to him on the phone.

291
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:53,615
Hey, look at me.

292
00:17:56,618 --> 00:17:58,954
Man, he's not picking up.

293
00:17:59,872 --> 00:18:02,291
That's too bad.
I can't bring these apples back.

294
00:18:03,542 --> 00:18:05,836
Put them here. They look heavy.

295
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,379
Yes, put them over here.

296
00:18:07,713 --> 00:18:08,755
Sure.

297
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:11,884
You two can share.
You must eat well to get better soon.

298
00:18:14,303 --> 00:18:15,387
My goodness.

299
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:18,557
These apples are top-notch.

300
00:18:18,807 --> 00:18:21,810
Right? You know your apples.

301
00:18:21,894 --> 00:18:26,190
I gave some to a friend,
and he said all apples were the same.

302
00:18:26,481 --> 00:18:29,568
- Thank you.
- I run a grocery store

303
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:32,821
and can tell an apple's Brix
just by its color.

304
00:18:32,905 --> 00:18:34,406
A grocery store.

305
00:18:35,532 --> 00:18:38,452
No wonder you have a good eye.

306
00:18:39,286 --> 00:18:42,539
By the way, how did you two end up here?

307
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:45,918
Me? You know, an accident.

308
00:18:46,001 --> 00:18:47,586
Right, an accident.

309
00:18:49,463 --> 00:18:50,506
And you, Mr. Grocery Store?

310
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:55,135
You know, a car accident.

311
00:19:02,684 --> 00:19:04,269
You have to find the right point.

312
00:19:04,353 --> 00:19:08,649
Now that I've found it,
my shoulder is suddenly in so much pain.

313
00:19:08,732 --> 00:19:10,108
No way.

314
00:19:11,193 --> 00:19:13,153
How's that possible? You're lying.

315
00:19:13,237 --> 00:19:15,572
- No, I'm not.
- Liar.

316
00:19:15,656 --> 00:19:17,115
- I don't believe you.
- No.

317
00:19:18,033 --> 00:19:20,077
I didn't believe him at first, either.

318
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,330
But I did as he told me, and it worked.

319
00:19:23,413 --> 00:19:25,040
Really?

320
00:19:25,874 --> 00:19:27,000
How long have you been here for?

321
00:19:27,376 --> 00:19:29,586
It's been about three months for me.

322
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:32,965
I've moved between hospitals,
depending on where it hurts.

323
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:36,593
Master, how can you change where it hurts?

324
00:19:36,677 --> 00:19:38,428
Show me your ways.

325
00:19:38,971 --> 00:19:41,515
- Are you curious?
- Yes, we are!

326
00:19:41,598 --> 00:19:42,766
Absolutely.

327
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:45,978
Okay, so...

328
00:19:50,357 --> 00:19:51,984
Why am I getting a call?

329
00:19:53,527 --> 00:19:55,612
Excuse me. I have to take this.

330
00:19:55,696 --> 00:19:57,322
Don't share your secret until I'm back.

331
00:19:57,406 --> 00:19:59,825
- I'm curious, too.
- Just take the call here.

332
00:20:00,576 --> 00:20:01,410
Okay.

333
00:20:02,703 --> 00:20:04,913
What now? This is an important moment.

334
00:20:04,997 --> 00:20:07,416
Every moment I've worked with you
has felt very important.

335
00:20:07,499 --> 00:20:08,834
When I first met you, I--

336
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:10,419
<i>Are you confessing your love to me?</i>

337
00:20:10,794 --> 00:20:12,880
I'm married, so are you sure?

338
00:20:12,963 --> 00:20:13,797
<i>What?</i>

339
00:20:15,382 --> 00:20:19,052
Whatever.
There's a Kim Su-il at that hospital.

340
00:20:20,512 --> 00:20:21,722
KIM **-IL

341
00:20:22,639 --> 00:20:25,017
Is he a witness? Okay.

342
00:20:27,186 --> 00:20:28,937
Really?

343
00:20:29,646 --> 00:20:31,440
I passed by there.

344
00:20:32,816 --> 00:20:33,901
Okay.

345
00:20:39,281 --> 00:20:41,200
- That's funny.
- How's the apple?

346
00:20:47,956 --> 00:20:49,082
Honey...

347
00:20:50,417 --> 00:20:53,212
I told you
to get the scratch on your face treated.

348
00:20:54,338 --> 00:20:55,547
But here you are, hospitalized.

349
00:20:56,256 --> 00:20:58,467
Are you in a lot of pain?

350
00:20:58,926 --> 00:21:02,513
That's too bad.
We've got deliveries backed up.

351
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:05,057
Honey, it's not what you think.

352
00:21:05,849 --> 00:21:08,352
Car accidents lead to trauma.

353
00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:09,728
Car accidents?

354
00:21:09,853 --> 00:21:11,813
I wasn't the driver,

355
00:21:11,897 --> 00:21:15,776
but I dove into a huge fire of ashes
to save others--

356
00:21:15,859 --> 00:21:16,818
A huge fire?

357
00:21:18,445 --> 00:21:19,363
I...

358
00:21:19,446 --> 00:21:20,697
Mr. Kim Su-il.

359
00:21:21,448 --> 00:21:25,035
You're the witness of the collision
at the Kiyun Intersection earlier, right?

360
00:21:26,078 --> 00:21:27,246
Who are you?

361
00:21:29,206 --> 00:21:31,917
Oh, I'm from Veotigo Insurance.

362
00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:34,628
I'm Choi Kang of the SIU Team. Here.

363
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:36,630
What does "SIU" stand for?

364
00:21:36,713 --> 00:21:39,925
"Special Investigation Unit,"

365
00:21:40,008 --> 00:21:42,469
so, a unit that conducts
special investigations.

366
00:21:42,553 --> 00:21:44,847
Oh, my back!

367
00:21:45,806 --> 00:21:48,851
I deal with people who are in pain
whenever they see me,

368
00:21:48,934 --> 00:21:52,104
as well as fake diagnoses,
overtreatment, and fraudulent claims.

369
00:21:52,187 --> 00:21:54,606
I do all sorts of things
to investigate these cases.

370
00:21:55,482 --> 00:21:58,151
Sir, it's too late. I recorded everything.

371
00:21:58,694 --> 00:22:01,154
So, you're saying
Veotigo Insurance is here

372
00:22:01,238 --> 00:22:04,449
to compensate
for the scar on my husband's face?

373
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:07,286
We'll have to discuss the details later,

374
00:22:07,661 --> 00:22:09,538
but basically, yes.

375
00:22:09,872 --> 00:22:14,084
But before that, he must tell us in detail
what happened on site.

376
00:22:14,168 --> 00:22:16,211
Let me say one thing before that.

377
00:22:17,004 --> 00:22:19,089
I'm getting him discharged now,

378
00:22:19,173 --> 00:22:22,634
so we'd just like
a fair amount of compensation.

379
00:22:22,718 --> 00:22:25,012
I'll nurse him back to good health

380
00:22:25,095 --> 00:22:28,265
and make sure he doesn't complain
about neck pain or anything later.

381
00:22:28,891 --> 00:22:30,934
Honey, my neck really does hurt.

382
00:22:31,018 --> 00:22:32,853
But I think I'm all good now.

383
00:22:35,647 --> 00:22:36,523
Okay.

384
00:22:37,274 --> 00:22:38,650
You were on site, right?

385
00:22:40,485 --> 00:22:42,779
- Yes.
- What happened?

386
00:22:43,488 --> 00:22:45,324
So much happened.

387
00:22:46,074 --> 00:22:49,912
I don't know where to begin or end.

388
00:22:49,995 --> 00:22:52,623
From how you snuck out at night
to drink your brains out?

389
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:55,584
All right.

390
00:22:56,502 --> 00:22:59,171
So, my buddy, Byeong-nam...

391
00:24:01,608 --> 00:24:03,318
Gosh, hot.

392
00:24:04,027 --> 00:24:05,779
Oh, man.

393
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:09,408
Here.

394
00:24:14,162 --> 00:24:15,038
No way.

395
00:24:15,789 --> 00:24:17,499
Can it corner properly now?

396
00:24:17,583 --> 00:24:20,836
It was off-balance because it was old.
I just added some weight in the front.

397
00:24:22,296 --> 00:24:23,297
That's sick.

398
00:24:24,047 --> 00:24:26,175
- You're sick, sir.
- Sick?

399
00:24:27,259 --> 00:24:29,136
- You ate this up.
- Ate this?

400
00:24:29,469 --> 00:24:30,679
Eat what?

401
00:24:31,597 --> 00:24:35,017
Anyway, I fixed the balance,
but come back if it's still not good.

402
00:24:36,393 --> 00:24:37,895
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

403
00:24:37,978 --> 00:24:39,771
- Goodbye.
- Have a good day.

404
00:24:40,731 --> 00:24:43,192
August, 2025...

405
00:24:44,818 --> 00:24:47,362
Byeong-nam, come out! It's your bro!

406
00:24:48,447 --> 00:24:49,531
Man.

407
00:24:50,532 --> 00:24:51,700
HARDWARE DREAM TREE STATIONERY
Byeong-nam!

408
00:24:52,701 --> 00:24:53,744
What now?

409
00:24:54,786 --> 00:24:57,247
How are you feeling?

410
00:24:57,664 --> 00:25:01,001
Don't you see me making deliveries
right after getting discharged?

411
00:25:01,084 --> 00:25:02,878
Discharged? When were you admitted?

412
00:25:02,961 --> 00:25:05,214
This morning! Why didn't you come?

413
00:25:05,297 --> 00:25:08,675
You got admitted and discharged
in just one morning?

414
00:25:10,177 --> 00:25:11,553
You're sick.

415
00:25:12,554 --> 00:25:13,388
Sick?

416
00:25:13,972 --> 00:25:15,307
You ate it up.

417
00:25:16,767 --> 00:25:18,393
Who taught you new slang words?

418
00:25:19,061 --> 00:25:20,729
Whatever. Anyway,

419
00:25:20,812 --> 00:25:22,856
my wife is in a bad mood today,
so don't come to our store.

420
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:24,399
Go to the convenience store
if you need anything.

421
00:25:24,608 --> 00:25:27,277
Stop going behind her back like that.
That's why she scolds you.

422
00:25:27,361 --> 00:25:29,488
Go before she gets even angrier. Go.

423
00:25:29,571 --> 00:25:31,240
What do you say? A drink tonight?

424
00:25:31,657 --> 00:25:33,408
- Sure, go.
- You down?

425
00:25:33,492 --> 00:25:36,370
- Sure.
- Okay, sick.

426
00:25:36,453 --> 00:25:38,455
Just get going already.

427
00:25:39,665 --> 00:25:42,417
Call me for a drink later, okay?

428
00:25:48,048 --> 00:25:49,216
You're pathetic.

429
00:25:56,932 --> 00:25:58,016
CAR INSURANCE CERTIFICATE

430
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:00,435
CAR OWNER INFORMATION

431
00:26:23,667 --> 00:26:25,586
Why am I so good at my job?

432
00:26:25,669 --> 00:26:28,797
It's not even lunchtime yet,
and I've already handled two cases.

433
00:26:29,631 --> 00:26:31,675
That's who I am, Boss.

434
00:26:32,092 --> 00:26:33,343
You seem giddy.

435
00:26:34,052 --> 00:26:35,762
You got Mr. Grasshopper's agreement?

436
00:26:35,846 --> 00:26:37,139
Of course.

437
00:26:37,222 --> 00:26:39,349
I got him confessing
about moving between three hospitals

438
00:26:39,433 --> 00:26:42,811
and about his special ability
to use his mind to bring out pain.

439
00:26:42,895 --> 00:26:44,188
It's all in here.

440
00:26:44,271 --> 00:26:46,607
Special ability?
Is he claiming to be mentally ill now?

441
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,817
No, it's not like that.

442
00:26:49,067 --> 00:26:53,030
But if he did that,
I wouldn't let him off the hook easily.

443
00:26:53,238 --> 00:26:56,033
You know me. I don't let anything slide.

444
00:26:57,326 --> 00:26:59,077
Is this the accident site?

445
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:01,997
There wasn't anything this morning
on my way to work.

446
00:27:02,998 --> 00:27:04,917
Huh? You don't drive through here
to get to work.

447
00:27:05,959 --> 00:27:07,794
I moved.

448
00:27:07,878 --> 00:27:10,839
To the neighborhood up there.
I told you last time.

449
00:27:12,466 --> 00:27:14,468
That neighborhood
is getting all the attention nowadays.

450
00:27:17,221 --> 00:27:20,641
It was your wife's idea, wasn't it?

451
00:27:20,933 --> 00:27:23,435
So, how much do you think
you'll earn from the property?

452
00:27:25,938 --> 00:27:30,275
That's only for my wife to know.
I know nothing.

453
00:27:30,359 --> 00:27:31,568
Man, let go.

454
00:27:31,652 --> 00:27:34,613
I just pack and unpack as I'm told.

455
00:27:36,156 --> 00:27:37,658
What are you looking for?

456
00:27:37,866 --> 00:27:39,243
Anything odd.

457
00:27:40,661 --> 00:27:46,208
Why were they in such a rush
to clean it all up in an hour?

458
00:27:46,792 --> 00:27:48,377
The car exploded.

459
00:27:49,044 --> 00:27:51,338
They must've cleaned it up
because the fragments were a hazard.

460
00:27:52,589 --> 00:27:54,007
You know what's really fishy?

461
00:27:54,967 --> 00:27:57,886
There's nothing
on the other car or the driver.

462
00:27:57,970 --> 00:28:01,598
No idea whether they're alive or dead.
But the other car is more at fault.

463
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,726
Was it not caught
on the dashcam from our side?

464
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:09,398
There's no dashcam or anything.
Everything was shattered.

465
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:12,025
You can take this case.

466
00:28:14,653 --> 00:28:15,696
Me?

467
00:28:15,779 --> 00:28:17,197
You live nearby.

468
00:28:17,698 --> 00:28:19,783
That's not a good reason to take a case.

469
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:24,371
Sang-guk is
in charge of site investigations.

470
00:28:24,454 --> 00:28:27,624
Sang-guk is on five cases right now.

471
00:28:28,417 --> 00:28:32,004
Use your special ability or whatever
to trace the other car and its driver.

472
00:28:32,087 --> 00:28:34,840
That ability isn't mine!
Have you even been listening?

473
00:28:39,678 --> 00:28:40,762
Man.

474
00:28:56,737 --> 00:28:59,281
- Dismiss us already.
- Come on!

475
00:29:00,699 --> 00:29:03,660
- What is it?
- That's still better.

476
00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:06,121
<i>Hello, this is Min-seo's mom.</i>

477
00:29:06,205 --> 00:29:08,707
<i>Let's do the level test at the store</i>
<i>instead of at home.</i>

478
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,501
<i>I can't leave the store unoccupied.</i>

479
00:29:11,168 --> 00:29:12,920
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

480
00:29:13,003 --> 00:29:14,213
Everyone.

481
00:29:15,631 --> 00:29:19,218
There won't be a discharge ceremony,
as the Battalion Commander is at his base.

482
00:29:22,012 --> 00:29:24,765
You're excused once you complete the drill
that was canceled due to rain yesterday.

483
00:29:25,432 --> 00:29:26,767
Hey, a drink after this?

484
00:29:27,351 --> 00:29:28,852
I have to go for Min-seo's level test.

485
00:29:28,936 --> 00:29:31,813
Come on. Let's drink. Please?

486
00:29:31,897 --> 00:29:32,940
After.

487
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:35,234
There's no discharge ceremony,
and this is the last drill,

488
00:29:35,317 --> 00:29:37,945
so let's have you
disassemble and assemble guns.

489
00:29:38,028 --> 00:29:39,488
TRAINING RESERVED FORCES
TO SERVE THE NATION

490
00:29:39,571 --> 00:29:41,198
- Come on!
- It's the last task.

491
00:29:41,281 --> 00:29:42,324
A gun?

492
00:29:42,407 --> 00:29:45,577
Should we make a bet
to make you focus better?

493
00:29:46,245 --> 00:29:50,249
I'll let you out early
if you're better than our trainer, okay?

494
00:29:50,666 --> 00:29:52,835
- Sweet!
- You said you were good!

495
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:55,420
Do you remember how to do that?

496
00:29:57,965 --> 00:29:59,174
What are you doing?

497
00:29:59,591 --> 00:30:01,385
HOW TO DISASSEMBLE AND ASSEMBLE A K2 RIFLE

498
00:30:04,096 --> 00:30:07,558
Sir, will you really let us off early
if we beat the trainer?

499
00:30:08,809 --> 00:30:11,770
He's the fastest in our battalion.
Are you sure?

500
00:30:14,398 --> 00:30:15,566
He accepts the challenge!

501
00:30:18,026 --> 00:30:18,986
Are you kidding me?

502
00:30:23,699 --> 00:30:25,325
- You still got it!
- Let's go!

503
00:30:25,951 --> 00:30:27,035
Ready,

504
00:30:27,494 --> 00:30:29,705
set, go!

505
00:30:49,516 --> 00:30:52,311
Fifty-eight seconds. A new record.

506
00:30:54,938 --> 00:30:56,481
You're insane, Jeong-hwan!

507
00:30:57,065 --> 00:30:58,984
Totally insane! Awesome!

508
00:31:00,611 --> 00:31:01,904
You did it!

509
00:31:15,792 --> 00:31:17,252
You'd better pay for the beer today.

510
00:31:17,377 --> 00:31:18,587
No!

511
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:20,547
- Get out, then.
- Sorry.

512
00:31:27,054 --> 00:31:28,263
It's like we're on a trip.

513
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:44,905
KINDERGARTEN

514
00:31:50,202 --> 00:31:51,954
SPECIAL MARTIAL ARTS YONGMU GYM

515
00:31:52,037 --> 00:31:53,914
- Hello.
- Hello.

516
00:31:53,997 --> 00:31:56,333
Stand straight! Salute to the master.

517
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:57,709
- Salute!
- Salute!

518
00:31:57,793 --> 00:31:59,545
- Salute!
- Welcome.

519
00:31:59,628 --> 00:32:01,338
- Come in.
- Get in.

520
00:32:01,421 --> 00:32:02,798
- Hello, Master.
- Hello.

521
00:32:02,881 --> 00:32:04,508
Watch your steps.

522
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:06,134
Be careful.

523
00:32:06,844 --> 00:32:09,429
Hello, you're a new face.

524
00:32:09,972 --> 00:32:12,516
- She's a new student starting today.
- Is she?

525
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:13,767
What's your name?

526
00:32:13,851 --> 00:32:15,060
Choi Do-yeon.

527
00:32:15,143 --> 00:32:16,520
I see, Do-yeon.

528
00:32:16,603 --> 00:32:21,733
You'd have so much fun
training with your friends after class.

529
00:32:22,943 --> 00:32:26,488
Make sure to ask your mom to sign you up
when you go home, okay?

530
00:32:28,866 --> 00:32:31,159
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

531
00:32:44,089 --> 00:32:45,340
Dad!

532
00:32:45,632 --> 00:32:46,842
Hey!

533
00:32:48,719 --> 00:32:50,429
You're right on time.

534
00:32:58,854 --> 00:33:00,314
Hello!

535
00:33:00,731 --> 00:33:03,567
I'm right on time.
I was ten seconds too early.

536
00:33:05,694 --> 00:33:06,778
Sure.

537
00:33:06,862 --> 00:33:08,614
See you tomorrow, Do-yeon.

538
00:33:08,697 --> 00:33:10,991
Bye. Goodbye, sir.

539
00:33:11,074 --> 00:33:13,410
- Thank you.
- Bye.

540
00:33:16,205 --> 00:33:19,166
How was the new kindergarten?
Did you have fun with your new friends?

541
00:33:19,249 --> 00:33:21,585
Yes, we made stuffed bunnies.

542
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:25,464
Dad, I want to go to the martial arts gym
instead of ballet.

543
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:27,841
- A martial arts gym?
- Yes.

544
00:33:27,925 --> 00:33:31,136
All my friends left in the gym van,
except me.

545
00:33:32,679 --> 00:33:33,680
I see.

546
00:33:36,975 --> 00:33:40,395
SPECIAL MARTIAL ARTS YONGMU GYM

547
00:33:40,604 --> 00:33:43,899
Focus!

548
00:33:44,233 --> 00:33:47,736
If you die,
you're a liability to your team!

549
00:33:47,819 --> 00:33:48,987
Jump!

550
00:33:52,533 --> 00:33:55,202
Watch out for your comrades!
Or else, they'll die!

551
00:33:55,285 --> 00:33:56,411
Jump!

552
00:34:00,541 --> 00:34:02,626
I'm sorry, my comrades.

553
00:34:04,253 --> 00:34:05,170
Let me up.

554
00:34:05,254 --> 00:34:07,673
- Okay.
- Let's go again!

555
00:34:07,756 --> 00:34:09,341
Do-yeon is here! Are you her father?

556
00:34:09,424 --> 00:34:10,717
Where are you going?

557
00:34:10,801 --> 00:34:13,262
Okay, let me go!

558
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:14,805
Ready!

559
00:34:16,598 --> 00:34:17,891
Kick one!

560
00:34:20,519 --> 00:34:21,770
Kick two!

561
00:34:24,147 --> 00:34:25,274
Kick three!

562
00:34:25,399 --> 00:34:26,984
As you can see,

563
00:34:27,067 --> 00:34:30,279
it's excellent for increasing stamina
and stimulating growth.

564
00:34:30,362 --> 00:34:31,446
Kick two!

565
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:34,449
And our classes are all about having fun,

566
00:34:34,533 --> 00:34:36,076
so kids really love it here.

567
00:34:36,535 --> 00:34:38,745
- Yes?
- I need to use the bathroom.

568
00:34:38,829 --> 00:34:40,163
You want to use the bathroom?

569
00:34:40,247 --> 00:34:43,041
Master Kim, he needs to use the bathroom!

570
00:34:43,125 --> 00:34:44,126
- Okay!
- Okay.

571
00:34:45,002 --> 00:34:49,381
Most importantly, we watch kids
in double-income households.

572
00:34:49,464 --> 00:34:51,383
After the kids finish with classes,

573
00:34:51,466 --> 00:34:54,094
they come and stay here
until their parents are off work,

574
00:34:54,178 --> 00:34:56,013
and the parents
can pick them up from here.

575
00:34:56,096 --> 00:34:57,723
What is it, A-rin?

576
00:34:57,806 --> 00:34:59,600
Join us already, Master.

577
00:34:59,683 --> 00:35:03,103
Okay, but I'm talking to someone now.

578
00:35:03,312 --> 00:35:04,688
- Go back.
- Okay.

579
00:35:05,606 --> 00:35:06,481
Hurry.

580
00:35:11,111 --> 00:35:13,280
And if you're worried about safety,

581
00:35:13,363 --> 00:35:16,241
you can check on your kid
via the real-time webcam app.

582
00:35:19,953 --> 00:35:21,455
- Here you go, sir.
- Right.

584
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,585
Kids seem to love you.

585
00:35:26,668 --> 00:35:28,462
Of course, they adore me.

586
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:33,008
Please review it and let me know.

587
00:35:33,383 --> 00:35:36,220
Okay, I'll call you after I read it.

588
00:35:36,303 --> 00:35:37,888
Okay, thank you!

MAMMOSEU MART

590
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,268
Eat up. That's the way to go.

591
00:35:43,352 --> 00:35:45,896
- How much have you brought?
- So much.

592
00:35:45,979 --> 00:35:48,565
- She brought all kinds of stuff.
- My gosh.

593
00:35:48,649 --> 00:35:50,609
- Let's eat.
- Goodness.

594
00:35:51,401 --> 00:35:53,445
- Split it.
- It's hot. Let me do it.

595
00:35:54,154 --> 00:35:55,322
So hot!

596
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:59,910
Min-seo's tutor is coming here later.

597
00:35:59,993 --> 00:36:02,955
- Myeong-o told me. Is it today?
- Yes.

598
00:36:03,121 --> 00:36:04,665
Is Myeong-o tutoring Min-seo?

599
00:36:04,748 --> 00:36:06,333
No, Myeong-o got a job.

600
00:36:06,416 --> 00:36:08,293
Not Myeong-o, but his friend.

601
00:36:09,586 --> 00:36:10,546
Hold on.

602
00:36:11,004 --> 00:36:14,800
He's Myeong-o's closest friend
from college.

603
00:36:14,883 --> 00:36:16,552
He must be so smart, then.

604
00:36:16,635 --> 00:36:17,928
That's a new face.

605
00:36:19,179 --> 00:36:20,222
Is he new around here?

606
00:36:23,725 --> 00:36:24,601
Hello.

607
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:26,937
You're the insurance guy, right?

608
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:28,021
Yes.

609
00:36:28,105 --> 00:36:29,523
You live around here?

610
00:36:29,606 --> 00:36:31,900
- Yes, we just moved here yesterday.
- I see.

611
00:36:32,484 --> 00:36:33,735
How's your husband?

612
00:36:33,819 --> 00:36:37,072
He's totally fine.
He's out for deliveries.

613
00:36:37,781 --> 00:36:39,491
He should rest a bit.

614
00:36:41,869 --> 00:36:43,620
I'm glad he recovered so quickly!

615
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:47,499
Hi, cutie, how old are you?

616
00:36:47,583 --> 00:36:48,834
I'm six.

617
00:36:48,917 --> 00:36:50,419
What a smart girl.

618
00:36:50,919 --> 00:36:53,297
My daughter was also smart
when she was six.

619
00:36:54,548 --> 00:36:56,216
Let's see.

620
00:36:56,675 --> 00:36:59,636
Here. This is my welcome gift to you.

621
00:37:03,098 --> 00:37:05,684
It's okay. You can take gifts from me.

622
00:37:06,602 --> 00:37:07,811
Say, "Thank you."

623
00:37:08,687 --> 00:37:10,772
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

624
00:37:11,398 --> 00:37:14,526
The lady over there brought these corns.

625
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:16,737
Have some. They're sweet.

626
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:18,530
- Okay, thank you.
- You're welcome.

627
00:37:19,489 --> 00:37:20,657
Thank you.

628
00:37:20,741 --> 00:37:21,700
Let's go.

629
00:37:22,034 --> 00:37:23,493
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

630
00:37:23,994 --> 00:37:25,454
- Bye, cutie!
- Bye.

631
00:37:25,537 --> 00:37:27,122
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

632
00:37:27,206 --> 00:37:28,832
I should've had a daughter, too.

633
00:37:28,916 --> 00:37:30,417
It's not too late to have one now.

634
00:37:30,501 --> 00:37:31,668
Yes, it is.

HARDWARE DREAM TREE STATIONERY

636
00:37:39,718 --> 00:37:43,055
We're only getting one, okay?

637
00:37:43,222 --> 00:37:44,765
You can't beg me for two.

638
00:37:44,932 --> 00:37:47,392
Okay, just one bunny sticker.

639
00:37:47,476 --> 00:37:49,311
- Okay.
- Okay.

640
00:37:49,394 --> 00:37:50,896
- Go.
- Go.

641
00:37:55,317 --> 00:37:56,944
Hello?

642
00:37:59,988 --> 00:38:01,907
Welcome.

643
00:38:02,824 --> 00:38:04,743
- What would you like?
- A bunny sticker, please.

644
00:38:04,826 --> 00:38:06,328
A bunny sticker?

645
00:38:06,411 --> 00:38:08,038
The stickers are here. Choose one.

646
00:38:08,121 --> 00:38:09,206
There they are.

647
00:38:13,752 --> 00:38:17,047
Do-yeon, I'm going to go
to the hardware store next door.

648
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:19,091
- Choose your sticker and wait, okay?
- Okay.

649
00:38:19,508 --> 00:38:23,262
I'll watch her, so don't worry and go.

650
00:38:23,637 --> 00:38:25,430
- Okay, thank you.
- You're welcome.

651
00:38:25,514 --> 00:38:27,140
- I'll be right back.
- Sure.

652
00:38:30,227 --> 00:38:31,770
There you go.

653
00:38:31,854 --> 00:38:35,107
HARDWARE DREAM TREE STATIONERY

654
00:38:40,529 --> 00:38:41,780
Hello?

655
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:43,907
Welcome.

656
00:38:44,366 --> 00:38:45,409
Hi, I'm...

657
00:38:50,747 --> 00:38:53,083
I just saw you! Are you twins?

658
00:38:53,166 --> 00:38:55,460
What a nightmare that'd be.

659
00:38:55,669 --> 00:38:58,422
The world doesn't need one more of this.

660
00:39:00,257 --> 00:39:01,258
Of course not.

661
00:39:06,096 --> 00:39:09,433
No, I don't mean
the world doesn't need one more of you.

662
00:39:09,975 --> 00:39:12,019
I was just laughing along.

663
00:39:14,188 --> 00:39:15,606
I don't know how I feel about that.

664
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,608
Here.

665
00:39:19,776 --> 00:39:20,986
I run both stores.

666
00:39:22,654 --> 00:39:26,742
No wonder the sign read
"Hardware Dream Tree Stationery"!

667
00:39:26,825 --> 00:39:27,784
Dream Tree in the middle,

668
00:39:27,868 --> 00:39:29,578
hardware on the left,
and stationery on the right!

669
00:39:29,661 --> 00:39:31,622
Something like that.

670
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:32,789
What do you need?

671
00:39:33,624 --> 00:39:34,750
I need converter plugs.

672
00:39:35,209 --> 00:39:37,419
My wife loves to order things from abroad.

673
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:40,797
Do you want the one with a lot of plugs?

674
00:39:40,881 --> 00:39:41,882
Yes, please.

675
00:39:43,258 --> 00:39:44,676
Let's see...

676
00:39:47,262 --> 00:39:49,097
Here. That'll be 15,000 won.

677
00:39:50,557 --> 00:39:51,600
What?

678
00:39:53,268 --> 00:39:56,522
But it's 7,000 won online.

679
00:39:58,732 --> 00:40:01,902
Even the recommended sales price
reads 12,000 won.

680
00:40:04,655 --> 00:40:07,157
That's just a recommendation.

681
00:40:07,241 --> 00:40:08,158
I sell things

682
00:40:08,951 --> 00:40:11,662
at my recommended prices.

683
00:40:11,828 --> 00:40:16,208
Instead, when you buy from me,
you get a lifetime warranty.

684
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,628
Get one online if you don't like it.

685
00:40:23,507 --> 00:40:26,635
Okay, we have to trust our neighbors.

686
00:40:27,261 --> 00:40:28,637
My goodness, all right.

687
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,389
Do you live in this area?

688
00:40:30,597 --> 00:40:32,349
Yes, I moved in just yesterday.

689
00:40:32,432 --> 00:40:33,433
I see.

690
00:40:34,184 --> 00:40:36,186
You moved in yesterday?

691
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:38,313
Yes, in the apartment up there.

692
00:40:39,398 --> 00:40:41,358
In the apartment?

693
00:40:45,195 --> 00:40:47,030
You can pay for everything next door.

694
00:40:47,739 --> 00:40:48,740
Sure.

695
00:40:55,122 --> 00:40:58,041
This is a present from me.

696
00:40:59,877 --> 00:41:02,087
It's the same as the one the lady gave me
at the grocery store.

697
00:41:02,629 --> 00:41:04,590
- Did she already give you one?
- Yes.

698
00:41:05,299 --> 00:41:07,593
Then let me make it two.

699
00:41:10,804 --> 00:41:12,139
It's all right. Take it.

700
00:41:12,598 --> 00:41:13,974
Thank you.

701
00:41:15,267 --> 00:41:16,935
- Have a good day.
- Thanks.

702
00:41:17,019 --> 00:41:18,437
- Let's go, Do-yeon.
- Okay.

703
00:41:19,438 --> 00:41:20,272
By the way,

704
00:41:24,067 --> 00:41:27,946
if you have broken toys or dolls,
you can bring them to me.

705
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:29,573
I'll fix everything for you.

706
00:41:29,656 --> 00:41:31,742
Okay. Goodbye.

707
00:41:31,825 --> 00:41:34,119
- See you around.
- Okay.

708
00:41:45,923 --> 00:41:47,966
MAMMOSEU MART

709
00:41:57,476 --> 00:41:59,019
What's this?

710
00:41:59,102 --> 00:42:00,229
Hello.

711
00:42:03,315 --> 00:42:04,274
Hello.

712
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:07,277
Hey, Myeong-o.
Are you back from reservist training?

713
00:42:07,361 --> 00:42:10,030
Yes, and this is Jeong-hwan.

714
00:42:10,113 --> 00:42:11,990
Hello, I'm Park Jeong-hwan.

715
00:42:12,783 --> 00:42:14,159
Myeong-o has told me a lot about you.

716
00:42:15,077 --> 00:42:17,496
Adorable. I got lucky.

717
00:42:17,579 --> 00:42:19,248
- You can sit here.
- Okay.

718
00:42:19,665 --> 00:42:20,874
- Call me when you're done.
- Thanks.

719
00:42:20,958 --> 00:42:22,084
- I'll get going, then.
- Okay.

720
00:42:22,167 --> 00:42:23,669
- Bye.
- Bye.

721
00:42:24,795 --> 00:42:27,214
Honey, finish this up for me!

722
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:34,304
Here.

723
00:42:36,765 --> 00:42:40,978
Myeong-o didn't mention
how handsome you were.

724
00:42:42,604 --> 00:42:44,022
Thank you.

725
00:42:44,815 --> 00:42:45,899
Gross, military uniform.

726
00:42:46,483 --> 00:42:47,818
It's gross for me, too.

727
00:42:49,194 --> 00:42:50,737
Don't talk to your teacher like that.

728
00:42:50,821 --> 00:42:53,073
I had to come
right after my reservist training.

729
00:42:54,074 --> 00:42:55,826
Maybe I should've changed.

730
00:42:55,909 --> 00:42:56,827
It's fine.

731
00:42:56,910 --> 00:42:59,246
Men who look good in uniforms
are really handsome.

732
00:42:59,329 --> 00:43:00,163
Thank you.

733
00:43:00,998 --> 00:43:01,832
"Handsome"?

734
00:43:02,499 --> 00:43:03,959
You couldn't pay me to wear that.

735
00:43:04,042 --> 00:43:06,378
Every Korean man
has worn military uniforms.

736
00:43:07,296 --> 00:43:09,590
Min-seo, why don't we start
with a simple level test?

737
00:43:09,673 --> 00:43:12,885
Can't we just start from the basics?
I'm unbelievably dumb.

738
00:43:13,677 --> 00:43:14,845
Wow, lucky you.

739
00:43:15,888 --> 00:43:19,391
She suddenly became so determined to study
just a few days ago.

740
00:43:19,474 --> 00:43:20,434
No idea why.

741
00:43:20,517 --> 00:43:23,020
I told you.
I'm going to become the next Sullivan.

742
00:43:23,103 --> 00:43:24,813
You know James Sullivan, right?

743
00:43:24,897 --> 00:43:28,108
Of course. I'm sure good things will come
if you work hard, too.

744
00:43:28,734 --> 00:43:29,693
That's true.

745
00:43:29,776 --> 00:43:32,779
She's starting from zero,
so if you can just stack some knowledge...

746
00:43:32,863 --> 00:43:34,364
Stop it, Mom.

747
00:43:34,448 --> 00:43:36,408
Honey, we have a foreign customer.

748
00:43:36,491 --> 00:43:37,576
Okay.

749
00:43:37,659 --> 00:43:39,661
- Please teach her well.
- I'll do my best.

750
00:43:39,745 --> 00:43:40,996
- Okay.
- Thank you.

751
00:43:42,539 --> 00:43:44,708
Let's try working on this problem first.

752
00:43:54,885 --> 00:43:56,929
- Have some snacks at night, okay?
- Okay.

753
00:43:57,012 --> 00:43:58,972
Thank you for the snacks.

754
00:43:59,056 --> 00:44:01,767
I love how polite you are.

755
00:44:03,227 --> 00:44:04,520
Thanks for your work, even in the heat.

756
00:44:06,104 --> 00:44:07,314
Come back tomorrow.

757
00:44:07,397 --> 00:44:09,316
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

758
00:44:12,653 --> 00:44:14,071
Good work today.

759
00:44:15,364 --> 00:44:17,783
Hope you enjoy. See you.

760
00:44:17,866 --> 00:44:19,785

- I think so.

SURGE IN CORPORATE PURCHASES,
CONCERNS OVER OVERHEATING PROPERTY MARKET

764
00:44:45,561 --> 00:44:48,272
<i>Some are commenting</i>
<i>about the high demand for investments...</i>

765
00:44:48,355 --> 00:44:51,900
The boss complimented you earlier today

766
00:44:51,984 --> 00:44:53,944
for buying a home
in the hottest area at the time.

767
00:44:54,570 --> 00:44:56,530
He's envious of me
for having such a smart wife.

768
00:44:57,739 --> 00:45:02,202
So, I got mad and corrected him.

769
00:45:04,872 --> 00:45:06,957
Because you're not just smart.

770
00:45:07,457 --> 00:45:10,210
You're the smartest wife.

771
00:45:11,253 --> 00:45:12,504
Lucky you.

772
00:45:13,297 --> 00:45:16,091
I'd love to meet a smart husband
and live a happy life, too.

773
00:45:18,343 --> 00:45:20,762
I know you're happy to live with me.

774
00:45:20,888 --> 00:45:22,556
See? Money isn't everything.

775
00:45:22,973 --> 00:45:26,143
Talk to me after you check your salary.

776
00:45:27,227 --> 00:45:30,439
How can I check that? You get my salary.

777
00:45:30,814 --> 00:45:33,233
My heart is too frail to check it,
isn't that right?

778
00:45:33,317 --> 00:45:35,068
- Your heart isn't weak.
- <i>Next story.</i>

779

00:46:12,814 --> 00:46:15,400
- You know what that means, right?
- I do. It'll work out.

792
00:46:16,693 --> 00:46:18,570
We need to look for
Do-yeon's after-class program, too.

793
00:46:18,862 --> 00:46:20,239
It's a shame
there aren't any ballet studios around.

794
00:46:20,322 --> 00:46:21,865
- I don't like ballet.
- Why not?

795
00:46:21,949 --> 00:46:23,742
You got a new leotard and shoes.

796
00:46:24,034 --> 00:46:26,119
I'll sign her up
for an after-class program.

797
00:46:26,203 --> 00:46:28,747
You're busy, so don't worry about it.

798
00:46:30,541 --> 00:46:33,001
Do-yeon, let's brush your teeth
if you're done with that.

799
00:46:33,210 --> 00:46:36,713
<i>Brush up, down, left, and right</i>

800
00:46:37,506 --> 00:46:38,590
Let's go.

801
00:46:40,259 --> 00:46:41,343
Come on.

802
00:46:41,844 --> 00:46:44,596
- Off we go.
- Off we go.

803
00:46:45,931 --> 00:46:48,517
Honey! Garbage!

804
00:46:49,977 --> 00:46:52,646
Did you just call me garbage?

805
00:46:58,944 --> 00:47:00,404
I'll put Do-yeon to bed first.

806
00:47:01,572 --> 00:47:05,993
"There were colorful, sweet lollipops
hidden in the reeds.

807
00:47:06,076 --> 00:47:08,203
'But I promised not to eat candy.'

808
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:10,622
'I promised my siblings.'"

809
00:47:24,595 --> 00:47:26,054
- Dad.
- Yes?

810
00:47:30,184 --> 00:47:31,977
I want to learn martial arts.

811
00:47:35,230 --> 00:47:37,774
I'll sign you up for it.

812
00:47:39,067 --> 00:47:41,737
Promise to protect me, okay?

813
00:47:54,666 --> 00:47:59,213
He didn't recycle anything
and just tossed a black bag out.

814
00:47:59,296 --> 00:48:00,881
Look at this.

815
00:48:00,964 --> 00:48:02,841
And that smell.

816
00:48:02,925 --> 00:48:07,346
How dare he piss off
our youth association president?

817
00:48:07,429 --> 00:48:10,974
I'm going to find who it is
and make sure he pays a hefty fine.

818
00:48:12,184 --> 00:48:15,145
You can usually tell who it is
just by the knot on the bags.

819
00:48:15,229 --> 00:48:16,522
Can't you tell this time?

820
00:48:20,609 --> 00:48:21,443
Hear me out.

821
00:48:22,861 --> 00:48:26,198
Our neighbors collectively agreed
not to use black bags for recycling.

822
00:48:26,281 --> 00:48:27,282
Right.

823
00:48:27,449 --> 00:48:30,035
- But this guy used a black bag.
- Yes?

824
00:48:31,662 --> 00:48:34,790
I'm sure I'll find a clue
if I continue patrolling.

825
00:48:34,873 --> 00:48:37,417
I'll make sure I find who it is.

826
00:48:37,501 --> 00:48:41,421
Whoever it is, the poor guy will die
in our Byeong-nam's hands.

827
00:48:41,505 --> 00:48:42,840
Go easy, okay?

828
00:49:03,652 --> 00:49:07,489
NO LITTERING
UNDER SURVEILLANCE 24 HOURS A DAY

829
00:49:07,573 --> 00:49:09,116
Plastic.

830
00:49:11,451 --> 00:49:14,246
Cans.

831
00:49:23,964 --> 00:49:25,174
What are you doing there?

832
00:49:30,179 --> 00:49:31,346
Ma'am?

833
00:49:34,850 --> 00:49:37,269
A bunny died.

834
00:49:38,812 --> 00:49:40,522
Your pet bunny died?

835
00:49:50,991 --> 00:49:52,534
This bunny?

836
00:49:52,826 --> 00:49:53,660
Hey, stop!

837
00:49:54,203 --> 00:49:55,287
My gosh!

838
00:49:55,370 --> 00:49:58,081
Of course you're scared.
Because I caught you red-handed.

839
00:49:58,165 --> 00:49:59,416
Excuse me, ma'am.

840
00:50:00,083 --> 00:50:01,001
My, my!

841
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:03,170
Another stuffed bunny?

842
00:50:07,466 --> 00:50:08,842
Unit 307.

843
00:50:08,926 --> 00:50:11,512
- Hello, sir!
- Hello.

844
00:50:11,595 --> 00:50:13,096
Look at this.

845
00:50:13,597 --> 00:50:14,723
Honey.

846
00:50:15,474 --> 00:50:18,185
Why are you here? You should be in bed.

847
00:50:18,268 --> 00:50:20,854
Was it you, ma'am?
What are you doing here?

848
00:50:21,772 --> 00:50:25,025
Killed the poor bunny...

849
00:50:25,108 --> 00:50:26,151
Who?

850
00:50:27,361 --> 00:50:29,655
- This guy?
- No.

851
00:50:29,738 --> 00:50:33,492
She was looking into this bag,
so I asked what she was doing,

852
00:50:33,575 --> 00:50:35,869
and she said the bunny was dead. Right?

853
00:50:38,914 --> 00:50:39,873
Who are you?

854
00:50:42,459 --> 00:50:44,586
Are you the new neighbor
in the next building?

855
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:48,131
What are you doing here?

856
00:50:49,007 --> 00:50:51,134
You said you were going on a patrol.

857
00:50:52,553 --> 00:50:54,805
Yes, I'm back now.

858
00:50:55,389 --> 00:50:57,099
Did you come to get me?

859
00:50:57,391 --> 00:50:59,768
- Let's head in.
- Okay.

860
00:50:59,852 --> 00:51:01,436
- Bye, then.
- We'll head in.

861
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:04,982
- Goodnight.
- I told you to stay in.

862
00:51:05,858 --> 00:51:07,234
Let's head in.

863
00:51:08,819 --> 00:51:11,321
Her symptoms are pretty serious.

864
00:51:14,825 --> 00:51:16,326
Is she unwell?

865
00:51:20,789 --> 00:51:22,207
No, my point is,

866
00:51:22,958 --> 00:51:26,003
she's not the type
to play with a stuffed bunny,

867
00:51:26,086 --> 00:51:29,214
and she's also not the type
to toss trash just anywhere.

868
00:51:30,215 --> 00:51:32,217
Yes, even I could tell that.

869
00:51:34,511 --> 00:51:37,014
Are you suspecting me right now?

870
00:51:37,681 --> 00:51:39,433
If it's not you, who would it be?

871
00:51:40,017 --> 00:51:42,936
Are you kidding me? Do you know who I am?

872
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:44,563
Do I need to know that
to get recycling done?

873
00:51:44,646 --> 00:51:47,107
Do I seem like the type to cut open
a stuffed animal's belly?

874
00:51:47,191 --> 00:51:48,192
How did you know about the belly?

875
00:51:48,483 --> 00:51:50,652
Because I just saw it!

876
00:51:50,736 --> 00:51:52,487
- This is...
- Okay.

877
00:51:52,571 --> 00:51:53,655
Look at it again.

878
00:52:01,330 --> 00:52:03,040
What is it? What's wrong?

879
00:52:05,042 --> 00:52:08,212
I think there's cat hair inside.
I'm allergic.

880
00:52:10,422 --> 00:52:11,840
There's no cat hair.

881
00:52:12,883 --> 00:52:14,259
You're allergic?

882
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:16,970
That's too bad.

883
00:52:17,054 --> 00:52:18,680
Oh, no.

884
00:52:19,932 --> 00:52:22,392
You'd better recycle properly from now on.

885
00:52:22,476 --> 00:52:25,229
I'm watching you, okay?

886
00:52:26,230 --> 00:52:27,439
Seriously.

887
00:52:34,530 --> 00:52:36,281
Why do you keep following me?

888
00:52:36,365 --> 00:52:37,950
Who? Me?

889
00:52:38,033 --> 00:52:39,868
I'm just going home this way.

890
00:52:39,952 --> 00:52:42,579
Why are you walking this way
when you live there?

891
00:52:43,288 --> 00:52:44,414
Out of guilt?

892
00:52:44,498 --> 00:52:46,124
Guilt for what?

893
00:52:46,208 --> 00:52:48,293
I'm just going to the convenience store
to get cigarettes.

894
00:52:48,377 --> 00:52:51,797
Remember, cigarettes go in regular waste.

895
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:54,258
It's a 50,000-won fine
if you discard it on the streets.

896
00:52:54,341 --> 00:52:56,134
In some cases, they even arrest you.

897
00:52:56,218 --> 00:52:58,929
Why are you following me around
and nagging me? What did I do?

898
00:53:00,013 --> 00:53:01,765
You know,

899
00:53:02,182 --> 00:53:04,560
it's just that I found two black bags
of tattered stuffed bunnies,

900
00:53:04,643 --> 00:53:07,771
once in the morning, and once at night.

901
00:53:07,855 --> 00:53:10,023
And you just happened
to move in yesterday.

902
00:53:10,482 --> 00:53:12,568
And both were spotted
at the dumpster near your building.

903
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:16,238
Even more, you had the second bag
in your own hands.

904
00:53:16,321 --> 00:53:18,198
And you have a kid
who has stuffed animals.

905
00:53:18,574 --> 00:53:20,242
Isn't that suspicious?

906
00:53:20,868 --> 00:53:24,454
If it isn't, what in the world is?

907
00:53:24,788 --> 00:53:25,956
Goodness.

908
00:53:27,165 --> 00:53:29,960
You're crazy. You're out of your mind.

909
00:53:31,128 --> 00:53:33,797
If you want to suspect someone,
bring evidence.

910
00:53:33,881 --> 00:53:35,340
But you wouldn't be able to get any.

911
00:53:35,424 --> 00:53:37,301
Why? Because I didn't do it.

912
00:53:39,678 --> 00:53:42,181
Why am I even explaining this to you?

913
00:53:44,099 --> 00:53:45,475
Maybe you're guilty.

914
00:53:59,740 --> 00:54:02,367
What? My gosh, what are you doing?

915
00:54:02,868 --> 00:54:04,870
- It's him.
- Who?

916
00:54:04,953 --> 00:54:06,788
The man who just left the store.

917
00:54:06,872 --> 00:54:08,373
He was at the dumpster earlier.

918
00:54:08,457 --> 00:54:10,250
- Let's go and ask him.
- Ask him what?

919
00:54:10,334 --> 00:54:13,420
He would've seen me get there later!

920
00:54:15,005 --> 00:54:16,882
Hey, wait.

921
00:54:17,216 --> 00:54:18,342
- Hey!
- Run!

922
00:54:23,597 --> 00:54:25,974
Excuse me, can I talk to you?

923
00:54:27,851 --> 00:54:29,019
I need to ask you something.

924
00:54:32,022 --> 00:54:32,981
What?

925
00:54:34,316 --> 00:54:36,735
What is it? What?

926
00:54:37,402 --> 00:54:39,905
Hey! I'm not dangerous or anything!

927
00:54:41,281 --> 00:54:42,199
Sir.

928
00:54:43,575 --> 00:54:44,701
You're kidding.

929
00:54:45,285 --> 00:54:46,578
Hey, wait!

930
00:54:47,663 --> 00:54:48,789
Be careful!

931
00:54:56,213 --> 00:54:57,589
What did he just do?

932
00:54:58,465 --> 00:54:59,299
Darn it.

933
00:55:09,893 --> 00:55:12,396
How can he run so well in sliders?

934
00:55:12,479 --> 00:55:14,189
It's way too late for this nonsense.

935
00:55:28,328 --> 00:55:29,413
Excuse me!

936
00:55:29,496 --> 00:55:31,373
Stop right there!

937
00:55:33,542 --> 00:55:35,836
- Sir!
- Why is he so damn fast?

938
00:55:37,254 --> 00:55:38,172
Hey!

939
00:55:41,383 --> 00:55:42,384
Excuse me!

940
00:55:43,302 --> 00:55:44,303
Darn it!

941
00:55:44,803 --> 00:55:46,388
It's uphill from there.

942
00:55:50,058 --> 00:55:50,893
Excuse me!

943
00:55:52,269 --> 00:55:53,103
Hey!

944
00:56:00,527 --> 00:56:01,987
Oh, my. Sir!

945
00:56:02,070 --> 00:56:04,031
- Out of my way!
- Sir!

946
00:56:10,829 --> 00:56:14,625
I just want to ask you something! Stop it!

947
00:56:24,051 --> 00:56:25,427
Darn it!

948
00:56:29,056 --> 00:56:29,932
Hey!

949
00:56:30,849 --> 00:56:31,808
Sir!

950
00:56:33,352 --> 00:56:34,353
Excuse me!

951
00:56:35,437 --> 00:56:36,313
Excuse me!

952
00:56:38,857 --> 00:56:39,733
Sir!

953
00:56:56,667 --> 00:56:57,668
Where did he go?

954
00:56:58,502 --> 00:57:00,587
Where is he?

955
00:57:02,881 --> 00:57:03,924
Sir!

956
00:57:04,424 --> 00:57:05,968
Are you kidding me right now?

957
00:57:06,051 --> 00:57:06,969
Excuse me!

958
00:57:08,512 --> 00:57:10,138
My gosh!

959
00:57:11,723 --> 00:57:13,308
There's nowhere else for you to go.

960
00:57:13,559 --> 00:57:14,726
This is the rooftop.

961
00:57:39,918 --> 00:57:41,837
I just wanted to ask you something!

962
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:43,755
Why do you keep running away?

963
00:57:43,839 --> 00:57:45,632
My gosh, my sliders are all ruined.

964
00:57:52,764 --> 00:57:53,932
MK2?

965
00:57:59,146 --> 00:58:01,064
Who are you? That's dangerous.

966
00:58:10,532 --> 00:58:11,533
Are you a foreigner?

967
00:58:50,030 --> 00:58:51,490
My goodness!

968
00:58:53,659 --> 00:58:56,245
Man! My heart is about to burst.

969
00:58:56,870 --> 00:58:57,996
Where did he go?

970
00:58:58,247 --> 00:59:00,249
- That way.
- That way?

971
00:59:01,458 --> 00:59:03,794
You said you had something to ask him.
Did you ask him?

972
00:59:07,297 --> 00:59:08,173
Did you get into a fight?

973
00:59:10,259 --> 00:59:11,426
Oh, yes.

974
00:59:11,885 --> 00:59:13,971
He went that way,
but I don't see him anymore.

975
00:59:14,930 --> 00:59:16,348
I'd better go home.

976
00:59:17,933 --> 00:59:18,934
That's the main road.

977
00:59:20,811 --> 00:59:21,937
What?

978
00:59:22,020 --> 00:59:23,522
It's a long detour.

979
00:59:23,605 --> 00:59:25,524
This way is faster.

980
00:59:25,858 --> 00:59:28,110
You can't lead the way
when you know nothing.

981
00:59:29,194 --> 00:59:31,071
Why didn't you come sooner
if you knew your way so well?

982
00:59:31,154 --> 00:59:33,323
You came after everything,
and here you are, boasting.

983
00:59:33,574 --> 00:59:35,951
I ran as fast as I could, too.

984
00:59:37,828 --> 00:59:40,330
Follow me or go the long way.

985
00:59:41,790 --> 00:59:43,000
My knees are killing me.

986
00:59:50,174 --> 00:59:51,091
Wait for me.

987
01:00:34,593 --> 01:00:38,597
Did you hear a gunshot? With a muffler.

988
01:00:39,139 --> 01:00:40,224
A gunshot?

989
01:00:40,599 --> 01:00:44,228
Why are you so startled?
We see guns all the time in the army.

990
01:00:44,937 --> 01:00:46,230
I was exempt from service.

991
01:00:47,314 --> 01:00:48,649
No wonder.

992
01:00:49,566 --> 01:00:50,734
You're so out of it.

993
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:54,446
Out of what? I was much faster than you.

994
01:00:54,530 --> 01:00:56,949
Why were you exempt from service
if you were so fast, then?

995
01:00:57,407 --> 01:01:00,744
You couldn't even catch that tiny guy,
and you're a mess.

996
01:01:00,994 --> 01:01:02,746
You could've just gone in, and...

997
01:01:05,082 --> 01:01:06,792
This was all you needed to do.

998
01:01:07,209 --> 01:01:09,628
You don't know how to do this
because you didn't serve in the army.

999
01:01:10,045 --> 01:01:12,756
What are you, five years old?

1000
01:01:12,881 --> 01:01:16,051
Why are you being so rude?

1001
01:01:16,677 --> 01:01:20,180
I just can't talk to men
who haven't served.

1002
01:01:34,194 --> 01:01:37,573
JOWOONG BANK

1003
01:01:41,535 --> 01:01:42,411
What is he doing?

1004
01:01:44,872 --> 01:01:46,206
What is it now?

1005
01:01:51,461 --> 01:01:53,255
ENTER YOUR PASSCODE

1006
01:01:53,338 --> 01:01:54,339
CHOOSE YOUR TRANSACTION

1007
01:01:54,423 --> 01:01:56,800
AMOUNT: 101,571,879 WON

1008
01:02:06,185 --> 01:02:08,228
- What are you looking at?
- My gosh!

1009
01:02:08,312 --> 01:02:10,397
Why are you zoning out here alone?

1010
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:12,941
Aren't you going to go home?
Don't follow me, and go home.

1011
01:02:13,025 --> 01:02:14,026
Just go.

1012
01:02:14,109 --> 01:02:17,029
Why do you care about where I go?

1013
01:02:17,196 --> 01:02:19,573
You keep getting more and more suspicious.

1014
01:02:20,824 --> 01:02:21,658
What now?

1015
01:02:23,410 --> 01:02:25,871
Hey, it's him.

1016
01:02:25,954 --> 01:02:28,332
- It's him, isn't he?
- No.

1017
01:02:28,415 --> 01:02:31,043
I'll go in alone and talk to him.
Good work tonight.

1018
01:02:31,126 --> 01:02:32,753
- You can go.
- What? We can go together.

1019
01:02:32,836 --> 01:02:35,547
No, I told you to go! Just leave!

1020
01:02:38,383 --> 01:02:40,677
You think you can tell me what to do?

1021
01:02:41,261 --> 01:02:43,138
I'm the youth association president
in this neighborhood.

1022
01:02:43,889 --> 01:02:45,933
Hey! What a ridiculous guy.

1023
01:02:46,016 --> 01:02:47,184
Just go!

1024
01:02:47,267 --> 01:02:48,769
ENTER THE RECIPIENT ACCOUNT NUMBER

1025
01:02:48,852 --> 01:02:49,937
I told you to leave!

1026
01:02:50,020 --> 01:02:51,271
You said we should go ask him!

1027
01:02:56,818 --> 01:02:58,070
I told you to leave!

1028
01:02:58,153 --> 01:02:59,613
Let's go together!

1029
01:03:15,754 --> 01:03:16,630
Watch out!

1030
01:03:56,336 --> 01:04:02,342
SECOND EXPLOSION
ON AUG 17, 2025 AT 12:30 A.M.

1031
01:04:11,143 --> 01:04:14,313
What exploded, Officer Park?

1032
01:04:14,897 --> 01:04:16,356
Please just go to bed.

1033
01:04:16,815 --> 01:04:20,485
I was just crossing the street
when it exploded

1034
01:04:20,569 --> 01:04:22,029
and threw me to the ground.

1035
01:04:22,446 --> 01:04:24,698
I was too shocked to notice anything.

1036
01:04:25,324 --> 01:04:27,534
Yes, you can ask that guy.

1037
01:04:29,870 --> 01:04:30,954
Let me sanitize your wound.

1038
01:04:33,207 --> 01:04:34,750
I haven't done anything.

1039
01:04:35,459 --> 01:04:36,919
It hurts so much.

1040
01:04:37,002 --> 01:04:39,046
Just the smell of it makes it sting.

1041
01:04:42,090 --> 01:04:44,843
- I'd like to ask you some questions.
- Sure.

1042
01:04:44,927 --> 01:04:47,679
Do you remember anything
about the man inside?

1043
01:04:49,890 --> 01:04:52,893
He was a foreigner.
Maybe Southeast Asian...

1044
01:04:53,727 --> 01:04:56,730
No, South American? Or Russian?

1045
01:04:56,813 --> 01:04:59,274
I'm not sure about his exact ethnicity.

1046
01:04:59,358 --> 01:05:02,861
I needed to ask him something,
so I tried to talk to him.

1047
01:05:02,945 --> 01:05:06,240
But he kept glancing at me
before running away.

1048
01:05:06,323 --> 01:05:09,576
I wondered why he was running,
so I ran after him.

1049
01:05:09,660 --> 01:05:13,455
But the man suddenly started
waving a knife at me!

1050
01:05:13,539 --> 01:05:15,541
- A knife?
- Yes!

1051
01:05:15,624 --> 01:05:17,584
It was a knife at first,
but then, he whipped out a gun...

1052
01:05:18,252 --> 01:05:19,169
A gun?

1053
01:05:24,216 --> 01:05:28,846
I mean, he whipped out his big guns
and started pounding on me.

1054
01:05:29,721 --> 01:05:31,181
Then he ran away.

1055
01:05:31,890 --> 01:05:36,019
Did you see what he was doing
in the ATM booth?

1056
