HEROES NEXT DOOR

2
00:00:42,118 --> 00:00:43,161
THIS DRAMA IS A WORK OF FICTION.
ALL CHARACTERS, PROFESSIONS, PLACES,

3
00:00:43,244 --> 00:00:44,120
COMPANIES, ORGANIZATIONS,
ETHNIC GROUPS AND EVENTS ARE NOT REAL.

4
00:00:44,204 --> 00:00:45,080
ALL CHILD AND ANIMAL SCENES WERE FILMED
SAFELY UNDER EXPERT SUPERVISION.

5
00:00:47,624 --> 00:00:50,251
SEONBONG TRADING CO., LTD.

6
00:00:50,335 --> 00:00:51,878
SEONBONG TRADING

7
00:00:51,962 --> 00:00:55,632
Didn't I tell you to get rid of them all?

8
00:00:55,715 --> 00:00:58,218
You plan to keep up with this shit job?

9
00:00:58,301 --> 00:01:02,138
You little shit.

10
00:01:02,931 --> 00:01:05,183
What should I do with you?

11
00:01:05,266 --> 00:01:07,227
You absolute moron.

12
00:01:07,602 --> 00:01:08,895
Stand straight.

13
00:01:08,979 --> 00:01:11,064
Apologies, sir. I'll take care of it.

14
00:01:11,147 --> 00:01:13,358
Take care of what? Huh?

15
00:01:14,567 --> 00:01:16,945
You couldn't even keep the guy
you kidnapped.

16
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:25,161
Hey.

17
00:01:27,205 --> 00:01:29,457
They seem to be connected to Kim In-seop.

18
00:01:30,166 --> 00:01:31,710
Get your guys to look into them.

19
00:01:34,004 --> 00:01:38,174
You think I'm doing this
just for myself, you morons?

20
00:01:38,258 --> 00:01:40,844
I'm the only one looking after you
after your discharge.

21
00:01:41,845 --> 00:01:43,596
You idiots.

22
00:01:46,266 --> 00:01:48,310
You're not listening, are you?

23
00:01:48,393 --> 00:01:49,311
Sir.

24
00:01:49,811 --> 00:01:52,439
This is the guy who took Kim In-seop.

25
00:02:05,368 --> 00:02:09,706
HEROES NEXT DOOR PART 1

26
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:13,585
They're my neighbors
who helped me get Producer Kim back.

27
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:16,671
She's the head of the Women's Association
in Changri-dong.

28
00:02:17,422 --> 00:02:18,882
This is the youth association president.

29
00:02:19,341 --> 00:02:20,759
Yes, I'm the youth association president--

30
00:02:20,842 --> 00:02:22,677
Now's not the time for introductions.

31
00:02:27,223 --> 00:02:28,600
- Mr. Choi.
- Yes?

32
00:02:28,808 --> 00:02:30,018
What is this place?

33
00:02:30,435 --> 00:02:31,811
It's my first time here too, so...

34
00:02:32,187 --> 00:02:34,105
I'm Lee Geun-cheol,
the Vice Minister of National Defense.

35
00:02:35,023 --> 00:02:36,358
And this is Major Lee Su-jin.

36
00:02:39,361 --> 00:02:43,365
So this is a safe house?

37
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,742
We thought it'd be best
for Mr. Kim to stay here

38
00:02:45,825 --> 00:02:49,496
since he's involved
in a Ministry of National Defense case.

39
00:02:49,579 --> 00:02:53,875
No wonder the gas prices
were way too high at this station.

40
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,628
So that was on purpose.

41
00:02:56,711 --> 00:02:59,589
To keep others from coming here. Right?

42
00:03:00,173 --> 00:03:02,801
Mr. Lee, does every neighborhood
have one of these?

43
00:03:03,593 --> 00:03:05,387
That's confidential. Let's sit.

44
00:03:05,887 --> 00:03:06,763
Okay.

45
00:03:06,846 --> 00:03:08,515
- Oh, gosh.
- This is so cool.

46
00:03:08,974 --> 00:03:10,266
What are you doing?

47
00:03:18,191 --> 00:03:22,028
So the bombs that the military snuck away
went off in our neighborhood?

48
00:03:24,906 --> 00:03:25,740
Yes.

49
00:03:27,117 --> 00:03:30,328
So that's why soldiers were there
to clean up the site.

50
00:03:30,412 --> 00:03:31,663
To get rid of the evidence.

51
00:03:31,746 --> 00:03:34,291
Is it even possible for the military
to sneak away bombs?

52
00:03:34,374 --> 00:03:36,543
Even a missing shell casing
is a huge deal.

53
00:03:36,626 --> 00:03:39,879
It could be possible
precisely because it's the military.

54
00:03:40,297 --> 00:03:41,798
Who snuck away the bombs?

55
00:03:42,007 --> 00:03:43,550
We're looking into that right now.

56
00:03:43,633 --> 00:03:45,719
Seeing as you've brought Producer Kim
all the way here,

57
00:03:46,553 --> 00:03:48,179
I guess some big names are involved.

58
00:03:48,763 --> 00:03:50,348
Big names?

59
00:03:50,807 --> 00:03:53,560
Maybe the President
or the Minister of National Defense?

60
00:03:53,643 --> 00:03:55,437
That's nonsense.

61
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,522
That's how it always is in movies.

62
00:03:57,605 --> 00:04:00,400
Why would the President or the Minister
come here, of all places?

63
00:04:00,483 --> 00:04:01,860
What if I'm right?

64
00:04:01,943 --> 00:04:05,655
If you are, you can take your favorite toy
from my stationery store.

65
00:04:05,989 --> 00:04:07,240
Are you here to chit-chat?

66
00:04:07,866 --> 00:04:10,702
- No, I just--
- "Toys," are you serious?

67
00:04:10,785 --> 00:04:12,579
I got scolded because of you.

68
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:18,084
This is pretty cool.

69
00:04:21,087 --> 00:04:22,839
By the way, Mr. Choi.

70
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:24,299
Yes?

71
00:04:24,382 --> 00:04:26,635
How do you know
the Vice Minister of National Defense?

72
00:04:27,093 --> 00:04:29,095
Maybe he's a secret agent or something.

73
00:04:32,474 --> 00:04:34,184
Oh, well...

74
00:04:37,228 --> 00:04:38,313
Hold on.

75
00:04:39,314 --> 00:04:40,482
It's General Hwang!

76
00:04:40,565 --> 00:04:41,733
Who's General Hwang?

77
00:04:41,816 --> 00:04:43,568
- It's his wife.
- Yeah.

78
00:04:43,652 --> 00:04:44,986
I'd better get going right now,

79
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:47,238
so let's talk about the details
tomorrow at the bunker.

80
00:04:47,322 --> 00:04:49,115
- Okay, goodnight.
- Bye.

81
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,450
- Bye.
- Goodnight.

82
00:04:50,533 --> 00:04:51,868
Hey, I'm on my way.

83
00:04:52,577 --> 00:04:54,663
I'm right in front of the house. Okay.

84
00:04:54,996 --> 00:04:56,414
Goodnight!

85
00:05:01,211 --> 00:05:04,047
We'd better head home too.

86
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:05,840
Tell me everything you know.

87
00:05:06,049 --> 00:05:07,884
Do you know about the JDD?

88
00:05:07,968 --> 00:05:09,010
What?

89
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:11,137
Just spill it.

90
00:05:13,056 --> 00:05:15,517
This is supposed to be a secret, but...

91
00:05:30,407 --> 00:05:32,909
You've been acting weird
since moving here.

92
00:05:34,327 --> 00:05:36,329
Me? No way.

93
00:05:36,579 --> 00:05:39,207
You used to come straight home after work
before moving here.

94
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:42,460
Since when did you start
doing a lap around town every evening?

95
00:05:42,711 --> 00:05:44,963
The youth association president--

96
00:05:45,046 --> 00:05:46,631
Come up with a new excuse, at least.

97
00:05:46,923 --> 00:05:48,341
It's always the same story.

98
00:05:48,591 --> 00:05:50,010
Try a little harder.

99
00:05:52,512 --> 00:05:53,346
Wash up and go to bed.

100
00:05:54,556 --> 00:05:55,432
Yes, ma'am.

101
00:06:08,987 --> 00:06:10,113
Hey!

102
00:06:12,615 --> 00:06:14,909
Were you scolded by your wife?

103
00:06:15,285 --> 00:06:17,120
It was fine.

104
00:06:18,288 --> 00:06:19,122
Really?

105
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:22,792
You know that button camera
you gave me yesterday?

106
00:06:23,376 --> 00:06:25,253
My legendary masterpiece that you lost?

107
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,921
I didn't lose it.

108
00:06:27,005 --> 00:06:28,632
I planted it on one of the kidnappers.

109
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:37,724
Can you track its last location?

110
00:06:38,475 --> 00:06:41,645
It might've captured some important clues

111
00:06:41,728 --> 00:06:43,355
that point to who's behind it, you know?

112
00:06:45,398 --> 00:06:46,691
Man...

113
00:06:46,775 --> 00:06:48,109
It was turned off last night.

114
00:06:49,069 --> 00:06:50,111
Did it run out of battery?

115
00:06:50,195 --> 00:06:51,571
No, it's supposed to last a month.

116
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,742
But I can see where it turned off.

117
00:06:56,201 --> 00:06:57,327
Yeah? Where is it?

118
00:06:58,328 --> 00:07:00,538
Why? Are you going alone again?

119
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:01,790
Of course I am.

120
00:07:05,585 --> 00:07:06,836
Only I know the location.

121
00:07:08,964 --> 00:07:10,423
- Give it to me.
- Hey, stop it.

122
00:07:10,507 --> 00:07:11,549
- Cut it out.
- You can't come!

123
00:07:11,633 --> 00:07:13,843
- Just give it to me!
- Let me go with you, then.

124
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:18,723
What are you guys doing
so early in the morning?

125
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,309
Oh, nothing.

126
00:07:22,352 --> 00:07:24,646
I'm just teaching Byeong-nam how to sweep.

127
00:07:24,729 --> 00:07:26,231
He was doing such a terrible job.

128
00:07:29,275 --> 00:07:30,360
See you at lunch.

129
00:07:30,443 --> 00:07:31,444
Fine by me.

130
00:07:33,905 --> 00:07:35,532
I have to go to work now. Bye.

131
00:07:35,615 --> 00:07:36,700
All right.

132
00:07:37,409 --> 00:07:39,160
Why are you meeting at lunch?

133
00:07:39,244 --> 00:07:40,537
What are you doing without me?

134
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:41,621
Let me join you too.

135
00:07:41,705 --> 00:07:44,416
Join us on what? It's nothing.

136
00:07:44,499 --> 00:07:47,377
Even last night, you guys left me out...

137
00:07:48,503 --> 00:07:50,672
Hey, Nam-yeon.

138
00:07:52,007 --> 00:07:53,717
Hey! Where do you think you're going?

139
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,135
No, not you.

140
00:07:55,218 --> 00:07:56,678
I'm on my way now.

141
00:07:56,761 --> 00:07:59,055
I'll be right over, honey.

142
00:08:01,266 --> 00:08:02,100
Okay.

143
00:08:07,522 --> 00:08:09,607
Sorry, I'm late.

144
00:08:10,108 --> 00:08:11,151
So what's up?

145
00:08:11,234 --> 00:08:12,694
SAFE GAS STATION

146
00:08:12,777 --> 00:08:16,031
Another order from Safe Gas Station?

147
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:20,076
The same gas station
where you went with my buddies last night.

148
00:08:23,496 --> 00:08:25,415
Are you really not going to tell me?

149
00:08:26,249 --> 00:08:27,167
About what?

150
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:31,129
Why were you at the gas station
with Yong-hui, Byeong-nam, and the tutor?

151
00:08:33,423 --> 00:08:34,758
Stop asking.

152
00:08:34,841 --> 00:08:36,092
If you ask one more time...

153
00:08:38,386 --> 00:08:39,429
Delivery!

154
00:08:39,512 --> 00:08:41,222
Okay, thank you.

155
00:08:42,349 --> 00:08:43,933
Those must be the Changri Market flyers.

156
00:08:44,017 --> 00:08:45,435
Hand them out on your deliveries.

157
00:08:46,603 --> 00:08:47,979
Can't a man ask a question?

158
00:08:55,111 --> 00:08:58,365
They usually hire people from other fields
as insurance fraud investigators.

159
00:08:59,157 --> 00:09:03,203
Like detectives, lawyers, or nurses.
People who can easily spot fraud.

160
00:09:03,453 --> 00:09:05,163
But this guy, Choi Kang,

161
00:09:05,789 --> 00:09:08,166
quit college halfway,
was exempt from conscription,

162
00:09:08,249 --> 00:09:11,836
and was jobless before getting hired
without even a proper major?

163
00:09:13,338 --> 00:09:14,422
Do you see what I mean?

164
00:09:17,968 --> 00:09:21,596
And Veotigo Insurance,
where Choi Kang works,

165
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,390
is funded by the government.

166
00:09:24,307 --> 00:09:26,518
Like a government grant
for private companies?

167
00:09:26,601 --> 00:09:27,560
No.

168
00:09:27,644 --> 00:09:30,397
It's a defense R&D grant
from the Ministry of National Defense,

169
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,731
issued by Foreign Affairs.

170
00:09:31,815 --> 00:09:36,027
Why would Foreign Affairs
fund a grant from National Defense?

171
00:09:36,111 --> 00:09:40,073
It's not unheard of,
but it's not common, either.

172
00:09:40,156 --> 00:09:41,157
Since when?

173
00:09:41,741 --> 00:09:44,744
Since he started working here?

174
00:09:44,828 --> 00:09:45,829
Yes.

175
00:09:46,413 --> 00:09:49,249
And on top of that,
the grant doesn't have an end date.

176
00:09:49,332 --> 00:09:51,209
Hold on.

177
00:09:52,877 --> 00:09:55,380
A while ago,

178
00:09:56,006 --> 00:10:00,302
I heard about a military unit
that Foreign Affairs only station abroad.

179
00:10:00,593 --> 00:10:03,805
So he wasn't part of
the Ministry of National Defense?

180
00:10:03,888 --> 00:10:06,141
Hey, make sure to look into this.

181
00:10:06,558 --> 00:10:07,434
Yes, sir.

182
00:10:12,022 --> 00:10:13,773
Any updates on the bombs in Kiyun-si?

183
00:10:14,774 --> 00:10:17,694
It took real effort to smuggle them out,
so why are they back in Korea?

184
00:10:17,777 --> 00:10:21,031
Someone paid double the price abroad
to purchase the bombs,

185
00:10:21,114 --> 00:10:23,992
but the brokers lost contact,
so they want us to wait.

186
00:10:24,075 --> 00:10:25,910
Well, we can't wait forever.

187
00:10:26,244 --> 00:10:27,329
Another thing.

188
00:10:27,662 --> 00:10:28,872
I've been hearing rumors

189
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,626
that the Vice Minister
is looking into the bombs.

190
00:10:33,168 --> 00:10:34,461
The Vice Minister?

191
00:10:34,753 --> 00:10:35,712
Yes.

192
00:10:46,598 --> 00:10:47,682
Hello.

193
00:10:52,562 --> 00:10:53,813
So you've been busy lately.

194
00:10:54,272 --> 00:10:55,190
Sorry?

195
00:10:58,151 --> 00:11:01,363
I hear you've been nosing around
here and there.

196
00:11:08,954 --> 00:11:11,122
Actually, I had something
to report to you.

197
00:11:12,749 --> 00:11:15,126
Report? About what?

198
00:11:20,674 --> 00:11:22,759
The bombs that were
part of our military supplies

199
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:25,136
went off in a civilian area.

200
00:11:27,013 --> 00:11:29,224
It looks like there's corruption
in our ministry.

201
00:11:30,725 --> 00:11:32,727
Is that so?

202
00:11:35,355 --> 00:11:39,818
Would you have anything
to say about this, sir?

203
00:11:43,321 --> 00:11:44,322
Huh?

204
00:11:56,334 --> 00:11:57,502
NA EUN-JAE

205
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,718
You snuck away arms and used the money
to invest in Changri-dong,

206
00:12:04,843 --> 00:12:08,305
and those weapons have returned
and are giving you a nightmare.

207
00:12:08,388 --> 00:12:10,098
That's not what's important.

208
00:12:11,891 --> 00:12:14,227
The Vice Minister seems to know something.

209
00:12:21,109 --> 00:12:24,988
Remember how confident you were
when you screamed at me?

210
00:12:25,238 --> 00:12:27,490
That you'd take care of everything?

211
00:12:27,574 --> 00:12:29,451
Who said I wouldn't?

212
00:12:30,744 --> 00:12:32,704
You know everything now, anyway.

213
00:12:32,787 --> 00:12:36,458
I'm just saying
we should help each other when in need.

214
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:37,375
"Each other"?

215
00:12:38,293 --> 00:12:39,753
Come on.

216
00:12:39,836 --> 00:12:41,838
Why do you have to be so uptight?

217
00:12:42,672 --> 00:12:43,798
If this goes wrong,

218
00:12:44,382 --> 00:12:46,468
it's over for all of us.

219
00:12:47,719 --> 00:12:48,928
You know this.

220
00:12:59,356 --> 00:13:01,024
NATIONAL ASSEMBLY SPEAKER, KWON SANG-TAE

221
00:13:04,778 --> 00:13:06,154
Hi, Mr. Kwon.

222
00:13:06,237 --> 00:13:07,489
It's me, Eun-jae.

223
00:13:09,741 --> 00:13:11,117
Why don't we catch up over dinner?

224
00:13:17,207 --> 00:13:19,584
Go straight this way.

225
00:13:19,668 --> 00:13:20,502
Okay.

226
00:13:24,381 --> 00:13:26,549
About your no-comment stuff.

227
00:13:27,717 --> 00:13:30,679
I told Nam-yeon everything.

228
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,847
Oh, come on.

229
00:13:33,723 --> 00:13:36,142
You can't keep a secret, can you?

230
00:13:36,226 --> 00:13:37,978
She was ready to kill me.

231
00:13:38,061 --> 00:13:40,021
And she saw everything,
so I had no choice.

232
00:13:47,696 --> 00:13:51,157
Anyway, I have a question.

233
00:13:51,241 --> 00:13:52,409
That'll be 500 won.

234
00:13:52,784 --> 00:13:53,618
Why, you...

235
00:13:54,661 --> 00:13:56,663
- Give me a discount.
- Fine, 300 won.

236
00:13:59,249 --> 00:14:02,419
Why did you join JDD?

237
00:14:02,502 --> 00:14:03,670
To make money.

238
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:11,052
- That's all?
- That'll be extra 200 won.

239
00:14:11,136 --> 00:14:12,304
Hey!

240
00:14:12,971 --> 00:14:15,265
You're kidding me. Forget it.

241
00:14:16,182 --> 00:14:17,600
Seriously!

242
00:14:22,439 --> 00:14:28,278
SEOON INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX

243
00:14:51,384 --> 00:14:53,261
Did those things block off the GPS signal?

244
00:14:53,678 --> 00:14:55,388
They look like regular transceivers to me.

245
00:14:55,847 --> 00:14:57,599
I used a cheap GPS chip.

246
00:14:57,682 --> 00:14:59,059
It must have overloaded.

247
00:15:01,728 --> 00:15:04,814
How can we find that tiny button
in such a big area?

248
00:15:05,565 --> 00:15:08,151
The GPS may be off,
but the recording function should be fine.

249
00:15:09,486 --> 00:15:10,528
What if it turned off too?

250
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:13,782
It would've recorded everything
until then.

251
00:15:17,744 --> 00:15:20,956
Back in the day,
we used to smack appliances to fix them.

252
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:24,793
And if that didn't work,
we just restarted it.

253
00:15:24,876 --> 00:15:26,419
But everything is digital now...

254
00:15:27,754 --> 00:15:29,130
- That's it!
- What?

255
00:15:29,714 --> 00:15:30,674
Hey!

256
00:15:31,341 --> 00:15:34,010
We just have to restart it!

257
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:35,845
What? Did I just solve everything?

258
00:15:37,305 --> 00:15:41,017
If it's still recording,
it means the device is fine.

259
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:44,646
All we need to do
is reset the GPS signal, then.

260
00:15:48,483 --> 00:15:50,360
Who are you talking to? You're scaring me.

261
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:53,071
Hey, I know how we can find the camera.

262
00:15:53,154 --> 00:15:54,030
Follow me.

263
00:15:54,656 --> 00:15:55,949
You thought of a way?

264
00:15:56,616 --> 00:15:58,284
- What is it?
- Just follow me.

265
00:15:58,368 --> 00:16:00,203
- Is it something quick?
- Yeah.

266
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:04,791
I wonder what it filmed.

267
00:16:04,874 --> 00:16:09,129
Perhaps their hideout
or the person behind it all?

268
00:16:10,088 --> 00:16:12,048
It'll be game over if we stream this.

269
00:16:12,757 --> 00:16:14,342
Aren't you scared?

270
00:16:15,719 --> 00:16:17,012
Of course I am.

271
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:19,222
But if I hide because I'm afraid,

272
00:16:19,973 --> 00:16:21,266
they'll just keep doing it.

273
00:16:21,766 --> 00:16:22,767
Right.

274
00:16:28,857 --> 00:16:31,109
You said the GPS was turned off.
How will you retrieve it?

275
00:16:31,401 --> 00:16:35,530
I'm going to make a simple equipment
and restart it.

276
00:16:35,739 --> 00:16:37,157
Byeong-nam.

277
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,743
Are you going to send a signal
to clear the tracker's error?

278
00:16:39,826 --> 00:16:42,996
You really are smart, aren't you?

279
00:16:43,413 --> 00:16:45,081
Get on it, then.

280
00:16:45,165 --> 00:16:46,458
I'm on it.

281
00:16:47,417 --> 00:16:48,627
There's another problem.

282
00:16:50,337 --> 00:16:52,631
The industrial complex is quite big.

283
00:17:08,104 --> 00:17:09,189
Then,

284
00:17:10,607 --> 00:17:12,942
why don't we try using RC cars or drones?

285
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:16,029
We can set up the reset system on it
and look for the button.

286
00:17:16,696 --> 00:17:18,740
That'll definitely be faster than just us.

287
00:17:19,574 --> 00:17:23,036
There are too many electric wires,
so an RC car would work better.

288
00:17:23,411 --> 00:17:24,621
But here's the thing.

289
00:17:25,622 --> 00:17:29,542
A decent RC car would be quite expensive.

290
00:17:33,838 --> 00:17:36,007
I have two at home.

291
00:17:39,135 --> 00:17:42,138
I'll try to get one myself.

292
00:17:42,222 --> 00:17:43,431
Let's work with three.

293
00:17:44,015 --> 00:17:46,101
Then get some practice on your own,

294
00:17:46,184 --> 00:17:47,268
and let's wrap up for today.

295
00:17:48,561 --> 00:17:50,438
- That's a great idea.
- Yeah!

296
00:17:50,522 --> 00:17:52,565
- Let's go.
- Good work, everyone.

297
00:17:52,649 --> 00:17:53,817
All right.

298
00:18:03,118 --> 00:18:04,160
Yes?

299
00:18:05,203 --> 00:18:08,707
May I bring a laptop?

300
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:13,211
Since all signals
seem to be completely blocked here.

301
00:18:20,677 --> 00:18:21,636
Sure.

302
00:18:23,805 --> 00:18:24,889
Thank you.

303
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:33,773
SAFE GAS STATION

304
00:18:51,374 --> 00:18:53,710
We've got three RC car units on standby.

305
00:18:53,793 --> 00:18:57,047
Once the target position is identified,
we'll deploy an infiltration squad.

306
00:18:58,506 --> 00:19:01,801
The remaining units will stay on standby
and act as Rapid Response Units as needed.

307
00:19:01,885 --> 00:19:04,554
Wow, look at you, Mr. Lee.

308
00:19:05,597 --> 00:19:06,723
Roger that.

309
00:19:06,806 --> 00:19:07,724
Yes, sir.

310
00:19:13,772 --> 00:19:15,649
- Is that it?
- Yes.

311
00:19:18,276 --> 00:19:19,903
It's the laptop I mentioned.

312
00:19:19,986 --> 00:19:22,030
Where should I put it, ma'am?

313
00:19:24,157 --> 00:19:25,867
- Give it here.
- Okay.

314
00:19:26,952 --> 00:19:29,120
Su-jin, the report you just made...

315
00:19:29,204 --> 00:19:30,413
It's a situational report.

316
00:19:30,497 --> 00:19:31,456
Right,

317
00:19:31,539 --> 00:19:34,125
I guess the situation
hasn't been good lately.

318
00:19:35,669 --> 00:19:36,503
So?

319
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:39,798
So... The situation...

320
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:41,883
I think it's great.

321
00:19:41,967 --> 00:19:44,219
You're really good
at making those reports.

322
00:19:50,266 --> 00:19:52,102
I have good news and bad news.

323
00:19:52,185 --> 00:19:53,853
I'll take the good news first.

324
00:19:55,021 --> 00:19:57,065
We'll be providing equipment
for this operation.

325
00:19:59,526 --> 00:20:00,777
What's the bad news?

326
00:20:07,033 --> 00:20:08,994
If you come dressed like that again,

327
00:20:10,578 --> 00:20:11,913
I'll kill you.

328
00:20:13,123 --> 00:20:14,207
Okay.

329
00:20:22,007 --> 00:20:23,675
Why would you ask about the bad news?

330
00:20:24,467 --> 00:20:25,677
I can't believe you.

331
00:20:31,182 --> 00:20:32,642
Hello!

332
00:20:33,059 --> 00:20:34,519
Hello.

333
00:20:34,602 --> 00:20:35,770
I'm here to pick up some clothes.

334
00:20:35,854 --> 00:20:37,856
I was wondering why you weren't coming.

335
00:20:38,315 --> 00:20:41,359
You're here to pick up
the jacket that Kang brought, right?

336
00:20:41,443 --> 00:20:43,945
Yes, do you remember
every piece of clothing you get?

337
00:20:44,029 --> 00:20:47,407
Of course, I've had this job for decades.

338
00:20:47,782 --> 00:20:49,117
All right.

339
00:20:50,619 --> 00:20:52,746
That'll be 10,000 won.

340
00:20:52,829 --> 00:20:55,582
Do-yeon, you get prettier
every time I see you.

341
00:20:55,665 --> 00:20:56,916
Thank you.

342
00:20:58,084 --> 00:20:59,377
- Here.
- Thanks.

343
00:20:59,461 --> 00:21:01,296
Are you done unpacking all the boxes now?

344
00:21:02,339 --> 00:21:07,302
Kang said that there were so many
that some hadn't even been opened.

345
00:21:07,385 --> 00:21:09,596
He told you that?

346
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:12,557
I also know how scary you are.

347
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:14,809
Me?

348
00:21:14,893 --> 00:21:16,811
Why would he say something so unnecessary?

349
00:21:16,895 --> 00:21:19,939
I also heard many of those boxes
were Do-yeon's stuff.

350
00:21:20,398 --> 00:21:22,192
That's the case
for every family with kids.

351
00:21:22,275 --> 00:21:23,610
Oh, right.

352
00:21:23,693 --> 00:21:26,071
If Do-yeon has any clothes she's outgrown

353
00:21:26,154 --> 00:21:27,947
or toys she no longer plays with,

354
00:21:28,031 --> 00:21:29,908
sell them at the Changri Market.

355
00:21:29,991 --> 00:21:31,034
Changri Market?

356
00:21:31,117 --> 00:21:32,911
Oh, you don't know about it yet.

357
00:21:32,994 --> 00:21:35,830
It's run by the Women's Association.

358
00:21:35,914 --> 00:21:39,459
You can trade items and share some snacks.

359
00:21:39,542 --> 00:21:42,003
It's a good way
to get to know your neighbors too.

360
00:21:42,796 --> 00:21:45,090
- And Do-yeon would make some friends.
- Yes.

361
00:21:47,258 --> 00:21:49,469
- Thank you.
- Okay, goodbye.

362
00:21:49,552 --> 00:21:51,972
- Goodbye.
- Okay, bye.

363
00:22:07,612 --> 00:22:10,949
CHANGRI MARKET

364
00:22:16,788 --> 00:22:18,206
Oh, it's Mr. Kim.

365
00:22:19,082 --> 00:22:20,583
Hello, Mr. Kim.

366
00:22:20,667 --> 00:22:21,960
Hi, Do-yeon!

367
00:22:22,752 --> 00:22:24,212
- Hi.
- Do-yeon.

368
00:22:26,006 --> 00:22:26,965
Hello.

369
00:22:27,048 --> 00:22:30,969
Since I'm close with Kang,
may I call you by your name?

370
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:34,055
Oh, you're the owner, right?

371
00:22:34,139 --> 00:22:35,682
Yes, I'm the owner,

372
00:22:35,765 --> 00:22:37,851
and my wife is the boss.

373
00:22:39,394 --> 00:22:41,354
You must be making kimchi stew
with curry powder.

374
00:22:42,564 --> 00:22:43,982
How did you know?

375
00:22:44,065 --> 00:22:46,026
Kang wouldn't stop bragging about it.

376
00:22:46,109 --> 00:22:48,028
He said you had a secret recipe.

377
00:22:48,528 --> 00:22:50,071
He really shares everything, huh?

378
00:22:50,322 --> 00:22:51,740
We just talk about life, you know.

379
00:22:52,282 --> 00:22:53,408
- Take your time.
- Okay.

380
00:22:53,491 --> 00:22:55,410
- Ask Mommy to get you some snacks.
- Okay.

381
00:22:55,994 --> 00:22:56,953
Let's go.

382
00:22:59,456 --> 00:23:01,583
- Hi, Do-yeon.
- Hi, Min-seo.

383
00:23:07,672 --> 00:23:08,798
There we go.

384
00:23:10,925 --> 00:23:13,011
What are you doing tomorrow?

385
00:23:13,762 --> 00:23:16,723
If you're not busy,
I'd love to invite you to this.

386
00:23:16,806 --> 00:23:19,392
Oh, the Changri Market?

387
00:23:19,726 --> 00:23:21,645
The laundry place owner told me about it.

388
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,606
As expected
from the head of our neighborhood.

389
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,900
Come with Do-yeon if you're not busy.

390
00:23:26,983 --> 00:23:28,234
Will Min-seo be there too?

391
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:31,404
She'll probably come by
after her tutoring session.

392
00:23:31,488 --> 00:23:33,531
The pancakes there are the best.

393
00:23:33,615 --> 00:23:34,866
- Pancakes?
- Yes.

394
00:23:34,949 --> 00:23:36,493
Mom, I want to go.

395
00:23:36,576 --> 00:23:37,535
Let's go!

396
00:23:37,827 --> 00:23:39,204
- Should we?
- Yes!

397
00:23:39,621 --> 00:23:41,081
Yes, pancakes!

398
00:23:41,164 --> 00:23:42,540
- Pancakes!
- Pancakes!

399
00:23:42,624 --> 00:23:45,669
CHANGRI MARKET

400
00:23:47,754 --> 00:23:50,382
When did you become friends
with the daughter of the grocery store?

401
00:23:51,341 --> 00:23:53,009
You're so popular.

402
00:23:53,426 --> 00:23:54,761
I'm friends with everyone.

403
00:23:55,428 --> 00:23:58,056
Dad and Master Lee are also super close.

404
00:23:58,139 --> 00:23:59,849
They're always whispering to each other.

405
00:24:00,433 --> 00:24:02,060
That's so funny.

406
00:24:02,143 --> 00:24:03,228
I know.

407
00:24:03,311 --> 00:24:04,896
He's so talkative.

408
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:08,608
We're almost home.

409
00:24:11,528 --> 00:24:13,279
It's the car from the laundry place.

410
00:24:28,044 --> 00:24:29,045
Let's go up.

411
00:24:29,421 --> 00:24:30,380
Okay.

412
00:24:42,309 --> 00:24:43,351
Why did you call me?

413
00:24:47,314 --> 00:24:48,815
Welcome, secret agent.

414
00:24:56,531 --> 00:24:57,866
How does it look?

415
00:24:57,949 --> 00:24:58,908
What's that?

416
00:24:58,992 --> 00:25:01,369
It's 350g in weight and 32cm in length.

417
00:25:01,453 --> 00:25:04,748
Since it's the standard size
for Special Forces worldwide,

418
00:25:04,831 --> 00:25:05,790
it should be good.

419
00:25:05,874 --> 00:25:08,877
When this is out,
use it as a tactical baton.

420
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,255
And when it's folded...

421
00:25:12,339 --> 00:25:14,090
You've watched that movie, right?

422
00:25:15,967 --> 00:25:17,260
"What are you saying?"

423
00:25:17,719 --> 00:25:20,138
Use it as a hatchet or a hammer
and just strike!

424
00:25:20,221 --> 00:25:22,057
It'll knock out anyone's teeth in seconds.

425
00:25:24,017 --> 00:25:24,851
Here.

426
00:25:29,439 --> 00:25:30,607
This is awesome.

427
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:31,650
Right?

428
00:25:34,903 --> 00:25:37,322
It's useful for both
short and long distance combats.

429
00:25:42,661 --> 00:25:43,495
Hold on.

430
00:25:43,578 --> 00:25:44,496
Is this...

431
00:25:48,166 --> 00:25:49,918
Is this also a taser?

432
00:25:50,001 --> 00:25:51,378
Don't be ridiculous.

433
00:25:51,461 --> 00:25:53,338
I just took out the magic wand sounds.

434
00:25:56,841 --> 00:25:58,009
As for how it looks...

435
00:25:58,093 --> 00:25:58,927
Yes?

436
00:26:00,512 --> 00:26:02,055
- it's a pass.
- Yes!

437
00:26:03,014 --> 00:26:04,224
Right on!

438
00:26:04,307 --> 00:26:06,017
What about the GPS transmitter?

439
00:26:06,101 --> 00:26:07,477
Don't worry about that.

440
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,655
You attached GPS transmitters to these?

441
00:26:18,738 --> 00:26:20,490
That's right.

442
00:26:21,074 --> 00:26:22,575
I went to the industrial complex
for a scan--

443
00:26:22,659 --> 00:26:24,160
You're so well-prepared!

444
00:26:24,703 --> 00:26:26,288
And several offices
were closed for the weekend.

445
00:26:26,371 --> 00:26:28,707
Well, everyone works five days a week.

446
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:29,833
Many factories were empty.

447
00:26:29,916 --> 00:26:31,710
No surprise there. The economy is bad.

448
00:26:31,793 --> 00:26:33,545
Stop yapping and listen.

449
00:26:35,338 --> 00:26:36,256
Okay.

450
00:26:38,133 --> 00:26:40,010
Let's get everything done tomorrow.

451
00:26:40,093 --> 00:26:43,054
Are we going in immediately
once we find the location?

452
00:26:44,014 --> 00:26:45,807
Should we go at night, then?

453
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:47,976
It'll be easier to operate the RC cars
during the day.

454
00:26:48,768 --> 00:26:51,563
I can't go anywhere during the day
because of Changri Market tomorrow.

455
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:53,523
The recon team can go during the day,

456
00:26:53,606 --> 00:26:55,442
and the entry team can go at night.

457
00:26:55,775 --> 00:26:56,943
That should be fine, then.

458
00:26:57,027 --> 00:26:58,695
Mr. Choi, you can go in first.

459
00:26:58,778 --> 00:27:00,155
I'll support you from the back.

460
00:27:00,238 --> 00:27:01,406
Okay.

461
00:27:01,489 --> 00:27:03,867
How do we work these transmitters?

462
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:05,452
It's simple.

463
00:27:06,703 --> 00:27:08,288
Turn it on before you drive it,

464
00:27:08,371 --> 00:27:10,290
and the GPS tracker
will receive the signal and reset.

465
00:27:10,373 --> 00:27:12,375
Then I'll see its location
on my phone again.

466
00:27:12,459 --> 00:27:13,877
I'll go in to retrieve it.

467
00:27:14,628 --> 00:27:16,755
- And Ms. Jung will back me up.
- Okay.

468
00:27:19,549 --> 00:27:21,885
We can communicate with you
from here with these.

469
00:27:23,136 --> 00:27:25,388
- How?
- It's connected to the bunker computer.

470
00:27:26,681 --> 00:27:29,059
This is a wiretap device.

471
00:27:30,268 --> 00:27:31,478
That's awesome.

472
00:27:31,561 --> 00:27:32,646
- Let's try them.
- Okay.

473
00:27:36,858 --> 00:27:37,942
Thank you.

474
00:27:43,615 --> 00:27:48,203
We can expedite it by assigning it
as a special disaster zone.

475
00:27:48,286 --> 00:27:51,790
There would be a good reason,
so we can provide some solid support

476
00:27:51,873 --> 00:27:53,959
through government aid or tax benefits.

477
00:27:54,042 --> 00:27:55,961
That's an option,

478
00:27:56,044 --> 00:27:58,880
but there needs to be an actual disaster.

479
00:28:02,342 --> 00:28:05,887
Terrorism is a disaster to our society.

480
00:28:05,971 --> 00:28:08,890
It threatens national security
and social order.

481
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:14,562
My local residents
are going crazy with paranoia.

482
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:16,481
Cut them some slack.

483
00:28:16,731 --> 00:28:19,025
It's about the scale of the damage.

484
00:28:19,901 --> 00:28:22,445
The damage isn't big enough
to count as a disaster.

485
00:28:25,323 --> 00:28:28,702
I trust your son is doing well
and not causing any trouble.

486
00:28:32,789 --> 00:28:34,582
Of course, he's very well.

487
00:28:35,667 --> 00:28:39,212
I forgot to bring him to thank you.

488
00:28:41,548 --> 00:28:43,049
Thank me?

489
00:28:45,093 --> 00:28:46,386
There's no need for that.

490
00:28:48,054 --> 00:28:51,016
Please just back me up
on the disaster zone.

491
00:28:51,891 --> 00:28:55,061
Your son really is unlucky.

492
00:28:55,145 --> 00:28:57,480
He just had to hit
Sullivan's daughter, of all people.

493
00:29:02,277 --> 00:29:04,070
It's hard for us too, you know.

494
00:29:04,654 --> 00:29:07,324
Sullivan's about to pull out
after the final verdict.

495
00:29:08,241 --> 00:29:11,453
It's been absolute chaos.

496
00:29:17,292 --> 00:29:19,085
I'm out now.

497
00:29:19,169 --> 00:29:20,170
Bring the car.

498
00:29:40,899 --> 00:29:41,775
Are you...

499
00:30:48,091 --> 00:30:49,050
Honey?

500
00:30:53,054 --> 00:30:53,972
Are we moving again?

501
00:30:55,765 --> 00:30:57,726
These are for Changri Market tomorrow.

502
00:30:58,727 --> 00:31:01,187
Oh, Changri Market.

503
00:31:01,563 --> 00:31:03,815
The Women's Association is hosting it.
I hear it's a lot of fun.

504
00:31:03,898 --> 00:31:05,066
Yeah, I heard.

505
00:31:05,358 --> 00:31:06,693
Let's go tomorrow.

506
00:31:06,776 --> 00:31:09,029
It's been a while since we've eaten out.

507
00:31:09,112 --> 00:31:10,989
I have plans tomorrow evening.

508
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:14,075
You're going out with the youth president
on a weekend?

509
00:31:14,326 --> 00:31:15,368
No, that's not it--

510
00:31:15,452 --> 00:31:16,286
Okay, then.

511
00:31:18,455 --> 00:31:22,500
Introduce me to the people
you're close to tomorrow.

512
00:31:23,001 --> 00:31:26,004
The neighborhood leaders seem great.

513
00:31:26,087 --> 00:31:27,213
They adore Do-yeon too.

514
00:31:27,714 --> 00:31:29,633
I'd like to get to know them as well.

515
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:32,719
I'm not meeting
the youth president tomorrow--

516
00:31:32,802 --> 00:31:34,137
Cancel whatever it is.

517
00:31:35,055 --> 00:31:36,431
I'm not saying it again.

518
00:31:36,973 --> 00:31:37,932
Okay.

519
00:31:41,061 --> 00:31:42,103
Leave it.

520
00:31:42,812 --> 00:31:44,064
Just go and get changed.

521
00:32:29,693 --> 00:32:30,652
Get in.

522
00:32:31,194 --> 00:32:32,988
Wow, this is a new car.

523
00:32:33,071 --> 00:32:33,947
It's my backup car.

524
00:32:34,781 --> 00:32:37,158
Man, this is sick.

525
00:32:41,246 --> 00:32:42,706
- Let's go.
- All right.

526
00:32:42,789 --> 00:32:43,707
Yes.

527
00:33:04,019 --> 00:33:06,313
Let's see. Here.

528
00:33:08,523 --> 00:33:10,025
- I'll park the car and join you.
- Okay.

529
00:33:10,483 --> 00:33:11,484
Let's go.

530
00:33:11,568 --> 00:33:12,736
- See you soon.
- Okay.

531
00:33:17,657 --> 00:33:21,870
BUY, SELL, AND SHARE AT CHANGRI MARKET

532
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,624
Don't run, Do-yeon.

533
00:33:25,707 --> 00:33:26,708
Okay!

534
00:33:28,001 --> 00:33:29,127
Hi, Ms. Hwang.

535
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:31,004
- Hello.
- Hello.

536
00:33:31,338 --> 00:33:33,256
Where should I put the donation items?

537
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:35,050
Could you take it for her?

538
00:33:35,133 --> 00:33:37,135
Come and have some dried persimmons first.

539
00:33:37,218 --> 00:33:38,178
They're amazing.

540
00:33:40,347 --> 00:33:41,222
Let's have a taste.

541
00:33:41,306 --> 00:33:42,891
Here. Have some.

542
00:33:42,974 --> 00:33:44,309
- They look so good.
- They look great.

543
00:33:50,857 --> 00:33:51,983
It's so good.

544
00:33:52,067 --> 00:33:53,485
- Do you like it?
- I love it.

545
00:33:54,361 --> 00:33:55,278
It's amazing.

546
00:33:55,362 --> 00:33:57,322
Oh, they're from Sangju.

547
00:33:57,697 --> 00:33:59,491
Sangju has the best dried persimmons.

548
00:33:59,574 --> 00:34:01,242
I'm originally from Sangju.

549
00:34:01,326 --> 00:34:02,827
- Really?
- Yeah.

550
00:34:03,244 --> 00:34:05,205
You must've had a lot of these, Ms. Hwang.

551
00:34:05,288 --> 00:34:08,083
Please call me Mi-gyeong.

552
00:34:08,625 --> 00:34:10,460
Should I, Mi-gyeong?

553
00:34:11,169 --> 00:34:12,963
- Here's your coffee.
- Thank you.

554
00:34:13,046 --> 00:34:14,172
- Try it. It's so good.
- Is it?

555
00:34:14,255 --> 00:34:15,298
It's amazing.

556
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:21,638
By the way,
who's the youth association president?

557
00:34:22,430 --> 00:34:25,809
My husband always talks about him,
so I wanted to say hi.

558
00:34:26,768 --> 00:34:28,937
Oh, the youth association president?

559
00:34:30,397 --> 00:34:32,190
I guess he's gone somewhere.

560
00:34:32,273 --> 00:34:33,942
I don't see him.

561
00:34:34,275 --> 00:34:35,360
Where did he go?

562
00:34:35,443 --> 00:34:37,195
Then how about
the manager from Yongmu Gym?

563
00:34:38,405 --> 00:34:40,156
Oh, my.

564
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:42,409
Come to think of it,
he's not here, either.

565
00:34:42,492 --> 00:34:43,535
You're right.

566
00:34:43,618 --> 00:34:45,078
Where did they all go?

567
00:34:46,913 --> 00:34:48,039
Have some more.

568
00:34:48,456 --> 00:34:49,457
- Isn't it good?
- Yeah.

569
00:34:49,541 --> 00:34:51,334
- They're amazing.
- For sure.

570
00:34:51,418 --> 00:34:52,752
- They're so good.
- Have some more.

571
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:02,929
Hold up.

572
00:35:05,515 --> 00:35:06,349
Hey.

573
00:35:06,433 --> 00:35:07,767
<i>How are things looking there?</i>

574
00:35:07,851 --> 00:35:10,270
It's the perfect weather for a drive.

575
00:35:11,187 --> 00:35:13,356
Don't worry about us. You just sit tight.

576
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,274
See you later.

577
00:35:16,151 --> 00:35:17,152
Did you practice a lot?

578
00:35:17,235 --> 00:35:18,945
Yeah, I practiced all night.

579
00:35:19,321 --> 00:35:20,363
Shall we begin?

580
00:35:21,906 --> 00:35:22,866
Yeah.

581
00:36:01,321 --> 00:36:02,947
We can't go too fast.

582
00:36:03,239 --> 00:36:04,949
The signals take some time to transmit.

583
00:36:06,701 --> 00:36:08,328
How fast should we go, then?

584
00:36:09,955 --> 00:36:11,164
At an adequate speed?

585
00:36:53,081 --> 00:36:54,207
Oh, no.

586
00:36:55,166 --> 00:36:56,042
What's wrong?

587
00:36:56,126 --> 00:36:58,503
Man! It's not working.

588
00:37:01,006 --> 00:37:02,173
What are you doing?

589
00:37:02,257 --> 00:37:03,925
- Just run with it, then!
- Oh, come on!

590
00:37:04,009 --> 00:37:06,720
You lied about practicing, didn't you?

591
00:37:07,554 --> 00:37:08,680
Let's see.

592
00:37:24,446 --> 00:37:25,405
Hey!

593
00:37:27,907 --> 00:37:29,451
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

594
00:37:32,245 --> 00:37:34,080
Oh, no. It's completely ruined.

595
00:37:35,749 --> 00:37:36,750
The transmitter.

596
00:37:37,292 --> 00:37:38,126
Okay.

597
00:38:35,475 --> 00:38:36,476
What the...

598
00:39:11,386 --> 00:39:12,429
Is it here?

599
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:18,143
Found it.

600
00:39:18,810 --> 00:39:19,936
I found it, Byeong-nam.

601
00:39:21,021 --> 00:39:21,855
You found it?

602
00:39:22,647 --> 00:39:24,399
- Yeah.
- Okay.

603
00:39:24,482 --> 00:39:26,151
Put the wiretap device on it.

604
00:39:26,735 --> 00:39:27,694
Okay.

605
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:47,964
Where are you?

606
00:40:10,195 --> 00:40:11,446
Excuse me!

607
00:40:15,742 --> 00:40:16,701
Me?

608
00:40:20,872 --> 00:40:23,333
What are you doing with my RC car?

609
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:26,127
Oh, is this yours?

610
00:40:27,337 --> 00:40:28,505
What are you doing here?

611
00:40:29,923 --> 00:40:32,258
What else? Practicing my driving skills.

612
00:40:32,342 --> 00:40:35,553
This is the best place to practice
on weekends.

613
00:40:41,935 --> 00:40:43,103
Take it somewhere else.

614
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:53,238
Hey! Retreat!

615
00:40:54,322 --> 00:40:55,448
Nice one, Byeong-nam.

616
00:41:00,787 --> 00:41:02,247
- Yong-hui.
- Yeah?

617
00:41:02,330 --> 00:41:03,707
- Take this.
- Why?

618
00:41:04,541 --> 00:41:06,543
- You two go ahead.
- What about you?

619
00:41:06,626 --> 00:41:09,337
I'll stay here until the entry team comes.

620
00:41:11,715 --> 00:41:13,675
- I'll be back soon.
- Okay, see you.

621
00:41:21,141 --> 00:41:22,350
Wait here, okay?

622
00:41:22,434 --> 00:41:23,351
Okay.

623
00:41:26,187 --> 00:41:27,397
It's so good.

624
00:41:28,106 --> 00:41:29,399
They found the button.

625
00:41:29,482 --> 00:41:30,525
Yes, I heard.

626
00:41:30,608 --> 00:41:33,445
My husband will clean up for me,
so let's get going soon.

627
00:41:34,738 --> 00:41:36,114
I'll be a bit late.

628
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:38,616
What would you like? This?

629
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:40,744
- Your wife?
- Yeah.

630
00:41:41,202 --> 00:41:43,121
Okay, drive there on your own
if you need to.

631
00:42:15,528 --> 00:42:17,697
You'll be blocked
if you fail more than twice.

632
00:42:17,781 --> 00:42:21,117
Come on, Su-jin.
I served in the 900th Unit.

633
00:42:47,227 --> 00:42:48,728
- Amazing.
- It's nothing.

634
00:42:50,146 --> 00:42:51,231
Okay.

635
00:43:02,242 --> 00:43:03,201
Okay.

636
00:43:05,954 --> 00:43:07,455
You see that there? It's on.

637
00:43:12,919 --> 00:43:14,713
<i>The soccer match is today, right?</i>

638
00:43:14,796 --> 00:43:16,339
<i>Yes, it's at 8 p.m.</i>

639
00:43:16,589 --> 00:43:18,967
It's going to be an exciting match.

640
00:43:19,509 --> 00:43:21,970
<i>Order some beer and snacks for later.</i>

641
00:43:22,053 --> 00:43:22,971
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

642
00:43:25,223 --> 00:43:27,058
Nice. We can hear them loud and clear.

643
00:43:36,901 --> 00:43:37,902
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

644
00:43:39,279 --> 00:43:40,280
Yes, I can.

645
00:43:41,489 --> 00:43:43,033
When is the entry team coming?

646
00:43:45,994 --> 00:43:47,329
I just arrived at the market.

647
00:43:48,705 --> 00:43:50,081
Yes, I'll head on over with them.

648
00:43:56,796 --> 00:43:57,714
- See you.
- Okay.

649
00:43:57,797 --> 00:43:58,798
See you later.

650
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:22,656
We're almost there.
See you at the entrance.

651
00:44:33,959 --> 00:44:35,210
<i>- Byeong-nam.</i>
<i>- Hey.</i>

652
00:44:35,794 --> 00:44:37,796
Where's Kang?

653
00:44:38,046 --> 00:44:40,048
<i>He'll be a bit late.</i>

654
00:44:40,131 --> 00:44:42,342
They're having beer while watching soccer.

655
00:44:42,425 --> 00:44:43,760
Should we wait until they pass out?

656
00:44:49,391 --> 00:44:51,393
No, we have to go in.

657
00:44:51,476 --> 00:44:53,353
<i>So what's the plan?</i>

658
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:01,152
You have to have fried chicken for soccer.

659
00:45:30,557 --> 00:45:34,686
SEONBONG TRADING

660
00:45:38,898 --> 00:45:40,275
Delivery!

661
00:45:45,739 --> 00:45:46,948
Your delivery, sir.

662
00:45:47,657 --> 00:45:49,534
Here you go.

663
00:45:55,373 --> 00:45:56,333
Oh, a credit card.

664
00:45:59,377 --> 00:46:01,463
You didn't bring your card reader?

665
00:46:01,796 --> 00:46:03,423
I did, but...

666
00:46:04,132 --> 00:46:06,509
Sorry, please hold on.

667
00:46:08,678 --> 00:46:10,138
I'll just wire the money.

668
00:46:11,181 --> 00:46:12,515
Oh, will you?

669
00:46:12,724 --> 00:46:14,684
Thank you. Here you go.

670
00:47:01,106 --> 00:47:02,941
- Nine, zero...
- Nine, zero...

671
00:47:03,024 --> 00:47:03,858
No, nine, one.

672
00:47:03,942 --> 00:47:05,610
- I mean...
- Nine...

673
00:47:05,902 --> 00:47:07,362
- Two.
- Yes, then eight.

674
00:47:13,952 --> 00:47:16,705
Byeong-nam, the real delivery guy is here!

675
00:47:16,788 --> 00:47:18,290
<i>- The real delivery guy!</i>
<i>- </i>What? Delivery?

676
00:47:18,373 --> 00:47:20,166
- Delivery?
- Delivery!

677
00:47:22,836 --> 00:47:25,505
Here's your pig's trotters.

678
00:47:25,588 --> 00:47:26,589
Hey!

679
00:47:28,133 --> 00:47:29,134
Give me your card reader.

680
00:47:29,759 --> 00:47:31,011
Who are you?

681
00:47:31,094 --> 00:47:32,095
The card reader.

682
00:47:32,846 --> 00:47:33,972
Give it to me.

683
00:47:35,098 --> 00:47:37,225
All right. I'll take your card.

684
00:47:38,351 --> 00:47:39,644
Hold on.

685
00:47:39,936 --> 00:47:40,895
It's fried chicken.

686
00:47:44,399 --> 00:47:46,526
- I ordered pig's trotters.
- What?

687
00:47:51,197 --> 00:47:52,991
It's a buy-one, get-one-free deal.

688
00:47:53,074 --> 00:47:55,994
If you order pig's trotters,
you get fried chicken for free.

689
00:47:56,077 --> 00:47:57,203
Please enjoy!

690
00:47:57,287 --> 00:47:58,496
I'm back.

691
00:48:04,169 --> 00:48:05,837
So this is...

692
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:06,796
Hold on.

693
00:48:08,423 --> 00:48:09,466
Hey.

694
00:48:10,425 --> 00:48:12,177
- The RC car guy, right?
- What?

695
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:13,470
What? What do you mean?

696
00:48:13,553 --> 00:48:15,388
- Take it off.
- Wait.

697
00:48:15,889 --> 00:48:17,807
- Take it off!
- No!

698
00:48:17,891 --> 00:48:19,476
Sir, please!

699
00:48:24,397 --> 00:48:25,690
This is bullshit.

700
00:48:25,774 --> 00:48:27,525
What the hell do you think you're doing?

701
00:48:28,151 --> 00:48:29,611
Shut up and come at me.

702
00:48:29,694 --> 00:48:31,196
Damn it!

703
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:44,542
Honey.

704
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:48,338
- Kang?
- Yeah?

705
00:48:49,297 --> 00:48:50,215
What's up?

706
00:48:50,924 --> 00:48:52,550
What should we have for dinner?

707
00:48:54,094 --> 00:48:55,178
Anything's fine with me.

708
00:49:00,308 --> 00:49:01,518
Are you that worried?

709
00:49:03,269 --> 00:49:04,187
Huh?

710
00:49:12,821 --> 00:49:14,489
- Hey, come here.
- What?

711
00:49:14,572 --> 00:49:16,616
- I said, come here.
- What? No.

712
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:17,951
- Sir...
- Come here.

713
00:49:18,034 --> 00:49:20,704
- Come over here!
- Hold on.

714
00:49:23,623 --> 00:49:26,126
The hell are you doing, you bastard?

715
00:49:27,002 --> 00:49:28,253
Hey, put that down.

716
00:49:28,962 --> 00:49:30,380
Put that down!

717
00:49:31,172 --> 00:49:32,674
- Put it down.
- Put it down.

718
00:49:59,075 --> 00:50:01,077
You think you can get me that easily?

719
00:50:09,419 --> 00:50:11,588
- Bring it on!
- Bring it on!

720
00:50:11,671 --> 00:50:12,547
You heard him, right?

721
00:50:24,225 --> 00:50:25,602
There's an emergency!

722
00:50:26,394 --> 00:50:28,021
Are you okay, Byeong-nam?

723
00:50:28,271 --> 00:50:29,105
Jeong-hwan!

724
00:50:29,189 --> 00:50:31,941
Byeong-nam and Nam-yeon won't answer!

725
00:50:32,025 --> 00:50:33,526
<i>You have to go in and help!</i>

726
00:50:33,610 --> 00:50:34,861
Me?

727
00:50:34,944 --> 00:50:37,113
Okay, I'm on it right now.

728
00:50:42,869 --> 00:50:44,329
Bring it on, you bastards!

729
00:50:45,830 --> 00:50:47,040
Jeong-hwan!

730
00:50:47,123 --> 00:50:49,125
Byeong-nam! Are you okay?

731
00:50:49,209 --> 00:50:50,919
Why did you come?

732
00:50:52,504 --> 00:50:53,546
Ms. Jung!

733
00:50:55,340 --> 00:50:57,217
Hey, are you okay?

734
00:51:02,472 --> 00:51:04,641
Don't mess with a former artilleryman!

735
00:51:08,812 --> 00:51:11,106
- Oh, no.
- That kid.

736
00:51:19,572 --> 00:51:21,074
Jeong-hwan, what's going on?

737
00:51:21,533 --> 00:51:23,535
Byeong-nam! Nam-yeon!

738
00:51:23,618 --> 00:51:25,578
Please answer me! Anyone?

739
00:51:25,662 --> 00:51:26,621
Come on!

740
00:51:35,213 --> 00:51:38,550
You're one strong lady, huh?

741
00:51:38,925 --> 00:51:39,884
The hell are you looking at?

742
00:51:39,968 --> 00:51:41,803
Please stop hurting us.

743
00:51:43,263 --> 00:51:45,223
Answer me when I'm asking nicely, then.

744
00:51:45,473 --> 00:51:47,058
What are you guys?

745
00:51:47,142 --> 00:51:51,771
You can't hit us then expect us to answer.

746
00:51:51,855 --> 00:51:53,064
Why don't I hit you nicely, then?

747
00:51:53,815 --> 00:51:56,026
Hey, just get rid of them.

748
00:51:56,109 --> 00:51:58,570
- Get rid of us?
- Get rid of them.

749
00:51:58,653 --> 00:51:59,821
- What?
- Let's go.

750
00:51:59,904 --> 00:52:01,698
No, wait.

751
00:52:02,032 --> 00:52:03,908
- Get off me.
- Let's go.

752
00:52:13,585 --> 00:52:14,628
Mr. Choi!

753
00:52:14,711 --> 00:52:16,212
- Kang!
- Kang!

754
00:52:19,758 --> 00:52:20,842
Sorry, I took too long.

755
00:52:20,925 --> 00:52:22,218
Oh, goodness.

756
00:52:22,886 --> 00:52:24,054
We're safe now.

757
00:52:27,265 --> 00:52:29,768
You didn't take long at all.

758
00:52:31,269 --> 00:52:32,312
Sorry.

759
00:52:41,112 --> 00:52:42,155
What are you doing?

760
00:52:42,947 --> 00:52:44,074
Get him.

761
00:52:44,574 --> 00:52:45,700
You're dead.

762
00:53:38,586 --> 00:53:39,546
Oh, my.

763
00:53:45,176 --> 00:53:46,094
Are you okay?

764
00:53:46,177 --> 00:53:47,512
Are you okay, Ms. Jung?

765
00:53:47,595 --> 00:53:49,347
Yes, I'm fine.

766
00:53:53,393 --> 00:53:55,437
<i>Is everyone okay?</i>

767
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:56,479
Yeah, we're fine.

768
00:53:56,563 --> 00:53:58,231
Took you long enough to check on us.

769
00:53:58,315 --> 00:54:01,443
<i>Nam-yeon, the GPS tracker</i>
<i>is located by the entrance.</i>

770
00:54:01,526 --> 00:54:03,111
<i>Is there a room there?</i>

771
00:54:03,194 --> 00:54:04,988
Oh, gosh.

772
00:54:05,071 --> 00:54:05,989
My legs are killing me.

773
00:54:10,243 --> 00:54:11,119
What the...

774
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:16,207
It's a button?

775
00:54:18,877 --> 00:54:19,961
<i>I got it.</i>

776
00:54:22,297 --> 00:54:23,632
Yes!

777
00:54:25,342 --> 00:54:27,344
All right!

778
00:55:11,763 --> 00:55:13,807
What took you so long?

779
00:55:14,557 --> 00:55:15,850
It's a long story.

780
00:55:16,643 --> 00:55:18,728
What did you tell your wife to come here?

781
00:55:20,021 --> 00:55:21,731
I didn't say anything.

782
00:55:22,941 --> 00:55:24,192
She told me...

783
00:55:30,323 --> 00:55:32,200
to save everyone.

784
00:55:32,784 --> 00:55:33,827
Go.

785
00:55:36,621 --> 00:55:39,499
Whatever it is, I guess they need you.

786
00:55:40,083 --> 00:55:41,209
Can I really go?

787
00:55:43,211 --> 00:55:44,379
Just don't get hurt.

788
00:55:45,422 --> 00:55:46,881
And don't come home too late.

789
00:55:47,090 --> 00:55:49,926
Do-yeon won't go to bed until you're home.

790
00:55:50,010 --> 00:55:50,927
Okay.

791
00:56:19,914 --> 00:56:20,790
What happened?

792
00:56:20,874 --> 00:56:22,667
I have no idea.

793
00:56:22,751 --> 00:56:24,169
They didn't steal anything from us.

794
00:56:24,252 --> 00:56:25,295
You moron!

795
00:56:25,378 --> 00:56:27,464
Are you saying
they just came to mess with us?

796
00:56:28,381 --> 00:56:29,841
You need to come and see this.

797
00:56:29,924 --> 00:56:31,217
What is it now?

798
00:56:41,019 --> 00:56:41,853
Look at this.

799
00:56:52,030 --> 00:56:53,823
Who are those guys?

800
00:57:00,622 --> 00:57:02,123
What are all these?

801
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:10,882
What are these?

802
00:57:10,966 --> 00:57:13,635
It was dark,

803
00:57:13,718 --> 00:57:15,887
and they all looked the same.

804
00:57:15,971 --> 00:57:17,013
This was the best way.

805
00:57:19,808 --> 00:57:21,601
My goodness.

806
00:57:21,685 --> 00:57:23,019
I'm not surprised.

807
00:57:23,103 --> 00:57:24,688
How will we find it?

808
00:57:30,110 --> 00:57:32,779
Man, this is...

809
00:57:32,862 --> 00:57:33,905
You got all their buttons.

810
00:57:39,411 --> 00:57:40,578
This is it.

811
00:57:42,372 --> 00:57:43,373
Here.

812
00:57:44,207 --> 00:57:45,041
Check it.

813
00:57:45,750 --> 00:57:48,962
<i>Didn't I tell you</i>
<i>to get rid of Kim In-seop?</i>

814
00:57:50,463 --> 00:57:52,882
<i>You plan to keep up with this shit job?</i>

815
00:57:54,092 --> 00:57:56,261
<i>I told you to leave no trace</i>

816
00:57:56,344 --> 00:57:59,848
<i>of anyone and anything</i>
<i>related to the bombs.</i>

817
00:57:59,931 --> 00:58:04,227
<i>What should I do with you?</i>

818
00:58:04,686 --> 00:58:06,104
Is he the mastermind behind it?

819
00:58:06,187 --> 00:58:09,065
Seeing how he's talking about bombs,
it seems to be him.

820
00:58:11,735 --> 00:58:13,903
<i>Apologies, sir. I'll take care of it.</i>

821
00:58:13,987 --> 00:58:15,697
<i>Take care of what? Huh?</i>

822
00:58:22,871 --> 00:58:25,040
Oh, that's...

823
00:58:27,292 --> 00:58:28,293
What is it?

824
00:58:28,376 --> 00:58:29,252
Do you know him?

825
00:58:31,379 --> 00:58:32,422
Who is it?

826
00:58:33,214 --> 00:58:34,215
Who is he?

827
00:58:37,218 --> 00:58:38,428
Kim Seok-jun.

828
00:58:39,596 --> 00:58:41,264
The Minister of National Defense.

829
00:59:47,163 --> 00:59:50,000
HEROES NEXT DOOR

830
00:59:53,628 --> 00:59:55,755
Where's Dad, by the way?

831
00:59:56,965 --> 00:59:58,300
He's meeting a friend.

832
00:59:58,383 --> 00:59:59,509
A friend?

833
00:59:59,592 --> 01:00:00,510
This late?

834
01:00:24,242 --> 01:00:25,660
It's Mr. Ice Cream.

835
01:01:03,948 --> 01:01:06,534
<i>Did you really not know</i>
<i>the Minister took Producer Kim?</i>

836
01:01:06,618 --> 01:01:09,162
Did you approach me on purpose,
knowing everything?

837
01:01:09,245 --> 01:01:11,373
<i>You think the Minister of National Defense</i>

838
01:01:11,456 --> 01:01:14,918
would sneak away some bombs
for pocket money?

839
01:01:15,001 --> 01:01:17,754
<i>Why do these bastards keep messing around</i>
<i>in our neighborhood?</i>

840
01:01:17,837 --> 01:01:19,297
This is why we can't leave loose ends.

841
01:01:19,381 --> 01:01:21,216
<i>Who set off the bombs in Changri-dong?</i>

842
01:01:21,299 --> 01:01:23,760
<i>That's none of your business.</i>

843
01:01:23,843 --> 01:01:25,679
<i>Get a bomb ready.</i>

844
01:01:25,762 --> 01:01:27,180
To blow up Kiyun-si.

845
01:01:27,263 --> 01:01:28,598
What are you doing? Run!

846
01:01:28,682 --> 01:01:29,516
No...

847
01:01:32,644 --> 01:01:34,646
