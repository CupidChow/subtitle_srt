00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:38,956
HEROES NEXT DOOR

2
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:42,960
THIS DRAMA IS A WORK OF FICTION.
ALL CHARACTERS, PROFESSIONS, PLACES,

3
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:43,961
COMPANIES, ORGANIZATIONS,
ETHNIC GROUPS AND EVENTS ARE NOT REAL.

4
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:44,962
ALL CHILD AND ANIMAL SCENES WERE FILMED
SAFELY UNDER EXPERT SUPERVISION.

5
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:49,925
WELCOME TO CHANGRI-DONG

6
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:56,473
So this is like an EMP device?

7
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:57,516
Exactly.

8
00:00:57,599 --> 00:01:00,143
So when I turn this on,

9
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:01,687
pull the lever,

10
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,188
and press the button,

11
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:04,815
it'll cause a blackout.

12
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:07,776
All electronics nearby will be turned off.

13
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:10,612
- All phones and computers, too?
- Of course.

14
00:01:11,113 --> 00:01:13,156
But how do you know that it really works?

15
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:16,159
Well,

16
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:19,746
you know the recent blackout?

17
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:21,290
- You're kidding.
- No way.

18
00:01:21,373 --> 00:01:23,333
Why, you...

19
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:26,461
That blackout turned off
all the fridges at my store!

20
00:01:26,545 --> 00:01:29,381
- All the meat and ice cream...
- Sorry, calm down.

21
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:31,008
- Seriously...
- Calm down, okay?

22
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:32,884
I'm just saying,

23
00:01:32,968 --> 00:01:36,013
there's nothing to worry about
because it works.

24
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:37,931
This is our silver lining, okay?

25
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:39,474
Just shut your mouth.

26
00:01:39,558 --> 00:01:41,977
So we'll use this
to shut down the base stations

27
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,770
and block off all signals?

28
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:47,274
- Exactly.
- Great idea. That's the surest way.

29
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:50,068
Right. We'll block the bombs
from going off at all.

30
00:01:50,152 --> 00:01:53,155
Even if Sullivan
tries to set the bombs off,

31
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:55,866
none will go off without the signal.

32
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:58,076
How many base stations
do we have in our town?

33
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,536
Changri-dong has three.

34
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,371
Is this enough to cover all three?

35
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:05,042
No, I'd need two more, then.

36
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:06,293
Hey,

37
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:07,753
go visit Ms. Lee.

38
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:09,713
- Ms. Lee?
- Yeah. Hey--

39
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,882
She should be at the bunker.
Why's he in such a hurry?

40
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:13,508
Make sure to get them from her!

41
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:15,052
We only have one right now.

42
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:17,304
That's not good. We need two.

43
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:18,597
I'll try to get another one.

44
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,765
Let me know when you do.

45
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,560
- Take it. It's fine.
- I'm okay.

46
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:24,811
It's Yong-hui! Yong--

47
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:29,107
Do you sell those at your store?

48
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:30,776
My store basically has everything.

49
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:32,235
If we don't, I'll get it somehow.

50
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,153
What is it?

51
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:35,030
Do you sell EMPs, too?

52
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:36,448
EM...

53
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:38,033
Is that a soda?

54
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:39,493
Who's the manufacturer?

55
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:45,207
Do you mean an electromagnetic pulse?

56
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:47,793
Yeah.

57
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:50,962
Do you happen to have one?

58
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:52,005
Yeah, I do.

59
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:54,966
My gosh.

60
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,677
Do you? Where is it?

61
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,929
Back at our lab.

62
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:09,523
This is a prototype jamming device
in development.

63
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:11,692
Now's not the time for jam!

64
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:15,612
No, a jamming device
disrupts radio frequencies.

65
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:16,613
So this--

66
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:18,865
You're saying this works, right?

67
00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:20,450
Yes.

68
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:23,078
How much is it?

69
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:25,789
Oh, come on.
Neighbors should just help each other out.

70
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:27,708
That's how we bond.

71
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,585
Really? My gosh!

72
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:32,421
You're basically Korean now.

73
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:34,089
Hey, call me by my name from now on.

74
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:35,424
You're one of us now.

75
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:38,301
I'll make sure
to treat you big time, okay?

76
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:39,469
Su-il.

77
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:42,264
Could you promise me

78
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:46,643
to get revenge on the guys
who killed my friend, Rashid?

79
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,520
Please do this for me.

80
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:50,313
Ali.

81
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:51,940
Don't worry about it.

82
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:53,358
I got you, all right?

83
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:54,609
Bye.

84
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:57,404
I'll be counting on you!

85
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,868
I knew you wouldn't let me down.

86
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:05,120
Let's see.

87
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,581
Let's take one each,

88
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,416
check the base stations,

89
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:10,917
and set them off from below.

90
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:12,627
I'll go to the shopping centers.

91
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:13,754
You go to Changri 3-dong.

92
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:16,298
Jeong-hwan, please handle the relay tower.

93
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:17,215
Okay.

94
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:21,762
Good luck, everyone.

95
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,346
Honey.

96
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:24,473
Hold on.

97
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:26,767
Don't worry about Min-seo.

98
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:29,436
No, it's not that.

99
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:32,105
We need you to do something.

100
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:34,149
Me?

101
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:38,487
Hey, what's up?

102
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:40,572
What?

103
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:43,033
Well...

104
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:45,660
If that's the case, of course I'll go.

105
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:48,163
Chun-bae, we need to do this.

106
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:50,207
<i>We're the only ones who can.</i>

107
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,626
I know what you mean.

108
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:56,630
I'm just worried
that something might happen.

109
00:04:56,922 --> 00:04:58,757
Hui-ja will be by herself.

110
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,093
<i>All right, just give me a moment.</i>

111
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:16,775
I'm back.

112
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:18,819
Min-seo.

113
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:22,656
You haven't eaten yet, right?

114
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:31,706
Are you going somewhere?

115
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:34,876
Yeah, Su-il needs me
to go somewhere with him.

116
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:37,462
Let's head home early today.

117
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:38,922
I'll be back later.

118
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:40,340
Is Su-il okay?

119
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:43,760
Oh, of course. He's fine.

120
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,888
- Hello.
- Hey, Min-seo.

121
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:48,181
Hi, Min-seo.

122
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:50,809
Dad told me
to have dinner with Auntie Hui-ja.

123
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:53,436
Don't worry about her. You should go.

124
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,814
Oh, sure.

125
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:57,983
Sure, I'll cook you a feast.

126
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,735
Can I have dinner
and play a game with her?

127
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:02,487
I brought a board game.

128
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:03,947
Of course!

129
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,157
Hui-ja is great at games.

130
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:08,952
Don't let Min-seo beat you, okay?

131
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:10,453
You'd better be ready.

132
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:20,088
Then I'll see you later.

133
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:21,506
- See you.
- Okay.

134
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:41,776
What is it?

135
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:46,281
Don't worry about me. Just go.

136
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:50,285
Your face tells me
something is going on around the town.

137
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:51,620
No, it's nothing--

138
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:53,079
Chun-bae.

139
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:59,961
I know I'm unwell, too.

140
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:03,590
I'll have dinner with Min-seo

141
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:05,675
and make sure to take my meds.

142
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:08,595
So don't worry. Just go.

143
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:13,683
Don't get hurt.

144
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:17,646
I'll be right back.

145
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:22,984
Go on.

146
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:12,427
Thank you for your service.

147
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:33,198
Do-yeon...

148
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,661
Do-yeon!

149
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:54,010
Do-yeon...

150
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,818
- Dad,
- Yeah?

151
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:12,362
if I meet a bad adult,
I'll scare them with my whistle.

152
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:15,365
Yes, make their ears bleed.

153
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:16,282
Okay.

154
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,001
Do-yeon...

155
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:29,587
Do-yeon!

156
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:32,006
Do-yeon!

157
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:23,516
Hey.

158
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,601
Why are you here?

159
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:26,311
Why else? To help you.

160
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:28,354
Sorry we scared you.

161
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:30,565
I was a sniper
in the Ninth Infantry Division.

162
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:33,610
I could even shoot
the butthole of a bird in flight.

163
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,820
- What?
- This is from Byeong-nam.

164
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:37,405
- Yeah.
- Oh, okay.

165
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:40,491
Now, take off your jacket.

166
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:42,327
- Here, let me.
- Take it off.

167
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:44,412
- Here you go.
- All right.

168
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,373
So where's Do-yeon?

169
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:49,292
Somewhere in this building.

170
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:51,377
<i>Stay here for now.</i>

171
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:52,712
<i>I'll take it from here.</i>

172
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:54,797
We have Kang on the line now.

173
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:56,299
Everyone can hear me, right?

174
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:57,634
<i>Yeah.</i>

175
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:02,430
Hey, Kang.

176
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:03,389
Are you okay?

177
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:05,892
<i>Yeah, I'm heading in now.</i>

178
00:12:27,956 --> 00:12:30,959
I'll be taking central control now.

179
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:34,671
Watch your head.

180
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:38,508
Wait.

181
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:47,016
I gave you all my energy.

182
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,393
No bullets can get you.

183
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:50,853
Thank you.

184
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:51,896
Okay.

185
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,439
Please stay here until I signal you.

186
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:54,565
Got it.

187
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:56,651
All right.

188
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:08,454
Who is Kang, seriously?

189
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:09,497
Isn't it obvious?

190
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,124
He's Changri-dong's hero.

191
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:48,596
<i>How are things on your end, Byeong-nam?</i>

192
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,139
All ready.

193
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:57,772
I've just arrived.

194
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:00,358
Let me know as soon as you're ready.

195
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:01,275
<i>Okay.</i>

196
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:08,991
I'm at the Han Building's data center.

197
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,121
<i>Good work, Nam-yeon.</i>

198
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,790
By the way, Yong-hui.

199
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:21,254
Couldn't you have done this
by hacking into the system?

200
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:25,174
We have the best chance
of succeeding this way.

201
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:26,467
<i>Fine.</i>

202
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:06,544
Do-yeon.

203
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,198
The site is clear.

204
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:37,825
Moving underground.

205
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:45,750
Kang is in the building.

206
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:49,920
All communications will be blocked
once the EMPs go off,

207
00:18:50,004 --> 00:18:52,798
so make sure to send the signal right away
when you've succeeded.

208
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:54,925
Please get everything ready and stand by.

209
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:56,677
- Got it.
- Okay.

210
00:19:02,183 --> 00:19:03,351
I can do it.

211
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:47,937
Do-yeon!

212
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:51,357
Dad!

213
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:55,444
Do-yeon!

214
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:59,240
Are you okay, Do-yeon?

215
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:02,576
Yeah, we had fun drawing pictures.

216
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:04,578
You had fun?

217
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:05,496
Yeah.

218
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:21,512
Retrieve the bombs.

219
00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:23,639
You still have time.

220
00:20:26,976 --> 00:20:28,269
Will people remember Charlotte

221
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:32,440
if I just stop here?

222
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:36,318
The kids and their families
with your bombs...

223
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:38,195
They're just innocent people.

224
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:43,868
Innocent?

225
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:59,216
Had a single soul spoken up

226
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:01,802
<i>about the trial being rigged,</i>

227
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:05,890
<i>we wouldn't have ended up this way.</i>

228
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:07,141
My gosh...

229
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:09,351
<i>Everyone in Korea is at fault.</i>

230
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:11,896
<i>That's why I'm doing this.</i>

231
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:14,064
<i>So that everyone will remember today</i>

232
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:16,901
<i>in piles of ashes.</i>

233
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:22,573
You think

234
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:24,742
Charlotte would be happy

235
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:27,203
if you killed everyone for revenge?

236
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,141
Do-yeon.

237
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:55,272
Could you give

238
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:57,900
the phone to Daddy?

239
00:22:02,363 --> 00:22:03,280
Here.

240
00:22:13,624 --> 00:22:17,002
If you press that, Do-yeon will live,

241
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:18,796
but all your neighbors will die.

242
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:20,714
If you don't press it,

243
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:25,302
Do-yeon will die.

244
00:22:35,104 --> 00:22:36,814
Let's get started!

245
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:38,774
Everyone ready?

246
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:40,442
Ready.

247
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:42,361
Me too.

248
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:47,867
Please help us.

249
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:54,123
You can choose to save Do-yeon

250
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:59,545
or your neighbors,
whom you claim are innocent.

251
00:23:03,966 --> 00:23:04,967
Okay.

252
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:07,428
Please, let's get this done in one go

253
00:23:08,262 --> 00:23:09,597
without mistakes.

254
00:23:10,306 --> 00:23:11,140
<i>One,</i>

255
00:23:12,266 --> 00:23:13,100
<i>two,</i>

256
00:23:14,852 --> 00:23:15,686
three!

257
00:23:58,812 --> 00:23:59,688
It worked.

258
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:46,944
Why didn't it go off there?

259
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:49,113
Nam-yeon.

260
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:50,531
Nam-yeon!

261
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:53,867
What's going on, Nam-yeon?

262
00:24:58,664 --> 00:24:59,540
What the...

263
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:01,375
Nam-yeon's station hasn't gone off!

264
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:03,210
Nam-yeon?

265
00:25:06,714 --> 00:25:08,632
Yong-hui, this isn't working!

266
00:25:08,716 --> 00:25:09,967
What?

267
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:13,012
SAFE GAS STATION

268
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:22,938
Do you see electrical wires
connected to the equipment?

269
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:24,773
They should be tied as one.

270
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,276
Are you kidding me...

271
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:33,949
Yeah, I found it!

272
00:25:34,283 --> 00:25:35,534
Then...

273
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:36,910
Just cut that off!

274
00:25:44,418 --> 00:25:45,627
Make up your mind.

275
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:54,428
Cut it off!

276
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:55,554
Just cut it!

277
00:25:55,846 --> 00:25:57,598
Just chop it off, Nam-yeon!

278
00:25:58,015 --> 00:25:59,099
Cut it!

279
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:41,809
Ms. Lee!

280
00:26:56,657 --> 00:26:58,700
How dare you, huh?

281
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:41,660
Press the damn button!

282
00:27:55,424 --> 00:27:56,550
I trust them.

283
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:08,896
We'll do everything to stop the bombs.

284
00:28:09,146 --> 00:28:12,232
So you just focus
on bringing Do-yeon back.

285
00:28:13,609 --> 00:28:14,443
I...

286
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,946
choose Do-yeon.

287
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,528
We did it!

288
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:07,371
We did it.

289
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:09,790
Fireworks.

290
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:12,834
Fireworks! They went off!

291
00:29:12,918 --> 00:29:14,336
It's over!

292
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:16,922
We did it! Yes!

293
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:19,758
We did it!

294
00:29:21,635 --> 00:29:24,429
A win for the Heroes Next Door!

295
00:29:31,687 --> 00:29:33,438
Yes!

296
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:35,274
We did it! Amazing!

297
00:30:47,596 --> 00:30:48,430
It's okay.

298
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:50,599
It's okay.

299
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:52,768
- Daddy's here.
- I'm scared!

300
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:54,603
It's okay.

301
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:09,826
Do-yeon.

302
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:18,001
Goodbye.

303
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:29,471
Do-yeon.

304
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:31,014
Go upstairs,

305
00:31:31,098 --> 00:31:33,725
and you'll see the uncles
from the store and the laundry place.

306
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:36,812
Go ahead and wait. I'll be there soon.

307
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:39,898
No, come with me.

308
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,442
I'll be there soon.

309
00:31:42,526 --> 00:31:43,402
Go ahead.

310
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:45,445
Okay? Good girl.

311
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:49,574
Don't take too long.

312
00:31:49,658 --> 00:31:50,492
Okay.

313
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,161
All right, go on.

314
00:32:08,218 --> 00:32:09,803
- Do-yeon!
- Mr. Kim!

315
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:11,721
Do-yeon! My gosh!

316
00:32:11,805 --> 00:32:13,598
What about my dad?

317
00:32:13,682 --> 00:32:15,267
He'll be fine.

318
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,268
Here.

319
00:32:16,977 --> 00:32:18,437
- Sit right here.
- Daddy!

320
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,604
It's okay.

321
00:33:19,623 --> 00:33:21,416
I just wanted people to remember

322
00:33:22,876 --> 00:33:24,878
how unfair Charlotte's death was.

323
00:33:29,925 --> 00:33:30,842
I thought

324
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:34,554
you'd understand me.

325
00:33:36,306 --> 00:33:37,724
You would've done the same

326
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,895
if it were Do-yeon, wouldn't you?

327
00:33:49,528 --> 00:33:50,904
My daughter died,

328
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:53,406
but the world hasn't changed.

329
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,576
I just wanted to make sure

330
00:33:57,994 --> 00:34:00,580
that nobody would face
such undeserved grief again.

331
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:02,290
But...

332
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:05,585
you stopped me!

333
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:10,465
Seriously, man.

334
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:13,677
You sure yap a lot.

335
00:34:17,931 --> 00:34:19,474
Cut the crap.

336
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:22,686
This is

337
00:34:24,563 --> 00:34:26,356
for kidnapping Do-yeon,

338
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:29,776
turning my town into a mess,

339
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:35,490
and killing Myeong-o,
who didn't deserve to die.

340
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:47,168
What about my little girl?

341
00:34:48,712 --> 00:34:50,839
What about Charlotte,
who did nothing wrong?

342
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:56,344
You're still talking?

343
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:02,559
Hey.

344
00:35:03,852 --> 00:35:06,313
You were the one who ruined your chance

345
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:08,857
to honor the memory of Charlotte.

346
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:13,278
You're just...

347
00:35:14,696 --> 00:35:18,783
a deranged terrorist.

348
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:23,622
Got that, you lunatic?

349
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:56,988
Is Charlotte in heaven, then?

350
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:14,506
Mr. Sullivan.

351
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:18,843
This is Pinky, and I really like her.

352
00:36:19,761 --> 00:36:20,595
But...

353
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,682
you can have her.

354
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:29,437
Because Charlotte also loved bunnies.

355
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:35,402
Pinky will make you feel better
whenever you miss Charlotte.

356
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:38,363
Here.

357
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:42,992
It even lights up
to make you feel safe at night.

358
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:47,664
Pinky will...

359
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:48,915
No.

360
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:52,085
Charlotte will always be by your side.

361
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:04,764
Thank you.

362
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:00,028
It's all over now.

363
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:01,613
<i>What about Sullivan?</i>

364
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:05,784
He's on the underground level
of the Novus Warehouse.

365
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:09,662
Good work.

366
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:12,749
We'll take care of the rest.

367
00:38:18,171 --> 00:38:19,506
Daddy!

368
00:38:20,924 --> 00:38:22,342
- Hey.
- Kang!

369
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:26,095
Kang!

370
00:38:27,764 --> 00:38:29,015
Are you okay?

371
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:30,058
- I'm okay.
- Kang!

372
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:32,894
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

373
00:38:33,228 --> 00:38:34,479
Need me to wrap things up?

374
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:36,773
- Let's go.
- Yeah?

375
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:38,483
- Good job.
- Gosh, good work.

376
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,415
Sit tight, okay?

377
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:42,046
Thank you.

378
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:43,381
Should I drive?

379
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:44,716
No, I can drive.

380
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:46,926
What? You'll drive?

381
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:48,761
Yeah, I'm fine.

382
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:09,240
FIFTH EXPLOSION
ON SEPT 18, 2025 AT 00:00 A.M.

383
00:40:09,324 --> 00:40:12,619
THE ANNIVERSARY OF CHARLOTTE'S DEATH

384
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:33,681
What?

385
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,106
Is everyone okay?

386
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:43,858
- Kang, are you okay?
- Kang!

387
00:40:43,942 --> 00:40:45,234
- Are you okay?
- Guys!

388
00:40:45,318 --> 00:40:46,444
I'm fine.

389
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:47,612
Are you all right?

390
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:49,113
- Good job.
- Are you okay?

391
00:40:49,197 --> 00:40:50,573
- Yeah.
- Good job.

392
00:40:50,657 --> 00:40:51,866
- My gosh.
- Good work!

393
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:53,117
- I'm so glad.
- Gosh.

394
00:40:53,201 --> 00:40:54,452
- Good job, all of you.
- You, too.

395
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:55,787
- Good job.
- You were great.

396
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:57,664
- Did you get hurt?
- No, I'm fine.

397
00:40:57,747 --> 00:40:59,332
- I told you we were fine.
- Really?

398
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:22,021
Mommy...

399
00:41:25,942 --> 00:41:27,735
Don't cry, Mommy.

400
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:15,241
What are you doing out in the cold?

401
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:17,827
I was waiting for you.

402
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:18,786
Oh, my.

403
00:42:19,412 --> 00:42:20,788
Your hands are frozen!

404
00:42:20,872 --> 00:42:23,249
Let's head inside already.

405
00:42:27,754 --> 00:42:28,755
Are you sleepy?

406
00:42:28,838 --> 00:42:29,672
Yeah.

407
00:42:31,466 --> 00:42:33,051
- Mom.
- Yeah?

408
00:42:33,134 --> 00:42:35,762
Remember how you promised
to buy me sneakers?

409
00:42:35,845 --> 00:42:38,306
Yeah, those sneakers. What about them?

410
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:41,059
Can you sign me up
for martial arts classes instead?

411
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:43,936
Why? Is someone bullying you?

412
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:46,105
Who is it? Who's bullying you?

413
00:42:46,189 --> 00:42:47,523
Take me to their house.

414
00:42:47,607 --> 00:42:49,317
- Who dares...
- It's nothing like that.

415
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,818
- What?
- Huh?

416
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:53,738
You're going to become like Mom
if you learn martial arts.

417
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:55,948
That's nonsense. Why, then?

418
00:42:56,032 --> 00:42:57,325
- You hate exercising.
- I'm doomed.

419
00:42:57,408 --> 00:42:59,327
- Stop it.
- Don't fight people.

420
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:00,995
We'll take care of it for you.

421
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:04,040
Goodness.

422
00:43:15,927 --> 00:43:18,137
I'm glad that everyone is fine.

423
00:43:20,765 --> 00:43:21,808
- Byeong-nam!
- Byeong-nam!

424
00:43:21,891 --> 00:43:22,850
Emergency!

425
00:43:22,934 --> 00:43:24,143
What is it now?

426
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:25,561
I'm hungry.

427
00:43:25,645 --> 00:43:26,479
You little...

428
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:28,147
- Me too.
- You're kidding me!

429
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:32,276
You scared me, you little punks!

430
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:34,821
Okay, then.

431
00:43:35,655 --> 00:43:37,365
How about some instant noodles
and some rice wine?

432
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:38,783
Yes! INRW it is!

433
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:39,909
All right. Wait, what?

434
00:43:39,992 --> 00:43:41,869
Some INRW coming right up!

435
00:43:42,829 --> 00:43:43,788
Hey.

436
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:46,165
I said instant noodles and rice wine.

437
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:49,085
Okay? What even is INRW?

438
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:53,589
<i>Around 12 a.m. last night,</i>

439
00:43:53,673 --> 00:43:58,344
<i>a warehouse near the Hanbal Mountain</i>
<i>in Kiyun-si exploded,</i>

440
00:43:58,427 --> 00:44:02,348
<i>damaging the walls and the pillars</i>
<i>of two factory buildings.</i>

441
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:05,685
<i>The fire department reported</i>
<i>that no one was injured or killed,</i>

442
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:08,271
<i>and found that the explosion occurred</i>

443
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:10,273
<i>at the helium gas tank in the warehouse.</i>

444
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:12,608
<i>The investigation into</i>
<i>the exact cause is still ongoing.</i>

445
00:44:14,402 --> 00:44:17,113
HARDWARE DREAM TREE STATIONERY

446
00:44:22,952 --> 00:44:24,370
Is the wind too weak?

447
00:44:25,121 --> 00:44:26,789
Let's try again.

448
00:44:28,958 --> 00:44:30,418
- That's nice and cool.
- Hey.

449
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:31,335
Hey.

450
00:44:31,419 --> 00:44:32,253
All right.

451
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:35,464
- What are you doing?
- Perfect.

452
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:37,216
You do daytime rounds, too?

453
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:38,426
What? No.

454
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:43,181
Hey, what do you think of my new
hot-cooling protective vest?

455
00:44:43,598 --> 00:44:44,765
- "Hot-cooling"?
- Yeah.

456
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,059
So is it heating or cooling?

457
00:44:47,143 --> 00:44:48,269
Come on.

458
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:50,771
It's both heating and cooling.

459
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:54,275
Most functional vests
can only do one or the other.

460
00:44:54,567 --> 00:44:57,486
But this can keep you both warm and cool.

461
00:44:57,737 --> 00:44:59,030
This is the heating pad,

462
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:00,740
and these are the cooling fans.

463
00:45:01,741 --> 00:45:03,659
And check this out.

464
00:45:06,037 --> 00:45:09,290
Chun-bae did the lettering himself.

465
00:45:09,624 --> 00:45:11,792
I know it sounds lame,

466
00:45:11,876 --> 00:45:14,170
but apparently
Su-il really pushed for this.

467
00:45:14,253 --> 00:45:15,171
What do you think?

468
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:19,133
Everyone in this neighborhood is so weird.

469
00:45:20,343 --> 00:45:23,012
Hey, you know your neighbors.

470
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:25,014
If we're doing something,
we always do it right.

471
00:45:25,932 --> 00:45:27,516
I did something right too.

472
00:45:28,476 --> 00:45:29,310
What?

473
00:45:30,228 --> 00:45:31,479
I didn't kill anyone.

474
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:36,400
Look at you.

475
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:40,738
All right. You're the next president
of the youth association.

476
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:43,366
What are you talking about?

477
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:47,245
You can be the president forever,
little bro.

478
00:45:47,453 --> 00:45:50,498
Why? Are you planning to move?

479
00:45:52,959 --> 00:45:54,001
I'll be something else.

480
00:45:54,543 --> 00:45:55,378
What?

481
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:57,171
The neighborhood watch leader.

482
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:03,928
I SHALL REVEAL THE TRUTH
AND BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE

483
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:05,429
Recently,

484
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:10,476
a young man from Kiyun-si
died an undeserving death.

485
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:13,229
But that wasn't just an accident.

486
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:15,523
This case concerned the corruption

487
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:17,942
of the Minister of National Defense.

488
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:23,030
This is incredibly disheartening.

489
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:25,825
Today,

490
00:46:27,201 --> 00:46:30,538
I will take responsibility
for failing to uncover the truth

491
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:33,416
behind the unfortunate incident
in Kiyun-si

492
00:46:34,709 --> 00:46:38,671
and step down from the National Assembly.

493
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:01,277
KIM SEOK-JUN

494
00:47:02,153 --> 00:47:02,987
<i>Hello?</i>

495
00:47:03,571 --> 00:47:06,574
<i>How did you manage to get out?</i>

496
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:09,577
Come on, I'm Kim Seok-jun.

497
00:47:12,204 --> 00:47:16,167
I see that you've sold my name on TV.

498
00:47:16,417 --> 00:47:18,085
Sell your name?

499
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:20,087
I was just telling the truth!

500
00:47:20,171 --> 00:47:21,005
<i>Hey.</i>

501
00:47:22,048 --> 00:47:23,424
<i>Bring me my money.</i>

502
00:47:25,468 --> 00:47:27,136
Do I owe you money?

503
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:29,347
I'll get straight to the point.

504
00:47:30,473 --> 00:47:32,058
Just listen to this.

505
00:47:35,936 --> 00:47:37,772
<i>How much do you trust me?</i>

506
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:40,983
<i>Get a bomb ready.</i>

507
00:47:42,443 --> 00:47:43,986
<i>To blow up Kiyun-si.</i>

508
00:47:55,039 --> 00:47:57,666
Buy my land in Kiyun-si.

509
00:47:58,042 --> 00:47:59,835
<i>With cash by tonight.</i>

510
00:47:59,919 --> 00:48:02,546
<i>Or I'll send this</i>
<i>straight to the news channels.</i>

511
00:48:02,963 --> 00:48:06,467
Oh, should I send it
to the Prosecutor's Office, too?

512
00:48:06,842 --> 00:48:08,511
Do you realize how much money that is?

513
00:48:08,844 --> 00:48:11,138
How can I get all that cash within a day?

514
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:14,725
<i>I don't know. That's none of my business.</i>

515
00:48:15,101 --> 00:48:17,103
Why are you asking me that?

516
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:20,314
You have until tonight, okay?

517
00:48:20,523 --> 00:48:23,901
Get me the money in US dollars.

518
00:48:24,819 --> 00:48:26,654
I'll send you the location.

519
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:28,739
- See you there.
<i>- Hey, Seok-jun--</i>

520
00:48:29,115 --> 00:48:31,867
You crazy bastard! Hey!

521
00:48:38,833 --> 00:48:40,209
You wanted to make a deal.

522
00:48:41,419 --> 00:48:42,795
Do something about this.

523
00:49:03,482 --> 00:49:05,109
Well, hello.

524
00:49:06,569 --> 00:49:08,237
Ms. Na!

525
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:11,073
Don't act like we're friends.

526
00:49:11,449 --> 00:49:12,741
Hand over the original recording.

527
00:49:13,033 --> 00:49:13,868
All right.

528
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:16,579
Ta-da!

529
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:20,875
Stop trying to play tricks.

530
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:22,376
Bring me the money.

531
00:49:24,503 --> 00:49:26,630
You never change, do you?

532
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:29,925
So consistently trashy.

533
00:49:31,051 --> 00:49:32,094
Right back at you.

534
00:49:49,778 --> 00:49:50,654
Open it.

535
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:00,289
Bring it over.

536
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:09,131
Give me the original recording.

537
00:50:13,177 --> 00:50:14,803
Yeah, sure.

538
00:50:16,722 --> 00:50:19,308
The original file is in here.

539
00:50:19,391 --> 00:50:20,601
Take the whole thing.

540
00:50:22,353 --> 00:50:23,729
Now hand over the money!

541
00:50:36,575 --> 00:50:37,493
Ms. Na,

542
00:50:38,994 --> 00:50:40,746
good luck in your future endeavors.

543
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:08,816
It's all over now, Mr. Kim.

544
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:14,822
Lee Geun-cheol, you little rat!

545
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:18,450
Hey! Stop it!

546
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:20,202
You've been...

547
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:22,162
dismissed from office.

548
00:51:23,122 --> 00:51:25,124
The President approved
the motion to dismiss you.

549
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:26,917
We got your arrest warrant, too.

550
00:51:28,002 --> 00:51:30,087
Fine, just let go of me.

551
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:31,297
Let go!

552
00:51:33,382 --> 00:51:36,343
Wait just a damn minute.

553
00:51:36,719 --> 00:51:38,721
I just...

554
00:51:39,263 --> 00:51:41,932
What do I do?

555
00:51:42,016 --> 00:51:44,768
Hey, you guys!

556
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:46,854
I'll pay you guys.

557
00:51:47,479 --> 00:51:49,898
Let me go, please?

558
00:51:49,982 --> 00:51:52,526
Take this money and let me go.

559
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:54,862
Here, take it all!

560
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:56,864
I'll pay you.

561
00:51:56,947 --> 00:51:58,115
- Arrest him.
- Yes, sir.

562
00:51:58,198 --> 00:52:01,702
No, don't do that!

563
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:07,124
I dedicated my entire life
to this country!

564
00:52:07,207 --> 00:52:09,793
How dare you treat me like this?

565
00:52:10,085 --> 00:52:11,837
So what if I sold a few weapons?

566
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:15,007
Can't I do that much as the Minister?

567
00:52:15,841 --> 00:52:17,468
Let go!

568
00:52:39,615 --> 00:52:42,951
I took the blame
and took care of everything.

569
00:52:43,952 --> 00:52:45,954
So speed up the bill
for the IT specialized zone, okay?

570
00:52:46,914 --> 00:52:49,500
You know I stepped down
just for that, right?

571
00:52:54,046 --> 00:52:58,133
I'm not greedy for power.

572
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:02,680
You know what? Just tell me.

573
00:53:02,763 --> 00:53:03,639
When?

574
00:53:10,562 --> 00:53:13,732
Isn't that too soon?

575
00:53:18,070 --> 00:53:20,948
Let's talk again after this year.

576
00:53:22,825 --> 00:53:24,284
Okay, Mr. Kwon.

577
00:53:36,839 --> 00:53:42,803

<i>In memory of Charlotte,</i>
<i>who died in an unfortunate accident</i>

580
00:54:20,966 --> 00:54:22,259
<i>three years ago.</i>

581
00:54:48,744 --> 00:54:50,996
- My goodness!
- Grandma!

582
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:53,624
- There's my girl.
- Yeah.

583
00:54:53,707 --> 00:54:56,251
- Hello.
- Hey.

584
00:54:56,335 --> 00:54:58,045
Mom, why did you want to meet here?

585
00:54:58,128 --> 00:55:02,508
I heard my little Do-yeon
wanted to learn how to ride a bike.

586
00:55:02,591 --> 00:55:03,550
Do-yeon.

587
00:55:04,343 --> 00:55:06,720
Look around.

588
00:55:06,804 --> 00:55:07,638
What do you think?

589
00:55:08,263 --> 00:55:09,848
- It's so cool!
- You think so?

590
00:55:09,932 --> 00:55:12,518
- There are so many bikes!
- Right?

591
00:55:13,101 --> 00:55:14,478
There's even more inside.

592
00:55:14,770 --> 00:55:15,896
- Really?
- Yeah.

593
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:19,107
Daddy and I went on a date here once.

594
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:21,819
A date?

595
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:23,654
You must've held hands and kissed, too!

596
00:55:23,737 --> 00:55:24,822
Oh, my.

597
00:55:24,905 --> 00:55:27,157
Hey, we had to do all that to have...

598
00:55:27,574 --> 00:55:28,867
Oh, my!

599
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:30,327
Bye!

600
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:32,621
Wait for us, Do-yeon.

601
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:34,665
- Where are you going?
- My goodness.

602
00:55:34,748 --> 00:55:36,375
- Wait for me!
- Let's go.

603
00:55:36,458 --> 00:55:38,168
THE NOSTALGIC FIRST TRICYCLE OF MY LIFE
Look at that, Do-yeon.

604
00:55:38,836 --> 00:55:40,963
I also rode a tricycle as a baby.

605
00:55:41,964 --> 00:55:43,465
Grandma got that for you.

606
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:46,552
- Really?
- Of course.

607
00:55:47,970 --> 00:55:51,265
By the way,
why are there so many bikes here?

608
00:55:54,852 --> 00:55:58,021
There are all sorts of bikes,
from cool ones to old ones.

609
00:55:58,564 --> 00:56:00,649
Looking at bikes
makes me want to ride one.

610
00:56:00,732 --> 00:56:02,401
Are you good at riding one?

611
00:56:02,484 --> 00:56:03,360
Of course.

612
00:56:03,443 --> 00:56:04,736
When I was your age,

613
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:07,030
I went around my whole town on my bike.

614
00:56:07,114 --> 00:56:08,448
I want to ride a bike, too, then!

615
00:56:08,532 --> 00:56:09,783
I want to be like you.

616
00:56:09,867 --> 00:56:11,201
Let's ride one together.

617
00:56:11,285 --> 00:56:12,160
Okay!

618
00:56:15,455 --> 00:56:17,457
Yes, you're doing great.

619
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:20,919
- What do I do?
- Keep pedaling. Right on!

620
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:25,716
I'm letting go now!

621
00:56:27,426 --> 00:56:28,552
My goodness.

622
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:31,513
I can see hearts
shooting out of Kang's eyes.

623
00:56:32,264 --> 00:56:33,557
Don't even get me started.

624
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:35,392
He's all about Do-yeon all day, every day.

625
00:56:35,893 --> 00:56:37,227
He's not just a sucker for Do-yeon.

626
00:56:37,311 --> 00:56:39,605
Sometimes, he just sucks.

627
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:41,481
My gosh.

628
00:56:42,107 --> 00:56:43,692
- Am I good?
- Yes.

629
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:45,152
Be careful.

630
00:56:45,777 --> 00:56:47,487
- Okay.
- If you're lonely,

631
00:56:47,571 --> 00:56:50,157
have a son who will look for you more.

632
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:53,410
Mom, I do have a son, remember?

633
00:56:54,036 --> 00:56:56,330
Over there. That huge boy is my son.

634
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:57,748
Mom!

635
00:57:07,758 --> 00:57:10,010
Dad, this is so much fun.

636
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:12,262
- Let's come back again, okay?
- Yeah!

637
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:14,806
Honey, I'm having so much fun, too.

638
00:57:14,890 --> 00:57:16,642
Let's come back again, okay?

639
00:57:16,725 --> 00:57:19,144
Okay, let's come back.

640
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:22,397
Go faster, Dad!

641
00:57:22,481 --> 00:57:24,566
Ladies, are you wearing your seat belts?

642
00:57:24,650 --> 00:57:25,943
- Yes!
- Yes!

643
00:57:26,026 --> 00:57:27,778
Let's go for it!

644
00:57:27,861 --> 00:57:29,488
Here we go, then!

645
00:57:55,847 --> 00:57:57,516
Our Do-yeon is all grown.

646
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:58,976
She can even ride a bike now.

647
00:58:00,519 --> 00:58:02,646
She's very athletic
because she takes after me.

648
00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:09,194
I'm so glad we came.

649
00:58:09,277 --> 00:58:10,112
Yeah.

650
00:58:10,278 --> 00:58:12,531
She seems to have forgotten
all about what happened.

651
00:58:12,948 --> 00:58:14,241
Again, she takes after me.

652
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:15,617
She's simple.

653
00:58:15,701 --> 00:58:16,743
It's a good thing.

654
00:58:16,827 --> 00:58:19,413
Sure, she takes after you in everything!

655
00:58:22,708 --> 00:58:23,709
Once we get home,

656
00:58:23,792 --> 00:58:26,211
let's invite all our neighbors
for a housewarming party.

657
00:58:26,294 --> 00:58:29,798
I haven't properly thanked everyone
for taking care of Do-yeon yet.

658
00:58:31,299 --> 00:58:32,217
It's a plan.

659
00:58:35,554 --> 00:58:36,763
Get some sleep.

660
00:58:37,681 --> 00:58:40,183
No, you must be tired too.

661
00:58:46,606 --> 00:58:49,484
MAMMOSEU MART

662
00:58:51,194 --> 00:58:52,404
I'll take these.

663
00:58:52,904 --> 00:58:54,072
Okay.

664
00:58:55,824 --> 00:58:58,160
Do you cook in your lab, too?

665
00:58:58,243 --> 00:59:00,704
No, I cook at home.

666
00:59:02,039 --> 00:59:04,332
All you ate were instant noodles,
but you cook now.

667
00:59:05,709 --> 00:59:07,335
What was your membership number?

668
00:59:07,419 --> 00:59:10,130
- It's 2406.
- All right.

669
00:59:10,797 --> 00:59:12,007
You're a diamond customer.

670
00:59:13,508 --> 00:59:14,384
All right.

671
00:59:20,223 --> 00:59:21,224
Here you go.

672
00:59:24,978 --> 00:59:26,104
Su-il.

673
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:27,898
POINTS EARNED: 100,000 WON
What's this?

674
00:59:29,066 --> 00:59:31,818
I told you I'd treat you big time.

675
00:59:31,902 --> 00:59:33,195
This is like cash.

676
00:59:33,278 --> 00:59:34,571
- What? Really?
- Yeah.

677
00:59:34,654 --> 00:59:36,907
Use the points when I'm here, okay?

678
00:59:37,908 --> 00:59:39,618
Thanks, Su-il.

679
00:59:41,161 --> 00:59:43,705
- But when my wife--
- Wow, 100,000 points?

680
00:59:48,043 --> 00:59:49,294
Honey...

681
00:59:50,629 --> 00:59:51,797
Good job.

682
00:59:53,715 --> 00:59:55,133
I did a good job?

683
00:59:55,217 --> 00:59:57,010
- Come and use them anytime.
- See you.

684
00:59:57,094 --> 00:59:58,136
Thank you.

685
01:00:00,972 --> 01:00:02,349
KIM MYEONG-O

686
01:00:04,351 --> 01:00:08,105
Hey, I got the guy who killed you.

687
01:00:10,190 --> 01:00:11,942
With the guys in the neighborhood.

688
01:00:15,695 --> 01:00:16,738
See you again.

689
01:00:42,139 --> 01:00:43,932
It really looks like a candle!

690
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:47,602
Min-seo.

691
01:00:47,936 --> 01:00:51,148
<i>Until that day</i>

692
01:00:51,523 --> 01:00:54,109
<i>When the waters of the East Sea run dry</i>

693
01:00:54,734 --> 01:00:55,652
Right on.

694
01:00:55,735 --> 01:00:57,612
You know the video
for the national anthem?

695
01:00:57,696 --> 01:00:59,239
The video is from this view.

696
01:01:02,325 --> 01:01:04,327
You really know everything, Jeong-hwan.

697
01:01:04,828 --> 01:01:06,705
Everyone knows that.

698
01:01:07,205 --> 01:01:08,331
I didn't.

699
01:01:08,915 --> 01:01:10,458
I just learned it today, too.

700
01:01:11,376 --> 01:01:12,961
It's actually
my first time hearing it too.

701
01:01:17,007 --> 01:01:18,008
Su-jin,

702
01:01:18,091 --> 01:01:20,427
do you really need good grades
to become a soldier?

703
01:01:21,303 --> 01:01:22,679
Not really.

704
01:01:25,807 --> 01:01:27,893
Why do you want to become a soldier?

705
01:01:28,268 --> 01:01:29,895
Did you see that video of my mom?

706
01:01:29,978 --> 01:01:32,731
She saved someone with her kick.
That's so awesome.

707
01:01:34,649 --> 01:01:35,609
Let's go.

708
01:01:37,944 --> 01:01:38,820
Hey.

709
01:01:39,279 --> 01:01:40,322
What is it?

710
01:01:40,405 --> 01:01:42,407
Did you really have to tag along?

711
01:01:42,908 --> 01:01:45,493
I'm just here as Min-seo's tutor.

712
01:01:47,746 --> 01:01:48,788
Good luck.

713
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:51,374
Fine.

714
01:01:52,834 --> 01:01:55,754
Man, the ocean breeze is so nice.

715
01:01:56,379 --> 01:01:57,464
Wait for me!

716
01:02:02,135 --> 01:02:02,969
Wait up!

717
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:06,348
Man, what's taking Yong-hui so long?

718
01:02:07,849 --> 01:02:08,892
Come on!

719
01:02:08,975 --> 01:02:10,769
No, you can go first!

720
01:02:16,483 --> 01:02:17,901
- Are you scared?
- What?

721
01:02:17,984 --> 01:02:18,860
Of course not.

722
01:02:37,921 --> 01:02:39,089
Mission success.

723
01:02:39,172 --> 01:02:40,006
Success.

724
01:02:40,924 --> 01:02:42,759
- No, wait--
- Let's run!

725
01:02:44,469 --> 01:02:45,595
It's fun, right?

726
01:02:54,229 --> 01:02:55,522
PLASTIC SURGERY

727
01:02:55,605 --> 01:02:57,190
The doctor will see you now.

728
01:02:58,650 --> 01:03:00,568
Let me take a look.

729
01:03:05,115 --> 01:03:07,284
Wow, you're really fit.

730
01:03:09,452 --> 01:03:11,204
Okay, all good.

731
01:03:11,705 --> 01:03:12,872
Have a seat.

732
01:03:17,210 --> 01:03:18,169
Doctor,

733
01:03:18,503 --> 01:03:21,589
I'd like to part ways with the monster
and start a new life.

734
01:03:22,048 --> 01:03:23,925
Do you think it's possible?

735
01:03:24,009 --> 01:03:25,552
Of course.

736
01:03:25,969 --> 01:03:28,138
But the thing about tattoos is

737
01:03:28,221 --> 01:03:32,017
that they require a lot more care
than you'd think.

738
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:34,311
It'll cost a lot, won't it?

739
01:03:34,394 --> 01:03:37,105
Of course, that's usually the case.

740
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:40,483
But you have insurance, right?

741
01:03:41,651 --> 01:03:43,903
Does insurance cover this?

742
01:03:45,113 --> 01:03:46,031
Yes.

743
01:03:48,241 --> 01:03:50,618
- Everything's covered in Korea.
- Of course.

744
01:03:50,702 --> 01:03:53,788
It's covered as part of scar recovery.

745
01:03:53,872 --> 01:03:57,375
Just get a few more treatments
that I recommend,

746
01:03:57,667 --> 01:03:59,461
and I'll give you

747
01:03:59,544 --> 01:04:01,504
the doctor's note and surgical record.

748
01:04:01,588 --> 01:04:05,342
Gosh, you're incredible.

749
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:07,385
You were sent by a friend,

750
01:04:07,469 --> 01:04:08,720
so of course I'll treat you well.

751
01:04:09,137 --> 01:04:10,430
Oh, then...

752
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:12,807
I also brought my guys along.

753
01:04:12,891 --> 01:04:15,352
Do you mind looking at them, too?

754
01:04:15,435 --> 01:04:16,353
Perfect.

755
01:04:16,436 --> 01:04:17,979
I mean, I'll do a perfect job.

756
01:04:18,521 --> 01:04:20,648
Bring them right in.

757
01:04:21,149 --> 01:04:22,484
Guys, come in!

758
01:04:23,651 --> 01:04:24,861
Hello, Doctor!

759
01:04:24,944 --> 01:04:27,947
- Hello, welcome.
- Hi.

760
01:04:28,031 --> 01:04:31,993
I'm Choi Kang from the SIU Unit
at Veotigo Insurance.

761
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:37,582
We have a few things to confirm
regarding a few insurance claims made.

762
01:04:37,665 --> 01:04:39,709
We're just here for a site visit.

763
01:04:40,043 --> 01:04:42,796
Please keep the doctor's notes,
surgical records, appointment records,

764
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:45,590
the original accounting ledgers,
and security camera footage

765
01:04:45,673 --> 01:04:47,384
for the time being.

766
01:04:47,467 --> 01:04:51,304
And we'd like to take
a short statement from you.

767
01:04:55,975 --> 01:04:59,604
I have no idea what you're talking about.

768
01:04:59,687 --> 01:05:02,232
Come on, Doctor, you know it all.

769
01:05:03,024 --> 01:05:05,527
Come on, Doctor. You know what it's about.

770
01:05:06,569 --> 01:05:10,115
Help them out, all right?

771

774
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:49,446
- You're incredible.
- Hey, boss!

775
01:05:49,529 --> 01:05:50,905
How did it go?

776
01:05:51,531 --> 01:05:54,909
Who am I? The ace of Veotigo.

777
01:05:54,993 --> 01:05:56,786
I took care of it perfectly.

778
01:05:57,412 --> 01:05:58,246
Really?

779
01:05:58,329 --> 01:06:00,707
Kang has some insane connections.

780
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:04,043
He has an adorable yet terrifying friend.

781
01:06:04,836 --> 01:06:06,379
It's not just the connections.

782
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:09,048
He really is just insane.

783
01:06:09,132 --> 01:06:11,176
- Right?
- You, too!

784
01:06:14,387 --> 01:06:16,431
How about a drink tonight? My treat.

785
01:06:16,764 --> 01:06:18,558
Not today. I have a housewarming party.

786
01:06:18,766 --> 01:06:20,268
A housewarming party?

787
01:06:20,351 --> 01:06:21,227
Did you move again?

788
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:22,812
Hold on.

789
01:06:22,896 --> 01:06:24,772
I'd better go to the ATM
and get some cash.

790
01:06:24,856 --> 01:06:25,899
For Do-yeon.

791
01:06:25,982 --> 01:06:27,817
I'm busy tonight, though.

792
01:06:27,901 --> 01:06:29,194
What are you talking about?

793
01:06:29,277 --> 01:06:31,988
It's for my neighbors tonight, not you.

794
01:06:32,071 --> 01:06:35,200
You should have just said so
from the beginning.

795
01:06:35,283 --> 01:06:38,745
Are you playing favorites
between work and your neighbors?

796
01:06:38,828 --> 01:06:41,122
I already invited you guys once.
Give me a break.

797
01:06:41,748 --> 01:06:43,124
Let's just grab some lunch.

798
01:06:43,208 --> 01:06:44,542
- Okay, let's go.
- Okay.

799
01:06:44,626 --> 01:06:46,503
Not that Chinese place again, though.

800
01:06:46,586 --> 01:06:48,796
We just ate! Why are we eating again?

801
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:50,465
Let's just keep eating, all right?

802
01:06:50,548 --> 01:06:51,799
Keep eating?

803
01:06:51,883 --> 01:06:54,177
See? You're insane!

804
01:06:58,932 --> 01:07:00,433
This smells incredible.

805
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:02,185
- It's delicious.
- Here you go.

806
01:07:02,268 --> 01:07:04,687
- Here it is!
- Yes!

807
01:07:05,396 --> 01:07:07,398
You didn't have to cook so much for us!

808
01:07:08,399 --> 01:07:09,400
She cooked a feast.

809
01:07:09,484 --> 01:07:13,029
Your cooking is even better
than what people say.

810
01:07:13,112 --> 01:07:15,073
Everything is delicious.

811
01:07:15,156 --> 01:07:18,201
The side dishes from your wife
and Nam-yeon are just as amazing.

812
01:07:18,284 --> 01:07:20,161
Oh, don't give me that.

813
01:07:20,245 --> 01:07:22,372
They only taste good
because we're eating together.

814
01:07:22,455 --> 01:07:23,831
Do-yeon, try this too.

815
01:07:23,915 --> 01:07:24,749
Open up.

816
01:07:25,792 --> 01:07:26,709
Good girl.

817
01:07:26,793 --> 01:07:29,587
- Thank you, Uncle.
- Have some water, too.

818
01:07:29,712 --> 01:07:30,713
Okay.

819
01:07:32,131 --> 01:07:33,967
Get married and have a kid already.

820
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:36,261
That's not just up to me, is it?

821
01:07:36,344 --> 01:07:37,804
- That's true.
- He can't get married.

822
01:07:37,887 --> 01:07:39,472
- There's no way.
- Impossible.

823
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:42,225
Yong-hui,

824
01:07:42,308 --> 01:07:43,977
stop stuffing your face
and join the conversation.

825
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:45,853
You guys can do all the talking.

826
01:07:45,937 --> 01:07:47,021
I'll just eat.

827
01:07:47,105 --> 01:07:48,189
Mi-gyeong,

828
01:07:48,273 --> 01:07:50,191
can I have another bowl after this?

829
01:07:50,275 --> 01:07:51,109
Of course.

830
01:07:52,193 --> 01:07:54,028
This is so nice.

831
01:07:54,612 --> 01:07:57,323
Let's all have dinner
at our place next time.

832
01:07:57,407 --> 01:07:59,701
I'll make some delicious
spicy braised chicken.

833
01:07:59,784 --> 01:08:02,287
- That's awesome!
- I'd love that.

834
01:08:02,370 --> 01:08:05,540
Let's invite Myeong-o and his mom, too.

835
01:08:11,796 --> 01:08:15,592
Then let's have dinner
at our place next time.

836
01:08:15,675 --> 01:08:17,218
- Sounds good.
- Okay.

837
01:08:17,302 --> 01:08:20,054
Nobody makes spicy braised chicken
like Hui-ja.

838
01:08:20,138 --> 01:08:22,140
- That's true.
- It's the best.

839
01:08:22,515 --> 01:08:24,767
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

840
01:08:30,189 --> 01:08:31,065
Oh, wow.

841
01:08:31,149 --> 01:08:33,151
KIYUN-SI, OFFICIAL URBAN CONVERGENCE
SPECIALIZED ZONE

842
01:08:33,234 --> 01:08:34,402
Can't believe that's gotten approved.

843
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:37,864
I get calls nonstop these days.

844
01:08:38,323 --> 01:08:40,658
Everyone is calling,
asking me to sell my land to them.

845
01:08:41,242 --> 01:08:43,161
What? You own land?

846
01:08:43,244 --> 01:08:45,580
You know the field
on the way to the gas station?

847
01:08:45,663 --> 01:08:47,498
- All of that's his land.
- What?

848
01:08:47,582 --> 01:08:49,959
And you tell me now?
I spent a fortune on our gears!

849
01:08:50,043 --> 01:08:51,961
No, it's not worth that much.

850
01:08:52,962 --> 01:08:54,922
Sir!

851
01:08:55,006 --> 01:08:56,841
Please let me pour you one.

852
01:08:56,924 --> 01:08:59,052
Do you not own any land, little one?

853
01:08:59,135 --> 01:09:00,386
Of course not!

854
01:09:00,470 --> 01:09:02,096
You're a landless loser, I see.

855
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:04,599
A landless loser?

856
01:09:04,682 --> 01:09:06,684
You want me to pour this on your head?

857
01:09:06,768 --> 01:09:09,187
- You guys are such kids.
- What do you mean?

858
01:09:09,270 --> 01:09:10,938
Anyway, good work, everyone.

859
01:09:11,022 --> 01:09:13,232
- Good work.
- Great job.

860
01:09:18,488 --> 01:09:21,491
I just don't want to see
Changri-dong on the news anymore.

861
01:09:21,866 --> 01:09:23,117
I know.

862
01:09:23,951 --> 01:09:25,662
Something like this
won't happen again, right?

863
01:09:26,663 --> 01:09:28,122
Of course not.

864
01:09:28,498 --> 01:09:30,875
Isn't that right,
secret agent of Changri-dong?

865
01:09:31,209 --> 01:09:32,502
Come on.

866
01:09:32,585 --> 01:09:33,419
What?

867
01:09:35,254 --> 01:09:36,089
Jeez.

868
01:09:36,172 --> 01:09:39,092
Those cars need to stop using
high beams around here.

869
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:41,803
- Let me pour you some more.
- Yeah.

870
01:09:41,886 --> 01:09:43,054
Hey, where's Su-il?

871
01:09:43,137 --> 01:09:44,305
- Home.
- Thank you.

872
01:09:44,389 --> 01:09:45,390
And he's not bummed?

873
01:09:45,473 --> 01:09:47,600
No, he's not.
He needs to stop drinking, anyway.

874
01:09:47,684 --> 01:09:48,518
Hey--

875
01:09:55,692 --> 01:09:56,526
What was that?
