HEROES NEXT DOOR

2
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,876
THIS DRAMA IS A WORK OF FICTION.
ALL CHARACTERS, PROFESSIONS, PLACES,

3
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,002
COMPANIES, ORGANIZATIONS,
ETHNIC GROUPS AND EVENTS ARE NOT REAL.

4
00:00:44,086 --> 00:00:45,045
ALL CHILD AND ANIMAL SCENES WERE FILMED
SAFELY UNDER EXPERT SUPERVISION.

5
00:00:47,673 --> 00:00:50,509
MINISTER OF NATIONAL DEFENSE: KIM SEOK-JUN

6
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:52,302
CYBER OPERATIONS COMMAND:
BRIGADIER GENERAL KIM DO-HYEONG, UNIT 900

7
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:54,054
LOGISTIC SUPPORT GROUP COMMANDER:
COLONEL JANG JUN-HUI

8
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:58,350
If it's a modified Composition C-4...

9
00:00:58,433 --> 00:00:59,560
DEFENSE ACQUISITION PROGRAM ADMINISTRATOR:
KANG JUNG-GI

10
00:00:59,643 --> 00:01:01,603
It's definitely the bomb
we snuck away then.

11
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:04,606
I know, I'm looking at it right now!

12
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:06,525
Why point out the obvious?

13
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:10,195
Am I asking you if the bomb belongs to us?

14
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,240
I'm asking what it's doing out there!

15
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:17,160
Have you checked the inventory count?

16
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,456
Yes, and the said bomb
isn't used in the military anymore.

17
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:24,960
The ones used last time
were classified as mission supplies.

18
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,838
Exactly. We exported all of them abroad.

19
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:31,592
So, how did an exported bomb
make a U-turn and return to Korea?

20
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:34,261
Maybe there was
an issue with the delivery.

21
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:36,221
They paid us the right amount.

22
00:01:36,305 --> 00:01:38,223
That means they definitely got the goods.

23
00:01:38,307 --> 00:01:39,683
Could it be...

24
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:42,894
an act of terrorism?

25
00:01:43,145 --> 00:01:44,771
Had that been the case,

26
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:49,443
the terrorists would've come forward,
demanding something!

27
00:01:50,152 --> 00:01:52,738
And why would any terrorist organization
want to target Kiyun-si?

28
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:53,947
It's not even Seoul!

29
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:55,824
You're so thick-headed.

30
00:01:58,285 --> 00:01:59,244
Listen up.

31
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:02,331
Whatever it is,

32
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:06,501
make sure the guys
who were at the site stay quiet.

33
00:02:06,585 --> 00:02:07,836
Keep a good eye on them.

34
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:12,299
If this goes wrong,
it's over for all of us. Got it?

35
00:02:23,185 --> 00:02:26,104
- Yes, sir.
- Tell all the ones on leave to return.

36
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:27,230
Yes, sir.

37
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:31,610
<i>Cyber Operations Command,</i>
<i>Logistics Support Group,</i>

38
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,029
<i>and the Defense Acquisition Program</i>
<i>Administrator?</i>

39
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:37,824
What were they doing together?

40
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:52,881
MY BESTIE'S BESTIE IS MY BESTIE TOO

41
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,135
YOU'RE MAKING THINGS COMPLICATED
JDD SPECIAL OPERATIONS FORCES, CHOI KANG

42
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:03,016
<i>They know me?</i>

43
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:06,687
Does this unit actually exist?

44
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:09,439
Are you really from the JDD unit?

45
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,943
I've never heard
of the JDD Special Operations Forces.

46
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:16,321
- You know the Jindo Dog Alert? So--
- Wait.

47
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:18,073
- Look at this.
- At what?

48
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:19,282
Look at this.

49
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,746
"A new day is...

50
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:28,750
coming"?

51
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:31,878
A NEW DAY IS COMING

52
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:34,131
It shut down.

53
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:36,133
What's going on? What happened?

54
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,511
It's completely shut down.

55
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:46,309
Why? Did you break it?

56
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:50,063
So, what now?

57
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:53,024
"A new day is coming"?

58
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:55,569
What does that mean?

59
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,618
How should I know?
I'm just reading what's on the screen.

60
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:06,079
I can read, too, you know?

61
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:07,789
What I want to ask is--

62
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:11,168
Mr. Choi, get changed first.

63
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,961
Thank you.

64
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,880
Are you sure you're fine?

65
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:17,215
Are you sure you're not hurt badly
under your shirt?

66
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,302
I'm fine.

67
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:26,057
I told you not to follow me.

68
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:30,437
I mean, we also need to see
what happened...

69
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:34,441
What?

70
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:39,446
<i>He definitely died.</i>

71
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,114
<i>They cleaned it up so quickly.</i>

72
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,575
<i>Do they have a cleanup crew with them?</i>

73
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,830
What is this? I don't see anyone.

74
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:51,833
Are you sure you fought someone here?

75
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:55,629
Are you sure
that's not chili powder and ketchup?

76
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:59,341
Try tasting it, then.

77
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:01,134
You think I'm that bored?

78
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:02,803
My gosh!

79
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,429
- What?
- What?

80
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:07,474
It's so clean.

81
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:10,602
I've never seen these urinals this clean!

82
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:11,561
Man!

83
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,188
You're right.

84
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:14,856
Damn.

85
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:16,858
Are you kidding me?

86
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:20,153
How do we check the security cameras
in the hallway and the exit?

87
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:22,572
The management office.

88
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:29,538
That's odd. Is the memory full?
Why did it not record anything only here?

89
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:32,749
Someone seems to have tampered with it.

90
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,502
They would've gotten rid of it all.

91
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:37,754
That quickly?

92
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:41,383
You're saying they cleaned the bathroom
and took care of the security cameras too?

93
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,093
These guys are pros.

94
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,053
They seem to have
a cleanup crew with them.

95
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:48,306
A cleanup crew?
To clean up after all the mess?

96
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,143
I should've just walked away
when he mentioned North Korean spies.

97
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:55,063
Let's report it to the police first.

98
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:56,565
What will we tell them?

99
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:58,775
That you beat someone up
on your way to take a dump?

100
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:02,195
We need to leave a record of it
in case we get blamed later.

101
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:03,530
Good point.

102
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:05,740
Hey, contact Officer Park.

103
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:08,451
No, call the police hotline.

104
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:10,704
An informal report to an officer won't do.

105
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:12,706
Okay, but what should we say?

106
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,457
That you went to take a dump
and beat someone up?

107
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,960
Hey. Don't mention the dump.

108
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:19,337
What if they ask
why he went to the bathroom?

109
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:33,935
Tell me more about the JDD unit.
Is it real?

110
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:36,396
- Is there really such a unit in Korea?
- Exactly.

111
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:37,856
No comment.

112
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:39,441
Oh, you can't tell us?

113
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:42,152
That means it's real.

114
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:44,988
JDD? Is it short for "Jindo dog"?

115
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,740
No comment.

116
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,992
I heard you're only deployed
on high-risk combat missions.

117
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,995
Not even other military units know of it.

118
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:54,706
And it doesn't belong
to the Ministry of National Defense.

119
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:55,999
Are these all true?

120
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,459
That's incredible.

121
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:05,216
Where did you hear all that?

122
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,011
Who discusses state secrets so openly?

123
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:13,224
No comment, okay? Stop asking me about it.

124
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:14,601
Yes, sir.

125
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:17,312
Sure, whatever.

126
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,942
Right. What are you going to do with that?

127
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:24,527
- What's your plan?
- Oh, this?

128
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:28,740
I thought about reporting it to the cops,
but I missed my time to do it.

129
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:31,743
We can give it to them,
but let's check the files in it first.

130
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:35,497
And please get me a copy of the footage
of the accident at the intersection.

131
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,499
Great idea. You can do it, right?

132
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:41,336
They used a remote control
to factory reset the settings.

133
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:44,381
But I'll try it.
I'll set up the equipment today.

134
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:46,633
Okay, goodnight, then.

135
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:48,176
Okay.

136
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:51,554
- Goodnight, Mr. Choi!
- Goodnight.

137
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:59,521
Man... He really is from JDD.

138
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:04,442
Everything makes sense now,
with the gun and all.

139
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:06,736
So, he's the Jason Bourne of Korea.
Amazing.

140
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:11,157
He's much scarier than we thought.

141
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:13,284
Look at how they recognized him
immediately.

142
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:17,330
Choi Kang, look at what you've done to us.

143
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:19,666
- Byeong-nam.
- Yeah?

144
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:23,670
Isn't it better for us
that we have him on our side?

145
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:26,548
What is this? A soccer match? What side?

146
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:29,968
But he's definitely not
on the other side, right?

147
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:33,596
Of course not!
Enough with the pointless doubts!

148
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:39,728
Hey, you're always on the computer,
hacking or whatever,

149
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:42,480
but you were so useless earlier.

150
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:46,192
I wouldn't have expected
any more from you.

151
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:48,862
They suddenly started
remote-controlling it,

152
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:50,196
and I've never seen this laptop model!

153
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,614
- Sure.
- I was just confused, okay?

154
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:53,742
Sure, you were.

155
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:55,452
- Hey.
- What?

156
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:59,372
I'll look into it, but you can take it.

157
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:02,083
I can't put the kids at my gym at risk.

158
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,210
You can't put the kids at risk,
but I'm okay?

159
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:06,838
Give it.

160
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:11,843
- And Byeong-nam.
- What now?

161
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:15,680
Invite Mr. Choi
to the hardware store from now on.

162
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:19,267
Man, where are your balls?

163
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,352
Seriously.

164
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:24,898
Fine. Go now.

165
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:26,691
I'm also walking that way.

166
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:28,193
Oh, right. Come.

167
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,997
SPECIAL MARTIAL ARTS

168
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:54,260
Honey, what are you doing there?

169
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:56,805
I was just going to the bathroom.

170
00:09:58,223 --> 00:09:59,349
You took a while.

171
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:02,310
Yeah, I did a loop
around the neighborhood.

172
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:03,603
Go back to sleep.

173
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:08,483
"Yongmu Gym"?

174
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:14,864
Don't put it in the laundry inside out.

175
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:17,784
Okay, just go to bed already.

176
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:29,796
Are you a foreigner?

177
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:30,797
Watch out!

178
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:34,968
Who sent you here? Tell me.

179
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:38,930
"A new day is coming"?

180
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:54,154
MAMMOSEU MART

181
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:56,489
Min-seo, cut it out.

182
00:10:56,698 --> 00:10:59,951
I'm the only one
among my friends without it.

183
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:03,246
I'll study really hard.
Just get me this, please?

184
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:06,124
Please, Mom.

185
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:08,042
Wake up.

186
00:11:08,126 --> 00:11:11,171
What middle-school student
wears sneakers that cost 500,000 won?

187
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:14,966
Don't you see your mom and dad
working to the bone here?

188
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:15,884
Take this.

189
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,678
- But Mom.
- Gosh.

190
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,889
You don't need to call me that so loudly.

191
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:24,726
The whole town knows I'm your mom already.

192
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:26,561
Are you really not getting them for me?

193
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:29,689
No, you can save the money
and get a pair for yourself.

194
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:34,986
- You're so mean.
- Whatever.

195
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:38,406
Was I adopted?

196
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:48,791
You think adopting is easy?
That costs money, you know?

197
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:50,585
Goodness.

198
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:57,842
- Hello.
- Hey, Myeong-o.

199
00:11:57,926 --> 00:11:59,093
What's with Min-seo?

200
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:08,019
What's with the butane gas?

201
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:09,687
Oh, these.

202
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:11,773
You know the butane gas
that exploded in the ATM?

203
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:13,691
- They're recalling them all.
- I see.

204
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:16,277
Your first day at work
is coming soon, isn't it?

205
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:17,237
Yes.

206
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:21,699
Your mom is over the moon
because you work for a big company now.

207
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:23,993
She said she'd host a party
for the Women's Association.

208
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,370
My gosh, Mom.

209
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:26,788
Why shouldn't she?

210
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:30,708
If Min-seo went to Hanguk University
and got a good job like you,

211
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:33,461
I'd host a party for the entire town
with a whole pig and a cow.

212
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:37,966
I'd be practically
dancing around the streets.

213
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:39,676
But look at her.

214
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:43,221
She just asked if she was adopted
just because I wouldn't buy her sneakers.

215
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:44,847
Min-seo is smart.

216
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:48,351
Jeong-hwan said she was a quick learner
with great comprehension skills.

217
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:49,686
He never lies.

218
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,980
- Really?
- Of course.

219
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:57,402
Anyway, thanks for introducing me
to such a great tutor.

220
00:12:57,819 --> 00:12:58,945
It's nothing.

221
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,989
- I'll get going now.
- Okay.

222
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:03,157
- Have a good day.
- You, too.

223
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:06,744
Of course.

224
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:09,372
It's impossible for her to be stupid
if she takes after me.

225
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:21,551
This is better than I expected.

226
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:24,846
You'll get the basics down soon.

227
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:28,558
Why didn't you try hard in school
when you're so smart?

228
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,813
I'm complimenting you. Why the long face?

229
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:38,026
Sullivan credits his parents
for all his success.

230
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:41,070
His birth parents abandoned him,

231
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,781
but his adoptive parents
gave him everything.

232
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:46,909
He said he got a second chance at life,
thanks to being adopted,

233
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:49,537
which eventually led him to success.

234
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:54,167
Did you save up your own money
to get your car?

235
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,627
No, my parents helped me.

236
00:13:56,711 --> 00:14:00,673
My mom wants me to save up
and buy my own sneakers.

237
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,969
By the way,

238
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:09,474
do you have a girlfriend?

239
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:10,808
No.

240
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:16,606
That's why studying
is my biggest interest nowadays.

241
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:19,484
I don't know why I haven't tried harder
with such a smart brain.

242
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:22,820
Should I move on to the next question?

243
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:26,699
Sure, here's your pen.

244
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:39,921
Honey.

245
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,131
You got changed?

246
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:43,883
Where are you going now?

247
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:45,843
The youth association president
wants to see me.

248
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:47,762
I'll be right back.

249
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,013
What youth association president?

250
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:53,393
It's the hardware store owner.

251
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,104
He looks too old to be a youth, though.

252
00:14:56,979 --> 00:15:00,316
Anyway, the owner of the grocery store
is the head of the Women's Association,

253
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,027
and the owner of the laundry place is
the head of the neighborhood association.

254
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:05,822
What an organized neighborhood, right?

255
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:07,490
Anyway, see you.

256
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:14,789
It's dangerous out today,
so stay home with Do-yeon, okay?

257
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:17,375
What's dangerous?

258
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,547
The micro dusts.

259
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:26,050
The pollution level is crazy today.

260
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:28,344
It's life-threatening.

261
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:29,887
See you.

262
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:39,564
Why are you going out, then?

263
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:41,816
Why?

264
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:43,151
Here.

265
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:48,865
If this is an assassination attempt,
you should've chosen the right poison.

266
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:54,036
I'm very immune.
Not just any poison gets to me.

267
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:59,083
Do they train you
for assassination attempts at JDD?

268
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:04,464
There's no such training. Come on, man.

269
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:08,259
You're the one who mentioned
all that about being immune.

270
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:10,178
I was just trying to be nice.

271
00:16:10,261 --> 00:16:14,640
So why are you suddenly being nice?
Of course I'll get suspicious.

272
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:18,019
And all Korean dads are immune.

273
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:20,229
From eating all the food
their kids drop on the floor.

274
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:24,025
Whatever.

275
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:25,818
I served in the HID unit

276
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:28,738
until I had to transfer
to the Maintenance Battalion.

277
00:16:29,197 --> 00:16:30,239
Okay, whatever.

278
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:32,658
Let me just ask you one thing.

279
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:35,369
How old are you, Mr. Hardware?

280
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:37,955
Me?

281
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:42,418
I was a freshman in 1998.

282
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:45,421
What? So was I.
Born in the year of the sheep?

283
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:48,549
No way!

284
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:51,052
I didn't expect to meet
someone my age in my neighborhood.

285
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,804
Hey, buddy. Nice to meet you.

286
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:57,850
You're changing the topic.
You're younger than me, aren't you?

287
00:16:57,934 --> 00:17:01,187
Who changed the topic? You did, not me.

288
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,272
Whatever.

289
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:06,442
Tell me more about the JDD unit.

290
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:15,576
You know what acid the army can't handle?

291
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:19,539
An acid the army can't handle?

292
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:23,167
Nitric acid? No.

293
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:25,336
No, sulfuric acid.

294
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:30,508
Amino acid!

295
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:32,593
Army-no acid! You know?

296
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:36,013
You can't make your whole personality
about serving without even knowing this.

297
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:38,474
Are you sure you're from the HID unit?

298
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:41,519
Where's the gun? I have to shoot you.

299
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:44,438
Are you kidding me?

300
00:17:44,522 --> 00:17:45,523
Hey, honey.

301
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:46,816
<i>Where are you, Daddy?</i>

302
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,442
Hey, my cutie.

303
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:50,820
I'm just out for a bit.
I'll be right back.

304
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:53,656
Okay.

305
00:17:54,991 --> 00:18:00,663
Come to the street pub at the intersection
after dinner tonight.

306
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,623
I'm grabbing a drink with the guys.

307
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:05,793
You should get to know your neighbors.

308
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:07,169
Aren't I right, buddy?

309
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:10,131
Let me ask you a favor.

310
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:14,343
Let's not talk about the no comment thing
around others, all right?

311
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:16,053
Sure, friend.

312
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:25,521
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

313
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:28,316
He's one of us now, okay?

314
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:30,484
- Sure.
- Yes, pleased to meet you.

315
00:18:30,568 --> 00:18:31,819
Likewise.

316
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:33,654
Feels like you're one of us already.

317
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:39,285
I like you now a lot better than
when you were acting up at the hospital.

318
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:42,538
- What's your name? Choi...
- Choi Kang.

319
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:45,166
You look so gentle,
yet your name means "the strongest."

320
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:47,293
What a strong boy.

321
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:50,254
I don't know about anything else,
but my name never loses.

322
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:54,133
I have a name women quite like, too.

323
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:56,969
You know "Kim Su-il's diamond," right?

324
00:18:57,053 --> 00:19:00,514
I used to seduce women
by promising a fist-sized diamond.

325
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:04,393
Who'd understand
the "Kim Su-il's diamond" reference now?

326
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:07,146
Do you even know how much diamonds cost?

327
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:09,273
You know how much a fist-sized one is?

328
00:19:09,357 --> 00:19:11,817
You have no idea, do you?

329
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:13,611
- Why don't I take that fist
- My gosh.

330
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:15,780
and break all your teeth?

331
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:18,407
Sorry that things have been chaotic
since you moved.

332
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:20,076
We rarely have incidents like these.

333
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:22,953
Things were great around here
when the housing prices skyrocketed

334
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:24,580
after the specialized zone announcement.

335
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:28,501
Kang, how old are you?
Around Byeong-nam's age?

336
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:31,087
Yeah, we were freshmen in college
in the same year.

337
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,171
We're the same age.

338
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:33,714
Then born in the year of the monkey?

339
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:36,300
So you're also 12 years younger than me.

340
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:38,928
I was born in the year of the sheep.

341
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:45,226
Little Byeong-nam here may look rough,
but he can be quite cute.

342
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:47,603
Stop it. All my friends
were born in the year of the sheep.

343
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:49,438
And we're friends
if we were freshmen in the same year.

344
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:52,316
Sure, kiddo. I'll let it slide.

345
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,402
Have a drink, little bro.

346
00:19:54,485 --> 00:19:56,320
He was born in the year of the monkey.

347
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:59,490
- Whatever.
- Here you go.

348
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:01,659
Hey, we haven't gotten together
since that night.

349
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:03,160
- Right.
- Ji-hun.

350
00:20:03,244 --> 00:20:05,371
You were also here
on the night of the accident.

351
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:10,251
Yeah, I had to stay here until sunrise
to clean up at the pub.

352
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:12,586
- You must've been scared, too.
- I was scared out of my mind.

353
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:14,088
- Enjoy.
- Okay.

354
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,006
Goodness.

355
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:17,883
So Byeong-nam has an early birthday?

356
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:18,843
Give me a moment.

357
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:26,308
Excuse me.

358
00:20:26,851 --> 00:20:29,687
Did you happen to see
the driver of the other car,

359
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,772
not the truck?

360
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:35,234
I don't know
about the driver of the other car.

361
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:39,321
But a tow truck came
when the firefighters put out the fire.

362
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:42,366
And the tow truck just took that car.

363
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:45,494
Do you remember
the color of the tow truck or its company?

364
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:47,788
No, I don't.

365
00:20:47,872 --> 00:20:49,248
Anything else?

366
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:52,042
You must've seen something
since you stayed here all night.

367
00:20:55,546 --> 00:20:56,380
Oh, right.

368
00:20:56,881 --> 00:21:02,052
And a 2.5t truck came
and cleaned up the site.

369
00:21:02,136 --> 00:21:04,346
<i>Judging by their light packs,</i>
<i>they seemed like the standby squad.</i>

370
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:07,975
<i>A 2.5t truck? You mean a military truck?</i>

371
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:11,812
Yeah, I know it because
I drove one as a military driver.

372
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:14,356
They looked like
the Logistic Support Group.

373
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:17,485
Back in the day, they specialized
in flood and forest fire recovery,

374
00:21:17,568 --> 00:21:21,572
so I was surprised to see them
clean up after a car accident that night.

375
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:24,158
Thanks.

376
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:26,076
All right, then.

377
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:36,504
There was military involvement
in both cases?

378
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:39,340
Why did they take the other car?

379
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:20,965
What?

380
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:23,050
- Damn it.
- Get your tools!

381
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:24,301
Hurry! Go!

382
00:23:05,968 --> 00:23:09,430
<i>A tow truck came</i>
<i>when the firefighters put out the fire.</i>

383
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:11,891
<i>And the tow truck just took that car.</i>

384
00:23:12,266 --> 00:23:14,685
Apparently, he took the damaged car
and drove toward Hanbal Mountain.

385
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:18,022
There's nothing
on the other car or the driver.

386
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:20,399
No idea whether they're alive or dead.

387
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:21,817
<i>But the other car is more at fault.</i>

388
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:34,288
What? Why is this open?

389
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:37,958
What?

390
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:39,627
Is that a frog?

391
00:23:41,295 --> 00:23:42,129
Hey, sort it out.

392
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:35,516
Darn it!

393
00:24:35,933 --> 00:24:37,977
I can't do anything
when it won't even turn on.

394
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,230
Do what?

395
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,902
Hey, it's the perfect time
for instant noodles.

396
00:24:47,778 --> 00:24:48,904
Instant noodles sound good.

397
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:50,406
Yeah, let's have some before we continue.

398
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:57,371
- Is it still not turning on?
- No.

399
00:24:57,871 --> 00:24:59,248
Damn it.

400
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:06,880
- How many?
- Three packs?

401
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:09,633
Three? Just for you?

402
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:19,309
VEOTIGO INSURANCE

403
00:25:19,393 --> 00:25:20,352
Yes.

404
00:25:23,105 --> 00:25:23,939
Yes.

405
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:28,027
We're not done investigating yet.

406
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:31,572
<i>Why are you still investigating?</i>
<i>The autopsy and funeral ended days ago!</i>

407
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:33,449
We're doing our best.

408
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:35,617
<i>Damn it, this is so frustrating.</i>

409
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:36,952
BENEFICIARY DESIGNATION FORM
<i>My sister still has to live</i>

410
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:39,371
<i>even if her husband died!</i>

411
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:42,332
<i>The woman with the baby who just left.</i>

412
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:44,293
<i>Her husband died</i>
<i>in the intersection accident.</i>

413
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,628
<i>She only ever buys products</i>
<i>that are on sale.</i>

414
00:25:47,171 --> 00:25:49,423
<i>Her kid is too young for her to work.</i>

415
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,217
Of course, I understand.

416
00:25:53,427 --> 00:25:55,471
THE CONFIRMED BENEFICIARIES ARE
HIS WIFE, LEE SEO-HUI, AND HIS 2 CHILDREN

417
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:56,388
Yes, sir.

418
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:02,061
Kang, did you finish your report?

419
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:07,691
Soldiers came late that night
to clean up after the accident.

420
00:26:07,775 --> 00:26:10,152
The street pub server
across the street saw it.

421
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:11,904
Soldiers? Man!

422
00:26:12,863 --> 00:26:15,491
It'll get complicated
with soldiers in the equation.

423
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:17,826
Let's just close the case here.

424
00:26:19,036 --> 00:26:22,623
I'll file an emergency request
for the life insurance payout.

425
00:26:22,873 --> 00:26:24,333
They'll get the fund once it's approved.

426
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:27,669
No, there are some bad guys
who are eyeing that money.

427
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:30,672
So not yet. Just wait a bit.
Just a bit longer.

428
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:34,301
You were begging me
to speed things up the other day.

429
00:27:00,077 --> 00:27:01,120
Hello?

430
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,460
- Is anyone home?
- We work hard.

431
00:27:08,544 --> 00:27:11,547
So why can't you repay us?

432
00:27:12,214 --> 00:27:14,466
If you borrowed money,
you have to repay it.

433
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:16,301
Huh? Don't you?

434
00:27:16,385 --> 00:27:18,303
Hey, look around and see
if she has any money.

435
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:19,513
- Yes, sir.
- Go.

436
00:27:32,526 --> 00:27:34,778
- Stay here.
- Where's the money?

437
00:27:34,862 --> 00:27:38,657
Hey, don't break anything.
Just look carefully, okay?

438
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:40,742
Yes, carefully.

439
00:27:41,285 --> 00:27:43,453
Come on.

440
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:47,291
We don't want the whole town to know
she can't repay her debt.

441
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:51,545
Use the yellow crayon.
It's a sunflower, man.

442
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:53,130
With black in the middle.

443
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:54,548
- Are you colorblind?
- Hello, ma'am.

444
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:58,260
I'm Choi Kang

445
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:00,220
of the SIU unit.

446
00:28:00,304 --> 00:28:01,763
I see.

447
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:04,474
I had to come to tell you something.

448
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:07,060
I'll just sit here.

449
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:10,355
Listen to me carefully, okay?

450
00:28:11,899 --> 00:28:13,400
Once the inheritance process starts,

451
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:16,653
the beneficiaries take on
the deceased’s debts as well.

452
00:28:16,737 --> 00:28:18,280
So, file a renunciation of inheritance
with the court.

453
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:21,366
But every beneficiary
must file the renunciation.

454
00:28:22,284 --> 00:28:26,121
Now, would the renunciation prevent you
from taking the life insurance payout?

455
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:27,039
No.

456
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:30,000
Even if you renunciate inheritance,

457
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:34,296
you can get the life insurance payout,
as it's the beneficiary's own asset.

458
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:38,508
Even if debt collectors come to you,
demanding that you pay them back,

459
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:40,469
you can just ignore them.

460
00:28:45,933 --> 00:28:48,018
What's that punk even saying?

461
00:28:48,602 --> 00:28:50,270
Is he from an insurance company?

462
00:28:50,354 --> 00:28:51,521
I think so, sir.

463
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,816
Remember what I told you

464
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,069
and do exactly that, okay?

465
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:01,031
Yes, thank you.

466
00:29:02,658 --> 00:29:03,909
You must be So-yul.

467
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:05,911
You're so cute.

468
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:08,247
All right.

469
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:13,126
Eat something good with your mom.

470
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:18,257
And get some ice cream,
but don't share it with the baby, okay?

471
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:20,884
Yes, thank you.

472
00:29:20,968 --> 00:29:24,054
What a damn beautiful sight.

473
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:25,514
Go and have some food.

474
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:27,349
Sure.

475
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:33,438
- I'll talk to them. Don't worry and go.
- Okay.

476
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:36,275
Get me some ice cream, too!

477
00:29:36,358 --> 00:29:38,694
The twisty bar kind, okay?

478
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:41,738
Hey, insurance.

479
00:29:43,282 --> 00:29:44,408
Come here.

480
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:47,577
Why are you interrupting our business?

481
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:49,913
Come here, you punk.

482
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:51,748
Just don't kill them.

483
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:56,586
Don't kill them.

484
00:30:04,553 --> 00:30:06,638
Hey, you want to die?

485
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,974
How dare you ignore the boss--

486
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:37,336
You done writing it?

487
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:38,795
Yes, sir.

488
00:30:40,464 --> 00:30:44,926
Table, 3,000,000 won.
Chairs, 2,000,000 won.

489
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:46,762
What kind of chair costs that much?

490
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:49,890
We have to get a whole new set to match.

491
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:52,100
The chairs look fine.

492
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:55,604
Yes, sir.

493
00:30:56,313 --> 00:30:58,732
Next, 1,000,000 won for the coffee table.

494
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:00,192
That's a rip-off, isn't it?

495
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:02,694
Yes, it is. It's too cheap, isn't it?

496
00:31:03,487 --> 00:31:04,321
No, sir.

497
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:08,617
You put your cigarette on the table?

498
00:31:10,786 --> 00:31:13,163
Add 500,000 won for cleaning.

499
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:15,290
What? For cleaning?

500
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:17,709
That's how much it costs
to clean a home when moving in.

501
00:31:17,793 --> 00:31:18,627
Write it down.

502
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:20,712
Yes, sir.

503
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:26,343
When you're done, write the date,
your name, and phone number, and sign it.

504
00:31:27,636 --> 00:31:28,553
Give it to me.

505
00:31:29,346 --> 00:31:30,180
Yes, sir.

506
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:36,019
SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT

507
00:31:36,103 --> 00:31:38,313
It's 6,500,000 won in total, right?

508
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:40,357
Yes.

509
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,733
Darn it, my pants.

510
00:31:42,943 --> 00:31:45,529
Hey, add 7,000 won for dry cleaning.

511
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:46,655
Dry cleaning?

512
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,578
No, it's not what you think!

513
00:31:53,662 --> 00:31:55,747
I'll just give you the 7,000 won now.

514
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:57,165
Hold on.

515
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:01,503
Here you go.

516
00:32:05,382 --> 00:32:06,425
Listen, buddy.

517
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:09,302
I don't bully people into giving me money,
like you guys do,

518
00:32:09,386 --> 00:32:11,680
so I'll only take the maximum legal rate
of 20 percent.

519
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:13,557
Pay me on time, okay?

520
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:14,766
Yes, sir.

521
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:25,819
- You're getting a call.
- Yes, sir.

522
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:28,697
That's my number, okay?

523
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,532
- Okay.
- Don't ignore it.

524
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:32,325
I'll text you my bank account number.

525
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:34,744
Yes, have a good day, sir.

526
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:38,039
I'll clean it up here. Have a good day.

530
00:32:44,546 --> 00:32:46,798
All right, see you tomorrow!

531
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,176
Do-yeon, show me your power!

532
00:32:49,259 --> 00:32:50,969
Go!

533
00:32:53,263 --> 00:32:54,431
Do-yeon!

534
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:56,308
Dad!

535
00:32:56,766 --> 00:32:58,977
- Hello, sir!
- Hi.

536
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:04,524
You look great as always!

537
00:33:04,608 --> 00:33:06,318
- Hello.
- Hi.

538
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:08,278
Do-yeon, let's say goodbye and go.

539
00:33:08,737 --> 00:33:09,696
Salute!

540
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:11,031
Salute!

541
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:12,491
See you tomorrow, Do-yeon.

542
00:33:12,574 --> 00:33:13,450
Let's go.

543
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:16,495
Oh, sorry.

544
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:19,372
I think it's going to take some time.

545
00:33:19,456 --> 00:33:20,457
Sure.

546
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:24,169
They even changed the login information
in that brief moment that night.

547
00:33:24,878 --> 00:33:26,171
They're total pros.

548
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:29,216
Okay, I'm sure you can sort it out.
I trust you.

549
00:33:29,299 --> 00:33:31,468
It's just that
there's a lot that I don't know.

550
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:32,969
I'm learning as I go.

551
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:35,430
- Okay.
- Goodbye.

552
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:37,224
Okay, then.

553
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:40,352
- Bye, Do-yeon.
- Goodbye!

554
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:48,318
Hello, sir.

555
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:49,778
Hey, Do-yeon.

556
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,196
- Have you been good?
- Yes.

557
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:53,823
So, all is good?

558
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:56,117
Dad, what does that mean?

559
00:33:56,785 --> 00:33:58,787
He's just asking how I'm doing.

560
00:34:01,206 --> 00:34:02,916
All is well with you, too, little bro?

561
00:34:03,333 --> 00:34:05,293
Of course, buddy.

562
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:10,173
Let's say goodbye to him and go.

563
00:34:10,257 --> 00:34:12,008
Goodbye, sir.

564
00:34:12,092 --> 00:34:13,260
Get home safely.

565
00:34:13,343 --> 00:34:14,636
- Okay.
- Bye.

583
00:36:55,088 --> 00:36:56,756
What a busy life.

THIRD EXPLOSION
ON AUG 22, 2025 AT 5:50 A.M.

585
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:59,027
We have a lot of deliveries this morning.
I made a list on the counter.

586
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,779
- Okay.
- I'll drop Min-seo off and be right over.

587
00:38:00,862 --> 00:38:02,697
- Prepare the packages while I'm gone.
- Got it.

588
00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:04,866
- Have a good day at school.
- Okay.

589
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:09,078
She's so cranky this morning.
She didn't even eat breakfast.

590
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:11,164
All because I won't buy her new sneakers.

591
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:15,627
Do you smell smoke?

592
00:38:17,504 --> 00:38:18,963
Is someone burning something?

593
00:38:20,048 --> 00:38:22,217
Anyway, drive safe.
Don't let your temper make you speed.

594
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:25,303
- What temper?
- What? I didn't say anything. See you.

595
00:38:43,363 --> 00:38:45,448
If your grades improve
in the next midterm period,

596
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:48,618
I'll get you those crazy sneakers.

597
00:38:49,911 --> 00:38:52,247
Really? You promise?

598
00:38:53,248 --> 00:38:54,499
Really, Mom?

599
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:57,210
Of course. Have I ever lied?

600
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:58,586
Never mind if you don't want it.

601
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:02,131
Hey! You're making the van shake.

602
00:39:02,799 --> 00:39:04,759
Gosh, are you that happy?

603
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:06,094
Yeah, totally.

604
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:08,429
Mom, say that again
so that I can record it.

605
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:09,848
What?

606
00:39:09,931 --> 00:39:13,476
Come on. I'll listen to it
whenever I don't want to study.

607
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:15,728
My goodness.

608
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:20,400
Min-seo, it's me, your mom.

609
00:39:20,859 --> 00:39:23,403
If your grades improve
in the next midterm season,

610
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:27,574
I'll buy those crazy 500,000-won sneakers
for you.

611
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:30,285
But you get nothing
if your grades drop, okay?

612
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:31,828
Promise.

613
00:39:32,412 --> 00:39:33,746
Promise.

614
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:43,381
Was there an accident or something?

615
00:39:52,265 --> 00:39:54,225
Mom, I see firetrucks there.

616
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:56,102
That's the bus terminal, right?

617
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:00,648
Did the smoke smell come from there?

618
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:14,954
What happened?
Why have they blocked the road?

Unconscious?

622
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:36,601
Careful.

- Heading to work?
- Yes.

628
00:41:02,919 --> 00:41:04,629
Are you having a serious discussion?

629
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:07,465
Don't even get us started.
A bus exploded. It's crazy.

630
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:08,716
What?

631
00:41:08,925 --> 00:41:11,719
A bus exploded at the bus garage.

632
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:13,471
Did anyone get hurt?

633
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:15,181
No idea. We're just as in the dark.

634
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:17,600
Nobody won't tell us anything,
and it's not even on the news.

635
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:19,686
Oh, right.

636
00:41:19,769 --> 00:41:22,605
You must know,
since you work for an insurance company.

637
00:41:22,689 --> 00:41:26,401
Who are the first responders
when such an accident happens?

638
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:31,030
If it's a big one,
the police, ambulance, and firefighters.

639
00:41:31,114 --> 00:41:32,657
Insurance company people also come.

640
00:41:32,991 --> 00:41:34,826
See? That's normal.

641
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:36,869
What were soldiers doing there?

642
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:37,996
Soldiers?

643
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:40,790
I got a glimpse of the site
when I drove Min-seo to school

644
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:42,333
and saw military trucks.

645
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:45,962
Hello.

646
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:48,131
Even the Joint Chiefs
and the commander's lead car were there.

647
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:49,924
- Joint Chiefs and the commander?
- Yeah.

648
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:54,387
What do you mean?

649
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:57,932
There's Myeong-o's friend.
Min-seo's tutor.

650
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:01,144
Wait, I'll call him. I have his number.

651
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:03,479
Don't cry and stay put, okay?

652
00:42:04,272 --> 00:42:05,690
- Ms. Lee?
- Yes.

653
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:06,816
What did she say?

654
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:10,820
Myeong-o left for work,
but she can't reach him.

655
00:42:11,029 --> 00:42:13,072
He left early this morning
to catch the first bus.

656
00:42:13,156 --> 00:42:15,491
I'm sure he's fine.

657
00:42:19,162 --> 00:42:22,373
Hello, this is Min-seo's mom.

658
00:42:22,457 --> 00:42:25,209
Have you talked to Myeong-o today,
by any chance?

659
00:42:28,504 --> 00:42:31,174
There's been an accident,
and your son was...

660
00:42:33,176 --> 00:42:34,260
Ma'am!

661
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:36,637
- Call the ambulance!
- Let's take my car.

662
00:42:36,721 --> 00:42:37,764
- I got her!
- Okay!

663
00:42:37,847 --> 00:42:39,098
Please help.

664
00:42:39,182 --> 00:42:40,933
- Here we go.
- Pull yourself together!

665
00:42:45,021 --> 00:42:45,980
So,

666
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:50,318
soldiers cleaned up the intersection
after the explosion,

667
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:54,614
and firefighters cleaned up
the ATM explosion in combat boots.

668
00:42:55,198 --> 00:42:57,200
Now, when the bus terminal blew up,

669
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:00,453
the Joint Chiefs
and the commander's lead car came?

670
00:43:01,329 --> 00:43:02,455
Yes.

671
00:43:02,914 --> 00:43:03,998
And all three were explosions.

672
00:43:04,457 --> 00:43:07,460
You said you saw ashy smoke
in the car crash at the intersection, too.

673
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:09,754
Su-il remembers it very clearly.

674
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:12,799
The same thing happened
in the ATM explosion.

675
00:43:13,091 --> 00:43:14,759
Chun-bae saw the explosion this morning.

676
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:16,344
More ashy smoke.

677
00:43:21,182 --> 00:43:22,100
A C-4.

678
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:25,394
It must've been a C-4.

679
00:43:25,895 --> 00:43:27,980
Of course, it could be a modified bomb.

680
00:43:29,774 --> 00:43:30,817
Ours again?

681
00:43:31,651 --> 00:43:32,610
You sure?

682
00:43:32,985 --> 00:43:34,987
This is driving me nuts.

683
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:38,533
I know you're in there.

684
00:43:39,492 --> 00:43:40,493
Let's talk later.

685
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,876
Why the hell aren't you
picking up your damn phone?

686
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,461
Did you call?

687
00:43:50,545 --> 00:43:52,880
Oh, you called a lot.

688
00:43:53,548 --> 00:43:55,675
It's better to see you in person, anyway.

689
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:56,634
You kidding me?

690
00:43:57,718 --> 00:44:00,721
Two people died in a bus explosion.

691
00:44:00,805 --> 00:44:02,974
And one is barely hanging on in the ICU.

692
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:05,309
Lower your voice, will you?

693
00:44:05,685 --> 00:44:07,228
You think this is your living room?

694
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:14,569
It just wouldn't be good
to have people outside hear us.

695
00:44:15,236 --> 00:44:16,237
Have a seat.

696
00:44:21,784 --> 00:44:23,494
What sneaky stuff
have you done behind my back

697
00:44:23,578 --> 00:44:25,413
that we have something blowing off
every day?

698
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:28,833
And why is it my Kiyun-si, of all places?

699
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:32,712
Everyone's already making a big deal
about Sullivan pulling out

700
00:44:32,795 --> 00:44:36,174
and making the plan
for the specialized zone become nothing!

701
00:44:36,257 --> 00:44:37,842
You should be helping, not doing this!

702
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:39,635
You think I know what's going on?

703
00:44:39,886 --> 00:44:42,263
This is a headache for me, too, okay?

704
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:44,307
I have to clean up the mess,
shush the prosecution and the police,

705
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:45,892
and stop the press!

706
00:44:45,975 --> 00:44:48,102
I haven't even had time
for a sauna lately.

707
00:44:48,186 --> 00:44:49,770
You know I've got a bad shoulder, right?

708
00:44:49,854 --> 00:44:51,898
From getting tortured back in the day?

709
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:55,359
You're awfully good at keeping secrets

710
00:44:56,736 --> 00:44:58,279
for someone who's shit at everything.

711
00:44:58,988 --> 00:45:01,490
Why won't anyone tell me anything?

712
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:05,411
I'm asking you what's been exploding!

713
00:45:05,494 --> 00:45:08,831
You're to become
the nation's leader one day!

714
00:45:08,915 --> 00:45:11,167
Don't say stuff like "shit."

715
00:45:12,877 --> 00:45:16,547
You're already on the same boat as I am.

716
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:19,675
I also went all-in on making Kiyun-si
a specialized tourism zone.

717
00:45:19,759 --> 00:45:24,096
That's why I'm busy cleaning the mess
before everything falls apart.

718
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:26,140
Just tell me what's going on!

719
00:45:26,224 --> 00:45:29,852
How am I supposed to know?
I'm still figuring it out too!

720
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:38,110
Minister Kim, are you sure
you don't know anything?

721
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:41,072
It's my responsibility
to clean up this mess, isn't it?

722
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:45,534
So leave it to me
and cut the bullshit, okay?

723
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:55,795
I'll kill you if you pull anything stupid
behind my back.

724
00:46:04,804 --> 00:46:07,974
I ought to put a bullet
in that rude bitch.

725
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:10,059
Damn it.

726
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:53,019
OUR DEEPEST CONDOLENCES

727
00:46:53,102 --> 00:46:56,022
MAY THE DECEASED REST IN PEACE

728
00:46:56,105 --> 00:46:59,358
KIM MYEONG-O

729
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:13,914
They say people live up to their names.

730
00:47:14,415 --> 00:47:16,792
You really are the strongest
when it comes to being nosy.

731
00:47:17,626 --> 00:47:20,046
I can't believe you're going to a funeral
for someone you've never even met.

732
00:47:20,379 --> 00:47:24,342
All the neighborhood leaders
knew him well.

733
00:47:24,633 --> 00:47:28,554
My friend's friend is also my friend.
How could I turn a blind eye?

734
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:31,140
He was the only son of a single mother,

735
00:47:31,432 --> 00:47:32,892
graduated from Hanguk University,

736
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:35,478
and spent three years working part-time
while looking for a job.

737
00:47:35,895 --> 00:47:37,688
Then he finally got
a big corporate job recently.

738
00:47:39,732 --> 00:47:43,027
It was his first day at work,
and he died on the way.

739
00:47:43,778 --> 00:47:46,113
You make it sound
like he was your best friend.

740
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:49,116
I wasn't going to go this far,

741
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:54,705
but the bestie
of my bestie's bestie is also my bestie.

742
00:47:55,039 --> 00:47:57,458
And you're my bestie for life,

743
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:59,293
- so you should--
- Enough.

744
00:48:00,169 --> 00:48:02,963
Give a good amount of consolation money,
but not too much.

745
00:48:04,256 --> 00:48:05,174
Yes, ma'am.

746
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:09,720
Don't go out.
Stay home with Do-yeon, okay?

747
00:48:09,804 --> 00:48:12,056
If you need anything,
just let me get it for you, like always.

748
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:13,224
Okay, just go.

749
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:17,436
FUNERAL HALL 1
Did you say you need her permission?

750
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:20,648
- Of course, I do.
- Really?

751
00:48:25,277 --> 00:48:30,783
Man, I used to feel so bad for Su-il
for having such a controlling wife,

752
00:48:31,033 --> 00:48:34,036
but here you are, just like him.

753
00:48:34,245 --> 00:48:36,580
Controlling? No, I'm just playing along.

754
00:48:36,872 --> 00:48:38,290
You need her permission
to go to a funeral.

755
00:48:38,374 --> 00:48:40,292
How's that playing along?
You're totally whipped.

756
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:44,713
You don't seem the type,
but you're surprisingly sharp.

757
00:48:45,798 --> 00:48:48,384
What are these reporters
doing here anyway?

758
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:50,052
To interview the bereaved?

759
00:48:50,219 --> 00:48:52,471
They're not asking anyone anything.

760
00:48:52,972 --> 00:48:54,598
I guess a high-ranking official is here.

761
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:56,517
Let's go.

762
00:49:09,447 --> 00:49:10,448
- She's here!
- She's here!

763
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:21,876
The only thing improving
is my acting these days.

764
00:49:23,043 --> 00:49:24,336
All right, let's go.

765
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:30,009
- What's going on in Kiyun-si?
- Please tell us!

766
00:49:30,092 --> 00:49:31,760
- What do you have to say?
- What happened?

767
00:49:31,844 --> 00:49:33,387
- Please look this way!
- What's going on?

768
00:49:33,471 --> 00:49:35,389
- Ma'am!
- What'll happen now?

769
00:49:36,348 --> 00:49:39,518
Please let me pay my respects
before taking questions.

770
00:49:39,602 --> 00:49:41,687
- What's the scale of the damage?
- How many casualties?

771
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:43,856
- Please tell us!
- What happens now?

772
00:49:43,939 --> 00:49:46,233
- Please say something.
- Just one thing!

773
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:26,315
You must stay strong, ma'am.

774
00:50:27,608 --> 00:50:30,903
I can't live on.

775
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:34,865
My son...

776
00:50:38,577 --> 00:50:42,748
I can't live without my son.

777
00:50:42,831 --> 00:50:45,918
My Myeong-o...

778
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:49,964
Please bring him back.

779
00:50:52,174 --> 00:50:54,969
Myeong-o, take me with you!

780
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:57,721
Take me with you!

781
00:50:57,805 --> 00:50:58,847
Ma'am.

782
00:51:01,433 --> 00:51:05,688
I promise to investigate
the cause of Myeong-o's death.

783
00:51:07,189 --> 00:51:11,944
Thank you so much. My Myeong-o...

784
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:20,202
Why are you here? What about the store?

785
00:51:20,286 --> 00:51:23,539
I closed it for a bit
and came with Chun-bae.

786
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:25,916
I said we should work in shifts.
You couldn't even wait that long?

787
00:51:27,001 --> 00:51:29,003
Don't be so cruel.

788
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:32,464
Closing your business for a few hours
for your dead neighbor isn't--

789
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,135
You think it's because of the money?

790
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:39,346
We're the only functioning grocery store
in the neighborhood.

791
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:42,391
I'm worried about those
who urgently need anything from the store.

792
00:51:46,228 --> 00:51:47,354
Eat quickly and go.

793
00:51:47,438 --> 00:51:49,315
Yeah, I don't have an appetite, anyway.

794
00:51:50,316 --> 00:51:52,318
What a woman.

795
00:51:52,818 --> 00:51:55,988
Why do you always use me as an excuse?
I came here alone.

796
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:58,282
Are you a bad friend, or just clueless?

797
00:51:58,365 --> 00:51:59,366
Just eat your food.

798
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:06,373
FUNERAL HALL

799
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:20,012
I think we're done for the day now.

800
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:22,890
Come and eat some.
You haven't eaten all day.

801
00:52:23,932 --> 00:52:25,517
I'm fine.

802
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:33,692
Ms. Lee needs you to stay strong
more than anyone right now.

803
00:52:33,776 --> 00:52:36,028
You can't faint with her.

804
00:52:36,111 --> 00:52:38,614
Come and have something to eat.

805
00:52:59,802 --> 00:53:02,596
- Hey, Yong-hui.
- Hello.

806
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:04,515
Sorry, I'm late.
I had to close up the gym.

807
00:53:05,933 --> 00:53:07,476
Go and greet Myeong-o.

808
00:53:07,726 --> 00:53:08,811
Okay.

809
00:53:10,354 --> 00:53:11,563
Myeong-o...

810
00:53:12,981 --> 00:53:14,233
My goodness...

811
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:20,739
You haven't eaten, have you?

812
00:53:20,823 --> 00:53:22,533
No, I ate. Stay seated.

813
00:53:27,788 --> 00:53:30,416
This is Min-seo's tutor.

814
00:53:30,624 --> 00:53:32,835
He's Myeong-o's friend.
Myeong-o introduced him to me.

815
00:53:33,585 --> 00:53:36,422
And this is the manager
of Special Martial Arts Yongmu Gym.

816
00:53:36,505 --> 00:53:38,090
He used to be
a close neighbor of Myeong-o.

817
00:53:38,424 --> 00:53:40,676
I see. I'm Park Jeong-hwan.

818
00:53:40,759 --> 00:53:42,636
I'm Lee Yong-hui.

819
00:53:43,178 --> 00:53:44,555
You must be heartbroken.

820
00:53:45,806 --> 00:53:46,640
Yes.

821
00:53:51,979 --> 00:53:52,896
You know,

822
00:53:54,982 --> 00:53:56,775
I still can't believe it.

823
00:53:59,153 --> 00:54:00,362
None of us can.

824
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:05,325
Ms. Lee says she feels like
Myeong-o will come in any minute,

825
00:54:05,743 --> 00:54:09,204
still in his suit, saying, "I'm home!"

826
00:54:10,497 --> 00:54:15,169
I wish I could've seen him in his suit.

827
00:54:24,803 --> 00:54:25,804
Here.

828
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:30,017
Oh, it's Myeong-o.

829
00:54:33,228 --> 00:54:34,813
- My gosh.
- Look at him.

830
00:54:34,897 --> 00:54:39,568
Our Myeong-o suited up nicely for work.
He even wore a tie and everything.

831
00:54:40,152 --> 00:54:41,820
I know, gosh.

832
00:54:41,904 --> 00:54:43,489
Oh, would you like something?

833
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:45,991
I just need to use the bathroom.

834
00:54:46,074 --> 00:54:46,992
Okay.

835
00:54:56,668 --> 00:54:58,295
<i>There's a stuffed bunny.</i>
<i>A gift for someone?</i>

836
00:54:58,378 --> 00:54:59,797
This one's a video.

837
00:55:00,881 --> 00:55:03,300
<i>It must be so nice to start the day</i>
<i>with a surprise gift like that.</i>

838
00:55:16,605 --> 00:55:17,773
What's wrong, Yong-hui?

839
00:55:18,357 --> 00:55:20,108
I need to go.

840
00:55:23,779 --> 00:55:25,030
What's with him?

841
00:55:34,957 --> 00:55:35,999
Byeong-nam!

842
00:55:36,416 --> 00:55:37,251
What?

843
00:55:38,043 --> 00:55:40,087
- You know the bunny?
- What about them?

844
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:43,632
The bus was on the bunny!

845
00:55:43,715 --> 00:55:45,217
What are you talking about?

846
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:47,344
Wake up! How could a bus be on a...

847
00:55:50,681 --> 00:55:52,391
- A bunny?
- Yes!

848
00:55:52,808 --> 00:55:55,936
There was a stuffed bunny

849
00:55:56,270 --> 00:55:58,897
sitting on the bus!

850
00:55:58,981 --> 00:56:02,025
- How do you know?
- Myeong-o took a video of it.

851
00:56:02,109 --> 00:56:05,362
- Can I see it? Let's see.
- Yes!

852
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:10,909
THIS IS A PRIVATE ACCOUNT

853
00:56:10,993 --> 00:56:11,827
It's private.

854
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:13,537
What? Where is it?

855
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:16,081
I don't follow Myeong-o
on social media, so...

856
00:56:16,164 --> 00:56:19,042
- Come on, how can we see it?
- How did you see it?

857
00:56:19,126 --> 00:56:20,961
At the funeral hall.

858
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:24,965
On Myeong-o's friend's phone.

859
00:56:39,187 --> 00:56:40,355
Excuse me.

860
00:56:42,024 --> 00:56:44,776
Could we see Myeong-o's post from earlier?

861
00:56:55,621 --> 00:56:58,165
- This thing, right?
- Right.

862
00:56:58,248 --> 00:57:01,627
The stuffed bunnies at the recycling area
also had a sweet and oily scent.

863
00:57:01,919 --> 00:57:03,420
What do you mean?

864
00:57:04,212 --> 00:57:05,339
The C-4.

865
00:57:05,547 --> 00:57:06,632
What?

866
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:08,091
A bomb?

867
00:57:08,884 --> 00:57:10,093
What do you mean?

868
00:57:14,139 --> 00:57:17,017
You left after looking at these photos.
What's going on?

869
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:18,810
Oh, I mean...

870
00:57:18,894 --> 00:57:20,979
Just tell me everything.

871
00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:23,315
This is my friend we're talking about.

872
00:57:29,196 --> 00:57:32,324
There seems to have been
a bomb on the bus.

873
00:57:39,957 --> 00:57:41,667
Who would've put it there?

874
00:57:44,419 --> 00:57:46,254
Who would've done that?

875
00:57:46,546 --> 00:57:49,591
It's dangerous, so we'll sort it--

876
00:57:49,675 --> 00:57:50,801
No.

877
00:57:52,052 --> 00:57:53,136
I...

878
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:56,890
I want to find

879
00:57:58,850 --> 00:57:59,893
the bastard

880
00:58:00,978 --> 00:58:02,354
behind all this.

881
00:58:31,550 --> 00:58:34,678
SPECIAL MARTIAL ARTS YONGMU GYM

882
00:58:37,055 --> 00:58:39,266
Good, but tilt it up a bit.

883
00:58:41,143 --> 00:58:42,561
Thanks for working so hard in the heat.

884
00:58:42,853 --> 00:58:44,730
- Please be thorough.
- Yes, of course.

885
00:58:44,813 --> 00:58:45,772
Okay.

886
00:58:52,404 --> 00:58:55,407
I keep my promises.

887
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:58,618
We're installing smart AI security cameras

888
00:58:58,702 --> 00:59:03,665
to ensure safety
for the Changri-dong residents.

889
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:07,044
I know you must be so worried.

890
00:59:07,461 --> 00:59:08,503
Of course.

891
00:59:08,587 --> 00:59:11,923
How can there be so many accidents
in Changri-dong nonstop?

892
00:59:15,469 --> 00:59:19,556
I'll make sure accidents like this
never happen again.

893
00:59:23,185 --> 00:59:25,187
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

894
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:28,190
These are getting set up
in front of schools too, right?

895
00:59:28,273 --> 00:59:31,359
What a joke. Fussing over cameras
after everything's already happened.

896
00:59:31,610 --> 00:59:32,903
Honey, she might hear you.

897
00:59:32,986 --> 00:59:34,321
I don't care if she does.

898
00:59:34,654 --> 00:59:36,573
Actually, I hope she hears me.

899
00:59:37,949 --> 00:59:40,952
They're going to monitor us with those.

900
00:59:41,495 --> 00:59:43,038
Hey, bad news for you.

901
00:59:43,622 --> 00:59:47,334
Even Choi Kang, the man of no comments,
can't escape all those cameras, can you?

902
00:59:48,668 --> 00:59:51,505
You want to bet
on whether I can escape them or not?

903
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:56,426
I'll bet 500 won that I can't.

904
00:59:56,843 --> 00:59:58,261
You bet that I can, little bro.

905
01:00:00,806 --> 01:00:02,307
Stay right here, okay?

906
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:05,143
I'll bring a gun right over
and actually shoot you.

907
01:00:05,435 --> 01:00:07,104
You're too gullible.

908
01:00:07,354 --> 01:00:09,815
- What?
- It's so much fun to tease you.

909
01:00:11,191 --> 01:00:12,234
Stop it.

910
01:00:12,859 --> 01:00:13,902
I told you to stop.

911
01:00:14,861 --> 01:00:17,614
Hey, I'm telling you, cut it out.

912
01:00:17,697 --> 01:00:19,199
Stop. I'm getting my gun.

913
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:35,006
Online security cameras. That's great.

914
01:00:35,841 --> 01:00:37,843
Why? You can't hide from those?

915
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:41,847
That's not it. If that's online,

916
01:00:41,930 --> 01:00:44,307
the satellite computer guys
must be watching them, too.

917
01:00:44,558 --> 01:00:46,101
But what would you know?

918
01:00:46,852 --> 01:00:48,854
So what? What are you going to do?

919
01:00:49,771 --> 01:00:51,189
Play along, of course.

920
01:00:56,903 --> 01:00:58,363
Are you crazy?

921
01:00:58,446 --> 01:01:00,365
I'm not crazy. They are.

922
01:01:07,122 --> 01:01:10,458
- One, two, three.
- Two, three.

923
01:01:12,294 --> 01:01:15,088
- Wait. One, two, three.
- Three.

924
01:01:15,172 --> 01:01:17,424
- Yeah, you jerks. Take this.
- Take this.

925
01:01:17,507 --> 01:01:19,384
- Take this.
- Take this.

926
01:01:19,467 --> 01:01:21,845
- Take this.
- You little rats.

927
01:01:44,993 --> 01:01:46,369
<i>Take this, too.</i>

928
01:01:46,995 --> 01:01:49,456
<i>- Keep going.</i>
<i>- Take this. Come on.</i>

929
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:51,791
<i>One, two, three, go!</i>

930
01:02:35,710 --> 01:02:38,630
HEROES NEXT DOOR

931
01:02:38,713 --> 01:02:41,716
<i>It seems to have something to do</i>
<i>with the explosions in Kiyun-si.</i>

932
01:02:42,050 --> 01:02:43,009
THEY'RE LISTENING, SHUSH

933
01:02:43,093 --> 01:02:44,761
<i>Why are you telling me all this?</i>

934
01:02:45,428 --> 01:02:46,346
WHAT IF WE USE IT AGAINST THEM?

935
01:02:46,429 --> 01:02:49,015
<i>I brought something from Unit 203.</i>

936
01:02:49,099 --> 01:02:51,309
The computer signal disconnected
at the police station,

937
01:02:51,393 --> 01:02:52,894
so these guys will go there.

938
01:02:52,978 --> 01:02:54,854
<i>What are you guys plotting?</i>

939
01:02:54,938 --> 01:02:57,941
<i>People in our neighborhood are dying.</i>
<i>We need to do something.</i>

940
01:02:58,942 --> 01:03:00,318
<i>A bomb threat in Kiyun-si?</i>

941
01:03:00,402 --> 01:03:01,278
- Stay back.
- Let me through.

942
01:03:01,361 --> 01:03:02,821
Arrest them right now
and interrogate them.

943
01:03:02,904 --> 01:03:03,989
<i>Who are you?</i>

944
01:03:04,072 --> 01:03:05,365
<i>How did you know about this place?</i>

945
01:03:06,283 --> 01:03:08,285
