HEROES NEXT DOOR

2
00:00:41,834 --> 00:00:42,751
THIS DRAMA IS A WORK OF FICTION.
ALL CHARACTERS, PROFESSIONS, PLACES,

3
00:00:42,835 --> 00:00:43,752
COMPANIES, ORGANIZATIONS,
ETHNIC GROUPS AND EVENTS ARE NOT REAL.

4
00:00:43,836 --> 00:00:44,962
ALL CHILD AND ANIMAL SCENES WERE FILMED
SAFELY UNDER EXPERT SUPERVISION.

5
00:03:55,611 --> 00:03:57,905
It's me. The site is clear.

6
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,615
The kids are heading to the ground floor.

7
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:01,283
Check the outside.

8
00:04:15,631 --> 00:04:17,799
<i>Sierra-Kilo. The outside is clear.</i>

9
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:19,593
<i>The kids have arrived on the ground floor.</i>

10
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:21,136
<i>The man with the backpack is on the move.</i>

11
00:04:40,364 --> 00:04:41,573
Dad.

12
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:46,411
Do-yeon.

13
00:04:49,373 --> 00:04:50,457
Dad.

14
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,876
Do-yeon!

15
00:04:53,377 --> 00:04:54,545
Dad!

16
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,422
Daddy!

17
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:01,426
Dad.

18
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:02,970
Do-yeon!

19
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:06,139
Oh, gosh.

20
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:08,267
Wait.

21
00:05:09,685 --> 00:05:12,771
Why were you sleeping in my room?

22
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:19,444
My poor daddy. Is Mom mad at you again?

23
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:21,446
Poor guy.

24
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:24,533
No, I came to see you

25
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:26,034
and fell asleep.

26
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:29,288
Are you not feeling well?

27
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:37,379
No, I'm not. My stomach hurts.

28
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:39,715
Because you're so heavy.

29
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:54,688
Let's get up now.

30
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:56,899
We have to get up
and get you to kindergarten.

31
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,902
- Get washed up.
- Okay.

32
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:15,000
<i>An ATM booth in Kiyun-si</i>
<i>exploded late last night,</i>

33
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:18,295
BUTANE GAS, MY ASS
<i>killing a foreigner inside the booth.</i>

34
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,005
<i>The police said he purchased butane gas</i>

35
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:22,049
<i>at a nearby convenience store,</i>

36
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:25,010
<i>then entered the ATM booth,</i>
<i>which immediately exploded violently.</i>

37
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:27,137
<i>The said ATM booth has been</i>
<i>completely destroyed.</i>

38
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:31,266
<i>Two civilians nearby sustained</i>
<i>minor injuries from flying particles.</i>

39
00:06:31,517 --> 00:06:34,686
<i>The victim recently arrived in Korea</i>
<i>on a short-term visa</i>

40
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:36,605
<i>- and had been working at a factory</i>
- My goodness.

41
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:38,273
<i>- on the outskirts of Kiyun-si...</i>
<i>-</i> You're lucky you're fine.

42
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:41,318
You were supposed to take out the trash.
What were you even doing?

43
00:06:41,652 --> 00:06:43,612
I told you I was just on a walk.

44
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:45,447
How could I have expected an explosion?

45
00:06:46,198 --> 00:06:48,242
What a disaster. And we just moved.

46
00:06:48,951 --> 00:06:51,245
Invite your colleagues
for a housewarming party.

47
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:53,247
A housewarming party?

48
00:06:53,372 --> 00:06:56,458
If the Sullivan case closes,
and the housing prices flop...

49
00:06:57,751 --> 00:07:01,755
Anyway, you have to keep your job
until Do-yeon goes to college.

50
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:05,467
I'll host a housewarming party
and impress your supervisors.

51
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:08,345
That sounds like a grand plan.

52
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:11,932
I thought you just wanted
to interrogate my colleagues.

53
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,437
Shall I start yet another fun day
of winning that bread?

54
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:39,710
Butane gas, my ass.

55
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,678
<i>They have power over news outlets</i>
<i>and even mobilized the military.</i>

56
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:51,597
ARMY18 8285
<i>Could he have been a runaway soldier?</i>

57
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:55,267
<i>A foreigner with a muffled gun,</i>
<i>an MK 2 at that.</i>

58
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,227
<i>Is he a terrorist? In Korea?</i>

59
00:07:57,728 --> 00:07:59,771
<i>Or a deserter?</i>

60
00:08:00,731 --> 00:08:03,567
In just a few hours,
they cleaned up everything,

61
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:05,819
determined the cause of the explosion,

62
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:09,031
and even brought new ATMs.

63
00:08:09,907 --> 00:08:12,743
Hooray to Korea.

64
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:16,455
No country is faster than ours.
Isn't that right?

65
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,207
No, it's not.

66
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:21,251
All of this is so suspicious to me.

67
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:24,630
It's suspiciously fast, indeed.

68
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:27,674
Do you remember the color of the flame

69
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:30,219
when the explosion went off last night?

70
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:32,596
The color of the flame?

71
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:34,556
Flames can have all sorts of colors.

72
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,391
Was it red or yellow?

73
00:08:36,475 --> 00:08:39,144
I panicked and immediately ducked.

74
00:08:39,228 --> 00:08:40,854
How could I have seen the color?

75
00:08:40,938 --> 00:08:42,064
I need to get to work.

76
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:46,985
Right, only soldiers from major units
know the color difference.

77
00:08:47,069 --> 00:08:51,406
But you didn't even serve in the military,
so how would you know?

78
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:00,916
Butane gas, my ass.

79
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:06,380
REPORT ON THE ACCIDENT
AT THE KIYUN INTERSECTION

80
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:11,969
HWANG SEOG-WAN, AGE 41,
DELIVERYMAN, PART-TIME STORE EMPLOYEE...

81
00:09:15,097 --> 00:09:17,474
Good morning, Saint Choi.

82
00:09:17,975 --> 00:09:20,853
I'm fine, thank you, and you?

83
00:09:21,645 --> 00:09:22,813
Fine, thank you.

84
00:09:24,273 --> 00:09:25,524
What a surprise.

85
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:27,359
You finished yesterday's report
without trouble.

86
00:09:30,821 --> 00:09:33,532
You face. Did you get into a fight?

87
00:09:34,116 --> 00:09:35,409
Did your wife beat you?

88
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:37,077
Didn't you see the news?

89
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,162
About the butane gas explosion
at the Kiyun Intersection.

90
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:42,833
I was there.
This is my scar from surviving.

91
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,585
You were on the news?

92
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:46,795
What a celebrity.

93
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:50,757
That neighborhood is so chaotic.

94
00:09:50,841 --> 00:09:53,635
A car explosion one night,
then a butane gas explosion the next?

95
00:09:53,886 --> 00:09:56,847
What is all this mess?

96
00:09:58,223 --> 00:09:59,516
They let this kid out.

97
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,185
Which kid?

98
00:10:01,852 --> 00:10:03,478
The guy who ran over Sullivan's daughter.

99
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:06,356
I saw it coming, as he's the son
of the Speaker of the National Assembly,

100
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,817
and of course, he's off the hook.

101
00:10:08,901 --> 00:10:10,319
No surprise there.

102
00:10:10,402 --> 00:10:11,445
Is the final verdict out?

103
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:12,571
Yes, just now.

104
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:17,576
Law and order, my ass.

105
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:18,702
JAMES SULLIVAN CASE FINAL VERDICT

106
00:10:21,622 --> 00:10:23,957
SUPREME COURT RULES MR. KWON AS NOT GUILTY

107
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:27,002
I'm doomed.

108
00:10:27,753 --> 00:10:29,338
He's coming!

109
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:30,589
- He's coming!
- He's out!

110
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:32,049
- Excuse me!
- Hello?

111
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:34,384
- Over here!
- A word, please!

112
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:37,846
How do you feel about the final verdict?

113
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:40,140
Are you planning to file a civil suit?

114
00:10:46,063 --> 00:10:49,233
Do you plan on a financial retaliation
by scrapping your investment plans, then?

115
00:10:54,947 --> 00:10:59,034
Everyone, is Korea all about money?

116
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:01,912
Let's go.

117
00:11:03,914 --> 00:11:06,166

REAL ESTATE TREND READERS
James Sullivan purchased

119
00:11:08,794 --> 00:11:12,297
a huge plot in Kiyun-si
to build an Asian hub in Korea.

120
00:11:12,631 --> 00:11:14,675
Yes, which led the government to announce

121
00:11:14,758 --> 00:11:17,886
a plan to build the biggest special zone
for IT tourism in Asia.

122
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:21,348
<i>But the final verdict today.</i>
<i>My goodness, what will they do now?</i>

123
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:25,185
<i>Why would he want to invest in a country</i>
<i>that freed the man who killed his kid?</i>

124
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:26,645
<i>I'd never do that if I were him.</i>

125
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:29,773
<i>So what will happen to the small investors</i>
<i>who invested everything they had now?</i>

126
00:11:29,857 --> 00:11:30,983
<i>Exactly.</i>

127
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:34,403
<i>Won't the plan for the specialized zone</i>
<i>become nothing once Sullivan pulls out?</i>

128
00:11:34,486 --> 00:11:38,365
<i>That's just a blow to the small investors</i>
<i>who trusted the government.</i>

129
00:11:38,782 --> 00:11:39,658
<i>Those poor folks.</i>

VEOTIGO INSURANCE

131
00:11:43,704 --> 00:11:45,622
Have you found the car involved
in the Kiyun Intersection accident?

132
00:11:46,123 --> 00:11:49,001
It's at the public junkyard.
I'm heading there now.

133
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:52,379
Not our client's car.
I'm asking about the other car.

134
00:11:52,796 --> 00:11:54,923
I'll find it, no matter what.

135
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:57,301
Don't go anywhere and just wait.

136
00:11:57,384 --> 00:12:00,470
As expected of our ace.
That was pretty cool.

137
00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:04,224
- Am I cool?
- Yes.

138
00:12:04,516 --> 00:12:05,767
- Am I?
- Yes.

139
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:10,189
My wife wants to set a date
for a housewarming party.

140
00:12:10,272 --> 00:12:12,691
Sounds great.
Announce it in the company group chat.

141
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:15,235

What? Why wouldn't the other car be here?

144
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:26,455
Why do you think? It's just not here.

145
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:28,790
But the record says
that this place scrapped the cars.

146
00:12:28,874 --> 00:12:30,876
There should be two cars, then.
Why is there only one?

147
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,127
Just show it to me already.

148
00:12:32,211 --> 00:12:34,922
I don't know about the car
that hit the victim's car.

149
00:12:35,005 --> 00:12:36,298
We only got the victim's car.

150
00:12:37,716 --> 00:12:39,134
That makes no sense.

151
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:42,012
You must know something.
You were there on site.

152
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:43,347
Just tell me.

153
00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:47,142
Why are you pestering me?
I'm busy! I don't know anything!

154
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:50,979
Go that way, turn left,

155
00:12:51,063 --> 00:12:53,273
and you'll see a car
with shattered windows.

156
00:12:53,357 --> 00:12:55,734
I don't know how it exploded,
but it's a total mess.

157
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:57,152
Check that and go.

158
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:28,809
<i>I wasn't the driver,</i>

159
00:13:28,892 --> 00:13:33,063
but I dove into a huge fire of ashes
to save others--

160
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:34,982
A fire of ashes.

161
00:13:35,774 --> 00:13:36,733
Watch out!

162
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:43,907
Were they both bombs?

163
00:14:19,318 --> 00:14:20,569
Man...

164
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:22,988
What the hell am I doing at this hour?

165
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:24,781
My knees.

166
00:14:24,865 --> 00:14:27,242
Where did they go?

167
00:14:30,245 --> 00:14:31,079
Gunshots?

168
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:42,132
<i>I definitely heard gunshots.</i>

169
00:14:59,191 --> 00:15:01,902
I knew it. I was right.

170
00:15:02,152 --> 00:15:04,404
That sneaky rascal.

171
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:07,241
He thought he could fool me.

172
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:30,138
You little rascal, show me your face.

173
00:15:32,641 --> 00:15:34,434
What? He's covered here, too?

174
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:43,777
How does this make any sense?

175
00:15:43,861 --> 00:15:47,990
A can of butane gas from a shop
caused an explosion, leading to a death

176
00:15:48,073 --> 00:15:49,491
and extensive damage to the building.

177
00:15:50,325 --> 00:15:54,997
And most importantly,
the locals are terrified.

178
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:58,709
Therefore, I will file a strong complaint

179
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:00,669
to the butane gas manufacturer...

180
00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:03,755
What nonsense is she saying?

181
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,718
I know. Someone died.
That's the most important thing here.

182
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:09,219
She's saying we're terrified.

183
00:16:09,303 --> 00:16:12,472
Clearly, that explosion
made her mouth explode, too.

184
00:16:12,556 --> 00:16:14,433
She's having a blast, yapping away.

185
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:16,518
- Who's that?
- Oh, my.

186
00:16:16,602 --> 00:16:18,312
- Hello.
- Hello.

187
00:16:18,979 --> 00:16:21,356
She's Na Eun-jae, a congresswoman.

188
00:16:21,773 --> 00:16:23,358
You don't have work today?

189
00:16:23,442 --> 00:16:24,943
- I'm out on business.
- I see.

190
00:16:25,027 --> 00:16:27,404
I was told I could meet Officer Park here.

191
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:30,824
Officer Park? That's him.

192
00:16:30,908 --> 00:16:32,075
- I see.
- Yes.

193
00:16:32,451 --> 00:16:33,535
What are they doing?

194
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:36,413
No idea. Just to yap, probably.

195
00:16:36,872 --> 00:16:40,375
If the butane gas was the issue,
she should've gone to the manufacturer.

196
00:16:40,459 --> 00:16:42,628
Why is she yapping away here?

197
00:16:42,711 --> 00:16:45,297
She's just trying to help
as a congresswoman.

198
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,965
Be a bit nicer.

199
00:16:47,049 --> 00:16:50,093
Exactly. How is she trying to help?

200
00:16:50,177 --> 00:16:52,221
It's not like she's doing
what really needs to be done.

201
00:16:54,473 --> 00:16:56,934
Excuse me!

202
00:16:57,309 --> 00:16:58,352
Hey.

203
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:02,231
Instead of stating the obvious,

204
00:17:02,314 --> 00:17:05,484
can you install some security cameras
with our tax money?

205
00:17:05,567 --> 00:17:07,569
People say security cameras
are everywhere in Korea,

206
00:17:07,653 --> 00:17:09,821
but we only have
a handful in our neighborhood.

207
00:17:09,905 --> 00:17:12,199
- Yes, we need one at the intersection.
- There are barely any.

208
00:17:14,076 --> 00:17:14,910
And you are?

209
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:16,912
Me?

210
00:17:20,249 --> 00:17:22,334
The 58th graduating class
of Kiyun Women's High School

211
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:24,419
and head of the Women's Association
of Changri-dong.

212
00:17:24,503 --> 00:17:29,049
You shook my hand at my store
during the elections.

213
00:17:30,008 --> 00:17:35,639
I was just about to talk about that.

214
00:17:36,098 --> 00:17:39,768
We'll establish a strong security system
to prevent this from recurring

215
00:17:39,852 --> 00:17:42,145
and install smart security cameras

216
00:17:42,229 --> 00:17:45,524
that can predict potential danger
and send alerts.

217
00:17:46,024 --> 00:17:48,694
- So, the newest model of cameras?
- Yes, good ones.

218
00:17:48,777 --> 00:17:50,404
- Indeed.
- I see.

219
00:17:50,487 --> 00:17:54,116
On top of that,

220
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:58,579
I'll make sure
to hold people legally accountable

221
00:17:58,996 --> 00:18:01,957
for the unfortunate incidents
that have recently happened in Kiyun-si.

222
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:03,375
Ma'am,

223
00:18:03,709 --> 00:18:05,252
it's time for your next appointment.

224
00:18:07,379 --> 00:18:09,339
- She's leaving?
- Is she?

225
00:18:09,423 --> 00:18:10,507
Oh, my.

226
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,426
- She's leaving.
- She's already leaving.

227
00:18:13,218 --> 00:18:16,722
She didn't stutter once.
Someone else definitely wrote her speech.

228
00:18:17,347 --> 00:18:19,141
She was always good at memorizing things.

229
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:32,321
What a bitch.

230
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:37,492
She thought
she was all that in high school,

231
00:18:37,576 --> 00:18:40,287
and now, she's just the head
of the Women's Association.

232
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,375
Minister Kim is on the phone.

233
00:18:45,459 --> 00:18:46,335
KIM SEOK-JUN

234
00:18:47,586 --> 00:18:48,545
Yes?

235
00:18:49,421 --> 00:18:51,423
I've patched things up for now.

236
00:18:52,508 --> 00:18:53,634
Go ahead.

237
00:18:57,221 --> 00:18:59,264
Butane gas? Are you serious?

238
00:18:59,598 --> 00:19:01,642
It'd sound questionable to anyone!

239
00:19:02,226 --> 00:19:03,852
Who distributed the press release?

240
00:19:07,481 --> 00:19:11,443
Sir, you need to tell me at least
how bad it is

241
00:19:11,527 --> 00:19:14,488
so I can act accordingly.

242
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:19,952
Stupid bastard in uniform.

243
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:22,996
Let's go.

244
00:19:24,164 --> 00:19:25,791
MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEFENSE

245
00:19:25,874 --> 00:19:29,336
Man, she can blabber on forever.

246
00:19:29,545 --> 00:19:32,130
How am I supposed to know
how bad it is already?

247
00:19:32,965 --> 00:19:34,466
What a little brat.

248
00:19:40,806 --> 00:19:44,142
<i>Everyone is talking about</i>
<i>Mr. Sullivan's post-trial comment.</i>

249
00:19:44,726 --> 00:19:47,271
<i>Today, the Supreme Court ruled</i>

250
00:19:47,354 --> 00:19:51,358
<i>Mr. Kwon, the defendant in the case</i>
<i>of Charlotte Sullivan's car crash,</i>

251
00:19:51,441 --> 00:19:53,360
<i>not guilty.</i>

252
00:20:01,743 --> 00:20:03,328
Okay, all done.

253
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:27,102
<i>Hey! Why aren't you reading my messages?</i>

254
00:20:28,979 --> 00:20:30,439
<i>I didn't see your message.</i>

255
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:50,792
<i>Are you an introvert?</i>

256
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:52,920
My personality?

257
00:20:59,927 --> 00:21:01,094
<i>Are you an extrovert?</i>

258
00:21:04,598 --> 00:21:05,641
<i>You're spot-on.</i>

259
00:21:06,225 --> 00:21:08,477
<i>Aren't you at school? What's up?</i>

260
00:21:09,353 --> 00:21:11,230
<i>What book are we using for our lessons?</i>

261
00:21:12,689 --> 00:21:15,317
<i>I'll get it for you. See you tomorrow.</i>

262
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,443
<i>Have a good day.</i>

263
00:21:18,654 --> 00:21:19,696
Yes, sir.

264
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:22,741
I'LL GET IT FOR YOU.
SEE YOU TOMORROW. HAVE A GOOD DAY.

265
00:21:22,908 --> 00:21:26,828
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight!

266
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:30,707
Two, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight!

267
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:34,753
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight!

268
00:21:34,837 --> 00:21:38,590
Two, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight!

269
00:21:38,674 --> 00:21:39,842
This way!

270
00:21:44,721 --> 00:21:46,682
Left, right, down, up!

271
00:21:46,765 --> 00:21:48,600
Left, right, down, up!

272
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:51,061
Kick!

273
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:53,355
- Special combat martial arts!
- Special combat martial arts!

274
00:21:53,438 --> 00:21:57,025
<i>I love you, baby</i>

275
00:21:57,109 --> 00:21:58,735
<i>I don't know the next lyrics!</i>

276
00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:02,406
Let's go!

277
00:22:08,453 --> 00:22:10,080
BUILDING STRONG BODIES WITH HARD TRAINING

278
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:13,292
Everyone, sit.

279
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:19,089
Can you all hear my cool voice?

280
00:22:19,173 --> 00:22:20,716
- Yes!
- Yes!

281
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,092
I can't hear you!

282
00:22:24,928 --> 00:22:26,138
Right on.

283
00:22:26,221 --> 00:22:29,808
Let's say you're having fun
all by yourself at the playground,

284
00:22:30,267 --> 00:22:32,561
and an adult you've never seen
approaches you

285
00:22:32,644 --> 00:22:36,857
and says, "Hey, I'm your dad's friend.

286
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:39,776
I'll buy you something yummy.
You want to come with me?"

287
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:40,944
What are you supposed to say?

288
00:22:41,028 --> 00:22:43,614
- "No!"
- "I'm not going!"

289
00:22:43,697 --> 00:22:44,823
Good job.

290
00:22:44,907 --> 00:22:49,161
But if your voice is too soft,
they might not hear you.

291
00:22:49,244 --> 00:22:50,662
In that case,

292
00:22:51,622 --> 00:22:53,749
blow the whistle. Go!

293
00:22:59,755 --> 00:23:01,340
All right! Stop!

294
00:23:03,842 --> 00:23:05,010
Stop it!

295
00:23:05,969 --> 00:23:07,137
Good job.

296
00:23:07,429 --> 00:23:12,017
Then let's say that our class is over,
and you're on your way home by yourself.

297
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,560
And an adult you don't know
comes and says,

298
00:23:13,644 --> 00:23:18,607
"Oh, gosh, your mother is very unwell.
Let me take you to the hospital."

299
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:19,525
What do you say?

300
00:23:19,608 --> 00:23:24,947
- "What's wrong with Mom?"
- "Which hospital?"

301
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:27,032
No, that's not it.

302
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:30,244
Right on!

303
00:23:30,911 --> 00:23:33,205
Everyone, applaud Do-yeon!

304
00:23:33,288 --> 00:23:34,957
Good job, Do-yeon!

305
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,959
You must blow the whistle, okay?

306
00:23:37,042 --> 00:23:38,418
Oh, my!

307
00:23:38,502 --> 00:23:40,420
- Hello, there.
- Hi.

308
00:23:40,504 --> 00:23:42,548
Do-yeon, you're the best.

309
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:50,055
Dad, if I meet a bad adult,
I'll scare them with my whistle.

310
00:23:50,138 --> 00:23:53,100
Yes, make their ears bleed.

311
00:23:53,183 --> 00:23:54,017
Okay.

312
00:23:54,935 --> 00:23:57,771
We have a new art teacher in kindergarten.
Her name's Olivia.

313
00:23:58,564 --> 00:23:59,982
- Olivia?
- Yes.

314
00:24:00,065 --> 00:24:02,901
"Blah, blah."
She only speaks in English, like this.

315
00:24:02,985 --> 00:24:06,196
Oh, an English-speaking teacher
who goes, "Blah, blah"?

316
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,114
Yes.

317
00:24:08,156 --> 00:24:09,366
You're so funny.

318
00:24:10,158 --> 00:24:10,993
Right.

319
00:24:11,076 --> 00:24:14,121
Mom is cranky today,
so don't ask her to play videos for you.

320
00:24:15,289 --> 00:24:17,291
But I'll buy you a sticker.

321
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:20,752
- Don't tell Mom, okay?
- Okay.

322
00:24:21,295 --> 00:24:22,713
- It's a secret.
- Secret.

323
00:24:22,796 --> 00:24:24,506
- Blah, blah.
- Blah, blah.

324
00:24:29,678 --> 00:24:31,847
- Hello, everyone.
- Hey.

325
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:33,265
- Salute.
- Hello.

326
00:24:33,348 --> 00:24:34,641
Salute.

327
00:24:36,101 --> 00:24:39,229
Officer Park,
how about we slap some caffeine into us?

328
00:24:39,313 --> 00:24:40,606
I'd have to arrest you for slapping.

329
00:24:40,689 --> 00:24:42,524
Sure, arrest me after we slap some in.

330
00:24:45,152 --> 00:24:48,030
Man, I'm so popular today.

331
00:24:48,113 --> 00:24:51,366
- Have a good day, everyone.
- Bye.

332
00:24:51,867 --> 00:24:54,119
CHANGRI POLICE STATION

333
00:24:56,246 --> 00:24:58,290
Did someone else come by to see you?

334
00:24:58,832 --> 00:25:02,294
I had to go to the ATM explosion site
for a congresswoman's press conference,

335
00:25:02,377 --> 00:25:05,047
and some guy came to ask endless questions
about the Kiyun Intersection accident.

336
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:07,132
The Kiyun Intersection accident? Who?

337
00:25:07,716 --> 00:25:09,510
Someone from the SIU?

338
00:25:10,093 --> 00:25:12,596
Was he from the government?

339
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:15,307
No, he was an investigator
for an insurance company.

340
00:25:16,058 --> 00:25:19,019
The guy who was with you
when the explosion happened.

341
00:25:20,812 --> 00:25:23,524
Oh, so that's his job? The See You Team?

342
00:25:25,567 --> 00:25:26,818
It's SIU.

343
00:25:26,902 --> 00:25:28,654
- Yes, SIU.
- Yes.

344
00:25:28,904 --> 00:25:29,821
So why are you here?

345
00:25:30,697 --> 00:25:32,824
Me? Well,

346
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,577
I wanted to know more about the man
who died in the ATM booth.

347
00:25:35,661 --> 00:25:38,747
The police are in charge of it now,
so I don't know.

348
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:40,499
The news says the case has been closed.

349
00:25:42,584 --> 00:25:43,418
I see.

350
00:25:46,046 --> 00:25:46,880
Hey,

351
00:25:47,714 --> 00:25:51,510
so, you don't have anything
that you only want to tell me?

352
00:25:52,678 --> 00:25:54,221
I want to tell you how to leave.

353
00:25:54,304 --> 00:25:56,056
Okay, have a good day.

354
00:25:56,139 --> 00:25:58,767
- Yes, you too.
- Thanks for the coffee.

355
00:25:59,309 --> 00:26:00,727
Please don't cause trouble.

356
00:26:07,401 --> 00:26:10,070
Byeong-gu! I didn't know we had customers.

357
00:26:10,946 --> 00:26:13,156
Hello. We were waiting for you.

358
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,534
Oh, I'm sorry.
Did you have to wait for long?

359
00:26:15,617 --> 00:26:17,327
- No.
- No?

360
00:26:17,452 --> 00:26:18,745
All right.

361
00:26:19,872 --> 00:26:21,206
- Let's head in.
- Okay.

362
00:26:21,582 --> 00:26:23,667
You should put up a sign
when you're stepping out.

363
00:26:39,725 --> 00:26:41,935
Do-yeon, choose what you want.

364
00:26:42,019 --> 00:26:43,854
- I'll be at the hardware store.
- Okay.

365
00:26:47,232 --> 00:26:48,275
A moment, please.

366
00:27:00,495 --> 00:27:01,413
Sir.

367
00:27:06,627 --> 00:27:07,544
Now...

368
00:27:07,628 --> 00:27:10,547
You witnessed
the accident at the intersection, right?

369
00:27:11,048 --> 00:27:12,132
"Sir"?

370
00:27:15,219 --> 00:27:16,303
So?

371
00:27:16,637 --> 00:27:19,723
Do you remember anything
about the cars in the accident?

372
00:27:20,307 --> 00:27:21,517
I'd appreciate your cooperation.

373
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,435
I was too baffled to remember anything.

374
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:25,729
Maybe the guys remember something.

375
00:27:26,271 --> 00:27:29,149
They don't remember anything,
aside from the big explosion.

376
00:27:29,233 --> 00:27:30,943
So you've already spoken with them.

377
00:27:31,026 --> 00:27:33,654
You move pretty fast for someone
who didn't serve in the military.

378
00:27:36,114 --> 00:27:38,992
Did you maybe see the SUV driver
get transported to the hospital

379
00:27:39,076 --> 00:27:41,411
or see the license plate? Anything?

380
00:27:41,954 --> 00:27:43,413
Not sure.

381
00:27:43,497 --> 00:27:47,042
The explosion went off
when I was busy trying to save people,

382
00:27:47,709 --> 00:27:49,461
so I don't remember

383
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:52,506
the license plate or anything.

384
00:27:53,215 --> 00:27:54,800
I see.

385
00:27:55,843 --> 00:27:57,594
You watched the accident happen
from the start, right?

386
00:27:57,678 --> 00:27:59,847
I was there the whole time, so of course.

387
00:28:02,182 --> 00:28:03,934
I have a question for you, too.

388
00:28:04,685 --> 00:28:09,147
If you answer it,
maybe I'll remember something too.

389
00:28:12,192 --> 00:28:14,403
Sure, fire away.

390
00:28:19,283 --> 00:28:21,243
Did you really not hear
any gunshots yesterday?

391
00:28:21,577 --> 00:28:22,828
When you were chasing after the guy.

392
00:28:24,288 --> 00:28:25,664
Come on.

393
00:28:25,998 --> 00:28:27,916
Why don't you just say
you don't want to cooperate?

394
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,252
What gunshots? What do you mean?

395
00:28:31,086 --> 00:28:32,796
I'll pay for the sticker there.

396
00:28:37,968 --> 00:28:41,388
I guess it's rusty or something.
It just doesn't work.

397
00:28:44,808 --> 00:28:46,143
What's that for?

398
00:28:48,687 --> 00:28:49,563
How much is it?

399
00:28:50,898 --> 00:28:52,733
It's 20,000 won. It's written right there.

400
00:28:52,816 --> 00:28:53,817
Right.

401
00:28:54,526 --> 00:28:55,861
You want it or not?

402
00:28:56,111 --> 00:28:57,863
Do you also give
a lifetime warranty on this?

403
00:28:58,238 --> 00:28:59,448
Don't be ridiculous.

404
00:28:59,865 --> 00:29:02,242
In what country do they offer
a lifetime warranty on screwdrivers?

405
00:29:02,743 --> 00:29:04,244
It's too expensive, then. I don't want it.

406
00:29:12,211 --> 00:29:13,045
Oh, my.

407
00:29:26,934 --> 00:29:32,940
HANNA LAUNDRY SERVICE

408
00:29:34,858 --> 00:29:38,779
My, my! I heard there was
a laundry master in Kiyun-si

409
00:29:38,862 --> 00:29:41,990
who could even straighten
the wrinkles on my face, and it's you!

410
00:29:42,783 --> 00:29:47,829
The more I see you, the more I realize
that your heart is as good as your looks.

411
00:29:47,913 --> 00:29:49,373
Oh, no, have you already caught on?

412
00:29:49,456 --> 00:29:51,166
Gosh, I guess I can't hide it.

413
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:52,835
Nobody can fool me.

414
00:29:54,127 --> 00:29:57,923
You can take your time with these.
It's nothing urgent.

415
00:29:58,006 --> 00:29:59,883
- Sure, leave them there.
- Okay.

416
00:30:03,595 --> 00:30:06,265
I guess you have to work until late
with so much work to do.

417
00:30:06,348 --> 00:30:09,518
Oh, this? This is for Ms. Lee.

418
00:30:09,601 --> 00:30:11,603
Her son just got a job.

419
00:30:11,687 --> 00:30:14,815
She asked me to wash it for his first day,
and I totally forgot.

420
00:30:15,107 --> 00:30:17,818
As you know,
things have been bad around here lately.

421
00:30:18,777 --> 00:30:21,655
It's been so hectic
since you moved here. I'm sorry.

422
00:30:21,738 --> 00:30:22,990
It's fine.

423
00:30:23,532 --> 00:30:24,616
Oh, right.

424
00:30:25,367 --> 00:30:29,788
According to Ms. Lee,
the man who died last night,

425
00:30:29,872 --> 00:30:32,749
could be the young man who lived
in Hyeonju Art Ville across the road.

426
00:30:34,334 --> 00:30:35,711
Wasn't he a foreigner?

427
00:30:35,794 --> 00:30:38,005
He was. That must've been why
she could identify him so easily.

428
00:30:38,547 --> 00:30:40,883
It's a very outdated building

429
00:30:41,633 --> 00:30:43,051
with so many vacant units.

430
00:30:43,135 --> 00:30:44,344
Really?

431
00:30:45,888 --> 00:30:46,847
Thank you.

432
00:31:52,704 --> 00:31:55,874
What are you doing there? With that face?

433
00:31:56,083 --> 00:31:57,835
You almost gave me a heart attack.

434
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:02,589
I got you.

435
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:05,968
What now? What did I do wrong this time?

436
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:11,807
The guilty always return to the scene.

437
00:32:11,932 --> 00:32:14,601
The guilty? Who? Oh, you?

438
00:32:14,685 --> 00:32:17,521
Don't act dumb.
You know we're talking about you.

439
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:20,941
What are you looking for here, Mr. Choi?

440
00:32:21,358 --> 00:32:24,236
I'm looking for my health, okay?

441
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:28,115
Walking prevents Alzheimer's and aging.

442
00:32:29,741 --> 00:32:30,784
What?

443
00:32:30,868 --> 00:32:33,203
Am I not allowed to take walks
in this neighborhood?

444
00:32:33,287 --> 00:32:34,496
Is there a fine for it?

445
00:32:36,999 --> 00:32:38,709
You're here to find the empty shell,
aren't you?

446
00:32:39,376 --> 00:32:40,836
What empty shell?

447
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:44,173
I served in an intense unit
in the military,

448
00:32:44,256 --> 00:32:46,800
so I know a muffled gunshot
when I hear one.

449
00:32:47,426 --> 00:32:51,763
And there was a gunshot
when you were fighting the man here,

450
00:32:53,015 --> 00:32:55,767
meaning one of you fired a shot.

451
00:32:57,019 --> 00:32:59,688
It doesn't make any sense
that you weren't startled.

452
00:32:59,771 --> 00:33:01,523
Considering you didn't even serve
in the military.

453
00:33:02,441 --> 00:33:03,483
Do you have

454
00:33:06,236 --> 00:33:07,571
hearing problems?

455
00:33:07,905 --> 00:33:09,114
TSM.

456
00:33:09,573 --> 00:33:11,700
TS... What?

457
00:33:12,117 --> 00:33:14,244
That's so mean.

458
00:33:14,786 --> 00:33:18,290
The whole neighborhood would've woken up
if there had been a gunshot.

459
00:33:18,373 --> 00:33:20,709
I may not have served in the military,
but I know a gunshot when I hear one.

460
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:22,461
Get out of my way. Let me keep walking.

461
00:33:22,544 --> 00:33:24,713
I told you it was a muffled gunshot.

462
00:33:27,132 --> 00:33:29,343
So you're going to act dumb the whole way?

463
00:33:29,968 --> 00:33:31,220
Sure, then.

464
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:33,972
Let's see how long that lasts.

465
00:33:36,475 --> 00:33:37,809
Sure, let's see.

466
00:33:37,893 --> 00:33:41,313
I'm walking all the way to the end,
so look all you want.

467
00:33:41,855 --> 00:33:46,235
And Mr. Hardware Store,
be careful at night.

468
00:33:46,693 --> 00:33:49,988
Sticking your face
into other people's faces at night

469
00:33:50,072 --> 00:33:53,075
is a form of assault, okay?

470
00:33:56,578 --> 00:33:59,373
What about my face?

471
00:34:09,675 --> 00:34:10,592
Hey.

472
00:34:12,386 --> 00:34:14,847
Why did he tell me to come so soon?
It's not even patrol time yet.

473
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:19,351
Hey, lock the door and come.

474
00:34:19,434 --> 00:34:20,686
Why should I lock the door?

475
00:34:21,562 --> 00:34:22,980
It's something important.

476
00:34:26,441 --> 00:34:27,818
Do-yeon's father?

477
00:34:27,943 --> 00:34:29,152
Yes.

478
00:34:29,862 --> 00:34:32,739
There's something suspicious about him.

479
00:34:32,823 --> 00:34:36,493
Perhaps he's just especially athletic.

480
00:34:36,577 --> 00:34:38,287
He could just be a good runner.

481
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:41,373
And it must be a coincidence
that he wasn't caught on camera.

482
00:34:41,456 --> 00:34:43,208
How could he have
intentionally avoided every angle?

483
00:34:43,292 --> 00:34:45,335
Sure, it could be a coincidence
the first time.

484
00:34:46,253 --> 00:34:49,423
But then I completely rearranged
the cameras.

485
00:34:49,506 --> 00:34:51,049
<i>I was busy trying to save people,</i>

486
00:34:51,758 --> 00:34:53,427
<i>so I don't remember...</i>

487
00:34:54,761 --> 00:34:56,138
<i>And he avoided all the cameras again.</i>

488
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:58,515
<i>I'm 100 percent sure now.</i>

489
00:34:58,599 --> 00:35:00,434
He knew where the cameras were
and avoided them all.

490
00:35:00,517 --> 00:35:03,437
And he gets weird
every time I talk about guns.

491
00:35:07,065 --> 00:35:10,277
So I made a gun loading sound on purpose,

492
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,863
and he tried to kill me in a flash.

493
00:35:14,364 --> 00:35:15,574
That's not all.

494
00:35:17,367 --> 00:35:18,410
Oh, gosh!

495
00:35:21,121 --> 00:35:23,290
Where did you get this?
I thought it was a real gun.

496
00:35:23,707 --> 00:35:25,083
It's a BB gun,

497
00:35:25,167 --> 00:35:27,127
but its material and weight
are identical to a real gun.

498
00:35:27,628 --> 00:35:30,464
See? You served in the military,
and even you fell for it.

499
00:35:30,547 --> 00:35:35,219
But he hasn't even served in the military,
yet he didn't even blink an eye.

500
00:35:35,511 --> 00:35:37,888
He could just be uninterested.

501
00:35:38,514 --> 00:35:41,600
I'm dead serious right now.

502
00:35:48,524 --> 00:35:50,984
I even found this on the site.

503
00:35:52,027 --> 00:35:53,111
What's this?

504
00:35:54,238 --> 00:35:55,989
This is a real bullet.

505
00:35:57,699 --> 00:35:59,576
So, I've concluded

506
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,540
that Choi Kang is...

507
00:36:08,919 --> 00:36:10,337
a North Korean spy.

508
00:36:12,005 --> 00:36:12,965
A North Korean spy?

509
00:36:13,966 --> 00:36:14,800
Yes.

510
00:36:18,971 --> 00:36:22,808
So, Do-yeon's father
is a North Korean spy,

511
00:36:23,183 --> 00:36:24,726
and the man killed in the explosion

512
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:26,770
was a secret agent
for the National Intelligence Service?

513
00:36:27,229 --> 00:36:28,564
It could be the other way around.

514
00:36:28,647 --> 00:36:30,440
Keep it quiet, okay?

515
00:36:31,942 --> 00:36:35,445
They cleaned up the ATM explosion
in just an hour,

516
00:36:35,654 --> 00:36:38,240
and news outlets announced
that it was a butane gas explosion.

517
00:36:38,323 --> 00:36:40,242
They're trying to cover this up.

518
00:36:42,369 --> 00:36:44,621
Butane gas doesn't explode like that.

519
00:36:45,163 --> 00:36:47,583
I think it was a bomb.

520
00:36:47,666 --> 00:36:49,501
- A bomb?
- That's right.

521
00:36:49,751 --> 00:36:52,421
Let's say you're right,
and the dead man is the spy.

522
00:36:52,713 --> 00:36:55,841
Then it would've been
a huge deal on the news.

523
00:36:56,383 --> 00:36:57,551
- Hey.
- Yes?

524
00:36:57,634 --> 00:36:59,511
Can foreigners work for the NIS?

525
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:03,891
They have Asians working for the CIA, too.

526
00:37:03,974 --> 00:37:06,310
They need to keep up
with the global trends to stay undercover.

527
00:37:06,393 --> 00:37:10,105
Right, and there are lots of foreigners
getting Korean citizenship nowadays.

528
00:37:10,189 --> 00:37:12,024
- Exactly.
- But still,

529
00:37:12,733 --> 00:37:15,235
calling Mr. Choi
a North Korean spy is a bit...

530
00:37:15,319 --> 00:37:16,445
Hey!

531
00:37:17,571 --> 00:37:20,032
I served in the Headquarters
Intelligence Detachment.

532
00:37:20,199 --> 00:37:22,034
Just trust me on this.

533
00:37:22,784 --> 00:37:23,660
Follow me.

534
00:37:39,176 --> 00:37:40,177
<i>Oh, right.</i>

535
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:43,055
According to Ms. Lee,
the man who died last night,

536
00:37:43,138 --> 00:37:46,225
could be the young man who lived
in Hyeonju Art Ville across the road.

537
00:37:46,308 --> 00:37:50,020
<i>It's a very outdated building</i>
<i>with so many vacant units.</i>

538
00:37:56,527 --> 00:37:59,196
I really don't think this is a good idea.

539
00:37:59,696 --> 00:38:02,741
It's not like we're stealing anything.
Let's just check.

540
00:38:06,578 --> 00:38:07,746
Here it is.

541
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,373
Wait.

542
00:38:09,998 --> 00:38:11,959
Are you sure this is the house?

543
00:38:12,042 --> 00:38:15,045
You must be so hungry all the time
with your mind constantly running.

544
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:16,880
Chun-bae said this was the house.

545
00:38:17,214 --> 00:38:18,090
Follow me.

546
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:22,094
I really don't think this is a good idea.

547
00:38:31,019 --> 00:38:32,604
I think I hear a cat.

548
00:38:32,688 --> 00:38:35,107
Should we just peep through the window?

549
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:36,275
Hold on.

550
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:52,499
- Byeong-nam!
- Yes?

551
00:38:55,627 --> 00:38:56,503
What is it?

552
00:38:57,713 --> 00:38:58,547
How did you open it?

553
00:38:59,631 --> 00:39:02,050
I just opened it, like this.

554
00:39:03,051 --> 00:39:07,806
I know Korea is a very safe country,
but people should still lock their doors.

555
00:39:09,266 --> 00:39:10,309
Darn it.

556
00:39:12,227 --> 00:39:13,770
What's wrong?

557
00:39:13,854 --> 00:39:15,814
No shoes in the entryway.
I don't think there's anyone in.

558
00:39:16,899 --> 00:39:18,275
Why are you scared, then?

559
00:39:19,651 --> 00:39:21,028
You scared me.

560
00:39:21,361 --> 00:39:22,362
- Step aside.
- Okay.

561
00:39:23,113 --> 00:39:24,198
Are you going in?

562
00:39:24,656 --> 00:39:25,908
You said nobody was inside.

563
00:39:47,721 --> 00:39:49,765
What's all this?

564
00:40:09,284 --> 00:40:10,869
Oh, gosh!

565
00:40:11,703 --> 00:40:12,704
You said nobody was in.

566
00:40:12,788 --> 00:40:14,790
They don't wear shoes.

567
00:40:20,504 --> 00:40:21,505
Meow.

568
00:40:24,341 --> 00:40:25,425
Meow.

569
00:40:28,345 --> 00:40:30,222
- Go that way.
- Why?

570
00:40:30,305 --> 00:40:31,515
We don't have time.

571
00:40:32,266 --> 00:40:33,517
- Fine.
- Okay.

572
00:40:37,813 --> 00:40:39,189
All right.

573
00:41:12,514 --> 00:41:14,099
Gosh, what's this?

574
00:41:44,087 --> 00:41:45,506
So this smell was...

575
00:42:03,649 --> 00:42:04,733
What's that?

576
00:42:36,139 --> 00:42:39,560
Guys, everything is good here!

577
00:42:40,435 --> 00:42:43,230
Byeong-nam! Su-nam!

578
00:42:43,313 --> 00:42:45,440
I mean, Su-il! Let's get out of here!

579
00:42:45,524 --> 00:42:46,650
We have to leave!

580
00:42:48,235 --> 00:42:49,528
Byeong-nam, we have to hurry.

581
00:42:49,611 --> 00:42:51,113
Hold on!

582
00:42:55,576 --> 00:42:57,703
I think someone is here!

583
00:42:59,997 --> 00:43:02,791
The stuffed bunnies smell like bombs.

584
00:43:43,624 --> 00:43:46,043
Who are you guys? Who sent you?

585
00:44:25,999 --> 00:44:27,167
Hey, honey.

586
00:44:27,251 --> 00:44:28,877
I'm just taking a walk.

587
00:44:29,711 --> 00:44:32,297
The neighborhood is bigger than it seems.

588
00:44:34,508 --> 00:44:38,262
I just ran into some stray cats.

589
00:44:38,679 --> 00:44:40,138
Go ahead and sleep first.

590
00:44:40,222 --> 00:44:42,224
I'll head right back. Bye.

591
00:44:48,814 --> 00:44:51,358
What? What is he doing there?

592
00:44:51,441 --> 00:44:52,734
Do-yeon's father?

593
00:44:53,068 --> 00:44:55,320
I got you, you little rascal.

594
00:44:57,823 --> 00:44:59,867
Hey! Be quiet!

595
00:45:01,076 --> 00:45:02,202
- I'm sorry.
- What's that?

596
00:45:02,286 --> 00:45:03,412
- What?
- What's that?

597
00:45:03,495 --> 00:45:05,414
I just saw it inside and took it.

598
00:45:18,177 --> 00:45:19,178
Let me

599
00:45:21,305 --> 00:45:22,306
explain

600
00:45:25,350 --> 00:45:26,351
myself.

601
00:45:29,104 --> 00:45:32,316
HOTLINE FOR REPORTING NORTH KOREAN SPIES

602
00:45:34,610 --> 00:45:35,819
What is it that you want to say?

603
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:38,113
Do something stupid,
and I'll report you immediately.

604
00:45:39,698 --> 00:45:42,117
Mr. Choi, are you a North Korean spy?

605
00:45:42,492 --> 00:45:43,410
A North Korean spy?

606
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:48,790
Last night, you framed me
as some crazy guy who didn't recycle,

607
00:45:48,874 --> 00:45:50,042
and now, I'm a North Korean spy?

608
00:45:50,125 --> 00:45:52,294
I saw it all. Cut the nonsense.

609
00:45:52,377 --> 00:45:55,214
We filmed you leaving Unit 203 with this.

610
00:45:55,297 --> 00:45:57,925
Did you get the guy running away, too?
Let me see.

611
00:45:58,008 --> 00:45:59,676
Don't try to pull any tricks here.

612
00:46:00,385 --> 00:46:02,054
I'm not pulling tricks.

613
00:46:04,097 --> 00:46:05,349
Seriously.

614
00:46:07,559 --> 00:46:08,894
I think that guy

615
00:46:09,561 --> 00:46:10,646
is a North Korean spy.

616
00:46:15,234 --> 00:46:16,985
The insurance company
collects all information

617
00:46:17,069 --> 00:46:20,364
on car accidents, explosions,
and any other accidents. Why?

618
00:46:20,447 --> 00:46:22,741
Because the victims need compensation.

619
00:46:23,158 --> 00:46:24,451
Exactly.

620
00:46:24,535 --> 00:46:26,870
And an investigator for the SIU

621
00:46:26,954 --> 00:46:30,207
has a duty to investigate the fine details
of these accidents carefully.

622
00:46:30,290 --> 00:46:31,708
Stop changing the topic,

623
00:46:31,792 --> 00:46:34,419
and just tell me
why you went into Unit 203.

624
00:46:35,546 --> 00:46:38,257
I heard something from the laundry place
and went there to find evidence.

625
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:39,508
What evidence?

626
00:46:40,551 --> 00:46:43,178
That he was a North Korean spy.

627
00:46:44,221 --> 00:46:46,431
To find something like a muffled pistol.

628
00:46:46,515 --> 00:46:47,599
See?

629
00:46:48,183 --> 00:46:49,476
You knew everything and acted dumb.

630
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:51,979
You cheeky man.

631
00:46:52,062 --> 00:46:53,981
That was the key evidence
that he was a North Korean spy.

632
00:46:54,064 --> 00:46:55,607
I didn't want to split my reward
once I reported him as a spy.

633
00:46:55,691 --> 00:46:56,900
There's no way, okay?

634
00:46:56,984 --> 00:46:58,068
Me neither, okay?

635
00:46:59,778 --> 00:47:00,737
What's that?

636
00:47:00,821 --> 00:47:02,698
I panicked and took it from that place.

637
00:47:02,781 --> 00:47:04,700
I was a communications soldier.
Should I open it?

638
00:47:04,783 --> 00:47:06,785
Open what? You have to report it.

639
00:47:06,869 --> 00:47:08,579
Do as you wish.

640
00:47:09,288 --> 00:47:13,417
Stop changing the topic
and tell me why you went into Unit 203.

641
00:47:16,503 --> 00:47:17,754
GENERAL HWANG

642
00:47:24,261 --> 00:47:25,512
Can you believe this guy?

643
00:47:26,013 --> 00:47:27,931
Look at this, Yong-hui.

644
00:47:28,015 --> 00:47:29,057
Mr. Choi!

645
00:47:29,558 --> 00:47:31,768
No, I have to take this call.

646
00:47:32,144 --> 00:47:33,687
Of course, you must.

647
00:47:37,816 --> 00:47:40,777
We'll all die if I don't take this call.

648
00:47:47,159 --> 00:47:48,035
SPEAKER

649
00:47:48,869 --> 00:47:50,537
<i>What took you so long to pick up?</i>

650
00:47:51,288 --> 00:47:52,456
<i>Why are you still out?</i>

651
00:47:52,706 --> 00:47:53,749
Hey, honey.

652
00:47:54,374 --> 00:47:56,835
I'm at the convenience store
in front of our building after my walk.

653
00:47:57,753 --> 00:47:59,171
<i>Do you realize what time it is?</i>

654
00:47:59,630 --> 00:48:02,424
<i>Come home already.</i>
<i>And get some milk on the way.</i>

655
00:48:02,591 --> 00:48:03,550
Yes, ma'am.

656
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:13,185
Forget being a North Korean spy.

657
00:48:13,268 --> 00:48:15,479
I have to go home with milk
so I can sleep.

658
00:48:17,856 --> 00:48:19,983
- Goodnight.
- Okay, goodnight.

659
00:48:23,946 --> 00:48:26,156
What should I do with this?
Should I report it?

660
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:27,783
Or should I unlock it?
I think I can do it.

661
00:48:27,866 --> 00:48:29,660
No, that's dangerous.
I should turn it in, right?

662
00:48:29,743 --> 00:48:31,328
I want to open it, though. What a dilemma.

663
00:48:31,411 --> 00:48:33,372
- Are you Gollum?
- What?

664
00:48:33,455 --> 00:48:34,831
Why are you so hesitant?

665
00:48:35,082 --> 00:48:36,166
Just do as you wish.

666
00:48:37,709 --> 00:48:39,419
Don't forget this, Byeong-nam.

667
00:48:40,045 --> 00:48:42,214
I feel like I can open it.

668
00:48:42,548 --> 00:48:44,299
But I should turn it in. It's dangerous.

669
00:48:44,716 --> 00:48:46,635
What are you doing?

670
00:48:47,094 --> 00:48:48,887
Should I try opening it?

671
00:48:51,056 --> 00:48:53,642
MAMMOSEU MART

672
00:48:53,725 --> 00:48:56,061
TODAY'S SPECIAL SALE

673
00:49:12,035 --> 00:49:13,954
Hello.

674
00:49:21,336 --> 00:49:23,630
You have to finish this by next week.

675
00:49:26,758 --> 00:49:28,343
But your kid will finish it in no time.

676
00:49:34,224 --> 00:49:35,350
Hold on.

677
00:49:40,981 --> 00:49:43,901
These are for a promotional event.

678
00:49:44,234 --> 00:49:45,569
Take these and feed your kid.

679
00:49:45,652 --> 00:49:47,029
These won't expire for a long time.

680
00:49:47,112 --> 00:49:48,739
I'm really fine.

681
00:49:49,615 --> 00:49:52,618
Oh, my. Your baby is so calm.

682
00:49:52,701 --> 00:49:54,745
Gosh, you're not even crying, are you?

683
00:49:55,954 --> 00:49:57,164
Thank you.

684
00:49:58,415 --> 00:49:59,458
Have a good day.

685
00:50:02,628 --> 00:50:03,670
How adorable.

686
00:50:05,631 --> 00:50:07,799
- Hello.
- That's so sad.

687
00:50:09,092 --> 00:50:09,927
What?

688
00:50:11,136 --> 00:50:14,348
The woman with the baby who just left.

689
00:50:15,015 --> 00:50:16,433
Her husband died
in the intersection accident.

690
00:50:16,934 --> 00:50:19,144
She only ever buys products
that are on sale.

691
00:50:19,853 --> 00:50:22,189
Her kid is too young for her to work.

692
00:50:29,321 --> 00:50:30,405
Goodness.

693
00:50:32,032 --> 00:50:35,619
Are you visiting another hospital?

694
00:50:35,702 --> 00:50:38,580
No, I'm going to Bongbong Junkyard today.

695
00:50:40,541 --> 00:50:41,667
Bongbong Junkyard?

696
00:50:43,293 --> 00:50:44,586
<i>So you lived in the neighborhood?</i>

697
00:50:45,045 --> 00:50:47,130
You should've told me sooner.

698
00:50:47,673 --> 00:50:49,591
Hold up.

699
00:50:49,675 --> 00:50:51,051
Let's drink together.

700
00:50:57,766 --> 00:51:02,646
I've spoken with the police
and all witnesses at the crash site,

701
00:51:02,729 --> 00:51:04,398
and nobody knows
what happened to the other car.

702
00:51:04,481 --> 00:51:06,525
They don't even know
if the driver is still alive

703
00:51:06,608 --> 00:51:08,485
or how many people were in the car.

704
00:51:08,569 --> 00:51:09,570
Nobody knows anything.

705
00:51:09,653 --> 00:51:11,405
The tow truck guys said the same thing.

706
00:51:11,488 --> 00:51:13,699
All the tow truck guys
know each other in this area,

707
00:51:13,782 --> 00:51:15,868
but they didn't recognize
the tow truck guy from that accident.

708
00:51:15,951 --> 00:51:17,619
They went to the site when called,

709
00:51:17,703 --> 00:51:20,747
and they were mad someone beat them to it.

710
00:51:22,457 --> 00:51:25,419
Have they spoken to the driver?

711
00:51:25,669 --> 00:51:28,380
No, they all left the site
at different times

712
00:51:28,463 --> 00:51:30,591
and saw him on the way here.

713
00:51:31,341 --> 00:51:33,886
Apparently, he took the damaged car
and drove toward Hanbal Mountain.

714
00:51:35,012 --> 00:51:35,971
Is there anything there?

715
00:51:36,346 --> 00:51:38,015
It's a mountain. What do you expect?

716
00:51:38,432 --> 00:51:40,642
Nothing but tigers and lions!

717
00:51:44,813 --> 00:51:48,567
Oh, but there's a logistics center
in the mountain.

718
00:51:49,443 --> 00:51:52,571
What was it? Oh, man.

719
00:51:52,654 --> 00:51:53,530
Nobus?

720
00:51:53,697 --> 00:51:54,948
Something like that.

721
00:51:56,325 --> 00:51:57,451
"Nobus"?

722
00:51:58,952 --> 00:52:00,329
You mean the Nobus Logistics Center?

723
00:52:00,412 --> 00:52:02,623
Yes, that. Nobus.

724
00:52:02,706 --> 00:52:04,708
They load and unload trucks
in the Hanbal Mountain?

725
00:52:04,791 --> 00:52:06,543
No, it's just a warehouse.

726
00:52:06,627 --> 00:52:09,796
I went there once because
someone called about a car breaking down,

727
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:10,923
but nobody was there.

728
00:52:11,715 --> 00:52:13,800
- And you're sure the truck went that way.
- Yes.

729
00:53:01,265 --> 00:53:03,183
Hello.

730
00:53:03,267 --> 00:53:05,811
- What is the purpose of your visit?
- Oh, well,

731
00:53:05,894 --> 00:53:08,146
I'm Choi Kang from Veotigo Insurance.

732
00:53:09,439 --> 00:53:13,652
I heard a car from a recent car crash
was brought here.

733
00:53:13,735 --> 00:53:15,237
Is it here?

734
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:16,488
I cannot provide that information.

735
00:53:16,822 --> 00:53:18,740
This is private property,
so please go back.

736
00:53:19,658 --> 00:53:20,784
Oh, well...

737
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:23,036
I'm sorry,

738
00:53:23,954 --> 00:53:26,748
but my bladder is about to explode.

739
00:53:26,832 --> 00:53:29,251
Could I just use your bathroom?

740
00:53:29,334 --> 00:53:30,419
I'm about to burst.

741
00:53:31,086 --> 00:53:33,338
It's private property.
You can't enter without permission.

742
00:53:34,006 --> 00:53:38,010
Okay, I'll just go in
and turn my car around, then.

743
00:53:38,969 --> 00:53:40,429
You can drive in reverse to exit.

744
00:53:41,305 --> 00:53:42,556
There's a car going out.

745
00:53:42,681 --> 00:53:43,849
Okay.

746
00:54:01,033 --> 00:54:02,367
What is this place?

00:54:02,451 --> 00:54:04,203

- Thanks. Drive safe!
- See you tomorrow.

00:56:35,312 --> 00:56:36,522
How come you didn't get in?

757
00:56:36,813 --> 00:56:38,482
Daddy is picking me up today.

758
00:56:38,565 --> 00:56:40,317
Is that so?

759
00:56:40,776 --> 00:56:44,571
And I put the stickers from your shop
on my bag.

760
00:56:44,655 --> 00:56:47,282
Great job, it looks wonderful.

761
00:56:48,867 --> 00:56:50,369
- Do-yeon!
- It's very pretty.

762
00:56:50,452 --> 00:56:52,204
Oh? It's Dad!

763
00:56:53,038 --> 00:56:54,373
Dad!

764
00:57:18,146 --> 00:57:19,106

00:57:24,486 --> 00:57:25,445

Do-yeon!

767
00:57:43,589 --> 00:57:45,883
Are you okay? Are you hurt anywhere?

768
00:57:45,966 --> 00:57:47,050
Dad...

769
00:57:47,134 --> 00:57:48,760
You're fine. Daddy is here.

770
00:57:50,929 --> 00:57:51,930
Yes.

771
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:54,266
Are you okay?

772
00:57:56,059 --> 00:57:57,519

774
00:58:23,921 --> 00:58:25,255
You said you'd turn it in.

775
00:58:25,839 --> 00:58:27,424
Sorry.

776
00:58:28,175 --> 00:58:30,636
I was going to do that after checking it.

777
00:58:30,719 --> 00:58:33,263
But it's a special lock
that won't open easily.

778
00:58:33,514 --> 00:58:34,806
Why won't it open?

779
00:58:35,265 --> 00:58:38,810
I guess it must be something important

780
00:58:39,770 --> 00:58:41,438
for them to do something that crazy
in broad daylight to get it.

781
00:58:41,939 --> 00:58:45,651
Maybe it holds key evidence
for a crime that they must destroy.

782
00:58:46,944 --> 00:58:47,945
Is there no way to open it?

783
00:58:48,904 --> 00:58:49,947
Well...

784
00:58:50,906 --> 00:58:52,491
I guess there's a way.

785
00:58:52,574 --> 00:58:53,575
Really?

786
00:58:55,744 --> 00:58:56,870
What should we do?

787
00:58:56,954 --> 00:58:59,289
Why are you even asking?
Go big, or go home.

788
00:59:01,834 --> 00:59:04,127
I'm intrigued now. Let's open it.

789
00:59:05,295 --> 00:59:08,340
We're on the same boat now, then.

790
00:59:13,053 --> 00:59:13,971
Okay.

791
00:59:18,308 --> 00:59:19,309
Okay!

00:59:40,372 --> 00:59:42,624
This is Kim Seon-won,
who served in the military with me.

794
00:59:43,292 --> 00:59:44,626
They're buddies from my neighborhood.

795
00:59:45,377 --> 00:59:46,837
Hey, nice to meet you.

796
00:59:47,379 --> 00:59:48,547
Stop it.

797
00:59:48,630 --> 00:59:50,674
Can you take a look at this?

798
00:59:54,344 --> 00:59:55,429
It can't be cracked.

799
01:00:01,310 --> 01:00:02,144
Hold on.

800
01:00:14,489 --> 01:00:16,366
You know about the case

801
01:00:16,450 --> 01:00:19,578
where a military captain
tried to sell Korea's military information

802
01:00:19,661 --> 01:00:22,539
to a North Korean agent
in exchange for Bitcoins, right?

803
01:00:26,001 --> 01:00:29,129
Anyway, to hack the KGCCS system,

804
01:00:29,213 --> 01:00:32,633
he used a hacking device
in the form of a USB, Poison Tap.

805
01:00:33,592 --> 01:00:34,968
Then is that Poison Tap?

806
01:00:35,052 --> 01:00:36,261
I've only heard of it.

807
01:00:36,345 --> 01:00:38,472
No, that's outdated.

808
01:00:38,555 --> 01:00:42,309
This was inspired
by the Yongmu Gym manager here,

809
01:00:42,392 --> 01:00:43,685
Yongmu Number 17.

810
01:00:45,270 --> 01:00:46,271
Nice.

811
01:00:46,355 --> 01:00:48,857
Could you explain it in layman's terms
so I can understand?

812
01:00:49,107 --> 01:00:50,567
Come on.

813
01:00:52,653 --> 01:00:53,946
Well,

814
01:00:54,029 --> 01:00:56,240
this Yongmu Number 17

815
01:00:56,323 --> 01:00:59,493
is an upgraded version of Poison Tap.

816
01:00:59,785 --> 01:01:01,328
- You know what hacking is, right?
- Something bad.

817
01:01:02,829 --> 01:01:03,956
Yes, it's bad.

818
01:01:04,039 --> 01:01:07,000
It's a hacking device
in the form of a USB.

819
01:01:07,084 --> 01:01:08,836
I haven't tested it
on a satellite computer yet,

820
01:01:08,919 --> 01:01:10,420
but if it doesn't work,
I'll edit the source.

821
01:01:11,463 --> 01:01:12,464
But one thing.

822
01:01:13,048 --> 01:01:15,759
Please get as far as you can from here
before you use it.

823
01:01:15,843 --> 01:01:17,761
Don't put my shop at risk.

824
01:01:17,845 --> 01:01:20,681
Hey, of course I thought of that.
Hand it to me.

825
01:01:20,931 --> 01:01:25,060
No, let's just have you do it
while we're here.

826
01:01:25,143 --> 01:01:27,396
Have you no shame?

827
01:01:27,479 --> 01:01:30,482
He gave us a key to hack it.
We can't ask him to do more.

828
01:01:30,566 --> 01:01:31,650
Thanks to whom? Ask for what?

829
01:01:31,733 --> 01:01:33,026
- Why are we here, then?
- Let's go.

830
01:01:33,110 --> 01:01:35,070
- Just turn it on for us.
- Just trust us.

831
01:01:35,153 --> 01:01:36,738
- Read the room.
- I'll try it

832
01:01:36,822 --> 01:01:38,156
and call you if it doesn't work.

833
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:39,867
How can I read the room
when you're being so vague?

834
01:01:39,950 --> 01:01:41,159
Just go, okay?

835
01:01:41,785 --> 01:01:42,870
Goodnight.

836
01:01:43,287 --> 01:01:44,288
Bye.

837
01:02:01,096 --> 01:02:03,223
- It worked.
- It's on.

838
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:04,600
Hurry.

839
01:02:17,571 --> 01:02:19,907
But what's with the screen?

840
01:02:19,990 --> 01:02:22,451
Did you expect it
to look like a normal computer?

841
01:02:22,784 --> 01:02:24,411
Fine, just do your thing. Hurry.

842
01:02:25,204 --> 01:02:26,622
Let's see what's in it.

843
01:02:31,668 --> 01:02:32,669
Let's see.

844
01:02:35,047 --> 01:02:36,215
What's this?

845
01:02:36,298 --> 01:02:38,133
That looks like the Kiyun Intersection.

846
01:02:38,217 --> 01:02:40,469
You're right.

847
01:02:40,552 --> 01:02:42,137
It's from that accident.

848
01:02:42,596 --> 01:02:43,847
You're right.

849
01:02:44,097 --> 01:02:46,099
Look at that.

850
01:02:47,559 --> 01:02:51,522
The guys and I were sitting over there.

851
01:02:51,605 --> 01:02:52,648
See that?

852
01:03:00,239 --> 01:03:02,574
Oh, man. My stomach is in pain
from all that anxiety.

853
01:03:02,658 --> 01:03:04,618
- I need to use the bathroom.
- Go ahead.

854
01:03:04,993 --> 01:03:06,411
- I have to do it again.
- Do what again?

855
01:03:06,495 --> 01:03:08,497
- I have to start over.
- Rewind the video!

856
01:04:34,082 --> 01:04:35,209
Who sent you here?

857
01:04:35,667 --> 01:04:37,586
Kamas? BIJ?

858
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:38,879
Tell me.

859
01:04:54,228 --> 01:04:57,439
So, the car crash
at the Kiyun Intersection

860
01:04:57,523 --> 01:04:59,441
and the ATM explosion

861
01:04:59,525 --> 01:05:02,569
were plotted by the same person?

862
01:05:03,070 --> 01:05:06,114
All the files are in English,
and the man who died was a foreigner.

863
01:05:06,198 --> 01:05:08,742
Could this be
the work of an international mafia?

864
01:05:08,825 --> 01:05:09,993
An international mafia?

865
01:05:10,494 --> 01:05:11,787
My gosh, this is...

866
01:05:11,870 --> 01:05:12,913
Did you find anything?

867
01:05:12,996 --> 01:05:14,581
Did you fall into the toilet or what?

868
01:05:14,665 --> 01:05:17,042
Oh, my! Blood!

869
01:05:17,125 --> 01:05:18,710
Blood!

870
01:05:20,087 --> 01:05:22,089
The guy on the motorbike came after us.

871
01:05:22,172 --> 01:05:24,299
Did you find anything
aside from the video of the accident?

872
01:05:25,092 --> 01:05:27,636
We haven't checked all of it.

873
01:05:28,387 --> 01:05:30,013
Let's check them together.

874
01:05:30,639 --> 01:05:31,765
Yes.

875
01:05:34,268 --> 01:05:35,185
It's making a sound.

876
01:05:37,020 --> 01:05:40,482
Someone is controlling it remotely.

877
01:05:40,566 --> 01:05:41,567
Excuse me.

878
01:05:44,444 --> 01:05:45,279
Hold up.

879
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:57,207
"You're making things complicated."

880
01:05:59,293 --> 01:06:00,794
"JDD...

881
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:03,255
