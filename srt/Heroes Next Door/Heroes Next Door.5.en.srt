THIS DRAMA IS A WORK OF FICTION.
ALL CHARACTERS, PROFESSIONS, PLACES,

COMPANIES, ORGANIZATIONS,
ETHNIC GROUPS AND EVENTS ARE NOT REAL.

00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:44,962
ALL CHILD AND ANIMAL SCENES WERE FILMED
SAFELY UNDER EXPERT SUPERVISION.

00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:32,050
Watcher-One. The site is clear.

6
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:33,886
The kids are heading to the ground floor.

7
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:35,596
Check the outside.

8
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:51,778
<i>Sierra-Kilo. The outside is clear.</i>

9
00:01:51,904 --> 00:01:53,572
<i>The kids have arrived on the ground floor.</i>

10
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:55,115
<i>The man with the backpack is on the move.</i>

11
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:15,719
<i>Sierra-Kilo!</i>

12
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:18,805
<i>An explosion on the ground floor!</i>
<i>A warning for a second explosion.</i>

13
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:21,016
<i>Retreat to B-4. Over!</i>

14
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:22,244
What's wrong, honey?
Do you have a headache?

15
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:24,913
What? Oh, it's nothing. I'm fine.

16
00:03:25,998 --> 00:03:28,125
Dad, look!

17
00:03:31,003 --> 00:03:32,629
Stand beside Mom.
I'll take a photo of you two.

18
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,715
Let's take a photo.

19
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,175
All right.

20
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:38,093
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

21
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:42,639
Look, Do-yeon!

00:03:57,154 --> 00:04:01,533

25
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:19,051
Producer Kim.

26
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:29,937
<i>The phone is turned off.</i>
<i>Please leave a voice message.</i>

27
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,730
<i>You will be charged extra after...</i>

28
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:35,192
<i>The phone is turned off.</i>

29
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,818
<i>This afternoon,</i>

30
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:40,906
<i>the culprit behind the online bomb threat</i>
<i>in Kiyun-si was arrested.</i>

31
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:42,658
<i>The bombs were found to be fake.</i>

32
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:46,870
<i>The suspect stated</i>
<i>he had planned the crime</i>

33
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:49,957
<i>after seeing online news</i>
<i>questioning recent explosions in Kiyun-si.</i>

34
00:04:56,922 --> 00:04:57,965
Who are they?

35
00:04:58,423 --> 00:04:59,424
What do you mean?

36
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:02,553
Who are these bastards
playing with bombs in our neighborhood?

37
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,930
How should I know?

38
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:06,890
Isn't that what you meet up
to talk about every day?

39
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:08,684
Give me a sec.

41
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:12,145
Hello?

00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:15,774

KWAK BYEONG-NAM

45
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:49,558
Hey, little bro.

46
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:50,767
<i>Emergency!</i>

47
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:53,395
- The fake bomb?
-<i> No, that's not it!</i>

48
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:54,438
What is it, then?

49
00:05:59,193 --> 00:06:00,319
Let me call you back.

50
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:09,703
<i>Choi Kang?</i>

51
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:13,123
- Who are you?
- <i>Let's meet.</i>

52
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:14,917
I'm asking who you are.

53
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,295
<i>The Chief of JDD Headquarters.</i>

54
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:27,930
The Vice Minister of National Defense.
Lee Geun-cheol.

55
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:50,744
What's going on? Where's Producer Kim?

56
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,538
No idea. We can't get in touch with him.

57
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:56,750
He wasn't answering when I called
about the hate comments on his video.

58
00:06:56,834 --> 00:06:58,210
So I came to check and...

59
00:06:58,293 --> 00:07:00,295
And the place was a mess.

60
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:03,423
Yes, someone took the security cameras
and the hard drives, too.

61
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:06,260
I didn't expect you here, Ms. Jung.

62
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:08,303
What? I can't be here?

63
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,389
Of course you can.

64
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:17,437
MIN-SEO WAS AT THE FAKE BOMB SITE

65
00:07:18,856 --> 00:07:21,275
Hurry and help us clean up.

66
00:07:30,534 --> 00:07:31,577
Soldiers?

67
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:33,078
Huh?

68
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:35,205
This is a combat boot footprint.

69
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:36,748
Of military officers, too.

70
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:40,544
Here, I'll take a photo for evidence.

71
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,756
You installed those things
to find Hui-ja before, right?

72
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,175
Yeah, I did.

73
00:07:46,258 --> 00:07:48,552
I was just thinking about those, too!
You really know your stuff.

74
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:50,554
Install what?

75
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,264
Security cameras.

76
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:53,724
There are security cameras?

77
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:57,519
Hui-ja went out alone and almost got stuck
at a construction site.

78
00:07:57,728 --> 00:08:02,441
Chun-bae was so desperate,
so I installed a few around the town.

79
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:04,860
- Why are you only telling us now?
- When was I supposed to tell you?

80
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:06,361
- Where are they?
- Here and there.

81
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:09,072
There are some near here, right?
Let's check those first.

82
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,033
Yeah, let me bring them.

83
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:13,035
Follow me.

84
00:08:26,465 --> 00:08:27,424
There we go.

85
00:08:29,468 --> 00:08:31,512
All this to keep
the laundry service lady safe?

86
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:32,971
You're a good guy.

87
00:08:33,055 --> 00:08:35,098
We're neighbors. We're practically family.

88
00:08:35,641 --> 00:08:36,892
I'd be your older brother, then.

89
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:40,395
You have a real talent for being annoying.

90
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:42,981
I'll take that.

91
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:44,983
So what's with Ms. Jung?

92
00:08:45,067 --> 00:08:47,236
How did she know they were soldiers
from just footprints?

93
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:49,154
She's one scary woman.

94
00:08:49,238 --> 00:08:51,198
She used to be a drill instructor
for the 707th Unit.

95
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:52,282
What?

96
00:08:52,658 --> 00:08:56,954
During today's fake bomb disaster,
she went in herself to defuse the bomb.

97
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:58,539
She defused a bomb by herself?

98
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:01,583
Min-seo was there.

99
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:05,170
Man...

100
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:08,674
What's with all the special forces
in this neighborhood?

101
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:10,342
Wasn't Yong-hui also in the 707th Unit?

102
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:13,011
He was a military store clerk in the 707th

103
00:09:13,095 --> 00:09:16,890
and later got assigned
to some hacking-related unit.

104
00:09:16,974 --> 00:09:18,892
Let's hurry before she goes off again.

105
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:32,281
What are they, subduing a terrorist?

106
00:09:32,364 --> 00:09:34,199
Those crazy bastards.

107
00:09:34,283 --> 00:09:38,579
How could they arrest a journalist
in this day and age just for speaking out?

108
00:09:38,871 --> 00:09:41,164
It means he hit the spot.

109
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:42,374
I'm checking online,

110
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:44,418
and there isn't any news
about Magnifying Media.

111
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:47,087
The government could be controlling it,

112
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:50,215
or they could really be moving in secret.

113
00:09:50,966 --> 00:09:52,301
- What?
- Huh?

114
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,430
Oh, that's just how it always is
in movies, you know?

115
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:59,266
What if they arrest us, too?

116
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:02,186
We were the ones who brought this
to Producer Kim's attention!

117
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:04,188
He interviewed me too. Don't worry.

118
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:05,856
Yeah, don't worry.
He interviewed all of us.

119
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:08,275
Should we just upload this video?

120
00:10:08,984 --> 00:10:10,194
No, not yet.

121
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:12,905
Let's check all the other videos
and find out where he was taken to.

122
00:10:13,322 --> 00:10:15,407
I know where all the other cameras are,

123
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,951
so I'll check them all tonight.

124
00:10:18,035 --> 00:10:19,828
If I find anything,
I'll share it in the group chat.

125
00:10:19,912 --> 00:10:22,122
Then I'll ask this lawyer I know

126
00:10:22,206 --> 00:10:23,749
- what we should do with this clip.
- Okay.

127
00:10:23,832 --> 00:10:26,293
- I'll make some calls, too.
- Okay.

128
00:10:27,336 --> 00:10:28,337
And you?

129
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:30,631
- What are you going to do?
- Me?

130
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:34,927
Hey, I installed all these cameras.
I've already done my part.

131
00:10:38,722 --> 00:10:40,891
I'll look around the neighborhood.

132
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:43,268
If I see anyone suspicious, I'll handle...

133
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:48,440
I mean... I'll scream.

134
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,528
Yeah, he's got the voice of thunder.

135
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:54,404
I'll take care of this guy.

136
00:10:54,488 --> 00:10:57,115
Hey, let's go patrol around.

137
00:10:57,199 --> 00:10:58,909
- Shall we get going, then?
- Come on.

138
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:20,264
Where am I?

139
00:11:21,682 --> 00:11:23,725
Hold up. Hey!

140
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:25,519
Hello!

141
00:11:26,562 --> 00:11:27,729
Hello!

142
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:31,316
Hey, this is illegal confinement!

143
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:34,278
Hey! Get me a lawyer right now!

144
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:36,488
Hey! Hello?

145
00:11:36,572 --> 00:11:38,490
Somebody tell me what's going on!

146
00:11:38,574 --> 00:11:40,075
Where am I?

147
00:11:52,588 --> 00:11:57,259
Who parked their car like this?

148
00:11:57,342 --> 00:12:01,054
They're ruining my morning.

149
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:04,683
Honey, I'll need to go back and forth
a few times.

150
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:05,893
Should I do it?

151
00:12:05,976 --> 00:12:07,394
That'll take forever.

152
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:08,896
You can go and open the store.

153
00:12:08,979 --> 00:12:09,897
Min-seo, hop in.

154
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,857
Just give me money. I'll take a cab.

155
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:13,525
Just get in.

156
00:12:35,464 --> 00:12:36,507
- See you.
- Bye.

157
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:37,674
Have a good day, Min-seo.

158
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:39,968
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye!

159
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:46,850
My Nam-yeon is totally pissed.

160
00:12:47,351 --> 00:12:49,478
All of you are screwed today.

161
00:12:51,188 --> 00:12:52,189
Mom,

162
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:54,441
the fake bomb guy was an eighth-grader
at Kiyun Middle School.

163
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,777
The police arrested him at his house.

164
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:57,778
No way!

165
00:12:58,237 --> 00:12:59,238
And you?

166
00:13:00,072 --> 00:13:01,365
Are you okay?

167
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:02,824
About what?

168
00:13:05,786 --> 00:13:06,828
Never mind.

169
00:13:07,371 --> 00:13:09,122
I'm glad you take after me.

170
00:13:17,631 --> 00:13:19,675
Get off your phone and get out.

171
00:13:21,051 --> 00:13:22,761
I'll be late today
because of my birthday party.

172
00:13:24,513 --> 00:13:26,431
Thank you for the birthday money.

173
00:13:28,267 --> 00:13:30,143
Call me at 9 p.m. I'll pick you up.

174
00:13:30,227 --> 00:13:32,437
- Okay, see you.
- Bye.

175
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:36,316
Mom, you were so cool yesterday.

176
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:40,070
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

177
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:42,239
- Happy birthday!
- Happy birthday!

178
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:43,448
Thanks!

179
00:13:46,118 --> 00:13:47,327
Gosh.

180
00:13:50,289 --> 00:13:52,541
That was an eventful day.

181
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,679
Oh? Mr. Cellphone!

182
00:14:08,015 --> 00:14:09,308
How's your injury?

183
00:14:10,893 --> 00:14:12,060
Just get in the back.

184
00:14:12,561 --> 00:14:14,479
- You're still sulking.
- What?

185
00:14:19,568 --> 00:14:22,321
Oh, my. You drive so well.

186
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:26,241
VICE MINISTER OF NATIONAL DEFENSE
LEE GEUN-CHEOL

187
00:14:33,582 --> 00:14:34,791
That's some good photoshop.

188
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:42,841
Did you spot anything peculiar
during the ATM explosion?

189
00:14:43,175 --> 00:14:44,676
Why are you asking me?

190
00:14:45,219 --> 00:14:47,179
There were soldiers
to clean up every explosion site.

191
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,600
Does it have something to do with JDD?

192
00:14:52,434 --> 00:14:55,604
We're looking into it,
and I don't think so.

193
00:14:56,063 --> 00:14:58,941
Then why did you call me
instead of continuing the search?

194
00:15:00,025 --> 00:15:03,320
Surely you have the power
to mess with anyone over anything.

195
00:15:04,655 --> 00:15:08,200
It's not that simple,
which is why I've called you.

196
00:15:10,994 --> 00:15:13,330
If the Vice Minister of National Defense
is having trouble,

197
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:15,624
is this related
to the Minister or something?

198
00:15:25,676 --> 00:15:27,928
My, my. This guy.

199
00:15:28,804 --> 00:15:30,556
Lee Yong-hui.

200
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:32,599
A manager...

201
00:15:33,308 --> 00:15:34,935
A manager at a special martial arts gym?

202
00:15:37,563 --> 00:15:40,816
Kwak Byeong-nam. Runs a stationery shop.

203
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,734
The HID Unit?

204
00:15:46,405 --> 00:15:49,116
Jung Nam-yeon, Mammoseu Mart.

205
00:15:49,491 --> 00:15:52,786
She's the one who made a scene
about defusing the bomb herself.

206
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:58,458
She was the youngest drill instructor
of the 707th Unit?

207
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:01,003
CERTIFIED COUNTER-TERRORISM EOD INSTRUCTOR

208
00:16:04,548 --> 00:16:06,049
A Hanguk University student?

209
00:16:07,551 --> 00:16:08,719
A mortar?

210
00:16:08,969 --> 00:16:10,846
What kind of a neighborhood is this?

211
00:16:13,891 --> 00:16:16,476
This guy was exempt from conscription.

212
00:16:16,977 --> 00:16:18,312
Nothing special.

213
00:16:20,564 --> 00:16:22,232
So, why did you call me?

214
00:16:22,983 --> 00:16:24,818
The bombs that went off in Kiyun-si

215
00:16:25,194 --> 00:16:28,864
were used in the Korean military
a few years back.

216
00:16:29,865 --> 00:16:32,242
We don't know
how they ended up in Kiyun-si yet.

217
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:38,707
So that's why the soldiers
were in such a hurry to clean up the site.

218
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:42,377
But what was a foreigner doing with it?

219
00:16:42,794 --> 00:16:45,881
It was definitely a foreigner
who had the bomb at the ATM.

220
00:16:47,257 --> 00:16:49,635
That's what's odd,
which is why we're investigating it.

221
00:16:50,052 --> 00:16:51,303
If you could just help us--

222
00:16:51,386 --> 00:16:54,806
Oh, no, I'm just a civilian now.

223
00:16:55,891 --> 00:16:58,268
This isn't a mission.
I'm asking you a favor.

224
00:16:59,978 --> 00:17:02,064
Let me ask you one, too.

225
00:17:02,606 --> 00:17:05,400
Please stop calling me.

226
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:11,740
Something's going on,
and Kiyun-si is at the center of it.

227
00:17:13,534 --> 00:17:16,286
That's something even
my six-year-old daughter knows.

228
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:18,038
Talk about stating the obvious.

229
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:21,041
We'd really appreciate your help,
Mr. Choi.

230
00:17:34,304 --> 00:17:36,515
Where am I?

231
00:17:37,641 --> 00:17:38,517
Hey!

232
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:49,194
Taxi...

233
00:17:52,698 --> 00:17:54,199
TO VEOTIGO INSURANCE: 58,000 WON

234
00:17:56,076 --> 00:17:57,828
It costs 58,000 won?

235
00:18:04,126 --> 00:18:07,713
That man sure knows how to hold a grudge!

236
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:09,381
Man!

237
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:14,511
<i>The next news is about</i>
<i>Kiyun-si's specialized IT zone plan.</i>

238
00:18:14,595 --> 00:18:16,638
<i>James Sullivan's representative</i>
<i>announced a change coming...</i>

239
00:18:16,722 --> 00:18:18,724
- Sir, please turn up the volume.
- Sure.

240
00:18:18,807 --> 00:18:21,476
<i>...including that for Kiyun-si.</i>

241
00:18:21,643 --> 00:18:25,105
<i>Sullivan's Joinus Company</i>
<i>has even purchased the land</i>

242
00:18:25,189 --> 00:18:27,482
<i>to build its Asian hub,</i>

00:18:27,566 --> 00:18:29,943
<i>yet it's announced a change</i>
<i>in its investment plans...</i>

244
00:18:30,027 --> 00:18:33,864
Too bad for anyone who recently
bought property in Kiyun-si for this.

245
00:18:35,616 --> 00:18:37,034
That'd be me.

246
00:18:37,117 --> 00:18:38,827
<i>...causing a rise in anxiety.</i>

247
00:18:38,911 --> 00:18:41,705
<i>In fact, no transactions were made</i>
<i>on properties in Kiyun-si today,</i>

248

249
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:48,754
<i>In response to this, Kiyun-si announced...</i>

250
00:18:48,837 --> 00:18:50,380
<i>Only under two conditions.</i>

251
00:18:51,882 --> 00:18:52,925
First,

252
00:18:53,926 --> 00:18:55,969
you know that Producer Kim In-seop
of Magnifying Media

253
00:18:56,053 --> 00:18:57,846
was arrested by soldiers yesterday, right?

254
00:18:59,306 --> 00:19:02,059
The license plate number was H60 6789.

255
00:19:09,358 --> 00:19:11,276
Don't tell me you didn't know about this.

256
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:18,408
They arrested a civilian journalist
without the Vice Minister's knowledge?

257
00:19:20,244 --> 00:19:21,703
I'll look into it as soon as possible.

258
00:19:22,579 --> 00:19:23,830
What's the second condition?

259
00:19:25,207 --> 00:19:27,876
To wipe out every record
regarding my past.

260
00:19:30,754 --> 00:19:32,714
If you can promise those two things,

261
00:19:33,632 --> 00:19:36,093
I'll consider it.

262
00:19:44,351 --> 00:19:46,562
I checked wherever I could, too.

263
00:19:47,312 --> 00:19:48,146
Yeah.

264
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,193
You have no idea, either?

265
00:19:54,444 --> 00:19:57,322
They arrested a civilian,
and nobody knows where he went.

266
00:19:57,406 --> 00:19:59,199
He's not on the news, either. Gosh.

267
00:20:01,451 --> 00:20:03,161
Anyway, okay, then.

268
00:20:03,245 --> 00:20:04,830
Thanks, bye.

269
00:20:16,425 --> 00:20:19,761
I really don't want to ask her
for a favor.

270
00:20:22,514 --> 00:20:23,348
Ms. Na,

271
00:20:24,183 --> 00:20:26,935
you got a call from the head of
the Women's Association in Changri-dong.

272
00:20:27,019 --> 00:20:28,770
Who? The Women's Association?

273
00:20:28,854 --> 00:20:29,813
Oh, Nam-yeon?

274
00:20:30,272 --> 00:20:31,648
Why would she call me?

275
00:20:31,732 --> 00:20:33,692
She said she had a favor to ask you.

276
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:35,777
Is that so?

277
00:20:37,154 --> 00:20:38,614
Guess she needs something.

278
00:20:39,531 --> 00:20:40,365
What's that?

279
00:20:40,449 --> 00:20:43,243
The bomb analysis you asked for
from the Kiyun-si explosions.

280
00:20:56,173 --> 00:21:01,220
MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEFENSE

281
00:21:09,102 --> 00:21:12,314
Oh, man.

282
00:21:23,075 --> 00:21:25,327
NA EUN-JAE

283
00:21:28,455 --> 00:21:33,377
Hello. To what do I owe the pleasure?

284
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:37,130
I wondered why you were rushing
to blame them on butane gas,

285
00:21:37,214 --> 00:21:38,924
but you've been
really doing your job, huh?

286
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:41,510
What's this absolute nonsense?

287
00:21:42,553 --> 00:21:44,888
<i>"HMX found."</i>

288
00:21:45,848 --> 00:21:48,392

produced in Korea."

289
00:21:48,475 --> 00:21:51,228
"A unique recipe,

00:21:51,311 --> 00:21:53,605

<i>"Same boat," my foot.</i>
<i>Why did you go behind my back?</i>

293
00:22:01,572 --> 00:22:05,576
I guess someone's been sneaking away
military supplies, huh?

294
00:22:05,993 --> 00:22:06,952
<i>Ms. Na.</i>

295
00:22:08,036 --> 00:22:09,329
I got this

00:22:10,163 --> 00:22:11,999
under control, all right?

297
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:13,876
Just wait a bit.

298

<i>I don't care what you do</i>
<i>to get some extra money,</i>

299

if this ruins the specialized zone plan.

300
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:24,011
I'm telling you,
that's not going to happen!

301

<i>Minister Kim.</i>

302
00:22:25,762 --> 00:22:27,055
Come on, Seok-jun.

303
00:22:27,514 --> 00:22:30,475
One wrong move, and you're done.

304
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:31,685
Good luck, okay?

305
00:22:33,353 --> 00:22:34,438
Damn it.

306
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:37,065
Why, that little...

307
00:22:38,025 --> 00:22:40,444
NA EUN-JAE

308
00:22:55,417 --> 00:22:56,460
Oh, my!

309
00:22:56,543 --> 00:22:59,463
My goodness. Did you come alone, Hui-ja?

310
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:02,382
It's just a short walk.
Why would I need someone with me?

311
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,384
Here.

312
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,136
What's this?

313
00:23:07,763 --> 00:23:09,014
Seaweed soup?

314
00:23:09,431 --> 00:23:11,975
It's full of mussels, my favorite.

315
00:23:12,643 --> 00:23:15,729
What's the special occasion?

316
00:23:16,271 --> 00:23:18,023
It's Min-seo's birthday today.

317
00:23:18,106 --> 00:23:20,484
Did you forget
your own daughter's birthday?

318
00:23:20,943 --> 00:23:23,820
You remember Min-seo's birthday?

319
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:25,447
You were crying your eyes out

320
00:23:25,531 --> 00:23:28,408
about your parents
not being near enough to help then.

321
00:23:28,492 --> 00:23:31,578
So I was the one
who made you seaweed soup.

322
00:23:31,662 --> 00:23:33,330
Why wouldn't I remember that?

323
00:23:34,957 --> 00:23:38,877
Oh, my, Hui-ja,
you remember everything now.

324
00:23:41,004 --> 00:23:42,714
Is that for your husband?

325
00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:45,259
No, for Myeong-o.

326
00:23:45,551 --> 00:23:47,761
I see. Myeong-o's mom?

327
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:49,805
She came by yesterday

328
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:53,642
and wouldn't stop talking about
how he got a perfect score.

329
00:23:54,726 --> 00:23:56,895
It's impressive
how well she's raising him by herself.

330
00:23:57,229 --> 00:23:59,606
Just wait and see.
He'll make it to Hanguk University.

331
00:24:03,569 --> 00:24:04,486
Right.

332
00:24:06,697 --> 00:24:09,700
I can take that to Myeong-o's mom for you.

333
00:24:09,783 --> 00:24:11,994
I'm seeing her later, anyway.

334
00:24:12,077 --> 00:24:13,829
- Will you do that for me?
- Yeah.

335
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:15,622
And...

336
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:17,666
Are you heading back?

337
00:24:17,749 --> 00:24:19,501
Let me tag along for some fresh air.

338
00:24:19,585 --> 00:24:21,545
You have to watch the store.
You can't leave.

339
00:24:21,628 --> 00:24:24,339
- It's a quick walk. Let's go.
- What?

340
00:24:24,423 --> 00:24:25,507
Hui-ja!

341
00:24:26,675 --> 00:24:28,010
Why'd you leave without telling me?

342
00:24:28,093 --> 00:24:29,845
I was looking for you everywhere!

343
00:24:30,512 --> 00:24:31,722
Why would you look for me?

344
00:24:35,601 --> 00:24:37,728
Because I missed you.

345
00:24:38,604 --> 00:24:39,479
Shall we?

346
00:24:39,938 --> 00:24:40,814
Okay.

347
00:24:41,607 --> 00:24:43,442
See you. Bye, Hui-ja.

348
00:24:45,944 --> 00:24:49,239
Hey, let's tell each other
where we're going

349
00:24:49,823 --> 00:24:51,116
before going anywhere.

350
00:25:03,629 --> 00:25:05,380
Hey, I'm here.

351
00:25:06,924 --> 00:25:09,218
I brought some side dishes for you.

352
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:14,431
Hui-ja even made seaweed soup for you.

353
00:25:15,641 --> 00:25:17,017
Let's see.

354
00:25:18,644 --> 00:25:19,645
Gosh.

355
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,939
I can tell who's dropped by

356
00:25:22,231 --> 00:25:25,526
just by looking at these containers.

357
00:25:26,985 --> 00:25:29,780
If you don't have an appetite,

358
00:25:29,905 --> 00:25:33,408
you should at least have some plain rice.

359
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:41,083
You're kidding me.

360
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,505
Hurry and eat.

361
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:49,049
I'm not leaving until you eat it all.

362
00:26:09,444 --> 00:26:10,279
What?

363
00:26:10,863 --> 00:26:12,281
Is it too salty?

364
00:26:13,031 --> 00:26:14,074
Too hot?

365
00:26:18,161 --> 00:26:20,205
You can't.

366
00:26:20,289 --> 00:26:23,083
You have to eat,
even if it's just a little bit.

367
00:26:23,166 --> 00:26:24,626
Okay? Here.

368
00:26:31,842 --> 00:26:32,676
What's this?

369
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:33,969
MAEUM LIFE INSURANCE
SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT

370
00:26:34,428 --> 00:26:35,929
The bus company brought it,

371
00:26:37,014 --> 00:26:39,016
asking me to sign it.

372
00:26:42,603 --> 00:26:44,563
I felt like

373
00:26:45,814 --> 00:26:48,525
once I sign that,
I'll never get to know...

374
00:26:50,569 --> 00:26:51,612
why...

375
00:26:53,447 --> 00:26:55,032
my Myeong-o died.

376
00:26:59,161 --> 00:27:00,329
Don't sign it.

377
00:27:01,205 --> 00:27:02,372
Don't do it.

378
00:27:02,456 --> 00:27:05,167
I can't let go
of Myeong-o like this, either.

379
00:27:07,169 --> 00:27:08,253
Don't sign it.

380
00:27:10,672 --> 00:27:12,174
Let's not do it, okay?

381
00:27:49,628 --> 00:27:54,049
MS. LEE, PLEASE DON'T SKIP YOUR MEALS
FROM JEONG-HWAN

382
00:27:56,301 --> 00:27:57,135
<i>Come in.</i>

383
00:27:57,219 --> 00:28:00,013
MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEFENSE

384
00:28:05,561 --> 00:28:07,062
On the day Kim In-seop was kidnapped,

385
00:28:07,145 --> 00:28:09,439
the 707th Unit was out
on a counter-terrorism mission.

386
00:28:09,523 --> 00:28:11,108
Who was in charge of the mission?

387
00:28:11,191 --> 00:28:12,651
The battalion commander,

388
00:28:12,734 --> 00:28:15,445
but he was directly ordered
by Minister Kim.

389
00:28:17,197 --> 00:28:20,200
And where did they take Kim In-seop to?

390
00:28:20,284 --> 00:28:23,912
The thing is,
the unit returned to the base,

391
00:28:23,996 --> 00:28:25,455
but nobody was with them.

392
00:28:27,666 --> 00:28:30,002
He's using the military
like a private service.

393
00:28:30,085 --> 00:28:33,297
And about the vehicle, H60 6789,
that you asked me to look into.

394
00:28:33,797 --> 00:28:36,341
It belongs to Colonel Jang Jun-hui's unit
from the Logistic Support Group.

395
00:28:36,884 --> 00:28:39,136
Look into the route
that the 707th Unit took to return.

396
00:28:39,595 --> 00:28:43,223
They must've snuck Kim In-seop
into Jang's vehicle on the way back.

397
00:28:43,557 --> 00:28:45,017
Yes, sir.

398
00:29:01,867 --> 00:29:02,701
Sit here.

399
00:29:13,462 --> 00:29:14,421
This video.

400
00:29:15,506 --> 00:29:16,465
Where did you get it?

401
00:29:17,549 --> 00:29:19,343
Get me my lawyer.

402
00:29:19,718 --> 00:29:22,387
Let me ask you one more time.

403
00:29:23,222 --> 00:29:25,057
The vehicle in the accident disappeared,

404
00:29:25,641 --> 00:29:29,436
but we found its dashcam footage
on your computer.

405
00:29:30,187 --> 00:29:32,523
How did you know
that the vehicle disappeared?

406
00:29:33,565 --> 00:29:34,983
Did you guys take it?

407
00:29:36,735 --> 00:29:39,196
You uploaded an article,

408
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,657
claiming that a bomb caused
the Kiyun Intersection accident, right?

409
00:29:42,241 --> 00:29:43,575
Who's behind it?

410
00:29:44,034 --> 00:29:45,118
A terrorist group?

411
00:29:46,078 --> 00:29:46,912
North Korea?

412
00:29:47,538 --> 00:29:48,705
A politician?

413
00:29:52,376 --> 00:29:55,546
What a huge stretch.

414
00:29:56,088 --> 00:30:00,217
So this is how you framed people
into being spies, huh?

415
00:30:00,551 --> 00:30:03,512
I'm a journalist,

416
00:30:03,595 --> 00:30:05,180
and all I did was do my job.

417
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:07,349
I wasn't hired by anyone.

418
00:30:07,766 --> 00:30:09,560
I was just covering the news!

419
00:30:11,895 --> 00:30:13,230
How passionate.

420
00:30:13,522 --> 00:30:16,650
We have plenty of time,
so let's take it slow.

421
00:30:23,657 --> 00:30:25,826
- Nobody's here?
- No.

422
00:30:25,909 --> 00:30:28,328
I think we'll find Producer Kim soon.

423
00:30:28,829 --> 00:30:29,705
How?

424
00:30:31,498 --> 00:30:33,375
I'll be getting information from JDD.

425
00:30:34,293 --> 00:30:35,919
- JDD?
- Oh, gosh.

426
00:30:36,295 --> 00:30:37,129
Why are you here?

427
00:30:37,212 --> 00:30:40,382
- He asked me to fix his computer.
- Yeah.

428
00:30:40,674 --> 00:30:43,385
Anyway, they're looking for him,
and they'll call me soon.

429
00:30:43,468 --> 00:30:44,845
Then I'll go and get him.

430
00:30:44,928 --> 00:30:47,639
- Let's go together.
- I'll go with you, too.

431
00:30:47,723 --> 00:30:49,933
Calm down. I'll go alone.

432
00:30:50,017 --> 00:30:51,768
Why? Are we embarrassing?

433
00:30:51,852 --> 00:30:54,396
No, it's dangerous.
I'll go alone this time.

434
00:30:54,479 --> 00:30:55,355
Come on...

435
00:31:01,278 --> 00:31:02,988
Why is nobody talking now that I'm here?

436
00:31:03,739 --> 00:31:05,073
We've been quiet the whole time.

437
00:31:05,324 --> 00:31:06,825
- Right?
- Yeah.

438
00:31:08,869 --> 00:31:10,370
Sorry for being late.

439
00:31:10,454 --> 00:31:12,289
- What took you so long?
- Why are you so late?

440
00:31:12,372 --> 00:31:14,875
- You have to be on time!
- That's right!

441
00:31:14,958 --> 00:31:16,919
You kept the grown-ups waiting.
You can't do that.

442
00:31:17,002 --> 00:31:18,629
- That's right.
- For goodness' sake.

443
00:31:18,712 --> 00:31:19,671
Sorry.

444
00:31:20,839 --> 00:31:21,673
It's fine.

445
00:31:23,175 --> 00:31:24,510
I checked the footage all night,

446
00:31:24,593 --> 00:31:26,929
and nothing peculiar
was caught on the cameras.

447
00:31:27,012 --> 00:31:28,263
Hey, go.

448
00:31:28,347 --> 00:31:29,473
Yes.

449
00:31:29,556 --> 00:31:31,808
I've spoken to a lawyer,

450
00:31:31,892 --> 00:31:33,602
and he says it's best
not to mess with the military.

451
00:31:33,685 --> 00:31:35,854
Even Officer Park patrols other towns,

452
00:31:35,938 --> 00:31:37,272
saying our town is safe.

453
00:31:37,356 --> 00:31:38,941
There haven't been any reports.

454
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:44,196
I also made some calls,
but didn't find anything useful.

455
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:46,198
They would have been smart.

456
00:31:47,533 --> 00:31:51,328
Then shouldn't we
find a way to outsmart them?

457
00:31:54,373 --> 00:31:55,457
Yes, we should.

458
00:31:56,333 --> 00:31:58,418
- Don't worry too much.
- That's right.

459
00:31:58,502 --> 00:32:00,170
We have Kang here...

460
00:32:06,009 --> 00:32:08,011
who works for an insurance company.

461
00:32:08,095 --> 00:32:11,306
Everyone has
proper health insurance, right?

462
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:13,725
We have nothing to worry about, then.

463
00:32:17,521 --> 00:32:22,401
HARDWARE DREAM TREE STATIONERY

464
00:32:22,484 --> 00:32:24,695
Why is everyone so reckless?

465
00:32:24,778 --> 00:32:26,280
How can you suggest uploading the video

466
00:32:26,363 --> 00:32:28,240
after seeing Producer Kim get kidnapped?

467
00:32:28,323 --> 00:32:30,868
What if something happens
to you guys, too?

468
00:32:31,285 --> 00:32:33,453
What do you think, huh?

469
00:32:34,246 --> 00:32:37,749
Are you going to stay still
if I get kidnapped?

470
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,001
Yes.

471
00:32:40,294 --> 00:32:42,212
I'd go save you, you jerk.

472
00:32:44,339 --> 00:32:45,465
You? Saving me?

473
00:32:46,049 --> 00:32:47,301
That'd never happen.

474
00:32:50,721 --> 00:32:51,680
Goodnight, then.

475
00:32:53,348 --> 00:32:54,474
Hey.

476
00:32:55,267 --> 00:32:56,185
Are you sulking?

477
00:32:59,479 --> 00:33:01,815
You are. My goodness.

478
00:33:09,907 --> 00:33:11,742
Make sure to drop by before work tomorrow.

479
00:33:46,568 --> 00:33:49,821
With this, you'll become Thor himself.

480
00:33:53,825 --> 00:33:55,911
Honey! Hurry up.

481
00:34:05,295 --> 00:34:07,840
Honey, where's Do-yeon's backpack?

482
00:34:08,674 --> 00:34:11,552
Is this the backpack
you're speaking of, ma'am?

483
00:34:13,512 --> 00:34:14,638
Yes, it is.

484
00:34:15,472 --> 00:34:17,224
Do-yeon, get up. Let's go.

485
00:34:17,307 --> 00:34:18,308

What ice cream?

490
00:34:29,236 --> 00:34:31,822
That man gave me ice cream.

- Do-yeon.
- Yeah?

499
00:34:54,052 --> 00:34:58,724
Are you sure it was the man on TV
who gave you the ice cream?

500
00:34:58,807 --> 00:35:00,434
- Yes.
- Have a great day.

501
00:35:01,226 --> 00:35:03,270
It wasn't someone
who just looked like him?

502
00:35:03,353 --> 00:35:05,939
No, it was him.
He looked exactly the same.

503
00:35:06,023 --> 00:35:07,357
Hi.

504
00:35:08,233 --> 00:35:09,443
Okay, then.

505
00:35:11,028 --> 00:35:13,697
Did he only give you the ice cream,

506
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:15,908
or did he give some to other kids, too?

507
00:35:15,991 --> 00:35:19,077
I don't know. He said it was from you.

508
00:35:20,162 --> 00:35:21,705
Is that so?

509
00:35:24,833 --> 00:35:26,335
It's Ms. Olivia!

510
00:35:38,472 --> 00:35:40,516

511
00:35:40,974 --> 00:35:42,226
This is nothing.

512
00:35:43,143 --> 00:35:44,520

00:37:41,512 --> 00:37:42,346
No.

532
00:37:43,347 --> 00:37:45,015
Just something personal.

533
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:47,267
I see.

534
00:37:58,529 --> 00:37:59,530
See you around.

535
00:37:59,613 --> 00:38:00,447
Yes, sir.

536
00:38:05,327 --> 00:38:06,286
Sir.

537
00:38:13,377 --> 00:38:17,464
What are those little rats
whispering about?

538
00:38:18,131 --> 00:38:19,967
MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEFENSE

539
00:38:40,821 --> 00:38:41,738
Hey.

540
00:38:42,489 --> 00:38:44,283
Something smells fishy around here.

541
00:38:45,158 --> 00:38:46,243
Clean up the site.

542
00:38:54,209 --> 00:38:56,837
Damn it, this sucks.

543
00:38:57,171 --> 00:38:58,297
Man...

544
00:39:01,133 --> 00:39:02,551
This is total bullshit.

545
00:39:02,801 --> 00:39:04,011
Damn it.

546
00:39:05,429 --> 00:39:08,223
That crazy bastard!

547
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:14,688
INSURANCE BASTARD

548
00:39:15,105 --> 00:39:17,399
Damn it! You've got to be kidding me!

549
00:39:17,482 --> 00:39:19,526
Just let me eat, okay?

550
00:39:24,615 --> 00:39:26,116
How are you, sir?

551
00:39:26,491 --> 00:39:28,827
I'm always busy working hard, you know?

552
00:39:28,994 --> 00:39:30,370
How are you feeling?

553
00:39:32,122 --> 00:39:34,791
You know, all thanks to you,

554
00:39:34,875 --> 00:39:36,084
I'm still in pain.

555
00:39:37,753 --> 00:39:41,757
<i>Don't tell me you resent me</i>
<i>or want to curse me.</i>

556
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:46,929
Curse you? I hate cursing.

557
00:39:47,262 --> 00:39:49,389
That's why I don't even go to the
beach in the summer.

558
00:39:49,473 --> 00:39:50,766
Can't let the heat make me curse.

559
00:39:52,351 --> 00:39:54,770
I don't even go to saunas
because I don't want to curse, you know?

560
00:39:54,853 --> 00:39:57,481
<i>Good, as you should.</i>

561
00:39:58,273 --> 00:39:59,441
<i>Anyway, Sang-ho,</i>

562
00:39:59,733 --> 00:40:03,153
I've got a task that's very hard for me
but very easy for you.

563
00:40:03,237 --> 00:40:04,404
Could you help me?

564
00:40:04,821 --> 00:40:07,449
Feel free to say no.
I'll visit you in person, then.

565
00:40:07,783 --> 00:40:09,826
Oh, not at all.

566
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:11,703
Of course I'll help you.

567
00:40:11,954 --> 00:40:13,539
Thanks, Sang-ho.

568
00:40:48,198 --> 00:40:49,032
Ta-da.

569
00:40:51,535 --> 00:40:52,578
What's this? A gun?

570
00:40:52,661 --> 00:40:54,705
Come on. It's a taser gun.

571
00:40:54,788 --> 00:40:56,206
I modified it,

572
00:40:56,290 --> 00:40:58,876
so it's much more powerful
than store-bought ones.

573
00:40:59,251 --> 00:41:01,170
It's stronger than what the police use,
so be careful.

574
00:41:01,253 --> 00:41:03,463
If you get hit by this, you're finished.

575
00:41:03,922 --> 00:41:04,923
One more thing.

576
00:41:06,258 --> 00:41:07,384
This is the real deal.

577
00:41:13,765 --> 00:41:16,602
You can shoot three times
after loading it just once,

578
00:41:16,685 --> 00:41:18,103
like a gun.

579
00:41:18,353 --> 00:41:19,354
Sick, right?

580
00:41:22,441 --> 00:41:23,901
You want me to guard myself with this?

581
00:41:23,984 --> 00:41:26,361
No, it's for the bad guys.

582
00:41:27,237 --> 00:41:28,488
Don't kill them.

583
00:41:28,572 --> 00:41:30,032
Just incapacitate them with this.

584
00:41:30,324 --> 00:41:31,867
You're not in JDD anymore.

585
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:33,493
<i>You have to think about your family, too.</i>

586
00:41:34,244 --> 00:41:35,621
<i>Don't cause too much trouble.</i>

587
00:42:08,195 --> 00:42:10,155
Seriously...

588
00:42:43,772 --> 00:42:44,815
Where is he going?

589
00:42:44,898 --> 00:42:47,734
Hold on. Where is this?

590
00:42:49,778 --> 00:42:52,739
- He's not on the highway.
- No.

591
00:42:52,823 --> 00:42:53,907
What are you looking at?

592
00:43:02,207 --> 00:43:04,001
Just my phone, why?

593
00:43:04,334 --> 00:43:05,586
Yeah, I know.

594
00:43:05,669 --> 00:43:06,962
What are you looking at?

595
00:43:07,337 --> 00:43:10,465
Just a bunch of things.
Some reels, you know?

596
00:43:12,217 --> 00:43:13,343
Why are you here?

597
00:43:13,635 --> 00:43:15,095
Me?

598
00:43:15,179 --> 00:43:16,138
I called him here.

599
00:43:16,221 --> 00:43:19,391
I needed him to reinstall
the cameras from yesterday.

600
00:43:19,474 --> 00:43:21,727
Yeah, I'm here to pick them up.

601
00:43:24,396 --> 00:43:25,772
You know what I think?

602
00:43:26,899 --> 00:43:28,442
You two

603
00:43:28,525 --> 00:43:32,529
and Mr. Choi are up to something.

604
00:43:40,370 --> 00:43:41,496
<i>Are you on your way?</i>

605
00:43:42,706 --> 00:43:45,000
I'll be back after I drive Min-seo home.

606
00:43:45,334 --> 00:43:46,752
Wait right here.

607
00:43:46,835 --> 00:43:47,711
Yes, ma'am.

608
00:43:55,344 --> 00:43:58,055
Man, what do we do now? She's so scary.

609
00:43:58,138 --> 00:44:00,390
Why are you so scared?

610
00:44:00,474 --> 00:44:02,476
Just go and reinstall the cameras.

611
00:44:02,559 --> 00:44:03,602
A perfect alibi.

612
00:44:06,396 --> 00:44:07,606
Get going, will you?

613
00:44:07,689 --> 00:44:09,358
She told us to wait here!

614
00:44:09,441 --> 00:44:10,651
Oh, right.

615
00:44:17,491 --> 00:44:19,034
All right. Look at this.

616
00:44:19,952 --> 00:44:20,786
Right here.

617
00:44:52,693 --> 00:44:53,735
Hey, honey.

618
00:44:54,111 --> 00:44:55,529
Can you take a cab and pick up Min-seo?

619
00:44:55,612 --> 00:44:56,989
I have something to do.

620
00:44:57,739 --> 00:44:58,574
Okay.

621
00:45:39,698 --> 00:45:41,742
MAGNIFYING MEDIA

622
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:09,436
Ms. Jung!

623
00:46:16,818 --> 00:46:17,653
Are you okay?

624
00:46:17,736 --> 00:46:18,987
Yeah, go after him.

625
00:46:44,263 --> 00:46:45,264
Yes?

626
00:46:45,973 --> 00:46:46,932
<i>We failed</i>

627
00:46:47,975 --> 00:46:49,184
<i>to clean up the site.</i>

628
00:46:53,522 --> 00:46:56,400
You piece of trash, you had one job!

629
00:47:01,864 --> 00:47:02,823
Hey.

630
00:47:04,074 --> 00:47:06,410
Get rid of Kim In-seop.

631
00:47:08,453 --> 00:47:09,997
Get rid of him. Get...

632
00:47:11,248 --> 00:47:13,125
Kill him, you moron.

633
00:47:13,208 --> 00:47:15,669
Yes, for real, you idiot!

634
00:47:16,628 --> 00:47:19,214
You better not leave any traces,
all right?

635
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:21,466
Don't mess this up.

636
00:49:24,798 --> 00:49:27,718
Wow, I didn't think it'd actually work!

637
00:49:42,357 --> 00:49:43,317
Drag him out.

638
00:49:43,984 --> 00:49:46,445
Wait. Where are we going?

639
00:49:46,528 --> 00:49:48,238
Where are you taking me?

640
00:49:48,322 --> 00:49:49,698
Hey, where are you taking me?

641
00:49:50,365 --> 00:49:51,450
Where are you taking me?

642
00:49:51,783 --> 00:49:53,452
Just tell me where we're going.

643
00:49:53,535 --> 00:49:55,537
Why won't you tell me?

644
00:50:05,589 --> 00:50:06,924
Fine.

645
00:50:07,007 --> 00:50:08,217
I get it!

646
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:10,511
Hey, do you know how wrong this is?

647
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:24,149
Where is this?

648
00:50:25,234 --> 00:50:26,944
Where the hell is this?

649
00:50:28,028 --> 00:50:28,862
Quiet.

650
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:20,664
No! Please, no!

651
00:51:20,747 --> 00:51:23,250
Producer Kim, it's me.

652
00:51:28,505 --> 00:51:29,840
Mr. Choi...

653
00:51:33,302 --> 00:51:35,679
Mr. Choi...

654
00:51:37,306 --> 00:51:38,390
<i>I got him out.</i>

655
00:51:39,850 --> 00:51:41,810
I'll send you the coordinates. Head there.

656
00:51:42,603 --> 00:51:44,605
That's the safest place for now.

657
00:51:45,731 --> 00:51:46,565
Understood.

658
00:51:47,441 --> 00:51:48,400
Okay.

659
00:51:53,572 --> 00:51:55,199
No one's following us.

660
00:51:56,408 --> 00:51:58,952
Won't they find us
once they run the license plate?

661
00:51:59,536 --> 00:52:01,163
It's okay. This isn't my car.

662
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:03,248
Are you hurt anywhere?

663
00:52:07,211 --> 00:52:08,212
No.

664
00:52:10,297 --> 00:52:11,757
Where were we, by the way?

665
00:52:12,841 --> 00:52:16,386
Seemed like an abandoned
military intelligence facility.

666
00:52:17,137 --> 00:52:18,138
I see.

667
00:52:23,352 --> 00:52:25,103
Who are you, really?

668
00:52:25,979 --> 00:52:28,023
- Me?
- Yes.

669
00:52:28,106 --> 00:52:29,358
Didn't I tell you?

670
00:52:29,441 --> 00:52:30,943
I work for Veotigo Insurance.

671
00:52:31,026 --> 00:52:32,611
Not in sales.

672
00:52:32,694 --> 00:52:36,365
I'm in the SIU Team.
I investigate insurance fraud attempts.

673
00:52:37,115 --> 00:52:39,076
No, that's not what I'm asking.

674
00:52:39,159 --> 00:52:40,536
Who are you, really?

675
00:52:45,749 --> 00:52:46,834
A friendly neighbor?

676
00:52:47,918 --> 00:52:48,752
What?

677
00:53:08,647 --> 00:53:10,232
Welcome back, sir!

678
00:53:11,024 --> 00:53:12,276
Sorry, I took too long.

679
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:15,153
It's fine.

680
00:53:15,237 --> 00:53:16,655
It wasn't long at all.

681
00:53:19,241 --> 00:53:20,868
You know, your face...

682
00:53:22,703 --> 00:53:23,829
is pretty cute.

683
00:53:28,292 --> 00:53:29,334
Thanks for today.

684
00:53:31,128 --> 00:53:32,254
Oh, sorry.

685
00:53:33,213 --> 00:53:34,506
Hop in.

686
00:53:36,884 --> 00:53:38,594
- Okay.
- The key is inside, right?

687
00:53:38,677 --> 00:53:40,095
Yes, it's inside, sir.

688
00:53:42,556 --> 00:53:43,932
Goodbye, sir.

689
00:53:51,148 --> 00:53:53,442
Why isn't the GPS tracker returning here?

690
00:53:54,109 --> 00:53:55,569
Why is it going to Seoul?

691
00:53:55,652 --> 00:53:57,988
Do you think something went wrong?

692
00:53:58,071 --> 00:53:59,239
What happened?

693
00:54:00,824 --> 00:54:02,367
Stop it, will you?

694
00:54:02,451 --> 00:54:04,745
Why do you keep scaring us?

695
00:54:04,828 --> 00:54:06,038
What now?

696
00:54:06,121 --> 00:54:08,540
You said something about a GPS tracker.

697
00:54:08,624 --> 00:54:09,833
I did?

698
00:54:09,917 --> 00:54:11,335
- Did I?
- No!

699
00:54:12,044 --> 00:54:14,421
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

700
00:54:15,506 --> 00:54:16,757
CHOI KANG

701
00:54:17,090 --> 00:54:18,133
Answer it.

702
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,844
- I will.
- Answer it.

703
00:54:21,303 --> 00:54:22,804
I was going to, okay?

704
00:54:26,934 --> 00:54:28,644
Hey, why are you calling so late?

705
00:54:28,727 --> 00:54:30,020
<i>Why else?</i>

706
00:54:30,103 --> 00:54:32,648
<i>The mission was a success.</i>
<i>I'm on my way back.</i>

707
00:54:33,065 --> 00:54:34,775
Oh, you're heading home from work?

708
00:54:35,943 --> 00:54:38,195
I thought you just had bad knees.
Is your hearing bad too?

709
00:54:38,529 --> 00:54:39,863
Yeah, I should kneel and pray.

710
00:54:39,947 --> 00:54:43,784
We should all pray
for Producer Kim's safe return.

711
00:54:45,118 --> 00:54:47,120
I'll send you the address. Meet me there.

712
00:54:47,204 --> 00:54:48,288
<i>Okay, got it.</i>

713
00:54:48,372 --> 00:54:49,873
<i>Drive home safe.</i>

714
00:54:52,292 --> 00:54:53,752
What is he saying?

715
00:54:56,630 --> 00:54:57,798
See?

716
00:54:57,881 --> 00:54:59,299
He's heading home from work.

717
00:54:59,633 --> 00:55:01,260
I heard everything.

718
00:55:03,345 --> 00:55:04,596
Stop lying!

719
00:55:05,347 --> 00:55:08,267
Who are you, the Bionic Woman? Gosh.

720
00:55:11,812 --> 00:55:12,938
We could hear everything.

721
00:55:15,065 --> 00:55:18,235
SAFE GAS STATION

722
00:55:37,629 --> 00:55:39,840
<i>Nobody knows about this place,</i>

723
00:55:39,923 --> 00:55:41,717
<i>which should earn you some time.</i>

724
00:55:53,437 --> 00:55:54,938
<i>There are two storage units.</i>

725
00:55:55,022 --> 00:55:58,066
<i>Enter the unit on the right,</i>
<i>and push the barrels to the side.</i>

726
00:55:58,442 --> 00:55:59,735
<i>You'll see a door.</i>

727
00:56:42,778 --> 00:56:44,029
What's all this?

728
00:56:57,125 --> 00:56:58,460
Good work.

729
00:56:59,378 --> 00:57:00,629
It may be inconvenient,

730
00:57:01,505 --> 00:57:03,048
but stay here for the time being.

731
00:57:03,131 --> 00:57:04,174
You'll be safe here.

732
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:18,021
- How far are we going?
- Can you be quiet?

733
00:57:18,105 --> 00:57:19,064
Come on.

734
00:57:20,023 --> 00:57:22,651
- Walk faster, all right?
- Are you sure this is the right place?

735
00:57:23,735 --> 00:57:25,070
You sure this place is safe?

736
00:57:25,696 --> 00:57:27,406
Oh, gosh, Producer Kim!

737
00:57:38,333 --> 00:57:41,795
Well, I was going to come alone, but...

738
00:57:43,213 --> 00:57:44,506
- But what?
- What?

739
00:57:44,590 --> 00:57:45,924
What's your problem?

740
00:57:46,008 --> 00:57:47,050
Are we just strangers to you?

741
00:57:47,342 --> 00:57:49,094
No, we're much closer than that.

742
00:57:49,178 --> 00:57:50,429
Right, Byeong-nam?

743
00:57:50,512 --> 00:57:53,056
Of course. We're...

744
00:57:53,473 --> 00:57:56,643
We're close neighbors, like family.

745
00:58:00,606 --> 00:58:01,690
You heard that, right?

746
00:58:02,357 --> 00:58:05,152
They're my close neighbors, like family.

747
00:58:08,405 --> 00:58:09,364
Yes.

748
00:59:16,723 --> 00:59:19,643
HEROES NEXT DOOR

749
00:59:21,979 --> 00:59:23,480
It's here.

750
00:59:23,564 --> 00:59:24,398
Turn left.

751
00:59:25,148 --> 00:59:26,275
This way.

752
00:59:28,527 --> 00:59:29,862
Let me see that.

753
00:59:29,945 --> 00:59:31,321
No, I'm right.

754
00:59:31,405 --> 00:59:33,824
- Where are we going?
- Just follow me.

755
00:59:34,867 --> 00:59:35,993
This way.

756
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:47,004
I knew it. You're all busted.

757
00:59:47,462 --> 00:59:50,132
I knew it when you left me alone
to watch the store.

758
00:59:50,215 --> 00:59:51,550
You're all busted!

759
00:59:59,641 --> 01:00:01,977
They definitely came this way.

760
01:00:06,231 --> 01:00:07,107
That's odd.

761
01:00:08,066 --> 01:00:09,026
Where did they go?

762
01:00:17,659 --> 01:00:18,952
Nam-yeon!

763
01:00:20,204 --> 01:00:21,330
Honey?

764
01:00:22,497 --> 01:00:23,624
Byeong-nam?

765
01:00:25,083 --> 01:00:28,545
You guys are so funny. This is hilarious!

766
01:00:28,629 --> 01:00:29,755
That's enough now.

767
01:00:29,838 --> 01:00:31,924
You can stop hiding and come out.

768
01:00:32,007 --> 01:00:33,467
I won't get mad.

769
01:00:34,134 --> 01:00:35,511
Yeah, this is hilarious.

770
01:00:36,261 --> 01:00:38,055
I can't go to sleep like this.

771
01:00:38,138 --> 01:00:41,850
Come on. Come out and talk.

772
01:00:42,684 --> 01:00:43,977
Where are you?

773
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:50,526
Man, this sucks.

774
01:00:54,655 --> 01:00:56,406
Who snuck away the bombs?

775
01:00:56,490 --> 01:00:58,075
I guess some big names are involved.

776
01:00:58,158 --> 01:01:01,119
<i>I hear you've been nosing around</i>
<i>here and there.</i>

777
01:01:01,203 --> 01:01:04,331
<i>How can we find that tiny button</i>
<i>in such a big area?</i>

778
01:01:04,414 --> 01:01:05,249
<i>Shall we begin?</i>

779
01:01:05,332 --> 01:01:06,959
<i>Are we going in immediately</i>
<i>once we find the location?</i>

780
01:01:07,042 --> 01:01:09,586
- I have plans tomorrow evening.
- Cancel it.

781
01:01:09,670 --> 01:01:11,880
<i>You've been acting weird</i>
<i>since moving here.</i>

782
01:01:11,964 --> 01:01:13,590
<i>So what's the plan?</i>

783
01:01:13,674 --> 01:01:15,717
<i>- They seem connected to Kim In-seop.</i>
- Bring it on!

784
01:01:15,801 --> 01:01:17,094
Get your guys to look into them.

785
01:01:17,177 --> 01:01:19,763
<i>Byeong-nam and Nam-yeon won't answer!</i>

786
01:01:20,722 --> 01:01:21,890
You're dead.

787
01:01:24,393 --> 01:01:26,395
