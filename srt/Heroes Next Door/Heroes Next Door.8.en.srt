00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:38,956
HEROES NEXT DOOR

2
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:42,960
THIS DRAMA IS A WORK OF FICTION.
ALL CHARACTERS, PROFESSIONS, PLACES,

3
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:43,961
COMPANIES, ORGANIZATIONS,
ETHNIC GROUPS AND EVENTS ARE NOT REAL.

4
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:44,962
ALL CHILD AND ANIMAL SCENES WERE FILMED
SAFELY UNDER EXPERT SUPERVISION.

5
00:00:45,921 --> 00:00:47,339
I'll be asking the questions here.

6
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:51,885
Did you give the order to abduct my wife?

7
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:57,015
That's right. I did.

8
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:59,101
Why?

9
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:00,602
Why do you think?

10
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:02,938
To get you, of course.

11
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:06,024
Who set off the bombs in Changri-dong?

12
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:09,486
That's none of your business.

13
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,196
I told you. Don't make me repeat myself.

14
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:16,034
It was Sullivan! It was Jame Sullivan!

15
00:01:17,953 --> 00:01:22,124
I confirmed
that Sullivan bought the bombs.

16
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:27,421
Watch out!

17
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:30,424
My Myeong-o...

18
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:33,885
- Where did you get that ice cream?
- That man gave me ice cream.

19
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:36,263
Guess who we ran into on our way home?

20
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:37,180
Sullivan.

21
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:39,057
YOU'RE MAKING THINGS COMPLICATED
JDD SPECIAL OPERATIONS FORCES, CHOI KANG

22
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:48,358
You've got the wrong guy.

23
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:51,194
Who says?

24
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,548
I'm not dead?

25
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:14,092
I'm alive?

26
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:17,429
Oh, that hurts!

27
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:18,847
Oh, gosh, I'm alive!

28
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:20,557
Man, that hurts.

29
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:23,226
But I'm alive!

30
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,269
What's this?

31
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:28,899
What the...

32
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:35,364
Why, that bastard!

33
00:02:36,198 --> 00:02:37,324
Where did he go?

34
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,207
What's going on?

35
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,959
Minister Kim Seok-jun.

36
00:02:49,628 --> 00:02:50,837
You're under arrest for violating

37
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:53,924
the Military Supplies Management Act
and the Specific Crimes Punishment Act.

38
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:55,676
Under arrest?

39
00:02:56,802 --> 00:02:57,844
Me?

40
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:06,770
Gosh, this hurts so much.

41
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,857
I need to see a doctor first.

42
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:24,139
We finally meet, Mr. Choi Kang.

43
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:26,767
Did you set off the bombs
in our neighborhood?

44
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:28,435
Bombs?

45
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:33,482
I thought the news said it was butane gas.

46
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:38,320
There was the bus explosion too, right?

47
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:40,489
The Minister told me everything.

48
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:43,700
It was your message
on the laptop too, wasn't it?

49
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:46,828
How did you know about me?

50
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,291
JDD.

51
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:57,005
You think this is funny?

52
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:04,596
I'm only keeping you alive
because I've got questions for you.

53
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:06,306
So you'd better answer carefully.

54
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:10,685
CIA's information network and my wealth.

55
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:14,064
Does that answer your question?

56
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,982
Why did you approach Do-yeon?

57
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:18,235
She's a lot like Charlotte.

58
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,487
Charlotte...

59
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:23,573
also loved bunnies.

60
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:25,534
All of this because of Charlotte?

61
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:27,202
What would you have done in my place?

62
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:29,621
Innocent people died because of you.

63
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:30,539
What about my daughter?

64
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,499
Why did she have to die?

65
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:38,004
Anyway,

66
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:42,008
thanks for helping me
get rid of the Minister.

67
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:43,802
Get rid of him?

68
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:45,971
What do you mean?

69
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:50,350
It's none of your business,
so just forget about it.

70
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:54,479
I won't let you off with a warning
if you meddle with my plans again.

71
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:56,022
Think of your daughter.

72
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:28,138
- Let's just grab one more drink.
- No.

73
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,931
I drank too much today.

74
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:34,519
Are you crazy? Call a chauffeur!

75
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:36,938
There he goes again,
knowing his daddy will save him.

76
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:38,315
I'm fine.

77
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:40,191
I'm not drunk at all.

78
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:42,027
You crazy bastard.

79
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,362
You'd better not drive!

80
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:11,389
Na Eun-jae speaking.

81
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:15,018
Hello?

82
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:19,230
<i>A person killed someone</i>
<i>while driving drunk.</i>

83
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:22,567
<i>Another person manipulated a court ruling.</i>

84
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,487
What should be done about such people?

85
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:28,907
Sullivan?

86
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,535
They should pay
for what they've done, right?

87
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,580
What are you trying to pull here?

88
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:52,263
Hello?

89
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:20,375
What the hell is this guy saying?

90
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:43,940
Mr. Kwon, it's Eun-jae.

91
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:44,858
<i>Hey.</i>

92
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:46,651
Is everything okay with you?

93
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,571
<i>Yes, why do you ask?</i>

94
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:50,947
It's nothing.

95
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,366
Let's get dinner together sometime.

96
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:56,077
<i>Sir, U-seong got into a car accident.</i>

97
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:57,328
<i>He's in a critical condition.</i>

98
00:08:57,412 --> 00:08:59,497
<i>What did you just say?</i>

99
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:00,582
Mr. Kwon?

100
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:02,667
What's going on?

101
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:11,968
<i>They should pay</i>
<i>for what they've done, right?</i>

102
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:25,356
THE LEGENDARY DROPKICK

103
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,614
Did you hear?

104
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:35,325
The son of the National Assembly Speaker
died in a car accident last night.

105
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:36,868
You reap what you sow.

106
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:40,205
Hey, a person died here.

107
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:42,499
He also ran someone over to death.

108
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:45,043
The daughter of the famous James Sullivan.

109
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:47,504
Rumor has it
that he was also drunk that time.

110
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:50,256
- Really?
- Yeah.

111
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:54,219
The excuse was that he was on duty
on the day of his discharge,

112
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:56,554
and the court just let him go
after ruling him innocent.

113
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:59,641
Nobody's ever on duty
on the day of their discharge. Ridiculous.

114
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:00,934
Never.

115
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,979
But you wouldn't know that, would you?
You didn't serve.

116
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:10,193
Hey, I know that much.

117
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,444
Anyway,

118
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,824
he only got out of that
because of his dad.

119
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:18,701
Military law is actually much stricter.

120
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:21,538
There's the brig
and even the disciplinary training.

121
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:24,541
You know what brigs are?

122
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:29,796
Come on. Of course I do.

123
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,422
Bricks are what you build houses with.

124
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:35,009
Just keep eating.

125
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:39,681
Now that I think about it,

126
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:41,933
I feel so bad for James Sullivan.

127
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:42,851
Me too.

128
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:45,854
You can get out of anything in Korea
if you've got connections.

129
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:48,189
Even in court.

130
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:50,316
That's why I quit being a lawyer.

131
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:52,318
I couldn't stand it.

132
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:02,495
Excuse me.

133
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:03,913
Where are you going?

134
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:05,039
To the bathroom.

135
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:07,584
He's going to the bathroom
in the middle of a meal? Gross.

136
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:24,934
Did you find anything?

137
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:28,062
Sullivan bought all the arms

138
00:11:28,146 --> 00:11:30,190
that the Minister snuck away
to the Middle East.

139
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:32,609
And all of that has returned to Korea?

140
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:34,777
<i>We're not sure of how many.</i>

141
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:38,364
What about Novus?

142
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:39,991
I met Sullivan there last night.

143
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:41,409
I know.

144
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:44,370
But the warehouse is empty now,

145
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:46,289
and we can't locate Sullivan, either.

146
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:47,665
<i>What about the people around him?</i>

147
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:57,175
A few days ago, he was photographed

148
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:59,677
with a member of the assembly
at a hotel lobby.

149
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:01,596
Kiyun-si's representative,

150
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,306
Na Eun-jae.

151
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:04,641
Na Eun-jae?

152
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:07,602
Are you saying

153
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:09,854
<i>she has something to do with Sullivan?</i>

154
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:14,734
Ms. Na seems to have helped
the son of the Speaker get an acquittal.

155
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:16,819
<i>Both she and the Minister</i>

156
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:19,739
<i>purchased land in Kiyun-si</i>
<i>under borrowed names.</i>

157
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:23,618
<i>And the Speaker got Kiyun-si appointed</i>
<i>for the specialized IT zone.</i>

158
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:27,121
So it's a personal vendetta.

159
00:12:27,956 --> 00:12:29,499
<i>I think so too.</i>

160
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:34,170
Na Eun-jae must be next, then.

161
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:39,759
SAFE GAS STATION

162
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:44,097
Hello!

163
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:46,349
Did you see the news about Kim Seok-jun?

164
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:49,227
Where's Producer Kim?

165
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:51,896
Oh, right. He's somewhere else now.

166
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:55,316
It feels so empty here without him.

167
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,443
You can see him once the case is over.

168
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:59,195
I know that.

169
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:01,739
Who caused the bomb explosions, though?

170
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,074
The news didn't cover that.

171
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:05,410
Did you hear anything about it?

172
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:08,663
No, it's still under investigation.

173
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:14,877
Could you please tell me
if Mr. Lee tells you anything, Su-jin?

174
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:20,216
Come on. You have to tell me.

175
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,509
You promise?

176
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:25,972
Ms. Lee, did you see the news?

177
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:30,018
Hey, Yong-hui.

178
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:33,938
Man, why does he keep getting in my way?

179
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:35,606
Promise me. Come on.

180
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:43,323
Fine, I'll let you know.

181
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:45,450
Really? You promised, okay?

182
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:46,659
Where's your pinky?

183
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:48,411
You'll tell me first, okay?

184
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:50,580
My pinky will be waiting here
until you tell me!

185
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:53,249
What do you think you're doing?

186
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:54,208
What?

187
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:57,462
What did you two just promise?

188
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,966
About new updates?

189
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,217
What? Updates?

190
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:04,719
It's nothing.

191
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:05,762
Updates?

192
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:08,389
What update?
Everyone should be kept in the loop.

193
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:10,224
You can't pinky-promise things
between you two.

194
00:14:10,308 --> 00:14:12,268
- You promised, Su-jin!
- Come here.

195
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:19,484
Hey, Min-seo. How did your midterms go?

196
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:21,277
You should've gone home. Why are you here?

197
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:23,071
I have something to tell Mom.

198
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:24,989
Mom isn't here.

199
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:25,907
Hold on.

200
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,662
You, this, end?

201
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:33,498
I understand Korean.

202
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:35,833
You're so fluent in Korean.

203
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:37,043
Is this all?

204
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:40,129
No, I'll also get a pack
of ten-liter garbage bags.

205
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:48,179
That'll be 7,800 won. Points card?

206
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:49,138
Hold on.

207
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:56,521
Lee Sun-cheol. Number 1405.

208
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:57,980
Lee Sun-cheol, 1405...

209
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:00,858
Are you him?

210
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:02,402
No, he's my boss.

211
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:03,736
It's my manager's name.

212
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:07,156
You're sharing points with your manager?

213
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,075
Yes. He told me to.

214
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:13,371
It's against the rules,
but I'll let you off the hook this time.

215
00:15:13,788 --> 00:15:15,540
Oh, okay, thank you.

216
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:18,459
All right.

217
00:15:18,543 --> 00:15:20,128
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

218
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:24,841
Why are you being so petty over points?

219
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:27,718
Hey, 1,000 points are worth 1,000 won.

220
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:29,429
All of that's money.

221
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:30,847
I'm just trying to work hard--

222
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,014
Excuse me.

223
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:34,308
- What is it?
- I should get 2,200 won in change,

224
00:15:34,392 --> 00:15:35,726
but you gave me 3,200 won.

225
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:37,019
You gave me 1,000 won extra.

226
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:37,979
Have a good day.

227
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,399
Wow, how embarrassing.

228
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:43,651
Where's Mom, by the way?

229
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,487
Don't bother Mom for a while, okay?

230
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:48,614
She's dealing with some important stuff.

231
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:49,532
Whatever.

232
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,701
I got over 80 on my exams,
so she owes me shoes.

233
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:54,203
You got over 80? Really?

234
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:56,831
Oh, my.

235
00:15:58,124 --> 00:15:59,041
Where's my phone?

236
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,335
This is unbelievable. That can't be right.

237
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:04,297
Here.

238
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:07,300
Stop throwing this around.

239
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:09,927
That's why the handle keeps falling off.

240
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:13,222
That's too much nagging
for just fixing my knife.

241
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:17,518
Everything about you is annoying,
but your nagging's the worst.

242
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:20,605
Next time, ask Su-il to do it.

243
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:22,482
What a nuisance.

244
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:25,860
Everyone knows
that Su-il is bad with his hands.

245
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:28,738
But how many times
do I have to fix these for you?

246
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:31,240
Hey, Min-seo.

247
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:33,659
Over 80?

248
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:35,745
Really?

249
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:37,580
Yes.

250
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:38,956
No, I'll be right over.

251
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,917
Okay, I got it.

252
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:42,668
Hey, I'm off.

253
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,549
She's making it sound like
80 is the perfect score.

254
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:58,684
What's wrong, Ms. Jung?

255
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:03,356
Min-seo got 80 in Math!

256
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:08,653
Okay, but that's no reason
to run with a knife like that.

257
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:10,238
Oh, this?

258
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:13,366
I was just getting the handle fixed.

259
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:15,243
Are you heading home from work?

260
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:19,288
No, I was actually on my way to see you.

261
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:21,374
I heard you were at the hardware store.

262
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:22,542
Oh, me?

263
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,168
Do you need something?

264
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:27,547
Are you close with the assemblywoman,
Na Eun-jae?

265
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:30,800
We went to high school together.

266
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:32,510
Do you know her phone number?

267
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,387
I do,

268
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:37,640
but she didn't pick up when I called
to ask about Producer Kim before.

269
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,809
The way she ignores her locals,

270
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,936
she doesn't deserve to be
in the National Assembly.

271
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:45,147
Why do you need her number?

272
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,149
I need to ask her something.

273
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:58,077
Hey, what do you need?

274
00:17:58,327 --> 00:17:59,245
I need a piggy bank.

275
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:01,122
- Piggy bank? For Do-yeon?
- Yeah.

276
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:02,498
- Shaped like a bunny?
- Yeah.

277
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:03,499
Over there.

278
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:09,088
Hey, the guys are gathering tonight.
You should join us.

279
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:12,008
It's the heroes' night tonight.

280
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,260
I'll extend a special invitation to you.

281
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:16,178
I can't tonight.

282
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:17,263
Why not?

283
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:18,556
Where are you going alone this time?

284
00:18:20,391 --> 00:18:21,642
Come on, now.

285
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:25,479
You seemed stressed
when you left the bunker last night.

286
00:18:25,563 --> 00:18:26,606
Where did you go?

287
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:28,983
To meet Kim Seok-jun.

288
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:31,777
Are you kidding me?

289
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:34,822
You think you're all that, do you?

290
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:38,576
Give me a heads up next time.

291
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:41,078
And if I do?

292
00:18:41,996 --> 00:18:42,997
I'd go with you.

293
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:45,875
And what would you do?

294
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:47,752
Swoop in like a real hero.

295
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:52,632
What?

296
00:18:53,007 --> 00:18:56,927
Do you think you're the main dish
while the rest of us are sides?

297
00:18:57,011 --> 00:19:01,390
You know, a main dish can only shine
when the sides do the work.

298
00:19:02,183 --> 00:19:03,434
You know nothing, do you?

299
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:04,435
Here.

300
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:06,479
Bye.

301
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:12,109
What's with him?

302
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:15,821
OFFICE OF THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY MEMBER
NA EUN-JAE

303
00:19:21,452 --> 00:19:23,454
<i>I'm Choi Kang, a Changri-dong resident.</i>

304
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:24,997
<i>Can we meet?</i>

305
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:27,375
<i>It seems like you're next.</i>

306
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:31,087
You abducted a journalist?

307
00:19:31,462 --> 00:19:34,507
Don't put it like that. That's scary.

308
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,801
I just took him in for a few questions.

309
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:39,470
He was getting too deep
in the bomb investigations.

310
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:42,556
You abducted a journalist
in this day and age?

311
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,849
Are you insane?

312
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:45,518
Stop saying it like that.

313
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:52,024
The real issue is that his neighbor
somehow took him back.

314
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:53,651
Who did?

315
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:00,866
This guy.

316
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:04,370
He seems like a nobody on paper,

317
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:05,746
but something smells fishy.

318
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:07,623
There's something to him.

319
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:22,471
WHERE SHOULD WE MEET?

320
00:20:33,107 --> 00:20:34,233
Mr. Choi Kang?

321
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:35,735
Yes, that's me.

322
00:20:38,112 --> 00:20:38,988
Did you come alone?

323
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:40,906
Yes, and you?

324
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:42,450
Me too.

325
00:20:46,454 --> 00:20:48,247
What do you mean, I'm next?

326
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:52,126
Kim Seok-jun has been arrested,
and Kwon U-seong is dead.

327
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:54,920
It's your turn now.

328
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:59,133
How can I believe
that you're not on the same side

329
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:01,093
as Sullivan?

330
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:03,554
I don't think you have time for this.

331
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:06,766
Good point.

332
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:09,894
I'm getting blackmailed.

333
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:12,855
How so?

334
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:15,733
He says he'll blow everything up.

335
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,861
Seems like Sullivan
will do something to this neighborhood.

336
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:23,491
Can you get in touch with him?

337
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:33,125
<i>- This number does not exist.</i>
<i>- </i>Oh, my.

338
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:35,586
<i>- Please check it again and re-dial.</i>
<i>-</i> But I'm sure

339
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:37,463
he called me with this number.

340
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:46,138
Ms. Na, you came here alone, right?

341
00:21:46,222 --> 00:21:47,348
Yes, I told you.

342
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:49,892
Let's walk.

343
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:30,933
Oh, my goodness!

344
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:48,367
Is this the police? Please hurry.

345
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:50,369
We're getting attacked!

346
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:52,162
He has a knife.

347
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:28,801
<i>This is Lee Geun-cheol.</i>

348
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:33,305
Please look into Sullivan
and anyone around him.

349
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:46,610
<i>Did you hear?</i>

350
00:24:46,694 --> 00:24:49,488
<i>The son of the National Assembly Speaker</i>
<i>died in a car accident last night.</i>

351
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:51,782
<i>You reap what you sow.</i>

352
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:54,451
<i>I won't let you off with a warning</i>

353
00:24:55,411 --> 00:24:57,287
if you meddle with my plans again.

354
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,248
Think of your daughter.

355
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,000
He says he'll blow everything up.

356
00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:03,585
Seems like Sullivan
will do something to this neighborhood.

357
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:22,312
KIYUN DREAM KINDERGARTEN

358
00:25:23,397 --> 00:25:25,024
- Do-yeon.
- Yeah?

359
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:27,901
Tell me if you see anything odd
in the neighborhood, okay?

360
00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:29,278
Okay, Dad.

361
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:32,322
But...

362
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:34,116
what do you mean by odd?

363
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:38,245
It's when a stranger
offers to buy you something.

364
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:40,914
Or if you see a strange object
in front of our house.

365
00:25:40,998 --> 00:25:43,584
Or if anything suddenly disappears
or something appears out of nowhere.

366
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:44,501
Okay?

367
00:25:44,752 --> 00:25:45,586
Okay!

368
00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:47,046
Don't worry.

369
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:50,090
Have a good day.

370
00:25:50,174 --> 00:25:51,467
Okay, Daddy.

371
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,344
See you later!

372
00:25:54,428 --> 00:25:55,763
- Okay.
- Bye.

373
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:12,446
The clay sculpture we made before is dry.

374
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:18,911
Let's color it now.

375
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:21,038
Can I have blue?

376
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:23,082
- Which color?
- Blue, please.

377
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:39,765
You must be tired
with all these deliveries.

378
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:42,601
It's great to see our shop doing so well.

379
00:26:43,477 --> 00:26:44,770
CHRONOS QUANTUM LABORATORY

380
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:48,524
I'll make a lot of money,
and let you live like a queen.

381
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:53,695
My gosh, what's with you?

382
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:54,738
Just go.

383
00:26:54,822 --> 00:26:56,073
- See you!
- Okay.

384
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,033
Drive safely.

385
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:04,456
You two are still so in love.

386
00:27:04,665 --> 00:27:05,833
That's cute.

387
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:09,461
I didn't ask for your opinion.
Mind your own business.

388
00:27:09,545 --> 00:27:11,880
People might think
we're friends or something.

389
00:27:13,257 --> 00:27:15,008
You heard from Mr. Choi, right?

390
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:18,095
I almost died last night.

391
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,474
What?

392
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:24,935
Didn't Mr. Choi tell you?

393
00:27:25,686 --> 00:27:29,982
Aren't you guys
the Power Rangers of Changri-dong?

394
00:27:31,567 --> 00:27:35,445
Stop beating around the bush
and get to the point.

395
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:39,408
Who attacked them?

396
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:41,660
They don't know who attacked them.

397
00:27:42,578 --> 00:27:44,746
He just ran off
when he heard the police coming.

398
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:49,626
Mr. Choi asked me
for Eun-jae's number yesterday.

399
00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:51,670
You didn't know about this?

400
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:53,672
No, he didn't tell me anything.

401
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:56,216
I thought you two were best friends.

402
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,384
You know nothing.

403
00:27:57,467 --> 00:27:59,011
That doesn't mean I know everything.

404
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:02,389
So what did he talk about with her?

405
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:04,683
I came to ask you about that.

406
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:07,686
She said it was nothing important,
but how can I believe her?

407
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:15,402
What the heck is he doing on his own?

408
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:25,662
- Hello.
- What?

409
00:28:25,746 --> 00:28:27,956
Oh, you work here?

410
00:28:32,586 --> 00:28:33,921
"Ali."

411
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:35,297
You're a researcher?

412
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:36,798
Yes.

413
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:39,343
Don't you have to study a lot
to become one?

414
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:40,260
Of course.

415
00:28:40,344 --> 00:28:42,512
I graduated from a university in Pakistan

416
00:28:42,596 --> 00:28:44,556
and even studied in England.

417
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,641
I studied quite a bit.

418
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:48,060
That's so impressive.

419
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:50,270
Pakistan...

420
00:28:50,354 --> 00:28:52,773
Wasn't the guy
who recently died in the ATM explosion

421
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:54,983
also from Pakistan?

422
00:28:55,484 --> 00:28:59,196
He was my friend, Rashid.

423
00:29:00,656 --> 00:29:03,617
Oh, no. He was so far away from home.

424
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:06,703
Why did you order so much?

425
00:29:06,787 --> 00:29:09,873
Oh, because I've been pulling
a lot of all-nighters lately.

426
00:29:09,957 --> 00:29:10,958
Thank you.

427
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:13,961
- Have a good day.
- Thanks.

428
00:29:14,336 --> 00:29:15,796
- I got it.
- Good.

429
00:29:16,797 --> 00:29:18,048
Stay strong, all right?

430
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:20,425
- Let me know if you need any help.
- Thanks.

431
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:22,678
- Thank you.
- Hold them properly.

432
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:24,304
- Have a good day!
- You too.

433
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:34,147
Yeah.

434
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:39,319
The Investigation Unit
confirmed there was nothing odd.

435
00:29:39,403 --> 00:29:41,029
Yes. Right.

436
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:43,949
We just have to pay that amount
and close the case.

437
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:45,284
The final amount.

438
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:49,496
SAFE GAS STATION

439
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:52,582
- Hello?
-<i> Are you busy?</i>

440
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:53,709
No.

441
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:57,004
I'll be right over.

442
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:01,717
I'm heading out for a meeting.

443
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:07,639
KWAK BYEONG-NAM

444
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:10,058
I'm busy. Let's talk later.

445
00:30:17,107 --> 00:30:18,650
What are you,
the busiest person in the world?

446
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:30,078
Yes.

447
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:31,872
The Vice Minister is in a meeting,

448
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:33,623
so he asked me to give you these.

449
00:30:42,716 --> 00:30:45,677
"Adopted to the United States
through an adoption facility in Kiyun-si"?

450
00:30:46,136 --> 00:30:48,138
We're also looking into
the Joinus Company guards,

451
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:50,140
Rashid, the ATM explosion victim,

452
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:52,309
as well as other people working for him.

453
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:13,622
Who's this guy?

454
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,585
Noah, born in Korea.

455
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:20,670
He was adopted by Americans
when he was two.

456
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:23,090
He served in DEVGRU,
the US Navy’s special operations unit.

457
00:31:23,173 --> 00:31:26,218
After that, he worked
for a Russian private military company

458
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:29,346
and joined Sullivan's guard team
three years ago.

459
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:32,182
Please look into the other members.

460
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:33,392
Okay.

461
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:48,448
That's Kang's car.

462
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,367
Should I go and say hi?

463
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:53,078
I'm totally not here to see Ms. Lee.

464
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:01,336
- Kang.
- Hey.

465
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:04,673
Oh, isn't that James Sullivan?

466
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:10,262
Please take care of what I asked.

467
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:11,304
Okay.

468
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,931
- Yong-hui.
- Yeah?

469
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:14,808
- I'm heading out.
- Okay.

470
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:16,810
- See you around.
- Okay, see you.

471
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:18,103
Bye.

472
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:20,480
Gosh, I'm exhausted.

473
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:27,988
Did you need something?

474
00:32:28,697 --> 00:32:30,824
Oh, not really.

475
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:34,494
I just saw Kang's car outside
and thought I'd check in.

476
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:36,663
I'm not here to see you.

477
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:40,917
Not that I didn't want to see you.

478
00:32:41,585 --> 00:32:42,794
I mean...

479
00:32:42,878 --> 00:32:45,839
So what were those photos about?

480
00:32:46,548 --> 00:32:47,507
Oh, right.

481
00:32:48,175 --> 00:32:50,010
Please tell Jeong-hwan this.

482
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:52,596
We think Sullivan
is behind all the bomb explosions.

483
00:32:53,138 --> 00:32:54,598
James Sullivan?

484
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:56,641
Sullivan set off the bombs?

485
00:32:56,725 --> 00:32:58,185
Yeah, I think so.

486
00:32:58,268 --> 00:33:00,145
Ms. Lee told me to tell you.

487
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:03,940
We should report him immediately, then.

488
00:33:04,024 --> 00:33:05,150
So many people died from this.

489
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:06,234
No, wait.

490
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:08,695
We're not completely sure yet.

491
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:11,490
Is this why Mr. Choi went to see Eun-jae?

492
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:14,534
Hey, what did Kang say?

493
00:33:14,618 --> 00:33:18,246
He grabbed some photos and files
and just left.

494
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:19,956
Photos? What photos?

495
00:33:20,624 --> 00:33:24,211
There was Sullivan's and some others.

496
00:33:24,753 --> 00:33:27,297
Seriously, what is he up to by himself?

497
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:28,798
There's...

498
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:32,302
nothing I can do,
even if I know who killed Myeong-o.

499
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:36,056
Sorry, it's almost time
for my tutoring session.

500
00:33:38,475 --> 00:33:39,559
I'll go with you.

501
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:41,478
Look into what's going on, okay?

502
00:33:41,895 --> 00:33:43,688
How am I supposed to do that?

503
00:33:43,772 --> 00:33:47,943
You're close with Kang,
so ask him and tell us.

504
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:50,195
Why don't you ask him yourself?

505
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,824
Are you heading out?

506
00:33:54,908 --> 00:33:56,201
What does it look like I'm doing?

507
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:10,924
I heard you met Myeong-o's mom
a couple days ago.

508
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:14,052
Did she tell you?

509
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:16,388
She boasted about
how you bought her Korean beef.

510
00:34:18,265 --> 00:34:20,934
She's barely been eating.

511
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:24,354
She's so ridiculous.

512
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:27,148
She said no when I called her out
for some pork belly.

513
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:29,109
She's discriminating against me.

514
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:30,860
Oh, actually...

515
00:34:30,944 --> 00:34:32,320
She's discriminating against pork belly.

516
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:34,656
You offered her Korean beef.

517
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:37,826
You think so?

518
00:34:46,835 --> 00:34:48,044
Who's this from?

519
00:34:48,128 --> 00:34:49,045
I'm not sure.

520
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:51,923
Please sign here.

521
00:34:52,007 --> 00:34:52,882
Okay.

522
00:34:56,386 --> 00:34:58,179
- Thank you.
- Yes, good night.

523
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:30,629
Since you're not making any moves,
I've decided on a time.

524
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:34,799
Time for what?

525
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:39,346
Hold a live press conference
within the next 12 hours.

526
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:44,643
<i>Confess everything you've done</i>
<i>at the press conference.</i>

527
00:35:44,726 --> 00:35:45,810
Are you kidding me?

528
00:35:46,645 --> 00:35:47,479
Who do you think--

529
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:49,439
<i>You must not be too late,</i>

530
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:51,483
and you may not report this to the police.

531
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:55,320
And what if I do?

532
00:36:23,515 --> 00:36:26,101
You should've gone to the police,
not come to me.

533
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:27,811
He said the bomb will go off if I do.

534
00:36:28,687 --> 00:36:30,146
Did he tell you where the bomb was?

535
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:32,107
No, nothing about that.

536
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:54,337
<i>You're making things complicated,</i>
<i>Mr. Choi.</i>

537
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:57,757
Is he watching us?

538
00:36:59,134 --> 00:37:00,301
Where's the bomb?

539
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:02,387
I warned you

540
00:37:02,971 --> 00:37:04,305
not to meddle with my plan.

541
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:06,641
Where's the bomb, you crazy bastard?

542
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:10,603
Thanks to you,

543
00:37:11,438 --> 00:37:12,981
I'm shortening the timeline.

544
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:14,482
What?

545
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:18,778
<i>There will be another bomb.</i>

546
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:21,030
Good luck finding it.

547
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:33,626
<i>This number does not exist.</i>

548
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:36,755
What do we do now?

549
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:38,423
Did he say anything else?

550
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,383
Nothing much.

551
00:37:40,467 --> 00:37:42,844
He just told me to hold a press conference
within the next 12 hours.

552
00:37:43,428 --> 00:37:44,637
What press conference?

553
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:49,684
About the Minister helping U-seong
get away with no sentence or whatever.

554
00:37:50,894 --> 00:37:54,522
He wants me to expose
everything they've done.

555
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:58,735
Why is he telling you to do that?

556
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:00,987
How should I know?

557
00:38:25,929 --> 00:38:28,473
<i>It's urgent. Let's meet right now.</i>

558
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:29,682
<i>Come to the gym.</i>

559
00:38:29,766 --> 00:38:30,934
<i>I'm on my way now.</i>

560
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:32,977
<i>Okay, Su-il's coming with me.</i>

561
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:34,771
That's new.

562
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:37,398
He's suddenly looking for his side dishes.

563
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:47,116
Hey! Another bomb?

564
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,536
Where is it this time?

565
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:51,371
I need to get on it.

566
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:52,580
Where is it? I'll--

567
00:38:52,664 --> 00:38:54,541
Calm down.

568
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:57,794
There seem to be two bombs.

569
00:38:58,711 --> 00:38:59,963
I don't know where they are.

570
00:39:00,255 --> 00:39:02,173
You acted all high and mighty,
but you know nothing.

571
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:06,010
Shouldn't we go out
and look for the bombs, then?

572
00:39:06,094 --> 00:39:08,304
But we don't know where to search.

573
00:39:08,388 --> 00:39:10,598
We can't find them in ten hours
in an area this big.

574
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:13,101
Then are you telling everyone
to just die, then?

575
00:39:14,227 --> 00:39:15,436
What's with you?

576
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:19,399
Never mind.

577
00:39:20,108 --> 00:39:21,150
Keep talking.

578
00:39:23,528 --> 00:39:25,029
First,

579
00:39:25,113 --> 00:39:26,739
why don't we evacuate the residents?

580
00:39:26,823 --> 00:39:28,616
How do we evacuate all these people?

581
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,869
And if we do, the bomber may notice.

582
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:35,206
Why don't we make them stay inside
instead of evacuating them?

583
00:39:35,832 --> 00:39:37,041
And seek shelter at home?

584
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:39,544
Yes, since we don't know
where the bombs are,

585
00:39:39,669 --> 00:39:41,087
we'll keep the people inside.

586
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:43,882
And we'll look for the bombs
while they stay in.

587
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:46,467
That sounds like a good plan.

588
00:39:46,551 --> 00:39:49,721
If we make people panic,
it might cause bigger trouble.

589
00:39:50,138 --> 00:39:51,973
Let's do it!

590
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:53,975
That's a great plan! Let's do it.

591
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:56,185
Let's go!

592
00:39:57,145 --> 00:39:58,062
Let's go...

593
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:00,773
Let's start early tomorrow morning.

594
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:03,860
Yong-hui and Jeong-hwan,
take care of the kindergarten and schools.

595
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:04,861
Okay.

596
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:07,530
You can tell all our customers
to stay home.

597
00:40:07,614 --> 00:40:08,698
Yeah!

598
00:40:10,992 --> 00:40:13,244
Byeong-nam will take the residential areas
with Chun-bae.

599
00:40:13,328 --> 00:40:14,996
- I'll go with Mr. Choi--
- Actually...

600
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:17,165
I'll be on my own.

601
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:18,750
I have somewhere to go.

602
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:22,045
Sure.

603
00:40:22,879 --> 00:40:25,214
Then please do your best tomorrow morning.

604
00:40:25,298 --> 00:40:26,132
Good night.

605
00:40:26,215 --> 00:40:27,884
- Good night.
- Bye, Kang!

606
00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:29,719
Well, then...

607
00:40:35,016 --> 00:40:36,225
Hey, Kang.

608
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:38,519
Kang!

609
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:48,404
Why do you keep going off on your own?

610
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:49,822
What do you mean?

611
00:40:49,906 --> 00:40:51,199
Even now.

612
00:40:52,033 --> 00:40:55,578
You knew it was Sullivan
who's been setting off the bombs.

613
00:40:57,956 --> 00:40:59,290
I heard from the Minister.

614
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:01,000
Why didn't you tell us?

615
00:41:01,501 --> 00:41:03,086
You even met Na Eun-jae yesterday.

616
00:41:03,378 --> 00:41:05,129
Is she involved in this?

617
00:41:09,384 --> 00:41:10,218
I think so.

618
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:11,970
Come on, I mean...

619
00:41:12,053 --> 00:41:13,680
This is about our neighborhood.

620
00:41:13,763 --> 00:41:15,598
Why won't you tell us anything?

621
00:41:18,226 --> 00:41:20,061
Sullivan's guys are pros.

622
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:22,271
We're no match for them.

623
00:41:22,355 --> 00:41:24,023
- We might die.
- So?

624
00:41:24,107 --> 00:41:26,943
You'll leave your annoying neighbors
and solve this on your own?

625
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:28,736
I'm a part of this neighborhood too!

626
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:31,781
I just...

627
00:41:32,657 --> 00:41:34,033
don't want to put you guys in danger--

628
00:41:34,117 --> 00:41:36,035
And what, are you immortal?

629
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:37,870
Do you think you can
save everyone on your own?

630
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:39,789
You're delusional.

631
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:48,673
Forget it.
There's no point in talking to you.

632
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:49,716
Hey...

633
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:55,221
Damn it.

634
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:43,978
OUTER LAYER -
BLAST PRESSURE DIFFUSION + HEAT RESISTANCE

635
00:42:44,062 --> 00:42:46,355
CARBON NANOTUBE FIBER

636
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:56,824
Are you already heading out?

637
00:42:57,158 --> 00:42:57,992
Yeah.

638
00:43:00,912 --> 00:43:02,538
Daddy, I want water.

639
00:43:02,622 --> 00:43:03,539
Water?

640
00:43:07,794 --> 00:43:08,961
All right.

641
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:13,382
Here you go.

642
00:43:16,636 --> 00:43:17,553
Do-yeon,

643
00:43:18,096 --> 00:43:19,555
you're not going to kindergarten today.

644
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:21,390
You can't go.

645
00:43:21,474 --> 00:43:23,976
Why not? I have to go.

646
00:43:24,393 --> 00:43:25,645
What are you talking about?

647
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:29,982
Do-yeon,

648
00:43:30,066 --> 00:43:32,110
let's just rest at home today, okay?

649
00:43:32,193 --> 00:43:36,155
No, I'm supposed to decorate Pinky today!

650
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:38,241
I want to go!

651
00:43:39,784 --> 00:43:43,162
Why are you making her cry
first thing in the morning?

652
00:43:46,374 --> 00:43:47,667
You should stay in too.

653
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:49,460
Why? What is it this time?

654
00:43:49,919 --> 00:43:52,463
- I'll tell you once I get back.
- Dad, I hate you.

655
00:43:52,547 --> 00:43:53,840
Make sure to stay in, okay?

656
00:43:58,678 --> 00:44:00,513
It's okay. Don't cry.

657
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:04,684
- Hey.
- Where's Min-seo?

658
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:06,477
I told her to stay home today,

659
00:44:06,561 --> 00:44:07,979
and she was like, "Sweet!"

660
00:44:08,521 --> 00:44:09,605
My goodness.

661
00:44:09,689 --> 00:44:12,108
How is she going to go to college
with that attitude?

662
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:14,777
Have you contacted
the Women's Association?

663
00:44:14,861 --> 00:44:17,655
Yeah, but three people didn't pick up.
I'd better go to them.

664
00:44:18,573 --> 00:44:22,076
Make sure to tell all customers
to go home and stay inside.

665
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,619
Okay, got it!

666
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:25,538
- Tell them to go home!
- Yes, ma'am!

667
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:29,500
HARDWARE STORE

668
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:42,138
These are the spots
with the most foot traffic.

669
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:44,849
It'll be different
from other terrorist attacks.

670
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:50,521
He's going to choose spots
that would best deliver his message.

671
00:44:51,606 --> 00:44:54,192
I've narrowed
the possible spots down to these.

672
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:57,320
Please send this data to me.

673
00:44:57,528 --> 00:44:58,529
Okay.

674
00:44:58,905 --> 00:45:01,741
But are you sure you'll be fine alone?

675
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:05,620
I'm not alone.

676
00:45:11,751 --> 00:45:13,878
Dong-gwan, take it and eat it at home.

677
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:15,463
- What?
- Go home!

678
00:45:19,217 --> 00:45:20,593
Hello!

679
00:45:20,843 --> 00:45:23,054
Everyone, I got these for you.

680
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:26,724
Please enjoy,
but don't come out until lunchtime, okay?

681
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:29,268
You promised! Until lunch!

682
00:45:46,202 --> 00:45:48,329
Kids, what are you doing here?

683
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:49,705
Go back to school.

684
00:45:51,082 --> 00:45:52,750
Who the hell do you think you are?

685
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:54,502
Just listen to me.

686
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:55,920
Whatever.

687
00:45:56,212 --> 00:45:57,838
Piss off, all right?

688
00:45:58,464 --> 00:46:00,299
Hey, watch it.

689
00:46:00,383 --> 00:46:01,509
What the hell?

690
00:46:05,972 --> 00:46:07,765
Gosh, kids these days.

691
00:46:11,269 --> 00:46:12,436
Hey, mini car!

692
00:46:13,104 --> 00:46:14,188
Oh, Mr. Kwak!

693
00:46:14,563 --> 00:46:16,774
Are you smoking cigarettes right now?

694
00:46:16,983 --> 00:46:18,025
Hey, put them away.

695
00:46:19,402 --> 00:46:21,570
What are you doing here?
You should be at school.

696
00:46:25,324 --> 00:46:27,410
Did you mess with this guy?

697
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:29,078
- Oh, no.
- No?

698
00:46:29,537 --> 00:46:32,581
Perfect. Listen to me carefully.

699
00:46:33,124 --> 00:46:35,042
Go back to your classrooms right now.

700
00:46:35,126 --> 00:46:38,254
And don't come out until lunch, okay?

701
00:46:38,504 --> 00:46:39,839
- Why?
- "Why?"

702
00:46:39,922 --> 00:46:41,048
Yes.

703
00:46:41,257 --> 00:46:42,758
You want me to call your mom?

704
00:46:42,842 --> 00:46:44,176
Fine!

705
00:46:44,343 --> 00:46:46,304
- Let's go.
- Good.

706
00:46:46,387 --> 00:46:47,305
Go.

707
00:46:47,388 --> 00:46:49,348
- Tell the kids in the other classes too.
- Go on.

708
00:46:49,974 --> 00:46:53,561
- Study hard, all right?
- And stop smoking.

709
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:56,647
- I can't believe those kids.
- If I were any younger, I would've...

710
00:46:57,398 --> 00:46:58,607
- Hey.
- What?

711
00:46:58,691 --> 00:46:59,984
They didn't beat you up, did they?

712
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:01,652
Of course not!

713
00:47:03,696 --> 00:47:04,822
Wait for me.

714
00:47:07,116 --> 00:47:08,367
We've covered the kindergarten,

715
00:47:08,451 --> 00:47:10,870
schools, health centers,
and the community service center.

716
00:47:10,953 --> 00:47:12,955
I went to the senior citizen center
and the library.

717
00:47:13,122 --> 00:47:15,624
Do you really think there are bombs?

718
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:17,960
It's a huge problem if there are,

719
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:20,880
but if they're not,
I still want to kill this Sullivan.

720
00:47:21,172 --> 00:47:22,506
We only have three more hours.

721
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:25,217
I'd better check on the families
who haven't gotten back to me.

722
00:47:25,301 --> 00:47:26,969
- I'll get going first.
- Okay.

723
00:47:29,805 --> 00:47:32,641
Eun-jae will have a live interview
in three hours.

724
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:33,976
Where?

725
00:47:34,352 --> 00:47:36,020
At the community service center
auditorium.

726
00:47:36,896 --> 00:47:38,773
This is just my opinion, but...

727
00:47:39,315 --> 00:47:41,609
Wouldn't one of the bombs
be at the interview?

728
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:43,652
COMMUNITY SERVICE CENTER

729
00:47:43,736 --> 00:47:46,572
Because it's a live broadcast
with lots of people.

730
00:47:46,655 --> 00:47:48,366
- Exactly.
- That makes total sense.

731
00:47:48,449 --> 00:47:51,535
Why don't we search for the bombs,
then gather back at the center?

732
00:47:51,786 --> 00:47:54,205
- Let's do that.
- Sounds good.

733
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:03,589
Mr. Oh.

734
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,257
Hey, where are you going?

735
00:48:05,966 --> 00:48:09,053
I'll check the bus stop
and head to the press conference.

736
00:48:10,388 --> 00:48:12,848
Oh, no, we have less than an hour.

737
00:48:13,182 --> 00:48:14,308
No bombs found yet, huh?

738
00:48:15,101 --> 00:48:16,727
No, I'm still looking.

739
00:48:17,770 --> 00:48:20,272
Sullivan, this bastard.

740
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:22,817
This is basically his hometown.

741
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:25,444
Why is he causing all this trouble?

742
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:27,196
Right.

743
00:48:36,163 --> 00:48:39,208
"Adopted to the United States
through an adoption facility in Kiyun-si"?

744
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:46,382
Is there an adoption facility in Kiyun-si
that's quite old?

745
00:48:46,715 --> 00:48:47,842
An adoption facility?

746
00:48:49,552 --> 00:48:51,345
The only place
that handled stuff like that

747
00:48:52,471 --> 00:48:54,181
was the Changri Church.

748
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:01,814
PRESS CONFERENCE SCRIPT

749
00:49:02,898 --> 00:49:04,900
You called the press, right?

750
00:49:04,984 --> 00:49:08,696
Yes, I told them to come
to the Community Service Center

751
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:09,697
by 11:50 p.m.

752
00:49:10,531 --> 00:49:11,574
Okay.

753
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:15,536
You also contacted
the hospital and the fire station?

754
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:17,288
Yes, they're on standby.

755
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:18,622
They know not to say anything.

756
00:49:19,582 --> 00:49:20,458
Don't worry, ma'am.

757
00:49:24,044 --> 00:49:26,422
How could I not worry?

758
00:49:29,133 --> 00:49:34,263
All of this is because of that moron,
Kim Seok-jun.

759
00:49:37,016 --> 00:49:38,100
Sorry.

760
00:49:48,777 --> 00:49:49,987
- Hurry.
- Okay.

761
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:03,417
It's not in any of the spots
that I could think of.

762
00:50:03,959 --> 00:50:05,586
Let's head to the press conference.

763
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:07,213
We have 35 minutes now.

764
00:50:07,296 --> 00:50:09,006
Where did Kang go?

765
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:11,550
Kang went to Changri Church.

766
00:50:12,134 --> 00:50:13,219
Changri Church?

767
00:50:18,974 --> 00:50:23,229
CHANGRI-DONG COMMUNITY SERVICE CENTER

768
00:50:23,604 --> 00:50:25,105
You heard anything?

769
00:50:25,189 --> 00:50:27,441
- What is she trying to talk about?
- Let's head in.

770
00:50:27,525 --> 00:50:28,651
- Come on.
- Let's go.

771
00:50:28,734 --> 00:50:30,277
Hello, again.

772
00:50:30,361 --> 00:50:33,322
AUDITORIUM HALL

773
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:49,838
Stay on your best game, Eun-jae.

774
00:50:51,507 --> 00:50:54,552
With the way things are,

775
00:50:54,635 --> 00:50:56,303
there's nothing to lose
even if the bombs go off.

776
00:50:57,930 --> 00:50:59,557
Let's become the politician

777
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:02,059
who's fighting against
a terrorist for her nation.

778
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:20,262
JUSTICE IS NOT SILENT

779
00:52:22,181 --> 00:52:24,642
Dear distinguished locals,

780
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:27,978
and all press joining me here today,

781
00:52:28,646 --> 00:52:30,898
I'm Na Eun-jae,
the representative of Kiyun-si.

782
00:52:36,904 --> 00:52:37,905
I'm standing here today

783
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:41,950
after being blackmailed by a terrorist
who has been bombing Kiyun-si.

784
00:52:42,743 --> 00:52:44,495
- What?
- Is this true?

785
00:52:44,578 --> 00:52:46,497
- What is she saying?
- No way!

786
00:52:46,914 --> 00:52:48,248
A terrorist bombing?

787
00:52:48,374 --> 00:52:50,084
- Really?
- How can this be?

788
00:52:50,668 --> 00:52:54,838
I was told that if I didn't do
as he had commanded me,

789
00:52:58,175 --> 00:53:01,887
he would make a bomb go off soon.

790
00:53:28,789 --> 00:53:33,419
But I will never negotiate with him

791
00:53:34,962 --> 00:53:37,005
or give in to his threats.

792
00:53:37,548 --> 00:53:38,882
Yong-hui.

793
00:53:38,966 --> 00:53:41,510
So Sullivan's goal
is to get rid of Ms. Na, right?

794
00:53:41,593 --> 00:53:44,138
- Yeah.
- Then where would he have put the bomb?

795
00:53:44,513 --> 00:53:46,598
Jeong-hwan, I don't like bombs.

796
00:53:46,682 --> 00:53:49,184
I mean, let's say you're Sullivan.

797
00:53:49,268 --> 00:53:51,645
If you were the terrorist,

798
00:53:51,729 --> 00:53:53,480
instead of hiding a bomb somewhere,

799
00:53:54,022 --> 00:53:55,941
wouldn't you just blow up that phone?

800
00:53:56,024 --> 00:53:57,192
No way.

801
00:54:15,586 --> 00:54:18,172
The cellphone is from Sullivan.

802
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:23,093
Ms. Na, the phone is the bomb!

803
00:54:23,177 --> 00:54:24,011
What?

804
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:34,730
Kang.

805
00:54:50,412 --> 00:54:51,580
Throw it!

806
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:53,957
Stay back!

807
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:07,781

Pastor!

811
00:57:02,669 --> 00:57:03,837
Pastor!

812
00:57:08,842 --> 00:57:10,427
Hurry! Over here!

813
00:57:13,347 --> 00:57:14,932
There's a baby here.

814
00:57:15,015 --> 00:57:16,099
Oh, goodness.

815
00:57:21,647 --> 00:57:24,191
Oh, my. What a precious child.

816
00:57:24,399 --> 00:57:25,943
Come here.

817
00:57:26,652 --> 00:57:27,736
Oh, my.

818
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:32,324
Who would abandon such a beautiful child?

819
00:57:37,079 --> 00:57:38,121
All right.

820
00:57:38,956 --> 00:57:40,165
You're okay, child.

821
00:57:42,042 --> 00:57:43,168
Chun-bae.

822
00:57:45,212 --> 00:57:47,756
Do you know why babies
have such beautiful smiles?

823
00:57:48,715 --> 00:57:49,967
No, I don't.

824
00:57:50,509 --> 00:57:51,718
Babies can hear

825
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:54,805
angels whispering to them.

826
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:56,139
That's right.

827
00:58:10,946 --> 00:58:12,364
What did you pray for?

828
00:58:15,784 --> 00:58:20,831
Although he's been abandoned
and forgotten right now,

829
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:24,418
I prayed for him to grow
strong and healthy

830
00:58:25,419 --> 00:58:27,921
and become someone everyone would know.

Since you're still alive, Ms. Na,
Sullivan's not done yet.

834
01:00:18,698 --> 01:00:22,452
If you hand that over,
we'll protect you from Sullivan.
