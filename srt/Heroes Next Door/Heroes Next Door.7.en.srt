HEROES NEXT DOOR

00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:42,960
THIS DRAMA IS A WORK OF FICTION.
ALL CHARACTERS, PROFESSIONS, PLACES,

3
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:44,044
COMPANIES, ORGANIZATIONS,
ETHNIC GROUPS AND EVENTS ARE NOT REAL.

4
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:45,045
ALL CHILD AND ANIMAL SCENES WERE FILMED
SAFELY UNDER EXPERT SUPERVISION.

00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:49,424
SEPTEMBER 18, 2022

6
00:01:00,811 --> 00:01:01,895
Oh, my goodness!

7
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,738
Dad, I'm screwed.

8
00:01:12,281 --> 00:01:14,950
<i>What are you talking about, U-seong?</i>

9
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:17,244
I don't know. I might've hit someone.

10
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:19,121
Just help me!

11
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:28,797
Hello, a child got run over!

12
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,090
Please come quickly!

13
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:38,098
There's been an accident.
Please come here right now!

14
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:40,392
Please help!

15
00:01:57,701 --> 00:01:59,369
Hey, have a seat.

16
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:04,750
It must be something urgent.

17
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:07,002
You never come here.

18
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:11,298
You know Kwon Sang-tae's son,
U-seong, right?

19
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:14,801
Yeah, he must be done
with his military service soon.

20
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:18,555
He got drunk as soon as he got discharged
and hit someone with his car.

21
00:02:19,348 --> 00:02:20,724
And it's Sullivan's daughter.

22
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:22,309
Oh, my.

23
00:02:23,018 --> 00:02:24,019
Is she badly hurt?

24
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:28,023
There hasn't been
an official announcement yet,

25
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:31,109
but the doctor said there was no hope.

26
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:34,529
So he killed someone while drunk-driving?

27
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,700
You know Kwon Sang-tae
is expected to be the next Speaker, right?

28
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:43,121
He says he'll help us
designate Kiyun-si as a specialized zone

29
00:02:43,205 --> 00:02:44,665
if we help him.

30
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:45,957
Is there anything we can do?

31
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,003
There is.

32
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:51,004
There is?

33
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,259
If he was discharged today,
he's still technically a soldier.

34
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:59,554
Just say he was on duty,
then he'll be tried in the military court.

35
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:02,015
Then he could get away with it.

36
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:05,602
Oh, right.

37
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,147
But the appeal trial
would be in a civilian court.

38
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:10,774
I'll take care of it then.

39
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:12,109
Will you?

40
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:14,069
Oh, goodness.

41
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:18,949
But aren't you and Sullivan
business partners?

42
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,617
Come on.

43
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:23,912
My private life
should stay separate from work.

44
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:26,665
Sullivan is work,

45
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:28,500
while the future Speaker is private.

46
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:30,127
You get me?

47
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,128
Gosh!

48
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:38,802
PRESENT, 2025

49
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,303
KANG JUNG-GI

50
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:44,182
Hey.

51
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:45,600
<i>Seok-jun.</i>

52
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:46,727
<i>It was Sullivan.</i>

53
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:49,646
What is?

54
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:53,233
<i>The one who paid double for our bombs.</i>

55
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:55,736
What?

56
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:09,958
HEROES NEXT DOOR PART 2

57
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,260
He's the Minister of National Defense?

58
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:22,554
Yeah.

59
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:26,808
So we caught the Minister red-handed.

60
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:28,894
- Then I was right about him before.
- Yeah.

61
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:32,647
How corrupt does a Minister have to be
to abduct a civilian?

62
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:34,983
This is definitely illegal.

63
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,693
I'm sure he'll be arrested.

64
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:38,737
It's good if that's the case,

65
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,697
but I didn't expect it to go up this high.

66
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:43,074
Can we still tap in on them?

67
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:45,076
No, it got disconnected.

68
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,703
They seem to have found the bug.

69
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:49,706
I'll upload the video.

70
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:53,460
I'll report this
to the Vice Minister first.

71
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:55,212
I'll tell him.

72
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,797
I have to talk to him anyway.

73
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:58,840
I'll do it.

74
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:08,475
How did they know to come here?

75
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,561
It seems that they tracked our location.

76
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,563
I found this on the wall.

77
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,024
What's this?

78
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:20,654
They tapped us?

79
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:26,409
Anything they took?

80
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:28,245
Well...

81
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,579
What now?

82
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,706
They took every button from our uniforms.

83
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:34,251
Buttons?

84
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,419
What? Like this?

85
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:40,048
So should we drag them all in?

86
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:41,007
You idiot.

87
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:43,260
There's been too much exposure.

88
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:47,472
Get rid of all the evidence
and empty this place.

89
00:05:47,556 --> 00:05:50,892
We need to figure out what they've stolen
to decide what to do.

90
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:53,478
Do you ever use your head?

91
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:56,439
What's the point of having one that big?

92
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:57,941
So we just let them be?

93
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,401
Who said we're letting them be?

94
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:02,112
We can't let them be.

95
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:12,289
Good work.

96
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:14,374
We'll start investigating immediately.

97
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:17,294
Did you really not know
the Minister took Producer Kim?

98
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:21,590
Or did you approach me on purpose,
knowing everything?

99
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:27,012
I had a feeling it had to do
with corruption in the defense industry,

100
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:29,514
but I didn't expect civilian abduction.

101
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:31,850
And that corruption

102
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,895
has something to do with
the explosions in our town?

103
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:37,355
That's what we're investigating.

104
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:41,610
If you're just using me...

105
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:44,070
I assure you, no.

106
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:45,697
I'll hand this over to Internal Affairs.

107
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:49,075
I'll let you know if we find anything.

108
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,264
Honey.

109
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:23,318
I'm fine.

110
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:31,326
And Do-yeon?

111
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:35,747
She insisted on waiting for you,
but fell asleep just now.

112
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:38,083
How did it go?

113
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,501
Is everything good now?

114
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:43,964
- I can explain--
- Forget it.

115
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:45,840
Whatever it is,

116
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:48,927
just don't let it
get to Do-yeon or me, okay?

117
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,474
Yes, ma'am.

118
00:07:58,061 --> 00:07:59,437
Oh, right.

119
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:01,773
Guess who we ran into on our way home?

120
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:03,316
Who?

121
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,275
Sullivan.

122
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:05,694
Who?

123
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:06,903
James Sullivan.

124
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:11,700
I guess it really was Sullivan
who gave Do-yeon the ice cream last time.

125
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,286
Did he say anything?

126
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,539
No, he just said hi to Do-yeon and left.

127
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:20,583
He seems to be
looking around the neighborhood.

128
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:25,005
What is it?

129
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,091
It's nothing. Let's head in.

130
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:29,342
Okay.

131
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:40,311
<i>The call cannot be completed.</i>
<i>Please leave a voice message...</i>

132
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:41,646
JAMES SULLIVAN

133
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:45,734
This bastard keeps ignoring my calls.

134
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:54,701
Hey.

135
00:08:55,994 --> 00:08:58,621
Minister Kim, you'll need to come with us.

136
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:12,302
<i>I told you to leave no trace</i>

137
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:15,889
<i>of anyone and anything</i>
<i>related to the bombs.</i>

138
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:18,641
<i>Apologies, sir. I'll take care of it.</i>

139
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:21,186
<i>Take care of what? Huh?</i>

140
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,313
<i>What can you even do?</i>

141
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:28,943
How dare you question me

142
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:32,405
over such a ridiculous, doctored video?

143
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:34,949
Did you guys even confirm
that this wasn't fake?

144
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,202
You have to be sure.

145
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:38,828
It's either you guys or me.

146
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:41,915
One side is going to die from this.

147
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,458
You realize that?

148
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:46,086
This is just a procedural investigation.

149
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:49,005
You must explain this
to return to your job.

150
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:50,465
Explain what?

151
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:54,385
What's there to explain?

152
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:57,889
I did nothing wrong.

153
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:05,855
I'll take it from here.

154
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:25,125
Who are you teaming up with
to screw me over?

155
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:27,293
What do you mean?

156
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:30,922
Where could you have gotten that?

157
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,384
Someone reported it.

158
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:36,761
I can't tell you who.

159
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:45,145
I was wondering how those bastards
had the nerve to do this.

160
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:47,730
So you were behind it.

161
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:50,400
Come here.

162
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,029
Fine.

163
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:01,536
You thick-headed moron.

164
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:04,164
Do you realize what you're doing?

165
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:08,501
I've set this up to find the bastards
who snuck away the bombs,

166
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:11,921
and you're ruining my plan.

167
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:14,174
Think about it.

168
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:16,885
You think the Minister of National Defense

169
00:11:16,968 --> 00:11:20,513
would sneak away some bombs
for pocket money?

170
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:33,860
Hello.

171
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:52,795
Bye!

172
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:55,381
- Bye.
- See you, Do-yeon.

173
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:56,633
- See you later!
- See you.

174
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:35,922
We're first going to sketch
what we want to make with the clay.

175
00:12:43,638 --> 00:12:45,014
Her name is Pinky.

176
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:03,741
HARDWARE DREAM TREE STATIONERY

177
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:04,909
Oh, man.

178
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:08,413
- Byeong-nam!
- Yeah?

179
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:11,249
Are you still in pain?
It's already been days.

180
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:13,084
- I'm fine.
- Here.

181
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:16,546
Here are some pain relief patches,
painkillers, and anti-inflammatory pills.

182
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,339
- Wow, thanks.
- Of course.

183
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:21,592
I saw how you couldn't fight back at all
when they beat you up.

184
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,721
Beat me up?

185
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:27,557
I ducked strategically
when they threw their--

186
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:30,893
- Oh, gosh.
- First,

187
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:33,229
put on the pain relief patch.

188
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:36,274
- Okay.
- And come to my gym.

189
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:37,525
You can't just duck.

190
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:39,610
You have to grab and flip them!

191
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:42,030
Special martial arts! Kick!

192
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:44,574
- These are the basics.
- My gosh.

193
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:47,243
KIM SEOK-JUN

194
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:52,874
It's been days and still no news update.

195
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:58,004
Hey, these are for Changri Church
and the senior citizen center.

196
00:13:58,087 --> 00:13:59,172
The receipts are inside.

197
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:02,175
How's your back doing?

198
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:06,971
What about my back?

199
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:09,515
You've been whimpering in your sleep.

200
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:11,392
What are you even doing these days?

201
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:14,437
Your pretty face is all scratched up, too.

202
00:14:14,896 --> 00:14:17,690
I told you I got hurt from
getting some boxes down.

203
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:20,818
You expect me to believe that?

204
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:25,239
I saw that someone
cleaned up the storage room.

205
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:27,658
Was it you?

206
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:30,870
I just cleaned it yesterday
because we got new supplies.

207
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:31,871
Is it bad?

208
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:34,415
You're so good with your hands.

209
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:36,793
Nobody is as meticulous as you are.

210
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:43,633
If you're saying that, it must be true.

211
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:45,385
I'll get going.

212
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:56,104
Oh, my back.

213
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:11,702
Hey.

214
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:15,581
Hey, that's Mr. Thursday
coming down, right?

215
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:18,084
Yeah, the man of every second Thursday.

216
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:19,710
Right on.

217
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,255
Let's get to work.

218
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,924
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

219
00:15:40,398 --> 00:15:43,025
What? That bus goes to my neighborhood.

220
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:44,986
That place has a lot of alleys.

221
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:47,029
Perfect for faking accidents.

222
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:49,824
Is today the day, then?

223
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:51,784
Probably.

224
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:26,694
Oh, no!

225
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:30,740
Are you okay, sir?

226
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,492
- Don't touch me.
- Okay, no touching.

227
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:33,784
Gosh, I'm dying here.

228
00:16:34,035 --> 00:16:36,412
Give me a second. I'll call 911.

229
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:39,832
- What's their number?
- I can see my dead parents.

230
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:40,833
Father...

231
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:43,211
Hello? Is this--

232
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:44,754
Hello, never mind.

233
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:45,922
Kang.

234
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,882
Su-il, I got this.

235
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:48,799
What?

236
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:51,427
You can get up now.

237
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:53,221
Who are you guys?

238
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:55,681
Don't you remember me? We've met.

239
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:59,101
You were driving
under the speed limit, right?

240
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:01,354
Yeah, probably, because it's an alley.

241
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,023
How do you know how fast he was going?

242
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:06,651
The crash was so loud!

243
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:10,029
And there aren't any cameras around!

244
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:11,656
Oh, my back.

245
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,742
My ribs! Oh, no.

246
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:16,994
Please call an ambulance for me.

247
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:22,708
Look at this, sir!

248
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,754
He was going at 24km per hour
in a 30km zone.

249
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:29,465
See? It says 30km right there!

250
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:31,801
And actually, you were the one speeding.

251
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,886
You bounced off too far.

252
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:37,682
And why do you
only get into accidents on Thursdays?

253
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:39,725
We're busy on Thursdays!

254
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:41,727
What are you talking about?

255
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:45,898
I got hit by a car,
and now I'm about to die!

256
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:50,820
We've been filming you
since before the crash.

257
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:53,281
So is this an insurance fraud?

258
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:54,865
- Yeah.
- Yeah, an insurance fraud.

259
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:57,952
- Hey, no!
- Stop.

260
00:17:58,035 --> 00:18:00,496
- Unbelievable.
- Man...

261
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:01,622
Sir,

262
00:18:01,706 --> 00:18:05,876
if you keep getting into accidents
on purpose for insurance money,

263
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,463
you may be jailed for up to 5 years
or fined up to 20 million won.

264
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:13,217
And under the Special Act
on the Prevention of Insurance Fraud,

265
00:18:13,301 --> 00:18:17,138
you may be jailed for up to 10 years
or fined for up to 50 million won.

266
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,725
You guys are lucky today.

267
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:23,561
Look at him walking.

268
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:26,480
- Where are you going, sir?
- He's running now.

269
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:30,192
Oh, right on time!

270
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:50,838
Jeong-hwan is here.

271
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:53,758
That's a nice engine sound.

272
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:04,393
- You're pretty funny.
- Yes, I am.

273
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:09,940
Hey, Yong-hui.

274
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:12,401
Did you two go somewhere together?

275
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,403
We met on the way.

276
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:16,155
- Did you?
- I'll head in now.

277
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:19,158
Wait for me.

278
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,002
KIM SEOK-JUN

279
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:31,754
How is there no news at all?

280
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:33,297
I knew it.

281
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:37,259
Hello.

282
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,594
- Hey.
- Hi.

283
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,769
Ms. Lee, any updates
from the Vice Minister?

284
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,522
No, not yet.

285
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:50,690
Ms. Lee.

286
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:52,608
Why are you here, Jeong-hwan?

287
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:56,904
I came to check for any updates,
but I guess there are none.

288
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:01,283
Hey, my arm still hurts. Is this normal?

289
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:04,328
You're pretty weak for such a young man.

290
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:05,579
You should work out.

291
00:20:06,497 --> 00:20:09,250
Many of the Minister's men
are former Special Forces agents.

292
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,751
They could kill you with a punch.

293
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:11,877
Right?

294
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:16,549
Ms. Lee, how come you only ever side
with Jeong-hwan?

295
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:18,759
I never did that.

296
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:21,053
She's never done that.

297
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:24,014
Fine. Producer Kim, have you had lunch?

298
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:25,266
I got some good food.

299
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,645
What is it? It looks delicious.

300
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:31,272
That's so much of it, too.

301
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:33,023
Let's eat together.

302
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:35,067
I already had lunch.

303
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:36,610
Please excuse me.

304
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:39,530
I also had a lot to eat. Excuse me.

305
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:44,076
What's going on?

306
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,911
Did they have lunch together?

307
00:20:47,121 --> 00:20:48,831
Give me that. It's not for you.

308
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:52,293
I need to bring it back.

309
00:20:53,544 --> 00:20:56,297
HARDWARE DREAM TREE STATIONERY

310
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,048

311
00:20:58,132 --> 00:20:59,800
INSTRUCTIONS ON REPORTING CORRUPTION

312
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:01,343
REPORTING PERIOD

313
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:03,304
CRITERIA FOR THE REWARD

314
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:07,808
So what are the criteria?

315
00:21:08,726 --> 00:21:13,606
You need to outline what I need to report
to get more money.

316
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:18,652
Hey. Sit here.

317
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:22,573
You reek of pain relief patches.

318
00:21:22,907 --> 00:21:24,992
- Is it that bad?
- That bad?

319
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:26,577
Did you cover your whole body?

320
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,787
How many do you have on?

321
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:30,080
Not that many. Just three.

322
00:21:30,164 --> 00:21:31,457
Ridiculous.

323
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:34,627
I must be getting old. I'm still sore.

324
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:36,462
And you?

325
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:37,797
How are you doing?

326
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,174
Look at this here.

327
00:21:40,758 --> 00:21:42,885
My pain relief patches
don't reek like yours.

328
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,678
- For goodness' sake.
- That hurts.

329
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:45,930
Good for you.

330
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:49,433
I wonder if Mr. Choi is doing okay.

331
00:21:49,517 --> 00:21:51,685
He'll be fine. You saw him.

332
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:52,603
Smack, smack!

333
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:54,188
Oh, gosh.

334
00:21:54,605 --> 00:21:55,564
True.

335
00:21:56,357 --> 00:21:58,108
Take good care of him.

336
00:21:58,192 --> 00:22:00,152
You two seem like best friends.

337
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:03,781
Hey, by the way,

338
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:05,825
we sent the video ages ago.

339
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:09,620
We should've seen something on the news
or gotten some reward money.

340
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:11,997
Something should have happened by now.

341
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:13,207
I know.

342
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:14,875
That's exactly why I'm here.

343
00:22:15,209 --> 00:22:16,794
Did Mr. Choi tell you anything?

344
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:19,421
That'll be 500 won.

345
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:23,425
Or just 300 won--

346
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:25,719
No, no updates.

347
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:29,098
Bye now.

348
00:22:30,224 --> 00:22:32,393
I caught Mr. Thursday red-handed,

349
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:34,061
saved my neighbor,

350
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:36,272
and got rid of your biggest nuisance.

351
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:37,523
All three at once!

352
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:39,233
That's who I am!

353
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:41,902
I'm Veotigo's ace!

354
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:46,448
- Mr. Kim.
- Yes?

355
00:22:46,532 --> 00:22:47,408
Good work.

356
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:49,118
It's nothing.

357
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:52,955
Why are you only praising him?
What about me?

358
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,999
You've praised yourself plenty already.

359
00:22:55,249 --> 00:22:58,878
You didn't even give me
time to praise you.

360
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:02,506
You're so mean.

361
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:06,468
Mr. Kim, I made the verbal report,
so you write the written one.

362
00:23:06,552 --> 00:23:08,345
I'm working on it right now.

363
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,639
I write most of our reports,
so why even ask?

364
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:19,857
KIM SEOK-JUN

365
00:23:22,026 --> 00:23:24,069
MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEFENSE CORRUPTION

366
00:23:24,153 --> 00:23:25,738
ESTABLISHING A CORRUPTION-FREE SYSTEM

367
00:23:30,284 --> 00:23:33,287
SAFE GAS STATION

368
00:23:38,459 --> 00:23:39,543
Yes, Producer Kim.

369
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:41,837
I was just about to call you.

370
00:23:43,339 --> 00:23:44,506
I'm on my way now.

371
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:51,430
Where do you think you're going?

372
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:53,015
I need to meet someone.

373
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:55,142
I'll go straight home after that.

374
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:56,602
Good work today, Mr. Kim.

375
00:23:57,311 --> 00:23:59,229
See you tomorrow, sir.

376
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:09,740
Man, that was smooth.

377
00:24:10,491 --> 00:24:11,742
I also need to head out for...

378
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:13,035
- Sit back down.
- Yes, sir.

379
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:17,581
SAFE GAS STATION

380
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:20,876
Is anyone else in?

381
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:23,337
Just Ms. Lee. She stepped out for a bit.

382
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:27,091
Why did you want to see me?

383
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:28,801
It's about Minister Kim.

384
00:24:29,051 --> 00:24:31,428
I spent the past few days
looking into him,

385
00:24:32,096 --> 00:24:34,098
and there aren't even
any rumors about him.

386
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:35,683
I find that weird too.

387
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:39,770
There's nothing on the Minister
or the corruption on the news.

388
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:43,107
It's one or the other
for someone this powerful.

389
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:45,901
It either blows up or gets forgotten.

390
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:49,655
I've covered similar cases
in broadcasting,

391
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:54,159
but it all got dismissed, so I quit.

392
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:57,997
Producer Kim,

393
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:02,626
let's upload that clip of Minister Kim.

394
00:25:04,712 --> 00:25:06,088
That's what I wanted to hear.

395
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:09,717
The video should cause a stir, right?

396
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,176
There will be something, at least.

397
00:25:27,735 --> 00:25:28,736
Hey.

398
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:31,155
What?

399
00:25:32,156 --> 00:25:35,409
What's Lee Geun-cheol doing there?
I'm the Minister.

400
00:25:37,745 --> 00:25:38,787
Hey!

401
00:25:41,582 --> 00:25:44,251
Investigation or whatever,

402
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:46,378
I'm the Minister until it's over!

403
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:48,047
Hey...

404
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:54,887
Damn it!

405
00:25:57,973 --> 00:26:00,809
How dare these bastards mess with me?

406
00:26:12,196 --> 00:26:14,281
Hey. Where are you right now?

407
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,716
Why do you keep following me?

408
00:27:15,926 --> 00:27:17,678
You were at my house a few days ago too.

409
00:27:19,388 --> 00:27:20,931
I'm calling the cops.

410
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,730
Let go!

411
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:32,568
Hey!

412
00:27:44,538 --> 00:27:45,539
Oh, gosh!

413
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:47,332
Hey!

414
00:27:49,126 --> 00:27:49,960
Are you okay?

415
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:51,295
Yeah, I'm fine.

416
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:53,130
- And you?
- I'm fine.

417
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:54,673
How dare they show up here.

418
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:57,176
What if they go to Do-yeon?

419
00:27:57,259 --> 00:27:59,094
- Where is she?
- At kindergarten.

420
00:27:59,595 --> 00:28:01,722
Then Yong-hui would get there faster.

421
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:05,726
Yeah, I'm waiting for her.

422
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,353
The teacher will bring her out.

423
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:20,490
Yong-hui is bringing Do-yeon here.

424
00:28:20,574 --> 00:28:21,408
Okay.

425
00:28:23,744 --> 00:28:26,371
By the way, are you okay?

426
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:29,082
Oh, this?

427
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:32,920
I just fell while getting some stuff down.

428
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:36,757
Anyway, when did they start following you?

429
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:40,219
I didn't notice when I got off the bus,

430
00:28:40,302 --> 00:28:42,554
but I saw them once I started walking.

431
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,890
They followed me a few days ago too.

432
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:48,352
I hadn't seen them since,
so I thought I was just paranoid.

433
00:28:49,311 --> 00:28:50,938
Have you told your husband?

434
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:53,106
No.

435
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,733
We'd better tell him.

436
00:28:55,317 --> 00:28:56,318
Hold on.

437
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:58,237
Hey, Nam-yeon!

438
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,613
Where are you?

439
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:00,989
- Give me a second.
- Hey.

440
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:09,873
When Yong-hui arrives,

441
00:29:09,957 --> 00:29:12,334
tell him to make sure
he gets Mi-gyeong home safe.

442
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:13,502
Where's Kang?

443
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:15,337
He doesn't seem to know about it yet.

444
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:17,339
Stay here for a bit.

445
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:19,216
They're messing with our families now.

446
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:21,051
- I'd better check on Min-seo.
- Yes, go.

447
00:29:31,979 --> 00:29:33,689
Ms. Hwang, you must've been so scared.

448
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:37,442
I'm Kwak Byeong-nam,
the youth association president.

449
00:29:37,985 --> 00:29:41,154
Oh, I've heard a lot about you.

450
00:29:41,238 --> 00:29:42,239
I see.

451
00:29:44,116 --> 00:29:46,034
What happened to your face?

452
00:29:46,827 --> 00:29:48,078
Oh, this?

453
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:52,249
I was feeding some stray cats
when I got attacked by one.

454
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:55,502
It smacked me in my face
as soon as I put the bowl down.

455
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,423
I see.

456
00:30:00,007 --> 00:30:02,301
Have you called Kang?

457
00:30:03,093 --> 00:30:05,304
I have, but he's not picking up.

458
00:30:05,387 --> 00:30:06,221
He must be busy.

459
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:09,141
Don't worry.
You have the whole neighborhood with you.

460
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:10,892
Okay.

461
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:13,937
- Did you watch the music show?
- I did.

462
00:30:14,021 --> 00:30:15,522
Isn't he so handsome?

463
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:17,482
- But he's not my type.
- What?

464
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:19,818
What do you mean? I love feminine men.

465
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:21,403
- You're weird.
- I love them.

466
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,113
- I'm going that way.
- Okay.

467
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:24,489
- See you.
- Bye-bye.

468
00:30:45,302 --> 00:30:47,429
Mom? What are you doing here?

469
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:51,266
Oh, I was just running an errand nearby.

470
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:53,727
I saw you and wanted to say hi.

471
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:57,856
Min-seo, let's just go home today.

472
00:30:58,607 --> 00:31:00,442
Don't go to your afterschool classes.

473
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:02,152
You can have tutoring at home.

474
00:31:02,778 --> 00:31:04,738
Awesome! That's sweet.

475
00:31:06,198 --> 00:31:07,699
Gosh.

476
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:10,285
Yes, it's awesome.

477
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:19,211
MISSED CALLS FROM GENERAL HWANG

478
00:31:28,387 --> 00:31:29,429
Hey, it's me.

479
00:31:29,513 --> 00:31:30,889
<i>Why didn't you pick up?</i>

480
00:31:31,932 --> 00:31:33,683
I was in a meeting.

481
00:31:33,767 --> 00:31:35,560
I'm on my way now. Is something wrong?

482
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:39,564
What?

483
00:31:49,366 --> 00:31:51,201
- Took you long enough.
- What happened?

484
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:54,579
Those guys came to the neighborhood again.

485
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:58,333
This is why we can't leave loose ends.

486
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:01,002
So what's your plan? To kill them all?

487
00:32:04,214 --> 00:32:05,257
If I must.

488
00:32:06,383 --> 00:32:08,301
You're not in JDD anymore.

489
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:11,430
You're just a regular guy with a family.

490
00:32:11,513 --> 00:32:13,473
I'm doing this to protect my family.

491
00:32:13,557 --> 00:32:14,599
By killing people?

492
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:22,149
Nam-yeon saved your wife,

493
00:32:22,232 --> 00:32:24,860
Yong-hui got her and Do-yeon home safely,

494
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:27,988
then handed things off to me just now.

495
00:32:29,823 --> 00:32:31,241
We can protect them together.

496
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:34,870
So don't even think
about crossing the line.

497
00:32:35,704 --> 00:32:36,580
Okay?

498
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:38,999
If you cross the line,
even to protect them,

499
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:42,627
there will come a day
when Do-yeon will reject you.

500
00:32:47,841 --> 00:32:48,800
I'm heading up.

501
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:53,805
Gosh, you're so stubborn.
Just listen to me.

502
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:12,949
Are you okay?

503
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:15,076
How's Do-yeon?

504
00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:17,204
She fell asleep while reading.

505
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:18,955
You can check on her.

506
00:33:49,778 --> 00:33:50,820
Mi-gyeong.

507
00:33:50,904 --> 00:33:52,572
Why didn't you pick up my calls?

508
00:33:54,324 --> 00:33:55,325
I'm sorry.

509
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:59,204
I had a meeting with someone,
and the cell reception there was bad.

510
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:03,416
Have a seat.

511
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:16,513
What's going on in this neighborhood?

512
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:21,726
Ms. Jung's face was fine at the market,
but it's all beaten up now.

513
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:24,354
And so is Mr. Kwak's face.

514
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:27,649
Don't try to play games.

515
00:34:27,983 --> 00:34:29,025
Tell me everything.

516
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:49,004
Remember how I got hurt

517
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:55,218
because the ATM booth exploded
when I was taking the trash out?

518
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:02,309
<i>That was from a bomb explosion.</i>

519
00:35:37,177 --> 00:35:39,054
THE THRILLING MOMENT
OF SAVING PRODUCER KIM!

520
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:41,598
THE MINISTER OF NATIONAL DEFENSE
ABDUCTED A CIVILIAN?

521
00:35:42,766 --> 00:35:45,894
<i>Didn't I tell you</i>
<i>to get rid of Kim In-seop?</i>

522
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:49,898
<i>You plan to keep up with this shit job?</i>

523
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:52,692
<i>I told you to leave no trace</i>

524
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:56,738
<i>of anyone and anything</i>
<i>related to the bombs.</i>

525
00:35:57,697 --> 00:35:58,990
<i>What should I do with you?</i>

526
00:35:59,074 --> 00:36:00,909
SAFE GAS STATION

527
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:02,035
<i>Producer Kim,</i>

528
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:04,412
how could you upload the video
without talking to us?

529
00:36:04,496 --> 00:36:06,706
I told you
there was an internal investigation.

530
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:09,959
There's nothing about him on the news,
not even on social media.

531
00:36:11,461 --> 00:36:13,963
And this is illegal evidence
that we can't even use in court.

532
00:36:14,047 --> 00:36:17,509
They'll just stall for time
before covering all this up.

533
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:20,178
I know because
I've covered similar cases before.

534
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:22,430
You still should've discussed it with us.

535
00:36:22,514 --> 00:36:24,599
We would've just wasted time!

536
00:36:24,933 --> 00:36:28,144
We don't know
what they're plotting right now!

537
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:31,815
What do you think you're doing?

538
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:34,234
Uploading the video without a heads-up?

539
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:38,279
That's for me to ask.

540
00:36:39,948 --> 00:36:43,618
Those guys tried to abduct my wife
in broad daylight.

541
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:45,328
Right in the neighborhood too.

542
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:47,288
What?

543
00:36:49,499 --> 00:36:52,210
Perhaps you just don't care
about civilians.

544
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:56,256
The higher your position,
the less you notice these things.

545
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:33,042
Hey, I need to see you.

546
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:35,253
Where?

547
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:41,593
Fine, I'll see you there.

548
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:46,055
Turn the car around.

549
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:51,811
Hey!

550
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:56,107
We could've met at the base
once you were down!

551
00:37:57,692 --> 00:37:59,402
But no, you just had to insist.

552
00:37:59,486 --> 00:38:01,780
You're a real soldier, indeed.

553
00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:03,782
You've got good stamina.

554
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:17,545
Did you see the video?

555
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:24,844
You're screwed.

556
00:38:25,178 --> 00:38:27,263
I'm not in the mood for jokes.

557
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:30,475
I'm not joking.

558
00:38:31,476 --> 00:38:33,478
You're hanging on by a thread.

559
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:34,729
Damn it!

560
00:38:36,773 --> 00:38:38,274
Take a deep breath.

561
00:38:38,358 --> 00:38:39,984
The air is fresh here, you know?

562
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:45,198
A breath of fresh air
can inspire all sorts of ideas.

563
00:38:47,242 --> 00:38:48,284
I'm dizzy.

564
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:50,620
Did you find the guy behind the bombs?

565
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:52,497
It was Sullivan.

566
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:56,376
The investor for the specialized IT zone.

567
00:38:57,669 --> 00:38:59,128
Sullivan.

568
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:01,464
How bold of him.

569
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:03,842
Tell me about it.

570
00:39:03,925 --> 00:39:06,010
Some nerve, huh?

571
00:39:06,094 --> 00:39:09,514
He paid double the price
to buy the arms we sold off.

572
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:11,266
What do we do?

573
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:17,605
How much do you trust me?

574
00:39:18,648 --> 00:39:19,566
Huh?

575
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:21,860
A lot?

576
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:27,407
I told you. We're on the same boat.

577
00:39:29,534 --> 00:39:31,536
Get a bomb ready.

578
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:33,371
To blow up Kiyun-si.

579
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:35,331
What?

580
00:39:39,878 --> 00:39:40,795
All right.

581
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:43,047
This is good.

582
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:46,551
This is awesome.

583
00:39:51,306 --> 00:39:53,057
Blow up Kiyun-si?

584
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:55,768
Blow up the police station.

585
00:39:56,144 --> 00:39:57,520
It's symbolic.

586
00:39:57,604 --> 00:39:59,689
The symbol of public authority and safety.

587
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:02,567
- Why?
- Why else?

588
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:05,695
If we say Sullivan is doing this
out of revenge

589
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:08,406
and that the reporter is on his side,

590
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:09,991
the public wouldn't forgive them.

591
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:12,243
You can step up then

592
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:16,539
and say you were just
trying to get the terrorist.

593
00:40:17,749 --> 00:40:18,917
Man!

594
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:23,796
She's so creative, huh?

595
00:40:24,339 --> 00:40:25,965
I should learn from her.

596
00:40:26,049 --> 00:40:28,551
Oh, gosh.

597
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:41,773
Seok-jun, you moron.

598
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,611
Sullivan.

599
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:51,157
How dare you test me?

600
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:55,745
I'll just blow up both of you at once.

601
00:40:59,082 --> 00:41:00,708
<i>How does this make any sense?</i>

602
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:03,753
<i>A can of butane gas from a shop</i>
<i>caused an explosion, leading to a death...</i>

603
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:06,089
<i>Apologies, sir. I'll take care of it.</i>

604
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:08,925
<i>- Take care of what? Huh?</i>
<i>- And most importantly,</i>

605
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:11,386
<i>- the locals are terrified.</i>
<i>- What can you even do?</i>

606
00:41:12,762 --> 00:41:16,015
<i>Therefore, I will file a strong complaint</i>

607
00:41:16,099 --> 00:41:17,642
<i>to the butane gas manufacturer</i>

608
00:41:18,351 --> 00:41:22,647
<i>and hold the former government</i>
<i>accountable once again.</i>

609
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:25,900
MAMMOSEU MART

610
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:29,612
Anyone can tell that this is Nam-yeon.

611
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:31,572
I knew it.

612
00:41:31,656 --> 00:41:34,701
It all makes sense now. I get it.

613
00:41:37,078 --> 00:41:38,913
She's so incredible.

614
00:41:45,962 --> 00:41:47,130
What's with you?

615
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:49,257
Just stay still.

616
00:41:50,717 --> 00:41:52,802
Thank you for everything.

617
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:55,638
You got injured trying to protect the town
and had to keep quiet.

618
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:58,766
What? How did you find out?

619
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:00,643
I'm your husband. How could I not?

620
00:42:00,727 --> 00:42:01,561
I just get it.

621
00:42:05,106 --> 00:42:06,149
Nam-yeon,

622
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:08,526
I always have your back.

623
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:11,821
Don't worry and spread your wings.

624
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:15,366
You're incredible.

625
00:42:20,997 --> 00:42:21,956
What the...

626
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:24,125
Did Byeong-nam tell him?

627
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:34,969
Wow, impressive.

628
00:42:35,053 --> 00:42:36,637
It's like a movie.

629
00:42:36,721 --> 00:42:38,389
Is that really Nam-yeon?

630
00:42:38,473 --> 00:42:40,266
Yeah, you know her.

631
00:42:40,349 --> 00:42:42,602
She was an instructor in the 707th Unit

632
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:45,104
and recently even defused a bomb.

633
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:47,065
Yeah, that's true.

634
00:42:47,148 --> 00:42:50,109
But wow, amazing.

635
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:53,529
You know the gas station
at the town entrance?

636
00:42:53,613 --> 00:42:54,447
Yeah.

637
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:58,576
I have a feeling that they hold
some strategic meetings there.

638
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:01,287
It's the perfect place
to be out of everyone's eyes.

639
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:04,457
You mean the underground level
of the gas station, then.

640
00:43:05,124 --> 00:43:06,042
The underground?

641
00:43:06,334 --> 00:43:09,962
They were digging so deep into the ground
when building that gas station

642
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:12,548
that I wondered
if it was for an oil storage,

643
00:43:13,049 --> 00:43:15,301
but they built something like a shelter.

644
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:16,677
A shelter?

645
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:20,723
You know, where people hide
when there's a war.

646
00:43:24,477 --> 00:43:25,937
Oh, that's why!

647
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:28,981
No wonder I couldn't see anyone.

648
00:43:29,899 --> 00:43:30,775
That's why!

649
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,365
Min-seo.

650
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:43,371
Hey!

651
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:49,585
What brings you here?

652
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:52,964
What happened to your face?

653
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:55,383
Did you fight my mom?
Her face is also scratched up.

654
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:56,968
Me, fight your mom?

655
00:43:58,136 --> 00:43:59,387
I'm here to pick you up.

656
00:44:01,097 --> 00:44:03,015
But there's plenty of time
before we start.

657
00:44:04,267 --> 00:44:05,643
Didn't your mom tell you?

658
00:44:06,144 --> 00:44:08,271
I'll be picking you up for the time being.

659
00:44:08,604 --> 00:44:09,438
Let's go.

660
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:13,234
No way. Why?

661
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:15,695
To start our session sooner.

662
00:44:20,283 --> 00:44:22,201
What about the days we don't meet?

663
00:44:23,286 --> 00:44:25,079
I'll still pick you up. Get in.

664
00:44:28,166 --> 00:44:29,792
- Put on your seatbelt.
- Okay.

665
00:44:39,844 --> 00:44:41,304
Whatever it is,

666
00:44:41,387 --> 00:44:44,432
just don't let it
get to Do-yeon or me, okay?

667
00:44:45,308 --> 00:44:46,684
We can protect them together.

668
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:50,021
So don't even think
about crossing the line.

669
00:44:50,563 --> 00:44:52,481
If you cross the line,
even to protect them,

670
00:44:52,565 --> 00:44:54,859
<i>there will come a day</i>
<i>when Do-yeon will reject you.</i>

671
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:03,326
LEE YONG-HUI

672
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:05,745
Yes, I just brought her to the gym.

673
00:45:05,828 --> 00:45:09,832
I'll keep her at my gym
until you or your wife comes,

674
00:45:09,916 --> 00:45:12,376
<i>so don't worry and take your time.</i>

675
00:45:13,085 --> 00:45:15,379
- Thank you.
-<i> Master Lee!</i>

676
00:45:15,463 --> 00:45:16,923
Let's play together.

677
00:45:17,006 --> 00:45:19,050
All right. See you later, Kang.

678
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:31,938
MAMMOSEU MART

679
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:40,029
You can head in first. I'll park the car.

680
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:41,739
Okay.

681
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:08,849
Lee Su-jin speaking.

682
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:11,269
Jeong-hwan?

683
00:46:12,812 --> 00:46:14,522
What? Mercenaries?

684
00:46:15,231 --> 00:46:16,607
Wait! Let me talk to him.

685
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:19,986
What about mercenaries? Go again.

686
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:22,738
Again?

687
00:46:23,114 --> 00:46:26,117
Why do these bastards keep messing around
in our neighborhood?

688
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,660
<i>I'm tailing them right now.</i>

689
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:29,704
Okay, I'll make the calls.

690
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:32,248
What did he say?

691
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:34,041
Those guys are back.

692
00:46:35,501 --> 00:46:37,753
It must be
because of the video I uploaded.

693
00:46:37,837 --> 00:46:39,171
No.

694
00:46:39,255 --> 00:46:40,089
CHOI KANG

695
00:46:40,172 --> 00:46:42,216
There's no cell reception. I'm off.

696
00:46:52,852 --> 00:46:54,520
- <i>Hey.</i>
<i>-</i> Hey, Kang.

697
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:57,064
Those guys are in our neighborhood again.

698
00:46:57,648 --> 00:46:58,691
Where?

699
00:46:58,774 --> 00:47:00,776
<i>Jeong-hwan is tailing them right now.</i>

700
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:03,321
I'll be there in 20 minutes.
Tell me where he is.

701
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:08,451
I won't kill them, all right?

702
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:09,994
Good.

703
00:47:10,077 --> 00:47:12,330
There's nothing bad
about listening to your elders.

704
00:47:12,413 --> 00:47:14,248
Gosh, his temper.

705
00:47:22,423 --> 00:47:23,507
PARK JEONG-HWAN

706
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:26,218
Hello?

707
00:47:26,927 --> 00:47:27,928
The police station?

708
00:47:29,305 --> 00:47:31,057
There are security cameras there.

709
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:32,058
Hold on.

710
00:47:38,898 --> 00:47:42,360
CHANGRI POLICE STATION

711
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:46,364
- Hello!
- Hey.

712
00:47:46,447 --> 00:47:48,491
I told you I could pick it up.

713
00:47:49,408 --> 00:47:52,286
You already do so much for us.
It's the least I can do.

714
00:47:52,411 --> 00:47:54,455
- Thank you.
- Have a good day.

715
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:56,916
Oh, right. Have you...

716
00:47:56,999 --> 00:47:58,793
Have you watched it?

717
00:47:58,876 --> 00:47:59,835
Watch what?

718
00:47:59,919 --> 00:48:02,713
You know, the video online.

719
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:14,809
Su-il?

720
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:16,560
SU-IL

721
00:48:29,949 --> 00:48:30,950
Gosh.

722
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:32,743
Hey, Byeong-nam.

723
00:48:32,827 --> 00:48:35,788
Hey, you see that box
in front of the police station?

724
00:48:36,038 --> 00:48:37,415
What? A box?

725
00:48:39,083 --> 00:48:39,959
A box?

726
00:48:42,837 --> 00:48:45,464
Yeah, I see it.

727
00:48:45,714 --> 00:48:46,882
Is it for Officer Park?

728
00:48:46,966 --> 00:48:49,301
No, don't go back in. Just open the box.

729
00:48:50,094 --> 00:48:51,137
Okay.

730
00:48:52,471 --> 00:48:55,141
Hold up. How did you know I was here?

731
00:48:55,224 --> 00:48:56,392
Just open it.

732
00:48:57,017 --> 00:48:58,060
But it's not mine.

733
00:48:58,144 --> 00:48:59,603
Just open it.

734
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:00,771
I don't want to.

735
00:49:00,855 --> 00:49:02,022
Come on!

736
00:49:02,106 --> 00:49:03,732
<i>Just open it!</i>

737
00:49:03,816 --> 00:49:05,609
So demanding. Fine.

738
00:49:06,277 --> 00:49:09,363
What is it? Why do I need to open it?

739
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:29,508
Hold up. Hey, Byeong-nam,

740
00:49:29,925 --> 00:49:32,136
it's a bomb.

741
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:33,762
<i>What do I do?</i>

742
00:49:37,183 --> 00:49:39,768
Listen to me carefully.

743
00:49:40,311 --> 00:49:43,314
<i>Leave that there,</i>
<i>and drive as far away as possible.</i>

744
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:44,523
Okay.

745
00:49:44,607 --> 00:49:47,234
Hey, wait. Officer Park is inside.

746
00:49:47,318 --> 00:49:49,236
Tell him to run away, too.

747
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:51,614
Okay, I'm hanging up.

748
00:49:51,697 --> 00:49:52,531
Hold up.

749
00:50:00,789 --> 00:50:01,874
Hold up.

750
00:50:04,168 --> 00:50:05,169
Hold up.

751
00:50:27,608 --> 00:50:29,777
I'm heading to the Hanbal Mountain.

752
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:31,737
- Be careful.
<i>- Okay.</i>

753
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:33,447
They're taking the ring road.

754
00:50:40,829 --> 00:50:41,872
Hey, go faster.

755
00:50:53,008 --> 00:50:54,426
What is he doing?

756
00:50:54,510 --> 00:50:56,220
What are you doing? Run!

757
00:50:57,388 --> 00:51:00,182
It can't explode here.

758
00:51:00,266 --> 00:51:01,267
What is he...

759
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:18,534
Has he lost his mind?

760
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:44,476
Byeong-nam! What's going on?

761
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:47,187
Hey, look for the Mammoseu Mart van
with the security cameras.

762
00:51:47,271 --> 00:51:48,856
- Okay.
- Hurry!

763
00:51:58,616 --> 00:51:59,783
KWAK BYEONG-NAM

764
00:52:00,868 --> 00:52:02,036
Hey.

765
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:04,288
<i>Su-il, can you hear me?</i>

766
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:05,706
What are you thinking?

767
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:07,458
No idea.

768
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:11,211
But this can't go off
in the middle of the town.

769
00:52:11,295 --> 00:52:13,172
How far am I from the ocean?

770
00:52:13,255 --> 00:52:15,883
We don't know when it'll go off!
The ocean is too far!

771
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:21,388
I'll call you back.

772
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:24,099
I need a proper farewell with Nam-yeon.

773
00:52:24,183 --> 00:52:25,309
<i>Su-il!</i>

774
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:26,560
Damn it!

775
00:52:45,829 --> 00:52:47,581
What's going on?
You should be back by now.

776
00:52:48,916 --> 00:52:50,501
Hey, Nam-yeon.

777
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:52,836
What is it now?

778
00:52:53,337 --> 00:52:57,549
You know, you and Minseo...

779
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:00,719
You guys are my everything.

780
00:53:00,803 --> 00:53:01,929
You know that, right?

781
00:53:02,346 --> 00:53:04,473
What's going on?

782
00:53:04,556 --> 00:53:05,974
Are you hurt?

783
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:08,310
I, Kim Su-il,

784
00:53:09,311 --> 00:53:11,563
have only loved you,

785
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:15,150
Jung Nam-yeon.

786
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:17,194
I'm asking you what's going on!

787
00:53:38,132 --> 00:53:39,133
KWAK BYEONG-NAM

788
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:42,761
He just has to ruin
my main character moment.

789
00:53:44,304 --> 00:53:45,889
What now?

790
00:53:45,973 --> 00:53:48,517
Su-il, come to the gas station.

791
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:50,769
With the bomb? Are you crazy?

792
00:53:51,603 --> 00:53:53,897
Just do as I say. How long will it take?

793
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:38,168
No...

794
00:56:20,752 --> 00:56:23,714
SAFE GAS STATION

795
00:56:23,797 --> 00:56:26,717
- Why did you do that?
- Stop yelling at him!

796
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:28,552
He saved the world!

797
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:30,262
Yeah, I saved the world.

798
00:56:30,345 --> 00:56:33,181
It would've been a disaster
if it weren't for him.

799
00:56:36,685 --> 00:56:40,397
He just has to ruin
my main character moment.

800
00:56:42,024 --> 00:56:43,150
What now?

801
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:45,569
Su-il, come to the gas station.

802
00:56:46,028 --> 00:56:48,363
With the bomb? Are you crazy?

803
00:56:48,447 --> 00:56:50,782
Just do as I say. How long will it take?

804
00:56:51,158 --> 00:56:52,492
About two minutes?

805
00:56:52,993 --> 00:56:54,620
That soon?

806
00:56:54,870 --> 00:56:57,122
Hey, who do you think I am?

807
00:56:57,706 --> 00:56:58,916
Just hold on.

808
00:57:06,465 --> 00:57:09,009
- It could've been a disaster.
- You're amazing, Su-il!

809
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:10,218
I was so worried!

810
00:57:10,302 --> 00:57:12,804
Mr. Kim, you'll move
to a different shelter today.

811
00:57:13,138 --> 00:57:14,640
Oh, where?

812
00:57:14,723 --> 00:57:18,268
I can't tell you where,
but it'll be safer than here.

813
00:57:19,019 --> 00:57:19,853
Okay.

814
00:57:20,312 --> 00:57:22,481
You were incredible, Su-il.

815
00:57:22,564 --> 00:57:24,858
- The counter-terrorism unit is coming.
- Are they?

816
00:57:24,942 --> 00:57:27,653
How did you think
to bring this here anyway?

817
00:57:27,736 --> 00:57:30,614
I knew all radio waves
are blocked off here.

818
00:57:30,697 --> 00:57:32,115
What if it were a time bomb?

819
00:57:32,199 --> 00:57:33,617
I know, Byeong-nam!

820
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:37,037
That was the first thing I checked.

821
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:38,121
You think I'm dumb?

822
00:57:38,622 --> 00:57:41,458
Anyway, it would've been better for it
to explode here than in town.

823
00:57:41,541 --> 00:57:42,376
That's true.

824
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:44,503
You almost made me explode.

825
00:57:44,586 --> 00:57:46,088
- Stop it.
- Come on, that hurts.

826
00:57:46,171 --> 00:57:48,382
Seriously, cut it out.

827
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:49,967
Why you little...

828
00:57:51,009 --> 00:57:53,470
Anyway, what is this place?

829
00:57:53,553 --> 00:57:54,805
It looks so cool.

830
00:57:55,263 --> 00:57:56,473
Wait. You guys, too.

831
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:03,105
You guys are like heroes.

832
00:58:03,397 --> 00:58:04,564
Heroes Next Door.

833
00:58:05,399 --> 00:58:07,275
"Heroes Next Door"? That sounds lame.

834
00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:09,319
What are we, Power Rangers?

835
00:58:09,403 --> 00:58:11,488
- Hey, I think it sounds cool!
- I like it.

836
00:58:12,406 --> 00:58:13,907
Power Rangers? Are you kidding me?

837
00:58:13,991 --> 00:58:16,410
I just thought it sounded lame...

838
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:17,953
You're lame.

839
00:58:19,413 --> 00:58:20,664
Your face is lame.

840
00:58:57,784 --> 00:58:58,994
Where are you going?

841
00:59:15,594 --> 00:59:17,262
Did you give the order
to abduct Mi-gyeong?

842
00:59:18,722 --> 00:59:20,682
What the hell are you talking about?

843
00:59:31,902 --> 00:59:33,820
Don't make me repeat myself.

844
00:59:33,904 --> 00:59:35,739
You're Choi Kang, aren't you?

845
00:59:36,281 --> 00:59:37,699
Who the hell are you?

846
00:59:37,783 --> 00:59:39,034
I'll be asking the questions here.

847
00:59:41,495 --> 00:59:43,371
Did you give the order to abduct my wife?

848
00:59:46,625 --> 00:59:48,460
That's right. I did.

849
00:59:49,753 --> 00:59:50,837
Why?

850
00:59:50,921 --> 00:59:52,297
Why do you think?

851
00:59:52,714 --> 00:59:54,466
To get you, of course.

852
00:59:55,759 --> 00:59:57,719
Who set off the bombs in Changri-dong?

853
00:59:58,845 --> 01:00:01,139
That's none of your business.

854
01:00:01,223 --> 01:00:02,849
I told you. Don't make me repeat myself.

855
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:07,687
It was Sullivan! It was Jame Sullivan!

856
01:00:10,065 --> 01:00:13,735
I confirmed
that Sullivan bought the bombs.

857
01:00:17,989 --> 01:00:18,949
Watch out!

858
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:22,119
My Myeong-o...

859
01:00:22,202 --> 01:00:25,455
- Where did you get that ice cream?
- That man gave me ice cream.

860
01:00:25,539 --> 01:00:27,916
Guess who we ran into on our way home?

861
01:00:27,999 --> 01:00:28,834
Sullivan.

862
01:00:28,917 --> 01:00:30,710
YOU'RE MAKING THINGS COMPLICATED
JDD SPECIAL OPERATIONS FORCES, CHOI KANG

863
01:00:36,216 --> 01:00:39,928
You've got the wrong guy.

864
01:00:41,721 --> 01:00:42,764
Who says?

865
01:02:36,294 --> 01:02:39,339
We finally meet, Mr. Choi Kang.

866
01:03:37,689 --> 01:03:40,608
HEROES NEXT DOOR

867
01:03:40,692 --> 01:03:41,818
<i>How did you know about me?</i>

868
01:03:41,901 --> 01:03:45,030
<i>What should be done about</i>
<i>someone who manipulated a court ruling?</i>

869
01:03:45,113 --> 01:03:47,115
<i>I'm getting blackmailed.</i>

870
01:03:47,198 --> 01:03:49,075
<i>It's your turn now.</i>

871
01:03:49,159 --> 01:03:51,328
<i>There will be another bomb.</i>

872
01:03:51,411 --> 01:03:52,329
Good luck finding it.

873
01:03:52,412 --> 01:03:55,165
Sullivan's guys are pros. We might die.

874
01:03:55,248 --> 01:03:56,291
He'll blow everything up.

875
01:03:56,374 --> 01:03:58,752
<i>Seems like Sullivan</i>
<i>will do something to this neighborhood.</i>

876
01:03:58,835 --> 01:04:00,420
What, are you immortal?

877
01:04:00,503 --> 01:04:02,922
<i>Wouldn't one of the bombs</i>
<i>be at the interview?</i>

878
01:04:03,006 --> 01:04:05,967
<i>I won't let you off with a warning</i>
<i>if you meddle with my plans again.</i>

879
01:04:06,092 --> 01:04:07,761
- Kang.
- Stay back!

880
