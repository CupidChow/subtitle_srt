HEROES NEXT DOOR

2
00:00:42,084 --> 00:00:43,001
THIS DRAMA IS A WORK OF FICTION.
ALL CHARACTERS, PROFESSIONS, PLACES,

3
00:00:43,085 --> 00:00:44,002
COMPANIES, ORGANIZATIONS,
ETHNIC GROUPS AND EVENTS ARE NOT REAL.

4
00:00:44,086 --> 00:00:45,003
ALL CHILD AND ANIMAL SCENES WERE FILMED
SAFELY UNDER EXPERT SUPERVISION.

5
00:00:53,262 --> 00:00:54,846
I'll be on my own.

6
00:00:55,347 --> 00:00:56,640
I have somewhere to go.

7
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:04,064
Do you think you're the main dish
while the rest of us are sides?

8
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:07,609
You know, a main dish can only shine
when the sides do the work.

9
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,742
What, are you immortal?

10
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:17,578
You're going to save everyone on your own?

11
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:19,454
You're delusional.

12
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:28,380
And what would you do?

13
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,090
Swoop in like a real hero.

14
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:45,480
CHANGRI CHURCH

15
00:01:58,869 --> 00:01:59,911
Kang.

16
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:09,338
Stay back.

17
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,091
Stay back!

18
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:02,015
Byeong-nam.

19
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:03,058
Byeong-nam!

20
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:08,522
Byeong-nam.

21
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:10,440
Byeong-nam.

22
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:11,441
Byeong-nam...

23
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:20,117
Byeong-nam!

24
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:21,326
Byeong-nam.

25
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:25,956
Byeong-nam!

26
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:29,501
Byeong-nam...

27
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:35,173
Are you okay, Byeong-nam?

28
00:03:42,264 --> 00:03:43,140
Hey.

29
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:47,102
I saved the main dish.

30
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:49,771
What?

31
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:53,108
The side dish saved

32
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:56,194
the main dish.

33
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,534
For god's sake...

34
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,456
Fine.

35
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:11,501
You can be anything you want,
the main, the side, or the dessert.

36
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:13,920
Seriously...

37
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:19,718
Let's get out of here.

38
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:21,136
What's wrong?

39
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:23,805
- That hurts. I told you it hurts!
- It hurts?

40
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:30,479
Why does my head hurt so much?

41
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:34,316
All right, then.

42
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:36,860
I'm the main dish from now on.

43
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:37,861
Hey!

44
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,155
What was that thing covering you?

45
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:41,698
Just something I made.

46
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:55,212
A WHISTLE FOR THE BAD GUY

47
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,507
SAFE GAS STATION

48
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:02,052
Two bombs exploded,

49
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:04,596
but the news only covered
the phone explosion.

50
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:06,765
They put an embargo on it.

51
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:09,434
So the higher-ups know everything?

52
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:15,065
This involves the Minister, the Speaker,
and corruption in defense,

53
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:17,234
so they're being extra cautious.

54
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:19,861
Nobody will care about the bombs

55
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:23,907
once the corruption
in the top brass comes to light.

56
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:27,869
And Sullivan must know that.

57
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,164
It's the anniversary of Charlotte's death
in three days.

58
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:33,375
He may have failed today,

59
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:35,794
but he must've planned more.

60
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,968
Why are you back in your clothes already?

61
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:45,011
Hey, come on.

62
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:46,972
I'm not dying or anything.

63
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:48,014
Who says you are?

64
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:50,141
Just rest when you can.

65
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:52,561
Yeah, just rest for a few days.

66
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:55,689
I'm really fine.

67
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:58,024
What about the store?

68
00:05:58,567 --> 00:06:00,318
Who cares about the store right now?

69
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:02,904
I care, of course.

70
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:04,948
Are you sure you took care of everything?

71
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,581
This is from Ms. Na.

72
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:18,920
So heavy.

73
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:21,798
How are you?

74
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:27,262
She dislocated her shoulder,
but she's refusing to rest.

75
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:29,598
I told you I'm fine.

76
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,518
I'll pay for the hospital bill.

77
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:35,228
Rest up.

78
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:38,899
An injured bone can haunt you for life
if you don't treat it right.

79
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:40,275
We're old now, after all.

80
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:44,738
Who says I want you to pay for me?

81
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,991
I have money and insurance.

82
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:50,785
Just let me do this for you, okay?

83
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:56,374
I'm alive thanks to you.

84
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:05,717
My goodness!

85
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,927
Oh, stop screaming.

86
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,264
I want to thank you.

87
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:14,809
Whatever.

88
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:17,395
As long as you're not hurt.

89
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:23,443
KIYUN HOSPITAL

90
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:37,040
Did the other bomb explode as well?

91
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:41,419
That crazy bastard.

92
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:44,589
He really tried to kill me.

93
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:47,008
But you're alive.

94
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:52,055
Since you're still alive,
Sullivan's not done yet.

95
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:55,976
What do we do now?

96
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:59,062
Ask the police for personal protection

97
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,439
and stay low for a while.

98
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:09,114
He can't just leave like that.

99
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:13,118
Who makes their bed
when leaving the hospital?

100
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:15,537
I have to leave it spotless.

101
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,497
- Are you leaving already?
- Hey.

102
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:21,501
You know my family loves to leave
as soon as we're hospitalized.

103
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,712
No need to take up a hospital bed
when I'm fine.

104
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:25,922
How about you? Are you okay?

105
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:28,341
Yeah, as you can see, I'm fine.

106
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:30,635
How's Byeong-nam?

107
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:39,019
So I climbed the stairs
three steps at a time

108
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:40,437
and spotted Kang.

109
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:42,230
So what happened?

110
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:44,566
As soon as I saw the bomb,

111
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:48,903
I basically teleported to it...

112
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:51,698
- You basically flew!
- I did!

113
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,408
But Kang saw me and yelled,

114
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:56,202
"Byeong-nam. Stay back!"

115
00:08:56,494 --> 00:09:00,457
That's when I knew I had to save him.

116
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,375
It was the only thing on my mind.

117
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,794
Chun-bae, you know my special move.

118
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:06,421
Your special move?

119
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:08,506
The dropkick that you always talk about?

120
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,134
It's not just any dropkick.

121
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:12,886
It's legendary.

122
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:16,514
It was back in 2003

123
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:19,809
when that legendary dropkick
almost became a lost skill

124
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:21,436
due to my injury from a military mission.

125
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,980
I unleashed that dropkick with full force

126
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:25,023
and saved Kang.

127
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:28,651
Then I quickly took out my shield
from my backpack

128
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:30,737
- when the bomb went, "Bang!"
- "Bang!"

129
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,447
I landed with a perfect breakfall.

130
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:33,907
A breakfall! What happened next?

131
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:39,412
Then I comforted Kang,
who was shivering in fear,

132
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:40,997
and came to the hospital with him.

133
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:44,125
Kang isn't the type to get scared, is he?

134
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:47,504
I just know you'll yap about this
for the next ten years.

135
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:48,630
I'm not exaggerating!

136
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:50,256
Where's Ms. Jung, by the way?

137
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:54,177
Su-il tried to stop her,
but she insisted on going home.

138
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,304
Man, she's so stubborn.

139
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:58,223
I have to see her before she leaves.

140
00:09:58,306 --> 00:09:59,682
- See you later.
- Bye.

141
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,810
- See you.
- Take care!

142
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:03,186
- Hey.
- Bye.

143
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:06,147
I'll show you
the legendary dropkick next time.

144
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:07,899
Mr. Kwak.

145
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:09,651
Oh, hello, Doctor.

146
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:11,194
How do you feel?

147
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:13,863
Here's the thing, Doctor.

148
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,324
I think some of the shards got to me.

149
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:18,535
I'm feeling a bit dizzy.

150
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:21,663
And my wrist is a bit sore

151
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:23,790
from my powerful breakfall.

152
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:27,961
I think what happened is

153
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:30,630
that you had your fists up like this
in fear of the explosion,

154
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:33,424
that you hit your own head.

155
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:36,219
The punch was so strong
that you got a wrist fracture.

156
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:40,723
Oh, so the shock from the explosion

157
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:43,184
made me hit my head like this?

158
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:45,728
I basically just punched my own head?

159
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:47,397
Yes, basically.

160
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:50,775
Your headache should be gone soon
with some pills.

161
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:51,943
- Really?
- Yes.

162
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,903
- Get some rest.
- Thank you.

163
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:58,074
How did I...

164
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,202
I hit my own head?

165
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:07,125
Hey, you heard the doctor, right?

166
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,878
I have a headache and a twisted wrist

167
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:12,338
from the shock of that explosion.

168
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:14,966
So you hit your head like this
and passed out.

169
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,094
What are you talking about?

170
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:20,013
You know how dangerous it was.

171
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:23,016
- Fine.
- Come on.

172
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:26,227
By the way, are you okay?

173
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:27,812
Yeah.

174
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:33,359
Why do you look so glum?

175
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:34,944
I'm the one who got hurt.

176
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:38,865
I just feel like this isn't the end.

177
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,074
What do you mean?

178
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:43,870
There seem to be more bombs coming.

179
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:01,304
- She's out!
- Here she is.

180
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:04,807
She'll issue a statement later.

181
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:08,353
Excuse me. She'll issue a statement later.

182
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:11,981
It's the woman from earlier!

183
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:15,235
It's the woman who kicked the phone!

184
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,570
How did you know the phone was a bomb?

185
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:19,197
How did you know it would explode?

186
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,366
Is it true that you defused
the fake bomb from before?

187
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:34,754
How do you feel right now?

188
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:03,283
LAND PURCHASE AGREEMENT

189
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:12,500
TRANSCRIPT OF RECORDING

190
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:16,796
You've done a lot of research on me.

191
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:20,091
Why are you showing me this?

192
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:24,053
Mr. Lee,

193
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:26,764
haven't you seen the video?

194
00:13:26,848 --> 00:13:29,017
I almost died just now.

195
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,269
Don't you think this is crossing the line?

196
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:35,565
Ms. Na.

197
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:36,816
What?

198
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:40,153
You have the files
on Kim Seok-jun's illegal acts, right?

199
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,199
What are you talking about?

200
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:48,369
You paid to have the Speaker's son
declared innocent

201
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:51,331
and were promised to have Kiyun-si
designated as a specialized zone.

202
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:53,166
Then you and the Minister

203
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,502
bought land in that area
under borrowed names.

204
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:02,008
Give me the files
on Kim Seok-jun's secret land purchases.

205
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,682
Why should I?

206
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,103
If you hand that over,

207
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:18,399
we'll protect you from Sullivan.

208
00:14:24,906 --> 00:14:25,740
How?

209
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:33,206
<i>This afternoon, at the press conference</i>
<i>by Assemblywoman Na Eun-jae,</i>

210
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:35,333
<i>a phone suspected to have been sent</i>

211
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:38,711
- <i>by the blackmailer exploded.</i>
- So much dust.

212
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:42,382
<i>Ms. Na had held this press conference</i>

213
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:44,759
<i>to discuss the recent threats</i>
<i>she'd received.</i>

214
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:49,055
<i>Thankfully, nobody was harmed</i>
<i>by the explosion.</i>

215
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,265
<i>The police have taken the phone...</i>

216
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:53,851
Was this why you told us
to stay in the whole day?

217
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:58,940
Yeah, I was going to
tell you in the morning,

218
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:00,400
but I wasn't entirely sure yet.

219
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:02,652
<i>The surrounding areas</i>
<i>are partially blocked off...</i>

220
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,946
I didn't get hurt,

221
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:07,031
and Byeong-nam only got minor injuries.

222
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:07,949
It's fine.

223
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:20,169
Can you and Do-yeon stay home for a while?

224
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:24,382
So she doesn't go to kindergarten,
and I don't go to work?

225
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:25,466
Yeah.

226
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,468
Please stay home for a couple days.

227
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:30,638
Mom!

228
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:33,474
Can I bring Pinky
to kindergarten tomorrow?

229
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:34,767
No.

230
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:36,853
Why not?

231
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,230
You're both going to be there tomorrow.

232
00:15:40,148 --> 00:15:41,941
Pinky is our family, too.

233
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:45,111
Sorry, Pinky. Mom says no.

234
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:47,280
But I'll play with you a lot.

235
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:53,119
She's been like that all day.

236
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:54,787
"Why can't I go to kindergarten today?"

237
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:57,999
"I can't wait until tomorrow
so I can go to the playground."

238
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:01,002
I'm fine staying home,

239
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:03,212
but she'll be bored to death.

240
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:04,881
You know your daughter.

241
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:07,717
It's a bigger emergency to keep her home.

242
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:10,970
She has her kindergarten teachers

243
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:13,014
and Mr. Lee at Yongmu Gym.

244
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:16,517
Don't worry, okay?

245
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,192
Keep cleaning.

246
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:25,443
Oh, right.

247
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:30,865
- It's so dusty.
- Yeah.

248
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:35,828
KIYUN DREAM KINDERGARTEN
Is the open class tomorrow a good idea?

249
00:16:36,454 --> 00:16:37,914
It's been so chaotic lately.

250
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:40,291
The director wants us to go ahead with it.

251
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:43,252
There are way too many events this month.

252
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,713
I'm not even done writing the class notes.

253
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:46,881
Me neither.

254
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:50,885
Olivia, do you have everything you need?

255
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:17,703
No.

256
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:20,081
Why not?

257
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:23,125
I'm meeting friends today,
and there's a birthday party tomorrow.

258
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:24,669
Can I please skip lessons for two days?

259
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:25,711
Absolutely not.

260
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:27,588
I'm picking you up after school.

261
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:29,507
Why are you also on my case?

262
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:32,176
It's not like there's a war.

263
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,261
Min-seo.

264
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:36,806
Didn't you see your mom
getting hurt while saving people?

265
00:17:39,934 --> 00:17:42,270
All of this is to protect you, so behave.

266
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:48,609
Watch your step.

267
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:53,906
I get to bring home
the Pinky I made today.

268
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:56,450
Your Pinky at home will be so sad.

269
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:59,870
No, the stuffed Pinky is the older sister,

270
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:01,831
and the clay Pinky is the younger sister.

271
00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:05,126
And I can hug the older Pinky to sleep,

272
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:07,336
but the younger Pinky
isn't soft enough to snuggle.

273
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:09,755
But it lights up!

274
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:13,801
I can't wait to meet younger Pinky.

275
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:15,052
- Right?
- Yeah.

276
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:22,268
Good morning!

277
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:24,729
All three of you are heading out together!

278
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:26,397
- Good morning.
- Hi, Do-yeon.

279
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,149
It's an open class at her kindergarten.

280
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:31,694
No wonder Do-yeon is so excited.

281
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:32,612
Yes!

282
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,781
How are you feeling?

283
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:36,907
I'm fine.

284
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:39,327
I'm so glad nobody got seriously hurt.

285
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:43,664
I always scold Byeong-nam
for being up to no good,

286
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:44,999
but he did well this time.

287
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:46,000
For sure.

288
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:49,378
We're going to be late, Dad.

289
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:51,464
Yes, you should go!

290
00:18:52,173 --> 00:18:54,133
Have a good day in class, Do-yeon!

291
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:55,760
Thank you, goodbye!

292
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:57,178
- Have a good day.
- You too!

293
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:58,512
Hurry!

294
00:18:58,596 --> 00:19:00,556
KIYUN DREAM KINDERGARTEN

295
00:19:21,202 --> 00:19:22,787
It's Do-yeon's turn.

296
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:06,122
Did you hear her? She sounds so fluent!

297
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,207
Where did she get all that talent?

298
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,334
You're embarrassing me. Tone it down.

299
00:20:20,803 --> 00:20:22,221
CHOI DO-YEON

300
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,860
These are home decor figurines
that the kids made.

301
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:38,863
When you turn on the switch at home,

302
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:41,615
it becomes a beautiful lamp.

303
00:20:41,699 --> 00:20:43,409
You can charge it with a USB cord.

304
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,586
Please don't forget to send us photos.

305
00:20:53,836 --> 00:20:55,629
We'll add them to the kids' albums.

306
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:06,182
I was worried about her joining mid-term,

307
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,933
but she's fitting in well.

308
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:09,226
Didn't you hear her teacher?

309
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:11,604
She's super popular.

310
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:13,063
She's so good at English, too.

311
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:14,690
Will you be home late?

312
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:17,067
No, well...

313
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:20,362
I'll just drop by the hospital after work.

314
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:21,739
Byeong-nam is getting discharged.

315
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:24,867
Invite him home for dinner.

316
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:26,494
Today? Why?

317
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:28,245
So we can treat him to a meal.

318
00:21:28,496 --> 00:21:29,705
You said he lives alone.

319
00:21:30,164 --> 00:21:31,916
He probably can't cook
with an injured wrist.

320
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,211
Let me know if you need me
to grab anything on the way.

321
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:37,588
- Really?
- Yeah.

322
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:40,049
- You'll buy anything?
- Of course!

323
00:21:40,758 --> 00:21:42,134
With your allowance?

324
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:43,844
- No, with your money.
- Mine?

325
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:02,196
The bathroom is around the corner.

326
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,367
Where? I don't see it.

327
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,911
Take off your sunglasses first.

328
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:11,330
There are no windows, anyway.

329
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,920
The beds are over there.

330
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:25,553
Get me a separate room.

331
00:22:25,636 --> 00:22:27,221
This isn't a hotel.

332
00:22:28,222 --> 00:22:30,850
And that stuff is dangerous,
so don't touch anything.

333
00:22:34,645 --> 00:22:36,230
ARMORY

334
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:38,023
They're all guns?

335
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:39,900
Hey!

336
00:22:40,568 --> 00:22:42,528
Don't touch any of that. It's dangerous.

337
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:47,116
Is this an electrical fence?

338
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,744
Gosh, they bought so much stuff for me.

339
00:22:50,828 --> 00:22:53,163
When will I finish them all?

340
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,042
Anything else?

341
00:22:57,793 --> 00:22:58,794
Is this all?

342
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:00,713
What are you doing here?

343
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:02,256
I could've handled it alone.

344
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:03,883
Thanks.

345
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:05,634
Damn right.

346
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:07,720
Aren't you thankful
that this big brother saved you?

347
00:23:08,304 --> 00:23:10,556
No, for being alive.

348
00:23:14,602 --> 00:23:17,104
You want to carry this?
You said you could do it alone.

349
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:18,314
Where's your car?

350
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:19,982
The underground parking lot? Let's go.

351
00:23:34,997 --> 00:23:38,709
I suffer from some trauma
after an overseas operation.

352
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:39,835
Yeah?

353
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:43,964
Whenever something happens,

354
00:23:44,048 --> 00:23:45,591
I hear ringing in my ears.

355
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:47,801
I get a headache and feel dizzy, too.

356
00:23:48,177 --> 00:23:51,305
The sound we hear when we connect a modem?

357
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:54,350
The beeps?

358
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:55,768
Yeah, something like that.

359
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:59,313
But lately,
those symptoms have disappeared.

360
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:02,024
Remember what you said?

361
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:06,570
That I wasn't in JDD anymore,
and that I was just a regular guy?

362
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:11,533
That I didn't need to be alone,
and that we could work together.

363
00:24:13,494 --> 00:24:15,329
Maybe it's because
I've found people I could trust,

364
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:17,498
but the symptoms are gone.

365
00:24:18,374 --> 00:24:20,125
It's all thanks to you.

366
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,838
That's who I am, okay, little one?

367
00:24:24,922 --> 00:24:26,131
Be good to me.

368
00:24:29,343 --> 00:24:31,220
Why are you giving me the doe eyes?

369
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:32,262
Gross.

370
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:34,682
Thank you. I mean it.

371
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:39,561
Appreciation
is meant to be shown in numbers.

372
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:40,980
I'll send you my bank info.

373
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:48,278
Come over later.
General Hwang invited you.

374
00:24:48,362 --> 00:24:49,363
Me? Why?

375
00:24:49,697 --> 00:24:51,532
She wants to cook dinner for you
to thank you.

376
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:52,908
Really?

377
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:53,909
Does that mean

378
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:56,996
I get to try the famous curry kimchi stew?

379
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:59,707
The curry kimchi stew
you've been raving about?

380
00:25:00,249 --> 00:25:02,418
I can't wait.

381
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:05,129
I'm already salivating.

382
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:08,382
This is awesome.

383
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:11,010
Oh, wow.

384
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:13,846
I was actually worried
about what to make for dinner.

385
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:15,055
No need to cook.

386
00:25:15,139 --> 00:25:16,890
They're all side dishes,

387
00:25:16,974 --> 00:25:18,684
so just eat them with a fried egg.

388
00:25:18,976 --> 00:25:20,394
Min-seo can fry an egg, right?

389
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:21,812
My husband's good at it.

390
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,857
Anyway, thank you so much.

391
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,400
These look so good.

392
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:28,152
Don't do anything until you're healed.

393
00:25:28,402 --> 00:25:30,362
It's fine to take a break
from housework for a few days.

394
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:31,613
I know.

395
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:33,907
I've been getting so spoiled
since my injury.

396
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:36,660
But why stop there?

397
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:38,454
You should run for the next election.

398
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:39,371
What?

399
00:25:39,455 --> 00:25:43,125
All city councils and politicians
ever do is lie.

400
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:45,502
But you saved a life.

401
00:25:45,586 --> 00:25:47,921
I agree, you'd improve
our neighborhood for sure

402
00:25:48,005 --> 00:25:49,256
if you were our assemblywoman.

403
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:50,174
That's true.

404
00:25:51,008 --> 00:25:54,678
Quite a lot of people
are trying to sell their homes.

405
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:57,598
It's because of all these explosions.

406
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:58,515
I know.

407
00:25:58,599 --> 00:26:00,225
I'm anxious, too.

408
00:26:01,143 --> 00:26:02,186
Right.

409
00:26:03,062 --> 00:26:04,563
Gosh, I'd better pack these.

410
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:06,148
No, we can do it.

411
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:07,775
- You're still here?
- Hey, Su-il.

412
00:26:07,858 --> 00:26:09,401
- Hello.
- Hey.

413
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:11,737
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

414
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,405
- Enjoy these, okay?
- Okay.

415
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:14,990
- Take care.
- Thanks so much.

416
00:26:15,074 --> 00:26:16,283
Don't do anything.

417
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:18,160
- Can you carry it?
- I can.

418
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:19,411
- Bye, then.
- Bye.

419
00:26:19,495 --> 00:26:21,246
- Take good care of her.
- You can stay.

420
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:22,539
No, we chatted enough.

421
00:26:22,623 --> 00:26:23,457
Bye.

422
00:26:24,792 --> 00:26:25,834
Go home and rest.

423
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:27,336
You're still injured.

424
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:29,963
Right, I'm going home
to put these in the fridge.

425
00:26:30,047 --> 00:26:31,298
- Okay.
- See you.

426
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:32,925
- Okay, just trust me.
- Okay.

427
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:33,967
I'll be back.

428
00:26:34,051 --> 00:26:35,219
- Will you?
- Yeah.

429
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:37,262
Okay, rest up first.

430
00:26:37,346 --> 00:26:38,514
Okay.

431
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:40,349
- She could just rest.
- I'll take these, please.

432
00:26:41,058 --> 00:26:42,601
Hi, you come here often.

433
00:26:44,353 --> 00:26:46,855
You want the points, right?

434
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:48,857
Yeah, on my manager's account.

435
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:52,111
Why do you always
save the points on his account?

436
00:26:52,194 --> 00:26:53,946
You can use the points like real money.

437
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:56,323
Stop doing that for your manager.

438
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:57,783
Make your own account.

439
00:26:57,866 --> 00:26:58,909
What?

440
00:26:59,201 --> 00:27:02,454
You turned me away last time
because I had no ID on me.

441
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:04,373
Who did that? Me?

442
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:05,791
Yeah.

443
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:08,919
I did no such thing.

444
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:10,420
What's your number?

445
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:12,214
- It's 010.
- Okay, 010.

446
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:13,966
Then, 0191.

447
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:15,008
Okay, 0191.

448
00:27:15,092 --> 00:27:16,135
And 2406.

449
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:17,636
Nice number.

450
00:27:19,096 --> 00:27:19,930
All done.

451
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:51,044
This is amazing!

452
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:54,840
It's curry kimchi stew.

453
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:58,260
The famous curry kimchi stew?

454
00:27:58,886 --> 00:28:00,429
Thank you so much.

455
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:02,139
Thank you.

456
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:03,682
My gosh.

457
00:28:07,436 --> 00:28:08,562
It's incredible.

458
00:28:09,146 --> 00:28:10,522
Do you like it?

459
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:13,609
No wonder Kang raves about the rice.

460
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:17,779
Each grain is so plump
and has the perfect chew.

461
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:19,156
It's delicious.

462
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:21,033
Right? Isn't the rice so good?

463
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:23,702
It's special rice from my mother-in-law.

464
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:27,998
Wow, Kang really got lucky with you.

465
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:31,501
I'll pack you some food later.

466
00:28:31,585 --> 00:28:33,337
Thank you, Mi-gyeong.

467
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,547
That's Ms. Hwang for you, little bro.

468
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:38,050
Call me whatever you want.

469
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:39,468
Thanks, Mi-gyeong.

470
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,553
- Ms. Hwang.
- Mi-gyeong.

471
00:28:43,472 --> 00:28:45,057
- Uncle.
- Yeah?

472
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:46,808
Does your hand hurt a lot?

473
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:49,102
My hand?

474
00:28:49,895 --> 00:28:51,146
Oh, this?

475
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:54,274
Just a bit.

476
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:58,028
What is it?

477
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:07,037
Wow, that's magical.

478
00:29:07,371 --> 00:29:09,122
It doesn't hurt at all anymore.

479
00:29:09,206 --> 00:29:10,290
- Right?
- Yeah.

480
00:29:10,374 --> 00:29:13,502
I wished for it to stop hurting
when I blew on it.

481
00:29:14,628 --> 00:29:16,004
It won't hurt anymore.

482
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:18,674
No wonder it's totally fine now.

483
00:29:19,967 --> 00:29:22,052
- Thank you, Do-yeon.
- You're welcome.

484
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:37,734
Being here makes me want to get married.

485
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:42,030
- You jealous?
- Yeah.

486
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:44,783
Just stick to dating.

487
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,286
Why? But you got married.

488
00:29:47,369 --> 00:29:48,662
It's for your own good.

489
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:53,000
Of course, getting married
is the best thing ever!

490
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:54,334
Why don't you want to get married?

491
00:29:54,418 --> 00:29:55,669
You should.

492
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:58,213
- Get married, okay?
- Yeah, sure.

493
00:29:58,297 --> 00:29:59,381
Hey, Do-yeon.

494
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:01,091
- Uncle.
- Yeah?

495
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:04,011
I have something to show you.

496
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:05,429
What is it?

497
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:08,765
It's Pinky that I made in class.

498
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:11,310
- Come here.
- Okay.

499
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:12,436
Do-yeon.

500
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:14,479
Stop bothering him. His wrist hurts.

501
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:17,482
Yeah, let's brush your teeth now.

502
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:18,400
All right.

503
00:30:18,984 --> 00:30:21,111
Promise to show me next time, okay?

504
00:30:21,403 --> 00:30:22,404
Pinky promise.

505
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:23,530
Promise.

506
00:30:27,743 --> 00:30:29,161
Give me a hug before you go.

507
00:30:31,872 --> 00:30:33,999
Your family's amazing.

508
00:30:35,709 --> 00:30:37,002
Just stick to dating.

509
00:30:39,296 --> 00:30:40,839
Would that be better?

510
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:51,892
You're sleeping
with the Pinky light on today?

511
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:52,809
Yeah.

512
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:54,895
Goodnight, Pinky.

513
00:30:57,314 --> 00:30:58,940
"Goodnight, little sis."

514
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:01,610
Goodnight, Mom.

515
00:31:02,736 --> 00:31:04,946
- Goodnight, Do-yeon.
- Goodnight.

516
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:56,581
Hurry, Do-yeon.

517
00:31:56,665 --> 00:31:58,333
I'll be late for work.

518
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:00,335
Okay, Dad.

519
00:32:03,505 --> 00:32:05,340
Bye, Dad! Have a good day!

520
00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:06,925
Okay, have fun, Do-yeon.

521
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:07,926
See you later!

522
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:10,470
- Bye, Dad!
- Bye.

523
00:32:16,435 --> 00:32:17,727
Good morning, Do-yeon.

524
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:19,688
Hello.

525
00:32:30,574 --> 00:32:31,658
Hey, Kang.

526
00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:33,994
Are you off to work?

527
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:35,537
Yeah, are you out for delivery?

528
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,205
That's a lot of instant noodle cups.

529
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:39,249
You know, people should have
a proper breakfast,

530
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:40,917
not instant noodles.

531
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:44,212
There's this researcher
from Pakistan named Ali.

532
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:46,256
You know the victim of the ATM incident?

533
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:47,174
He's his friend.

534
00:32:47,257 --> 00:32:48,383
I feel so bad for him.

535
00:32:49,176 --> 00:32:50,469
The ATM victim's friend?

536
00:32:51,178 --> 00:32:52,596
Yeah, what was his name?

537
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:55,098
Rashod?

538
00:32:55,182 --> 00:32:56,975
Rasheet?

539
00:32:57,267 --> 00:32:58,101
Something like that.

540
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:00,645
There we go.

541
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:04,858
- Hey, Ali.
- Hello.

542
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:07,235
This is Choi Kang.

543
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:09,237
You know, Rashi...

544
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:10,155
Rashid.

545
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:13,158
Yeah, he witnessed the ATM explosion.

546
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:19,414
Firstly, may your friend rest in peace.

547
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:23,043
He can't understand that.
Use easier words.

548
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:23,960
Hey,

549
00:33:24,044 --> 00:33:25,921
I'm certified in Korean Level 2

550
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,255
and know all the Chinese characters.

551
00:33:27,923 --> 00:33:28,840
You can use harder words.

552
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:32,093
I wanted to ask you something.

553
00:33:32,177 --> 00:33:33,762
Were you close with Rashid?

554
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:37,140
Yeah, we'd been friends since childhood.

555
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:40,143
But we'd drifted apart in Korea.

556
00:33:41,895 --> 00:33:44,356
I hate to tell you this so late,

557
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:47,400
but that explosion
wasn't caused by butane gas.

558
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:50,820
You'd need a C-4 or Semtex
for an explosion that big.

559
00:33:50,904 --> 00:33:52,489
SEMTEX: PLASTIC EXPLOSIVES
DEVELOPED IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA

560
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:54,616
- You know what Semtex is?
- Of course.

561
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:57,410
My lab works on
detecting explosive materials

562
00:33:57,494 --> 00:33:58,870
using quantum sensors.

563
00:33:59,955 --> 00:34:02,374
May I ask why you two drifted apart?

564
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:04,125
Well...

565
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:06,294
We started drifting apart

566
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:08,046
when he joined a group called
"Recreation."

567
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:10,173
Recreation? Like, parties?

568
00:34:10,507 --> 00:34:11,341
No.

569
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:15,220
Only foreigners residing in Korea
with an invitation can join.

570
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:18,723
But they can get pesky, so I didn't join.

571
00:34:18,807 --> 00:34:22,519
Did Rashid ever talk about Sullivan?

572
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:27,399
He did mention that
Sullivan sponsored the group.

573
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:29,943
Hold on. Sullivan?

574
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:31,319
The Sullivan?

575
00:34:32,362 --> 00:34:33,989
- Yeah.
- Yes.

576
00:34:35,282 --> 00:34:36,283
Hold on.

577
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:45,750
This belonged to Rashid.

578
00:34:45,834 --> 00:34:47,669
This guy is Sullivan, right?

579
00:34:48,962 --> 00:34:51,089
Yeah, that's him, Sullivan.

580
00:34:52,007 --> 00:34:54,968
Wait, that's Ms. Olivia.

581
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:57,721
Olivia.

582
00:34:57,804 --> 00:34:59,681
She's one of the leaders in the group.

583
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,182
But she was so pesky.

584
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:12,861
I won't let you off with a warning

585
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:14,779
if you meddle with my plans again.

586
00:35:14,863 --> 00:35:15,905
Think of your daughter.

587
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:18,575
Thank you.

588
00:35:19,409 --> 00:35:21,119
May I borrow this photo?

589
00:35:21,328 --> 00:35:23,246
Sure, you can take it.

590
00:35:23,872 --> 00:35:25,707
- I have to get going.
- Okay.

591
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:28,126
- Have a good day.
- See you.

592
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,213
KIYUN DREAM KINDERGARTEN

593
00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:34,299
What can I help you with, Mr. Choi?

594
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:36,259
May I speak to Ms. Olivia?

595
00:35:36,343 --> 00:35:38,637
Ms. Olivia is on holiday from today.

596
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:39,721
What is this about?

597
00:35:43,016 --> 00:35:44,017
Daddy!

598
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:46,353
Hey, Do-yeon.

599
00:35:46,603 --> 00:35:48,021
Why are you here, Dad?

600
00:35:48,772 --> 00:35:50,482
I just needed to talk to your teacher.

601
00:35:50,899 --> 00:35:51,983
What are you up to?

602
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:53,610
I'm going to the playroom.

603
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:55,403
Bye, then. I'll see you later!

604
00:35:55,487 --> 00:35:57,280
- Okay, see you later.
- Bye.

605
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:00,867
All right, thank you.

606
00:36:04,454 --> 00:36:05,789
Unit 514, right?

607
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:09,334
<i>Yes, I found an express order</i>
<i>that was made to this unit.</i>

608
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:10,335
Got it.

609
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,359
Who are you?

610
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:36,653
Oh, I'm...

611
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:39,781
This is where Ms. Olivia lives, right?

612
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:42,283
Oh, the foreigner?

613
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:43,618
She moved out yesterday.

614
00:36:45,495 --> 00:36:46,538
I see.

615
00:36:48,081 --> 00:36:49,165
Thank you.

616
00:36:51,418 --> 00:36:54,087
HARDWARE DREAM TREE STATIONERY

617
00:36:54,671 --> 00:36:56,089
How cute.

618
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:58,007
My kid made it in class,

619
00:36:58,091 --> 00:37:00,427
but it's broken and won't turn on.

620
00:37:02,512 --> 00:37:04,806
I'll need to open it up and check.

621
00:37:05,515 --> 00:37:06,933
Will you be okay?

622
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:10,353
My fingers are fine.

623
00:37:10,437 --> 00:37:11,813
- I'll take a look tonight.
- Okay.

624
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:13,440
- I'll come back tomorrow.
- Okay.

625
00:37:17,444 --> 00:37:19,446
Let's see what's wrong.

626
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:55,356
Hold on.

627
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:34,145
- Hey.
<i>- Kang, you were right.</i>

628
00:38:35,063 --> 00:38:36,147
There's another bomb.

629
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:38,983
Another one? Where?

630
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:40,360
<i>Meet me at the bunker.</i>

631
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:41,736
<i>I'll head there, too.</i>

632
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:54,707
<i>Hey.</i>

633
00:38:54,791 --> 00:38:56,042
Mi-gyeong.

634
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:58,461
Take Do-yeon
and go to your mother's house right now.

635
00:38:58,545 --> 00:39:00,338
<i>Why? What is it this time?</i>

636
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:01,756
Just go, okay?

637
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,175
Call me when you get there.

638
00:39:09,931 --> 00:39:12,016
It's an altered C-4

639
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,518
with a receiver.

640
00:39:14,811 --> 00:39:17,605
Kids made these in class?

641
00:39:17,689 --> 00:39:20,942
Why would you bring a bomb here?

642
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:22,652
Take it out right now!

643
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:25,446
All signals are blocked here,
so it's fine.

644
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:26,531
Don't give me that.

645
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,908
You said this was a safe shelter.

646
00:39:28,992 --> 00:39:30,326
Nam-yeon!

647
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:32,787
Literally everyone's been coming in here.

648
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:33,705
How is it safe?

649
00:39:34,289 --> 00:39:36,165
Ms. Lee, can we just kick her out?

650
00:39:36,249 --> 00:39:37,375
She's too loud.

651
00:39:38,835 --> 00:39:41,004
I can't. It was an order from above.

652
00:39:42,964 --> 00:39:44,382
My gosh.

653
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:47,927
"Kang Ra-on"?

654
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:50,179
What is it?

655
00:39:50,263 --> 00:39:51,639
He's Do-yeon's classmate.

656
00:39:57,145 --> 00:39:59,814
Kang, does Do-yeon have one of these?

657
00:40:09,032 --> 00:40:10,825
Please don't forget to send us photos.

658
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:12,911
We'll add them to the kids' albums.

659
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:20,209
Yes.

660
00:40:20,293 --> 00:40:21,961
Every kid took one home.

661
00:40:22,045 --> 00:40:23,129
Olivia was behind it.

662
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:26,799
So Ms. Olivia is working with Sullivan?

663
00:40:28,718 --> 00:40:29,594
I think so.

664
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:32,931
She didn't come into work today

665
00:40:33,014 --> 00:40:34,015
and moved out of her place.

666
00:40:35,183 --> 00:40:37,226
That's the guy from the park, isn't he?

667
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,519
Yes, it is.

668
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:41,189
You're kidding me.

669
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:43,316
So she had the kids make bombs?

670
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,360
How many do you think there are?

671
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:48,446
There are 55, excluding this.

672
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:49,822
One is at my house.

673
00:40:50,615 --> 00:40:54,369
I know where most of them live,
so I'll look into this.

674
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:55,370
Perfect.

675
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:58,039
Let's disperse and retrieve them all.

676
00:40:58,122 --> 00:40:59,916
- Okay, let's go.
- Come on.

677
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:01,960
Tell the Vice Minister. It's an emergency.

678
00:41:02,043 --> 00:41:03,044
- Okay.
- Hurry.

679
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:05,880
Nam-yeon, you can't leave me alone.

680
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:07,590
I'm suffering from trauma.

681
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:10,301
This is the safest place you can be,

682
00:41:10,385 --> 00:41:12,387
so just shut it!

683
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:23,022
Why are you out again?

684
00:41:23,106 --> 00:41:25,024
Get back in there and defuse the bombs.

685
00:41:25,108 --> 00:41:27,318
They haven't brought any to me yet.

686
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:30,780
Hey, where's Do-yeon?

687
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:33,199
At kindergarten.

688
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:36,077
I told Mi-gyeong to take Do-yeon
and go to her mother's house.

689
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,328
Good thinking.

690
00:41:37,787 --> 00:41:39,831
Who are you waiting for, anyway?

691
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:43,543
There they are.

692
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:13,781
Sir.

693
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:15,158
Hey.

694
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:20,079
Sir.

695
00:42:20,163 --> 00:42:22,123
- It's been a while, sir!
- It's been a while, sir!

696
00:42:22,457 --> 00:42:23,291
Hey, guys.

697
00:42:27,003 --> 00:42:29,338
We did as you told us
and dressed as friendly as possible.

698
00:42:30,715 --> 00:42:31,674
Good job.

699
00:42:32,467 --> 00:42:33,384
Sir.

700
00:42:33,468 --> 00:42:35,595
Retrieve all the clay toys
made by the kids.

701
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:38,931
Everyone will hand them over
if you say they've found something toxic.

702
00:42:39,015 --> 00:42:40,058
Yes, sir.

703
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:41,809
What if they refuse?

704
00:42:41,893 --> 00:42:44,479
Do whatever it takes
and bring all of them here immediately.

705
00:42:44,896 --> 00:42:45,772
Yes, sir.

706
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:49,275
We'll drop you off at different addresses.

707
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:50,318
Retrieve the clay toys.

708
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:52,111
Be kind and polite.

709
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,154
Get to work!

710
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:54,655
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

711
00:43:10,755 --> 00:43:11,839
Can I help you?

712
00:43:11,923 --> 00:43:13,216
Hello, ma'am.

713
00:43:14,467 --> 00:43:15,468
Thank you, ma'am.

714
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:21,015
I'm so sorry.

715
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:22,642
It's fine.

716
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:25,186
Su-a, I promise to bring it back

717
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:28,606
once I make it all better, okay?

718
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:29,524
- Okay.
- Promise.

719
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:30,525
Promise.

720
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:49,836
Nam-yeon?

721
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:51,796
- Here.
- Thank you.

722
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:53,214
I'll call you later.

723
00:44:00,972 --> 00:44:02,890
Sorry for the surprise visit.

724
00:44:02,974 --> 00:44:05,393
But this is quite urgent.

725
00:44:08,604 --> 00:44:09,522
Okay.

726
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:26,330
We've retrieved 13 so far.

727
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:33,629
Keep me updated.

728
00:44:39,844 --> 00:44:40,678
Yes.

729
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:43,556
<i>The VIP is on hold on line one.</i>

730
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:52,315
Lee Geun-cheol speaking.

731
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:32,063
Hurry, Do-yeon.

732
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:33,898
I'll be late for work.

733
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:35,900
Okay, Dad.

734
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:39,320
CHOI DO-YEON

735
00:45:59,966 --> 00:46:01,217
You bastard.

736
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:13,312
Stop looking for the bombs.

737
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:15,189
I'll blow them all up

738
00:46:15,273 --> 00:46:17,650
if you retrieve one more
from this point on.

739
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:21,529
Don't call the cops or run away.

740
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:23,322
Don't do a thing.

741
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:25,491
What is it that you want?

742
00:46:25,908 --> 00:46:27,285
Is this your revenge?

743
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:29,829
Revenge?

744
00:46:43,259 --> 00:46:45,052
Call your friends.

745
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:55,187
Lee Su-jin speaking.

746
00:46:58,482 --> 00:46:59,734
It's Mr. Choi.

747
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:00,735
Okay.

748
00:47:01,861 --> 00:47:03,696
What now? I'm busy.

749
00:47:03,988 --> 00:47:05,114
Stop.

750
00:47:05,448 --> 00:47:06,574
Stop what?

751
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:10,036
Stop defusing the bombs?

752
00:47:12,538 --> 00:47:13,372
What?

753
00:47:18,711 --> 00:47:19,920
What's going on?

754
00:47:20,004 --> 00:47:23,507
Sullivan will blow everything up
if we retrieve more bombs.

755
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:24,759
What?

756
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:04,340
Sullivan knows we're retrieving the bombs.

757
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:07,676
<i>He'll blow up the rest</i>
<i>if we retrieve more.</i>

758
00:48:08,636 --> 00:48:09,970
I heard.

759
00:48:10,054 --> 00:48:12,098
We'll need to find another way.

760
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:16,685
Hello? Is something wrong?

761
00:48:17,436 --> 00:48:18,687
<i>I've been ordered</i>

762
00:48:18,771 --> 00:48:21,357
<i>only to handle the aftermath.</i>

763
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:22,274
What?

764
00:48:25,653 --> 00:48:28,447
They're saying it'll get complicated
if it goes diplomatic.

765
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:30,282
<i>Are you kidding me?</i>

766
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:34,036
What's the point of handling the aftermath
of a bomb threat?

767
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:36,914
In any case,
I can't officially do anything.

768
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:41,252
But I'll give you all the equipment
and information you need.

769
00:48:46,799 --> 00:48:49,385
GENERAL HWANG

770
00:48:50,136 --> 00:48:51,053
Okay.

771
00:48:53,556 --> 00:48:54,765
Are you at the kindergarten?

772
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:56,267
Did you get Do-yeon?

773
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:57,685
<i>I can't find...</i>

774
00:48:58,436 --> 00:48:59,728
Do-yeon.

775
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:02,231
What do you mean?

776
00:49:02,314 --> 00:49:04,483
I said hi to her at kindergarten earlier.

777
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:06,777
<i>What do I do?</i>

778
00:49:07,027 --> 00:49:08,654
I can't find her anywhere.

779
00:49:10,322 --> 00:49:11,157
I'll be right over.

780
00:49:24,462 --> 00:49:26,130
It's someone Do-yeon knows.

781
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:27,423
Do-yeon...

782
00:49:27,506 --> 00:49:30,843
Could we check the security footage
facing the road?

783
00:49:30,926 --> 00:49:32,011
Oh, yes.

784
00:49:38,601 --> 00:49:39,435
Olivia.

785
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:43,606
Isn't she Ms. Olivia?

786
00:49:43,898 --> 00:49:47,359
What is she doing there?

787
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:56,827
Honey.

788
00:49:57,620 --> 00:49:58,537
Honey.

789
00:49:58,621 --> 00:49:59,622
Kang.

790
00:50:01,207 --> 00:50:02,291
Are you okay?

791
00:50:07,713 --> 00:50:08,923
Mi-gyeong...

792
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:15,429
It'll be okay.

793
00:50:16,138 --> 00:50:17,515
She'll be fine.

794
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:19,767
I promise

795
00:50:20,976 --> 00:50:22,144
to bring Do-yeon back.

796
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:25,856
Bring her back.

797
00:50:55,553 --> 00:50:57,221
NEW MESSAGE

798
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:07,273
<i>The electricity usage at Novus Logistics</i>
<i>is unusually high.</i>

799
00:51:18,784 --> 00:51:22,288
I get that his daughter died unfairly,

800
00:51:22,371 --> 00:51:24,623
but why is he trying to set off bombs
on other kids?

801
00:51:24,707 --> 00:51:26,834
That's exactly what I mean!

802
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:29,587
Why is this bastard doing this to kids?

803
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:31,797
Ridiculous!

804
00:51:32,047 --> 00:51:34,300
If we can't retrieve them,

805
00:51:34,383 --> 00:51:35,843
how about we block off the signals?

806
00:51:36,343 --> 00:51:37,177
What?

807
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:39,805
The bombs are remote-controlled,

808
00:51:39,888 --> 00:51:41,765
so what if we block off the signals?

809
00:51:42,266 --> 00:51:43,267
You're a genius.

810
00:51:44,727 --> 00:51:46,437
All right, let's not waste time

811
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,939
and focus on how we can stop these bombs.

812
00:51:49,148 --> 00:51:51,734
For example, we can block the signal by--

813
00:51:51,817 --> 00:51:53,527
- Emergency!
- What's wrong?

814
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:56,488
Do-yeon's gone.

815
00:51:56,739 --> 00:51:57,823
- What?
- What?

816
00:51:57,906 --> 00:51:59,158
What are you talking about?

817
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:02,536
What do you mean Do-yeon's gone?

818
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:04,496
Start making sense.

819
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:05,998
This bastard.

820
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:07,958
Unbelievable.

821
00:52:11,629 --> 00:52:12,546
Hey, Kang.

822
00:52:13,297 --> 00:52:14,506
<i>Where are you?</i>

823
00:52:15,049 --> 00:52:15,924
<i>Where's Do-yeon?</i>

824
00:52:17,926 --> 00:52:19,136
I'm on my way.

825
00:52:23,557 --> 00:52:24,391
Hey.

826
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:26,310
You listen to me.

827
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:28,187
We'll do everything we can

828
00:52:29,688 --> 00:52:31,065
to stop the bombs.

829
00:52:34,193 --> 00:52:35,361
So you just focus

830
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:37,237
<i>on bringing Do-yeon back.</i>

831
00:52:38,238 --> 00:52:39,365
Thank you.

832
00:52:40,366 --> 00:52:41,617
I'm counting on you.

833
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:42,534
<i>Yeah.</i>

834
00:52:51,418 --> 00:52:54,713
I don't think it's a good idea
to let Mr. Choi go alone.

835
00:52:55,339 --> 00:52:56,965
Shouldn't we look for Do-yeon first?

836
00:52:57,049 --> 00:52:58,717
Hey, Nam-yeon, where's Min-seo?

837
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:01,303
I checked her social media.
She's at the store.

838
00:53:01,387 --> 00:53:05,599
But she's very mad
that she's not at the birthday party.

839
00:53:07,893 --> 00:53:08,936
Here it is.

840
00:53:11,105 --> 00:53:11,939
Let's see.

841
00:53:16,235 --> 00:53:18,028
Leave it to Kang to find Do-yeon.

842
00:53:18,362 --> 00:53:19,988
Let's work on the bombs.

843
00:53:20,948 --> 00:53:23,534
We can stop them with this.

844
00:53:31,250 --> 00:53:33,877
We didn't start this battle.

845
00:53:34,670 --> 00:53:37,381
But it's on us to end it.

846
00:53:38,090 --> 00:53:39,383
Do not fear death.

847
00:53:39,675 --> 00:53:41,218
What we must fear is

848
00:53:41,719 --> 00:53:42,678
not doing anything--

849
00:53:42,761 --> 00:53:43,595
That's enough.

850
00:53:44,722 --> 00:53:46,140
- And just--
- Everyone knows the plan?

851
00:53:46,849 --> 00:53:47,933
Don't worry, Ms. Jung.

852
00:53:49,309 --> 00:53:50,352
Keep us updated.

853
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:52,187
Don't worry, Nam-yeon.

854
00:53:53,105 --> 00:53:56,191
Nam-yeon,
I'll remember everything about you.

855
00:53:56,442 --> 00:53:57,359
I'm not going to die.

856
00:53:57,651 --> 00:53:59,486
You go and do your part, okay?

857
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:00,779
Okay.

858
00:54:00,863 --> 00:54:02,114
What are you doing?

859
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:03,157
Attention!

860
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:04,616
Let's go and end this.

861
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:06,618
- Let's go!
- Bring it on!

862
00:54:07,786 --> 00:54:08,704
Yeah!

863
00:54:45,449 --> 00:54:47,242
Oh? It's Dad!

864
00:54:47,993 --> 00:54:49,369
Dad!

865
00:54:52,831 --> 00:54:55,083
Are you not feeling well?

866
00:55:09,264 --> 00:55:11,809
Promise to protect me, okay?

867
00:55:11,892 --> 00:55:14,353
Bye, then.

868
00:55:14,436 --> 00:55:15,521
I'll see you later!

869
00:56:13,537 --> 00:56:16,290
Do-yeon!

870
00:56:19,543 --> 00:56:20,460
Do-yeon!

871
00:56:22,254 --> 00:56:23,297
Do-yeon!

872
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:26,508
Choi Do-yeon!

873
00:56:37,352 --> 00:56:38,395
Do-yeon.

874
00:56:48,155 --> 00:56:49,072
Do-yeon!

875
00:56:51,033 --> 00:56:52,075
Do-yeon!

876
00:56:56,622 --> 00:56:57,539
Do-yeon!

877
00:57:01,001 --> 00:57:01,919
Do-yeon!

878
00:57:04,546 --> 00:57:05,464
Do-yeon!

879
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:17,225
Choi Do-yeon!

880
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:56,056
Do-yeon...

881
00:57:59,851 --> 00:58:01,395
Do-yeon!

882
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:16,785
Do-yeon...

883
00:58:31,091 --> 00:58:32,592
- Dad.
- Yeah?

884
00:58:32,676 --> 00:58:35,178
If I meet a bad adult,
I'll scare them with my whistle.

885
00:58:35,262 --> 00:58:38,181
Yes, make their ears bleed.

886
00:58:38,265 --> 00:58:39,099
Okay.

887
00:58:55,449 --> 00:58:56,450
Do-yeon...

888
00:58:59,995 --> 00:59:00,996
Do-yeon!

889
00:59:02,247 --> 00:59:05,167
HEROES NEXT DOOR

890
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:46,833
<i>Moving underground.</i>

891
00:59:47,834 --> 00:59:48,835
<i>Everyone ready?</i>

892
00:59:48,919 --> 00:59:50,337
<i>Let's do this in one go.</i>

893
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:52,255
Nam-yeon's station hasn't gone off!

894
00:59:52,339 --> 00:59:53,590
This isn't working!

895
00:59:53,673 --> 00:59:54,758
<i>You wanted to make a deal.</i>

896
00:59:54,841 --> 00:59:56,843
<i>You never change, do you?</i>

897
00:59:56,927 --> 00:59:57,928
<i>Retrieve the bombs.</i>

898
00:59:58,011 --> 00:59:58,887
You still have time.

899
00:59:58,970 --> 01:00:01,014
<i>If you press that, Do-yeon will live,</i>

900
01:00:01,098 --> 01:00:02,682
but all your neighbors will die.

901
01:00:02,766 --> 01:00:04,643
<i>They're just innocent people.</i>

902
01:00:05,352 --> 01:00:06,394
Ms. Lee!

903
01:00:06,686 --> 01:00:08,230
<i>Who is Kang, seriously?</i>

904
01:00:08,313 --> 01:00:09,731
He's Changri-dong's hero.

905
01:00:10,524 --> 01:00:12,109
<i>It's all over now.</i>
