THIS DRAMA IS A WORK OF FICTION.
ALL CHARACTERS, PROFESSIONS, PLACES,

00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:43,919
COMPANIES, ORGANIZATIONS,
ETHNIC GROUPS AND EVENTS ARE NOT REAL.

00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:44,962
ALL CHILD AND ANIMAL SCENES WERE FILMED
SAFELY UNDER EXPERT SUPERVISION.

00:00:50,926 --> 00:00:52,678
- Here he comes.
- He's here!

6
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:54,680
- He's out!
- Please say something!

7
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:56,098
Please tell us what's going on.

NANO POWER BUTANE GAS

9
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,392
Was it really a butane gas explosion?

10
00:00:58,934 --> 00:01:00,519
Was it really butane gas?

11
00:01:01,937 --> 00:01:04,064
Why the sudden rush
with the investigation?

12
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:05,357
Please say something!

13
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:07,109
Please!

14
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:09,820
<i>If it led to some hair burning</i>
<i>or a dining table blowing up,</i>

15
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:11,405
then it would've made sense.

NANO POWER BUTANE GAS RESEARCHER

17
00:01:12,531 --> 00:01:15,200
But butane gas blowing up
a whole ATM booth?

18
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,536
You've got to be kidding me.

19
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:21,373
Why would North Korea even need to bother
experimenting with missiles, then?

20
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:22,874
They should just use our butane gas!

21
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:26,461
HARDWARE DREAM TREE STATIONERY
When this blew up,

22
00:01:26,545 --> 00:01:28,714
I was standing right here.

23
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:32,217
The only reason I survived
was because I ducked so quickly.

24
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:35,178
If I were even slightly slower,
I could've died.

25
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:37,806
MAMMOSEU MART DELIVERY MAN
Someone died in the ATM booth overnight,

26
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:42,060
yet new ATM machines were set up
by the next morning.

27
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:45,272
Is anyone really that rushed for cash?
Somebody just died.

28
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:46,773
That's wrong.

29
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,568
Just a few days after the ATM explosion,

30
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:52,029
another explosion took place in Kiyun-si.

31
00:01:52,738 --> 00:01:56,283
At the bus terminal behind me,

32
00:01:57,075 --> 00:02:00,078
a bus exploded, killing two civilians.

33
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:05,000
So why hasn't the government
announced anything yet?

34
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:06,752
BUS DRIVER OF THE EXPLODED BUS
It just exploded.

35
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:09,546
The bus wasn't even burning
or smoking beforehand.

36
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:10,922
It just blew up.

37

MAMMOSEU MART OWNER

38
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:13,258
<i>It was around 7 a.m.</i>

39
00:02:13,342 --> 00:02:14,760
- It's Mom.
- It's your mom.

40
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:15,677
- Quiet.
- It's Mom.

41
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:17,054
She looks nice and scary.

42
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:20,057
The commander's lead car
was at the bus terminal.

43
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:23,894
Are you sure you saw it?
And how did you know?

44
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,563
Well, it was a Retona.

45
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:30,651
<i>Anyway, the traffic was so bad</i>
<i>that my car was barely moving.</i>

46
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:34,321
<i>But the police and the firefighters</i>
<i>were just standing guard</i>

47
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:36,281
<i>while soldiers were cleaning up the site.</i>

48
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:39,493
<i>We send our sons to the military</i>
<i>to protect the nation,</i>

49
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:41,745
<i>not to clean up some random neighborhood.</i>

50
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:45,123
<i>If they were there for civilian support,</i>
<i>they should've helped the people.</i>

MAGNIFYING MEDIA
<i>Experts and witnesses</i>

52
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:50,712
<i>suspect these explosions</i>
<i>to have been bombs instead of butane gas.</i>

53
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:53,465
<i>The soldiers at the site.</i>

54
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:56,927
<i>Most importantly, the government seems</i>
<i>too eager to rush to close this case.</i>

55
00:02:58,095 --> 00:03:00,889
<i>The series of explosions in Kiyun-si</i>
<i>is full of questions.</i>

56
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:03,266
<i>What is true,</i>

57
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:06,311
<i>and what is the government hiding?</i>

58
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:13,944
EPISODE 4: WHAT BRINGS YOU TO OUR TOWN?

59
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:19,783
Did you watch the clip?

60
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,327
Who uploaded that?

61
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:26,957
You idiot. I told you
to stop these clips from circulating!

62
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:30,627
Forget it.

63
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:36,383
Don't let anyone approach Kiyun-si
until we find out what's going on.

64
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:48,061
It wasn't the 88th Transportation Brigade?

65
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:52,357
What about the 900th Unit
or the Logistic Support Group?

66
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:58,488
What do you mean, "standby squad"?

67
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:00,615
There are witnesses
who saw military vehicles.

68
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:03,326
And you're seriously saying
no military units were deployed?

69
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:05,162
Keep searching.

70
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,752
These bastards are messing with me.

71
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:14,129
Maybe they really don't know
what's going on, either.

72
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,131
That's an even bigger issue.

73
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:24,598
Look into what those four talked about.

74
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:28,477
It seems to have something to do
with the explosions in Kiyun-si.

75
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,103
Yes, sir.

76
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:33,190
- This is just between us.
- Understood, sir.

00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:20,111
RESIDENCE: KIYUN-SI, GANGWON-DO

81
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:28,078
So in summary,

82
00:05:28,537 --> 00:05:31,039
you were checking if he was a spy
or from the National Intelligence Service.

83
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:34,417
Then you saw those stuffed bunnies
and found this laptop?

84
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:35,335
Yes.

85
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:38,922
And the man who died in the ATM explosion
and the man from the building are a team.

86
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,508
And you're saying
the bus terminal explosion is related too?

87
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:43,885
Yes, this is the stuffed bunny.

88
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:48,139
That was a great summary.
No wonder you're a journalist.

89
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:51,726
But how did you take down
that armed agent?

90
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:53,603
Well...

91
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:58,316
I can throw some spicy punches!

92
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:00,986
SPECIAL MARTIAL ARTS

93
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:03,613
I also served in the HID.

94
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:05,115
You know that unit, right?

95
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,366
You know, from that movie.

96
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:10,871
"I'll rip out your gold teeth

97
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:13,748
and tear you apart."

98
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:25,844
And I can run really fast.

99
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:29,264
So we fought that guy

100
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:31,016
while he ran off.

101
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:32,434
That's right!

102
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:37,063
So why are you telling me all this?

103
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:42,444
I want to uncover the truth
behind Myeong-o's death.

104
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:46,781
People in our neighborhood are dying.
We need to do something.

105
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:48,116
Same here.

106
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:52,412
I wonder if I caused all this trouble
by stealing this laptop.

107
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:54,331
Hey, how is that your fault?

108
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,307
THEY'RE LISTENING, SHUSH

109
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:13,892
But the power is off--

110
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:15,727
It's off, though.

111
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,317
THAT LAPTOP CAN STILL LISTEN IN

112
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:25,695
EVEN WHEN IT'S OFF

113
00:07:27,656 --> 00:07:28,865
IF THEY CAN TAP US,
THEY CAN TRACK OUR LOCATION

114
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,381
WHAT IF WE USE IT AGAINST THEM?

115
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,309
We need to clone the original laptop!

116
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:59,396
- We pull the data with forensics...
- And secure evidence!

117
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,190
And since they can track our location
using the laptop...

118
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:04,943
- We'll purposely expose our location...
- To catch the culprit!

119
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:13,910
Then we need to start
with the CMOS battery first!

120
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:16,746
Hey, I can take care of that!

121
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:19,416
Okay, that's all for today! Dismissed!

122
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:22,085
Hold up! What are you going to do?

123
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:25,380
Go to work! I have a job!

124
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:27,549
Okay, dismissed!

125
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:34,681
My goodness, that's intense.

126
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,057
That's his car.

127
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:38,309
- Amazing.
- Will you look at that?

128
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:40,395
Your car is incredible!

129
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:42,939
That's neat.

130
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:44,441
Can I get a ride?

131
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:49,863
Why are they all coming out of there?

132
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:51,698
Without me?

133

COMPUTER FORENSIC ANALYSIS

135
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:04,461
It's going to take forever
on this computer.

136
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:36,910
Since chip bags are made of
polypropylene and aluminum,

137
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:38,912
they can block out electric signals,

138
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:42,707
magnetic field signals,
and even telecommunication signals.

139
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:45,293
See how dangerous the packaging is?

140
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:47,670
This is why moms don't let kids eat chips.

141
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:50,465
Chips are delicious, but dangerous.

142
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:53,510
- That has nothing to do--
- Of course not.

143
00:09:53,885 --> 00:09:54,719
It's just a joke.

144
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,858
- Officer Park! Someone is dying!
- What?

145
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:11,402
- Someone's dying!
- Where?

146
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:13,154
Me.

147
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:14,948
I'm so low on sugar
that I feel like dying.

148
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,283
Man, you scared me!

149
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:18,868
Buy me a cup of coffee.

150
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:27,252
There are cafes all around,
yet you come to the police station?

151
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:30,421
Hey, you can't get
vending machine coffee at cafes.

152
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:32,132
I love these.

153
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:37,679
By the way,

154
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:41,015
you know the foreigner
who lived in the apartment?

155
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:43,893
I took something from Unit 203
of that building.

156
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:48,731
It looks sketchy and dangerous,
so I'd like to leave it with the police.

157
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:50,400
Why would you take anything?

158
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,652
I didn't know it'd be so dangerous.

159
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:54,154
- Really?
- Yeah.

160
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:56,239
I'm turning myself in, okay?

161
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,824
Cut me some slack.

00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:19,387
I think we need to take it to a shop.

164
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,973
I could do it, but I don't have the tools.

165
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:22,974
How much would it be?

166
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:25,852
For data extraction, memory analysis,

167
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:28,438
and reverse engineering, it'll be--

168
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:31,065
So, how much will it be in total?

169
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,151
About 20,000,000 won?

170
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:34,235
Did you say 2,000 won?

171
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:36,112
- You don't mean 20,000,000 won, right?
- What?

172
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:38,531
For this?

173
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:40,533
Yes.

174
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:44,412
Man, that's too expensive.

175
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:48,041
If the five of us were to split it...
No, leave the college student out.

00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:49,918
So, 5,000,000 won per person?

177
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:52,378
We can pay in installments.

178
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:54,672
Yes, over 120 months.

179
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:57,383
- Yes, do that.
- We should look for some other ways.

180
00:11:57,634 --> 00:11:58,760
I got it.

181
00:11:58,843 --> 00:11:59,886
- You did?
- What?

182
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:02,263
With what money? You're a student.
What's the installment plan?

183
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:04,140
I paid for everything at once.
With my mom's card.

184
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:07,101
- No way!
- You're rich!

185
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:08,978
Don't you need to ask your mom first?

186
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:10,438
Is your mom okay with it?

187
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:12,607
- No way.
- Man...

188
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:16,945
Now that we've got the tools,
I'll keep researching until they arrive.

189
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,947
- I'll prepare the follow-up article.
- Okay.

190
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:21,324
The computer signal disconnected
at the police station,

191
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:22,784
so these guys will go there.

192
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:26,579
Let's hide out at the station, then.

193
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:29,040
You can join us at night after work.

194
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:31,459
I can't do tomorrow.
I have a housewarming party.

195
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:32,502
Really?

196
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:35,380
Who will guard the station
if we're all there?

197
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:38,216
All where?

198
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:39,509
Your housewarming party.

199
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,177
Aren't we all invited?

200
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:43,680
I'm fine.

201
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:46,516
I should attend as Do-yeon's master.

202
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:49,811
Have you all lost your minds?

203
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,771
I invited my colleagues from work!

204
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:54,524
I wasn't going to go, anyway.

205
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,528
My gosh!

206
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:02,532
Why did you even mention the party, then?

207
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:05,576
So, you only like your colleagues
and not your neighbors?

208
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,120
Who's going to hide out, then?

209
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,789
We can install a camera
at the station and record it.

210
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:12,917
The data fee will be so high

211
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:15,295
without the wi-fi feature
on the memory card, though.

212
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:17,380
What? How much is that?

213
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,882
I ordered the memory card
with the highest capacity.

214
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:22,593
My gosh, what are you doing?

215
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:26,139
We can't have you here
if you do that again!

216
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:27,557
Hey, boss! You can be my boss now.

217
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:30,268
- Yes.
- He's the boss.

218
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:33,146
- Thank you.
- Yeah, thank you.

219
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:52,869
What the hell?

220
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,707
You scared me to death!

221
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,876
Is that a security camera in your car?

222
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:01,085
What?

223
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:04,714
Oh, this? It's a custom-made dash cam.

224
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:08,759
The data is sent to the cloud memory.

225
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,595
If someone leaves a dent in my car,

226
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:14,474
this will immediately send me a text.

227
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:16,767
Text, my ass.

228
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:20,104
Yong-hui's phone is off,
and look at what you're doing here.

229
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:22,815
You don't think I know?

230
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:24,150
Are you guys

231
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:27,862
making a crew without me?
Because I'm too old?

232
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:29,197
Did you drink whiskey without me?

233
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:33,910
Come on. What fun is drinking without you?

234
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,164
You and I are only a year apart, too.

235
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:39,916
I'm just as old as you are.

236
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,709
Have fun with your security camera.

237
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:43,252
Huh?

238
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:46,881
Bye, Su-il.

239
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:49,050
I'll call you later.

240
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,552
Don't get sulky, okay?

241
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:56,057
What do we need?

242
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:58,059
Soju and beer, four bottles each.

243
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:00,102
- Four bottles of soju!
- And beer.

244
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:02,855
One bottle, two...

245
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:04,315
<i>Ssamjang.</i>

246
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:07,151
<i>Ssamjang!</i>

247
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:09,987
I need a large batch of short rib cuts.

248
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,658
Short rib cuts?

249
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:17,078
- Would two of these be good?
- Yes.

250
00:17:17,245 --> 00:17:18,579
I'd also like two packs of pork belly.

251
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:19,830
Pork belly?

252
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:31,968
Where's Dad?

253
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,511
- Did we get everything?
- Yeah.

254
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,596
- Let's go now.
- Okay.

255
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:37,348
All right.

256
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:40,059
- Here you go.
- Yes.

257
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:42,019
- Thank you.
- Have a good day.

258
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:43,229
- Goodbye!
- Have a good party.

259
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:44,772
- Goodbye, cutie!
- Bye!

260
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:46,357
- Hi, Su-il.
- See you around.

261
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,567
Hello.

262
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:49,360
- Hello.
- Hi, Do-yeon. Have a good day.

263
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:55,408
You seem awfully sulky again.

264
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:57,326
Here. For the gas station
at the intersection.

265
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:01,581
They don't even have customers
because they don't take card payments.

266
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:03,583
So why are they always ordering
so much coffee?

267
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:08,713
Why do you care
if they chug liters of coffee every day?

268
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:12,258
You're too strict on me!

269
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:22,310
You make me feel terrible
for just getting a drink with the guys.

270
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,813
Now, Yong-hui and Byeong-nam
are having fun without me.

271
00:18:26,981 --> 00:18:28,482
Are they leaving you out?

272
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,401
Of course not.

273
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,239
It's all because
you're as scary as a tiger.

274
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:37,033
Everyone's too scared to say anything.

275
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:40,119
I married a tiger!

276
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,205
Where are you going? Come here.

277
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:44,999
Roar!

278
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:08,564
Let's go!

279
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:12,151
- Left, right, down, up!
- Right on!

280
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:17,073
Special combat martial arts!

281
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:27,500
Oh, wow!

282
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:35,257
The best!

283
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:39,512
Do-yeon, you're so good. You're the best.

284
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:40,596
Is that all?

285
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,848
No, come here.
Uncle will give you some money.

286
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:45,351
Do-yeon, put your hands together.

287
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:49,146
Fine, I'll give you two bills.

288
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:50,731
Thank you.

289
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:52,483
Do-yeon,

290
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:54,360
what's your favorite thing in the world?

291
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:56,278
Going to the amusement park with Daddy.

292
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:59,240
But Daddy is always too busy.

293
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:02,993
I also want to go,
but that man won't let me.

294
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:06,747
Do-yeon, beg this uncle

295
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:08,999
to give Daddy a day off.

296
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:12,628
Please let my Dad
take me to the amusement park.

297
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:17,049
Do-yeon, don't put Uncle in a pickle.

298
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:20,094
She really loves amusement parks.

299
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:21,971
No pressure, sir.

300
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:25,725
Just give in. She wants to go.

301
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,309
No pressure.

302
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:33,482
Fine, take a day off
and go to the amusement park with her.

303
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:36,444
You don't need to do that.

304
00:20:36,527 --> 00:20:37,570
Yes!

305
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:40,656
Yes!

306
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,492
Honey, go to the convenience store
and get some beer.

307
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:44,994
Okay.

308
00:21:01,302 --> 00:21:02,762
How refreshing.

309
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:14,690
The Vice Minister seems to be
looking into who was at the site.

310
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:17,943
What the hell is his deal?

311
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,615
- We don't know who's behind it yet?
- No.

312
00:21:23,908 --> 00:21:26,786
You know how
the first victim was a foreigner?

313
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,872
There was something about
"a new day" or whatever online.

314
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:32,208
Felt like it could be a cult.

315
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:37,505
Why don't we just go with that
and blame a cult?

316
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:40,841
You think I haven't thought of that?
That's the easiest way.

317
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:45,304
But those bombs keep going off,
only in Kiyun-si.

318
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:47,014
That Eun-jae keeps asking...

319
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:48,557
Oh, gosh! See?

320
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:49,642
NA EUN-JAE

321
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:51,977
Speak of the devil.

322
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:54,939
Ridiculous.

323
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,446
She's just scared the plans
for the specialized zone will be canceled.

324
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:05,241
That specialized zone plan
is what led us to this.

325
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:06,826
Anyway,

326
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:10,913
if they find out
it was our bombs exploding in Kiyun-si,

327
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:12,706
it's over for all of us.

328
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:15,000
Stay on your toes.

329
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,002
Yes, sir.

330
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:27,012
<i>The call cannot be completed.</i>
<i>Please leave a voice message...</i>

331
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:28,347
Why, that little...

332
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:30,432
Pick up your damn phone!

333
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:40,693
Drop me off up there.

334
00:22:41,277 --> 00:22:42,278
Yes, ma'am.

335
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:47,366
MAMMOSEU MART

336
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:52,121
Welcome...

337
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:55,124
Hey.

338
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:57,376
That's not a way to greet your customer.

339
00:22:57,626 --> 00:22:59,879
You're not a customer
if you don't buy anything.

340
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:10,514
How much is this?

341
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,560
Keep the change.

342
00:23:15,144 --> 00:23:16,437
Let me ask you something.

343
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,063
You've only visited
during election periods

344
00:23:18,147 --> 00:23:21,191
since graduating from high school.
What brings you here?

345
00:23:21,275 --> 00:23:23,235
You know how busy I am.

346
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:24,737
Since you're one of the leaders,

347
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:27,156
you hear everything
in this neighborhood, right?

348
00:23:27,615 --> 00:23:32,912
Did anyone record a video
of the ATM booth explosion?

349
00:23:33,871 --> 00:23:36,540
What if they did?
What are you trying to pull now?

350
00:23:36,624 --> 00:23:38,334
Pull what? You're unbelievable.

351
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:40,836
I'm a congresswoman of our nation.

352
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:44,298
You saw me install

353
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:47,092
those smart security cameras
for this town's safety.

354
00:23:47,635 --> 00:23:49,762
What are the ladies of the town saying?

355
00:23:51,305 --> 00:23:54,975
They won't vote for you in the next term
because you took too long.

356
00:23:57,978 --> 00:23:59,063
Eun-jae,

357
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:03,067
people don't like to go near you, do they?

358
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,486
- What?
- You can take this.

359
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:08,322
Chew it up.

360
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:11,408
Sure, I'll chew the damn thing.

361
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:22,419
- Here it comes.
- It's here.

362
00:24:22,503 --> 00:24:24,213
- Gosh.
- Over here!

363
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:25,464
It's too early.

364
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:27,800
- Come on!
- Don't say that!

365
00:24:28,676 --> 00:24:30,469
Thank you for coming, sir.

366
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:33,597
Move more often
so we can enjoy your wife's cooking again.

367
00:24:33,681 --> 00:24:35,057
What are you saying? Just get in.

368
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,016
- Bye.
- Round Two?

369
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,810
- Come on!
- Go home!

370
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:40,020
- Get home safely.
- Goodnight!

371
00:24:40,354 --> 00:24:41,397
- You can go, too.
- Let's go.

372
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,482
- Thanks for the feast.
- Let's grab a drink.

373
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:45,651
- My goodness!
- Come on, then.

374
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:47,277
- Let's have another round.
- Go home.

375
00:24:47,361 --> 00:24:48,487
No, I'm fine.

376
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,698
- No!
- Please!

377
00:24:50,781 --> 00:24:52,866
Let's grab another drink.
Use the company card.

378
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:17,182
Gosh, I'm tired.

379
00:25:21,395 --> 00:25:22,354
Who are you?

380
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:44,126
You up?

381
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:48,005
Place your hands on the wheel, palms down.

382
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:53,761
Okay.

383
00:25:59,308 --> 00:26:02,061
I had to wait
because I couldn't unlock your phone.

384
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:06,648
There we go.

385
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:12,112
If this falls off, you're dead.

386
00:26:12,863 --> 00:26:14,114
I'm not kidding.

387
00:26:19,328 --> 00:26:20,245

388
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:21,747
It's me.

389
00:26:22,748 --> 00:26:23,707
<i>Is he with you?</i>

390
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:25,751
Yes, but...

391
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,880
He got me.

392
00:26:30,756 --> 00:26:31,715
<i>Choi Kang?</i>

393
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:35,719
<i>Don't be stupid.</i>
<i>Just take the package I sent.</i>

394
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:37,846
The glove compartment.

395
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:49,566
<i>Take the phone and let the man go.</i>

396
00:26:51,068 --> 00:26:53,487
Are you the one who pulled off
that "new day" bullshit?

397
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:55,322
Who are you?

398
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:57,074
How did you know I lived here?

399
00:27:01,495 --> 00:27:02,704
Why isn't he answering?

400
00:27:03,664 --> 00:27:05,332
It got disconnected.

401
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:06,500
What?

402
00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:14,550
I told you you'd die if this fell off.

403
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:17,845
But you took it.

405
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:30,941
Should I say I received or stole it?

406
00:27:31,233 --> 00:27:33,986
It either looks like a burner phone
or an encrypted one.

407
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:35,154
It's an encrypted phone.

408
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:37,573
- How do you know?
- I can tell by looking at it.

409
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:39,408
Good for you, JDD.

410
00:27:40,284 --> 00:27:43,912
Aren't these only used in the military?

411
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:47,749
He knows my name and where I live.

412
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,586
Could it be those guys?

413
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:54,673
Are they trying to contact you with this
because we blocked the satellite signals?

414
00:27:56,717 --> 00:27:59,428
He didn't seem to be on the same side
as the satellite laptop guys.

415
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:00,470
Not those guys?

416
00:28:01,597 --> 00:28:02,598
The military?

417
00:28:03,557 --> 00:28:04,641
Not sure.

418
00:28:07,978 --> 00:28:09,605
How's Mr. Lee doing with the laptop?

419
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:12,399
He's having a blast.

420
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:13,734

00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:49,895

No, I feel bad for you,
working at the office all by yourself.

427
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:14,253
You didn't let me finish.
Why are you so irritated? Menopause?

428
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,463
I should have just ignored you.

429
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:19,174
I know! You've worked with me
for long enough.

430
00:29:19,258 --> 00:29:21,927
There's no need to respond to everything.

431
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:24,596
I sent the insurance payout
for Ms. Lee Seo-hui today.

432
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,764

00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,517
Thank you, sir!

434
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:31,270
Did you receive
the insurance payout, Ms. Lee?

435
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:34,773
I'm glad it all worked out.

436
00:29:35,649 --> 00:29:39,236
Did you also receive compensation
for the house damage?

437
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:42,864
I see.

438
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:45,117
No, they'll send the money soon.

439
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:46,868

And you'll need to find me first
if you want to kill me.

468
00:31:25,926 --> 00:31:29,221
You brave little shit,
you don't think I can find you?

No.

00:37:12,731 --> 00:37:16,401
I built this radio-wave-blocking tent
by hand.

532
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:19,696
It was supposed only to block radio waves,

533
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:22,657
but it almost blocked my life out, too!
I nearly died from the heat.

534
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:26,870
Still got the job done, though.

535
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:28,037
That's true.

536
00:37:28,121 --> 00:37:30,540
It costs about 30,000,000 won
to build the real thing.

537
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:33,251
But I didn't even use
one-hundredth of that.

538
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:35,044
- Good work.
- Thank you.

539
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:37,338
I'll check the footage
and upload it right away.

540
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:38,631
- Okay.
- All right.

541
00:37:38,715 --> 00:37:40,800
Mr. Lee, could I have a copy
of the dashcam footage?

542
00:37:42,427 --> 00:37:43,511
Here you go.

543
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:46,181
And just call me Yong-hui.

544
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:48,266
Is that all right, Yong-hui?

545
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:49,392
Yes!

546
00:37:49,476 --> 00:37:52,353
Anyway, great work.

547
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:10,413
Did you end up arguing with Byeong-nam?

548
00:38:10,497 --> 00:38:14,000
No, why would I argue with him?
That's a waste of time.

549
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:16,419
You did, huh?

550
00:38:18,505 --> 00:38:20,673
Honey, the thing is,

551
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:25,887
I just saw Min-seo's tutor,
Producer Kim of Magnifying Media, and Kang

552
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:28,473
all gathering at the hardware store.

553
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:29,516
Without me.

554
00:38:29,891 --> 00:38:31,518
So? Join them.

555
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:34,437
Me? I can't.

556
00:38:34,521 --> 00:38:36,439
How could I go when I wasn't invited?

557
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:38,817
How could I join them? I can't.

558
00:38:40,193 --> 00:38:44,948
Even Chun-bae hasn't seen Byeong-nam
since Myeong-o's funeral.

559
00:38:47,075 --> 00:38:49,702
The Byeong-nam we knew of is gone.
He's changed.

560
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:51,162
And I'm alone.

561
00:38:51,788 --> 00:38:52,831
It's fine.

562
00:38:52,914 --> 00:38:55,416
I'll just clean that up.
Who am I to be sad?

563
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:02,590
What are they scheming?

564
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:08,179
- Good work.
- Yong-hui, you're awesome.

565
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:09,389
It's nothing.

566
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:11,182
- Good work.
- It was impressive.

567
00:39:11,266 --> 00:39:12,392
Oh, hello.

568
00:39:22,694 --> 00:39:25,154
I'll get going first.
I have some editing to do.

569
00:39:25,238 --> 00:39:26,573
Please excuse me.

570
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:28,825
I'd better get going, too.

571
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:30,451
Me too.

572
00:39:30,994 --> 00:39:32,036
Hello, ma'am.

573
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:35,164
I need a shower.

574
00:39:35,248 --> 00:39:36,332
Bye.

575
00:39:39,836 --> 00:39:42,589
I also need to tidy up the stationery...

576
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:47,552
Byeong-nam.

577
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:50,805
What now?

578
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:54,267
What are you guys plotting?

579
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:06,029
HARDWARE DREAM TREE STATIONERY

580
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:12,327
She's been in there for over 20 minutes.
What's taking her so long?

581
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:15,330
Man...

582
00:40:16,164 --> 00:40:19,292
It must be really tough
for my poor Byeong-nam.

583
00:40:21,294 --> 00:40:23,338
It's okay. I live with that every day.

584
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:29,969
It was just too odd, okay?

585
00:40:30,178 --> 00:40:32,597
Explosions kept going off
in the neighborhood.

586
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:35,183
Kang and I just so happened
to witness one of them,

587
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:38,895
so we teamed up
to get to the bottom of it.

588
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:40,772
That's all.

589
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:43,107
You traitor.

590
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:47,737
So you're family
only when you're out drinking at night?

591
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:51,532
All these things are happening,
and you guys are keeping it from us?

592
00:40:51,658 --> 00:40:54,035
What's the point of scaring everyone
with all of this?

593
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:57,163
Am I telling you to tell everyone in town?

594
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:59,207
You should've at least told
Chun-bae and me!

595
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:01,250
We're also leaders of the neighborhood.

596
00:41:01,334 --> 00:41:04,796
Chun-bae is too busy
with his wife right now,

597
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:06,422
and you're...

598
00:41:06,965 --> 00:41:08,049
What?

599
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:15,264
My naive little husband
thought you were pretending to be busy

600
00:41:15,348 --> 00:41:17,392
to hang out with Yong-hui
and Kang without him.

601
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:18,768
He's pouting like crazy.

602
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:21,020
That's not all.

603
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:24,148
He thinks you guys don't come to the store
because you're scared of me.

604
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:26,025
That's not entirely wrong.

605
00:41:27,652 --> 00:41:28,736
Damn it.

606
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:30,571
Come on!

607
00:41:31,114 --> 00:41:34,283
If Su-il knew about this,
he would've told the whole town!

608
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:40,540
He's friendly, yes.
But he can keep a secret better than you.

609
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:46,587
I don't care
about what you guys are doing.

610
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:50,091
Just don't leave my husband out. Got that?

611
00:41:52,677 --> 00:41:56,055
Get to the bottom of it...
What can you even do?

612
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:28,880
Honey, my boss gave me a day off
to go to the amusement park.

613
00:42:29,172 --> 00:42:31,674
Really? That's great.

614
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,760
Do-yeon will be so happy.

615
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:36,971
But do we have to go?

616
00:42:37,055 --> 00:42:39,974
With all that news
about park rides malfunctioning.

617
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:43,770
How do you give her baths?
Aren't you scared she'll drown, too?

618
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:46,731
You're so overprotective of her.

619
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:50,109
All of Do-yeon's friends
have been to amusement parks.

620
00:42:50,193 --> 00:42:51,402
All except Do-yeon.

621
00:42:52,945 --> 00:42:55,323
Still, we don't need to go now--

622
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:58,367
We do. You got a day off.

623
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:01,037
Cut the crap. We're taking her.

624
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:03,247
- Lights out.
- Yes, ma'am.

625
00:43:22,058 --> 00:43:23,434
<i>The video will be up at midnight.</i>

626
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:25,228
<i>Please like, comment, and subscribe.</i>

627
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:31,651
<i>Here's the dashcam footage</i>
<i>we were able to track down.</i>

628
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:36,739
<i>On the laptop of the foreigner</i>
<i>who died in the ATM explosion</i>

629
00:43:37,115 --> 00:43:39,367
<i>was a video of the crash</i>
<i>at the Kiyun Intersection,</i>

630
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:41,202
<i>along with a suspicious map.</i>

631
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:46,374
<i>What's scarier is that there was a message</i>
<i>foreshadowing a terrorist attack.</i>

632
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:49,585
<i>Despite the government's announcement</i>
<i>that the three explosions were accidental,</i>

633
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:54,423
<i>we've found evidence</i>
<i>that these explosions were planned.</i>

634
00:43:54,507 --> 00:43:57,844
<i>In the next video,</i>
<i>we'll reveal the organizations and people</i>

635
00:43:57,927 --> 00:44:02,473
<i>associated with the explosions,</i>
<i>based on our research.</i>

636
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:04,308
<i>Thank you.</i>

637
00:44:04,392 --> 00:44:05,643
WHAT'S HAPPENING TO OUR CITY?

638
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:07,270
A NEW DAY IS COMING

639
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:53,900
Welcome!

640
00:44:56,235 --> 00:44:58,571
It'd be good to avoid crowds
as much as we can.

641
00:44:58,654 --> 00:44:59,655
Whatever.

642
00:44:59,906 --> 00:45:03,075
You sound like an old man.
Just let Do-yeon have a blast, okay?

643
00:45:03,492 --> 00:45:06,454
It's been her dream
to come here with her dad.

644
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:07,747
She's living her dream today.

645
00:45:08,456 --> 00:45:09,999
Oh, a bunny!

646
00:45:12,335 --> 00:45:14,503
Daddy, come on!

647
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:18,507
- Don't run, Do-yeon! You'll trip!
- She'll be fine.

648
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:21,761
She's very athletic
because she takes after me.

649
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:23,638
I hope she takes after me
for everything else.

650
00:45:25,223 --> 00:45:26,807
Daddy is coming to get you!

651
00:45:33,022 --> 00:45:37,401
How cute. My eldest son
is playing with my daughter.

652
00:45:38,903 --> 00:45:40,321
I'm coming, too!

653
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:41,948
Here she comes!

654
00:46:12,186 --> 00:46:13,020
Do-yeon!

00:47:10,286 --> 00:47:11,454
Yes, this is the situation room.

658
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:14,457
A bomb threat in Kiyun-si?

659
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:18,044
- So you're saying that...
- This is the situation room.

660
00:47:22,173 --> 00:47:24,050
What? A bomb threat?

661
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:29,847
On social media?

662
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:30,931
Attention, everyone!

663
00:47:31,724 --> 00:47:34,060
Get all security camera footage
from Kiyun-si on the screen

664
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:35,686
and look for any odd signs.

00:47:41,942 --> 00:47:43,110
Eat something good?

668
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:44,278
Sure.

669
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:46,447
- Bye!
- Bye!

670
00:47:58,417 --> 00:48:00,461
Sir, look at this!

671
00:48:01,587 --> 00:48:02,421
What is it?

672
00:48:03,089 --> 00:48:04,256
Look over here.

673
00:48:19,647 --> 00:48:21,816
<i>You have tutoring today, right?</i>
<i>Don't be late.</i>

674
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:24,568
<i>Yeah, I'm waiting for the bus now.</i>

675
00:48:27,363 --> 00:48:29,323
<i>Did you go over the material?</i>

676
00:48:30,074 --> 00:48:32,284
Come on, stop nagging me.

677
00:48:37,706 --> 00:48:38,707
Whose bag is that?

678
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:40,751
I should put it on the bench.

Min-seo!

682
00:49:16,495 --> 00:49:18,164
You can't come in, it's dangerous.
Stay back.

683
00:49:18,414 --> 00:49:19,832
- Let me through.
- It's dangerous. Please step back.

684
00:49:19,915 --> 00:49:21,041
- Let me through.
- Please step back.

685
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:22,126
Let me through!

686
00:49:26,005 --> 00:49:26,881
Chief?

687
00:49:28,299 --> 00:49:29,633
Let me through. I'm going in.

688
00:49:29,717 --> 00:49:32,219
No, the EOD team is on the way.
What's going on?

689
00:49:33,429 --> 00:49:34,472
It's my daughter in there.

690
00:49:42,855 --> 00:49:43,981
No, please!

691
00:49:45,149 --> 00:49:46,150

692
00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:09,840

00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:18,807
it'll be over in no time.

696
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:20,559
You trust me, right?

697
00:50:22,478 --> 00:50:23,437
Yes.

698
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:30,236
Good girl.

699
00:50:31,737 --> 00:50:32,655
It's okay.

700
00:50:34,198 --> 00:50:35,533
It'll be fine. Slowly.

701
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:38,994
I got you.

702
00:50:44,208 --> 00:50:45,501
Let me take a look.

703
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:02,768
Min-seo.

704
00:51:03,477 --> 00:51:04,853
Min-seo.

705

Look at me.

706
00:51:07,606 --> 00:51:08,816
We have more than enough time.

707
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:13,696
Min-seo, I can do it, okay?

708
00:51:15,197 --> 00:51:16,198
It'll be okay.

709
00:52:51,502 --> 00:52:52,628
It's all over.

710
00:52:54,463 --> 00:52:55,714
It's all good now.

711
00:52:57,758 --> 00:52:59,051
Good job, Min-seo.

712
00:53:01,095 --> 00:53:02,262
It's all over.

713
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:07,267
Good job, Min-seo.

714
00:53:09,103 --> 00:53:11,480
Min-seo. I'm here, sweetie.

715
00:53:13,232 --> 00:53:17,319
I'm so proud of you.

716
00:53:17,403 --> 00:53:20,364
Good job, Min-seo.

717
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:27,371
You were amazing.

718
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:43,554
<i>This afternoon, a suspicious backpack</i>
<i>possibly containing a bomb was reported.</i>

719
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:46,056
<i>The police and military</i>
<i>responded immediately.</i>

720
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:49,184
<i>The bomb in question</i>
<i>was revealed to be a fake,</i>

721
00:53:49,268 --> 00:53:51,854
<i>with no explosive risk.</i>

722
00:53:51,937 --> 00:53:54,732
The conspiracies and fake news
are getting out of control.

723
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:57,818
Look at it now.
Even kids are pulling terrorist pranks.

724
00:53:59,653 --> 00:54:00,863
Hey!

725
00:54:00,946 --> 00:54:03,449
Are you fucking kidding me?

726
00:54:04,408 --> 00:54:07,953
They're all anti-state forces!

727
00:54:08,412 --> 00:54:10,372
Arrest them right now
and interrogate them.

728
00:54:12,124 --> 00:54:15,043
MAGNIFYING MEDIA

729
00:54:28,015 --> 00:54:30,768
What? What the hell?

730
00:54:31,226 --> 00:54:32,561
Hey! What's going on?

731
00:54:32,644 --> 00:54:34,021
Hold on!

732
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:36,315
Hey, don't touch the server!

733
00:54:37,483 --> 00:54:39,234
What's going on?

734
00:54:39,568 --> 00:54:40,986
Who the hell are you?

735
00:54:42,196 --> 00:54:43,989
Hey, where...

736
00:54:45,449 --> 00:54:46,909
Where are you taking me?

737
00:54:47,868 --> 00:54:48,994
What is this?

738
00:54:49,328 --> 00:54:50,829
Damn it!

739
00:55:09,223 --> 00:55:10,808
I want ice cream.

740
00:55:10,891 --> 00:55:12,142
You had some earlier.

741
00:55:12,434 --> 00:55:14,186
Can I have one more?

742
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:16,522
No, too much cold food
will upset your stomach.

743
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:21,276
My stomach is fine.

744
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:23,153
I want another one, too.

745
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:29,201
Mommy, just one more, please?

746
00:55:29,451 --> 00:55:30,744
I promise not to upset my stomach.

747
00:55:31,453 --> 00:55:33,163
She says she won't upset her stomach.

748
00:55:33,247 --> 00:55:35,249
- Mom.
- Mom.

749
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:38,168
- Mom.
- Mom.

750
00:55:38,252 --> 00:55:39,461
Stop it.

751
00:55:39,545 --> 00:55:41,296
It's on you if Do-yeon gets a stomachache.

752
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:43,298
Yes! I'll take care of you
if you get a stomachache!

753
00:55:43,382 --> 00:55:44,383
Okay!

754
00:55:44,716 --> 00:55:47,761
The line for ice cream is long,
so I'll get it for us.

755
00:55:47,845 --> 00:55:49,638
Okay, I'll go to the bathroom
with Do-yeon.

756
00:55:49,721 --> 00:55:51,181
- Okay, I'll meet you there.
- Okay.

757
00:55:51,265 --> 00:55:52,349
I want strawberry ice cream!

758
00:55:52,432 --> 00:55:53,642
Okay, strawberry it is!

759
00:56:08,115 --> 00:56:09,116
All right.

760
00:56:09,867 --> 00:56:12,578
Do-yeon, I also need to use the bathroom.

761
00:56:12,661 --> 00:56:14,580
- So don't go anywhere and wait, okay?
- Okay.

762
00:56:15,122 --> 00:56:16,748
Here.

763
00:56:26,633 --> 00:56:28,385
Hi, could we use the sink?

764
00:57:22,814 --> 00:57:25,442
Do-yeon! Where did you get that ice cream?

765
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:28,278
He said it was from you.

766
00:57:31,406 --> 00:57:32,407
Who?

767
00:57:36,703 --> 00:57:38,580
Some guy.

768
00:57:39,831 --> 00:57:42,042
It's fine. You can eat it. It's melting.

769
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:29,316
HEROES NEXT DOOR

770
00:59:32,736 --> 00:59:34,905
- Good shot!
- Good shot!

771
00:59:34,988 --> 00:59:37,407
- Did it swerve? Where did it go?
- It went straight.

772
00:59:37,824 --> 00:59:39,618
- As straight as an arrow.
- As long as I made it.

773
00:59:42,329 --> 00:59:43,246
Hey.

774
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:45,373
Yes, Kim Seok-jun speaking.

775
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:49,920
Come on.

776
00:59:51,088 --> 00:59:55,092
If you start complicating things,
it won't end, you know?

777
00:59:55,342 --> 00:59:59,054
Imagine what a mess it'll be
if we let anti-state forces run wild.

778
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:02,349
Terrorism isn't just about bombs.

779
01:00:03,350 --> 01:00:06,937
Spreading false news to our people
is also terrorism.

780
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:10,899
I'll take care of it, all right?
I'll send in someone good.

781
01:00:10,982 --> 01:00:13,610
Don't worry about it.

782
01:00:14,986 --> 01:00:16,947
Yeah, exactly.

783
01:00:17,906 --> 01:00:20,617
Let's grab a meal sometime. Okay.

784
01:00:21,743 --> 01:00:22,744
Bye.

785
01:00:24,329 --> 01:00:26,873
This thick-headed moron.

786
01:00:27,207 --> 01:00:29,167
- Let's get moving.
- Okay.

787
01:00:31,294 --> 01:00:34,131
Why can't he just take a hint?

788
01:00:35,382 --> 01:00:36,383
Who's this?

789
01:00:38,343 --> 01:00:39,344
Hello?

790
01:00:39,845 --> 01:00:41,179
<i>Minister Kim.</i>

791
01:00:42,848 --> 01:00:43,974
Yes, who's this?

792
01:00:46,518 --> 01:00:47,811
It's me,

793
01:00:47,894 --> 01:00:49,229
Sullivan.

794
01:00:52,482 --> 01:00:54,151
James Sullivan?

795
01:01:34,566 --> 01:01:36,735
<i>The government could be controlling it,</i>

796
01:01:36,818 --> 01:01:39,321
<i>or they could really be moving in secret.</i>

797
01:01:39,404 --> 01:01:42,657
<i>Who are these bastards</i>
<i>playing with bombs in our neighborhood?</i>

798
01:01:42,741 --> 01:01:46,203
<i>She was the youngest drill instructor</i>
<i>of the 707th Unit?</i>

799
01:01:46,286 --> 01:01:48,413
What's with all the special forces
in this neighborhood?

800
01:01:48,496 --> 01:01:49,414
What happened?

801
01:01:49,497 --> 01:01:52,250
- Minister Kim, you could get screwed.
- Screw you.

802
01:01:52,334 --> 01:01:55,295
<i>Something's going on,</i>
<i>and Kiyun-si is at the center of it.</i>

803
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:57,088
<i>They would have been smart.</i>

804
01:01:57,422 --> 01:02:01,218
<i>Then shouldn't we</i>
<i>find a way to outsmart them?</i>

805
01:02:03,470 --> 01:02:05,472
