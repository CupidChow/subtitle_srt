1
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:00,101
Atmospheric instability is

2
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:03,063
the collision of two types of air
with different properties.

3
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:03,748
I'm late.

4
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:20,890
Wait for me.

5
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:23,643
-No, you leave later.
-But aren't we late?

6
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:25,103
No, you are.

7
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:34,362
THE EFFECTIVENESS OF FOG ADVISORIES
AND CASES FROM ABROAD

8
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:58,761
Hello?

9
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:28,374
So what do you want me to do?

10
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:31,586
No. I won't do it anymore.

11
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:33,546
There's nothing I can do for you!

12
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:36,174
Never call me again.

13
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:52,899
When cold air suddenly meets warm air…

14
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:58,488
I left the USB.

15
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:00,114
Right.

16
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:04,911
I was going to bring it to you.

17
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:08,706
Thanks.

18
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:13,127
By the way, who was that?

19
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:18,967
Someone I used to know.

20
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:26,766
…the atmosphere becomes unstable
and dangerous weather occurs.

21
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:31,312
Aren't you late for work? You better go.

22
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:33,398
Yes, I will.

23
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:38,278
Wait for me.

24
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:44,951
Where are you going?
I want to talk to you.

25
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:46,202
Later.

26
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,376
Do you usually hold grudges?

27
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,836
"Grudges"?

28
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,172
Did you just say "grudges"?

29
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:00,216
Yes, I dated Si-woo.

30
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,802
I met him for the first time
at the Metropolitan Office,

31
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:04,554
and we went out for a few months.

32
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:06,889
So what? What else do you want to know?

33
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:10,435
My crush in college
and my first love in high school?

34
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:12,562
You aren't getting the point.

35
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:15,315
Do you think I'm mad
because of your ex-boyfriend?

36
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:16,399
Aren't you?

37
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:17,734
You said you didn't know him.

38
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,527
You said you had never seen him.

39
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,237
Why did you lie to me?

40
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:25,616
I didn't want you to feel uncomfortable
when you saw him at work.

41
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,993
Because I hate

42
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:29,787
seeing her face
whenever I go to Headquarters.

43
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:31,956
Do you think I've been okay with it?

44
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,626
I told you I had a fiancée
from the beginning.

45
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:38,421
You're the one who said
you didn't care about the past.

46
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:41,215
I see.

47
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:44,677
Is that why your past came to our wedding

48
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:46,846
and made a scene?

49
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,434
Forget it.

50
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:56,397
We're not done talking.

51
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:59,275
If I don't leave now,
I'll be late for work.

52
00:05:59,358 --> 00:06:01,319
I have to sort out
the mess you made yesterday.

53
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:03,863
But…

54
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:26,719
The weather is warm compared to
the average temperature of early June.

55
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:30,139
Today will be hot
as the temperature suddenly rises.

56
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,100
Currently, Seoul is 23°C

57
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:34,018
and Incheon is 21°C,

58
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:36,187
which is about 1 or 2°C
lower than yesterday,

59
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:39,273
but the midday temperature will be 29°C.

60
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:40,483
Considering that June is

61
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:43,444
the beginning of summer,
the weather is still hot.

62
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:45,279
The skies will be clear all day.

63
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:48,741
Strong sunlight will shine down
through cloudless skies,

64
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,409
so please be wary of UV rays…

65
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:52,662
Keep both hands on the wheel.

66
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,081
I can drive with one hand.

67
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:58,501
I want you to drive safely.

68
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:01,003
Okay.

69
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:04,465
Different principles.

70
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:09,846
CHAE YU-JIN

71
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:13,766
CHAE YU-JIN

72
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:15,977
Well…

73
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,895
I have to drive safely.

74
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:19,188
Right?

75
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,026
Different wounds.

76
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:34,662
KOREA METEOROLOGICAL ADMINISTRATION

77
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,418
Drop me off at the crosswalk.

78
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,336
Why? We're almost there.

79
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,671
Let's just go.

80
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:44,922
Drop me off.

81
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:46,299
Are you afraid we'll be seen?

82
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:48,801
We can say we met on the way by chance.

83
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:50,428
Should I get out here?

84
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:55,433
Just as cold air suddenly meets
a mass of warm air,

85
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:59,312
you and I have met with our differences.

86
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:03,858
Okay.

87
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,402
-I'll drop you off there.
-Okay.

88
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,446
Take a right…

89
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:13,201
What?

90
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:16,412
Hey.

91
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,049
We've already decided to begin.

92
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:33,012
How many abnormal climate events
caused by this decision

93
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:35,848
will we be able to avoid?

94
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:43,022
EPISODE 5
LOCALIZED HEAVY RAIN

95
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:51,197
Let it slide.

96
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:57,119
-We met on our way here.
-Pardon?

97
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:00,790
Forecaster Lee and I met
on the way here coincidentally.

98
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:03,084
Okay.

99
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:05,336
It was a coincidence.

100
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,844
Traffic in Uijeongbu
has been congested all morning

101
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:16,722
because the overflow
of Jungnang Stream flooded the roads.

102
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:19,308
Flooded? Jungnang Stream?

103
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,811
It rained in Uijeongbu overnight.

104
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:23,437
It poured 50mm per hour.

105
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:24,772
-Rain?
-Rain?

106
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:28,901
Okay.

107
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:32,113
But isn't it too early

108
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,283
for localized heavy rain to fall?

109
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:38,828
In terms of development,
it's a typical localized heavy rain.

110
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,871
It took exactly 21 minutes

111
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:44,584
for the rain cloud developed
in Uijeongbu to move to Namyangju.

112
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:47,211
A heavy rain advisory was issued
around 5:30 a.m.

113
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:50,256
The total accumulated precipitation
is predicted to be 70 to 80mm.

114
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:52,675
Where's the precipitation concentrated?

115
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:54,594
Near the Jungnang Stream footbridge.

116
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:56,554
Jungnang Stream? My goodness.

117
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:59,432
By the time the warning was issued,
it was already too late.

118
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:02,059
-Yes.
-Okay.

119
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:05,313
Director Jin. What do you think?

120
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:08,441
Don't you think
the water vapor inflow is abnormally high?

121
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:10,318
Yesterday's daytime temperature

122
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:13,571
rose to 30°C and caused
the heating of the earth's surface.

123
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:17,950
As a result, the atmosphere
became more unstable.

124
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:20,870
The decisive reason
seems to be the instability

125
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:23,247
in the vicinity of Uijeongbu
as cold air descended

126
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:24,707
from the north overnight.

127
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:25,875
What?

128
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,043
On what grounds?

129
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:29,086
If you look here,

130
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:32,214
the temperature difference
between the upper and lower layers

131
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,300
of the atmosphere
near Uijeongbu is almost 40.

132
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:38,638
I see.

133
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:40,264
-Director Jin.
-Yes.

134
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:41,891
Analyze this in detail.

135
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:43,434
Yes, sir.

136
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:48,356
Very sharp. Good job.

137
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:51,901
-I'm glad to have you at Headquarters.
-Thank you.

138
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:56,113
All right.

139
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,619
Of all those rain echoes,

140
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:04,664
how do you know which one
will develop into a localized rain?

141
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:05,915
How do you find it in an hour?

142
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:09,251
Let's say you're boiling water in a pot.

143
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,754
It's similar to guessing

144
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:14,090
where the bubbles will come up first.

145
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:15,174
What?

146
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:18,511
Don't try to guess

147
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:20,346
if you want to stay sane.

148
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:25,393
COMPREHENSIVE CONTROL SYSTEM

149
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:26,644
All right.

150
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:29,230
Don't be intimidated.

151
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:30,648
Think of it as a jab

152
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:33,150
thrown by the man up there
to keep us alert.

153
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:34,193
Okay?

154
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,655
Keep your eyes wide open
and monitor the situation.

155
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,618
Real-time monitoring is the key
to localized heavy rain.

156
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:44,412
That's all.

157
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:45,955
Okay. Good work.

158
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:48,165
-Thank you.
-Good work.

159
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:49,291
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

160
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:52,545
-Hello.
-Hi.

161
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,005
I'm sorry. I'm late.

162
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:58,759
-Senior Forecaster Um.
-Yes, sir.

163
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:03,848
Let's have some coffee.

164
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:06,851
-Oh, okay.
-Come.

165
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:08,477
Yes, sir.

166
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:23,534
Thank you.

167
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:27,455
Didn't you go home
after drinking with me last night?

168
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:31,375
I couldn't sleep, so I had another drink.

169
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:34,753
-So I slept in.
-This is so unexpected.

170
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:36,297
The great Um Dong-han drinking

171
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:39,467
and being late during
the summer disaster prevention period.

172
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:45,139
What's wrong?

173
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:49,935
The climate pattern changes
every three days.

174
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:52,062
I'm bound to change too.

175
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:55,065
Is everything okay at home?

176
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:58,694
Everything is fine.

177
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:06,160
You were crazy about the weather

178
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:08,996
that you were always
at sea or in the mountains.

179
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:10,789
You were so busy

180
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:12,875
that you'd only come home
every now and then.

181
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,085
And the next morning, you'd be off again.

182
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:16,837
Were you ever there for Bo-mi?

183
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:17,922
Were you?

184
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:21,133
That was how Bo-mi and I lived

185
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:23,928
for the past 14 years.

186
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:26,180
Do you get that, Dong-han?

187
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:55,042
What?

188
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,253
Are you going somewhere?

189
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:00,214
Well…

190
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:02,841
I'll be staying at Headquarters.

191
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:07,221
I have a lot of work during
summer disaster prevention period.

192
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:09,765
Do you really have to do this?

193
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:12,601
You and Bo-mi will be more comfortable.

194
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:13,978
Do whatever you want.

195
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:16,522
Why did you even come back
in the first place?

196
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:01,567
Does Senior Forecaster Um like to drink?

197
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:04,570
I don't know. I never heard he did.

198
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:08,782
I guess he's having a hard time
because he didn't get promoted.

199
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:10,034
Right?

200
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:12,286
Don't you think so?

201
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:14,121
I'm not sure.

202
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:15,873
Attention, everyone.

203
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:17,917
We'll analyze the issues

204
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,461
related to localized heavy rain
over the past ten years

205
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:23,589
including precipitation, duration,
and distribution by region.

206
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:24,840
The past ten years?

207
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:25,841
Yes.

208
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:29,929
Do we need to look at the past ten years?

209
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:32,681
This morning was an unusual case.

210
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,350
It was,

211
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:37,227
but a similar pattern may be repeated
due to climate change.

212
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:39,480
We need to analyze it
from a long-term perspective.

213
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:41,315
It's a time of high uncertainty.

214
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:43,067
Analyzing it short-term

215
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,610
will be more helpful

216
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:47,029
in forecasting weather more accurately.

217
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:50,074
Right. The Director General said
real-time monitoring was the key.

218
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:53,577
Isn't real-time monitoring
more important than analyzing data?

219
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:09,343
Please analyze the data
from the past ten years.

220
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:15,724
I guess I'm working overtime again.

221
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:44,461
HOW ACCURATE IS THE RAIN FORECAST?

222
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:46,755
-Did you check?
-I'll call them now.

223
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:49,425
What's this?

224
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,468
Why aren't the stories unified?

225
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:54,430
We found out after
the heavy rain advisory was issued.

226
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:55,764
Some wrote the articles

227
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,766
before we put out the press release.

228
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:00,310
Darn it.

229
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:04,314
-Which team is in charge?
-They probably changed shifts.

230
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:06,942
Now it's Chief Team Two.

231
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,652
Chief Team Two?

232
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:15,284
TREAT THE SKIES AS A FRIEND
AND THE PEOPLE AS THE SKIES

233
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,286
Chief Team Two.

234
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:21,206
Chief Team Two.

235
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:26,587
Chief Team Two.

236
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:32,968
FORECAST TRAINING

237
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,564
-He called.
-Who called?

238
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:56,283
It's over between us.

239
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:57,868
Why is he calling me?

240
00:17:57,951 --> 00:17:59,119
I'm sorry.

241
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:01,497
Please block him.

242
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,916
I'm already in deep trouble
because of you.

243
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:05,209
Because of me?

244
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:06,627
Ki-jun found out

245
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:08,796
that we had dated.

246
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:10,798
It's all in the past. Why is it a problem?

247
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:14,635
Why did you make a scene at my wedding?

248
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:17,012
And why did you
get dispatched to Headquarters

249
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,972
after I returned from my honeymoon?

250
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,850
It's obvious Ki-jun thinks it's weird.

251
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:27,523
So?

252
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:29,733
Did you guys fight?

253
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:33,070
Did he hassle you?

254
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:37,366
Ki-jun isn't like that.

255
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:39,159
He cares for me a lot.

256
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:42,579
He'd never hold grudges
over something like that.

257
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:45,666
Okay. Got it. I'll be careful.

258
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:46,875
Do you have more to say?

259
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,252
No, I don't.

260
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:53,340
Ki-jun.

261
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:07,062
What are you doing?

262
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:08,772
We were talking.

263
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,649
I mean,

264
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:15,237
Chief Team shouldn't deal
with the press directly.

265
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,656
You have to go through
the Office of Spokesperson.

266
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,994
This is why the press releases
different stories.

267
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:23,287
Isn't it?

268
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,997
Talk to me, Ki-jun.

269
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,915
-I'll explain.
-Stay out of this, Reporter Chae.

270
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,083
This is internal business.

271
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:31,795
Why are you doing this?

272
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:34,298
A rookie may not know this,

273
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:36,216
but the Office of Spokesperson
is the voice of KMA.

274
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,219
If you don't cooperate
with the spokesperson,

275
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:42,431
the information is bound to be different
like in the articles this morning.

276
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:44,600
Exactly. If there had been
good communication

277
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:47,728
between the Office of Spokesperson
and the reporters,

278
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:50,272
the Chief Team wouldn't have to intervene.

279
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:52,441
Start sharing information properly first.

280
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,527
Who said you could
keep crossing lines like that?

281
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:58,197
You've been working here for a long time,
so you must know this.

282
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,407
The Situation Room is the heart of KMA.

283
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:04,369
Do you know of a heart
that asks for permission to beat?

284
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,163
What?

285
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,627
If you want a real-time report
on severe weather,

286
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:12,961
come to the Situation Room

287
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:15,339
and monitor it yourself every time.

288
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:57,172
What's up with that guy?

289
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:59,800
Was it wrong of the Office of Spokesperson

290
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:03,095
to ask him to share
severe weather conditions?

291
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:04,221
Also…

292
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:07,474
how dare he talk privately to a reporter,
a married woman at that?

293
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:09,393
What a brazen punk.

294
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:11,937
How dare he talk to my wife

295
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:16,275
standing face to face
in the middle of KMA?

296
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:17,859
You found out.

297
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:19,945
Found out what?

298
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:22,990
That Si-woo is Yu-jin's ex-boyfriend.

299
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:27,411
-Did you know that?
-Yes.

300
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:29,621
-Since when?
-Since he was dispatched.

301
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:33,709
You knew that and you took him in?

302
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:35,919
Director Jin.
You shouldn't have done that.

303
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:38,422
You went out with Yu-jin
knowing that you shouldn't.

304
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:39,589
Well, you…

305
00:21:44,761 --> 00:21:47,889
Hey, do you know that you're really scary?

306
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:49,266
What?

307
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:52,102
Did you want to see
how I would react if I saw him?

308
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:54,229
Is that how you wanted to get back at me?

309
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,480
What are you saying?

310
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,692
I guess that's how
you wanted to harass me.

311
00:21:58,775 --> 00:22:01,236
But you know what? I'm not that weak.

312
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,655
I'm not the kind of person
who reacts sensitively

313
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:05,324
to things like that.

314
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:08,952
-Ki-jun, stop making--
-Wait a minute.

315
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:11,246
Are you…

316
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:15,042
still not over me?

317
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:20,172
Come on, Ha-kyung. This is wrong.

318
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:22,758
Why did you bring him to Headquarters?

319
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:25,218
I'm already married.

320
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:27,262
I can't get back together with--

321
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,394
Gosh, I can't believe I have to deal
with this stupid son of a…

322
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:37,773
Call me outside like this
one more time and I'll make

323
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:40,317
an official complaint
to the Office of Spokesperson

324
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,235
and have you be reprimanded,
Deputy Director Han.

325
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:43,737
-Understood?
-Yes.

326
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:52,788
I knew it.

327
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:55,665
She isn't over me yet.

328
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:58,126
Darn it.

329
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:01,838
SAFE COUNTRY, PEACEFUL PEOPLE

330
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:21,733
Director Jin.

331
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:24,027
I collected the cases
of heavy rain that caused great damage.

332
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:25,237
Okay. Leave it there.

333
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:27,197
Here?

334
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:34,162
Would you like something to drink?

335
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:35,747
No, thanks.

336
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:39,876
Are you mad at me?

337
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:47,759
-What do you mean?
-I think you are.

338
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:52,013
Did I upset you
by commenting on your opinion

339
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:54,766
in front of the Director General?

340
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:57,102
Look, Forecaster Lee.

341
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:08,655
Follow me.

342
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,420
Why did he have to show off
in front of the Director General?

343
00:24:24,337 --> 00:24:25,338
Because of him,

344
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:27,883
-we have to go through so much--
-Enough.

345
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:30,635
Stop whining and keep analyzing.

346
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,695
Forecaster Lee, you--

347
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:56,536
What are you doing?

348
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,413
Don't worry. We won't get caught.

349
00:24:59,414 --> 00:25:00,790
Is this why you provoked me?

350
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:03,168
I didn't provoke you.

351
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:06,087
I was really worried about you.

352
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:09,841
Keep a distance
of a meter from me at work.

353
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:10,842
It's an order.

354
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:19,017
What did you and Ki-jun talk about?

355
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:25,106
Why did he have to call you out
to talk to you?

356
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,441
I was curious.

357
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:31,446
Why do you ask questions when I don't?

358
00:25:35,825 --> 00:25:38,536
I didn't ask why
Yu-jin called you this morning.

359
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,955
But why do you ask me?

360
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:44,542
Is that why you're upset with me?

361
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:46,878
No, it's not.

362
00:25:48,588 --> 00:25:50,882
-It looks like it is.
-Hey, one meter.

363
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:54,010
-It is.
-One meter.

364
00:25:56,137 --> 00:25:59,432
I guess Ki-jun found out
that I'm Yu-jin's ex-boyfriend.

365
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:01,810
It looked like he pestered her.

366
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:04,938
She asked me to be careful,
so I told her I would.

367
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:05,855
The end.

368
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,943
Ki-jun is the kind of person
who holds grudges.

369
00:26:11,194 --> 00:26:12,153
Now it's your turn.

370
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,322
What did Ki-jun say?

371
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,578
He asked me if I was getting back at him

372
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:23,832
by bringing you to my team knowing

373
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:26,293
that you were his wife's ex-boyfriend.

374
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:27,877
Why would I get back at him?

375
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:32,299
Honestly, we didn't start this crazy act
to get back at anyone.

376
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:33,717
Don't you agree?

377
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,176
"Crazy act"?

378
00:26:36,886 --> 00:26:40,348
I dated a guy at work
and was humiliated once.

379
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,684
Now I'm doing it again.
So it's a crazy act.

380
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:47,856
I guess you're right.

381
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:54,696
I'm not mad at you.

382
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:56,990
I'm mad that I missed
the cold air moving south.

383
00:26:58,491 --> 00:26:59,868
I know.

384
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:03,246
Okay, then. I'll get going first.

385
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:06,416
Can I come to your place tonight?

386
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:09,711
Bring a bottle of Pinot Noir.

387
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:10,879
Okay!

388
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:19,262
Get it together, Forecaster Lee!

389
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:20,847
Yes, ma'am.

390
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:34,361
Director Jin is really angry.

391
00:27:34,944 --> 00:27:36,571
I got scolded a lot.

392
00:27:36,654 --> 00:27:38,823
I didn't know she was so testy.

393
00:27:39,532 --> 00:27:40,992
Did I say anything?

394
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:44,746
Right.

395
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:13,817
Why don't you use the washing machine?

396
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:19,155
Hasn't Ha-kyung called?

397
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:24,536
People talk about
dogs having rights these days.

398
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:28,331
You didn't even ask her opinion
before giving her information

399
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:30,542
to a matchmaking service to grade her.

400
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:32,919
That's so anachronistic and outdated.

401
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:36,005
I didn't do it for me.

402
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:38,716
If she marries a suitable man,

403
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,803
her life will be easier,
and I'll be proud.

404
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:43,179
Wouldn't that be nice?

405
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:45,724
I devoted my whole life to raising her.

406
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:47,308
A parent can expect that much.

407
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:50,895
Mom, you're being greedy.

408
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:52,313
Be quiet.

409
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:53,690
Go do your work.

410
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:57,277
I don't want to hear you whine
when the deadline is around the corner.

411
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:11,124
Should I call her?

412
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:16,087
No. I have my pride, you know.

413
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:24,179
-Goodness.
-You drink it, Mom.

414
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:41,988
Is something upsetting you?

415
00:29:42,989 --> 00:29:44,073
No.

416
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:45,617
Did you fight with your husband?

417
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:47,410
No, I didn't.

418
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:49,496
What did you fight about? In-laws?

419
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:51,915
Conflicting personalities?
Does he want to have a kid?

420
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:53,082
I said we didn't fight.

421
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,337
May I sit here?

422
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:00,089
Gosh. Hello, Deputy Director Han.

423
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:01,257
Enjoy your lunch.

424
00:30:03,426 --> 00:30:05,053
Why didn't you bring bulgogi?

425
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:06,471
It looks really tasty today.

426
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:09,224
Here. I'll give you mine.

427
00:30:16,564 --> 00:30:18,566
Yu-jin loves meat.

428
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:21,236
But she never really gains weight.

429
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:23,238
She must have won the genetic lottery.

430
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:24,739
Sure.

431
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:26,032
I guess so.

432
00:30:31,287 --> 00:30:32,956
Excuse me. I have to answer this.

433
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:38,378
What are you doing?

434
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:42,382
I'm saving your face.

435
00:30:42,465 --> 00:30:44,050
What? You don't like it?

436
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:46,135
Should I make it obvious that we fought?

437
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:47,554
We didn't fight.

438
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:49,264
You were the one--

439
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:51,140
What did you talk about with that jerk?

440
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:54,561
Hello.

441
00:30:57,105 --> 00:31:00,275
That punk was so proud in front of me.

442
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:02,569
He didn't feel sorry or guilty at all.

443
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:04,529
He had no reason to be

444
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:05,989
because it's over between us.

445
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:08,658
Are you siding with him?

446
00:31:09,158 --> 00:31:10,827
You know I'm not.

447
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:13,663
Anyway, don't run into him,
not even by chance.

448
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:16,791
If you do, don't say hi to him.

449
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,376
Don't even look at him, okay?

450
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:20,587
Why don't you just tell me to quit my job?

451
00:31:21,754 --> 00:31:23,464
-Would you?
-Ki-jun.

452
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,216
Reporters can work

453
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,886
at the police station
or the prosecutors' office too.

454
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:30,555
Why don't you move to another office?

455
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:31,890
Come on.

456
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:34,559
I can't leave Headquarters.
This is the perfect place to be.

457
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:36,477
And listen to me, Yu-jin.

458
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:39,230
You better stop talking back to me.

459
00:31:39,814 --> 00:31:41,524
I won't tolerate it anymore.

460
00:31:42,358 --> 00:31:44,235
What will you do if I don't stop?

461
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:48,656
Anyway, don't ever lie to me again, okay?

462
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:52,452
Gosh, I'm sorry.
That was an urgent call from home.

463
00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:53,703
Go on. The soup will get cold.

464
00:31:53,786 --> 00:31:55,872
-Okay.
-Eat up, Honey.

465
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:13,264
Eat up.

466
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:16,851
You're making me embarrassed
in front of her.

467
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:20,271
You know, Yu-jin cares about me so much.

468
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:21,314
I can see that.

469
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:22,815
Goodness.

470
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:25,443
It's so good.

471
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:42,627
-One Americano, please.
-Sure.

472
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:47,840
I heard Director Jin got furious
because a rookie corrected her.

473
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:51,010
Come on. It wasn't that bad.

474
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:53,304
I heard Kim Soo-jin

475
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:56,224
from your team complaining about it.

476
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:58,559
She said that Director Jin got mad

477
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:01,062
and made the team
analyze ten years' worth of data.

478
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:05,108
Don't you think it's wrong
to take it out on people like that?

479
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:08,194
You must be having a hard time.

480
00:33:08,277 --> 00:33:10,405
It was nice when Director Choi was around.

481
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:11,656
Well…

482
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:13,783
I'm sure she'll do well.

483
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:16,119
Here's your Americano.

484
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:18,579
Every time I see her,

485
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:20,999
I get scared
because she seems so heartless.

486
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:23,584
-Right.
-Don't say that.

487
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:04,542
Director Jin.

488
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:07,837
Did you have lunch?

489
00:34:09,797 --> 00:34:11,591
Yes, I just did. What about you?

490
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:13,718
We had kalguksu outside.

491
00:34:13,801 --> 00:34:16,054
I see. It must have been good.

492
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:20,933
By the way, didn't you say
you were staying at the training center?

493
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:21,851
Yes.

494
00:34:21,934 --> 00:34:25,146
Then how did you cross paths
with Director Jin this morning?

495
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,565
The center is right there.

496
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:36,824
I…

497
00:34:41,287 --> 00:34:43,372
This is Kim Soo-jin of Chief Team Two.

498
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:45,750
It's about the rain echo
over Seoul just now.

499
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:47,543
Echo?

500
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:51,047
Please hold.

501
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:54,967
Senior Forecaster Um,
it's the Metropolitan Office.

502
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:56,969
They're saying the rain echo
over Seoul looks abnormal.

503
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:59,055
-Could you take a look?
-What?

504
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,681
Okay.

505
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:02,517
What?

506
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:08,689
NATIONAL METEOROLOGICAL CENTER
COMPREHENSIVE CONTROL SYSTEM

507
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,567
Why is this…

508
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:17,865
-You went house-hunting in the morning?
-Yes, house-hunting.

509
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:21,619
I guess the landlord was really busy,

510
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:23,579
so he must have been available only then.

511
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:24,580
Right?

512
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:26,249
Yes, that's right.

513
00:35:26,332 --> 00:35:29,293
The landlord said he was busy. Yes.

514
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:35,508
I'm sure you didn't go with him,
but you know so much.

515
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:42,098
Right.

516
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:05,788
Oh, my goodness.

517
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:14,338
INNOVATIVE WEATHER SERVICES
A STEPPING STONE TO PUBLIC SAFETY

518
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:24,974
It's raining.

519
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:29,020
What should we do?

520
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:35,902
Let's go!

521
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:39,447
Hurry!

522
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:55,379
Mom, did the weather forecast
say it'd rain?

523
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:57,757
-Goodness.
-Oh, my gosh!

524
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,300
No, it didn't.

525
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:02,845
If it did,
I wouldn't have washed the comforters.

526
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:04,764
Gosh, my back.

527
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:07,141
Goodness.

528
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:10,228
All hell will break loose.

529
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:19,320
Hey, KMA! What are you doing?

530
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:21,155
Why didn't you forecast this downpour?

531
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:23,908
That's why they say
you never get anything right!

532
00:37:23,991 --> 00:37:24,992
Darn it!

533
00:37:29,538 --> 00:37:33,000
AUTOMATIC CONTROL PANEL

534
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:48,182
What?

535
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:49,684
-What's going on?
-Is it a blackout?

536
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:51,102
-Damn it.
-Did the power go out?

537
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:53,396
-What's going on?
-What's happening?

538
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:55,273
-What?
-Is it a short circuit?

539
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:56,816
-What?
-What's wrong?

540
00:37:56,899 --> 00:37:58,317
Find a candle.

541
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:01,529
The entire building has no power.

542
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:02,947
What are you going to do?

543
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,490
Do you know how much damage this is?

544
00:38:05,157 --> 00:38:07,618
Quit forecasting weather
if you can't even predict rainfall.

545
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:08,828
You're wasting our taxes.

546
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:11,789
Are you going to pay for the damages?

547
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:15,918
Why didn't you monitor this?

548
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:18,170
I did.

549
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:19,422
But…

550
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:22,508
I missed it.

551
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:26,345
Why? What were you doing?

552
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:32,101
What's wrong with you these days?
Are you doing this on purpose?

553
00:38:32,184 --> 00:38:34,353
Director Jin,
I don't think you should say…

554
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:36,981
Missing real-time monitoring
is a dereliction of duty.

555
00:38:37,064 --> 00:38:39,775
Depending on the extent of damage,
you may be dismissed.

556
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:44,322
He would have had only five minutes

557
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:45,948
if he hadn't missed the rain echo.

558
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:48,659
The flooding couldn't have been
prevented anyway.

559
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:50,328
The damage would have been smaller.

560
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:52,496
How? It's raining 80mm per hour.

561
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:53,789
That's enough.

562
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:55,041
I'm sorry.

563
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:56,917
It was my fault. So stop.

564
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:03,549
I'm sorry.

565
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:07,011
I missed the rain echo
because I was analyzing data.

566
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:10,890
What are you saying?

567
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:17,104
Honestly, isn't it impossible
to analyze ten years' worth of data

568
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:18,522
in one day?

569
00:39:19,106 --> 00:39:21,400
If I had been monitoring
the radar instead of analyzing--

570
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:23,527
You're terribly mistaken, Ms. Kim Soo-jin.

571
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:27,490
Both data analysis and live monitoring

572
00:39:27,573 --> 00:39:30,034
are very important tasks that we must do.

573
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:35,039
Missing one because of the other
is an excuse. Got it?

574
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:40,002
It's not an excuse.

575
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:44,632
I worked really hard to do well.

576
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:46,926
Soo-jin.

577
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:50,304
I'm really sorry
that I'm not very competent.

578
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:56,185
Still, I tried really hard,
so please don't belittle my effort.

579
00:40:03,859 --> 00:40:05,653
What a great team we make.

580
00:40:20,876 --> 00:40:22,711
Director Jin and Senior Forecaster Um.

581
00:40:23,295 --> 00:40:25,172
The Director General wants to see you.

582
00:40:26,048 --> 00:40:27,133
Okay.

583
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:35,558
As the stream swelled up,
the roads were flooded,

584
00:40:35,641 --> 00:40:38,018
twelve houses were submerged in water,

585
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:41,105
and electricity was cut off
in an underground shopping mall.

586
00:40:41,188 --> 00:40:44,650
We'll have to wait and see
exactly how much damage it caused.

587
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:46,777
Any casualties?

588
00:40:47,903 --> 00:40:49,029
Well…

589
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:50,990
Are there casualties?

590
00:40:51,073 --> 00:40:54,160
Two workers went missing
during a regular inspection

591
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:57,496
of drainage facilities at
the Anreung Rainwater Drainage Station.

592
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:03,252
How is the search going?

593
00:41:03,335 --> 00:41:07,089
The paramedics and
the facility management are at work.

594
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:09,717
We'll have to wait.

595
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,135
This is killing me.

596
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:13,512
I'm sorry.

597
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:16,056
I missed it.

598
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:18,142
It's my fault.

599
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:21,604
I'll take full responsibility.

600
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:37,578
-Why do you keep trying to look cool?
-What?

601
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:40,206
In front of the team members
and the Director General,

602
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:42,708
why did you say you'd take responsibility?

603
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:45,169
Because I missed the real-time conditions.

604
00:41:45,252 --> 00:41:47,171
So why did you miss it?

605
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:49,173
You said you were the Um Dong-han

606
00:41:49,256 --> 00:41:52,051
who could predict rain
just by smelling the east wind.

607
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:54,803
How could you miss it
right before your eyes?

608
00:41:58,557 --> 00:41:59,725
What?

609
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:02,937
Does it bother you that I'm your superior?

610
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:05,564
No. How many times do I have to tell you--

611
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:07,274
It doesn't matter.

612
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:09,443
Since I'm the director of Chief Team Two,

613
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:12,154
I'll take responsibility for your actions.

614
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:14,573
So don't you dare say that you will.

615
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:17,743
You're overstepping your authority.

616
00:42:37,179 --> 00:42:40,057
People think weather
and climate are the same,

617
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:42,184
but they are actually different.

618
00:42:46,021 --> 00:42:49,024
While weather changes
from day to day like feelings,

619
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:51,610
climate doesn't change easily

620
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:54,029
because it's like
an innate personality of a person.

621
00:42:56,323 --> 00:42:58,784
When you don't know someone's personality,

622
00:42:58,867 --> 00:43:01,120
how could you flatter them?

623
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:08,460
Are you siding with Director Jin?

624
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:09,670
No.

625
00:43:10,379 --> 00:43:12,756
I'm telling you that I was wrong.

626
00:43:14,466 --> 00:43:18,053
While I only tried to predict the weather,

627
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:20,764
Director Jin tried to analyze in detail

628
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:23,309
how the current weather

629
00:43:23,392 --> 00:43:25,811
would affect people.

630
00:43:25,894 --> 00:43:28,439
Even if the same amount of rain
falls at the same time,

631
00:43:28,522 --> 00:43:31,233
the impact varies from region to region.

632
00:43:32,526 --> 00:43:34,945
When it rains 80mm per hour,

633
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:36,822
Yeoksam will be fine,

634
00:43:36,905 --> 00:43:40,117
but Gangnam will be flooded
because the ground is lower.

635
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:46,040
A forecast should be
able to reflect that as well.

636
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:49,668
So it's important to analyze
as much data as possible.

637
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:57,760
She asked us to analyze
ten years' worth of data

638
00:43:57,843 --> 00:43:59,803
to make consumer-centered forecasts,

639
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:03,682
not producer-centered forecasts.

640
00:44:03,766 --> 00:44:06,435
So I was only thinking about performance,

641
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:10,564
and she was thinking
of people who really needed

642
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:12,858
a weather forecast.

643
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:19,031
It's a little difficult.

644
00:44:21,116 --> 00:44:22,284
It is.

645
00:44:37,424 --> 00:44:39,510
What do you think of your team members?

646
00:44:40,302 --> 00:44:41,345
Pardon?

647
00:44:42,596 --> 00:44:44,807
Taking responsibility is important.

648
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:46,642
But…

649
00:44:46,725 --> 00:44:49,436
you aren't the only one
who is working responsibly.

650
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:52,231
We're all professionals at what we do.

651
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:57,027
I'm saying we work
with a sense of responsibility.

652
00:45:00,572 --> 00:45:02,116
You trust us

653
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:04,201
to do the work you assign us, don't you?

654
00:45:04,284 --> 00:45:07,371
Actually, I don't think
the team members have faith in me.

655
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:10,541
They don't have confidence in my orders.

656
00:45:12,292 --> 00:45:15,337
It's not your orders
that we don't have confidence in.

657
00:45:15,421 --> 00:45:18,215
We don't have confidence in you

658
00:45:18,298 --> 00:45:20,217
because you aren't sure about your orders.

659
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:25,389
Oh, right.

660
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:27,599
Here.

661
00:45:27,683 --> 00:45:31,437
I analyzed data related to localized
heavy rain over the past ten years.

662
00:45:31,937 --> 00:45:33,939
In addition to
the main causes of heavy rain,

663
00:45:34,022 --> 00:45:36,775
I included cases such as
coupled upper and lower jet streams

664
00:45:36,859 --> 00:45:39,027
and lower convergence
and upper divergence.

665
00:45:39,111 --> 00:45:39,987
Take a look.

666
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:42,948
Well…

667
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:46,368
I finished what you asked me to do,
so I'll go home.

668
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:48,912
Aren't you going home?

669
00:45:53,459 --> 00:45:54,877
Yes, Mother.

670
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,670
Did the kids get soaked?

671
00:45:58,255 --> 00:46:00,090
I know.

672
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:04,178
Exactly.

673
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:08,182
I work at the KMA,
but my kids get rained on.

674
00:46:31,705 --> 00:46:33,373
Hi, Yu-jin. It's me.

675
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:36,710
I'm on my way out. Wait for me.

676
00:46:37,336 --> 00:46:40,088
What do you want for dinner, baby?

677
00:46:40,172 --> 00:46:43,133
Oh, tteokbokki.

678
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:45,344
Okay. I'll buy you everything.

679
00:46:48,805 --> 00:46:50,265
No problem.

680
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:01,527
-Good luck.
-Good work.

681
00:47:04,196 --> 00:47:06,490
-Are you going home?
-Yes. You?

682
00:47:06,573 --> 00:47:07,407
I will.

683
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:09,952
Everyone left. I'm the last one.

684
00:47:19,461 --> 00:47:24,174
ANREUNG RAINWATER DRAINAGE STATION

SEARCH FOR MISSING PEOPLE

688
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:35,561
MISSING WORKERS: 2 PEOPLE

689
00:47:51,243 --> 00:47:53,036
Do you see anything?

690
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:54,705
-Over there.
-Shine the light here.

691
00:47:54,788 --> 00:47:56,540
-Search over there too.
-Okay.

692
00:47:56,623 --> 00:47:58,375
We don't have much time.

693
00:47:58,458 --> 00:48:00,669
-We need to hurry up.
-We should check there.

694
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:04,339
-I think they might be there.
-Shine the light over there.

695
00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:28,488
DANGER

696
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:29,906
What are you doing here?

697
00:48:30,532 --> 00:48:31,450
Hey.

698
00:48:31,533 --> 00:48:34,077
I couldn't go to sleep anyway.

699
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:36,496
If I lurk around,

700
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:39,791
they'll think that
I have some moral sense at least.

701
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:43,170
-What about the workers?
-No news yet.

702
00:48:54,973 --> 00:48:56,224
Thank you.

703
00:49:16,953 --> 00:49:20,290
The person you are trying
to reach is unavailable…

704
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:21,833
She's not picking up.

705
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:27,172
Which one will she like more?

706
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:09,589
RESTRICTED
KEEP OUT

707
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:12,718
We found them!

708
00:50:12,801 --> 00:50:14,678
They're both okay here!

709
00:50:15,804 --> 00:50:17,389
-Here.
-Careful.

710
00:50:17,472 --> 00:50:19,182
-Where?
-Please let it down carefully.

711
00:50:20,016 --> 00:50:21,685
Are you okay, sir?

712
00:50:21,768 --> 00:50:24,438
-Can you move?
-Are you okay?

713
00:50:25,147 --> 00:50:27,357
Over here. Move them here.

714
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:30,068
-A little more. Watch your hands!
-Are they conscious?

715
00:50:30,652 --> 00:50:32,112
Thank goodness.

716
00:50:32,946 --> 00:50:34,698
What a relief.

717
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:40,120
Did you have dinner?

718
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:42,080
No. You?

719
00:50:43,248 --> 00:50:45,125
Let's go and have some hot soup.

720
00:50:47,169 --> 00:50:48,879
Bring them here!

721
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:05,061
What?

722
00:51:06,104 --> 00:51:07,439
Did you leave home?

723
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:12,402
Yes.

724
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:14,780
It's a long story.

725
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:24,331
Doors opening.

726
00:51:28,126 --> 00:51:29,419
Wait.

727
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:31,630
Thank you.

728
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:35,675
-What floor are you going to?
-Twelfth floor, please.

729
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:37,844
Doors closing.

730
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:52,150
I guess you live right above me.

731
00:51:52,234 --> 00:51:53,693
Are you apartment number 1301?

732
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:55,111
Or 1302?

733
00:51:56,196 --> 00:51:57,572
I'm 1302.

734
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:59,616
I see.

735
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:04,621
We're neighbors.

736
00:52:05,288 --> 00:52:07,332
My sister lives in 1201.

737
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:14,005
Bye.

738
00:52:27,102 --> 00:52:28,728
What?

739
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:42,951
What?

740
00:52:43,451 --> 00:52:44,661
Did she change it?

741
00:53:38,381 --> 00:53:39,758
Who could that be?

742
00:53:54,022 --> 00:53:55,357
Hello.

743
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,025
Hi. What is it?

744
00:53:57,108 --> 00:53:58,777
I told you

745
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:00,820
my sister lived downstairs.

746
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:02,155
Yes. And?

747
00:54:02,238 --> 00:54:04,074
Well…

748
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:07,494
-please take these.
-What for?

749
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:10,163
Could you please hang on to these?

750
00:54:10,246 --> 00:54:13,416
She changed the passcode
and she won't pick up her phone.

751
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:15,377
Well, then…

752
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:17,462
Maybe you can ask the security guard.

753
00:54:18,171 --> 00:54:19,255
I know.

754
00:54:19,339 --> 00:54:20,840
I checked the security office,

755
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:22,842
but he's on patrol.

756
00:54:23,343 --> 00:54:25,387
These are kimchi and bulgogi

757
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:28,932
my aged mother made for her daughter
in this hot weather.

758
00:54:29,015 --> 00:54:30,266
What if they go bad?

759
00:54:31,309 --> 00:54:33,812
They're too heavy for me
to bring back home.

760
00:54:35,855 --> 00:54:37,399
Do me a favor.

761
00:54:37,482 --> 00:54:38,692
Please?

762
00:54:40,026 --> 00:54:41,319
We're neighbors.

763
00:54:41,403 --> 00:54:42,487
Right.

764
00:54:47,742 --> 00:54:50,495
Why don't you wait for their dad?

765
00:54:50,578 --> 00:54:52,580
He'll be late because of dinner at work.

766
00:54:52,664 --> 00:54:55,041
-Is that right?
-Thank you, Mother.

767
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:56,459
No problem.

768
00:54:56,543 --> 00:54:58,336
-Good night.
-Okay.

769
00:54:58,420 --> 00:54:59,963
-Good night.
-All right, pumpkin.

770
00:55:00,046 --> 00:55:01,673
Good boy. Let's go.

771
00:55:01,756 --> 00:55:03,091
-Good night.
-Bye.

772
00:55:03,174 --> 00:55:04,884
-Let's go.
-Okay.

773
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:06,428
-Take care.
-Bye.

774
00:55:06,511 --> 00:55:08,263
-Go.
-Let's go.

775
00:55:08,346 --> 00:55:09,264
Okay.

776
00:55:09,889 --> 00:55:11,558
Are you sleepy?

777
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:14,686
Dad!

778
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:16,688
-Hey.
-What?

779
00:55:17,397 --> 00:55:19,232
You're here early.

780
00:55:19,315 --> 00:55:21,192
You said you were having dinner.

781
00:55:22,068 --> 00:55:23,862
I didn't go.

782
00:55:24,946 --> 00:55:26,031
Why not?

783
00:55:27,699 --> 00:55:30,326
I had some stuff to think about.

784
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:33,872
What's wrong?

785
00:55:35,373 --> 00:55:36,666
What is it?

786
00:55:38,501 --> 00:55:39,544
Honey.

787
00:55:41,129 --> 00:55:44,632
Can I take the Grade Five
technical exam again?

788
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:46,342
What?

789
00:55:47,719 --> 00:55:49,679
What about your work?

790
00:55:53,349 --> 00:55:55,477
I'm thinking of taking a year off.

791
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:56,686
Can I do that?

792
00:55:59,939 --> 00:56:01,024
Well…

793
00:56:03,276 --> 00:56:04,986
No.

794
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:09,574
People may say that it's okay
to make mistakes,

795
00:56:09,657 --> 00:56:12,035
but we should never make mistakes.

796
00:56:12,118 --> 00:56:13,745
You're right about that,

797
00:56:14,496 --> 00:56:16,998
but we shouldn't say
we'd take responsibility.

798
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:20,960
Predicting and forecasting

799
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:24,255
the uncertain future weather diligently

800
00:56:24,339 --> 00:56:25,882
is our job.

801
00:56:26,883 --> 00:56:29,135
But assuming responsibility

802
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:31,221
for the things that may happen?

803
00:56:31,304 --> 00:56:32,680
That's absurd.

804
00:56:34,557 --> 00:56:37,894
You were the one who said it first.

805
00:56:37,977 --> 00:56:39,979
That's because I made a mistake.

806
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:43,066
I'll be responsible
for the mistake I made.

807
00:56:43,733 --> 00:56:45,193
That's what I'm saying.

808
00:56:46,277 --> 00:56:49,489
"Our one little mistake can kill someone

809
00:56:49,572 --> 00:56:52,117
or make someone lose his entire fortune."

810
00:56:52,659 --> 00:56:54,828
"Stay alert all the time

811
00:56:54,911 --> 00:56:57,288
and look for signs and clues."

812
00:56:57,372 --> 00:56:58,414
Guess who said it.

813
00:56:58,498 --> 00:57:00,917
I don't know. Who said it?

814
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:05,797
Do you remember what you said
when you trained Grade Five officers

815
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:07,549
eight years ago?

816
00:57:07,632 --> 00:57:10,343
"All systems
responsible for national safety

817
00:57:10,426 --> 00:57:12,011
start with weather forecasting."

818
00:57:12,846 --> 00:57:15,598
"Therefore, a forecaster must have
a sense of duty first,

819
00:57:15,682 --> 00:57:17,725
and a sense of duty second."

820
00:57:19,644 --> 00:57:22,897
If I hadn't taken that class,
I wouldn't be struggling now.

821
00:57:22,981 --> 00:57:25,692
I would have been on the track
for a senior position.

822
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:31,239
Did I tell you to be fooled by that?

823
00:57:31,823 --> 00:57:33,158
It was your choice.

824
00:57:43,751 --> 00:57:45,837
So what happened to you since then?

825
00:57:46,963 --> 00:57:48,548
What's gotten into you?

826
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:52,677
Darn it.

827
00:57:54,929 --> 00:57:56,139
I think…

828
00:57:57,849 --> 00:58:00,351
I lost some kind of motivation.

829
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:02,020
What?

830
00:58:02,687 --> 00:58:06,024
For what? For what cause?

831
00:58:06,691 --> 00:58:10,111
For whom?
You need to have something like that.

832
00:58:13,865 --> 00:58:17,285
I don't have that anymore.

833
00:58:40,975 --> 00:58:45,230
Please wait.
Your transaction has been processed.

834
00:58:51,110 --> 00:58:52,987
Please accept your cash.

835
00:58:53,071 --> 00:58:54,572
Thank you very much.

836

Thank you for using our services.
Please make sure you do not leave…

838
00:59:21,891 --> 00:59:23,434
Be careful.

839
00:59:23,518 --> 00:59:26,020
Be careful. Here.

840
00:59:26,104 --> 00:59:28,231
My goodness. Please wait here.

841
00:59:28,314 --> 00:59:29,899
-Senior Forecaster Um.
-Yes.

842
00:59:29,983 --> 00:59:31,484
What's your home address?

843
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:35,196
Gangwon Province, Gangneung, Science…

844
00:59:35,905 --> 00:59:38,116
Your home in Seoul, not Gangwon Office.

845
00:59:38,199 --> 00:59:39,701
-I'll call a driver.
-What?

846
00:59:40,243 --> 00:59:41,119
Home?

847
00:59:43,288 --> 00:59:45,206
My home is…

848
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:48,418
I have no home.

849
00:59:49,043 --> 00:59:52,797
Gangwon… It's the KMA.

850
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:56,134
All right. I'll go to the KMA.

851
00:59:57,552 --> 00:59:58,803
The KMA…

852
01:00:31,002 --> 01:00:32,170
Mr. Lee Si-woo?

853
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:38,760
-Watch the steps.
-Okay.

854
01:00:50,938 --> 01:00:52,565
We have different personalities,

855
01:00:53,566 --> 01:00:55,318
different principles,

856
01:00:55,401 --> 01:00:57,987
and different wounds.

857
01:00:58,071 --> 01:00:59,572
So it is only natural

858
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:02,367
for the atmosphere to become unstable

859
01:01:02,450 --> 01:01:06,371
and an abnormal climate event
to appear when we meet.

860
01:01:06,454 --> 01:01:08,289
Why are you…

861
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:09,999
Why are you…

862
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:12,752
here?

865
01:02:11,644 --> 01:02:13,438
Your sister just called.

866
01:02:13,521 --> 01:02:15,565
Your mother is very sick.

867
01:02:15,648 --> 01:02:17,900
It seems pretty serious.

868
01:02:17,984 --> 01:02:20,486
She's not the type who'd listen to us.

869
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:22,280
I'm okay. You can go in first.

870
01:02:24,323 --> 01:02:26,617
You should make an investment

871
01:02:26,701 --> 01:02:28,619
if you want to date a young guy.

872
01:02:28,703 --> 01:02:31,581
-Don't tell me you met Director Jin.
-What the…

873
01:02:31,664 --> 01:02:34,041
My mind has been racing.

874
01:02:37,003 --> 01:02:38,337
Let's reconsider this.

875
01:02:39,046 --> 01:02:40,298
You and me.
