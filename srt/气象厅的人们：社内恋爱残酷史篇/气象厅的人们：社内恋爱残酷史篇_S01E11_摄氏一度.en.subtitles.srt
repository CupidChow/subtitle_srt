1
00:00:48,673 --> 00:00:50,216
EMERGENCY

2
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:06,024
This is Chief Team Two.

3
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:08,109
Yes.

4
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:11,029
What? An accident?

5
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:18,745
An accident? What accident?

6
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:21,539
Did someone get hurt?

7
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,673
Hurry up.

8
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:35,637
Hurry up.

9
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:38,264
Doctor!

10
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:39,599
It's an emergency patient.

11
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:42,727
Male in his late 20s.

12
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:46,147
He was injured in an explosion,
and he can't open his eyes.

13
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:47,565
His vitals are 100 over 60, 120bpm.

14
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:49,818
-This way. Hurry.
-Okay.

15
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:54,114
-Does he have a guardian?
-Here.

16
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:55,323
I'm his guardian.

17
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:57,534
Can you tell me his name first?

18
00:01:58,326 --> 00:02:00,912
Lee Si-woo. He works at the KMA.

19
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:04,249
Oh, no.

20
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,459
Why? Who is it?

21
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:08,670
It's Forecaster Lee.

22
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:16,302
He's badly hurt and in the hospital.

23
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,938
You should go, Forecaster Lee.

24
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:32,569
Go where?

25
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:34,320
To the Jeju Typhoon Center.

26
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:35,446
You should go.

27
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:41,035
Do you mean that?

28
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:44,205
I'm never half-hearted
when it comes to work.

29
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:47,208
That means

30
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:50,253
you've already made up your mind.

31
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,591
Yes. If it's all right with you.

32
00:02:57,552 --> 00:02:59,846
When body temperature drops by 1°C,

33
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:04,100
our body's immune system
weakens by as much as 30 percent.

34
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:08,771
Ha-kyung doesn't sincerely date anyone
if they're not a marriage prospect.

35
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:11,232
You knew that, right?

36
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:13,902
This means that

37
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:16,571
you become vulnerable to external attacks.

38
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:21,117
What?

39
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:23,244
What are you talking about?

40
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:24,746
I want some time apart.

41
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:27,749
I think that's best for both of us.

42
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:29,918
Yu-jin.

43
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:32,003
We need some time to think.

44
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:34,047
Let's evaluate our relationship.

45
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:38,343
Be honest. You need some time alone too.

46
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:50,188
There's still time,
so think about it and let me know.

47
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:53,733
No.

48
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:55,985
I'll go.

49
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,071
You can think about it.

50
00:03:58,154 --> 00:04:01,574
I don't have to. It's work.

51
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:03,952
I'll go.

52
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:10,667
Okay.

53
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:16,839
Do you have anything else to say?

54
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,258
No.

55
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:24,097
All right.

56
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:35,483
The same goes for
the temperature between people.

57
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:42,573
If you leave like this,

58
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:44,117
it's really over between us.

59
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:47,620
Have you thought about that?

60
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:53,626
If that's what you want,

61
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:55,503
we can do that.

62
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:19,485
The 77-4 bus will be arriving shortly.

63
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:50,767
There are times

64
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:53,478
when even the smallest word

65
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:57,648
or even the smallest expression can turn
the temperature of our heart cold.

66
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:00,985
And…

67
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:09,702
There was an accident?
How badly hurt is he?

68
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:12,914
No, who am I speaking to?

69
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:15,541
-Can you tell me what hospital--
-This is Chae Yu-jin.

70
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:27,261
I'm with Si-woo right now.

71
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:32,475
As soon as the temperature
of our heart drops even by one degree,

72
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:36,646
we can't help
but become sensitive and vulnerable

73
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:39,273
to all external environments.

74
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:58,126
EPISODE 11
1

75
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:00,169
2 DAYS AGO

76
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:51,304
The continuous heatwave

77
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:54,182
is exhausting
our body and mind these days.

78
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:57,310
A heatwave advisory has been issued
in most parts of the west

79
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:59,228
and the Yeongnam area today,

80
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:02,440
and a heatwave warning
is also in effect in Gwangju.

81
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:07,153
INNOVATIVE WEATHER SERVICES
A STEPPING STONE TO PUBLIC SAFETY

82
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:10,531
Jeez. No news of rain?

83
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:11,866
Less than 5mm of rain will fall

84
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:14,535
on the east coast
due to the influence of the east wind,

85
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:16,662
but it'll be limited
to some areas of Gangwon.

86
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:19,499
We can't call it rain then.

87
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,293
Goodness, it's burning red.

88
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:24,962
The Ministry of the Interior and Safety
will announce on the news

89
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:26,631
what to do in the event of a heatwave.

90
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:30,301
And local governments will put more effort
into securing heat reduction facilities.

91
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:31,344
Okay.

92
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:35,014
The local government offices
will be worn out.

93
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:37,266
-What can we do?
-What do you want to do this weekend?

94
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,727
It's the last weekend before I leave.

95
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:41,979
What are you doing?

96
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:43,773
What?

97
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:46,859
Aren't we in a meeting?

98
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:48,569
Yes.

99
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:51,197
Please prepare an impact forecast
for each region.

100
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:54,659
How about duck soup in Gapyeong?

101
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:57,119
Especially duck soup in Gapyeong…

102
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,162
What?

103
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:06,546
I'm sorry.

104
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:09,549
Especially in the southern
and western coastal areas,

105
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:12,677
please control the water temperature
and install shading nets in farms.

106
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:15,471
Please ask the media to refrain

107
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,765
from making provocative comments
regarding the heatwave.

108
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:19,225
I'll do my best.

109
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:20,309
Okay.

110
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,062
That's all for today's meeting.

111
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:24,981
-Well done.
-Good work.

112
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,357
-Good work.
-Good work.

113
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,568
Duck soup in Gapyeong sounds good.

114
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:31,529
By the way, have you decided?

115
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:36,117
-Who's going to the typhoon center?
-Oh, yes.

116
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:39,537
-Is it already that time of the year?
-Yes, it is.

117
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,205
Who's going this time?

118
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:43,291
I don't know, but I hope it isn't me.

119
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:48,421
Haven't you decided yet?

120
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,592
I'm going.

121
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:56,887
What? When was it decided?

122
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:58,139
Yesterday.

123
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:01,434
-Congratulations on being chosen.
-Congratulations.

124
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:04,812
Forecaster Lee and Director Jin,
come to my office.

125
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:06,063
Yes, sir.

126
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:13,446
Hi, Bo-mi. Yes.

127
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:16,657
Okay.

128
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:19,243
I want to go to Jeju Island.

129
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:21,829
You seem excited to go to Jeju Island.

130
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:24,665
No, I'm excited
to go to the typhoon center.

131
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:26,792
I've always wanted to work there.

132
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:29,086
You know I like to be on site.

133
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,380
You said you wanted
to work at Headquarters.

134
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,132
Now you want to be on site.

135
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:35,676
Because I'm quite good
at handling multiple tasks.

136
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:39,388
That's great. Good luck to you.

137
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:42,391
Why are you acting like this?
You told me to go.

138
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:47,063
Anyway, going to Gapyeong
for duck soup isn't a good idea.

139
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:17,676
The briefing of July 29th will begin.

140
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,846
Currently, the lower atmosphere is filled
with hot and humid air,

141
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:24,350
and the upper layer is filled
with dry and hot air in Korea.

142
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:26,477
The cause of the heatwave is

143
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,522
the expansion of the North Pacific's
anticyclone in the south of Korea

144
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:30,731
and the influence

145
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:33,234
of the Tibetan anticyclone
in the inland of China.

146
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:45,746
ELECTRONIC CIVIL SERVICE CENTER
DIVORCE

147
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:53,671
PETITION FOR DIVORCE

148
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:25,161
What was that for?

149
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:28,539
I thought you weren't coming.

150
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:31,000
I told you I had one more field trip.

151
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,334
When is it over?

152
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:35,045
I have a weather chart drawing class left.

153
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:37,339
Do you want to have lunch
with me after that?

154
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:38,883
At the KMA cafeteria?

155
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:39,925
It's really good.

156
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:41,218
Well…

157
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:43,012
okay.

158
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:47,016
What time?

159
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:49,101
Call me when you're done.

160
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:50,561
I'll come, okay?

161
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:51,729
Okay.

162
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:55,065
Pardon? Tomorrow?

163
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:56,192
Yes.

164
00:12:57,651 --> 00:12:59,612
-Is it too soon?
-Of course, it is.

165
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:01,280
I thought he'd go next week.

166
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:04,617
You know how impatient Director Sung
of the typhoon center is.

167
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:09,121
She's been pestering me since last week
about dispatching an officer.

168
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:12,958
She said that he should be familiar
with related tasks in advance

169
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:16,504
so that there will be no mistakes
even if a typhoon comes suddenly.

170
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:17,838
What can I say to that?

171
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:20,633
Still, you know how busy Headquarters is

172
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:23,093
because of the heatwave.

173
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:26,847
You can cover
the severe weather conditions there,

174
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:28,057
can't you?

175
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:30,434
-Well…
-That's not right.

176
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:32,937
I told him yesterday that he'd be going.

177
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:35,481
-He needs time to get ready.
-It's okay.

178
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:38,734
It's okay, right?

179
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:41,946
Yes. I can cover
the severe weather conditions there,

180
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:43,364
so it won't be a problem.

181
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:45,032
It's done then.

182
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:47,701
You can leave on the weekend.

183
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:48,953
Okay. We're done here.

184
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:52,331
Jeez.

185
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:05,219
Why did you say yes just like that?

186
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:07,721
You aren't ready.
How will you go there tomorrow?

187
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:10,182
You said you didn't want
duck soup in Gapyeong.

188
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:13,811
I have no plans for the weekend,
so I'll go work at the typhoon center.

189
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:17,106
Is this a joke or are you really upset?

190
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:19,149
Half and half.

191
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,653
Let's talk to the Director General again.

192
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,738
Why do you

193
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:26,907
keep confusing me?

194
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:31,120
What do you mean?

195
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:34,373
I thought you wanted
some time alone away from me.

196
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:38,294
Isn't that why you asked me
to go to Jeju Island?

197
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:42,047
Now that I'm leaving tomorrow,
why are you acting like this?

198
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:48,220
I think you're mistaken.

199
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:52,057
I never let my personal feelings
intervene in my work.

200
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:54,643
It's never happened
in my previous relationships.

201
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:01,817
You don't have to talk
to the Director General again.

202
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,445
I'll go to Jeju Island tomorrow,

203
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:05,905
Director Jin.

204
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:28,218
-Reporter Cho.
-Yes?

205
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:31,013
Didn't Reporter Chae come
to the KMA today?

206
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,059
Well, I heard she took a leave.

207
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:36,518
Didn't you know?

208
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,730
Was that today?

209
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:41,482
Yes.

210
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:44,777
I'm so forgetful these days.

211
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,820
-Okay. Bye.
-Take care.

212
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:06,298
WEATHER

213
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:17,977
KI-JUN

214
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:29,488
You're on leave?

215
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,493
Are you really going to do this?
Where are you?

216
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:37,746
Come home. Let's talk face to face.

217
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:49,758
FLIGHT RESERVATION

218
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:54,430
FROM SEOUL TO JEJU ISLAND

219
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,890
BOOK A FLIGHT

220
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,450
Yu-jin.

221
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,526
What's up with the atmosphere in here?

222
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:54,239
I think Director Jin and Forecaster Lee

223
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:57,451
are upset because of
the Jeju typhoon center.

224
00:17:57,534 --> 00:17:59,203
Do something about it,
Assistant Director Oh.

225
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:01,371
-Me?
-What?

226
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,710
Did you say something,
Assistant Director Oh?

227
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:07,711
Did I?

228
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,381
Well…

229
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:14,718
Director Jin.

230
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:17,721
Should we have a staff dinner?

231
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:23,018
A staff dinner?

232
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:25,270
Yes. Well…

233
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:27,689
Forecaster Lee is going
to Jeju Island tomorrow.

234
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:31,527
He'll be back soon
because it's a temporary dispatch,

235
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,779
but it'd be nice to have dinner together

236
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:35,572
to wish him good luck.

237
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:37,241
What do you think?

238
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:38,200
That's a great idea.

239
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,662
Yes, sure. A staff dinner.

240
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:44,331
Seok-ho, you're in, right?

241
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,501
-I have plans.
-Oh, I see.

242
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:49,545
Can you move it to some other day?

243
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:51,839
It's Chief Team Two's first staff dinner.

244
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:54,675
That's right. It's our first staff dinner.

245
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:57,052
Our team never had one before.

246
00:18:57,136 --> 00:19:00,681
Why don't you reschedule it
and join us, Assistant Director Shin?

247
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:02,182
No, it's too important.

248
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,059
I'm sorry.

249
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:07,813
Well, if you can't make it, it's okay.

250
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:08,981
All right.

251
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,233
Pardon?

252
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:14,278
Let's have a staff dinner
with whoever can make it.

253
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:16,363
Is that okay, Forecaster Lee?

254
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:19,658
Yes.

255
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:24,496
Then I'll make a reservation.

256
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:55,694
What's wrong?

257
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:57,988
We're having a staff dinner for you.

258
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:04,953
Why are you upset again?

259
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:07,706
"Again"?

260
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:11,418
When was I ever upset?
Why did you say "again"?

261
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:15,589
Since you told me to go to Jeju Island,

262
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:17,799
I've never acted like I was upset.

263
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:21,136
-What's wrong with you, kid?
-I'm not a kid.

264
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,554
I'm an adult.

265
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:24,097
I'm your man.

266
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,156
Hello.

267
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,533
-Hi. Enjoy your lunch.
-Thanks.

268
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:45,035
-Hello.
-Hello.

269
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:47,037
-Who is she?
-She's my daughter.

270
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,248
-Your daughter?
-You can go first.

271
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:50,290
-Go ahead.
-Thank you.

272
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:54,461
She's on a field trip.

273
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:56,213
I see. She's so pretty.

274
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:58,006
-Isn't she?
-Yes.

275
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:00,676
Oh, right.

276
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:04,554
Forecasters are the busiest people
at the KMA.

277
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:07,432
Everyone here knows that,
so they let me eat first

278
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:10,394
-to help me get back to work quickly.
-I see.

279
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:12,646
Thank you.

280
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:19,027
Have some vegetables.

281
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,992
There are sausages too.

282
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:27,828
I've had them since I was little.

283
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:29,830
They're really good.

284
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:38,630
Can we sit with you guys?

285
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,549
-Yes.
-Of course.

286
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:42,884
-I'll move over here.
-Okay. Thanks.

287
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,345
This is my daughter Um Bo-mi.

288
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:46,805
-Hi, Bo-mi.
-Hi.

289
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:49,141
-Hello.
-Nice to meet you.

290
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:52,144
They're my colleagues.
We're on the same team.

291
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:54,146
Hello.

292
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:55,397
-Hi.
-Hi.

293
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,524
-She's pretty.
-Isn't she?

294
00:21:57,607 --> 00:21:59,151
I guess she takes after her mom.

295
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:00,527
What do you mean?

296
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:03,697
What? I can see
that she resembles her dad too.

297
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:06,241
What brings you here to the KMA?

298
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,493
-Are you here to see your dad?
-She's on a field trip.

299
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:10,120
-Oh, field trip.
-I see.

300
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:12,914
-Do you like science?
-Yes.

301
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,667
How did you know?

302
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,461
These days, kids accumulate points

303
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:21,214
through going on field trips
that suit their aptitude.

304
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:22,341
-I see.
-I see.

305
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:24,384
You have his scientific brain too.

306
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:26,470
You're the spitting image of your dad.

307
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:28,597
-Am I?
-Don't you know?

308
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,891
Your dad is
the best meteorologist in Korea.

309
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:32,684
I'm not the best.

310
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:34,561
You are.

311
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:38,774
Try this, Bo-mi.

312
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:42,110
Senior Forecaster Um.

313
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:43,695
I didn't know you were so sweet

314
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:46,073
because you're so scary
in the situation room.

315
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:48,116
I'm jealous, Bo-mi.

316
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:51,953
Senior Forecaster Um.

317
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:53,997
Can I have a piece of ham please?

318
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:55,332
-What was that?
-What?

319
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:56,708
Can I?

320
00:22:57,375 --> 00:22:59,336
Eat what you have on your plate.

321
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:00,337
Okay.

322
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:02,297
Try it, Bo-mi.

323
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:05,008
Try it.

324
00:23:15,393 --> 00:23:16,728
-Isn't it good?
-Isn't it good?

325
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:26,571
Excuse me for a minute.

326
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:27,781
-Yes.
-Okay.

327
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:31,159
-Hello, Mother.
-Hi.

328
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:33,453
You need to take
the kids home early today.

329
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:35,956
-Pardon?
-Maybe it's the hot weather.

330
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:38,708
My eyes hurt. I'm not feeling well.

331
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:42,003
I'm sorry, Mother.

332
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:44,714
Chief Team Two is having
a staff dinner tonight.

333
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:48,260
A severe weather forecaster
is going to Jeju Island.

334
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:51,429
Our director arranged
this first staff dinner,

335
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:52,681
so I can't miss it.

336
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:56,101
Could you ask Jung-ho
to look after the kids just for today?

337
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:58,103
He's studying though.

338
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:05,819
I'll go home as soon as I can
after having dinner.

339
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:08,446
Okay.

340
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:13,994
Goodness, what should I do?

341
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:17,539
I suggested the staff dinner,
so I can't miss it.

342
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:28,466
I'm not a kid.

343
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:29,801
I'm an adult.

344
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:31,887
I'm your man.

345
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,724
Hey, we're at the KMA.

346
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:37,726
Then you should call me Forecaster Lee.

347
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:42,314
I know you want to draw clear lines

348
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:45,233
between the KMA, me, work, and dating.

349
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:47,319
I understand that,

350
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:49,988
and I want to cooperate
because I said I would.

351
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:51,156
But…

352
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:54,784
I'm me.

353
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:58,538
I'm not your ex-boyfriend Han Ki-jun.

354
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:00,373
It's me.

355
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:06,004
So don't drag him into our relationship.

356
00:25:06,087 --> 00:25:09,382
I know what it was like with him,
how he hurt you,

357
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:11,551
why you're so cautious
about dating at work,

358
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:14,763
and why you're so worried
about getting caught.

359
00:25:15,388 --> 00:25:17,140
But that was your past relationship.

360
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:19,100
Now you're with me.

361
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:23,271
You compare me to him every time,

362
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:25,482
and it really bothers me.

363
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:27,984
When have I compared you to him?

364
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,696
You keep me a secret.

365
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:34,532
Also, you keep me at a distance,

366
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:38,161
call me "kid,"
and don't take me seriously.

367
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:40,622
It's because you're worried that

368
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:42,415
I'd hurt you like Ki-jun did.

369
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:44,209
You're worried about

370
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,836
being embarrassed again.

371
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:49,422
-Hey, Si-woo.
-That's right.

372
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:51,132
I can't imagine being married.

373
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:52,926
I just can't get married.

374
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:57,097
Still, I want to love you.

375
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:01,142
Because…

376
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:05,063
I like you so much.

377
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:08,149
But…

378
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:12,195
if I confused you, then I'm sorry.

379
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:16,116
I'm sorry I jumped at you to love you

380
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:20,203
when I can't promise you anything.

381
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:21,204
But…

382
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:24,541
So…

383
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:28,378
if you want to rethink our relationship,

384
00:26:31,214 --> 00:26:32,132
you can.

385
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:37,178
But you need to be fully committed.

386
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:43,393
Having a lukewarm relationship
where we keep a moderate distance…

387
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:45,478
I can't do that.

388
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:48,898
What do you mean by that?

389
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:54,988
So…

390
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:58,700
while I'm away on Jeju Island,
think about it.

391
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:01,703
Whether you'll continue this relationship…

392
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:05,707
or not.

393
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:36,946
FATHER

394
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:03,890
Yes, this is Jin Ha-kyung.

395
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:09,729
I'll check and get back to you.

396
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:10,647
Yes.

397
00:28:13,274 --> 00:28:16,069
KMA HEATWAVE FORECAST

398
00:28:19,155 --> 00:28:21,408
THE WORST HEATWAVE EVER!
THERE'S NO END TO IT

399
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:23,660
PEOPLE ARE GROWING TIRED
OF THE MURDEROUS HEAT

400
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:29,958
This is driving me nuts.

401
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:33,545
I'm happy Bo-mi is here.

402
00:28:33,628 --> 00:28:34,587
Thank you.

403
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:39,426
Where's Bo-mi?

404
00:28:39,509 --> 00:28:40,635
She's in the bathroom.

405
00:28:40,718 --> 00:28:42,303
-Have something to drink.
-Can I?

406
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:43,930
-Yes.
-I want to try this.

407
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,933
-Is it good?
-Yes.

408
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:31,478
PETITION FOR DIVORCE

409
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:14,687
Are you okay?

410
00:30:15,271 --> 00:30:18,650
Please call my dad.

411
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:20,652
Goodness.

412
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:22,153
-I'm so glad.
-You should be.

413
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:23,613
I'm pretty fair-skinned.

414
00:30:23,696 --> 00:30:25,198
-What?
-She isn't just fair-skinned.

415
00:30:25,281 --> 00:30:26,574
Did you have lunch?

416
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:27,867
-Yes.
-Hi, Forecaster Lee.

417
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:31,204
-We ate already.
-Help! A student is down on the floor!

418
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:33,456
A student collapsed in the bathroom,

419
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,458
and she can't breathe!

420
00:30:37,043 --> 00:30:38,419
-Bo-mi.
-Oh, no!

421
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:40,129
-Please call 911!
-Okay.

422
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:48,429
EMERGENCY CENTER

423
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:50,807
What happened to Bo-mi?

424
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:52,809
I don't know.

425
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:55,854
She was fine when we were having lunch,

426
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:57,480
but she collapsed in the bathroom.

427
00:30:57,564 --> 00:31:00,859
She couldn't breathe
and had rashes on her face and neck.

428
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:02,277
What did she eat?

429
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,820
We ate in the cafeteria.

430
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:05,405
What were the side dishes?

431
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:09,117
Multi-grain rice.

432
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,744
Seaweed soup, ham, and shredded radish.

433
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:14,122
Did you give her ham?

434
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:15,540
Yes.

435
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:17,458
She's allergic to processed meat.

436
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:19,919
Did you forget that?

437
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:23,423
Try this, Bo-mi.

438
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:33,641
-Isn't it good?
-Isn't it good?

439
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:37,854
Goodness.

440
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:58,666
"The worst heatwave ever!
There's no end to it."

441
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,668
"People are growing tired
of the murderous heat."

442
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:03,963
I asked you to stop these articles
from being published.

443
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:08,426
Deputy Director Han!

444
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:10,511
Yu-jin left.

445
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:11,971
What?

446
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:13,765
She wants a separation.

447
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:16,726
Why?

448
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:21,898
What am I going to do, Ha-kyung?

449
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:45,129
Yes, Mom.

450
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:48,675
How are you? Is everything okay?

451
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:54,138
I called to hear your voice. I miss you.

452
00:32:57,558 --> 00:32:59,102
Ki-jun is doing well too.

453
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:03,731
She won't answer my calls.

454
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:06,109
She doesn't even check my texts.

455
00:33:06,192 --> 00:33:08,277
Why did this happen?

456
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:11,906
Was it because she had lived with Si-woo?

457
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,954
Or did something else happen?

458
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:19,163
Hey.

459
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:21,582
You know what?

460
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:23,710
When we were together,

461
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:27,088
you made me feel like
I was less important than your work.

462
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:32,093
And whenever I felt like I was really
less valuable than your work,

463
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:33,886
I was upset.

464
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:35,972
I also felt like an immature loser

465
00:33:36,055 --> 00:33:39,642
for getting upset over such a thing.

466
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:43,896
Was I like that?

467
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:45,690
Yes.

468
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,525
You're like that.

469
00:33:48,484 --> 00:33:50,403
When you say
let's not mix business with pleasure,

470
00:33:50,486 --> 00:33:51,863
you sound authoritative.

471
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:56,409
Of course I knew that you were
speaking to a spokesperson,

472
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:58,327
but I was your boyfriend first.

473
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:01,873
The way you spoke to me often upset me.

474
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:05,126
I know you want to

475
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:07,045
draw clear lines

476
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:09,172
between the KMA, me, work, and dating.

477
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:11,257
I understand that,

478
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:13,926
and I want to cooperate
because I said I would.

479
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:14,886
But…

480
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:17,180
But…

481
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:21,809
One day I realized that

482
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:24,270
I was doing the same thing to Yu-jin.

483
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:28,357
I compared her to you every time.

484
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:31,027
But that was your past relationship.

485
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,779
Now you're with me.

486
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:35,448
You compare me to him every time,

487
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:38,284
and it really bothers me.

488
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:44,207
Yu-jin is Yu-jin.

489
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:47,001
I'm me.

490
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:49,128
I'm not the Han Ki-jun
you dated in the past.

491
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:50,713
I'm me.

492
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:53,382
So don't get him involved
in your relationship with me.

493
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:10,775
Yes. Don't worry. I got everything.

494
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:12,985
You're here.

495
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:14,862
Senior Forecaster Um's daughter is okay.

496
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:17,865
It looks like the worst is over.

497
00:35:18,574 --> 00:35:19,784
I'm glad to hear that.

498
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:22,036
The staff dinner tonight--

499
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,872
Forecaster Lee will come
straight to the restaurant.

500
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:26,874
Mr. Um will check his daughter's condition

501
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:28,292
and join us later.

502
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:30,795
Okay.

503
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:48,729
Drink this.

504
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:50,606
Thanks.

505
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:00,491
Studying was the easiest thing
in the world.

506
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:05,872
Because you get good grades
when you know how to do it.

507
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:10,835
But the weather and family,

508
00:36:10,918 --> 00:36:13,212
I have no idea what to do with them.

509
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:16,340
There are no formulas

510
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:17,717
or manuals.

511
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:21,512
I don't know how to be a good dad.

512
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:24,974
What do I have to do

513
00:36:26,058 --> 00:36:28,060
to become a good head of my household?

514
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:34,025
Having such worries means that

515
00:36:34,775 --> 00:36:36,194
you're already a good father.

516
00:36:38,946 --> 00:36:40,323
You know,

517
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:42,408
I've never seen my father

518
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:45,411
worry about such a thing.

519
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:51,918
I'm just saying.

520
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:04,972
How's Bo-mi?

521
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:07,183
She's okay now.

522
00:37:07,808 --> 00:37:11,229
She needs to finish the IV treatment,

523
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:13,522
so she'll be discharged late at night.

524
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:15,816
You should go.

525
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:20,196
I thought her atopy was cured.

526
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:27,161
Do you think this kind of condition
can heal on its own?

527
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:30,456
I check what she eats and wears.

528
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:32,708
I even look after her while she sleeps.

529
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:34,543
That's why she's healthy.

530
00:37:37,129 --> 00:37:38,089
I'm sorry.

531
00:37:38,714 --> 00:37:39,590
For what?

532
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:41,509
I know nothing about Bo-mi,

533
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:44,345
but I pretended to be a good dad
and made her sick.

534
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,889
Exactly.

535
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:51,894
So don't even try
when you know nothing about her.

536
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:17,712
-Are you going out?
-What?

537
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:20,506
Yes. I have an interview.

538
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:22,300
Where are you going, Mom?

539
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:24,385
Where are you going at night?

540
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:26,971
Are you going to Ha-kyung's again?

541
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:30,224
Do you think I have nowhere else to go?

542
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:31,684
Don't you?

543
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:33,811
Don't be home late.

544
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:36,063
And don't drink too much.

545
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:45,656
MOTHER-IN-LAW

546
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:57,209
-Will you be okay?
-What?

547
00:38:57,293 --> 00:39:00,379
Isn't that your mother-in-law?
She keeps calling you.

548
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:03,174
I'm sure she'll call her son

549
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:05,217
if she needs help.

550
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:07,511
But he's studying.

551
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:11,432
And I'm the breadwinner
who works hard for the family.

552
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:14,560
I need a break like this
to catch my breath.

553
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:16,937
I'm going to eat,

554
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:19,690
drink, and get drunk tonight.
Let's go to a karaoke too.

555
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:25,196
By the way, where do you think
Assistant Director Shin went?

556
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:27,323
He usually goes straight home after work.

557
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:29,658
Does he have a girlfriend?

558
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:32,328
It wouldn't be strange if he had one.

559
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:37,416
-Director Jin. Over here.
-Over here.

560
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:48,344
I can see

561
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:51,097
you worked hard to draw these.

562
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,766
So what?

563
00:39:53,849 --> 00:39:56,894
I have no idea where to start.

564
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:01,107
Why did you choose a penguin?

565
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:03,484
Because it's cute.

566
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:05,403
Can you be more specific?

567
00:40:06,862 --> 00:40:09,448
First of all, it looks adorable,

568
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:11,534
and the way it walks is cute.

569
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:16,622
Waddle, waddle.

570
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:19,834
But…

571
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:23,754
it doesn't walk like that
because it wants to look cute.

572
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:25,464
Pardon?

573
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:29,802
The reason penguins waddle

574
00:40:29,885 --> 00:40:33,764
is because of the pendulum principle.

575
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:37,685
When the clock pendulum
reaches one vertex,

576
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:42,231
it stops for a moment to convert
potential energy into kinetic energy.

577
00:40:45,651 --> 00:40:46,569
Yes.

578
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:50,948
I didn't know that. And?

579
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:53,033
Pardon?

580
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:54,785
And?

581
00:40:55,661 --> 00:40:56,787
Well…

582
00:40:58,122 --> 00:41:01,375
-If it waddles like that,
-Yes.

583
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:04,753
it can store 80 percent
of its energy in its body.

584
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:06,130
It can store energy.

585
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:10,092
What's surprising is that

586
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:13,345
the principle is very scientific.

587
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:14,930
Is that so?

588
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:16,056
Yes.

589
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:20,311
Scientific principle…

590
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:24,773
Also…

591
00:41:25,524 --> 00:41:28,694
their blood vessels
are woven closely together.

592
00:41:28,777 --> 00:41:33,032
It's called "wonderful net."
The arteries and veins are intertwined.

593
00:41:33,115 --> 00:41:36,410
Gosh, you know so much.

594
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:39,038
I told you that you were a scientist.

595
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:40,331
No, I'm not.

596
00:41:46,879 --> 00:41:48,380
I guess everyone's running late.

597
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:51,008
Yes, they said they'd be late.

598
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:56,639
Why don't we order something? I'm hungry.

599
00:41:56,722 --> 00:41:58,432
Yes, please go ahead.

600
00:41:58,516 --> 00:41:59,600
Okay.

601
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:02,603
-What do you want?
-I think everyone eats pork belly here.

602
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:05,564
-Shall we get pork belly?
-Yes.

603
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:20,329
Hey.

604
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:31,090
Eat up. Young people like this, right?

605
00:42:31,173 --> 00:42:32,508
Yes.

606
00:42:32,591 --> 00:42:35,010
But why did you want to see me?

607
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:38,138
Let's eat first, then talk. Here.

608
00:42:48,482 --> 00:42:49,483
Well…

609
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:52,695
how is Ha-kyung?

610
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:58,117
She's probably very busy
because of the heatwave.

611
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:02,663
Did she say anything after I came by?

612
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:05,124
No. She didn't say anything.

613
00:43:07,459 --> 00:43:09,211
She caught me off guard that day.

614
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:12,965
She suddenly said
she wouldn't get married,

615
00:43:13,048 --> 00:43:17,595
so I totally lost my pace and backed off.

616
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:20,097
Well…

617
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:22,099
the bachelor upstairs--

618
00:43:22,182 --> 00:43:24,560
Seok-ho is not for her.

619
00:43:24,643 --> 00:43:25,686
Why not?

620
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:27,229
He doesn't get along with her.

621
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:30,190
Personality, tastes, hobbies, lifestyle…

622
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:32,109
None of them match.

623
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:34,361
I know them well.

624
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:37,990
You have to work things out
when you get married.

625
00:43:38,073 --> 00:43:40,951
Two people are raised by
different sets of parents.

626
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:43,120
They lived in
two different worlds for years.

627
00:43:43,203 --> 00:43:46,248
How can they be hand-in-glove overnight?

628
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:48,292
It'd be weird if they were.

629
00:43:50,836 --> 00:43:53,088
You're right about that.

630
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:55,007
A married couple

631
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:58,260
isn't a union of two complete people.

632
00:43:58,844 --> 00:44:00,220
Two people have to

633
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:03,390
come together and become one.

634
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:07,436
That process is called married life.

635
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:09,730
That's how a married couple
becomes complete.

636
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:12,816
Young people these days

637
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:17,821
think of marriage
as some kind of practical insurance.

638
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:19,907
That's why they can't even start.

639
00:44:20,407 --> 00:44:23,619
Because they look
at conditions and benefits first.

640
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:27,581
Haven't you ever regretted it?

641
00:44:28,248 --> 00:44:29,375
Regretted what?

642
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:31,502
Your marriage.

643
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:35,798
Well…

644
00:44:35,881 --> 00:44:37,716
I regret it every day.

645
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:41,387
I call him "that bastard."
And I say I hope he goes to hell.

646
00:44:42,012 --> 00:44:43,097
But…

647
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:46,642
if you ask me if I'd go back in time

648
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:51,355
and get married again, I think I would.

649
00:44:52,147 --> 00:44:53,357
Why?

650
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:58,237
There were good times
because we were together.

651
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,656
I had Tae-kyung and Ha-kyung.

652
00:45:00,739 --> 00:45:05,828
Those two are
the best works I've ever made.

653
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:09,957
Hey.

654
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:11,917
So--

655
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,753
Still, it's not right.

656
00:45:14,837 --> 00:45:17,506
Seok-ho isn't for her.

657
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:19,299
Never.

658
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:21,844
Why are you so stern?

659
00:45:21,927 --> 00:45:23,095
Who are you to say no?

660
00:45:27,641 --> 00:45:29,685
The pizza is getting cold.

661
00:45:29,768 --> 00:45:32,604
Let's eat. I'll give you a slice.

662
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:06,555
Today's staff dinner is a fail.

663
00:46:07,222 --> 00:46:08,223
What do you mean?

664
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:11,226
We're eating delicious food.
It's going very well.

665
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:13,228
Assistant Director Oh.

666
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:15,689
Did you forget
why we're having this dinner?

667
00:46:15,772 --> 00:46:17,733
Number one. Forecaster Lee is leaving.

668
00:46:17,816 --> 00:46:20,694
Number two. This is the first staff dinner

669
00:46:20,777 --> 00:46:22,488
of Chief Team Two.

670
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:25,407
What can we do?

671
00:46:25,908 --> 00:46:27,784
They don't want to come.

672
00:46:28,744 --> 00:46:30,996
Director Jin invited everyone,

673
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:33,457
but they aren't showing up.

674
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:35,042
There's nothing we can do.

675
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:39,671
Since they aren't here,
let's order two more portions.

676
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:43,008
We'll start the dinner again

677
00:46:43,091 --> 00:46:46,678
and call it Chief Team Two's
female pep rally.

678
00:46:46,762 --> 00:46:47,721
What do you say?

679
00:46:48,805 --> 00:46:50,057
Can we do that?

680
00:46:50,766 --> 00:46:51,808
All right.

681
00:46:51,892 --> 00:46:54,102
Ladies' dinner. I like that.

682
00:46:54,853 --> 00:46:57,272
Sir, give us
two more portions of pork belly

683
00:46:57,356 --> 00:46:59,483
-and soju please.
-Okay.

684
00:46:59,566 --> 00:47:00,651
Will you drink soju?

685
00:47:00,734 --> 00:47:03,237
Let's drink hard liquor
since we're starting over again.

686
00:47:03,862 --> 00:47:05,072
Are you okay with it?

687
00:47:06,073 --> 00:47:07,115
Thank you.

688
00:47:10,744 --> 00:47:13,080
Goodness.

689
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:17,876
-Let's drink.
-Yes.

690
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:19,086
All right.

691
00:47:22,422 --> 00:47:24,258
-How about karaoke?
-I love it.

692
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:25,759
-Okay.
-Okay.

693
00:47:25,842 --> 00:47:26,802
-Cheers.
-Okay.

694
00:47:28,011 --> 00:47:30,055
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

695
00:47:30,138 --> 00:47:31,265
Round three!

696
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:36,770
Wait. Let's go home.

697
00:47:36,853 --> 00:47:39,106
-What are you saying?
-Come on.

698
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:42,234
-You're such a good singer.
-She is.

699
00:47:42,776 --> 00:47:44,403
I'm a high soprano.

700
00:47:44,486 --> 00:47:49,324
-High soprano.
-Songs in low-keys aren't even songs.

701
00:47:49,408 --> 00:47:51,577
I'm a baritone.

702
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:53,495
I'm…

703
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:07,301
DIRECTOR JIN HA-KYUNG

704
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:29,740
Yes, Assistant Director Oh.

705
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:33,827
Where are you?

706
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:41,043
Director Jin is very drunk,

707
00:48:41,126 --> 00:48:43,795
but I have to go home.

708
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:46,632
I'm sorry but can you come here right now?

709
00:48:53,847 --> 00:48:55,182
I'm here.

710
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:00,854
Are you drunk?

711
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:04,358
Can you walk?

712
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:17,162
I want to make it work.

713
00:49:19,748 --> 00:49:22,292
I want things to work out between us.

714
00:49:28,548 --> 00:49:29,675
But…

715
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,345
this is all I can do.

716
00:49:35,889 --> 00:49:38,350
Loving someone moderately,

717
00:49:39,434 --> 00:49:40,977
liking them moderately,

718
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:43,689
and being moderately stable
is what I like to do.

719
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,693
When I go over that line,

720
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:51,905
I become anxious.

721
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:57,285
I feel like

722
00:49:58,328 --> 00:50:00,497
I'm a different person.

723
00:50:06,211 --> 00:50:07,504
So…

724
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:11,216
I can only do it moderately.

725
00:50:14,928 --> 00:50:16,930
Get up. Let's go home.

726
00:50:17,931 --> 00:50:19,933
So you decide.

727
00:50:21,476 --> 00:50:23,895
Go to Jeju Island and make a decision.

728
00:50:29,568 --> 00:50:33,655
Think carefully about whether
you can be with me in moderation or not

729
00:50:34,156 --> 00:50:36,616
and make a decision.

730
00:50:41,997 --> 00:50:45,667
A senior forecaster once said this.

731
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:50,088
"If you can't possibly understand
the satellite image,

732
00:50:50,756 --> 00:50:52,591
try observing

733
00:50:53,091 --> 00:50:56,344
the flow of clouds from a distance."

734
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:23,413
To be honest,
I didn't understand him back then.

735
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:27,626
I had never seen a satellite image
that I didn't understand,

736
00:51:27,709 --> 00:51:31,505
and I was more confident
about the weather than anyone else.

737
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:37,427
Then…

738
00:51:38,386 --> 00:51:39,888
I met you.

739
00:52:10,836 --> 00:52:12,212
Gosh, my head hurts.

740
00:52:21,263 --> 00:52:22,264
Hey.

741
00:52:41,032 --> 00:52:41,908
What?

742
00:52:42,409 --> 00:52:44,160
Are you going straight to the airport?

743
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:46,538
That's mine.

744
00:52:46,621 --> 00:52:47,706
You scared me.

745
00:52:51,793 --> 00:52:53,879
Are you going back home?

746
00:52:53,962 --> 00:52:56,089
It's typhoon season,

747
00:52:56,172 --> 00:52:58,008
so I'll stay at the KMA.

748
00:52:59,217 --> 00:53:00,468
What about Forecaster Lee?

749
00:53:00,552 --> 00:53:02,262
He left already.

750
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:03,471
Pardon?

751
00:53:03,555 --> 00:53:07,225
He left for Jeju Island today.
Didn't you know?

752
00:53:09,394 --> 00:53:12,898
Have some soup while it's hot.
You must be hungover.

753
00:53:38,924 --> 00:53:40,175
You know what?

754
00:53:40,759 --> 00:53:44,804
You were the most
unpredictable weather for me.

755
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:57,817
I…

756
00:53:59,527 --> 00:54:00,612
There was an accident?

757
00:54:00,695 --> 00:54:02,072
How badly hurt is he?

758
00:54:02,155 --> 00:54:03,073
No…

759
00:54:03,865 --> 00:54:05,158
Who am I speaking to?

760
00:54:05,241 --> 00:54:06,743
Can you tell me what hospital--

761
00:54:06,826 --> 00:54:08,286
This is Chae Yu-jin.

762
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:17,128
I'm with Si-woo right now.

763
00:54:45,573 --> 00:54:46,533
Hello?

764
00:54:47,659 --> 00:54:49,202
What's up at this hour?

765
00:54:51,579 --> 00:54:52,706
What?

766
00:54:56,584 --> 00:54:59,379
Ha-kyung. What's going on?

767
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:01,423
Si-woo is hurt.

768
00:55:01,506 --> 00:55:03,216
Okay, so he's hurt.

769
00:55:03,299 --> 00:55:05,135
Why is Yu-jin there with him?

770
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:07,470
-By chance.
-What?

771
00:55:08,596 --> 00:55:10,557
They ran into each other
on Jeju Island by chance.

772
00:55:14,728 --> 00:55:16,604
EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

773
00:55:35,915 --> 00:55:37,167
Goodness.

774
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:46,009
This is all because of you.

775
00:55:46,593 --> 00:55:47,927
Why is this because of me?

776
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:50,096
Because our failed relationship

777
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:51,806
left me wounded,

778
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:54,142
I was really edgy and cranky toward him.

779
00:55:54,726 --> 00:55:59,272
Well, you were edgy and cranky
when you were with me too.

780
00:55:59,355 --> 00:56:01,274
Because of you,

781
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:04,069
I got scared.

782
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:06,821
I was scared of getting hurt again.

783
00:56:07,655 --> 00:56:09,532
So I couldn't show him how I felt.

784
00:56:11,493 --> 00:56:13,328
I wasn't able to do anything.

785
00:56:17,123 --> 00:56:18,583
What am I going to do?

786
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:21,127
What am I going to do now?

787
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:24,964
What am I going to do now?

788
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:39,646
So it wasn't because
Si-woo never wanted to get married.

789
00:56:41,272 --> 00:56:43,024
I was afraid that it'd get too hot,

790
00:56:43,858 --> 00:56:45,819
that I wouldn't be able to handle it,

791
00:56:46,402 --> 00:56:48,822
that I wouldn't be able to
control my feelings,

792
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:51,366
so I didn't raise the last 1°C

793
00:56:52,742 --> 00:56:54,285
to the boiling point

794
00:56:54,369 --> 00:56:57,080
by doing everything in moderation.

795
00:56:57,997 --> 00:56:59,165
But…

796
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:08,216
-Senior Forecaster Um.
-Yes?

797
00:57:13,012 --> 00:57:15,598
When did it become like that?

798
00:57:26,484 --> 00:57:29,279
This is Um Dong-han of Headquarters.

799
00:57:30,321 --> 00:57:32,073
We just saw it.

800
00:57:32,157 --> 00:57:33,700
Is it what I think it is?

801
00:57:33,783 --> 00:57:34,701
Yes.

802
00:57:34,784 --> 00:57:37,704
It's Typhoon Number 15 Elisha
that followed Number 14 Ricky.

803
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:41,624
Around 11 o'clock today,
it was moving northeast

804
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:44,377
with a central pressure of 990mb,
a maximum wind speed of 20m per second,

805
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:47,964
and a strong wind radius of 150
from 300km west of Okinawa.

806
00:57:48,047 --> 00:57:49,090
Hey.

807
00:57:49,174 --> 00:57:50,425
Bring it to me.

808
00:57:50,508 --> 00:57:52,135
NATIONAL TYPHOON CENTER

809
00:57:52,218 --> 00:57:53,553
Satellite Center?

810
00:57:53,636 --> 00:57:54,888
What's the intensity of the typhoon?

811
00:57:54,971 --> 00:57:59,559
At 10 p.m., it'll advance
from 120km west of Okinawa

812
00:57:59,642 --> 00:58:03,188
to the southern sea of Jeju
with a central air pressure of 980mb,

813
00:58:03,271 --> 00:58:06,691
a maximum wind speed of 28m per second,
and a strong wind radius of 200.

814
00:58:08,776 --> 00:58:11,237
Okay. Got it.

815
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:13,740
Keep sending the data please.

816
00:58:14,866 --> 00:58:15,992
-Assistant Director Shin.
-Yes.

817
00:58:16,075 --> 00:58:18,203
Give me the hourly data
on the changes in the ocean heat content

818
00:58:18,286 --> 00:58:19,329
-Okay.
-Assistant Director Oh.

819
00:58:19,412 --> 00:58:21,915
Identify the vertical wind shear
and steering flow

820
00:58:21,998 --> 00:58:23,374
-from the new prediction data.
-Okay.

821
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:24,959
VERTICAL WIND SHEAR:
CHANGE IN WINDSPEED WITH HEIGHT

822
00:58:25,043 --> 00:58:26,794
STEERING FLOW: THE FLOW
THAT INFLUENCES TYPHOON MOVEMENT

823
00:58:55,907 --> 00:58:59,452
I'm going to kill you all.

825
01:00:27,165 --> 01:00:29,876
I didn't know you loved Si-woo this much.

826
01:00:29,959 --> 01:00:31,002
I don't know anything anymore.

827
01:00:31,085 --> 01:00:33,755
I don't know where it all went wrong.

828
01:00:33,838 --> 01:00:35,256
I want to speak to the person in charge.

829
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:37,050
-How do you expect me to?
-What's going on?

830
01:00:37,133 --> 01:00:38,926
-You're obstructing official duties.
-Stay away.

831
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:40,887
That's how important this room is.

832
01:00:41,679 --> 01:00:42,513
I can't do this anymore.

833
01:00:42,597 --> 01:00:45,933
Just be a man and sign the divorce papers.

834
01:00:46,517 --> 01:00:48,770
Yu-jin just happened
to leave me right now.

835
01:00:48,853 --> 01:00:49,979
Please let me go.

836
01:00:50,063 --> 01:00:52,982
I'll join you on that flight
to Jeju Island tomorrow.

837
01:00:53,066 --> 01:00:56,611
There are many things
we wouldn't know unless we express them.

838
01:00:56,694 --> 01:00:59,864
So why did we expect each other
to realize those things

839
01:00:59,947 --> 01:01:01,741
-without saying anything?
-Yu-jin.

840
01:01:01,824 --> 01:01:04,911
I just wanted to have
some personal time together.

841
01:01:04,994 --> 01:01:08,081
Where did we go wrong?

842
01:01:09,290 --> 01:01:14,295
