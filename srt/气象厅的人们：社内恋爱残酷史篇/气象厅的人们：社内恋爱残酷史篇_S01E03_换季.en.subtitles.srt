1
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:52,427
Let's just forget it happened.

2
00:00:53,052 --> 00:00:54,637
Let's be mature. Let's be cool about it.

3
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,306
I hope we get along.

4
00:00:56,806 --> 00:00:59,434
Let's be mature. Let's be cool about it.

5
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:02,062
Okay, then.

6
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:29,339
This is insane.

7
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:36,095
Aren't you hungry?

8
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:37,931
Let's grab something to…

9
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:58,284
Ha-kyung didn't come home?

10
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:02,956
What did she say on the phone last night?

11
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:06,960
She told you not to worry because
she'd end it with Ki-jun no matter what.

12
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:20,348
Hey! You…

13
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:22,183
Mom worried about you all night.

14
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:24,352
Why didn't you tell us
you were staying out?

15
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:27,814
Did you come straight from work?

16
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,108
Yes.

17
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:33,069
-Did you eat?
-I'm not hungry.

18
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:40,994
Mom, food isn't the issue.

19
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:42,662
Can't you tell?

20
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:45,206
She couldn't do it.

21
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:48,418
She's smart and sharp about everything,

22
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:52,589
but she's clueless when it comes
to what really matters for herself.

23
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,175
Wait here.

24
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:21,034
-She's crying.
-She is?

25
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:24,078
-Step aside.
-Mom.

26
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:26,414
Leave her alone.

27
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:30,877
Of course, she's upset.
Her fiancé stabbed her in the back.

28
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,295
I knew it.

29
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:35,590
I knew he was up to no good
when she made excuses for him.

30
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:38,509
Exactly. She must be really embarrassed.

31
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:41,679
She has no reason to be embarrassed.
It was all his fault!

32
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:44,641
Mom, just leave her alone.

33
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:46,100
Let's give her some time

34
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:48,353
to get her head together, okay?

35
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:49,729
Goodness.

36
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:13,711
This is insane.

37
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:30,228
The yellow dust has receded overnight,

38
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:32,146
and today's midday weather will be

39
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,565
closer to that of
early summer than spring.

40
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:37,318
The temperature will rise to 28°C
during the day in Seoul,

41
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:40,989
about 7 to 8 degrees higher
than yesterday.

42
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:50,456
The time between seasons is ambiguous.

43
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:57,088
You aren't sure whether
you should wear thick or thin clothes.

44
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:00,049
TRY A SUMMER DELICACY!

45
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,676
-Bye.
-Bye.

46
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,553
COLD BUCKWHEAT NOODLES
SPICY BUCKWHEAT NOODLES

47
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:06,764
You hesitate between eating

48
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:09,434
-Thank you.
-something hot or something cold.

49
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:10,810
-Hello.
-Welcome.

50
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,317
Can I have a hot…

51
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,652
No, I'll have an iced Americano, please.

52
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:20,945
-One?
-Yes.

53
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:22,530
Thank you.

54
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:37,003
So, at times, I'm confused
whether this inexplicable feeling…

55
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:40,965
is sadness about letting go
of the passing season

56
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:44,969
or excitement for the new season.

57
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:54,479
What's clear is that summer is coming.

58
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:31,057
EPISODE 3
IN BETWEEN SEASONS

59
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:13,641
I'm off to work.
I made breakfast so make sure to eat.

60
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,373
Man.

61
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:42,545
Are you going to school?

62
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,882
See you later.

63
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,467
Call me when you're done at the academy.

64
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,552
-Okay.
-Bye.

65
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:55,475
What's wrong with her?
Is she sensitive in the morning?

66
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:57,435
She's all grown up.

67
00:07:57,518 --> 00:07:59,353
You can't be dressed like that at home.

68
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:01,439
This…

69
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:03,774
Why not? I'm her dad.

70
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:08,779
Yes. You're a dad who hasn't lived
with his daughter for 14 years.

71
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:19,081
Breakfast is ready.

72
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:20,416
Have some before you go.

73
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,751
I'm late for work.

74
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:27,798
Your car isn't outside.
Did you leave it at work?

75
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:44,732
Oh, right.

76
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:45,650
Bye.

77
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:49,195
This is driving me nuts.

78
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:52,490
Yes.

79
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:57,286
No. We didn't find
any car keys in the room.

80
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:58,788
Really?

81
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:01,165
Could you please check again,
just in case?

82
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:02,792
Yes. Thank you.

83
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:11,717
Yes.

84
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,596
The buoy data over the past week.

85
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,598
BUOY: EQUIPMENT USED
TO OBSERVE WEATHER CONDITIONS AT SEA

86
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:20,309
It's here. Thank you.

87
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:31,195
-Forecaster Lee, did you catch a cold?
-Yes.

88
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,489
You should have been careful.

89
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,908
Was it cold last night?

90
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:37,994
No.

91
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:49,463
It was hot.

92
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:52,675
Did you sleep out?

93
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:54,552
You're wearing
the same clothes as yesterday.

94
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:57,930
Did you sleep out?

95
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:01,601
That's personal.

96
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,979
What's going on, Forecaster Lee?

97
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:06,647
You're making me curious.

98
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:09,942
Actually…

99
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:12,820
I'm staying at the training center
while I look for a place.

100
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:16,657
I can only stay there
until the end of the month.

101
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:18,200
So I'm living out of a suitcase.

102
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:20,328
I see.

103
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:23,164
Assistant Director Shin,
don't you have an extra room?

104
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:25,958
Didn't you buy an apartment last year?

105
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:28,628
Did you?

106
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,047
It's not mine. The bank owns it.

107
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:34,675
I won't be a freeloader. I'll pay rent.

108
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:37,303
Si-woo, I can't live with anyone.

109
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:41,682
Where is Director Jin? Is she always late?

110
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:45,353
CHIEF TEAM TWO, DIRECTOR JIN HA-KYUNG

111
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:50,149
That's weird.

112
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:51,859
She's never been late.

113
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:23,891
Director Jin, where are you?
The meeting is starting soon.

114
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,352
The traffic is terrible.

115
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:31,232
It'd be great if Senior Forecaster Um
could start the meeting.

116
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:43,202
Director Jin is going to be late.

117
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:45,454
She asked if you could start the meeting.

118
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:50,292
Good morning.

119
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,086
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

120
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,393
KMA BUS STOP

121
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:27,913
-Why aren't we starting?
-She isn't here yet.

122
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:29,248
She isn't?

123
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:35,087
Soo-jin, did you tell him?

124
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,074
Where is Director Jin?

125
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:06,994
She isn't checking her messages now.

126
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:12,041
Ask Senior Forecaster Um
to start the meeting.

127
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:14,335
I already asked him twice.

128
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:17,630
But he's still as a rock.

129
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,719
Senior Forecaster Um,
please start the meeting.

130
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:28,891
Senior Forecaster Um.

131
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:50,287
I'm sorry. I…

132
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:52,248
I left my car yesterday and…

133
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,375
I understand. Let's start the meeting.

134
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:55,584
I'm sorry.

135
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:08,264
I'm sorry.

136
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:20,859
Won't you start?

137
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:22,611
I will.

138
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:29,577
We'll begin the morning meeting of May 10.

139
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,744
Satellite center--

140
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:40,921
I'm sorry.

141
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,799
What's the current status?

142
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:47,011
A wind warning is in effect
on the West Sea due to strong lower wind

143
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:49,555
at the edge of
an anticyclone in the south.

144
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:53,017
Now…

145
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,060
Thank you.

146
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:05,863
If you look at the satellite images,
clouds are rotating clockwise

147
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:08,657
around Gyeongbuk Province.

148
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:11,452
-In this case, the inland--
-No. Please go over

149
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:14,538
the high wind warning
that went into effect two days ago first.

150
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:16,498
Pardon?

151
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:20,210
It's chaos here
because of the high wind warning.

152
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:27,384
Please lift the fishing ban.
What are you doing?

153
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:29,011
In the last election,

154
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:31,931
didn't you say you'd help fishermen
make a better living?

155
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:34,058
We have only two weeks to catch crabs.

156
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:36,268
You've held us back for two days already.

157
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:38,228
What do you want us to do?

158
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:40,981
Don't you know anyone at the coast guard?

159
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:44,109
Can't the governor
do something about this?

160
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:45,402
Do something!

161
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:46,320
No.

162
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:47,529
COAST GUARD
SENIOR SUPERINTENDENT YOO WON-CHEOL

163
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:49,531
I understand their situation.

164
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,742
But until the KMA
clears the high wind warning,

165
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:53,285
they can't set sail.

166
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:57,665
There are currently nine patrol boats
that can be dispatched.

167
00:15:57,748 --> 00:16:01,919
And there are only about 32 rescue guards
and coast guards in total.

168
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:04,964
If an accident occurs on the swell waves,

169
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:06,715
we can't do anything about it!

170
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:10,427
No means no!

171
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:12,596
GWANGJU REGIONAL OFFICE
OF METEOROLOGY

172
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,891
Shouldn't you do something about this?

173
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,726
The sea conditions there…

174
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:28,028
Well, the west coast wave period

175
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:30,823
has dropped down to 11.4 seconds.

176
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:33,784
Looking at the
oceanographic factors there…

177
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:35,369
I mean…

178
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:37,121
Let's help her.

179
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:39,206
Send her the summarized data.

180
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:53,721
I'm sorry.

181
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:59,810
I'm really sorry.
I haven't analyzed the situation yet.

182
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:06,650
Senior Forecaster Um,
could you please take over?

183
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,573
The wave height isn't stable yet.

184
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:16,035
Considering the long wind drift distance,

185
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,912
the wave height
will not subside immediately.

186
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:20,748
Is that so?

187
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:23,917
Goodness.

188
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,006
What do you think,
Severe Weather Forecaster Lee?

189
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:31,675
The wave height remains the same,
but the wave period

190
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:33,427
dropped from 14.5 to 11.4 seconds.

191
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,304
The wind speed is dropping

192
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:37,890
and the swell waves
are gradually subsiding.

193
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:40,350
So your opinion is different
from Senior Forecaster Um's.

194
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:42,436
Yes.

195
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:46,648
What?

196
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:52,946
The Administrator is calling
because of the high wind warning in Taean.

197
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,702
The local governments
are pressuring the Administrator.

198
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:00,913
-Goodness.
-This is complicated.

199
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:02,873
Director Jin, what do you think?

200
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,460
They have different opinions.

201
00:18:06,543 --> 00:18:08,587
You need to make a decision.

202
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:19,598
Hey, Director Jin.

203
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:21,183
Considering the wave height deviation,

204
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:23,143
we'll monitor the situation
for another time section.

205
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:26,772
TIME SECTION: A PERIOD OF 3 HOURS
IN WHICH WEATHER DATA IS UPDATED

206
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:33,529
Okay.

207
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:35,906
Got it.

208
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:38,575
We'll monitor the conditions
until the next update.

209
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:40,410
-Report that.
-Yes, sir.

210
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:42,830
The meeting is over.

211
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:51,004
I'm sorry.

212
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:53,757
For what?
For being late or for stuttering?

213
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:56,009
For having to monitor
the conditions some more.

214
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:59,471
We can do that. What's the problem?

215
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:03,350
You'll get annoying complaints
from everywhere.

216
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:05,435
Director Jin.

217
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:07,604
I'll take care of that.

218
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:11,316
As a director, you only need
to look after your team.

219
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:15,112
Okay. I'm sorry.

220
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,031
It's okay.

221
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:19,867
Good work.

222
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,451
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

223
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:33,589
I clearly told him
that you asked him to run the meeting.

224
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:34,965
Twice.

225
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:42,681
-Let's get some coffee.
-All right.

226
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:54,151
Are you okay?

227
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:58,238
With what? With being late,
stuttering, or being embarrassed?

228
00:19:58,322 --> 00:19:59,615
I'm talking about the cold.

229
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:01,366
You sneezed really loudly.

230
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:05,579
I have rhinitis.
It's because the season is changing.

231
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,655
I'll buy it.

232
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:44,117
NEIGHBORHOOD MARKET
SELLING AN AIR PURIFIER

233
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:45,410
For 300,000 won.

234
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:09,685
What? Why are you still here?

235
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:16,191
Didn't you know?

236
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,694
I've been officially transferred here.

237
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:21,405
Why here of all places?

238
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:24,116
Ask HR if you're curious.

239
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:25,701
It was their decision.

240
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:29,162
So you'll stay here
and keep bumping into me?

241
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:30,163
Yes.

242
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:33,375
Working at Headquarters was my dream,
so I'll work hard.

243
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:36,086
I lost you
because I was chasing that dream.

244
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:37,337
Am I wrong?

245
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:41,300
Do you think that was
the only reason for our breakup?

246
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:42,843
What else was there?

247
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:45,637
Do you really not know
or are you just pretending?

248
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:53,729
It doesn't matter anyway.

249
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:57,149
Because we have nothing
to do with each other now.

250
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:02,154
Reporter Chae!

251
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:05,198
Good day, Reporter Chae.

252
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,583
-Who was that?
-A Severe Weather Forecaster.

253
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,835
He was transferred here recently.

254
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:18,086
How do you know him?

255
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:21,548
I just know him from work.

256
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:23,675
I see.

257
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:30,098
COAST GUARD TELLS FISHERMEN
TO STAY ALERT FOR POSSIBLE ACCIDENTS

258
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:31,683
STRONG WINDS EXPECTED ON THE WEST COAST

259
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:32,809
REGULAR FERRY OPERATIONS SUSPENDED

260
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:34,061
EXTRA CAUTION REQUIRED
FOR MARITIME ACCIDENTS

261
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:36,855
The warning hasn't been lifted yet.

262
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:38,356
-Yes.
-That's right.

263
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,775
-Of course.
-We're monitoring the conditions.

264
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:43,445
I understand this is a problem for you,
but the wave heights are still unstable.

265
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:45,489
We have to wait a little longer.

266
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:47,407
Yes. The waves are too high.

267
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:49,242
-It's too…
-Yes, I understand.

268
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:50,660
We'd really love

269
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:52,454
-to lift the warning.
-I see.

270
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:54,247
-But we can't do that
-Yes, I like crabs.

271
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:56,291
-as we please.
-It's not on purpose.

272
00:22:56,374 --> 00:22:58,168
-The administration says the waves…
-Yes.

273
00:22:58,251 --> 00:22:59,503
Yes, of course.

274
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:01,546
-No, it's not like that.
-The message board?

275
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:02,547
Yes.

276
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:04,591
Okay.

277
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:07,677
-Yes. Please hold.
-Yes.

278
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:08,929
The message board is going crazy.

279
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:15,769
We're the ones suffering
because the KMA is making a big fuss.

280
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:18,939
The KMA is killing us, not the sea!

281
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,525
Damn it.

282
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:24,569
Look at that. There's no high wind.

283
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:26,404
They know nothing about the sea.

284
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:29,366
I'll let you know
as soon as I hear from them.

285
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:31,326
-Yes, okay.
-Yes.

286
00:23:31,409 --> 00:23:33,495
We'll do our best.

287
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:38,375
Goodness.

288
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:40,752
I can't handle this.

289
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:42,921
-Deputy Director Han.
-Yes, sir.

290
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:44,881
Go to the Chief Team

291
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:47,092
and get a preliminary report.

292
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:48,468
"A preliminary report"?

293
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:51,471
We need one that indicates

294
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:53,306
when the warning will be lifted.

295
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,976
Otherwise, we'll end up
answering phone calls all day.

296
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:57,477
Okay.

297
00:23:57,561 --> 00:24:00,438
Assistant Director Kim,
which team is in charge today?

298
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:02,816
It's Chief Team Two.

299
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:08,280
Of all teams…

300
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:10,699
Are you not uncomfortable
seeing me like this?

301
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:12,534
Oh, are you?

302
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:14,411
Then you should leave instead.

303
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:17,038
Be my guest and go to Geneva, you asshole.

304
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:25,255
What is it?

305
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:29,092
The high wind warning has been
in effect on the Central West Sea

306
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:32,012
-for two days already.
-And?

307
00:24:32,095 --> 00:24:35,640
Can you give us a preliminary report
on when it'll be lifted--

308
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:37,976
Didn't you receive the minutes?

309
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:39,811
The high wind warning can't be lifted

310
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:43,773
under the current circumstances
due to dangers posed by swell waves.

311
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:46,568
So why don't we release
a preliminary report?

312
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:50,030
Either this afternoon
or early tomorrow morning--

313
00:24:50,113 --> 00:24:52,240
The wave heights are unstable.

314
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:55,619
I can't release uncertain information
just because we're pressured.

315
00:24:55,702 --> 00:24:56,953
Please wait.

316
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:03,585
I know you can do it.

317
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:09,382
What do you mean?

318
00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:11,384
A preliminary report.

319
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:13,803
You're withholding it on purpose

320
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:15,889
because of your personal feelings.

321
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:21,478
Are you saying that
I'm making the crab fishermen suffer

322
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:24,231
because I want to screw you over?

323
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:26,441
-Aren't you?
-Mr. Han Ki-jun!

324
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:28,360
You can talk to me.

325
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:32,447
I'm the Severe Weather Forecaster,

326
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:33,823
so talk to me.

327
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:37,994
Do you know what's going on
in the Office of Spokesperson?

328
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:39,204
It's impossible to work

329
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:42,374
because of the complaint calls
from local governments and ministries.

330
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:44,209
Our work is at a standstill.

331
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:47,504
Shouldn't the Office of Spokesperson
do at least that much?

332
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:49,256
What?

333
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:51,675
-"At least that much"?
-Can't you see

334
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:54,636
that everyone here is skipping lunch

335
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:56,930
to analyze data for the high winds?

336
00:25:57,013 --> 00:26:00,308
We're working our asses off
drawing up various scenarios.

337
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:03,186
You should at least take care
of the complaint calls for us.

338
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:05,313
Everyone is working
their fingers to the bone.

339
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:06,940
It's not just you.

340
00:26:07,023 --> 00:26:08,984
You shouldn't be complaining.

341
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:13,655
It's not your place to interfere.
Stay out of this.

342
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:16,199
I'm the Severe Weather Forecaster.

343
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:19,744
In any case,
I'm going to talk to your director.

344
00:26:20,495 --> 00:26:22,205
That's enough, Mr. Lee.

345
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:25,917
Please return to your office, Mr. Han.

346
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:27,335
What?

347
00:26:28,461 --> 00:26:29,754
Well…

348
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:33,049
You want me to leave, just like that?

349
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:34,801
When there's severe weather,

350
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:39,097
an accident leads straight to casualties.
Don't you know that?

351
00:26:39,597 --> 00:26:42,809
It's not a matter of screwing anyone over.

352
00:26:43,476 --> 00:26:46,479
So go back to your office
and wait for the notice.

353
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:58,742
-Well, in any case--
-I said go back and wait.

354
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:30,774
She'll be okay, right?

355
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:32,233
What?

356
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:34,486
I'm talking about Ha-kyung.

357
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:37,822
She looked so dazed.

358
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,657
I know.

359
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:42,327
Going to work every day
must be hell for her.

360
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:47,582
As if having to face Ki-jun
every day at work wasn't enough,

361
00:27:47,665 --> 00:27:50,668
everyone who works with her
knows what happened too.

362
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:53,838
Still, she has to pretend
to be okay and keep working.

363
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:55,465
Would you be okay if you were her?

364
00:27:58,301 --> 00:27:59,928
What is it? What are you doing?

365
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,392
Ha-kyung.

366
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:07,602
If you're having
a hard time at work, quit--

367
00:28:07,685 --> 00:28:08,853
I'm busy.

368
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:10,688
Oh, okay.

369
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:15,193
Mom.

370
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:18,279
Doing nothing is the best way to help her.

371
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:21,741
She didn't sound good. Is she unwell?

372
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:38,925
Here.

373
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:40,760
I said I have rhinitis.

374
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:43,430
You're quite insensitive.

375
00:28:49,352 --> 00:28:50,645
You have a fever.

376
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:57,110
Take one now.

377
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:03,867
What are you doing?

378
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,618
It's just part of the job.

379
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:07,537
Getting on the good side of my director.

380
00:29:16,629 --> 00:29:20,258
Don't worry. I won't ask you out
just because we slept together once.

381
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:24,554
Take it now, okay?

382
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:43,656
Goodness.

383
00:29:44,657 --> 00:29:46,284
-Gosh.
-What?

384
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:49,245
Wait.

385
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:51,790
Yes. What?

386
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:55,251
The sea is calm.

387
00:29:56,252 --> 00:29:58,755
It's calm enough for us to swim in.

388
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:00,924
What?

389
00:30:01,424 --> 00:30:04,594
We know the sea
like the back of our hands.

390
00:30:04,677 --> 00:30:06,221
What about the sea far away?

391
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:09,265
Yes. What does it look like now?

392
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:11,559
Okay.

393
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,603
Could you please tell me

394
00:30:13,686 --> 00:30:16,105
the shape of the clouds
and the direction of the wind?

395
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:18,358
Okay.

396
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:24,280
I checked the site.

397
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:27,075
There are swell waves by the seaside,
and none out at sea.

398
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:28,368
How did you check it?

399
00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:30,912
Through a captain of a weather ship

400
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:33,706
who knows the seas at Taean
like the back of his hand.

401
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:37,126
There's an average
of 18 accidents and 32 casualties

402
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:39,587
due to swell waves every year.

403
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:43,424
Most of them knew the sea
like the back of their hands.

404
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:45,385
The ocean wind is becoming weaker.

405
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:48,763
The significant wave height is quite tall,

406
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:51,474
but, as he said,
the wind is getting weaker.

407
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:53,685
-That's true.
-So if we

408
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:55,562
bring the warning down to a watch,

409
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:57,146
big vessels can set sail.

410
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:59,148
We'll be less pressured,

411
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:00,859
and the fishermen will be relieved.

412
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:02,694
If the big vessels depart,

413
00:31:02,777 --> 00:31:04,696
the small ones will follow.

414
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:05,947
Will you be able to stop them?

415
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:08,783
Coast Guard is worried about
not being able to control them.

416
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:11,119
Do you want to keep the warning then?

417
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:17,792
What do you think?

418
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:21,462
When it's hard to make a decision,

419
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:24,215
go with the figures.

420
00:31:26,634 --> 00:31:28,136
But it's crab fishing season.

421
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:30,388
I can't ignore the fishermen.

422
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:34,475
Or trust Forecaster Lee's hunch

423
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,728
and bring the warning down to a watch.

424
00:31:37,812 --> 00:31:41,649
Who knows?
Maybe Poseidon will calm the waves.

425
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:47,155
You talk as if it's none of your business.

426
00:31:49,532 --> 00:31:52,368
The director is responsible
for making a decision,

427
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:53,661
not me.

428
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:55,705
Right.

429
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:23,399
This is Han Ki-jun
of the Office of Spokesperson.

430
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:27,403
Here's the conclusion
our team has reached as of 3:23 p.m.

431
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:28,488
Sir.

432
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:30,782
-It's the Chief Team.
-Will they lift it?

433
00:32:30,865 --> 00:32:32,408
Let me hear it.

434
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:33,576
Please go ahead.

435
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:36,788
Strong winds and waves on the west coast
have eased to a watch level,

436
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:40,083
but given the large variation
in significant wave height in the region,

437
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:41,876
we'll watch the situation until 9 p.m.,

438
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,046
and decide whether
to lower it or lift it completely.

439
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:47,632
Wait, Director Jin. What did you say?

440
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:52,095
Director Jin. Well… Director Jin!

441
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,562
Goodness.

442
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,398
-Here we go again.
-This is the Office of Spokesperson.

443
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:06,234
-Yes.
-This is the Office of Spokesperson.

444
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:08,277
-This is the Office of Spokesperson.
-Yes.

445
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:10,655
-It'll last a little longer.
-The warning?

446
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:11,948
-I'm sorry.
-No.

447
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:14,033
I'll send the notice then.

448
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:15,201
Okay.

449
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:19,747
Your forecast is more conservative
than I thought.

450
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:23,209
I made a decision
based on figures and data.

451
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:26,754
There's one more thing that clearly exists
between the figures and the data.

452
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:28,673
It's called a hunch.

453
00:33:28,756 --> 00:33:30,717
And mine has almost never been wrong.

454
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:35,179
-Forecaster Lee.
-Yes?

455
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:40,226
Forecasting is a science.
If you want to remain on my team,

456
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:43,646
base your statements only
on scientific evidence, not on your hunch.

457
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:44,981
Got it?

458
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:54,073
I'll send out a notice
saying that the high wind warning

459
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:56,993
on the west coast will be maintained
from 4 p.m. to 9 p.m.

460
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,583
HIGH WIND WARNING EXTENSION

461
00:34:03,666 --> 00:34:04,959
SEND NOTICE?
YES

462
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:05,918
THE NOTICE HAS BEEN SENT

463
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:08,171
WEST SEA COAST GUARD STATION

464
00:34:12,925 --> 00:34:16,387
NOTICE
HIGH WIND WARNING EXTENSION

465
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:20,141
APPLICABLE AREA
CENTRAL WEST SEA, EAST SEA

466
00:34:27,648 --> 00:34:28,816
Really?

467
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:32,028
Okay.

468
00:34:32,945 --> 00:34:33,863
Yes.

469
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:35,740
Okay!

470
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:40,119
Goodness, the weather is killing me now.

471
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:42,747
Let's go home.

472
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:45,875
-We can't go out today.
-Again?

473
00:34:45,958 --> 00:34:48,169
-Darn it.
-Seriously?

474
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:50,213
-Come here.
-Goodness.

475
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:51,839
-Have a drink.
-I can't believe it.

476
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:04,227
Who's going to eat all this?

477
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:07,772
I won't ask you to eat it,
so stop nagging.

478
00:35:07,855 --> 00:35:09,982
Go to the seafood section

479
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:12,360
and ask them when they're getting loaches.

480
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:14,028
Why? Will you make loach soup?

481
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:16,114
Ha-kyung doesn't like that.

482
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:18,825
-Why are you cooking it again?
-Shall I go?

483
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:20,284
No, I'll go.

484
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:25,414
Who makes loach soup at home these days?

485
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:27,875
You can just order it online
and have it delivered.

486
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:29,836
She's something else.

487
00:35:37,426 --> 00:35:39,262
Look who's here.

488
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:40,847
Hi, Soo-ja.

489
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:42,515
Mrs. Lee?

490
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:45,143
Long time no see.

491
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:48,062
Have you been ill or something?

492
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:50,523
I haven't seen you at the gym in ages.

493
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:54,026
My youngest had a baby recently.

494
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:55,820
She needed postpartum care,

495
00:35:55,903 --> 00:35:57,989
so I was in America for a few months.

496
00:35:58,072 --> 00:36:00,616
I see. Did she have a son or a daughter?

497
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,868
A daughter.

498
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:03,244
That's great.

499
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:05,621
Daughters are the best.

500
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:07,582
Your younger daughter got married, right?

501
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:09,709
I felt really bad

502
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:11,961
because I couldn't attend the wedding.

503
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:13,004
Wait a minute.

504
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:15,548
Let me give you some congratulatory money.

505
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:17,758
No, you don't have to do that.

506
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:20,011
Yes, I do.

507
00:36:20,094 --> 00:36:21,929
You gave so much to my daughter.

508
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:24,557
No, it's okay.

509
00:36:27,768 --> 00:36:30,354
She didn't get married.

510
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:31,355
What?

511
00:36:31,939 --> 00:36:34,650
-The wedding was called off.
-Why?

512
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:37,612
You bragged that
he was a government employee

513
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:40,573
working with your daughter
in the same company.

514
00:36:40,656 --> 00:36:43,492
Did you brag about that jerk, Han Ki-jun?

515
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:45,703
-Be quiet.
-What happened?

516
00:36:45,786 --> 00:36:47,496
Was there a problem?

517
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,415
No, not really.

518
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:52,668
You know how even married couples
split up all the time.

519
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:55,421
I thought he was awful,

520
00:36:55,504 --> 00:36:57,757
so I called it off.

521
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,383
I see.

522
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:02,178
You must be really upset.

523
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:04,764
Your older daughter was divorced.

524
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:07,767
Now your younger daughter's wedding
got called off.

525
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:10,186
I was the one who called it off.

526
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:13,522
I'm glad you're okay
after going through that.

527
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:16,108
I would have been sick in bed.

528
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:18,569
Why would anyone
be sick in bed because of that?

529
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:22,657
You should pay attention
when someone's talking.

530
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:26,410
My daughters weren't dumped.
They dumped them.

531
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:27,912
Hey, tell her.

532
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:30,456
Did you divorce him or did he divorce you?

533
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:31,624
Let's go, Mom.

534
00:37:31,707 --> 00:37:32,750
-Wait.
-Bye.

535
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:34,335
-Bye.
-Why don't you understand?

536
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:36,587
-Don't you have any ears?
-Mom, let's go.

537
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:37,922
They have good loaches.

538
00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:39,090
-Do they?
-Yes.

539
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:41,300
-That old witch.
-Let's go.

540
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:51,727
-Good work.
-Good work.

541
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:54,397
A new seafood noodles restaurant opened.

542
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,065
That sounds good.

543
00:37:56,732 --> 00:37:58,276
Won't you join us?

544
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:00,152
No. You guys enjoy it.

545
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:02,029
See you tomorrow.

546
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:03,030
-Okay.
-Let's go.

547
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:04,031
-Is it good?
-Yes.

548
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:08,119
Aren't you going home?

549
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:11,706
I am. Darn, my back hurts.

550
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:16,961
Oh…

551
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:19,797
-See you tomorrow then.
-See you.

552
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:25,970
-Senior Forecaster Um.
-Yes?

553
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:28,973
Don't you have anything to say to me?

554
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:30,266
No, not really.

555
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:36,314
What is it? Do you have something to say?

556
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,944
You might not like me,

557
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:44,363
but work is work.

558
00:38:45,114 --> 00:38:46,115
Right.

559
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:49,201
Being late for the meeting was my fault.

560
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:52,496
But I thought you could cover for me.

561
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:53,706
I see.

562
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:57,335
Then you should have given a proper order.

563
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:02,923
Well, it'd be uncomfortable

564
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:06,010
to have someone much older than you
as a subordinate.

565
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:07,595
It could be awkward.

566
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:11,057
But when we work, you're my superior.

567
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:13,392
And I'm someone who follows your orders.

568
00:39:15,227 --> 00:39:17,438
So you should have given me
a proper order.

569
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:21,817
That's what your position entails.

570
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:23,527
If you delay making a decision,

571
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:26,238
people will complain more like earlier.

572
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:27,406
If it's ambiguous,

573
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:30,242
people will voice their opinions
and insist they're right.

574
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:32,036
If you don't give a proper order,

575
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:33,579
nobody will follow your lead.

576
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:36,832
Do you understand?

577
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:38,751
Yes, I do.

578
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:42,546
Even if you do,
you'll struggle for a while.

579
00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:44,340
From now on,

580
00:39:44,965 --> 00:39:46,425
I won't be late.

581
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:49,970
Still, if anything like that

582
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:52,264
happens again by any chance,

583
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:55,768
please take over my place.

584
00:39:58,396 --> 00:39:59,730
It's an order.

585
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:04,735
Okay. See you tomorrow.

586
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:06,779
Bye.

587
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:31,554
Yes?

588
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:33,806
Ha-kyung. You should come home late.

589
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:35,683
Why?

590
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:39,019
Mom is drinking soju straight up.

591
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:53,117
The one I loved so much

592
00:40:54,785 --> 00:41:00,082
-I lost him
-Okay.

593
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:18,184
I'll come to your place
to pick up the air purifier.

594
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:20,269
So can you give me a 20,000 won discount?

595
00:41:20,352 --> 00:41:23,314
Can you come to this address
to pick it up tonight?

596
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:24,440
Yes.

597
00:41:25,941 --> 00:41:29,236
APARTMENT 1201, BUILDING 308,
7, SHINJEONG-RO, DONGJAK-GU

598
00:41:50,633 --> 00:41:51,467
What the…

599
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:57,806
Darn it.

600
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:59,183
PLEASE KNOCK

601
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:06,482
Do you live here alone?

602
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:07,650
What?

603
00:42:07,733 --> 00:42:09,693
Why don't you lock the bathroom door?

604
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:12,530
I'm not used to doing that.

605
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:14,740
Come on.

606
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:28,963
-Are you a guest?
-What?

607
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:30,589
Why are you standing there?

608
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:48,148
-Eat some fruit.
-Okay.

609
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:55,614
Were you taken aback earlier?

610
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:58,826
Your dad is so silly, isn't he?

611
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:00,911
Is he in his room?

612
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:06,000
Don't be like that to him.

613
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:10,713
He doesn't know anything
because he hasn't been living with us.

614
00:43:10,796 --> 00:43:12,172
Please be nice to--

615
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:14,675
-I feel the same.
-What?

616
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,721
I don't know anything…

617
00:43:21,348 --> 00:43:23,392
because I've never lived with Dad.

618
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:12,775
Seriously?

619
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:33,295
I'M OFF TO WORK.
I MADE BREAKFAST SO MAKE SURE TO EAT!

620
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:47,726
By the way,

621
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:50,813
Deputy Director Han's ex-fiancée…

622
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:52,398
Yes?

623
00:44:52,481 --> 00:44:54,983
I heard they had a big fight
in front of the Office of Spokesperson.

624
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:58,362
She even slapped him in front of everyone.

625
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:04,159
She said she'd never give up
the apartment.

626
00:45:34,314 --> 00:45:35,649
You're home already?

627
00:45:35,732 --> 00:45:37,734
I'm sorry the house was a mess.

628
00:45:37,818 --> 00:45:40,404
I was busy getting ready for work.

629
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:45,117
-Cleaning up must've been a lot of work.
-Yu-jin.

630
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:50,831
I asked you to at least
put away the dishes after you ate.

631
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:52,583
I was too busy, so I forgot.

632
00:45:52,666 --> 00:45:54,585
I told you they attracted fruit flies.

633
00:45:55,294 --> 00:45:58,630
That's because you put
a banana peel in the trash can.

634
00:45:58,714 --> 00:46:01,091
-I did that only once.
-You did it more than once.

635
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:02,134
I…

636
00:46:04,511 --> 00:46:06,221
Never mind. Forget it.

637
00:46:06,305 --> 00:46:10,142
Fine. You cleaned the house,
so I'll take the trash out.

638
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:21,069
Oh, no.

639
00:46:21,153 --> 00:46:23,530
Why can't you do anything right?

640
00:46:25,574 --> 00:46:27,993
What about you? Can you do anything right?

641
00:46:28,076 --> 00:46:30,370
What about me? What didn't I do right?

642
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:36,460
Did you take care of the apartment?

643
00:46:37,169 --> 00:46:38,754
You didn't, did you?

644
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:41,590
How did you know?

645
00:46:41,673 --> 00:46:43,675
Everyone at the KMA knows except me.

646
00:46:44,343 --> 00:46:47,304
The rent is really expensive here
because it's a short-term lease.

647
00:46:47,387 --> 00:46:49,932
We were going to move
when you got the deposit back.

648
00:46:50,015 --> 00:46:53,560
I need to know what's going on
so we can plan the next move.

649
00:46:54,603 --> 00:46:55,896
Don't think about that.

650
00:46:55,979 --> 00:46:58,482
Why not? Did she say she won't give it up?

651
00:46:59,858 --> 00:47:02,236
How can she be so brazen?

652
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:05,822
You said half of it was yours.
Why can't you speak up to her?

653
00:47:08,283 --> 00:47:11,161
Out of the 20 million-won savings,
you deposited 5 million.

654
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:12,788
I paid the rest.

655
00:47:12,871 --> 00:47:16,542
And I paid the deposit,
intermediate payment, and the loan.

656
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:19,670
Then what does that mean?

657
00:47:19,753 --> 00:47:22,464
Let's halve it? Don't be ridiculous.

658
00:47:22,548 --> 00:47:24,508
You can't get any more brazen than that.

659
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:27,719
Anyway…

660
00:47:27,803 --> 00:47:30,889
fighting with her at work
won't do us any good.

661
00:47:31,431 --> 00:47:33,308
It's done, so drop it.

662
00:47:49,741 --> 00:47:50,701
Yu-jin.

663
00:47:52,995 --> 00:47:54,913
I said you don't have to do this.

664
00:47:54,997 --> 00:47:57,666
-I can just throw it away on my way out.
-Just go.

665
00:47:57,749 --> 00:47:59,960
I don't want you to hold anything dirty.

666
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:02,546
You're so sweet.

667
00:48:38,707 --> 00:48:40,792
I used to love sitting here.

668
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:57,225
Why are you here?

669
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:03,357
This is the right place.

670
00:49:04,983 --> 00:49:07,319
NEIGHBORHOOD MARKET

671
00:49:07,402 --> 00:49:08,945
Are you "issue"?

672
00:49:09,571 --> 00:49:11,156
Are you "jjin"?

673
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:32,052
Stop looking around.

674
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:35,472
Okay.

675
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:41,061
Is this it?

676
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:42,813
Just go.

677
00:49:43,438 --> 00:49:45,565
I won't sell it to you.
You know why, right?

678
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:48,443
Yes.

679
00:49:52,447 --> 00:49:54,700
-Are you throwing this out?
-I said just go.

680
00:49:58,620 --> 00:49:59,579
Okay.

681
00:50:07,087 --> 00:50:09,339
-By the way, Director Jin.
-What? What is it?

682
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:11,466
You've never sold anything online,
have you?

683
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:13,009
No.

684
00:50:13,093 --> 00:50:15,262
Well, this air purifier.

685
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:17,597
You said you used it only once to test it.

686
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:19,474
Then it's like a brand new product.

687
00:50:19,558 --> 00:50:23,061
You can get at least 400,000 won
because it's the bestselling air purifier.

688
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:25,230
Why would you sell it
for just 300,000 won?

689
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:29,776
And this is a limited edition speaker.

690
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:31,695
It's even hard to buy this overseas.

691
00:50:31,778 --> 00:50:33,238
-Really?
-Yes.

692
00:50:33,321 --> 00:50:36,408
If you sell it to an avid fan,
you can get extra money.

693
00:50:36,491 --> 00:50:39,828
Selling a high-end speaker like this
in a full box for half-price

694
00:50:39,911 --> 00:50:41,455
is like giving it away.

695
00:50:42,456 --> 00:50:43,290
What's a full box?

696
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:45,375
It means the product
is in the original packaging.

697
00:50:48,336 --> 00:50:50,505
Also, here.

698
00:50:50,589 --> 00:50:53,049
The pictures you uploaded.

699
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:55,927
There are quite a lot of online scams.

700
00:50:56,011 --> 00:50:56,928
Here.

701
00:50:57,012 --> 00:50:59,639
You have to take a picture of your item

702
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:01,349
with your nickname and date.

703
00:51:01,433 --> 00:51:02,684
It makes you look reliable.

704
00:51:03,268 --> 00:51:04,603
-I see.
-Like this.

705
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:06,772
Like this.

706
00:51:06,855 --> 00:51:08,940
Upload the pictures.

707
00:51:09,024 --> 00:51:10,442
-Nickname. Yes.
-Upload everything?

708
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:13,111
Set the date and write "no negotiation."

709
00:51:13,195 --> 00:51:15,739
-That means it's a special price.
-I see.

710
00:51:16,281 --> 00:51:17,491
-And full box.
-Okay.

711
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:19,367
Overseas limited edition.

712
00:51:19,993 --> 00:51:22,579
-And delivery included.
-Delivery…

713
00:51:32,547 --> 00:51:35,634
I won't ask you out
just because we slept together once.

714
00:51:36,718 --> 00:51:37,803
Why not?

715
00:51:39,513 --> 00:51:41,348
-Pardon?
-What?

716
00:51:42,808 --> 00:51:45,435
What? Why?

717
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:47,646
You just asked me why not?

718
00:51:47,729 --> 00:51:50,023
No, I didn't say anything.

719
00:51:53,109 --> 00:51:55,570
-Did I do something wrong?
-No.

720
00:51:56,238 --> 00:51:57,739
Did I say something?

721
00:51:58,865 --> 00:52:00,659
Why are you so nervous?

722
00:52:01,993 --> 00:52:03,703
I'm not nervous at all.

723
00:52:09,125 --> 00:52:10,460
What?

724
00:52:15,882 --> 00:52:17,133
A message!

725
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:19,886
-A message came?
-Yes!

726
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:22,013
They'll buy it right away!

727
00:52:22,681 --> 00:52:24,015
That's great.

728
00:52:28,144 --> 00:52:29,771
Thank you. I'll use it well.

729
00:52:30,272 --> 00:52:31,439
Thank you.

730
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:47,789
Thanks for everything.

731
00:52:48,456 --> 00:52:50,292
Buy me dinner then.

732
00:52:52,043 --> 00:52:54,462
-What do you mean?
-I mean I'm hungry.

733
00:52:55,046 --> 00:52:56,214
Does it have to mean something else?

734
00:52:57,966 --> 00:52:58,884
No.

735
00:52:59,467 --> 00:53:01,094
What do you want to eat, Forecaster Lee?

736
00:53:02,554 --> 00:53:03,889
Anything.

737
00:53:04,973 --> 00:53:06,016
Let's go.

738
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:23,199
Pale pink skirt

739
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:30,332
Fluttered in the spring wind

740
00:53:31,124 --> 00:53:37,589
While chewing on my coat string as usual

741
00:53:38,256 --> 00:53:44,804
On the way to the village shrine
Where wild orchids bloom

742
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:48,892
When flowers bloomed

743
00:54:36,189 --> 00:54:37,941
The time between seasons is ambiguous.

744
00:54:38,483 --> 00:54:41,987
It's hard to say if it's cold or hot.

745
00:54:42,654 --> 00:54:46,741
But as the hot summer
eventually comes after spring passes,

746
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:49,744
once this ambiguous period is over,

747
00:54:50,495 --> 00:54:54,124
flowers of another season bloom
before I even know it.

748
00:54:56,459 --> 00:54:58,294
Here's the food you ordered.

749
00:55:07,887 --> 00:55:09,305
You're selling that apartment?

750
00:55:10,515 --> 00:55:11,558
Yes.

751
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:13,852
-It's too bad.
-It is.

752
00:55:14,394 --> 00:55:15,770
I'd live there if I were you.

753
00:55:16,396 --> 00:55:18,189
You don't know, but that apartment--

754
00:55:18,273 --> 00:55:19,566
I know a little.

755
00:55:20,316 --> 00:55:22,068
Oh, right.

756
00:55:23,737 --> 00:55:26,031
There are too many things
that remind me of him.

757
00:55:26,614 --> 00:55:28,283
The only solution is to dispose of them.

758
00:55:28,366 --> 00:55:29,993
How can you do that?

759
00:55:30,785 --> 00:55:32,078
What about your heart then?

760
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:34,497
Can you dispose of your heart

761
00:55:34,581 --> 00:55:36,374
just because it no longer loves him?

762
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,753
I should still get rid
of everything that reminds me.

763
00:55:40,628 --> 00:55:42,464
Even so, you'll regret it anyway.

764
00:55:44,424 --> 00:55:46,634
You can't undo something that's been done.

765
00:55:46,718 --> 00:55:49,512
You probably mean nothing to him now.

766
00:55:50,263 --> 00:55:51,931
So maybe you're making a loss.

767
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:53,808
Honestly, it's a pity.

768
00:55:59,147 --> 00:56:01,316
I don't want you to go through that.

769
00:56:05,695 --> 00:56:06,863
Are you worried about me?

770
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:10,325
It's my advice from experience.

771
00:56:10,909 --> 00:56:12,452
No, thanks.

772
00:56:16,664 --> 00:56:17,791
Did you take the medicine?

773
00:56:18,458 --> 00:56:19,793
Just eat the chicken.

774
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:33,515
What are you doing?

775
00:56:34,557 --> 00:56:37,018
I see you took them.

776
00:56:39,896 --> 00:56:41,397
Your fever broke.

777
00:56:48,363 --> 00:56:52,117
As expected, the time
between seasons is ambiguous.

778
00:56:55,537 --> 00:56:57,872
-This place is nice.
-Welcome.

779
00:56:57,956 --> 00:56:59,457
-How many?
-Three.

780
00:56:59,541 --> 00:57:01,334
-Three? Please wait.
-What's wrong?

781
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:03,545
Look over there.

782
00:57:04,337 --> 00:57:06,131
-That table is empty.
-What?

783
00:57:06,214 --> 00:57:08,591
-Let me clear the table first.
-Hey.

784
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:09,801
But why are you hiding?

785
00:57:11,553 --> 00:57:12,804
But why are you hiding?

786
00:57:12,887 --> 00:57:14,472
Because they can't find out.

787
00:57:14,556 --> 00:57:15,932
Find out what?

788
00:57:16,766 --> 00:57:19,185
About you and me. Don't you understand?

789
00:57:21,479 --> 00:57:23,189
They're coming this way.

790
00:57:25,525 --> 00:57:27,026
Hey, where are you going?

791
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:28,153
He…

792
00:57:28,987 --> 00:57:30,488
He must be insane.

793
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:32,240
Please wait.

794
00:57:34,033 --> 00:57:35,535
-What?
-What?

795
00:57:36,035 --> 00:57:36,953
What are you doing here?

796
00:57:37,036 --> 00:57:39,581
Assistant Director Shin said
this place has great fried chicken.

797
00:57:39,664 --> 00:57:40,957
What about you?

798
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:43,585
Someone I know said
the chicken here was good.

799
00:57:43,668 --> 00:57:44,794
We came here to drink.

800
00:57:47,505 --> 00:57:48,840
Someone you know?

801
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:51,801
Hey!

802
00:58:02,353 --> 00:58:03,897
That's not him.

803
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:05,565
I thought it was someone I knew.

804
00:58:13,615 --> 00:58:14,824
You're silly.

805
00:58:16,743 --> 00:58:19,120
Do you want to have a drink with us?

806
00:58:19,204 --> 00:58:21,623
No, something urgent came up,
so I have to go.

807
00:58:22,207 --> 00:58:23,833
-You guys enjoy.
-Okay.

808
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:25,293
-Bye.
-Bye.

809
00:58:25,376 --> 00:58:26,794
Bye.

810
00:58:28,713 --> 00:58:30,507
-Please come this way.
-Okay.

811
00:58:50,235 --> 00:58:51,069
Come here.

812
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:02,580
What happened?

813
00:59:02,664 --> 00:59:04,749
Did they notice? They didn't, right?

814
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:07,710
Did they?

815
00:59:07,794 --> 00:59:09,295
What are you doing?

816
00:59:10,171 --> 00:59:11,381
What do you mean?

817
00:59:11,464 --> 00:59:12,549
Do we have something

818
00:59:13,049 --> 00:59:14,801
to hide from the others?

819
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:18,888
If we drink at a place like this together,

820
00:59:18,972 --> 00:59:21,099
they'll misunderstand us.

821
00:59:21,182 --> 00:59:25,186
We can't have rumors
going around about us.

822
00:59:29,315 --> 00:59:30,942
That's a bit too close.

823
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:36,698
Do you have feelings for me?

824
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:43,204
No. Why?

825
00:59:43,288 --> 00:59:44,747
I think you do.

826
00:59:46,541 --> 00:59:47,458
No, I don't.

827
00:59:58,511 --> 01:00:00,096
Does it seem like I do?

828
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:04,976
Just so you know, I don't flirt around.

829
01:00:06,227 --> 01:00:08,354
Hey, I didn't ask you to flirt with me.

830
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:12,442
-Then do you want to go out with me?
-What? You said you wouldn't ask me out.

831
01:00:12,525 --> 01:00:16,279
That's because I can't ask you out
if I'm the only one who has feelings.

832
01:00:22,869 --> 01:00:24,245
If we like each other, we can go out.

833
01:00:24,329 --> 01:00:27,206
If not, we won't.

834
01:00:31,169 --> 01:00:32,587
So what are we?

835
01:00:35,048 --> 01:00:38,051
What are we to you?

836
01:01:22,053 --> 01:01:23,638
The recent collision happened

837
01:01:23,721 --> 01:01:27,100
because the drivers' visibility
dropped due to the fog.

838
01:01:27,183 --> 01:01:29,852
Why doesn't our country
give fog advisories?

839
01:01:30,478 --> 01:01:33,106
A reporter shouldn't distort the facts.

840
01:01:33,189 --> 01:01:35,191
You should've done your research
before going up against her.

841
01:01:35,274 --> 01:01:39,487
Ha-kyung beat all the competition
and became the youngest director.

842
01:01:39,570 --> 01:01:40,780
-What about the rest?
-And the details?

843
01:01:40,863 --> 01:01:42,323
I think she works here.

844
01:01:42,407 --> 01:01:43,783
It's obvious he's dating a colleague.

845
01:01:43,866 --> 01:01:45,034
Thank you. You can go now.

846
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:48,037
What was that? Was she hazing him?

847
01:01:48,121 --> 01:01:49,038
How do I turn this off?

848
01:01:49,122 --> 01:01:49,997
Hello, Forecaster Lee.

849
01:01:50,081 --> 01:01:51,874
I want you to find cases
from countries around the world

850
01:01:51,958 --> 01:01:54,043
that frequently have fogs like we do
and put them on my desk.

851
01:01:54,127 --> 01:01:55,253
What's all this?

852
01:01:55,336 --> 01:01:56,295
Did I waste my time?

853
01:01:57,338 --> 01:01:59,132
Office romance will be the death of me.

854
01:01:59,215 --> 01:02:03,928
