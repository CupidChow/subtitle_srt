1
00:00:58,057 --> 00:00:59,184
Signals are simple.

2
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,313
Sometimes they are sounds.

3
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:07,025
Sometimes they are colors…

4
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:35,512
HA-KYUNG

5
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:37,222
…and sometimes they are vibrations.

6
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:40,433
They keep signaling to me

7
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:43,436
that nothing is safe in this world.

8
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:52,779
EPISODE 1
SIGNAL

9
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:58,076
-He's not picking up?
-No.

10
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,705
Sorry. I'm not feeling well.

11
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:05,291
-I can't make it to the hanbok place.
-What's wrong?

12
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:08,169
Ki-jun isn't feeling well.

13
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:09,754
Maybe he's upset.

14
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,215
Upset?

15
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,009
Yesterday…

16
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,262
Did she drag him around?

17
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:19,264
She did more than that.

18
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:23,393
She hurt his pride all along.

19
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:26,312
If I were him, I'd call this wedding off.

20
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:28,690
I'd be grateful if he did that.

21
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:29,858
Mom.

22
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:33,486
It's hard to find
a man like him these days.

23
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,071
He gets his paycheck on time,

24
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,198
and his pension
and retirement are guaranteed.

25
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:39,242
He's solid.

26
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:42,912
That's why she's marrying him.

27
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,498
But he's not reliable.

28
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:48,501
He's not feeling well
because he escorted me yesterday?

29
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:50,753
I'm almost 70 and I'm not even tired.

30
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:52,922
You call that solid?

31
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,508
Consider them a match made in heaven.

32
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:58,720
Mom, they've been together for ten years,
and they never had a fight.

33
00:02:58,803 --> 00:03:01,055
That's what concerns me the most.

34
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:04,142
She's my daughter,
but I still hate her cranky personality.

35
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:05,810
How is it possible

36
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:08,104
that he just bears with it?

37
00:03:08,187 --> 00:03:10,773
It's possible because he likes her.

38
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:13,401
Fighting requires love.

39
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:16,070
This looks good.

40
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:18,531
-The color is very classy.
-It's pretty.

41
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:20,867
Excuse me.

42
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:24,704
-Yes, ma'am. This way, please.
-Okay.

43
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:31,002
As the temperature rises
by more than three degrees,

44
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:32,587
it will be clear and warm today.

45
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:35,006
There currently are
many clouds across the country.

46
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:36,716
But as the sky gradually clears up,

47
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,428
clear weather without a single cloud
will continue for a while.

48
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:43,181
The air is clean
and the spring sun is warm.

49
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:45,683
-The temperature in Seoul is 18°C.
-Are we almost there?

50
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:47,560
-Thanks to the spring breeze,
-What?

51
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,020
the afternoon will be pleasant.

52
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:51,064
-Turn left up there.
-It would be nice

53
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:52,899
to have weather like this every day.

54
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:57,153
As the sunny weather continues,
the air is getting drier.

55
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,655
The use of fire should…

56
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:08,206
You said we were here for tea.

57
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:10,124
We are.

58
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:14,545
-This isn't a teahouse.
-When you're chatting over a cup of tea,

59
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:16,923
you're at a teahouse.

60
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:26,182
What brings you here again today?

61
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,893
I'm sure you remember
that I mentioned her before.

62
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:31,688
-My daughter--
-She's a deaconess.

63
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,523
Deaconesses,

64
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:37,235
pastors, doctors, professors, mistresses…

65
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:40,530
Anyone worried and upset
ends up sitting there.

66
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:44,701
Here.

67
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:50,415
Both of them were born
in the Year of the Rabbit.

68
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:54,794
And she was born between 5 a.m. and 7 a.m.

69
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,429
If you're too careful,

70
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:05,847
life gets difficult.

71
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,727
She was distrustful from a young age.

72
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,938
She always smells water
before she drinks it.

73
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:16,649
That's because I don't want
to die like Dad. Is that wrong?

74
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:17,817
Hey.

75
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,069
Mom brought you here for you.

76
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,864
Plus, marital compatibility
is really important.

77
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:24,991
Then why did you get a divorce?

78
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:27,577
-Hey.
-Ha-kyung. Don't.

79
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,661
Miss?

80
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:31,456
You're very cautious.

81
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:33,875
Yes, she's a little cautious.

82
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:37,253
Not just a little.
She's morbidly cautious.

83
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,797
But you can't avoid fated relationships

84
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:42,300
by being cautious.

85
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:51,392
What is it?

86
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:54,270
-Her fiance's fortune is…
-What about it?

87
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:57,982
It shows no "happily ever after"
with his wife.

88
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:00,485
And his fortune carries atrocity.

89
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:02,779
He might lose his wife.

90
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:04,906
-Bereavement?
-Divorce?

91
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,577
I told you

92
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:12,121
I had a bad feeling about him.

93
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,790
-I'm leaving.
-Ha-kyung.

94
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,208
-She isn't finished.
-Let go.

95
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,209
-Hey!
-I paid good money.

96
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:17,835
Take that umbrella with you.

97
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:20,922
Why?

98
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,425
It's going to rain.

99
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:47,657
Rain, my foot.

100
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:57,458
SI-WOO

101
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,043
Si as in time and Woo as in rain.

102
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:01,129
It means rain
that falls at the right time.

103
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:05,258
So that's why you use this character.

104
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:08,261
People don't usually use
the character for rain in names.

105
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:12,223
Oh, right.
My grandfather was a farmer all his life.

106
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:15,768
He said nothing is more pleasant than
the rain that falls at the right time.

107
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:18,896
By the way, what do you need a seal for?

108
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:24,444
For buying a car.

109
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:28,823
STAMP SEALS

110
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:03,065
Doors opening.

111
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,404
Doors closing.

112
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:18,789
PASSCODE ERROR

113
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,597
What brings you here at this hour?

114
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,140
You said you weren't well. Here.

115
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:39,185
A cold shower made me feel better.

116
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:40,353
Did it? Good.

117
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:43,523
Why did you change the passcode?

118
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:46,859
Well…

119
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,153
Did my mom come by unannounced again?

120
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,366
Sorry.

121
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:56,327
-Won't you come in?
-I have to go to work.

122
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,370
I'm running late.

123
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,247
Hold on.

124
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,043
I have to go. Eat the porridge.

125
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:07,588
Doors opening.

126
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:10,216
This is Jin Ha-kyung.

127
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:13,302
Doors closing.

128
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:21,561
We should report it to the Director.

129
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,229
We were done talking about this.

130
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:25,731
I said it'll hail today.

131
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:29,110
There's always damage when it hails.

132
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:31,988
Even if there's a one percent chance,
we have to analyze it.

133
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:34,991
So what's the current probability
that you analyzed?

134
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:37,952
-The probability?
-Yes.

135
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:41,122
It's almost five percent.

136
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:43,165
Can you be more exact?

137
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:48,045
HAIL RADAR

138
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,133
It's between 4.8 to 4.9 percent.

139
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:54,385
That means it isn't five percent yet.

140
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:55,803
Well, 4.9 is almost 5.

141
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:58,055
Call me when it goes over five.

142
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:00,349
Let's go by the book. I'm hanging up.

143
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:07,440
Does she think she's the director?

144
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:17,533
DIRECTOR CHOI JONG-SU

145
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:53,778
Are you going to work, Reporter Chae?

146
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,369
-Where did you get this car?
-I bought it.

147
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:04,497
-With what money?
-With a 36-month installment plan.

148
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,459
What are you doing? Get in.

149
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:09,960
I'm late.

150
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:17,760
I'm sure the morning forecast
has been released and it's lunchtime soon.

151
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:20,471
You have to eat, don't you?

152
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:23,724
Hop in.

153
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:41,450
Isn't this a new car?

154
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,619
It's slightly used.

155
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:45,788
Very slightly.

156
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:09,103
You said you wanted to come here
when we saw it on TV.

157
00:12:09,728 --> 00:12:10,855
What do you think?

158
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:12,731
Don't I have a good memory?

159
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:14,442
Yes.

160
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:18,279
Hey, you're here again.

161
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:24,285
We'll have the Couple B Set.

162
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:25,953
Okay. Couple B Set.

163
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:33,085
-You've been here?
-With a friend.

164
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:35,921
What a shame.

165
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:38,174
I wanted to bring you here first.

166
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:40,801
I mentioned this place so long ago.

167
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:43,429
Do stuff with me now. I have a car.

168
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:45,389
What do you want to do?

169
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:48,184
Well, I don't know.

170
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:52,313
How about a trip?

171
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:56,358
It'll be summer soon.
Let's go before we get busier.

172
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:00,488
The day before yesterday,

173
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:03,324
I saw a faint sign of hail
on the adiabatic chart.

174
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:04,325
You know the signs, right?

175
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:07,119
Snow in mid-March?

176
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:09,038
So I knew it was going to hail today.

177
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:11,248
I've been stuck in the office

178
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:13,501
for three days to find the grounds to…

179
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:20,216
Right.

180
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,260
You like Gapyeong, right?

181
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:24,929
I hear there are cute cafés.

182
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:27,932
How about camping somewhere
with a nice view?

183
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:31,393
I know the geography
and weather there really well.

184
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,521
I don't like camping.

185
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,274
How about a cottage?

186
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:43,614
Well…

187
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:51,080
No way.

188
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:53,415
It's hail, right?

189
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,251
Yes.

190
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,086
It wasn't in the forecast, right?

191
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:00,422
They ignored me again.

192
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:43,132
PREVENT FOREST FIRES

194
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:51,056
The airframe has been damaged due to hail.

TREAT THE SKIES AS A FRIEND
AND THE PEOPLE AS THE SKIES

197
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:15,164
Yes, sir. I understand.

198
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:17,416
Yes, sir.

199
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:20,377
Yes, I'll report it to you.

200
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:24,965
Goodness.

201
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,969
There was nothing unusual
in the report this morning.

202
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:30,429
Yes, sir.

203
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:32,598
We expected that
the atmosphere would be stable

204
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:35,434
and that the vertical temperature change
would not be severe.

205
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:38,854
But it became unstable
as the surface temperature rose.

206
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,815
Did you analyze the LWS
and the vertical wind shear data?

207
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:45,444
-The data did not signal hail.
-Don't you feel guilty?

208
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:50,741
Not the current data.

209
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:53,577
Give me the data
from at least 3 to 12 hours ago.

210
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:56,997
Hey. Isn't it your day off?

211
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:58,832
You owe me 50,000 won.

212
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,918
I'm in a meeting.

213
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:04,546
I told you it was going to hail.

214
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,507
If the hail was going to be of that size,

215
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,509
there must have been signals.

216
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:10,302
How frustrating.

217
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:13,806
Show me the adiabatic chart for that area.

218
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:15,349
From six hours ago.

219
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:18,686
Okay.

220
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:21,897
Twelve hours ago.

COMPREHENSIVE CONTROL SYSTEM

222
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,193
Go back to three hours ago.

223
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:29,321
Suwon.

224
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,615
No. Incheon.

225
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:37,788
Icheon.

226
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:40,374
Wait. Right there.

227
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:42,918
On the bottom. Zoom in.

228
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:55,806
Isn't that it?

229
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:59,852
It is. That's a signal.

230
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:01,145
Right?

231
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,276
He's right.

232
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:12,281
Right.

233
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:13,657
"Right"?

234
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:19,830
When I told you, you said it was nonsense.

235
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:21,957
Now you see it?

236
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:24,126
Okay. I'll buy you coffee.

237
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:26,628
What? Just coffee?

238
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:30,883
Do you know how much
my monthly allowance is?

239
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:33,761
-Fine. Here.
-All right.

240
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:35,012
Just buy me coffee.

241
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:37,806
-Okay. Thanks.
-Sure.

242
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:43,812
-Leave if you're done.
-Okay.

243
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,564
-Go.
-Well…

244
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:48,942
Director Choi, did you see this or not?

245
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:56,533
I did.

246
00:17:57,701 --> 00:18:00,412
But I saw it as a passing phenomenon.

247
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:03,707
Yes, that's fine.

248
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:07,086
But you should have at least
mentioned it here somewhere.

249
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:09,546
-The figures were too--
-I'm sorry, sir.

250
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:12,007
It was my mistake. I'll write a report.

251
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:18,347
Tell the Aviation Meteorological Office
it was our mistake

252
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:21,809
and ask the Expressway Corporation
and Rural Development Administration

253
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:23,644
if there was any damage to crops.

254
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:24,686
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

255
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:28,190
A passing phenomenon?

256
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:31,777
You're missing the signals because you
keep saying meaningless things like that.

257
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,698
Don't just broadcast the weather.

258
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,867
Try to forecast it, okay?

259
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:42,579
So frustrating.

260
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,876
The reporters are here, sir.

261
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:51,547
Goodness.

262
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:53,966
The reporters are here.

263
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:58,178
Take care of them, Director Choi.

264
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,889
I have to see the Administrator.

265
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:03,058
My goodness.

266
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:39,428
In any case,
I clearly told you about the hail.

267
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,763
Please report it to Headquarters later.

268
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:43,807
What for?

269
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:46,476
You said the best of the best are there.

270
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,396
I'm one of them.

271
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:51,690
The best of the best?

272
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:53,692
Not anymore.

273
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:54,943
Why is that?

274
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:59,323
Now, it's more like
a place you go to if you want to suffer.

275
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:00,449
Yes.

276
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:07,497
The Director General said
you'd need these for the hail analysis.

277
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:11,126
These are all similar cases
since the 1990s.

278
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:15,881
You know that my team
stayed up all night for a week.

279
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:18,967
Surely the Policy Office can cover for us.

280
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,053
We'd love to,

281
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:24,973
but the Director General wants
Chief Team Two to report it to him.

282
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:27,351
We can't analyze this and write a report

283
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:28,936
while monitoring situations.

284
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:31,396
-It's…
-When do you need it by?

285
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,522
By this weekend.

286
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:35,567
Then, good luck.

287
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:37,277
Hey, Assistant Director Park.

288
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:39,529
Where's the numerical model I requested?

289
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:43,242
-It's on the way.
-Quickly, please.

290
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:52,876
You should do the briefing, Ms. Jin.

291
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,795
If you're sorry.

292
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:57,381
I don't want to overstep
the Director's authority.

293
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:01,051
Our administration is
always under fire anyway.

294
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:12,312
-Director Choi!
-Director Choi!

295
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:13,689
Oh, no!

296
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:15,315
-Director Choi!
-Director Choi!

297
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:17,109
Wake up, Director Choi!

298
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:19,278
Somebody call an ambulance!

299
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:20,195
Director Choi!

300
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:39,047
Is he going to be all right?

301
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:41,341
-Of course.
-Hold on.

302
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:44,886
The Office of Spokesperson
is demanding someone to come.

303
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:48,890
Don't they know Director Choi
was taken away in an ambulance?

304
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:52,436
-How many is that this year?
-What should we do?

305
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:54,688
Someone has to attend the briefing.

306
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:03,864
I'll go.

307
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:31,558
How is Director Choi?

308
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:33,518
He was taken away in an ambulance.

309
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:34,811
We'll see.

310
00:22:35,353 --> 00:22:36,938
Who was that?

311
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:39,441
A reporter.

312
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:42,486
She asked me to rearrange
the questions, and I said no.

313
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:44,654
What do I have to do?

314
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:47,616
The basic briefing
on the afternoon hail is over,

315
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:49,242
so just explain the details.

316
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:51,369
Let's go.

317
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:08,762
We'll take questions.

318
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:20,232
RESTRICTED AREA
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

319
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,237
I'm at the hospital. Yes.

320
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:28,573
I think he's okay.

321
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:29,741
Hold on.

322
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:31,576
-Director Choi.
-We'll move him to his room.

323
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,953
-To his room?
-Yes.

324
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:36,414
Mrs. Choi. You must be in shock.

325
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:38,542
You didn't have to come.

326
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:40,127
Of course I had to come.

327
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:42,587
-I'm glad it wasn't any worse.
-Glad?

328
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:45,298
Well…

329
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:47,843
My husband has been requesting

330
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:50,428
a position in a regional office for years.

331
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:51,763
Yes.

332
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:55,600
The doctor kept telling him to be careful
because of his high blood pressure.

333
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:57,894
But you kept asking him

334
00:23:57,978 --> 00:24:00,355
to stay for another year
and then another year.

335
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:02,607
How can you corner him

336
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:04,359
for missing one occurrence of hail?

337
00:24:04,442 --> 00:24:06,444
It wasn't only because of--

338
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:08,488
You always get the weather wrong.

339
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:11,074
Making that one slip is not a big deal.

340
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:14,244
Do you know what they call you?

341
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:17,497
-Pardon?
-A human juicer.

342
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:20,041
Because you extract every ounce
of energy from people.

343
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:24,796
You know, I'm sick of all this.

344
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:27,966
Mrs. Choi, I'm really sorry.

345
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:30,177
Yes. You should go.

346
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,387
-Okay. He'll be fine. I'm sorry.
-Thank you.

347
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:43,440
You're back.

348
00:24:48,111 --> 00:24:51,072
Director Choi had a heart attack.

349
00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:54,451
That's why he said his chest felt tight.

350
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:55,619
Did he?

351
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:58,246
Why didn't I know that?

352
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:02,042
He's okay now, right?

353
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:06,171
He'll have a thorough examination.
We'll see. He'll be okay.

354
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:10,008
Don't stress him out
by visiting him in the hospital, okay?

355
00:25:10,091 --> 00:25:13,470
As for Chief Team Two…

356
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:17,557
Ms. Jin will be in charge.

357
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:23,563
I'm getting married next month, sir.

358
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:26,316
So be in charge
until Director Choi returns.

359
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:27,943
It'll be two weeks max.

360
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:29,778
You can cover for him, right?

361
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:33,907
The position of acting director
might be too much for her.

362
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,951
What? Speak up.

363
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:38,411
What is it? Do you have a better idea?

364
00:25:39,412 --> 00:25:40,997
-No, sir.
-Okay.

365
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:44,834
It's decided then.

366
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:24,582
Why aren't you coming?

367
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:27,711
I can't go to your alumni dinner tonight.

368
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:30,297
I have to go alone again?

369
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,258
You know Director Choi is in the hospital.

370
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:44,394
Okay.

371
00:26:44,894 --> 00:26:47,856
Don't worry about it. Get back to work.

372
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:50,608
It's only for two weeks.

373
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:52,193
I'm sorry about this.

374
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:54,112
Okay.

375
00:27:09,627 --> 00:27:16,634
INNOVATIVE WEATHER SERVICES
A STEPPING STONE TO PUBLIC SAFETY

376
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:02,847
Look at that view.

377
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:10,230
I need to share this view.

378
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:28,373
GLOBAL WARMING AND
THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE

379
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:31,668
So it means that
this summer will be hot as usual.

380
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:32,836
Then it's easy.

381
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:35,338
"The worst summer ever."

382
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:36,881
"Record-breaking heatwaves."

383
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:38,508
"Sauna-like heat."

384
00:28:38,591 --> 00:28:41,344
That's less than five words.
Why make such a long title?

385
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:44,180
I'm not saying
it's especially hot this summer.

386
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:45,974
The average temperature will rise

387
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:47,475
by one to two degrees
due to global warming.

388
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:51,521
Do you think people
are interested in global warming?

389
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:52,772
It can be provocative.

390
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:55,150
So write something
that makes people want to read.

391
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:58,236
-Hey.
-How many times do I have to say this?

392
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:01,573
That's how you sell air conditioners.

393
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:03,450
Don't you know who our biggest sponsor is?

394
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:05,285
This isn't an ad agency.

395
00:29:05,368 --> 00:29:07,078
Why are we advertising air conditioners?

396
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:09,080
Because it's good for you, for me,

397
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:10,707
and for everyone else here.

398
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:13,126
So please do as you're told.

399
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:15,295
Let's take home some bonuses.

400
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:17,464
Please?

401
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:21,634
You can do it.

402
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:22,677
Make it provocative.

403
00:29:35,231 --> 00:29:38,526
LEE SI-WOO

404
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,737
-What is this?
-Isn't it awesome?

405
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:44,324
I'M MAKING A SEAL TODAY
WHY?

406
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:45,700
LOOK AT THESE VIEWS
THEY'RE NICE

407
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:52,749
ISN'T IT AWESOME?

408
00:29:52,832 --> 00:29:54,876
Unbelievable! I hit the jackpot today!

409
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:01,341
I found fairy clouds.

410
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:05,261
These are hard to find. I'm so lucky.

411
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:10,600
Is she busy?

412
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:36,626
Sir!

413
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:42,590
He's here again.

414
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:46,219
I give up.

415
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:48,096
I give up.

416
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:57,230
See? There's nothing wrong
with the radar antenna.

417
00:30:57,313 --> 00:30:59,357
Why did you come all the way here?

418
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,026
Because I don't trust machines.

419
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:04,821
Also, I get to see you once in a while.

420
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:09,242
Are you sure
there's nothing wrong with it?

421
00:31:09,325 --> 00:31:10,285
Yes.

422
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:13,371
If you're done, you should go. We're busy.

423
00:31:13,454 --> 00:31:14,998
It's only March,

424
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:18,376
but the temperature here
is abnormally high compared to the inland.

425
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:22,380
Why don't you talk to the Gangwon Office?

426
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:27,343
I see.

427
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:31,097
GANGWON REGIONAL OFFICE
OF METEOROLOGY

428
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,223
Yes, this is Gangneung.

429
00:31:32,807 --> 00:31:35,852
Hello. The ground temperature
in Gangwon is too high.

430
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:37,061
Please check.

431
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:38,605
Is that so?

432
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:41,316
Could you also check

433
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:42,817
Pyeongchang, Chuncheon,

434
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:44,777
Hongcheon, Hoengseong, Wonju,

435
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:46,779
and the whole area please?

436
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:49,741
Hold on. Pyeongchang.

437
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:52,702
Chuncheon.

438
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,495
Hongcheon.

439
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:55,830
And?

440
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:57,248
Hoengseong and Wonju.

441
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:59,876
I see. Hoengseong and Wonju. Hold on.

442
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:02,295
I'm sorry, but could you hurry?

443
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:04,088
Wonju. Oh, no.

444
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:07,634
This is Um Dong-han of Gangneung.

445
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:09,260
What is this about?

446
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:12,847
Please check the ground temperatures

447
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:14,557
for Pyeongchang, Chuncheon,

448
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:16,976
Hongcheon, Hoengseong, and Wonju.

449
00:32:17,977 --> 00:32:19,270
GANGWON PROVINCE

450
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:22,315
I see. It's a temporary phenomenon
caused by solar radiation

451
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:24,233
when the east wind blows.

452
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:26,110
It happens sometimes.

453
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:27,278
It'll stop.

454
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,447
I don't think it will.

455
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:30,406
Pardon?

456
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,118
Okay, I understand.

457
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:37,872
Understand what? Hello?

458
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:41,751
Who is this jerk?

459
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:43,836
I didn't ask.

460
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:46,631
Why didn't you?

461
00:32:46,714 --> 00:32:49,842
That's why we get these rude calls.

462
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:51,552
I'm sorry, sir.

463
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:53,554
Darn it.

464
00:32:58,351 --> 00:33:00,269
-Sir.
-Yes?

465
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:02,689
Did you hear the rumor?

466
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:04,524
What rumor?

467
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:06,859
I heard the position
of director of Chief Team Two

468
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:08,277
at Headquarters is vacant.

469
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,114
So what?

470
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:13,616
You should go back to Headquarters.

471
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:15,493
No, thanks.

472
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:17,453
That place gives me headaches.

473
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:20,498
-I wouldn't go even if they begged me.
-What?

474
00:33:20,581 --> 00:33:22,250
If you're away for too long,

475
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:24,585
even your family will forget about you.

476
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:26,337
That's a scary thought.

477
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:49,610
BO-MI'S DAD

478
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,121
-Hello?
-Hey.

479
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:02,290
What took you so long to pick up?

480
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:04,000
Do you ever pick up my calls?

481
00:34:05,084 --> 00:34:06,377
Well…

482
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:08,421
Is everything okay?

483
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:11,215
If it isn't, can you come home?

484
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:13,134
Hey, come on.

485
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:16,054
You're talking to your husband.
Why can't you--

486
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:17,597
Get to the point.

487
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:19,474
Where's Bo-mi?

488
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,769
Bo-mi, it's Dad.

489
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:23,853
No.

490
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:27,190
-She doesn't want to talk.
-Okay.

491
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:30,526
Bye.

492
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:35,531
-Sir!
-Yes.

493
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:37,992
You have to come back to the office.

494
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:43,748
NATIONAL METEOROLOGICAL CENTER
COMPREHENSIVE CONTROL SYSTEM

495
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,804
-I'm busy.
-Wait.

496
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:00,556
Didn't you book Lian Wedding Hall?

497
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,850
-Yes, we did. What is it?
-Oh, the thing is,

498
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:05,103
I called them to check something for Mom,

499
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:07,522
and they said
you haven't paid the deposit.

500
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:08,564
What?

501
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:10,483
I can't get a hold of Ki-jun.

502
00:35:10,566 --> 00:35:12,110
Is everything all right?

503
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:14,987
He would never miss that.
There must have been a mistake.

504
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:17,448
-It's time.
-I'll check. Bye.

505
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:24,080
All right. Wait. What is that?

506
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,040
What's that spot?

507
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:29,210
Convective clouds have formed
due to an unstable atmosphere.

508
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:31,003
What's the humidity there?

509
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:33,923
Currently, it's about 82 percent.

510
00:35:34,423 --> 00:35:35,925
Will they condense and fall?

511
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:37,927
The chance of evaporation
is more than 70 percent.

512
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:40,638
The figures are too indefinite
to make a severe weather alert.

513
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:42,682
Let's have a meeting first.

514
00:35:42,765 --> 00:35:43,766
Okay.

515
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:47,770
We'll start the March 14
forecast discussion.

516
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:49,230
Satellite center?

517
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:52,692
This is the satellite center.
The cloud monitor shows

518
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:55,611
a cloud band currently
developing in the northeast.

519
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:58,156
Please give your opinion on that,
Gangwon Office.

520
00:35:58,781 --> 00:36:02,785
Given the characteristics of this region,
it won't lead to precipitation.

521
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:04,871
It's going to rain.

522
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:06,289
It will rain for sure!

523
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:08,332
Why is he getting worked up again?

524
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:11,127
Hey, can't you see the sky is clear?

525
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:13,296
I sent you the data.

526
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:16,340
This is a bomb.

527
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:18,176
-It's going to pour.
-Yes. I saw it

528
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:20,845
and we're having a meeting because of it.

529
00:36:20,928 --> 00:36:22,180
Sit here and wait.

530
00:36:22,763 --> 00:36:23,639
We don't have time.

531
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:25,683
A heavy rain advisory
should be issued right now.

532
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:27,560
Wait.

533
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:30,605
Look at the spike
in the ground temperature here.

534
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:32,607
Gangwon Office said it was temporary,

535
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:36,861
but it's very unstable,
so it can develop into a rain cloud.

536
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,280
Well…

537
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:41,282
Here.

538
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:43,326
But this is…

539
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:49,749
Metropolitan Office, what is it?

540
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:53,586
SEOUL METROPOLITAN OFFICE
OF METEOROLOGY

541
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:56,631
The clouds currently forming
in Gangwon Province

542
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:58,216
look unusual.

543
00:36:58,299 --> 00:37:00,468
Are you saying
they'll turn into rain clouds?

544
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:02,595
-Yes, within an hour.
-On what grounds?

545
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:07,475
Excuse me.

546
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:11,979
An hour ago, they were low-level clouds.

547
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:14,941
Now they're passing through Chuncheon
and developing rapidly.

548
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:16,651
I'll upload the data and explain.

549
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:30,414
There he goes again.

550
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:34,919
He's the one who predicted the hail.

551
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:38,214
-So?
-I thought you should know.

552
00:37:44,303 --> 00:37:47,014
Don't you know
how dry the atmosphere is now?

553
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:49,642
Even if the rain clouds are large enough
to be caught as an echo,

554
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:53,562
they'll evaporate
before reaching the metropolitan area.

555
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:57,525
What if they continue
to absorb water while moving north?

556
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:03,030
They're being supplied with water vapor

557
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:05,491
as the lower layer temperature
of the region rises.

558
00:38:05,574 --> 00:38:09,203
Just an hour ago, the clouds
were only two kilometers thick.

559
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:13,040
Currently, they're 5 to 6km thick.

560
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:16,419
Moreover, the surface temperature
in the east metropolitan area is high.

561
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:19,547
Due to the unstable atmosphere,
clouds are more likely to develop

562
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,674
and enter the region
rather than evaporate.

563
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:23,676
If my prediction is correct,

564
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:25,845
in two to three hours,

565
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:28,180
there will be heavy rain
in the metropolitan area.

566
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:36,314
Just tell me
the probability of precipitation.

567
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:38,274
Yes, it's…

568
00:38:38,357 --> 00:38:40,067
It's about 18.7 to 18.8 percent.

569
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:42,236
-That's correct.
-So…

570
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:46,741
the probability of evaporation
is more than 80 percent.

571
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:50,411
Why are you making it sound difficult
by using decimal points?

572
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:52,913
Acting Director Jin.

573
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:55,082
What do you think?

574
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:52,473
I checked again and they said
the wedding hall deposit wasn't paid.

575
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:54,767
They told Ki-jun that

576
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:57,770
the reservation will be canceled
if he doesn't pay by today.

577
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:05,694
It's not even midsummer.

578
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:07,154
It's mid-March.

579
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:10,491
A heavy rain advisory
with less than a 20 percent chance?

580
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:12,493
I don't think we need to worry
with these numbers.

581
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:15,913
Isn't the default setting wrong

582
00:40:15,996 --> 00:40:18,249
because you're stuck
with the seasonal formula?

583
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:22,461
Forecasting is about probabilities.

584
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:24,588
-That's why you're always wrong.
-What?

585
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:26,549
The 17th summer typhoon last year,

586
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:29,009
the winter fog this year,
and the hail too.

587
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:31,262
You relied on probability,
and see what happened.

588
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:33,097
Why have forecasters at all

589
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:35,766
when we can have
supercomputers calculate the weather?

590
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:40,938
POWER OFF

591
00:40:42,314 --> 00:40:44,608
Weather is about a flow.

592
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:47,278
You can't change the flow
with a few numbers.

593
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:50,281
The basics of weather is variability.

594
00:40:50,364 --> 00:40:52,950
Even a small phenomenon
can greatly affect it.

595
00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:54,410
Are you trying to lecture me?

596
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:56,370
No.

597
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:58,998
I'm just saying that
the important points are different.

598
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:01,584
Enough. Move aside.

599
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:03,711
All right.

600
00:41:04,378 --> 00:41:06,005
Acting Director Jin.

601
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:08,299
You need to make a decision.

602
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:17,933
Why don't we do this?

603
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:27,860
The hypothesis suggested by
the Metropolitan Office is reasonable,

604
00:41:27,943 --> 00:41:29,695
but the probability is too low.

605
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:31,655
The evidence is weak,

606
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:33,616
and no cases were provided.

607
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:36,327
-I collected all the data and…
-Calm down.

608
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:40,581
We'll decide whether to issue
a heavy rain advisory after an hour.

609
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:45,211
Meanwhile, the Metropolitan Office
should provide additional data.

610
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:48,464
Let's move on to the weekend weather.

611
00:41:56,722 --> 00:41:58,098
Hey!

612
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:07,024
He won't just let it go.

613
00:42:08,734 --> 00:42:10,819
-Do you know him?
-He's Lee Si-woo.

614
00:42:11,445 --> 00:42:13,572
I've worked with him
on Baengnyeong Island.

615
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:14,907
I see.

616
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:16,992
He's usually quite gentle.

617
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:20,788
But when it comes to weather,
he's very tenacious.

618
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:23,874
It's a little unsettling

619
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:27,169
because there's always something
when he's persistent.

620
00:42:35,594 --> 00:42:37,012
Hi. It's me.

621
00:42:37,846 --> 00:42:39,306
Yes. What is it?

622
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:41,100
You can issue a special alert, right?

623
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:43,769
Yes, so what?

624
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:45,938
I have a feeling.

625
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:48,232
Hey.

626
00:42:49,149 --> 00:42:50,442
No.

627
00:42:51,193 --> 00:42:52,945
I can't do it.

628
00:42:53,028 --> 00:42:55,281
You missed the hail.
Will you miss the rain too?

629
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:57,032
Hey.

630
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:02,913
You're nuts.

631
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:07,459
Anything else from other offices?

632
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:08,502
-No.
-No.

633
00:43:10,337 --> 00:43:11,797
That's it for the meeting.

634
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,674
-Good work.
-Good work.

635
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:15,175
Good work.

636
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:21,974
Are you insane? What are you doing?

637
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:28,439
What's going on?

638
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:32,151
The Metropolitan Office issued
a heavy rain advisory just now.

639
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:33,777
What?

640
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:38,574
Did you do this?

641
00:43:39,992 --> 00:43:43,579
Why did you do this
without reporting it to the director?

642
00:43:43,662 --> 00:43:45,956
Because she wouldn't listen.

643
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:48,208
She also ignored the hail signals

644
00:43:48,917 --> 00:43:50,586
because the probability was low.

645
00:43:52,087 --> 00:43:53,088
What is he saying?

646
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:58,093
The Metropolitan Office
had reported hail signals.

647
00:43:58,177 --> 00:43:59,470
The forecaster you just saw

648
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:01,513
detected them first.

649
00:44:02,681 --> 00:44:04,350
It was less than five percent.

650
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:06,101
It was close to five percent.

651
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:12,650
So, that's why you declared severe weather
without your superior's permission?

652
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:14,318
Is it?

653
00:44:14,401 --> 00:44:17,613
If you'll do whatever you want,
why do you need superiors and a system?

654
00:44:18,447 --> 00:44:21,367
Why don't you set up
a forecasting company then?

655
00:44:22,868 --> 00:44:23,952
I'm sorry.

656
00:44:29,416 --> 00:44:32,628
A severe weather alert has been issued.
So keep your posts.

657
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:34,922
I need to talk to you.

658
00:44:36,382 --> 00:44:37,424
Okay.

659
00:44:48,644 --> 00:44:50,062
This is insane.

660
00:44:57,152 --> 00:44:59,655
Why didn't you report it to Director Choi?

661
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:03,117
Because the probability was low.

662
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,329
So…

663
00:45:08,163 --> 00:45:10,791
why did you skip the director
and make that decision?

664
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:12,042
Why?

665
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:19,049
Okay.

666
00:45:19,716 --> 00:45:21,301
File a report.

667
00:45:23,303 --> 00:45:25,013
Shut up.

668
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:27,808
If it doesn't rain in an hour, we're dead.

669
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:30,102
Don't worry. It'll rain.

670
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:32,312
Hey.

671
00:45:33,647 --> 00:45:36,608
You're the one who declared severe weather
without permission from Headquarters?

672
00:45:38,944 --> 00:45:40,779
Yes. So?

673
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:45,284
Do you know how much it costs
when a severe weather alert is issued?

674
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:48,120
Will you take responsibility
if this forecast is wrong?

675
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:52,124
Did you take responsibility

676
00:45:52,207 --> 00:45:55,377
for being wrong about the hail forecast?

677
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:56,670
What?

678
00:45:56,753 --> 00:45:59,840
No, you weren't wrong.
You didn't report it at all.

679
00:46:00,549 --> 00:46:02,384
I heard about your situation.

680
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:05,512
But even if you're busy
getting ready for your wedding,

681
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:08,557
you shouldn't miss any weather reports.

682
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:11,894
Forecasters shouldn't neglect
the safety and convenience

683
00:46:11,977 --> 00:46:14,104
of the people for personal reasons.

684
00:46:16,356 --> 00:46:18,609
-Hey.
-My name is Lee Si-woo.

685
00:46:19,526 --> 00:46:20,402
Lee Si-woo.

686
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:22,696
Will I take responsibility
for this forecast?

687
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,741
Let me tell you about my responsibilities.

688
00:46:25,824 --> 00:46:29,077
I use the data I've obtained
to predict the weather and make forecasts.

689
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:31,205
I'm confident in my forecast.

690
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:34,625
That confidence comes
only when I do my best.

691
00:46:34,708 --> 00:46:36,627
The same goes with the hail forecast.

692
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:40,839
Are you telling me
that I didn't do my best?

693
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:42,925
You have a wedding coming up,

694
00:46:43,008 --> 00:46:45,511
-so I understand.
-Hey, you!

695
00:46:45,594 --> 00:46:47,221
I'm Lee Si-woo of the Metropolitan Office.

696
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:50,599
Hey, Lee Si-woo.

697
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:52,518
Wait right there.

698
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:54,978
Why? Are you coming?

699
00:46:55,562 --> 00:46:56,855
I said wait.

Heavy rain advisory
has been issued across the seas.

709
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:37,646
Coast guards on dispatch,

710
00:47:37,729 --> 00:47:40,190
please notify nearby ships
of safety guidelines.

711
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:42,025
-Roger that.
-Copy.

712
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:54,454
-Please check.
-Okay.

713
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:14,016
There's nothing to check. They'll be fine.

714
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:15,267
Goodness.

715
00:48:17,686 --> 00:48:19,062
-Come closer.
-Hurry.

716
00:48:20,105 --> 00:48:22,232
Cover it up and place the sandbags.

717
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:23,984
Pull it up more.

718
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:31,283
More?

SEOUL METROPOLITAN OFFICE
OF METEOROLOGY

722
00:48:58,602 --> 00:48:59,770
What are you doing?

723
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:04,983
The woman from Headquarters
won't actually come, right?

724
00:49:05,817 --> 00:49:07,486
Of course not.

725
00:49:07,569 --> 00:49:08,528
Jeez.

726
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:12,699
She probably got mad
because you were being rude and…

727
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:14,785
Goodness. She's here.

728
00:49:23,001 --> 00:49:26,129
Well, I'm done here.
I think she's here to see you.

729
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:27,214
Mr. Lee Si-woo?

730
00:49:38,183 --> 00:49:40,686
-You really came.
-Do you know me?

731
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:41,978
No.

732
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:44,439
Then how dare you talk about me like that?

733
00:49:45,524 --> 00:49:47,526
That's because you kept ignoring my--

734
00:49:47,609 --> 00:49:49,695
Didn't you think
that maybe I was being careful?

735
00:49:49,778 --> 00:49:52,781
In any case, you didn't report it,
so a lot of people suffered--

736
00:49:52,864 --> 00:49:54,950
Do you know how much
public manpower is used

737
00:49:55,033 --> 00:49:57,452
every time a special advisory is issued?

738
00:49:57,536 --> 00:50:00,622
Billions could have been wasted
because of an under five percent chance.

739
00:50:00,706 --> 00:50:02,332
I had no choice but to consider that.

740
00:50:02,916 --> 00:50:04,793
Still, you can't ignore the signals.

741
00:50:04,876 --> 00:50:07,921
If it rains an hour later
than our forecast,

742
00:50:08,004 --> 00:50:09,673
people mock us for making an error.

743
00:50:09,756 --> 00:50:11,299
What if the heavy rain advisory is wrong?

744
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:14,928
So you chose to make a safe bet.

745
00:50:15,011 --> 00:50:16,263
What?

746
00:50:16,346 --> 00:50:19,015
"Since we'll get criticized either way,

747
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:21,143
let's choose not to waste money."

748
00:50:21,727 --> 00:50:24,479
"Let's try to avoid
one of the two arrows."

749
00:50:25,105 --> 00:50:26,606
Is that what you were thinking?

750
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:32,279
If so, don't worry.

751
00:50:32,362 --> 00:50:34,823
It will rain. I'm certain of it.

752
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:43,206
Who do you think you are?

753
00:50:43,915 --> 00:50:47,002
Si as in time and Woo as in rain.
Rain that falls at the right time.

754
00:50:47,836 --> 00:50:49,004
I'm Lee Si-woo.

755
00:51:13,278 --> 00:51:14,613
It's going to rain.

756

NAMSAN

00:51:48,313 --> 00:51:49,439
Gosh, that's…

758
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:52,818
Sir.

DONGJAK BRIDGE

760
00:51:57,989 --> 00:51:59,491
I can see that.

761
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:02,494
Gosh, look at that.

762
00:52:08,041 --> 00:52:09,709
Would you look at that?

763
00:53:36,588 --> 00:53:37,881
Take it.

764
00:53:38,548 --> 00:53:39,841
It's pouring.

765
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:16,002
CALL ME WHEN YOU SEE THIS

766
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:17,587
THIS IS URGENT

767
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:19,172
Did you check with Ki-jun?

768
00:54:22,342 --> 00:54:24,719
MESSAGES

769
00:54:24,803 --> 00:54:28,306
I emailed Mr. Han to confirm the
final draft of your wedding invitation,

770
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:29,933
but he didn't reply.

771
00:54:30,016 --> 00:54:31,142
Please confirm.

772
00:54:31,226 --> 00:54:33,019
-Your honeymoon reservation
-The wedding return gifts

773
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:34,604
-has been canceled due to late payment.
-you ordered

774
00:54:34,688 --> 00:54:36,398
-has been canceled.
-Your wedding dress is ready.

775
00:54:36,481 --> 00:54:38,149
-But I got a cancellation message.
-Please call us.

776
00:54:38,233 --> 00:54:39,192
It's been canceled.

777
00:54:39,275 --> 00:54:40,485
-Please confirm.
-Please call us.

778
00:54:48,159 --> 00:54:50,954
KI-JUN

779
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:56,042
The number you are calling
is currently switched off.

780
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:58,878
Please leave a message after the tone.

781
00:55:19,649 --> 00:55:20,900
What did she say?

782
00:55:25,572 --> 00:55:27,949
Ha-kyung isn't picking up either.

783
00:55:30,201 --> 00:55:33,329
I think we'll lose
the wedding hall reservation.

784
00:55:56,269 --> 00:55:57,645
Doors opening.

785
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:06,237
Doors closing.

786
00:56:58,414 --> 00:57:00,333
The signals were simple.

787
00:57:07,298 --> 00:57:09,843
Sometimes they were sounds.

788
00:57:17,517 --> 00:57:20,311
Sometimes they were colors…

789
00:57:47,881 --> 00:57:49,591
and sometimes they were vibrations.

790
00:58:32,759 --> 00:58:35,386
They kept signaling to me…

791
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:41,184
that nothing was safe in this world.

792
00:58:59,619 --> 00:59:00,954
Just in case.

793
00:59:10,505 --> 00:59:11,422
You're home.

794
00:59:24,102 --> 00:59:25,436
What's all this?

795
00:59:26,062 --> 00:59:27,146
It's food for our trip.

796
00:59:28,773 --> 00:59:30,817
It'll stop raining tomorrow morning.

797
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:32,569
So there's no problem.

798
00:59:38,908 --> 00:59:40,118
This?

799
00:59:40,201 --> 00:59:41,452
It's for an emergency.

800
00:59:41,536 --> 00:59:42,870
We aren't going camping.

801
00:59:42,954 --> 00:59:45,248
I booked a cottage.

802
00:59:51,671 --> 00:59:52,589
Let's break up.

803
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:56,342
What?

804
00:59:57,218 --> 00:59:58,511
I want to break up.

805
01:00:06,185 --> 01:00:07,562
Why all of a sudden?

806
01:00:08,146 --> 01:00:09,355
It isn't all of a sudden.

807
01:00:10,815 --> 01:00:14,110
I've been wanting to break up
with you for a long time.

808
01:00:46,392 --> 01:00:49,312
2 MONTHS LATER

809
01:00:49,395 --> 01:00:51,147
That star is so bright.

810
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:54,025
The sky cleared up nicely.

811
01:00:54,901 --> 01:00:56,861
That's a satellite, Director Choi.

812
01:00:56,944 --> 01:00:58,196
Hey.

813
01:00:58,863 --> 01:01:01,491
Why are you always so rigid?

814
01:01:01,574 --> 01:01:03,576
I know it's a satellite.

815
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:05,244
All right.

816
01:01:07,413 --> 01:01:10,333
That's why I always trusted what you said

817
01:01:10,416 --> 01:01:12,585
even when I don't trust my wife.

818
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:17,632
I should've been rigid then too.

819
01:01:18,549 --> 01:01:19,676
When?

820
01:01:20,343 --> 01:01:21,761
The day it hailed?

821
01:01:29,185 --> 01:01:31,437
Sir, I think you should check this.

822
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:33,523
What? Gosh…

823
01:01:36,818 --> 01:01:37,944
What is it?

824
01:01:39,112 --> 01:01:40,321
Never mind.

825
01:01:48,788 --> 01:01:51,916
We were on alert all week
because of the fog.

826
01:01:52,834 --> 01:01:56,546
I know you didn't report it because
you were afraid I'd be overwhelmed.

827
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:00,758
I was presumptuous.

828
01:02:00,842 --> 01:02:03,511
Would it have been different
if you had reported it?

829
01:02:04,262 --> 01:02:05,304
No.

830
01:02:05,805 --> 01:02:07,598
I would have ignored it too.

831
01:02:08,099 --> 01:02:10,810
The fog was extremely thick
in the west coast area that day.

832
01:02:11,602 --> 01:02:14,856
Thanks to you,
we prevented a major collision

833
01:02:14,939 --> 01:02:16,899
like the Yeongjong Bridge collision.

834
01:02:18,234 --> 01:02:20,027
Nobody knows that though.

835
01:02:21,487 --> 01:02:23,072
So what if no one knows?

836
01:02:23,156 --> 01:02:24,657
It's great that nobody was hurt.

837
01:02:26,909 --> 01:02:28,411
I hope you return soon.

838
01:02:28,494 --> 01:02:31,706
Didn't you know? I resigned.

839
01:02:32,707 --> 01:02:33,833
Sir.

840
01:02:34,917 --> 01:02:38,588
I'm going to do everything
I wasn't able to do.

841
01:02:38,671 --> 01:02:39,797
Why did you--

842
01:02:41,549 --> 01:02:43,176
My wife is really happy.

843
01:02:48,848 --> 01:02:49,766
Thanks.

844
01:02:50,725 --> 01:02:52,351
If it wasn't for you,

845
01:02:52,435 --> 01:02:54,854
I wouldn't have retired this early.

846
01:02:55,855 --> 01:02:59,400
I'm relieved that you're taking my place.

847
01:03:08,826 --> 01:03:11,245
My life is about to be flooded

848
01:03:11,329 --> 01:03:13,206
because I missed the signals.

849
01:03:18,503 --> 01:03:20,963
What you see now isn't everything.

850
01:03:21,047 --> 01:03:24,300
Both weather and people need time
for you to get to know them better.

851
01:03:24,383 --> 01:03:26,636
The weather isn't always bad.

852
01:03:27,595 --> 01:03:29,889
There are sunny days

853
01:03:30,389 --> 01:03:32,725
as well as windy and rainy days.

854
01:03:34,769 --> 01:03:36,729
There's always a reason for everything.

855
01:03:54,455 --> 01:03:57,166
PERSONNEL CHANGES
JIN HA-KYUNG: DIRECTOR

856
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:58,876
Will she be okay?

857
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:00,795
Well, she's smart.

858
01:04:01,420 --> 01:04:05,883
Supercomputers are smart too,
but they make mistakes.

859
01:04:06,551 --> 01:04:10,429
Experience is the most
important quality for directors.

860
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:13,891
She'll always play by the book
and be picky.

861
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:17,270
Then what's going to happen?

862
01:04:18,104 --> 01:04:19,230
What do you mean?

863
01:04:19,313 --> 01:04:22,316
Deputy Director Han will be back
from his honeymoon soon.

864
01:04:23,192 --> 01:04:25,403
Will they be okay working together?

865
01:04:25,486 --> 01:04:27,280
They have no choice.

866
01:04:27,363 --> 01:04:29,365
They can't just quit their jobs.

867
01:04:29,448 --> 01:04:32,743
People around them
are going to be stressed out.

868
01:04:32,827 --> 01:04:34,579
It'll be like walking on egg--

869
01:04:35,496 --> 01:04:37,248
-Hello.
-Hello.

870
01:04:37,832 --> 01:04:39,292
-Hello.
-Hello.

871
01:04:39,375 --> 01:04:40,543
-Hello.
-Hello.

872
01:04:40,626 --> 01:04:43,880
SAFE COUNTRY, PEACEFUL PEOPLE

873
01:04:50,344 --> 01:04:51,470
Did you see it?

874
01:04:52,096 --> 01:04:53,598
The personnel changes?

875
01:04:53,681 --> 01:04:55,558
Yes, I saw it.

876
01:04:58,144 --> 01:04:59,437
Well…

877
01:05:00,187 --> 01:05:02,231
about Deputy Director Han.

878
01:05:04,108 --> 01:05:05,318
I guess you didn't see it.

879
01:05:06,611 --> 01:05:08,487
The transfer was canceled.

880
01:05:12,325 --> 01:05:14,327
He's good at responding to the press.

881
01:05:14,410 --> 01:05:17,371
So the Administrator
wants to keep him around

882
01:05:17,455 --> 01:05:19,624
because he thinks highly of that.

883
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:22,752
I see.

884
01:05:23,794 --> 01:05:25,129
Will you be okay?

885
01:05:26,672 --> 01:05:29,383
I'd be happy if you stayed
with Chief Team Two.

886
01:05:29,467 --> 01:05:33,304
But you'll have to keep working with him.
Is that all right?

887
01:05:41,228 --> 01:05:44,690
Why don't you follow
in the footsteps of your colleagues

888
01:05:45,399 --> 01:05:47,860
and aim for higher-ranking positions?

889
01:05:50,363 --> 01:05:53,449
You have enough field experience.

890
01:05:54,367 --> 01:05:57,536
Are you telling me
to leave the Forecast Bureau?

891
01:05:57,620 --> 01:06:02,416
There's an opportunity for you
to go to the WMO for dispatch training.

892
01:06:04,669 --> 01:06:06,921
You have more than enough experience.

893
01:06:07,505 --> 01:06:09,715
I'll write a reference letter.
What do you say?

894
01:06:12,843 --> 01:06:15,429
-It's in Geneva, Switzerland, right?
-Yes.

895
01:06:15,513 --> 01:06:18,432
It's for one year and it can be extended.

896
01:06:19,308 --> 01:06:23,062
There was more than just a breakup
at the end of an office romance.

897
01:07:12,570 --> 01:07:15,281
Tae-kyung, did you take my TV?

898
01:07:15,364 --> 01:07:16,741
It's not there?

899
01:07:17,908 --> 01:07:20,995
Mom, did you move Ha-kyung's TV?

900
01:07:21,495 --> 01:07:23,289
Why would I?

901
01:07:23,998 --> 01:07:26,542
I know how angry she gets
when I move her stuff.

902
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:30,254
Why? Is her TV missing?

903
01:07:30,337 --> 01:07:32,256
No. Never mind. I'm hanging up.

904
01:07:56,197 --> 01:07:59,617
OFFICE OF SPOKESPERSON
HAN KI-JUN

905
01:08:06,582 --> 01:08:07,416
No.

906
01:08:09,794 --> 01:08:12,171
OFFICE OF SPOKESPERSON
HAN KI-JUN

907
01:08:14,465 --> 01:08:16,509
Hello? What's up?

908
01:08:17,468 --> 01:08:18,511
What?

909
01:08:19,136 --> 01:08:22,848
Oh, I guess my finger slipped.

910
01:08:23,891 --> 01:08:26,727
I'm doing well, as always.

911
01:08:27,561 --> 01:08:28,562
Well…

912
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:32,441
did you perhaps take the TV?

913
01:08:32,525 --> 01:08:35,194
Yes, I took it.

914
01:08:36,153 --> 01:08:38,405
-The induction stove too?
-Yes.

915
01:08:38,489 --> 01:08:39,865
The toothbrush sanitizer too?

916
01:08:39,949 --> 01:08:42,743
You told me to pack up and leave.

917
01:08:43,244 --> 01:08:45,162
I thought you meant
I could take what I needed.

918
01:08:45,788 --> 01:08:46,831
No?

919
01:08:47,706 --> 01:08:50,668
How could you interpret it that way?

920
01:08:51,293 --> 01:08:53,170
I said take your stuff and leave.

921
01:08:53,879 --> 01:08:54,839
Hey.

922
01:08:55,339 --> 01:08:57,591
Technically, half of the stuff is mine

923
01:08:57,675 --> 01:08:59,385
because we paid for it together.

924
01:08:59,468 --> 01:09:01,053
I left the fridge behind,

925
01:09:01,137 --> 01:09:02,513
so I think we're even.

926
01:09:06,684 --> 01:09:08,686
What about the apartment registration?

927
01:09:09,478 --> 01:09:10,396
Listen, Ha-kyung.

928
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:13,482
I've been thinking about it,
so how about we do this?

929
01:09:14,525 --> 01:09:16,026
I'll give you your money back,

930
01:09:16,110 --> 01:09:17,319
and take it off your hand.

931
01:09:18,445 --> 01:09:19,530
Take what off?

932
01:09:19,613 --> 01:09:21,615
The apartment is under both our names.

933
01:09:22,241 --> 01:09:24,326
Rather than selling it to someone else,

934
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:25,619
it'll be better this way.

935
01:09:27,037 --> 01:09:28,205
You said it was alimony

936
01:09:28,289 --> 01:09:30,040
when you called the wedding off.

937
01:09:30,124 --> 01:09:32,459
I did. I said that but…

938
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:33,419
But?

939
01:09:33,502 --> 01:09:35,921
I checked the price and it went up a lot.

940
01:09:36,547 --> 01:09:37,423
So?

941
01:09:40,050 --> 01:09:42,303
Let's split it. Half and half.

942
01:09:45,514 --> 01:09:47,057
As expected,

943
01:09:47,141 --> 01:09:51,562
a breakup wasn't enough
to end things with this bastard.

944
01:10:25,137 --> 01:10:26,513
Like the wind,

945
01:10:26,597 --> 01:10:29,808
an affair is invisible
but it always leaves a trace.

946
01:10:29,892 --> 01:10:30,976
You can go about your day and leave.

947
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:33,812
I'm the new Severe Weather Forecaster
of Chief Team Two.

948
01:10:33,896 --> 01:10:34,813
I was appointed here.

949
01:10:34,897 --> 01:10:37,608
I think Director Jin will
get replaced soon.

950
01:10:38,192 --> 01:10:39,026
Han Ki-jun!

951
01:10:39,985 --> 01:10:41,695
-I have no choice.
-So what? Do you want to fight?

952
01:10:41,779 --> 01:10:43,030
Director Jin.

953
01:10:43,113 --> 01:10:46,033
I was curious about how you were doing.

954
01:10:46,116 --> 01:10:47,284
Cheers!

955
01:10:47,368 --> 01:10:49,495
I'm never going to date
a colleague ever again.

956
01:10:50,037 --> 01:10:52,498
Come on. You never know.

957
01:10:53,332 --> 01:10:57,544
