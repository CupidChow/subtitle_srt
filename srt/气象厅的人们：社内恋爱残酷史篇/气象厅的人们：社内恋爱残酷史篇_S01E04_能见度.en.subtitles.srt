1
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:52,135
My first job at this workplace

2
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,804
was assessing prevailing visibility.

3
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:59,017
I came here every morning
at the same time,

4
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:02,145
observed my targets,

5
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:04,731
and calculated visibility.

6
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:06,274
PREVAILING VISIBILITY

7
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,987
MOUNT INWANG
VISIBILITY: 1.6KM

8
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,447
BAEGUNDAE PEAK

9
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:14,282
MOUNT BUGAK

10
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:18,745
MOUNT BUGAK
VISIBILITY: 2.9KM

11
00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:20,663
The thing that surprised me the most

12
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:22,332
while doing this task

13
00:01:23,374 --> 00:01:26,252
was that the average person's sight

14
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:30,256
was still good enough to be used

15
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,176
to assess visibility.

16
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:38,014
Despite the accuracy, however,
we have to rely on equipment

17
00:01:38,097 --> 00:01:41,851
because our vision is so easily blocked…

18
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:46,022
narrowed…

19
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:49,651
and distorted…

20
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,659
by external factors.

21
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,346
Did you get home safe?

22
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:42,555
DIRECTOR JIN HA-KYUNG

23
00:03:55,276 --> 00:04:01,783
EPISODE 4
VISIBILITY

24
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:07,288
The sky is hazy this morning.

25
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:11,542
The sky has become foggy
due to the drop in temperature last night.

26
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:14,587
In addition, the visibility level is low

27
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:16,214
due to the increase in fine dust.

28
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:18,800
We advise you to drive carefully to work.

29
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:45,201
Did you sleep well?

30
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:50,540
If we like each other, we can go out.

31
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:51,958
If not,

32
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,335
we won't.

33
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,087
So what are we?

34
00:04:58,172 --> 00:05:00,675
What are we to you?

35
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:08,933
I'm a director and you're a forecaster.

36
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:15,273
I'm just your senior at work.

37
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:16,482
That's all.

38
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:17,567
Despite our feelings?

39
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,610
It's a fleeting emotion.

40
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:20,695
Just ignore it.

41
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:23,281
But what if we regret it?

42
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:25,033
That's actually better.

43
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:27,118
At least that leaves
something to look back on.

44
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:29,245
You want me to date another colleague?

45
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,538
No.

46
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:32,957
I can't do that.

47
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:34,625
I won't.

48
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:40,256
But you have feelings for me.

49
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:53,853
I'm sorry you had to find out.
I apologize.

50
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:03,946
I don't want to apologize.

51
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:06,616
I'm not sorry that you found out

52
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:08,493
about my feelings for you.

53
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,118
Due to the thick fog,
a 14-car pileup occurred

54
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:54,163
on the Jungang Expressway
in Hoengseong early this morning.

55
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:57,667
We made an announcement
about the fog yesterday evening.

56
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,920
And breaking news regarding
the fog has been up since 10 p.m.

57
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:05,174
The visibility during
the collision was around 100m.

58
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,051
How about our forecast?

59
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:09,095
I believe we gave enough warning.

60
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:12,014
We continuously reported
that visibility could drop to 50m

61
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,600
due to the fog that appeared
at 2 a.m. in Hoengseong,

62
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:17,937
and repeatedly advised everyone
to drive safely.

63
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:20,189
Okay. That's good then.

64
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:23,734
What's the number
of cumulative cases in that area?

65
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:27,280
In the past three years,

66
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:30,783
there were 326 cases in Daegwallyeong,
115 cases in Chuncheon,

67
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,910
and 109 cases in Cheorwon.

68
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:35,830
They should have slowed down
in an area where fogs were common.

69
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:37,165
Goodness.

70
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:39,667
Don't you think

71
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,836
we should come up
with more detailed measures?

72
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,673
I'll discuss it with the other directors.

73
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:49,135
Okay. Let's begin the meeting then.

74
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:52,513
We'll begin the morning meeting of May 11.

75
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:53,848
Satellite Center?

76
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:57,101
Last night's intense radiative cooling
in the inland area

77
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:59,979
-Gosh. What a competent woman she is.
-caused the thick fog

78
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:01,481
-Is she still single?
-in Gangwon Province.

79
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:03,774
-She almost turned out like Ms. Oh.
-But clear skies are expected

80
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:05,234
-Who?
-as the sun comes out.

81
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:06,903
Assistant Director Oh Myung-ju.

82
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:09,030
She used to be
a promising future director.

83
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:12,033
But she married a colleague
and took two maternity leaves.

84
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:14,076
Now, she'll never get promoted.

85
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,662
What does that have to do
with Director Jin?

86
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:19,582
You know Deputy Director Han
at the Office of Spokesperson?

87
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:21,042
-Thick eyebrows?
-Yes.

88
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:24,795
They broke up
a month before their wedding.

89
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,757
-Isn't that better for her?
-What?

90
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,258
She could do much better.

91
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:32,220
You're right. The smarter a woman is

92
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:34,388
the more capable her man should be.

93
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:38,059
-How much money have you saved up?
-Darn it.

94
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:40,686
It's always raining on my parade.

95
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,864
Do you guys have nothing to write about?

96
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:53,157
Gather around.

97
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:56,702
All right.

98
00:08:57,745 --> 00:08:59,413
What's your take on this?

99
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:01,499
Come on.

100
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:04,460
Why do you think collisions
always occur there?

101
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:06,754
Look.

102
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:09,590
During the collision,
the visibility was ten meters.

103
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:14,595
They could barely see that far.
But what did the forecast say last night?

104
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:18,516
Korea doesn't give fog advisories.

105
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:19,767
-Didn't you know?
-Right.

106
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,519
Why don't we give them?

107
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:23,104
Is it the same abroad?

108
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:26,399
-No. Other countries have them.
-That's exactly it.

109
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:28,734
The keyword here is "why?"

110
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,654
Why doesn't Korea have fog advisories?

111
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:34,657
Perhaps, they're taking a defensive stance

112
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,867
to avoid any criticism.

113
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,996
Focus on that idea
and write up a special article.

114
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,539
Include this incident

115
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:44,083
and those from the past. Okay?

116
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,627
Aren't we pushing it too much?

117
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:48,713
Is it because your husband works there?

118
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:50,673
No, that's not why.

119
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:52,341
Then write something.

120
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:55,595
A journalist doesn't drag
their private life into work.

121
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,430
Will that be all?

122
00:09:57,513 --> 00:09:58,973
Now, work. This is good.

123
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:04,186
-No, I'll do this.
-Okay.

124
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:10,860
Are you coming from the gym?

125
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,779
I hurried over
after hearing about the collision.

126
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,072
I see.

127
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,167
Did you get home safe yesterday?

128
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,209
Yes.

129
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:31,505
By the way,
who was the woman who left first?

130
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:34,175
Woman? He was with a woman?

131
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:37,720
I'm not sure who you're talking about.

132
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:39,639
Come on. I saw everything.

133
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:41,682
I saw her leaving through the back door

134
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:43,684
when we arrived there.

135
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:44,810
What?

136
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:47,021
Do you have a girlfriend?

137
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:54,111
No. Not yet.

138
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:55,112
You do have one.

139
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:56,739
You can't keep a poker face.

140
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:59,784
I can tell that you have a woman.

141
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:07,416
We're not official yet.

142
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,503
You broke up not long ago,
and you're dating again?

143
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:12,505
How did you meet her? Was it a blind date?

144
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:13,714
Or at a club?

145
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:17,259
No, I met her through work.

146
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:19,345
Does she work here?

147
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:21,222
Do we know her?

148
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:22,473
Is that true?

149
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:23,599
Really?

150
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:25,351
Forecaster Lee!

151
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:32,066
Please submit a distribution chart
of the fog in Hoengseong

152
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:33,818
organized in ten-minute intervals

153
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:35,778
an hour before and after the collision.

154
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:39,240
Did you not get that? Do I--

155
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:40,658
No, ma'am. I did.

156
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:42,868
One hour before and after the collision

157
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:44,161
in ten-minute intervals.

158
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,414
Right now, please.

159
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:48,457
Yes, ma'am. I'll start right away.

160
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:51,502
What was that?

161
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:53,170
Was she hazing him?

162
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:55,714
I think so. Did he do something wrong?

163
00:11:58,092 --> 00:11:59,718
DREAM REALTY

164
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:04,557
-Yes?
-We have a problem.

165
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,934
I'm afraid the contracted buyer

166
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:09,603
can't go through with the purchase.

167
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:10,604
Why not?

168
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:12,815
There were some issues with the loan.

169
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,401
-I see.
-What do you say?

170
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:18,362
If you're in a hurry,
we could lower the price.

171
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:21,699
Must I do that?

172
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:24,452
You'll sell the apartment
quicker that way.

173
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:33,335
Let me think about it and call you back.

174
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:09,413
You know Deputy Director Han
at the Office of Spokesperson?

175
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:13,167
They broke up
a month before their wedding.

176
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,211
-Isn't that better for her?
-What?

177
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:16,795
She could do much better.

178
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:19,089
You're right. The smarter a woman is

179
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:21,008
the more capable her man should be.

180
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:31,101
What's with your writing these days?

181
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:33,062
What's wrong?

182
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:36,774
I know it's just an in-house publication,

183
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:38,359
but still, it's too sloppy.

184
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:40,027
Your previous column too.

185
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,696
Anyone could say,
"Don't catch a cold in between seasons."

186
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,741
Even kids could say that,
so was that necessary?

187
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:47,910
You didn't say much last time.

188
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:50,412
I was only lenient

189
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:53,582
because you were busy
preparing for your wedding.

190
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:58,045
I thought you'd get back on track,
but what is this?

191
00:13:58,128 --> 00:14:00,923
Goodness. You can't keep this up.

192
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:02,633
I won't be lenient anymore.

193
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:04,593
I wasn't being sloppy…

194
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:08,514
-I'm sorry, sir.
-You talk well

195
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:10,266
in front of the cameras.

196
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:12,893
Can't you put in some
of that effort into your writing?

197
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:14,228
I'll rewrite it, sir.

198
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:16,647
Stay on your toes, will you?

199
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:18,232
Yes, sir.

200
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:19,650
-Okay?
-Yes, sir!

201
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:21,819
Rewrite it.

202
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:22,945
Gosh.

203
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:43,465
Were you scolded?

204
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:45,676
No, I wasn't.

205
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,428
What was it about?

206
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:49,221
I said I wasn't scolded.

207
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:53,100
What is it? Why are you here?

208
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:57,313
The 14-car pileup
on the expressway in Hoengseong

209
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:59,356
was due to the fog.

210
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,650
What about it? We forecasted it correctly.

211
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:02,902
I know.

212
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:05,613
I'd like to do an interview about that.

213
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:08,407
Could you find someone
from the Chief Forecasters for me?

214
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,077
We're busy right now. Maybe later.

215
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:14,496
This is pretty urgent for me.

216
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,582
I need to submit it by the end of the day.

217
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:18,834
Don't you know how busy they are?

218
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,253
They can't be at your beck and call.

219
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,672
You didn't have to get irritated.

220
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,424
You're a spokesperson for them.

221
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:27,968
Am I not allowed
to ask you to find someone

222
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:29,428
from your own department?

223
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:31,722
-I'll…
-I'm a reporter.

224
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:34,558
I get it. Just give me some time, okay?

225
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,185
I need to take care of something--

226
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,312
Forget it. I'll do it myself.

227
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:45,694
Come on.

228
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:49,156
Things are tough enough for me as it is.

229
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:51,700
Why did she have to make it worse?

230
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,689
Here's the chart you wanted.

231
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:24,149
I'm not sure why you need it, though.

232
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:28,570
Please refrain from small talk
during working hours, Forecaster Lee.

233
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:35,119
Thank you. You can go now.

234
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:39,999
What? Do you have something to say?

235
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:42,251
No, ma'am. I don't.

236
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:52,011
She's definitely upset over something.

237
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:53,262
I know.

238
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:07,818
Here you go.

239
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:12,573
What's going on?

240
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:16,744
-What do you mean?
-Why is she upset with you?

241
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:19,621
Because I made small talk at work.

242
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:23,584
I know she's not the type
who gets upset over something like that.

243
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:25,335
So tell me.

244
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:29,673
What are we to you?

245
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:31,925
I'm a director and you're a forecaster.

246
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,510
That's all.

247
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,722
She's putting up a wall.

248
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:39,808
And why would she need to do that?

249
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:42,519
"Don't think I'm easy
because I'm the youngest director."

250
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:45,230
"How dare a rookie like you
get cheeky with me?"

251
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:47,107
Maybe that's it.

252
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:48,776
Did you get cheeky again?

253
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:55,365
I told you Headquarters didn't suit you.

254
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:57,826
Right? I said
it'd be very different up here.

255
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,078
Gosh.

256
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,998
And we're talking about Director Jin.

257
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:06,001
She's a meticulous perfectionist.

258
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:07,753
You're right.

259
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:10,214
She's more conservative than I thought.

260
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:12,174
She's not like you who's free-spirited.

261
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:13,967
I'm sure you two will keep clashing.

262
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,886
Well, it can't be helped.

263
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:19,723
Did you find a place yet?

264
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:20,766
Not yet.

265
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:24,394
The places I like are too expensive
and the cheap ones are too shabby.

266
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:27,564
Why do you ask? Will you rent me a room?

267
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:29,316
No. Never.

268
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:30,901
Try harder.

269
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:34,071
Also, stop being cheeky with Director Jin.

270
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:36,949
And you don't have time
to date right now. Take it slow.

271
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:49,920
The surface temperature
will drop again tomorrow morning

272
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:52,297
due to radiative cooling, right?

273
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:56,051
Yes. The temperature difference
is quite big there.

274
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:00,848
We can give the same details
on the fog as we did yesterday.

275
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:03,100
What if we extended the range?

276
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:04,935
-Where?
-Wouldn't that be too wide?

277
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:07,396
How about we break down the areas?

278
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:09,189
I think we should emphasize

279
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:12,568
the valleys, streams, and tunnels.

280
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:18,866
Fog is the thickest
between 3 a.m. and 7 a.m.

281
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:22,619
And during that time frame,
the expressway is the most populated.

282
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:26,999
Back off, will you?

283
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:30,460
Still, it wouldn't be effective
to encompass the entire region.

284
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:33,046
Plus, route three gets a lot of sunshine.

285
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,799
So the fog will clear up
immediately after sunrise.

286
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:38,969
Why? Are you uncomfortable?

287
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:45,142
According to the observational data
from yesterday,

288
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:47,394
that area had high relative humidity.

289
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:49,938
I know that region very well.

290
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:53,275
The fog is pretty intense
at this time of year.

291
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:56,486
You sure know a lot of things.

292
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:59,990
You knew a lot about the West Sea
since you'd been on a weather ship.

293
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:03,493
And now, you know about
the fog situation in Gangwon Province?

294
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:05,954
The former is true,
and I served in Gangwon Province.

295
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:09,416
I know the terrains
like the back of my hand.

296
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:11,376
As for changes in climate,

297
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:14,213
I've experienced them firsthand
numerous times

298
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,506
unlike you who only looked at monitors.

299
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:18,675
What are you doing right now?

300
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:21,595
As a severe weather forecaster,
I'm appealing to the director.

301
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:28,936
Forget it.

302
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,730
-Let's give a comprehensive warning.
-Okay.

303
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:34,608
No, we must break down the areas
and give separate warnings.

304
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:36,401
Especially near the tunnels and bridges.

305
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:39,029
-Forecaster Lee.
-During the hail

306
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:40,364
and the rain,

307
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:42,407
I was right.

308
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:51,333
Judging by how most accidents
on the Hoengseong expressway

309
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,377
occur mainly in May and June,

310
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,128
I agree with her.

311
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:56,213
Did you hear that?

312
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:59,633
But if we take
the terrains into consideration,

313
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:01,051
I agree with him too.

314
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:03,512
-Did you hear that?
-In any case,

315
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:08,308
it's a fact that Gangwon Province
will be foggy tomorrow morning.

316
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:12,521
First, let's report the parts
that you've already agreed on.

317
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:13,897
-What about the rest?
-And the details?

318
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:15,107
You…

319
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:18,068
We'll have to continue our discussion.

320
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:19,945
If there's no agreement,

321
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:21,822
we'll hand it over to the night team.

322
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:24,032
Time's up already.

323
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:26,952
Okay?

324
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:30,956
Okay?

325
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:32,666
This is Headquarters.

326
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:34,793
We just sent you information on the fog.

327
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:36,086
Did you check?

328
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:37,879
I see.

329
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:41,216
First, please inform that region
of the fog tomorrow morning.

330
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:43,302
As for the details…

331
00:21:48,598 --> 00:21:51,476
I'll hand them over myself
as soon as they're ready.

332
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,602
Goodbye.

333
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:07,034

SEOUL AWARD CERTIFICATE
NUBO, MATCHMAKING SERVICE

335
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:14,416
Your daughter is
a Grade Five civil servant.

336
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:15,584
That's correct.

337
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:19,004
And that's not all.

338
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:21,006
Among all the competent test-takers,

339
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:23,342
she was the second one to get accepted.

340
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:24,509
I see.

341
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:27,596
Mom, it's not too late. Let's go home.

342
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:28,764
Be quiet.

343
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:30,766
Ha-kyung will be furious if she finds out.

344
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:32,768
Go first if you're scared.

345
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:33,935
I'm all done.

346
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:35,437
How's the result?

347
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,315
One minute. Your daughter's grade is…

348
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:41,276
I'm sure she's in the top rank.

349
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:43,487
Like prime beef.

350
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:46,865
How could you compare her to beef?

351
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:48,492
She's not some meat.

352
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:50,327
Shut it!

353
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:54,998
-She's Grade Eight.
-What?

354
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:57,000
Grade Eight?

355
00:22:57,584 --> 00:23:00,504
That's actually not bad.

356
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:05,342
Hold on.

357
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:07,928
How could she be Grade Eight?

358
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:11,181
She was always at the top of her class.

359
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:14,351
As I said before,
marriage is about two families

360
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:16,228
joining together.

361
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:19,231
There are many factors
to take into account other than her job.

362
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:21,483
One's personal information is important.

363
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:24,444
But one's parents and siblings

364
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:27,614
play a big role in determining the grade.

365
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:28,907
Are you

366
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:32,452
looking down on her
for having a single parent?

367
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:35,080
No, that's not why.

368
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:38,583
I'm afraid you don't have enough wealth.

369
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:41,920
It's not easy for a mother
to raise two kids to begin with,

370
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:44,214
so how could you expect me to be wealthy?

371
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:46,049
Unbelievable.

372
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:48,176
See? We should have just left.

373
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:50,137
Only those whose parents

374
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,848
have at least 20 billion won
are in Grade One.

375
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:56,852
Many doctors and lawyers

376
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:58,812
are in Grade Seven.

377
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:03,358
Even doctors and lawyers
are in Grade Seven?

378
00:24:03,441 --> 00:24:05,610
Let me say this again.

379
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:06,903
Grade Eight consists

380
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:09,823
of employees from large companies
and civil servants.

381
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:11,741
It's not that bad, ma'am.

382
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:13,743
I can guarantee that we can find someone

383
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:16,413
who has a similar background
to your daughter's.

384
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:17,581
Let's go.

385
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:25,714
All right.

386
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:34,055
Now, should we come up
with a detailed plan

387
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:35,849
for your daughter's marriage?

388
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:42,772
INNOVATIVE WEATHER SERVICES
A STEPPING STONE TO PUBLIC SAFETY

389
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:46,318
You seem to be busy all day.

390
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:48,695
Yes, I'm preparing to do an interview

391
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:49,988
for a special article.

392
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:55,535
Why do you ask?
Do you have something to say?

393
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:58,246
That forecaster from before
was Lee Si-woo, right?

394
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:02,000
How did you know his name?

395
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:04,169
I heard he broke up not too long ago.

396
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:07,339
So?

397
00:25:08,381 --> 00:25:09,424
Hook me up.

398
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:14,387
There's plenty of fish in the sea.

399
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:17,390
Why would you want to date a colleague?

400
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:18,767
People will talk.

401
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,518
It's only dating.

402
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:24,773
And I'm sick of coming here
only to write articles.

403
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:27,317
I want to date someone too. Please?

404
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:28,902
I'm not sure.

405
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:32,280
I'm not close enough
to hook someone up with him.

406
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:36,451
Reporter Chae. Hey.

407
00:25:36,534 --> 00:25:38,787
Wait for me.

408
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:55,345
Forecaster Lee is quite popular, right?

409
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:57,180
I'm not sure.

410
00:25:57,264 --> 00:26:00,392
I wonder. Whom could he be dating?

411
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:03,228
Why are you curious about that?

412
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:08,358
I think she works here.

413
00:26:09,192 --> 00:26:10,235
How come?

414
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:12,237
He said they met through work.

415
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,032
But that doesn't have to mean
that she works here.

416
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:17,909
I saw her at the pub last night.

417
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:21,162
As soon as we arrived,
she fled through the back door.

418
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:23,331
It's obvious he's dating a colleague.

419
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:25,333
He said they aren't official.

420
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:27,627
Well, I think that's what he said.

421
00:26:28,336 --> 00:26:30,297
So you were listening.

422
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:33,967
It wasn't intentional. I just overheard.

423
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:36,803
Don't hate him too much.

424
00:26:36,886 --> 00:26:38,555
He's still a newbie.

425
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,557
I never hated him.

426
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:45,395
Anyway, I'll let you know
if I hear anything else.

427
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:48,315
I'm dying to find out who she is.

428
00:26:56,364 --> 00:26:58,575
Office romance will be the death of me.

429
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:00,952
THE ATMOSPHERE

430
00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:06,249
-See you tomorrow.
-Goodbye.

431
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:07,584
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

432
00:27:09,627 --> 00:27:10,670
Goodness.

433
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:13,965
The night team is already here.

434
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:17,677
Why would you go out of your way
and write up the fog details?

435
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:20,889
I told the Gangwon Office
that I'd send it to them by midnight.

436
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:23,683
I said not to get cheeky,
not go out of your way to help her.

437
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:26,269
I'm hoping this will
help me win her favor.

438
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:27,437
Goodness.

439
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,522
-Don't go home too late, okay?
-Okay.

440
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:30,857
-See you.
-Good luck.

441
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:45,205
Do you need any help?

442
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:47,665
No, thank you.

443
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:50,168
Really? Goodbye, then.

444
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:51,252
Goodbye.

445
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:54,881
Turn around.

446
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:57,008
Turn around.

447
00:27:57,801 --> 00:27:59,010
Turn around.

448
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:02,180
She didn't turn around.

449
00:28:04,265 --> 00:28:05,767
Darn it.

450
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:50,979
Excuse me.

451
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:54,357
Can you spare me some time?

452
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:56,651
For what?

453
00:28:58,278 --> 00:28:59,904
It's for an article I'm writing.

454
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:01,865
I need a director's opinion.

455
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:04,784
If you're uncomfortable,
I can ask someone else.

THEMED STORY FOR JUNE

458
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:25,096
Yes.

459
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:31,311
What's this about? "May"?

460
00:29:31,394 --> 00:29:33,062
-That's your theme?
-Yes.

461
00:29:35,231 --> 00:29:36,357
Let's see.

462
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:38,151
May…

463
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,822
In May, the weather is nice
and people like to go outside.

464
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:43,782
Right.

465
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:48,286
How about you share tips
on how to utilize the weather forecast?

466
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:49,704
-Should I?
-Yes.

467
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,499
Then for the title…

468
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:54,209

THEMED STORY FOR JUNE

478
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:38,336
There have been
many fog-related accidents lately.

479
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:41,047
It's not limited to only recent events.

480
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:42,924
The temperature range is wide
in late February,

481
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:45,426
early April, mid-May,
late August, and early October,

482
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,345
so fogs appear often in those months.

483
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:49,514
And that is why accidents

484
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:51,558
occur more often.

485
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:54,227
But it's true that there were

486
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:56,604
many fog-related accidents
in that region lately.

487
00:30:57,647 --> 00:31:00,483
The Seohae Bridge probably has
a similar number of accidents.

488
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:03,486
By the way,

489
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:06,322
why doesn't our country
give fog advisories?

490
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:12,036
They're not that effective
because the fogs are very localized.

491
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,873
To give severe fog warnings,
we need to set up equipment

492
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:20,003
that can monitor
moisture particles every two kilometers.

493
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:23,631
But we can't afford to do that
with the budget that we have.

494
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:26,759
So you're saying it's due
to a lack of money and equipment?

495
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:28,261
You're not just choosing not to?

496
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:33,766
What is it that you want to hear?

497
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:36,144
I'm just looking for the facts.

498
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:41,858
The recent collision
in Hoengseong happened

499
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:45,570
because the drivers' visibility
dropped due to the fog.

500
00:31:46,362 --> 00:31:49,490
It's not that our forecast
of the fog was incorrect.

501
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:51,117
Those are the facts.

502
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,037
That's up to the public to judge.

503
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:05,882
How are you at home?

504
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:07,425
Well…

505
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:10,637
-I'm okay.
-Really?

506
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,721
Yes.

507
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:15,016
I see. Still, it's going
to be awkward for some time.

508
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:17,185
Hold on.

509
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:18,853
Were you like this too?

510
00:32:20,813 --> 00:32:22,398
You know me.

511
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:25,360
I hated being away from my family,

512
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:28,404
so I always brought them with me
wherever I was dispatched.

513
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:31,074
-Right.
-I think it was in my second year.

514
00:32:31,157 --> 00:32:34,410
I had to go somewhere alone
because my kid was preparing for college.

515
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:35,745
I see.

516
00:32:35,828 --> 00:32:37,956
And after I went back home,

517
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:41,376
it took a while to fully settle in.

518
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:43,878
Right? This is normal, right?

519
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:46,714
That's not what I'm getting at.

520
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:49,842
I'm telling you to take more initiative.

521
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:53,680
Okay? If you keep distancing yourself
because you feel awkward,

522
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:56,265
then you're bound to become an outsider.

523
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:57,350
Understand?

524
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:00,937
I didn't mean I was one.

525
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,982
-Anyway, keep that in mind.
-All right.

526
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:09,362
How long will it take for me

527
00:33:09,445 --> 00:33:11,364
to finally settle in?

528
00:33:11,447 --> 00:33:13,199
One to two months? Half a year?

529
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:14,784
That depends on you.

530
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:17,537
Right.

531
00:33:36,222 --> 00:33:37,473
What are you doing?

532
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:46,274
It must be something funny.

533
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:50,987
What is it?

534
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:54,407
Why are you looking at my phone?

535
00:33:55,324 --> 00:33:56,743
I didn't see anything.

536
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:01,956
And so what if I do? We're family.

537
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:14,093
Gosh.

538
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:29,192
Do you need help with anything?

539
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:30,359
I'm fine.

540
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:32,987
This one? Let me help.

541
00:34:36,824 --> 00:34:39,869
-Goodness.
-You're unbelievable!

542
00:34:40,703 --> 00:34:42,955
You should have just stayed put.

543
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:45,583
Why would you try to help me
and cause a ruckus?

544
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:48,086
I was only trying to help.

545
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:50,671
You can only help if you know how to.

546
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,632
You don't know how to manage a house.

547
00:34:55,134 --> 00:34:58,679
Don't you think you guys
are being too harsh on me?

548
00:34:59,847 --> 00:35:02,850
Fine. I'm sorry that we had
to live apart for 14 years.

549
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:05,561
But we had no choice.

550
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:09,607
Did I want to move out? Did I?

551
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:13,486
We just couldn't afford to move around.

552
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:16,697
It wasn't like
I was seeing other women either.

553
00:35:17,323 --> 00:35:19,283
I always provided for you two.

554
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:21,536
Then don't you think you could have said,

555
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,913
"Thank you. Welcome home."

556
00:35:23,996 --> 00:35:26,457
You could have
at least said something nice.

557
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:29,335
If I were a dog,
you'd be happy to see me again.

558
00:35:29,418 --> 00:35:31,838
Must I walk on eggshells around you guys?

559
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:37,093
-Are you done?
-Yes.

560
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:40,096
Do you think earning money for us

561
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:43,516
and not cheating on your wife
makes you a good husband?

562
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:47,061
Then what else? What more do I need to do?

563
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:50,356
Where were you when Bo-mi was born?

564
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,693
When she was born…

565
00:35:53,776 --> 00:35:55,153
I was--

566
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:57,488
You were aboard
a weather ship in the South Sea.

567
00:35:58,072 --> 00:36:01,450
You finally got to see her
when she was well over 100 days old.

568
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:04,287
Right. But there was nothing I could do.

569
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:06,706
What about during
her elementary entrance ceremony?

570
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:09,750
I was…

571
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:13,254
You sent a single text
from Baengnyeong Island.

572
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:16,591
I know. I had explained it to you.

573
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:18,593
The situation back then

574
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:20,887
didn't allow me to come here.

575
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:22,847
Again, you had no choice.

576
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:26,017
Did you know?

577
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:31,606
There was a time when our neighbors
thought I was a single mother.

578
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:32,815
What?

579
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:35,234
Who thought that?

580
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:36,402
Everyone did.

581
00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:38,905
Everyone in this neighborhood.

582
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:41,616
When Bo-mi was sick,

583
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:44,994
I carried her on my back
and rushed her to the hospital.

584
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:48,372
When I took her to the supermarket,

585
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:50,750
they'd give me
free products because they thought

586
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:52,376
I was raising her by myself.

587
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:56,505
I didn't know what to say.

588
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:59,258
You were crazy about the weather

589
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:02,470
that you were always
at sea or in the mountains.

590
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:04,347
You were so busy

591
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:06,432
that you'd only come home
every now and then.

592
00:37:06,515 --> 00:37:08,601
And the next morning, you'd be off again.

593
00:37:08,684 --> 00:37:10,394
Were you ever there for Bo-mi?

594
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:11,729
Were you?

595
00:37:15,149 --> 00:37:17,026
That was how Bo-mi and I lived

596
00:37:17,985 --> 00:37:19,820
for the past 14 years.

597
00:37:21,697 --> 00:37:23,532
Do you get that, Dong-han?

598
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:19,130

"Those Who Fight Against Weather."

603
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:11,766
How adorable.

604
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:26,947
What's wrong?

605
00:39:27,656 --> 00:39:30,368
Isn't he that psycho from our wedding?

606
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:33,579
No. I think you're mistaken.

607
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:35,706
Are you sure?

608
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:38,042
It was definitely not him.

609
00:39:57,686 --> 00:40:00,147
WHY DOESN'T KOREA…

610
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:19,875
Goodness, you startled me!

611
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:25,881
-She'll probably get mad, right?
-Yes.

612
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:30,678
Maybe I should have asked
before signing her up.

613
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:32,138
Seriously?

614
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:35,683
That was what I kept telling you

615
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:37,768
while following you around all day.

616
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:39,478
That we should ask her first.

617
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:41,897
I did it for her.

618
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:43,566
No, you did it for yourself.

619
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:45,693
You're embarrassed
to tell others about her,

620
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:48,612
so you're desperately trying
to marry her off to a decent man.

621
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:50,698
You little brat.

622
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:06,380
Did you get home safe?

623
00:41:10,259 --> 00:41:11,927
Yes. Where are…

624
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:15,014
No.

625
00:41:15,097 --> 00:41:17,308
I have to speak formally.

626
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:20,644
Forecaster Lee.

627
00:41:21,395 --> 00:41:23,522
Thank you for your hard work today.

628
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:25,399
Are you still at…

629
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,111
Never mind.

630
00:41:30,362 --> 00:41:31,947
Never mind.

631
00:41:39,705 --> 00:41:40,581
LEE SI-WOO

632
00:42:07,316 --> 00:42:09,193
He's crazy about the sky.

633
00:42:18,285 --> 00:42:20,120
-How do I turn this off?
-Director Jin?

634
00:42:20,829 --> 00:42:23,040
Hello, Forecaster Lee. How's work?

635
00:42:23,123 --> 00:42:25,584
It's going well. I'm almost done.

636
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:27,378
Why did you call?

637
00:42:27,461 --> 00:42:30,839
Well, I just wanted to know
how the work was going.

638
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:33,717
Come on. Did you think
I'd bail and not do the work?

639
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:35,970
No, I wasn't doubting you.

640
00:42:36,595 --> 00:42:39,056
If that's not it, did you miss me?

641
00:42:40,474 --> 00:42:41,559
Don't get cheeky.

642
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:44,061
Then why did you call this late at night?

643
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:47,064
Well, I want you to find cases
from countries around the world

644
00:42:47,147 --> 00:42:50,901
that frequently have fogs like we do
and put them on my desk.

645
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:53,153
-What?
-And find out

646
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:55,406
which countries have fog advisories,

647
00:42:55,489 --> 00:42:59,285
what equipment they use,
and their budgets.

648
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:01,704
Are you serious?

649
00:43:02,871 --> 00:43:04,123
Do I look like I'm joking?

650
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:07,001
No, ma'am.

651
00:43:07,793 --> 00:43:10,713
Okay. I better see them
when I get to work tomorrow.

652
00:43:10,796 --> 00:43:12,798
-Goodbye.
-Yes, ma'am.

653
00:43:16,802 --> 00:43:18,762
Okay. That was smooth.

654
00:43:20,222 --> 00:43:21,473
What was that?

655
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:24,184
Why is she putting up such a high wall?

656
00:43:30,649 --> 00:43:33,819
INNOVATIVE WEATHER SERVICES
A STEPPING STONE TO PUBLIC SAFETY

657
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:35,571
Goodness.

658
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:40,492
-Hey.
-Hello.

659
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:43,245
What's all this?

660
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:47,041
Director Jin told me to look up countries
that frequently had fogs as well

661
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:50,336
and those that gave fog advisories.

662
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:53,422
So you pulled an all-nighter?

663
00:43:53,505 --> 00:43:55,591
It doesn't really matter
whether I sleep here

664
00:43:55,674 --> 00:43:57,009
or at the training center.

665
00:43:57,635 --> 00:44:01,180
Hey, don't smile like that.
You're breaking my heart.

666
00:44:01,263 --> 00:44:04,141
You have terrible dark circles right now.

667
00:44:04,224 --> 00:44:06,810
It's okay.
She said she needed these reports.

668
00:44:07,686 --> 00:44:09,146
Do you really think so?

669
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:11,649
These useless theses?

670
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:12,691
What?

671
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:16,612
-Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
-Yes.

672
00:44:17,696 --> 00:44:19,948
-What is it?
-There's this thing

673
00:44:20,032 --> 00:44:23,994
a senior does to teach
their cheeky subordinate a lesson.

674
00:44:24,953 --> 00:44:27,081
In other words, she's wasting your time.

675
00:44:28,248 --> 00:44:29,083
No way.

676
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:32,086
That can't be. Come on.

677
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:37,132
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

678
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:44,723
Is something wrong?

679
00:44:44,807 --> 00:44:47,351
No, ma'am. Nothing's wrong.

680
00:44:51,438 --> 00:44:52,481
What's all this?

681
00:44:52,564 --> 00:44:54,817
These are the reports
you asked for last night.

682
00:44:56,902 --> 00:44:59,780
By the way, you really needed them, right?

683
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:01,615
Did I waste my time?

684
00:45:02,616 --> 00:45:04,785
Of course not. Let me see.

685
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:07,663
Director Jin, you need to see this.

686
00:45:07,746 --> 00:45:08,914
What is it?

687
00:45:23,637 --> 00:45:24,930
Hey, Mr. Han.

688
00:45:25,722 --> 00:45:27,182
Are you serious?

689
00:45:29,268 --> 00:45:30,602
WHY DOESN'T KOREA HAVE FOG ADVISORIES?

690
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:33,147
INCOMPETENT KMA BLAMES IT ON TIGHT BUDGET!

691
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:36,775
REPORTER CHAE YU-JIN

692
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:40,612
Did you really not know?

693
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:50,456
I'm sorry, sir. I wasn't aware.

694
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:53,917
How could you not know
what your wife was writing?

695
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:30,037
-What is this?
-It's an article.

696
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:33,916
This wasn't what I said yesterday.

697
00:46:34,541 --> 00:46:37,211
A reporter shouldn't distort the facts.

698
00:46:37,794 --> 00:46:39,505
Exactly which part was distorted?

699
00:46:39,588 --> 00:46:40,464
I told you

700
00:46:40,547 --> 00:46:43,133
that we aren't simply choosing
not to give fog advisories.

701
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:44,718
And that's what I wrote.

702
00:46:44,801 --> 00:46:46,136
What's the problem?

703
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:50,140
I don't think you understand.

704
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:53,227
Taebaek and Hamgyong Mountains
lean toward the east,

705
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:57,105
and it's a tilted block where the east
has a steep slope, while the west is flat.

706
00:46:57,189 --> 00:47:00,108
The straight line
from Seoul to Wonsan is long and narrow.

707
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:02,653
It's the same shape
as the Chugaryeong Tectonic Valley.

708
00:47:02,736 --> 00:47:03,862
So?

709
00:47:03,946 --> 00:47:04,821
So what?

710
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:08,742
Do you still not get it?

711
00:47:08,825 --> 00:47:10,452
Meteorologists from around the world

712
00:47:10,536 --> 00:47:13,038
say that the country with
the most difficult conditions

713
00:47:13,121 --> 00:47:15,666
when it comes to observing
the weather is right here,

714
00:47:15,749 --> 00:47:17,125
the Republic of Korea.

715
00:47:17,209 --> 00:47:19,378
It's a peninsula
where 70 percent is mountainous.

716
00:47:19,461 --> 00:47:22,005
We have 11 major rivers and 1,206 dams.

717
00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:24,841
Plus, fogs are very localized.

718
00:47:24,925 --> 00:47:27,928
So I said we didn't give advisories
because they weren't effective.

719
00:47:28,011 --> 00:47:31,515
So how could you denounce us
by saying that we're incompetent?

720
00:47:33,141 --> 00:47:34,351
Oh, please.

721
00:47:34,851 --> 00:47:37,396
I thought you lacked the equipment for it?

722
00:47:37,479 --> 00:47:39,606
Lack of money and equipment
due to a tight budget.

723
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:43,735
That's an excuse
every government department often gives.

724
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:47,739
-Excuse?
-It's true.

725
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:50,158
Your yearly budget
is over 400 billion won.

726
00:47:50,242 --> 00:47:52,494
Do you think our citizens will understand

727
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:54,621
if you blame it on a lack of equipment?

728
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:56,164
Wouldn't it be a lame excuse?

729
00:47:57,082 --> 00:47:59,251
Other countries all have fog advisories.

730
00:47:59,334 --> 00:48:00,377
Give me an example.

731
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:01,878
The UK, the US,

732
00:48:01,962 --> 00:48:03,380
-Australia, and Japan.
-The UK?

733
00:48:04,756 --> 00:48:06,925
Do you know what their yearly budget is?

734
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:08,969
It's 1.6 trillion won.

735
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:10,679
That's four times more than us.

736
00:48:10,762 --> 00:48:12,180
The US? Japan?

737
00:48:12,264 --> 00:48:13,515
-Australia?
-Whatever.

738
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:15,475
You should have at least read

739
00:48:15,976 --> 00:48:17,644
some theses beforehand.

740
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:18,937
If not…

741
00:48:21,023 --> 00:48:23,567
you should have cross-checked
with someone you knew.

742
00:48:29,656 --> 00:48:32,409
Did you know about this
and turn a blind eye?

743
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:36,496
Did you want me to suffer
due to your personal feelings?

744
00:48:48,634 --> 00:48:49,551
It's my fault.

745
00:48:50,844 --> 00:48:52,679
I'll take care of it.

746
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:54,264
You can go back to work, Director Jin.

747
00:48:58,894 --> 00:49:00,103
You better do a proper job

748
00:49:01,813 --> 00:49:03,357
of dealing with the press.

749
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:12,491
You'll take care of it?

750
00:49:12,574 --> 00:49:14,743
Let's go somewhere quiet.
We can talk there.

751
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:17,621
Take care of what?

752
00:49:18,246 --> 00:49:19,748
The mess you've created!

753
00:49:19,831 --> 00:49:21,875
I should take care of it
since I'm in charge!

754
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:28,048
You should've done your research
before going up against her.

755
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:32,135
Ha-kyung beat all the competition
and became the youngest director.

756
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:33,512
So what?

757
00:49:34,096 --> 00:49:37,724
You confused probability of detection
with accuracy when you first came.

758
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:39,267
Yet you picked a fight with--

759
00:49:39,351 --> 00:49:40,811
Why are you bringing that up?

760
00:49:40,894 --> 00:49:43,772
You should have at least
discussed it with me beforehand.

761
00:49:43,855 --> 00:49:46,441
So I asked you
to find someone to interview yesterday.

762
00:49:46,525 --> 00:49:50,070
And I told you to wait! I could have
proofread it if you were unsure!

763
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:51,488
Why?

764
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:54,408
Reporters don't ask
their subjects to proofread.

765
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:56,201
I'm a journalist.

766
00:49:56,284 --> 00:49:59,204
It's my job to keep an eye on you
and hold you in check.

767
00:50:01,873 --> 00:50:03,083
Don't be ridiculous.

768
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:04,960
You're neither logical nor factual.

769
00:50:05,043 --> 00:50:06,753
All you do is ridicule your subjects.

770
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:09,673
-Ki-jun.
-Why did you lie if you're so great?

771
00:50:09,756 --> 00:50:10,966
Lie?

772
00:50:11,049 --> 00:50:12,467
I never lied.

773
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:13,552
Lee Si-woo.

774
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:17,013
You said you didn't know him.

775
00:50:26,398 --> 00:50:27,774
Are you sure about that?

776
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:50,464
I think she's getting an earful.

777
00:50:51,131 --> 00:50:53,759
I know.
Why did she have to do the interview?

778
00:50:54,634 --> 00:50:57,637
How could she have declined?

779
00:50:57,721 --> 00:51:01,057
Then people would think
she was still bitter about the breakup.

780
00:51:02,684 --> 00:51:06,438
This is why breaking up
with a colleague is painful.

781
00:51:06,938 --> 00:51:09,483
But then again, marrying a colleague

782
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:11,735
isn't something to brag about either.

783
00:51:22,996 --> 00:51:24,039
I'm sorry.

784
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:26,458
She needed help with her article.

785
00:51:26,541 --> 00:51:29,294
I should have been
more careful with my words.

786
00:51:29,377 --> 00:51:30,587
I don't want to hear it.

787
00:51:32,881 --> 00:51:35,509
So? Did you give her an earful?

788
00:51:37,093 --> 00:51:38,929
Yes. I was enraged.

789
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:40,972
Well done.

790
00:51:43,058 --> 00:51:46,394
The reporters bash us
all the time without good reasons.

791
00:51:46,478 --> 00:51:47,938
We should speak our minds.

792
00:51:48,688 --> 00:51:51,733
Think about it.
Even though we're known for being patient,

793
00:51:52,317 --> 00:51:55,487
we should correct them
if they get their facts wrong.

794
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:57,614
Good job.

795
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:00,283
Right. Speaking of which,

796
00:52:01,034 --> 00:52:02,828
I want you to write up a report.

797
00:52:04,371 --> 00:52:07,916
Provide reasons why our country

798
00:52:07,999 --> 00:52:10,168
doesn't give fog advisories.

799
00:52:10,752 --> 00:52:12,587
We can't openly refute the article,

800
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:15,048
so let's write a feature story.

801
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:17,843
-Okay?
-Yes, sir.

802
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:38,822
Why are you here?

803
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:47,080
Our director just told me
that you're writing

804
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:49,165
a refuting feature article.

805
00:52:50,375 --> 00:52:51,585
So?

806
00:52:52,168 --> 00:52:54,254
How long will it take?

807
00:52:54,963 --> 00:52:57,507
I'm not sure.
There's a massive amount of data.

808
00:52:58,091 --> 00:53:01,428
I'd appreciate it
if you could give me your rough draft.

809
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:03,346
I need it

810
00:53:04,556 --> 00:53:06,391
to write up the rebuttal.

811
00:53:10,145 --> 00:53:11,688
Did you really not know about it?

812
00:53:19,821 --> 00:53:22,407
No, I didn't.

813
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:27,037
I thought marriage meant

814
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:30,206
communicating and sharing
more with each other.

815
00:53:31,207 --> 00:53:32,834
I guess I was wrong.

816
00:53:35,462 --> 00:53:37,547
I'll give you the draft
by tomorrow morning.

817
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:38,548
Goodbye.

818
00:53:57,817 --> 00:53:59,402
What? She did what?

819
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:04,199
She signed you up
for a matchmaking service.

820
00:54:06,242 --> 00:54:07,953
I did it for you.

821
00:54:08,036 --> 00:54:10,497
You were acting like a complete fool.

822
00:54:11,373 --> 00:54:13,375
I couldn't tolerate it any longer,

823
00:54:13,458 --> 00:54:17,712
so I'm going to find a man
who's suitable with you--

824
00:54:19,047 --> 00:54:20,632
See? I told you.

825
00:54:22,467 --> 00:54:24,844
This is all for your sake.

826
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:27,138
Imagine if you got married

827
00:54:27,222 --> 00:54:28,974
to a successful man.

828
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:31,434
Your stature at work would grow.

829
00:54:31,518 --> 00:54:33,979
Is that bastard, Ki-jun,
getting in the way?

830
00:54:34,062 --> 00:54:35,647
I'm right, aren't I?

831
00:54:36,231 --> 00:54:37,899
I don't think you are.

832
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:40,568
Know when to go along with me, you brat.

833
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:54,499
-Ha-kyung, what's all that?
-What?

834
00:54:54,582 --> 00:54:57,210
-I think she's leaving.
-What?

835
00:54:57,293 --> 00:54:58,628
Are you serious?

836
00:54:59,671 --> 00:55:02,716
Delete all my data
from the matchmaking service

837
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:04,300
and unsubscribe.

838
00:55:04,384 --> 00:55:05,885
I'll come back then.

839
00:55:06,594 --> 00:55:08,888
Hey, I spent a lot of money on that.

840
00:55:11,057 --> 00:55:12,267
-Ha-kyung.
-Hey!

841
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:14,102
-Ha-kyung! Gosh.
-What did I tell you?

842
00:55:14,185 --> 00:55:15,186
That little…

843
00:56:53,993 --> 00:56:57,163
DIRECTOR JIN HA-KYUNG

844
00:56:57,247 --> 00:56:59,415
DIRECTOR JIN HA-KYUNG

845
00:57:03,586 --> 00:57:06,005
Hello, Director Jin. What's the matter?

846
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:08,466
-Were you sleeping?
-No, not yet.

847
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:09,968
Thank goodness.

848
00:57:10,051 --> 00:57:12,470
I'm looking at
the English case you analyzed.

849
00:57:12,971 --> 00:57:15,974
I think the translations are a bit off.
Can you help me?

850
00:57:26,192 --> 00:57:27,235
Which part?

851
00:57:27,318 --> 00:57:29,070
Page 12.

852
00:57:29,154 --> 00:57:31,156
The second chapter.

853
00:57:31,239 --> 00:57:32,866
Okay. One minute.

854
00:57:34,075 --> 00:57:35,201
I see.

855
00:57:45,837 --> 00:57:47,338
DIRECTOR JIN HA-KYUNG

856
00:57:49,841 --> 00:57:50,758
Hello?

857
00:57:51,426 --> 00:57:53,720
Page 27, Table 3-1.

858
00:57:53,803 --> 00:57:55,555
Do you have a graph for that?

859
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:10,153
Yes?

860
00:58:10,236 --> 00:58:12,614
Do you think we can use the Sydney case?

861
00:58:13,198 --> 00:58:14,616
It has too many singularities.

862
00:58:18,703 --> 00:58:20,121
Are you listening?

863
00:58:20,747 --> 00:58:23,416
Yes, I am. One minute.

864
00:59:04,165 --> 00:59:05,208
Why are you here?

865
00:59:05,291 --> 00:59:07,669
Because you keep calling
every five minutes.

866
00:59:07,752 --> 00:59:09,504
We last spoke 30 minutes ago.

867
00:59:09,587 --> 00:59:11,798
Staying up this late made me hungry,

868
00:59:11,881 --> 00:59:13,508
so I came out to eat.

869
00:59:13,591 --> 00:59:15,218
And I thought you'd be hungry too.

870
00:59:19,847 --> 00:59:21,140
Come in.

871
00:59:24,644 --> 00:59:25,728
Here.

872
00:59:29,607 --> 00:59:31,568
Oh, there are two different toppings.

873
00:59:32,485 --> 00:59:33,403
What's wrong?

874
00:59:33,987 --> 00:59:36,155
I don't like having
two different toppings.

875
00:59:37,991 --> 00:59:39,993
In that case, here.

876
00:59:40,994 --> 00:59:42,704
We can

877
00:59:43,955 --> 00:59:45,665
put two slices together.

878
00:59:49,669 --> 00:59:50,670
Is it good?

879
00:59:52,547 --> 00:59:53,548
Try some.

880
00:59:55,008 --> 00:59:56,384
-Like this?
-Yes.

881
00:59:56,467 --> 00:59:59,304
-Put them together?
-Yes, together.

882
01:00:00,013 --> 01:00:01,306
Then eat it.

883
01:00:01,389 --> 01:00:02,557
-Like this?
-Yes.

884
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:05,518
Isn't it good?

885
01:00:06,394 --> 01:00:07,770
Eat up.

886
01:00:22,994 --> 01:00:25,455
This is from
the Meteorological Office in the UK.

887
01:00:25,538 --> 01:00:28,333
There should be
the original copy of the article in there.

888
01:00:28,416 --> 01:00:29,834
-Can you find it?
-Sure.

889
01:00:31,961 --> 01:00:34,881
I've highlighted
the important parts in blue.

890
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:39,344
I think we should break it down.

891
01:00:39,427 --> 01:00:42,180
-Like that?
-Yes. It's a bit difficult to explain.

892
01:00:42,263 --> 01:00:43,806
So let's add that.

893
01:00:47,101 --> 01:00:48,811
I think it's pretty much done.

894
01:00:49,395 --> 01:00:50,521
What do you think?

895
01:01:09,457 --> 01:01:11,834
But you have feelings for me.

896
01:01:14,045 --> 01:01:15,588
I'm sorry you had to find out.

897
01:01:16,339 --> 01:01:17,548
I apologize.

898
01:01:22,095 --> 01:01:23,429
I don't want to apologize.

899
01:01:25,223 --> 01:01:26,724
I'm not sorry that you found out

900
01:01:27,225 --> 01:01:28,851
about my feelings for you.

901
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:33,898
Because they're genuine.

902
01:03:00,109 --> 01:03:02,069
What? I thought you left already.

903
01:03:02,153 --> 01:03:04,489
No, I had some work to do.

904
01:03:05,072 --> 01:03:07,992
I heard Lee Si-woo is already
in a new relationship.

905
01:03:10,536 --> 01:03:11,704
What do you mean?

906
01:03:12,872 --> 01:03:15,041
Everyone knows about it already.

907
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:17,960
He's dating a colleague.

908
01:03:30,264 --> 01:03:31,933
Isn't it so pretty?

909
01:03:33,434 --> 01:03:34,685
It is.

910
01:03:35,686 --> 01:03:37,772
This is my favorite time of the day.

911
01:03:38,397 --> 01:03:40,316
So you're a morning person.

912
01:03:42,777 --> 01:03:43,986
What else?

913
01:03:50,284 --> 01:03:53,412
I'm not going to put this place
on the market just yet.

914
01:03:56,874 --> 01:03:58,376
I'll be reminded of my past,

915
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:01,629
but I'm hoping to make new memories here.

916
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:07,051
What else?

917
01:04:08,135 --> 01:04:10,054
What? What more do you want to know?

918
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:11,848
Everything.

919
01:04:12,598 --> 01:04:16,561
I want to know
every single thing about you.

920
01:04:17,228 --> 01:04:18,479
Everything.

921
01:04:21,941 --> 01:04:23,359
I told you to be discreet.

922
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:25,945
We're not at work.

923
01:04:28,114 --> 01:04:29,949
You know that it's over for us

924
01:04:30,032 --> 01:04:32,285
if our colleagues find out, right?

925
01:04:33,995 --> 01:04:35,121
I do.

926
01:04:36,581 --> 01:04:40,543
And I'll have to keep putting up walls
between us in front of them.

927
01:04:42,086 --> 01:04:43,254
I'm also

928
01:04:44,171 --> 01:04:45,464
aware of that.

929
01:04:48,718 --> 01:04:52,889
Visibility is the maximum distance
that can be seen with the naked eye.

930
01:04:52,972 --> 01:04:54,265
Do you have a girlfriend?

931
01:05:02,565 --> 01:05:04,275
No. Not yet.

932
01:05:05,026 --> 01:05:07,570
-Right now, please.
-Yes, ma'am. I'll start right away.

933
01:05:07,653 --> 01:05:09,989
What was that? Was she hazing him?

934
01:05:10,072 --> 01:05:12,491
I think so. Did he do something wrong?

935
01:05:22,543 --> 01:05:26,380
But depending on the environment,

936
01:05:27,423 --> 01:05:29,300
this distance can easily
be blocked from view.

937
01:05:29,383 --> 01:05:33,763
Please refrain from small talk
during working hours, Forecaster Lee.

938
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:36,015
Thank you. You can go now.

939
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:37,975
It can be narrowed.

940
01:05:39,685 --> 01:05:41,646
What? Do you have something to say?

941
01:05:41,729 --> 01:05:43,481
No, ma'am. I don't.

942
01:05:47,401 --> 01:05:48,819
And it can be distorted.

943
01:05:50,363 --> 01:05:53,157
I'm never going to date
a colleague ever again.

944
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:54,492
I know.

945
01:05:55,493 --> 01:05:57,620
I think we should emphasize

946
01:05:57,703 --> 01:06:00,915
the valleys, streams, and tunnels.

947
01:06:11,217 --> 01:06:13,094
As for now,

948
01:06:13,177 --> 01:06:16,639
this is the visibility that only we have.

949
01:06:18,307 --> 01:06:21,519
What if others find out about us?

950
01:06:22,561 --> 01:06:25,147
Then we'll have to break up.

951
01:06:26,148 --> 01:06:27,525
Oh.

952
01:06:28,192 --> 01:06:29,318
How thrilling.

953
01:06:30,611 --> 01:06:33,489
I don't want to go through
another breakup like that.

954
01:06:34,115 --> 01:06:35,324
Okay?

955
01:07:04,061 --> 01:07:07,273
At times, we may encounter bad weather

956
01:07:07,356 --> 01:07:11,235
such as thick fog,
yellow dust, rain, or snow.

957
01:07:46,645 --> 01:07:48,022
But through those moments,

958
01:07:49,148 --> 01:07:50,649
we'll learn something.

959
01:07:54,904 --> 01:07:58,491
That the best way to narrow our visibility

960
01:07:59,116 --> 01:08:03,954
is by mustering the courage
to take a step closer to each other.

961
01:08:25,559 --> 01:08:26,477
I'm late.

962
01:08:46,413 --> 01:08:47,540
Wait for me.

963
01:08:48,124 --> 01:08:50,209
-No, you leave later.
-But aren't we late?

964
01:08:50,292 --> 01:08:51,168
No, you are.

965
01:08:59,218 --> 01:09:00,427
THE EFFECTIVENESS OF FOG ADVISORIES
AND CASES FROM ABROAD

966
01:09:23,826 --> 01:09:24,994
Hello?

967
01:09:53,355 --> 01:09:55,983
How did you cross paths
with Director Jin this morning?

968
01:09:56,066 --> 01:09:57,484
-We met on our way here.
-Pardon?

969
01:09:57,568 --> 01:09:58,402
It was a coincidence.

970
01:09:58,485 --> 01:10:01,363
Who said you could
keep crossing lines like that?

971
01:10:01,447 --> 01:10:03,866
Did you want to see
how I would react if I saw him?

972
01:10:03,949 --> 01:10:06,035
Call me outside like this
one more time and I'll…

973
01:10:06,118 --> 01:10:06,952
Forecaster Lee, you--

974
01:10:07,036 --> 01:10:09,163
Do you know of a heart
that asks for permission to beat?

975
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:11,957
Get it together, Forecaster Lee!

976
01:10:12,541 --> 01:10:13,709
It's the Metropolitan Office.

977
01:10:13,792 --> 01:10:15,920
They're saying the rain echo
over Seoul looks abnormal.

978
01:10:16,003 --> 01:10:17,296
