1
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:48,673
I went to college for geophysics
but dropped out.

2
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:50,800
After I was discharged from the army,

3
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:53,428
I passed the exam
and started working at the KMA.

4
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:56,389
I'm a Grade Seven
Severe Weather Forecaster.

5
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:05,273
What do your parents do?

6
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:10,612
He had a CT scan.

7
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:13,364
I see a 3cm-sized lump in his right lung

8
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:16,409
that could be a tumor.

9
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:20,246
I think he should receive a biopsy.

10
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,005
My mother passed away when I was seven.

11
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:32,592
And my father…

12
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:41,142
He used to work at construction sites,
but ever since he was injured,

13
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:44,103
he hasn't been working.

14
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:51,986
Oh, okay.

15
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:55,490
I see.

16
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:07,877
The rain said to the wind…

17
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:11,047
BIOPSY CONSENT FORM

18
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,841
For the biopsy,

19
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:15,093
he needs to be admitted
for one to two days.

20
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:18,221
Also, you need to sign here.

21
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:22,684
PATIENT OR GUARDIAN SIGNATURE

22
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:35,446
"You push."

23
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,367
"And I'll pour."

24
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:54,716
EPISODE 15
ENSEMBLE

25
00:02:58,845 --> 00:02:59,846
Where are you going?

26
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:00,930
What?

27
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,267
You're still here?

28
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:08,354
You shouldn't be walking around.
Go back inside.

29
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:11,232
Insurance companies
are so meticulous these days.

30
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:15,028
They accused me
of self-inflicted injury and blackmail

31
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:17,030
and called the police.

32
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:18,364
"Self-inflicted injury and blackmail"?

33
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:21,492
I was just walking down the street,

34
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:24,287
and a car rammed into me.

35
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:28,833
By the way,

36
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:32,503
didn't Si-woo come with you?

37
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:35,340
I had no time to call him.
I'll call him now.

38
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:38,217
No. Don't bother him.

39
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:41,679
I'll pay you for the hospital bills soon.

40
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:44,974
So don't press Si-woo for money.

41
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,434
Got it?

42
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:51,189
The doctor says you need a biopsy.

43
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:55,944
You're more naive than I thought.

44
00:03:56,027 --> 00:04:00,365
The hospital is doing that to make money.
Don't be fooled.

45
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:03,284
A CT scan showed something in your lung.

46
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:05,078
When you get old,

47
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:08,581
you're bound to have a few lumps.

48
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:14,671
Did you already know?

49
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:21,803
Well, if you have cash,
give me 10,000 won.

50
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,223
I want to get some rice and soup.

51
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,688
To get the biopsy done,

52
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:34,190
you need to be admitted to the hospital.

53
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,820
You should have it done.

54
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:41,114
It's up to you though.

55
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:43,491
There's no need to tell Si-woo.

56
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:47,787
You won't tell him, will you?

57
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:56,838
Jeez.

58
00:04:58,214 --> 00:04:59,382
I'm sorry.

59
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:25,742
What are you doing here?

60
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:31,205
I'm just thinking.

61
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:33,624
Why do you have to do that here?

62
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,210
It's none of your business.

63
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:37,754
By the way,

64
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:40,798
I met that Lee Si-woo guy.

65
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:43,968
Why did you see him?

66
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,678
What did you talk about?

67
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:49,140
Why do you want to know?

68
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:50,975
You said you broke up.

69
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:53,936
We did.

70
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,231
I'm glad you did.

71
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:59,901
Not all relationships
end up in marriage anyway.

72
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:01,694
Rest up. You must be tired.

73
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:37,814
Doors opening.

74
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:47,323
Doors closing.

75
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:40,501
While the early cold continues,

76
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:43,629
the first frost
was observed in Seoul today.

77
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:45,965
As the temperature has fallen sharply,

78
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:51,137
the current temperature in Seoul is 3°C
and the sensible temperature is 0.7°C.

79
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:54,765
The KMA predicts that the weather
will be chilly until this evening

80
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:59,020
and then recover to normal temperature
tomorrow afternoon.

81
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:01,856
However, in the case
of the central region,

82
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:04,484
the wind will blow rather strongly
from noon tomorrow.

83
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:07,111
Please be mindful of facility management.

84
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:10,865
The air is clean, and the average
daily fine dust concentration

85
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:13,242
across the country
is at a level of normal to good.

86
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:17,079
In the distant sea
in the central part of the East Sea--

87
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:24,378
If it's too much for you,
I'll go to the hospital alone.

88
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:30,343
Why won't you say anything?

89
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:33,304
What we talked about yesterday…

90
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:37,016
Can you give me some time
to think about it?

91
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,977
If we miss the timing,

92
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:41,562
we won't be able to do it.

93
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:50,571
I really don't think
we can afford to have a baby now.

94
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:54,075
Think about how much it'll cost.

95
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,203
The hospital, childbirth,
and postnatal care center.

96
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:59,205
If we move to a cheaper place,

97
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:02,333
we'll be able to pay for them somehow.

98
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:03,960
And then what?

99
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:11,592
We have to raise the baby.

100
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:13,386
Once my childbirth leave is over,

101
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:15,596
we'll have to hire a nanny.

102
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,473
I looked up how much they get paid

103
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,725
and it's almost the same
as my starting salary.

104
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:26,482
There are places like daycare centers.

105
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:30,236
How can we send
a newborn baby to a daycare center?

106
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:36,450
You go to work early in the morning,

107
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,035
and I work overtime all the time.

108
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:41,914
You could always take maternity leave.

109
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:45,918
I can't do that.

110
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:49,005
I took on my first regular column
since I started working.

111
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:51,048
I don't want to lose this chance.

112
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:52,925
I don't want to give up my career.

113
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:02,893
We were so unprepared when we got married.

114
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:06,647
So I want to be prepared
before I have a baby.

115
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:32,340
Yes, what is it?

116
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:33,466
Hi.

117
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:36,552
The biopsy will be done in the afternoon.

118
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:39,513
They need to do a blood test
and some other tests before that.

119
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:42,600
I see.

120
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:44,935
I have to fast starting from noon.

121
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,772
If I had known that,

122
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:50,024
I should have eaten a hearty breakfast.

123
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:51,984
Jeez, I'm hungry.

124
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:55,154
I'm on my way to work
and I have a meeting coming up.

125
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:57,031
Wait.

126
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:01,243
You haven't told Si-woo, right?

127
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,038
I'm hanging up.

128
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:14,507
NIGHT-DUTY ROOM

129
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:17,635
What? Why were you in there?

130
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:19,011
Did you stay up all night?

131
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:22,014
No, I didn't.

132
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:23,766
Haven't you found a place to live?

133
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:28,312
Please don't tell Director Jin.

134
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:30,815
Why not? Did you have a fight?

135
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:33,526
No. I don't want her to worry about me.

136
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:35,569
That's very touching.

137
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:37,780
Get lost.

138
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:46,622
Good morning.

139
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:49,583
-Thanks for the hard work.
-You're here early.

140
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:52,753
The weather is much colder
than I expected.

141
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:54,046
It'll be okay.

142
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:58,050
The continental anticyclone centered
in Siberia temporarily developed.

143
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:00,010
But the warm air is strong in the south,

144
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:01,470
so the cold will subside
tomorrow afternoon.

145
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,556
How did the ensemble forecast
predictions come out?

146
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:06,434
Ms. Lee, give me the ensemble predictions.

147
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:08,602
ENSEMBLE FORECASTING: A METHOD
THAT MINIMISES ERRORS AND UNCERTAINTIES

148
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,271
BY USING SEVERAL NUMERICAL MODELS
TO MAKE VARIOUS PREDICTIONS

149
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:12,231
-Well…
-Here you go.

150
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:16,318
The NWP model
and the ensemble predictions show that

151
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,904
the temperature
will rise again tomorrow afternoon.

152
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:19,989
They do.

153
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:23,284
Yesterday's forecast notice
won't need to be revised much.

154
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,871
Thanks to you,
I'll have it easy this time.

155
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:28,497
You better be thankful.

156
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:36,922
Good morning.

157
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:39,133
-Hello.
-Good morning.

158
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:40,217
Wait.

159
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:43,137
You left this at my place yesterday.

160
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:44,930
Oh…

161
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:47,641
Right.

162
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:50,311
I guess I was overwhelmed.

163
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:53,063
My mom tends to do that to people.

164
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,067
She said "mom."

165
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,367
Let's talk later.

166
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:08,954
Okay.

167
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:17,838
He meets her mother now?

168
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:20,966
That's great.

169
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,344
Don't count your chickens yet.

170
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:25,846
Things are going well.
Don't spoil the mood.

171
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:37,650
Yes?

172
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:39,068
Fasting…

173
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,820
means I can't drink water too, right?

174
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:44,615
I'm working. I'm sorry.

175
00:14:08,847 --> 00:14:10,349
Do you want coffee?

176
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:14,103
Thanks.

177
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:34,331
Well…

178
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:37,877
when was the last time
you called your father?

179
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:41,755
Why do you ask?

180
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:46,844
Because the weather got cold
all of a sudden.

181
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:49,054
I don't call him for things like that.

182
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:56,395
Is it so difficult
to call him to say hello?

183
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:58,355
It's not because it's difficult.

184
00:14:58,439 --> 00:14:59,732
It's because I don't want to.

185
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:05,696
But he's old now.
Why don't you give him a call?

186
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:09,199
My father isn't like other fathers.

187
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:11,452
He has never cared about me

188
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:14,330
or how I lived.

189
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,540
So why should I care about him?

190
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:20,502
Why do I have to call him
and see if he's doing all right?

191
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,504
Cold weather isn't a big deal.

192
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:28,427
Because you'll regret it.

193
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:33,974
You're acting like this
because you're mad at him.

194
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:38,437
But you might regret it later.

195
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:45,319
You won't be able to do
anything about it then.

196
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:46,445
No.

197
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:49,073
I'll never regret anything.

198
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:53,702
Because there isn't
a single moment I want to turn back

199
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:56,163
regarding him.

200
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:14,014
We quarreled because of his father.

201
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:17,017
I didn't ask.

202
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:20,479
Right.

-Deputy Director Han.
-Yes?

209
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,706
Aren't you going to eat?

210
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:25,335
Well, I'm not that hungry.

211
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:27,171
-You can go.
-Okay.

212
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:31,967
Director, will you go for lunch?

213
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,470
Is it lunchtime already?

214
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:37,848
All right. Let's go have lunch.

215
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:40,768
-Let's go, everyone.
-See you.

216
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:44,229
I'm not hungry. You should go.

217
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:46,356
-We'll get going then.
-Okay.

218
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,358
Let's go for lunch.

219
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:50,194
What should we have?

220
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:53,405
All right.

Yes.

226
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:28,357
Did you ask Bo-mi?

227
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,692
Yes, I did.

228
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:32,111
What does she want?

229
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:34,363
-She wants to eat out.
-She wants to eat out?

230
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:36,990
Doesn't she want a bag or clothes?

231
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:39,493
No. She doesn't want them.

232
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:41,703
She just wants to eat out with us.

233
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:44,206
I barely remember the last time

234
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:45,999
we all ate out together.

235
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,251
She probably has no memory.

236
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:50,003
It was when she was five or six.

237
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:51,755
Right.

238
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:55,384
Anyway, we went to a family restaurant
when she was a kindergartner.

239
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:58,053
We ended up having a big fight though.

240
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,597
Right. We did.

241
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:05,102
I called the academy
and canceled her evening class,

242
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:06,353
so book a restaurant.

243
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:07,479
Okay.

244
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,274
And tell me when and where to meet you.

245
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:12,526
For your information, Bo-mi likes pasta.

246
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:13,652
Pasta.

247
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,571
Okay. Got it.

248
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:23,078
Jeez, Um Dong-han.

249
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,663
What have you been doing?

250
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:28,417
I haven't done anything for them.

251
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:30,752
Senior Forecaster Um.

252
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:33,463
I printed out the ECMWF model data
and put it on your desk.

253
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:35,215
You can read it before the meeting.

254
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:36,633
I'll get the KIM ready too.

255
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:38,343
Okay. Thanks.

256
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:49,313
-Here's your citron tea.
-Thank you.

257
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:50,898
One hot citron tea, please.

258
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:53,483
Hi, Assistant Director Kim.
Long time no see.

259
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:55,194
-Have you been well?
-Of course.

260
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:57,237
It's so cold.

261
00:19:57,321 --> 00:20:00,032
Does it have to get cold so quickly?

262
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:03,285
I know, right? Everything changes
so abruptly in this county.

263
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:07,331
By the way, how is Ms. Kim
in your team doing?

264
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:08,874
What?

265
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:14,338
How many times have I told you that
comparing this with high-resolution data

266
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:17,466
increases the likelihood
of unusual weather forecasts?

267
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:19,551
You asked me to analyze the forecasts,

268
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,929
but not to compare them.

269
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:29,436
You've worked long enough
to know that you're supposed to.

270
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,273
-I'm sorry.
-Do it again.

271
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:35,525
Okay.

272
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,991
What is it? Do you need help?

273
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:45,160
No, it's okay.

274
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:55,379
I heard that the Policy Division
is trying to get her on their team.

275
00:20:57,005 --> 00:20:58,465
Didn't you know?

276
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:06,056
Cheer up. Drink this. It's citron tea.

277
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:08,517
Thank you.

278
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:25,033
Thanks.

279
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:32,457
Director Jin.

280
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:36,295
Don't you think the barometer
has a weird flow?

281
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:37,337
What about it?

282
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:40,215
Since the jet stream momentum
is maintained,

283
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:44,011
it's unlikely that the upper cut-off low
will easily move to the east.

284
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,558
According to the NWP model,

285
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:52,519
the temperature will go back up
tomorrow afternoon.

286
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:55,272
Yes, I know that.
Si-woo, come and look at this.

287
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,864
Here. What do you think?

288
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:10,787
It'd be better to analyze the possibility

289
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:13,248
by comparing it with the live data.

290
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:14,583
It's a bit strange, right?

291
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,585
-Yes.
-What's strange about it?

292
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:19,588
If you look here, the expansion
of the jet stream is too stable.

293
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:22,049
We rarely had
a case like this before, right?

294
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:24,134
Right. That's what bothers me.

295
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:30,140
Among the ensemble prediction results,

296
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:34,644
let's reanalyze the ensemble members
that are likely to prolong the cold wave.

297
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:37,189
Okay. Then I'll proceed with the meeting

298
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:39,649
based on the NWP model
that's been released.

299
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:40,609
Okay.

300
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:44,905
Assistant Director Shin. Can you send me
time series data for major regions?

301
00:22:44,988 --> 00:22:45,989
Okay.

302
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:53,246
-I just sent it.
-Okay.

303
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:14,184
How's your work going?

304
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:18,522
It's not going well.

305
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:21,358
Why not?

306
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:32,452
Because it's so sunny.

307
00:23:37,415 --> 00:23:40,293
Last time, it wasn't going well
because it was cloudy.

308
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:43,755
I guess she has low energy on a cold day.

309
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:46,883
Can I help you with anything?

310
00:24:03,441 --> 00:24:05,402
Mom, I'm going out for a minute.

311
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:12,576
Gosh, it's cold.

312
00:24:13,076 --> 00:24:15,829
Why didn't you tell me it was cold?

313
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:18,331
Where's my down jacket?

314
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:20,167
Mom! Where's my down jacket?

315
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:32,220
You're 40 years old.
Why don't you look for it yourself?

316
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:33,513
What's wrong, Mom?

317
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:35,056
Are you mad at me?

318
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,350
I have no energy to get mad at you.

319
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:39,561
You and Ha-kyung
should take care of yourselves.

320
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:41,605
Find your down jacket yourself.

321
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:53,533
The average temperature across the country

322
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:56,786
will drop by 10 to 15 degrees
as the cold air descends

323
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:59,664
due to the continental
anticyclone development.

324
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:01,875
All right.

325
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:04,419
So when do you think
this cold will subside?

326
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:08,340
Looking at the NWP model
and the ensemble forecast,

327
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:11,843
it seems that the temperature will
normalize by tomorrow afternoon, but…

328
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:15,305
"But"? But what?

329
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,851
We found something strange
in the ensemble prediction,

330
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:21,937
so we're analyzing it again.

331
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:24,439
"Something strange"?

332
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,028
ENSEMBLE PREDICTION

333
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:33,198
Of the ensemble's thirty-two forecasts,
four models predicted that

334
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:35,909
the cold wave
would last three days longer.

335
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:40,163
Aren't we running the ensemble
to see which one is more likely?

336
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:41,081
Yes…

337
00:25:41,748 --> 00:25:43,583
but this case is a bit different.

338
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:51,383
A strong jet stream continues

339
00:25:51,466 --> 00:25:53,843
to be maintained
in the upper atmosphere at 10km.

340
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:55,762
And the strong cut-off low

341
00:25:55,845 --> 00:25:58,974
at 5km is unable to move out to the east.

342
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:02,686
You said only four
out of thirty-two were like this.

343
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:05,522
Does that mean it will stay cold
for three to four more days?

344
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:06,648
Yes.

345
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:09,150
What do you want to do?

346
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:10,610
As things stand--

347
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:13,822
We may have to overturn the forecast.

348
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:33,174
Forecaster Lee.

349
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,136
Do you know what it means
to overturn the forecast?

350
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:38,471
Yes, I do.

351
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:46,354
Do you agree with him?

352
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:50,275
Overturn the forecast?

353
00:26:50,358 --> 00:26:53,194
-No way.
-If it's wrong, there will be an uproar.

354
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:05,040
Director Jin.

355
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:07,834
Do you agree with him?

356
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:10,920
Yes, I do.

357
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:32,275
Yes, sir. I'm almost there.

358
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:33,985
No, stop!

359
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:36,863
Turn around and go back to the KMA.

360
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:38,239
Why?

361
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:40,575
I already sent you tomorrow's articles.

362
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:45,372
The KMA is overturning the forecast.

363
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:46,581
What?

364
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:51,086
What are you going to do?

365
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:53,630
How will you handle the aftermath?

366
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:57,342
The entire Chief Team could turn on you.

367
00:27:57,425 --> 00:28:00,428
I can't ignore the numerical results
because of that.

368
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:03,515
Looking at the ensemble value,
isn't the previous forecast correct?

369
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:06,351
Senior Forecaster Um, Forecaster Lee,

370
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:08,561
and I think it's reasonable.

371
00:28:09,312 --> 00:28:10,313
So…

372
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:13,024
you're going to take the bullet
for what Si-woo said?

373
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:14,484
You know,

374
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:17,445
when I was younger,
whenever I caused trouble,

375
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:21,324
Director Choi supported me
and covered for me.

376
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:25,412
That's how I got here.

377
00:28:25,995 --> 00:28:29,040
Now, I want to do that
for my younger colleagues.

378
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:33,628
We're at that age and position.

379
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:42,095
I envy you.

380
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:47,475
Because you act,
think, and talk like an adult.

381
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:51,396
Are you making fun of me?

382
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:54,691
No, I'm not. I really mean it.

383
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:56,317
Why are you suddenly like this?

384
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:01,489
I'm often like this these days.

385
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:06,119
Nothing is free in this world.
You don't become an adult automatically.

386
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:11,166
I have to be responsible
for so many things.

387
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:13,543
It's really difficult

388
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:16,004
to be an adult.

389
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:22,135
All right.

390
00:29:22,218 --> 00:29:25,138
If the Chief Team wants to
overturn the forecast, so be it.

391
00:29:25,221 --> 00:29:27,390
We'll think about the aftermath later.

392
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:31,978
I'll release the forecast, Director Jin.

393
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:33,438
Thanks.

394
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:34,606
Bye.

395
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:47,118
SI-WOO'S FATHER

396
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:54,375
Yes, what is it this time?

397
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:57,504
Well, I just called

398
00:29:57,587 --> 00:30:00,089
because I'm getting the biopsy done soon.

399
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:01,966
I see.

400
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:04,302
Anyway…

401
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:08,139
thanks for booking the ward too.

402
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:11,142
I'm lucky to have such a good son.

403
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:15,146
I'll put in a good word
for you with Si-woo.

404
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:17,023
To be honest,

405
00:30:17,106 --> 00:30:19,984
you seem picky,
so you aren't exactly my type.

406
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:24,948
Still, Si-woo has a better eye
for women than I do.

407
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:26,199
Right?

408
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:28,326
Actually…

409
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:30,745
we broke up.

410
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,333
You broke up?

411
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:36,584
Why?

412
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:39,170
Did Si-woo do something wrong?

413
00:30:39,754 --> 00:30:40,588
No.

414
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,090
Then…

415
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,467
Did he disobey you, Director Jin?

416
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:46,052
No.

417
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,805
That's weird.

418
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:51,558
He'd never cheat on anyone

419
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:53,351
or get drunk and fight.

420
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:55,061
But did he?

421
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:57,188
No, he didn't.

422
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:58,898
Then why did you break up?

423
00:30:59,732 --> 00:31:02,235
And why are you good to me
when you've broken up?

424
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:05,238
Why did you make me get the tests done,

425
00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:06,990
and reserve a ward for me?

426
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:11,369
Because Forecaster Lee is still
a member of Chief Team Two.

427
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:14,080
As his senior colleague and director,

428
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:16,583
I can help you this much.

429
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:22,297
You still have feelings for him,
don't you?

430
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:26,551
I'm busy so I have to go.

431
00:31:26,634 --> 00:31:28,845
Good luck with your tests. Bye.

432
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:36,394
What an idiot.

433
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:39,772
He shouldn't have let her go.

434
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:44,110
Jeez.

435
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:09,469
Reporter Chae!

436
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:12,555
What are you doing here? Are you ill?

437
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:15,266
I just have a stomachache.

438
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:17,477
Are you…

439
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:19,312
What?

440
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:21,397
Goodness.

441
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:26,110
Is it constipation?

442
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:29,197
It's all because of stress.

443
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:34,202
Try this. It's a herb medicine.

444
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:36,120
It works within an hour.

445
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:39,540
Don't struggle.

446
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:41,960
Get medicinal help when you need it.

447
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:44,253
-All right?
-Okay.

448
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:45,672
I'll go in first.

449
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:47,382
See you.

450
00:32:57,642 --> 00:33:00,561
AREUM OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY
YOUR RESERVATION HAS BEEN CONFIRMED

451
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:16,744
I'll give you a brief overview first,

452
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:18,454
and then take questions.

453
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:26,462
The cold wave that started yesterday

454
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:29,841
is expected to continue
for three or four more days.

455
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:34,303
The cold wave, which was initially
predicted to subside from tomorrow,

456
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:37,265
is expected to continue
until this weekend,

457
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:40,184
mainly in the central region
and some southern inland regions.

458
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:41,728
-Bye.
-Good night.

459
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:43,146
-See you.
-Bye.

460
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:46,899
-I'm off. Bye.
-Bye.

461
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,165
Aren't you going home?

462
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:04,167
Go ahead. I want to monitor it a bit more.

463
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:53,174
Thanks.

464
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:58,471
Will the jet stream hold up?

465
00:34:58,554 --> 00:35:00,431
Only the current knows

466
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:02,308
whether it'll hold out or retreat.

467
00:35:02,391 --> 00:35:04,227
The forecast has been released.

468
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:06,521
So stop monitoring and go home.

469
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:09,315
I'll stay here a little longer.

470
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:19,826
-Earlier--
-I'm sorry about what happened earlier.

471
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:23,538
You were probably
just asking how he was doing,

472
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:24,997
but I overreacted.

473
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:30,253
You're right.

474
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:32,255
Whenever we talk about my father,

475
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:34,173
I act like a kid.

476
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:37,635
I try not to be like that,
but I can't help it.

477
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:40,721
It's always been that way.

478
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:43,224
My relationships started with love

479
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:45,726
but my father

480
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:48,729
was always at the end of them.

481
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:55,736
He's a difficult person to deal with,
even for me. I'm sick of him.

482
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,322
I didn't want to burden

483
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:01,826
the woman I love
by making my father her family.

484
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:06,289
Isn't being in love enough?

485
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:10,168
Is it necessary to become a family?

486
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:12,962
But the world tells you that

487
00:36:13,754 --> 00:36:16,257
you should take responsibility
for loving someone

488
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:19,135
and that the only way
to do that is through marriage.

489
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,970
So…

490
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:24,765
I told her we should break up.

491
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,750
I'm sorry.

492
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:59,091
It's okay.
You don't have to apologize to me.

493
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:01,093
I understand.

494
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:08,559
I really do. I understand.

495
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:17,568
Si-woo.

496
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:21,239
Why do you keep saying it's okay?

497
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:23,366
Why do you keep saying

498
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:25,868
that you understand me?

499
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:33,960
What will you do
if I beg you to come back?

500
00:37:36,545 --> 00:37:38,214
What will you do

501
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:40,883
if I say I can't break up with you?

502
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:52,853
I still…

503
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:56,816
like you a lot.

504
00:37:59,902 --> 00:38:01,028
Do you know that?

505
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,998
Hey! Where is Director Jin Ha-kyung?

506
00:38:12,581 --> 00:38:14,250
Hey, Director Jin!

507
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:21,424
Director Jin!

508
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:24,135
Director Jin Ha-kyung!

509
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:25,219
We'll talk later.

510
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:31,434
Hey, where's Director Jin?

511
00:38:31,517 --> 00:38:34,395
Did she go home
after messing up the forecast?

512
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:36,939
Where did Director Jin go?

513
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:38,274
I'm here, sir.

514
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:42,653
Hey, who told you
to overturn the forecast?

515
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:44,030
How dare you!

516
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:46,407
There's no sign
of the jet stream retreating

517
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:48,659
in the upper atmosphere at 10km.

518
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:49,785
Hey.

519
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:53,122
We analyze based on the forecast
of the previous team

520
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:55,666
not because we're dumb,
but because their forecast,

521
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:58,753
which they analyzed by comparing
the data values with the live situation

522
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:01,047
for 12 hours, is the most reliable source.

523
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:03,215
But you overturn the forecast
without respect to that?

524
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:05,217
It's not that I don't respect it.

525
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:07,553
I simply forecasted
based on the live situation.

526
00:39:07,636 --> 00:39:09,680
What if your forecast is wrong?

527
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:11,724
Who will deal with the consequences?

528
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:13,434
Human cost and material expenses.

529
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:15,102
Who will be responsible for those?

530
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:17,730
But unusual weather has been observed.

531
00:39:17,813 --> 00:39:19,106
Should I keep my mouth shut

532
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,275
just because of
a senior colleague's forecast?

533
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:22,401
What?

534
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:31,285
HEADQUARTERS
SHIN SEOK-HO

535
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:32,828
Hi, Assistant Director Shin.

536
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:35,456
Where are you, Senior Forecaster Um?

537
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:39,251
I think you need to
come back to the office.

538
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:41,504
Why? What's going on?

539
00:39:41,587 --> 00:39:43,297
The director of Chief Team One

540
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:45,424
is furious because
of the overturned forecast.

541
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:47,635
What did you just say?

542
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:51,055
Say that again.

543
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:52,348
Say that again!

544
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:55,518
What did you just say?

545
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:57,269
-What did you say?
-Director.

546
00:39:57,353 --> 00:39:58,854
-Stop it, guys.
-What did you say?

547
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:01,357
-Today's my daughter's birthday.
-Please calm down.

548
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,068
-Let me eat out with my family.
-Jin Ha-kyung!

549
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:07,029
-What did you just say?
-What are you doing?

550
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:09,407
-Who are you?
-You can talk to me.

551
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:12,118
Do you think I'm a joke
because you're all that?

552
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:14,787
Admit that you were wrong and apologize.

553
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:15,996
Apologize to me now!

554
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:22,128
I didn't do anything wrong, sir.

555
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:25,423
What? Jeez.

556
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:28,717
Hey, you've come a long way. How dare you?

557
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:30,511
-Please stop--
-Get off me!

558
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:33,597
I'll show you how strict
and disciplined Chief Team should be.

559
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:35,266
What did you say to me?

560
00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:36,851
-Let go of her!
-Say it again.

561
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:38,185
-Let go!
-Don't you have any respect?

562
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:40,229
-Don't you?
-I said let go of her!

563
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:02,251
SENIOR FORECASTER UM DONG-HAN

564
00:41:02,334 --> 00:41:03,377
Hello?

565
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:06,422
What was that?

566
00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:08,132
Seok-ho.

567
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:11,343
Seok-ho?

568
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:19,393
Hey, Si-woo.

569
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:30,029
I knew something like this would happen.

570
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:37,536
Yes, Director General. This is Sung-jin.

571
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:38,871
Oh, no.

572
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:49,089
Damn it.

573
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:04,355
It isn't like Dad
to reserve a place like this.

574
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:07,733
It's because you said
you wanted to eat out.

575
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,902
This is a really popular place.

576
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:12,154
I looked it up on social media.

577
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:13,697
Celebrities come here.

578
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:16,659
It's the hottest place in Cheongdam-dong.

579
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:19,119
They say it's hard to get a reservation.

580
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:22,373
Really? It's really not like your dad.

581
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:24,333
I guess he put some effort into it.

582
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:29,004
What should we get?

583
00:42:36,178 --> 00:42:37,763
BO-MI'S DAD

584
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:51,068
Hi. What is it? Where are you?

585
00:42:51,151 --> 00:42:52,361
I…

586
00:42:53,153 --> 00:42:55,072
was really on my way there.

587
00:42:55,155 --> 00:42:57,032
But I'm sorry.

588
00:42:57,116 --> 00:42:59,910
I suddenly got a call from the KMA.

589
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:02,162
-Okay. I got it.
-Hyang-rae, I…

590
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:03,747
-I'll--
-I got it. Bye.

591
00:43:12,047 --> 00:43:14,341
What's wrong?
Did Dad say he can't make it?

592
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,347
Yes. I don't know why

593
00:43:21,557 --> 00:43:23,642
he always does this on a day like this.

594
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:27,396
-What should we do?
-Let's just eat.

595
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,485
Can I order two dishes?

596
00:43:33,569 --> 00:43:35,446
When else will I get to come here?

597
00:43:45,748 --> 00:43:48,167
You're a habitual offender, aren't you?

598
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:51,378
It was a mistake, sir.

599
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:54,548
He was trying to break up a fight.
It was by accident.

600
00:43:55,424 --> 00:43:57,551
You started it first, sir.

601
00:43:57,635 --> 00:44:01,263
Forecaster Lee was only trying to
stop you. It was an accident.

602
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,932
An accident?

603
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:05,351
Forecaster Lee.

604
00:44:05,434 --> 00:44:07,811
I'm sure this wasn't
your first time hitting someone.

605
00:44:08,395 --> 00:44:11,815
I heard you punched
Han Ki-jun at the Office of Spokesperson.

606
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:13,817
Take it out on me,

607
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:15,986
not on everyone in Chief Team Two.

608
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:17,404
Hey, Ha-kyung.

609
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:19,907
Worry about the forecast
before you worry about them.

610
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:22,451
What will you do
if your forecast is wrong?

611
00:44:22,534 --> 00:44:25,871
What do you want me to do? Should I quit?

612
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:28,082
Did you say "quit"?

613
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:29,792
Sir, please calm down.

614
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:31,877
But if our forecast is right,

615
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:34,129
you better quit your job, Director Choi.

616
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:36,298
-What?
-Is this Squid Game?

617
00:44:36,382 --> 00:44:37,883
Why does anyone have to quit
if they get it wrong?

618
00:44:37,966 --> 00:44:40,761
Let's put our jobs on the line.

619
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:44,306
It'll go down in KMA history,
and make a nice lesson.

620
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:45,391
What do you say? Are you in?

621
00:44:45,474 --> 00:44:47,059
How dare you!

622
00:44:47,142 --> 00:44:48,477
Stop it!

623
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:51,063
Jeez. That's enough.

624
00:44:51,146 --> 00:44:54,024
Why are you fighting?
Did you get a nosebleed?

625
00:44:56,944 --> 00:44:58,654
What are you doing?

626
00:44:58,737 --> 00:45:03,117
You're decent people. Why are you
hitting each other and fighting?

627
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:05,369
I didn't hit him.

628
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:07,913
I hit him.

629
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:09,790
It was an accident.

630
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:11,750
It was clearly a mistake.

631
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:14,628
Three of them came at me.

632
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:18,173
Let me make myself clear.
I was only trying to stop them.

633
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:22,636
Whatever. Senior Forecaster Um.

634
00:45:22,719 --> 00:45:24,805
What did you teach your juniors?
Why are they a mess?

635
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:26,432
Weather is about flow.

636
00:45:26,515 --> 00:45:29,435
Didn't I tell you that
you can't overturn it with a few numbers?

637
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:31,937
But just because
a few ensemble predictions

638
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:33,772
came out differently,

639
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:36,233
you overturned the forecast that was based

640
00:45:36,316 --> 00:45:37,568
on a week's worth
of analysis by four teams.

641
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:38,986
What?

642
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:41,738
You've overturned my forecast before.

643
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:44,116
-Have I?
-Did he?

644
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:45,159
Twice at that.

645
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:47,744
Twice?

646
00:45:48,954 --> 00:45:50,164
When?

647
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:52,541
During the summer
heatwave warning in 2004,

648
00:45:52,624 --> 00:45:54,376
and in 2011 when the temperature
was abnormally low.

649
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:55,627
You and I were right once each.

650
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:57,754
But even when you were wrong,

651
00:45:57,838 --> 00:46:00,048
I didn't say anything about it.

652
00:46:00,132 --> 00:46:01,467
Because…

653
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:04,553
I trusted you
for having such a strong conviction.

654
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:09,725
Aren't you her senior?
Why can't you trust your junior colleague?

655
00:46:09,808 --> 00:46:13,145
Are you throwing a tantrum
because your forecast was overturned?

656
00:46:13,228 --> 00:46:17,441
It's because this brat ignored me
and lashed out at me.

657
00:46:17,524 --> 00:46:18,567
Director Choi.

658
00:46:19,401 --> 00:46:21,153
She's the director of Chief Team Two.

659
00:46:22,488 --> 00:46:24,198
She's on the same level as you.

660
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:27,743
She has as much authority
and responsibility as you do.

661
00:46:28,744 --> 00:46:30,746
You should be ashamed of yourself.

662
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:32,539
Stop being a preachy boomer.

663
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:33,999
How can you speak to her like that?

664
00:46:34,082 --> 00:46:35,501
Where are your manners?

665
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:42,799
It's because I'm angry! Is that so wrong?

666
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:45,219
Why would you get so mad over this?

667
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:47,846
I should be the one who's furious!

668
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:50,015
Today's my daughter's birthday!

669
00:46:50,098 --> 00:46:53,268
For the first time in ten years,
I was going to eat out

670
00:46:53,352 --> 00:46:55,145
with my kid and my wife.

671
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:56,563
I even did my hair

672
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:59,399
and booked a restaurant.
I was going to be a good dad today.

673
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:01,401
They must have finished eating by now!

674
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:12,204
The pressure difference
in Siberia is falling sharply.

675
00:47:18,794 --> 00:47:19,628
Ms. Lee.

676
00:47:19,711 --> 00:47:23,674
Trace the development
of the global model over time.

677
00:47:23,757 --> 00:47:24,675
Jeez.

678
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:30,430
The jet stream is moving south.

679
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:32,266
What…

680
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:35,394
Why is it moving down?

681
00:47:35,477 --> 00:47:36,645
Damn it.

682
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:43,360
What are you doing? Go home.

683
00:47:44,736 --> 00:47:46,071
Go home already.

684
00:48:19,271 --> 00:48:20,564
Doors opening.

685
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:23,817
-Hello.
-Hello.

686
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:32,075
Doors closing.

687
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:41,793
Ki-jun.

688
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:46,465
You finished late.
Did you just send the manuscript?

689
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:48,175
Yes.

690
00:48:48,675 --> 00:48:50,844
It took me longer
because I wasn't feeling well.

691
00:48:56,975 --> 00:49:00,228
You looked unwell during the briefing,
so I was worried.

692
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:03,190
Are you still sick?

693
00:49:03,857 --> 00:49:05,525
No, I'm fine.

694
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:11,865
I thought about it, Yu-jin.

695
00:49:13,742 --> 00:49:14,993
The baby…

696
00:49:17,204 --> 00:49:18,121
I welcome it.

697
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:25,379
I'm…

698
00:49:26,338 --> 00:49:28,173
not ready to be a dad,

699
00:49:30,425 --> 00:49:33,845
so I'll probably be flustered
and get confused often

700
00:49:34,429 --> 00:49:35,847
after the baby is born.

701
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:38,642
I might act like an idiot in many ways.

702
00:49:40,185 --> 00:49:42,020
But still, it's our baby,

703
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:44,815
so I want to do my best to raise it.

704
00:49:47,567 --> 00:49:49,861
-Ki-jun, I--
-But…

705
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:53,573
if you still aren't sure
about having this baby,

706
00:49:55,033 --> 00:49:56,868
I'll respect your decision.

707
00:49:58,870 --> 00:50:01,790
I can't force you
to make sacrifices alone.

708
00:50:06,128 --> 00:50:07,337
The only thing

709
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:10,590
I can say to you now is

710
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:12,843
that whatever decision you make,

711
00:50:13,593 --> 00:50:15,554
I'll be with you.

712
00:50:16,596 --> 00:50:20,142
I'll be by your side,

713
00:50:21,935 --> 00:50:23,353
so you will never be lonely.

714
00:50:33,155 --> 00:50:34,906
I'm hungry. Aren't you?

715
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:37,075
Should we grab something to eat?

716
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:54,945
You made all this?

717
00:51:55,654 --> 00:51:59,157
I made them with the ingredients I had.

718
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:00,700
It smells great.

719
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:03,870
I'm a good cook like my mother.

720
00:52:16,758 --> 00:52:18,093
Tae-kyung.

721
00:52:18,677 --> 00:52:20,720
Is there anything you can't do?

722
00:52:21,429 --> 00:52:24,015
You can draw, cook,
and you have a great personality.

723
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:26,142
Really?

724
00:52:28,436 --> 00:52:30,647
You're good at everything
except writing a story.

725
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:40,031
What about my story writing?

726
00:52:40,115 --> 00:52:42,075
Is it boring?

727
00:52:42,158 --> 00:52:44,995
No, it's not that. How should I say this?

728
00:52:45,078 --> 00:52:46,663
It's not bad.

729
00:52:46,746 --> 00:52:50,333
It just doesn't have
a hooking point that draws you in.

730
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:55,088
A hooking point?

731
00:52:55,171 --> 00:52:59,467
But you're good at
drawing cute characters.

732
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:11,771
That means my story is bad
because it has no hooking point.

733
00:53:13,148 --> 00:53:17,235
No. I don't think I said it was bad.

734
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:19,237
And my books don't sell.

735
00:53:19,821 --> 00:53:21,323
I don't think I said that.

736
00:53:21,406 --> 00:53:24,784
Isn't it implied contextually
because it has no hooking point?

737
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:34,336
Shall we have some wine?

738
00:53:34,961 --> 00:53:37,047
-Do you want some?
-No.

739
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:39,758
Let's continue our talk.

740
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:50,018
Doors opening.

741
00:53:53,855 --> 00:53:55,649
-Doors closing.
-All right.

742
00:54:03,239 --> 00:54:04,199
What?

743
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:17,420
Did she change the passcode?

744
00:54:29,432 --> 00:54:31,267
Did you change the passcode?

745
00:54:31,851 --> 00:54:35,146
Yes, I did. Because I need privacy.

746
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:38,191
Stop talking nonsense.
Give me the new passcode.

747
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:41,653
I'm sorry, Mom. You should go home.

748
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:47,909
Why didn't you tell her?

749
00:54:48,493 --> 00:54:50,078
It's cold.

750
00:54:50,912 --> 00:54:53,206
It's okay. She's tougher than you think.

751
00:55:01,172 --> 00:55:04,384
By the way, where are we going?

752
00:55:07,095 --> 00:55:08,054
To a hospital.

753
00:55:10,515 --> 00:55:12,642
She's so heartless.

754
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:16,563
I don't understand why she's so cold.

755
00:55:17,439 --> 00:55:18,565
Goodness.

756
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:22,986
What am I going to do with these?
I can't bring them back.

757
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:33,913
Tell me.

758
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:38,001
Tell me which part of the story
you don't like specifically.

759
00:55:38,084 --> 00:55:41,588
Well, it's not that I don't like it…

760
00:55:42,547 --> 00:55:44,632
Why do you keep changing your mind?

761
00:55:44,716 --> 00:55:48,428
You clearly said my story
didn't have a hooking point.

762
00:55:48,511 --> 00:55:50,472
Well, a hooking…

763
00:55:51,389 --> 00:55:54,017
You're more persistent than I thought.

764
00:55:55,435 --> 00:55:58,772
How could one be a writer
if she's not persistent?

765
00:55:58,855 --> 00:56:00,899
I spend a long time drawing, writing,

766
00:56:00,982 --> 00:56:03,818
erasing, correcting,
contemplating and creating.

767
00:56:03,902 --> 00:56:06,905
Seok-ho, have you ever stayed up all night

768
00:56:06,988 --> 00:56:08,823
trying to think of a word?

769
00:56:09,949 --> 00:56:11,910
In order to write a single line,

770
00:56:11,993 --> 00:56:14,037
I keep thinking, writing,

771
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:17,165
and rewriting all week
until my head is about to explode.

772
00:56:17,248 --> 00:56:19,042
I write and rewrite every word

773
00:56:19,125 --> 00:56:21,211
and every ending thousands of times.

774
00:56:21,294 --> 00:56:23,755
I constantly think about
how to make better sentences

775
00:56:23,838 --> 00:56:27,967
and how to express
my intentions more clearly.

776
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:29,886
I'm sorry.

777
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:32,847
I know it's easy to judge

778
00:56:32,931 --> 00:56:34,933
and talk about someone's finished work.

779
00:56:35,016 --> 00:56:37,352
But don't underestimate
the pain and effort

780
00:56:37,435 --> 00:56:39,437
that go into creating the work.

781
00:56:40,355 --> 00:56:42,273
I never did.

782
00:56:43,024 --> 00:56:44,734
I'm not a famous writer.

783
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:47,529
My books don't sell well.

784
00:56:47,612 --> 00:56:49,405
But I have my pride.

785
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:53,743
At least I have a belief
that my writings and drawings

786
00:56:53,827 --> 00:56:56,913
will have a positive and warm influence

787
00:56:56,996 --> 00:56:59,374
on the children who read them. Got it?

788
00:57:00,834 --> 00:57:02,710
Of course. I'll keep that in mind.

789
00:57:03,294 --> 00:57:04,838
Okay, that's good.

790
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:09,551
Gosh, Tae-kyung.

791
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:13,012
Tae-kyung.

792
00:57:14,848 --> 00:57:15,932
Tae-kyung.

793
00:57:16,891 --> 00:57:18,393
You can't leave like this.

794
00:57:18,977 --> 00:57:20,770
What do you want me to do then?

795
00:57:23,481 --> 00:57:24,774
I'm…

796
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:27,694
really sorry.

797
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:30,447
Please forgive me.

798
00:57:51,342 --> 00:57:52,802
Oh, my.

799
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:54,345
Goodness.

800
00:58:04,689 --> 00:58:06,649
-Oh, my goodness.
-Are you okay?

801
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:07,984
-I'm okay.
-Oh, no.

802
00:58:08,067 --> 00:58:10,028
-Are you all right?
-Gosh.

803
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:19,454
Tae-kyung.

804
00:58:20,038 --> 00:58:21,122
Yes?

805
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:30,798
What…

806
00:58:32,258 --> 00:58:35,011
-Oh, my goodness.
-What?

807
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:37,931
Why you…

808
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:39,516
Jin Tae-kyung!

809
00:58:40,058 --> 00:58:42,894
-Mom! It hurts!
-Please calm down!

810
00:58:42,977 --> 00:58:45,647
CHAYOUNG HOSPITAL

811
00:58:52,737 --> 00:58:54,072
Is someone sick?

812
00:58:55,198 --> 00:58:56,491
It's Room 309.

813
00:58:57,367 --> 00:58:59,661
The attending physician is on duty.

814
00:59:01,246 --> 00:59:02,872
So he'll tell you the details.

815
00:59:39,742 --> 00:59:42,370
LEE MYUNG-HAN

816
01:00:20,783 --> 01:00:24,078
The results from a pulmonary PET scan
and sputum test have come out.

817
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:27,290
It's cancer.

818
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:30,960
It's stage three cancer.

819
01:00:31,836 --> 01:00:33,880
If you look at the PET scan here,

820
01:00:33,963 --> 01:00:37,258
it seems that
cancer has spread considerably

821
01:00:38,259 --> 01:00:40,595
to the lymph node
and to the right of the stomach.

822
01:00:44,891 --> 01:00:47,602
He must have been in a lot of pain.

823
01:01:06,829 --> 01:01:08,039
Father.

824
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:26,849
Why are you doing this to me?

825
01:01:28,184 --> 01:01:29,519
Why?

826
01:01:32,271 --> 01:01:33,439
Why?

827
01:01:35,233 --> 01:01:36,984
Why are you doing this?

828
01:02:10,268 --> 01:02:11,394
Excuse me.

829
01:02:12,061 --> 01:02:14,480
Has Mr. Lee Myung-han
been admitted to this hospital?

830
01:02:14,564 --> 01:02:16,691
He had a car accident
the day before yesterday.

831
01:02:16,774 --> 01:02:18,151
What's the matter, sir?

832
01:02:28,828 --> 01:02:30,705
-Ki-jun.
-Yes?

833
01:02:31,456 --> 01:02:34,208
-Get up.
-Why?

834
01:02:36,335 --> 01:02:38,796
-It hurts.
-What?

835
01:02:41,549 --> 01:02:43,676
Yu-jin, what's wrong? What is it?

836
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,511
My stomach hurts so much.

837
01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:48,473
What's wrong, Yu-jin?

838
01:02:49,849 --> 01:02:50,725
What…

839
01:02:53,019 --> 01:02:56,564
The rain said to the wind…

840
01:02:58,316 --> 01:03:00,985
What's your relationship with Mr. Lee?

841
01:03:03,029 --> 01:03:04,363
I'm his guardian.

842
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:06,949
I'm from the police.

843
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:10,244
An arrest warrant
has been issued for Mr. Lee

844
01:03:10,328 --> 01:03:12,830
for self-inflicted injury and blackmail,
and insurance fraud.

845
01:03:37,146 --> 01:03:39,065
"You push."

846
01:03:40,107 --> 01:03:41,234
"And I'll…

847
01:03:42,777 --> 01:03:44,278
pour."

848
01:04:12,306 --> 01:04:13,349
You learn more

849
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:17,603
when you get things wrong
rather than when you get them right.

850
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:20,898
Do you know what
the stupidest thing in the world is?

851
01:04:21,566 --> 01:04:23,359
Breaking up out of love.

852
01:04:24,610 --> 01:04:25,903
Don't let Si-woo go.

853
01:04:25,987 --> 01:04:28,573
Not for him but for yourself.

854
01:04:30,032 --> 01:04:32,827
Because it's you, Jin Ha-kyung.

855
01:04:34,203 --> 01:04:36,914
Because it's you, Lee Si-woo.

856
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:42,044
Because I just like you.

857
01:04:42,545 --> 01:04:44,255
Because I like being with you.

858
01:04:46,382 --> 01:04:51,053
