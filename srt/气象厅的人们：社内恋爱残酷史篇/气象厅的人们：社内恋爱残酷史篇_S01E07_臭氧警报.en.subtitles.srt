A NETFLIX SERIES

2
00:00:47,964 --> 00:00:50,675
You want to live together with me?

3
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:52,218
Yes.

4
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:53,970
I want to be with you.

5
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:57,599
Move in with me.

6
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:05,982
Can I ask you…

7
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:08,193
why?

8
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:14,616
The cancellation fee for the wedding hall,
invitations, and return gifts

9
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:17,494
will be paid with the honeymoon fund.

10
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:22,165
We dated for ten years,

11
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:24,292
but I still don't know you.

12
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:29,798
I just feel empty.

13
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:33,051
Ten years is never a short time.

14
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:35,929
What was I to you?

15
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:37,847
And what were you to me?

16
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:49,400
We weren't right for each other.

17
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:54,781
I'm relieved to have
at least found out now.

18
00:01:57,325 --> 00:01:58,660
So…

19
00:01:58,743 --> 00:02:02,122
it took us ten years to realize that.

20
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:12,173
So I don't want to waste time with you.

21
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:15,969
I want to get to know you,

22
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:19,848
and I want to see
if we're right for each other.

23
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:24,269
That way I can decide whether
to continue this relationship or not.

24
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:26,396
That's why you want to live with me?

25
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:27,522
Yes.

26
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:31,860
We need to keep it a secret,
so we have to be careful at work.

27
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:33,653
Wouldn't it be more efficient

28
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:36,364
to get to know each other
if we lived together?

29
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:39,701
If that's the reason,

30
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:41,953
I don't recommend it.

31
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:46,040
What do you not recommend?

32
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:47,584
Living together.

33
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,919
Why not?

34
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:54,507
First of all, it doesn't make sense
to consider efficiency while dating.

35
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:57,802
And living together doesn't mean
you get to know each other better.

36
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:00,805
You have to make an effort to get along.

37
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:03,308
So if that's your reason,

38
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:05,602
I don't want to live with you.

39
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,563
Hey, how do you know--

40
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:11,024
I know because I've done it before.

41
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:21,242
There must be a reason.
Why do you want to break up with me?

42
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,828
-I'm tired.
-Of what?

43
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:25,163
Of living like this.

44
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:26,664
You wanted to live like this.

45
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:29,459
-That's why we started to live together.
-Right, we did.

46
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:31,920
But I don't think this is right.

47
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:34,923
If this is the extent
of the happiness we can dream of,

48
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:36,716
I can't be with you anymore.

49
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:39,469
I'm sorry.

50
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:02,492
What do you mean?

51
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:05,119
You want to push back
registering our marriage?

52
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:06,120
Why?

53
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:08,081
What for?

54
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:11,042
I'm confused.

55
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:12,752
What?

56
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:14,754
Honestly…

57
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:17,006
I thought I'd be happy if I married you.

58
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:20,218
But now I'm not sure.

59
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:22,971
We fight and get angry
with each other too often.

60
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:25,974
You aren't the person I knew
before we got married.

61
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:28,643
What was I like before?

62
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:30,270
You were mature.

63
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:33,273
You were smart, but not cocky.

64
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:35,108
You were kind and thoughtful.

65
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:37,944
Above all, you had
a strong sense of responsibility.

66
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:39,570
And?

67
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:41,614
Am I not like that anymore?

68
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:45,159
You have no plan.

69
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:51,958
Is this

70
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:54,085
because of applying
for a housing lease loan?

71
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:57,630
It is, isn't it?

72
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:02,593
Let's say

73
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:05,305
we register our marriage
and get a loan like you said.

74
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:06,681
What next?

75
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:10,935
House prices will go up
while we pay for the loan.

76
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:13,438
Then we'll have to get
another loan to lease a house.

77
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:14,939
Do we have to keep living like that?

78
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:17,775
We're still young.
What's there to worry about?

79
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:19,986
We won't be young forever.

80
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:22,447
It'll take us ten years to repay the loan.

81
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,574
Even if we win the housing lottery,

82
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:28,036
it'll take us about 20 years
to pay for it and make it ours.

83
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:30,330
By then, we'll be looking at retirement.

84
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:33,583
I don't want to work nine to six
until I'm that old.

85
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,710
That's how everyone lives, Yu-jin.

86
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:37,545
I thought we'd be different.

87
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:45,303
We had a hard time getting married,
so we have to be different.

88
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:48,056
We should be stable at least.

89
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:49,682
Why are we so insecure?

90
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:55,938
What did you think marriage was?

91
00:05:58,858 --> 00:05:59,901
I don't know.

92
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:03,154
So until I find out,

93
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:05,198
let's postpone our marriage registration.

94
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:20,338
I wanted us to be close.

95
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:24,592
I may have wanted to make up
for my failed past relationship

96
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:29,013
by being close to each other
as soon as possible.

97
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:32,308
You said you didn't want to get hurt.

98
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:35,353
I don't want to.

99
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,563
I feel the same way.

100
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:40,274
But he says that

101
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:44,403
the closer we are,
the more disappointed we'll be.

102
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:46,572
And that the wounds
we'll inflict on each other

103
00:06:47,406 --> 00:06:49,450
will be deeper and more painful.

104
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:52,120
We want to be close,

105
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:54,914
but we're afraid of getting hurt.

106
00:06:57,542 --> 00:07:01,546
What is the optimal distance between us?

107
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:06,759
EPISODE 7
OZONE WARNING

108
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:12,306
Well…

109
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,101
It's very small.

110
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:17,103
With your budget,

111
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:19,355
it's hard to find even a room like this.

112
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,525
There are people lined up
for this room too.

113
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:24,110
Can I see a few more places?

114
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:26,904
Why don't you spend
a little more on monthly rent?

115
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:30,658
Then you'll be able to find
a much better place.

116
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:35,079
Please call me
if a new room becomes available.

117
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:37,081
Sure.

118
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:38,958
Thank you.

Stay here. I'll be right back.

121
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:30,384
Did you buy mine too?

122
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:32,553
Enjoy your ice cream.

123

MOTEL

124
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:06,796
Call.

125
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:09,340
-What?
-Keep it at 50,000.

126
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:11,175
-It's too early in the game.
-Hurry up.

127
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:12,677
Okay. I got it.

128
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:15,304
-All right.
-Ready.

129
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,765
Then 50,000 more.

130
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:20,268
Two packs of cigarettes? Okay.

131
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:21,852
-Call.
-Call.

132
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:23,229
-All right.
-Okay.

133
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:24,522
-Show your hands.
-Who's the winner?

134
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:25,940
-All right.
-What do you have?

135
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:27,650
-Show it.
-Here it is.

136
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:28,818
Five!

137
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:30,820
-Your five is worthless. I have nine!
-What?

138
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:32,238
-Come on.
-No!

139
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:33,990
-Hey, I have 38!
-I got it!

140
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:35,241
-That's weird.
-Seriously.

141
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:36,367
-Why do you keep getting 38?
-Hey.

142
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,910
-Be quiet and deal.
-Okay. Let me have a drink.

143
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:40,371
-Seriously?
-Come on.

144
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:42,456
-Hurry up. What are you doing?
-Quickly.

145
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,541
Come on.

I'm sorry, but may I use your shampoo?

150
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:36,172
Thank you.

Does he think this is his house or what?

154
00:13:14,793 --> 00:13:16,003
-Hello.
-Hello.

155
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:19,673
The scorching sun proves
that it is summer indeed.

156
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:24,011
The UV index
in most areas today will be very high.

157
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:26,555
The concentration of ozone
will be high as well.

158
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,141
Don't forget to apply sunscreen thoroughly

159
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,726
-when going out.
-This is nice.

160
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:35,981
Is this one not taken?

161
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:37,983
What do you mean?

162
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:39,860
Why do you want to stay here?

163
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,779
What about you, Senior Forecaster Um?

164
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:44,073
I have my reasons.

165
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:46,116
I have my reasons too.

166
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:52,164
Gosh, this is nice.

167
00:13:58,295 --> 00:13:59,797
I'm leaving.

168
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:01,840
I'm coming.

169
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:04,260
Hurry up. I'm really busy today.

170
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,971
I have to go to the office
for training in the morning.

171
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:08,597
Plus, I have to make three visits.

172
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:09,807
Will you be home late?

173
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,642
You can have dinner alone, right?

174
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:14,228
-Rice is in the rice cooker.
-Side dishes are in the fridge.

175
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:15,688
I can just eat them.

176
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:18,148
You're all grown up.

177
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:24,947
Is that Dad's?

178
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:26,866
Why did he leave it here?

179
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:29,201
He always does as he pleases.

180
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:31,579
Why did he even come back
if he was going to leave?

181
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:40,129
Your dad doesn't like to throw things out.

182
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:43,591
He keeps all the old stuff like this,

183
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:45,009
so it's hard to tidy up.

184
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:46,844
Do it if you want to.

185
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:48,429
What?

186
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:49,805
Divorce.

187
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:51,557
What?

188
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,309
Don't worry about me.

189
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:57,229
Bo-mi.

190
00:14:58,188 --> 00:15:00,024
How can you say that?

191
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:01,317
Um Bo-mi.

192
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:06,280
Bo-mi.

193
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:09,491
KOREA METEOROLOGICAL ADMINISTRATION

194
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:13,871
-You're here early.
-Why are you coming out of there?

195
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:17,499
Well, I had to do something.

196
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:24,173
What did you do yesterday?

197
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:26,050
I had some stuff to do.

198
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:28,427
Why do you ask?

199
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:30,638
You didn't call,

200
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:32,598
so I thought something happened.

201
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,517
Did you wait for my call?

202
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:39,146
-No.
-You did.

203
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:41,148
No, I didn't.

204
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:51,367
We're at work.

205
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:54,453
You waited.

206
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:56,163
I can tell.

207
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:00,209
Forecaster Lee, you may not know this,

208
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:02,962
but I'm famous in the KMA
for my poker face.

209
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:04,213
Also…

210
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:07,299
-I'm born-to-be-impregnable.
-Who says?

211
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:08,884
Me.

212
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:11,720
Your subjective
objectification is fantastic.

213
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,431
You're being cheeky.

214
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:17,393
That's a sign of intimacy.

215
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:21,355
Why do a director and a forecaster
need to be intimate?

216
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:23,482
-Because we're a little special.
-What--

217
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:25,234
Good morning.

218
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:27,111
-Good morning!
-Hello, Assistant Director Shin.

219
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:34,368
Shall we?

220
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:39,957
Good morning.

221
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:46,630
KOREA METEOROLOGICAL ADMINISTRATION

222
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:51,719
-Doors closing.
-Wait for me. Please.

223
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:56,265
Thank you.

224
00:16:57,307 --> 00:16:58,517
Doors closing.

225
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:04,273
I saw that Assistant Director Yun took
a leave of absence.

226
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:07,776
When I was with
the Disaster Prevention Department,

227
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,319
he was my predecessor.

228
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:11,488
I see.

229
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:13,699
He isn't unwell or anything, is he?

230
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:15,159
No, he isn't.

231
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:17,536
I said he could take a break
for a year to study.

232
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:19,872
How will your family get by?

233
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:21,373
I'll continue to make a living.

234
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:23,125
Goodness.

235
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,461
Didn't your younger kid
enter grade school this year?

236
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,254
It'll be hard to make a living alone.

237
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:30,132
How can you be married
if you can't rely on each other

238
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:31,550
through tough times?

239
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:33,844
Doors opening.

240
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,141
Not getting off?

241
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:44,688
Doors closing.

242
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:53,363
Thank you.

243
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:55,365
Here you go.

244
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,247
What's going on?

245
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:03,665
Actually…

246
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:06,960
a friend of mine got married recently.

247
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,171
I see.

248
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:12,591
And?

249
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:14,426
He thought she was the one,

250
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:17,262
so he pushed ahead with the marriage
despite people telling him not to.

251
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:20,808
-And?
-They had their wedding

252
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:22,684
but they won't register the marriage.

253
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:25,646
He won't or she won't?

254
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:27,189
The wife won't.

255
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:29,316
What's going through her mind?

256
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:31,568
Well…

257
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:33,403
it's understandable.

258
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:36,115
It's understandable?

259
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:40,953
Maybe she got married on an impulse.

260
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:43,705
She may have come to her senses later

261
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:46,291
when she had to register the marriage.

262
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:49,211
I see.

263
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:53,215
Do you think she regrets getting married?

264
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:54,591
Or…

265
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,261
maybe she's scared.

266
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:02,516
The moment it becomes legal,

267
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:04,601
it feels like the game is over.

268
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:06,603
It feels like you're crossing

269
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:08,939
the point of no return.

270
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,696
I can't be sure,
but I think the wife feels insecure

271
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:18,073
about the marriage.

272
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:20,742
Have him instill some faith into her.

273
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:24,163
They say the moment you have faith,

274
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:25,956
you gain courage.

275
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:28,000
The courage that helps you

276
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:31,003
walk through even a thorny path
with your loved one.

277
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:46,602
-How is the atmosphere?
-As the upper level trough

278
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,812
slowly recedes toward the East Sea,

279
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:52,399
the anticyclone
that dominates Korea will slow down.

280
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:54,151
The solar radiation will increase.

281
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:57,196
The ozone concentration will go up too.

282
00:19:57,905 --> 00:19:59,489
By noon,

283
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:01,408
it may reach the warning stage.

284
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:05,996
Gosh, we'll be getting
a lot of calls today.

285
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:09,291
-Notify the Air Quality Forecast Center.
-Yes, ma'am.

286
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:14,504
NATIONAL METEOROLOGICAL CENTER
COMPREHENSIVE CONTROL SYSTEM

287
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:26,391
Isn't it ironic?

288
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:28,227
What? What is?

289
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,395
The ozone.

290
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,273
When it's far away in the stratosphere,

291
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,234
it's so beneficial,

292
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:38,278
but it's harmful when it's close
to the surface of the Earth.

293
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,824
Because there's always
an optimal distance for everything.

294
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:46,078
At least you can calculate
the optimal distance

295
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:47,537
between ozone and humans.

296
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:50,999
Some distances
are impossible to calculate.

297
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,918
Like what? For example?

298
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:55,420
The optimal distance between people.

299
00:20:57,547 --> 00:21:00,676
You can't know it
until you've dealt with the person.

300
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:03,762
Hedgehogs are like that.

301
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:06,348
They get pricked countless times

302
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:09,351
to find a suitable distance
to stay together.

303
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:12,813
It's a relationship

304
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:15,065
where you can only get close
by getting hurt.

305
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:16,149
Right.

306
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:21,863
There are people who haven't found
an optimal distance for over ten years.

307
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:23,282
Like me.

308
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:28,203
So did you go home?

309
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:30,038
No.

310
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:32,124
Maybe I've been away for too long.

311
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:34,084
Now I'm confused.

312
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:38,046
What's the most comfortable distance
between me and my family?

313
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,632
Sometimes I wonder

314
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:43,760
if it's best to see each other
only once in a while.

315
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:46,638
That sounds like a cowardly excuse.

316
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,265
Does it?

317
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:57,691
The chance of heavy rain
is low today, right?

318
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:02,112
Yes. Because it's less than 20 percent.

319
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:04,072
Okay. Got it.

320
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:07,951
Today's atmospheric ozone concentration

321
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:10,954
is expected to be over 0.3ppm per hour.

322
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:14,124
Please cooperate with
the Air Quality Forecast Center

323
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:16,877
when they ask you
to check solar radiation and cloud cover.

324
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,338
If you receive an outside inquiry
regarding ozone,

325
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:21,381
please respond kindly. That's all.

326
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:22,716
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

327
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:26,386
I can't do it.

328
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:27,804
During summer disaster prevention period,

329
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:30,015
responding to the media alone
is a lot of work.

330
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,350
I'm already writing monthly columns.

331
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:34,019
How can I write a feature too?

332
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:37,689
I know. So I told him it'd be difficult.

333
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:39,483
It looks like

334
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:41,276
he'll pester Reporter Chae,

335
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:42,944
your wife.

336
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:44,112
Pardon?

337
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:46,823
The editor-in-chief asked me directly

338
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:50,368
if you were Reporter Chae's husband.

339
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:56,208
Don't you get it?

340
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,920
Pardon?

341
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:01,880
A feature?

342
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:04,841
Isn't your husband KMA's spokesperson?

343
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:08,512
The one who's on TV
every time there's severe weather.

344
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:11,306
Yes.

345
00:23:11,389 --> 00:23:12,933
He's a great writer.

346
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:16,812
I read his column in the KMA monthly.
"The Two Faces of Ozone."

347
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:19,064
Your husband wrote it, right?

348
00:23:20,857 --> 00:23:21,900
Yes.

349
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:23,652
Then why don't you ask him

350
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:26,238
to write a feature article on weather?

351
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:30,075
-Okay?
-Well…

352
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:37,124
KI-JUN

353
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:44,131
KI-JUN

354
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:54,141
Hi, Ki-jun. What's up?

355
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:57,269
-Are you busy?
-Somewhat.

356
00:23:57,853 --> 00:24:00,188
What is it? Why did you call?

357
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:02,566
Do I need a reason to call you?

358
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:04,985
I just wanted to hear your voice.

359
00:24:06,444 --> 00:24:07,863
Is everything all right?

360
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:17,372
Of course. Everything's fine.

361
00:24:17,455 --> 00:24:19,040
Is it?

362
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:21,543
Okay.

363
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:24,004
Go back to work. See you at home.

364
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:26,256
Okay. Bye.

365
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,690
This is Kim Soo-jin of Chief Team.

366
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:44,900
Is this the KMA?

367
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:48,361
How can you issue
an ozone warning all of a sudden?

368
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:50,155
My kid is going on a picnic today.

369
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:53,450
So I took a day off from work
and prepared a packed lunch.

370
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:55,869
You should have issued it a day before.

371
00:24:55,952 --> 00:24:58,914
Ozone increases suddenly
due to exhaust emissions

372
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:00,957
or harmful substances in the air.

373
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:03,168
So a warning can only
be issued in real-time.

374
00:25:03,251 --> 00:25:06,546
For your information, ozone warnings
aren't issued by the KMA.

375
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,381
Stop kidding me. Hey!

376
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:11,384
The weather is perfectly fine.
What's with the ozone warning?

377
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:13,511
They won't let trucks and vans

378
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:15,764
enter the metropolitan area because of it.

379
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:17,515
You better make it up for us!

380
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:21,144
Excuse me, sir. Please calm down.

381
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:24,105
Contact the Ministry of Environment
or the Road Traffic Authority

382
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:27,067
because ozone warnings
aren't issued by the KMA.

383
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:29,319
Isn't ozone a good thing?

384
00:25:29,402 --> 00:25:31,112
I heard it was good to have it.

385
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:33,448
That's when it's in the stratosphere.

386
00:25:33,531 --> 00:25:36,493
If the amount of ozone
in the atmosphere increases, it's harmful.

387
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:39,079
Oh, I see.

388
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:42,791
By the way, how old are you?

389
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:44,376
Are you married?

390
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:46,670
I'm hanging up.

391
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:57,138
I'll answer it. Go and have lunch.

392
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:59,057
No, I'll take the call.

393
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,475
You should eat first.

394
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:02,477
I don't have an appetite.

395
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:06,398
Yes, this is Kim Soo-jin of Chief Team.

396
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:09,567
Yes.

397
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:11,778
Ozone warnings aren't issued by the KMA.

398
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:13,822
Hello, sir.

399
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:15,323
-Hi.
-Hello.

400
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:16,408
Hi.

401
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:18,118
Where is Director Jin?

402
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:21,162
She went to the Policy Division
for post-analysis.

403
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:22,205
I see.

404
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:25,375
-Go back to work.
-Okay.

405
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:28,044
Get back to work.

406
00:26:29,462 --> 00:26:31,047
-Senior Forecaster Um.
-Yes, sir.

407
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:34,092
Let's grab some coffee. Come.

408
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:44,602
Sir.

409
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:46,521
Please don't yell at me.

410
00:26:46,604 --> 00:26:49,190
What? Yell?

411
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:51,526
Who's yelling at you?

412
00:26:51,609 --> 00:26:52,694
You are.

413
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:54,821
You've been yelling at me all this time.

414
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:57,574
What? Hey.

415
00:26:57,657 --> 00:27:00,702
Do you want to get fired?
Do you want to submit a written apology?

416
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:03,621
How dare you talk back to me?

417
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:06,958
Hey, my son is a high-ranking official.

418
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:09,753
I can make him sack you right now.

419
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:10,670
Do you understand?

420
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:12,714
Listen, sir.

421
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:14,883
Why don't you complain directly

422
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:16,801
to your high-ranking official son?

423
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:18,511
Don't call us.

424
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:23,016
How many times do I have to tell you
that ozone warnings are issued

425
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:26,019
by the Ministry of Environment
and not the KMA?

426
00:27:26,102 --> 00:27:29,522
Call them and swear at them, okay?

427
00:27:41,534 --> 00:27:42,911
Can we do that?

428
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:44,329
Of course not.

429
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:45,747
But…

430
00:27:47,123 --> 00:27:48,416
we're people too.

431
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:52,837
We have the right to defend ourselves
from rude people like that.

432
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:54,422
Still…

433
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:56,674
It's okay.

434
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:58,968
Don't worry, Ms. Kim.

435
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:00,512
I'll handle the consequences.

436
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:26,830
Forecaster Lee, where are you going?

437
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:29,749
I have something to do.

438
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:31,376
Bye.

439
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:40,844
Pardon?

440
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:42,971
The rent is 600,000 won?

441
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:45,890
Maintenance fee is extra?

442
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:49,060
Well…

443
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:53,648
How about 500,000 a month
including the maintenance fee?

444
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,191
I told you no.

445
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:57,861
The room you saw yesterday
is what you can get with that.

446
00:28:57,944 --> 00:29:01,322
Could you please talk
to the landlord one more time?

447
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:03,491
I'll keep the room clean,

448
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:05,952
and I'm only going to sleep there.

449
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:08,538
I know the landlord won't say yes.

450
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:11,666
Please ask just one more time, ma'am.

451
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:12,834
Thank you.

452
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:25,722
Why do you act like
a widower at Headquarters?

453
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:28,266
I'm not a widower.

454
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:30,643
I have a wife and a daughter.

455
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:32,562
Exactly.

456
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:34,731
You have a home and a family.

457
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:37,317
Why have you been sleeping here for days?

458
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:40,111
Because it's an extreme weather period.

459
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:43,531
I used to live in the KMA
during summer disaster prevention period.

460
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,658
Why are you nagging at me?

461
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:48,828
That's because we didn't have
the central server back then.

462
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:54,042
Now we can monitor the conditions
in China and Japan live at home.

463
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:55,877
Anyway…

464
00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:59,839
kids these days don't like you doing this.

465
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:02,050
Who are these kids you're talking about?

466
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:05,136
A lot of people use the night-duty room.

467
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,640
I've been getting so many complaints

468
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:11,851
because you made
the night-duty room your home.

469
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:14,771
Jeez.

470
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,148
Pack up and go home.

471
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:21,569
Isn't that why you came here
despite the lower position?

472
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:23,530
Why did you come here then?

473
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:26,366
You should have just stayed
in Gangneung and bossed everyone around.

474
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:29,994
People in Seoul are so unkind.

475
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:32,956
Does your wife know
that you're living like a bum?

476
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:36,668
She told me to do as I please.

477
00:30:41,297 --> 00:30:42,423
Okay. Do as you please.

478
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:47,512
What's the point of being able
to smell the east wind

479
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:50,431
when you can't even read your wife's mind?

480
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:51,933
Throw this out.

481
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:58,898
Well…

482
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:20,086
Who handled the complaint calls
that came to the Chief Team today?

483
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:22,046
I did.

484
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:24,757
What's going on?

485
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:27,302
The Forecast Bureau received a warning.

486
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:31,681
Did you tell someone not to call the KMA

487
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:34,350
because the ozone warning
wasn't under our jurisdiction?

488
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:39,022
I know it's difficult
to deal with complaint calls,

489
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:41,232
but you can't yell at them and hang up.

490
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:45,403
Did you do that, Ms. Kim?

491
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:49,240
It was me.

492
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:52,827
You shouldn't cover up for her.

493
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:54,287
I'm not covering up for her.

494
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:55,914
I'm the one who took the call.

495
00:31:57,498 --> 00:31:58,583
Look.

496
00:31:58,666 --> 00:32:01,169
This is what happens
when you don't do your job right.

497
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:03,630
Why does a senior member
have to cover up for you?

498
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:07,091
I said I took the call,
Deputy Director Han.

499
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:09,677
I took the call. I yelled at him,

500
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:11,721
and I hung up on him. Okay?

501
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:16,893
You should have been patient with him.

502
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:18,144
How could I?

503
00:32:18,227 --> 00:32:19,854
He said he'd get us all fired.

504
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:21,356
I couldn't stand it.

505
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:24,484
That wasn't a complaint. It was a threat.

506
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:27,570
We aren't their emotional trash can.

507
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:30,198
Why do we have to listen to that garbage?

508
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:34,202
All right.

509
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:38,289
In any case,
please do your job right, Ms. Kim.

510
00:32:39,832 --> 00:32:42,919
Why did you have
Assistant Director Oh take the call?

511
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:45,755
This is all because you didn't
do your job properly.

512
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:46,839
Am I wrong?

513
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:48,633
Excuse me, Deputy Director Han.

514
00:32:48,716 --> 00:32:50,301
He crossed the line.

515
00:32:52,553 --> 00:32:54,138
As soon as I picked up the phone,

516
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:56,724
he asked me if I knew who his son was.

517
00:32:57,433 --> 00:32:58,851
Do you know what else?

518
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:00,520
He talked down to me,

519
00:33:00,603 --> 00:33:02,772
and asked me how old I was
and if I was married.

520
00:33:02,855 --> 00:33:04,774
He said I was a rude cow.

521
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:12,115
You know,

522
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:15,159
I came to the KMA to forecast the weather.

523
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:17,161
I didn't struggle to pass
the civil service exam

524
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:19,330
to handle trivial calls like that.

525
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,796
Don't cry…

526
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:29,549
I'll submit an answer
to the Audit and Inspection Division

527
00:33:29,632 --> 00:33:31,175
according to the procedure.

528
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:32,260
You can go now.

529
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:34,429
Yes. Okay.

530
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:35,972
Let's do that.

531
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,198
Ms. Kim.

532
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:55,742
Yes.

533
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:58,995
We are here to do that kind of work.

534
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:05,168
What do you mean, Director Jin?

535
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:09,380
Listening to the complaints

536
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:11,340
is uncomfortable.

537
00:34:12,341 --> 00:34:14,969
But did you know

538
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:17,472
that there are so many people

539
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:19,390
affected by an ozone warning?

540
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:26,856
Truck drivers whose livelihoods are
at stake, kids who can't go out to play,

541
00:34:26,939 --> 00:34:29,400
and those who don't even know
what an ozone warning is.

542
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:33,654
If we didn't receive complaint calls,

543
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:36,157
would we have known…

544
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:39,660
how our weather forecasts

545
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:42,914
would affect whom, when,
and to what extent?

546
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:50,338
The reason why we're here after
passing the difficult civil service exam

547
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:53,382
is to serve the people and the citizens.

548
00:34:54,926 --> 00:35:00,515
So there isn't any work
that's trivial to us like you said.

549
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:01,808
Do you understand?

550
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:16,739
Are you okay?

551
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:20,576
It's all right.

552
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:33,631
I didn't struggle
to pass the civil service exam

553
00:35:33,714 --> 00:35:36,008
to take nasty complaint calls.

554
00:35:36,884 --> 00:35:39,512
Why do I have to
put up with people like these?

555
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:45,893
Then what do you think we're here for?

556
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:50,648
We're here to serve
the citizens, the people.

557
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:53,818
Take responsibility
and do your best at work.

558
00:35:53,901 --> 00:35:55,486
That's why the taxpayers pay us.

559
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:58,197
Do you think this is just
a secure source of income?

560
00:35:58,281 --> 00:35:59,407
It isn't.

561
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:01,617
Look for another job
if that's what you want.

562
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:04,328
Without a sense of responsibility or duty,

563
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:06,038
you can never work here.

564
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:07,081
Got it?

565
00:36:21,053 --> 00:36:22,221
She's come a long way.

566
00:36:25,641 --> 00:36:26,726
Cheer up.

567
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:28,477
You got scolded because of me.

568
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:30,229
I'm so sorry.

569
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:33,024
I don't consider it a scolding.

570
00:36:33,816 --> 00:36:35,067
Actually…

571
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:36,694
it made me come to my senses.

572
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:41,490
I've been answering
complaint calls all day,

573
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:44,368
and that made me question
what I was doing here.

574
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:47,121
But after listening to Director Jin,

575
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:48,664
it became clear to me.

576
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:50,249
Did it?

577
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:53,085
You're all grown up, Soo-jin.

578
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:55,963
That's how you make progress.

579
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:57,965
Ha-kyung wasn't born like that.

580
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:02,303
Anyway, bye.

581
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:03,930
-See you tomorrow.
-Goodbye.

582
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:05,431
-Take care.
-Bye.

583
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:12,021
Is he going to sleep
in the night-duty room again?

584
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:14,065
He's been away for too long.

585
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:16,525
Being home could be uncomfortable for him.

586
00:37:17,109 --> 00:37:18,486
Doors opening.

587
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:19,654
Hello.

588
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:20,988
-Hello.
-Hello.

589
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:24,242
Aren't you coming?

590
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:26,369
You go first. I'll take the next one.

591
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:28,913
-See you tomorrow, Forecaster Lee.
-Bye.

592
00:37:28,996 --> 00:37:30,289
Doors closing.

593
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:33,292
Doors opening.

594
00:37:36,295 --> 00:37:38,130
You can go first.

595
00:37:41,717 --> 00:37:43,052
Doors closing.

596
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:55,940
Doors opening.

597
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:01,737
You can go first.

598
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:03,281
-Doors closing.
-Bye.

599
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,570
What are you doing here?

600
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:45,364
The elevator was full.
I was waiting for the next one.

601
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:50,369
I'm hungry. Do you want to grab dinner?

602
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:54,165
Frozen pork belly?

603
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:55,333
Sure.

604
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:57,460
CHILDREN'S BOOKS
BEST SELLERS AND NEW RELEASES

605
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:14,185
Is this the one you're looking for?

606
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:15,353
Yes, it is.

607
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,313
Where was it?

608
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:18,731
I couldn't find it.

609
00:39:18,814 --> 00:39:21,233
It was in the storage.

610
00:39:22,568 --> 00:39:23,694
In the storage?

611
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:26,405
You can pay for it over there.

612
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:27,490
Okay.

613
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:33,579
CITY CROCODILE
BY JIN TAE-KYUNG

614
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:20,835
-Would you like to see it?
-No. Go ahead.

615
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:27,633
Aren't you…

616
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:33,222
You recognized me.

617
00:40:34,473 --> 00:40:36,809
Yes, I'm the…

618
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:39,311
The side dishes, right?

619
00:40:40,312 --> 00:40:41,313
The side dishes?

620
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:44,024
You left your side dishes with me,

621
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:45,484
apartment number 1201.

622
00:40:47,319 --> 00:40:48,946
Apartment number 1302?

623
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:54,910
I told her about the side dishes ages ago.

624
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,040
Why won't she pick up?

625
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:09,842
Please tell your sister

626
00:41:09,925 --> 00:41:12,928
to pick it up by tomorrow
or I'll throw them all out.

627
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:15,181
Wait.

628
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:17,600
You can't just leave.

629
00:41:18,934 --> 00:41:19,977
Why not?

630
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:23,481
The book you were reading, City Crocodile.

631
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:28,486
Please tell me which part made you laugh.

632
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:29,612
Oh.

633
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:33,199
I didn't laugh because it was funny.

634
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:34,492
Why did you laugh then?

635
00:41:35,409 --> 00:41:37,453
Crocodiles have no choice

636
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:39,872
but to become handbags
to come to the city.

637
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:44,585
Crocodiles are reptiles
that live in the water,

638
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:46,212
so they can't live in the city.

639
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:48,297
But it's titled City Crocodile.

640
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:52,051
Can't that be considered artistic license?

641
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:55,054
I bet

642
00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:56,847
the author of that book

643
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:59,099
has never even googled crocodiles

644
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:01,727
let alone done any research on them.

645
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:02,937
I'm sure she has.

646
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,355
If so, she should know that

647
00:42:04,438 --> 00:42:07,399
a crocodile's front toes
and hind toes are different.

648
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:09,693
Hind toes?

649
00:42:10,277 --> 00:42:13,781
Crocodile's forefeet have five toes

650
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:15,908
and the hind feet have four.

651
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:18,577
But that book…

652
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:20,287
Jeez.

653
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:24,792
I know anyone can become
a writer these days,

654
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:27,878
but this one has no basics down.

655
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:29,922
I laughed because it was pathetic.

656
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:34,176
I'm sorry I don't have the basics down.

657
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,302
What?

658
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:42,476
Hold on. Are you the…

659
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:03,247
-This one's ready.
-Thanks.

660
00:43:22,474 --> 00:43:23,434
Who was it?

661
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:25,644
It's nothing.

662
00:43:26,812 --> 00:43:28,063
Is it good?

663
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:38,741
Was I too forward?

664
00:43:38,824 --> 00:43:39,867
About what?

665
00:43:42,661 --> 00:43:46,373
Was it too much
to ask you to live with me?

666
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:50,586
No. I was happy
because you were honest with me.

667
00:43:50,669 --> 00:43:53,464
So I was able to tell you
how I felt candidly.

668
00:43:55,716 --> 00:43:59,678
Ever since we talked about that,
you've been awkward.

669
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:02,598
I feel like you're keeping
a distance from me.

670
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:07,144
I thought you wanted that distance.

671
00:44:07,227 --> 00:44:08,687
You wanted this to be a secret.

672
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:11,607
I don't want any secrets
between us though.

673
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:15,110
Is it because

674
00:44:15,694 --> 00:44:17,529
I didn't tell you who texted me?

675
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:21,033
That too.

676
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:29,583
Here.

677
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:33,754
Realtor?

678
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:35,673
Yes, it's the realtor.

679
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:36,924
There's a room available.

680
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:38,592
Why the realtor?

681
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:40,678
I can't stay
at the training center forever.

682
00:44:42,971 --> 00:44:45,683
I knew it was hard
to find a room in Seoul,

683
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:47,518
but it's harder than I thought.

684
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:51,146
I went around all day yesterday,
but I couldn't find one.

685
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:56,110
Is that why you said
you had stuff to do yesterday?

686
00:44:56,193 --> 00:44:57,194
Yes.

687
00:44:59,321 --> 00:45:02,074
Si-woo, I'm really curious.

688
00:45:02,157 --> 00:45:05,119
Why would you refuse to live with me

689
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:07,329
and look for a room to rent?

690
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:09,581
It's because

691
00:45:10,332 --> 00:45:13,794
I want to keep my relationship
separate from my living conditions.

692
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:20,634
It isn't because of your pride, is it?

693
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:26,849
If this is how you react,
I can't be honest with you.

694
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:31,228
I'm not proud of my current situation,

695
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:34,314
but I'm not ashamed of it either.

696
00:45:39,111 --> 00:45:41,029
Why are you looking at me like that?

697
00:45:42,114 --> 00:45:43,115
It's nothing.

698
00:45:49,872 --> 00:45:51,957
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

699
00:45:53,375 --> 00:45:55,294
Can I have a bottle of soju, please?

700
00:45:55,377 --> 00:45:56,462
Sure.

701
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:25,866
-What are you up to?
-Seriously?

702
00:46:32,414 --> 00:46:33,332
Unbelievable.

703
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:36,793
Damn it.

704
00:46:47,596 --> 00:46:48,889
What's all this?

705
00:46:50,516 --> 00:46:52,809
You didn't have dinner yet, right? Sit.

706
00:47:00,609 --> 00:47:01,818
Thanks.

707
00:47:02,569 --> 00:47:03,570
Sure.

708
00:47:20,712 --> 00:47:21,588
What's this?

709
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:23,423
CREDIT LOANS
FOR FULL-TIME CIVIL SERVANTS

710
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:25,884
Our key money deposit
can be settled with that.

711
00:47:25,968 --> 00:47:28,011
It's still a loan,

712
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:30,597
but the interest rate is lower
than the one for newlyweds.

713
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:32,099
So it's much better.

714
00:47:42,067 --> 00:47:45,237
I heard your editor-in-chief
wanted me to write a feature.

715
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:46,488
How did you know?

716
00:47:47,155 --> 00:47:50,075
Why didn't you tell me about it?

717
00:47:51,159 --> 00:47:52,828
I know you're busy,

718
00:47:53,453 --> 00:47:56,582
so I didn't want to bother you
with more work.

719
00:47:57,708 --> 00:47:59,960
Tell him that I'll do it.

720
00:48:01,336 --> 00:48:02,170
Really?

721
00:48:02,254 --> 00:48:03,088
Yes.

722
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:05,841
If I don't do it,

723
00:48:05,924 --> 00:48:07,926
your editor will harass you, won't he?

724
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:10,178
They'll talk behind your back too.

725
00:48:10,929 --> 00:48:12,472
Will you have time for it?

726
00:48:13,181 --> 00:48:15,267
I'll make time to do it.

727
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:17,060
Because it's for my wife.

728
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:20,480
I'll tell him tomorrow that you'll do it.

729
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:22,441
Go ahead. Tell him.

730
00:48:27,904 --> 00:48:29,573
How did you find out about this?

731
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:32,159
You're really amazing.

732
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:37,080
Have him instill some faith into her.

733
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:39,750
They say the moment you have faith,

734
00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:41,543
you gain courage.

735
00:48:41,627 --> 00:48:43,587
The courage that helps you

736
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:46,381
walk through even a thorny path
with your loved one.

737
00:48:54,848 --> 00:48:56,933
-Did you finish your homework?
-Yes.

738
00:48:58,143 --> 00:49:01,188
Let's look at exponent additions today.

739
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:03,982
-Solve this one and this one first.
-Okay.

740
00:49:14,868 --> 00:49:18,580
What did you mean
by what you said earlier?

741
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:19,665
What?

742
00:49:19,748 --> 00:49:22,000
You said I could divorce your dad.

743
00:49:22,084 --> 00:49:23,627
Why did you say that?

744
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:25,253
Just because.

745
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:29,549
You look more tired now than before.

746
00:49:30,342 --> 00:49:32,427
You don't have to live with him for me.

747
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:35,055
I'd like to live with Dad too,

748
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:36,890
but I prefer you to be happy.

749
00:49:38,433 --> 00:49:41,019
I don't hate living with your dad.

750
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:45,023
Well, it's just that

751
00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:48,360
your dad and I need some time.

752
00:49:48,443 --> 00:49:51,488
Because we've been apart for a long time,

753
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:54,991
we need time
to be close to each other again.

754
00:50:06,461 --> 00:50:08,296
Ma'am, I'm done.

755
00:50:09,923 --> 00:50:11,049
Ma'am?

756
00:50:11,133 --> 00:50:13,009
-Yes?
-Can you take a look at this?

757
00:50:13,802 --> 00:50:15,887
Yes. Let's see.

758
00:50:38,243 --> 00:50:39,494
Goodness.

759
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:47,294
Well…

760
00:50:55,343 --> 00:50:56,803
FRIED CHICKEN

761
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:02,392
-Here you go.
-Yes.

762
00:51:04,352 --> 00:51:06,313
Did you already have a drink?

763
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:09,775
Yes, I had a drink with my girlfriend.

764
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:14,529
Why did you come here
instead of going to her place?

765
00:51:15,822 --> 00:51:16,907
Just because.

766
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:20,243
Actually, I was a little embarrassed.

767
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:21,870
Why?

768
00:51:21,953 --> 00:51:23,497
Because…

769
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:25,707
I don't have a penny to my name.

770
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:27,459
So…

771
00:51:27,542 --> 00:51:31,213
I held on to my pride
and barely survived until now.

772
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:34,549
But my cover was blown today.

773
00:51:43,725 --> 00:51:44,935
To tell the truth…

774
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:49,731
after my dad passed away,

775
00:51:51,733 --> 00:51:54,736
my family was kicked out of our house.

776
00:51:57,656 --> 00:51:59,866
My mom, my sister, and I

777
00:52:00,826 --> 00:52:03,703
suddenly had no place to go.

778
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:07,749
I was hungry and the night was cold.

779
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:10,710
I didn't want to stay out all night,

780
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:15,507
so I wanted to knock on every door
and ask people to let me in.

781
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:18,718
So what did you do that night?

782
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:22,264
We slept on the street.

783
00:52:24,516 --> 00:52:27,477
The next day,
my sister was sent to my uncle's,

784
00:52:28,436 --> 00:52:30,897
and I went to my aunt's house.

785
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:32,107
My mom…

786
00:52:33,191 --> 00:52:34,734
worked at a restaurant.

787
00:52:35,485 --> 00:52:37,612
So we lived apart for a few years.

788
00:52:40,907 --> 00:52:44,744
That's why I know
what it's like to have no home.

789
00:52:45,328 --> 00:52:48,123
And how weary you are.

790
00:52:50,625 --> 00:52:53,712
I respect your desire to separate
your relationship from your private life.

791
00:52:56,548 --> 00:53:00,260
I also understand
that you want to protect your pride.

792
00:53:01,678 --> 00:53:03,388
But you know…

793
00:53:05,765 --> 00:53:08,435
there's no need to go out of your way
to pretend you're okay.

794
00:53:13,189 --> 00:53:14,608
Do you know what I mean?

795
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:23,825
So she called your bluff.
That's embarrassing.

796
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:27,829
Well, yes. She did.

797
00:53:27,913 --> 00:53:29,247
But now

798
00:53:30,165 --> 00:53:32,208
I feel at ease.

799
00:53:34,669 --> 00:53:36,588
Because at least

800
00:53:36,671 --> 00:53:39,925
I don't have to pretend
to be okay in front of her.

801
00:53:41,843 --> 00:53:45,805
Even if I get closer to her,
I don't think it'll hurt.

802
00:53:48,183 --> 00:53:49,225
Right.

803
00:53:49,309 --> 00:53:51,853
That's how you adjust
the distance between each other.

804
00:53:54,356 --> 00:53:57,317
"The distance between each other."

805
00:54:01,112 --> 00:54:02,989
Gosh, I'm full.

806
00:54:04,741 --> 00:54:06,743
Let's stop babbling and call it a night.

807
00:54:08,453 --> 00:54:09,287
Pardon?

808
00:54:10,163 --> 00:54:12,582
Aren't you going to sleep?
We have work tomorrow.

809
00:54:14,292 --> 00:54:16,127
May I sleep here?

810
00:54:16,211 --> 00:54:18,046
I have no right to tell you yes or no.

811
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:20,674
You know what? I snore.

812
00:54:20,757 --> 00:54:23,426
That's no problem at all.

813
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:24,761
Okay.

814
00:54:38,984 --> 00:54:40,068
Damn it.

815
00:54:43,071 --> 00:54:50,078
INNOVATIVE WEATHER SERVICES
A STEPPING STONE TO PUBLIC SAFETY

816
00:55:19,482 --> 00:55:23,028
I submitted the report regarding Ms. Kim
to the Audit Division yesterday.

817
00:55:23,111 --> 00:55:24,237
Right.

818
00:55:25,822 --> 00:55:26,948
This is for you.

819
00:55:28,408 --> 00:55:29,242
What's it for?

820
00:55:34,539 --> 00:55:37,751
Well, do you know
the editor-in-chief of Munmin Daily?

821
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:41,212
I guess he liked my column,

822
00:55:41,296 --> 00:55:44,049
so he asked me
to write a feature in his paper.

823
00:55:44,132 --> 00:55:45,633
Regarding weather.

824
00:55:46,968 --> 00:55:47,886
And?

825
00:55:48,595 --> 00:55:51,306
I was wondering if you had time.

826
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:54,559
Didn't I tell you it was the last time?

827
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:56,603
Please help me just one more time.

828
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:58,313
I already told him I'd do it.

829
00:55:58,897 --> 00:56:00,148
So what?

830
00:56:00,231 --> 00:56:02,942
Just read through it once.

831
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:04,319
It'll be the last time.

832
00:56:04,402 --> 00:56:06,154
Please help me this one last time.

833
00:56:06,237 --> 00:56:07,614
Hey.

834
00:56:07,697 --> 00:56:09,908
Does your wife know about this?

835
00:56:09,991 --> 00:56:12,410
Come on. How could I tell her?

836
00:56:12,494 --> 00:56:14,079
No, because it's embarrassing.

837
00:56:14,162 --> 00:56:15,580
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

838
00:56:16,372 --> 00:56:17,415
Ha-kyung.

839
00:56:18,458 --> 00:56:19,667
We're friends.

840
00:56:20,418 --> 00:56:21,419
"Friends"?

841
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:23,046
We were together for ten years.

842
00:56:23,129 --> 00:56:24,380
Our relationship failed,

843
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:25,840
but aren't we still friends?

844
00:56:25,924 --> 00:56:27,592
We were together since college.

845
00:56:27,675 --> 00:56:29,302
Except for our relationship,

846
00:56:29,385 --> 00:56:30,929
I still have fond memories of us.

847
00:56:31,012 --> 00:56:33,181
-Don't you?
-No, I don't.

848
00:56:33,264 --> 00:56:35,183
I forgot the time I spent with you.

849
00:56:35,266 --> 00:56:36,893
It's gone from my memory.

850
00:56:37,477 --> 00:56:38,311
Ha-kyung.

851
00:56:38,895 --> 00:56:40,563
If you ask me for another favor,

852
00:56:40,647 --> 00:56:42,315
I'll tell your wife.

853
00:56:45,485 --> 00:56:47,946
Ha-kyung, how could you do this to me?

854
00:56:48,029 --> 00:56:49,364
Ha-kyung!

855
00:56:50,156 --> 00:56:51,574
Director Jin!

856
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:55,286
What should I do?

857
00:56:55,787 --> 00:56:57,455
Oh, no…

858
00:56:58,706 --> 00:56:59,916
Darn it.

859
00:57:04,963 --> 00:57:07,006
Good morning. Good work last night.

860
00:57:07,632 --> 00:57:09,509
Director Jin, you're always energetic.

861
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:10,927
Thank you.

862
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:13,596
Don't just look after yourself.

863
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:15,473
Look after your team too.

864
00:57:16,182 --> 00:57:17,517
My team?

865
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:20,645
Haven't you heard that they're living
in the night-duty room?

866
00:57:20,728 --> 00:57:22,647
You're talking about Senior Forecaster Um.

867
00:57:22,730 --> 00:57:25,859
Please be understanding.
He has his reasons.

868
00:57:25,942 --> 00:57:27,861
Does your team own the night-duty room?

869
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:30,572
If two of your
team members claim the beds,

870
00:57:30,655 --> 00:57:32,740
where will the night shifters sleep?

871
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:37,287
Did you just say two of them?

872
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:44,210
It's your job to manage your team.

873
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:47,922
Director Choi wouldn't have
let his team members be that way.

874
00:57:49,674 --> 00:57:51,092
Lee Si-woo--

875
00:58:02,729 --> 00:58:04,898
Why on earth are you two doing this?

876
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:07,400
You can go to a motel

877
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:09,277
or a sauna.

878
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:13,323
But I only need a few hours of sleep
before going to work.

879
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:16,659
It's too hot to sleep at a…

880
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:22,665
Why are you here?

881
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:24,834
Didn't you say
you'd stay at the training center?

882
00:58:25,835 --> 00:58:27,170
Well…

883
00:58:27,253 --> 00:58:28,922
He got kicked out.

884
00:58:29,005 --> 00:58:30,215
It's been a few days.

885
00:58:31,716 --> 00:58:32,759
It's been a few days?

886
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:36,095
Have you been living
in the night-duty room all this time?

887
00:58:36,679 --> 00:58:37,555
No.

888
00:58:37,639 --> 00:58:39,516
He's been there for two nights.

889
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:40,850
He slept in his car before that.

890
00:58:42,393 --> 00:58:44,270
Why would you tell her that?

891
00:58:47,732 --> 00:58:49,150
Unbelievable.

892
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:52,946
Anyway, we're really okay.

893
00:58:53,446 --> 00:58:55,949
We'll take care of ourselves,
so just ignore us.

894
00:58:56,032 --> 00:58:58,493
How could I ignore you?

895
00:58:58,576 --> 00:59:01,371
Everyone is complaining
to me about you two.

896
00:59:01,996 --> 00:59:03,706
They should talk to us.

897
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:04,832
What did they say?

898
00:59:04,916 --> 00:59:06,751
"Manage your team properly."

899
00:59:06,834 --> 00:59:09,295
"How long will you leave them unattended?"

900
00:59:10,588 --> 00:59:11,756
I see.

901
00:59:22,433 --> 00:59:23,768
What should I do?

902
00:59:24,978 --> 00:59:27,063
Hey, Ki-jun.

903
00:59:28,648 --> 00:59:30,984
I heard you agreed
to write for Munmin Daily.

904
00:59:32,193 --> 00:59:34,320
Well, yes.

905
00:59:34,404 --> 00:59:36,114
I did.

906
00:59:36,781 --> 00:59:39,742
I guess your wife talked you into it.

907
00:59:40,618 --> 00:59:43,913
You told me you couldn't do it yesterday.

908
00:59:44,455 --> 00:59:46,874
But you said yes to your wife right away.

909
00:59:46,958 --> 00:59:50,336
Well, that's not exactly how it happened.

910
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:53,715
You're so devoted to your wife.
I hope you do a great job.

911
00:59:54,215 --> 00:59:55,758
-Good luck.
-Thank you.

912
00:59:57,552 --> 00:59:58,553
You're amazing.

913
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:02,432
-Good luck.
-You're the best.

914
01:00:02,515 --> 01:00:04,767
Let's do it!

915
01:00:11,399 --> 01:00:12,567
What should I do?

916
01:00:28,916 --> 01:00:30,835
Do I have to do this?

917
01:00:33,463 --> 01:00:35,590
Yes, I have to.

918
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:38,092
Yes. I'll do it.

919
01:00:39,802 --> 01:00:41,554
Reporter Chae's writing improved

920
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:43,473
after she got married.

921
01:00:44,682 --> 01:00:46,893
The title hits the point.

922
01:00:47,393 --> 01:00:49,812
Her husband works at the KMA.

923
01:00:50,605 --> 01:00:51,773
Rumor has it that

924
01:00:52,357 --> 01:00:55,234
she lived with someone from the KMA.

925
01:00:55,902 --> 01:00:59,197
Did she end up marrying that guy?

926
01:01:00,448 --> 01:01:02,200
I guess so.

927
01:01:04,369 --> 01:01:06,329
I heard her husband can write.

928
01:01:07,789 --> 01:01:11,376
-I see.
-Reporter Chae has everything.

929
01:01:11,459 --> 01:01:13,544
Living with someone
and getting married to him.

930
01:01:21,177 --> 01:01:26,432
INNOVATIVE WEATHER SERVICES
A STEPPING STONE TO PUBLIC SAFETY

931
01:01:29,102 --> 01:01:30,978
Forecaster Lee has no place to go,

932
01:01:31,062 --> 01:01:33,356
but Senior Forecaster Um
can go back to his house.

933
01:01:33,439 --> 01:01:34,774
Right.

934
01:01:34,857 --> 01:01:36,359
I can't let him stay at my place.

935
01:01:36,442 --> 01:01:38,236
Because you have two kids.

936
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:39,904
Now I have three.

937
01:01:39,987 --> 01:01:41,698
My husband took a leave of absence.

938
01:01:41,781 --> 01:01:42,740
I see.

939
01:01:42,824 --> 01:01:43,991
Why don't you take him in?

940
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:46,035
I'll get going now.

941
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:50,415
Not a chance.

942
01:01:51,082 --> 01:01:53,501
He has mysophobia, so he'll never say yes.

943
01:01:53,584 --> 01:01:57,422
I feel bad about Director Jin.

944
01:01:58,506 --> 01:01:59,674
Me too.

945
01:02:05,096 --> 01:02:06,931
Gosh, this isn't dry yet.

946
01:02:09,392 --> 01:02:10,977
How is sleeping in a car?

947
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:12,729
Apart from feeling stiff

948
01:02:12,812 --> 01:02:14,605
and getting bit by mosquitoes,

949
01:02:15,148 --> 01:02:16,607
it's not too bad.

950
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:19,736
Mosquito bites are itchy.

951
01:02:45,636 --> 01:02:47,221
How can I sleep here?

952
01:03:25,426 --> 01:03:26,844
Why aren't you coming in?

953
01:03:27,428 --> 01:03:28,387
-Oh, right.
-Okay.

954
01:03:31,349 --> 01:03:34,268
Senior Forecaster Um can use
the study over there.

955
01:03:34,352 --> 01:03:35,603
Forecaster Lee can take the small room.

956
01:03:38,147 --> 01:03:39,982
Can we really stay here?

957
01:03:40,066 --> 01:03:41,359
It's not for free.

958
01:03:41,442 --> 01:03:44,612
You have to pay a third
of the monthly maintenance fee.

959
01:03:44,695 --> 01:03:46,447
A third of it?

960
01:03:47,198 --> 01:03:49,992
If you don't want to do that,
you can go home,

961
01:03:50,076 --> 01:03:51,744
and Forecaster Lee can find another place.

962
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:54,622
Si-woo, don't you think
a motel would be better?

963
01:03:55,373 --> 01:03:57,333
What about a sauna nearby?

964
01:03:57,416 --> 01:03:59,794
It'd be more comfortable than this place.

965
01:03:59,877 --> 01:04:02,588
I know, right? We'll get going then.

966
01:04:02,672 --> 01:04:05,132
Do you think of me as a woman?

967
01:04:05,216 --> 01:04:06,592
What are you talking about?

968
01:04:06,676 --> 01:04:08,636
No way.

969
01:04:10,054 --> 01:04:11,931
Just stay then.

970
01:04:12,014 --> 01:04:15,268
Let's say the three brains
of Chief Team Two are staying together

971
01:04:15,351 --> 01:04:17,687
for the summer disaster prevention period.

972
01:04:17,770 --> 01:04:19,897
A brain? Me?

973
01:04:19,981 --> 01:04:22,066
I don't think he's a brain.

974
01:04:22,650 --> 01:04:24,569
What are you saying? Did you forget?

975
01:04:24,652 --> 01:04:27,363
I predicted hail
in the metropolitan area last March.

976
01:04:27,446 --> 01:04:29,282
That was a fluke.

977
01:04:29,365 --> 01:04:30,741
You were just lucky.

978
01:04:30,825 --> 01:04:32,743
I also caught the heavy rain signal.

979
01:04:33,327 --> 01:04:35,204
Hearing that makes me want to drink.

980
01:04:37,164 --> 01:04:38,875
Should I go get some beer?

981
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:41,794
Can you buy some dried squid too?

982
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:44,005
Okay. I'll be right back.

983
01:04:47,008 --> 01:04:47,925
Well…

984
01:04:48,759 --> 01:04:49,886
Where's the bathroom?

985
01:04:49,969 --> 01:04:51,512
It's over there.

986
01:04:52,096 --> 01:04:54,849
There's a bathroom in my room,
so you can use that one.

987
01:04:54,932 --> 01:04:56,225
Okay. Thanks.

988
01:04:58,853 --> 01:04:59,979
Hey…

989
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:04,150
I'm sorry to cause such an inconvenience.

990
01:05:04,233 --> 01:05:06,694
I'll find a place to stay soon.

991
01:05:06,777 --> 01:05:07,653
Okay.

992
01:05:13,659 --> 01:05:15,620
Seriously.

993
01:05:23,502 --> 01:05:26,631
What will Senior Forecaster Um like?

994
01:06:19,308 --> 01:06:21,602
Oh! The side dishes.

995
01:06:33,406 --> 01:06:35,116
Did he forget the passcode?

996
01:06:37,868 --> 01:06:38,953
You're back early.

997
01:06:40,871 --> 01:06:41,998
Ha-kyung.

998
01:06:43,332 --> 01:06:44,792
What are you doing here?

999
01:06:45,376 --> 01:06:47,294
You're here as I expected.

1000
01:06:47,878 --> 01:06:49,755
I came by just in case.

1001
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:52,758
I don't care what you expected.
What are you doing here?

1002
01:06:52,842 --> 01:06:54,010
I just…

1003
01:06:55,636 --> 01:06:58,139
-thought of you.
-What?

1004
01:06:58,723 --> 01:07:00,391
Can I come in for a second?

1005
01:07:00,474 --> 01:07:01,851
Are you crazy?

1006
01:07:03,602 --> 01:07:04,895
How did you know

1007
01:07:04,979 --> 01:07:06,731
that I was going crazy?

1008
01:07:08,232 --> 01:07:10,860
I'm so tired. Can I please come in?

1009
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:14,321
Tell your wife about how tired you are.

1010
01:07:14,405 --> 01:07:15,781
Get lost.

1011
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:20,536
I have something to say to you.
Please let me in.

1012
01:07:20,619 --> 01:07:22,371
No, you can't come in.

1013
01:07:22,455 --> 01:07:23,456
Who's out there?

1014
01:07:25,499 --> 01:07:27,084
Is someone inside?

1015
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:29,837
It's none of your business. Go home.

1016
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:31,714
-Hey.
-I hear a man's voice.

1017
01:07:32,381 --> 01:07:34,383
-Who is it?
-Hey!

1018
01:07:40,431 --> 01:07:42,516
I think I'm really drunk.

1019
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:45,061
Why are you here at this hour?

1020
01:07:46,020 --> 01:07:48,439
Hey, it really is Senior Forecaster Um.

1021
01:07:52,777 --> 01:07:53,986
Director Jin?

1022
01:07:55,029 --> 01:07:56,363
Assistant Director Shin?

1023
01:07:56,447 --> 01:07:58,365
Hey, Assistant Director Shin.

1024
01:07:58,449 --> 01:08:00,451
Why are you here, Senior Forecaster Um?

1025
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:03,746
Because Director Jin
asked me to stay with…

1026
01:08:03,829 --> 01:08:06,415
-What?
-Why would she ask him to stay here?

1027
01:08:09,919 --> 01:08:13,422
Is apartment number 1201 your place?

1028
01:08:14,507 --> 01:08:15,758
Yes, it is.

1029
01:08:15,841 --> 01:08:17,510
Why are you here?

1030
01:08:17,593 --> 01:08:20,012
I'm apartment number 1302.
I live upstairs.

1031
01:08:20,763 --> 01:08:21,680
Pardon?

1032
01:08:22,306 --> 01:08:24,100
Are you neighbors?

1033
01:08:25,142 --> 01:08:27,144
Hold on. What's going on?

1034
01:08:27,228 --> 01:08:29,188
Wait a minute.

1035
01:08:30,564 --> 01:08:31,899
Doors opening.

1036
01:08:35,986 --> 01:08:37,905
Hey, Seok-ho.

1037
01:08:41,534 --> 01:08:42,868
What?

1038
01:08:45,830 --> 01:08:47,915
What's going on?

1039
01:08:47,998 --> 01:08:49,500
That's what I want to ask.

1040
01:08:52,378 --> 01:08:54,296
Ha-kyung, what's going on?

1041
01:08:57,049 --> 01:09:00,636
Life is always
a series of unexpected events.

1042
01:09:05,683 --> 01:09:07,977
What's with all these people?

1043
01:09:08,060 --> 01:09:09,770
Be quiet. Come with me.

1044
01:09:11,564 --> 01:09:14,942
-How many more times
-Ha-kyung.

1045
01:09:15,025 --> 01:09:18,737
do we have to stab each other
to find the optimal distance between us?

1046
01:09:44,013 --> 01:09:46,515
How dare you come here at this hour
and cause a scene? Why?

1047
01:09:46,599 --> 01:09:48,100
I'm sorry, Ha-kyung.

1048
01:09:49,643 --> 01:09:51,061
My dear Ha-kyung was…

1049
01:09:51,145 --> 01:09:53,063
Get off me. Wake up.

1050
01:09:53,147 --> 01:09:56,400
I'm truly sorry, Ha-kyung.

1051
01:09:57,568 --> 01:10:01,822
I keep falling for Ha-kyung.
It's getting out of hand.

1052
01:10:01,906 --> 01:10:04,700
Are there still things
that haven't been sorted out with him?

1053
01:10:04,783 --> 01:10:05,826
How long will this last?

1054
01:10:07,036 --> 01:10:10,664
Who do you think
Reporter Chae's ex-boyfriend was?

1055
01:10:11,957 --> 01:10:13,500
This is all your fault!

1056
01:10:15,628 --> 01:10:16,629
Damn it!

1057
01:10:16,712 --> 01:10:17,796
Stop it, Lee Si-woo!

1058
01:10:18,464 --> 01:10:23,385
