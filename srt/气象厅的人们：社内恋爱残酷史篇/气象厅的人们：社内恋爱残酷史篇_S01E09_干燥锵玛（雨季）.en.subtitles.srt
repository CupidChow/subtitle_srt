1
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:48,423
Look at the cake. It's so pretty.

2
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:52,135
-I guess he's proposing to her.
-I guess so.

3
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:56,139
It's so pretty.

4
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:05,899
Hey.

5
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:08,485
Hey. You got the wrong table.

6
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:10,236
-No?
-No.

7
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,321
Over here.

8
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:15,950
I'm sorry.

9
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:22,749
I'm sorry.

10
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:26,377
-It's so pretty.
-I'm jealous.

11
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:28,838
-I guess it's them.
-What's this?

12
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:30,131
-Goodness.
-I'm sorry.

13
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:32,550
-It's so pretty.
-I'm jealous.

14
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:35,804
-That's pretty.
-What's this?

15
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:38,723
Soo-jin, will you marry me?

16
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,185
Say yes.

17
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:45,647
-Say yes.
-Say yes.

18
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:49,234
For me, marriage was a natural thing
to do when the time came.

19
00:01:50,109 --> 00:01:52,779
Like how flowers bloom in spring

20
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:55,740
and how the rainy season brings
a downpour of rain in summer,

21
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:58,868
it was in the course of nature.

22
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:01,162
With the rainy season approaching,

23
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:03,206
the sweltering heat is in full swing.

24
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:05,041
It will continue to be hot

25
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,252
until the weekend
when the rainy season begins.

26
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:09,379
However, as the climate is changing

27
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:12,799
and the uncertainty
of weather forecasting is increasing…

28
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:14,175
He's so cool.

29
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:15,635
Why is he taking such a risk?

30
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:16,636
What?

31
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:18,638
-I'm jealous.
-He's really cool.

32
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,891
Well, it's too noisy here.

33
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,434
Should we go now?

34
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:25,228
Okay.

35
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:32,068
Is there anything
that we can take for granted?

36
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:33,945
No way.

37
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,531
How is it possible?

38
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:38,908
They're dating?

39
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,244
You must be mistaken.

40
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:43,037
I saw them with my own eyes.

41
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:46,166
I saw Ha-kyung and Si-woo
eating and drinking together.

42
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:47,667
They're on the same team.

43
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,252
So isn't that normal?

44
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:52,630
And Ha-kyung isn't Si-woo's type.

45
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:53,923
He isn't her type either.

46
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,759
She'd never like anyone
so haughty and reckless.

47
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:58,261
Exactly.

48
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:00,847
The two of them dating is nonsense.

49
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:04,392
Jeez.

50
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:16,446
I'm sure

51
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:18,990
Si-woo approached Ha-kyung
to get back at me.

52
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:20,617
What are you saying?

53
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,579
Si-woo oppa is unpredictable,
but he'd never do that.

54
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:27,498
"Oppa"?

55
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,251
Did you just call him oppa?

56
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:34,422
I take it back. It was my mistake.

57
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:37,133
Anyway, he isn't that kind of person.

58
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:41,638
I see. If he isn't,

59
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,348
why did he do this to my face?

60
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:46,100
-That's because you--
-Hey.

61
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:48,353
Don't side with that jerk.

62
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:52,732
What?

63
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:54,192
Do you have something to say?

64
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:59,405
Anyway, they aren't together.

65
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:03,326
So don't drag other people
into our problem.

66
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:07,580
I'm telling you, it's true.

67
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:09,749
He's trying to get back at me!

68
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:19,050
By the way, earlier--

69
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:21,552
What do you want to do on the weekend?

70
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:23,596
-What?
-It's our weekend off.

71
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,139
Do you want to do anything?

72
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:27,850
Well, I don't know.

73
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:31,646
Do you want to see a movie?

74
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:33,982
The new horror movie
that's coming out looks good.

75
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:36,109
All right.

76
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:39,570
We can go for a drive too.

77
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:41,656
That sounds good too.

78
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:43,950
Or we can work out together.

79
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:45,785
You run, don't you?

80
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,287
That sounds good too.

81
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:52,875
Or we can just go grocery shopping.

82
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:54,335
Sure.

83
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:58,006
Why do you say yes to everything?

84
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:01,092
-What?
-You sound so unenthusiastic.

85
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,887
You said yes to all my suggestions.

86
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:07,348
I'm really okay with anything.

87
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,643
Actually, I'm happy just walking with you.

88
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:13,062
I am too,

89
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:16,691
but let's do something special
on the weekend.

90
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:18,484
What do you want to do?

91
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:20,570
Well…

92
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:22,488
there are so many things I want to do.

93
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:25,575
I want to go to
the glow-in-the-dark bowling alley.

94
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,827
I want to go on a trip to Jeju--

95
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:31,039
No, too many people go there
for their honeymoon,

96
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:32,123
so I'll pass.

97
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:34,083
What's wrong with that?

98
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:37,712
Doesn't it feel a little suffocating?

99
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,630
What's suffocating about it?

100
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:41,632
"The end of love is marriage."

101
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:44,052
Such an obvious conclusion
isn't the only answer.

102
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:47,597
But the honeymooners act like
they're the ones who got the right answer.

103
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:53,061
Not everyone is like that,

104
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:55,897
but it looks a bit suffocating.

105
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:01,444
Stay here. I'll get something to drink.

106
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:03,613
-Okay.
-Okay.

107
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:20,421
EPISODE 9
DRY CHANGMA (RAINY SEASON)

108
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:23,174
INNOVATIVE WEATHER SERVICES
A STEPPING STONE TO PUBLIC SAFETY

109
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:29,180
A stationary front has formed
on the southern coast of Jeju,

110
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:32,433
and it's expected to rain starting
from Jeju early tomorrow morning.

111
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:36,813
The moving speed
of the stationary front is 35km/h,

112
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,564
which aligns with our initial forecast.

113
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,317
-Did you say 35?
-Yes.

114
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:45,905
At this rate, it'll start to rain

115
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:49,575
in the metropolitan area tomorrow evening
as we first predicted, right?

116
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:50,535
Yes, sir.

117
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:55,248
-What about the press?
-Yes.

118
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:56,833
Because of the prolonged heatwave,

119
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,835
they're looking forward
to the rainy season.

120
00:06:58,918 --> 00:06:59,877
Is that so?

121
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:01,879
Okay.

122
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:05,049
Proceed with the press briefing
as scheduled and let's move on.

123
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:07,969
Okay. Jeju Office?

124
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,348
All right.

125
00:07:12,431 --> 00:07:13,641
Good work.

126
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:15,726
-Good work.
-Good work.

127
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:18,896
NATIONAL METEOROLOGICAL CENTER
COMPREHENSIVE CONTROL SYSTEM

128
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,158
May I have a word with you?

129
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,177
Are you dating Lee Si-woo?

130
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:52,054
What?

131
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:53,848
What did you say?

132
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:55,892
I saw you two together.

133
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:59,520
The restaurant that
I took you to for drinks.

134
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:01,230
You two were there.

135
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:05,318
Oh, that day.

136
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:07,737
Si-woo and I are on the same team.

137
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,405
Can't colleagues drink together?

138
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,032
Did that look like we were dating?

139
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:11,991
No.

140
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:15,119
You two kissing made it
look like you were dating.

141
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,122
You're crazy.

142
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:20,958
Ha-kyung, you've changed so much.

143
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:24,754
When you were with me,
you hated public displays of affection.

144
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:27,381
But you kissed him openly at a restaurant.

145
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:33,846
I knew there was something

146
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:36,474
when you two bickered.

147
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:39,352
I thought it was weird
when you pulled him aside,

148
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:41,562
so I followed you,
and you were very affectionate.

149
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:43,397
Hey…

150
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:46,817
how could I turn a blind eye
when my subordinate got beat up?

151
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:49,862
By none other than
my nutcase ex-boyfriend?

152
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:51,280
-"Nutcase"?
-Yes, a nutcase!

153
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,866
I had a terribly shameful
office romance with you.

154
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,868
Why would I do that again? Are you nuts?

155
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:57,954
-Well, that--
-And…

156
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:01,666
me kissing someone

157
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:03,626
is none of your business.

158
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:04,961
-Hey!
-What?

159
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,171
I'm worried about you.

160
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:09,632
Men know what men are like.

161
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,467
That punk, Si-woo, is a jerk.

162
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:15,179
I wasn't going to tell you this,

163
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,682
but do you know what he did at my wedding?

164
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:21,352
If you were such a good guy,
why did you marry someone else

165
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:23,980
after mailing out our wedding invitations?

166
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:27,024
Hey, I couldn't help it because of Yu-jin.

167
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:29,694
But he's using you to get back at me.

168
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:32,071
So you're worried about me?

169
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:33,406
Of course, I am.

170
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:35,616
No, you're worried about people

171
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,660
talking about you if I date Si-woo.

172
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:39,120
That's part of the reason too.

173
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:41,831
Wouldn't you be bothered by it?

174
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,834
-Hey!
-What?

175
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,002
Get lost.

176
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:53,175
Ha-kyung, you can't date him!

177
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,177
He's not the one for you!

178
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:59,223
Gosh, she's a half-wit.

179
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:17,158
He's really trying to get back at me!

180
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:18,868
Seriously.

181
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:43,851
You look so happy to have the weekend off.

182
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:47,730
Of course. I haven't had
the weekend off in so long.

183
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:48,898
Honestly…

184
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:51,817
I have no one to hang out with
when I have a weekday off.

185
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,946
I wish I was free on my day off.

186
00:10:56,614 --> 00:11:00,451
When I have a weekend off,
I have to look after my kids all day.

187
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:03,746
I have to take them out to eat
and on field trips.

188
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:06,332
Working is more relaxing.

189
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:07,416
I see.

190
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:13,381
I think I know
what Senior Forecaster Um is going to do.

191
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,386
What are you doing tomorrow?

192
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,971
I'm going on a date.

193
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:22,932
I hear there's a good musical.

194
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:25,309
I love musicals. What's it called?

195
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:28,562
The title is…

196
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:31,023
-Emergency.
-"Emergency"?

197
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,400
"Emergency"?

198
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:34,693
-I've never heard of it.
-Sorry?

199
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:37,488
It's a small theater musical.

200
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:39,115
A small theater.

201
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:41,033
What's wrong?

202
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,078
What about you, Assistant Director Shin?

203
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:47,248
I don't do anything special on weekends.

204
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:50,876
I make coffee first thing in the morning.

205
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:53,879
Ki-jun found out.

206
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:56,132
How?

207
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:59,844
-I like smelling coffee in the morning.
-He saw us together in the restaurant.

208
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,764
So what did you tell him?

209
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,350
I told him we weren't dating.

210
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:14,150
I eat a simple salad for breakfast.

211
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:18,654
After I work out, I clean the house.

212
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:21,073
Do you think he'll believe that?

213
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:22,741
Why don't we just come out?

214
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:24,910
We have to play innocent.

215
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:27,329
I eat when the food comes.

216
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:29,790
After lunch…

217
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:32,835
Let's not go to Daehangno tomorrow.

218
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:35,921
Why not?

219
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:38,591
Ki-jun's favorite
spicy chicken place is there.

220
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:41,427
He goes there from time to time.
He might be there tomorrow.

221
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:44,513
Classical pianists have
different brain structures.

222
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:45,639
Actually…

223
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:47,558
I had a hard time getting the tickets.

224
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:50,436
Do you want to run along the Han River?

225
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:51,645
Even if it's the same piece…

226
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:54,940
No. For the time being,
outdoor activities are prohibited.

227
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,319
But we can't stay home.

228
00:12:58,402 --> 00:13:01,822
The biggest difference is that
jazz pianists have good reactivity

229
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:04,158
and classic pianists have accuracy.

230
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:06,160
It's interesting.

231
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:10,998
Depending on what genre you specialize in,

232
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:13,250
the brainwave displays differently.

233
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:16,420
It can apply to us.

234
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:20,382
We're all weather forecasters,
but local forecasters…

235
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:25,971
CONTINUOUS HEATWAVE…
JIN HA-KYUNG?

236
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:29,141
Do you know who he's dating right now?

237
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:30,726
Who is he dating?

238
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,394
Jin Ha-kyung.

239
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:35,940
Nonsense.

240
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:38,025
-What is?
-What?

241
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:40,653
-What's nonsense?
-It's nothing.

242
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:43,989
MOTHER-IN-LAW

243
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:04,927
Hello, ma'am. How are you?

244
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:08,514
Pardon?

245
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:13,644
Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot.

246
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:15,980
I'll tell Ki-jun.

247
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:18,607
Yes.

248
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,902
Yes, I'll see you on the weekend.

249
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:23,153
Okay.

250
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:39,962
Where are you going?

251
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:42,339
-I'm going shopping.
-Shopping?

252
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:54,435
Hi, Tae-kyung.

253
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,688
Mom wants you to come by after work.

254
00:14:57,771 --> 00:14:59,189
I'm busy.

255
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:05,362
If you don't come,
Mom will go to your place.

256
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:07,823
-Do whatever--
-Si-woo.

257
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,325
What should we have for dinner?

258
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:11,410
How about budaejjigae?

259
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:12,912
Do you know how to make it?

260
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:15,789
-I'll be right there. Bye.
-Well, I know how to order it.

261
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,627
-That's weird.
-What is it?

262
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,003
She can't come?

263
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:24,298
-She'll be here.
-What?

264
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:26,300
Mom.

265
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:28,093
Will you really have it out with her?

266
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:29,219
Just give up.

267
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:31,639
How can I? She's my daughter.

268
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:37,561
What else should we get?

269
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:40,439
-Dumplings.
-Dumplings?

270
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:42,399
-Do we have instant noodles at home?
-Yes.

271
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:45,945
We're ordering budaejjigae.
What toppings do you want?

272
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:48,489
I need to go to my mother's.

273
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:49,823
Enjoy your dinner.

274
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:51,825
To her mother's?

275
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:55,454
-Did something happen?
-I don't know.

276
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:09,093
Where should I go
for the field trip assignment this time?

277
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:11,971
Where are you?

278
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:13,847
I'm at work of course.

279
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:15,724
I told you he left earlier.

280
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:20,521
Where in the world is he staying?

281
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:24,233
Mom?

282
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:26,860
Yes?

283
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:29,488
Nothing. I'll take care of it.

284
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:33,158
-What is it?
-A field trip.

285
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,123
I know where to go.

286
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,753
Think of it as your mother's last wish.

287
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:47,172
Just three blind dates.

288
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:50,175
Yes, Ha-kyung. Try it.

289
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,137
I told you no.

290
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,431
Will you let my money go to waste?

291
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,850
What about my time that'll go to waste?

292
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:00,060
So…

293
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:02,229
just go on only three blind dates.

294
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:06,400
Who knows? You might find the right one.

295
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:10,612
They say that people who get married
through matchmaking services

296
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:14,324
have a lower divorce rate
than those who get married after dating.

297
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:16,702
Why are you looking at me?

298
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:18,787
Hot romance?

299
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,331
It's meaningless.

300
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:24,334
Look at her. She acted like
she couldn't live without him,

301
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:26,503
but she got divorced within a year.

302
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:28,672
Why do you have to bring that up?

303
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:29,965
Jeez!

304
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:37,473
Don't hold memorial services
for me after I'm dead.

305
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:40,559
Be good to me while I'm alive, okay?

306
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:42,770
Okay?

307
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:55,532
How dare you!

308
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:58,410
It's your mother's last wish
before she dies.

309
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:01,830
How can you say no just like that?

310
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,040
How?

311
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:08,087
My goodness. How can you say no so easily?

312
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,714
Stop forcing me to get married.

313
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:15,302
My goodness.

314
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:18,138
-I'm leaving.
-Don't be like that.

315
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,309
She's acting like that
because she's really worried.

316
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:24,728
We are her only children.

317
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:28,148
Her elder daughter got divorced,

318
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:30,484
and her younger daughter
broke off her engagement.

319
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:34,613
I guess she wants us to have someone
to lean on before she dies.

320
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:36,907
Just grant her wish.

321
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:42,621
You guys can get married then.

322
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:44,123
Hey, don't say that.

323
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,710
Do you know how I feel when Mom does this?

324
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:51,839
I feel like I'm being driven
to the edge of a cliff.

325
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:55,092
If she really cares about me,
she shouldn't make me feel like this.

326
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:59,888
Yes. You're right.

327
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:04,059
Anyway, I hate feeling like this. Bye.

328
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:30,169
Mom.

329
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:34,798
Were you happy
when you were married to Dad?

330
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:39,094
What kind of stupid question is that?

331
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,472
No marriage is always happy.

332
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:45,517
There are good times and bad times.

333
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:49,605
When all is said and done,
two is better than one,

334
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,690
and three is better than two.

335
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:54,067
My friend Mi-jeong's youngest daughter

336
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:56,570
said she'd live alone forever.

337
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:57,487
But look at her.

338
00:19:57,571 --> 00:20:00,449
She's happily married with children.

339
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,202
Her husband has a stable job too.

340
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:08,665
Your friends' daughters
and Ha-kyung may be different.

341
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:11,919
Maybe she's better off alone.

342
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:13,337
What?

343
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:18,258
It just crossed my mind.

344
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:23,013
Good night.
You must be tired from being angry.

345
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:37,736
Hi.

346
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:40,739
Hi.

347
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:43,909
Your mom called this afternoon.

348
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:48,872
She wants to have dinner with us tomorrow.

349
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:50,874
You can come, right?

350
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:53,919
Did you go shopping again?

351
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:57,673
-That's not--
-You're so carefree.

352
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:00,008
Aren't we on a tight budget
because the rent is so high?

353
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:04,054
We can take out another loan
to pay for the key money,

354
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:07,057
but you know we need money
for the moving expenses.

355
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:10,769
Are you saying that
I'm spending thoughtlessly?

356
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:12,938
If you aren't

357
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:15,732
you wouldn't have bought
something that expensive.

358
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:18,110
-Ki-jun.
-Let's not do this.

359
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:19,861
I don't want to fight.

360
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:21,571
I'm washing up.

361
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:44,344
Did something happen at home?

362
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:51,727
Kind of.

363
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:54,146
You don't have to worry though.

364
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:00,319
If you're tired,

365
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:03,030
we can just hang out at home tomorrow.

366
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:11,913
Can you come out to the living room?

367
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:21,131
Do you want some beer?

368
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:27,137
No, thank you.

369
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:28,722
I'm good.

370
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:45,155
I guess we can't stay home.

371
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:46,323
Right?

372
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:48,158
Let's avoid crowded places.

373
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,954
Is there any place that's especially quiet

374
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:54,915
when it rains?

375
00:22:58,418 --> 00:23:01,046
There is one place.

376
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:04,508
-Where?
-Do you like nature?

377
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:06,676
Of course.

378
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:10,514
Can you stand being uncomfortable?

379
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:15,977
To a certain extent?

380
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:17,979
Good then.

381
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:22,984
Where is he going to take me?

382
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:49,344
What's wrong with you?

383
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:18,331
It's your day off, right?

384
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:20,458
We need to talk.

385
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:22,878
Come to the brunch café when you wake up.

386
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:24,171
I'll be waiting for you.

387
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:27,632
No.

388
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:48,737
You're here.

389
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,071
Lee Si-woo.

390
00:24:50,697 --> 00:24:52,324
-Hi.
-Shall we go?

391
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:53,325
What?

392
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:54,993
"Colleagues"?

393
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:59,289
I'll catch you red-handed.

394
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:33,281
Where are they going?

395
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:42,332
Damn it.

396
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:52,008
HONEY

397
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:55,136
Where are you? Did you forget
that we're visiting your mom?

398
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:58,223
We have to leave before 6 p.m.,
so come home before then.

399
00:25:58,306 --> 00:26:00,183
There's enough time.

400
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:04,646
The traffic is getting better now.

401
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:07,691
-Where are we going?
-We're almost there.

402
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:12,904
I hope you like it.

403
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:37,804
-Thanks.
-You can go that way.

404
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:39,264
-Okay.
-Thank you.

405
00:26:56,614 --> 00:26:58,241
Who pooped here…

406
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:05,373
Jeez.

407
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:12,297
HONEY

408
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:20,597
It's really nice.

409
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:23,975
-Aren't you glad we came?
-Yes.

410
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:26,519
-Isn't it too heavy?
-No, it's okay.

411
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:43,119
Why won't he text me back? Where is he?

412
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:59,511
The person you are trying to reach
is unavailable. Please leave a message…

413
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:11,147
We have to go to Camping Site B.

414
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:12,982
We should go that way.

415
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:15,652
It's a little far.

416
00:28:15,735 --> 00:28:17,278
It's okay. We can walk.

417
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:18,488
-Let's go.
-Okay.

418
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:21,241
-Do you need help?
-No.

419
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:22,826
-Will you be okay?
-Yes.

420
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:24,327
Let's go.

421
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:26,496
It looks light. Let me get on.

422
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:28,832
Are you going to sit there? I'll pull you.

423
00:28:28,915 --> 00:28:31,543
I'll collect evidence
so she can't deny it.

424
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:37,882
Where's my phone?

425
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:40,552
There's enough time.

426
00:28:44,597 --> 00:28:47,142
Damn it! Why did I leave it there?

427
00:29:33,396 --> 00:29:34,564
Did she go somewhere?

428
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:37,776
Si-woo, did you eat?

429
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:41,654
Should we go out
and grab something to eat?

430
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:46,826
Jeez. I guess they're both out.

431
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:50,497
Well…

432
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:01,800
MOBILE DISASTER PREVENTION
AND WEATHER SYSTEM

433
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:02,717
NO CONNECTION

434
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:11,059
That's weird. There's no connection.

435
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:12,602
The internet isn't working, right?

436
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:14,020
No.

437
00:30:14,103 --> 00:30:16,272
He said it'd work.

438
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:18,483
I just want to check
the real-time conditions.

439
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:21,945
Hold on a second.

440
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:26,032
-What is it?
-Seok-ho.

441
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:29,327
Can you check the radar, please?

442
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:31,621
You can do it yourself.

443
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:35,333
I'm outside and there's no internet here.

444
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:37,210
Please do me a favor.

445
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:43,091
Wait.

446
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:44,008
What did he say?

447
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:46,427
He'll check. Give me your phone.

448
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:49,055
Right now

449
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:50,890
the stationary front is moving north.

450
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:54,352
Jeju is getting 5mm of rain
and the South Sea is getting a few drops.

451
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:55,645
Okay.

452
00:30:57,689 --> 00:31:00,567
Raindrops are falling in Jeju
and the southern regions.

453
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:04,320
Seok-ho, hold on.

454
00:31:04,904 --> 00:31:07,282
Ask him for the NWP model from 1 p.m. too.

455
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:08,783
The NWP model too?

456
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:12,662
Who are you with?

457
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:18,918
My girlfriend.

458
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:23,756
Then forget about it

459
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:25,925
and focus on your date.

460
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:30,471
Chief Team One will monitor
the real-time situation.

461
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:31,681
-Bye.
-Okay.

462
00:31:36,644 --> 00:31:37,729
What did he say?

463
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:41,065
He told me not to worry about it
and do my thing

464
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:43,776
because there are people
working at the KMA other than me.

465
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:46,654
I know that. I'm just curious.

466
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:48,072
Seok-ho is right.

467
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:50,700
We need to rest
to cheer up and work again.

468
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:53,828
The stationary front is heading north
as we expected.

469
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:56,372
So let's forget about it
and focus on each other.

470
00:31:57,665 --> 00:31:58,666
Okay.

471
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:04,255
-Should I wash these?
-Yes.

472
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:27,278
Yes.

473
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:29,364
Yes.

474
00:32:29,989 --> 00:32:31,574
Chief Team One will do a good job.

475
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:34,160
Yes.

476
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:45,296
A vanilla latte with soy instead of milk

477
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,423
and add only two syrups please.

478
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:49,133
I'll use my coupon.

479
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:52,053
-What's your name?
-It's Shin Seok-ho.

480
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:58,309
It's not there.

481
00:32:59,435 --> 00:33:01,854
Not there? I got a stamp the other day.

482
00:33:02,438 --> 00:33:04,691
-From me?
-No, from the other clerk.

483
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:05,817
Okay.

484
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:07,735
I'm getting coffee.

485
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:10,697
I'll check it with my boss later.

486
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,156
Can you pay for this for now?

487
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:15,618
Excuse me. My coupon is gone.

488
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:17,704
You said you'd keep it safe.

489
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:18,913
This isn't right.

490
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:23,376
What? Apartment number 1302?

491
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:26,421
Other customers are waiting.

492
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:28,464
Please check again.

493
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:38,808
Hello.

494
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:40,852
Hey. What brings you here?

495
00:33:42,061 --> 00:33:43,855
I'm here to get coffee, of course.

496
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:44,897
Okay.

497
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:47,608
What's going on, apartment number 1302?

498
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:51,362
They lost my fully stamped coupon.

499
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:54,365
Did you leave it with them?

500
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:57,493
Well, I already told him
that I couldn't find it

501
00:33:58,077 --> 00:33:59,078
at the moment.

502
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:04,000
I'll check with the manager later,
so if you could pay for it--

503
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:06,210
I was going to use my coupon,
so I didn't bring my wallet.

504
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:09,547
-Do you want me to cancel your order?
-Seriously?

505
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:12,258
-I'll pay for it.
-It's okay.

506
00:34:12,341 --> 00:34:14,510
You helped me last time.

507
00:34:15,344 --> 00:34:16,804
What did you order?

508
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:20,141
A vanilla latte with soy instead of milk

509
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:22,226
and two pumps of syrup.

510
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:26,189
That and one cool, iced Americano please.

511
00:34:26,272 --> 00:34:27,648
I'll pay for them both.

512
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:28,858
Okay.

513
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:30,693
Well…

514
00:34:31,819 --> 00:34:34,947
"cool, iced Americano"
is an incorrect expression

515
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:38,117
because iced means it's already cool.

516
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:45,291
-Don't you think I know that?
-Right.

517
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:49,128
-Thank you.
-Sure.

518
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:00,515
One chamomile, please.

519
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:12,777
Wait! Sir!

520
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,028
Wait!

521
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:15,613
My car!

522
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:18,658
Wait! Wait for me!

523
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:20,409
Hey!

524
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:29,252
What?

525
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:31,379
I can't stop thinking about it.

526
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:34,298
It'll rain, right?

527
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:40,096
It will. The sky is so dark.

528
00:35:40,721 --> 00:35:41,889
It'll rain.

529
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:53,484
Hey.

530
00:35:58,322 --> 00:35:59,448
You're curious too.

531
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:03,202
Let's do this. Give me your phone.

532
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:09,542
Whoever picks up their phone first
has to do the dishes.

533
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:13,004
Okay, then…

534
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:15,923
don't we need to cook first?

535
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:19,635
Camping is all about barbecue.

536
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:21,220
Okay.

537
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:24,473
What did you bring?

538
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:26,893
What?

539
00:36:31,647 --> 00:36:32,690
What is it?

540
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,820
I thought I packed meat.

541
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:13,189
It's okay.

542
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:15,816
Camping is all about having kimchi stew.

543
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,944
We have nothing to make broth with.

544
00:37:19,695 --> 00:37:21,948
Should I go and get some meat?

545
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:24,033
It's okay. All we need is kimchi.

546
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:30,248
It's okay.

547
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:53,521
How is it coming along?

548
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:56,357
-Is it good?
-I don't know.

549
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,817
I haven't tasted it yet.

550
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,860
-You're a good cook.
-Try it.

551
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:01,362
-Can I?
-Yes.

552
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:06,784
-It's good.
-Is it?

553
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:07,952
Try it.

554
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,832
-Isn't it good?
-I think I'm a genius.

555
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:14,792
It's good.

556
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:16,210
Stay there. Look here.

557
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:20,881
VEHICLES SUBJECT TO FINES AND TOWS

558
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:30,057
HONEY

559
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:32,351
-Hey.
-Where are you?

560
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:35,980
-Well, Yu-jin…
-I'll go straight to your mother's.

561
00:38:36,063 --> 00:38:37,523
Meet me there, okay?

562
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:38,816
Don't be late.

563
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:11,891
Where have you been?

564
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,185
What happened to you?

565
00:39:15,936 --> 00:39:17,563
Something happened.

566
00:39:18,981 --> 00:39:20,733
Did you forget what today is?

567
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:23,110
It's your mother's birthday.

568
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:24,278
Hey.

569
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:27,323
Why do you have to say "your mother"?

570
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:30,493
You can just call her Mother or Mom.

571
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:33,913
She called me two days ago
to have dinner with us.

572
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:36,749
Where have you been all day?

573
00:39:36,832 --> 00:39:38,751
Do you know how awkward it was?

574
00:39:40,836 --> 00:39:42,630
Did Mom say something?

575
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:45,216
Where have you been?

576
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:47,676
Do I need your permission
whenever I go somewhere?

577
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:49,637
There was something

578
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:52,390
very important that I needed to check.

579
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:54,892
Don't tell me

580
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:56,769
you went to see Ha-kyung again.

581
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:02,400
You said you couldn't believe
that they were together.

582
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:04,902
Is that so important to you?

583
00:40:04,985 --> 00:40:06,654
You even forgot your mom's birthday.

584
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:10,241
Why?

585
00:40:10,324 --> 00:40:12,910
When I broke off the engagement
with Ha-kyung and married you,

586
00:40:12,993 --> 00:40:14,620
people said nasty things about me.

587
00:40:14,703 --> 00:40:17,123
They said it was
as if I dumped a faithful wife.

588
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:20,126
They also called me a two-timer
who made a shameless transfer.

589
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:23,129
I had to hear all kinds of terrible names.

590
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:26,173
I can't let Ha-kyung
act like she's a victim.

591
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:28,717
She's dating none other
than Si-woo, that jerk!

592
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:29,760
Ki-jun.

593
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:32,388
I want you to focus on our problem.

594
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:34,974
There are so many issues to solve.

595
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:36,600
Exactly.

596
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:40,646
I need to take care of this
so I can focus on other things, Yu-jin.

597
00:40:40,729 --> 00:40:41,856
So what will you do?

598
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:44,608
Will you tell everyone?

599
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:46,235
Why not?

600
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:49,155
If you do,

601
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:51,115
people will talk about us too.

602
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:53,200
Haven't you thought about that?

603
00:40:57,621 --> 00:40:59,039
Be honest.

604
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:01,500
Stopping her from acting like
a victim is an excuse.

605
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:04,295
Aren't you just jealous
because they're going out?

606
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:07,256
Jealous?

607
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:09,049
Of Si-woo?

608
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:10,676
Why would I be?

609
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:12,470
You must know why better than I do.

610
00:41:33,115 --> 00:41:34,325
It's not raining.

611
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:37,411
It's not.

612
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:45,377
It doesn't look like it will.

613
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:49,507
It probably won't.

614
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:52,301
What time is it?

615
00:41:55,429 --> 00:41:57,681
It's 20:21.

616
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:00,935
We're doomed.

617
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:04,939
Cheers.

618
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,441
Cheers.

619
00:42:12,571 --> 00:42:15,616
INNOVATIVE WEATHER SERVICES
A STEPPING STONE TO PUBLIC SAFETY

620
00:42:38,013 --> 00:42:40,683
The meeting started ten minutes ago.

621
00:42:42,184 --> 00:42:43,018
Okay.

622
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:47,523
The NWP model showed that
the stationary front was moving north.

623
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:50,192
Why isn't it raining?

624
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:52,611
Due to the abnormal development
of anticyclone over the Okhotsk Sea

625
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:54,154
and the cold air in the north,

626
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:56,282
the northward movement
of the stationary front is being delayed.

627
00:42:57,866 --> 00:43:01,745
Isn't that what Senior Forecaster Um was
worried about in the last meeting?

628
00:43:03,038 --> 00:43:04,248
It is.

629
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:10,713
When will it rain?

630
00:43:10,796 --> 00:43:13,465
We're expecting it
to come early next week.

631
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:16,176
But if this continues,
the possibility of further delay

632
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:17,720
can't be ruled out.

633
00:43:20,222 --> 00:43:21,724
Goodness.

634
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:27,229
First of all,
send explanatory data to the media

635
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:30,357
about why the rain is delayed.

636
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:31,942
Let's do our best

637
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,154
to monitor the situation.

638
00:43:35,821 --> 00:43:36,864
-Okay.
-Okay.

639
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:39,783
Wouldn't it be better to mention
the possibility of dry changma

640
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:41,285
for the sake of the future?

641
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:43,704
-"Dry changma"?
-Yes.

642
00:43:44,246 --> 00:43:46,999
We can't do that because
the stationary front is still there.

643
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:50,544
Even if it is cloudy and there is no rain,

644
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:52,546
there's a higher chance of precipitation.

645
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:54,965
So it's wrong
to make a hasty announcement.

646
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:01,722
Isn't making hasty conclusions
your specialty?

647
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:03,140
What is it?

648
00:44:03,223 --> 00:44:05,726
Is your hunch not working this time?

649
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:09,021
Even that hunch

650
00:44:09,104 --> 00:44:12,107
is based on data and meteorological flow.

651
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:13,901
Either it's right or wrong.

652
00:44:13,984 --> 00:44:15,611
I can't give out vague information

653
00:44:15,694 --> 00:44:18,280
just because
I'm afraid of being criticized.

654
00:44:18,364 --> 00:44:19,907
"Vague information"?

655
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:23,619
Doesn't "for the sake of the future"
mean "vague information"?

656
00:44:27,581 --> 00:44:29,291
What are they doing?

657
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:31,418
That's enough.

658
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:32,920
No. Keep going.

659
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:33,921
Pardon?

660
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,048
I said keep going.

661
00:44:36,548 --> 00:44:38,926
Why don't you two have a debate about it?

662
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:40,969
Come up with a conclusion too.

663
00:44:41,053 --> 00:44:44,848
We'll release that conclusion
with explanations to the press.

664
00:44:45,432 --> 00:44:46,600
That'd be good, right?

665
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:47,935
What?

666
00:44:48,727 --> 00:44:49,937
Is there a problem?

667
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:53,691
No, there isn't. We'll do that.

668
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:57,444
Okay. Keep going.

669
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:14,920
Director Jin.

670
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:18,465
I'll be back.

671
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:20,217
Will you be okay?

672
00:45:20,926 --> 00:45:22,010
Yes.

673
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:02,718
First, let's analyze
why this forecast was wrong.

674
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:07,347
Aren't we coming up with an explanation
for why the rainy season is delayed?

675
00:46:09,475 --> 00:46:11,435
We need to review starting
from the initial forecast

676
00:46:11,518 --> 00:46:13,562
and see what we missed.

677
00:46:13,645 --> 00:46:17,399
Only then can we explain the gap
between the expected and actual dates.

678
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:22,321
Okay.

679
00:46:22,988 --> 00:46:24,656
Where should we start?

680
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:29,703
During the early forecast,

681
00:46:29,786 --> 00:46:32,247
why did you predict
that rain from the stationary front

682
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:36,752
would fall in Jeju and the southern part
of Korea five days later?

683
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:41,006
If you look at the strong wind
at 200hPa above the stationary front

684
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:44,009
and the speed of the anticyclone
of the North Pacific,

685
00:46:44,092 --> 00:46:46,595
there was a possibility of development.

686
00:46:51,892 --> 00:46:53,310
The explanation isn't out yet?

687
00:46:53,393 --> 00:46:54,394
No.

688
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:00,317
Do you know

689
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,277
why it's being delayed?

690
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:03,987
I guess they're revising it.

691
00:47:13,956 --> 00:47:15,707
I'm right.

692
00:47:16,291 --> 00:47:17,376
Look at this.

693
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:19,878
This upper part is strong,
so the lower can't move up.

694
00:47:20,462 --> 00:47:21,338
I'm right.

695
00:47:21,421 --> 00:47:23,507
-It's too weak.
-Mr. Lee, look.

696
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:27,970
This front isn't able to move up
because of the anticyclone.

697
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:31,098
That's why it's not happening.
You're missing that.

698
00:48:14,808 --> 00:48:17,894
-Hello.
-Hello.

699
00:48:24,276 --> 00:48:26,361
-Where is Forecaster Lee?
-Well…

700
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:29,823
he's at the Office of Spokesperson
preparing the explanation.

701
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:33,744
He said he sent the details
of today's work to your email.

702
00:48:34,536 --> 00:48:36,705
-Here it is.
-Okay.

703
00:48:39,958 --> 00:48:41,793
-Good work.
-Good work.

704
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:43,003
Good work.

705
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,255
Don't worry.

706
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:47,591
-Doors closing.
-They won't fight again.

707
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:51,678
Let's grab dinner.

708
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:52,929
-Okay.
-Okay.

709
00:48:53,513 --> 00:48:55,974
-I want something refreshing.
-Like what?

710
00:48:57,476 --> 00:48:58,477
Cold noodles.

711
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:13,200
It was wrong to analyze that
the stationary front was moving north

712
00:49:13,283 --> 00:49:16,662
due to the trough and strong winds
in the central-northern region of China.

713
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:21,249
Anyone would have made that conclusion.

714
00:49:21,958 --> 00:49:24,961
Senior Forecaster Um's theory
that the stationary front

715
00:49:25,045 --> 00:49:26,838
would move south made sense,

716
00:49:26,922 --> 00:49:28,674
but the probability was low.

717
00:49:28,757 --> 00:49:31,343
You said you trusted your hunch.

718
00:49:31,426 --> 00:49:34,388
But when you had to take responsibility,
you went with probability.

719
00:49:35,347 --> 00:49:37,724
Isn't that a lame excuse?

720
00:49:39,559 --> 00:49:41,061
Because I wasn't sure.

721
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:45,816
Someone told me that it was too risky

722
00:49:46,692 --> 00:49:49,152
to go with my intuition
because the safety of too many people

723
00:49:49,778 --> 00:49:50,946
was at stake.

724
00:50:03,583 --> 00:50:06,712
Then why are you taking
a risk with Ha-kyung?

725
00:50:07,963 --> 00:50:11,049
She looks strong,
but she's actually tender-hearted.

726
00:50:11,133 --> 00:50:13,844
She must have had
a hard time because I hurt her.

727
00:50:13,927 --> 00:50:15,762
We're working on explanatory data.

728
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:19,683
If you're dating Ha-kyung
because you're mad at me or my wife…

729
00:50:22,018 --> 00:50:23,770
you should stop seeing her.

730
00:50:26,064 --> 00:50:27,983
Ha-kyung never does anything poorly.

731
00:50:28,608 --> 00:50:32,154
If she really did start something,
then she must be sincere.

732
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:34,698
So if she gets hurt again,

733
00:50:34,781 --> 00:50:37,659
she might not be able to recuperate.

734
00:50:38,952 --> 00:50:41,997
You're the one who hurt her.

735
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:43,665
Don't you think you're being too nosy?

736
00:50:43,749 --> 00:50:45,000
Exactly.

737
00:50:47,753 --> 00:50:49,796
Because I hurt her,

738
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,673
I'm worried about her too.

739
00:51:01,057 --> 00:51:02,559
Don't worry.

740
00:51:03,185 --> 00:51:04,895
I'm also the type of person

741
00:51:04,978 --> 00:51:07,522
who doesn't start something
if I'm not sincere about it.

742
00:51:19,075 --> 00:51:20,994
Release this as an explanation.

743
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:25,207
I'll get going then.

744
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:31,004
By the way…

745
00:51:38,386 --> 00:51:40,180
See you next week, Seong-jun.

746
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:41,473
Bye.

747
00:52:55,797 --> 00:52:56,882
Why…

748
00:52:58,425 --> 00:53:00,302
did you break up with him?

749
00:53:02,762 --> 00:53:03,722
What?

750
00:53:03,805 --> 00:53:06,641
Honestly, he seems like a good man.

751
00:53:07,475 --> 00:53:08,643
No…

752
00:53:09,394 --> 00:53:10,812
he is a good man.

753
00:53:11,396 --> 00:53:13,857
Why did you leave him and come to me?

754
00:53:17,903 --> 00:53:19,529
Don't you know?

755
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:20,780
No.

756
00:53:22,991 --> 00:53:24,576
I really don't.

757
00:53:25,201 --> 00:53:26,953
You asked me to marry you.

758
00:53:30,582 --> 00:53:32,167
You were the first.

759
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:36,463
You were the first man to ask me

760
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:39,215
to marry him, not just date.

761
00:53:43,678 --> 00:53:44,971
I'm sorry.

762
00:53:46,181 --> 00:53:47,724
You married

763
00:53:47,807 --> 00:53:49,976
a penniless bloke.

764
00:53:53,688 --> 00:53:55,941
That's why you're not
registering our marriage.

765
00:54:00,612 --> 00:54:02,948
Why are you so pathetic?

766
00:54:03,031 --> 00:54:05,325
Do you think that's why I put off

767
00:54:05,408 --> 00:54:06,952
our marriage registration?

768
00:54:07,535 --> 00:54:08,370
Then why?

769
00:54:08,453 --> 00:54:09,829
Honestly…

770
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:13,166
you haven't really focused on us
since we got married.

771
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:17,545
You're worried about
what others think of our marriage.

772
00:54:17,629 --> 00:54:20,382
Now you're so concerned
about Ha-kyung dating Si-woo

773
00:54:20,465 --> 00:54:23,635
that you can't even focus on anything.

774
00:54:24,678 --> 00:54:27,097
How can I register our marriage
when I'm not sure

775
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:28,598
if you even love me anymore?

776
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:31,893
How can I trust you?

777
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:34,062
Don't make excuses.

778
00:54:35,397 --> 00:54:36,690
There's only one reason.

779
00:54:36,773 --> 00:54:40,276
Keep your eyes on me.
You said you loved me.

780
00:55:16,563 --> 00:55:18,356
Did something happen with Ki-jun?

781
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:22,318
I want to do better.

782
00:55:22,402 --> 00:55:23,987
-What?
-What?

783
00:55:24,612 --> 00:55:26,114
Let's analyze

784
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:29,701
-the stationary front again.
-Why?

785
00:55:30,201 --> 00:55:31,828
Did you catch a strange signal?

786
00:55:31,911 --> 00:55:35,081
No, I found something when I was
working with Deputy Director Han.

787
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:36,207
Here.

788
00:55:37,333 --> 00:55:39,377
The Okhotsk air mass,
which has been developing abnormally,

789
00:55:39,461 --> 00:55:41,004
is stopping its expansion.

790
00:55:41,087 --> 00:55:43,214
There's also an inflow
of water vapor from the southwest.

791
00:55:43,298 --> 00:55:45,216
Isn't it still too weak

792
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:47,761
to activate the anticyclone
of the North Pacific?

793
00:55:47,844 --> 00:55:49,763
-What do you think?
-I agree with you.

794
00:55:50,638 --> 00:55:52,974
Take a look at this part.

795
00:55:53,058 --> 00:55:55,935
Don't you think
the rain particles are getting larger?

796
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:57,687
It's uncertain.

797
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:00,565
If the anticyclone over
the Okhotsk Sea stops developing

798
00:56:00,648 --> 00:56:02,859
and water vapor continues
to flow in from the southwest,

799
00:56:02,942 --> 00:56:05,278
the anticyclone of
the North Pacific will expand.

800
00:56:05,361 --> 00:56:07,155
Then I think

801
00:56:07,238 --> 00:56:09,324
it'll definitely rain in two days.

802
00:56:21,836 --> 00:56:24,380
Let's go with
Forecaster Lee's forecast this time.

803
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:27,008
Because water vapor is flowing in
from the south.

804
00:56:28,009 --> 00:56:30,470
If you say so. Okay.

805
00:56:31,513 --> 00:56:33,515
Thank you for trusting me.

806
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:41,981
INNOVATIVE WEATHER SERVICES
A STEPPING STONE TO PUBLIC SAFETY

807
00:57:07,298 --> 00:57:11,386
THE KMA'S WEATHER FORECAST
IS WRONG AGAIN

808
00:57:19,185 --> 00:57:21,563
THE FORECAST IS WRONG AGAIN
WHAT IS THE PROBLEM?

809
00:57:33,241 --> 00:57:35,493
The KMA's forecast was wrong again.

810
00:57:35,577 --> 00:57:37,495
What's the reason?

811
00:57:37,579 --> 00:57:39,289
As global warming accelerates,

812
00:57:39,372 --> 00:57:41,875
the variables of the prediction,
including natural cycle fluctuations

813
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:44,586
such as El Niño and La Niña,
have become much more complex.

814
00:57:44,669 --> 00:57:46,504
Can you put it simply?

815
00:57:47,172 --> 00:57:48,465
It's like having to guess

816
00:57:48,548 --> 00:57:51,426
the path of a vehicle
that ignores traffic signals

817
00:57:51,509 --> 00:57:52,927
and driving lines.

818
00:57:55,847 --> 00:57:57,557
The reporters are excited.

819
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:01,060
Because there haven't been
any events or incidents lately.

820
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:03,021
Director Jin has been

821
00:58:03,104 --> 00:58:05,732
having a hard time since she got promoted.

822
00:58:06,649 --> 00:58:08,860
Nothing's going her way.

823
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:27,420
Aren't you tired?

824
00:58:30,882 --> 00:58:31,883
Let's go inside.

825
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:35,428
I'm sorry.

826
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:37,555
If I hadn't insisted,

827
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:40,850
we wouldn't have been wrong.

828
00:58:42,644 --> 00:58:44,395
You weren't wrong.

829
00:58:45,104 --> 00:58:47,315
Senior Forecaster Um
and I weren't right either.

830
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:52,153
Like you said,
weather is about variability.

831
00:58:52,737 --> 00:58:54,489
A small thing

832
00:58:54,572 --> 00:58:56,616
can change everything.

833
00:58:57,575 --> 00:58:58,785
What should we do now?

834
00:59:01,287 --> 00:59:03,456
We got it wrong, so we have to be scolded.

835
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:29,566
THE KMA'S ERRONEOUS FORECAST

836
00:59:29,649 --> 00:59:31,401
The KMA predicted that

837
00:59:31,484 --> 00:59:33,945
it would rain 50 to 100mm per hour
in Seoul, Gyeonggi,

838
00:59:34,028 --> 00:59:37,532
and Yeongseo in Gangwon Province,
starting this morning.

839
00:59:37,615 --> 00:59:41,494
However, until now,
most of the regions are only cloudy.

840
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:43,371
Thankfully, there wasn't a storm

841
00:59:43,454 --> 00:59:45,582
on the way to work,
but people are tired of the KMA's

842
00:59:45,665 --> 00:59:47,375
-erroneous forecasts.
-Bo-mi.

843
00:59:47,458 --> 00:59:49,961
I have a headache.

844
00:59:50,044 --> 00:59:51,045
Okay.

845
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:53,298
-The KMA's forecast was wrong again.
-Wait.

846
00:59:53,381 --> 00:59:54,924
What's the reason?

847
00:59:57,135 --> 00:59:58,595
As global warming accelerates,

848
00:59:58,678 --> 01:00:01,556
the variables of the prediction,
including natural cycle fluctuations

849
01:00:01,639 --> 01:00:04,809
such as El Niño and La Niña,
have become much more complex.

850
01:00:04,892 --> 01:00:06,269
It's like

851
01:00:06,352 --> 01:00:08,396
having to guess the path of a vehicle

852
01:00:08,479 --> 01:00:10,732
that ignores traffic signals
and driving lines.

853
01:00:11,482 --> 01:00:13,026
-It sounds difficult.
-Do you know her?

854
01:00:13,109 --> 01:00:15,320
-Yes.
-Aren't supercomputers

855
01:00:15,403 --> 01:00:17,363
with a huge amount of data

856
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:19,782
able to predict even such variables?

857
01:00:22,994 --> 01:00:25,413
Thank you. See you next time.

858
01:00:36,424 --> 01:00:39,385
You said that the difficulty
of weather forecasting has increased

859
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:40,928
due to the rapidly changing climate.

860
01:00:41,679 --> 01:00:43,640
Shouldn't you come up with a solution?

861
01:00:44,432 --> 01:00:46,893
So we try to use a lot of NWP model data

862
01:00:46,976 --> 01:00:49,854
to forecast with more
diverse possibilities in mind.

863
01:00:51,397 --> 01:00:53,066
So there's no clear solution?

864
01:00:54,025 --> 01:00:55,693
We'll try harder.

865
01:00:58,112 --> 01:00:59,364
Trying harder is easy.

866
01:01:00,573 --> 01:01:02,033
Doing it well is difficult.

867
01:01:03,868 --> 01:01:04,827
Are we done?

868
01:01:05,953 --> 01:01:07,914
-Yes.
-Goodbye then.

869
01:01:10,249 --> 01:01:11,959
I heard you were dating Si-woo.

870
01:01:15,963 --> 01:01:18,716
Did Ki-jun say that?
I'm sure I told him we weren't.

871
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:21,803
He's charming.

872
01:01:23,137 --> 01:01:24,931
He's innocent, yet smart.

873
01:01:25,807 --> 01:01:27,684
He has nothing to show for,

874
01:01:27,767 --> 01:01:29,394
but he has high self-esteem.

875
01:01:30,645 --> 01:01:32,689
He's really good looking too.

876
01:01:36,067 --> 01:01:37,694
May I ask you something?

877
01:01:39,987 --> 01:01:42,115
Why did you break up with him?

878
01:01:43,241 --> 01:01:46,285
Was it because of his father?

879
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:53,793
Do you think you're all that?

880
01:01:56,129 --> 01:01:57,880
Si-woo's father

881
01:01:58,631 --> 01:01:59,799
isn't a good man.

882
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:04,804
But he wasn't the reason
I broke up with Si-woo.

883
01:02:06,556 --> 01:02:07,807
Then why…

884
01:02:09,976 --> 01:02:11,269
Si-woo…

885
01:02:12,437 --> 01:02:13,771
doesn't believe in marriage.

886
01:02:16,315 --> 01:02:20,361
He doesn't want to marry anyone.

887
01:02:33,207 --> 01:02:34,167
By the way,

888
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:38,296
Ha-kyung doesn't sincerely date anyone
if they're not a marriage prospect.

889
01:02:40,298 --> 01:02:42,216
You knew that, right?

890
01:02:50,933 --> 01:02:52,226
Doors opening.

891
01:02:53,519 --> 01:02:54,771
Going up.

892
01:02:58,775 --> 01:03:00,276
Hold on.

893
01:03:00,359 --> 01:03:01,360
Sure.

894
01:03:02,361 --> 01:03:03,446
Hello.

895
01:03:12,455 --> 01:03:14,957
Like how flowers bloom in spring

896
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:18,002
and how the rainy season brings
a downpour of rain in summer,

897
01:03:18,669 --> 01:03:20,087
for me,

898
01:03:20,171 --> 01:03:22,632
marriage was a natural thing
to do when the time came.

899
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:26,469
As the climate is changing

900
01:03:26,552 --> 01:03:29,472
and the uncertainty
of weather forecasting is increasing…

901
01:03:30,223 --> 01:03:31,641
Si-woo…

902
01:03:32,809 --> 01:03:34,101
doesn't believe in marriage.

903
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:40,608
He doesn't want to marry anyone.

904
01:03:40,691 --> 01:03:44,529
…nothing can be taken for granted.

905
01:04:25,444 --> 01:04:27,738
I've never thought about a relationship

906
01:04:27,822 --> 01:04:30,116
that didn't lead to marriage.

907
01:04:30,199 --> 01:04:32,702
Who are you? My daughter lives here.

908
01:04:32,785 --> 01:04:33,995
-What?
-Hey.

909
01:04:34,078 --> 01:04:36,122
You two are living with my daughter?

910
01:04:36,205 --> 01:04:38,875
Was that man we met in the elevator

911
01:04:38,958 --> 01:04:40,835
your colleague as well?

912
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:42,503
-Thank you.
-Wait.

913
01:04:42,587 --> 01:04:43,629
Are you the eldest son?

914
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:44,672
Why do you ask?

915
01:04:44,755 --> 01:04:45,840
What's with Yeouido's current temperature?

916
01:04:45,923 --> 01:04:48,926
Remove the information
from the prevention portal site.

917
01:04:49,010 --> 01:04:51,304
The incorrect information
on the portal site.

918
01:04:51,387 --> 01:04:52,972
You told him, didn't you?

919
01:04:53,055 --> 01:04:56,267
You should have reported it
to me right away!

920
01:04:57,351 --> 01:05:02,106
