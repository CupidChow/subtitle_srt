00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:46,755
PATIENT NAME
LEE MYUNG-HAN

2
00:00:48,047 --> 00:00:50,425
An arrest warrant
has been issued for Mr. Lee

3
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:53,011
for self-inflicted injury and blackmail,
and insurance fraud.

4
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:17,702
He's in there right now.

5
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:20,038
He had a biopsy.

6
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:22,665
It's late-stage lung cancer.

7
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:26,086
They need to run
a few more tests tomorrow.

8
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:29,422
But if you must take him away today,

9
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:31,049
then go ahead.

10
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:41,100
Damn it. We're in a pickle.

11
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:45,188
Officer Kim. Go talk to his doctor.

12
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:47,982
-Ask if we can take him in right now.
-Yes, sir.

13
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:54,197
ULTRASOUND ROOM

14
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:57,867
Ms. Chae Yu-jin's guardian?

15
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,577
-Yes?
-Please come in.

16
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:00,703
Okay.

17
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:05,333
Let's see. It's called Braxton Hicks.

18
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:07,585
The womb is expanding.

19
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:10,964
It's a common symptom
during early pregnancy.

20
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:12,674
Thankfully…

21
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,260
the baby's healthy.

22
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:21,266
Hold on.

23
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:24,269
I'll let you hear your baby's heartbeat.

24
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:57,510
There comes a time when a simple problem

25
00:02:57,594 --> 00:03:00,430
unexpectedly becomes
the most difficult one.

26
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,573
When you are caught
between a rock and a hard place,

27
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:20,992
and you can neither go forward

28
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:23,536
nor go back.

29
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:40,762
The police have left.

30
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:42,972
He needs to take a few more tests,

31
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:46,226
so the doctor denied his discharge.

32
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:51,272
So…

33
00:03:52,148 --> 00:03:54,943
Did you get to talk with your father?

34
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:01,407
Si-woo, are you crying?

35
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,330
Stop it. Don't comfort me.

36
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,753
We only agreed to pretend
like we were dating at work.

37
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,758
You don't need to care about me now,

38
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:20,969
Director Jin.

39
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:32,021
Even when we don't know what to do

40
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:36,317
or can't tell right from wrong,

41
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:39,320
we must make decisions.

42
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,864
We must decide what is right

43
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:45,535
and what the answers to life are.

44
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:47,954
THIS SPRING

45
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:49,080
Here.

46
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:52,625
How's work going?

47
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,878
What's your secret, sir?

48
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:59,340
What? What secret?

49
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:02,969
You have the top accuracy rate
in forecasting in this entire country.

50
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:04,804
And no one has broken your record.

51
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:09,767
How did you become
the living legend of the KMA?

52
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:11,352
Right.

53
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:13,563
So try harder, Director Jin.

54
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:18,359
That record is so old,
yet no one has beaten it. Jeez.

55
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:20,695
Exactly. So please let me in on

56
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:23,364
how you always got the right answers.

57
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:24,407
Please?

58
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,535
What could it be? Are you curious?

59
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:30,496
Yes. I'm dying of curiosity.

60
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,873
Please tell me, sir.

61
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:34,751
All right, then.

62
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:36,627
Find out who has

63
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:39,047
the lowest accuracy rate
in the entire KMA.

64
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:40,715
What?

65
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,011
Then you'll know the secret.

66
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:46,137
Okay?

67
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:57,023
EPISODE 16
TOMORROW'S ANSWERS

68
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:59,067
FINALE

69
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:17,502
You're late.

70
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:21,464
Yes. The forecast suddenly changed,

71
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:24,759
so I had to take care of some things.

72
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:29,680
I'm sorry.

73
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:35,061
You must be tired. Get some rest.

74
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,271
Hyang-rae.

75
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:42,735
What?

76
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:46,405
Should we just get divorced?

77
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:49,200
What?

78
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,538
I thought about it
long and hard on my way home.

79
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,875
It was unbelievable
that Bo-mi's birthday wish

80
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:02,088
was just for us to go out for dinner.

81
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:08,928
But I felt so pathetic
for not even being able to give her that.

82
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:15,268
I think I'm a lost cause.

83
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:40,668
Tell me.

84
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:46,257
-What do your parents do?
-Sorry?

85
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:48,342
There you go again.

86
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:53,055
They've been teaching all their lives.

87
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:55,725
My father was
a high school physics teacher,

88
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,351
and he retired two years ago.

89
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:59,896
And my mother is
an elementary school vice-principal.

90
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:03,316
I see. They're both educators.

91
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:05,443
Then what about you?

92
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:07,528
Which university did you go to?

93
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:09,614
I studied physics at Hanguk University.

94
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,825
You went to the same school as Ha-kyung.

95
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:14,952
Yes. I'm seven years her senior.

96
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:19,582
Then who owns this place--

97
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:20,833
It's mine.

98
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:23,294
I did take out a loan,

99
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:26,088
but it's registered under my name.

100
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:32,136
You have a decent job and a house.
Then you're all ready.

101
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,679
You just need to get married.

102
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:36,849
-Sorry?
-Mom. Stop getting ahead of yourself.

103
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:40,019
Can you please stop? You're scaring him.

104
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:41,812
No, she's not.

105
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:45,066
I'm sorry. Don't feel pressured.
It's a bad habit of hers.

106
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:47,276
She always brings up marriage
out of nowhere.

107
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:49,779
That's why Ha-kyung moved out.

108
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:54,534
Aren't you guys dating
with marriage in mind?

109
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:55,910
-Yes.
-No.

110
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:03,417
I thought we were.

111
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:07,171
Are we dating with marriage in mind?

112
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:13,094
Then why did you sleep with me?

113
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:17,014
That's a natural thing to do
when two people like each other.

114
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:21,894
But we did more than just sleep together.

115
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:23,271
Right?

116
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:26,023
I'm sure that you and I

117
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:28,776
had a strong bond. Right?

118
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:30,069
Also…

119
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:34,865
While making love to each other,
we felt each other's passionate love.

120
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,951
Hold on. Hey.

121
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:40,454
How about you talk
about such things in private?

122
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:41,622
You see…

123
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:44,959
It was my first time.

124
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:46,669
So…

125
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:50,715
You, Jin Tae-kyung, were my
first love and sexual encounter.

126
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:53,509
So what?

127
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,177
Do I need to take responsibility?

128
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:56,721
Goodness, I'm leaving.

129
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:59,140
Don't tell me you were toying with me.

130
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:00,683
Don't be ridiculous!

131
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:02,184
I'm not that type!

132
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,353
Then how could you sleep with me
without marriage in mind?

133
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:05,605
Because I liked you.

134
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:08,482
That's why we began dating
and ended up sleeping together!

135
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:09,400
Unbelievable.

136
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:11,569
I thought your feelings were genuine.

137
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:12,945
They are.

138
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:15,781
-But you don't want to get married.
-That's true too!

139
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,033
How does that…

140
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:19,368
Unbelievable.

141
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:29,670
The cold wind is lowering
the temperature even further.

142
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,672
Currently, Seoul is at 3°C,

143
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:35,134
but the sensible temperature
is still in the sub-zero levels.

144
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:37,887
But it will rise above zero
by tomorrow morning,

145
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,889
and the weather will be cozy again.

146
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:48,189
Yu-jin.

147
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:50,691
-Yes?
-I finally remembered.

148
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:52,360
Remembered what?

149
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:55,237
The moment I first fell in love with you.

150
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:04,705
Excuse me.

151
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:07,083
What does "temperature-dense area" mean?

152
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:10,211
During your briefing, you said

153
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:13,589
the heat was flowing to the west coast,
a temperature-dense area.

154
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:17,301
It's an area where
the isothermal lines are concentrated.

155
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:19,804
Oh, I see.

156
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:25,226
Then can you also explain how
the vertical structure of temperature

157
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:27,269
is connected to liquid water equivalent?

158
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,814
I couldn't find it on the Internet.

159
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:32,525
The former has details

160
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:36,320
such as the vertical distribution
of temperature and humidity…

161
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:38,364
What?

162
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:42,034
You decided to marry me
because I seemed ignorant?

163
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:43,661
No.

164
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:44,870
Then?

165
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:47,123
It was because of the way
you looked at me.

166
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:55,005
We can predict
whether water drops will form or not.

167
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:57,133
We can also predict

168
00:11:57,216 --> 00:12:00,136
if small water droplets
or snow could increase in size…

169
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:07,226
The way you looked at me…

170
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:13,524
made me feel like
I could do anything with you by my side.

171
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:21,657
You made me feel like

172
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:25,202
I was a pretty decent guy.

173
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:29,498
Because that's how I perceived you.

174
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:34,336
"This man knows everything."

175
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,299
"He's an expert in his line of work."

176
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:42,470
"Yet he doesn't look down on me
for being ignorant."

177
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:43,929
"How respectable."

178
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:47,808
That's how I felt.

179
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:52,897
Would it be possible for you

180
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,775
to trust me with that mindset now?

181
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:02,490
This isn't about trust.
It's about being realistic.

182
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:05,326
I heard raising a baby is no joke.

183
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:07,661
I know.

184
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:10,623
I've been searching online every day.

185
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:14,418
-And it requires a lot of money.
-I'm aware of that too.

186
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:16,837
But that doesn't only pertain to us.

187
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:18,923
Everyone else faces the same difficulties.

188
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:21,842
But that doesn't stop them
from having babies.

189
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:23,719
I'm confident that we can do it too.

190
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,681
To be honest,

191
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:31,936
my heart almost burst when I heard

192
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:34,522
our baby's heartbeat yesterday.

193
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:39,860
It was the first time
our baby talked to us.

194
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:43,781
"I'm here."

195
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,158
"I'm alive."

196
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:52,039
And I replied in my heart.

197
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,377
"I hear you, my baby."

198
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:58,337
"Hi."

199
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:01,882
"I'm your dad."

200
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:17,648
Yu-jin.

201
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,942
I'll try to do better

202
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:22,861
for you and our baby.

203
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:27,116
Okay?

204
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:39,795
Thank you.

205
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,430
I love you.

206
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,893
Me too, Yu-jin.

207
00:14:58,397 --> 00:14:59,732
I love you too.

208
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:14,997
I'm a dad. I'm the man of the house.

209
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,666
Come to your senses. Brace yourself.

210
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:22,713
PENSION CREDIT APPLICATION FORM
FOR CIVIL SERVANTS

211
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:26,383
-Will you be okay?
-What do you mean?

212
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:30,679
Since pension credit is when you use
your pension money in advance,

213
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,806
not many people apply for it.

214
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:37,061
I'm a dad. I'm the man of the house.

215
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:39,897
Come to your senses. Brace yourself.

216
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:42,358
My wife is pregnant.

217
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:45,611
We need to move
and get ready for the new baby.

218
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:48,280
But I already took out
my maximum limit for our wedding.

219
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:50,616
Oh, I see.

220
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:51,700
That's right.

221
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:56,622
You can print out the application form
by going to the website

222
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:58,165
written on that page.

223
00:15:58,248 --> 00:16:01,460
Feel free to ask me questions
or for help if you need anything.

224
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:02,628
Okay.

225
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:04,088
You can do it.

226
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:07,007
Okay. I can do it. Thank you.

227
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,680
LOAN POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

228
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:26,568
Is Forecaster Lee getting married?

229
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:28,070
Why do you ask?

230
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:30,698
He inquired about
taking out a housing loan.

231
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:32,950
-Don't you think it's for marriage?
-No way.

232
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:35,077
Is he going to marry
Director Jin after all?

233
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,788
I guess so. It's a bit sudden, right?

234
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:41,875
Do you think she got pregnant?

235
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:44,169
Hey, that makes sense.

236
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:45,713
Right?

237
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:47,631
I can't believe it!

238
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:49,508
What? She's pregnant?

239
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,136
People in the
General Affairs Team said so.

240
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:54,054
Come on. That can't be.

241
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:59,268
One iced Americano…

242
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:02,438
-Never mind. One citron tea, please.
-Okay.

243
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:05,441
-Director Jin.
-Hello.

244
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:08,277
No coffee today?

245
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:11,071
I wanted to try the special menu today.

246
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,157
Right. That makes sense.

247
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,951
Citron tea has a lot of vitamins
and you probably need them.

248
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:18,912
-Here's your citron tea.
-Thank you.

249
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,457
-I'll get going then.
-Goodbye.

250
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:26,754
She's already watching
what she's consuming.

251
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:30,174
You shouldn't have caffeine
when you're pregnant.

252
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:31,091
Right?

253
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:33,469
Come on. You don't know for sure,

254
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:35,637
so don't spread this rumor.

255
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:36,972
-Okay.
-Goodbye.

256
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:43,562
Did you hear?

257
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:11,882
-Hello!
-Hello!

258
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:15,719
These newbies will be receiving
the in-service training.

259
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:17,971
They'll be sitting in
for the morning meeting.

260
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:20,099
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

261
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:22,184
-Welcome.
-Nice to meet you.

262
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:24,394
They're so young. It's nice to meet you.

263
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:27,523
-Let's not disturb them. That way.
-Okay.

264
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:32,820
I was also like them once.

265
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,447
What? Do you miss those days?

266
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:38,575
I was so excited

267
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:40,828
and thought I'd do something important.

268
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:43,622
Are you disappointed now?

269
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:45,958
Well…

270
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,418
I can't deny it.

271
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:50,212
I always make mistakes

272
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:51,755
no matter how hard I try.

273
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,007
If it's that hard for you,

274
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:56,885
find a new position
while you have the opportunity.

275
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,223
What do you mean?

276
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:04,309
I heard about it.

277
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:06,103
The Policy Division wants you, right?

278
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:09,231
Assistant Director Oh…

279
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:11,984
Of course, I'd love you to stay.

280
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:14,778
But I, of all people, know very well

281
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:18,115
how arduous this position is.

282
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:19,575
We always spend all-nighters

283
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:22,035
and still get criticized
even when we do our best.

284
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:25,205
So how could I ask you to stay?

285
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:30,502
Think simply.

286
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:32,963
Follow your heart.

287
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:34,006
Okay?

288
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:51,398
Mr. Lee, let me change your IV fluids.

289
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:59,406
We predict that it will grow stronger
as it crosses the sea

290
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:02,951
and affect the southern part
of Korea the most.

291
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:06,079
Over the weekend, the rain will likely
start in the South Chungcheong Province

292
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:09,041
and spread to other parts
with a rainfall of 5mm or less.

293
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:11,251
Please monitor the surface temperature

294
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:14,755
and relative humidity of these areas.
We'll end the meeting here.

295
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:17,007
Good work.

296
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:19,509
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

297
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:27,601
Director Jin.

298
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:30,354
-Congratulations.
-Sorry?

299
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:31,813
For what?

300
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,775
-You have good news, right?
-Good news?

301
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:37,027
You can't fool me.

302
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:39,404
-I heard you're getting married soon.
-Really?

303
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:41,782
Gosh, are we finally
attending your wedding?

304
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:44,159
Are we, Director Jin?

305
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,495
He'll eat a lot at your wedding.

306
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:53,877
Hold on. Are you talking about me?

307
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:56,964
My father isn't there?

308
00:20:57,047 --> 00:21:01,134
No. He wasn't in his bed,
so we looked everywhere else.

309
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:03,262
But I don't think he's at the hospital.

310
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:04,388
Did he not call you?

311
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:05,889
No.

312
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:10,769
I understand.
I'll look for him and call you back.

313
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:18,235
FATHER

314
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:24,199
The person you are
trying to reach is unavailable…

315
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:32,499
What? People in General Affairs said that?

316
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:36,628
Yes. Forecaster Lee inquired
about taking out a housing loan.

317
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:41,091
What does that have to do
with my getting married?

318
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:42,801
Hey.

319
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:45,595
A guy is taking out a housing loan,

320
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,473
and it happens to be Lee Si-woo
who's dating Director Jin.

321
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:50,225
You can easily put two and two together.

322
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:52,686
Still…

323
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:56,023
But why would he take out a housing loan?

324
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:08,410
Where is Forecaster Lee?

325
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:10,162
He left while calling someone.

326
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,414
By the way,

327
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:16,001
are you really doing it?

328
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:18,378
Doing what?

329
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:19,671
Getting married.

330
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:22,841
That's a false rumor.

331
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:24,926
Does that mean

332
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:27,054
you're not pregnant?

333
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:28,805
What are you talking about?

334
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:31,141
We're suddenly hearing rumors of marriage.

335
00:22:31,224 --> 00:22:32,434
A shotgun wedding at that.

336
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:36,354
And I saw you drink citron tea
instead of coffee, so…

337
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:38,482
What?

338
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:42,736
Assistant Director Oh.

339
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:45,030
I'm not pregnant.

340
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:49,451
And his taking out a housing loan
has nothing to do with my getting married.

341
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:53,080
So I hope you don't get the wrong idea.

342
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:57,584
Also…

343
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:00,754
I'll be honest.

344
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:02,881
He and I

345
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:05,467
broke up.

346
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:12,974
We had already broken up
during the last typhoon.

347
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:15,268
We didn't want people to talk about us,

348
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:17,729
so we agreed
to pretend like we were still dating.

349
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:18,855
But…

350
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:22,859
I don't think I can do it anymore.

351
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:26,571
We broke up already.

352
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:30,492
I'm sorry for deceiving you all.

353
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:48,510
Did you hear that?

354
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:50,804
Yes.

355
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,723
Okay. Let's stop doing this.

356
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:11,283
They've parted ways too.

357
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:18,748
PETITION FOR DIVORCE

358
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:28,508
You don't need to see this.

359
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:31,428
Mom, are you seriously getting a divorce?

360
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:34,222
That's what he wants.

361
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:36,391
You said you'd give him two months.

362
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:38,018
Are you not going to?

363
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:40,353
He wants a divorce.

364
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:41,646
What about you?

365
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:44,065
Do you want it?

366
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:52,908
Then what about me?

367
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:56,494
Why aren't you asking me anything?

368
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:01,625
-What do you mean?
-I'm a part of this family too.

369
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:05,170
Shouldn't I have a say in your divorce?

370
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:06,504
You told me to do it.

371
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:08,798
You said I could get a divorce
if I wanted to.

372
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:11,259
That was before I knew
what kind of person he was.

373
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:12,969
What?

374
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:15,055
I've changed my mind now.

375
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:19,226
I want to continue living with him.

376
00:25:20,393 --> 00:25:21,811
So please.

377
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:23,855
Can you change your mind too?

378
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:28,568
Do you hate him that much?
Are you disgusted by him?

379
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:33,698
Shouldn't you go to the academy?
You're running late.

380
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,999
This is our matter.
We will decide for ourselves.

381
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:45,585
Mom.

382
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:48,421
Eat up and go.

383
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:55,804
Bo-mi, you should still eat.

384
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:57,180
You'll be hungry.

385
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:11,611
I'm so sick of this.

386
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:18,618
Director Jin, I heard some good news.

387
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:20,912
No, I'm not getting married.

388
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:22,080
We broke up.

389
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:26,084
Director Jin.

390
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:28,169
I'm not getting married. We broke up.

391
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:31,381
She said she's not.

392
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:39,431
Office romance will be the death of me.

393
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:48,356
-I want to eat alone.
-I have something to brag about.

394
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:51,359
Hey, can you please read the room?

395
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:56,656
What is this?

396
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,950
It's my baby's heartbeat.

397
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:00,952
Hey.

398
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:04,414
It was my first time meeting the baby.

399
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,376
Is it normally this loud?

400
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,919
Right? It's loud, right?

401
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:14,716
Ki-jun.

402
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:20,930
Why did you have to do that?

403
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:22,974
Do what?

404
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:26,311
You didn't have
to discredit him in front of everyone.

405
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:29,272
I didn't discredit him.

406
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:31,608
We had broken up during the typhoon.

407
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:33,318
Are you sure?

408
00:27:33,401 --> 00:27:34,402
What do you mean?

409
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:37,989
Maybe he agreed
to pretend like you two were still dating

410
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:40,492
because he couldn't break up with you.

411
00:27:41,659 --> 00:27:43,036
It's lame,

412
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:45,622
but maybe he was that desperate.

413
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:49,542
-That's enough.
-Forecaster Lee…

414
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:53,171
still likes you a lot.

415
00:27:58,635 --> 00:28:00,303
-Let's eat.
-I know you do too.

416
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:06,393
You still can't get him out of your head.

417
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:15,944
Ki-jun.

418
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:17,737
Let today just be about you.

419
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:19,489
Don't butt into my love life.

420
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:22,283
I may have been a terrible boyfriend,

421
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:24,994
but I don't want to be
an awful friend as well.

422
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:27,247
So…

423
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:30,458
I'm only saying this
as a friend who deeply cares about you.

424
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:32,919
Don't let Si-woo go.

425
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:37,090
Not for him

426
00:28:38,007 --> 00:28:39,217
but for yourself.

427
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:42,429
I learned

428
00:28:43,596 --> 00:28:46,474
that you shouldn't let go
of someone you love that easily.

429
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:55,608
MOTEL
KARAOKE

430
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:13,585
IMI MOTEL

431
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:17,839
Well…

432
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:21,259
Did he come by?
I don't think he was here today.

433
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,928
Okay. Thank you.

434
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:25,722
Okay. Goodbye.

435
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:28,224
Today's just not my day.

436
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:29,517
Who's next?

437
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:31,019
Excuse me.

438
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:45,450
-He took the afternoon off?
-Yes.

439
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:47,869
It seemed like an urgent family matter.

440
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:51,581
He asked me to tell you this and left.

441
00:29:51,664 --> 00:29:54,083
He also asked
the forecaster of Chief Team One

442
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:55,919
to come out early.

443
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:57,253
He was in a rush.

444
00:29:57,337 --> 00:30:00,298
Do you not know what this is about?

445
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:14,854
We think Mr. Lee
left the hospital this morning.

446
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:17,649
What? He left without telling anyone?

447
00:30:17,732 --> 00:30:19,943
We called his son earlier.

448
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:21,277
Did he not tell you?

449
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:25,532
Okay, I understand.

450
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:51,766
The person you are
trying to reach is unavailable.

451
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:56,229
You will be connected to voicemail.
Please leave a message after the tone.

452
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:06,781
Goodness.

453
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:10,076
How could napa cabbage be this expensive?

454
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:13,037
Everything's so expensive.
I can't buy much with--

455
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:14,831
Oh, no. That's my bus.

456
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:27,719
Isn't that…

457
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:36,185
FATHER

458
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:41,733
Father.

459
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:45,111
Where are you?

460
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:47,989
Answer me!

461
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:55,705
You're going to make
my ears bleed, you punk.

462
00:31:58,082 --> 00:31:59,584
Where are you?

463
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:01,794
That's none of your business.

464
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:04,422
Then why did you call?

465
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:06,257
Because I had something to tell you.

466
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:12,180
I just can't stop thinking about
how great of a catch that director is.

467
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:15,934
So stop playing hard to get

468
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:18,728
and get back together with her.

469
00:32:18,811 --> 00:32:19,896
Got that?

470
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:21,814
You idiot.

471
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:24,901
Do you think you'll ever
meet someone like her again?

472
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:30,365
You may not have a great father,

473
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:32,617
but you indeed had a great woman.

474
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:37,080
Father.

475
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:39,457
Where are you?

476
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:42,585
The doctor said
he needed to run a few more tests.

477
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:46,130
Once the results come out,
we'll know if you can receive surgery.

478
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:49,217
-Get chemo and treatment--
-Don't bother.

479
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:52,345
I've always been a terrible father.

480
00:32:52,428 --> 00:32:54,138
Exactly!

481
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:58,559
You should change your ways
for me before you die.

482
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:03,606
If you have an ounce of conscience,

483
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:06,442
you should try to leave
some good memories for me.

484
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:09,028
You see…

485
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:12,740
I'm going to do everything I can for you

486
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:15,910
and not cry when you pass away.

487
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:17,745
So please.

488
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:20,790
Stay with me…

489
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:25,795
until the day you die.

490
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:29,340
Please try to be

491
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:33,469
a good father until then.

492
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:36,681
You punk.

493
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:40,309
Do you want me to die?

494
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:55,074
Damn it.

495
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:01,622
Hey.

496
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:05,376
I know I may be shameless,
but I still can't do that to you.

497
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:10,631
I do have a conscience.
Don't underestimate me.

498
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:13,009
Father.

499
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:18,681
Forget it. Stop talking nonsense

500
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:20,808
and get back with that director.

501
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:26,105
That's my dying wish.

502
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:46,584
That idiot.

503
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:48,044
It's late-stage lung cancer.

504
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:51,923
They need to run
a few more tests tomorrow.

505
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:53,883
But if you must take him away today,

506
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:55,510
then go ahead.

507
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:14,320
I'm sorry.

508
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:46,644
The person you are
trying to reach is unavailable.

509
00:35:46,727 --> 00:35:48,563
Please leave a message after the tone.

510
00:36:26,058 --> 00:36:27,059
Jeez.

511
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,478
What's going on?

512
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:32,940
You wanted to talk.

513
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:36,485
Have you been drinking already?

514
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:43,659
What's wrong?

515
00:36:44,493 --> 00:36:46,245
I was rejected.

516
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:49,498
What do you mean? By whom?

517
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:52,126
By the publisher.

518
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,462
They don't like my manuscript.

519
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:56,339
They refused to publish it.

520
00:36:58,049 --> 00:36:59,675
What? Why?

521
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:02,303
Why? What was their reason?

522
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:03,387
What was it?

523
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:06,390
They said the same thing you said.

524
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:07,767
What I said?

525
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:11,437
What did they say to you?

526
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,731
They said it lacked a hooking point.

527
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:19,737
They said readers wouldn't choose a book

528
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:22,698
that had no hooking point.

529
00:37:28,871 --> 00:37:30,081
That's why I'm thinking…

530
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:32,833
about giving up.

531
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:35,169
On what?

532
00:37:37,129 --> 00:37:39,924
-On being a children's book author.
-That's absurd.

533
00:37:40,549 --> 00:37:42,927
They're not the only publisher in Korea.

534
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:45,471
Actually, they are.

535
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:48,015
I was rejected by all the others.

536
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:52,270
That publisher was the only one
that wanted to publish my book.

537
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:54,814
And I was rejected by them as well.

538
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:59,151
I can't believe them.

539
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:02,446
Come on.

540
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:04,407
That's no reason to give up.

541
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:08,286
I'm sorry, Seok-ho.

542
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:11,914
This is the best I can do.

543
00:38:12,915 --> 00:38:14,625
I was always

544
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:17,545
a boring daughter.

545
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:21,674
And that's why my marriage got called off.

546
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:25,094
No. I won't be like that.

547
00:38:25,177 --> 00:38:28,681
-Okay? I will never--
-No, you will.

548
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,477
I never reap good results.

549
00:38:34,353 --> 00:38:36,105
That's how I am.

550
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:43,779
Even this relationship won't end well.

551
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:53,873
What are you saying, Tae-kyung?

552
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:04,800
I want to break up.

553
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,924
Here. Have a seat.

554
00:39:57,812 --> 00:40:00,189
Look at your home sweet home.

555
00:40:01,982 --> 00:40:03,359
What brings you here?

556
00:40:06,987 --> 00:40:10,825
I brought some underwear, socks,
and a few clothes for you to change into.

557
00:40:13,452 --> 00:40:15,371
Do you know how awful you are?

558
00:40:16,288 --> 00:40:17,540
No.

559
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:19,417
You're just an idiot.

560
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:22,837
What do you mean?

561
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,256
You wanted three months.

562
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:27,842
You were the one
who asked me for some time.

563
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:29,301
Then after just a month,

564
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:31,929
you hand me the divorce papers
and move out?

565
00:40:32,888 --> 00:40:34,849
Then why did you even bother

566
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:37,226
to try to become a dad
and the man of the house?

567
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:41,772
That's because I couldn't help
but think that I was a lost cause.

568
00:40:43,232 --> 00:40:45,526
I didn't think it was right
to keep tormenting you.

569
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:47,695
That's why.

570
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:49,238
You have no loyalty.

571
00:40:50,739 --> 00:40:54,118
Come on. When it came to you,

572
00:40:54,201 --> 00:40:56,245
I was always faithful.

573
00:40:56,328 --> 00:40:57,872
But you have no loyalty to our family.

574
00:40:57,955 --> 00:40:59,999
-That's because--
-Fine.

575
00:41:00,082 --> 00:41:02,460
I intentionally went a bit far with this.

576
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:05,421
I thought mentioning a divorce
would make you come to your senses.

577
00:41:05,504 --> 00:41:07,548
But how could you
really say yes and leave?

578
00:41:08,215 --> 00:41:09,925
Are you even a man?

579
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:13,095
What about me who remained
faithful to you all these years?

580
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:15,139
And what about Bo-mi who just began

581
00:41:15,222 --> 00:41:16,974
to understand and open up to you?

582
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:19,101
Why did you sound so confident

583
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:21,687
in front of her
if you were going to give up so easily?

584
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:25,691
What about her?

585
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:28,819
Forget about us.

586
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,321
What about Bo-mi?

587
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:39,497
You're a coward. Do you know that?

588
00:41:40,372 --> 00:41:42,291
Hyang-rae, I--

589
00:41:42,374 --> 00:41:44,585
Who cares if you can read the weather well

590
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:47,046
when you can't do the same
for your family?

591
00:41:47,129 --> 00:41:48,380
I'm sorry.

592
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:51,050
I'm truly sorry, Hyang-rae.

593
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:53,677
I don't want to hear it.
I'm sick of hearing you apologize.

594
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:57,848
Then what else can I say?

595
00:41:57,932 --> 00:42:01,310
What do you want me to do?
All I can say is that I'm sorry.

596
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:02,853
"Thank you."

597
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:07,691
"Thank you for waiting for me."

598
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:09,735
"Thank you for being patient with me."

599
00:42:09,818 --> 00:42:12,738
You may have never been there
for your daughter's birthday,

600
00:42:12,821 --> 00:42:15,324
but you could have thanked her
for being so excited

601
00:42:15,407 --> 00:42:18,702
about eating at a popular restaurant
you reserved for her.

602
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:26,001
Why are you such an idiot?

603
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:28,045
How are you this dense?

604
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:33,300
I'm sorry.

605
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:35,344
I really am.

606
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:42,726
Thank you, Hyang-rae.

607
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,273
I truly mean that.

608
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,692
Thank you.

609
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:58,826
INNOVATIVE WEATHER SERVICES
A STEPPING STONE TO PUBLIC SAFETY

610
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:04,415
Here's the rainfall data.

611
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:08,752
There's a possibility

612
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:11,297
of a 5mm rainfall
tomorrow morning as we predicted.

613
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:13,215
We'll add that to our weekend forecast.

614
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:15,342
-Okay.
-Wait.

615
00:43:16,051 --> 00:43:18,887
The surface temperature
this morning dropped to 3°C.

616
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:20,347
I don't think it'll rain.

617
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:22,391
At this rate,

618
00:43:22,474 --> 00:43:25,936
there's a 50-percent chance
that the temperature will drop to 1°C

619
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,187
by tonight--

620
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:30,107
Then there's an 80-percent chance
that it'll snow instead.

621
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:31,400
Correct.

622
00:43:31,483 --> 00:43:32,776
What he said makes sense.

623
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:36,989
What if we re-analyzed the precipitation

624
00:43:37,072 --> 00:43:39,992
to determine the amount of snow
through liquid water equivalent?

625
00:43:40,075 --> 00:43:41,285
How long would that take?

626
00:43:41,368 --> 00:43:42,953
An hour will be enough.

627
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:45,706
-Please do that right now.
-Yes, ma'am.

628
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:49,585
She's amazing.

629
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:56,258
She's incredible.

630
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:01,680
Is that so?

631
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:03,849
Okay.

632
00:44:06,268 --> 00:44:08,854
Ki-jun, what is it this time?

633
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:11,357
Instead of rain this weekend,

634
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,192
we could have sleet or snow.

635
00:44:13,942 --> 00:44:15,319
Stay alert.

636
00:44:15,861 --> 00:44:18,364
This feels ominous.

637
00:44:22,034 --> 00:44:23,077
Oh, dear.

638
00:44:23,702 --> 00:44:26,497
There's a 50-percent chance
of either snow or rain?

639
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:28,540
-Half?
-Yes, sir.

640
00:44:29,124 --> 00:44:30,876
I see. Jeez.

641
00:44:30,959 --> 00:44:33,879
A similar incident occurred before
and caused a commotion, right?

642
00:44:33,962 --> 00:44:38,008
Yes, sir. In December of 2001,
we predicted heavy snow in the evening

643
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:39,760
based on similar circumstances.

644
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:42,388
But the unexpectedly high temperature
made it rain instead.

645
00:44:42,471 --> 00:44:44,973
We were criticized
for excessive forecasting

646
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:46,517
and received a national inspection.

647
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:48,769
Listen up.

648
00:44:49,269 --> 00:44:51,772
If it snows,
it'll be the first snow of the season.

649
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:54,900
Okay? You know everyone
as well as the media

650
00:44:54,983 --> 00:44:56,318
are sensitive to that, right?

651
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:57,277
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

652
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:58,570
Excuse me.

653
00:44:59,154 --> 00:45:00,322
The first snow already came.

654
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:02,658
I saw it on my way to work two days ago.

655
00:45:02,741 --> 00:45:04,493
It was snowing in our neighborhood.

656
00:45:04,576 --> 00:45:05,994
Ours too.

657
00:45:06,912 --> 00:45:08,997
Jeez. Someone explain it to him.

658
00:45:09,706 --> 00:45:10,999
-Ms. Kim?
-Yes?

659
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:13,460
Can you explain
what we consider "first snow"?

660
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:14,670
Right.

661
00:45:15,671 --> 00:45:16,755
Yes, ma'am.

662
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:21,635
There is a criteria for first snow.

663
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:24,054
It's determined by the values

664
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:26,306
given by the observatories
throughout Korea.

665
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:28,267
For example, a worker stationed

666
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:30,561
at the Seoul Observatory in Songwol-dong

667
00:45:30,644 --> 00:45:34,314
must witness the snow themselves
for it to be considered the first snow.

668
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:37,526
Do you understand?

669
00:45:37,609 --> 00:45:39,069
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

670
00:45:39,987 --> 00:45:41,738
Isn't the Chief Team the best?

671
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:44,116
I wish I could work here.

672
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:46,702
I heard only the elites come here.

673
00:45:47,327 --> 00:45:49,955
Do you get it now?
The newbie training ends here.

674
00:45:50,038 --> 00:45:52,124
Okay? Let's get back to it.

675
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:55,294
Director Jin,
what are your final thoughts?

676
00:45:57,045 --> 00:45:58,714
It's definitely going to snow.

677
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:02,134
If we assume that
the relative humidity is 80 percent

678
00:46:02,217 --> 00:46:03,760
and the temperature is 3°C,

679
00:46:04,344 --> 00:46:07,222
there's only
a 20-percent chance that it will snow.

680
00:46:07,306 --> 00:46:08,891
But if it drops by one or two degrees,

681
00:46:08,974 --> 00:46:11,059
the percentage can soar up to 77 percent.

682
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:14,104
And given the current situation,
there's a 50-percent chance

683
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:18,442
that the surface temperature
will drop to 1°C in the next two days.

684
00:46:18,525 --> 00:46:20,569
Right, but it was sub-zero
for the past three days

685
00:46:20,652 --> 00:46:23,447
then rose up to 6°C today.
I'm sure you all know this.

686
00:46:24,072 --> 00:46:26,700
But the air completely changed
after midnight.

687
00:46:26,783 --> 00:46:28,952
There's less than a 50-percent chance

688
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:30,787
that the temperature will drop to 1°C.

689
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:34,041
Can't you see
that the atmosphere is unstable?

690
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:37,044
The surface temperature
will plummet even more tonight.

691
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:43,926
Here's the result
of the liquid water equivalent analysis.

692
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:49,139
LIQUID WATER EQUIVALENT ANALYSIS

693
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:55,896
All right.

694
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,648
Director Jin.

695
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:00,484
What will you do?

696
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:08,408
Tell me, sir.

697
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:09,451
Tell you what?

698
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:12,454
Who has the lowest accuracy rate
in the entire KMA?

699
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:16,917
Are you serious?

700
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:19,419
Were you still looking for that person?

701
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:21,463
I'm really curious

702
00:47:21,547 --> 00:47:23,382
about how you acquired

703
00:47:23,465 --> 00:47:26,009
the top accuracy rate in forecasting.

704
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:30,055
But no matter how hard I searched,
there was no forecasting record.

705
00:47:31,306 --> 00:47:33,225
Of course, there wouldn't be.

706
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:35,686
Are you that curious?

707
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:38,647
Yes. I'm dying of curiosity.
Please tell me.

708
00:47:41,733 --> 00:47:43,777
-It's me.
-What?

709
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:45,404
Me.

710
00:47:45,487 --> 00:47:49,366
That can't be.
You have the top accuracy rate.

711
00:47:50,617 --> 00:47:51,618
That's true too.

712
00:47:53,662 --> 00:47:54,746
Yes.

713
00:47:55,622 --> 00:47:57,165
I realized

714
00:47:57,708 --> 00:47:59,418
that you learn more

715
00:47:59,918 --> 00:48:03,630
when you get things wrong
rather than when you get them right.

716
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:09,094
After making countless mistakes
and learning from them,

717
00:48:09,177 --> 00:48:11,388
I could finally see the answers.

718
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:15,434
That's how my accuracy rate rose.

719
00:48:16,768 --> 00:48:17,769
Do you understand?

720
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:21,773
All right. So the secret
to having the top accuracy rate

721
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:25,235
isn't about how you get the right answers.

722
00:48:25,777 --> 00:48:28,071
It's about how often you make mistakes.

723
00:48:30,365 --> 00:48:33,452
Then weren't you disappointed
in yourself every time you were wrong?

724
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:36,997
Of course. But no one cared about that.

725
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:40,208
Then how did you overcome it?

726
00:48:41,501 --> 00:48:43,670
I didn't. I just endured it.

727
00:48:44,921 --> 00:48:47,591
I respected my decisions.

728
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:50,552
Because I knew I did my utmost best

729
00:48:51,178 --> 00:48:53,680
during my moments of decision.

730
00:48:58,268 --> 00:48:59,353
Director Jin.

731
00:48:59,853 --> 00:49:01,438
What's your decision?

732
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:11,990
My decision is as follows.

733
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:15,369
It will snow after midnight.

734
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:19,039
It will start snowing
in the metropolitan and western areas.

735
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:22,459
There will be three to five centimeters
of snow in the central region.

736
00:49:22,542 --> 00:49:25,712
We went through so much
just to get those few lines out.

737
00:49:26,421 --> 00:49:28,507
I believe it was meaningful.

738
00:49:30,592 --> 00:49:33,303
Right. When will the Policy Division
announce new transfers?

739
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:37,933
I'm not sure.
It's none of my business anymore.

740
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:40,686
What do you mean?

741
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:42,688
Weren't you going to transfer there?

742
00:49:43,522 --> 00:49:45,691
I did want to at first,

743
00:49:45,774 --> 00:49:47,734
but it sounded like such a waste.

744
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:51,363
I just couldn't let the time and effort
I put into this team go to waste.

745
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:54,950
So you've decided to stay?

746
00:49:56,201 --> 00:49:59,496
Did you see how those newbies
looked up to me?

747
00:49:59,579 --> 00:50:01,915
They said we were the core of KMA.

748
00:50:04,292 --> 00:50:06,962
I'm going to remain on our team

749
00:50:07,045 --> 00:50:08,880
until a newbie joins us.

750
00:50:09,464 --> 00:50:14,136
Goodness, I love you so much.
I'm so proud of you.

751
00:50:15,053 --> 00:50:17,514
Goodness. Should I compliment you

752
00:50:17,597 --> 00:50:19,182
or call you a fool?

753
00:50:19,266 --> 00:50:21,184
Say it was a brave decision.

754
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:22,602
Please.

755
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:25,021
Let's go. I'll buy you dinner.

756
00:50:25,105 --> 00:50:26,398
Can we have barbeque?

757
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:30,652
-I'll buy you two servings. Let's go.
-Yes!

758
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:31,695
It's green.

759
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:37,075
No matter how much pork I have,
I always crave beef.

760
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:39,369
-Are you serious?
-That's just me.

761
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:46,710
Doors closing.

762
00:51:10,942 --> 00:51:11,902
It's not snowing yet.

763
00:51:13,278 --> 00:51:14,112
No.

764
00:51:15,363 --> 00:51:17,324
It was your first time
as a director, right?

765
00:51:17,949 --> 00:51:18,992
Sorry?

766
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:21,703
Issuing a heavy snow advisory.

767
00:51:22,996 --> 00:51:24,623
Oh, that. Yes.

768
00:51:27,375 --> 00:51:29,252
Predicting snow is the hardest.

769
00:51:34,466 --> 00:51:35,467
Why are you laughing?

770
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:39,513
Last time, you said predicting
localized heavy rain was the hardest.

771
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:43,183
Did I? Whatever.

772
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:45,060
Predicting anything that falls is hard.

773
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:47,646
I agree.

774
00:51:48,438 --> 00:51:50,690
Good work. Hang in there.

775
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:52,442
Goodbye.

776
00:52:26,935 --> 00:52:28,186
Here you go.

777
00:52:28,770 --> 00:52:30,146
I'm sorry.

778
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:32,482
I was suddenly craving some grapefruit.

779
00:52:33,024 --> 00:52:34,860
-Aren't you cold?
-No, I'm okay.

780
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:36,653
-Try it.
-Okay.

781
00:52:40,198 --> 00:52:41,283
How is it?

782
00:52:44,035 --> 00:52:46,288
I can finally breathe. It's so good.

783
00:52:46,371 --> 00:52:48,707
See? I heard you need to eat well

784
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:51,251
to have mild morning sickness.

785
00:52:52,627 --> 00:52:54,379
Did you sign up to a moms' community?

786
00:52:54,963 --> 00:52:56,006
Of course.

787
00:52:56,089 --> 00:52:59,134
I can easily stay up past midnight
chatting with other moms.

788
00:52:59,217 --> 00:53:01,052
They share a lot of useful information.

789
00:53:02,888 --> 00:53:03,972
This is bad.

790
00:53:04,055 --> 00:53:05,682
What if you turn into one of them?

791
00:53:05,765 --> 00:53:06,892
So what?

792
00:53:06,975 --> 00:53:09,477
-Are you craving anything else?
-No.

793
00:53:09,561 --> 00:53:11,021
Okay. I'll start the car then.

794
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:16,943
Do you think it'll really snow tonight?

795
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:18,445
The sky is so clear.

796
00:53:19,571 --> 00:53:20,697
You're right.

797
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:23,158
Heavy snow isn't good

798
00:53:23,241 --> 00:53:25,243
but a wrong forecast is terrible too.

799
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:28,455
I hope when I wake up tomorrow morning,

800
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:31,416
everything will be covered in snow.

801
00:53:33,418 --> 00:53:34,628
Doors opening.

802
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:37,714
Mom!

803
00:53:37,797 --> 00:53:40,383
-Doors closing.
-What are you doing here? It's cold out.

804
00:53:40,467 --> 00:53:42,719
-Come on.
-Well, my daughter changed the passcode

805
00:53:42,802 --> 00:53:44,429
and didn't let me in.

806
00:53:44,512 --> 00:53:47,265
All I could do was stay out here and wait.

807
00:53:48,224 --> 00:53:50,810
-Gosh, my legs.
-You're unbelievable.

808
00:53:54,439 --> 00:53:55,899
Go in.

809
00:54:17,587 --> 00:54:18,713
Here.

810
00:54:19,214 --> 00:54:20,882
How are you feeling now?

811
00:54:23,468 --> 00:54:25,261
Even my bones are frozen.

812
00:54:25,345 --> 00:54:27,013
Are you happy?

813
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:33,853
You shouldn't come here whenever you wish.

814
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:37,482
And stop bringing side dishes.
I don't eat at home anyway.

815
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:40,652
It's about Si-woo.

816
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:43,613
What about him?

817
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:45,240
Did you meet him again?

818
00:54:45,323 --> 00:54:47,575
Is his father seriously ill?

819
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:53,957
Did he tell you that?

820
00:54:56,459 --> 00:54:58,503
So that's why he broke up with you.

821
00:54:58,586 --> 00:55:00,046
He didn't want to burden you.

822
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:04,926
Poor him.

823
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:08,722
He's still so young.
It must be tough for him.

824
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:14,352
It's true that
his father is like baggage to him.

825
00:55:16,563 --> 00:55:20,316
Watch your language.
He's much older than you.

826
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,152
But it's true.

827
00:55:22,235 --> 00:55:24,821
Do you know how much he pesters Si-woo?

828
00:55:24,904 --> 00:55:27,240
He's such a headache
and always asks him for money.

829
00:55:30,076 --> 00:55:31,161
So?

830
00:55:31,745 --> 00:55:34,539
Is that why you turned Si-woo down?

831
00:55:35,123 --> 00:55:36,332
You couldn't look past it?

832
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,085
I never said that.

833
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:40,712
It's all good then.

834
00:55:40,795 --> 00:55:44,215
You even set
your passcode to his birthday.

835
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:47,427
It's not his birthday.

836
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:49,512
I already saw it.

837
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:51,014
Zero, three, one, four.

838
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:54,476
It's not my birthday, Tae-kyung's, yours,

839
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:56,770
or your late father's.

840
00:55:56,853 --> 00:55:59,022
Then it's obvious. It's his birthday.

841
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:02,358
What about his time of birth?

842
00:56:02,942 --> 00:56:04,736
It's not his birthday.

843
00:56:04,819 --> 00:56:07,655
Jeez. Fine.
I won't look at your compatibility.

844
00:56:07,739 --> 00:56:09,824
Gosh, I'm too offended
to look at it anymore.

845
00:56:09,908 --> 00:56:11,785
It's not his birthday.

846
00:56:13,078 --> 00:56:14,621
It's the day we first met.

847
00:56:15,288 --> 00:56:16,706
March 14.

848
00:56:19,417 --> 00:56:22,754
That's the day
Si-woo and I met for the first time.

849
00:56:28,176 --> 00:56:32,347
You even set that date as your passcode.
Why are you breaking up?

850
00:56:41,564 --> 00:56:42,607
You see…

851
00:56:43,525 --> 00:56:45,610
There was nothing I could do…

852
00:56:48,113 --> 00:56:50,115
even though I didn't want to break up.

853
00:56:50,907 --> 00:56:52,909
He wanted to.

854
00:56:53,535 --> 00:56:55,870
Should I have swallowed my pride
and clung to him?

855
00:56:57,122 --> 00:56:58,498
On top of that,

856
00:56:59,749 --> 00:57:01,376
I'm his senior at work.

857
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:08,383
To be honest,

858
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:13,012
it's really hard for me too, Mom.

859
00:57:35,326 --> 00:57:38,663
Do you know what
the stupidest thing in the world is?

860
00:57:39,164 --> 00:57:40,999
Breaking up out of love.

861
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:43,126
Come on.

862
00:57:43,209 --> 00:57:46,254
That's such a despicable
and hypocritical thing to do.

863
00:57:46,337 --> 00:57:48,214
Why break up if you're in love?

864
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:51,384
How could you break up?
Does that make any sense?

865
00:57:52,927 --> 00:57:54,804
In that sense,

866
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:57,932
you don't love her
as much as you think you do.

867
00:58:02,604 --> 00:58:03,521
That's not true.

868
00:58:03,605 --> 00:58:05,690
I heard you wanted to break up first.

869
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:07,775
I only said that

870
00:58:07,859 --> 00:58:10,653
because I didn't want to burden her.

871
00:58:10,737 --> 00:58:12,822
See? You did say it first.

872
00:58:15,783 --> 00:58:17,285
But I had no idea

873
00:58:17,869 --> 00:58:21,206
she'd immediately agree to it.

874
00:58:21,873 --> 00:58:24,709
To be honest, I'm also sad

875
00:58:25,877 --> 00:58:27,295
and hurt.

876
00:58:27,378 --> 00:58:31,090
Then you should've grabbed onto her then.
Why didn't you?

877
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:37,514
Because she could have really meant it.

878
00:58:38,681 --> 00:58:40,600
Maybe I was too much for her,

879
00:58:40,683 --> 00:58:42,227
so she could have thought,

880
00:58:43,937 --> 00:58:45,063
"Good riddance."

881
00:58:45,813 --> 00:58:47,065
Oh, dear.

882
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:51,194
Life is short, you fools.

883
00:58:56,866 --> 00:58:58,117
What do you mean?

884
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:01,496
Stop trying to only
predict tomorrow's weather.

885
00:59:01,579 --> 00:59:03,957
Observe today's as well.

886
00:59:04,624 --> 00:59:06,459
Look at the sky every now and then,

887
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:08,753
enjoy the breeze on a rooftop,

888
00:59:08,836 --> 00:59:11,214
and gaze at the person you love.

889
00:59:12,048 --> 00:59:14,050
Why bother looking for tomorrow's answers

890
00:59:14,133 --> 00:59:16,678
when you can't even live in the present?

891
00:59:16,761 --> 00:59:18,972
No wonder you're always wrong.

892
00:59:19,722 --> 00:59:20,932
Mom.

893
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:25,603
Life is short, you fools.

894
00:59:25,687 --> 00:59:29,357
It's like a cloud that's
easily swept away by the wind.

895
00:59:29,941 --> 00:59:31,442
Do you understand, my daughter?

896
00:59:32,694 --> 00:59:33,945
Goodness.

897
00:59:36,155 --> 00:59:38,449
-I'm going home.
-Really?

898
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:40,994
Don't see me out. It's cold.

899
01:00:10,565 --> 01:00:12,942
"You shine brightly when you tell me

900
01:00:13,026 --> 01:00:15,903
that rain needs to meet another rain
for them to get drenched."

901
01:00:16,946 --> 01:00:19,198
-Something like this.
-Come on.

902
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:51,731
I'm never going to date
a colleague ever again.

903
01:00:52,315 --> 01:00:54,817
Come on. You never know.

904
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:56,486
I do.

905
01:00:56,569 --> 01:00:59,656
I will never date
another colleague ever again.

906
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:07,080
Despite everything,
I chose the thorny path once again.

907
01:01:13,378 --> 01:01:14,921
Why did I?

908
01:01:51,624 --> 01:01:54,961
I keep falling for you.

909
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:27,160
Forecaster Lee, you--

910
01:02:29,495 --> 01:02:30,621
Because it's you,

911
01:02:31,706 --> 01:02:33,040
Jin Ha-kyung.

912
01:02:39,797 --> 01:02:40,965
Because it's you,

913
01:02:41,883 --> 01:02:43,259
Lee Si-woo.

914
01:03:02,028 --> 01:03:03,237
Because…

915
01:03:04,405 --> 01:03:05,823
I just like you.

916
01:03:11,829 --> 01:03:13,706
Because I like being with you.

917
01:04:05,883 --> 01:04:07,176
We forecasted snow,

918
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:09,470
but you know
that can always change, right?

919
01:04:09,554 --> 01:04:11,389
It could always change to rain,

920
01:04:11,472 --> 01:04:13,975
so check the adiabatic chart
and the vertical structure.

921
01:04:14,058 --> 01:04:15,351
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

922
01:04:17,144 --> 01:04:20,398
REAL-TIME RADAR

923
01:05:40,102 --> 01:05:43,356
See? I told you it would snow.

924
01:05:54,951 --> 01:05:59,246
SEOUL OBSERVATORY

925
01:06:01,332 --> 01:06:02,792
Why did you come here?

926
01:06:04,377 --> 01:06:05,962
To see the first snow.

927
01:06:11,842 --> 01:06:14,720
People aren't interested
in the first rain,

928
01:06:15,429 --> 01:06:17,348
but they sure love the first snow.

929
01:06:18,599 --> 01:06:19,767
Don't you agree?

930
01:06:20,685 --> 01:06:21,936
You're right.

931
01:06:24,730 --> 01:06:28,150
I will always cherish this snow.

932
01:06:30,236 --> 01:06:33,990
Just like the rain on the day
we met for the first time.

933
01:06:35,241 --> 01:06:36,492
Do you remember

934
01:06:37,243 --> 01:06:38,995
the day we first met?

935
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:41,831
Si as in time and Woo as in rain.

936
01:06:41,914 --> 01:06:45,167
Rain that falls at the right time.
I'm Lee Si-woo.

937
01:07:05,688 --> 01:07:07,231
-March 14.
-March 14.

938
01:07:13,696 --> 01:07:15,031
You see…

939
01:07:15,698 --> 01:07:18,284
There's a Spanish proverb
that goes like this.

940
01:07:19,994 --> 01:07:24,081
"One too many sunny days
will result in a desert."

941
01:07:26,667 --> 01:07:28,210
To be honest,

942
01:07:29,003 --> 01:07:31,964
I was first attracted
to your bright and healthy attitude.

943
01:07:34,383 --> 01:07:36,927
Because I was exhausted and depressed.

944
01:07:37,970 --> 01:07:40,639
But as time passed,

945
01:07:41,307 --> 01:07:43,225
I learned about your pain

946
01:07:44,268 --> 01:07:46,937
and the things you wanted to hide.

947
01:07:47,980 --> 01:07:49,065
Through them,

948
01:07:50,066 --> 01:07:51,859
I got to know you better.

949
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:56,030
And I fell deeper in love with you.

950
01:08:02,286 --> 01:08:03,496
So I hope

951
01:08:04,538 --> 01:08:06,999
you don't hate or resent

952
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:10,044
the storm that you're in.

953
01:08:13,089 --> 01:08:16,300
All storms are bound to recede.

954
01:08:19,220 --> 01:08:22,765
Everyone has their own storm.

955
01:08:23,390 --> 01:08:27,144
But if someone is by your side

956
01:08:27,853 --> 01:08:30,773
when you're going through one,

957
01:08:31,982 --> 01:08:34,026
wouldn't you feel safer?

958
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:38,823
I wish that someone could be you.

959
01:08:46,747 --> 01:08:47,790
I don't

960
01:08:48,999 --> 01:08:50,417
flirt around.

961
01:08:51,418 --> 01:08:53,379
I didn't ask you to flirt with me.

962
01:08:55,589 --> 01:08:57,049
Then do you want to go out with me?

963
01:08:59,301 --> 01:09:01,262
If we like each other, we can go out.

964
01:09:02,263 --> 01:09:03,681
If not, we won't.

965
01:09:07,726 --> 01:09:09,061
So what are we?

966
01:09:15,484 --> 01:09:16,694
I love you.

967
01:09:19,446 --> 01:09:22,158
I think I really love you.

968
01:09:37,464 --> 01:09:38,549
I love you more.

969
01:09:39,133 --> 01:09:40,885
I love you so much more.

970
01:09:44,346 --> 01:09:46,307
I'm going to love you

971
01:09:47,558 --> 01:09:49,727
even more in the future.

972
01:10:28,933 --> 01:10:31,185
The snow is so pretty.

973
01:10:34,396 --> 01:10:36,815
You can rake the snow tomorrow morning.

974
01:11:00,297 --> 01:11:01,715
Tae-kyung.

975
01:11:03,676 --> 01:11:06,762
Well, it's nothing important.

976
01:11:06,845 --> 01:11:08,472
The first snow…

977
01:11:10,182 --> 01:11:12,935
is falling outside.

978
01:11:14,395 --> 01:11:18,983
It's really pretty outside.

979
01:11:19,483 --> 01:11:22,903
And it made me think of you.

980
01:11:27,157 --> 01:11:28,909
I love you, Tae-kyung.

981
01:11:32,538 --> 01:11:33,706
Look.

982
01:11:35,749 --> 01:11:37,001
I really…

983
01:11:38,085 --> 01:11:39,795
I really can't break up.

984
01:11:41,338 --> 01:11:42,464
You're…

985
01:11:43,340 --> 01:11:45,009
my first love!

986
01:11:45,926 --> 01:11:47,052
I…

987
01:11:48,012 --> 01:11:50,681
I love you, Tae-kyung.

988
01:11:51,849 --> 01:11:53,142
The snow…

989
01:11:54,518 --> 01:11:57,479
I don't want to! I'm not breaking up!

990
01:12:08,032 --> 01:12:09,283
Look at that.

991
01:12:11,827 --> 01:12:12,995
Look at that.

992
01:12:29,762 --> 01:12:32,056
It's going to snow
more heavily than we predicted.

993
01:12:32,681 --> 01:12:35,184
Maybe we should re-calculate
the amount of snowfall.

994
01:12:35,267 --> 01:12:37,311
Should I check
the relative humidity progress?

995
01:12:37,394 --> 01:12:39,063
Yes. That's a good idea.

996
01:12:39,146 --> 01:12:41,398
Can you call
and check on the Seoul Observatory?

997
01:12:41,482 --> 01:12:42,733
-Yes, sir.
-Okay.

998
01:13:07,674 --> 01:13:10,636
Chan! Gyeol! Hurry up.
It's time to go to school.

999
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:12,721
They already left. Honey.

1000
01:13:13,347 --> 01:13:14,807
Drink this before you go.

1001
01:13:15,557 --> 01:13:16,850
-They already left?
-Yes.

1002
01:13:17,518 --> 01:13:18,519
Okay.

1003
01:13:22,481 --> 01:13:24,525
-Thanks. See you later.
-Bye.

1004
01:13:26,985 --> 01:13:28,862
-You know what?
-Yes?

1005
01:13:30,614 --> 01:13:33,534
You don't have to pass the exam,

1006
01:13:33,617 --> 01:13:34,993
so don't feel too pressured.

1007
01:13:35,619 --> 01:13:36,912
What do you mean?

1008
01:13:38,455 --> 01:13:42,209
I love you just the way you are.

1009
01:13:44,294 --> 01:13:45,504
Bye.

1010
01:13:55,848 --> 01:13:58,642
-Do you need my help?
-Just get the spoons and chopsticks.

1011
01:13:58,725 --> 01:13:59,810
Okay.

1012
01:14:08,944 --> 01:14:11,029
Bo-mi, let's eat.

1013
01:14:13,449 --> 01:14:15,951
I'm not eating. I'm off to school.

1014
01:14:20,747 --> 01:14:22,791
What's wrong? Did I do something?

1015
01:14:23,584 --> 01:14:26,253
She read a news article
about this guy having a girlfriend.

1016
01:14:26,336 --> 01:14:28,714
"This guy"? Who is he?

1017
01:14:29,506 --> 01:14:32,092
You don't need to know.
He's her favorite idol star.

1018
01:14:32,176 --> 01:14:33,469
-Sit down.
-Okay.

1019
01:14:34,678 --> 01:14:35,846
An idol star?

1020
01:14:40,100 --> 01:14:42,352
This is nice too.

1021
01:14:55,699 --> 01:14:56,825
And this is nice too.

1022
01:14:58,368 --> 01:15:01,246
Don't laugh. I'm not in the mood.

1023
01:15:03,665 --> 01:15:04,875
Bo-mi.

1024
01:15:05,751 --> 01:15:06,585
Are you okay?

1025
01:15:10,380 --> 01:15:11,590
I am.

1026
01:15:11,673 --> 01:15:15,010
You must determine its form
once you predict precipitation.

1027
01:15:15,594 --> 01:15:17,221
If it's snow or sleet,

1028
01:15:17,304 --> 01:15:20,349
you need to determine
when it'll start piling up.

1029
01:15:20,974 --> 01:15:22,184
If you expect piled-up snow,

1030
01:15:22,267 --> 01:15:25,103
determine its amount by calculating
the liquid water equivalent.

1031
01:15:25,187 --> 01:15:28,649
This is basic knowledge
for those who work here.

1032
01:15:28,732 --> 01:15:29,858
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

1033
01:15:30,442 --> 01:15:32,736
"Climate Outlook for This Summer".

1034
01:15:33,529 --> 01:15:34,905
Who wrote this?

1035
01:15:35,822 --> 01:15:36,782
Me.

1036
01:15:39,576 --> 01:15:41,370
Didn't I tell you

1037
01:15:41,453 --> 01:15:43,664
I wanted an enticing title?

1038
01:15:43,747 --> 01:15:46,124
Writing such things
isn't good for the baby.

1039
01:15:47,793 --> 01:15:50,546
-Are you taking maternity leave?
-Of course, I will.

1040
01:15:50,629 --> 01:15:52,005
When will that be?

1041
01:15:52,881 --> 01:15:54,091
I'm not sure.

1042
01:15:54,174 --> 01:15:56,176
The baby hasn't given me any hints.

1043
01:15:59,805 --> 01:16:01,807
I'll be taking maternity leave

1044
01:16:01,890 --> 01:16:03,517
the day I give birth.

1045
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:05,519
You're truly incredible.

1046
01:16:05,602 --> 01:16:07,020
I should be.

1047
01:16:07,688 --> 01:16:09,147
I'm a mother now.

1048
01:16:10,941 --> 01:16:13,151
BACK IN MY DAY BY JIN TAE-KYUNG
SHIN SEOK-HO PUBLISHING COMPANY

1049
01:16:15,404 --> 01:16:17,072
What is this?

1050
01:16:20,075 --> 01:16:23,245
Isn't this my book?

1051
01:16:24,371 --> 01:16:25,664
Well…

1052
01:16:25,747 --> 01:16:29,001
I found out individuals
could publish books too. So…

1053
01:16:30,085 --> 01:16:31,461
I published it.

1054
01:16:33,463 --> 01:16:35,591
It may lack a commercial hook,

1055
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:38,802
but it still has literary value.

1056
01:16:40,846 --> 01:16:42,055
Seok-ho.

1057
01:16:46,018 --> 01:16:47,603
What's this?

1058
01:16:48,937 --> 01:16:50,522
Oh, this?

1059
01:16:51,148 --> 01:16:54,818
I'm going to publish
all your future books.

1060
01:16:59,239 --> 01:17:01,867
I have such an amazing boyfriend.

1061
01:17:02,743 --> 01:17:05,662
Until the day my status changes

1062
01:17:06,455 --> 01:17:08,832
from "boyfriend" to "husband",

1063
01:17:09,791 --> 01:17:10,834
I'll do my best.

1064
01:17:14,379 --> 01:17:15,631
Tae-kyung.

1065
01:17:21,094 --> 01:17:22,220
Okay.

1066
01:17:23,013 --> 01:17:26,391
I'll see you later in the evening.

1067
01:17:26,975 --> 01:17:28,560
-See you later.
-Okay.

1068
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:42,908
Son, will you be late today?

1069
01:17:43,492 --> 01:17:44,868
It depends on the weather.

1070
01:17:44,951 --> 01:17:47,996
Even if things are looking up,
don't you dare come home early.

1071
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:49,289
Stay out until late.

1072
01:17:50,165 --> 01:17:53,210
Go on a date with the director.

1073
01:17:53,293 --> 01:17:54,378
Okay?

1074
01:17:55,045 --> 01:17:56,421
Take your medication on time.

1075
01:17:56,505 --> 01:17:59,466
And stop playing cards
with your neighbors.

1076
01:17:59,549 --> 01:18:01,051
All right. Go.

1077
01:18:01,134 --> 01:18:02,719
You have chemo in two days.

1078
01:18:02,803 --> 01:18:06,264
Jeez, you and your nagging.
I can't take it. Just leave already.

1079
01:18:06,348 --> 01:18:07,849
I'll be off, Father.

1080
01:18:15,649 --> 01:18:16,775
Goodness.

1081
01:18:17,317 --> 01:18:19,695
Okay. Let's begin since we're all here.

1082
01:18:21,238 --> 01:18:24,783
We'll begin the meeting of March 14, 2023.

1083
01:18:24,866 --> 01:18:26,284
Satellite Center?

1084
01:18:26,368 --> 01:18:28,245
This is the Satellite Center.

1085
01:18:28,328 --> 01:18:31,707
We're detecting yellow dust
over the West Sea…

1086
01:18:31,790 --> 01:18:38,797
NATIONAL METEOROLOGICAL CENTER
COMPREHENSIVE CONTROL SYSTEM

1087
01:19:26,178 --> 01:19:27,471
Perhaps…

1088
01:19:27,971 --> 01:19:32,225
there are no right answers in life.

1089
01:19:38,315 --> 01:19:42,569
There is only the process of turning
our decisions into the right answers.

1090
01:19:45,822 --> 01:19:50,202
That is why
we aren't afraid to make mistakes.

1091
01:19:55,415 --> 01:19:58,752
Because it'll bring us
one step closer to tomorrow's answers.

1092
01:20:01,922 --> 01:20:04,674
I'll give you tomorrow's weather forecast.

1093
01:20:13,475 --> 01:20:14,726
Thank you.

1094
01:20:19,564 --> 01:20:21,233
Can you tell that I'm nervous?

1095
01:20:22,275 --> 01:20:24,236
Yes. Totally.

1096
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:25,946
What should I do?

1097
01:20:26,029 --> 01:20:28,365
It's not too late. Should we go back?

1098
01:20:28,448 --> 01:20:31,409
No, we can't. They're in there already.

1099
01:20:31,493 --> 01:20:32,994
What should we do?

1100
01:20:38,792 --> 01:20:39,876
Wait.

1101
01:21:03,441 --> 01:21:04,818
What's this for?

1102
01:21:06,027 --> 01:21:07,195
It's pretty.

1103
01:21:10,574 --> 01:21:11,616
Let's go.

1104
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:18,540
Well… Hello.

1105
01:21:19,124 --> 01:21:22,502
I'm Director Jin Ha-Kyung's mother,
Bae Soo-ja.

1106
01:21:22,586 --> 01:21:24,754
Hello. It's nice to meet you.

1107
01:21:25,547 --> 01:21:28,717
I'm Forecaster Lee Si-woo's father,
Lee Myung-han.

1108
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:30,051
Hello.

1109
01:21:30,552 --> 01:21:33,972
So are you done with chemo?

1110
01:21:34,055 --> 01:21:35,724
Yes, I am.

1111
01:21:36,558 --> 01:21:39,936
But I'll have to monitor myself
for the next five years.

1112
01:21:40,520 --> 01:21:41,771
I see.

1113
01:21:41,855 --> 01:21:44,774
He clearly looks like an immature man.

1114
01:21:44,858 --> 01:21:48,236
She looks so cold-hearted.

1115
01:21:59,039 --> 01:22:01,541
Should we just leave?

1116
01:22:03,001 --> 01:22:04,753
Yes. Let's do that.

1117
01:22:13,553 --> 01:22:18,224
