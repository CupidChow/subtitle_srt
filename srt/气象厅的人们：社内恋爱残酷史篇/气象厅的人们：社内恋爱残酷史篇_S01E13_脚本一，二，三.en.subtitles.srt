1
00:00:57,432 --> 00:00:59,642
- Here. Look at the numbers.
- No.

2
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:00,935
- They're wrong.
- Hey.

3
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:02,312
- Look.
- It's heading south.

4
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:04,564
I mean, look.

5
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:07,108
It's moving to Japan. It's on here.

6
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:09,235
-No.
-If not, the damage will be too great.

7
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:12,113
It's descending from the north.
It's moving down,

8
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:14,616
so it's flowing this way right now.

9
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:16,201
-Do the numbers say that?
-Look.

10
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:17,368
What?

11
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:21,081
Hey.

12
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:23,583
Hey, look at this.
This is the current data.

13
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:25,376
It's flowing this way.

14
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,338
This is up there.

15
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:49,150
TYPHOON RICKY CONTINUES TO
CAUSE DAMAGE IN VARIOUS LOCATIONS

16
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:51,152
-Jeez.
-Okay.

17
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:52,904
-Sir.
-Yes?

18
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:58,284
Hi. Get the estimated precipitation again.

19
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:00,286
-Okay.
-Yes?

20
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:08,128
Please take a look at this.

21
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:12,549
Okay.

22
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:16,678
Hi, this is Chief Team One.

23
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:17,720
Yes.

24
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:33,278
Last night, the 14th Typhoon Ricky
swept the Korean Peninsula,

25
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:35,697
making the entire country a mess.

26
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,574
There were about 120 casualties

27
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:39,742
due to strong winds of 30m per second.

28
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:43,413
The amount of property damage alone
is estimated to exceed 80 billion won.

29
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:48,126
Heavy rain that fell overnight
caused flooding across the country.

30
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:50,253
Early this morning,
in Yangcheon-gu, Seoul,

31
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:52,547
-a four-lane road was flooded
-The KMA got it this time.

32
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,923
and drainage work was carried out.

33
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,842
-Ha-kyung will be criticized less.
-An underground

34
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:57,969
shopping mall in Suncheon was flooded.

35
00:02:58,052 --> 00:02:59,596
Yes, that's right.

36
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:04,684
This typhoon did not deviate much
from our predicted scenario.

37
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:08,438
-Yes. The precipitation and the path
-We live with multiple scenarios.

38
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,273
of the typhoon were almost identical.

39
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:12,567
Thank you.

40
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:14,360
Yes.

41
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:19,198
TYPHOON'S PREDICTED PATH CLOSELY MATCHES
WITH THE FORECAST OF THE KMA

42
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:26,456
Sometimes, the scenario
you prepared proves right.

43
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,087
Excuse me.

44
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:36,090
I need to use the bathroom.

45
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:44,599
Why are we bringing him?

46
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:47,268
This is the best I can do…

47
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,358
to mend Si-woo's relationship with his dad

48
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,485
and with me.

49
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,080
Some things in this world

50
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:09,749
are just impossible.

51
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,378
Just like how humans
can't change a typhoon's course,

52
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:15,755
the same goes
for my relationship with my father.

53
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,216
It can never

54
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:20,134
be changed.

55
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:24,764
I stay true to myself

56
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:27,267
just like you do.

57
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,982
I'm sorry

58
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:36,693
that this is all I'm worth.

59
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:41,072
Let's…

60
00:04:43,157 --> 00:04:44,367
break up.

61
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:58,214
If the expected scenario goes off course,

62
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:02,385
it can lead to the worst outcome.

63
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,309
So you didn't come here to see me.

64
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:11,728
Well…

65
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:18,443
Yu-jin.

66
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:34,667
The important thing is that

67
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:38,046
whether the scenario you prepared
is right or wrong,

68
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:39,922
life goes on.

69
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:43,259
You know that
the 15th typhoon is coming, right?

70
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,887
It looks like…

71
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,472
-Eight hours?
-Yes.

72
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:50,600
In eight hours,
it'll enter the Korean Peninsula.

73
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:54,729
There's no need to return to Seoul.
Stay there and check the second one.

74
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:55,897
What?

75
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:59,067
Where do you think?

76
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,611
You have to go to the typhoon center.

77
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:05,740
-Go right now.
-Pardon? Now?

78
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:08,034
Wait, sir. I--

79
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:16,334
And we have to prepare

80
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:20,838
for the next scenario
and the scenario after that.

81
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:33,184
EPISODE 13
SCENARIO 1, 2, 3

82
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:53,079
When did you find out?

83
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:54,247
Well…

84
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:56,916
It's been a while.

85
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:00,962
What?

86
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:10,847
That long ago?

87
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:13,975
What about you? When did you find out?

88
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:17,395
It's been a while since I had a hunch.

89
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:26,362
Forecaster Lee, did you catch a cold?

90
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,405
Yes.

91
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:30,241
We'll begin the morning meeting of May 10.

92
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:31,451
Satellite center--

93
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:34,078
I'm sorry.

94
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,372
Now…

95
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,416
Thank you.

96
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,048
Gosh, I got goosebumps.

97
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,885
Since then? I got chills just now.

98
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:51,304
When did you find out?

99
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:53,473
I found out later.

100
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:55,475
Remember that day?

101
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:21,334
Right. It was so obvious.

102
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:23,628
I couldn't pretend I didn't know.

103
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:25,129
I caught them too many times.

104
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,137
Get it together, Forecaster Lee!

105
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:34,722
Yes, ma'am.

106
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:37,099
They should have taken it easy.

107
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:42,480
Anyway, what are we going to do?

108
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:45,066
What can we do other than play innocent?

109
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:49,028
We'll continue to keep our mouths shut
and pretend we don't know.

110
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:52,782
Pretend you don't know what?

111
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:57,370
-What?
-What is it? Why?

112
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,872
Why did you stop talking?

113
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,749
It's nothing.

114
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:18,224
Senior Forecaster Um
probably knows, right?

115
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:20,768
Of course. He lived with them.

116
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:22,853
If he doesn't know,
then he must be really dense.

117
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:23,771
What?

118
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:28,192
Did you talk about me?

119
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:29,610
What?

120
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:30,695
No.

121
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:32,154
-No.
-No.

122
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:36,033
Jeez. You found out so fast.

123
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:39,412
That's right. I'm about to be divorced.

124
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:49,839
How did they find out?

125
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:57,597
Sir, I only have 6,000 won.

126
00:09:58,222 --> 00:10:00,474
Could you please drive me to the airport?

127
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:02,518
Please? Come on.

128
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,478
Excuse me. Hey!

129
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:06,397
You…

130
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,693
Jeez.

131
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:16,115
Damn it.

132
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:22,288
Jeez.

133
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,543
Hey, Ms. Director.

134
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:30,671
Let me ask you a question.

135
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:35,885
Why did you have to drag me
all the way here

136
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:38,471
knowing that Si-woo
wouldn't be happy to see me?

137
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:41,974
I have a question too.

138
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:44,060
Your son is hurt.

139
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:45,811
How can you
only talk about the settlement?

140
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:50,566
The world is after you
to take the shirt off your back.

141
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,276
If you're naive,

142
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,320
you can never survive.

143
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:56,530
As a father, I need to stay alert

144
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:58,783
and take all I can get.

145
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:01,869
Is that wrong?

146
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:06,040
There are so many
different kinds of fathers.

147
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:15,132
PETITION FOR DIVORCE

148
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:40,533
Some fathers work hard,

149
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:44,870
but they always feel sorry
towards their children.

150
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:49,667
Some irresponsible fathers take flight

151
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:52,378
and leave their young children behind.

152
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:57,967
And some fathers are shameless and
selfish when it comes to their children.

153
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:01,929
Jeez.

154
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:03,389
Damn it!

155
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:05,599
I shouldn't have come here.

156
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:15,943
You'll have to return to Seoul alone.

157
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:11,415
Get in. I'll drive you to your mother's.

158
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:17,296
I have something to say. Please get in.

159
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:22,361
Why did you send
a director from Headquarters here?

160
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:24,238
I don't think she'll be of much help.

161
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:27,908
I have to follow your orders,
Director General.

162
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:29,410
Yes, sir.

163
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:35,833
Currently, Typhoon Elisha has
a central pressure of 985

164
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:37,585
and a maximum wind speed of 27

165
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:40,921
and has moved northward
to the sea about 250km south of Jeju.

166
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:42,673
With that size and speed,

167
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:44,925
it's likely to land on the southern coast.

168
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:46,802
I'll analyze the path.

169
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,054
You can be in charge
of the synoptic weather observation.

170
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:50,931
Got it?

171
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:52,516
Okay.

172
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,518
SYNOPTIC WEATHER OBSERVATION: OBSERVATIONS
MADE AT A SPECIFIC TIME AT ALL STATIONS

173
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:56,228
How is Forecaster Lee?

174
00:14:57,646 --> 00:14:58,939
The burn treatment is over,

175
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:01,108
but his eyes need
to be monitored for a while.

176
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:03,068
Is that so?

177
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:08,157
A person got hurt,
but you seem indifferent.

178
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:18,959
Are you making a fuss
because I let your colleague get hurt?

179
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:22,504
No, I just think

180
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:26,634
you should show some concern at least.

181
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:31,972
Director Jin.

182
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:36,060
You've only worked at Headquarters, right?

183
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:37,227
Yes. And?

184
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:41,482
Do you know how I got this?

185
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:46,362
I slipped while going up to Baengnokdam

186
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,364
to check the AWS there.

187
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:54,495
Assistant Director Park can't hear
with his left ear well.

188
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:58,457
Because he was hit by a signboard
on site during a storm.

189
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,419
On his way to observe the wind field,

190
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:04,254
Mr. Jung Su-hwan's car rolled over.

191
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:09,635
Anyone who has worked in the field
for more than ten years

192
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:11,762
has at least one wound like this.

193
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:13,764
I'm sorry about Forecaster Lee's injury,

194
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:15,683
but it happens every day here.

195
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:19,019
Do you get it, Director Jin?

196
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:22,523
Yes.

197
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,024
Director?

198
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:27,444
I'm the director here.

199
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:29,738
-Please look at this.
-Okay.

200
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:51,051
What?

201
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:53,679
You should be in the hospital.

202
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:58,058
They said I didn't get hurt
as much as they thought.

203
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:00,310
Besides, I recover fast.

204
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:01,770
I heard you hurt your eyes.

205
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,857
They said I just need to monitor them
for a few days.

206
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,234
Everything's fine so far.

207
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,115
Did you hear that, Director Jin?

208
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:28,797
I need to talk to you.

209
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:51,153
I can't do this anymore.

210
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:53,655
Just be a man and sign the divorce papers.

211
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,157
Let's get a divorce

212
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,201
and live carefree lives

213
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,995
like we do right now, okay?

214
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,056
What do you think of this?

215
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:23,310
JIN TAE-KYUNG

216
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,153
It's cute.

217
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:39,409
SAVE

218
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:51,839
-Is the typhoon report ready yet?
-Pardon? Yes.

219
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:56,760
-The typhoon report is being uploaded.
-Okay.

220
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,808
See you after work.

221
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:12,151
TYPHOON REPORT

222
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:15,863
Su-jin, I need to see you.

223
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:21,201
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR PARK SUNG-JIN

224
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:24,079
Okay.

225
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:27,499
I have to go to the Policy Office.

226
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:28,584
Okay.

227
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:34,256
GYEOL'S HOMEROOM TEACHER

228

SAFE COUNTRY, PEACEFUL PEOPLE

229
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:40,470
Yes, ma'am. Hello.

230
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,599
Did Gyeol do that?

231
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:47,352
Yes. He does that sometimes.

232
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:48,896
Goodness.

233
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,690
Yes. Really?

234
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:55,485
TYPHOON REPORT
UPLOADING

235
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:57,196
Go back to the hospital right now.

236
00:19:57,779 --> 00:19:59,448
I already got discharged.

237
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:02,075
And I have no problem working.

238
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:06,622
Do you always have it your way?

239
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:10,459
Let's…

240
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:12,586
break up.

241
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:20,344
Do you think you can end it like that?

242
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:22,930
Sure. You said what was on your mind.

243
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,474
But I haven't given you an answer.

244
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:27,726
So wait until I do.

245
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:32,773
Director Jin. Please come to the office.

246
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:41,323
KOREA METEOROLOGICAL ADMINISTRATION
NATIONAL TYPHOON CENTER

247
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:43,408
What's that?

248
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:45,244
That's what I want to ask.

249
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:47,663
What is that?

250
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:53,502
Seok-ho, what's that
on the typhoon report window?

251
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:55,963
The typhoon report? What about it?

252
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,516
What?

253
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,851
What's a penguin doing there?

254
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:15,148
Assistant Director Shin.

255
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:17,150
Did you upload that?

256
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:26,868
What are you doing? Take it down!

257
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:30,455
Yes… Yes, sir.

258
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:37,337
TYPHOON REPORT

259
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:41,008
A typhoon is about to hit.

260
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,093
Who's responsible for this?

261
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:46,430
Not even a rookie here
would make a mistake like that.

262
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:50,475
Is it Assistant Director Shin?

263
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:02,029
Yes, it's me. What happened?

264
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:04,448
Well…

265
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:06,616
Assistant Director Shin

266
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:09,661
uploaded the wrong file.

267
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:11,538
It's all my fault.

268
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:13,665
It happened while I was gone.

269
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:16,376
I'm not sure.

270
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,712
I don't know what that penguin is.

271
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:21,298
I wonder where it came from.

272
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:34,186
Senior Forecaster Um,
please get yourself together.

273
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:37,105
When I'm gone, you're the acting director.

274
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:41,943
Everyone's excited because we got
the path of the 14th typhoon.

275
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,361
Number 15 is about to hit.

276
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:45,655
I'm sorry. I have no excuse.

277
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:46,740
What…

278
00:22:46,823 --> 00:22:48,617
Please be understanding, Director Jin.

279
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:51,745
Senior Forecaster Um is beside himself.

280
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:55,749
His wife might divorce him.

281
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:58,168
What?

282
00:22:58,251 --> 00:23:00,921
Exactly. He's distracted.

283
00:23:01,004 --> 00:23:03,381
I should have paid more attention.

284
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:05,092
It's all my fault, Director Jin.

285
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:06,635
Why would you tell her that?

286
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:09,930
-What if she's on speakerphone?
-No, it's my fault, Director Jin.

287
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:11,181
-Assistant Director Shin?
-Well…

288
00:23:11,264 --> 00:23:13,850
I made a terrible mistake
when a typhoon is approaching.

289
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:16,937
This shouldn't have happened.

290
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:20,941
It's all my fault. I'll write an apology.

291
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:22,609
-No.
-If that's not enough,

292
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:24,111
have my salary reduced.

293
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:25,195
-Come on.
-What are you saying?

294
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:27,447
-No, it's my fault, Director Jin.
-Never mind.

295
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:28,907
-I should have checked.
-No.

296
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:30,700
-Stop it. It's my fault.
-No, it isn't.

297
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:32,994
No, Senior Forecaster Um
is about to be divorced.

298
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:34,955
-Ms. Oh, then--
-Come on.

299
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:36,581
-One at a time.
-Director Jin.

300
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:37,874
-Please talk one at a time.
-Yes.

301
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:40,168
-One at a time, please.
-It was my fault.

302
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:46,633
Yu-jin!

303
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:50,303
-Don't run. You'll fall.
-Ki-jun is here.

304
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:52,347
Ki-jun?

305
00:24:01,439 --> 00:24:02,816
Why are you here?

306
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:05,735
I told you I had something to say.

307
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:08,905
Hi.

308
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:10,657
-You're here.
-Ma'am.

309
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,701
Oh, yes. Thanks.

310
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:14,786
Yu-jin, go inside and eat this.

311
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,955
I have to get groceries for dinner.

312
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:18,123
It's okay.

313
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:22,460
You came all the way here,
so I'll make you dinner.

314
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:23,545
Okay?

315
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:27,716
Yu-jin.

316
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:36,558
I don't know what happened,
but you should comfort her.

317
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:40,353
She usually doesn't get mad like that.

318
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:41,479
Right.

319
00:24:47,944 --> 00:24:49,487
My wife wants a divorce.

320
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,406
Out of the blue?

321
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:56,620
I don't think it was out of the blue.

322
00:24:58,038 --> 00:24:59,581
So what did you tell her?

323
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:01,249
I couldn't say much.

324
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,792
Will you get a divorce?

325
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:07,088
She asked me not to give her a hard time.

326
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:10,383
She suffered all her life because of me.

327
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:11,968
Clinging to her now

328
00:25:12,552 --> 00:25:15,138
will make her suffer more, I think.

329
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:18,308
You need to change her mind.

330
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:20,977
How can I change her mind?

331
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:23,230
Persuade her or explain yourself.

332
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:24,397
Come up with a plan.

333
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:25,565
A plan?

334
00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:28,735
Don't you know Scenario 1, 2, 3?

335
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:37,994
Why did you come all the way here?

336
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:40,622
I came to see you, of course.

337
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:42,874
I had to do something

338
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:44,501
because I don't want to break up.

339
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:47,462
What will you do?
Is there anything left to do?

340
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:57,722
-Ki-jun.
-I'm sorry, Yu-jin.

341
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:01,393
I'm sorry I hurt you and made you upset.

342
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:03,311
It's all my fault.

343
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:05,355
What are you doing?

344
00:26:06,189 --> 00:26:07,315
Get up.

345
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:11,486
I said get up.

346
00:26:11,569 --> 00:26:13,446
Come to Seoul with me, Yu-jin.

347
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:16,074
Get up.

348
00:26:16,157 --> 00:26:18,827
If you say yes, I'll get up.

349
00:26:28,336 --> 00:26:29,629
-Get up.
-No.

350
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:31,214
Answer me first.

351
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:33,550
Yes, okay, so get up.

352
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:34,843
Really?

353
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:36,886
You'll come to Seoul with me then?

354
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,013
Okay, so get up.

355
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:41,558
Goodness.

356
00:26:57,824 --> 00:26:59,617
I admit that it was my fault,

357
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:01,911
but I can't tell you why it happened.

358
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:03,496
I'm sorry.

359
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:06,958
It's personal, so I can't tell you.

360
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:13,465
My husband can't seem
to focus on studying.

361
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:16,760
The exam is right around the corner.

362
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:21,681
But my mother-in-law says
she can't babysit the kids anymore.

363
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:23,350
PETITION FOR DIVORCE

364
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:25,101
My wife wants a divorce.

365
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:31,358
Let's…

366
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:34,778
break up.

367
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:44,287
What does the GDAPS show?

368
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:46,373
GDAPS: GLOBAL DATA ASSIMILATION
AND PREDICTION SYSTEM

369
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:50,460
It's moving faster
due to the influence of the upper jet.

370
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:53,088
I checked the vertical wind shear
and it's over 50.

371
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:54,964
Okay.

372
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:18,488
Did you find out who made the mistake?

373
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:20,490
Yes.

374
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:23,326
What an embarrassing moment for the KMA.

375
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:26,454
You make silly mistakes
because all you do is

376
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:30,250
sit comfortably in a chair
and look at the situation room monitors.

377
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:35,672
Haven't you ever made a mistake?

378
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:38,508
People at the typhoon center

379
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:41,052
work hard and get injured a lot

380
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:43,221
because they work on site.

381
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:45,098
I know that.

382
00:28:45,181 --> 00:28:47,475
But we go through a lot
at Headquarters too.

383
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:56,151
There's someone
who is about to be divorced.

384
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:58,945
From here to here.

385
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:00,613
Oh, hold on.

386
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:04,159
Hi, Mother. I'm sorry. I'm working.

387
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:05,702
Hold on. Can you send it to me?

388
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:07,328
I'm sorry.

389
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:10,832
There's someone who has to work to death

390
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:12,417
to support her family

391
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,711
while making apologies every day.

392
00:29:14,794 --> 00:29:16,254
Yes, I'm sorry.

393
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:24,387
There's someone who is too busy
to see the seasons change outside.

394
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:34,522
And there's someone

395
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:37,484
who is spending his youth
sacrificing his dating life for work.

396
00:29:41,237 --> 00:29:42,071
What?

397
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:45,992
Are we trying to show off
who's having a harder time?

398
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:47,494
No.

399
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:50,330
I'm saying that the typhoon center
and the situation room at Headquarters

400
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:53,208
are all doing the same hard work
within the KMA.

401
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:56,669
So stop weighing the gravity of our work

402
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:58,963
and taking sides, Director Sung.

403
00:30:08,264 --> 00:30:10,558
-Assistant Director Lee.
-Yes?

404
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:13,353
-Bring me the predicted scenario.
-Yes, ma'am.

405
00:30:35,124 --> 00:30:37,377
Why are you here at this hour?

406
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,586
Well…

407
00:30:40,296 --> 00:30:42,674
Give me some time, Hyang-rae.

408
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:44,801
Give me three months.

409
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:48,263
Let's have a grace period of three months.

410
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:50,557
What do you mean?

411
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,643
Honestly, I think this is really unfair.

412
00:30:53,726 --> 00:30:55,895
So for three months,

413
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:59,065
let's try living like a family.

414
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:03,027
Then I'll do whatever you want.

415
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:05,405
If you ask me for a divorce,

416
00:31:05,488 --> 00:31:06,906
I'll comply.

417
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:09,534
If you tell me
to get the hell out of Seoul, I will.

418
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:12,912
Do you think that will change anything?

419
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:14,330
Come on.

420
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:17,375
Even prisoners on death row
have a grace period.

421
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:22,255
Can't you at least give me that much time?

422
00:31:22,338 --> 00:31:25,216
You have to acknowledge
my dedication to this family.

423
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:30,805
Why aren't you at work?

424
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:34,726
It's lunchtime, so I ran here.

425
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:37,562
Go back to work.
You don't want to be late.

426
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:39,939
-Honey.
-Leave already.

427
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:47,590
Yes, Hyang-rae.

428
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:49,342
What's all this?

429
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:51,678
What?

430
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:56,391
That's…

431
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:58,309
A typhoon is coming.

432
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:01,187
This one will have strong winds.
So I put them up.

433
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:04,983
Hello?

434
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:07,819
Hyang-rae.

435
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:10,196
I don't think
I can do it for three months.

436
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:12,532
I see…

437
00:33:13,908 --> 00:33:15,118
Okay.

438
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:18,746
I'll give you two months.

439
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,666
Two months?

440
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:24,335
Do whatever you want for two months.

441
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:28,006
After two months,
you have to sign the divorce papers.

442
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:36,055
Okay. Thanks, Hyang-rae.

443
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:38,433
I'll really…

444
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:40,393
I'll do my best.

445
00:33:45,481 --> 00:33:46,733
Hello?

446
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:49,902
Thanks, Hyang-rae!

447
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:13,843
All right.

448
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:20,516
-It's new, so it's fluffy.
-Thank you.

449
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:24,270
It's a little damp in here, isn't it?

450
00:34:24,353 --> 00:34:27,023
I should have turned on the heat.

451
00:34:27,106 --> 00:34:28,399
It's okay, Mother.

452
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:31,235
Do you want me
to turn it on for a little bit?

453
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:33,571
It's okay. We'll take care of it.

454
00:34:34,363 --> 00:34:36,074
-Okay.
-All right.

455
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:37,909
-Good night.
-Okay.

456
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:39,869
-Good night.
-All right.

457
00:34:39,952 --> 00:34:41,287
-Thank you.
-Good night.

458
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:59,055
I told you to get a room at a motel.

459
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:05,019
Your dad asked me to sleep here.
How could I?

460
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:06,729
He's not my dad.

461
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:09,315
A stepdad is still a dad, Yu-jin.

462
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:10,858
Don't be like that to him.

463
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:14,362
-What did I do?
-You were so curt.

464
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:16,739
You didn't even look at him during dinner.

465
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:18,616
You don't know anything.

466
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:21,119
Right. I don't know anything.

467
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:24,580
It's just that
you're making him walk on eggshells.

468
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:27,166
That's why I hate him.
I hate him for doing that.

469
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:30,336
He isn't like that
around Mom and Dong-jin.

470
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:33,965
-It's because you--
-I know he's a good man.

471
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:35,716
He cares about Mom.

472
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,094
He's a good dad to Dong-jin,

473
00:35:38,177 --> 00:35:39,971
but there's no place for me here.

474
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:43,850
It's Mom's family, not mine.

475
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:46,686
That's why I wanted
to make my own family and…

476
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:48,062
And?

477
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:53,067
Never mind. Let's go to sleep.

478
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:56,154
Why don't you want to
register our marriage?

479
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:00,283
Do I have to repeat myself?

480
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:02,201
How can I trust you?

481
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:05,204
You're more worried about
what people think of us,

482
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:07,123
who Ha-kyung is dating,

483
00:36:07,206 --> 00:36:10,168
and how that affects us.

484
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:11,419
But it's…

485
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:15,047
But it's Lee Si-woo of all people.

486
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:17,008
So?

487
00:36:17,091 --> 00:36:19,510
What's bothering you the most? Be honest.

488
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:21,345
The fact that I lived with Si-woo?

489
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:23,556
Or that he's dating Ha-kyung?

490
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,183
Both.

491
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:28,811
I'm bothered by both. They upset me.

492
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:30,730
So let's come up with a conclusion.

493
00:36:30,813 --> 00:36:32,648
There's no conclusion, Yu-jin.

494
00:36:33,232 --> 00:36:35,234
You and I are married.
That's our conclusion.

495
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:36,694
So tell me if you regret it.

496
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,238
You can take it back.

497
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:45,244
Yu-jin, why are you doing this?

498
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:48,706
I knelt down and apologized.
Why can't we move on?

499
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:51,167
I'm sorry, but I can't live like you.

500
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:54,670
I can't pretend to be lovey-dovey
or act like we have no problem.

501
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:56,339
I don't want to be pretentious.

502
00:36:58,049 --> 00:36:59,926
I can't live like that.

503
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:01,552
Do you think I like doing that?

504
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:03,304
But everyone lives like that.

505
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:05,014
Married couples do that.

506
00:37:05,097 --> 00:37:07,642
I don't care if everyone does.
I can't live like that.

507
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:09,143
What do you want me to do?

508
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:10,186
So…

509
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:14,315
Why are you here giving me a hard time?

510
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,028
-Honey.
-What?

511
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:21,030
Did you make my daughter cry?

512
00:37:21,113 --> 00:37:22,448
-Honey.
-Sir, it's not what you think.

513
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:23,574
-Come out.
-Goodness.

514
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:24,992
-Sir.
-Come out!

515
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:26,160
-Oh, goodness.
-Wait.

516
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:28,246
You…

517
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:31,249
-You jerk.
-Yes?

518
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:33,209
Why did you make my daughter cry?

519
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:35,127
Sir, it's not what you think.

520
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:37,463
Honey, let go of him and talk.

521
00:37:37,546 --> 00:37:40,424
Hey, didn't I warn you before the wedding?

522
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:44,053
I told you I'd kill you
if you made my daughter cry, didn't I?

523
00:37:44,136 --> 00:37:45,721
You did.

524
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:46,973
But why did you make her cry?

525
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:49,517
How long have you been married?

526
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,310
It's only been a few months.

527
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:53,187
How dare you make her cry already?

528
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:54,647
-Why you--
-Dad! Stop it.

529
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:58,025
What?

530
00:37:58,651 --> 00:37:59,777
"Dad"?

531
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:02,154
I mean…

532
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:04,657
What's wrong with you?

533
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:11,455
This is our problem so you stay out of it.

534
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:15,626
-Let's go inside.
-Okay.

535
00:38:17,586 --> 00:38:18,754
Okay.

536
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:25,678
You heard it, right?

537
00:38:25,761 --> 00:38:28,014
She called me Dad, didn't she?

538
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:34,145
Let's go inside.
It's their problem to take care of.

539
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:36,564
-Let's go.
-She called me Dad.

540
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:39,233
Okay. Let's go inside.

541
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:41,068
Let's go.

542
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:56,208
For now,
the first scenario is the most likely.

543
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:58,377
Starting at the coast
of South Jeolla Province,

544
00:38:58,461 --> 00:39:00,254
it'll pass through the Korean Peninsula,

545
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:03,382
cause damage nationwide,
and then exit through Pohang.

546
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:07,553
The second scenario is
when it bends further to the east.

547
00:39:07,636 --> 00:39:09,972
There will be less damage than the former,

548
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:13,267
but the southern regions within the radius
of the typhoon will be hit.

549
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:14,852
What's the third scenario?

550
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:17,521
As the North Pacific's
anticyclone contracts,

551
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:21,317
it'll shift toward Kyushu along the edge
of the southern seas of Jeju.

552
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:25,821
It'll only slightly affect some parts
of the southern coast and Busan.

553
00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:29,742
If the North Pacific's anticyclone
contracts a little more,

554
00:39:29,825 --> 00:39:32,953
will it bend more eastward
like in the second scenario?

555
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:37,416
Given the current
North Pacific's anticyclone,

556
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,251
that's very unlikely.

557
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:41,087
Senior Forecaster Um.

558
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:44,924
Is there any possibility that it'll weaken
by changing course to the south?

559
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:48,094
Yes, there is.

560
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:51,222
But there's also a possibility
that it'll move quickly to the east

561
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:53,724
due to the northern jet stream.

562
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:57,728
That means it could move to the east.

563
00:39:58,312 --> 00:40:00,648
Yes. We can be more accurate

564
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:03,234
when the ground data comes in.

565
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:05,444
Is there a way for us to know sooner?

566
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:08,989
Well…

567
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:16,163
We could launch a sonde
at the eastern side of Jeju

568
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:18,457
-and at the sea west of the island.
-And?

569
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:22,920
But I'm sure you know it's highly
dangerous in these weather conditions.

570
00:40:23,003 --> 00:40:26,382
But it's the best we can do
at the moment, right?

571
00:40:29,301 --> 00:40:30,719
Why don't we do this?

572
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:33,722
Let's launch a sonde
only in the east Woljeong-ri area.

573
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:35,474
There will be some errors,

574
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:37,726
but it'll be better
than making a wild guess.

575
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:39,228
Then I'll go do it at sea.

576
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:51,782
Director Jin.

577
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:53,659
Have you made any sonde observations?

578
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:55,077
If you haven't,

579
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:58,372
you won't be able to launch a sonde
in this weather.

580
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:00,541
Director Jin. Listen carefully.

581
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:04,587
There's no such thing
as an accurate forecast.

582
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:07,131
Okay? We can only make predictions.

583
00:41:07,214 --> 00:41:08,757
You know what I mean?

584
00:41:09,508 --> 00:41:12,261
The 14th typhoon caused too much damage.

585
00:41:12,344 --> 00:41:14,597
We don't know how much more damage

586
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,765
the upcoming Typhoon Elisha will cause.

587
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:20,311
Even if they're just predictions,
I believe it is our duty to use

588
00:41:20,394 --> 00:41:22,813
the most accurate data possible
to make such predictions.

589
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:29,653
We can't afford to
get it wrong this time, sir.

00:42:10,986 --> 00:42:11,862
Why are you coming?

593
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:14,281
Do you think you can launch a sonde
just by heading out to sea?

594
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:16,158
On a day like this,

595
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:18,285
automatic observation may not work.

Weather Number One has arrived near Ieodo.

598
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,025
We're ready.

599
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:15,569
Let's float it at exactly 9 p.m.

600
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:16,737
Okay.

601
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:19,948
Director Jin. The winds are too strong.

602
00:44:20,032 --> 00:44:21,533
Automatic observation won't work.

603
00:44:22,117 --> 00:44:23,744
We'll have to do it manually.

604
00:44:27,414 --> 00:44:28,957
Can you do the countdown?

605
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:30,250
Yes, okay.

606
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:07,329
Five, four…

607
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:08,330
Three…

608
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:11,500
two, one!

609
00:46:23,071 --> 00:46:24,907
It worked. We're getting data.

610
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:39,588
It's coming.

611
00:46:39,671 --> 00:46:41,256
We're getting
the Ieodo sea observation data.

612
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:42,591
Are we?

613
00:46:49,681 --> 00:46:50,766
Okay.

614
00:46:53,435 --> 00:46:55,187
Yes. Did you get the observed value?

615
00:46:55,270 --> 00:46:56,813
We're feeding the data.

616
00:46:56,897 --> 00:46:58,398
We just need to check
the NWP model prediction data.

617
00:46:58,482 --> 00:47:00,984
When it's out, send it to me right away.

618
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:02,027
Okay.

619
00:47:07,616 --> 00:47:09,284
Your prediction was right.

620
00:47:09,368 --> 00:47:11,870
At this rate,
it'll move along the Southern Sea

621
00:47:11,954 --> 00:47:14,122
and cause damage
in some southern regions only.

622
00:47:21,838 --> 00:47:23,423
Did you get the NWP model?

623
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:25,133
Yes, I just saw it.

624
00:47:25,217 --> 00:47:27,344
We'll have to announce the course
as the South Sea.

625
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:28,929
No.

626
00:47:31,139 --> 00:47:32,933
-Pardon?
-That's the result,

627
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:35,269
but let's go with the first scenario.

628
00:47:35,852 --> 00:47:36,979
Are you sure?

629
00:47:37,604 --> 00:47:38,897
Yes.

630
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:41,358
I already told Director General Ko.

631
00:47:43,235 --> 00:47:44,444
Director Jin.

632
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:46,697
You know that
we'll all be reprimanded, right?

633
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:51,034
Yes, I know. I'll take responsibility.

634
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:54,246
Why would you take responsibility?

635
00:47:54,329 --> 00:47:56,415
If the typhoon deviates
from the expected course,

636
00:47:56,498 --> 00:47:59,293
I, the director of the typhoon center,
should take responsibility.

637
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:03,088
Will you let me?

638
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:12,889
All right.
Let's go with the first scenario.

639
00:48:14,182 --> 00:48:16,268
Good work, Director Jin.

640
00:48:16,351 --> 00:48:17,311
Good work.

641
00:48:26,695 --> 00:48:29,573
PRESS RELEASE

642
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:32,451
Sorry?

643
00:48:32,534 --> 00:48:34,286
An excessive forecast?

644
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:36,622
Yes.

645
00:48:36,705 --> 00:48:39,499
Director Jin wants to go
with the first scenario.

646
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,836
If the effect of the northern jet stream
is weaker than expected,

647
00:48:42,919 --> 00:48:44,755
it'll move slower to the east.

648
00:48:44,838 --> 00:48:47,841
So let's prepare in case
it enters the southern inland of Korea.

649
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:50,427
Still, is an excessive forecast necessary?

650
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:52,054
The purpose of forecasting

651
00:48:52,137 --> 00:48:55,182
is to protect the lives
and safety of the people.

652
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:57,934
I learned that being right
or wrong doesn't matter.

653
00:48:59,227 --> 00:49:01,146
All right, Director Jin.

654
00:49:01,229 --> 00:49:03,607
I'll tell the Office of Spokesperson
as ordered.

TO THE SOUTHERN SEA OF JEJU

656
00:49:10,405 --> 00:49:12,658
EXPECTED TO HIT
THE SOUTHERN COAST AT DAWN

Breaking news.

661
00:49:24,544 --> 00:49:27,214
Typhoon Elisha, the 15th typhoon,
which was heading north,

662
00:49:27,297 --> 00:49:29,758
is expected to go through
the Korean Peninsula

663
00:49:29,841 --> 00:49:32,761
starting from the southern coast
of South Jeolla Province at dawn tomorrow.

664
00:49:32,844 --> 00:49:34,680
According to the KMA,

665
00:49:34,763 --> 00:49:37,140
Typhoon Elisha is a strong typhoon

666
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:39,685
with a central wind speed

667
00:49:39,768 --> 00:49:41,311
-of 30m per second.
-Bo-mi.

668
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:43,313
Did you run home because of that?

669
00:49:44,189 --> 00:49:45,065
Yes.

670
00:49:45,148 --> 00:49:46,650
Because it's Dad's forecast.

671
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:51,655
Since when have you been
so interested in your dad's work?

672
00:49:51,738 --> 00:49:54,950
The KMA added that people
should watch out for damage

673
00:49:55,033 --> 00:49:57,577
due to strong winds
and heavy rain overnight.

674
00:49:58,870 --> 00:50:00,122
-Assistant Director Shin.
-Yes.

675
00:50:00,205 --> 00:50:01,998
Give the statistics
to Assistant Director Oh.

676
00:50:02,082 --> 00:50:03,625
-And bring the data.
-Okay.

677
00:50:06,753 --> 00:50:09,464
Soo-jin, this is information
on the typhoon.

678
00:50:09,548 --> 00:50:10,966
-Oh, okay.
-Deliver it to them.

679
00:50:11,049 --> 00:50:12,134
Thank you.

680
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:18,098
Like this.

681
00:50:27,607 --> 00:50:28,817
It's done.

682
00:50:29,901 --> 00:50:32,863
So are we going with the first scenario?

683
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:34,906
Yes.

684
00:50:52,674 --> 00:50:54,843
It's my turn now.

685
00:50:56,261 --> 00:51:00,974
Which scenario should I choose
in breaking up with you?

686
00:51:02,267 --> 00:51:05,145
Scenario one. Cling to you.

687
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:09,816
Scenario two.

688
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,611
Break up on a high note.

689
00:51:15,238 --> 00:51:16,406
Scenario three.

690
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:21,411
Drag it out as much as I can.

691
00:51:29,211 --> 00:51:31,838
So what's your decision?

692
00:51:39,387 --> 00:51:40,806
Give me a little more time.

693
00:52:07,749 --> 00:52:08,834
What is it?

694
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:11,878
Did something go wrong at work?

695
00:52:13,421 --> 00:52:14,714
I don't think…

696
00:52:16,883 --> 00:52:18,260
I can do this.

697
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:20,637
What do you mean?

698
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,639
I can't see you, Tae-kyung.

699
00:52:23,932 --> 00:52:27,894
I'm not good at focusing
on more than one thing.

700
00:52:28,603 --> 00:52:29,813
And?

701
00:52:29,896 --> 00:52:31,064
But…

702
00:52:31,815 --> 00:52:33,984
since I met you,

703
00:52:34,693 --> 00:52:37,737
I keep getting my priorities mixed up.

704
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:38,822
But…

705
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:41,408
I shouldn't do that at the KMA.

706
00:52:41,491 --> 00:52:43,910
What was your priority before?

707
00:52:44,661 --> 00:52:46,955
It was the KMA and the weather, of course.

708
00:52:47,038 --> 00:52:49,499
What is it now?

709
00:53:00,135 --> 00:53:00,969
Me?

710
00:53:04,723 --> 00:53:06,099
Normally…

711
00:53:06,975 --> 00:53:09,311
I'm not like this.

712
00:53:09,394 --> 00:53:10,353
Okay?

713
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:14,900
I mean, I have never
mixed business with pleasure.

714
00:53:14,983 --> 00:53:17,277
I have never broken those rules

715
00:53:17,944 --> 00:53:20,030
because I'm rational and logical.

716
00:53:20,113 --> 00:53:22,449
-But…
-But what?

717
00:53:24,409 --> 00:53:26,536
Now I'm having an identity crisis.

718
00:53:28,663 --> 00:53:32,125
I don't know what to do
with this unpredictable feeling.

719
00:53:32,626 --> 00:53:36,171
If I make a big mistake,
it'll cause great public interest damages.

720
00:53:36,254 --> 00:53:38,006
Then I'll be terribly ashamed.

721
00:53:38,089 --> 00:53:40,008
I'll regret what I did and feel dejected.

722
00:53:40,091 --> 00:53:42,552
-Then I'll--
-Mr. Shin Seok-ho!

723
00:53:42,636 --> 00:53:43,637
Yes?

724
00:54:02,238 --> 00:54:03,782
I like you too.

725
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:08,703
Really?

726
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:12,832
Do you want dinner?

727
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:16,127
Let's have mung bean pancakes
with rice wine.

728
00:54:16,211 --> 00:54:17,337
Let's go.

729
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:25,553
Wait for me, Tae-kyung.

730
00:54:31,476 --> 00:54:32,394
Tae-kyung!

731
00:54:56,501 --> 00:54:58,169
-Nice!
-Yes!

732
00:54:58,253 --> 00:55:00,338
I wish I can
get the answers right like this.

733
00:55:00,422 --> 00:55:03,091
Exactly.
You're hitting them really well today.

734
00:55:11,182 --> 00:55:13,226
-Let me go again.
-Sure.

735
00:55:13,309 --> 00:55:15,478
-I have spare change.
-You're good today.

736
00:55:24,029 --> 00:55:26,197
What are you doing here?

737
00:55:27,073 --> 00:55:28,867
What brings you here?

738
00:55:29,451 --> 00:55:31,369
I told you it was Dad.

739
00:55:31,453 --> 00:55:33,663
I saw him come here.

740
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:35,874
He was here yesterday and the day before.

741
00:55:35,957 --> 00:55:38,001
Right, Dad? I got you, right?

742
00:55:55,393 --> 00:55:57,854
You have three scenarios.

743
00:55:59,147 --> 00:56:00,356
"Scenarios"?

744
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:01,900
First.

745
00:56:02,525 --> 00:56:03,693
Go back to work.

746
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:06,112
-Honey.
-Second.

747
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:08,198
Get divorced.

748
00:56:09,324 --> 00:56:11,159
-Honey.
-Third.

749
00:56:11,242 --> 00:56:12,994
Study like your life depends on it.

750
00:56:20,627 --> 00:56:23,880
Do you think I like supporting you?

751
00:56:23,963 --> 00:56:26,508
Because you said it was your dream,
I gave you a chance

752
00:56:27,342 --> 00:56:29,427
to give it a try before it was too late.

753
00:56:30,095 --> 00:56:31,888
So you wouldn't have any regrets.

754
00:56:31,971 --> 00:56:34,849
I thought this could be your last chance,

755
00:56:35,433 --> 00:56:37,352
so I let you study

756
00:56:37,435 --> 00:56:39,687
even though I was really tired.

757
00:56:40,396 --> 00:56:41,815
What did you say?

758
00:56:42,649 --> 00:56:44,275
Stressed out from studying?

759
00:56:51,616 --> 00:56:55,203
Don't you feel sorry at all
for making such excuses?

760
00:56:55,286 --> 00:56:57,038
Don't you feel sorry towards our kids?

761
00:57:05,046 --> 00:57:07,215
Don't you know your mom is suffering too?

762
00:57:07,298 --> 00:57:09,884
She's too old
to take care of those boys every day.

763
00:57:15,723 --> 00:57:16,808
Myung-ju.

764
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:18,852
I'm sorry.

765
00:57:19,978 --> 00:57:21,354
I made a huge mistake.

766
00:57:25,608 --> 00:57:26,693
Make a choice.

767
00:57:27,861 --> 00:57:29,237
Is it scenario one,

768
00:57:29,821 --> 00:57:30,864
two, or three?

769
00:57:40,206 --> 00:57:43,376
I can't believe it. That's so stupid.

770
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:46,087
Typhoon Elisha, the 15th typhoon,
which was expected to hit Korea

771
00:57:46,171 --> 00:57:47,714
early this morning,

772
00:57:47,797 --> 00:57:50,467
-Bo-mi. Were you here all night?
-passed through the South Sea

773
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:53,511
-at 4 a.m.
-I don't know. I'm so mad.

774
00:57:53,595 --> 00:57:55,513
-What's wrong?
-Currently the typhoon

775
00:57:55,597 --> 00:57:57,265
-The forecast.
-is still active.

776
00:57:57,348 --> 00:57:59,559
Around 11 a.m., it'll weaken
due to the extratropical cyclone

777
00:57:59,642 --> 00:58:01,060
and then gradually disappear.

778
00:58:01,644 --> 00:58:05,690
Contrary to the KMA's prediction
that the typhoon would hit the inland…

779
00:58:05,773 --> 00:58:07,442
Is that it?

780
00:58:07,525 --> 00:58:09,527
Why did he get it wrong?

781
00:58:09,611 --> 00:58:11,946
He was right on the nose with Number 14.

782
00:58:12,572 --> 00:58:14,491
So what if the forecast was wrong?

783
00:58:14,574 --> 00:58:17,744
I'm glad there was no damage
even though it was wrong.

784
00:58:21,456 --> 00:58:22,415
What?

785
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:24,584
Goosebumps.

786
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:26,794
What was that, Mom?

787
00:58:26,878 --> 00:58:29,172
I thought there was nothing left
between you two

788
00:58:29,255 --> 00:58:31,174
because you were apart for so long.

789
00:58:31,257 --> 00:58:32,383
And?

790
00:58:32,467 --> 00:58:34,344
You sound like you work for the KMA.

791
00:58:35,762 --> 00:58:38,097
Stop being silly and get ready for school.

792
00:58:38,181 --> 00:58:39,557
I'll make breakfast.

793
00:58:43,561 --> 00:58:44,771
Honey.

794
00:58:45,897 --> 00:58:46,773
Bo-mi.

795
00:58:47,357 --> 00:58:48,816
I brought hangover soup.

796
00:58:49,442 --> 00:58:50,777
Hangover soup?

797
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:51,945
What?

798
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:53,780
You used to love it when you were little.

799
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:56,866
That was a long time ago.

800
00:58:56,950 --> 00:58:59,369
I know. That restaurant
is still in business.

801
00:58:59,953 --> 00:59:01,037
It's really busy.

802
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:04,332
Did you have breakfast?
Don't cook. Let's eat this.

803
00:59:04,415 --> 00:59:05,416
Come.

804
00:59:07,627 --> 00:59:11,339
I asked them for a lot of clotted blood.

805
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:13,800
You like it, right?

806
00:59:13,883 --> 00:59:16,427
It smells great.

807
00:59:17,136 --> 00:59:19,847
Doesn't it? I need a bowl.

808
00:59:19,931 --> 00:59:21,307
-They're here.
-Okay.

809
00:59:21,975 --> 00:59:23,601
We need spoons too.

810
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:27,730
Wait a minute.

811
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:30,358
Is there enough space?

812
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:33,861
Sure, you can place them there.

813
00:59:33,945 --> 00:59:35,196
We just need spoons.

814
01:00:24,245 --> 01:00:26,164
I can't believe them.

815
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:40,511
Put this on.

816
01:00:55,318 --> 01:00:56,486
How is your eye?

817
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:02,742
I think it's okay.

818
01:01:03,368 --> 01:01:05,620
You didn't have to follow me to the boat.

819
01:01:08,539 --> 01:01:09,582
I told you.

820
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:12,210
You need experience to float a sonde.

821
01:01:15,171 --> 01:01:16,339
Also…

822
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:18,758
I had the same idea as you.

823
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:23,513
I thought Typhoon Elisha would
move to the eastern outskirts of Korea.

824
01:01:27,183 --> 01:01:29,060
I came out here

825
01:01:29,602 --> 01:01:31,104
just to check it for myself.

826
01:01:35,650 --> 01:01:37,110
Will you be all right?

827
01:01:40,822 --> 01:01:42,615
After breaking up with me,

828
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:44,492
will you be able to work with me?

829
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:50,456
Will you be okay, Director Jin?

830
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:03,386
I'll be fine.

831
01:02:05,930 --> 01:02:07,390
I'll be okay.

832
01:02:11,519 --> 01:02:12,895
Let's break up.

833
01:02:19,610 --> 01:02:21,237
Let's break up, Si-woo.

834
01:02:35,501 --> 01:02:36,586
Okay.

835
01:02:48,514 --> 01:02:50,558
The cause of typhoons

836
01:02:50,641 --> 01:02:53,186
is to resolve the thermal imbalance

837
01:02:53,269 --> 01:02:55,772
caused by the rotation of the Earth.

838
01:02:58,733 --> 01:03:02,779
Contrary to the KMA's prediction
that the typhoon would hit the inland,

839
01:03:02,862 --> 01:03:04,655
it passed without much damage.

840
01:03:04,739 --> 01:03:07,408
-As a result, confidence
-I'm sorry.

841
01:03:07,492 --> 01:03:11,078
-in the KMA's forecast has fallen.
-Yes, I checked it.

Well…

845
01:03:15,124 --> 01:03:17,084
YOU SAID THE TYPHOON WAS COMING!
WHERE IS ELISHA?

846
01:03:19,796 --> 01:03:20,755
Yes.

847
01:03:21,756 --> 01:03:24,801
Yes. I'll report to you again.

848
01:03:29,305 --> 01:03:30,431
Jeez.

849
01:03:34,727 --> 01:03:36,979
STOP EXCESSIVE FORECASTS.
WE WANT AN ACCURATE WEATHER REPORT.

850
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:42,193
This typhoon may be hard on us right now…

851
01:03:50,952 --> 01:03:52,662
but in the long run,

852
01:03:52,745 --> 01:03:56,082
it'll be beneficial to everyone.

853
01:04:16,644 --> 01:04:17,728
If only…

854
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:21,983
we could get through this moment.

See you in the office.

857
01:04:48,467 --> 01:04:50,052
What should I do with your stuff?

858
01:04:51,053 --> 01:04:52,179
Oh, right…

859
01:04:52,263 --> 01:04:54,223
I'll take them on my next day off.

860
01:04:56,100 --> 01:04:57,143
Okay.

861
01:04:58,769 --> 01:04:59,812
All right.

862
01:05:34,513 --> 01:05:37,350
Why are you standing there like that?
This is your house.

-Enjoy your lunch.
-Enjoy your lunch.

866
01:06:25,690 --> 01:06:26,565
Si-woo.

867
01:06:28,526 --> 01:06:30,111
Hello.

868
01:06:33,739 --> 01:06:36,492
I heard you're dating Director Jin.

869
01:06:37,743 --> 01:06:38,744
What?

870
01:06:38,828 --> 01:06:41,330
I'm so sorry

871
01:06:41,414 --> 01:06:43,249
I came between you two.

872
01:06:43,332 --> 01:06:44,917
It must have been uncomfortable.

873
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:46,961
Were you already dating
when we stayed at her place?

874
01:06:48,546 --> 01:06:51,507
Where did you hear that from?

875
01:06:51,590 --> 01:06:53,217
It wasn't from anyone specific.

876
01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:55,678
Everyone on our team knew except me.

877
01:06:56,554 --> 01:06:58,389
Everyone?

878
01:06:58,472 --> 01:06:59,765
Everyone.

879
01:07:00,349 --> 01:07:02,685
By the way, you're so daring.

880
01:07:02,768 --> 01:07:04,353
I can't believe you're having

881
01:07:04,437 --> 01:07:07,773
an office romance
with none other than Director Jin.

882
01:07:07,857 --> 01:07:09,734
Forecaster Lee is dating Director Jin.

883
01:07:09,817 --> 01:07:11,360
-Is Director Jin dating someone at work?
-You know what?

884
01:07:11,444 --> 01:07:14,113
-Since when?
-I'm really happy for you.

885
01:07:15,281 --> 01:07:18,117
You two look great together.

886
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:20,453
I'm sincerely happy for you.

887
01:07:21,495 --> 01:07:23,080
I also feel bad

888
01:07:23,622 --> 01:07:25,499
because I've been so slow-witted.

889
01:07:25,583 --> 01:07:27,209
Director Jin is dating that guy.

890
01:07:27,293 --> 01:07:29,211
Director Jin sure got it going on.

891
01:07:29,295 --> 01:07:31,756
-I'm jealous.
-I'm so jealous.

892
01:07:31,839 --> 01:07:33,049
-She's got everything.
-She's competent.

893
01:07:33,132 --> 01:07:34,633
Congratulations!

894
01:07:59,366 --> 01:08:01,368
Director Jin!

895
01:08:11,754 --> 01:08:13,089
Are you here for your stuff?

896
01:08:13,172 --> 01:08:15,257
I said I'd bring it to you. Wait here.

897
01:08:15,341 --> 01:08:17,093
There's a problem.

898
01:08:17,718 --> 01:08:18,719
What problem?

899
01:08:18,803 --> 01:08:20,596
They found out.

900
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:22,765
Found out what?

901
01:08:22,848 --> 01:08:24,475
That we dated.

902
01:08:25,392 --> 01:08:26,227
What?

903
01:08:26,310 --> 01:08:28,437
Everyone on our team found out

904
01:08:28,521 --> 01:08:31,065
that you and I dated.

905
01:08:31,148 --> 01:08:32,358
What?

906
01:08:32,942 --> 01:08:33,984
You scared me.

907
01:08:38,322 --> 01:08:41,283
I knew it.

908
01:08:41,867 --> 01:08:42,743
So that means

909
01:08:42,827 --> 01:08:46,038
-you two dated at work. Is that right?
-Mom, that's--

910
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:49,291
I knew there was something going on.

911
01:08:50,626 --> 01:08:52,962
-It's a misunderstanding.
-Misunderstanding, my foot.

912
01:08:56,674 --> 01:08:58,968
I knew you'd deny it.

913
01:08:59,051 --> 01:09:01,887
So I got evidence.

914
01:09:09,019 --> 01:09:10,479
Will you deny it?

915
01:09:10,563 --> 01:09:11,939
Will you still deny it?

916
01:09:59,820 --> 01:10:03,616
People are taking it
more seriously than they should.

917
01:10:03,699 --> 01:10:06,577
Ignore them.
Don't listen to them or reply.

918
01:10:06,660 --> 01:10:08,913
But I made dumpling soup, your favorite.

919
01:10:08,996 --> 01:10:10,497
-Are you ill?
-I just have a stomachache.

920
01:10:10,581 --> 01:10:12,583
I thought he'd be much more mature.

921
01:10:12,666 --> 01:10:13,709
But he turned out to be a baby.

922
01:10:13,792 --> 01:10:15,211
You must really love him.

923
01:10:15,294 --> 01:10:17,296
We broke up.

924
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:20,507
You can't maintain
a relationship if it's one-sided.

925
01:10:21,217 --> 01:10:22,134
Where should we go?

926
01:10:23,093 --> 01:10:24,762
I have something to tell you.

927
01:10:24,845 --> 01:10:28,641
To be honest, Forecaster Lee and I…

928
01:10:28,724 --> 01:10:32,811
