00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:09,092
A NETFLIX SERIES

2
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:47,005
How much longer do we need to walk?

3
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:48,173
Be quiet. Just come.

4
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:49,924
Why were they all there?

5
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:51,509
Did you call that scumbag, Si-woo?

6
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:54,512
What's it to you?

7
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:56,681
How dare you come here
at this hour and cause a scene?

8
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:57,891
Why?

9
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:00,894
Hey, Ha-kyung.

10
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:03,063
Don't scare me like that.

11
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:06,316
I'm scaring you? Is it okay
when you do it but scary when I do?

12
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:11,029
Don't be so mean to me.

13
00:01:11,112 --> 00:01:14,157
I came here to apologize to you.

14
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:16,284
What?

15
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:19,913
I'm sorry, Ha-kyung.

16
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:24,834
I'm sorry.

17
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:26,753
I mean it.

18
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:30,507
I'm truly sorry.

19
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:35,887
I'm a real asshole.

20
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,144
Didn't they call off their marriage?

21
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:45,188
They did.

22
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:47,649
Then why did he come here?

23
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:49,484
I'm not sure.

24
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:53,988
He seemed pretty wasted.

25
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:55,448
Shouldn't we check on them?

26
00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:58,785
They'll take care of it.

27
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:03,081
I'll go.

28
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:11,214
I should get going too.

29
00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:13,591
Seok-ho.

30
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:17,679
You live right upstairs?

31
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:19,055
Yes. Why?

32
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,223
I see.

33
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:23,852
To be honest…

34
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:27,272
I don't feel comfortable here.

35
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:28,940
So I think--

36
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:31,317
-You'll get used to it.
-Right?

37
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:33,194
Of course. Rest up.

38
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:34,696
Okay. Good night.

39
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:39,033
What a rigid guy.

40
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:50,503
Were you in this much pain too?

41
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:54,090
What are you rambling about?

42
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:04,392
When I betrayed you,

43
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:06,728
did you also feel like

44
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:10,773
your heart was being ripped into pieces?

45
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:12,400
No.

46
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:14,319
My heart tore into pieces

47
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:17,530
because I was humiliated,
not because I was heartbroken.

48
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:21,701
So please stop embarrassing me
and just go home. Okay?

49
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,248
I see.

50
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,711
My dear Ha-kyung was humiliated.

51
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:35,632
So that was why you were in pain.

52
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:39,135
Hey. Can you please…

53
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:42,055
Are you crazy?
What's wrong with you today?

54
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:43,723
Ha-kyung.

55
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:47,310
I think I'm being punished.

56
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:48,353
What?

57
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:52,899
I'm being punished for betraying you.

58
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:00,198
Hey, quit putting on a show.

59
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:02,492
I'm still not going
to proofread your manuscript.

60
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:04,577
Lee Si-woo…

61
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,873
and Yu-jin

62
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:13,127
had lived together
before she and I got married.

63
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,422
What should I do, Ha-kyung?

64
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:20,468
After all that I did to marry her?

65
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:25,431
I gave you the worst heartbreak ever

66
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:28,726
and became a terrible asshole.

67
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:32,605
So how could she do this to me?

68
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:38,611
How could she lie through her teeth?

69
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:42,865
Let's get the facts straight.

70
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:46,244
She didn't lie. She just didn't tell you.

71
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,497
And you guys are already married.

72
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,249
How would she feel

73
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:53,960
to see you in pain
because of her undisclosed past?

74
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:57,046
If you truly love someone,

75
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:00,842
you should be able to embrace their past.

76
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,263
Understood, Ki-jun?

77
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:08,683
Are you sleeping?

78
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:10,643
Hey.

79
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,354
Hey.

80
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,815
Are you crazy? Get off me.

81
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:16,983
Wake up.

82
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:19,861
Hey.

83
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:25,616
Si-woo.

84
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,493
Do you know where he lives?

85
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,997
No, I don't.

86
00:05:56,606 --> 00:06:02,361
LEE SI-WOO

87
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:07,283
LEE SI-WOO

88
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:09,577
Yes?

89
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:11,829
Why are you calling me at this hour?

90
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:31,557
Ki-jun.

91
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,519
I'm sorry.

92
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:36,854
I am.

93
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,065
What happened?

94
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,902
Why are you dropping him off?

95
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:45,571
Ask him if you're curious.

96
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:49,242
Here.

97
00:06:58,292 --> 00:06:59,585
It's okay. Let me.

98
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:02,505
Why did you drink so much?

99
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:04,549
Ki-jun.

100
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:07,218
Wake up, Ki-jun. Okay?

101
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:10,847
Can you please wake up?

102
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,769
Who did he drink this much with?

103
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,814
I'm sorry.

104
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:21,858
I am.

105
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:23,734
Do you feel guilty?

106
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:27,405
I'm truly sorry,

107
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:29,365
Ha-kyung.

108
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:33,661
I am

109
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:38,499
really sorry, Ha-kyung.

110
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:32,470
Mischievous weather
doesn't only pertain to cloudy skies,

111
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:34,847
unexpected snow or rain,

112
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:39,268
harsh winds, and typhoons.

113
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,817
Why are you still out here?

114
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:50,196
Did you drop him home?

115
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:54,033
I'm sorry for making you do that.

116
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:55,993
Let's go.

117
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:57,870
Were you upset too?

118
00:08:58,454 --> 00:08:59,413
What do you mean?

119
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,707
When I told you

120
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:04,001
that I had lived with Yu-jin.

121
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:06,504
Hot weather and high humidity

122
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:08,881
strangely provoke you.

123
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:10,883
Did you also feel betrayed

124
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:13,094
like Ki-jun did?

125
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:18,432
Well…

126
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:20,977
I didn't feel betrayed.

127
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:24,313
But I wasn't too happy
to hear about it either.

128
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:27,066
Just like when I heard

129
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:30,820
about how you had written
his columns for him?

130
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:35,283
-You become cranky for no reason.
-Was it a similar feeling?

131
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:36,867
How did you know about that?

132
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,580
I just did.

133
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:42,206
Then why didn't you tell me?

134
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,541
Would it have changed anything?

135
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:46,502
You pick a fight for no apparent reason.

136
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,546
What is this?
Are you picking a fight with me?

137
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:50,631
Then at least say something.

138
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:54,594
We become victims of mischievous weather

139
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:58,389
when we least expect it.

140
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:07,940
Hey.

141
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:32,465
Hey, you--

142
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:44,352
Goodness, it's steaming hot in here.

143
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:52,443
EPISODE 8
DISCOMFORT INDEX

144
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,248
What happened last night?

145
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,252
What do you mean?

146
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:53,754
You were completely wasted,

147
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:56,841
and Si-woo, of all people,
dropped you off.

148
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:59,718
-Do you not remember?
-Let's talk about it later.

149
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:02,721
No, explain it to me now.
I have to hear it right now.

150
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:07,685
Let's just talk later, Yu-jin.

151
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:12,064
What's wrong? Is something going on?

152
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,193
I just need…

153
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:19,405
some time to think.

154
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,365
Bye.

155
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:39,258
You should have just let them be.
I was going to clean up this morning.

156
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:42,386
Please clean up after yourself
right away next time.

157
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,513
It's not easy to get rid of the smell.

158
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:46,724
Okay. I'll do that.

159
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:50,728
Good morning…

160
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:55,232
Microwavable food, top left shelf.
Plates and cutlery, top right shelf.

161
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:57,902
Ingredients such as
bread, butter, jams, and milk

162
00:12:57,985 --> 00:13:00,279
are all inside the fridge.

163
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:01,739
Help yourself to breakfast.

164
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:04,575
See you later.

165
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:06,285
Okay. Bye.

166
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:09,038
We'll go to work soon.

167
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:17,630
Do you want some ramyeon?

168
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:19,173
-What?
-Where is it?

169
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:22,176
The ramyeon is here.

170
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:24,887
In here.

171
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,848
And the pots

172
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:30,434
-are over here.
-What?

173
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:34,021
How did you know?

174
00:13:34,813 --> 00:13:35,940
Well…

175
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:38,484
She just told us before she left.

176
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:40,569
-Right.
-That's why.

177
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,239
I'll boil the water.

178
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:44,532
-Okay.
-Okay.

179
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:50,162
Gosh. It's scorching hot this morning.

180
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:52,122
-I'm going to shower first.
-Okay.

181
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:03,300
Seoul will be hot this afternoon
with a temperature of over 30°C.

182
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:04,635
It's quite humid as well.

183
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:07,680
The discomfort index is 76.7.

184
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:09,431
This is considered fairly high,

185
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:12,518
and about half of the population
can easily get cranky.

186
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:15,229
Although the temperature
hasn't changed much,

187
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:17,773
the increase in humidity

188
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:20,317
has made us more uncomfortable.

189
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:22,736
The highest temperature is 31°C in Seoul

190
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,071
and 30°C in Cheongju.

191
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:25,823
Just like when I heard

192
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:29,577
about how you had written
his columns for him?

193
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,662
Was it a similar feeling?

194
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:47,177
Why isn't it working?

195
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:00,274
Damn it.

196
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:08,449
Soo-jin.

197
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:10,534
-Look at this.
-Hello.

198
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:12,828
-Hello.
-Hello.

199
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:15,372
-Hello.
-Hello.

200
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,000
KOREA METEOROLOGICAL ADMINISTRATION

201
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:19,960
Did you eat already?

202
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,421
Make sure you eat before work.

203
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:24,131
-Hello.
-Goodness.

204
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:36,852
Thank you.

205
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:39,188
Don't you feel hot?

206
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,483
Not really. Maybe it's just a feeling.

207
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:46,236
We had countless analyses
and discussions about this.

208
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:50,032
The rainy season has finally started.

209
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:51,492
You could just be tense.

210
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:52,576
Maybe.

211
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:54,578
Why is it suddenly so hot?

212
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:56,372
I told you.

213
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:03,045
Let me check.

214
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:08,884
Hello, this is the Chief Team
of the Forecast Bureau.

215
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,928
I think there's a problem
with the AC here.

216
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:13,305
Really?

217
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,433
But we're having a meeting soon.

218
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:19,853
Okay. Please hurry.

219
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:24,316
-Hello.
-Good morning.

220
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:27,653
Why is it so hot in here?

221
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:30,114
There's a problem
with the central cooling system.

222
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:32,449
Maintenance is looking into it right now.

223
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:35,327
Really? It just had to
break down on the hottest day.

224
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:36,495
Right?

225
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:39,039
Why isn't Director Jin here yet?

226
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:41,583
I'm not sure.

227
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:44,253
She left before we did.

228
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:55,931
Hey, Ha-kyung. What is it?

229
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,225
Isn't Areum Insurance
the insurance company for my car?

230
00:16:58,308 --> 00:17:01,979
Oh, that? I changed it
to Sang-hun's company six months ago.

231
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:03,772
Without telling me?

232
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:09,695
Excuse me.

233
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:11,447
Call your insurance company.

234
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,365
That's why I'm on the phone right now.

235
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:16,076
Okay. What's the name of the company?

236
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,954
-I'm in a hurry.
-I get it.

237
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:22,499
Where are you? I'll go.

238
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:23,500
Forget it.

239
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:25,753
Just tell me the name
of the insurance company.

240
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:29,006
I'll call them myself.
Just tell me where you are.

241
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:34,136
The person you are trying to reach
is unavailable. Please try again…

242
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:39,433
Okay.

243
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:42,811
I hope everything works out. Okay, bye.

244
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:45,105
-Sir.
-Yes?

245
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:48,484
-Director Jin got into a car accident.
-What?

246
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:50,569
Oh, dear.

247
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:52,613
Is she hurt?

248
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:54,490
No, she's not.

249
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:56,450
I'll lead the meeting today.

250
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:57,534
Okay.

251
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,497
She got into an accident today

252
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,582
when we had an important briefing?

253
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:08,087
Gosh. Could this be an omen?

254
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:10,422
Don't jinx it.

255
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:12,925
Everyone's already on edge
due to the high discomfort index.

256
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:15,302
Be careful what you say today, Ms. Kim.

257
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:16,428
Yes, ma'am.

258
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,604
Excuse me. Where is Spokesperson Han?

259
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:29,358
Something urgent came up,
so he asked me to take over for him.

260
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:41,370
We'll begin the meeting of June 27.

261
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:42,871
Satellite Center?

262
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:46,416
Judging by the satellite imagery
and the weather chart,

263
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:50,295
there's a stationary front
on the very south side of Jeju Island.

264
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:52,589
I heard you crashed your car.

265
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:54,758
Call me when you read this.

266
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:03,142
It'll be taken care of quickly
since no one was hurt.

267
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:06,019
-Thank you.
-Please sign here.

268
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:12,025
I'll call you later.

269
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:45,225
I told you not to come,
so why are you here?

270
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:47,227
I spoke with Sang-hun on my way here.

271
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:50,355
He said he'll take care
of the collision coverage himself

272
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:51,565
and call you afterward.

273
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:54,193
Why did you change
the company without telling me?

274
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:55,611
Do you know how flustered I was?

275
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:57,654
I'm sorry.

276
00:19:57,738 --> 00:20:00,199
We had agreed to share the car
once we got married.

277
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:02,701
The contract ended,
so I just helped out a friend.

278
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:05,078
Who knew we'd break up?

279
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:07,372
You're always like this.
You decide on your own,

280
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:09,333
cause a mess, and I have to deal with it.

281
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:11,376
That's why I'm here.

282
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,503
I'm not glad to see you,
so don't do this again.

283
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:15,881
Fine. Get in the car.
We're late for the meeting.

284
00:20:16,506 --> 00:20:17,466
I'm okay.

285
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,677
Senior Forecaster Um
will lead the meeting.

286
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:22,304
Since I'm late, I can just take a cab.

287
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:23,388
What?

288
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:26,391
Do you think a cab will
pick you up at an underpass?

289
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:33,065
I HEARD YOU CRASHED YOUR CAR.
CALL ME WHEN YOU READ THIS.

290
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:37,694
So you're saying that in five days,
the stationary front will cause rain

291
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:41,281
to fall in Jeju
and the southern provinces?

292
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:45,494
We should continue monitoring
the ocean's atmosphere.

293
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:48,664
If the front suddenly switches directions
from north to south,

294
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:50,374
there may be a delay.

295
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:54,544
It'll be fine since the anticyclone
of the North Pacific is below it.

296
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:59,007
If anything, it might rain
a day or two early.

297
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,759
If you look at Jeju's sea,

298
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:02,928
the atmosphere is barely moving.

299
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:06,765
If the five-kilometer-high
pressure trough fails to support it

300
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:09,017
-or if the anticyclone…
-What's going on?

301
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:10,936
Are you hurt?

302
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:13,563
Then the northward stationary front

303
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:15,399
could suddenly go southward.

304
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:18,443
If we were to measure it
at a five-kilometer distance,

305
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:20,028
it will definitely happen.

306
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:23,490
What's your take on this, Jeju Office?

307
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:25,826
We agree with the Busan Office.

308
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:27,411
Judging by the gale

309
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:31,081
at the north of the stationary front
at a 200hPa altitude,

310
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:33,083
it is definitely possible.

311
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:41,591
NATIONAL METEOROLOGICAL CENTER
COMPREHENSIVE CONTROL SYSTEM

312
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:01,528
If we forecast it a day or two later

313
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:03,822
like Senior Forecaster Um said
and we're wrong,

314
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:05,157
who'll take the blame?

315
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,576
We'll receive even more public backlash

316
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:09,786
if it starts raining earlier.

317
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,039
Let's take a safer stance.

318
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:15,000
No, I don't think that's right.

319
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:20,088
The weather is being heavily affected
by climate change these days.

320
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:24,843
In the past several years,
we continuously failed to forecast

321
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:26,678
the end of the rainy season.

322
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:29,181
Now, people don't believe in our forecast.

323
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:33,185
If we fail to forecast
the start of the rainy season this year,

324
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:36,980
we will receive
a ton of criticism this summer.

325
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:38,982
So you want to risk it?

326
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:44,946
Can we delay the press announcement?

327
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:48,909
Is it possible?

328
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:50,786
We've pushed it back as much as possible.

329
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:53,330
After seeing
the southern stationary front,

330
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:54,956
the press and local governments

331
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,833
have been bombarding us with calls.

332
00:22:56,917 --> 00:23:00,670
If we're too late,
the press will write whatever they want.

333
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:03,757
Don't you remember
what we had to go through last time?

334
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,008
Forecaster Lee?

335
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:14,559
Forecaster Lee Si-woo.

336
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:16,978
What's your take?

337
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:28,448
I'm sorry.

338
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:30,867
I didn't follow.

339
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:32,244
What were you doing?

340
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:34,663
I'm sorry, sir.

341
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,209
All right. What should we do?

342
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:42,587
Due to central-northern China's trough

343
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:44,548
and the formation of the gale,

344
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:47,759
it's more likely that
the stationary front will head north.

345
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:50,846
Should we say
the rainy season will start in five days?

346
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:53,890
We have no choice.

347
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:55,475
We can make that announcement.

348
00:23:57,018 --> 00:23:58,812
-Are you sure?
-Yes, sir.

349
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:04,901
Okay. Good work, everyone.

350
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:05,986
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

351
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:09,197
Give a press briefing in the afternoon.

352
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:11,199
Right. During the briefing,

353
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:15,120
make sure you guys tell
the journalists that they shouldn't make

354
00:24:15,203 --> 00:24:17,622
a hasty conclusion
about the beginning and end dates

355
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:18,999
-of the rainy season.
-Yes, sir.

356
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:21,042
Okay. Good job working in the heat.

357
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:23,795
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

358
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:46,610
-What about the meeting?
-Assistant Director Kim took over for me.

359
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:48,695
Good going.

360
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:54,117
Sorry about yesterday.

361
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:56,661
I was too drunk to control myself.

362
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:58,788
Was I a terrible drunk?

363
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:02,584
I'm sure you already know the answer.

364
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:05,962
I'm sorry.

365
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:09,382
-Go to the right lane.
-Okay.

366
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:11,927
-The blinkers.
-Right.

367
00:25:19,142 --> 00:25:21,519
Habits are hard to break, right?

368
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:22,771
Not really.

369
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:30,237
Ha-kyung, what should I do?

370
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:32,572
Divorce if you want.

371
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:34,532
Don't make it sound so easy.

372
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:37,369
I can't do that.

373
00:25:37,452 --> 00:25:39,204
I still love Yu-jin so much.

374
00:25:39,996 --> 00:25:41,248
Then stick with her.

375
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:44,417
That bastard, Lee Si-woo, is to blame.

376
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:45,543
Don't be absurd.

377
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:46,878
This is between you and her.

378
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:50,006
Why do you always
get worked up when I mention him?

379
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:53,468
Because you always pick on him.

380
00:25:58,598 --> 00:26:00,267
Watch out, Ha-kyung.

381
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:04,396
I could totally see that he's a womanizer.

382
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:08,900
Focus on driving.

383
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:10,151
Look at the road.

384
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:13,738
And let me say this from
an older brother's point of view.

385
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:15,573
Kick Senior Forecaster Um and that kid

386
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:18,243
out of your house right now. Okay?

387
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,537
Older brother, my ass.

388
00:26:21,204 --> 00:26:23,331
Whatever. They're my teammates.
I'll take care of it.

389
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:52,277
Gosh, it's steaming hot.

390
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:57,490
The computer center got their own AC,

391
00:26:57,574 --> 00:26:59,034
so it's freezing in there.

392
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:01,202
So why is it so hot here?

393
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:03,663
That's because they have many machines.

394
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:06,791
I guess machines
are more important than humans.

395
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:10,128
If that's true, shouldn't we receive
special treatment too?

396
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:11,796
We also work like machines.

397
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:13,590
I agree.

398
00:27:18,678 --> 00:27:20,138
Hello, sir.

399
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:32,025
The feature story might fall through?

400
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:33,818
What do you mean?

401
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:38,740
Your husband suddenly
called us this morning

402
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:41,242
and said he couldn't write it.

403
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:43,703
He could have just said no
from the get-go!

404
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:45,663
We've already finalized the format!

405
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:46,873
How could he do this?

406
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:49,459
Gosh. I'm sorry, sir.

407
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:51,461
Gosh.

408
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:54,756
I'll talk with him

409
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:57,008
and call you back.

410
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:58,426
I'm sorry, sir.

411
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:00,595
Goodbye.

412
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:14,275
Do you even know
how many computers we have here?

413
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:17,487
We can't ventilate the room.
We're melting in here.

414
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:20,657
I heard you provided
the computer center with an AC.

415
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,534
Can you help us out too?

416
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:24,160
When?

417
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:29,416
Okay. Please hurry.

418
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:33,086
What did they say?

419
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:35,130
They can't get us a new one.

420
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:37,257
They told us to wait another two hours.

421
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,383
Again?

422
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:41,177
They said that an hour ago.

423
00:28:44,597 --> 00:28:46,099
Can you talk to them in person?

424
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:48,226
Me?

425
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:50,103
You're good at persuading others.

426
00:28:55,775 --> 00:28:57,318
Hey, Forecaster…

427
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:03,575
Forecaster Lee seems down all day.

428
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:07,120
I bet it's because of the sweltering heat.

429
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:10,790
What are you doing?

430
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:12,167
Should I go instead?

431
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,043
No.

432
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:15,670
It's okay.

433
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:17,380
I'll go.

434
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:20,049
Thank you.

435
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:26,097
AIR CONDITIONING ROOM
RESTRICTED ACCESS

436
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:33,062
Excuse me, I'm from the Chief Team.

437
00:29:36,232 --> 00:29:38,234
Are they in there or not?

438
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:44,073
When will you fix…

439
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:53,958
How can I help you?

440
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,715
Thank you for your hard work. Goodbye.

441
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:13,686
Four.

442
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:15,438
Four.

443
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:18,817
One, two, three, four.

444
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,611
Crocodiles' hind feet have four toes.

445
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:31,621
Hey.

446
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:35,792
They got Ha-kyung a blind date.

447
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:37,752
The guy provided a few dates,

448
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:40,296
so we can pick whichever one we want.

449
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,590
Mom, are you still doing that?

450
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:44,467
He's a gynecologist.

451
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:48,304
He definitely has a promising future
and a high salary. Don't you think so?

452
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:50,765
Can you please stop?

453
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:53,059
She's busy due to
the disaster prevention season.

454
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:56,646
And if you do this without her approval,

455
00:30:56,729 --> 00:30:58,439
she might never see you again.

456
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:01,568
What if something happens to me

457
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:04,904
like last time, and I pass away?

458
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:08,116
Neither you nor Ha-kyung
will know what to do.

459
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:12,328
Knowing that there is someone
who can hold my funeral

460
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:14,414
will help me die in peace.

461
00:31:14,497 --> 00:31:15,415
Mother!

462
00:31:15,498 --> 00:31:16,749
You're not going to die!

463
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:21,170
Then? Did you think
I'd take care of you two forever?

464
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:22,630
I never said that.

465
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:25,550
Then just shut it and help me out.

466
00:31:25,633 --> 00:31:26,885
Whatever!

467
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:28,344
You guys can sort this out!

468
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:29,596
Leave me out of this!

469
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:32,432
You don't have to get involved.

470
00:31:32,515 --> 00:31:34,517
I already know what to do.

471
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:42,025
I lost my train of thought
once again thanks to her.

472
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:46,863
Gosh! I just can't focus!

473
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:15,350
DIRECTOR JIN HA-KYUNG

474
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:27,820
What is it, Forecaster Lee?

475
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:31,824
We need to talk.

476
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:34,285
Okay.

477
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:44,420
HONEY

478
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:53,763
KI-JUN

479
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:04,607
Hey…

480
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:14,075
OFFICE OF SPOKESPERSON

481
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:28,381
What is it? What's wrong?

482
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:32,051
I heard you had an accident.

483
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:33,970
Are you hurt?

484
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,349
It was a minor collision.
They towed my car.

485
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:41,519
Ki-jun could have suspected us back there.

486
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:42,770
I wish he did.

487
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:44,355
What?

488
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:46,107
Why did you call

489
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:48,317
Senior Forecaster Um first and not me?

490
00:33:48,901 --> 00:33:50,403
That was because of the meeting.

491
00:33:50,486 --> 00:33:53,781
Then why did you come back with Ki-jun?

492
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:56,868
There was an insurance issue.

493
00:33:56,951 --> 00:33:59,412
Are there still things
that haven't been sorted out with him?

494
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:01,289
What are they?

495
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:02,790
How long will this last?

496
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:05,334
Besides the columns,
the apologies, and the insurance,

497
00:34:06,335 --> 00:34:08,337
what else is left between you two?

498
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,843
Why have you been like this
since yesterday?

499
00:34:13,926 --> 00:34:16,179
Because he's been pissing me off
since last night!

500
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:19,432
Do you know

501
00:34:19,932 --> 00:34:21,893
how worried I was?

502
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:26,230
You were in an accident,
but you weren't picking up.

503
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:28,608
I couldn't ask anyone

504
00:34:28,691 --> 00:34:30,735
how badly injured you were.

505
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:32,653
I had to hide my worries.

506
00:34:33,946 --> 00:34:37,450
I couldn't focus at all
during the meeting.

507
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:41,287
I was worried sick about you.

508
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:46,667
I found myself

509
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:49,378
falling head over heels for her.

510
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:54,300
But the deeper I fell, the more upset

511
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:57,178
and mad I got.

512
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:01,933
Since it was a minor accident

513
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:03,601
and nobody got hurt,

514
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:05,853
I didn't think you'd be this worried.

515
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:10,149
I'm sorry.

516
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:15,196
Stop saying that you're sorry.

517
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:17,115
Whenever you apologize,

518
00:35:17,698 --> 00:35:19,367
I feel like a bad person.

519
00:35:35,174 --> 00:35:37,426
There is a briefing this afternoon
regarding the rainy season.

520
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:40,471
You should get prepared.

521
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:09,625
Wait.

522
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,132
Can we talk?

523
00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:22,221
-From here, right?
-Right.

524
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,683
I'm sorry I'm late.

525
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:28,436
Hello. Is everything taken care of?

526
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:30,313
Did you get hurt?

527
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,650
-My car had some damage but I'm fine.
-I see.

528
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:36,485
Are we having
a rainy season briefing later?

529
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:39,697
-Yes.
-Can I see a summary of today's meeting?

530
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,199
Let's see. Here.

531
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:45,328
Nothing big has changed
since our meeting two days ago.

532
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:49,749
There's a stationary front
over the sea near Okinawa.

533
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:53,002
Due to the formation
of the trough and the gale

534
00:36:53,085 --> 00:36:54,629
in central-northern China,

535
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:57,256
we believe the rainy season
will begin in five days,

536
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,759
starting in Jeju
and the southern provinces.

537
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:02,637
But there's a catch.

538
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:04,555
What is it?

539
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:07,975
The anticyclone over
the Okhotsk Sea is too great,

540
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:10,269
and cold air from the north has come down.

541
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:13,189
If the anticyclone
of the North Pacific weakens,

542
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:15,733
it'll take longer

543
00:37:15,816 --> 00:37:17,777
for the stationary front to rise.

544
00:37:19,528 --> 00:37:21,155
And the numerical model?

545
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,573
It's similar to yesterday's.

546
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:24,450
What should we do?

547
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:27,119
Forecaster Lee, what do you…

548
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:35,544
Let's base the briefing

549
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:37,672
on what we agreed on this morning.

550
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:41,676
Your theory makes sense too,
but we have no immediate proof.

551
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:44,303
All right. Let's do that.

552
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:46,514
-Ms. Kim.
-Yes, ma'am.

553
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:48,266
Get the forecast material
for the changes in China's trough.

554
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:50,101
I'll be in the briefing room.

555
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:51,018
Yes, ma'am.

556
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:05,574
How did you meet my husband yesterday?

557
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:08,703
We didn't meet. He just came.

558
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:10,830
He visited you?

559
00:38:10,913 --> 00:38:12,164
No. Director Jin.

560
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:14,542
He was wasted.

561
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:17,378
Why? Why did he go there?

562
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:24,969
Hurry up.

563
00:38:25,886 --> 00:38:27,430
I think your husband found out.

564
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:28,806
About what?

565
00:38:28,889 --> 00:38:31,267
That you and I lived together.

566
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:35,438
How?

567
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:36,981
Did you tell him?

568
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:39,317
Why would I?

569
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,860
What would I get out of it?

570
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:48,159
No wonder he was
acting strange this morning.

571
00:38:48,242 --> 00:38:49,785
What should I do?

572
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:53,164
Come on. You didn't do anything wrong.

573
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:55,875
Make sure he understands
that it was all in the past.

574
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:58,002
Do you think it's that easy?

575
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:00,921
Guys will never understand that.

576
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:03,966
Even if it was in the past,
their imaginations will run wild.

577
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:06,052
What should I do?

578
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:10,931
We agreed to move in together
because we wanted to.

579
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:14,393
And you told me
you weren't going to regret it.

580
00:39:15,227 --> 00:39:18,814
-Remember?
-I had a change of heart once we broke up.

581
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:22,485
Back then, I really thought
I wasn't going to regret it.

582
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:24,737
But I regret it so much now.

583
00:39:25,237 --> 00:39:26,447
Don't you?

584
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:28,157
No.

585
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:32,119
I don't regret anything
I put my heart into.

586
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:34,914
Maybe for now.

587
00:39:34,997 --> 00:39:37,333
Once you fall in love with someone new,

588
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:39,960
you won't be able to tell them the truth.

589
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:48,928
I already told her.

590
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:55,601
Si-woo, are you seeing someone right now?

591
00:39:55,684 --> 00:39:56,936
Yes.

592
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,230
So be brave and tell him.

593
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:01,565
If he truly loves you,

594
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:03,984
he should love the person you were

595
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:05,736
in the past as well.

596
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:26,674
Forecaster Lee.

597
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:28,008
Yes, sir.

598
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:29,260
Where have you been?

599
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:31,971
What's with you today?

600
00:40:32,054 --> 00:40:33,889
You couldn't focus during the meeting.

601
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:35,808
Don't work halfheartedly.

602
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:37,685
I'm sorry, sir.

603
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:39,979
It's because of the heat.

604
00:40:40,062 --> 00:40:41,730
No one can stand this heat.

605
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:46,444
Ms. Kim, can you give me that?

606
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:49,989
This is the forecast material
for the trough changes.

607
00:40:50,072 --> 00:40:52,366
Take this to the briefing room.

608
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,743
Come to your senses and get up to date.

609
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:57,997
Yes, sir.

610
00:41:04,753 --> 00:41:05,838
Could he be sick?

611
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:13,679
Gosh, it's too hot today.

612
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:31,447
Do I know her?

613
00:41:33,407 --> 00:41:34,992
Your girlfriend.

614
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:37,870
You're not dating a colleague, are you?

615
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:48,881
That's roughly all the information
about the start of the rainy season.

616
00:41:48,964 --> 00:41:52,676
Director Jin from Chief Team Two
will answer further questions.

617
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:01,435
Hello, I'm Director Jin
from Chief Team Two.

618
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:02,978
Any questions?

619
00:42:06,148 --> 00:42:08,025
I'm Reporter Cho Eun-ji from JBC.

620
00:42:08,108 --> 00:42:10,069
We were informed that
the seasonal rain front

621
00:42:10,152 --> 00:42:12,446
would last longer than usual this year.

622
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:13,614
Why is this?

623
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:16,408
That's because we predict
North Pacific's anticyclone

624
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:18,160
would reach China and stay there.

625
00:42:18,827 --> 00:42:21,247
Then when will this rainy season end?

626
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:23,999
We expect it to last
two to three days more.

627
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:26,585
I'd like to clarify some terms for you.

628
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,936
It's difficult to predict when it will end

629
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:45,604
because we've been experiencing

630
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:49,400
unusual weather during the summer
due to climate change.

631
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:50,818
So instead of giving you

632
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:53,654
the exact start and end dates
of the rainy season,

633
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:57,116
we'll give short-range
and weekly forecasts regarding the rain.

634
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:02,121
Director Jin, here.

635
00:43:05,624 --> 00:43:07,209
Next question, please.

636
00:43:09,628 --> 00:43:12,715
I saw you two coming in together.
What's going on?

637
00:43:12,798 --> 00:43:15,467
Never mind.

638
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:19,638
"Never mind"? What do you mean?

639
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:22,182
I'm not the type who minds about the past.

640
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:23,934
What did you say?

641
00:43:24,518 --> 00:43:26,270
I'm also not the type to torment my lover

642
00:43:26,353 --> 00:43:28,647
with the past she had before dating me.

643
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:30,524
And I'm definitely not a pathetic loser

644
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:32,651
who barges into his ex-girlfriend's house.

645
00:43:52,546 --> 00:43:55,591
Rumor has it that
she lived with someone from the KMA.

646
00:43:55,674 --> 00:43:58,969
Did she end up marrying that guy?

647
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:03,307
She lived with someone from the KMA?

648
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:06,143
-How could she do that?
-She lived with someone from the KMA?

649
00:44:06,226 --> 00:44:08,312
She lived with someone?

650
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:06,203
This is all your fault!

651
00:45:06,286 --> 00:45:07,663
Can't you see?

652
00:45:07,746 --> 00:45:08,789
What is he doing?

653
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:12,668
Just be honest.

654
00:45:12,751 --> 00:45:15,170
Don't pretend to be
a gentleman and torment her.

655
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:16,672
Be a man, will you?

656
00:45:16,755 --> 00:45:17,798
What did you say?

657
00:45:19,675 --> 00:45:20,509
Hey.

658
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:23,387
-Stop fighting!
-Hey.

659
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:24,596
-What did you say?
-Ki-jun!

660
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:25,681
-Ki-jun!
-Damn it!

661
00:45:26,348 --> 00:45:27,641
Stop it, Lee Si-woo!

662
00:45:27,724 --> 00:45:29,268
-Come on!
-Stop them!

663
00:45:32,187 --> 00:45:33,981
-Stop it!
-Come on!

664
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:35,399
Stop filming.

665
00:45:35,482 --> 00:45:37,025
What the hell did you say?

666
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:38,610
Hey! You want a piece of me?

667
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:39,820
You…

668
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:41,780
-Record this. Hurry.
-You…

669
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:43,157
-Don't film.
-Let go!

670
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:45,742
Let me go! I said let go!

671
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:49,329
I'm going to kill you today!

672
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:51,331
-You little…
-Come here!

673
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:52,499
Let me go!

674
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:55,377
You're dead meat! You!

675
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:57,045
FORECAST BUREAU DIRECTOR GENERAL
KO BONG-CHAN

676
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,506
Good going.

677
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:07,639
Okay? Well done.

678
00:46:10,934 --> 00:46:12,895
This is unbelievable.

679
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:17,566
I thought you were just a couple of nerds,
but you knew how to fight.

680
00:46:17,649 --> 00:46:19,735
So tell me. Why did you fight?

681
00:46:19,818 --> 00:46:23,155
Are you not going to tell me
why you beat up each other?

682
00:46:28,118 --> 00:46:29,203
No?

683
00:46:32,706 --> 00:46:33,749
Fine.

684
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:35,584
Assistant Director Park.

685
00:46:36,168 --> 00:46:37,044
Yes, sir?

686
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:38,462
Get their written apologies

687
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:41,006
and take disciplinary action.

688
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:42,549
Yes, sir.

689
00:46:47,513 --> 00:46:49,389
My goodness.

690
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:06,532
What in the world is going on?

691
00:47:06,615 --> 00:47:09,701
It's just too hot today.
Even the AC is broken.

692
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:11,912
That's still no reason to fight.

693
00:47:13,747 --> 00:47:15,415
In front of the reporters at that.

694
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:21,088
Breaking news!

695
00:47:22,047 --> 00:47:23,590
Deputy Director Han's wife.

696
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:24,675
Reporter Chae Yu-jin?

697
00:47:24,758 --> 00:47:28,011
Who do you think her ex-boyfriend was?

698
00:47:29,471 --> 00:47:31,098
No way. It can't be.

699
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:32,224
That's right.

700
00:47:32,307 --> 00:47:35,018
-It was Forecaster Lee.
-What?

701
00:47:39,648 --> 00:47:40,774
Seriously?

702
00:47:41,608 --> 00:47:43,110
Then what is this?

703
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:45,362
Are you saying

704
00:47:45,445 --> 00:47:49,032
her husband and her ex-boyfriend
had a fight over her?

705
00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:52,578
But why? She's married.

706
00:47:53,161 --> 00:47:54,997
Maybe she's still seeing Forecaster Lee.

707
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:57,291
I doubt it.

708
00:47:57,916 --> 00:48:00,794
Si-woo is not the type who's indecisive.

709
00:48:01,378 --> 00:48:03,088
He's not the type

710
00:48:03,171 --> 00:48:04,756
to cling on to his ex-girlfriend.

711
00:48:05,591 --> 00:48:08,635
I'm sure something else upset him.

712
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:11,513
-So what could it be?
-Exactly. What could it be?

713
00:48:12,097 --> 00:48:13,223
I don't know the details.

714
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:16,476
But if anything,
Ki-jun probably did him wrong.

715
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:19,646
I know Ki-jun quite well.

716
00:48:20,647 --> 00:48:21,773
And he's a loser.

717
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:28,405
So how about we just turn
a blind eye to today's incident?

718
00:48:28,488 --> 00:48:31,825
I'm sure it was a tough day
for Forecaster Lee as well.

719
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:34,620
You're right.

720
00:48:34,703 --> 00:48:37,789
It's no fun to gossip
about someone's past.

721
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:41,585
I completely agree with you.

722
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:43,170
Me too.

723
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:50,218
Sure.

724
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:06,818
Hey, the AC is back on.

725
00:49:09,988 --> 00:49:11,740
You fixed this for us by going down there.

726
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:15,702
Well, I didn't fix anything.

727
00:49:19,081 --> 00:49:20,082
It must be so hot.

728
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:22,668
Thank you.

729
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:24,127
-Thank you.
-My pleasure.

730
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:25,504
And…

731
00:49:25,587 --> 00:49:27,047
Gosh.

732
00:49:28,215 --> 00:49:30,425
-Have some before you continue.
-Thank you.

733
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:31,760
Thank you.

734
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:33,303
Thank you.

735
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:35,472
Gosh, that's nice.

736
00:49:35,555 --> 00:49:36,973
It's so refreshing.

737
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:50,278
Oh, dear.

738
00:49:50,362 --> 00:49:52,072
UPCOMING RAINY SEASON
WILL BE HOT AND WORSE

739
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:53,949
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS PREPARE
FOR THE RAINY SEASON

740
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:40,954
What's going on?

741
00:50:45,917 --> 00:50:48,378
Ma'am, I'll be going now.

742
00:50:48,462 --> 00:50:49,671
Ms. Lee.

743
00:50:49,755 --> 00:50:50,964
Here.

744
00:50:53,008 --> 00:50:55,719
You could have just wired
the tutor fee as usual.

745
00:50:55,802 --> 00:50:58,346
I've already wired the tutor fee.

746
00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:00,223
This is just a small gift.

747
00:51:01,975 --> 00:51:03,226
Thank you.

748
00:51:04,936 --> 00:51:08,565
By the way, are you having
family problems these days?

749
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:11,318
No. Why do you ask?

750
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:16,198
My kid tells me that you have trouble
focusing during your lessons.

751
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:18,366
Goodness.

752
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:21,203
You know that kids these days
are more aware now, right?

753
00:51:21,286 --> 00:51:23,163
I trust that you'll do well.

754
00:51:23,955 --> 00:51:26,374
Okay. I'll be more careful.

755
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:28,877
Goodbye.

756
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:30,712
Goodbye. Thank you.

757
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:19,386
CALLS

758
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:22,222
BO-MI'S DAD

759
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:36,111
KMA ANNOUNCES
THIS YEAR'S RAINY SEASON PROSPECT

760
00:52:48,915 --> 00:52:50,500
WIFE

761
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:56,298
-Hello?
-Where are you?

762
00:52:57,632 --> 00:52:59,718
I'm at work of course.

763
00:52:59,801 --> 00:53:00,927
Where exactly?

764
00:53:01,928 --> 00:53:03,305
In the night-duty room.

765
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:05,557
Aren't you uncomfortable?

766
00:53:06,182 --> 00:53:07,100
Well…

767
00:53:07,684 --> 00:53:10,061
I'm too busy to even feel uncomfortable.

768
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:13,690
We had to announce the rainy season,
so it's been hectic all day.

769
00:53:13,773 --> 00:53:15,525
I'm finally resting now.

770
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:17,652
You must be tired.

771
00:53:18,403 --> 00:53:20,030
I'm okay.

772
00:53:21,615 --> 00:53:22,699
Yes.

773
00:53:24,743 --> 00:53:26,202
Okay. Bye.

774
00:53:26,786 --> 00:53:28,538
How is Bo-mi…

775
00:53:49,976 --> 00:53:51,227
What did he say?

776
00:53:51,311 --> 00:53:53,355
He's already at home, right?

777
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:55,398
Yes.

778
00:53:55,482 --> 00:53:57,359
I told you he left earlier.

779
00:53:59,527 --> 00:54:01,613
I should get going then.

780
00:54:01,696 --> 00:54:03,031
Goodbye.

781
00:54:03,865 --> 00:54:05,575
Goodbye. Have a safe way home.

782
00:54:31,643 --> 00:54:32,894
Goodness.

783
00:54:40,819 --> 00:54:41,903
Bear with it.

784
00:54:54,332 --> 00:54:55,417
Okay.

785
00:54:57,711 --> 00:55:00,088
Gosh, were you always a baby?

786
00:55:01,089 --> 00:55:03,133
So what? Do you not like me?

787
00:55:03,675 --> 00:55:05,260
How did you manage to fight?

788
00:55:05,343 --> 00:55:08,096
He threw a punch first.

789
00:55:08,179 --> 00:55:09,723
Should I have done nothing then?

790
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:13,184
Stop being angry.

791
00:55:15,812 --> 00:55:18,106
Both the columns
and the insurance were my fault.

792
00:55:18,189 --> 00:55:20,400
This may sound odd.

793
00:55:20,483 --> 00:55:23,778
But since he and I
have known each other for ten long years,

794
00:55:24,362 --> 00:55:27,157
there are things
that I just can't easily cut off.

795
00:55:29,534 --> 00:55:31,453
For example, the morning incident.

796
00:55:32,037 --> 00:55:35,915
He didn't even tell me
that he had bought his friend's insurance.

797
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:37,959
Imagine how flustered I was.

798
00:55:38,043 --> 00:55:40,670
The other driver demanded
that I call my insurance company.

799
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:46,009
The reason why
I didn't explain this to you

800
00:55:46,634 --> 00:55:49,387
was because I didn't want you to know

801
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:52,223
how pathetic my past relationship was.

802
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:54,059
That's why.

803
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:56,227
If that's the case,

804
00:55:57,395 --> 00:55:58,646
why are you telling me now?

805
00:56:00,899 --> 00:56:03,234
Being embarrassed
in front of you is temporary.

806
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:05,653
But I'd regret it forever

807
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:08,948
if you misunderstood me.

808
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:16,498
I'll make sure
this doesn't happen ever again.

809
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:23,713
Of course, bits of my past with Ki-jun
might suddenly surface out of nowhere.

810
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:28,635
But I promise I'll be honest with you.

811
00:56:29,594 --> 00:56:30,929
I won't hide anything.

812
00:56:31,513 --> 00:56:32,430
You have my word.

813
00:56:39,104 --> 00:56:40,814
This is getting out of hand.

814
00:56:42,357 --> 00:56:43,942
Why? Are you still mad?

815
00:56:45,985 --> 00:56:49,197
I keep falling for you.

816
00:56:50,615 --> 00:56:52,325
It's getting out of hand.

817
00:56:57,247 --> 00:57:00,917
What if I love you so much
that I want others to know?

818
00:57:02,127 --> 00:57:05,463
That would be terrible
since our relationship would be over.

819
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:15,098
We're in a public place.

820
00:57:15,682 --> 00:57:17,225
But it's not our office.

821
00:57:17,308 --> 00:57:19,018
What if someone we know sees us?

822
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:22,313
If you're so worried about that,

823
00:57:22,397 --> 00:57:25,984
you shouldn't have sat next to me
with that beautiful smile,

824
00:57:26,067 --> 00:57:27,193
Ha-kyung.

825
00:57:29,571 --> 00:57:31,281
"Ha-kyung"? Did you just--

826
00:57:33,158 --> 00:57:34,242
What's wrong with you?

827
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:01,394
No way.

828
00:58:17,035 --> 00:58:18,203
What are you doing there?

829
00:58:21,247 --> 00:58:22,624
You have something to say.

830
00:58:23,708 --> 00:58:24,876
Don't you?

831
00:58:28,379 --> 00:58:30,507
I'm tired. Maybe next time.

832
00:58:31,591 --> 00:58:33,426
Yes, we did live together.

833
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:38,348
Si-woo and I lived together for a while.

834
00:58:38,932 --> 00:58:40,099
So what?

835
00:58:40,642 --> 00:58:44,020
It was before I met you,
so why is it so bad?

836
00:58:44,103 --> 00:58:45,980
Living with your boyfriend isn't a sin.

837
00:58:47,482 --> 00:58:48,650
Living together?

838
00:58:57,492 --> 00:58:59,077
Of course, it's not a sin.

839
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:02,163
I know it's neither immoral nor illegal.

840
00:59:02,247 --> 00:59:03,456
I know that very well.

841
00:59:03,998 --> 00:59:06,084
But I'm in so much pain, Yu-jin.

842
00:59:07,919 --> 00:59:10,171
"Let's forget I heard it. Ignore it."

843
00:59:10,255 --> 00:59:12,090
I keep telling myself that.

844
00:59:13,424 --> 00:59:15,760
But I can't stop thinking about it.

845
00:59:17,804 --> 00:59:20,515
I can't accept the fact that you lived

846
00:59:22,141 --> 00:59:24,143
with another man, Yu-jin.

847
00:59:24,978 --> 00:59:27,897
And I despise that it was Lee Si-woo.

848
00:59:29,148 --> 00:59:31,276
It was before you and I dated.

849
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:32,902
It's all in the past.

850
00:59:32,986 --> 00:59:35,113
Who said it's only in the past?

851
00:59:35,196 --> 00:59:37,490
What are you saying? I've moved on.

852
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:38,908
Do you know…

853
00:59:41,911 --> 00:59:43,079
Damn it.

854
00:59:45,498 --> 00:59:48,376
Do you know who he's dating right now?

855
00:59:50,044 --> 00:59:53,256
Mischievous weather
doesn't only pertain to cloudy skies,

856
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:55,675
unexpected snow or rain,

857
00:59:56,217 --> 00:59:59,554
harsh winds, and typhoons.

858
01:00:00,179 --> 01:00:02,265
Who is he dating?

859
01:00:05,852 --> 01:00:07,061
Jin Ha-kyung.

860
01:00:12,108 --> 01:00:13,318
What?

861
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:15,111
Who?

862
01:00:15,194 --> 01:00:16,654
My ex-girlfriend.

863
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:19,449
My ex-fiancée, Jin Ha-kyung.

864
01:00:20,033 --> 01:00:21,784
Director Jin from Chief Team Two!

865
01:00:31,794 --> 01:00:34,047
We become victims of mischievous weather

866
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:38,009
when we least expect it.

867
01:00:49,646 --> 01:00:51,230
At times like these,

868
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:54,359
a rain shower
would be wonderful and refreshing.

869
01:01:10,083 --> 01:01:12,585
There's no rain. I knew it.

870
01:01:16,422 --> 01:01:19,509
INNOVATIVE WEATHER SERVICES
A STEPPING STONE TO PUBLIC SAFETY

871
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:54,544
-Are you dating Lee Si-woo?
-What?

872
01:01:54,627 --> 01:01:57,088
Aren't you just jealous
because they're going out?

873
01:01:57,171 --> 01:01:59,006
Jealous? Of Si-woo?

874
01:01:59,090 --> 01:02:00,717
Why don't we just come out?

875
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:02,009
We have to play innocent.

876
01:02:03,219 --> 01:02:07,098
I'm sure Si-woo approached Ha-kyung
to get back at me.

877
01:02:07,682 --> 01:02:09,183
How is it coming along?

878
01:02:09,976 --> 01:02:11,644
Isn't making hasty conclusions
your specialty?

879
01:02:12,603 --> 01:02:14,689
Why don't you two have a debate about it?

880
01:02:15,857 --> 01:02:16,983
You should stop seeing her.

881
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:19,068
Ha-kyung doesn't sincerely date anyone

882
01:02:20,319 --> 01:02:21,529
if they're not a marriage prospect.

883
01:02:22,196 --> 01:02:27,076
