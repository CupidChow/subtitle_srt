1
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:52,761
The leaves are falling!

2
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:55,972
Gosh, look at the leaves.

3
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,770
You look good.

4
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:04,022
Let's go.

5
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,322
Seoul's current temperature is 21°C.

6
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:14,824
The relative humidity is 43 percent.

7
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:16,159
What was that?

8
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:19,204
The high temperature and humidity

9
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:21,623
of the North Pacific air mass
have retreated.

10
00:01:21,706 --> 00:01:26,086
The pleasant fall weather
that is neither hot nor cold has begun.

11
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:32,550
There is a migratory anticyclone
from the west around this season,

12
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:33,635
and it feels pleasant.

13
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:34,844
I'll be back.

14
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:38,807
Everything is wonderful
during this season, but I…

15
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:54,239
got my heart broken.

16
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:06,871
I never gave her anything.

17
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:15,421
DIRECTOR JIN HA-KYUNG

18
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:30,436
Hello?

19
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,021
Hey, it's me.

20
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:35,942
Are you still using these lotion bottles?

21
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:39,028
Yes, I haven't finished using them yet.

22
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:41,823
Really? Okay.

23
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:48,204
Also…

24
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:51,624
are all these chargers yours?

25
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:55,461
No, the black Type-C one is
Senior Forecaster Um's.

26
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,884
There are several black ones.

27
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:04,679
I'll pack them all up.
You can give it to him.

28
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:05,972
Okay.

29
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:08,850
By the way,

30
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:12,729
you don't have to pack my things for me.

31
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:14,772
I'll go later--

32
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:18,109
It's okay. I'm almost done.
I'll hand them over at work.

33
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:20,528
But they're heavy.

34
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:22,613
-I'll stop by later--
-You don't need to.

35
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:23,823
Bye.

36
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:17,085
EPISODE 14
MIGRATORY ANTICYCLONE

37
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:53,121
Director Jin!

38
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:07,093
Are you here for your stuff?
I said I'd bring it to you. Wait here.

39
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:08,928
There's a problem.

40
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:10,555
What problem?

41
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:12,807
They found out.

42
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:14,934
Found out what?

43
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:16,644
That we dated.

44
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:18,813
What?

45
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,695
I heard you're dating Director Jin.

46
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:27,822
What?

47
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:29,866
Were you already dating
when we stayed at her place?

48
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:33,786
Where did you hear that from?

49
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,455
It wasn't from anyone specific.

50
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:37,790
Everyone on our team knew except me.

51
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,418
Everyone?

52
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:41,711
Everyone.

53
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:44,297
Everyone on our team found out

54
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:47,216
that you and I dated.

55
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,260
What are you saying?

56
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:51,512
They know that we went out?

57
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:53,347
Yes. And I'm sure

58
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:55,391
everyone in the KMA also knows by now.

59
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:56,350
What?

60
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:58,394
You scared me.

61
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:06,486
I knew it.

62
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:08,029
Why are you here?

63
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:10,948
So that means you two dated at work.
Is that right?

64
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:15,161
-Mom, that's--
-I knew there was something going on.

65
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:20,249
-It's a misunderstanding.
-Misunderstanding, my foot.

66
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,211
I knew you'd deny it.

67
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:25,963
So I got evidence.

68
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,221
Will you deny it?

69
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:35,389
Will you still deny it?

70
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:13,386
FATHER

71
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,980
What do his parents do?

72
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:26,065
Don't ask anything.

73
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,194
I can ask that much.

74
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,697
There's no point.

75
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:33,906
Why not?

76
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:37,451
We broke up.

77
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,661
What's wrong?

78
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:40,371
Are you just saying that

79
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:42,748
-in case I ruin everything?
-Mom.

80
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:43,874
Grade Eight or Nine?

81
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,501
Can you please…

82
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:48,754
This is important.

83
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:53,009
It does slightly bother me
that he's your subordinate.

84
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:54,802
But he's younger than you,

85
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:57,346
so we should be more understanding.

86
00:09:58,139 --> 00:09:59,390
Did he go to university?

87
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:01,058
Are both of his parents alive?

88
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:02,810
Where do they live?

89
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:04,270
I said we broke up.

90
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:06,230
I ought to know

91
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:08,649
about his parents
to have a better understanding

92
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,401
of what kind of person he is.

93
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:12,236
Then I won't make any mistakes

94
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,572
when I eventually meet them.

95
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,699
You're wrong, Mom. We broke up.

96
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:18,576
I believed what you said

97
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:20,661
and was arrogant,
thinking I was a great catch.

98
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:22,413
Then he dumped me. Happy?

99
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:24,457
I won't fall for it.

100
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,752
Tell me his birthdate
and the time of his birth.

101
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:28,669
Mom.

102
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:32,590
What? Shouldn't you find out
about your compatibility?

103
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:34,634
I can't believe this.

104
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,429
Why don't you listen?

105
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:43,684
INNOVATIVE WEATHER SERVICES
A STEPPING STONE TO PUBLIC SAFETY

106
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:12,338
Are you okay?

107
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:19,095
DIRECTOR JIN HA-KYUNG

108
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:24,475
Did you speak with your mother?

109
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:25,476
FATHER

110
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:35,152
The person you are calling
is currently unavailable…

111
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:37,863
Come on. Why isn't he picking up?

112
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,198
Tell me what happened.

113
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:42,910
Okay. I was driving on the inside lane.

114
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:44,245
I wasn't even speeding.

115
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:47,289
But then, he suddenly walked
toward my car.

116
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,041
I had no way to dodge him.

117
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:52,044
-Is he serious?
-I'm truly innocent.

118
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:55,339
Don't you lie through your teeth.

119
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:57,716
You drove into me

120
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,010
when I was just walking by!

121
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:02,304
My head is split open!

122
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,014
-I--
-You did nothing wrong?

123
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:08,811
Damn it.

124
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:31,375
Hey. Breakfast is ready.
Get dressed and come out.

125
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:34,378
I'm not that hungry.

126
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:36,338
But I made dumpling soup, your favorite.

127
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,048
Look. Doesn't it look good?

128
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:41,385
Sorry.

129
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:43,679
I'm feeling nauseous right now.

130
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:45,431
Okay.

131
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,030
Yu-jin.

132
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,032
Yes?

133
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:06,118
If it's too much for you,

134
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:09,830
let's postpone registering our marriage.

135
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:13,751
I'm really fine,

136
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:16,128
so you can take your time.

137
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,723
Honestly, there are many things
I still don't know

138
00:13:27,806 --> 00:13:30,851
since this is my first time
getting married.

139
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:33,062
I really wanted to do well,

140
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:35,147
but nothing went the way I wanted.

141
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:38,609
That's why I haven't been
a great husband to you.

142
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:40,778
I was embarrassed,

143
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:44,782
so I wanted to look tougher
in front of you.

144
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:48,953
But…

145
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:52,289
I'll put in more effort from now on.

146
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:00,297
Let's make this work.

147
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:02,299
Okay?

148
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:04,552
Ki-jun.

149
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:15,020
Don't go to work on an empty stomach.
How about some hot milk?

150
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:16,939
Sure.

151
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:19,275
Okay. Get ready and come out.

152
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:08,175
Twelfth floor.

153
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:13,931
Tae-kyung.

154
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:16,016
Ha-kyung.

155
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:22,439
I'm here because…

156
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:24,984
-I'm--
-Mom sent you, right?

157
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:25,901
What?

158
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:28,278
Unbelievable.

159
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:31,699
Doors closing.

160
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:34,201
Doors opening.

161
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:36,996
Hey, try to understand her.

162
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:39,665
Imagine how worried sick
she was to send me here.

163
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:43,419
Still, she shouldn't have sent you here
so early in the morning.

164
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:46,714
You're right. I didn't know
you went to work this early.

165
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:48,799
I didn't think I was too early.

166
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:51,301
Why is she so obsessed with me

167
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:53,137
and marrying me off?

168
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,597
Why can't she believe that we broke up?

169
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,391
You broke up? With whom?

170
00:16:58,559 --> 00:16:59,560
Whatever.

171
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,146
Tell her to mind her own business.

172
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:03,480
Never mind. I'll tell her.

173
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:05,607
Hey! No.

174
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,192
She'll kill me.

175
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:09,862
Why would she? You did nothing wrong.

176
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:10,821
What?

177
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:15,367
Do you think you'll be nice
if you talk to her right now?

178
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:18,579
You'll talk harshly and upset her.

179
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:21,123
Then whom will she vent at? It'll be me.

180
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:24,168
She'll vent at me for days on end.

181
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:27,296
Gosh. Hey, Ha-kyung.

182
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:30,674
Are you seriously going
to subject me to that?

183
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:33,844
That's exactly why you shouldn't call her.

184
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:34,970
I oppose it.

185
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,764
Never. At all costs.

186
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:41,852
Fine. What would you know?

187
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:45,314
Thank you, my dear sister.

188
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:51,653
You're really admirable.

189
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,282
You didn't see me today. Go to work.

190
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,368
I'll go first. Bye.

191
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:10,881
Honey.

192
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:13,342
Look at this.

193
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:17,012
What is that?

194
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:20,808
Check this out.

195
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:24,978
My dear Bo-mi.

196
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:26,063
Happy birthday!

197
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:28,357
Isn't it funny?

198
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:32,319
An alarm goes off for self-protection.

199
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:35,864
She'll love to hang this
on her bag as a keychain, right?

200
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:38,909
She's in seventh grade.

201
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:40,702
Of course. I know that.

202
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:43,413
What kind of a seventh-grader
would want that?

203
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:48,001
Really? This is a brand new toy.

204
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:49,419
Unbelievable.

205
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:51,630
I'm going to school.

206
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:53,132
Eat first.

207
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:55,425
No, thanks. I have a stomachache.

208
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,302
Why is she sick?

209
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:58,595
It's that time of the month.

210
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,349
-That time?
-Bo-mi, at least drink this.

211
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:04,393
What time?

212
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:10,482
Oh, that time…

213
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:18,323
KOREA METEOROLOGICAL ADMINISTRATION

214
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:21,994
-Seriously?
-Yes.

215
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:24,079
-Since when?
-I heard they're dating.

216
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,248
-Another colleague?
-How long has it been?

217
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:27,666
I heard it's Director Jin of Team Two.

218
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,836
I HEARD THEY'RE DATING

219
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:32,254
ANOTHER COLLEAGUE?

220
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:34,798
HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN?

221
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:36,341
REALLY?
I HEARD HE'S WITH DIRECTOR JIN

222
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:37,593
THEY LOOK GOOD TOGETHER

223
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:43,056
THEY'RE GOING OUT

224
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,558
THEY ARE?
THEY'RE REALLY DATING?

225
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:46,351
REALLY? ANOTHER COLLEAGUE?

226
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:51,023
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

227
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,579
I heard they're dating.

228
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:06,914
Since when?

229
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:08,248
They look good together.

230
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:11,627
Is it true?

231
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:15,505
-Forecaster Lee?
-And Director Jin?

232
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,049
Are you serious?

233
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:21,053
Will she get married this time?

234
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:23,138
They suit each other.
What a lovely couple.

235
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:50,082
What's done is done.

236
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:52,292
There's no turning back.

237
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:53,877
Sorry?

238
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,422
I'm talking about Director Jin here.

239
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:00,217
She's already experienced the pain

240
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,844
of dating a colleague.

241
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:07,474
Yet you still decided to date her.
What choice do you have?

242
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:10,602
"Heavy is the head that wears the crown."

243
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:13,814
-Don't you agree?
-Right.

244
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:18,151
But to tell you the truth--

245
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:21,613
It's okay. I root for you guys.

246
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:24,992
I hope you have a beautiful relationship

247
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:30,414
and I also hope
she doesn't get hurt again.

248
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:34,126
If she gets hurt in the same way again,

249
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:38,213
she might really get on
a flight to Geneva.

250
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:41,842
I'm not just saying this for her sake.

251
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:43,218
Don't you think having

252
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:47,139
three different directors
in a year is ridiculous?

253
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:51,393
We're finally starting
to build up teamwork.

254
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:52,936
Right.

255
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:54,896
But then again,

256
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:58,692
I'm sure you guys thought long
and hard before making this decision.

257
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:03,363
I doubt you guys
would have dated to begin with

258
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:05,991
if it wasn't serious.

259
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:07,701
Right.

260
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:12,205
Don't mind the others.

261
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:14,833
-Okay?
-Okay.

262
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:17,252
-Good luck, Forecaster Lee.
-Thank you.

263
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,365
What is it?

264
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:50,410
What should we do?

265
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:54,247
People are taking it
more seriously than they should.

266
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:55,499
Ignore them.

267
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:58,001
Don't listen to them or reply.

268
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:01,213
Then they'll stop talking
about it over time.

269
00:23:02,255 --> 00:23:04,758
-But--
-I'm hanging up if it isn't about work.

270
00:23:05,258 --> 00:23:07,886
And don't call me
about things like this at work.

271
00:23:33,036 --> 00:23:34,162
Good work.

272
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:35,413
Thank you.

273
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:46,591
-Thank you.
-Sure.

274
00:23:47,342 --> 00:23:48,885
Anything in particular?

275
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:51,096
Things are peaceful for once.

276
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:57,394
The upper-level trough
near Lake Baikal is developing

277
00:23:57,477 --> 00:23:58,937
quicker than it did last year.

278
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,106
It's only a week faster.

279
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:02,983
In any case, the weather's nice.

280
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:06,444
The disaster prevention season is over,
so we have more time now.

281
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:08,655
It's the best season to fall in love.

282
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:13,785
It's the best season to do many things.

283
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:16,913
I think the live monitoring team
won't be too busy.

284
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:20,375
To prepare for the winter season,
why don't you analyze the first frost

285
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:22,252
in the past 30 years?

286
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:24,546
Isn't it too soon?

287
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:26,506
Come on.

288
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:29,050
We're finally taking a breather.
Let us relax.

289
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:32,012
The prevention season may be over,
but you should still be alert.

290
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:36,141
Migratory anticyclones are always
followed by cyclones.

291
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:37,976
The slightest change in the air current

292
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:40,478
causes abnormal weather,
so let's be on our toes.

293
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:43,690
We don't have time to joke around at work.

294
00:24:45,108 --> 00:24:46,860
All right.

295
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:49,112
It was just one joke.

296
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:52,657
You don't have to make
such a big deal out of it.

297
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:38,119
Goodness.

298
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:46,211
Are you coming in or going out?

299
00:25:46,294 --> 00:25:47,462
Well…

300
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:49,673
You know Mi-seon, right?

301
00:25:49,756 --> 00:25:51,091
We went to the same college.

302
00:25:51,174 --> 00:25:53,510
She had a publication party yesterday,

303
00:25:53,593 --> 00:25:55,470
and I was meaning to have just one drink.

304
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:57,555
She published another book?

305
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:58,932
Yes.

306
00:25:59,015 --> 00:26:00,809
Good going.

307
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:05,105
It's been less than a year
since she last published a book.

308
00:26:05,188 --> 00:26:07,232
How many years has it been for you?

309
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:09,401
I'm publishing one too.

310
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:11,528
That's why I signed
a contract with a publisher.

311
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:15,073
Goodness. We'll see
if you really publish one or not.

312
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:19,327
Who knows how long it'll take
when you're wasting your time like this?

313
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:21,329
Jeez. Mom.

314
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:23,290
What if mine becomes a bestseller?

315
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:26,126
Can we please talk about that
after you publish one,

316
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:27,669
Writer Jin?

317
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:28,628
Please?

318
00:26:29,212 --> 00:26:32,007
Goodness.
What's the point of having two kids?

319
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:35,218
Neither of them understands me.

320
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:38,096
It's about time you let Ha-kyung be.

321
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:41,474
Who cares if she's dating someone
or is against marriage?

322
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:43,268
Did she deny it in front of you too?

323
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:44,352
Deny what?

324
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:46,771
That she's dating her colleague.

325
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:48,064
Her colleague?

326
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:50,775
She's dating her colleague? Who?

327
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:52,610
You know…

328
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:55,613
That handsomely tall guy with a pale face.

329
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:57,532
The very good-looking one.

330
00:26:58,241 --> 00:27:00,702
Handsomely tall and looks like an actor?

331
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:01,828
Mr. Shin Seok-ho?

332
00:27:01,911 --> 00:27:03,413
Who is that?

333
00:27:03,496 --> 00:27:06,750
The guy who lives above her.
They're on the same team.

334
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:08,168
Come on.

335
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:11,421
He's neither handsomely tall

336
00:27:11,504 --> 00:27:13,715
nor extremely good-looking.

337
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:15,216
He's handsome enough.

338
00:27:17,635 --> 00:27:21,139
Keep talking. Who's the guy?

339
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:22,807
His name is Lee Si-woo.

340
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:27,645
You know, they were living together
until not long ago.

341
00:27:28,229 --> 00:27:30,982
They're secretly dating
behind their colleagues' backs,

342
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:33,693
but she's vehemently denying it
in front of me.

343
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:35,195
Of course, she would.

344
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:37,280
If not, you'd bombard her with questions.

345
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:38,573
Such as?

346
00:27:38,656 --> 00:27:41,284
"Who are his parents?
What does his father do?"

347
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:44,079
"Which university did he attend?
Grade Eight or Nine?"

348
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:46,539
"Tell me his birthdate
and the time of his birth."

349
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:49,959
Did she tell you
that I asked those questions?

350
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,670
She doesn't have to tell me that.

351
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:54,756
Everyone knows
about the questions you ask.

352
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:56,925
Don't exaggerate.

353
00:27:57,425 --> 00:28:00,804
Mom, just turn a blind eye to them.

354
00:28:00,887 --> 00:28:02,555
If you interfere,

355
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:04,766
you'll just ruin what they already have.

356
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,269
Ha-kyung is seeing someone again.

357
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:10,438
Be satisfied with that, will you?

358
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:12,649
That's enough. Fine.

359
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:15,318
I got it.

360
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:19,656
-Wait.
-What?

361
00:28:19,739 --> 00:28:21,074
Where did you sleep again?

362
00:28:21,157 --> 00:28:22,534
At Shin…

363
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:27,163
-At Ms. Shin's.
-But you said Mi-seon earlier.

364
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:31,584
She and I attended
Mi-seon's publication party together.

365
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:34,170
I already told you this!

366
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:50,478
Gosh, she's so intuitive.

367
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:02,490
Why did you leave so early?
I was going to make you some coffee.

368
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:14,419
Are you free later this evening?

369
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:21,551
Sure.

370
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:24,804
-Senior Forecaster Um.
-Yes?

371
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:27,474
Here's the temperature change analysis
that you wanted yesterday.

372
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:29,684
-Thanks. I'll check it out.
-Okay.

373
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:30,852
By the way,

374
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:32,479
how old are your kids again?

375
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:34,522
The eldest is ten,
and the second one is eight.

376
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:37,400
-Why?
-Then you wouldn't know.

377
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:38,902
What? What do you mean?

378
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:43,364
You see, Bo-mi's birthday
is just around the corner.

379
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:47,702
But I have no idea what to get her.

380
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:50,955
I see. What grade is she again?

381
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:51,873
Seventh grade.

382
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:53,750
Seventh grade.

383
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:54,876
A luxury item.

384
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:56,753
A luxury item?

385
00:29:56,836 --> 00:29:59,130
Don't be absurd. She's just a student.

386
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:00,965
You guys are so behind.

387
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:04,511
It's a trend these days for teenagers
to have at least one luxury item.

388
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:07,388
Even my niece asked her mom
to buy her a luxury winter jacket

389
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:10,308
in return for raising
her grades on a mock test.

390
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:11,601
Seriously?

391
00:30:13,686 --> 00:30:15,730
How much would that cost?

392
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:17,398
Jeez, I bet a hefty sum.

393
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:18,983
-Right?
-Yes.

394
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:22,278
That's…

395
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:25,865
For a middle-schooler?

396
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:27,992
That's insane.

397
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:31,204
I've never even touched
such an expensive jacket before.

398
00:30:31,287 --> 00:30:32,705
That's…

399
00:30:33,706 --> 00:30:34,958
Soo-jin.

400
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:37,710
Can you search up
migratory anticyclones' courses

401
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:40,088
in the past decade
from late September to mid-October?

402
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:42,590
Sorry? A decade's worth?

403
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:44,384
Yes. All of it.

404
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:48,054
Yes, ma'am.

405
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:52,851
What should I do?

406
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:55,144
Just buy her a decent gift.

407
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:56,938
Luxury goods are too much for students.

408
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:59,315
And they're extremely expensive.

409
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:01,025
Do you think so?

410
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:02,861
Do they really wear those?

411
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:05,905
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR PARK SUNG-JIN

412
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:10,368
Soo-jin, have you made up your mind?

413
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:16,207
Assistant Director Im
took a leave of absence?

414
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:17,625
Why?

415
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:20,795
Her husband is moving to the US for work,
so she'll be away for a few years.

416
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:21,963
I see.

417
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:24,132
So we have a vacancy.

418
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:25,592
Okay.

419
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:30,513
Speaking of which, didn't you always want
to transfer to the Policy Division?

420
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:31,681
I did.

421
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:33,975
I even requested
a transfer numerous times.

422
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:35,268
Give it another try.

423
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:39,564
Knowing our director,
you'll be accepted in no time.

424
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:40,940
-Really?
-Yes.

425
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:48,573
SOO-JIN, HAVE YOU MADE UP YOUR MIND?

426
00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:58,666
Who's analyzing the prognostic chart
for the next 24 hours?

427
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:01,836
It's me, ma'am.

428
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:09,469
How long will it take?

429
00:32:10,386 --> 00:32:11,679
I'll finish it in an hour.

430
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:19,479
I need the cut-off low development
on Lake Baikal as well.

431
00:32:19,562 --> 00:32:21,064
I'm also looking at it right now.

432
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:25,985
I'll prepare the prognostic chart
as well for your convenience.

433
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:32,241
It's okay. Just give me what you have.

434
00:32:32,825 --> 00:32:35,411
-It won't take long.
-Just give it to me.

435
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:36,621
Yes, ma'am.

436
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:46,130
Ignore them.

437
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:55,181
Assistant Director Kim,
can you ask the NWP Team

438
00:32:55,264 --> 00:32:58,101
for the foreign models
for the next three months?

439
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:02,981
Assistant Director Kim.

440
00:33:03,564 --> 00:33:06,234
Why is he so distracted?

441
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:15,994
When did Director Jin
and Forecaster Lee fall in love?

442
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:17,662
Misery sure loves company.

443
00:33:17,745 --> 00:33:21,457
He was the one Reporter Chae dated
before getting married.

444
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:23,251
Hold on. What is it, then?

445
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:25,586
-Crossed in love?
-Addicted to love.

446
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:26,546
That's what you talk about?

447
00:33:28,464 --> 00:33:29,298
Sir.

448
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,385
I'm sorry.

449
00:33:33,052 --> 00:33:35,430
I only read the messages.

450
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:41,185
Ask the NWP Team

451
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:44,480
for any extra information needed
for the next three months.

452
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:45,565
Yes, sir.

453
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:59,162
Do you think Deputy Director Han
and Reporter Chae know about this?

454
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:00,913
I'm sure they heard the rumors.

455
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:03,666
This is why
you should never date a colleague.

456
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:58,596
About the climate projection report
for this winter…

457
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:02,266
We need to add more
to the part about La Niña.

458
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:05,978
I see. Is this because of
the statement from NOAA?

459
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:07,522
That too.

460
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:10,525
Europe, Japan,
and Australia's forecast centers

461
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:12,860
also predicted La Niña.

462
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:16,280
I need to send out
a news release by 4 p.m.,

463
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:18,366
so please update it before then.

464
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:34,006
Is that all?

465
00:35:37,009 --> 00:35:39,178
It seems like there's something else.

466
00:35:45,434 --> 00:35:46,727
I've known Ha-kyung

467
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:49,814
for quite a long time.

468
00:35:49,897 --> 00:35:52,316
I must have gotten used to her

469
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:57,029
because I forgot
how precious she was to me.

470
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:00,700
I felt so entitled.

471
00:36:00,783 --> 00:36:04,287
And after some time,
I stopped feeling grateful

472
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:06,581
and forgot how much she meant to me.

473
00:36:07,206 --> 00:36:09,083
What are you trying to say?

474
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:15,506
At the end of things,
she just considered me an asshole.

475
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:20,178
But you're different.

476
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:22,597
You'll hurt her much more than I did.

477
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:30,438
She dumped me.

478
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:32,815
Do you think
the others would think the same?

479
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:38,154
People don't care about breakups.

480
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:40,615
They're just curious

481
00:36:41,657 --> 00:36:43,159
about the reason.

482
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:47,830
At work…

483
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:50,416
Especially if it's about dating,

484
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:53,044
women tend to suffer more

485
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:55,796
than we men do.

486
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,257
People will gossip more about her than you

487
00:36:58,341 --> 00:37:00,551
because of her past with me.

488
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:01,844
However…

489
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:05,223
you and I both know

490
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:09,518
that she deserves better
than to be a laughingstock.

491
00:37:10,102 --> 00:37:11,979
-I know.
-So…

492
00:37:15,524 --> 00:37:18,027
I know it may sound ridiculous,
coming from me.

493
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:21,864
But I hope you think twice
before breaking up with her.

494
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:27,995
But if you must break up,
I hope you'll be courteous.

495
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:32,166
Don't be an asshole like me.

496
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:46,430
The chill is moving southward
quicker than we expected.

497
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:48,683
Let's hear what the analysts have to say.

498
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:51,852
If this is the case, we'll have to inform
the Impact Forecast Team.

499
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:53,354
Let's do that.

500
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:56,190
A cold wave out of the blue?

501
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:57,650
What's going on?

502
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:02,029
The cold continental anticyclone
suddenly developed in Siberia

503
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:03,656
and will impact our weather.

504
00:38:03,739 --> 00:38:06,784
You can see the chill going southward
through the satellite photos.

505
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:10,246
The cold continental anticyclone
on Lake Baikal developed quicker

506
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:13,666
since the North Pacific's anticyclone
was in the far east.

507
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:16,335
This just adds insult to injury.

508
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:17,753
How is Daegwallyeong?

509
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:21,299
The morning temperature will be subzero
starting with the inland areas

510
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:23,467
such as Daegwallyeong and Cheorwon.

511
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:26,262
Assistant Director Shin,
what's the forecast for this week?

512
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:29,098
We've sent out a notice
about the temperature dropping

513
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:30,641
this weekend.

514
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:33,352
If the temperature drops 10°C or more,

515
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:35,313
the sensible temperature will be colder.

516
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:37,398
You're right. This is not good.

517
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:41,235
At this rate,

518
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:43,654
all the farmers shipping
their goods will suffer.

519
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:47,283
It's the kimchi season soon,
so the radishes on Ganghwa Island

520
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:50,077
and the cabbages in Gangwon Province
will be damaged

521
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:54,040
as well as the soybeans and chili peppers
in North Gyeongsang Province.

522
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,501
Let's keep monitoring

523
00:38:57,585 --> 00:39:00,588
until the final analysis and decide on
the cold wave advisory in two days.

524
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:02,465
And send out
an official paper on the cold wave

525
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:04,508
to the farming organizations.

526
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:05,968
We'll do our best,

527
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:09,221
but if you knew that the anticyclone
was developing quicker this year,

528
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:12,600
you should have informed us sooner.

529
00:39:13,392 --> 00:39:16,937
But then again, you must have been
too busy going on dates. Jeez.

530
00:39:20,566 --> 00:39:21,984
-Hey.
-Yes?

531
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:24,111
How's your wife doing?

532
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:26,238
-Good.
-That's good.

533
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:30,743
His wife used to be my subordinate.

534
00:39:31,994 --> 00:39:33,412
That's right.

535
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:37,416
They had one passionate relationship
at work, right?

536
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,336
Jeez. One day,
they'd be all over each other.

537
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:42,505
Another day,
they'd ruin the work atmosphere.

538
00:39:42,588 --> 00:39:44,799
You're right. We were all walking

539
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:46,634
-on eggshells.
-That's right.

540
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:49,887
I'll speak with the Office of Spokesperson
and send out that official paper

541
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:51,847
as soon as possible.

542
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:55,226
Please understand.

543
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:57,520
He's going through male menopause.

544
00:39:57,603 --> 00:39:58,896
We'll take care of it.

545
00:40:01,982 --> 00:40:04,276
You didn't have to do that.

546
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,612
They need to know
if they did something wrong.

547
00:40:06,695 --> 00:40:08,072
Otherwise, they'll keep talking.

548
00:40:09,865 --> 00:40:11,158
He's right.

549
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:13,452
Work and personal life should be separate.

550
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:16,330
He shouldn't have mentioned
you guys at work.

551
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:18,040
I completely agree with you.

552
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:20,000
Guys.

553
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:21,877
A cold wave is coming.

554
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:23,796
Let's get back to work.

555
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:25,631
I have something to tell you.

556
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:29,510
To be honest…

557
00:40:34,306 --> 00:40:36,142
Forecaster Lee and I--

558
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:38,436
I hope you support us.

559
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:42,690
We'll keep our work
and personal life separate.

560
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:45,317
Right?

561
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:49,405
Sure.

562
00:40:49,488 --> 00:40:51,073
You guys look nice.

563
00:40:52,366 --> 00:40:54,160
But don't make it too obvious.

564
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:55,828
Okay, then.

565
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:18,559
Why did you do that? What's the matter?

566
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:21,896
Let's keep it a secret for the time being.

567
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:24,273
-Keep what a secret?
-Our breakup.

568
00:41:24,356 --> 00:41:25,608
I don't understand.

569
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:29,195
It's just too much of a hassle.

570
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:31,697
They just found out that we were dating.

571
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,532
Imagine if they found out we broke up.

572
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:36,911
Those who like to talk
will be quick to assume.

573
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:39,038
They will gossip among themselves.

574
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:40,456
So…

575
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:43,083
let's keep it a secret for the time being.

576
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:44,960
Until the dust settles.

577
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:46,795
Is this because of me?

578
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:51,675
Are you worried people will think

579
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:53,719
I got dumped again?

580
00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:56,263
No.

581
00:41:57,598 --> 00:42:00,601
Then? Is it because you feel bad for me?

582
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:02,770
-No.
-Then what is it?

583
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:04,355
I just don't want to hear them.

584
00:42:05,397 --> 00:42:06,774
They gossip

585
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:08,526
when they know nothing about you.

586
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:10,569
I can't stand that.

587
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:13,989
That's why.

588
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:19,787
Didn't you know?
That's the price of dating a colleague.

589
00:42:20,454 --> 00:42:22,831
People gossip about your relationship

590
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:25,459
at all times even if
you break up or don't.

591
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:29,338
Despite knowing that,

592
00:42:31,131 --> 00:42:33,592
I chose that path once again.

593
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,768
-I'm sorry.
-Don't apologize.

594
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:44,937
It was my choice.

595
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:47,982
I chose to love and break up.

596
00:42:49,608 --> 00:42:51,110
So don't be sorry.

597
00:42:51,193 --> 00:42:55,072
It's me who needs
to bear with the consequences.

598
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:57,324
It's unbearable for me.

599
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:03,455
This breakup…

600
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:07,334
is too painful for me.

601
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:11,505
I didn't want to see you in pain

602
00:43:12,464 --> 00:43:14,300
because of this poor breakup.

603
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:15,884
But…

604
00:43:17,886 --> 00:43:21,265
I didn't expect this
to cause you even more pain.

605
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:50,461
Yu-jin.

606
00:43:52,004 --> 00:43:54,214
This is yours from today on.

607
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:56,050
What?

608
00:43:56,967 --> 00:43:59,470
Isn't Se-hui in charge
of this special article?

609
00:44:00,387 --> 00:44:04,099
She wants less work
for the time being because she's pregnant.

610
00:44:04,683 --> 00:44:06,727
No way. She's pregnant?

611
00:44:09,271 --> 00:44:11,690
Being pregnant
doesn't entitle her to anything,

612
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:14,151
but she was so brazen.

613
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:17,363
That's understandable
during early pregnancy.

614
00:44:18,113 --> 00:44:20,908
In that case, she should've just gotten
a maternity leave.

615
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:24,203
That way, I could ask
the company for more manpower.

616
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:26,705
But right now,
I can't do anything about it.

617
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:29,667
Until when am I in charge of this?

618
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:31,210
Forever.

619
00:44:32,252 --> 00:44:33,212
What?

620
00:44:33,879 --> 00:44:36,548
Consider it yours from today on.

621
00:44:37,299 --> 00:44:40,719
Taking a leave for childbirth
and childrearing will mean

622
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:43,263
she won't be working for a year or two.

623
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:45,349
Once that happens,

624
00:44:45,432 --> 00:44:47,935
she will lose her edge.

625
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:50,938
If she can't get on top of her game,
it'll be the end of her career.

626
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:53,023
Come on.

627
00:44:53,649 --> 00:44:56,026
Her career wouldn't
come to an end because of that.

628
00:44:58,112 --> 00:44:59,988
What? Do you think I'm lying?

629
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:02,324
Ask around then.

630
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:05,411
Countless colleagues of yours gave birth

631
00:45:05,494 --> 00:45:07,162
and lost their jobs.

632
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:12,501
Consider this
your golden opportunity and do well.

633
00:45:13,085 --> 00:45:15,337
You've always wanted your own column.

634
00:45:16,004 --> 00:45:17,423
You do know

635
00:45:17,506 --> 00:45:20,676
that the column is published
on the society front page, right?

636
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:24,471
Right.

637
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:26,348
I understand.

638
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:29,685
Okay. Goodbye.

639
00:45:46,827 --> 00:45:49,913
What are you pondering so hard about?
You look gorgeous.

640
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:52,624
It's nothing.

641
00:45:54,084 --> 00:45:56,628
What's wrong? Did something happen?

642
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:02,342
Actually, I'm in charge of a column now.

643
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:03,427
Seriously?

644
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:05,929
You got your own column?

645
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:10,100
Come on. That's great news.

646
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:11,435
Hold on.

647
00:46:11,518 --> 00:46:14,271
I'm done for the day
once the briefing is over.

648
00:46:14,354 --> 00:46:16,315
How about we have some wine?

649
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:18,233
I can't drink.

650
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:21,111
What's wrong?
Are you still feeling unwell?

651
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:26,241
What's wrong? Tell me.

652
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:27,826
I'm here for you. Okay?

653
00:46:28,785 --> 00:46:30,579
Do you need a new laptop?

654
00:46:30,662 --> 00:46:32,831
Or a handbag? Should we go shopping?

655
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:35,792
I'm…

656
00:46:36,376 --> 00:46:37,753
pregnant.

657
00:46:45,177 --> 00:46:46,178
What?

658
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:48,889
I'm 12 weeks pregnant.

659
00:46:57,189 --> 00:47:00,692
Good work, everyone. Let's go home now.

660
00:47:00,776 --> 00:47:01,777
Yes, sir.

661
00:47:02,402 --> 00:47:04,655
All right.

662
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:46,655
Assistant Director Shin,
do you have plans today?

663
00:47:46,738 --> 00:47:49,324
Sorry? Yes, I do.

664
00:47:49,408 --> 00:47:51,702
You're playing a new game, aren't you?

665
00:47:51,785 --> 00:47:54,496
-You're wrong.
-Then what is it?

666
00:47:55,122 --> 00:47:57,291
Are you going
on a blind date or something?

667
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,711
-No, I'm not.
-He denied it.

668
00:48:01,336 --> 00:48:02,254
He denied it.

669
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:08,260
Hello.

670
00:48:14,016 --> 00:48:15,726
You came in last.

671
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:18,562
No.

672
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:21,898
I have a very important appointment today.

673
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:24,151
Goodness.

674
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:26,445
You can go down first.

675
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:30,365
Excuse me.

676
00:48:45,547 --> 00:48:46,840
This is awkward.

677
00:48:47,507 --> 00:48:49,009
It's fine for me.

678
00:48:50,636 --> 00:48:54,514
So how long do we need to keep this up?

679
00:48:54,598 --> 00:48:55,891
Until the others

680
00:48:56,683 --> 00:48:58,685
stop talking about us.

681
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:07,110
Do we have to do this?

682
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:08,236
Yes.

683
00:49:08,987 --> 00:49:10,030
I'd like us to.

684
00:49:24,961 --> 00:49:26,838
HAN KI-JUN

685
00:49:35,055 --> 00:49:36,848
CHAE YU-JIN

686
00:49:49,945 --> 00:49:51,238
Welcome.

687
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:41,747
I thought there would be a traffic jam…

688
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:45,625
I see. You took the subway
to avoid traffic

689
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:47,753
but you got the exits mixed up.

690
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:55,844
Where should we go?

691
00:51:07,272 --> 00:51:08,565
Oh, no!

692
00:51:08,648 --> 00:51:09,775
Hold on.

693
00:51:09,858 --> 00:51:11,526
-I'm sorry. Oh, no.
-What is this?

694
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:13,570
-Oh, no. Wait.
-My hair.

695
00:51:13,653 --> 00:51:15,071
I'm sorry.

696
00:51:15,155 --> 00:51:16,323
Are you okay?

697
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:19,159
-That stings.
-It must hurt a lot. I'm so sorry.

698
00:51:20,786 --> 00:51:22,662
What?

699
00:51:30,796 --> 00:51:31,838
Oh, no. I'm sorry.

700
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:34,299
Oh, no. I'm so sorry.

701
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:36,468
Oh, no.

702
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:53,360
I'm an idiot, right?

703
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:55,946
Yes. You are.

704
00:51:56,029 --> 00:51:58,573
I thought long and hard,

705
00:51:58,657 --> 00:52:01,326
but I really didn't know how to react.

706
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:06,414
I really wasn't prepared for it.

707
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:15,382
I can't believe him.

708
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:17,843
The first thing he said was…

709
00:52:18,426 --> 00:52:19,553
Hold on.

710
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:23,265
But we weren't planning to have a baby.

711
00:52:24,891 --> 00:52:26,393
Aren't you dumbfounded?

712
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:29,396
What did you expect him to say?

713
00:52:30,272 --> 00:52:33,900
I expected him to at least say,
"I'm really happy."

714
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:35,735
"Is the baby healthy?"

715
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:37,487
"Congratulations."

716
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:38,989
He could have said many things.

717
00:52:45,203 --> 00:52:47,789
What? What is it?

718
00:52:49,958 --> 00:52:52,919
You must really love him.

719
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:57,799
I thought he'd be much more mature.

720
00:52:57,883 --> 00:53:00,927
But he turned out to be a baby
once we got married.

721
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:02,846
He's still a bit immature.

722
00:53:04,472 --> 00:53:07,475
I married him
because I thought I could rely on him,

723
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:08,852
but I was wrong.

724
00:53:09,394 --> 00:53:11,855
I thought he'd be on my side,

725
00:53:13,148 --> 00:53:14,941
but we kept disagreeing.

726
00:53:18,278 --> 00:53:20,196
No relationship is easy.

727
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:22,115
Even with your parents.

728
00:53:22,198 --> 00:53:23,867
I've never been comfortable

729
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:26,620
in my relationship with my father.

730
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:31,833
Parents, children, spouses, siblings…

731
00:53:31,917 --> 00:53:33,752
It's more difficult and exhausting

732
00:53:34,544 --> 00:53:35,712
since they're family.

733
00:53:35,795 --> 00:53:37,589
That's why you become more upset

734
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:40,133
and hurt.

735
00:53:43,762 --> 00:53:45,722
I'm glad I decided…

736
00:53:47,474 --> 00:53:49,142
to never get married.

737
00:53:51,353 --> 00:53:52,562
Don't you think so?

738
00:53:53,855 --> 00:53:56,608
What's wrong? Are things
not working out with Director Jin?

739
00:54:00,403 --> 00:54:02,489
We broke up.

740
00:54:07,953 --> 00:54:10,830
There's still time until the baby is born,

741
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:12,540
so take your time preparing.

742
00:54:12,624 --> 00:54:14,626
Raising a baby is expensive.

743
00:54:15,418 --> 00:54:18,630
We're barely paying rent
and making ends meet.

744
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:21,967
I'm still not giving you half,
so don't bring it up again.

745
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:24,469
I heard English kindergartens
are really pricey.

746
00:54:25,804 --> 00:54:27,806
You even thought of that?

747
00:54:27,889 --> 00:54:30,725
Learning English at a young age
is crucial these days.

748
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:32,185
I can't give up on that.

749
00:54:37,649 --> 00:54:39,275
You're actually happy, right?

750
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:44,030
To be honest…

751
00:54:46,032 --> 00:54:48,785
I'm worried that I won't be

752
00:54:50,036 --> 00:54:51,454
a good dad.

753
00:54:52,455 --> 00:54:55,709
I'm already struggling
to be a good husband.

754
00:55:00,296 --> 00:55:01,256
You'll do well.

755
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:06,678
You will.

756
00:55:08,304 --> 00:55:11,683
You've always done your best
when it came to your responsibilities.

757
00:55:11,766 --> 00:55:15,061
It was just that I was
a lousy and fussy perfectionist.

758
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:22,652
Are you really going
to end things with Si-woo?

759
00:55:29,659 --> 00:55:31,202
Hey, Ha-kyung.

760
00:55:34,581 --> 00:55:37,250
You can't maintain
a relationship if it's one-sided.

761
00:55:37,751 --> 00:55:40,211
Exactly why does he want to break up?

762
00:55:41,504 --> 00:55:42,630
I'm not sure.

763
00:55:43,339 --> 00:55:45,008
There were many reasons,

764
00:55:45,091 --> 00:55:46,259
but it's obvious.

765
00:55:47,343 --> 00:55:48,803
I'm just not good enough for him.

766
00:55:49,387 --> 00:55:52,640
Hey, don't be ridiculous.
You're a terrific woman.

767
00:55:53,224 --> 00:55:54,225
Okay?

768
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:55,894
You're smart, competent,

769
00:55:55,977 --> 00:55:58,188
responsible, and athletic.

770
00:55:58,271 --> 00:56:01,066
Do you still not know
how charming you are?

771
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:05,070
-You dumped me too.
-What?

772
00:56:09,574 --> 00:56:11,326
That was because…

773
00:56:11,409 --> 00:56:13,328
Forget it. That's water under the bridge.

774
00:56:15,455 --> 00:56:17,707
Getting dumped like that twice means

775
00:56:18,291 --> 00:56:20,502
I'm not suited to date anyone.

776
00:56:21,086 --> 00:56:22,128
Come on.

777
00:56:23,171 --> 00:56:24,756
So treat your wife well.

778
00:56:24,839 --> 00:56:26,382
Stop drinking.

779
00:56:26,466 --> 00:56:29,803
Buy some flowers or a gift
at the department store before it closes.

780
00:56:30,553 --> 00:56:31,387
Bye.

781
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:34,307
I was the lousy one.

782
00:56:35,517 --> 00:56:37,560
It wasn't because of you.

783
00:56:39,979 --> 00:56:42,524
You're a good person, Ha-kyung.

784
00:56:48,029 --> 00:56:49,155
Bye.

785
00:57:12,428 --> 00:57:14,013
LEE SI-WOO'S FATHER

786
00:57:20,228 --> 00:57:21,396
Hello?

787
00:57:22,188 --> 00:57:23,731
I was never happy

788
00:57:24,399 --> 00:57:27,235
to be his son.

789
00:57:27,902 --> 00:57:29,404
It wasn't my fault.

790
00:57:30,155 --> 00:57:31,656
But my parents…

791
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:35,660
blamed me

792
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:38,079
for being born into this world.

793
00:57:39,622 --> 00:57:41,040
"It's your fault."

794
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:45,628
"You're the reason why

795
00:57:47,046 --> 00:57:49,132
your mother sacrificed her life."

796
00:57:49,966 --> 00:57:52,427
Then she passed away
at an early age due to illness.

797
00:57:53,595 --> 00:57:56,890
My father even blamed her death on me.

798
00:57:59,726 --> 00:58:00,935
"You're the reason why

799
00:58:02,145 --> 00:58:04,105
your mother died early."

800
00:58:04,772 --> 00:58:06,107
How harsh of him.

801
00:58:07,859 --> 00:58:10,236
They shouldn't have had me
if they weren't confident.

802
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:12,989
Parents who give birth

803
00:58:13,072 --> 00:58:16,493
and blame everything on their child…

804
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:20,830
are the worst.

805
00:58:39,432 --> 00:58:40,642
Hey, Honey.

806
00:58:41,309 --> 00:58:42,185
I'm sorry.

807
00:58:44,729 --> 00:58:48,358
My mom's condition
is worse than I thought.

808
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:51,778
Yes. We're on our way home.

809
00:58:53,571 --> 00:58:56,908
Honey, the bus is here.
I'll call you back later.

810
00:59:03,414 --> 00:59:05,083
Sir, please give me a minute.

811
00:59:06,834 --> 00:59:08,211
Let me help.

812
00:59:08,294 --> 00:59:10,630
Okay. Thank you.

813
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:17,136
-Go ahead.
-Thank you.

814
00:59:22,183 --> 00:59:25,311
Don't cry, Se-chan. It's okay.

815
00:59:30,608 --> 00:59:31,776
I'm sorry.

816
00:59:35,321 --> 00:59:37,699
Goodness. My baby.

817
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:42,829
Taking a leave for childbirth
and childrearing will mean

818
00:59:42,912 --> 00:59:45,331
she won't be working for a year or two.

819
00:59:45,915 --> 00:59:47,458
Once that happens,

820
00:59:47,542 --> 00:59:50,044
she will lose her edge.

821
00:59:50,128 --> 00:59:53,423
If she can't get on top of her game,
she'll eventually lose her job.

822
00:59:54,674 --> 00:59:56,259
It's okay.

823
00:59:58,094 --> 01:00:00,013
Don't cry.

824
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:09,939
Hi.

825
01:00:11,107 --> 01:00:13,234
You must be exhausted. Give me that.

826
01:00:14,652 --> 01:00:15,737
What's all this?

827
01:00:21,159 --> 01:00:23,536
I couldn't even congratulate you.

828
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:25,121
I'm sorry.

829
01:00:25,663 --> 01:00:27,624
I wasn't meaning to do that.

830
01:00:28,708 --> 01:00:30,418
It was just so sudden.

831
01:00:34,839 --> 01:00:36,591
It must have been hard
to keep it to yourself.

832
01:00:36,674 --> 01:00:38,259
I'm so thankful

833
01:00:38,843 --> 01:00:40,470
and I love you so much, Yu-jin.

834
01:00:50,104 --> 01:00:52,482
I booked an appointment
with my ob-gyn next week.

835
01:00:54,859 --> 01:00:55,860
Really?

836
01:00:56,444 --> 01:00:57,737
What day?

837
01:00:57,820 --> 01:00:59,906
Let me come with you. I'll make time.

838
01:01:03,034 --> 01:01:05,370
I don't think it's right to have a baby

839
01:01:06,371 --> 01:01:08,539
when we're not prepared.

840
01:01:13,044 --> 01:01:14,545
What are you saying?

841
01:01:15,588 --> 01:01:17,423
Let's be frank. You don't want it either.

842
01:01:18,132 --> 01:01:20,843
A baby in our current situation?

843
01:01:21,803 --> 01:01:23,137
It's too much of a burden.

844
01:01:24,472 --> 01:01:27,600
Yu-jin, are you going to…

845
01:01:28,976 --> 01:01:30,311
Let's do that.

846
01:01:30,395 --> 01:01:31,521
Okay?

847
01:02:10,101 --> 01:02:11,644
Happiness…

848
01:02:13,104 --> 01:02:15,064
isn't a given in life.

849
01:02:16,190 --> 01:02:18,067
That's why we broke up.

850
01:02:18,151 --> 01:02:19,861
I could see

851
01:02:20,695 --> 01:02:23,406
that we'd never be happy
no matter how hard we tried.

852
01:02:25,241 --> 01:02:26,075
I didn't want her

853
01:02:27,618 --> 01:02:29,787
to carry my burdens.

854
01:02:31,664 --> 01:02:32,790
That's why.

855
01:02:49,098 --> 01:02:50,975
Hello, ma'am.

856
01:02:53,019 --> 01:02:56,939
-I was just passing by.
-Where is Ha-kyung?

857
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:58,107
Sorry?

858
01:02:58,191 --> 01:03:00,276
Where is my daughter?

859
01:03:09,035 --> 01:03:11,245
I'm here to see Mr. Lee Myung-han.

860
01:03:11,329 --> 01:03:12,872
Okay. One minute, please.

861
01:03:12,955 --> 01:03:15,500
Oh, are you his guardian?

862
01:03:18,044 --> 01:03:18,920
Well, yes.

863
01:03:19,921 --> 01:03:21,756
He was in a car accident.

864
01:03:22,256 --> 01:03:25,218
After doing a blood test
and a few other checkups,

865
01:03:25,301 --> 01:03:26,844
I found something strange.

866
01:03:27,595 --> 01:03:29,597
-Something strange?
-Yes.

867
01:03:34,769 --> 01:03:36,479
LEE SI-WOO

868
01:03:45,655 --> 01:03:47,281
Can you please pick up?

869
01:04:02,463 --> 01:04:03,548
You.

870
01:04:04,632 --> 01:04:06,050
Yes, ma'am.

871
01:04:06,133 --> 01:04:07,593
Let's talk.

872
01:04:09,136 --> 01:04:10,221
Sure.

873
01:04:11,681 --> 01:04:14,934
DIRECTOR JIN HA-KYUNG

874
01:04:15,017 --> 01:04:16,435
LEE SI-WOO

875
01:04:24,485 --> 01:04:28,030
Amid the clear, fall weather
throughout the country,

876
01:04:28,114 --> 01:04:30,658
a sudden cold wave advisory

877
01:04:30,741 --> 01:04:32,785
has been announced.

878
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:34,453
This sudden freezing weather

879
01:04:34,537 --> 01:04:36,956
could easily alarm our bodies.

880
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:39,750
At times like this,
it's important that you

881
01:04:39,834 --> 01:04:41,752
take care of your immune system.

882
01:05:31,010 --> 01:05:32,887
So when do you think
this cold will subside?

883
01:05:32,970 --> 01:05:34,013
As things stand…

884
01:05:34,096 --> 01:05:36,349
We may have to overturn the forecast.

885
01:05:36,432 --> 01:05:38,476
You're going to take the bullet
for what Si-woo said?

886
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:40,102
Say that again!

887
01:05:40,186 --> 01:05:41,437
What are you doing?

888
01:05:42,438 --> 01:05:43,814
Did you already know?

889
01:05:43,898 --> 01:05:45,232
You need a biopsy.

890
01:05:45,316 --> 01:05:47,234
My relationships started with love

891
01:05:47,318 --> 01:05:50,029
but my father was always
at the end of them.

892
01:05:50,112 --> 01:05:51,614
Because you'll regret it.

893
01:05:51,697 --> 01:05:54,367
You might regret it later.

894
01:05:54,450 --> 01:05:57,328
I still like you a lot.

895
01:05:57,912 --> 01:05:58,955
Do you know that?

896
01:05:59,705 --> 01:06:04,502
