00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,730
100 YEARS OF MODERN METEOROLOGY
NEW CHALLENGES

2
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:13,448
Relationships change.

3
00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:22,665
They either improve or worsen.

4
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:25,543
They change with time.

5
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:26,586
And…

6
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:31,925
they are bound to change
as emotions build up between them.

7
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:37,305
-Should we include that?
-Yes.

8
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:39,182
-Like this?
-That's nice.

9
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:53,822
Dear passengers,

10
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:58,409
we will soon be landing
at Jeju International Airport.

11
00:01:58,493 --> 00:02:02,455
Please fasten your seatbelts
and open the windows.

12
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:03,414
Thank you.

13
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:09,754
What I fear is…

14
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:12,674
I want to make it work.

15
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:17,512
I want things to work out between us.

16
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:19,514
But…

17
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,184
this is all I can do.

18
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:28,148
Loving someone moderately,

19
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:30,567
liking them moderately,

20
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,986
and being moderately stable
is what I like to do.

21
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:37,073
When I go over the line,

22
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,326
I become anxious.

23
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,248
I feel like

24
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,585
I'm a different person.

25
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:55,758
Get up. Let's go home.

26
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:58,761
So you decide.

27
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:02,724
Go to Jeju Island and make a decision.

28
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:12,901
Think carefully about whether
you can be with me in moderation or not

29
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:15,445
and make a decision.

30
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:23,286
…that the minor misunderstandings
and disagreements

31
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:27,123
affect our relationship
without our knowing,

32
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:31,252
and they drive us apart.

33
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:36,090
All that I wanted was this.

34
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:38,259
I just wanted to have

35
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:42,472
some personal time with each other.

36
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:03,284
Where did we go wrong?

37
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:11,292
How did we end up looking down a path

38
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:16,172
with no knowledge of what awaits us?

39
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:26,391
EPISODE 12
VARIATION AREA

40
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:30,770
WHEN A HOT TYPHOON CHANGES
AS IT PASSES THROUGH KOREA'S COLD AIR

41
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:34,732
INNOVATIVE WEATHER SERVICES
A STEPPING STONE TO PUBLIC SAFETY

42
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:45,118
Thanks.

43
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:52,709
I didn't know you loved Si-woo this much.

44
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:54,836
I don't know anything anymore.

45
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:58,172
I don't know where it all went wrong.

46
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:08,891
Director Jin!

47
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,436
You weren't picking up.
I was looking for you.

48
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:12,895
What's wrong?

49
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,565
There's trouble in the Situation Room.

50
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:17,066
You should hurry over.

51
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,903
I want to speak to the person in charge.

52
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,614
Where is the person in charge?

53
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:26,909
-Don't film me!
-I understand, so please calm down.

54
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,661
Let's talk outside.

55
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:31,706
Calm down? Would you be able
to calm down if you were in my shoes?

56
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:34,834
My son who was alive and well
is hospitalized right now.

57
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:37,545
I don't know what happened
or how badly he's hurt!

58
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:39,380
There's nothing I can do right now.

59
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:40,631
But what? Calm down?

60
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:44,260
Damn it. Are you kidding me right now?

61
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:46,345
How do you expect me to calm down?

62
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:47,930
That's enough!

63
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,807
Who are you? The one in charge?

64
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:51,350
Are you? Move aside.

65
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:53,394
-Move aside.
-What's going on?

66
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,940
Hey. It's you.

67
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,902
I'm Director Jin of Chief Team Two

68
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:02,445
and Forecaster Lee's superior.

69
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:04,280
Right. Director.

70
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:08,034
Did you hear about my son getting hurt?

71
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:09,869
I did.

72
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:13,081
When I heard he got hurt
at the typhoon center on Jeju Island

73
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:16,417
my heart started racing,

74
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:18,711
and I was so lost!

75
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,838
Let's talk somewhere else.

76
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:23,091
This room is a restricted area.

77
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:24,217
What did you say?

78
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,760
Please escort him out.

79
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:28,387
-Hurry, please.
-Damn it. Stay away.

80
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:29,931
Don't come near me.

81
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:32,350
Darn it! Stay away.

82
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:34,435
Who is he?

83
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:36,562
Don't come near me. Don't touch me.

84
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,397
Don't you dare touch me!

85
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:40,066
I'll report you for assault.

86
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:44,487
Hold on.

87
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,280
Sir.

88
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:49,325
You're obstructing official duties.

89
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:51,327
Jeez. So what?

90
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:52,662
Are you going to sue me?

91
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:54,539
I'm saying this because

92
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:56,624
that's how important this room is.

93
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:59,669
You can't barge in here
and cause a scene. Understand?

94
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:01,546
-Hey!
-Yes, I'm listening.

95
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:03,131
My son is important too.

96
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:06,843
He's my one and only son.
And he's the only son in two generations!

97
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,219
Damn it.

98
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:14,142
Right. You probably know well.

99
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:17,145
You and Si-woo
have quite an intimate relationship.

100
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:18,396
Right?

101
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:29,615
I'm well aware
that you guys are close enough

102
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:32,410
to go to motels together.

103
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,374
I see.

104
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,543
Your colleagues don't know, do they?

105
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:43,421
I get it.

106
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:45,590
I won't talk too loudly.

107
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:47,675
Okay.

108
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:51,512
Anyway, so it's true that you two

109
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:53,306
are in a relationship, right?

110
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:00,480
I saw you two at a motel last night too.

111
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,901
Am I wrong?

112
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:10,740
Please leave.

113
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,242
Answer me.

114
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:17,830
You can talk with me outside. Okay?

115
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:23,252
Fine.

116
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:25,421
We'll talk outside.

117
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,433
I'll take care of it, so stay here.

118
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,514
-Senior Forecaster Um.
-Yes?

119
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,269
COMPREHENSIVE CONTROL SYSTEM

120
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:23,896
When did it become like that?

121
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:33,948
This is Um Dong-han of Headquarters.

122
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:35,408
We just saw it.

123
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:37,368
Is it what I think it is?

124
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:39,704
Yes. It's Typhoon Number 15 Elisha

125
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:41,247
that followed Number 14 Ricky.

126
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:45,459
Around 11 o'clock today,
it was moving northeast

127
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:48,629
with a central pressure of 990mb,
a maximum wind speed of 20m per second,

128
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:51,757
and a strong wind radius of 150
from 300km west of Okinawa.

129
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:06,981
Do you have cigarettes?

130
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:10,568
This is a no-smoking area.

131
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:13,154
Then give me some coffee or something.

132
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:22,413
Damn it. The strap broke.
I need money to fix this.

133
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,206
Damn it.

134
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:34,508
Satellite Center?

135
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:38,929
At 10 p.m., it'll advance
from 120km west of Okinawa

136
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:42,516
to the southern sea of Jeju
with a central air pressure of 980mb,

137
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,145
a maximum wind speed of 28m per second,
and a strong wind radius of 200.

138
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:03,245
16 HOURS AGO

139
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,554
Hey, Bo-mi.

140
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:23,891
Dad. Were you here all night?

141
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:26,811
Yes. How are you feeling?
Are you okay now?

142
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:29,105
I'm fine. My allergies are gone.

143
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,400
The taxi is waiting. Let's go.

144
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,944
Why did you call a taxi?

145
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:36,529
I could have driven you.

146
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:39,073
Let's go, Bo-mi.

147
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:04,932
I think Dad stayed up all night for me.

148
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:08,519
Don't you think
we should have left with him?

149
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:10,187
He was never like that.

150
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,899
He never waited for us.

151
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:15,484
I waited over a decade for him.

152
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:18,070
So what if he spent the night there?

153
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:26,620
Get some rest until we arrive home.

154
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:49,101
Boys, breakfast is ready.

155
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:50,311
Honey, the food's ready.

156
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:51,854
-Hurry up.
-It's mine!

157
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:53,731
Goodness. Hey!

158
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:56,567
Hey, come here. Goodness. Not now.

159
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,402
Come here right now. Gosh.

160
00:12:58,486 --> 00:12:59,820
Here. Eat first.

161
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:01,614
-Did you pack your backpack?
-No.

162
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:02,698
Do it right now.

163
00:13:02,781 --> 00:13:05,159
Put this down. Get dressed.

164
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:06,202
Get up.

165
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:09,663
Wait. My notebook.

166
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:11,540
Your notebook?

167
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:14,001
-Did you not pack it?
-I don't know!

168
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:15,211
Where is it?

169
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:17,421
Eat this.

170
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:23,385
I'll get you some water.
Put your notebook in your backpack.

171
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:24,553
Okay.

172
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:31,519
Honey, aren't you eating?

173
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:34,313
Honey.

174
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:39,109
As if it's something so special.

175
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,154
It's only a Grade Five technical exam.

176
00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:46,200
Forget it.

177
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:48,911
Gyeol! Chan!

178
00:13:57,878 --> 00:14:00,506
Hello, I'm Forecaster Lee
from Headquarters.

179
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,174
How is it now?

180
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:04,510
As the trough passes through
five kilometers above,

181
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:06,095
it'll suck in the typhoon.

182
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:08,806
The typhoon's speed will increase
to 20 or 25km per hour.

183
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:13,394
The typhoon may hit later at this rate.

184
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:16,438
NATIONAL TYPHOON CENTER

185
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:19,608
Hello, I'm Forecaster Lee
from Headquarters.

186
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,694
-Keep talking.
-Sorry?

187
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:24,363
Well…

188
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:28,742
I think the North Pacific's anticyclone
located in Japan

189
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:30,870
isn't moving that quickly.

190
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:36,166
At this rate, it could slow down
to 10 or 15km per hour.

191
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:37,793
Look.

192
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,921
Something like this
will barely affect the typhoon's course.

193
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:44,675
I'm aware that in 2002 and 2014,
the North Pacific's anticyclone

194
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:47,344
located in Japan slowed down

195
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:49,889
the speed of the typhoons.

196
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:53,058
Typhoon Dolphin was the one in 2014.

197
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,436
-And in 2002…
-Typhoon Haishen.

198
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,314
They turned into extratropical cyclones
in variation areas

199
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,441
and only poured
a lot of rain on their way.

200
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:06,906
What was your name again?

201
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:12,494
I'm Severe Weather Forecaster
Lee Si-woo from Headquarters.

202
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:16,123
I'm Sung Mi-jin,
the director of this center.

203
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:17,583
I'm well aware.

204
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:20,044
Thanks to you, I'm here one week early.

205
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:25,090
The climate becomes
more unpredictable every year.

206
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:26,467
Coming here a week early

207
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,302
will barely make a difference.

208
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:29,637
What do you need me to do?

209
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:34,266
We're having a meeting in five minutes.

210
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:36,101
Yes, ma'am.

211
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:53,494
-Hello.
-Hello.

212
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:54,828
Hello.

213
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:56,288
-Hello.
-Hello.

214
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:00,250
Hey.

215
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:02,002
Isn't that Forecaster Lee?

216
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:09,718
Good morning.

217
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,680
This isn't a good morning at all.

218
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:14,056
We're expecting a typhoon.

219
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:17,059
That's exactly why it's a good morning.

220
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:20,479
I happen to be at the typhoon center
on Jeju Island at this moment.

221
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:21,897
Don't you feel safe?

222
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:27,236
We sent you out there to do fieldwork,
and you look even more lively.

223
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:30,698
All right.

224
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:32,116
Here comes the typhoon.

225
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:34,410
-Hello, sir.
-Hello.

226
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:35,953
Sir.

227
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:38,372
You sent a competent man for once.

228
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:39,623
Did I?

229
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:43,460
I didn't send him. Director Jin did.

230
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:45,629
Director Jin Ha-kyung?

231
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:48,048
Gosh, what's gotten into her?

232
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,594
Let's begin the meeting.

233
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,346
Satellite Center, are you ready?

234
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:57,933
There are currently two typhoons
out in the sea at Okinawa.

235
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,561
One of them has
a central pressure of 985mb

236
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:04,690
and a maximum wind speed
of 25m per second.

237
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:06,984
Compared to three hours ago…

238
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:08,402
I like you.

239
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:15,200
I really like you.

240
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,495
That's why it's too hard.

241
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:28,130
What's bothering you the most?

242
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:31,550
You and I are so different.

243
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:34,928
And I really like that.

244
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:38,766
But it's giving me a hard time.

245
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:58,619
At this rate, the typhoon
will affect us tomorrow afternoon.

246
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:00,746
It has indeed increased in speed.

247
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:04,249
But the current sea temperature
in the southwest region is 26 to 27°C.

248
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,626
The ocean heat content

249
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:08,087
and the vertical wind shear
are both under ten units.

250
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:11,965
The environment isn't suitable
for the typhoon to develop yet.

251
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:14,676
Typhoon Center.

252
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,597
What's your take on how the typhoon
isn't getting enough energy?

253
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:23,435
The ocean heat content can increase
since it's still morning.

254
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:28,107
Plus, the sea surface temperature
is 3°C higher than last year's.

255
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,776
At this rate, it's highly likely

256
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:33,195
that it'll receive energy in our waters.

257
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:38,367
How powerful will it be
when it hits our land?

258
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,285
By that time,

259
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:44,414
its CI value will be 2.5 to 3.0.

260
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:48,377
As of now, we can expect it to hit Mokpo.

261
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,711
Correct.

262
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:54,007
When the typhoon hits Mokpo,
the central pressure will be 970mb

263
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:58,178
and the maximum wind speed
will be at least 30m per second.

264
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:01,223
This could be more destructive

265
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:03,642
than Typhoon Prapiroon of 2018.

266
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:06,895
AVERAGE DIFFERENCES
IN SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURES

267
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:18,782
Oh, dear.

268
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:29,376
Typhoon Ricky, the 14th typhoon,
is moving north toward Korea.

269
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:31,920
The eye of the typhoon is very clear

270
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:34,089
which shows how powerful the typhoon is.

271
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:37,050
In the center of the typhoon is a gale

272
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:39,094
with a speed of 100km per hour.

273
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:43,098
It's important to know
the path of the typhoon…

274
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,474
-Mom.
-Yes?

275
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:47,019
Do you know how fast 100km per hour is?

276
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:49,313
I'm not sure.

277
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:52,858
The distance between Seoul
and Jeonju is about 200km.

278
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:55,444
That means we can get there
in just two hours.

279
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,321
Isn't that crazy?

280
00:19:57,404 --> 00:19:59,198
That was impressive.

281
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:01,575
I learned this during my KMA field trip.

282
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:04,119
Stay on high alert in dangerous areas

283
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:06,413
and make sure to avoid injuries.

284
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:09,041
Those in farming areas
should avoid outdoor activities…

285
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:11,960
Dad was actually pretty impressive

286
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,420
when I got to see him work.

287
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:19,760
Why did you eat the ham
when you knew you shouldn't?

288
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:21,220
It just slipped my mind.

289
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:23,764
How could you forget that?

290
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:27,142
You went to the emergency center
when you were young

291
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,977
because you ate gimbap that had ham.

292
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:33,523
I'm hungry.

293
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:35,651
Do we have anything to eat?

294
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:41,823
Don't visit him again.

295
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:44,618
He's busy during
the disaster prevention season.

296
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:51,041
PETITION FOR DIVORCE

297
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:53,961
It's time for your medication.

298
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:55,754
Do you see it on the table?

299
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:59,633
-Mom.
-Yes?

300
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:02,928
Are you getting a divorce?

301
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:16,483
Take your medication.

302
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:44,303
How's your daughter?

303
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:47,347
She was discharged early in the morning.

304
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:50,350
That's a relief.

305
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:52,352
There must have been
a lot to take care of.

306
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:55,188
Her mom was the one
who took care of everything.

307
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:59,985
My entire life has been futile.

308
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:04,364
I was always proud
of how hardworking I was.

309
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:06,700
But looking back,

310
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:09,119
I was nothing but a lousy dad.

311
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:13,123
I had no idea she was allergic
and fed her that ham.

312
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:17,419
Gosh. I put my only daughter in danger.

313
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:25,052
There are various types of dads.

314
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:28,722
Having a considerate dad is great.

315
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:33,727
But I think a dad who lives his life
to the fullest is also a good dad.

316
00:22:36,229 --> 00:22:37,355
Are you comforting me?

317
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:39,941
Did it work?

318
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:41,026
Yes.

319
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:45,447
Don't worry.

320
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:50,327
Gosh. Two typhoons are around the corner,
so I need to be on my toes.

321
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:54,122
You're right. And one of them
is stronger than Typhoon Prapiroon.

322
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:57,918
By the way, you had great foresight.

323
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,921
You sent Forecaster Lee down there.

324
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:04,633
Right. It just happened that way.

325
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:13,433
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

326
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:15,143
-Thank you.
-Bye.

327
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:22,567
How many casualties
were there during Typhoon Prapiroon?

328
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:24,569
Thirty-eight deaths and missing persons,

329
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:26,530
and 366 injured.

330
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:29,032
There must have been
serious property damage.

331
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:32,577
Seventy billion won just in Seoul.
But casualties are the biggest problem.

332
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,747
By the way, is Reporter Chae okay?

333
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,501
I haven't seen her lately.

334
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:43,171
Right. She wanted a break,
so I told her to take one.

335
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:46,258
Are you guys…

336
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:49,094
What?

337
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:51,680
Getting ready to have a baby?

338
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:58,103
-Assistant Director Kim.
-Yes?

339
00:23:58,186 --> 00:24:00,981
Shouldn't you inform the press
about the briefing time?

340
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:03,817
Right. I'm so out of it.

341
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:32,137
Dong-jin.

342
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,305
Yu-jin!

343
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:36,725
Goodness. Come on!

344
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:39,186
How have you been, kid?

345
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:40,812
Took you long enough.

346
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:44,065
-I missed you so much.
-Did you?

347
00:24:44,774 --> 00:24:47,277
Gosh. You've grown a lot
since I last saw you.

348
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,906
-Hey, you're here.
-Hey.

349
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:53,325
Where's his dad?

350
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:55,327
He's moving his boat
before the typhoon hits.

351
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:56,870
-Come in.
-Okay.

352
00:24:58,205 --> 00:24:59,289
Let's go.

353
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:09,132
JEJU OFFICE

354
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:13,553
Make sure the AWS is
functioning properly first.

355
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:14,679
Yes, sir.

356
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:18,850
-Are you going too?
-I'll be here for some time,

357
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:20,936
so I should know where they're stationed.

358
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:23,939
Gosh, you're hardworking.
Don't work too late.

359
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:25,899
-Okay.
-Let's go.

360
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:27,776
Please.

361
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:35,116
What's going on?

362
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,826
It slowed down significantly.

363
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:39,871
They're analyzing it
but haven't found the cause yet.

364
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:43,583
It stopped in the sea
southwest of Jeju for an hour now.

365
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:46,670
What's going on this time? Tell me.

366
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:50,757
The typhoon has come
to a standstill in the Jeju sea.

367
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,509
We're looking into the cause.

368
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:55,553
Oh, dear.

369
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:03,645
It's 7 p.m. right now.
Typhoon Ricky suddenly turned east

370
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:06,231
and is currently
in the southwest seas of Jeju.

371
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:09,359
Could its upper and lower parts
have separated

372
00:26:09,442 --> 00:26:11,403
and affected its movement?

373
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:12,737
That could be possible,

374
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:15,532
but we can't tell
with the current satellite images.

375
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:21,037
I'd like to see
the current adiabatic chart there.

376
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:22,831
Could you carry out a special observation?

377
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:27,043
Then we need to do
a sonde observation from Seongsan.

378
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:28,670
Our observation vehicle is there.

379
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:32,799
Our observation vehicle is
around there as we speak.

380
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:35,593
Sir, should we do it?

381
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:41,141
Will you be able to tell
with the adiabatic chart?

382
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:43,184
Yes. The upper and lower parts

383
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:45,687
and the wind five kilometers above
need to be checked.

384
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:53,945
SPECIAL OBSERVATION VEHICLE

385
00:27:12,255 --> 00:27:13,465
Sir.

386
00:27:13,548 --> 00:27:16,634
How many AWSs are on Jeju Island?

387
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:17,969
Twenty-five in total.

388
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:19,220
I see.

389
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:21,723
Are we checking all of them today?

390
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:24,309
Come on.
This island is too big to do that.

391
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:27,270
We're in a hurry, so we'll only check
the eight in the eastern region.

392
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:28,772
I see.

393
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:34,319
Let's go.

394
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:36,529
What? Si-woo.

395
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:40,367
Why are you here?

396
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:43,203
Well, I'm visiting my mom.

397
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:47,540
She's my mom, and he's my brother.

398
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:49,250
Hello.

399
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:52,003
-Hi.
-Why are you here?

400
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:54,214
I was dispatched to the typhoon center.

401
00:27:54,297 --> 00:27:55,382
Hey.

402
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:57,467
-Do you work at the KMA?
-Yes.

403
00:27:58,051 --> 00:27:59,219
That's where I work.

404
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:02,097
Are you her boyfriend?

405
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,681
-What?
-Goodness.

406
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:05,809
Don't be silly. She's already married.

407
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:08,353
You've seen your brother-in-law.

408
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:09,938
You're right.

409
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:15,068
Forecaster Lee, Director Sung just called.

410
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:17,070
We need to do
a sonde observation in Seongsan.

411
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:18,947
I see. Right now?

412
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:22,033
Yes. The typhoon is being erratic.

413
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:23,910
I want to tag along!

414
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:25,954
Goodness, Dong-jin.

415
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:30,708
I want to go with you.

416
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:32,794
Yu-jin, can I tag along with him?

417
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:34,587
No, they need to work.

418
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:37,841
I want to go. Please.

419
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:39,050
I want to go.

420
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:41,469
Can they tag along

421
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:43,096
and watch us from afar?

422
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,354
Can they?

423
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:04,367
-What a surprise.
-Did you hear about the typhoon?

424
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:06,369
Took you long enough to call.

425
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:08,121
The morning news

426
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:11,374
kept telling us to be prepared for it.

427
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:14,919
Okay. I'm hanging up.

428
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:18,298
Hey. I have something
to ask you too, okay?

429
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:20,049
What is it?

430
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:24,220
It's about that guy.

431
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:26,514
I'm hanging up
if it's about Assistant Shin.

432
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:29,559
No, not him.

433
00:29:29,642 --> 00:29:34,022
I'm talking about that pale-faced guy
who's staying at your place.

434
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:35,732
Was his name Lee Si-woo?

435
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:37,650
What about him?

436
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,403
Did he mention me?

437
00:29:40,987 --> 00:29:42,447
Why would he?

438
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:45,116
Did something happen again?

439
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,577
We had dinner together. So what?

440
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:50,455
Why would you eat with him? When?

441
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:51,748
I mean… Why?

442
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:53,666
Why would you eat together?

443
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:56,377
Then what could I have done?
You weren't picking up,

444
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:58,505
and I was dying
to know about the guy upstairs.

445
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:01,549
Don't tell me you mentioned
Assistant Director Shin and me to him.

446
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:06,429
Then you should have picked up my call.

447
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:09,307
What could I do? You weren't answering.

448
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:12,393
But still, that's not right.

449
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:15,188
Why not? His director's mother

450
00:30:15,271 --> 00:30:17,148
treated him to dinner.

451
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:19,150
Why is that such a big deal?

452
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:25,490
Times have changed, Mom.

453
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:28,493
You can't just meet up with my subordinate

454
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:30,411
and ask them personal questions.

455
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:33,748
Do this once more,
and I'll never see you again.

456
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:37,210
Goodness. Calm down, will you?

457
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:39,587
Hey.

458
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:44,050
Did you catch onto it as well?

459
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:45,301
Catch onto what?

460
00:30:45,885 --> 00:30:48,555
I think that guy likes you.

461
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:55,061
By the looks of it,

462
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:57,480
I think he's… What's the word again?

463
00:30:57,564 --> 00:30:58,940
Right. Adoration.

464
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:02,277
I think he adores you.

465
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:07,156
Hello?

466
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,867
Hey, did you hang up?

467
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,370
Unbelievable.

468
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:17,667
MOM

469
00:31:22,922 --> 00:31:24,299
What's going on with them?

470
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:27,552
Is the feeling mutual?

471
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:31,264
No way. That can't be.

472
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:34,809
It's possible with Tae-kyung,
but not Ha-kyung.

473
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:37,228
She always opts for a safer choice.

474
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:51,367
Doors opening.

475
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:01,794
Doors closing.

476
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,633
-Going home?
-Yes.

477
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:10,678
-Working late?
-Yes. I'm going out for dinner.

478
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:12,305
I see.

479
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:20,939
Can I join?

480
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:43,670
-It's pretty windy.
-You're right.

481
00:32:45,004 --> 00:32:46,965
DATE OF DATA
JULY 30, 2022

482
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:57,600
Just call him first.

483
00:32:58,226 --> 00:33:01,437
-What do you mean?
-I know you're waiting for Ki-jun to call.

484
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:02,814
How did you know?

485
00:33:02,897 --> 00:33:05,483
It's obvious. I could tell.

486
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:11,239
You shouldn't drag on your fights
when you're married.

487
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:15,118
It's best that you call him, make up,

488
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:16,536
and leave tomorrow morning.

489
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:19,622
Mom. I arrived here today.

490
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:22,417
You guys can visit me during Thanksgiving.

491
00:33:24,293 --> 00:33:25,628
What's wrong?

492
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:29,298
Are you afraid that
my first marriage will fail like yours?

493
00:33:31,592 --> 00:33:32,760
Yes.

494
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,054
I'm afraid.

495
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:40,101
I got married when I was young
and didn't know any better.

496
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:43,771
That's why we clashed even more.

497
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:46,441
Forget it. I don't want to hear it.

498
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:52,530
Ki-jun is a good person. I can see that.

499
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:55,700
I don't know what it's about,

500
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:57,577
but just give in. Okay?

501
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:01,122
Extend an olive branch.

502
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:05,126
I'll take care of it.

503
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:06,794
So stop.

504
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:16,345
Care for a drink?

505
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:19,223
I need to go back to the Situation Room.

506
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:20,933
Two typhoons are headed our way.

507
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:35,156
Am I really that dense, Ha-kyung?

508
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:41,621
Am I really that untrustworthy
and difficult to deal with?

509
00:34:44,707 --> 00:34:46,125
Was I really that terrible?

510
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:49,170
Was I that irritable

511
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:51,255
and contemptible?

512
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:53,883
Well…

513
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:56,344
I can't completely deny that.

514
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:58,346
But overall,

515
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:00,515
you're a pretty decent woman.

516
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:02,809
You're competent,

517
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:05,269
responsible, and take
great care of yourself.

518
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:09,273
As long as it wasn't work-related,

519
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:11,692
you were considerate toward me.

520
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:13,194
It's just that

521
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:16,239
we weren't meant to be.

522
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:18,783
You're not bad yourself.

523
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:21,911
You're hardworking, devoted to your job,

524
00:35:21,994 --> 00:35:24,038
clear-cut, and know exactly what you want.

525
00:35:24,997 --> 00:35:28,417
Well, I can't deny
that you can be dense at times.

526
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:31,129
But you weren't that bad.

527
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:36,592
It's just that we weren't the best fit.

528
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:44,058
I had no idea
that's how you thought of me.

529
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:46,435
To be honest,

530
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:50,565
I thought you always looked down on me.

531
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:52,817
"Gosh, he's such an idiot."

532
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:55,319
"Is there anything he can do?" Like this.

533
00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:58,823
I just wished you'd do better.

534
00:35:58,906 --> 00:36:00,533
I didn't mean you were incompetent.

535
00:36:05,621 --> 00:36:07,832
Why couldn't we have
told each other this sooner?

536
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:13,629
Because we didn't think
we had to say it out loud.

537
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:15,798
But I had no idea.

538
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:17,925
That's why I misunderstood you.

539
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:20,136
Countless times.

540
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,804
You're right.

541
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:26,475
There are many things
we wouldn't know unless we express them.

542
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:33,608
There are many things
we wouldn't know unless we express them.

543
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:37,612
So why did we expect each other

544
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:41,032
to realize those things
without saying anything?

545
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:50,041
What? It's raining.

546
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:51,918
Forecaster Lee, give me a minute.

547
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:52,960
Okay.

548
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:11,145
HIGH PURITY HYDROGEN

549
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:48,557
Where are you?

550
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:50,685
Can you at least tell me where you are?

551
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:41,569
Si-woo…

552
00:38:45,948 --> 00:38:46,866
Si-woo!

553
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:50,494
Si-woo!

554
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:53,581
-Si-woo, are you okay?
-Forecaster Lee!

555
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:55,249
-Si-woo!
-Forecaster Lee!

556
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:57,543
Oh, no. 911!

557
00:38:57,626 --> 00:38:58,878
Stay awake!

558
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:06,927
I wonder how badly he's hurt.

559
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:10,222
PRESENT

560
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:13,184
Can you call the hospital in Jeju again?

561
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:14,226
Sorry?

562
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:16,354
I want to check on Forecaster Lee.

563
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:18,731
-Please call them.
-Yes, ma'am.

564
00:39:25,821 --> 00:39:28,657
Based on the last report we received,

565
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:31,494
he's thankfully
not in a critical condition.

566
00:39:32,953 --> 00:39:33,996
So?

567
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:37,458
-Sorry?
-Are you saying

568
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:40,419
you won't compensate for what has happened

569
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:43,589
because he's no longer
in critical condition? Is that it?

570
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,549
No, sir.

571
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:48,928
We will compensate
for our employee's injuries.

572
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:53,015
I only said that
because I thought you'd be curious.

573
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:54,934
Are you serious right now?

574
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:57,686
Listen up, Mr. Civil Servants.

575
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:58,813
I know

576
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:01,899
you're just trying to cover up

577
00:40:01,982 --> 00:40:03,609
and mitigate the situation.

578
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:05,361
But it won't work on me!

579
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:09,156
Excuse me.
You should be careful of what you say.

580
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,324
I don't want to hear it!

581
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:13,953
Anyway, let's get this compensation issue

582
00:40:14,036 --> 00:40:16,580
cleared up before moving on.

583
00:40:17,456 --> 00:40:18,624
Okay, sir.

584
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:22,461
Come in.

585
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:24,964
What is it?

586
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:27,967
I called the hospital a minute ago.

587
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:29,969
He was just moved to a general ward.

588
00:40:30,052 --> 00:40:32,263
-His eyes are slightly injured.
-Wait.

589
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:34,890
He hurt his eyes?

590
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:37,393
That means…

591
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:43,149
Do you know that means
a class one disability?

592
00:40:44,483 --> 00:40:47,278
Not everyone who's injured
becomes disabled.

593
00:40:47,361 --> 00:40:49,864
I know you're his father,
but you're taking this too far.

594
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:51,615
What are you talking about?

595
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:53,701
It's you people
who are stepping over the line.

596
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:57,663
You put him in danger,
and now, he's incapacitated.

597
00:40:57,746 --> 00:41:00,708
Shouldn't the government
take responsibility for it?

598
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:02,710
Am I wrong?

599
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:06,088
No, sir. You're right.

600
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:07,173
Right?

601
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:09,967
She and I see eye to eye.

602
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:11,302
Speaking of which,

603
00:41:11,385 --> 00:41:12,928
let's go to Jeju Island together.

604
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:15,723
What?

605
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:17,808
We should go there

606
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:19,477
and see how he's doing.

607
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,729
After that, we can discuss what to do.

608
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:29,695
Director Jin.

609
00:41:29,778 --> 00:41:32,740
He's your only son
and the only son in two generations.

610
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:34,492
Exactly.

611
00:41:35,367 --> 00:41:38,662
That's why I'd like to clear up
this compensation issue right now

612
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:40,539
for my son's sake.

613
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:44,084
But first, you should check on him.

614
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:48,797
That way, we can figure out
how much to compensate.

615
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:54,512
I'd like to take
the first flight out tomorrow.

616
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:56,096
Would that be okay, sir?

617
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,474
Yes. Of course.

618
00:41:59,099 --> 00:42:00,684
Will you be all right?

619
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:02,436
Of course.

620
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:05,064
See you at the airport tomorrow.

621
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:19,912
What?

622
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,873
Why would you go with them?

623
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:26,418
If they need someone,
the Management Support Team will go.

624
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:28,462
There's something urgent I must do.

625
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:30,005
No.

626
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:32,591
Two typhoons are headed our way.

627
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:34,802
Can I really not go, sir?

628
00:42:35,594 --> 00:42:37,555
No. You can't.

629
00:42:39,014 --> 00:42:41,976
Then I'd like to take a leave.

630
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:44,478
-What did you say?
-The typhoons?

631
00:42:45,187 --> 00:42:46,313
Sure, they're important.

632
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:47,982
And so are the people's safety.

633
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:51,485
But I've never taken a leave
during the disaster prevention season

634
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:53,362
while working here.

635
00:42:53,445 --> 00:42:55,072
I never took a single leave.

636
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:56,991
Not even a half-day.

637
00:42:57,074 --> 00:42:58,534
I worked like a dog.

638
00:42:58,617 --> 00:43:00,619
And so did everyone else.

639
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:01,787
Exactly.

640
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:05,749
Everyone here has a sense of duty,
and I'm not the only one on our team.

641
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:09,044
So please let me go this once.

642
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:11,422
But why does it have to be right now?

643
00:43:11,505 --> 00:43:12,631
Beats me.

644
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:15,718
Yu-jin just happened
to leave me right now.

645
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:19,138
What?

646
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:21,098
Is that why

647
00:43:21,181 --> 00:43:23,559
I haven't been seeing her lately?

648
00:43:26,353 --> 00:43:30,149
My entire marriage is at stake here.

649
00:43:32,192 --> 00:43:33,527
Please let me go.

650
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:36,530
Gosh.

651
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:46,040
Director Jin.

652
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:50,377
I'll join you on that flight
to Jeju Island tomorrow.

653
00:43:53,213 --> 00:43:54,340
Bye.

654
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:51,772
Hey.

655
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:55,067
Did you stay up all night again?

656
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:56,568
Yes.

657
00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:58,862
Hold on. Why are you here
so early in the morning?

658
00:44:59,446 --> 00:45:01,073
Let's talk.

659
00:45:09,915 --> 00:45:11,959
Tae-kyung, let's eat.

660
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:15,045
Goodness.

661
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:17,256
Tae-kyung, you can
go back to bed after eating.

662
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:23,720
What?

663
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:26,098
Where did she go at this hour?

664
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:44,408
Hello.

665
00:45:50,497 --> 00:45:52,833
You must be exhausted
from working all night.

666
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:55,043
You could have rested
and met me in the afternoon.

667
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:58,130
Aren't you signing a contract
with the publisher at noon?

668
00:45:58,755 --> 00:46:01,341
Well, signing it isn't a big deal.

669
00:46:02,342 --> 00:46:03,427
Look.

670
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:07,598
I looked over the contract
during my spare time,

671
00:46:07,681 --> 00:46:09,933
-and something bothered me.
-What?

672
00:46:11,477 --> 00:46:14,354
It's about this "exclusive publication".

673
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:15,898
What does this mean?

674
00:46:17,232 --> 00:46:19,067
I'm not entirely sure.

675
00:46:20,569 --> 00:46:21,820
Then how about

676
00:46:21,904 --> 00:46:24,281
this "royalty" part?

677
00:46:24,364 --> 00:46:28,869
It's the amount of money
I'll be receiving.

678
00:46:29,912 --> 00:46:33,624
Then shouldn't Article 11 be revised?

679
00:46:37,544 --> 00:46:40,297
Why should it be?

680
00:46:42,925 --> 00:46:44,051
Well…

681
00:46:44,718 --> 00:46:47,804
-Call the person in charge for me.
-Sorry?

682
00:46:56,813 --> 00:46:59,274
Hello, this is Jin Tae-kyung.

683
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:01,777
One minute. Here.

684
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:02,819
Thank you.

685
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:05,572
Hello?

686
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:07,616
Well, I called

687
00:47:08,116 --> 00:47:12,079
to ask you about the contract.
Article 11 regarding royalties.

688
00:47:12,829 --> 00:47:14,164
Correct.

689
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:17,543
I believe the percentage is too low.

690
00:47:17,626 --> 00:47:20,754
She writes and draws everything.
You guys just publish it.

691
00:47:21,797 --> 00:47:22,631
Me?

692
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:26,760
I'm her manager.

693
00:47:28,887 --> 00:47:29,930
Correct.

694
00:47:31,431 --> 00:47:32,808
Okay, then.

695
00:47:32,891 --> 00:47:34,935
Please call us back after discussing it.

696
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:35,936
Thank you.

697
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:41,692
They will discuss the profit percentage
among themselves

698
00:47:41,775 --> 00:47:43,318
and get back to you.

699
00:47:43,402 --> 00:47:44,861
I see.

700
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:47,739
If something in a contract

701
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:50,325
bothers you in the future as well,

702
00:47:50,409 --> 00:47:52,244
you have to ask them about it.

703
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:57,291
You could lose your rights as the creator
depending on what's written.

704
00:47:57,374 --> 00:48:00,294
You need to be meticulous, okay?

705
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:01,920
I'm a divorcée.

706
00:48:04,256 --> 00:48:05,257
So?

707
00:48:06,341 --> 00:48:07,426
What?

708
00:48:08,927 --> 00:48:10,887
I'm just saying.

709
00:48:15,851 --> 00:48:17,144
There's something

710
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:19,855
people misunderstand about penguins.

711
00:48:19,938 --> 00:48:21,064
What is it?

712
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:22,816
They think a male
and a female are cordial.

713
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:24,735
Is that not true?

714
00:48:25,527 --> 00:48:28,572
I saw how a penguin couple took great care

715
00:48:28,655 --> 00:48:30,866
of their baby in a documentary.

716
00:48:30,949 --> 00:48:32,451
Only during the breeding season.

717
00:48:33,035 --> 00:48:34,786
The next year,

718
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:37,289
they don't think twice
about mating with other penguins.

719
00:48:38,707 --> 00:48:39,666
But…

720
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:43,670
why are you telling me this right now?

721
00:48:45,255 --> 00:48:48,050
A divorce is nothing special
in the animal kingdom.

722
00:48:54,806 --> 00:48:56,850
Do you want to have breakfast?

723
00:48:57,434 --> 00:48:58,310
Sure.

724
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:12,908
What is it? You should eat too.

725
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:22,668
What is this?

726
00:49:26,588 --> 00:49:28,006
PETITION FOR DIVORCE

727
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:29,716
Read it through and sign it.

728
00:49:37,015 --> 00:49:39,643
-Honey, this is--
-This isn't a spur-of-the-moment decision.

729
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:41,436
I thought long and hard.

730
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:44,147
I wish you would
respect me and my decision.

731
00:49:54,908 --> 00:49:57,744
I'm sorry, Hyang-rae.

732
00:49:58,453 --> 00:50:01,832
I made you raise Bo-mi all by yourself.

733
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:05,752
I know how lonely you were
while I was away.

734
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:07,421
I'm truly sorry about that.

735
00:50:09,756 --> 00:50:10,966
But you see…

736
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:14,720
To an extent, I had no choice.

737
00:50:14,803 --> 00:50:17,639
-It's my job.
-Don't make excuses.

738
00:50:18,223 --> 00:50:21,977
Right. At first, you had no say

739
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:24,896
when they told you
to go to Busan or Namhae.

740
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:27,816
But after some time,
you grew to prefer that lifestyle.

741
00:50:31,611 --> 00:50:34,364
You're right. It was wrong of me.

742
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:38,243
-Who is she?
-Who are you talking about?

743
00:50:38,326 --> 00:50:40,871
The woman who sometimes appears on TV.

744
00:50:40,954 --> 00:50:43,498
-Jin Ha-kyung, was it?
-Director Jin Ha-kyung.

745
00:50:43,582 --> 00:50:45,417
Why? What about her?

746
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:46,877
I saw it.

747
00:50:47,586 --> 00:50:49,629
I saw you going to her place.

748
00:51:03,018 --> 00:51:05,228
No! It's not what you think.

749
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:08,356
You're completely misunderstanding.

750
00:51:11,985 --> 00:51:13,195
Look.

751
00:51:14,154 --> 00:51:15,572
It was work-related.

752
00:51:15,655 --> 00:51:17,407
I wasn't the only one there.

753
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:20,076
There's this forecaster
on our team called Si-woo.

754
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:23,747
She was kind enough
to let us stay at her place.

755
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:26,958
It's really not what you think.

756
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:29,503
You can check with him.

757
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:32,130
I swear on Bo-mi.

758
00:51:32,714 --> 00:51:34,925
Don't you dare drag her into this.

759
00:51:35,842 --> 00:51:37,260
All right. I won't.

760
00:51:38,011 --> 00:51:39,971
But what you just said is absurd.

761
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:42,057
You know I wouldn't cheat on you.

762
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:48,021
Right. That's what I hope.

763
00:51:49,105 --> 00:51:51,107
During our time apart,

764
00:51:51,191 --> 00:51:53,235
I've never suspected you of cheating

765
00:51:53,318 --> 00:51:54,986
because I trusted you.

766
00:51:55,737 --> 00:51:57,614
But when I saw you that day,

767
00:51:58,907 --> 00:52:00,075
it was quite painful.

768
00:52:01,159 --> 00:52:03,495
Fine, Hyang-rae. I…

769
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:08,333
How long did you stay at home
after coming to Headquarters?

770
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:12,671
I thought you and Bo-mi
were uncomfortable with my being there.

771
00:52:15,048 --> 00:52:17,008
Don't make excuses, Dong-han.

772
00:52:17,092 --> 00:52:19,719
You chose to run away
because you were uncomfortable.

773
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:21,429
Don't blame it on us.

774
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:25,100
Do you even know how I felt that day?

775
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:29,646
It was

776
00:52:30,689 --> 00:52:32,190
immature of me.

777
00:52:39,281 --> 00:52:41,324
Why do you make me feel so miserable?

778
00:52:43,451 --> 00:52:45,453
What have I ever done to you?

779
00:52:50,709 --> 00:52:52,377
I'm sorry.

780
00:52:53,086 --> 00:52:54,212
Hyang-rae.

781
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:56,256
I'll move back in right away.

782
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:58,300
Says who?

783
00:52:58,383 --> 00:53:00,176
Honey, give me one more--

784
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:01,595
I can't do this anymore.

785
00:53:01,678 --> 00:53:04,973
Just be a man and sign the divorce papers.

786
00:53:05,056 --> 00:53:06,600
Let's get a divorce

787
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:10,604
and live carefree lives
like we do right now.

788
00:53:10,687 --> 00:53:11,688
Okay?

789
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:22,801
-What's the patient's name?
-Lee Si-woo.

790
00:54:22,884 --> 00:54:25,345
And what is your relationship?

791
00:54:26,805 --> 00:54:30,350
You see, I'm Lee Si-woo's father.

792
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:31,977
I'm his guardian.

793
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:35,730
Go in that direction. He's in Room 305.

794
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:36,982
Thank you.

795
00:54:37,065 --> 00:54:39,526
By the way, how badly is he hurt?

796
00:55:32,245 --> 00:55:33,413
Are you okay?

797
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:00,190
I'm okay.

798
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:08,364
Don't cry.

799
00:56:26,216 --> 00:56:27,133
Hey, Si-woo.

800
00:56:28,968 --> 00:56:31,304
What happened to you? Tell me.

801
00:56:31,888 --> 00:56:33,473
What happened to your eyes?

802
00:56:33,556 --> 00:56:35,475
Tell me what happened.

803
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:37,894
Is that you, Father?

804
00:56:37,977 --> 00:56:39,938
Yes. It's me. Your father.

805
00:56:40,021 --> 00:56:41,981
Goodness. Look at you.

806
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:45,360
He's doing worse than I thought.

807
00:56:47,028 --> 00:56:49,405
How did you know I was here? No.

808
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:51,282
-Why did you come?
-You idiot.

809
00:56:51,366 --> 00:56:53,952
How could I sit still
after hearing that you were hurt?

810
00:56:54,035 --> 00:56:57,163
I couldn't reach you. I was so frustrated

811
00:56:57,247 --> 00:56:59,999
that I barged into your workplace.

812
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:03,211
-You went there?
-Hey, don't you worry.

813
00:57:03,294 --> 00:57:05,713
I even met the Director General.

814
00:57:05,797 --> 00:57:09,342
I made sure he'd compensate us,
so leave this up to me.

815
00:57:09,425 --> 00:57:11,803
I'll take care of everything, okay?

816
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:17,725
By the way, did you only hurt your eyes?

817
00:57:17,809 --> 00:57:20,270
Let me see.

818
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:24,149
Hey, you need to tell me
if you're hurting anywhere else.

819
00:57:24,232 --> 00:57:26,776
We need to be compensated
as much as possible.

820
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:27,861
Got it?

821
00:57:29,696 --> 00:57:32,240
-Director Jin.
-Yes?

822
00:57:32,323 --> 00:57:33,700
Can you make this man leave?

823
00:57:37,662 --> 00:57:39,330
-Hey, Si-woo.
-Leave.

824
00:57:39,414 --> 00:57:42,000
And go back to Seoul immediately.

825
00:57:43,209 --> 00:57:45,336
What are you talking about?

826
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:48,089
I should be by your side when you're hurt.

827
00:57:48,173 --> 00:57:50,175
Just leave already!

828
00:57:54,179 --> 00:57:57,056
You little punk. Calm down, will you?

829
00:57:57,140 --> 00:58:00,226
I heard Mr. Lee's guardian was here.

830
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:04,105
That's right. I'm his father.

831
00:58:04,189 --> 00:58:06,566
Hello, sir.
May I have a word with you outside?

832
00:58:06,649 --> 00:58:07,567
Sure.

833
00:58:10,445 --> 00:58:12,155
-Let's go.
-Okay.

834
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:22,665
He must be acting that way

835
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:26,544
because he's worried about you.

836
00:58:27,712 --> 00:58:29,380
He's not someone who would worry

837
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:32,008
because I got hurt.

838
00:58:32,634 --> 00:58:36,137
He would never come here
because he was worried about his son.

839
00:58:36,721 --> 00:58:39,182
-Si-woo--
-That's the kind of father he is!

840
00:58:40,725 --> 00:58:43,520
You didn't have to bring him here!

841
00:59:03,331 --> 00:59:06,000
I don't know what to say
now that I'm here.

842
00:59:06,084 --> 00:59:08,878
Am I an idiot or what?

843
00:59:10,713 --> 00:59:13,633
He has some burns on his face.

844
00:59:15,009 --> 00:59:16,511
Thankfully, they're not severe.

845
00:59:16,594 --> 00:59:20,473
He won't need surgery,
and there won't be any scars.

846
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:24,269
But I think he injured
his left cornea during the explosion.

847
00:59:24,352 --> 00:59:26,980
He received treatment,
so we'll keep an eye on him.

848
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:29,065
He damaged his cornea?

849
00:59:30,108 --> 00:59:33,987
That means
his eyesight has been affected, right?

850
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:37,365
The treatment was a success,
so we'll have to monitor--

851
00:59:37,448 --> 00:59:38,741
I don't care about that.

852
00:59:40,118 --> 00:59:43,538
"Damage in the left cornea
due to an explosion."

853
00:59:44,038 --> 00:59:47,500
Could you emphasize that in your note?

854
00:59:48,376 --> 00:59:52,463
My son deserves
all the compensation he can get,

855
00:59:52,547 --> 00:59:55,800
and your precious diagnosis
is extremely important.

856
00:59:56,676 --> 00:59:59,596
Do you understand what I'm saying?

857
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:02,181
Goodness.

858
01:00:31,419 --> 01:00:33,504
You should have come alone
if you were worried.

859
01:00:34,714 --> 01:00:36,090
Si-woo's father

860
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:39,510
is nothing more than a leech.

861
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:44,557
Si-woo's sick of him,
but he can't get rid of him either.

862
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:47,518
He wants to cut him off,
but it doesn't work.

863
01:00:50,938 --> 01:00:52,899
What most people think is a given

864
01:00:53,399 --> 01:00:55,401
could be something terrible for Si-woo.

865
01:01:01,866 --> 01:01:03,743
Hey, Ms. Director.

866
01:01:05,453 --> 01:01:06,913
Here you were.

867
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:09,791
What will you do about my son?

868
01:01:13,294 --> 01:01:15,296
I just spoke with his doctor.

869
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:18,508
He could lose his sight.

870
01:01:20,468 --> 01:01:21,594
His sight?

871
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:23,805
He damaged his cornea.

872
01:01:23,888 --> 01:01:25,056
What will you do?

873
01:01:25,139 --> 01:01:28,559
That young kid has gone blind now.

874
01:01:29,977 --> 01:01:31,479
Keep this in mind.

875
01:01:31,562 --> 01:01:34,440
You better give
a hefty compensation, or else.

876
01:01:35,274 --> 01:01:38,528
Don't try to be sly
and cut down on the amount.

877
01:01:38,611 --> 01:01:41,614
If you do, I'll contact the Blue House

878
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:43,616
and post about this online.

879
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:44,742
Got it?

880
01:01:45,827 --> 01:01:47,662
If that happens,

881
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:53,626
either you or the Director General
will get sacked. Right?

882
01:01:54,502 --> 01:01:57,422
So don't turn this into a big deal.

883
01:01:57,505 --> 01:02:00,591
Just give me the compensation. Got that?

884
01:02:04,846 --> 01:02:06,514
You can talk with me about that.

885
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:11,394
Why do you keep butting in?

886
01:02:11,477 --> 01:02:13,563
I'm Han Ki-jun,
a spokesperson for the KMA.

887
01:02:14,147 --> 01:02:16,190
I usually deal with the press.

888
01:02:16,274 --> 01:02:18,693
But there are also times
when I deal with people like you.

889
01:02:18,776 --> 01:02:20,528
And this is why I came here.

890
01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:26,367
-Let's go.
-Damn it!

891
01:02:27,243 --> 01:02:28,536
I don't want to hear it.

892
01:02:28,619 --> 01:02:30,580
Just call the Director General

893
01:02:30,663 --> 01:02:33,666
and tell him
to get the money ready. Go on.

894
01:02:34,167 --> 01:02:36,461
Hurry up!

895
01:02:36,544 --> 01:02:39,464
I demand at least 30 million won.

896
01:02:39,547 --> 01:02:40,548
Got that?

897
01:02:41,048 --> 01:02:42,467
Hurry up and call him.

898
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:43,926
-Go on.
-That's enough!

899
01:02:45,052 --> 01:02:46,220
What?

900
01:02:47,138 --> 01:02:48,139
Hey.

901
01:02:51,684 --> 01:02:54,061
-Let's go.
-Hey.

902
01:02:54,145 --> 01:02:56,898
Hey! You fool.

903
01:02:56,981 --> 01:02:59,108
You should be lying in bed

904
01:02:59,192 --> 01:03:01,611
if you got injured.

905
01:03:02,153 --> 01:03:05,448
-Come with me.
-I'm not letting go of this opportunity.

906
01:03:05,531 --> 01:03:06,824
Right.

907
01:03:06,908 --> 01:03:08,659
This is a great opportunity for you.

908
01:03:08,743 --> 01:03:09,911
-Right?
-What did you say?

909
01:03:09,994 --> 01:03:11,996
What's the money for this time?

910
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:14,749
Gambling? Scamming?

911
01:03:14,832 --> 01:03:15,792
Women?

912
01:03:15,875 --> 01:03:17,335
What is it this time?

913
01:03:17,418 --> 01:03:20,254
-You little--
-You embarrass me!

914
01:03:23,841 --> 01:03:25,802
So please.

915
01:03:26,636 --> 01:03:29,555
-Just disappear from my sight!
-How dare you?

916
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:57,500
Damn it.

917
01:04:04,674 --> 01:04:05,758
Don't forget.

918
01:04:06,676 --> 01:04:08,094
I want 30 million won.

919
01:04:08,970 --> 01:04:10,054
Thirty million.

920
01:04:23,276 --> 01:04:24,944
So you didn't come here to see me.

921
01:04:25,611 --> 01:04:27,780
-What?
-Right?

922
01:04:29,991 --> 01:04:31,075
Well…

923
01:04:37,623 --> 01:04:38,875
Yu-jin.

924
01:04:58,978 --> 01:05:00,897
Typhoon Ricky, the 14th typhoon,

925
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:03,691
is crossing Korea
at a speed of 30m per second.

926
01:05:06,485 --> 01:05:07,778
Let's talk.

927
01:05:10,239 --> 01:05:11,532
I want to talk.

928
01:05:15,578 --> 01:05:17,079
First of all, I'm sorry

929
01:05:17,163 --> 01:05:19,290
for bringing him here without telling you.

930
01:05:19,373 --> 01:05:20,875
-But--
-Some things in this world

931
01:05:21,459 --> 01:05:23,210
are just impossible.

932
01:05:25,171 --> 01:05:27,798
Just like how humans
can't change a typhoon's course,

933
01:05:29,008 --> 01:05:31,302
the same goes
for my relationship with my father.

934
01:05:32,261 --> 01:05:33,930
It can never…

935
01:05:35,181 --> 01:05:36,724
be changed.

936
01:05:38,851 --> 01:05:40,853
I stay true to myself

937
01:05:41,479 --> 01:05:43,356
just like you do.

938
01:05:48,903 --> 01:05:50,738
You told me to think about it.

939
01:05:53,532 --> 01:05:55,201
So I did.

940
01:05:59,538 --> 01:06:01,165
I don't think I can do it.

941
01:06:02,124 --> 01:06:04,043
What are you saying?

942
01:06:09,507 --> 01:06:13,344
When a hot typhoon changes

943
01:06:13,427 --> 01:06:16,180
as it passes through Korea's cold air

944
01:06:17,598 --> 01:06:21,477
we call it a variation area.

945
01:06:26,816 --> 01:06:28,275
I'll let you go.

946
01:06:29,902 --> 01:06:31,654
So run away from me.

947
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:40,413
Lee Si-woo, a hot typhoon,
met me, the cold air.

948
01:06:40,496 --> 01:06:41,706
And then,

949
01:06:42,707 --> 01:06:45,960
he eventually bid farewell to me.

950
01:06:56,721 --> 01:06:57,888
I'm sorry

951
01:06:58,848 --> 01:07:00,182
that this is all I'm worth.

952
01:07:04,103 --> 01:07:05,312
Let's…

953
01:07:08,774 --> 01:07:10,026
break up.

954
01:07:21,454 --> 01:07:23,039
How did we end up

955
01:07:24,457 --> 01:07:27,001
looking down a path with no knowledge

956
01:07:27,084 --> 01:07:29,086
of what awaits us?

957
01:08:02,661 --> 01:08:04,038
Go back to the hospital right now.

958
01:08:04,121 --> 01:08:06,499
I have no problem working.

959
01:08:06,582 --> 01:08:08,167
Is there a way for us to know sooner?

960
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:09,877
We could launch a sonde
at the eastern side of Jeju

961
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:11,420
and at the sea west of the island.

962
01:08:11,504 --> 01:08:15,549
I'm sure you know it's highly dangerous
in these weather conditions.

963
01:08:16,133 --> 01:08:18,427
There's no such thing
as an accurate forecast.

964
01:08:18,511 --> 01:08:20,179
We can only make predictions.

965
01:08:20,262 --> 01:08:22,139
-Three, two, one.
-Even if they're just predictions,

966
01:08:22,223 --> 01:08:23,849
I believe it is our duty to use

967
01:08:23,933 --> 01:08:26,393
the most accurate data possible
to make such predictions.

968
01:08:28,104 --> 01:08:30,314
You and I are married.
That's our conclusion.

969
01:08:30,397 --> 01:08:31,774
So tell me if you regret it.

970
01:08:31,857 --> 01:08:33,400
Did you make my daughter cry?

971
01:08:33,484 --> 01:08:34,819
Sir, it's not what you think.

972
01:08:34,902 --> 01:08:37,780
I don't think I can do this.

973
01:08:37,863 --> 01:08:39,198
I can't see you, Tae-kyung.

974
01:08:39,281 --> 01:08:41,325
Let's break up, Si-woo.

975
01:08:43,786 --> 01:08:48,582
