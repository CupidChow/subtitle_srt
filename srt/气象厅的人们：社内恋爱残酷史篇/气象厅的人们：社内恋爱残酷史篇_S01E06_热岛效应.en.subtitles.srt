1
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,364
We were at the rainwater drainage station
and had a drink afterward.

2
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:15,283
I didn't know he'd get drunk so quickly.

3
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:19,370
You could have called a driver.

4
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:22,582
You see…

5
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:24,876
What?

6
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:27,253
Did you leave home?

7
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,258
Yes.

8
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:34,552
It's a long story.

9
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:36,888
It's a long story.

10
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:42,227
What about you?
Why are you here at this hour?

11
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:45,271
It's a long story for me too.

12
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,609
Do you not want to answer me
or do you not have a choice?

13
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:51,653
What about you, Director Jin?

14
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,614
What do you mean?

15
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:57,242
Normally, you'd send
a drunk colleague back home,

16
00:01:57,325 --> 00:01:59,077
not bring them to a motel.

17
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,336
Past wounds are nasty.

18
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:10,505
Mr. Lee.

19
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:14,926
IMI MOTEL

20
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:16,094
What?

21
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:19,639
I thought you had left already.
Were you still here?

22
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:23,935
You think you're all better now.

23
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:26,104
But when you look back,
they're still infected.

24
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:28,398
Now that we've met,
I hope to see you more often.

25
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:30,567
Go home safely.

26
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:48,459
The deeper your memories
of those wounds are,

27
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:51,462
the more cowardly you become.

28
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:56,134
Like air stuck in a forest of skyscrapers,

29
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:58,595
you're trapped in self-pity and pain.

30
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:03,057
You spin around in circles
in the same place

31
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,935
and isolate yourself.

32
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:14,694
EPISODE 6
HEAT ISLAND PHENOMENON

33
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:18,114
The first heat wave warning
of this year in Seoul has been issued.

34
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:21,492
Due to the heat island phenomenon
where heat is trapped,

35
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:24,370
this scorching weather
will continue for some time.

36
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:27,332
Roads that become hot over the day

37
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:29,709
and heat from air-conditioner fans

38
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:31,628
are raising the temperature even more.

39
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,504
More from Reporter Park Cheol-min.

40
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:45,475
It's steaming hot this morning.

41
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,144
What are you doing
under the sweltering heat?

42
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,906
Is it already that time of the year?

43
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:07,538
You should stop doing this.

44
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:09,415
No one eats it anyway.

45
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:11,334
You're spitting. Go away.

46
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:13,378
I'm worried you might get sick again.

47
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:39,279
It's disaster prevention season,

48
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:41,322
so he's staying at the KMA.

49
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:43,283
I thought he was going to live with us.

50
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:44,409
What?

51
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,662
Yes. He was.

52
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:50,290
-But…
-When is he coming back?

53
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:53,668
Well…

54
00:04:55,044 --> 00:04:56,296
Once the rainy season ends.

55
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:11,060
Damn, it's hot.

56
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:27,327
Gosh.

57
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:35,585
Goodness, I wonder
how hot it'll get today.

58
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,004
Hello.

59
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:46,971
Since an anticyclone is over Korea,

60
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:48,389
-a lot of sunlight
-I'm sorry.

61
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:50,308
and heat are moving into the country.

62
00:05:57,231 --> 00:05:58,816
Although temporary,

63
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:02,111
the temperature in June
is rising higher than average.

64
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,447
You're here early.

65
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:05,406
Sorry?

66
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,242
Isn't Chief Team Two
on night duty starting today?

67
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:09,744
Starting today?

68
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:11,662
Right.

69
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:14,373
Your recent move
from Gangwon Office must've confused you.

70
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,085
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

71
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:15,351
Butter.

72
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:18,688
Butter.

73
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,695
The smell.

74
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:42,628
INCOMING CALL
APARTMENT 1302

75
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,344
CALLING
APARTMENT 1201

76
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:22,585
Yes?

77
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:26,172
-Oh, you were home.
-Yes.

78
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:27,757
How may I help you?

79
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,301
We texted you several times,

80
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:31,969
but you didn't reply.

81
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:34,555
A new trainee will come here soon,

82
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:36,641
so we'd like you to move out.

83
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:38,476
By next week, if possible.

84
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:40,770
By next week?

85
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:42,897
The room needs maintenance

86
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,066
before we welcome a new trainee.

87
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:47,652
You can only stay here for a month anyway.

88
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:49,111
I'm sure you knew that.

89
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,404
Right.

90
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:52,281
Please move out by next week.

91
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:53,991
-Goodbye.
-Okay.

92
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,277
You ran even in this weather?

93
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:32,780
Do you not sleep in
even when you're working nighttime?

94
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:36,659
What's good here?

95
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:40,079
Let's reconsider this.

96
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:42,873
Reconsider what?

97
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:44,625
You and me.

98
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:49,046
"Just as a loud noise is created

99
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,799
when a cloud meets another cloud,

100
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:55,511
I wish I could be bold enough
to shout unconsciously

101
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:59,265
in this relationship I have with you."

102
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:03,185
"Just as a bright light appears

103
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,730
when a cloud suddenly meets another cloud,

104
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:07,607
I wish being with you

105
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:10,776
could shed light on the path
I have wandered away from."

106
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:14,071
By the way, what do you think this means?

107
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:16,115
This last part.

108
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:19,243
"You shine brightly when you tell me

109
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:22,371
that rain needs to meet another rain
for them to get drenched."

110
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:30,004
"Our similarities help us
understand each other's hearts."

111
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,798
Maybe that's what it means.

112
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:34,884
Give me an example.

113
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:39,555
Something like this.

114
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,766
-Come on.
-What?

115
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:43,768
-What was that?
-Back then, I didn't know

116
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:47,730
-What?
-how much pain we'd have to endure

117
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:50,775
to understand the beautiful phrase,

118
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:54,153
"Rain needs to meet
another rain for it to get drenched."

119
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:57,323
Why suddenly?

120
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:04,705
I thought it would be okay,
but I guess I was wrong.

121
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:11,003
My mind has been racing

122
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:13,339
ever since I saw you
yesterday at the motel.

123
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,342
My past trauma keeps resurfacing,

124
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:18,094
and I get upset.

125
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:22,264
That woman has nothing to do with me.

126
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:26,727
I want to believe that and move on.

127
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:30,606
But I'm still trapped at that moment.

128
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:36,779
I know that you're not lying to me.

129
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:39,156
That's why it's an even bigger problem.

130
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:41,992
It's clear you're telling me the truth,

131
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:44,495
but I still can't trust you.

132
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:48,290
Director Jin.

133
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,167
Let's take some time to think this over.

134
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:55,297
I'm not doing this for you.
I'm doing this for me.

135
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:03,347
I'll go first. Enjoy your food.

136
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:08,060
It was my father.

137
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:13,357
I went to the motel last night…

138
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:17,570
because of him.

139
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:26,704
Mr. Lee Si-woo?

140
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:29,331
I'm here to see Mr. Lee Myung-han.

141
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:35,504
Come in.

142
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:40,676
Hey, why don't you just fold?

143
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:42,470
What's taking you so long?

144
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:46,515
-Damn it.
-Myung-han.

145
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,559
-Your son is here.
-Here you go.

146
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:50,978
-You got a high score.
-He's one handsome man.

147
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:53,647
-Si-woo. You're here.
-What was that?

148
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,192
Come…

149
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:57,818
Hey, Si-woo!

150
00:12:57,902 --> 00:12:59,278
Si-woo…

151
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:01,822
Damn it. Si-woo!

152
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:03,365
Hey!

153
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,284
Hey, wait!

154
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:07,286
Come on, Si-woo.

155
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,039
You punk.

156
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:11,957
How could you just leave like that?

157
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,167
You're gambling again?

158
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,753
Is this why
you've been blowing up my phone?

159
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:19,548
I had no choice.
You're the only son I have.

160
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,967
First, give me the money you brought.

161
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,013
What's going on?

162
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:27,306
Damn it.

163
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:29,433
-Did you not bring it?
-I don't have…

164
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:32,728
-any money.
-Why don't you?

165
00:13:32,811 --> 00:13:34,355
I'm very well aware

166
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:37,191
that you landed a nice job
and get paid every month.

167
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:39,151
Last year,

168
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:41,320
you took all my savings.

169
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:43,155
Did I?

170
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:46,742
I'm fine with coins too,
so give me all you have.

171
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:50,329
I'm about to lose everything and die here.

172
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:51,247
Okay?

173
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,290
-Hurry.
-I said I had no money!

174
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:56,043
I'm staying at the training center
because I have no money for a deposit!

175
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:57,419
Can't you take out a loan?

176
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:01,757
Don't civil servants
receive loan benefits?

177
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:05,594
Don't ever call me again.

178
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,263
If you do,

179
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,431
I'll report you to the police.

180
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:11,892
You bastard.

181
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:14,103
Hey, stop right there.

182
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:15,896
You little… Hey.

183
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:18,107
Gosh.

184
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:20,109
Damn it.

185
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:24,822
What about you?

186
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:27,199
Why are you here at this hour?

187
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:31,328
It's a long story for me too.

188
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:35,833
Do you not want to answer me
or do you not have a choice?

189
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:38,168
What about you, Director Jin?

190
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:41,589
"Director Jin"?

191
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:44,925
What do you mean?

192
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:47,970
Normally, you'd send
a drunk colleague back home,

193
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:51,015
not bring them to a motel.

194
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:31,281
The community service center?

195
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:33,033
Why?

196
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:35,619
To register our marriage.

197
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:38,622
We need to give them
our marriage certificate

198
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:41,458
to get the housing loan for newlyweds.

199
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:43,544
Really?

200
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,839
What about a contract extension
for our current house?

201
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:49,216
It's too expensive,
and there are no benefits.

202
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,641
Why the long face?

203
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:01,061
Don't tell me…

204
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,190
that house has already grown on you.

205
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:07,568
It has.

206
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:09,945
Oh, dear.

207
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:12,740
Yu-jin.

208
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:14,742
Home is anywhere

209
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:17,995
we settle down and grow fond of.

210
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:21,331
I'll look for a nice place,
so don't you worry.

211
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:22,458
Okay?

212
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:26,962
Right. I'll give you
my seal and identification card.

213
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,630
Can you register it for me?

214
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:30,758
I'd love to come with you,

215
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:32,801
but my column is due tomorrow.

216
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,054
-Will that be okay with you?
-Of course.

217
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:36,221
Great.

218
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:42,895
-Do you want mine?
-What?

219
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:45,606
You barely ate any.

220
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:47,274
Do you not like chicken?

221
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:52,696
Gosh. You even left a drumstick.

222
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:05,375
-Did you have lunch?
-Yes, sir.

223
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:08,087
-Did you?
-Yes, sir.

224
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:11,673
I had a bit of work to do,
so I just had gimbap.

225
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:15,552
Goodness. You should still eat properly.

226
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:18,138
-Your well-being comes before work.
-Right.

227
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:21,225
-By the way, what are you working on?
-Sorry?

228
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:22,226
It's nothing.

229
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:23,602
What is it?

230
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:25,813
To be honest,

231
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:27,773
the director asked me to write a column.

232
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:30,025
A column? What kind?

233
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:33,195
-A themed story.
-Themed…

234
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:37,282
He told you to write that?

235
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:40,786
Yes, I did.

236
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:42,788
But that's my job.

237
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:45,541
We need to send our paper
to the printing office soon,

238
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:47,042
but you haven't finished yet.

239
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,920
I can't just sit still
and wait until you finish.

240
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:53,048
I'm just adding
the finishing touches right now.

241
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,634
I'm pretty much done.

242
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:58,178
Then finish it and hand it over.

243
00:18:58,262 --> 00:18:59,388
What about him?

244
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:01,473
You can write yours too.

245
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:03,600
Both of you can write one.

246
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:06,478
I'll choose the better one. Okay?

247
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:11,275
Assistant Director Kim, good luck.

248
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:14,736
You too.

249
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,155
-Thank you.
-Let's do this.

250
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:20,784
-Deputy Director Han, good luck.
-What?

251
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:23,328
Thanks. You too.

252
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:30,377
Fine.

253
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:35,591
I'll finish it. I'll finish it for sure.

254
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:39,011
I'll make sure to finish it.

255
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:49,188
MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE

256
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:52,191
WIFE
SEAL OR SIGNATURE

257
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:17,799
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

258
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,058
Done.

259
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:29,186
-Already?
-Yes.

260
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:31,271
Oh, are you not done yet?

261
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,023
Well…

262
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:37,027
I still have other work to do.

263
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:39,279
It's endless.

264
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:42,241
Don't worry about me. Go first.

265
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:43,325
Yes, sir.

266
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:49,539
Okay, then. See you tomorrow.

267
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:50,707
Bye.

268
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:52,834
Good work today.

269
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:02,594
Damn it.

270
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:15,732
You're here early.

271
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:18,360
I forgot that we were
on night duty starting today

272
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:20,237
and came 12 hours early.

273
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,282
I thought I was late this morning,
so I rushed over here.

274
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:25,284
But Chief Team One was having a meeting.

275
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:27,661
How could you always
be tardy to our meetings,

276
00:21:27,744 --> 00:21:29,121
but not theirs?

277
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:34,626
You should have just gone home
last night when I got drunk.

278
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,169
I must have been a lousy drunk.

279
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:38,005
It's disaster prevention season.

280
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:40,716
We're so busy,
we need all the help we can get.

281
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,884
I can't afford to lose
a crucial member to the streets.

282
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:46,138
Don't make me laugh. I'm only a burden.

283
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:49,766
-Did you have dinner?
-Not yet. I'm not hungry.

284
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:52,436
I'll give you 30 minutes.
Go grab something to eat.

285
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:54,604
Okay.

286
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:00,694
Gosh.

287
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:02,696
Hey.

288
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:07,326
What's wrong?

289
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,543
Why was he glaring at me?

290
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:21,131
-Hello.
-Hello.

291
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:28,680
This is…

292
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:31,767
Hey, I had dinner.

293
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:38,231
Didn't we confirm this already?

294
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:42,277
This is bad.

295
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,571
The temperature is high,
and so is the radiation.

296
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:48,033
The sun will set soon,
but the temperature is still 28°C.

297
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:51,369
Seoul is going to melt
due to the heat island phenomenon.

298
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:54,414
Do you think
the atmospheric flow will change?

299
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:58,043
Who knows?
Maybe we'll get a sudden rain shower.

300
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:16,103
Call me. Mom is really sick.

301
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:41,044
How could she not call
when I said you were sick?

302
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:42,671
Just let her be.

303
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:46,007
She's on night duty starting today.

304
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:49,344
Still, she should at least text
and ask how you're doing.

305
00:23:49,427 --> 00:23:53,056
We must have been too lenient on her,
seeing how impudent she's become.

306
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:56,393
She probably thinks
we're trying to fool her

307
00:23:57,060 --> 00:24:00,230
and make her come home
by saying that I'm sick.

308
00:24:04,901 --> 00:24:05,819
TAE-KYUNG

309
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:09,781
What's the probability
of a rain shower at dawn?

310
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:14,161
Gosh. Are you serious?

311
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:21,835
SUPPLEMENTARY WEATHER CHART

312
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:35,098
It's pretty quiet today.

313
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:36,433
It can't always be noisy.

314
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:40,645
There could be localized heavy rain,
so please monitor it.

315
00:24:41,354 --> 00:24:42,606
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

316
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:13,220
Is something going on?

317
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:16,973
What?

318
00:25:17,557 --> 00:25:18,808
Did you say something?

319
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:22,020
Something seems to be on your mind.

320
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:23,021
Well…

321
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:26,733
It's just a family matter.

322
00:25:34,532 --> 00:25:35,742
Honey.

323
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:41,456
Can I take the Grade Five
technical exam again?

324
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,097
DIRECTOR JIN HA-KYUNG

325
00:26:02,435 --> 00:26:04,062
-Director Jin.
-Yes?

326
00:26:04,145 --> 00:26:05,563
Should I answer it instead?

327
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:06,773
No, it's okay.

328
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:10,318
Jin Ha-kyung of Chief Team Two speaking.

329
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:14,281
Sorry?

330
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:17,075
You have a guest.

331
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:21,037
He keeps insisting on seeing you.

332
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:22,706
Yes, ma'am.

333
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:24,666
Let me.

334
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:26,835
Hello, Director Jin.

335
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:29,713
My name is Lee Myung-han.

336
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:31,715
I'm Lee Si-woo's father.

337
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:39,055
I have something urgent

338
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:42,517
to tell you about my son.

339
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,518
Do you think

340
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:47,272
you could spare me ten minutes?

341
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:49,649
Sure.

342
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:13,882
This brat still hasn't called.

343
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:40,116
Darn it.

344
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:57,425
No.

345
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:58,968
I shouldn't.

346
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:13,858
No, you crazy bastard. What should I do?

347
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:29,999
Are you Mr. Lee Si-woo's father?

348
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:32,127
Yes, I am.

349
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:34,003
I'm his father.

350
00:28:34,712 --> 00:28:36,464
I see. Hello.

351
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:40,385
So how can I help you?

352
00:28:45,014 --> 00:28:48,560
To be honest,
I have something urgent to tell you.

353
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:55,984
Goodness. I feel bad
about saying this to a stranger.

354
00:28:57,444 --> 00:28:58,903
But then again,

355
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:01,364
you two seem to have something special.

356
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:05,368
What do you mean?

357
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:08,329
I'm well aware
that you guys are close enough

358
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:11,958
to go to motels together.

359
00:29:17,046 --> 00:29:17,922
I see.

360
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:20,091
Your colleagues don't know, do they?

361
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:22,969
I get it.

362
00:29:23,052 --> 00:29:25,138
I won't talk too loudly.

363
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:27,223
Okay.

364
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:31,060
Anyway, so it's true that you two

365
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:32,854
are in a relationship, right?

366
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:40,111
I saw you two at a motel last night too.

367
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:51,581
I'm sorry, but why did you want to see me?

368
00:29:51,664 --> 00:29:52,874
Do you have any money?

369
00:29:54,834 --> 00:29:57,504
You seem to have a lot of work experience

370
00:29:57,587 --> 00:29:59,297
and seem to be older than him.

371
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,424
Plus, you're a director.

372
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:05,887
That must mean
you get paid more than he does.

373
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,597
You see,

374
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:10,975
I'm in dire need of money.

375
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:13,436
Do you think you could lend me some?

376
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:34,499
Hey.

377
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:36,251
Where's Director Jin?

378
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:39,420
-She left after taking a call.
-Beats me.

379
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,883
-Try calling her.
-Okay.

380
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:58,940
TAE-KYUNG

381
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:08,825
This is Director Jin Ha-kyung's phone.

382
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:11,703
Sorry?

383
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:33,725
-Ma'am, please come with us.
-Okay.

384
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:37,312
911 EMERGENCY
AMBULANCE

385
00:31:42,525 --> 00:31:44,777
Shouldn't we tell Director Jin to go home?

386
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:48,406
She's not the type who'd listen to us.

387
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:53,995
What should we do, Senior Forecaster Um?

388
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:22,774
Director Jin.

389
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,278
Your sister just called.

390
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:29,739
Your mother is very sick.

391
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:31,407
Here.

392
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:37,413
Director Jin!

393
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:39,499
Right.

394
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:41,542
Don't worry about my mom.

395
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:44,796
She sometimes says that
when we get into an argument.

396
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:47,632
-Let's go.
-She's going to the emergency room.

397
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:49,509
What?

398
00:32:49,592 --> 00:32:52,345
Your mother.
They even called an ambulance.

399
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:55,515
It seems pretty serious.

400
00:32:58,851 --> 00:33:01,104
Jin Ha-kyung. How could you do this?

401
00:33:01,604 --> 00:33:03,398
Mom is sick.

402
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:05,775
I know you're mad at her,

403
00:33:05,858 --> 00:33:07,360
but how could you be this cold?

404
00:33:07,443 --> 00:33:10,571
Shouldn't you have
at least called to check on her?

405
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:20,999
She's dying right now.

406
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:27,422
-Which hospital are you headed to?
-I don't know.

407
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:29,340
They're taking us
to the closest emergency room.

408
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:30,466
I'll call you.

409
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:33,052
Okay. I'll go there once my shift is--

410
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:36,014
Hey! I said Mom is dying!

411
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:39,809
-You know I can't leave right now.
-Come here!

412
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:40,935
Right now!

413
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:44,272
I said I got it.
I'll go once the morning team--

414
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:47,316
Unbelievable. Forget it! I'm hanging up!

415
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:52,613
Director Jin.

416
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:56,534
I'm okay. You can go in first.

417
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:00,288
Director Jin.

418
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,750
Gosh.

419
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:08,129
Currently, due to the anticyclone,

420
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:10,757
the atmosphere
will remain the same until tomorrow.

421
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,592
It'll be a hot night
due to the heat island phenomenon.

422
00:34:12,675 --> 00:34:14,052
It'll be even hotter during the day.

423
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:18,014
Anyway, the situation will remain
the same until tomorrow morning.

424
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:19,724
So go to your mom.

425
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:24,145
I'll be on the lookout.

426
00:34:30,526 --> 00:34:31,986
Do you not trust me?

427
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:37,033
You trust us to do
the work you assign us, don't you?

428
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:40,495
I do trust you.

429
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:43,831
This is my responsibility.
I need to oversee my team.

430
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:47,251
Everyone in this building
knows how responsible you are.

431
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:50,505
Right now, you need to fulfill
your responsibilities as a daughter.

432
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:56,844
Let me make it up to you, Ha-kyung.

433
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:04,393
Go on.

434
00:35:07,563 --> 00:35:09,732
Do call me if something happens.

435
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:18,032
Forecaster Lee.

436
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:19,951
Come on.

437
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:21,619
Coming, sir.

438
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:44,016
What happened to her?

439
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:48,020
I don't know.

440
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:49,981
They drew her blood and took an X-ray.

441
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:53,568
She felt sluggish and lied down,

442
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:55,153
then she felt dizzy.

443
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,989
She even threw up all her food.

444
00:35:58,072 --> 00:36:00,366
And when she got up to go to the bathroom,

445
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:05,163
she became unsteady and fell.

446
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:11,460
Seriously. She was bleeding profusely
from her forehead.

447
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:16,632
I thought she'd die right there, you brat.

448
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:24,056
And the test results?

449
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:27,602
It's going to take some time.

450
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:31,314
They have too many emergency patients,
so they're behind on the tests.

451
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:52,627
Senior Forecaster Um.

452
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,712
-You asked for this.
-Thanks.

453
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:58,049
Please check Seoul's
ground-surface temperature

454
00:36:58,132 --> 00:36:59,884
and solar radiation level
every ten minutes.

455
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:01,052
Yes, sir.

456
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:04,305
Are you checking
the movement of the anticyclone?

457
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:08,059
I am. I don't think
it will change drastically anytime soon.

458
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:10,311
Okay. Let me know if the speed increases.

459
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:11,395
Yes, sir.

460
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:29,622
SAFE COUNTRY, PEACEFUL PEOPLE

461
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:40,883
DIRECTOR JIN HA-KYUNG

462
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:42,593
DID YOU…

463
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:53,020
Did you arrive at the hospital?

464
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,167
What can I do?

465
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:17,420
What should I do?

466
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:19,005
Damn it. What time is it?

467
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:29,974
Jin…

468
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:32,685
JIN HA-KYUNG

469
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:40,109
No, I can't. This isn't right.

470
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:46,282
Damn it!

471
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:52,038
What time is it?

472
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:04,925
INNOVATIVE WEATHER SERVICES
A STEPPING STONE TO PUBLIC SAFETY

473
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:06,886
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

474
00:39:06,969 --> 00:39:09,138
-Hello.
-Hello.

475
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:11,140
-Hello.
-Hello.

476
00:39:11,223 --> 00:39:13,517
-Hello.
-Good morning.

477
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:33,496
Come on.

478
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:35,790
Where is she? Why isn't she there?

479
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:39,168
Damn it.

480
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:45,925
Good work.

481
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:47,218
Why are you…

482
00:39:47,301 --> 00:39:48,469
Goodness.

483
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:50,304
Did you spend the night here?

484
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:52,348
Yes. I was busy working.

485
00:39:54,016 --> 00:39:56,477
By the way, I don't see Director Jin.

486
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,770
Where is she?

487
00:39:57,853 --> 00:39:59,730
She left first due to personal reasons.

488
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:01,273
I see.

489
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:04,318
Why are you looking for her
this early in the morning?

490
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:07,863
It's nothing serious,
so don't worry about it.

491
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:11,700
-Should we have some hangover soup?
-Sure.

492
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:12,910
-Hey.
-That'd be great.

493
00:40:12,993 --> 00:40:14,203
-I'd love that.
-Let's go.

494
00:40:14,286 --> 00:40:15,246
Enjoy your meal.

495
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:16,705
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

496
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:25,089
This is driving me crazy.
What should I do?

497
00:40:26,298 --> 00:40:28,926
Why does he come
to our department so often these days?

498
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:30,094
I know, right?

499
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:33,139
It's as if he forgot
how mercilessly he dumped Director Jin.

500
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:34,974
I see him all the time.

501
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:37,226
He just needs her help. That's all.

502
00:40:37,309 --> 00:40:38,394
Help with what?

503
00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:40,312
-His column.
-His column?

504
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:43,023
Are you talking about that themed story?

505
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:46,360
Yes. She had helped him
with every single one of them.

506
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,487
What? No way.

507
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:50,573
I'm sure some already knew about it.

508
00:40:50,656 --> 00:40:52,366
Didn't you, Assistant Director Shin?

509
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,535
See?

510
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:57,872
Gosh, no way. What a jerk.

511
00:40:57,955 --> 00:41:02,168
If you think about it,
Director Jin is a bit soft.

512
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,170
Right, Assistant Director Shin?

513
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:08,257
Doors opening.

514
00:41:11,093 --> 00:41:12,595
I should go home.

515
00:41:12,678 --> 00:41:14,263
Why? You're not eating?

516
00:41:14,346 --> 00:41:16,640
No, I'm not hungry.
I'll see you later tonight.

517
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:18,309
-Okay. Bye.
-Okay.

518
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,604
How about dried pollack
instead of ox head?

519
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:23,647
-Sure.
-I'm excited.

520
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:26,025
Didn't I ask for all
the past commemorative speech scripts

521
00:41:26,108 --> 00:41:27,776
for World Meteorological Day?

522
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,695
Who told you to summarize them?

523
00:41:29,778 --> 00:41:32,114
The details of
the Administrator's speech aren't related

524
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:34,533
to the basic planning
of the event which is our job.

525
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:36,327
Who told you to make that decision?

526
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:38,078
I'm the director here.

527
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:39,747
I'm sorry, sir.

528
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:42,458
You always make mistakes.

529
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:45,127
Prepare them again.

530
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:01,644
Assistant Director Shin.

531
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:20,204
Here.

532
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:22,373
What about breakfast?

533
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:25,709
The kids and I had the soup you made.

534
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:27,336
I see. Did they go to school?

535
00:42:27,419 --> 00:42:28,671
Of course.

536
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:34,552
Our eldest wants to take art classes.

537
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:39,014
English, math, taekwondo, and art?

538
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:40,224
Goodness.

539
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:43,435
That's almost 800,000
to 900,000 won per month.

540
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:47,898
We'll have to do the same
for our younger one.

541
00:42:49,024 --> 00:42:51,110
Yes. I know.

542
00:42:57,658 --> 00:42:59,201
Will one year be enough?

543
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,622
I can't hold out for more than that.

544
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:05,833
Myung-ju.

545
00:43:07,626 --> 00:43:09,795
Promise me you'll come back
in a year without regrets

546
00:43:09,878 --> 00:43:11,964
even if you don't pass the exam.

547
00:43:12,631 --> 00:43:14,049
If you can promise me that,

548
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:16,010
I'll try my best to stay strong.

549
00:43:24,518 --> 00:43:25,769
You're so lucky

550
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:28,272
to have a wife like me.

551
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:32,318
Of course.

552
00:43:32,901 --> 00:43:34,445
I'm one lucky man.

553
00:43:38,741 --> 00:43:40,618
Thank you, Honey.

554
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:43,454
I promise I'll pass.

555
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:49,585
Goodness.

556
00:43:51,503 --> 00:43:53,339
This is bad.

557
00:43:53,922 --> 00:43:55,758
You cry more easily now.

558
00:43:57,509 --> 00:43:58,677
Gosh.

559
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:04,391
This coffee is good.

560
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:51,105
She's extremely dehydrated.

561
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:54,274
Her hemoglobin levels are low

562
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:56,527
as well as her electrolyte levels.

563
00:44:57,861 --> 00:45:01,532
For now, we've administered some fluids
and prescribed her some medicine.

564
00:45:01,615 --> 00:45:03,867
She'll be better once she's done.

565
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:06,995
Does she not have to be hospitalized?

566
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:08,580
She can go home.

567
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:11,208
She needs to eat and rest well.

568
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,378
Most of all, she shouldn't get stressed.

569
00:45:14,461 --> 00:45:16,380
So do your best to please her.

570
00:45:16,463 --> 00:45:18,507
Please relay this message
to your sister too.

571
00:45:19,508 --> 00:45:21,051
Okay. Thank you.

572
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:30,936
She's dehydrated.
She just needs some rest.

573
00:45:31,019 --> 00:45:34,148
-What can we do?
-We need to treat her well.

574
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:35,107
You should.

575
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:40,028
-Don't point fingers.
-You could do better.

576
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:41,071
What did I do?

577
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:44,074
-I didn't want to upset her.
-We're at a hospital.

578
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:45,492
Be quiet.

579
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:51,915
-Be quiet.
-Mom's smiling.

580
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:05,804
MOTEL

581
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:18,525
This is ten million won.

582
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:21,069
This is my entire savings.

583
00:46:21,653 --> 00:46:23,071
This is really the last time.

584
00:46:26,158 --> 00:46:27,784
I knew it.

585
00:46:28,494 --> 00:46:32,206
Your girlfriend has more power
over you than I do.

586
00:46:32,998 --> 00:46:34,208
Right?

587
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:37,377
Director Jin is your girlfriend, right?

588
00:46:39,004 --> 00:46:41,215
She looked a bit old,

589
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:43,091
but she was pretty.

590
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:45,677
She looked graceful and classy.

591
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:50,390
By the way,
how high of a rank is a director?

592
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:52,267
Her salary must be high.

593
00:46:52,351 --> 00:46:53,894
You little punk.

594
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:56,605
You take after me. You're good with women.

595
00:46:56,688 --> 00:46:58,440
Right? You punk.

596
00:46:59,107 --> 00:47:02,319
Don't tell me you met Director Jin.

597
00:47:06,615 --> 00:47:08,575
Aren't you here because she talked to you?

598
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:12,788
Do you have any money?

599
00:47:12,871 --> 00:47:16,750
You see, I'm in dire need of money.

600
00:47:16,833 --> 00:47:18,877
Do you think you could lend me some?

601
00:47:20,837 --> 00:47:25,050
I love everything about my son

602
00:47:25,133 --> 00:47:27,761
but he's not exactly loaded.

603
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:32,099
But seeing how
he's working at Headquarters,

604
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:34,518
he must be competent.

605
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:41,191
You should make an investment

606
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:43,318
if you want to date a young guy.

607
00:47:44,069 --> 00:47:45,946
Ten million won would be enough.

608
00:47:52,077 --> 00:47:53,829
You're crazy.

609
00:47:53,912 --> 00:47:55,998
Everything's fine.

610
00:47:56,498 --> 00:47:58,875
Hey. From the way I see it,

611
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:01,295
she's head over heels for you.

612
00:48:01,378 --> 00:48:04,631
She looks more stable
and considerate compared

613
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:06,425
to that reporter chick you dated.

614
00:48:06,508 --> 00:48:08,010
But most of all,

615
00:48:08,093 --> 00:48:09,970
her looks are totally my type.

616
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:13,557
Anyway, thanks. Use this for a cab.

617
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:14,766
What the…

618
00:48:16,977 --> 00:48:19,563
You bastard. How dare you grab
your father by the collar?

619
00:48:19,646 --> 00:48:20,731
Let go!

620
00:48:20,814 --> 00:48:22,399
Why are you doing this to me?

621
00:48:22,482 --> 00:48:25,027
-What did I do?
-Can you please…

622
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:27,821
let me live?

623
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:30,407
I beg you.

624
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:33,827
Please stop muscling in on my life.

625
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:35,829
Please.

626
00:48:46,715 --> 00:48:49,343
That punk.

627
00:49:01,146 --> 00:49:03,732
DIRECTOR JIN HA-KYUNG

628
00:49:11,823 --> 00:49:13,116
Come here, Mom.

629
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:16,495
Goodness.

630
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:23,085
Eat before you go.

631
00:49:23,168 --> 00:49:24,503
Just rest.

632
00:49:24,586 --> 00:49:26,588
I made some young radish kimchi.

633
00:49:26,672 --> 00:49:30,050
I told Tae-kyung
to give you some side dishes.

634
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:31,510
Did you get to try them?

635
00:49:34,388 --> 00:49:35,639
What?

636
00:49:35,722 --> 00:49:36,973
The guy upstairs didn't give them?

637
00:49:37,557 --> 00:49:38,600
Guy upstairs?

638
00:49:38,684 --> 00:49:41,520
I mean, you changed your passcode
and didn't pick up either.

639
00:49:41,603 --> 00:49:43,480
You should have left it with the guard.

640
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:45,107
I…

641
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:48,360
I didn't want them to go bad.
There was bulgogi too.

642
00:49:48,443 --> 00:49:50,821
Enough. Be quiet.

643
00:49:50,904 --> 00:49:53,907
Go get me a glass of water. Goodness.

644
00:50:01,206 --> 00:50:02,624
What a strange guy.

645
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:05,001
Why hasn't he given them to her yet?

646
00:50:06,545 --> 00:50:07,713
He seemed to be living alone.

647
00:50:08,463 --> 00:50:09,506
Hold on.

648
00:50:09,589 --> 00:50:11,299
Did he eat them all?

649
00:50:16,012 --> 00:50:18,807
DOES IT SMELL?
NATURAL MINERAL PRESERVATIVE

650
00:50:35,323 --> 00:50:37,576
CALLING
APARTMENT 1201

651
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:42,372
Why the hell are they always out?

652
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:46,543
Shouldn't they pick up their side dishes?

653
00:50:47,294 --> 00:50:50,130
What am I supposed to do? It's been days.

654
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:54,009
The entire house reeks of food.

655
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:00,599
Damn it.

656
00:51:08,148 --> 00:51:09,941
Tae-kyung, give Mom some water.

657
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:50,065
Where's Ki-jun?

658
00:51:50,732 --> 00:51:52,818
I'm not sure.
I haven't seen him for a while.

659
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:57,239
Darn it. He should be busy right now.

660
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:04,996
What should I do?

661
00:52:05,997 --> 00:52:07,249
What should I do?

662
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:09,793
What will happen?

663
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:11,962
What should I do?

664
00:52:16,383 --> 00:52:18,760
Ha-kyung, it's me.

665
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:22,013
I'm sorry, but can you help me this once?

666
00:52:22,848 --> 00:52:24,808
Damn it! Are you crazy?

667
00:52:24,891 --> 00:52:26,810
Don't text her! Don't do it.

668
00:52:26,893 --> 00:52:29,688
Don't do it. You shouldn't.

669
00:52:29,771 --> 00:52:32,357
Then what should I do?

670
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:33,900
What should I do?

671
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:35,777
What do you think? You should call her.

672
00:52:36,361 --> 00:52:37,445
Damn it.

673
00:52:42,742 --> 00:52:44,494
Ha-kyung, it's me.

674
00:52:44,578 --> 00:52:47,664
It must have been tiring
to be on night duty.

675
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:51,334
Actually, I called because…

676
00:52:55,881 --> 00:52:57,632
Save me this once.

677
00:52:58,884 --> 00:53:00,468
I'm truly sorry,

678
00:53:01,052 --> 00:53:05,807
but could you help me just this once?

679
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:37,923
How is your mother?

680
00:53:39,132 --> 00:53:40,675
She's better.

681
00:53:41,676 --> 00:53:42,802
That's a relief.

682
00:53:50,852 --> 00:53:52,062
I'm sorry.

683
00:53:52,145 --> 00:53:53,521
What for?

684
00:53:56,149 --> 00:53:57,901
My father…

685
00:54:01,196 --> 00:54:02,739
I feel terrible.

686
00:54:07,285 --> 00:54:09,371
I can't even apologize properly.

687
00:54:10,288 --> 00:54:11,581
Did you eat?

688
00:54:19,881 --> 00:54:20,840
Have some.

689
00:54:21,883 --> 00:54:23,969
My mom made it herself.

690
00:54:25,261 --> 00:54:28,139
She always makes this
around this time of the year.

691
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:30,350
Why?

692
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:33,853
It was my father's favorite food,

693
00:54:34,354 --> 00:54:36,481
and tomorrow is his death anniversary.

694
00:54:52,998 --> 00:54:55,375
I think Ha-kyung
takes after you in cooking.

695
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:57,919
She did well despite
all that complaining, right?

696
00:54:59,004 --> 00:55:00,380
Is she coming tomorrow?

697
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:02,674
What do you think?

698
00:55:03,508 --> 00:55:04,926
Don't hold your breath.

699
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:06,803
I know you understand her too.

700
00:55:12,684 --> 00:55:13,977
She did a good job.

701
00:55:17,564 --> 00:55:21,359
The day my father died
is one of the memories

702
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:24,738
I would love to forget.

703
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:27,198
SEIZED

704
00:55:28,533 --> 00:55:30,118
I'm home.

705
00:55:38,126 --> 00:55:39,252
Mom.

706
00:55:51,765 --> 00:55:53,266
Are you not home?

707
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:29,761
After his business went under,

708
00:56:31,012 --> 00:56:33,890
he abandoned us and fled.

709
00:56:43,358 --> 00:56:46,111
That's the kind of father I had.

710
00:56:47,112 --> 00:56:48,696
So don't be

711
00:56:49,572 --> 00:56:51,950
in too much pain because of yours.

712
00:56:53,827 --> 00:56:57,497
"Just as a loud noise is created
when a cloud meets another cloud,

713
00:56:58,248 --> 00:57:01,876
I wish I could be bold enough
to shout unconsciously

714
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:05,088
in this relationship I have with you."

715
00:57:23,356 --> 00:57:24,774
It's tasty.

716
00:57:28,069 --> 00:57:30,655
"Just as a bright light appears

717
00:57:30,738 --> 00:57:32,657
when a cloud suddenly meets another cloud,

718
00:57:33,324 --> 00:57:35,076
I wish being with you

719
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:38,788
could shed light on the path
I have wandered away from."

720
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:41,958
Can you promise me something?

721
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:48,798
What is it?

722
00:57:49,924 --> 00:57:52,010
If you happen to not love me anymore,

723
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:54,804
let me be the first to know.

724
00:57:55,388 --> 00:57:56,681
If you become swayed,

725
00:57:56,764 --> 00:57:58,850
I want to be the first one to know.

726
00:58:02,061 --> 00:58:05,607
Of course, my heart
will break once you tell me.

727
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:07,650
But what's even more painful…

728
00:58:09,194 --> 00:58:11,237
is if I'm kept in the dark.

729
00:58:14,365 --> 00:58:15,617
Not like my father.

730
00:58:24,667 --> 00:58:26,252
Not like Han Ki-jun.

731
00:58:32,091 --> 00:58:34,677
Promise me you won't be like them.

732
00:58:37,388 --> 00:58:40,850
"You shine brightly when you tell me
that rain needs to meet another rain

733
00:58:42,227 --> 00:58:43,978
for them

734
00:58:45,104 --> 00:58:46,731
to get drenched."

735
00:58:46,814 --> 00:58:48,358
I promise.

736
00:58:50,777 --> 00:58:51,945
Okay, then.

737
00:58:58,493 --> 00:58:59,911
Let's live together.

738
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:06,000
THEMED STORY FOR JULY

739
00:59:06,084 --> 00:59:06,918
I'm finished.

740
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:09,254
Let's see.

741
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:12,674
Assistant Director Kim's piece wasn't bad.

742
00:59:12,757 --> 00:59:14,259
You can consider his

743
00:59:14,342 --> 00:59:15,635
as well as mine.

744
00:59:15,718 --> 00:59:17,178
Let me know once you decide.

745
00:59:17,762 --> 00:59:18,721
Okay.

746
00:59:18,805 --> 00:59:19,806
Thank you.

747
00:59:25,103 --> 00:59:26,271
Good work.

748
00:59:26,354 --> 00:59:29,065
Please. I should say that to you instead.

749
00:59:30,316 --> 00:59:32,860
When he becomes anxious,

750
00:59:32,944 --> 00:59:34,988
he tends to bother everyone.

751
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:36,155
Sorry?

752
00:59:36,698 --> 00:59:38,741
I see. It was a good experience for me.

753
00:59:38,825 --> 00:59:41,661
That's it. Experience.
That's what's important.

754
00:59:41,744 --> 00:59:43,496
I love that attitude of yours.

755
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:47,083
Look at this.
The mighty Han Ki-jun is back.

756
00:59:47,166 --> 00:59:48,793
Let's get this printed right away.

757
00:59:48,876 --> 00:59:51,629
Yes, sir.
I'll send it to them this instant.

758
00:59:53,006 --> 00:59:55,091
I knew you could do it.

759
01:00:08,938 --> 01:00:11,107
WILL YOU BE LATE?
I THINK SO. YOU CAN GO TO BED FIRST.

760
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:13,026
Can I see you for a minute?

761
01:00:20,867 --> 01:00:22,994
What's up? Aren't you busy at this hour?

762
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:25,121
Would you like a beverage?

763
01:00:26,748 --> 01:00:29,417
Right. Did you register
our marriage yesterday?

764
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:31,628
We should hurry if we want to get a loan.

765
01:00:31,711 --> 01:00:33,463
Our housing contract will end soon.

766
01:00:34,172 --> 01:00:37,175
Actually, that's why I wanted to talk.

767
01:00:37,842 --> 01:00:38,926
Okay. What is it?

768
01:00:40,762 --> 01:00:42,430
Can we push back

769
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:45,391
registering our marriage?

770
01:00:47,852 --> 01:00:48,936
What?

771
01:00:52,857 --> 01:00:56,027
You want to live together with me?

772
01:00:56,611 --> 01:00:59,489
Yes. I want to be with you.

773
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:03,451
Move in with me.

774
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:10,041
What do you mean?

775
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:11,793
Hold on.

776
01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:14,087
What does this mean?

777
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:15,963
You want to push it back?

778
01:01:17,006 --> 01:01:19,509
Why? What's your reason?

779
01:01:21,594 --> 01:01:23,930
I just want to.

780
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:09,350
Today's atmospheric ozone concentration
is expected to be over 0.3ppm per hour.

781
01:02:09,434 --> 01:02:12,437
The weather is perfectly fine.
What's with the ozone warning?

782
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:14,981
Who handled the complaint calls
that came to the Chief Team today?

783
01:02:15,064 --> 01:02:16,691
I didn't struggle to pass

784
01:02:16,774 --> 01:02:19,360
the civil service exam
to handle trivial calls like that.

785
01:02:19,944 --> 01:02:22,613
We are here to do that kind of work.

786
01:02:23,656 --> 01:02:24,699
Do it if you want to.

787
01:02:24,782 --> 01:02:26,159
-What?
-Divorce.

788
01:02:26,242 --> 01:02:29,328
Haven't you heard that they're living
in the night-duty room?

789
01:02:29,412 --> 01:02:31,289
Did you just say two of them?

790
01:02:32,373 --> 01:02:33,207
Lee Si-woo--

791
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:37,170
She lived with someone from the KMA?

792
01:02:38,546 --> 01:02:42,550
I think your husband found out
that you and I lived together.

793
01:02:43,301 --> 01:02:48,222
