1
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:11,488
Asshole.

2
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:13,823
I'm sorry.

3
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:21,581
Let's call off our marriage.

4
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:36,971
Okay.

5
00:01:38,097 --> 00:01:39,182
"Okay"?

6
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:43,895
Did you just say, "Okay"?

7
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,066
There's nothing else I can say to you.

8
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:50,568
"Okay"?

9
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:53,196
"Okay"?

10
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:55,907
"Okay"?

11
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:57,700
Hey.

12
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:00,537
"Okay"?

13
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:02,747
"Okay"?

14
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:05,959
How could you do this to me?

15
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:31,109
I'm sorry, Ha-kyung.

16
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:34,362
I'm an asshole.

17
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:05,059
I checked the price and it went up a lot.

18
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:08,021
I think it's at least doubled.

19
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:12,817
As you already know, I have no money.

20
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:15,445
I poured my entire savings
into that apartment.

21
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:21,367
I don't care.

22
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:24,579
I know that. My wife said it was okay,

23
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:26,456
but that was before we got married.

24
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:28,750
I'm 36 and not getting any younger.

25
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:30,543
I should at least have some money, right?

26
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,381
But if that's difficult for you,

27
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:37,342
let's split it. Half and half.

28
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:39,969
You wish. You're being ridiculous.

29
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,597
You know I'll be staying
at Headquarters, right?

30
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:44,182
So what?

31
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:47,101
I really don't want us to be
on bad terms because of this.

32
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:48,394
I'm serious.

33
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:50,355
Would you want that? We're colleagues.

34
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:52,232
Don't you agree?

35
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:01,324
Give it some thought and let me know.

36
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,578
Hey, honey.

37
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:09,791
No, I'm out buying
your favorite snack, macarons.

38
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:12,585
I should hurry home too.

39
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:19,300
Make sure to dress warmly this morning.

40
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:22,303
The temperature in Gangwon Province
has reached sub-zero levels.

41
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:25,765
And the temperature in
the central region is also below average.

42
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:28,559
The morning temperature
will be similar to yesterday.

43
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:31,104
But due to cold wind from the East Sea,

44
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:33,314
sensible temperature may plummet…

45
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,243
Sensible temperature is
most affected by the wind.

46
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:50,581
The temperature that people feel differs
depending on the direction of the wind

47
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,793
even if they're in the same space.

48
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:56,170
Can you turn off the heater, please?

49
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:59,799
Oh, you must be hot because of the heat.

50
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:10,810
Can you turn on the heater, please?
It's cold here.

51
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:12,687
Sorry?

52
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:16,482
Okay.

53
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:22,613
Wind.

54
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:25,116
The wind is always the problem.

55
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,243
I said it's hot.

56
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:31,622
Okay.

57
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,421
I said it's cold.

58
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:39,630
Damn it.

59
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:45,178
Look. Excuse me,

60
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:49,182
but could you please come to an agreement?

61
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:16,417
EPISODE 2
SENSIBLE TEMPERATURE

62
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:26,928
She said your ancestors helped you.

63
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,306
Mom, did you visit that shaman again?

64
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:31,891
What else did she say?

65
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:35,728
She said one day, you'll thank him greatly

66
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:38,856
and say, "Thank you for leaving me."

67
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,358
That's probably how you feel.

68
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:43,319
You never liked him,

69
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:46,155
so you're ecstatic
that he left on his own.

70
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,073
Am I wrong?

71
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:49,367
Ha-kyung, she's just upset.

72
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,661
I can't completely deny that.

73
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:57,917
Your dad was always chasing rainbows,
and I hated him for that.

74
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,502
But he always kept his promises.

75
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:02,839
-Mom.
-I knew something felt off

76
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,882
the moment I first met him.

77
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:07,927
How could anyone in their right mind
break off an engagement

78
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,554
a month before the wedding?

79
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:11,722
And he's so cheap.

80
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:14,600
I know splitting costs is
a trend these days,

81
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:17,270
but I never heard
of any bride who pitched in

82
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:18,855
for her own wedding gifts.

83
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:20,398
Did you see my credit card bill?

84
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:22,316
I didn't have to.

85
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,445
We used my card but he paid me back.

86
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:26,612
Don't make me laugh.

87
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:28,281
Come on.

88
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:33,161
Enough with the pity party.

89
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:36,080
Make sure you clarify
who owns the apartment.

90
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:37,957
There's no need for that. It's mine.

91
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:41,377
Make sure you clarify that on paper too,
or he'll pull one over on you.

92
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,504
Fine. I'll take care of it.

93
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:46,966
I said I'll handle it on my own.

94
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:49,760
He gave that house to her
when they separated

95
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:51,137
as alimony.

96
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,764
How can we trust him
when he even called off the wedding?

97
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,648
JIN HA-KYUNG
KOREA METEOROLOGICAL ADMINISTRATION

00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:58,579
SENSIBLE TEMPERATURE 2°C

100
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,005
What did you say your name was?

101
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:09,382
Lee Si-woo.

102
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:14,595
We're not allowed to let you in
if you don't have your security pass.

103
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,472
I am an employee here.

104
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:19,934
I left both my ID card
and employee card at home.

105
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,646
Who do you think you are?

106
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:28,359
Si as in time and Woo as in rain.
Rain that falls at the right time.

107
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:29,819
I'm Lee Si-woo.

108
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:37,577
What's your employee number?

109
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:40,037
It's 1835081.

110
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:41,664
Zero, eight, one…

111
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:48,546
This doesn't look like you.

112
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:50,172
It's…

113
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:54,927
That is me. I was chubby
while preparing for the state exam.

114
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:56,846
But…

115
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:59,974
-you look very different.
-It is me.

116
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:03,561
I lost some fat here and here. It's me.

117
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:06,772
He is an employee.

118
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:10,318
-Oh, do you know him?
-He's from the Metropolitan Office.

119
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,194
I see.

120
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:15,865
All right. You may enter.

121
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:19,160
You should stop by HR
and issue a new pass.

122
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:21,370
I will. Goodbye.

123
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:25,708
Hello.

124
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,294
You saved me back there.

125
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:31,005
-Thank you.
-You can go about your day and leave.

126
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:47,480
-What is it?
-I'm going about my day.

127
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,483
I've been dispatched here

128
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:52,276
as a Severe Weather Forecaster
for Chief Team Two.

129
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,070
What did you say?

130
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:56,614
I'll be working here
for the next two weeks.

131
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,753
-Has it been seven years already?
-Yes.

132
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:11,837
-Sir.
-Yes?

133
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:13,631
I… What?

134
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:17,009
-Hello.
-I'm glad you're here.

135
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,761
Say hello.

136
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:21,222
You probably heard of Um from Gangneung.

137
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:24,266
He's the new Senior Forecaster
of Chief Team Two.

138
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:26,811
Our team?

139
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:29,188
-Dong-han.
-Yes?

140
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:32,108
-We look forward to working with you.
-Gosh. Likewise, sir.

141
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:34,985
I look forward
to working with you, Director Jin.

142
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:41,283
We need to talk.

143
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,413
Sure.

144
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:49,458
You told me to think about it.
This is unfair.

145
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:52,211
You can think about it.

146
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:56,382
But I should also have
an alternative plan.

147
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:59,051
Soon, we'll have to prepare
for summer disaster prevention.

148
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:00,886
If we don't have a director by then,

149
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,930
I can't just appoint anyone.

150
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,349
I need an alternative.

151
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:10,229
I know you'll accept the offer
to go to Switzerland anyway.

152
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:11,230
Isn't that why you're here?

153
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:13,732
I'm here because of
that new forecaster on our team.

154
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:15,359
Oh, Lee Si-woo?

155
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,362
He's just impossible.

156
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:22,116
He's reckless and has no respect
for the system--

157
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:24,785
-I know. He's a bit immature.
-Exactly.

158
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:27,163
But he has good intuition.
He has intuitive power.

159
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:28,831
People like him are practical.

160
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,792
No, sir. I beg to differ.

161
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:33,627
Please withdraw his dispatch.

162
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:39,633
What's it to you who joins the team
if you're going to leave anyway?

163
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:41,427
I never said I was leaving.

164
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:44,263
Then will you stay?

165
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:48,851
You know I'll be staying
at Headquarters, right?

166
00:12:49,768 --> 00:12:51,604
I'm not sure yet.

167
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:55,399
Fine.

168
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:57,401
You have one week.

169
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:01,614
You know many people have lined up
to join WMO's program, right?

170
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:03,824
I need to reply to
the International Cooperation Division.

171
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:05,826
One week.

172
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:07,870
Understood.

173
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:09,747
Okay.

174
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:16,921
-You were dispatched here?
-Yes.

175
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:18,797
-For how long?
-Two weeks.

176
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:20,883
-Hey.
-What?

177
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,552
-Sir.
-Goodness.

178
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:26,263
What are you doing here?

179
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:27,473
I was dispatched here.

180
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:31,143
Then what about you?
You should be at the Gangwon Office.

181
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:33,354
I was appointed here.

182
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:34,855
-Goodness.
-Really?

183
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:36,565
Have you finally become a director?

184
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,526
I'm so happy for you.

185
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:40,986
-It was long overdue.
-Congratulations.

186
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,364
No, it's not what you think.

187
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:44,865
Which team?

188
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,410
Team Two.

189
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:49,537
-What?
-Team Two.

190
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:52,289
Two?

191
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:55,167
Is this the Senior Forecaster's desk?

192
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:57,711
Wait. Hold on.

193
00:13:57,795 --> 00:14:00,839
Are you here as the Senior Forecaster
of Chief Team Two?

194
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:02,341
Yes. That's right.

195
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:05,511
So you'll be working
under Director Jin Ha-kyung?

196
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:06,595
Yes.

197
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:08,764
Under her.

198
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:16,188
NEWS
TRENDING SEARCHES

199
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:36,876
-You've lost so much weight.
-Really?

200
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,127
You've lost a ton.

201
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:42,131
So how's your marriage life?

202
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:43,966
Does Deputy Director Han treat you well?

203
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,551
He may seem cold on the outside,

204
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:47,428
but he's really caring.

205
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:51,223
He cleans and does everything
around the house.

206
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:55,227
Gosh. I didn't think he'd be like that.

207
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:58,147
You're head over heels for him.

208
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,523
Gosh, lucky you.

209
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:00,649
You're so lucky.

210
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:23,464
I feel so left out as a single woman.

211
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:25,799
-I'll get married first.
-Sure.

212
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:27,134
-Catch my bouquet.
-I will.

213
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:28,969
Okay. Yu-jin became so much prettier.

214
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:30,721
I'll get married first.

215
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,182
Sure, you can go first.

216
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,517
So getting married makes you prettier?

217
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:38,729
Why did I avoid her?

218
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:41,190
Why? What for?

219
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:45,277
This is exactly why
you should never date a colleague.

220
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:49,281
If you don't get married and break up,
you'll only become a laughing stock.

221
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:51,575
She's in Chief Team Two,
and he's a spokesperson.

222
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:54,036
They're bound to meet each other
at least once a day.

223
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,746
Just the thought of it is terrible.

224
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,085
Don't you think so?

225
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:26,193
The Siberian air mass
has nothing to do with this.

226
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:28,654
Still, the Okhotsk Sea air mass
is not strong enough

227
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:31,031
to affect the west.

228
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:32,700
It's the Okhotsk Sea air mass.

229
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:34,660
The wind is blowing from that direction.

230
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:37,121
It's possible if it's blowing
from the northwest.

231
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:39,957
But the sea alone
can't drop the temperature this low.

232
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,626
-Look at this.
-What are they talking about?

233
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,045
About why the temperature
is continuously dropping.

234
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:48,841
Senior Forecaster Um thinks
it's due to the Siberian air mass,

235
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:51,802
and Forecaster Lee thinks
it's because of the Okhotsk Sea air mass.

236
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:54,304
There's nothing we can do.

237
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:56,849
They're talking
about two opposite air masses.

238
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,143
It's the Siberian air mass.

239
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:01,645
The Okhotsk Sea air mass
is more plausible.

240
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:05,274
You might as well drag
the North Pacific air mass into this.

241
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:06,650
What? Are you kidding me?

242
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:08,777
That's absurd.
That's a summertime air mass.

243
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:11,071
It's just as absurd that the temperature

244
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:12,614
has dropped to 5°C in May.

245
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,783
Still, what you said was just ridiculous.

246
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,870
What I mean is,
we should consider all variables.

247
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:19,246
Understood?

248
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:20,998
Understood?

249
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:40,184
Isn't the atmosphere in here terrifying?

250
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:42,811
The Siberian air mass,
the Okhotsk Sea air mass,

251
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,730
as well as the North Pacific air mass…

252
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,691
This is the worst weather anomaly.

253
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:49,985
In a way, this is the end.

254
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:52,321
Are we getting disbanded?

255
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:53,864
I'm not sure.

256
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,910
But I think
Director Jin will get replaced soon.

257
00:17:57,993 --> 00:17:59,203
-No way.
-Really?

258
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:01,038
Or else,

259
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:04,792
why would they appoint
Senior Forecaster Um to our team?

260
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:08,420
I heard Director Jin
was going to Switzerland.

261
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:12,091
-I guess it's true.
-Really? Why all of a sudden?

262
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:14,968
Deputy Director Han's transfer
was canceled.

263
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:16,136
Really?

264
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:18,889
So he'll be staying here?

265
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,392
Gosh. I bet she feels uneasy about that.
Don't you think so?

266
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:23,602
Of course.

267
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:28,482
That's why she's going to leave instead.

268
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:30,776
Why is it always the woman who leaves?

269
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:32,861
They both work here and he cheated on her.

270
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:36,198
The world doesn't care
about who's right or wrong.

271
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:39,409
It's all about who's more brazen.

272
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:44,248
I don't think it's bad
to just leave it all behind.

273
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:49,461
Is Director Jin going somewhere?

274
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:54,258
You don't need to know.

275
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:57,845
Just do your job
for the next two weeks and leave.

276
00:18:57,928 --> 00:18:58,887
But…

277
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:04,935
Hello, this is Oh Myung-ju
of Chief Team Two speaking.

278
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:06,145
Okay.

279
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:42,764
It's freezing over here.

280
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:45,017
GANGWON REGIONAL OFFICE
OF METEOROLOGY

281
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,728
Didn't you say the temperature
would rise in the evening?

282
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:48,937
Yes, sir.

283
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:51,648
Then what's going on? What's the reason?

284
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:53,609
Judging by the wind's direction alone,

285
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:56,236
we could say
the Okhotsk Sea air mass impacted this.

286
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,906
But we've yet to find out
why the temperature dropped.

287
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:00,908
Really? And the latest
average in sunlight?

288
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:03,827
It's 73, similar to the average.

289
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:05,746
Then that's not it either.

290
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,915
-Senior Forecaster Um.
-Yes?

291
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:11,084
-What's your take on this?
-Maybe the cold air in the northwest

292
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:14,213
temporarily became stronger.

293
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:18,050
Like May of 1978?

294
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:22,721
The phenomenon is similar
to April of 2010 too.

295
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:26,266
At that time, it was also due
to the cold air from the northwest.

296
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:28,018
By the way,

297
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:30,896
what's that over Okhotsk?

298
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,439
We're analyzing it.

299
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:36,360
Gosh, we're always analyzing.

300
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,073
What do you think?

301
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:43,408
Feel free to tell me your opinion.

302
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:45,535
I think it's sea fog

303
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:48,372
caused by the temperature difference
on the sea surface.

304
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:50,415
Sea fogs are often spotted in that area.

305
00:20:57,005 --> 00:20:58,340
Any other opinions?

306
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:05,681
All right. We'll tell the press
that it's only temporary.

307
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:09,101
How about you go down
and explain the situation?

308
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:10,227
It's an odd phenomenon.

309
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,650
What's wrong? Are you uncomfortable?

310
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:22,281
-No, sir. It's okay.
-All right.

311
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:24,241
I'll go tell them.

312
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:29,496
-I'll see you guys later.
-Yes, sir.

313
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:32,332
-Good work.
-Good work.

314
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:37,379
-Good work.
-Good work.

315
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:50,392
SIMULTANEOUSLY OCCURRING
COLD AND HOT TEMPERATURES IN MAY

316
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:57,566
We believe this odd phenomenon
isn't a simple case

317
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:59,192
of capricious weather,

318
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:02,195
but a result of climate change worldwide.

319
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:04,823
To handle this climate crisis,
we will strengthen

320
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:06,867
the relationship between the departments

321
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:09,911
and do our best to protect everyone
from meteorological disasters.

322
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:12,122
He's good at responding to the press.

323
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:14,333
So the Administrator
wants to keep him around

324
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:16,626
because he thinks highly of that.

325
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:18,587
He's all talk.

326
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:19,963
Any questions?

327
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:22,966
I'm Chae Yu-jin from Munmin Daily.

328
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:31,433
How long will this cold spell last?

329
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:34,227
The Chief Forecaster
can answer that question.

330
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:43,779
For now, we believe this is temporary.

331
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:46,573
We believe it'll be cold
for another one or two days.

332
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:48,533
Will it get warmer in two days?

333
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:51,620
We hope so. That's what we predict.

334
00:22:53,371 --> 00:22:56,750
I hope your prediction
will come true this time around.

335
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:59,461
It's too soon
to pull out our winter clothes.

336
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:09,763
If you have no more questions,
I will end the briefing.

337
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:10,889
Thank you.

338
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:16,978
Yu-jin!

339
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:19,022
Wait outside for a minute.

340
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:23,068
Please look into that.

341
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,280
Congratulations, Director Jin.

342
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:34,412
I heard you were promoted.

343
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:36,540
Aren't you the youngest person

344
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:38,375
to become a director?

345
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:40,127
Good work, Deputy Director Han.

346
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:42,712
Have you thought about what to do?

347
00:23:43,338 --> 00:23:45,799
What? What do I need to think about?

348
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:48,218
Come on, Ha-kyung.

349
00:23:48,301 --> 00:23:50,887
It's not your loss
even if we split the money.

350
00:23:52,013 --> 00:23:53,223
Split the money?

351
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:54,850
You sure love to split.

352
00:23:57,686 --> 00:23:59,396
I wasn't going to say this.

353
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:03,066
But if you're so precise,
why did you take the TV?

354
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:06,862
I told you.
I thought I could take whatever I needed.

355
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:10,532
And come to think of it,
didn't I buy the TV?

356
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:12,534
Don't you remember asking me to pay half?

357
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:13,535
Did I?

358
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:17,539
Right.

359
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:21,168
Did we use your card
because I maxed out mine?

360
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:23,503
Exactly. I wired you 1,240,000 won.

361
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:26,798
We paid in cash, so they installed it
for free and gave us a gift.

362
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:31,178
Right… I remember now.

363
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:32,846
Return the TV, induction stove,

364
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:34,264
and workout equipment.

365
00:24:34,347 --> 00:24:36,766
If you don't,
I won't even consider halving it.

366
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,560
Jin Ha-kyung, are you serious?

367
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:40,353
Address me formally and lower your voice.

368
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:43,231
-This is our workplace.
-Hey.

369
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:45,192
I told you before.

370
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:47,944
I don't want to argue
with you at work either.

371
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:50,071
But if you act like this,
I have no choice.

372
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:51,573
So what? Do you want to fight?

373
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:52,741
-Do you?
-Do you?

374
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:54,284
-No, thanks.
-Me neither.

375
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:55,619
Director Jin,

376
00:24:55,702 --> 00:24:57,454
the Director General is looking for you.

377
00:24:59,414 --> 00:25:01,208
I called you but your phone was off.

378
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:02,626
Oh…

379
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:06,463
-Let's go.
-Goodbye.

380
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:25,649
Wait.

381
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:33,365
Haven't we met before?

382
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:35,784
-You and me?
-At my wedding.

383
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:37,994
It was you, right?

384
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,497
-The bouquet.
-No.

385
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:44,626
You got the wrong person.

386
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:53,385
What's wrong?

387
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:57,264
Isn't he that psycho from our wedding?

388
00:25:57,347 --> 00:26:00,475
No. I think you're mistaken.

389
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:03,270
Are you sure?

390
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:05,605
It was definitely not him.

391
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,191
I should get going.

392
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:10,527
-See you at home.
-Okay.

393
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,166
Where are you going?

394
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:28,211
I thought the Director General
wanted to see me.

395
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:29,921
I was making up an excuse.

396
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:31,798
You seemed to be in a pickle.

397
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:36,678
-What happened down there--
-Well,

398
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:38,680
I didn't see anything.

399
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:42,058
That's scarier than saying you did.

400
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:45,729
You should get some fresh air.

401
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:47,105
I'll go in first.

402
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:12,380
Can we talk downstairs?

403
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:48,458
-Why are you here?
-It's my workplace.

404
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:52,003
Why aren't you at the Metropolitan Office?

405
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:53,546
I was dispatched here.

406
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:55,965
Must you go this far?

407
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:58,635
Was humiliating me
at my own wedding not enough?

408
00:27:58,718 --> 00:28:00,261
Why did you follow me here?

409
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:03,306
I'm not here to see you.
I was sent here for two weeks.

410
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:04,933
Unbelievable.

411
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:09,646
Is this okay for you?

412
00:28:10,271 --> 00:28:13,066
What if he sees us together?

413
00:28:14,317 --> 00:28:15,402
He doesn't know.

414
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:21,825
He doesn't know
that you and I lived together.

415
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:24,786
And I hope he never will.

416
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:12,083
NATIONAL METEOROLOGICAL CENTER

INNOVATIVE WEATHER SERVICES
A STEPPING STONE TO PUBLIC SAFETY

418
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:24,471
-Hello.
-I'll be leaving now.

419
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:28,016
-Oh, hello.
-Hey.

420
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:29,309
Hello.

421
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:33,980
-It's freezing out.
-Hey.

422
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:36,191
I know.

423
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:41,070
Look at this.
The temperature keeps dropping.

424
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:44,282
I don't think this is temporary.

425
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,911
-Hello.
-Hello.

426
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:49,913
Hello. Gosh, it's freezing.

427
00:29:51,414 --> 00:29:52,415
Hey!

428
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,501
Gosh.

429
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:56,252
Dong-han?

430
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:58,797
-Hey.
-How long has it been?

431
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,466
You saw me on a screen every day.
Don't overreact.

432
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:04,594
You look much better on the monitor.

433
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:08,598
-Good work.
-Thank you.

434
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:10,892
Hey.

435
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:13,436
Look at this.

436
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:47,971
How about we have dinner together?

437
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:50,098
We have two new members now

438
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:51,558
and you guys should chat too.

439
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:56,187
I need to check into the place
I'm staying at by 8 p.m.

440
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:57,814
Maybe next time.

441
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,819
I need to go home too.

442
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:03,945
-See you tomorrow.
-Bye.

443
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:04,904
Goodbye.

444
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:09,117
See? I told you they'd decline.

445
00:31:10,451 --> 00:31:12,453
Teamwork is crucial for our team.

446
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:14,998
But the director and forecasters…

447
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:17,041
They're all quite feisty.

448
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:30,013
They'll sort themselves out.

449
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:33,016
Then let's focus on our teamwork.

450
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:34,767
-Shall we?
-Okay.

451
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:40,565
-Isn't it tasty?
-Yes, it is.

452
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:46,112
Who's that?

453
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:48,573
I'm not expecting anyone right now.

454
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:54,746
-Who is it?
-It's me. Open up.

455
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:58,583
It's freezing.

456
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:01,336
How's it freezing in May?

457
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:03,922
Why are you here all of a sudden?

458
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:05,131
I texted you.

459
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:07,926
I said I'd go to Headquarters
and come home right away.

460
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:10,845
-You texted me?
-Come on.

461
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:12,347
Hello.

462
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:14,349
Hey. You've grown so…

463
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:20,605
Were you having dinner?

464
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:23,107
What should I do? We have no rice left.

465
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:26,235
That's okay. I already had dinner.

466
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:28,738
Eat up.

467
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:47,382
You were assigned to Headquarters?

468
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:50,051
Yes. I sent my belongings by parcel.

469
00:32:50,551 --> 00:32:52,178
They'll probably arrive tomorrow.

470
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:55,014
How could you just text
about such an important matter?

471
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:57,725
What's wrong? I've always been like that.

472
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:00,228
But… Gosh.

473
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:02,897
You should have told me beforehand.

474
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:04,691
We have no space for your stuff.

475
00:33:05,858 --> 00:33:09,195
There's not much.

476
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:10,989
Only two bags.

477
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:12,740
You're unbelievable.

478
00:33:40,476 --> 00:33:41,686
That's it.

479
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:44,022
-Thank you.
-Goodbye.

480
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:46,899
Thank you.

481
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:47,984
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

482
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:57,201
What's all this?

483
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:03,750
OFFICE OF SPOKESPERSON
HAN KI-JUN

484
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:05,001
Did you get them?

485
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:08,337
I took them
since I thought you wouldn't need them.

486
00:34:08,963 --> 00:34:10,381
Check if they're all there.

487
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:13,718
Why wouldn't I need them?
Are you kidding me?

488
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:26,439
All right.

489
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:41,537
NEIGHBORHOOD MARKET

490
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:43,581
Selling a latest model TV.

491
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:55,718
Selling a rice cooker.

492
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:59,013
Selling a speaker that hasn't been opened.

493
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:02,225
Selling suitcases that haven't been used.

494
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:23,663
Are we doing it right?
Shouldn't we work up?

495
00:35:25,873 --> 00:35:27,291
Are you okay?

496
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:28,584
-Let me see.
-Stop.

497
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:29,961
Stop it.

498
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:32,296
Gosh! What is this?

499
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,591
Hey, if you don't want to do it,
just say so.

500
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:38,261
-I give up.
-You're crumpling it.

501
00:35:38,344 --> 00:35:40,304
This was expensive. Move.

502
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:42,723
What should we do? Gosh.

503
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:44,809
-Let's eat first.
-No.

504
00:35:44,892 --> 00:35:46,519
Let's eat first.

505
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:19,218
YOU RECEIVED A MESSAGE

506
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,768
How much is the TV?

507
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:28,895
It's 800,000 won.

508
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:31,522
No way. How much did you buy it for?

509
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:34,984
It was 2,480,000 won.

510
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:37,028
I used it for less than three months.

511
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:40,615
-Where did you get it?
-Yongsan Electronics Market.

512
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:43,326
-Come on. You're a fraud.
-What is he talking about?

513
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:46,746
Hey, who are you calling a fraud?

514
00:36:47,663 --> 00:36:49,790
That's an overseas shipping serial number.

515
00:36:50,666 --> 00:36:51,500
Overseas?

516
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,960
Overseas shipping?

517
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:12,271
$1,044 = 1,221,480 WON

518
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:13,439
Didn't I buy the TV?

519
00:37:13,522 --> 00:37:15,233
Don't you remember asking me to pay half?

520
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:18,402
-Did I?
-Exactly. I wired you 1,240,000 won.

521
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:20,154
AMOUNT I WIRED = 1,240,000 WON

522
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:22,114
-It's a million--
-You should be smart

523
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:24,033
if you want to scam others.

524
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:27,328
Han Ki-jun, you asshole…

525
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:46,722
INNOVATIVE WEATHER SERVICES
A STEPPING STONE TO PUBLIC SAFETY

526
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:06,784
It's not this one either.

527
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:17,920
You're here early.

528
00:38:19,046 --> 00:38:22,091
-Why are you here at this hour?
-I often come to work at this hour.

529
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:27,680
Gosh, Headquarters sure is different.

530
00:38:27,763 --> 00:38:29,890
The archive here is huge.

531
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:35,938
You can't finish this
before our morning meeting.

532
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:40,484
I'll read these.

533
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:44,447
You don't need to do this.
You're only dispatched here.

534
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:49,243
Actually, it's not the Director General
who asked me to come here.

535
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:50,786
Then?

536
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:53,706
I was curious about how you were doing.

537
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:55,958
What do you mean?

538
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:58,002
After calling off the wedding,

539
00:38:58,085 --> 00:39:01,005
you do know that you guys
were the talk of the town, right?

540
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:03,716
That's when I found out

541
00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:06,594
that Han Ki-jun was the one
who stole my girlfriend

542
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:09,013
and that the woman
who was supposed to marry him

543
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:11,515
was you.

544
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:17,063
This is why
you shouldn't date a colleague.

545
00:39:18,564 --> 00:39:22,318
I bet even dogs around here know
who I dated and what happened between us.

546
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,863
How was it to see them in person?

547
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:28,699
It wasn't that bad.

548
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:31,327
-Who? Ki-jun?
-Me.

549
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:37,958
I thought it'd break my heart.

550
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:39,627
But strangely, I was okay.

551
00:39:40,669 --> 00:39:43,255
Once I accepted the fact
that he was the man she fell for,

552
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:45,049
I felt at ease.

553
00:39:45,132 --> 00:39:47,385
He really is a loser.

554
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:49,804
That's a fact.

555
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:52,515
That enrages me even more.

556
00:39:52,598 --> 00:39:55,059
I was dumped by a loser.

557
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:02,608
Are you going to take up on the offer
and go to Switzerland?

558
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,319
How did you know?

559
00:40:06,028 --> 00:40:08,989
Everyone already knows that you're going.

560
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:13,077
But personally, I hope you don't go.

561
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:18,290
And if it's to avoid them,
then you really shouldn't.

562
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:28,926
I don't think that's any of your concern.

563
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:31,053
Like the wind,

564
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:35,266
an affair is invisible
but it always leaves a trace.

565
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:38,102
No matter how big or small.

566
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:01,459
It's nice and sunny.

567
00:41:09,925 --> 00:41:10,968
What are you doing?

568
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,096
Don't you smell that?

569
00:41:15,681 --> 00:41:17,641
I definitely smell ice.

570
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,228
You smell ice?

571
00:41:22,771 --> 00:41:24,231
During the previous cold wave,

572
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:26,942
the only place that had it
worse than Korea was Siberia.

573
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:29,653
Right. Their ocean was completely frozen.

574
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:30,946
What do you think happened

575
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:33,199
to all that ice?

576
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:40,748
Let's find out.

577
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:54,428
NAMDAEMUN, SEOUL

578
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:57,515
SENSIBLE TEMPERATURE 0°C

579
00:41:58,474 --> 00:42:00,726
The cold air from
the Okhotsk Sea and Sakhalin

580
00:42:00,809 --> 00:42:02,811
are flowing toward the east.

581
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:05,606
After observing it this morning,

582
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:08,067
we found out that the Okhotsk Sea

583
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:10,402
that was frozen last winter
hadn't thawed yet

584
00:42:10,486 --> 00:42:13,155
and thus sent more cold air to the north.

585
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:16,909
What? Are you saying
those were all blocks of ice?

586
00:42:16,992 --> 00:42:18,285
Correct, sir.

587
00:42:28,837 --> 00:42:30,798
It wasn't sea fog.

588
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:32,883
So the ice hadn't thawed yet?

589
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:35,886
Goodness.

590
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:43,143
No wonder.

591
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:45,854
What's the water temperature there?

592
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:48,148
The Kamchatka Peninsula is 5°C to 8°C,

593
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:50,568
and Sakhalin is 3°C to 7°C.

594
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:52,778
This is truly unprecedented.

595
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:54,780
What do you think we should do?

596
00:42:54,863 --> 00:42:57,157
We'll have to record this
as the most unprecedented

597
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:59,910
and lowest temperature
in the weather observation for May.

598
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:02,621
We predict the weather
in Taebaek and Bonghwa

599
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:06,458
to go down as much as
0.5°C and 1.2°C respectively.

600
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:08,544
The most unprecedented and lowest.

601
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:11,088
-Let's do that.
-Yes, sir.

602
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:12,214
Not bad.

603
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:16,260
All right then.
Let's find out how long it'll last.

604
00:43:16,343 --> 00:43:17,344
Yes, sir.

605
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:22,391
Are you having lunch?

606
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:25,227
-What if I am?
-Then I'll tag along.

607
00:43:26,895 --> 00:43:28,022
Mr. Lee.

608
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:30,774
Cafeteria or outside?

609
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:34,528
-How did you do it?
-Sorry?

610
00:43:35,904 --> 00:43:38,449
The smell. You smelled ice.

611
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:40,451
How did you smell the ice

612
00:43:40,534 --> 00:43:41,869
from the Okhotsk Sea?

613
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:43,495
How is that possible?

614
00:43:47,082 --> 00:43:48,709
I'm not a dog.

615
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:50,085
How could I have smelled it?

616
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:52,880
I doubt there's any dog
that can smell that.

617
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:55,549
Then what was that this morning?

618
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:58,761
I found out after seeing some data.

619
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:48,579
You're here early.

620
00:45:49,872 --> 00:45:51,248
Why are you here at this hour?

621
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:53,876
I often come to work at this hour.

622
00:45:58,046 --> 00:45:59,673
You're more naive than I thought.

623
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:02,092
-Hey, Tae-kyung.
-Ha-kyung.

624
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:04,636
-I thought the apartment was yours.
-It is. Why?

625
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:07,222
You received a certification of contents.

626
00:46:07,306 --> 00:46:09,099
What? What did you say?

627
00:46:09,975 --> 00:46:12,060
How could he be so brazen?

628
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:13,604
How dare he demand half!

629
00:46:16,648 --> 00:46:18,650
Mom is seeing red right now.

630
00:46:18,734 --> 00:46:21,862
She wanted to go there this instant
and grab him by the collar.

631
00:46:21,945 --> 00:46:25,657
I told her that you'd be too mortified
to go to work and managed to dissuade her.

632
00:46:27,409 --> 00:46:29,369
Hello?

633
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:32,039
Hey, Ha-kyung. Darn it.

634
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:45,177
Han Ki-jun!

635
00:46:46,512 --> 00:46:47,721
Come out.

636
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:55,896
She's calling for you.

637
00:47:06,615 --> 00:47:08,784
What do you think you're doing?

638
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:13,372
Hey, don't forget where we are.

639
00:47:14,206 --> 00:47:15,624
So you're worried about others?

640
00:47:15,707 --> 00:47:17,668
Then you shouldn't have done it.

641
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:19,002
What did I do?

642
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:20,837
A certification of contents?

643
00:47:21,421 --> 00:47:23,048
How dare you?

644
00:47:23,131 --> 00:47:24,800
Did you forget what you did to me?

645
00:47:24,883 --> 00:47:27,135
That has nothing to do with the apartment.

646
00:47:28,303 --> 00:47:29,972
Are you even sorry for what you did?

647
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:31,932
I already apologized.

648
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:33,433
How many times must I say it?

649
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:34,560
Once.

650
00:47:35,852 --> 00:47:38,188
You apologized just once.

651
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:39,856
In any case, I did apologize.

652
00:47:43,151 --> 00:47:47,030
Hey. We spent ten years together.

653
00:47:47,114 --> 00:47:48,156
Ten years.

654
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,409
And you're the one who ruined everything.

655
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:54,413
Fine. As you said, let's say
you couldn't help falling for her.

656
00:47:54,913 --> 00:47:58,333
But you should have at least
apologized sincerely when we broke up.

657
00:47:59,084 --> 00:48:01,545
You said the apartment
was alimony, not me.

658
00:48:02,337 --> 00:48:05,591
Why? Because you wanted
to hurry and end things. Am I wrong?

659
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:09,094
But still,

660
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:12,973
I thought I was also to blame
for what had happened.

661
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:16,310
I was too busy and irritable
that I was cold toward you.

662
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:19,605
And I was a fool
who didn't notice how lonely you were.

663
00:48:19,688 --> 00:48:21,231
So yes, I thought I played a part.

664
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:23,025
And you dare to come after me like this?

665
00:48:23,108 --> 00:48:24,192
What did you say?

666
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:28,071
You're right.
We were together for ten years.

667
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:31,867
Should I tell you how tough
and exhausting those years were for me?

668
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:34,369
You looked down on me
because you had a higher position.

669
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:35,579
You'd always say,

670
00:48:35,662 --> 00:48:37,914
"Deputy Director Han, some water.
Some coffee, please."

671
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:39,124
"Get me some sweets."

672
00:48:39,207 --> 00:48:41,376
You expected me
to be at your beck and call.

673
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:43,170
And those wallpapers.

674
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:44,921
We could have just hired someone

675
00:48:45,005 --> 00:48:48,425
but you wanted us to do it
and made me work on my day off.

676
00:48:48,508 --> 00:48:50,177
And what happened?

677
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:52,137
They suddenly needed you at work,

678
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:53,805
so I had to do it all by myself…

679
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:55,974
Hey.

680
00:48:56,058 --> 00:48:58,477
Do you know how exhausting that was?

681
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:01,063
Then you should have told me so.

682
00:49:01,146 --> 00:49:02,105
What if I did?

683
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:04,232
You would have sulked over it.

684
00:49:05,567 --> 00:49:08,570
Thinking back on
how I curried favor with you every time

685
00:49:08,654 --> 00:49:10,405
still gives me goosebumps.

686
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:11,948
Do you even know that?

687
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:18,955
Did all those years

688
00:49:19,915 --> 00:49:22,209
mean nothing to us?

689
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:24,419
I don't want to hear it.

690
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:26,963
Tell me how much you'll give me.

691
00:49:27,589 --> 00:49:29,091
Having dated for ten years,

692
00:49:29,174 --> 00:49:32,052
don't you think
it's selfish of you to take it all?

693
00:49:36,181 --> 00:49:37,557
I already sold the apartment.

694
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:41,269
You sold it? When?

695
00:49:41,353 --> 00:49:43,980
I already got the deposit, and the rest
will be paid at the end of the month.

696
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:46,191
Then how much do I get?

697
00:49:46,858 --> 00:49:49,653
Out of the 20 million-won savings,
you deposited 5 million.

698
00:49:49,736 --> 00:49:51,279
I paid the rest.

699
00:49:51,363 --> 00:49:55,033
And I paid the deposit,
intermediate payment, and the loan.

700
00:49:55,701 --> 00:49:58,203
Then what does that mean?

701
00:49:58,286 --> 00:50:01,164
Your share of the house
is only seven percent.

702
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:05,043
After deducting the money you scammed me

703
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:08,672
after purchasing the TV overseas,
I'll wire you the rest.

704
00:50:08,755 --> 00:50:10,257
So Ha-kyung--

705
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:14,803
Let's halve it? Don't be ridiculous.
You can't get any more brazen than that.

706
00:50:15,887 --> 00:50:18,515
But you're going to Switzerland anyway.

707
00:50:18,598 --> 00:50:20,392
That means you don't need that house.

708
00:50:20,475 --> 00:50:22,102
Who said I was going?

709
00:50:22,185 --> 00:50:23,729
Everyone did.

710
00:50:23,812 --> 00:50:25,230
Are you not going?

711
00:50:25,897 --> 00:50:28,358
I just became a director.
I'm not going anywhere.

712
00:50:28,442 --> 00:50:30,694
Are you not uncomfortable
seeing me like this?

713
00:50:30,777 --> 00:50:32,529
Oh, are you?

714
00:50:32,612 --> 00:50:34,364
Then you should leave instead.

715
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:37,159
Be my guest and go to Geneva, you asshole.

716
00:50:39,619 --> 00:50:41,037
-I agree.
-That was refreshing.

717
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:42,831
I admire her.

718
00:50:42,914 --> 00:50:44,708
A certification of contents? Seriously?

719
00:50:44,791 --> 00:50:45,917
He's unbelievable.

720
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:47,502
-Seriously.
-He's so brazen.

721
00:50:47,586 --> 00:50:49,546
You better not talk to me ever again.

722
00:50:49,629 --> 00:50:50,797
Got that?

723
00:50:57,596 --> 00:50:59,097
The show's over.

724
00:51:00,056 --> 00:51:01,016
Let's go.

725
00:51:07,606 --> 00:51:08,857
I'll decline the offer.

726
00:51:10,358 --> 00:51:12,402
Seriously? Do you mean that?

727
00:51:13,028 --> 00:51:15,363
Yes. I'll do my best
to lead Chief Team Two.

728
00:51:17,449 --> 00:51:19,618
-Let's have a get-together today.
-No, I'm going home.

729
00:51:19,701 --> 00:51:21,995
I'll go by the rules.
I'm clocking out right away.

730
00:51:50,649 --> 00:51:51,483
Director Jin.

731
00:51:52,984 --> 00:51:55,278
-What is it?
-Care for a drink?

732
00:51:57,572 --> 00:52:00,075
I know a perfect place to go
in this situation.

733
00:52:11,503 --> 00:52:13,922
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

734
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:21,471
Cheers.

735
00:52:25,684 --> 00:52:29,354
I rarely drink with others.

736
00:52:31,439 --> 00:52:32,357
Why?

737
00:52:34,192 --> 00:52:36,945
I know. You met him
over some drinks, didn't you?

738
00:52:37,696 --> 00:52:39,322
Gosh. What do you take me for?

739
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:41,491
We dated back in university.

740
00:52:41,575 --> 00:52:43,869
Then we both started working here.

741
00:52:44,536 --> 00:52:46,329
My senior colleagues told me

742
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:49,082
that I shouldn't date a colleague.

743
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:52,043
So we agreed to keep it a secret.

744
00:52:52,627 --> 00:52:54,337
But during our welcoming party,

745
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:57,883
I got drunk and told everyone

746
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,343
that he was mine.

747
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:04,389
-What about you?
-What?

748
00:53:04,472 --> 00:53:05,932
What was that bouquet about?

749
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:10,562
Oh, that.

750
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:14,232
One last photo.

751
00:53:14,316 --> 00:53:15,817
Give me a big smile.

752
00:53:15,901 --> 00:53:19,654
Okay. One, two, three.

753
00:53:21,364 --> 00:53:23,033
Who's catching the bouquet?

754
00:53:46,932 --> 00:53:48,516
I ran away just like that.

755
00:53:49,267 --> 00:53:50,352
That's insane.

756
00:53:50,936 --> 00:53:52,896
There are men who steal girlfriends.

757
00:53:52,979 --> 00:53:54,314
That was nothing.

758
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:58,026
You're a lunatic. I have to drink to this.

759
00:53:58,693 --> 00:53:59,778
Cheers!

760
00:54:06,451 --> 00:54:08,954
I really liked Yu-jin.

761
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:10,997
But…

762
00:54:11,498 --> 00:54:14,000
after the mess I caused,

763
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:16,044
I felt pretty relieved.

764
00:54:18,672 --> 00:54:20,340
But you know what?

765
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:23,510
She's all thumbs.

766
00:54:23,593 --> 00:54:24,970
All thumbs?

767
00:54:25,053 --> 00:54:26,805
She picks the most terrible things.

768
00:54:26,888 --> 00:54:27,973
Did you not know that?

769
00:54:28,056 --> 00:54:31,184
Perhaps, that could be the reason

770
00:54:31,267 --> 00:54:32,519
why she picked him.

771
00:54:33,144 --> 00:54:34,354
That makes sense.

772
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:37,399
He acts like a total baby.

773
00:54:37,482 --> 00:54:39,442
If he gets sick,

774
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:42,779
he wants the entire world to know.
She'll have a tough time.

775
00:54:44,155 --> 00:54:45,490
I have a high pain tolerance.

776
00:54:45,573 --> 00:54:47,075
He's terrible with directions.

777
00:54:47,158 --> 00:54:49,744
And it took him five tries
to get his driver's license.

778
00:54:49,828 --> 00:54:51,079
I got it on the first try.

779
00:54:51,162 --> 00:54:53,373
Really? Here.

780
00:54:53,456 --> 00:54:54,916
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

781
00:54:58,545 --> 00:55:00,463
And he cares a ton about his appearance.

782
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:02,882
It takes him ages to dress,
so he's always late.

783
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:04,384
He's afraid of insects

784
00:55:04,467 --> 00:55:05,760
and can't eat spicy food.

785
00:55:06,302 --> 00:55:08,763
On top of that, he's so cheap.

786
00:55:08,847 --> 00:55:11,766
You heard how he asked me
for money, right?

787
00:55:22,277 --> 00:55:25,321
Then why did you want to marry him?

788
00:55:28,408 --> 00:55:29,617
Well…

789
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:32,787
I'm not sure.

790
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:38,209
I didn't mind those things.

791
00:55:39,711 --> 00:55:43,256
I didn't mind how he acted
like a baby when he was sick.

792
00:55:45,258 --> 00:55:48,511
And his stinginess made him seem cautious,

793
00:55:49,137 --> 00:55:50,597
so I liked it.

794
00:55:53,308 --> 00:55:54,476
But most of all,

795
00:55:55,351 --> 00:55:58,229
I thought he was proud of me.

796
00:56:02,484 --> 00:56:04,736
I was just a fool.

797
00:56:12,243 --> 00:56:14,621
But I'm glad I finally know now.

798
00:56:15,538 --> 00:56:17,957
-Know what?
-Wind.

799
00:56:18,666 --> 00:56:20,210
-Sorry?
-You said

800
00:56:20,293 --> 00:56:22,087
it always leaves a trace. Big or small.

801
00:56:23,671 --> 00:56:26,341
After realizing that
I was the one who got hurt,

802
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:30,220
I finally know how to treat him now.

803
00:56:32,972 --> 00:56:34,349
It's all thanks to you.

804
00:56:37,977 --> 00:56:39,437
My pleasure.

805
00:56:46,653 --> 00:56:48,154
Isn't it hot today?

806
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:50,490
You're right.

807
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:52,826
It's a bit hot.

808
00:56:53,576 --> 00:56:56,162
Excuse me.
Are you sure you're both feeling hot?

809
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:57,247
Yes.

810
00:57:03,878 --> 00:57:06,297
-Would you like another bottle?
-I'd love that.

811
00:57:06,381 --> 00:57:08,049
Sir, can we get one more?

812
00:57:08,133 --> 00:57:09,175
Sure.

813
00:57:11,386 --> 00:57:14,597
I'm never going to date
a colleague ever again.

814
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:17,392
Come on. You never know.

815
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:22,564
I do. I will never date
another colleague ever again.

816
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:25,525
-Come on.
-Here you go.

817
00:57:25,608 --> 00:57:26,985
-Thank you.
-No problem.

818
00:57:32,323 --> 00:57:34,367
Are you sure you didn't spot that ice?

819
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:36,995
It still looks like sea fog to me.

820
00:57:38,204 --> 00:57:41,708
Director Jin and Si-woo
found it themselves.

821
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:43,042
Goodness.

822
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:46,796
People like you seem cold
but are actually warmhearted.

823
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,756
Please focus.

824
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:51,009
Darn it. I didn't see that. Hold on.

825
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:54,262
I missed that. Darn it.

826
00:57:57,056 --> 00:57:58,975
What is it? Why are you so happy?

827
00:57:59,601 --> 00:58:00,643
What?

828
00:58:01,186 --> 00:58:04,689
It's not much.
Director Jin decided to stay.

829
00:58:05,648 --> 00:58:08,902
She said she'll do her best
to lead Chief Team Two.

830
00:58:10,278 --> 00:58:11,696
I see.

831
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:13,990
I'm sorry.

832
00:58:14,574 --> 00:58:18,703
I'm afraid it'll take some time
for you to become a director.

833
00:58:18,786 --> 00:58:23,166
I told you this many times already,
but I'm not here for that position.

834
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:27,212
Things will get a bit noisy, right?

835
00:58:35,053 --> 00:58:37,388
Darn it. Whatever.

836
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:25,228
Are you up?

837
00:59:57,176 --> 00:59:58,386
Sorry.

838
00:59:59,887 --> 01:00:00,722
What?

839
01:00:01,723 --> 01:00:05,059
First, I'd like to sincerely apologize
for what happened.

840
01:00:07,103 --> 01:00:10,023
I thought we both agreed on it.

841
01:00:13,026 --> 01:00:15,570
And it was nice.

842
01:00:18,281 --> 01:00:19,991
-Thank you.
-Goodbye.

843
01:00:20,575 --> 01:00:23,036
Hey, Timely Rain.
You were quite cool today.

844
01:00:24,037 --> 01:00:25,246
Really?

845
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:28,416
Then can I kiss you because I was cool?

846
01:00:31,961 --> 01:00:34,589
-What?
-Here I go then.

847
01:01:31,854 --> 01:01:33,856
Right. We're adults, right?

848
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:34,941
Yes.

849
01:01:36,734 --> 01:01:38,319
What happened last night

850
01:01:39,112 --> 01:01:41,030
was just an incident.

851
01:01:41,114 --> 01:01:43,282
It was something
that shouldn't have happened.

852
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:45,493
Like a natural disaster.

853
01:01:45,576 --> 01:01:48,538
Two air currents that shouldn't have met.

854
01:01:48,621 --> 01:01:51,165
Like lightning, if you will.

855
01:01:51,249 --> 01:01:52,291
So?

856
01:01:53,292 --> 01:01:55,086
What I'm saying is…

857
01:02:00,341 --> 01:02:01,718
Let's just forget it happened.

858
01:02:01,801 --> 01:02:03,886
Let's be mature. Let's be cool about it.

859
01:02:06,597 --> 01:02:10,727
After all, you'll be returning to
the Metropolitan Office next week.

860
01:02:10,810 --> 01:02:13,312
And I'll be managing Chief Team Two

861
01:02:13,396 --> 01:02:15,481
and focusing solely on my work.

862
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:17,900
I don't have time for anything else.

863
01:02:17,984 --> 01:02:19,485
And dating a colleague…

864
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:21,904
You know how I feel about that.
Do you understand?

865
01:02:21,988 --> 01:02:23,281
Of course, I do.

866
01:02:25,408 --> 01:02:27,577
Okay. I'm glad you understand.

867
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:28,703
Right.

868
01:02:29,203 --> 01:02:30,705
-Thanks.
-Sure.

869
01:02:35,543 --> 01:02:36,711
Okay, then.

870
01:02:38,504 --> 01:02:39,922
But…

871
01:02:41,215 --> 01:02:42,300
I'm not going back.

872
01:02:45,303 --> 01:02:46,262
What?

873
01:02:46,345 --> 01:02:48,639
Actually, I've been appointed

874
01:02:48,723 --> 01:02:52,769
to Chief Team Two of Headquarters
starting next week.

875
01:02:56,856 --> 01:02:57,899
What do you mean?

876
01:02:58,483 --> 01:03:00,443
We'll be on the same team.

877
01:03:09,368 --> 01:03:11,037
I hope we get along.

878
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:14,248
Let's be mature. Let's be cool about it.

879
01:03:16,375 --> 01:03:17,418
Okay, then.

880
01:03:41,317 --> 01:03:42,944
This is crazy.

881
01:04:11,055 --> 01:04:13,766
Where is Director Jin? Is she always late?

882
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:16,102
I'm sorry.

883
01:04:16,185 --> 01:04:17,436
Satellite center…

884
01:04:18,187 --> 01:04:21,482
Please lift the fishing ban!
What are you doing?

885
01:04:21,566 --> 01:04:23,651
We'll do our best.

886
01:04:23,734 --> 01:04:25,444
When there's severe weather,

887
01:04:25,528 --> 01:04:28,406
an accident leads straight to casualties.
Don't you know that?

888
01:04:28,489 --> 01:04:30,449
You're withholding it on purpose

889
01:04:30,533 --> 01:04:32,493
because of your personal feelings.

890
01:04:33,077 --> 01:04:36,330
Don't worry. I won't ask you out
just because we slept together once.

891
01:04:36,414 --> 01:04:38,082
-This place is nice.
-They're coming this way.

892
01:04:38,958 --> 01:04:40,501
-Oh, no.
-Do we have something

893
01:04:40,585 --> 01:04:42,044
to hide from the others?

894
01:04:43,379 --> 01:04:44,881
That's a bit too close.

895
01:04:44,964 --> 01:04:46,757
Do you have feelings for me?

896
01:04:47,675 --> 01:04:52,346
