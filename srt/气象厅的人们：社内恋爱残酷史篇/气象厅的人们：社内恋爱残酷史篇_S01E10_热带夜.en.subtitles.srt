1
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:47,297
-Hold on.
-Sure.

2
00:00:58,433 --> 00:00:59,768
Doors closing.

3
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:00,894
Wait!

4
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:02,812
Doors opening.

5
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,022
Thank you. Hey.

6
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:06,316
-You just got home?
-Yes.

7
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:14,908
What is that?

8
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:18,745
It's a faucet for my sink.

9
00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:21,164
-It's leaking.
-I see.

10
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:22,665
Your landlord could…

11
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:26,586
Right. You're the landlord.

12
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:29,088
Mr. Landlord.

13
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:31,049
I'm still paying back the loan.

14
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:33,009
But it's registered under your name.

15
00:01:33,092 --> 00:01:34,052
That's big.

16
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:37,847
You have a decent job and a house.

17
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:39,474
Lucky her.

18
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:42,894
-Who?
-Your future wife.

19
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:51,277
Twelfth floor.

20
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:53,696
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

21
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,781
Bye.

22
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:00,995
Doors closing.

23
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:02,789
Who are you?

24
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,334
Then who are you, lady?

25
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,336
Lady?

26
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:09,838
My daughter lives here.

27
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:16,052
-Hey. What?
-Hey.

28
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,147
Hello.

29
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:30,900
Hello.

30
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:47,208
-Say yes.
-Say yes.

31
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:50,211
-Say yes.
-Say yes.

32
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:52,964
He's so cool.

33
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:55,675
Why is he taking such a risk?

34
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:57,677
"The end of love is marriage."

35
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,388
Such an obvious conclusion
isn't the only answer.

36
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:09,689
LEE SI-WOO

37
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:14,193
I'm still at work--

38
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:16,654
I think you should hurry home.

39
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,448
What?

40
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:24,454
Let me get this straight.

41
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:27,916
You two are living with my daughter?

42
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:29,918
-Yes. That's correct, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

43
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:31,711
Until when?

44
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:33,630
Until…

45
00:03:34,213 --> 00:03:36,466
Until we return to our homes--

46
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:39,177
No, until the end of
the summer disaster prevention period.

47
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,470
That's correct.

48
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,806
The end of summer disaster prevention…

49
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:46,643
It's still a ways off.

50
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,269
-Correct.
-Correct.

51
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,606
What woman in her right mind

52
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:54,234
invites two men to live
with her when she lives alone?

53
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:56,778
The disaster prevention period

54
00:03:56,861 --> 00:04:00,865
often requires spontaneous meetings, so…

55
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:03,409
-Right?
-Yes. He's right.

56
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:06,871
In any case,
we're sorry to have worried you.

57
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:09,499
You're right.

58
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:12,585
Considering my daughter's age,

59
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:15,713
I am truly worried
about this living situation.

60
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:19,259
What does she mean?

61
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,844
She's past the age of getting married.

62
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,347
By the way,

63
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:27,183
was that man we met in the elevator

64
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,143
your colleague as well?

65
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:31,729
Yes, he's also on our team.

66
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,398
-Who?
-Seok-ho.

67
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:35,233
Yes. We're on the same team.

68
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:37,318
Is he married?

69
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:38,903
-No, not yet.
-He's single.

70
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:40,989
-How old is he?
-Sorry?

71
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:43,992
How old is that man?

72
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:46,202
He and Director Jin
are probably the same age.

73
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,955
-Right?
-No.

74
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:51,332
He just looks very young.

75
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:54,377
He's actually much older than her.

76
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:57,088
He's seven years her senior.

77
00:04:57,171 --> 00:04:58,172
I see.

78
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:04,345
Seven years? That's not a problem.

79
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:06,597
Seven?

80
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,688
Why did you come without telling me?

81
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:16,482
You're unbelievable.
How could you invite strangers

82
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:18,901
into your house
without discussing it with me?

83
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:23,072
They're not strangers.
They're forecasters on my team.

84
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:26,200
So this was why

85
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:29,329
you rushed back home
when I said I was coming over.

86
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:32,206
I thought you had treasure
stashed somewhere.

87
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:34,167
Good grief.

88
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,544
It's work-related.

89
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:38,338
It's the disaster prevention period,

90
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:39,881
and I'm still a rookie director.

91
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:42,050
I needed their help, so I invited them.

92
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:43,217
Goodness.

93
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:46,554
You're not the type
to ask others for help.

94
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:49,098
You don't even ask for help
when you're very sick.

95
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:52,727
That's enough. Let's talk outside.

96
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,479
-Hurry.
-Talk here. It's hot out.

97
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:56,564
-Come with me.
-Hey.

98
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:58,816
But I--

99
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,693
-Good…
-Goodbye, ma'am.

100
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:26,385
MOM

101
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:35,269
Hey, Mom.

102
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:37,855
I know.

103
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:41,150
Something urgent came up,
so I couldn't make it.

104
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,487
I'm sorry for not making it
to your birthday.

105
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,156
What? What handbag?

106
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:54,330
-Did you go shopping again?
-That's not--

107
00:06:54,413 --> 00:06:55,957
You're so carefree.

108
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,961
Are you saying that
I'm spending thoughtlessly?

109
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:02,130
If you aren't,

110
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:05,299
you wouldn't have bought
something that expensive.

111
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:10,388
Oh, that.

112
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:12,932
I see.

113
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:16,394
No, Yu-jin was the one who picked it.

114
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:18,646
I told you.

115
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:20,982
She has good taste
and she's a good person.

116
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:24,235
But you always nitpick
and compare her to Ha-kyung.

117
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:26,446
My Yu-jin has a lot of strengths.

118
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,660
Okay.

119
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:35,329
Call her some time
and treat her to a meal.

120
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:37,165
Okay.

121
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:39,709
Bye.

122
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:48,217
Damn it. Are you an idiot?

123
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:52,847
-Lee Dong-gook shoots!
-Rebound!

124
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:55,183
They box each other out!

125
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:56,767
Will he pass or shoot?

126
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:01,147
He sinks the three-pointer!
Here comes Yang Hui-seung.

127
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:03,691
He misses. And misses again.

128
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:06,277
Ahn Jung-hwan!

129
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,071
Yoon Gyeong-sin with the rebound.
They go on a fast break!

130
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:09,989
Hey!

131
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:15,620
Ahn Jung-hwan scores!

132
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,747
That's good.

133
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:19,540
Good.

134
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:25,421
Hey…

135
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:30,468
You should have told me.

136
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:34,472
About the handbag.

137
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:40,770
Her friends loved it
when she carried it with her today.

138
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:43,272
She called me and said she was so happy.

139
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:46,692
They commented on how she had
such a wonderful daughter-in-law.

140
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,112
I'm sorry for what I said

141
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:51,864
that day.

142
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:55,243
It's fine.

143
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:58,538
By the way,

144
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,249
where did you get the money?

145
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:04,877
I'm sure it exceeded
the maximum limit of our credit card.

146
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:07,964
I used my summer bonus
and some money I had on the side.

147
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:14,178
I knew we'd be too busy
to go on a summer vacation.

148
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:18,182
So I decided
to just spend it on your mother.

149
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:22,395
Thank you, Yu-jin.

150
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:26,440
I was being extremely inconsiderate.

151
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:29,360
Whatever.

152
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:31,946
Can you please forgive me this once?

153
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:40,246
I'm so sorry. I was wrong.

154
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:42,665
Do you want a massage?

155
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:47,211
I'm really sorry. I'll treat you better.

156
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:52,967
I bet the bills are much higher
now that you live with two other people.

157
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,760
Are they paying their share?

158
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:56,262
I invited them to live with me.

159
00:09:58,222 --> 00:10:01,100
Make sure they pay
their share for all the bills.

160
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:03,227
Mom, I'm their director.

161
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:04,854
Goodness.

162
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:08,357
I know you're a halfwit.

163
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:14,530
Director Jin's mother
must have taken a liking

164
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,909
to Assistant Director Shin.

165
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:21,203
Still, Director Jin's opinions matter too.

166
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:23,998
She shouldn't be so forceful.

167
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:28,544
Seok-ho tends
to give off an indifferent vibe.

168
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:32,548
He may not be perfect

169
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,675
and seem unfriendly,

170
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:38,846
but he'd be a decent husband.
Don't you think so?

171
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:45,019
I'm telling you.
They don't suit each other.

172
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,397
Seok-ho and Director Jin

173
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:50,983
have absolutely nothing in common.

174
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:53,361
They have different hobbies and tastes.

175
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:55,071
They just can't get along.

176
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,822
Come on.

177
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:01,452
You never know.

178
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:05,456
At times, even the most impossible
becomes possible.

179
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:07,625
Especially when it comes to men and women.

180
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,168
Gosh.

181
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:13,297
You never know. You're so naive.

182
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:36,821
By the way,

183
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:40,950
I heard there's another colleague
who lives above you.

184
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:43,994
-Who? Assistant Director Shin?
-That's his position?

185
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:48,999
He was dressed so neatly.
He seemed like a nice guy.

186
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,709
-Right?
-Mind your own business.

187
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:52,503
-The cab is here.
-Come on.

188
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:55,047
It's only natural for me to be interested.

189
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:57,466
Don't be so cold to him.

190
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,468
Take your time and get to know him.

191
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,720
Who knows what'll happen, right?

192
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:03,722
You can go, sir. Get home safe, Mom.

193
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:09,979
Assistant Director Shin?

194
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:13,607
A seven-year age gap is nothing.

195
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:34,920
Did your mother go home?

196
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:37,631
Yes.

197
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:42,094
Si-woo…

198
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:43,888
doesn't believe in marriage.

199
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:49,977
He doesn't want to marry anyone.

200
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:57,735
Ha-kyung doesn't sincerely date anyone
if they're not a marriage prospect.

201
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:01,989
You knew that, right?

202
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:10,372
-How about a beer?
-Do you want a beer?

203
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:15,961
-Let's have a drink.
-Okay.

204
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:30,935
I met with Reporter Chae.

205
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:34,897
She said you're not interested
in getting married.

206
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:37,858
Right.

207
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,534
Can I ask why?

208
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:49,328
I don't think marriage suits me.

209
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:53,374
And I wonder if marriage has to be
the next step when in love.

210
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:58,587
Being tied to each other as a family

211
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,130
makes me uncomfortable.

212
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:04,468
And I don't want the person I love

213
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:07,263
to carry my burdens either.

214
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:17,273
So for you, having a family is a burden.

215
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:19,149
You know why.

216
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:26,156
That's why I decided
that I would never get married.

217
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:33,372
Are you disappointed?

218
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:35,249
No.

219
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:38,043
It's just…

220
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,671
I've never thought about a relationship

221
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:43,048
that didn't lead to marriage.

222
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:45,718
But you see,

223
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:48,220
that doesn't mean
I'm not sincere toward you.

224
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:51,807
I don't consider what we have a fling.

225
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:54,184
-My feelings are very genuine.
-I know.

226
00:14:58,564 --> 00:14:59,607
I'm just curious.

227
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:04,904
What could be
at the end of our relationship?

228
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:09,450
If it's not marriage,

229
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:13,913
what could be awaiting us at the end?

230
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:21,170
Sleep is heavily affected by temperature.

231
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:23,088
High temperature

232
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:26,133
stimulates our central nervous system

233
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,552
and hinders deep sleep.

234
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:46,236
On such nights, we become lost in thought.

235
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,615
When that happens,

236
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:52,201
we end up having complicated feelings

237
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:55,329
and that leads to more thoughts.

238
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:59,333
And eventually, we become
even more lost in thought.

239
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:03,921
It's hot.

240
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:06,548
Gosh, it's hot.

241
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:12,805
EPISODE 10
TROPICAL NIGHT

242
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:17,309
Last night, the lowest temperature
in Seoul was 25°C.

243
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:20,479
It was our first tropical night this year.

244
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:22,481
The weather is hot this morning as well.

245
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:26,402
-Many areas will be 31°C or higher today.
-Good morning.

246
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:30,280
-It'll be sweltering hot today too.
-I can't take it.

247
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:33,450
The monsoon rain
should have cooled down the heat.

248
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:35,035
Tonight will be hot as well.

249
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,996
It's very humid too.

250
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:39,665
-Sensible temperature will be even higher.
-Take care of yourselves.

251
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:42,501
-That concludes the weather forecast.
-Are you that worried?

252
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:45,921
It looks like you didn't
sleep much last night.

253
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,423
It was pretty hot.

254
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,511
We're an inconvenience, aren't we?

255
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:54,096
You can't even open your door freely.

256
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:55,931
Thankfully,

257
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,726
I don't sleep with the door open
no matter how hot it gets.

258
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:00,185
Don't worry about me.

259
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:03,063
Anyway, I'm sorry.

260
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:06,650
I'll go back home as soon as possible.

261
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:08,444
You don't have to rush.

262
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:17,786
Goodness. Look at him.

263
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,747
He must have not gotten any sleep either.

264
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:21,165
What?

265
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:24,043
The tropical nights
will worsen for the time being.

266
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:26,211
You're going to have a bumpy ride.

267
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,964
I'm going to get ready first.

268
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,090
Okay.

269
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,185
Did you not sleep well?

270
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:42,728
It was pretty hot.

271
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:46,273
It was.

272
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:53,489
Let's see.

273
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,784
You've all been waiting for this.

274
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:59,745
We brought the top three items
for newlyweds.

275
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:03,123
It's really hot these days.
An AC, a fridge, and a washing machine.

276
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:06,251
-This set is only available on our--
-I wonder what's on the news.

277
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:11,215
Statistics Korea has analyzed
the marriage rate and birth rate to--

278
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:14,134
-Do you want some coffee?
-I'll make toast.

279
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:15,344
-Good.
-Okay.

280
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,683
Doors opening.

281
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:32,528
You never know.

282
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:36,573
At times, even the most impossible
becomes possible.

283
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:38,742
Especially when it comes to men and women.

284
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:40,410
Gosh.

285
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:42,538
You never know.

286
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:46,166
-Hey, did you have breakfast?
-Hey.

287
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:53,757
Doors closing.

288
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:59,721
It's too hot to make kimchi.

289
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:02,516
Mom, why are you buying
so many young radishes?

290
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:05,519
Don't you know how tasty it is
if you make kimchi with this

291
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:06,979
and have it with cold noodles?

292
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:09,481
So exactly why
are you making so much of it?

293
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,233
I have my reasons.

294
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:13,610
-Here.
-Okay. Thank you.

295
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:14,903
Hey, we need to hurry.

296
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:17,906
We're short on time
if we want to make this all today.

297
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:20,409
What reasons?

298
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,619
You terrify me

299
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:25,455
whenever you say that.
What's up your sleeve?

300
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:28,709
You see…

301
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:33,130
It's about the guy
who lives above Ha-kyung.

302
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:34,506
What?

303
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:36,383
You know,

304
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:40,888
-the one who kept those side dishes.
-Apartment number 1302?

305
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:44,308
He works with Ha-kyung on her team.

306
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:45,559
Really?

307
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:47,686
Then why didn't he say anything?

308
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:48,854
What?

309
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:51,565
-Do you know him well?
-Of course not.

310
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:54,151
We just ran into each other
a couple of times.

311
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:56,528
He seemed like a decent guy.

312
00:19:57,112 --> 00:20:00,073
There you go,
trying to hook Ha-kyung up again.

313
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:03,911
How about you help me out
and look into him for me?

314
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:06,997
-Look into what?
-What else?

315
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:12,586
Find out if he's
a good match with Ha-kyung.

316
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:14,379
Okay?

317
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:21,929
Seoul's aerological observation data is…

318
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:28,101
CHIEF TEAM TWO, DIRECTOR JIN HA-KYUNG

319
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:35,859
Assistant Director Oh.

320
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,695
-Assistant Director Oh!
-What?

321
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:40,447
What? What is it?

322
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:43,992
It's about Taebaek's AWS levels.

323
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,619
Is this right?

324
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:47,579
Yes, it is.

325
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:48,956
What's wrong?

326
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,834
Did you not sleep well last night?

327
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:55,254
It was way too hot.

328
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:59,049
Our youngest kid was tossing and turning,

329
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:00,801
so I couldn't sleep either.

330
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:02,636
I'm so out of it today.

331
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:04,721
We can't leave the AC on all night long.

332
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:07,015
And your husband?

333
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,643
Well, he's busy studying.

334
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:12,187
Since he wanted to try it out,

335
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,273
I told him to just go to town.

336
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:17,693
This won't do.

337
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:19,903
I'll go splash some cold water on my face.

338
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:22,239
Gosh.

339
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:28,662
It'd be quicker if she took
the Grade Five exam instead.

340
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:32,582
She had the best grade

341
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,501
among Grade Seven test-takers
when she came here.

342
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:37,879
She was clever, quick,
and had great leadership skills.

343
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:41,508
Everyone thought
she'd become the next director.

344
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:44,177
But then came housework and raising kids.

345
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:45,637
She overworked herself.

346
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:48,140
Now, she's stuck in her position.

347
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:51,685
Plus, her husband quit
to prepare for the state exam.

348
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:53,145
She has a lot on her plate.

349
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:56,064
I'm impressed
that she's still going strong.

350
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:57,107
Don't you think so?

351
00:21:57,691 --> 00:22:00,027
She has no choice. She's the breadwinner.

352
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:02,404
Right. You're right.

353
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:06,408
Did you not sleep well either?

354
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:09,077
Yes. The tropical nights.

355
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:10,245
Let's get back to work.

356
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:15,917
Even those who analyze
the weather can't beat the heat.

357
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:21,757
Hey, Yu-jin.

358
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,301
What? Wait.

359
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:26,470
What's a senior writer doing here?

360
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:30,265
There's nothing interesting
to report nowadays.

361
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:33,018
That's why you're here?

362
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:34,811
You know what they say.

363
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:37,439
"When in need of a scoop, go to the KMA."

364
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:39,983
I'm sure I'll get something
if I stay here long enough.

365
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:42,486
By the way,

366
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:43,945
how's the cafeteria food here?

367
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:45,572
It's not bad.

368
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:47,199
Okay. See you around.

369
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:57,292
Hello?

370
00:22:57,375 --> 00:22:59,169
I heard Heo Ju-yeong is there.

371
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:05,967
-How did you know?
-Damn it. That's not important.

372
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,595
Don't think about coming back
if he steals your scoop.

373
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:11,890
There's no scoop to begin with.

374
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:14,768
You don't know
what that leech is capable of.

375
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:17,187
During his time there,

376
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:19,481
he will find something to write about.

377
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:20,690
Keep an eye on him.

378
00:23:21,399 --> 00:23:23,193
Everyone knows that's your home ground.

379
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:26,113
You'll lose face if he steals your scoop.

380
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:29,241
-Okay.
-Think of your hardworking colleagues.

381
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:31,952
-It's all on you.
-I get it.

382
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:38,375
Hello, I'm from Munmin Daily.

383
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:45,757
As of now, we cannot locate
the stationary front.

384
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:48,343
Due to the expansion
of the North Pacific's anticyclone,

385
00:23:48,426 --> 00:23:51,304
our peninsula is suffering
from high temperature and humidity.

386
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:53,473
The heatwave will continue at this rate,

387
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:57,644
and the tropical nights
will be 25°C or higher.

388
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:01,106
If the tropical nights continue,

389
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:03,108
people will use more electricity.

390
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:05,944
Then a blackout could occur.

391
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:09,030
That's true,
but the media is also a problem.

392
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:11,158
Using strong words

393
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:12,909
such as "steaming hot",

394
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:14,953
"the hottest", and "deadly heat"

395
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:16,705
will only provoke people.

396
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:18,039
Goodness.

397
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:23,920
We've sent out materials
explaining the heat waves to the media.

398
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:26,756
We will do our best
in dealing with the media.

399
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,676
Okay.

400
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:31,553
-Hurry up.
-What?

401
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:36,558
-Next time.
-Okay.

402
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,395
What is it? Is there a problem?

403
00:24:40,478 --> 00:24:41,438
Not at all.

404
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,658
That will be all
for the forecast discussion.

405
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:55,243
Good work, guys.

406
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:57,704
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

407
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:08,798
We need to talk.

408
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:19,184
What's going on?

409
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:21,478
Let's sit down.

410
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:46,294
Never in my wildest dreams
did I think I'd ask you this.

411
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:49,631
But how's married life?

412
00:25:53,593 --> 00:25:54,594
Are you talking to me?

413
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:57,180
-Were you asking me?
-Be serious.

414
00:25:57,764 --> 00:25:59,599
I'm genuinely curious.

415
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:01,685
What is it?

416
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:03,728
Did Si-woo propose to you?

417
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:06,356
Forget that I asked.

418
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:08,733
Fine. I'll be serious.

419
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:13,571
Let's see. How is married life?

420
00:26:14,572 --> 00:26:15,949
It's not easy

421
00:26:16,032 --> 00:26:19,327
to define it as good,
bad, or anything else.

422
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:21,579
It's hard to explain.

423
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:24,165
Is that so?

424
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:29,754
I thought everything would be peachy
if we just loved each other.

425
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:31,631
But it turned out I was wrong.

426
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:35,927
There's so much
we need to look out for and take care of.

427
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:38,722
I thought it'd just double
since there were two of us.

428
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:41,182
But rather, it increased tenfold.

429
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:43,685
Well…

430
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:47,981
As you know,
it wasn't easy for us to get married.

431
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:52,402
I think I feel pressured
to maintain a happy married life.

432
00:26:52,902 --> 00:26:55,947
I become quite irritable
with the smallest things.

433
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:00,785
And…

434
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:05,582
And in the past,
I wasn't too concerned about others.

435
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:07,834
But once we got married,

436
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:12,922
I became aware of those
around us whom I didn't think much of.

437
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:16,301
And on the other hand,
those with whom I used to be close

438
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:18,595
make me feel uncomfortable now.

439
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:23,224
Anyway, you see each other's flaws better

440
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:25,852
when you start living together.

441
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:29,856
Understanding and accepting them
aren't easy either.

442
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:47,749
Isn't that nuisance from Munmin Daily?

443
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:48,917
What?

444
00:27:53,671 --> 00:27:55,215
What's with you guys these days?

445
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:57,884
I get that you're in need of a scoop,

446
00:27:57,967 --> 00:27:59,886
but that's just not right.

447
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:06,226
One minute.

448
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:12,315
Can we talk?

449
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:19,656
Here's your strawberry smoothie.

450
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:22,158
I'm busy.

451
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:25,245
I just wanted to treat you to something.

452
00:28:25,328 --> 00:28:28,289
Then you could have just
bought me some drinks.

453
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:34,504
You've become prettier
after getting married.

454
00:28:34,587 --> 00:28:35,880
Is that so?

455
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:38,758
I heard your husband works here.

456
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:40,593
He does.

457
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:46,057
Do you have any juicy information?

458
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:48,601
Rumors are fine too.

459
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:53,148
Or perhaps,
an intense rivalry among the teams.

460
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:57,110
Even bullying or
sexual harassment cases would work

461
00:28:57,193 --> 00:28:58,987
since they're civil servants.

462
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:02,198
Speaking of which…

463
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:04,117
What is it?

464
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:08,329
Recently, I heard that
the higher-ups were having a power grab.

465
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:10,874
Hold on. Who are?

466
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:12,959
What kind of a power grab?

467
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:15,295
Wait. By higher-ups…

468
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:17,922
The Vice Administrator and Administrator?

469
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:19,674
Higher. Even higher.

470
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,134
Even higher than them.

471
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:24,679
The mT and mP.

472
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:26,973
The mT…

473
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,017
and mP?

474
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:37,025
-Gosh.
-What are you doing?

475
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:39,569
That's Yu-jin.

476
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:41,571
Isn't that Reporter Heo Ju-yeong

477
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:43,072
from Munmin Daily?

478
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,033
I don't know.

479
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:46,910
His nickname is Butcher Heo.

480
00:29:46,993 --> 00:29:48,036
Is that so?

481
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:51,122
If he puts his mind to it,

482
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:53,583
he could get anyone fired.

483
00:29:53,666 --> 00:29:56,002
But why is a society journalist here?

484
00:29:56,085 --> 00:29:58,213
And why is Reporter Chae with him?

485
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:10,975
What's mT?

486
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:13,394
What is that?

487
00:30:14,395 --> 00:30:16,523
Is it short for someone's name? Who is it?

488
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:20,109
Well, mT stands for

489
00:30:21,444 --> 00:30:22,904
"Maritime Tropical air mass."

490
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:24,948
And mP stands
for "Maritime Polar air mass."

491
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:30,036
During summertime,
these two air masses have a power grab.

492
00:30:32,288 --> 00:30:35,124
You can't get a scoop here
when you don't even know the basics.

493
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:41,798
Will you really stay here?

494
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:46,719
Simply put,

495
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:51,057
you want me to leave your turf, right?

496
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:53,101
I'm just saying that

497
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:55,937
it'll be hard for me to do my job

498
00:30:56,020 --> 00:31:00,108
if someone as great as you
steals such trivial scoops.

499
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:03,319
What if I refuse to leave?

500
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:07,156
Then I'll write up an article
that would cause a stir in society.

501
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:10,493
I'd rather be an idiot
who can't think straight

502
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:13,955
than an incompetent person
who can't even do her job right.

503
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,165
You've gotten good at this.

504
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:18,877
I'll take that as a compliment, sir.

505
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:36,603
I can't believe he's my senior.

506
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,897
What kind of a journalist is--

507
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:42,525
Are you okay?

508
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:44,360
I'm fine.

509
00:31:48,114 --> 00:31:48,990
Wait.

510
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:52,869
Can we talk for a minute?

511
00:31:58,291 --> 00:32:00,168
Time sure flies.

512
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:02,837
I still remember
my first day here in my winter jacket.

513
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:04,672
Really?

514
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:09,052
It feels like it's been ages
since I got married.

515
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,223
Why did you want to talk?

516
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:22,899
How did you feel

517
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:26,361
when I told you that I wasn't interested

518
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:28,655
in getting married?

519
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:38,790
Simply put,

520
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:41,000
I was speechless.

521
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:44,045
"What's his deal?"

522
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:45,964
"Then why is he dating me?"

523
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:49,842
All sorts of thoughts
went through my head.

524
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:52,387
And then?

525
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:57,225
I knew that we weren't dating

526
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:59,477
with marriage in mind.

527
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,437
But in the end,

528
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:04,148
we were looking
at different paths in life.

529
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:10,196
I realized that
we didn't share the same future.

530
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:21,040
I think that's when it all began.

531
00:33:23,626 --> 00:33:26,295
I thought,
"We're going to break up one day."

532
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:30,425
Then I slowly began falling out of love.

533
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:35,638
And that's when I met Ki-jun.

534
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:03,624
I think that's when it all began.

535
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:06,836
I thought,
"We're going to break up one day."

536
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:10,715
Then I slowly began falling out of love.

537
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:26,189
What?

538
00:34:26,272 --> 00:34:28,149
What's with Yeouido's current temperature?

539
00:34:32,111 --> 00:34:33,529
Is something wrong?

540
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:35,448
It's 36.7°C.

541
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:39,160
That's seven degrees higher
than neighboring areas.

542
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:40,953
Did you do proper MQC?

543
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:43,831
Well, I did look at it but…

544
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:47,168
You looked at it, but what?

545
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:49,253
Wait. One minute, sir.

546
00:34:49,962 --> 00:34:52,590
Remove the information
from the prevention portal site.

547
00:34:52,673 --> 00:34:55,927
-Do it before it causes more confusion.
-Yes, ma'am. One second.

548
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:58,596
-Hold on. This is…
-I'll do it.

549
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:18,032
What? What's wrong with this?

550
00:35:26,165 --> 00:35:27,708
Is something wrong?

551
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,796
Something's wrong
with Yeouido's temperature.

552
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:33,714
I think it's just an error.

553
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:35,341
An error?

554
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:40,555
Let me see.

555
00:35:50,022 --> 00:35:51,023
Seok-ho.

556
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:54,360
So…

557
00:35:55,027 --> 00:35:56,988
what will happen to Assistant Director Oh?

558
00:35:57,488 --> 00:36:00,867
Her MQC mistake on
the AWS is considered neglect of duty.

559
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:03,661
They'll go by the rules
and she'll be warned or disciplined.

560
00:36:03,744 --> 00:36:06,539
That's too harsh. It was just a mistake.

561
00:36:10,918 --> 00:36:14,088
-You tend to be really naive at times.
-What?

562
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:15,840
We're civil servants.

563
00:36:15,923 --> 00:36:17,884
We're not allowed to make mistakes.

564
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:28,060
Where are you going?

565
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:30,438
To the toilet.

566
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:36,194
What should we do?

567
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:38,779
You need to report this
to the Director General, right?

568
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:40,573
How long was the error up for?

569
00:36:40,656 --> 00:36:42,074
Probably less than five minutes.

570
00:36:44,785 --> 00:36:47,830
I'll take care of it.
You can get back to work.

571
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:48,873
Yes, ma'am.

572
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:06,098
Thank you.

573
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:13,397
I don't usually make
such trivial mistakes.

574
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:14,482
I know.

575
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:16,150
This was a first.

576
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:17,401
I'm sorry.

577
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:21,030
I haven't been getting any sleep lately.

578
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:24,700
Goodness, I know I shouldn't make excuses.

579
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:27,286
I'm sorry.

580
00:37:29,538 --> 00:37:32,500
Why don't you go to the night-duty room
and nap for an hour?

581
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:36,254
-Don't I need to report this?
-I'll take care of it.

582
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:38,547
Thank you.

583
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:45,638
Look, Director Jin.

584
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:50,101
You shouldn't get married.

585
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,481
You may be offended to hear this.

586
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:58,776
But when I heard
that you had called off your marriage,

587
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,070
I actually envied you.

588
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:05,616
Only those who are lucky can do that.

589
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:09,287
Those of us who got married and had kids

590
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:11,247
because we thought we were obliged to…

591
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:15,084
There's not much we can do.

592
00:38:17,753 --> 00:38:20,965
You should enjoy
a carefree and comfortable life.

593
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,385
Doing whatever you want

594
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:28,347
and enjoying all the free time you have.

595
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:36,355
-That's you.
-Don't be absurd.

596
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:37,606
What?

597
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:40,192
-Are we late?
-Students, please follow me.

598
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:41,485
-Okay.
-Okay.

599
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:49,076
Hello?

600
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,370
Did Bo-mi not go to school today?

601
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:56,459
She's on a field trip.

602
00:38:57,126 --> 00:38:58,461
Why do you ask?

603
00:38:58,544 --> 00:38:59,920
She's here.

604
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:02,340
-"Here"?
-The KMA.

605
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:04,050
Anyway, I'll call you back.

606
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:10,139
Why would she…

607
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:21,984
You should have called me
when you arrived here.

608
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:23,402
Then I would have given you

609
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:26,030
and your friends
a complete tour of this place.

610
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:27,573
But you're a civil servant.

611
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,326
You shouldn't abuse
your authority like that.

612
00:39:31,994 --> 00:39:34,080
Right. You're right.

613
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:37,124
So where did you visit?

614
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:38,959
The Forecast and
Earthquake and Volcano Bureaus.

615
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:40,127
I see.

616
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:41,879
How does it feel to see us?

617
00:39:41,962 --> 00:39:45,174
Don't you think we work hard?

618
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:48,052
I already knew that.

619
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:49,095
What?

620
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:50,679
Mom once said

621
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:53,641
only those who are smart

622
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:55,267
appreciate the KMA's hard work.

623
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:57,853
That's right.

624
00:39:57,937 --> 00:39:59,980
Of course. Since you know that as well,

625
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:02,108
that makes you smart too.

626
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:08,489
Are you coming tomorrow too?

627
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:11,242
No, next week. Why?

628
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:15,246
You see, the cafeteria here
has really tasty food.

629
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:16,664
I'll buy you a meal.

630
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:18,165
Okay? So call me.

631
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:21,252
I can abuse that much authority, right?

632
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:24,880
Well, I'll think about it.

633
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:26,757
Okay.

634
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:30,511
Give it some thought. In a good light.

635
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:38,102
Why did you go there out of the blue?

636
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:40,271
I told you. It was a field trip.

637
00:40:40,354 --> 00:40:42,356
But why the KMA of all places?

638
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,192
The teacher said
I needed to leave a record of visiting

639
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:47,528
a science-related place
if I wanted to go to my dream school.

640
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:48,779
That's why.

641
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:50,906
Then you could have told me beforehand.

642
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:53,075
You would have dissuaded me from going.

643
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:53,993
What?

644
00:40:54,076 --> 00:40:55,619
You're always like that.

645
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:57,663
You don't call Dad
even when it's important

646
00:40:57,746 --> 00:40:58,956
since you don't want to bother him.

647
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:00,875
You keep everything bottled up.

648
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:02,668
I deserve to know.

649
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:06,422
What do you need to know?

650
00:41:06,505 --> 00:41:08,382
Exactly how important his job is.

651
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:10,176
How important was it

652
00:41:10,259 --> 00:41:13,137
that he neglected us
and devoted his life to it?

653
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:15,764
Don't I deserve to know?

654
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:20,769
So what did you find out?

655
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:22,104
I've only been there once.

656
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:23,522
So you'll go again?

657
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:25,065
Once more next week.

658
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:40,498
Did something good happen?

659
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:42,583
You know what?

660
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:46,837
My daughter came
to the KMA on a field trip.

661
00:41:49,548 --> 00:41:51,759
Do you know what's really fascinating?

662
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:53,719
My daughter…

663
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:56,222
takes after me.

664
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:00,643
But isn't that a given?

665
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:01,852
It is.

666
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:06,732
Your children always amaze you.

667
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:09,610
Dealing with my daughter is
the hardest thing.

668
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:12,321
But then again, she's the one

669
00:42:12,404 --> 00:42:14,740
who makes me smile the most.

670
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:17,743
-Gosh.
-Do you love her that much?

671
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:20,829
Get married and have a baby yourself.

672
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:22,998
It's an indescribable feeling.

673
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:25,876
You have to experience it firsthand
to know how it feels.

674
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,337
But you even ran away from home.

675
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:30,631
Do you still love your family that much?

676
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:33,092
Still, family is all I have.

677
00:42:34,593 --> 00:42:38,764
Don't jump from one office
to another like I did.

678
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:41,141
Try to stay with your family.

679
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:43,477
Living apart from your family
for a long time

680
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:46,230
doesn't do you any good.

681
00:42:46,772 --> 00:42:48,732
You see… What?

682
00:42:50,317 --> 00:42:52,278
Stop by after you clock out.

683
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:53,487
What's going on?

684
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:54,947
Hey, my wife…

685
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:57,741
-Okay.
-Hey.

686
00:42:57,825 --> 00:42:59,368
-Go in first.
-Okay.

687
00:42:59,451 --> 00:43:02,371
-I need to stop by my house.
-Sure. See you.

688
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:04,290
-Okay. Bye.
-Bye.

689
00:43:05,165 --> 00:43:06,667
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

690
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:13,132
Hello.

691
00:43:13,215 --> 00:43:15,426
Hello. What is it this time?

692
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:19,096
-Please take this.
-What is this?

693
00:43:19,179 --> 00:43:20,347
It's kimchi.

694
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:24,852
My mom wanted to thank you for
holding on to the side dishes last time.

695
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:26,228
She didn't have to.

696
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:29,023
Please. I'm sorry,

697
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:31,775
but may I go inside and wash my hands?

698
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:33,819
I think I spilled some on my way here.

699
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:36,947
-My hands smell like kimchi.
-Gosh.

700
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:38,157
Hold on.

701
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,783
-Thank you.
-What? Wait.

702
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:42,620
Excuse me? Ma'am?

703
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:54,381
Doors opening.

704
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:03,307
What are you doing there?

705
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:04,892
What? Well…

706
00:44:05,392 --> 00:44:07,144
You see…

707
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:10,105
Come inside.

708
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:11,982
No, it's okay.

709
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:14,276
By the way, take this.

710
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:16,028
-Here.
-Okay.

711
00:44:16,111 --> 00:44:18,197
Take this inside.

712
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:21,867
But you came all the way here. Come in.

713
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:23,202
But I…

714
00:44:25,412 --> 00:44:26,872
Then I'll just stop by.

715
00:44:26,955 --> 00:44:28,415
Okay.

716
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:44,264
Why are you back here again?

717
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:46,892
Am I not allowed to?

718
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:48,477
I brought some side dishes.

719
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:49,812
Happy?

720
00:44:54,066 --> 00:44:57,194
Don't barge in like this
when I'm not living alone.

721
00:44:57,277 --> 00:44:59,571
All the more reason why
I should come more often.

722
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:01,824
You're living with two grown men.

723
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:06,370
Why would you be worried?

724
00:45:06,453 --> 00:45:08,539
Get married and have a daughter first.

725
00:45:08,622 --> 00:45:10,541
Then we'll talk.

726
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:13,752
Anyway, you should leave soon.

727
00:45:13,836 --> 00:45:16,380
Senior Forecaster Um will arrive soon.
He'll be uncomfortable.

728
00:45:16,463 --> 00:45:19,425
I was going to leave even if
you begged me not to, so don't worry.

729
00:45:19,508 --> 00:45:21,510
-Good grief.
-Ma'am.

730
00:45:21,593 --> 00:45:23,470
Have some of this before you go.

731
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:25,264
What?

732
00:45:25,347 --> 00:45:27,349
-Thank you.
-My pleasure.

733
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:31,603
But what's taking her so long?

734
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:33,397
Who?

735
00:45:37,776 --> 00:45:38,819
Well…

736
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:43,949
You see, I…

737
00:45:50,789 --> 00:45:51,748
Here.

738
00:45:52,666 --> 00:45:54,209
Thank you.

739
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:06,013
You must be very well-versed.

740
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:09,433
I'm just reading the bare minimum.

741
00:46:09,516 --> 00:46:10,726
So cocky.

742
00:46:10,809 --> 00:46:12,060
Sorry?

743
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:14,104
Oh, I just said you were incredible.

744
00:46:14,688 --> 00:46:15,606
I see.

745
00:46:18,358 --> 00:46:22,154
Your mother didn't need to give me this.

746
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:26,325
Our family's motto is to repay kindness.

747
00:46:26,408 --> 00:46:28,869
And who doesn't need side dishes?

748
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:30,704
Don't you need to eat too?

749
00:46:30,787 --> 00:46:32,331
I cook single servings.

750
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:35,083
You're the neat type.

751
00:46:35,667 --> 00:46:37,377
An only child? Or are you the eldest son?

752
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:39,588
-I'm an only child.
-Where's your hometown?

753
00:46:39,671 --> 00:46:41,215
Suwon. Why do you ask?

754
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:43,091
I just want to get to know

755
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:44,676
my sister's colleague.

756
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:47,137
I see. Well, anyway…

757
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:49,723
Please tell your mother I said thank you.

758
00:46:49,806 --> 00:46:52,559
-But next time--
-Same team, same apartment, and neighbors.

759
00:46:53,435 --> 00:46:56,313
Don't you think
you two were destined to meet?

760
00:46:56,396 --> 00:47:00,234
Many KMA people live around here.

761
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:04,780
I know six colleagues
who live in this same apartment.

762
00:47:05,364 --> 00:47:07,074
That's a lot.

763
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:27,344
CITY CROCODILE
BY JIN TAE-KYUNG

764
00:47:34,142 --> 00:47:35,227
You see…

765
00:47:36,144 --> 00:47:39,064
It may have lacked research,

766
00:47:39,147 --> 00:47:42,234
but the plot wasn't too bad.

767
00:47:46,446 --> 00:47:47,906
Which part did you like?

768
00:47:56,832 --> 00:47:57,958
What?

769
00:47:58,041 --> 00:48:00,085
You made her do what?

770
00:48:00,168 --> 00:48:01,795
Look. Hear me out first.

771
00:48:01,878 --> 00:48:03,672
-What's your problem?
-Goodness.

772
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:05,841
Was I not clear enough?

773
00:48:05,924 --> 00:48:08,594
Assistant Director Shin is my subordinate.

774
00:48:08,677 --> 00:48:11,138
I'm upset, but what about him?

775
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:12,764
What would he think of me?

776
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:17,394
If you want someone to rely on,
you should find a man for yourself!

777
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:21,481
How dare you say that?

778
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:23,275
That's no way to talk to your mom.

779
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:26,236
Do you know how it feels
to lose sleep worrying about your kid?

780
00:48:26,945 --> 00:48:28,363
I'm doing this for you.

781
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:30,115
What a rude brat. What did you say?

782
00:48:30,198 --> 00:48:31,408
I should find a man?

783
00:48:32,784 --> 00:48:34,077
That's not right.

784
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:39,583
See? Even he disagrees.

785
00:48:41,043 --> 00:48:42,419
No, ma'am.

786
00:48:42,502 --> 00:48:45,631
I disagree with you, not Director Jin.

787
00:48:46,923 --> 00:48:47,966
What?

788
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:51,511
Rarely do people feel happy
when their parents force them to do things

789
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:54,389
on the pretext of doing it for their kids.

790
00:48:55,724 --> 00:48:57,809
Hold on. Then tell me.

791
00:48:57,893 --> 00:49:01,521
Should I just sit back
and watch as she gets older?

792
00:49:02,147 --> 00:49:04,191
Should I let her
give up her opportunities,

793
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:06,234
decent men, and her youth?

794
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:07,944
Even if it's a great opportunity,

795
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:10,072
wouldn't it be useless
if she doesn't want it?

796
00:49:10,822 --> 00:49:14,242
You don't know what you're talking about.

797
00:49:14,326 --> 00:49:16,870
-When it comes to marriage--
-I'm not getting married.

798
00:49:18,413 --> 00:49:19,581
What?

799
00:49:23,001 --> 00:49:25,045
I'm not getting married, Mom.

800
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:33,053
Goodness. It's getting late.

801
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:35,555
You should rest up.
We'll talk again tomorrow.

802
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:37,140
I'm serious.

803
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:40,519
I've made up my mind. I'm not going to.

804
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:44,022
Hey, Ha-kyung.

805
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:49,361
You didn't have to
say something so extreme.

806
00:49:49,444 --> 00:49:52,030
I get it. I was way out of line today.

807
00:49:52,114 --> 00:49:54,324
Let's just say
I crossed the line a little.

808
00:49:55,117 --> 00:49:56,326
I won't get married.

809
00:49:57,494 --> 00:50:00,747
I've decided I don't want to get married.

810
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:03,667
So don't mention marriage, blind dates,

811
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:05,210
or men to me ever again.

812
00:50:06,128 --> 00:50:06,962
Ha-kyung.

813
00:50:07,045 --> 00:50:09,381
I can't see you out today. Go home safely.

814
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:31,194
That's why crocodiles' hind feet
have four toes.

815
00:50:32,112 --> 00:50:33,113
Gosh.

816
00:50:34,156 --> 00:50:36,241
You're a scientist.

817
00:50:36,742 --> 00:50:38,535
No, this is nothing impressive.

818
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:40,829
Of course, it is.

819
00:50:40,912 --> 00:50:43,373
You know so much about animals.

820
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:47,127
It's not that I'm a scientist.

821
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:49,796
I just have a lot of interest in animals.

822
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:51,798
I see.

823
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:55,135
What about penguins?

824
00:50:55,218 --> 00:50:57,179
Do you know much about them?

825
00:50:57,929 --> 00:50:58,889
Penguins?

826
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:03,059
Actually, I'm planning my next story,

827
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:04,853
and the main character is a penguin.

828
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:08,106
So I was wondering if you knew anything.

829
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:13,361
Penguins are my favorite animal.

830
00:51:14,112 --> 00:51:15,572
No way. Are you serious?

831
00:51:15,655 --> 00:51:18,492
-Yes.
-That's great!

832
00:51:19,117 --> 00:51:20,744
Then can you help me?

833
00:51:20,827 --> 00:51:21,745
What?

834
00:51:23,455 --> 00:51:24,331
Please?

835
00:51:25,165 --> 00:51:27,125
Goodness. Well…

836
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:30,212
You tell her.

837
00:51:30,879 --> 00:51:31,880
What do you mean?

838
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:34,966
Tell Bo-mi yourself.

839
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:36,885
Tell her what?

840
00:51:36,968 --> 00:51:40,222
Tell her not to visit the KMA next week.

841
00:51:40,305 --> 00:51:41,848
You're busy.

842
00:51:43,809 --> 00:51:46,812
It's fine. She won't take up my time.

843
00:51:47,813 --> 00:51:50,857
We've always offered
that field trip program.

844
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:54,194
And it makes me happy to see her there.

845
00:51:55,153 --> 00:51:56,071
Not me.

846
00:51:57,572 --> 00:52:00,367
I don't want to see you and Bo-mi

847
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:02,244
at the KMA together.

848
00:52:33,441 --> 00:52:34,901
Why are you following me?

849
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:37,946
I'll help you get a cab. It's hot out.

850
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:40,448
Goodness.

851
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:42,909
Back in the day,

852
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:46,788
it never got this sweltering.

853
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:51,334
But the weather now is similar
to how people are these days.

854
00:52:51,418 --> 00:52:53,169
It's mercilessly hot.

855
00:52:54,546 --> 00:52:56,965
Despite that,
everyone works hard in this heat.

856
00:52:57,048 --> 00:52:58,258
They're all incredible.

857
00:52:58,967 --> 00:53:01,052
Incredible, my foot. They're merciless.

858
00:53:01,136 --> 00:53:04,806
But you need to be merciless and tough
to survive in this dog-eat-dog world.

859
00:53:06,558 --> 00:53:07,601
Was I that harsh?

860
00:53:07,684 --> 00:53:09,811
No, ma'am. That's not what I meant.

861
00:53:11,479 --> 00:53:12,647
Just forecast accurately.

862
00:53:12,731 --> 00:53:15,108
We're trying our best.

863
00:53:16,484 --> 00:53:17,903
Unbelievable.

864
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:21,698
Oh, right. Ma'am.

865
00:53:21,781 --> 00:53:25,660
Don't worry too much about Director Jin.
She was probably in a fit of anger.

866
00:53:25,744 --> 00:53:29,205
The decision to never get married

867
00:53:29,289 --> 00:53:31,416
is never made overnight.

868
00:53:34,961 --> 00:53:37,756
No one knows her better than I do.

869
00:53:39,299 --> 00:53:42,385
She's not the type to say
such a thing in a fit of anger.

870
00:53:45,764 --> 00:53:48,183
Maybe I pushed her over the edge.

871
00:54:24,469 --> 00:54:26,262
She took a cab.

872
00:54:32,602 --> 00:54:34,479
She's a bit peculiar, isn't she?

873
00:54:38,441 --> 00:54:39,275
A bit.

874
00:54:41,277 --> 00:54:42,779
Actually, a lot.

875
00:54:44,572 --> 00:54:46,491
They're all like that
with their daughters.

876
00:54:47,075 --> 00:54:49,869
If you knew that,
why did you say that to her?

877
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:51,162
Say what?

878
00:54:52,455 --> 00:54:53,665
About not getting married.

879
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:57,961
I heard it's pretty shocking to hear
when you're on the receiving end.

880
00:54:58,044 --> 00:55:00,088
I know you didn't mean it,
but that was wrong.

881
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:02,048
I did mean it.

882
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:07,095
I'm seriously debating.

883
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:11,433
I agree with you. Dating with marriage
in mind can feel suffocating.

884
00:55:11,516 --> 00:55:14,686
And I don't want us
to be a burden to each other.

885
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:26,614
I'm tired. Let's go to bed.

886
00:56:35,517 --> 00:56:38,269
Due to the high temperature and humidity
of the North Pacific's anticyclone,

887
00:56:38,353 --> 00:56:40,647
the highest daytime temperature
will be 32°C.

888
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:43,608
And the tropical nights will continue.

889
00:56:43,691 --> 00:56:46,861
Here's the issue.
Due to the ongoing tropical nights,

890
00:56:46,945 --> 00:56:48,822
people will become exhausted.

891
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:51,866
This will lead to lack of focus
at work and more accidents.

892
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:53,368
If you look at the chart…

893
00:56:57,330 --> 00:56:58,957
The Administrator wants to see you.

894
00:57:00,959 --> 00:57:01,960
Why?

895
00:57:02,669 --> 00:57:04,295
We're having a meeting. Tell me.

896
00:57:19,018 --> 00:57:20,228
Director Jin.

897
00:57:20,979 --> 00:57:22,397
Did you upload

898
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:25,275
incorrect information
on the portal site yesterday?

899
00:57:30,071 --> 00:57:31,406
Yes, it was very brief.

900
00:57:31,906 --> 00:57:33,950
We corrected it right away.

901
00:57:40,582 --> 00:57:41,791
And you're telling me now?

902
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:45,879
You should have reported it
to me right away!

903
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:52,010
We're labeled as "erroneous" and "liars."
And now what? "Faulty"?

904
00:57:53,887 --> 00:57:55,263
What have you done?

905
00:57:55,763 --> 00:57:58,016
MUNMIN DAILY
INCORRECT INFORMATION ON PORTAL SITE

906
00:58:01,519 --> 00:58:02,854
Good grief.

907
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:06,941
-Where is the Administrator?
-He's in his office.

908
00:58:07,692 --> 00:58:08,735
Goodness.

909
00:58:10,069 --> 00:58:11,112
Hello, sir.

910
00:58:12,071 --> 00:58:13,239
Yes, sir.

911
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:15,325
May I look at that?

912
00:58:19,662 --> 00:58:21,748
MUNMIN DAILY
INCORRECT INFORMATION ON PORTAL SITE

913
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:26,002
Damn it. When did they see this?

914
00:58:40,683 --> 00:58:42,936
Those reporters are all insane!

915
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,647
Did they seriously write
an article about this?

916
00:58:46,231 --> 00:58:47,607
We're not machines.

917
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:49,859
It's not like we always make mistakes.

918
00:58:52,737 --> 00:58:54,405
I mean, this was a first.

919
00:58:54,489 --> 00:58:56,282
How could they nitpick about this?

920
00:59:04,499 --> 00:59:06,876
But why is a society journalist here?

921
00:59:07,502 --> 00:59:09,212
And why is Reporter Chae with him?

922
00:59:14,717 --> 00:59:15,552
Come on.

923
00:59:16,135 --> 00:59:18,638
He didn't steal it.
I just chose not to write about it.

924
00:59:21,516 --> 00:59:22,642
I mean…

925
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:25,436
If the media nitpicks
about such trivial issues,

926
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:27,564
how will these people work?

927
00:59:28,147 --> 00:59:29,691
Yes. Of course.

928
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:34,737
Thank you for understanding.

929
00:59:35,446 --> 00:59:36,406
Okay.

930
00:59:37,865 --> 00:59:39,033
Goodbye.

931
00:59:49,752 --> 00:59:51,170
We need to talk.

932
01:00:03,933 --> 01:00:05,018
What's this about?

933
01:00:06,144 --> 01:00:08,479
The incorrect information
on the portal site.

934
01:00:08,563 --> 01:00:10,023
You told him, didn't you?

935
01:00:10,815 --> 01:00:11,899
It wasn't me.

936
01:00:11,983 --> 01:00:13,318
I already saw everything.

937
01:00:13,401 --> 01:00:16,362
I saw you chatting
with that guy, Butcher Heo.

938
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:17,655
It wasn't me.

939
01:00:17,739 --> 01:00:19,198
What's wrong with you?

940
01:00:20,408 --> 01:00:21,951
You've been here for a while,

941
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:23,620
so you know how things are.

942
01:00:23,703 --> 01:00:25,204
Couldn't you have turned a blind eye?

943
01:00:25,288 --> 01:00:26,331
How about you guys?

944
01:00:26,414 --> 01:00:28,041
Don't you make typos?

945
01:00:30,752 --> 01:00:32,045
You're not interested

946
01:00:33,087 --> 01:00:35,256
in hearing me out, are you?

947
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:36,507
Why bother

948
01:00:37,008 --> 01:00:38,843
when you're always denying everything?

949
01:00:42,347 --> 01:00:44,057
How did you even marry me?

950
01:00:44,891 --> 01:00:46,059
What?

951
01:00:46,142 --> 01:00:48,102
Why did you even marry me

952
01:00:48,186 --> 01:00:51,189
if you won't believe me
or even hear me out?

953
01:00:51,272 --> 01:00:54,484
Yu-jin, why are you suddenly
dragging us into this?

954
01:00:54,567 --> 01:00:56,194
I was talking about the article.

955
01:00:56,277 --> 01:00:58,946
And I'm talking
about the trust between us.

956
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:02,367
Seeing how much you're doubting me,

957
01:01:02,450 --> 01:01:04,285
I should be worried

958
01:01:04,369 --> 01:01:07,288
not just as a journalist
but also as your wife.

959
01:01:09,082 --> 01:01:10,208
Am I wrong?

960
01:01:15,797 --> 01:01:16,964
Director Jin.

961
01:01:17,799 --> 01:01:19,926
Why can't you manage your team properly?

962
01:01:20,927 --> 01:01:21,928
I'm sorry, sir.

963
01:01:22,011 --> 01:01:25,181
Why does this keep happening? Tell me.

964
01:01:25,264 --> 01:01:27,433
Your team is causing headaches
every single day.

965
01:01:28,434 --> 01:01:31,771
Do you think you'll be able to hold out

966
01:01:31,854 --> 01:01:33,773
during the disaster prevention period?

967
01:01:33,856 --> 01:01:34,691
Do you?

968
01:01:35,733 --> 01:01:37,360
If you can't, let me know.

969
01:01:37,443 --> 01:01:39,987
Then I'll send you more people
or come up with something.

970
01:01:40,071 --> 01:01:41,823
I'll work harder.

971
01:01:41,906 --> 01:01:44,200
Teamwork is crucial

972
01:01:44,283 --> 01:01:45,618
once the typhoon hits.

973
01:01:47,245 --> 01:01:48,579
Keep that in mind.

974
01:01:49,497 --> 01:01:51,290
Yes, sir. I'll keep that in mind.

975
01:01:51,374 --> 01:01:52,667
Go on.

976
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:55,211
Who will be going to Jeju Island?

977
01:01:55,837 --> 01:01:56,796
Sorry?

978
01:01:56,879 --> 01:01:59,799
The typhoon is slowly advancing.

979
01:01:59,882 --> 01:02:01,843
Someone needs to go to the typhoon center.

980
01:02:01,926 --> 01:02:04,887
-Have you not chosen someone yet?
-Not yet, sir.

981
01:02:19,068 --> 01:02:19,986
Oh, no.

982
01:02:25,074 --> 01:02:26,075
I'm sorry,

983
01:02:27,368 --> 01:02:29,245
but I need to go first.

984
01:02:30,371 --> 01:02:33,332
I need to pick up my kids.

985
01:02:34,375 --> 01:02:36,627
Sure. Go on. It's okay.

986
01:02:36,711 --> 01:02:37,962
Okay. Soo-jin.

987
01:02:38,045 --> 01:02:40,006
Could you update

988
01:02:40,089 --> 01:02:42,175
Assistant Director Cho for me?

989
01:02:42,258 --> 01:02:44,218
I'll deliver important details via phone.

990
01:02:44,302 --> 01:02:46,012
Okay. I'll do that.

991
01:02:46,888 --> 01:02:48,264
Thank you.

992
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:59,025
I can't believe she left

993
01:02:59,734 --> 01:03:01,819
when Director Jin is getting an earful.

994
01:03:02,403 --> 01:03:04,280
She was the one who made the mistake,

995
01:03:04,363 --> 01:03:06,866
but Director Jin chose not to report it.

996
01:03:12,497 --> 01:03:13,998
Where's Assistant Director Oh?

997
01:03:15,124 --> 01:03:16,375
She just left.

998
01:03:17,543 --> 01:03:20,213
She had to pick up her kids,
so I told her to go first.

999
01:03:22,048 --> 01:03:24,008
It's already time.

1000
01:03:24,592 --> 01:03:26,093
You should all go home.

1001
01:03:26,177 --> 01:03:27,303
-Okay.
-Okay.

1002
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:49,534
Pick someone and tell them right away.

1003
01:03:49,617 --> 01:03:52,078
They will have to be there
for at least two months.

1004
01:04:47,174 --> 01:04:48,342
Is something wrong?

1005
01:04:49,385 --> 01:04:50,386
What?

1006
01:04:50,970 --> 01:04:52,096
No. Why?

1007
01:04:52,179 --> 01:04:54,348
There seems to be something
on your mind ever since you talked

1008
01:04:54,432 --> 01:04:55,725
to the Director General.

1009
01:04:56,642 --> 01:04:58,895
Oh, it's because of the typhoon center.

1010
01:05:00,646 --> 01:05:02,607
Soon, it'll be typhoon season.

1011
01:05:02,690 --> 01:05:05,776
Someone from our team
needs to go to Jeju Island.

1012
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:07,236
I see.

1013
01:05:14,744 --> 01:05:15,745
Can you go?

1014
01:05:20,124 --> 01:05:21,542
You should go, Forecaster Lee.

1015
01:05:39,644 --> 01:05:41,228
Let's spend some time apart.

1016
01:05:44,523 --> 01:05:46,442
What are you talking about?

1017
01:05:49,236 --> 01:05:50,613
I want some time apart.

1018
01:05:52,406 --> 01:05:54,408
I think that's best for both of us.

1019
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:56,577
Yu-jin.

1020
01:05:56,661 --> 01:05:59,038
We need some time to think.

1021
01:05:59,121 --> 01:06:01,207
Let's evaluate our relationship.

1022
01:06:03,167 --> 01:06:05,544
Be honest. You need some time alone too.

1023
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:17,264
Do you mean that?

1024
01:06:18,432 --> 01:06:20,685
I'm never half-hearted
when it comes to work.

1025
01:06:26,482 --> 01:06:27,858
That means

1026
01:06:28,776 --> 01:06:30,945
you've already made up your mind.

1027
01:06:32,863 --> 01:06:35,116
Yes. If it's all right with you.

1028
01:06:47,712 --> 01:06:48,963
Is this because

1029
01:06:49,672 --> 01:06:51,590
of what happened today?

1030
01:06:52,258 --> 01:06:55,094
Anyone would have
misunderstood that situation.

1031
01:06:55,177 --> 01:06:56,887
You would have been mad if you were me.

1032
01:06:56,971 --> 01:06:58,222
No.

1033
01:06:58,305 --> 01:07:00,641
I would have heard
your side of the story first.

1034
01:07:03,644 --> 01:07:04,895
Okay. So?

1035
01:07:05,563 --> 01:07:07,398
You're really going to leave?

1036
01:07:07,481 --> 01:07:09,191
I want to breathe.

1037
01:07:09,275 --> 01:07:11,485
Whenever I see you frown at home,

1038
01:07:11,569 --> 01:07:13,279
I wonder if it's because of me again.

1039
01:07:13,362 --> 01:07:14,989
Do you know how suffocating it is?

1040
01:07:15,823 --> 01:07:17,742
I never suffocated you.

1041
01:07:17,825 --> 01:07:20,786
You're doing it right now.
You can't understand me.

1042
01:07:22,204 --> 01:07:25,374
Do you know how frustrating
and suffocating that is?

1043
01:07:26,292 --> 01:07:28,419
Can you say that you understand me?

1044
01:07:29,962 --> 01:07:33,466
I abandoned a relationship of ten years
because I wanted to marry you.

1045
01:07:33,549 --> 01:07:36,010
Can you please stop telling me
about how you left her?

1046
01:07:37,595 --> 01:07:39,513
Can you please stop?

1047
01:07:39,597 --> 01:07:42,099
I only said that
because you didn't think I loved you.

1048
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:45,102
That's why you won't register our marriage
and are worried about the future.

1049
01:07:45,186 --> 01:07:46,520
Exactly!

1050
01:07:47,938 --> 01:07:51,108
So can we please have
some alone time and think about this?

1051
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:55,738
Let's figure out
what's best for both of us.

1052
01:08:07,958 --> 01:08:11,128
On such nights, we become lost in thought.

1053
01:08:18,094 --> 01:08:20,179
Ha-kyung doesn't sincerely date anyone

1054
01:08:20,262 --> 01:08:22,056
if they're not a marriage prospect.

1055
01:08:22,139 --> 01:08:23,891
You knew that, right?

1056
01:08:24,475 --> 01:08:26,185
If it's not marriage,

1057
01:08:26,268 --> 01:08:28,729
what could be

1058
01:08:29,438 --> 01:08:30,815
awaiting us at the end?

1059
01:08:37,822 --> 01:08:41,867
When that happens,
we end up having complicated feelings

1060
01:08:42,701 --> 01:08:44,078
and that leads

1061
01:08:45,204 --> 01:08:46,831
to more thoughts.

1062
01:08:48,124 --> 01:08:49,208
And eventually,

1063
01:08:50,709 --> 01:08:52,545
we become even more lost in thought.

1064
01:09:28,998 --> 01:09:33,627
In this way,
our sleepless tropical night wore on.

1065
01:10:03,824 --> 01:10:05,201
If you leave like this,

1066
01:10:05,284 --> 01:10:06,702
it's really over between us.

1067
01:10:06,785 --> 01:10:08,412
Have you thought about that?

1068
01:10:08,495 --> 01:10:09,622
Who's going to the typhoon center?

1069
01:10:09,705 --> 01:10:10,664
I'm going.

1070
01:10:10,748 --> 01:10:12,291
I know you want to draw clear lines

1071
01:10:12,374 --> 01:10:14,126
between the KMA, me, work, and dating.

1072
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:17,504
You compare me to him every time,
and it really bothers me.

1073
01:10:17,588 --> 01:10:20,007
I want things to work out between us.

1074
01:10:20,090 --> 01:10:23,177
Why do you keep confusing me?

1075
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:27,848
Help! A student is down on the floor!

1076
01:10:28,474 --> 01:10:29,642
What? An accident?

1077
01:10:30,517 --> 01:10:31,852
Lee Si-woo.

1078
01:10:31,936 --> 01:10:33,437
He works at the KMA.

1079
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:39,151
