1
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,840
After two months of upgrades and renovations,

2
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,840
our Hot News House

3
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,400
has finally reopened.

4
00:01:15,039 --> 00:01:15,840
That's great!

5
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:17,960
Great, great!

6
00:01:18,039 --> 00:01:18,640
Now,

7
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:22,039
the romantic status of Princess Qianqiu of Huiyin

8
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,920
can be described as mysterious and confusing.

9
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,200
We will use the latest on-site tracking technology

10
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,000
to provide real-time updates for everyone.

11
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,920
Speaking of Princess Qianqiu and General Qin,

12
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,800
for the past two months,

13
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,320
they

14
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,320
haven't had a single bit of news.

15
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,300
Everyone thought they were going through a relationship crisis.

16
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,479
At yesterday's sacrificial ceremony,

17
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:49,210
they rang the bell together to dispel the rumors.

18
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:50,880
But who would have thought that now,

19
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,740
the second prince of Beiyu, Kang Hena, has arrived.

20
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,920
And it seems

21
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,800
he has a past relationship with Princess Qianqiu.

22
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,440
Princess,

23
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,570
good afternoon.

24
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,240
Good, good, good.

25
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:28,520
Esteemed Second Prince of Beiyu,

26
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,720
what brings you here?

27
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,280
Of course I'm here to accompany you.

28
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,500
The Lord of Huiyin said yesterday

29
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,120
that you should show me around for a day.

30
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,860
I heard that today is your Huiyin Lantern Festival.

31
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,820
Let's go to the city together and take a look.

32
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,610
What's so fun about the Lantern Festival?

33
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,120
Come on,

34
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,600
let's go.

35
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,940
I didn't expect the Second Prince to have this side.

36
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,440
Sister,

37
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,880
my feelings for you are genuine.

38
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,020
If you don't want to accompany me,

39
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,800
then I'll stay here with you.

40
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,680
I already have plans.

41
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,340
Second Prince, please leave.

42
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:41,880
Brother Che,

43
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,280
happy fake third anniversary to us.

44
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,520
Look.

45
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:57,970
He has been here.

46
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:02,640
Sister,

47
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,840
Where are you going? Second Prince, please stay.

48
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,170
The princess needs to change her clothes.

49
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,220
The situation is about to change.

50
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,000
Qin Che.

51
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,640
Qin Che.

52
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,700
Goodbye, esteemed guest.

53
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,159
Come.

54
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:44,020
Let me tell you.

55
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,740
Do it like this in a moment.

56
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,020
Do you understand?

57
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:51,610
Go ahead.

58
00:05:56,159 --> 00:05:59,960
I heard the flying birds have been startled awake.

59
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:04,480
Love lingers, the two remain as before.

60
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,760
In Qin's time, old acquaintances finally meet.

61
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,520
Kid,

62
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,920
Who told you to recite it like that?

63
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,200
Are you Qin Che?

64
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:13,800
Yes, I am.

65
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,240
It was a beautiful lady.

66
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,210
She said she's waiting for you at the usual place.

67
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:19,770
Alright.

68
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:26,800
In Qin's time, old acquaintances finally meet.

69
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,760
Che Guang.

70
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,650
How did you get here?

71
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:44,690
General,

72
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,450
I've finally found you.

73
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,640
We've discovered traces of those Northern Isle rebels outside the city.

74
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,970
Let's hurry over there.

75
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,210
You go first.

76
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,370
I have some matters to attend to. I'll catch up later.

77
00:06:57,159 --> 00:06:57,690
Alright.

78
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,000
Princess,

79
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:14,880
Princess,

80
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:16,640
Princess.

81
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,250
You say Qin Che fled with guilt?

82
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,640
Yes, sister.

83
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,560
I sent people to wait at his residence all night.

84
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,690
they didn't see him.

85
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,200
His whereabouts can't be found in the entire city.

86
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,280
He must have known

87
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,200
I've found evidence that he killed Liu Yue.

88
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,540
That's why he ran away.

89
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,560
Qin Che killed Liu Yue?

90
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,740
Second Prince,

91
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,850
don't speak nonsense here.

92
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,200
It was

93
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,080
my alibi for Qin Che back then.

94
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,080
Now he's about to become

95
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,540
the consort of our Huiyin.

96
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,360
Rumors are frightening.

97
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,320
Sister, you've been deceived by him.

98
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,280
I carefully searched that night,

99
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,480
the study where Lord Liuyue was killed.

100
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,200
I found under the desk chair

101
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,520
a very thin strand of golden thread.

102
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:33,159
The same thread was on the clothes Qin Che wore that night.

103
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,919
You want to convict based on this thread alone?

104
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:39,940
Second Prince,

105
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,080
aren't you being too frivolous?

106
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,640
Of course not.

107
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,160
I've reviewed your files from that day.

108
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,680
I found that both of you were drunk that night.

109
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,440
Sister, are you certain

110
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,840
that you were with Qin Che the entire evening

111
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,100
and completely sober?

112
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:54,840
I.

113
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,480
This is from my sister's room,

114
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,600
scraped from under the incense burner.

115
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,200
There are still some remnants of the confusing incense.

116
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,400
How dare you, Qin Che!

117
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:12,960
You dare to use Qianqiu to harm the envoy from Beiyu,

118
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,960
and still have the audacity to flee!

119
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,920
From now on,

120
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,240
cancel his marriage to Qianqiu.

121
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,320
Arrest him immediately!

122
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,040
Father,

123
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,040
So this is the good husband you found?

124
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,480
This matter is now clear.

125
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,280
Don't make things worse.

126
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,080
Father,

127
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:48,840
Sister,

128
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,640
I'm sorry I didn't tell you about this earlier,

129
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,400
but you should know

130
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,880
I'm doing this for your own good.

131
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,720
This Qin Che is not a good person.

132
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,840
He harbors ill intentions.

133
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,280
He's only getting close to you to use you.

134
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,080
Stop talking.

135
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,520
Father,

136
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,130
please give me three more days.

137
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,760
Right now, all we have is evidence that's hard to verify.

138
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,690
It's not enough.

139
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,040
Father,

140
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,160
Lord Ma,

141
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,610
besides the case of Lord Liuyue's murder,

142
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,600
I have another matter I'd like to discuss with you.

143
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,420
Please speak, Second Prince.

144
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,800
I've fallen in love with Princess Qianqiu at first sight.

145
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,260
I humbly request, Lord Ma,

146
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,320
to betroth Princess Qianqiu to me.

147
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,120
Our two cities

148
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,130
shouldn't become enemies over someone like Qin Che.

149
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,000
No.

150
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,570
Regarding the matter of marriage,

151
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,850
it still depends on Qianqiu's wishes.

152
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,770
If it can foster goodwill between our two countries,

153
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,840
I do hope the Second Prince

154
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,720
after investigating the details of this case,

155
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,040
I will then pass judgment on Qin Che.

156
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,800
I can agree to this marriage,

157
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,440
but regarding Qin Che's matter,

158
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,000
you

159
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,640
must also keep your word.

160
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,810
Your daughter takes her leave.

161
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,120
In my opinion,

162
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,400
Princess Qianqiu

163
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,440
has been with General Qin for so long.

164
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,720
Princess Qianqiu will surely choose General Qin,

165
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,320
right?

166
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,160
Big news!

167
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,200
Big news!

168
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,580
General Qin is wanted for murder.

169
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,560
Princess Qianqiu is about to marry the second prince of Beiyu.

170
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,400
What?

171
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,920
Is that true?

172
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,460
How come I didn't know about this?

173
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,720
Mother.

174
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,560
So early in the morning,

175
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,040
what brings you here?

176
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,490
I want to use that favor.

177
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,450
Can you help me find Qin Che?

178
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,800
If even the city lord can't find him,

179
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,500
how could I possibly find him?

180
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:26,140
Please, Mother, send more people to search for him.

181
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,600
If you find him,

182
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,140
please tell him

183
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,200
to run far away.

184
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,680
I heard you're going to marry Kang Hena.

185
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:48,200
You went through so much trouble to avoid the political marriage before,

186
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,640
why are you now agreeing to it for Qin Che?

187
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,640
Because I want to.

188
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,900
Good morning, sister.

189
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,800
Sister,

190
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,370
we'll be getting married in a few days.

191
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,320
How can you be so cold towards me?

192
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,760
What do you mean, getting married in a few days?

193
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,090
Don't you know, sister?

194
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,090
This morning, Lord Ma has arranged our marriage.

195
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:36,580
It's set for the fourth day of the seventh month, an auspicious day for weddings.

196
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,620
But today is already the 28th.

197
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,000
It is a bit rushed,

198
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,130
but when we return to Beiyu,

199
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,320
I will certainly give you, sister,

200
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,250
an even grander wedding ceremony.

201
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,640
Sister, please don't tire yourself out these days.

202
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,700
I'll go ahead and make preparations.

203
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:07,760
Princess,

204
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,720
why don't we escape?

205
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,660
Fang Jue has disappeared too.

206
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,480
Xiao Liu,

207
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,280
tell me,

208
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,810
where could he have escaped to?

209
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,800
General Qin has no one to rely on in Huiyin.

210
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,800
If we're talking about the closest person to him,

211
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,530
it would only be you, Princess.

212
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,280
He couldn't have left Huiyin, could he?

213
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,720
The closest person is me.

214
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,360
Home.

215
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,840
I know where he went.

216
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:15,920

217
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:16,580
