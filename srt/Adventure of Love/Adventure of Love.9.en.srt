1
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,800
However, we can use magic to defeat magic.

2
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:15,560
Magic?

3
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,560
I can't understand a word the princess is saying.

4
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,520
To put it simply,

5
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,640
it means fighting fire with fire.

6
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,800
As long as we manage it for long enough

7
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,400
and make it convincing enough,

8
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,460
we can turn solo fans into group fans.

9
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,039
So now,

10
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,680
we need to start by cultivating group fans.

11
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,400
Group?

12
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,259
Do you two understand?

13
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,920
The princess is saying things we don't understand again.

14
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,360
First,

15
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,020
romance is essential.

16
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,120
Things that represent love

17
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,020
can't be missed, not even one.

18
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:58,560
For example?

19
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,410
The most classic one

20
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,980
is, of course, sending birthday wishes right at midnight.

21
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,680
My birthday is still three months away.

22
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,120
Then various anniversaries.

23
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,050
I'll make one up.

24
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:18,880
Three.

25
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,240
Che.

26
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,800
Happy third anniversary to us.

27
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,280
Second,

28
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,320
keep promoting, promoting, and promoting again.

29
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,280
I should mention you, mention you everywhere, all the time,

30
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,540
and mention you again.

31
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,280
That would be quite annoying.

32
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,200
Annoyed?

33
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,120
That's the ultimate art of flaunting our love.

34
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,200
This beef is quite tender,

35
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,760
but it's still not as delicious as

36
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,640
the roast chicken you made for me a few days ago.

37
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,000
Che.

38
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,360
Nankang City has sent a painting.

39
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,400
Let's all appreciate it.

40
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,560
It's quite beautiful indeed.

41
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,280
But it's still not as beautiful as the one I made with Che.

42
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,740
The plum blossom painting we made together is more beautiful.

43
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,520
The plum blossom painting is beautiful.

44
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,800
This kind of weather

45
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,850
seems a bit hot, doesn't it?

46
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,200
It is hot indeed.

47
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,140
But it's nothing compared to Che.

48
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:10,440
Che's sincere love for me is even hotter.

49
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,120
Che, are you alright?

50
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,519
Here, wipe it all on my clothes.

51
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,399
wipe it all on my clothes.

52
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,600
Come on, are you okay?

53
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,250
It's good that you're fine.

54
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,120
Third.

55
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,120
That is, the most important love story.

56
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,159
those previous stories about how we met,

57
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:39,640
blah blah blah,

58
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,900
you already remember them very clearly.

59
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,360
so now,

60
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,680
I'm going to start adding some details.

61
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,280
The sweet details are the most deadly,

62
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,690
the most addictive.

63
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,840
Details.

64
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:54,720
Okay,

65
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,320
I've already had some people write

66
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,280
about our garden strolls

67
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,080
and amusing anecdotes of our daily interactions.

68
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,080
I've also had them spread around.

69
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,370
Look at this one:

70
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,480
'That dark night,

71
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,960
you'll never know

72
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,280
how proactive General Qin was.'

73
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,040
Oh my god, General Qin really...

74
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,400
I'm crying my eyes out.

75
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,040
And this one:

76
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,500
'How much longer until I can hold your hand?'

77
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,320
The million cries from General Qin.

78
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,400
I didn't expect

79
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,320
General Qin and the Princess

80
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,200
to be so intense in private.

81
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,720
Did you guys imagine this?

82
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,760
No, not at all.

83
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,040
This is amazing!

84
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,600
Three, two, one.

85
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,480
Che.

86
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,040
Happy fake third anniversary to us.

87
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,200
Look.

88
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,160
Firefly star lights.

89
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,880
Firefly star lights.

90
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,560
Look, firefly star lights.

91
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,800
Twinkling.

92
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,720
Symbolizing eternal hope.

93
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,240
What do you think?

94
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,560
You must be moved by this kind of sentiment too, right?

95
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:27,840
Perhaps.

96
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,340
There were fireworks on the day we first met too.

97
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,640
First met?

98
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,640
I mean,

99
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,370
the day I planned to escape.

100
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,340
I made it up on the spot.

101
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:48,960
You see,

102
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,760
this is what details are.

103
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,600
I can guarantee you

104
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,880
there will definitely be a large number of

105
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,540
people appearing to support our relationship.

106
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,760
It's my first time doing

107
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,360
something so romantic.

108
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,960
Remember to dress nicely tomorrow.

109
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,700
Isn't this good-looking enough?

110
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,740
Never mind, I'll prepare something for you.

111
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:34,159
Thank you.

112
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,299
Looks good, right?

113
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,980
You've never seen this before, have you?

114
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,000
Black-skinned, pure-hearted athletic mutt.

115
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,530
White looks good on you too.

116
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,120
Really?

117
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,080
General,

118
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:08,560
why does this white make you look even darker?

119
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,250
I need to change.

120
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:18,880
It's too late.

121
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,490
Let's go.

122
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:31,840
Princess, we've come to see you.

123
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,000
Alright, alright, alright.

124
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,600
Everyone,

125
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,240
I know you all have

126
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,080
many questions you want to ask.

127
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:39,840
Next,

128
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,640
our Princess and General

129
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,240
will answer them one by one.

130
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,760
Okay.

131
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,520
Okay.

132
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,440
You there, ask your question first.

133
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,320
Princess, may I ask,

134
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,880
have you set a date for the wedding?

135
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,480
The Lantern Festival is approaching.

136
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:56,600
Will it affect the selection of the sacrificial candidate?

137
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,640
Good question about the wedding date.

138
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,360
General Qin and I are very willing

139
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,040
to share our happiness with everyone.

140
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,480
So as soon as we have good news,

141
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,920
we will announce it

142
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,780
to everyone immediately.

143
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,480
As for the Lantern Festival,

144
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,680
we'll leave a little surprise for now.

145
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,160
Alright, alright, alright.

146
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,120
There are many rumors about your relationship.

147
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,880
What's the truth?

148
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,940
The history of our relationship,

149
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,320
is like this.

150
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,160
When we first met,

151
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,040
we were happily stargazing on the roof.

152
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:29,400
Accidentally,

153
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:29,920
I fell off the roof.

154
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,640
Since then, I fell in love with him.

155
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,040
I think he's so handsome.

156
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:35,960
Have some tea.

157
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,400
Anyway,

158
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,120
thank you.

159
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,240
In short,

160
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,480
that's our story.

161
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,080
If there's any good news in the future,

162
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:51,000
we'll share it with everyone when we have the chance.

163
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,560
Okay.

164
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,530
Alright.

165
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,040
Make way, make way!

166
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,080
Make way, make way!

167
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,140
Get away, get away!

168
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:58,760
Make way!

169
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,520
Why is he here?

170
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,360
Princess,

171
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,560
I've loved you for sixteen whole years.

172
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,160
You are such a noble goddess.

173
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,560
How can you marry such a lowly person?

174
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,200
Marry the Lord of Beiyu City!

175
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,840
is the most correct choice.

176
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,300
Enough.

177
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,640
I won't allow you to slander my beloved like this.

178
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,440
Besides,

179
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,840
the goddess is nothing more than a mythical legend.

180
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,100
I can't give up my rights as a human being.

181
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,450
Is your love so selfish?

182
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,280
Yes,

183
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:27,960
exactly.

184
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:28,400
Yes,

185
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,520
it's too selfish.

186
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,000
But, but you're not real at all.

187
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,400
I have evidence to prove it.

188
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,320
The day you pledged your love is fake.

189
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,440
Because on that day,

190
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,760
the princess had never even met Qin Che.

191
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,360
How do you know whether I've seen him or not?

192
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,160
That's right.

193
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:48,760
Exactly.

194
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,840
He's not wrong.

195
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,760
He admitted it.

196
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,200
Look and listen.

197
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,300
We indeed didn't meet that night.

198
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,000
What?

199
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,400
It was I, Qin Che, who confessed to the princess too abruptly.

200
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,600
She got angry with me.

201
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,600
I could only accompany her silently.

202
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,440
It was I, Qin Che, who secretly loved the princess.

203
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,810
I could only express my feelings through paintings.

204
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:18,890
Alright.

205
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,140
By a stroke of fate,

206
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,360
when I learned

207
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,600
that the Princess also had feelings for me,

208
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,570
I couldn't sleep a wink that night.

209
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,160
It's all fake. It's all fake.

210
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,440
Fake.

211
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,400
Give it to me.

212
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,000
Princess.

213
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:39,640
Let go of me.

214
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,520
Don't be afraid, Princess. I'm here to protect you.

215
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,250
Give it to me.

216
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,120
My lord, my lord.

217
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,440
Let go of me. Are you alright, my lord?

218
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,480
It's fake. It's all fake.

219
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,960
It seems my recent guidance has been quite effective.

220
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:17,440
Otherwise, how could you be so cooperative today?

221
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:29,810
General,

222
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,140
This is Ma Qianqiu.

223
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,480
So the person Qin Che truly likes

224
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,620
is actually the original Ma Qianqiu.

225
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,520
Xinjiang, Can,

226
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:43,520

227
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,040

229
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,120
Bo Jun,

230
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:47,720
Zhuang Cheng,

231
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,520
Zhuang Cheng,

232
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:50,920
Jin Sheng,

233
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,720
Dan Wei, Ping Ling,

234
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,650
Miao An, Hao Wang, Tao Rui, Kai Qingyu,

235

Lu Ling.

236
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:21,880
Lu Ling.

237
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,160
Lu Ling.
