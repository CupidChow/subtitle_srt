1
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:42,960
Although spring has arrived,

2
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,620
you can still catch a cold if you're not careful.

3
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,690
I remember when I first met you,

4
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:55,160
Xiao Liu said you were very fierce.

5
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,050
No one dared to get close to you.

6
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,120
I'm starting to doubt

7
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:01,210
if the person I see before me now

8
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,480
is the same one

9
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,920
I've heard about.

10
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,880
When you first met me?

11
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,560
You haven't really lost your memory, have you?

12
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,220
I misspoke.

13
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,400
By the way,

14
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,440
how did you find me?

15
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,120
I followed the horse tracks to find you.

16
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,760
Didn't I tell you

17
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,820
to at least have Xiao Liu with you?

18
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,120
You shouldn't be alone.

19
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,680
Speaking of which, where's Xiao Liu?

20
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,560
How is she?

21
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,280
Xiao Liu is quite clever.

22
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,800
Fang Jue found her

23
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,880
and has already sent her back to the royal city.

24
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:00,760
However,

25
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,160
I guess I won't be able to be

26
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,480
the goddess for the Lantern Festival anymore, right?

27
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,280
That's right.

28
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:09,720
It's okay.

29
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,320
I didn't really want to be it anyway.

30
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,440
By the way,

31
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,600
I have something more important

32
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,600
to tell you right now.

33
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,240
General,

34
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,360
General, we've found out

35
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,040
that those who kidnapped the princess

36
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,360
were indeed the escaped soldiers from Beiyu.

37
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,840
They wanted to kidnap the princess to threaten us.

38
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,700
Where are they?

39
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,320
I have failed in my duty, sir.

40
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,480
When I led the men to eliminate them,

41
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,810
they were already gone.

42
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,600
But there were signs of a struggle at the scene.

43
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,200
They might have been taken away by someone with ulterior motives.

44
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,800
The envoys from Beiyu will be here in a few days.

45
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,680
We can't afford any complications during this time.

46
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,010
Increase the manpower.

47
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,930
Don't leave a single one alive.

48
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,360
When are we sending the princess back?

49
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,649
What's the situation with Ma Yangfei?

50
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,650
People lost hair in ancient times too.

51
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:33,900
The princess needs a few more days to recover. We'll discuss it later.

52
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,080
General,

53
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,040
don't forget our plan

54
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,930
and the purpose of getting close to the princess.

55
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,890
Get some rest early.

56
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,900
Everything is fine in the royal city.

57
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,010
Your wounds still need a few more days to heal.

58
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,480
How about...

59
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,640
How about we stay here for a couple more days?

60
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,880
I think the air here is quite nice.

61
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,280
Yeah.

62
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,280
it's pretty good.

63
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,660
Let's stargaze together.

64
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,160
What's the point of stargazing?

65
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,800
This vast sea of stars...

66
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,640
...is my welcome gift to you.

67
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,280
Fireflies.

68
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:53,720
Look!

69
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,580
It's so beautiful.

70
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,000
Why is it still so cold?

71
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,080
These days of idleness...

72
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,520
I'm actually starting to miss the hot soup from Zui Chun Feng.

73
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,240
Then let's go now.

74
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:13,880
Alright.

75
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,050
Let's go.

76
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,560
Cheers.

77
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,240
It feels so good.

78
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:41,880
Qin Che.

79
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,400
If one day,

80
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,640
you find that you don't belong here,

81
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,740
but you don't know who you are,

82
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,240
what would you do?

83
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,960
I once thought I didn't belong here.

84
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,640
I was born without a father.

85
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,060
Everyone called me a bastard.

86
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,640
My mother often said,

87
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,570
'It would be better if I didn't exist.'

88
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,570
Later, my mother and I came to Huiyin City.

89
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,440
I thought everything would get better.

90
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,640
She wouldn't be in so much pain anymore.

91
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,920
But it didn't.

92
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,810
One day, she came out of the royal city,

93
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,740
covered in wounds.

94
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,240
She went completely insane.

95
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,000
From that day on,

96
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,040
I felt like every day I lived

97
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,320
was like being in hell,

98
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,700
unable to breathe.

99
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:42,720
Qin Che.

100
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,240
You are a living, breathing person.

101
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,020
with joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness.

102
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,040
with love,

103
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:55,920
and hate.

104
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,660
You know the warmth and cold of the four seasons.

105
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,880
You understand the gentleness of the sun and moon.

106
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:11,880
Princess,

107
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,600
every moment I spend with you,

108
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,360
I feel truly alive.

109
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:05,840
Princess,

110
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,010
the lady is furious.

111
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:11,320
Let the servants come to escort you back to the royal city.

112
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,360
You,

113
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,220
a noble princess like you,

114
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,120
how could you casually spend the night with a man?

115
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,360
That's my fiancé.

116
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,480
What about him being your fiancé?

117
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,810
You're not married yet.

118
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,090
Jealous, are we?

119
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,460
Don't change the subject.

120
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,160
You stood them up on the day of the competition,

121
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,680
allowing Ruofei to win without honor,

122
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,740
and making her the subject of gossip.

123
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,680
So what does Mother want?

124
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,800
A rematch.

125
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,840
I'd rather not.

126
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,480
The sacrificial ceremony is tomorrow.

127
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,800
At worst, I'll pay for a news article myself

128
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,060
to explain to everyone

129
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,160
that I wanted to withdraw on my own.

130
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:11,890
Will that do?

131
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,400
Qian Qiu.

132
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,280
You... you want to be the goddess.

133
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,240
No.

134
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,720
I don't want to be.

135
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,560
The daughter still has to face her father's scolding.

136
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,440
I'm very busy.

137
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,720
I'll be going now.

138
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,040
You want me to take the bullet for your daughter.

139
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,170
I'm not that stupid.

140
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:00,210
Later, send someone to paint green linglong on the chime bells.

141
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,100
Be careful.

142
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,130
Green linglong.

143
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,000
Xiao Liu.

144
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,080
Let me ask you.

145
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:16,800
Princess.

146
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,160
What is Green Linglong?

147
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:18,880
Princess.

148
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,520
Green Linglong is our Huiyin's

149
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,920
secret poison.

150
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,840
How come you were kidnapped once

151
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,500
and don't even remember this?

152
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,400
Is the poison very potent?

153
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,840
Of course it is.

154
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,320
This Green Linglong is colorless and odorless.

155
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,240
Just a tiny bit of contact with the skin,

156
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,520
and in less than an hour and a half,

157
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,200
a person will die of suffocation.

158
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,520
Moreover, this poison only reveals

159
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,200
its green color in boiling water.

160
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,930
It's very difficult to detect.

161
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,840
Then tomorrow, besides the Goddess,

162
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,280
who else can touch the chime bells?

163
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,240
The chime bells?

164
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,960
It should be General Qin.

165
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,800
This year, he's been specially permitted by the City Lord

166
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,480
to hand over the small hammer used for striking the bells.

167
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,340
Could it be that Ma Yangfei has murderous intentions towards Qin Che?

168
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,640
Is Ruofei ready?

169
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,840
Ruofei has a stomachache today,

170
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,600
I'm afraid she won't be able to come.

171
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,160
What?

172
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,000
What about the Goddess?

173
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,920
The Goddess has arrived.

174
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,290
She's so beautiful.

175
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,760
She's really stunning.

176
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,610
As expected of the Goddess.

177
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,170
Truly worthy of being called the Goddess.

178
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,080
Father,

179
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,760
Mother.

180
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,240
Xinjiang, Can.

181
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:16,840
Xinjiang.

182
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,000
Lei, Cai, Long, Yan, Peng, Song, Hui.

183
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,960
Lei, Cai, Long, Yan, Peng, Song, Hui.

184
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,360
Bo Jun.

185
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,640
Zhuangcheng.

186
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,360
Jin Sheng.

187
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,000
Jin Sheng.

188
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,940
Dan Wei, Ping Ling.
