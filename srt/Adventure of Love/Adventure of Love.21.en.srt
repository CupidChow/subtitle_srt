1
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:17,640
Princess.

2
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,170
Xiao Liu, is there any news about General Qin?

3
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,280
Princess, please eat something.

4
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,930
Don't harm your health.

5
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,080
It's all my fault.

6
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,920
otherwise, he wouldn't have been shot by an arrow.

7
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,380
let alone being poisoned.

8
00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:45,960
Princess, you've already done enough.

9
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,120
What if I get trapped when I go there?

10
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,570
then I won't even know your situation.

11
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,860
I won't know anything.

12
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,730
Don't worry.

13
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,690
Just send a message to Fang Jue.

14
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,240
We have a special way of communicating.

15
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,120
After I return to the royal city,

16
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,760
I will stay back at the mansion.

17
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,200
The most dangerous place is the safest.

18
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,520
Remember to be careful.

19
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,200
Rest assured.

20
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,130
General,

21
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,410
what the princess sent might be a trap.

22
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,050
How about I go in your place?

23
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,360
Tomorrow at noon, Zui Chun Feng.

24
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,360
If I don't go personally,

25
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,340
Kang He Na won't show his true colors.

26
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,460
If anything happens to me,

27
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,240
you must take good care of the princess.

28
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,370
Protect her safety.

29
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,240
Run!

30
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,820
Take care of yourself.

31
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,320
Princess.

32
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,600
General Qin is a good person, heaven will protect him.

33
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,930
He will be fine for sure.

34
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,040
Fang Jue.

35
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,019
Any news from Fang Jue?

36
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,440
I guess Kang Hena is keeping a close watch.

37
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,120
no news has come in yet.

38
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,520
I can't get any messages out either.

39
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,850
This world has gone mad.

40
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,060
A prince from another city

41
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,080
has taken control of our royal city.

42
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,840
This won't do.

43
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,680
I feel uneasy about this.

44
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,000
I need to find someone to secretly check on Qin Che.

45
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,159
Xiao Liu,

46
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,690
I'll need your cooperation later.

47
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,370
It hurts so much.

48
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,560
It's so painful.

49
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,320
Princess.

50
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,440
Princess, what's wrong? Princess.

51
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,570
Princess, are you alright? Princess.

52
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,320
Princess.

53
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,860
It hurts so much. Are you alright, Princess?

54
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:00,800
Princess.

55
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,720
It's so painful.

56
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,240
How are you, Princess?

57
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,720
It hurts so much.

58
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,520
Princess.

59
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,250
Are you alright, Princess?

60
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,290
It hurts so much.

61
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,680
Help me.

62
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,760
Alright, stop wailing.

63
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,100
I heard you insisted on me coming.

64
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,810
What do you want?

65
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,720
I want you to save Qin Che.

66
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,040
Consider it a favor I owe you.

67
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,400
What can you offer me?

68
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,400
Ruo Fei.

69
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:44,720
Haven't you for a long time

70
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,450
received any news from Ruo Fei?

71
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,570
I know you sent her away to protect her,

72
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,600
but you underestimated Kang Hena's ruthlessness.

73
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,460
If Qin Che hadn't arrived in time,

74
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,050
she would have already fallen into his hands.

75
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,810
Are you threatening me?

76
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,400
If you think this way,

77
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,130
if it means you can save Qin Che,

78
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,800
then consider this a threat.

79
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,280
I know Ruo Fei is pure and kind-hearted,

80
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,200
and I'm even more aware of how deep Kang He Na's schemes run.

81
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,400
That's why I've already had Qin Che

82
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,130
keep an eye on her whereabouts.

83
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,100
I just don't want more people to get hurt.

84
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:28,960
I've heard

85
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,000
that the poison Kang He Na gave to Qin Che

86
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,280
is extremely potent.

87
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,890
I may not be able to save him.

88
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,400
I believe you can.

89
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,120
The Dong Liu royal family is renowned for their medical skills.

90
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,120
I believe your people

91
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,000
would want to see you use these skills to save lives,

92
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,920
not take them.

93
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,840
I can save Qin Che,

94
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,320
but

95
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,890
I won't get involved in your conflict with Kang He Na.

96
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,520
I only want safety for Dong Liu and Ruo Fei.

97
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:12,840
Alright.

98
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,680
Is this medicine actually effective?

99
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,280
Why is the general's condition getting worse?

100
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,960
This poison is too potent.

101
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,090
I'm not sure either.

102
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:53,560
Madam,

103
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:16,880
Paper and pen.

104
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,250
This poison is indeed vicious.

105
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,600
If not treated promptly within two days,

106
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,730
he will die from blood vessel rupture.

107
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,679
Fortunately, the antidote herbs are not rare.

108
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,090
I have some in my palace.

109
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,039
First, gather these according to this list

110
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,500
to suppress the toxicity.

111
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:41,880
Later,

112
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,440
have Qin Che return with me to the royal city.

113
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,840
Return to the royal city?

114
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,960
Madam, do you know that my general is like this

115
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,760
because he was harmed by someone in the royal city?

116
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,160
So, do you want him to be discovered by others,

117
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:00,010
or let him come back with me for proper treatment?

118
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,600
If Ma Qianqiu hadn't begged me,

119
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,240
I certainly wouldn't have come.

120
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,020
It's not easy for me to come out like this.

121
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,000
Alright.

122
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,440
Stop pasting! Stop pasting!

123
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,440
Get out!

124
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:05,920
Xiao Liu.

125
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,000
Princess.

126
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:08,920
I told them not to paste,

127
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,580
but they insisted on doing it.

128
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,640
How long until the wedding?

129
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,920
It's tomorrow.

130
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,650
It's been two days already.

131
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,800
I wonder how Qin Che is doing.

132
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,720
Let them be.

133
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,660
He's awake.

134
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,850
Looks like my medicine wasn't wasted.

135
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,920
Why am I here with you?

136
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,480
Ma Qianqiu made a deal with me.

137
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,880
She had you brought here.

138
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,580
Does she know how unreliable your promises are?

139
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,440
Just one word from Kang Hena,

140
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,040
and you advanced Ma Yangfei's illness onset.

141
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,960
It's utterly foolish.

142
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,280
Say what you will,

143
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,720
but

144
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,100
compared to Kang Hena,

145
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,360
I trust you even less now.

146
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,760
Easily blinded by love.

147
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,360
If Kang Hena hadn't interfered,

148
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,760
I thought you were going to

149
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,160
abandon your revenge plan with Ma Qianqiu.

150
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,480
What's the situation in the city now?

151
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,360
How is Qianqiu?

152
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:42,680
See?

153
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,340
What did I tell you?

154
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,260
Ma Qianqiu is doing just fine.

155
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,440
However,

156
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,080
she's marrying Kang Hena tomorrow.

157
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,640
Perfect.

158
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,560
You can stay here comfortably.

159
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,960
It'll be convenient for our plan tomorrow.

160
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,410
How long has this embroidered ball been here?

161
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,260
The embroidered ball?

162
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,880
It's been about three days, I think.

163
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,200
The people in the flower room don't know what's going on.

164
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,720
They've been sending embroidered balls these days.

165
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,480
I'm tired of seeing them.

166
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,610
Where are you going?

167
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,600
I'm going to find Qianqiu.

168
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,640
Are you crazy?

169
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:31,180
Kang Hena's people are everywhere outside now.

170
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,060
We just managed to rescue you.

171
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,980
Can't it wait a little longer?

172
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,280
It can't.

173
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,400
She's waiting for me.

174
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,800
Qin Che, oh Qin Che.

175
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,000
What's wrong with you, you Black Rakshasa?

176
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,260
And you call me stupid.

177
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,180
Couldn't you have waited until dark?

178
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,560
Put it down.

179
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,440
Go close the door.

180
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,170
Alright.

181
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,840
General Qin,

182
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,040
I'm back.

183
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,530
I thought you were going to die.

184
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,560
Xinjiang, Can.

185
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,160
Xinjiang.

186
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:23,800
Lei, Cai, Long, Yan, Peng, Song, Hui.

187
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,860
Lei, Cai, Long, Yan, Peng, Song, Hui.

188
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,200
