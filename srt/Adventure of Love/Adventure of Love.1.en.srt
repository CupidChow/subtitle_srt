1
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,890
I have admired General Qin for a long time.

2
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,600
Why not become my trusted advisor?

3
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,729
Princess, please be careful with your words.

4
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,120
Isn't that right?

5
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,200
General Qin,

6
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,720
if you can be my stepmother's dog,

7
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,440
why can't you be mine?

8
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,760
Princess, only your death would give me a reason to rebel.

9
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,500
The sun sets behind the western mountains, darkening the sky.

10
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,680
A vast expanse appears at the edge of the clouds.

11
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,600
Gathering from the earth, gazing at the sky, moving in a chain.

12
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,320
Coming to welcome the goddess.

13
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,210
The goddess dies suddenly.

14
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,320
This is a great omen of disaster.

15
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,120
Heaven's punishment descends.

16
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,970
The goddess ascends to heaven.

17
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,220
All because of Ma Yangfei's tyranny.

18
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,570
we must execute him.

19
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,560
only then can we prove our righteousness to heaven.

20
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,960
Restore peace to Huiyin.

21
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,400
Restore peace to Huiyin.

22
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,640
Ma Yangfei.

23
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:28,040
Today, I shall have my revenge.

24
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,260
Go and kill that woman.

25
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,520
This bastard Qin Che will be at my disposal from now on.

26
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,160
General,

27
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,560
we've fallen into a trap.

28
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,940
Even you want to betray me?

29
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,680
Ma Yangfei.

30
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,200
You are cruel and tyrannical by nature.

31
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,600
You killed my mother and ruined my life.

32
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,880
If there is an afterlife,

33
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,079
I will surely

34
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,400
crush your bones and scatter your ashes.

35
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,800
Who is this man?

36
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,560
What's with this sudden ancient costume I'm wearing?

37
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,400
And what's going on here?

38
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,000
Princess,

39
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,680
didn't we agree to meet tonight?

40
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,680
Why have you come to find me early?

41
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,680
I was about to ask you the same thing.

42
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,960
Maybe it's because

43
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,730
I missed you.

44
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,400
Princess,

45
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,040
would you like this servant to come in and help you change?

46
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,320
Yes, yes, that would be fine.

47
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,640
Princess,

48
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,340
after tonight's blessing ceremony,

49
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,420
you won't be in such pain anymore.

50
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:41,800
Princess!

51
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,600
Princess, are you alright? Princess!

52
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,200
Princess?

53
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,000
Princess!

54
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,490
Princess, are you alright? Princess!

55
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,690
Princess, have I traveled back in time to ancient times?

56
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:19,760
Princess.

57
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,000
Princess.

58
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,600
Princess.

59
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,400
Princess.

60
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,600
Princess.

61
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,800
It seems I've taken on the original owner's identity.

62
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,880
So that flashback just now...

63
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,700
...was the original owner's memory.

64
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,130
So I've arrived just before the original owner's death.

65
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,680
Then according to the plot development...

66
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,560
...that means...

67
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,650
...I'm going to die.

68
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,000
Princess, stop running!

69
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:03,640
Princess!

70
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:05,840
Princess!

71
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,640
Princess, stop running!

72
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,880
You bunch of useless fools!

73
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,140
You can't even handle such a simple task.

74
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,120
Madam! Madam!

75
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,320
Ma Qianqiu.

76
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,090
What are you doing here?

77
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,240
The blessing ceremony is approaching.

78
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,000
yet you're still running around wildly.

79
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,460
Guards!

80
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,159
Take the princess back to her chambers.

81
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:34,420
Keep a close eye on her.

82
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,020
Don't move!

83
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,280
I won't go!

84
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,490
Why should I?

85
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:39,400
I...

86
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,500
I am the Divine Maiden!

87
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,159
Divine Maiden or not,

88
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,960
I am your mother.

89
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,120
Don't you understand respect for your elders?

90
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,600
Mother...

91
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,330
Madam...

92
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,480
Princess Ruofei is waiting for you.

93
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:00,640
Fine.

94
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,660
You are the Divine Maiden,

95
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,900
but don't forget that.

96
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,140
Your responsibility.

97
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:12,880
Princess.

98
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:13,880
Princess.

99
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,280
Let's go back.

100
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,940
Ma Yangfei didn't suspect anything, did he?

101
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,580
The Divine Lady of Huiyin.

102
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,370
inheriting the will of heaven.

103
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:38,020
She is the faith of the people of Huiyin City.

104
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,280
All these years,

105
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,120
Ma Yangfei has been using the Divine Lady

106
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,980
to divert the people's attention

107
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,160
and cover up his tyranny.

108
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,200
If during the blessing ceremony,

109
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,720
the Divine Lady suddenly dies,

110
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,520
we can use it as heaven's will

111
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,680
to eliminate Ma Yangfei.

112
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,520
Tonight,

113
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,840
Ma Yangfei must die.

114
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,960
There's no escape.

115
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,890
How can I escape the original owner's fate of certain death?

116
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:28,720
Wait,

117
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,120
the space I'm in now

118
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,520
is different from the original owner's memory of being killed.

119
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,120
So there's still hope for me.

120
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:34,840
Princess,

121
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,800
why do you have General Qin's miniature portrait on you?

122
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,560
When I helped you change clothes today,

123
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,520
I didn't see it.

124
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,360
What thing?

125
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,360
It's not mine.

126
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,080
Wait.

127
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,120
Who are you talking about?

128
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,400
General Qin Che.

129
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,450
Look, aren't the eyes and brows exactly the same?

130
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,200
It's Mu Wan's.

131
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,820
They're having an affair.

132
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,640
Isn't he with you, Princess?

133
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,620
What does it have to do with me?

134
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,760
These days,

135
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,840
General Qin has been secretly coming to see you.

136
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,280
you always send me away.

137
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,680
To be honest, I'm terrified of that dark demon.

138
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,080
Did he do anything to you?

139
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,120
Princess,

140
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,120
do you know?

141
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,730
There are rumors saying

142
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:26,080
General Qin is an evil spirit that crawled up from hell.

143
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,840
I don't care if he's evil or not.

144
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,920
The problem now is

145
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,360
My mother and I...

146
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,080
No,

147
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,040
my mother and my lover are together.

148
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,580
Isn't this incest?

149
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,320
Actually,

150
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,900
the madam is not your biological mother.

151
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,020
So she's a stepmother.

152
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,850
That's why they want to kill me.

153
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,850
And they want to kill my father too.

154
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,640
So it's a love-motivated murder to seize power and take over the city.

155
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,760
What, what should I do?

156
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,280
I...

157
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,320
Princess.

158
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,280
The auspicious time is approaching.

159
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,840
Madam is calling you to change your clothes.

160
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,760
Princess,

161
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,050
This is where the original owner died.

162
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:46,880
I still came.

163
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,080
Princess,

164
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,720
General Qin has arrived.

165
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:55,880
Qin Che.

166
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,400
So it was you who killed the original owner.

167
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,570
Since some things are bound to happen,

168
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,960
there's no reason for me to hide.

169
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:04,720
Xiao Liu,

170
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,040
you can go out first.

171
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:06,640
Yes.

172
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,460
The blessing ceremony is about to begin.

173
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,490
I have come specifically to escort the Princess.

174
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,700
Where are you escorting me to?

175
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,860
To a blessing ceremony or to the path to the underworld?

176
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,290
What do you mean, Princess?

177
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,600
Are you having second thoughts?

178
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,280
No.

179
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,040
I just think we don't need to

180
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,800
solve the problem in such a cruel way.

181
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,680
I can beg my father

182
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,880
to release you and the City Lord's wife.

183
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,160
Release us?

184
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,410
Just with your plea?

185
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:01,920
We need to trick him.

186
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,760
Actually,

187
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,330
he's known about you and Mu Wan for a while.

188
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:09,840
That's why

189
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,920
I came to find you today.

190
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,120
