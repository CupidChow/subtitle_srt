1
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,440
According to informed sources,

2
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,680
our Princess Qianqiu

3
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,650
has been suffering from halitosis for ten years.

4
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,560
I would like to take this opportunity to urge everyone

5
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,890
to take this as a warning

6
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,850
and pay attention to oral hygiene.

7
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:37,880
Princess,

8
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:41,800
What?

9
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,840
I can't believe I forgot about this.

10
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,960
I can't take it anymore.

11
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,690
They think I'm a pushover if I don't show my teeth.

12
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,400
I must have a serious talk with Ma Yangfei.

13
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,000
Princess,

14
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,140
how do you know it's the City Lord?

15
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,280
The public opinion in the entire Huiyin City,

16
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,140
who else but him could control it?

17
00:01:59,360 --> 00:01:59,890
Let's go.

18
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,880
Father, what do you mean?

19
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:28,200
I'd like to ask,

20
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,000
what does my beloved daughter mean?

21
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,290
Do you know, daughter, that building a tall tower

22
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,720
requires laying it brick by brick,

23
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,800
but it can collapse in an instant?

24
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,320
Father,

25
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,560
are you blaming me for exposing the goddess's lie?

26
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,160
My daughter has grown up,

27
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,050
and I can no longer control her.

28
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,850
Do you know that your father

29
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,760
has painstakingly worked for you for over a decade?

30
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,120
Yet you are so foolish.

31
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,579
There's still room for maneuver now,

32
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,320
but if you continue like this,

33
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:40,880
I'm afraid you'll be left with nothing but regret.

34
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,480
Ma Qianqiu.

35
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,000
Think it through.

36
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,240
You're nothing without me.

37
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,480
If anything goes wrong,

38
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,220
I won't be there to clean up your mess.

39
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,279
Ma Yangfei has completely dropped his act.

40
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,279
Should I discuss this with Qin Che?

41
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,520
But I...

42
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,480
Princess,

43
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,480
Look.

44
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,480
Isn't that Ping'er?

45
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,920
What is she doing?

46
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:38,970
You know her?

47
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,340
From my palace?

48
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,360
Ma Yangfei couldn't be...

49
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,159
up to something again, could he?

50
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:50,650
Xiao Liu,

51
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:51,810
let's go.

52
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,340
Take them away.

53
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:02,760
Speak.

54
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,320
Princess, you're wronging me!

55
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,840
Please let this servant explain.

56
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,240
Now we've caught you red-handed.

57
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,640
You still dare to deny it?

58
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,000
Were you sent by someone to spy on me?

59
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,300
To report back to them?

60
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,160
No.

61
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,800
It's not like that, Princess.

62
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,660
The evidence is right here. Will you confess or not?

63
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,290
You won't talk, huh?

64
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,600
Fine, let's see what we have here.

65
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,740
What are all these?

66
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,440
Just... just this?

67
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,600
This is what you've been sneaking around for?

68
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,200
Princess, please spare this servant.

69
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,659
I won't dare to do it again.

70
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,159
The Princess has the kindest heart.

71
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:39,640
explain your reasons in detail.

72
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,640
Perhaps the Princess will forgive you.

73
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,760
Actually, it's all for my child.

74
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,280
Child?

75
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,700
My husband passed away early.

76
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,280
My family could barely make ends meet.

77
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,880
I had to beg for a job inside the royal city.

78
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:56,640
These are all the allowances I've saved up.

79
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,760
I was hoping to find someone to take it out,

80
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,890
to send to my family.

81
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:06,520
Princess, I believe Ping'er is telling the truth.

82
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,440
she's usually very honest,

83
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,890
and the most frugal one.

84
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,130
You may rise.

85
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,640
Thank you, Princess.

86
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,850
Where is your child now?

87
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,040
I'll have Xiao Liu send some silver over tomorrow.

88
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,920
It's not easy for a woman to survive.

89
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,250
I admire your strength.

90
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,280
I won't blame you.

91
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,400
If you have any difficulties in the future,

92
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,600
just mention my name.

93
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,480
Thank you, Princess.

94
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,680
Thank you, Princess.

95
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,760
Thank you, Princess.

96
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,490
You may rise.

97
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,490
Xiao Liu.

98
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,520
Wait.

99
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,240
City Lord.

100
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,300
The thief is this maid right here.

101
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,360
Take her away.

102
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:53,720
Yes, sir.

103
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,320
It's not me, it's not me!

104
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,080
Princess!

105
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,000
What are you doing?

106
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,360
Princess, save me!

107
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,490
She's not the thief.

108
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,640
Princess, Princess!

109
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,000
Princess, Princess, save me!

110
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,010
What's going on?

111
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,800
This woman is a habitual offender who steals and sells royal treasures.

112
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,330
Now that she's been caught,

113
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,240
she's just making up excuses

114
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,360
to gain your sympathy.

115
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:15,920
Qianqiu,

116
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,880
you've been raised too naively by your father.

117
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,780
You're too quick to trust others.

118
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,800
Isn't that right, General Qin?

119
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,330
It's good that General Qin is here.

120
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,620
My daughter, Qianqiu,

121
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,800
has been naive since childhood.

122
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,560
You are now her fiancé.

123
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,520
You should teach her

124
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,920
about the treachery of human nature

125
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,000
and how to assess situations.

126
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:49,800
Yes.

127
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,560
Recently, there has been a wave of thefts in the royal city

128
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,040
and a trend of illicit trading.

129
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,680
We just caught one.

130
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,600
Ping'er didn't steal anything.

131
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,160
Enough.

132
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,800
Whether she stole or not,

133
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,320
General Qin will naturally investigate thoroughly.

134
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,600
General Qin despises thieves the most,

135
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:08,820
doesn't he?

136
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:14,680
Very well.

137
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:21,800
I'll leave this case entirely in General Qin's hands to investigate.

138
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,020
We're about to become family.

139
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,049
You won't disappoint me, will you?

140
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,010
I won't disappoint you, City Lord.

141
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,040
Ping'er is innocent.

142
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,080
I can see it in her eyes.

143
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,600
She's not the type to commit crimes.

144
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,930
You must clear her name.

145
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,450
Are you alright?

146
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:00,920
I'm fine.

147
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,400
You must save her.

148
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:04,880
Xiao Liu,

149
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,320
take the Princess for a walk.

150
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,290
Princess, let's go downstairs first. Princess,

151
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:10,920
Princess.

152
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,180
You must save Ping'er.

153
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,600
Qin Che, come out here!

154
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,680
General, the general is busy.

155
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,280
Princess,

156
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,340
is this what you call busy?

157
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,280
What's going on with Ping'er?

158
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,540
Why did you force a confession out of her?

159
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,400
I've already been to the prison to see her.

160
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,240
That Ping'er,

161
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,360
she's been beaten beyond recognition.

162
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,050
Is this how you want me to trust you?

163
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,440
When she committed the crime of theft,

164
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,900
she should have known she would be punished.

165
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,920
Judging the goodness or evil of a person

166
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,580
is based on their actions,

167
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,360
not on who is weaker.

168
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,200
First of all,

169
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,480
you don't have any evidence

170
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,320
to prove that Ping'er stole anything.

171
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,120
How can you talk about conviction and punishment?

172
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,160
Moreover,

173
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,080
I'm asking why you're abusing your power,

174
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,280
using torture to extract a confession.

175
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,920
He painted the original Ma Qianqiu.

176
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,360
Qin Che,

177
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,560
you were the one who invited me to conspire with you.

178
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,560
Now you're helping Ma Yangfei

179
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,480
to frame an innocent person.

180
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,160
I really doubt now

181
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,840
which one of you I'm seeing

182
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,080
is the real you.

183
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,740
Which of your actions are truly sincere?

184
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,800
The real me?

185
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,420
I don't even know which one is the real me.

186
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,500
We're just using each other, that's all.

187
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,820
Is it necessary to understand so deeply?

188
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,360
