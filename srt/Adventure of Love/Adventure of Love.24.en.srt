1
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,320
Number 0598.

2
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,440
Exchange your points and Piao Piao coins.

3
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,840
This will give you three days.

4
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,440
You will remain in World 332.

5
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,700
Once the time is up,

6
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,940
the Management Bureau will automatically recall you.

7
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,330
Qian Qiu.

8
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,370
Qian Qiu.

9
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:51,930
Qian Qiu.

10
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,730
It's been three months.

11
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,660
You're finally awake.

12
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,079
Madam.

13
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,079
Madam.

14
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,010
May I ask you something?

15
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,000
How do I get to the Hot News House?

16
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,560
Why are you asking about the Hot News House?

17
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,360
I'm here to seek refuge with my relatives.

18
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,360
I heard that if you get on that Hot News list,

19
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,920
everyone will be able to see my message.

20
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,780
This is the Hot News House.

21
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,200
Madam, please don't tease me.

22
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,280
I heard that Hot News House is quite lively.

23
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,360
That's ancient history now.

24
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,280
Xiao Ba,

25
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,480
take this lady to the government office.

26
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:22,920
Alright.

27
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,520
Help her find her relatives.

28
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,440
Okay, thank you.

29
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,360
I heard that Lady Qianqiu has finally awakened.

30
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,000
The city lord's wait wasn't in vain after all.

31
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,920
Yes, indeed.

32
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:36,210
I've watched their journey all along.

33
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,220
Back in the day,

34
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,500
those little articles were all the rage.

35
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,920
Just one more small bite, just one.

36
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,480
I heard that Ruofei took Muwan back to Dongliu.

37
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:55,600
Yes.

38
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,160
Ma Ruofei seems to have grown up overnight.

39
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,800
She learned martial arts from Fang Jue.

40
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,200
Now she's managing Dongliu City very well.

41
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,170
She was already well-taught by Mu Wan.

42
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,090
That's really good.

43
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,490
General Qin,

44
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:18,959
no.

45
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,200
City Lord.

46
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,890
Under your governance, Huiyin has now

47
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,920
become truly wonderful.

48
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:31,800
Qianqiu,

49
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,650
are you still upset with me?

50
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,820
Can I explain everything to you clearly now?

51
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:48,760
Qin Che.

52
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,880
I know your heart beats too.

53
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,360
So,

54
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,200
all that talk of using or deceiving

55
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,400
doesn't matter anymore.

56
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,580
I just want to know now,

57
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,480
you do love me, don't you?

58
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:11,880
I love you,

59
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:13,760
Qianqiu.

60
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,160
You pulled me out of an endless abyss.

61
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,640
Without you,

62
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,010
I might still be trying everything

63
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,680
to get revenge on Ma Yangfei and the City Lord of Beiyu.

64
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,160
But after meeting you,

65
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,300
I don't want to be trapped in those obsessions anymore.

66
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,520
I want to be with you

67
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,100
to govern Huiyin City better.

68
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,200
I want to be with you

69
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,210
to live a simple,

70
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,240
ordinary,

71
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,520
and happy life.

72
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,240
Qin Che, fireworks.

73
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,450
Is it beautiful?

74
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,000
Qianqiu,

75
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,520
today marks

76
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,730
three hundred and thirty-one days since we fell in love.

77
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,100
You actually remembered.

78
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,180
Of course I did.

79
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,220
You gave me a vast sea of stars,

80
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,130
and I give you a sky full of brilliance.

81
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,760
You said back then that someone was watching us.

82
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,000
Was that a lie too?

83
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,360
You guess.

84
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,160
Qin Che.

85
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,400
Deceiving me.

86
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:26,920
It's snowing.

87
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,720
Shouldn't we

88
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,520
go to Zui Chun Feng for a meal now?

89
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,700
What are you doing?

90
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,640
Let's go.

91
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,650
It's about time.

92
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,800
Let's go home.

93
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,680
Look, it's already dawn.

94
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,160
I don't want to leave.

95
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,800
I don't want to go.

96
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,530
You don't want to leave.

97
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,260
where don't you want to go?

98
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,680
I don't know.

99
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,880
Maybe it's the bustling modern world.

100
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,920
Or perhaps...

101
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:32,610
...the ancient times with high walls and grand courtyards.

102
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,860
Qin Che, do you believe...

103
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,960
...I can become anyone?

104
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,640
However,

105
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,240
I can no longer be Ma Qianqiu.

106
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,640
I...

107
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,840
...am Number 0598.

108
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,920
I am Number 0598.

109
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,440
You are Number 0598.

110
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,240
I've spent all my points and Piaopiao coins...

111
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,080
...to come here.

112
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,400
Qin Che,

113
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,120
we only have three days left.

114
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,080
Guess who I am.

115
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,770
How did you move all the flowers from the royal city here?

116
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:02,920
From now on,

117
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,640
this is our home.

118
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:15,880
Let me see.

119
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,400
Twenty points.

120
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,920
Are you trying to anger me to death?

121
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,520
You dare to make me sign this?

122
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,040
What's going on?

123
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,900
So what if the grades are a bit low?

124
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,860
Don't get angry and hit the child.

125
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:25,520
Look.

126
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,440
Twenty points.

127
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,280
I'll teach you a lesson.

128
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:31,640
Father!

129
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,240
Don't run!

130
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,360
Father, don't hit me!

131
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,160
Mother!

132
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,320
Father!

133
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,680
Let me catch you!

134
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,180
Father, Mother is eating with her hands!

135
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,170
Do you want some?

136
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,210
Here, have some.

137
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,360
If I wake up tomorrow...

138
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,420
...and I've disappeared,

139
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,650
what will you do?

140
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,360
Then I will definitely find you.

141
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,340
if I can't find you,

142
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,920
I will wait for you to come back forever.

143
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,380
What I said at the restaurant yesterday,

144
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,560
you heard it all, didn't you?

145
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,210
Then why didn't you ask me about it?

146
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,220
We promised each other

147
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,200
to be honest with each other.

148
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,220
If you don't want to talk about it,

149
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,880
I won't ask you.

150
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:03,960
Actually,

151
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,880
I don't belong to this world.

152
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:12,020
We have a Piaopiao Management Bureau there.

153
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,560
I finally became one of them

154
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,130
and got a number.

155
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,520
But I still felt very lonely.

156
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,480
They called me Number 0598.

157
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,800
Only when I was sent to another world

158
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,160
to carry out a mission,

159
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,800
could I have my own name.

160
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,410
For example,

161
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,600
Ma Qianqiu.

162
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,400
Every time I go to a world,

163
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,000
I have a mission.

164
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,930
I must try to get close to the target person

165
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,660
and complete the mission.

166
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,160
Only then can I earn Piaopiao coins and points,

167
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,600
and have the right to choose worlds.

168
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,730
But this time, due to the operator's mistake,

169
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,160
I forgot everything when I came here.

170
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,290
But because of this,

171
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,300
for the first time,

172
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,640
I truly fell in love with someone

173
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,490
and wanted to grow old with him.

174
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,560
But by coincidence, I completed the mission.

175
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,340
I can no longer stay in this world.

176
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,560
Will you disappear then?

177
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,640
Or will only your soul leave?

178
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:57,680
I don't know.

179
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,160
Because before,

180
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,960
I was always eager to leave here.

181
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,720
I never paid attention to

182
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,100
what it would be like afterwards.

183
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,720
Then promise me,

184
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,040
don't forget me.

185
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,260
Don't forget everything that happened between us.

186
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,600
Okay?

187
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,840
Xin Jiang Di Can

188
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,000
Lei Cai Long Yan Peng Song Hui

189
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:21,930
Bo Jun

190
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:22,290
