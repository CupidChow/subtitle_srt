1
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,120
Father.

2
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,640
Mother.

3
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,360
I thought for a moment.

4
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,680
I can agree to your request.

5
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,080
I'll take Ma Ruofei's place as the goddess.

6
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:22,880
However,

7
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,320
you owe me a favor.

8
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,760
Ruofei is naive.

9
00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:31,170
We can't let her be taken advantage of.

10
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:32,680
Alright.

11
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,039
Consider it a favor I owe you.

12
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,060
Since you insist on being star-crossed lovers,

13
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,160
don't blame me for showing no mercy.

14
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,600
Those who refuse to obey

15
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,410
are of no use to keep around.

16
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,440
Now that Qianqiu is here,

17
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,330
you can play the chime bells together with Qin Che

18
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,440
to pray for everyone's blessings.

19
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,759
Your harmonious music

20
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,120
will make for a beautiful story.

21
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,780
I will obey all orders from the City Lord.

22
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,040
Che.

23
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,850
Don't go there. The chime bells are poisoned.

24
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,400
I'm sorry.

25
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,730
I couldn't help it. I couldn't help it.

26
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,920
Alright, alright.

27
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,880
It's time. Let's begin quickly.

28
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,860
I told you not to strike it.

29
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:57,960
Trust me.

30
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,320
Okay.

31
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,940
Why did nothing happen when the green bell was touched?

32
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:23,800
Good.

33
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,160
That's wonderful.

34
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,920
It's really great. She's truly beautiful inside and out.

35
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,640
Exactly.

36
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,960
Not only is she beautiful, but she also has a kind heart.

37
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,760
That's right.

38
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,240
That's great.

39
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,480
I'm tired.

40
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,200
I'll go back and rest now.

41
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,040
Alright, alright.

42
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,160
They truly are a perfect match.

43
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,220
Congratulations.

44
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,320
It's so beautiful.

45
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,600
A match made in heaven.

46
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,600
They're so well-suited for each other.

47
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,680
That old bastard Ma Yangfei.

48
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,480
If you hadn't discovered something amiss at the sacrificial site today,

49
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,080
and had someone replace the poisoned chimes in advance,

50
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,680
the Princess would have been in danger.

51
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,920
It's my duty to do so.

52
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,800
However, the Northern Isle rebels from before

53
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,260
still haven't been found.

54
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,200
The City Lord's hasty move against the General,

55
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:40,120
could it be that he discovered something when he took those people away?

56
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:40,640
No.

57
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,250
if he had discovered anything,

58
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,960
he would have made a move against me long ago.

59
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:49,560
Today's incident wouldn't have been resolved so easily either.

60
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,800
It's because the people from Northern Isle are about to arrive.

61
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,130
He doesn't want to cause any more trouble.

62
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,520
So he's using me to threaten the Princess,

63
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,580
to make her serve his purposes again.

64
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,080
I see.

65
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,000
Only the City Lord has the antidote for Green Linglong.

66
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,600
If the General is truly poisoned,

67
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,800
he can use this to control the Princess.

68
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,580
A new rainy season is approaching again.

69
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,530
The royal city is about to see a change.

70
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,000
General,

71
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,720
I know you have special feelings for the Princess,

72
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,240
but I must advise you to keep your distance from her.

73
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,280
After all, she is the City Lord's daughter.

74
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,200
What we plan and scheme for,

75
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,920
she may not be able to accept all of it.

76
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,400
We can't let so many years of effort

77
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:41,720
be ruined in an instant.

78
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,320
Enough.

79
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,320
I understand.

80
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,960
Qin Che, it's about to rain.

81
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,020
Come here quickly.

82
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:19,680
Come here.

83
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:24,610
Come on over.

84
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,400
Come here.

85
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,160
Qin Che, come here quickly!

86
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,740
come here quickly!

87
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,610
How could I resist approaching

88
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,760
her in such a state?

89
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,280
Qin Che.

90
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,280
Just for a moment.

91
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,040
just for a moment.

92
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,360
It'll only take a moment.

93
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,520
Princess, Princess,

94
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,640
why are you staring at me?

95
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,320
It's nothing.

96
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:20,920
It's so hot.

97
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,800
are you hot?

98
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:25,700
Not hot.

99
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,560
Aren't you tired today, Princess?

100
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,760
Why did you come here?

101
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,010
Not tired at all.

102
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,520
However,

103
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,440
don't you want to know

104
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,400
why I suddenly became a goddess?

105
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,400
I heard Ma Yangfei

106
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,680
wanted to poison you through the chime bells.

107
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,480
That's why I thought of finding a chance to sabotage it.

108
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,600
How about that? I'm clever, aren't I?

109
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,160
If you were really smart,

110
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,370
you would have come to me first.

111
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:02,300
If Fang Jue hadn't discovered it in time, it would have been terrible.

112
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,560
It's just that time was too tight,

113
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,640
I couldn't get out.

114
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,010
If you want to find me in the future,

115
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,360
just put a hydrangea by the window,

116
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,360
and I will appear.

117
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,200
Alright.

118
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,000
However,

119
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,240
I came to see you today

120
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,560
because I actually have something important to discuss.

121
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,760
Before the ceremony,

122
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,560
I didn't have a chance to tell you

123
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,640
that it was actually people from Beiyu who kidnapped me that day.

124
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:00,840
Moreover,

125
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,800
they kept muttering

126
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,840
about taking me to make a deal.

127
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,480
Qin Che, in your opinion,

128
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,820
do you think it has anything to do with

129
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,650
Ma Yangfei and the Beiyu envoy?

130
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,000
I'm not sure.

131
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:19,920
It's okay.

132
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,240
We'll deal with it as it comes.

133
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,060
When I meet the Beiyu envoy tomorrow,

134
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,720
I'll try to find out more.

135
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,220
The Beiyu envoy will arrive in Huiyin tomorrow.

136
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,280
The news just reached Ma Yangfei today.

137
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,400
After the ceremony,

138
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,320
he assigned me the task

139
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,930
of hosting the Beiyu envoy.

140
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,080
I don't know what he's planning.

141
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,200
This time,

142
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,160
I'm telling you in advance.

143
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,560
Qin Che,

144
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,520
what were you thinking just now?

145
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,820
Now look what happened, you've caught a cold, haven't you?

146
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,080
You're a martial artist,

147
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,610
how can your constitution be worse than mine?

148
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,240
No, no,

149
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,660
I need to ask Xiao Liu to brew some ginger tea.

150
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,120
Are you a devil?

151
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,530
Your nagging is so terrifying.

152
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,900
I wonder who will marry you in the future.

153
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,880
My fiancé

154
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,040
is right in front of me, isn't he?

155
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,140
Princess, it's getting late.

156
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,980
Let me escort you back to rest.

157
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:12,960
Alright.

158
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,560
How did you sleep last night?

159
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,200
Not bad.

160
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,700
Your hair is messy. Let me comb it for you.

161
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,840
Princess, please go back now.

162
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,240
It's fine. Let me comb it.

163
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,970
You really can't stay still for a moment, can you?

164
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,600
The envoy from Beiyu is here for an audience.

165
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,240
Kang Hena, the envoy from Beiyu, pays respects to the Lord of Huiyin.

166
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,280
Greetings to the Princess of Huiyin.

167
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,080
Aren't you...

168
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,760
Sister, we meet again.

169
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,120
Kang Hena.

170
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,050
Second Prince of Beiyu.

171
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:39,640
I came specifically to investigate the case of Liu Yue's murder.

172
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,770
Lord of Huiyin City,

173
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,800
there's no rush with Liu Yue's case.

174
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,600
My father and I

175
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,720
both trust the people of Huiyin.

176
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,480
It's just that the ministers below

177
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,320
sent me here out of caution.

178
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,160
Since you've made the effort to come,

179
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,760
we will ensure our guests are fully satisfied.

180
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,200
I have already made arrangements.

181
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,280
Let our Huiyin's

182
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,680
most esteemed Princess Qianqiu

183
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,560
I'll take you sightseeing.

184
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,200
Me?

185
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,240
I don't want to.

186
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,120
Then I thank the Lord of Huiyin.
