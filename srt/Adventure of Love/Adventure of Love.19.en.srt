1
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:10,640
Qin Che.

2
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:14,520
Qin Che.

3
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:19,960
Princess.

4
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,700
Xiao Liu, why are you here?

5
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,330
Where's Qin Che?

6
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,039
Princess.

7
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,760
General Qin asked me to give you this letter.

8
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,970
Princess, please wait.

9
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:44,920
My father is ill.

10
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,520
I should be by his side taking care of him.

11
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,780
Why won't you let me in?

12
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:48,960
Could it be...

13
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,200
Is there something to hide in there?

14
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,400
Princess, you're being too harsh.

15
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,080
It was the City Lord who ordered that no one should enter.

16
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,160
This old servant is merely following orders.

17
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,620
Princess, please return.

18
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,320
Princess.

19
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,440
Come here.

20
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,600
What are you doing?

21
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:07,680
Father.

22
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,039
Your daughter has come to attend to your illness.

23
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:09,360
Father.

24
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,639
I really can't go in, can I?

25
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,360
Father.

26
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,930
Qianqiu has finally decided to come back.

27
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,240
However, the city lord is still angry.

28
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,120
You'd better go back for now.

29
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,040
Then please, Mother, tell me first,

30
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,760
why Father, who has always been in good health,

31
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,820
suddenly fell ill.

32
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,440
What exactly is he suffering from?

33
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:35,040
Sister is indeed beautiful and kind-hearted.

34
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,480
However, matters like medical consultations

35
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,440
should be left to the court physicians.

36
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,760
Sister, you only need to focus

37
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,690
on preparing well for the wedding.

38
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,370
Mother truly has her heart set on Beiyu, doesn't she?

39
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57,600
I merely made the right choice.

40
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,080
Xiao Yun,

41
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:03,680
Yes?

42
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,840
escort the princess back to her chambers.

43
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,800
Prepare well,

44
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,200
and don't come out before the wedding.

45
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,660
I fear it's too dangerous.

46
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,130
I can walk by myself.

47
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,440
It's exactly as Qin Che thought.

48
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,680
Kang Hena

49
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,200
deceived Ma Yangfei,

50
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,840
controlled Qin Che and me,

51
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,760
then turned around and collaborated with Mu Wan,

52
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,560
gained control over Ma Yangfei.

53
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,770
If General Qin had already anticipated this,

54
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,040
why did you come back, Princess?

55
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,880
Don't tell me you're really going to marry that Kang Hena.

56
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,090
How could that be possible?

57
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,360
What I said to Fang Jue,

58
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,330
you heard it all.

59
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,800
So now you know

60
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,610
I just wanted to use you to seize power.

61
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,360
Do you still want to stay?

62
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,320
Qin Che,

63
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,180
actually, I'm just like Fang Jue.

64
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,580
I also wanted you to sincerely

65
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,200
really feel

66
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,940
what kind of feelings you have for me.

67
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,300
Speaking of using people,

68
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,320
at the very beginning,

69
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,080
I only wanted to use you to escape the arranged marriage.

70
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,120
It's just that I'm not as clever as you,

71
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,120
nor am I as good at deceiving myself.

72
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,480
It tells me

73
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,760
I love you.

74
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,880
As long as from now on,

75
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,010
we are both honest with each other,

76
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,560
then the initial purpose for approaching each other

77
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,159
isn't that important anymore.

78
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:37,159
Isn't that right?

79
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:42,720
Qianqiu,

80
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:46,020
you can give me your answer later.

81
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:46,920
It's okay.

82
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:50,600
It's just that Ma Yangfei has suddenly fallen ill,

83
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,800
and I'm a bit worried.

84
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,720
I suspect

85
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,360
Kang Hena has already convinced that person

86
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,620
to cooperate with him.

87
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,580
Now, in the entire royal city,

88
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,960
everything is under their control.

89
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:11,050
Even the soldiers outside the city are poised and ready.

90
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,040
That person,

91
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,400
who is it?

92
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,540
Think about it.

93
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,880
In the entire royal city,

94
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,800
who else could quietly

95
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,040
poison Ma Yangfei?

96
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,880
The royal physician?

97
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:34,640
It can't be.

98
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,120
No, that's not right.

99
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,120
Mu Wan.

100
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,159
But why would she do this?

101
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,500
Because Ma Yangfei killed all of her people.

102
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:55,540
Back then, Ma Yangfei led troops to fight for Dongliu City.

103
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:58,560
Massacred all members of the royal family.

104
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,160
Finally, this day has come.

105
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,040
Ma Yangfei.

106
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,090
You should have been dead long ago.

107
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,420
Ma Yangfei then killed Mu Wan's husband.

108
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,700
He took Mu Wan for himself.

109
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,080
Finally, he handed over Dongliu City to Beiyu.

110
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,140
All for the sake of silver.

111
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,720
This Ma Yangfei sure has some nerve.

112
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,800
Keeping an enemy by his side.

113
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,540
He just thinks he's powerful enough.

114
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,010
He doesn't care about a weak woman.

115
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,400
Indeed, to achieve great things,

116
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,600
one must be ruthless.

117
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,740
What about you?

118
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,800
Aren't you worried about Ma Yangfei?

119
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,330
He is your father after all.

120
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:11,680
It's fine.

121
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,210
A scumbag like him deserves to be taught a lesson.

122
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,300
I'm putting righteousness before family ties.

123
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,760
However,

124
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,440
I'm more concerned about Kang Hena now.

125
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,480
He's so well-prepared,

126
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,660
he must be coming for Huiyin City.

127
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,880
If a fight breaks out,

128
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,650
the civilians are innocent, you know.

129
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,880
I've already arranged with Qin Che to coordinate our efforts from inside and outside.

130
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,410
Xiao Liu,

131
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,440
find an opportunity to go out.

132
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,480
you must deliver this letter

133
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,810
personally to Fang Jue.

134
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,080
Yes, Princess.

135
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,360
Qianqiu,

136
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:38,180
I've been adrift and alone since childhood,

137
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,860
and have never experienced such sincerity.

138
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,940
That's why I've always deliberately avoided my feelings for you.

139
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:48,320
When I suddenly heard you say you loved me,

140
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,800
I couldn't help but doubt myself

141
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,200
and feel terrified.

142
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,120
But only I know

143
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,400
that my heart has always been yearning,

144
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,720
waiting.

145
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,800
Today, I finally realize

146
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,520
my heart is not a stone, it cannot be turned.

147
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:15,040
Qianqiu, wait for my return.

148
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,640
My heart is not a mat, it cannot be rolled up.

149
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:25,480
Sister,

150
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,400
I brought you some little trinkets.

151
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,060
Take a look.

152
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,640
Sister, look at this double-sided painting.

153
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,770
It's quite magical.

154
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,480
Look,

155
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,080
one side is like this,

156
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,500
and the other side has a different style.

157
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,520
Sister,

158
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,890
look at this design.

159
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,300
It's so beautiful.

160
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,320
Kang Hena,

161
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,120
what are you up to now?

162
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,440
Sister,

163
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,960
I really like you.

164
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:11,050
That's why I want to cultivate a good relationship with you.

165
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:12,760
Is that so?

166
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,800
Cultivating a relationship is just a pretense.

167
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,200
You really want to find out Qin Che's whereabouts, don't you?

168
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,000
How could you think of me like that, sister?

169
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,840
Qin Che killed our city's envoy.

170
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,720
I'm just seeking justice from the city lord.

171
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,320
It's only natural, isn't it?

172
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,600
Of course,

173
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,720
if you plead with me, sister,

174
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,940
I can make his passing more comfortable.

175
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,000
There's no need for that.

176
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,840
I don't know where Qin Che is.

177
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,650
You don't need to waste your efforts on me.

178
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,080
How could you lie, sister?

179
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,240
if you really don't know where he is,

180
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,890
why would you send a maid to deliver a message?

181
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,240
Xiao Liu.

182
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,440
Sister,

183
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:21,120
the matter of the city lord's serious illness,

184
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:24,490
it's best not to let those with ill intentions know about it.

185
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,640
If you have anything to say, tell me,

186
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,080
I'll pass it on for you.

187
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:36,960
Oh, sister,

188
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,480
for your safety,

189
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,140
I've arranged two better guards for you.

190
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:44,800
Kang Hena,

191
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,920
you concealed your whereabouts and stayed outside the city for so long,

192
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,600
figuring out everyone's relationships and backgrounds,

193
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,320
secretly stirring up trouble and disrupting the situation.

194
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,440
Then, after father fell ill,

195
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,040
in just a few days,

196
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,120
you replaced all the people in the royal city with your own.

197
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,360
Whatever your plans are,

198
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,800
you can easily accomplish them.

199
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,000
Why do you insist on focusing on Qin Che?

200
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,200
I suppose so.

201
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,440
I don't want my sister to put all her thoughts

202
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,880
on him.

203
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,170
Alright.

204
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,640
I promise you.

205
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,680
I'll tell you where he is.

206
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:32,800
However,

207
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,810
I want to see Ma Yangfei.

208
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:39,720
Okay.

209
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,360
Qianqiu,

210
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:11,800
Qianqiu,

211
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,600
Qianqiu,

212
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,360
save me.

213
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:17,760
Save me.

214
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,770
Don't be afraid.

215
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,210
don't be afraid.

216
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,760
It's just us here.

217
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,490
Don't be afraid.

218
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,000
Qianqiu is here.

219
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,010
You've been lying low for years

220
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,880
just to avenge Dongliucheng.

221
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,840
Xinjiang, Can.

222
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:27,720
Lei, Cai, Long, Yan, Peng, Song, Hui.

223
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,520
Lei, Cai, Long, Yan, Peng, Song, Hui.

224
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:29,960
Bo Jun.

225
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:31,720
Zhuang Cheng.

226
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,520
Zhuang Cheng.

227
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,240
Jin Sheng.

228
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,880
Dan Wei, Ping Ling.

229
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,940
Miao, An, Hao, Wang, Tao, Rui, Kai, Qing, Yu.

230
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:58,490
Nan, Zi, Lei, Ze, Zhen, Yao, Zai, Zhen, Kai, Jing, Lu.

231
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,160
Lu Ling.
