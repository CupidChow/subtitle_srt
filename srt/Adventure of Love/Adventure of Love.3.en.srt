1
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,760
You're not Ma Qianqiu.

2
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:09,920
Who are you?

3
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:13,880
I...

4
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,600
Lunatic.

5
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,840
Of course I'm Ma Qianqiu.

6
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,479
I just...

7
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,840
I just lost my memory.

8
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,640
Don't lie.

9
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,600
And don't think about running away.

10
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,960
I don't like feeling out of control.

11
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,440
Princess Qianqiu, we've come to see you!

12
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,160
Quiet.

13
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,930
Everyone, please be quiet.

14
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,130
The goddess meet-and-greet will now officially begin.

15
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:31,880
I'm coming, I'm coming.

16
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,680
Here's yours.

17
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,440
Please line up over here.

18
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,120
Thank you.

19
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,760
I want one.

20
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,810
Here, this is yours.

21
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:41,800
Here.

22
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,210
General,

23
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,320
do we really have to follow Madam's orders

24
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,240
and not kill the princess

25
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,320
but send her for a political marriage instead?

26
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,050
They just won't leave me alone.

27
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,840
Mu Wan is nothing.

28
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,400
I've just found a new use for Ma Qianqiu.

29
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,940
The General has a new plan.

30
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,320
Think carefully.

31
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,410
Can the escort team for the political marriage enter Beiyu?

32
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,120
I see.

33
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,440
This way, General can personally kill the Lord of Beiyu.

34
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,900
The heads of Ma Yangfei and the Lord of Beiyu,

35
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,250
I will take them both with my own hands.

36
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,720
Go and get a portrait.

37
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,720
Xiao Liu, come give me a massage quickly.

38
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,579
Being a goddess is too difficult.

39
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,720
Qianqiu is back.

40
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,770
Why are you here?

41
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,200
You must be exhausted.

42
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,240
Come, let me give you a massage.

43
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:38,960
No, no, no.

44
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:39,960
I'm scared.

45
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,040
If you have something to say, just say it.

46
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:42,960
It's good news.

47
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:47,840
Take a look.

48
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,440
What do you think of this man?

49
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,740
How handsome he is!

50
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,280
He's alright, I guess.

51
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,610
How about marrying him?

52
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,240
Madam,

53
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,620
Mother, what kind of joke is this?

54
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,080
Why are you suddenly in such a hurry to marry me off?

55
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,100
Well, it's because...

56
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,279
Beiyu is discussing the matter of a political marriage.

57
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,140
And I immediately thought of you.

58
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,320
The lord of Beiyu,

59
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,120
is charming and robust.

60
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,000
Moreover, Beiyu's climate is comfortable and pleasant.

61
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,890
It's very comfortable indeed.

62
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,840
Such a good opportunity, and you thought of me?

63
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,300
What about your daughter?

64
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,100
Isn't Ruofei still too young?

65
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,159
Besides,

66
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,600
I really don't want her to marry too far away either.

67
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,000
So I can get married then?

68
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,440
You're different.

69
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,800
you're marrying to Beiyu,

70
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,120
there won't be any Goddess activities

71
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,640
that you have to attend every day.

72
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,720
It's so annoying.

73
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,920
Mu Wan has a point.

74
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,520
Now I have to be careful of Qin Che,

75
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,520
and deal with Ma Yangfei.

76
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,290
I might as well run far away.

77
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,930
It would be best if I could slip away during the journey to the political marriage.

78
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,000
Qianqiu,

79
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,240
How's your decision?

80
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,920
I...

81
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,720
I...

82
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,560
I promise you.

83
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,800
That's great!

84
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:38,760
That's great!

85
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,400
However,

86
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,320
You owe me a favor.

87
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,200
Of course.

88
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,640
absolutely.

89
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,240
I'll go tell the city lord right away.

90
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,040
That's great.

91
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,970
Madam, please go ahead.

92
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,159
You.

93
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,610
What's going on?

94
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,159
Wonderful, wonderful.

95
00:05:58,159 --> 00:05:58,800
Take care.

96
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,520
Xiao Liu, Princess.

97
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,580
Don't you think he looks like Qin Che?

98
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,130
It seems to have succeeded.

99
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,900
The city lord is actually willing to give the goddess to Beiyu.

100
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,720
A scoundrel like Ma Yangfei,

101
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,280
as long as enough money is offered,

102
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,480
he can sell anything.

103
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,680
Liu Yue.

104
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,380
How could it be him?

105
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,360
General, do you know him?

106
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,040
I've dealt with him before in Beiyu.

107
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:54,210
It seems this marriage alliance won't be so easy.

108
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,160
You may go.

109
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,850
How does that saying go?

110
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,760
Meeting an old friend in a foreign land.

111
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,890
It feels quite nice.

112
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,170
What do you think, General Qin?

113
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,160
Lord Liu Yue, if you keep speaking in riddles,

114
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,760
it's no longer interesting.

115
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,040
The wandering merchant who traded for military supplies in Beiyu

116
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:31,120
has suddenly transformed into the great general of Huiyin City.

117
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,120
I wonder, General Qin,

118
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,200
what use were those military supplies for?

119
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,060
Does the lord of Huiyin City know?

120
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:40,340
Lord Liu Yue, you've come all this way to our Huiyin,

121
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,920
is it just for the marriage alliance?

122
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,600
Have you considered anything else?

123
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,920
The esteemed lord of Huiyin City

124
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,960
can sell his daughter for a thousand taels of gold.

125
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,120
It seems money can make the devil turn the millstone.

126
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,520
Naturally, I've come hoping for such an opportunity as well.

127
00:07:55,159 --> 00:07:56,290
Three hundred gold.

128
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,440
Discussing matters with a clever person

129
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,570
is indeed pleasant.

130
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,480
When the princess sets off for Beiyu,

131
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,340
please escort her well, General.

132
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,920
I'll be in Beiyu City,

133
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,620
waiting to share a drink with you at any time.

134
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,930
Rest assured, Lord Liu Yue.

135
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,720
Demon.

136
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:19,920
Like a lingering evil spirit.

137
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,160
Thank you, Lord of Huiyin City,

138
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,840
for painfully agreeing to marry Princess Qianqiu

139
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,240
to our lord of Beiyu City.

140
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,050
Here, I, Liu Yue, offer you a toast on behalf of our city lord.

141
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,880
I'm fortunate to have met Princess Qianqiu.

142
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,679
She is indeed a heavenly beauty.

143
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,500
I will certainly prepare actively for the marriage alliance.

144
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,400
Cheers.

145
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,380
Cheers.

146
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:47,960
In a while,

147
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,220
it will be our city lord's 60th birthday.

148
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,220
It's truly a double celebration.

149
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,610
What did you say?

150
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,600
Sixty?

151
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,210
Wasn't the portrait you showed me of someone in their twenties?

152
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,920
That was indeed the lord of Beiyu City himself.

153
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,520
He's vigorous despite his age.

154
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,780
Age cannot wither him.

155
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,240
As Princess Qianqiu said,

156
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,600
it must be a portrait of our city lord when he was young.

157
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,440
He was indeed dashing and handsome.

158
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,360
Dashing? Nonsense.

159
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,490
He's already sixty.

160
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,640
So this is for his daughter,

161
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,160
to prevent her from being married off.

162
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,420
He's trying to fool me.

163
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:31,680
Father,

164
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:32,920
I won't marry.

165
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,730
What are you saying?

166
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,200
This isn't something you can change on a whim.

167
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:37,800
Sit down.

168
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:38,800
Sit down?

169
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,920
Fine.

170
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,380
You all want me to get married, right?

171
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,240
Then I'll go all out.

172
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,760
Ancestors of Huiyin,

173
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,440
grant me strength!

174
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:06,740
Ma Qianqiu,

175
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,080
what are you up to now?

176
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:08,560
Get up.

177
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,200
Father, don't ask me.

178
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,840
Ask what heaven's will is.

179
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,160
They say

180
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,720
I've been ordained as a divine maiden.

181
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,280
I should protect this land

182
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,480
and the people I love.

183
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,530
General Qin,

184
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,000
quickly take the princess away.

185
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,800
Take her away.

186
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,760
Perhaps I should come back another day.

187
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:47,840
Fine, fine!

188
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,210
What I mean is...

189
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,520
Please, envoy, come back another day to enjoy Huiyin.

190
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,250
I apologize for not seeing you out.

191
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,400
When the princess changes her mind,

192
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,240
I will bring these gold, silver, and treasures

193
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,100
back to Huiyin.

194
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,240
See you then.

195
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,000
Wait.

196
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,480
Why is Envoy Liu Yue in such a hurry?

197
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,280
Indeed.

198
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,490
Wait a few more days.

199
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,840
The goddess might change her mind,

200
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,120
and the marriage alliance can still continue.

201
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:20,920
Father,

202
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,320
if I really get married,

203
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,920
can you bring yourself to call him son-in-law?

204
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,100
With some effort, I'm sure I can manage to say it.

205
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,360
Yes, Qianqiu.

206
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,600
Consider it as a gesture of goodwill between our two cities.

207
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,060
On the day of your wedding,

208
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,080
I will personally dress you up,

209
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,610
and send you off in the bridal sedan chair.

210
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,380
Why don't you remarry yourself, Mother?

211
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,240
I think you and the lord of Beiyu City

212
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,700
would make a better match.

213
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,040
If you're willing, Mother,

214
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,600
to sacrifice your happiness for our marriage,

215
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,840
the historians will surely sing your praises.

216
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,260
You ungrateful child!

217
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,480
My lord, look at her.

218
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,920
I see Mother as domineering and overbearing,

219
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,980
and a bully at home.

220
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,040
She's truly a perfect match for my father.

221
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:04,640
You...

222
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:06,840
Come on, hit me!

223
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,040
Guards! Guards!

224
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,200
Murder!

225
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,160
Guards!

226
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,880
Seize her quickly!

227
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,660
Finally escaped from that den of tigers and wolves.

228
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,380
Princess Qianqiu.

229
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,540
I'm really impressed.

230
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:50,320
Princess Qianqiu, Princess Qianqiu, Princess Qianqiu.

231
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,520
I'm sorry.

232
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,930
May I borrow this place?

233
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,120
After all, I'm a goddess.

234
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,640
Why did I come here?

235
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,280
Shut up.

236
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,240
Covers mouth.

237
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:16,930
Let's go.

238
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,890
Finally managed to avoid them.

239
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:36,960
Princess.

240
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,080
Qin Che.

241
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,240
You even managed to find me here.

242
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:42,880
Princess.

243
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,240
Princess,

244
00:13:59,080 --> 00:13:59,840
come out now.

245
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:02,920
Princess.

246
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,400
Are you crazy?

247
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,840
You've soaked me.

248
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,000
How else could I catch you?

249
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,370
Don't worry, Princess.

250
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,420
I will ensure your safe arrival in Beiyu.

251
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:08,160
Do I really have to marry this 60-year-old man?

252
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,000
Yes.

253
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,780
You're determined to make things difficult for me.

254
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,080
Qin Che.

255
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,560
Since you've delivered yourself to me,

256
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,490
prepare to face the consequences.

257
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,880
Xinjiang, Di, Can.

258
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:06,520
Lei, Cai, Long, Yan, Peng, Song, Hui.

259
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,580
Lei, Cai, Long, Yan, Peng, Song, Hui.

260
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,080
Zhuang Cheng.

261
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,000
Jin Sheng.

262
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,640
Dan Wei, Ping Ling.

263
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,020
Miao, An, Hao, Wang, Tao, Rui, Kai, Qing, Yu.

264
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,250
Nan, Zi, Lei, Ze, Zhen, Yao, Zai, Zhen, Kai, Jing, Lu.

265
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,120
Ting.

266
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:44,640
Lu Ling.

267
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:44,960
Lu Ling.

268
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,240
Lu Ling.
