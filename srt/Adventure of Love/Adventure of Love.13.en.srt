1
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,520
Still refusing to accept it?

2
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,400
Didn't you say I was doing it for business?

3
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,520
I did say that.

4
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,840
The princess said,

5
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,080
in these two months, Ma Ruofei

6
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,240
has already been hailed as the new goddess.

7
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,770
She doesn't need to promote herself anymore.

8
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,610
The princess also said,

9
00:01:36,039 --> 00:01:36,880
she also said,

10
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:40,300
she wishes the general to find his desired person soon.

11
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,480
Phase three.

12
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,040
Princess.

13
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,740
You haven't eaten anything for two days.

14
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,560
Can you tell Xiao Liu what happened?

15
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,560
It's nothing.

16
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,040
Stage one.

17
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,400
Avoidance.

18
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,200
Xiao Liu.

19
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,840
Why doesn't he like me?

20
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,920
I've misplaced my feelings.

21
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,200
Princess, please stop crying.

22
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,160
You've been crying for a month.

23
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,680
Stage two: Emotional outburst.

24
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,160
Will it?

25
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:31,160
Stage Three: Self-Degradation.

26
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,760
Princess,

27
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,560
please stop degrading yourself like this.

28
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,050
I'm simply appreciating the beauty of the world.

29
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,040
But, Princess,

30
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,760
why won't you accept General Qin?

31
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,880
Besides you,

32
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,840
he has no contact with any other women.

33
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,100
How could he possibly like someone else?

34
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,600
That's only because the person he likes

35
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,680
is not here.

36
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,600
Xiao Liu,

37
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,240
you need to keep your eyes wide open.

38
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:12,320
Do you and Fang Jue really have anything?

39
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,480
No,

40
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,079
really, we don't.

41
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,160
Really don't?

42
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,880
Whether you do or not,

43
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,080
as long as you're happy,

44
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,760
you can marry whoever you want.

45
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,800
It's fine if you don't want to get married at all.

46
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,120
Stay here with me.

47
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,880
or go out and travel.

48
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,000
It's up to you.

49
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,360
Princess,

50
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,440
Xiao Liu hopes that you are

51
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,460
the happiest person in the world.

52
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,640
Here you go.

53
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:01,880
No.

54
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,900
The envoy from Beiyu will arrive in Huiyin soon.

55
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,400
Rest assured, General.

56
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,560
Everything has been arranged.

57
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,840
Even if the Beiyu envoy comes,

58
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,500
they won't find any evidence.

59
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,600
Any news from the royal city recently?

60
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,080
No.

61
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,770
It seems they're busy with the Lantern Festival.

62
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,520
I heard the new Lantern Festival Goddess

63
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,650
is Princess Ruofei.

64
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,660
I don't want to.

65
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,400
I don't want to, Mother.

66
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,680
I finally have a chance

67
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,120
to become the Lantern Festival Goddess.

68
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,120
Why should I give it up to Ma Qianqiu?

69
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,320
My good daughter, my sweet daughter,

70
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,920
being the Lantern Festival Goddess

71
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,680
means staying up late and dancing,

72
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,320
and attending a bunch of events.

73
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,600
It's exhausting.

74
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,680
And when the time comes,

75
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,600
you won't even have time for beauty sleep.

76
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,460
You won't look your best anymore.

77
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:56,760
No way.

78
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,440
They like me so much now.

79
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,000
I can't let them down.

80
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,440
This is the only trick we can use.

81
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,410
Come on, Ruofei.

82
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,200
Look.

83
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,080
This is a challenge letter from Ma Qianqiu to you.

84
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,760
She wants to compete with you.

85
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,800
This is really too much.

86
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,320
Ruofei, let's compete with her.

87
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,250
We need to win, but we must win fair and square.

88
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,000
Right?

89
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,440
Ma Qianqiu.

90
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,520
Okay.

91
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,320
I must defeat her.

92
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,140
defeat her.

93
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,960
After all, Ma Qianqiu

94
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,170
has been the Goddess for so many years.

95
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,720
Beating Ruo Fei should be more than enough.

96
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,520
What do you think this is?

97
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,159
It's a challenge letter from Princess Ruo Fei to you.

98
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:55,880
She wants to compete with you for the title of Goddess at the Lantern Festival.

99
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,840
I'm not going, not going.

100
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,770
I finally have a few peaceful days.

101
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,140
I heard it will be held by the Hao River this year.

102
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,410
We can leave the palace.

103
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,100
Never mind.

104
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,440
It's too sunny in the suburbs.

105
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,300
I heard it's a duo dance this year.

106
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,760
The dance partner is chosen by the Goddess herself.

107
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,120
This is a great opportunity

108
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,920
for you and General Qin to make a public appearance.

109
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,780
There's no need for that anymore.

110
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,500
General Qin has indeed been busy lately.

111
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,080
I heard that the envoy from Beiyu

112
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,840
will soon arrive in our Huiyin

113
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,300
to investigate the case of the Liuyue envoy.

114
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,080
What?

115
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,760
Beiyu previously said they would pause the marriage alliance,

116
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,520
but they didn't say they would cancel it.

117
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,800
Knowing Ma Yangfei's personality,

118
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,130
he's definitely planning to marry me off.

119
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,240
Xiao Liu,

120
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,000
it's just the Goddess Competition, isn't it?

121
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,560
I agreed.

122
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:18,880
Ruofei will win.

123
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,080
Professional team.

124
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,080
Ruofei will win.

125
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:27,880
I

126
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,480
Ma Qianqiu, don't be so smug.

127
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,140
I will definitely defeat you.

128
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,200
Oh really? I'm so scared.

129
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,600
Ruofei

130
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,120
Just you wait.

131
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:44,810
Retreat.

132
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:53,640
Princess,

133
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,200
what's wrong?

134
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,640
I... I've got a cramp in my leg.

135
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,280
What should we do?

136
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,040
General Qin, we're over here.

137
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,800
The princess has a leg cramp.

138
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:10,920
Let him go.

139
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,370
Are you here?

140
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,820
Say something.

141
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,330
Are you here?

142
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,880
Got a foot cramp.

143
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,760
Qin Che, what are you doing?

144
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,320
Don't move.

145
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,160
Put me down.

146
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,560
Move again and I'll throw you in the river to feed the fish.

147
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,130
Is your leg feeling better?

148
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:56,960
Why haven't you

149
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,460
been willing to see me for months?

150
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:02,920
Didn't you say

151
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,480
we're just using each other?

152
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,410
No need to know each other too well?

153
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,400
Before, because of Ping'er,

154
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,020
I lost my mind at that time.

155
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,800
It was my fault. I'm sorry.

156
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,080
I see.

157
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,960
I can understand.

158
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,960
That's not right.

159
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,160
Am I too easily fooled?

160
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,970
The thing about him liking Ma Qianqiu.

161
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:39,720
No.

162
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,960
If I'm going to die, I want to die knowing the truth.

163
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,120
Qin Che,

164
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,860
have you ever loved

165
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,330
or liked anyone?

166
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,200
I haven't.

167
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,320
No?

168
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,720
Then why did you draw so many pictures of me?

169
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,580
What pictures?

170
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,400
The ones from the day our engagement was announced.

171
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,160
The pictures you showed to Rong Anjie.

172
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,090
Fang Jue even took them back later.

173
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,130
You mean when I held you?

174
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,890
that time I held you, right?

175
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,280
Yes.

176
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,240
Those were drawn by an artist I hired.

177
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,040
It was a precautionary measure.

178
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,440
Drawn by an artist?

179
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,120
That's not right.

180
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,240
That time I went to find you because of Ping'er.

181
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,700
Who were you drawing then?

182
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,400
That time I was drawing Ping'er.

183
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,840
I needed to find a body double based on her measurements.

184
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,440
I just made a few notes on it.

185
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,000
Ping'er?

186
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,360
That should

187
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,890
that should be correct.

188
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,000
Right, right.

189
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,440
No, wait.

190
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,720
So you were planning to find a body double that time?

191
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,250
And you even argued with me?

192
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,520
Forget it.

193
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,050
It's all in the past.

194
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,880
So he didn't like that version of me.

195
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,000
That's great.

196
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,680
So,

197
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,770
it's so good that I didn't like you?

198
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,140
You don't understand.

199
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,320
But now,

200
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,720
there's still a small problem.

201
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,400
Go ahead.

202
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,080
Xin Jiangdi Can.

203
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:23,810
Xin Jiangdi.

204
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,440
Bo Jun.

205
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,080
Bo Jun.

206
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,960
Zhuang Cheng.

207
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:33,720
Jin Sheng.

208
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,520
Dan Wei Pingling.

209
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,210
Miao An Hao Wang Tao Rui Kai Qing Yu.

210
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,400
Yue.

211
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,460
Nan Zi Lei Ze Zhen Yao Zai Zhen Kai Jing Lu.

212
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,320
Ting.

213
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:04,480
Lu Ling.

214
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,120
Lu Ling.
