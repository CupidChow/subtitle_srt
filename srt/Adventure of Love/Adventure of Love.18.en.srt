1
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:17,560
General.

2
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,039
It's me.

3
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,280
General.

4
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,480
What exactly happened that day?

5
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,539
How did you get such severe injuries?

6
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,160
Did you follow the leads to capture the rebels from Beiyu?

7
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,820
did you come up empty-handed?

8
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,000
Someone clearly saw them outside the city.

9
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,039
but when I arrived,

10
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,479
there was no one left.

11
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:47,440
By the time I rushed back to the city,

12
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,240
I found out that you were wanted.

13
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,039
I followed the marks you left behind

14
00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:52,100
to find this place.

15
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,840
We've fallen into a trap.

16
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,140
It's the city lord.

17
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,810
No wonder he didn't pursue the matter of the chime bells.

18
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,449
It's not just the city lord.

19
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,180
Kang Hena is involved too.

20
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,040
General.

21
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,960
Before I came here,

22
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,760
I heard that the princess and Kang Hena's wedding date has been set.

23
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,760
It's on the fourth day of next month.

24
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,880
Kang Hena appears harmless on the surface,

25
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,850
but he's actually deeply scheming and calculating.

26
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,960
Ma Yangfei's willingness to help him like this

27
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,760
must mean they've reached some kind of agreement.

28
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,680
If we want things to go smoothly,

29
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,280
we must eliminate him first.

30
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,720
Focus your investigation on

31
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,420
his personal bodyguards.

32
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,250
There might be some surprises.

33
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,680
Now that everyone outside is looking for you, General,

34
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,080
why don't you stay here for a few more days

35
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,810
to recover from your injuries?

36
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,160
One last time.

37
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,920
let me have a crazy dream.

38
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:46,880
For me?

39
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,720
Do you like it?

40
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,000
Then plug it in for me.

41
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,160
Okay.

42
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,880
Does it look good?

43
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,320
It's not fixed yet.

44
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,880
Almost, almost.

45
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,340
I think it can connect now.

46
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,200
Let me try.

47
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,000
Hello? Hello?

48
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,200
Hello? Hello?

49
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:04,680
Qianqiu?

50
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,210
qianqiu?

51
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:07,880
What's wrong?

52
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,200
It's nothing.

53
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,160
I'm just a bit groggy from waking up.

54
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,130
That's good.

55
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,330
Come on, I'll go make you some food.

56
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,440
Qin Che,

57
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,480
you love me, right?

58
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,000
I love you.

59
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,730
You're injured.

60
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,560
Let me see.

61
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,570
It's just a minor wound.

62
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,760
Who did this?

63
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,520
Let me take a look.

64
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,930
It must have been Kang Hena.

65
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,540
He sent someone disguised as you.

66
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:49,980
I was careless.

67
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,240
Come on.

68
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,220
I'll take you to apply some medicine.

69
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,200
Your martial arts skills are so advanced,

70
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,660
yet you didn't even dodge.

71
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,600
I did dodge.

72
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,530
Otherwise, you'd be looking at my corpse.

73
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,770
Since you mentioned Kang Hena,

74
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,200
I need to ask you about Liu Yue's matter.

75
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,200
This Kang Hena inexplicably

76
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,160
produced a bunch of random evidence,

77
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,760
claiming you killed Liu Yue.

78
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,920
What's infuriating is that Ma Yangfei is in cahoots with him.

79
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,640
I must now produce more compelling evidence

80
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,800
to shut them up.

81
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,020
You really believe I didn't kill her?

82
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,320
Of course.

83
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,420
I've already sent Fang Jue to find evidence.

84
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,280
Qianqiu,

85
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,340
for these few days,

86
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,330
let's set aside our identities as princess and general,

87
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,450
and be just an ordinary couple.

88
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,480
But...

89
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,460
Fang Jue has been here.

90
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,720
So you already know,

91
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,120
my agreement to marry him is just a temporary measure.

92
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,920
Because we must clear your suspicion now

93
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,880
to be qualified to negotiate with Ma Yangfei.

94
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,360
I...

95
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,400
I know.

96
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,210
But there's no rush.

97
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,320
I won't let you marry him either.

98
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:04,850
General,

99
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,560
You startled me.

100
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,520
General.

101
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,440
Recently,

102
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,140
you seem to have changed a lot.

103
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,580
What do you want to say now?

104
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,680
General, do you remember

105
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,240
how I came to be by your side?

106
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,520
That year when disaster struck,

107
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,780
I lost both my parents.

108
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,720
In Huiyin City,

109
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:46,040
I couldn't even compete with other beggars for a steamed bun.

110
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:46,800
It was you,

111
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,380
you gave me half a steamed bun.

112
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,200
You told me

113
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,810
that I must become stronger

114
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,380
so that others wouldn't bully me.

115
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,480
We secretly learned martial arts together,

116
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,080
went through numerous battles, big and small.

117
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,960
Now, you're about to achieve great success,

118
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,160
fulfilling your long-cherished wish.

119
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,640
I really don't want

120
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,400
you to let all these years of effort go to waste

121
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,800
because of someone like Ma Qianqiu.

122
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:24,920
Fang Jue.

123
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,580
General, please listen to me.

124
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,760
But you know,

125
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,280
I hope even more

126
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,900
that you can live freely, without constraints.

127
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,280
Your interactions with the Princess,

128
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,280
I've seen it all.

129
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,330
You really like her.

130
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,240
I just want to use her.

131
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,240
General,

132
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,480
I hope you won't avoid it.

133
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,440
think it through carefully,

134
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,360
then make your decision.

135
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,220
After hearing the news I told you,

136
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,650
what are you going to do?

137
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,420
What happened?

138
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,920
Ma Yangfei has fallen ill.

139
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:15,420
It seems we need to return to the royal city as soon as possible.

140
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,080
Xin Jiangdi

141
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,320
Lei Cai Long Yan Peng Songhui

142
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,000
Bo Jun

143

Zhuang Cheng

144
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,280
Jin Sheng

145
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,520
Dan Wei Pingling

Lu Ling
