1
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:08,800
Princess.

2
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,560
Where did you learn all this?

3
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,880
I... I saw it in a storybook.

4
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,560
Princess.

5
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,420
Madam invites you and General Qin to go tonight.

6
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,000
Or you can continue.

7
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,479
I... I'll go get ready.

8
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,240
You should get ready too.

9
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,579
How could I forget they're involved?

10
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,880
You encouraged me to perform.

11
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,880
I'll have to get back at you for this.

12
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Che.

13
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,440
Play along, brother.

14
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,600
It seems Qianqiu and General Qin Che aren't close either.

15
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,260
General Qin has never eaten tangerines before.

16
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,040
Mother, you're so well-informed.

17
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,079
Is it good?

18
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,320
Very sweet.

19
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,079
Of course.

20
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,040
I peeled it myself.

21
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,360
Madam, people can change.

22
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,730
after meeting Qianqiu,

23
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,820
I've come to love eating tangerines.

24
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,560
Say something.

25
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,720
The way you two act so lovingly,

26
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,920
it would be great if others could see it.

27
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,040
Then there wouldn't be so many rumors.

28
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,600
All this gossip is giving me a headache.

29
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,840
A... a statement to refute rumors.

30
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,920
Surely Qianqiu wouldn't deceive me and your father

31
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,839
just to avoid a political marriage.

32
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,500
If this were to be discovered,

33
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,760
it wouldn't just be the marriage at stake.

34
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,220
You could face severe punishment, you know.

35
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:30,880
Madam,

36
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,280
I shouldn't stay in the city for long.

37
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,159
Qianqiu and I will take our leave now.

38
00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:36,720
Yes, yes.

39
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,159
Then I'll see him off.

40
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,600
Farewell.

41
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,440
Che, let's go.

42
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,040
Madam, look.

43
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,120
Qin Che.

44
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,780
What exactly are you trying to do?

45
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:02,810
Keep acting.

46
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,940
There are still people watching.

47
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:07,920
However,

48
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,400
why did you help me upset Mu Wan just now?

49
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,560
Aren't you afraid of hurting her feelings?

50
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,330
Am I not the Princess's fiancé?

51
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,330
Why should I care about Madam's feelings?

52
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,240
Well said.

53
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,480
Keep it up, fiancé.

54
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:38,360
But can you let go of me now?

55
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,090
People are still watching.

56
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,400
Don't look back if you don't want to be discovered.

57
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,000
Alright.

58
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,480
Fireworks fade easily, ice and snow melt swiftly.

59
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,040
It seems we're born just to leave.

60
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,360
Qin Che,

61
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,040
you seem to be growing on me.

62
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:54,960
The same goes for you, Princess.

63
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,480
Let's go.

64
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,340
How did it go? Did you buy them?

65
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,280
Princess,

66
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,760
So many.

67
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,640
It's said that Boss Rong has mobilized all the tabloids.

68
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:24,370
Different versions of denial statements are published every day.

69
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,040
No good.

70
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,540
If this continues,

71
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,760
unless I actually get together with Qin Che,

72
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,420
there's no way to shut them up.

73
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,600
I actually hope you two end up together.

74
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,690
What did you say?

75
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,880
Nothing, nothing.

76
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,450
However, Princess,

77
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:42,520
why did you come to this gossip house in person today?

78
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,240
I'd like to have a good meeting with this Mr. Chen.

79
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,880
suppress all these rumors.

80
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,680
Xiao Liu, if you have something to say, just say it.

81
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,840
Why are you pulling me into this?

82
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,640
Miss, it wasn't me.

83
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,920
Miss, can you help me?

84
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,080
Miss, what happened?

85
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,520
Our home, our home has been flooded.

86
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,820
The royal city hasn't sent anyone with news yet.

87
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,010
We had no choice.

88
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,450
My mother and I can only beg on the streets.

89
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,520
Please, help our hometown.

90
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,560
The princess and General Qin

91
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,280
are actually enjoying the snow together.

92
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,080
Is that for real?

93
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,360
Let me see, let me see.

94
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,440
Let me take a look.

95
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,720
Indeed.

96
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,400
No one cares about what's truly important.

97
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,660
Everyone's always fixated on my little romantic affairs.

98
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,280
Young lady, don't worry.

99
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,010
I will definitely help you.

100
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,200
Let's go and make more people aware.

101
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:42,810
Let's go.

102
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,040
Why does this person look so familiar?

103
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,100
I don't believe it.

104
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,500
The princess would never be with Qin Che.

105
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,120
Look, the fool has come out.

106
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:50,850
Impossible.

107
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,500
Let me tell you.

108
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,600
It must be Qin Che.

109
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,160
He must have relentlessly pursued and deceived the princess.

110
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:57,720
Enough.

111
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,890
The engagement is real.

112
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,200
Qin Che and I

113
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,080
are genuinely together.

114
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,440
Don't

115
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,170
go crazy over an imaginary version of me anymore.

116
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,560
Princess Qianqiu.

117
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,480
It's the real princess.

118
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,080
Princess.

119
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,000
Princess.

120
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,280
Princess, Princess Qianqiu.

121
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,240
Princess, run!

122
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,440
Princess, run! Princess!

123
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,120
I can't turn a blind eye to this.

124
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,040
Do you know?

125
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,600
there's a flood disaster in someone's hometown right now.

126
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,200
People are being displaced.

127
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,980
It's no use, Princess.

128
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,680
Princess, run! Princess!

129
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,700
Don't come any closer!

130
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,200
Princess!

131
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,240
Princess!

132
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,240
Run, Princess!

133
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,360
Run, Princess!

134
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,240
What joy is there in life, what sorrow in death?

135
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,280
Let's go.

136
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,200
I'll take you to a safe place.

137
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,120
Xinjiang, Can.

138
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:41,760
Bo Jun.

139
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,280
Zhuang Cheng.

140
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:46,920
Jin Sheng.

141
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:47,520
Jin Sheng.

142
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,840
Dan Wei, Ping Ling.

143
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,220
Miao, An, Hao, Wang, Tao, Rui, Kai, Qing, Yu.

144
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:02,560
Ni.

145
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:03,920
Yue.

146
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,050
Nan, Zi, Lei, Ze, Zhen, Yao, Zai, Zhen, Kai, Jing, Lu.

147
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:17,960
Lu Ling.

148
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,600
Lu Ling.
