1
00:01:22,819 --> 00:01:23,653
Yeah...

2
00:01:24,654 --> 00:01:25,989
Come on, fall!

3
00:01:44,925 --> 00:01:46,843
They must really like you.

4
00:01:46,843 --> 00:01:48,470
Sending you expensive eel.

5
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:49,888
It’s not that they like me.

6
00:01:50,472 --> 00:01:52,390
They’re going to work me even harder.

7
00:01:52,724 --> 00:01:54,059
Those Americans too

8
00:01:54,392 --> 00:01:57,312
must know that eels
make men perform better.

9
00:01:58,605 --> 00:02:01,441
They even sent it on your birthday.

10
00:02:04,486 --> 00:02:05,612
The kids will hear!

11
00:02:06,613 --> 00:02:10,116
I need eel! Eel!

12
00:02:10,325 --> 00:02:11,826
Come and eat!

13
00:02:12,452 --> 00:02:16,248
Dad sweated in the heat grilling these.

14
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:17,540
I’ll go.

15
00:02:24,631 --> 00:02:25,548
A snake?

16
00:02:26,591 --> 00:02:28,051
Snakes don’t taste this good!

17
00:02:28,051 --> 00:02:30,971
Dad’s company sent
it, for doing a good job.

18
00:02:31,263 --> 00:02:32,639
It’s not even a holiday.

19
00:02:33,557 --> 00:02:35,433
Couldn’t they give us beef?

20
00:02:36,685 --> 00:02:37,686
Ri-one.

21
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:39,229
Dinner.

22
00:02:42,107 --> 00:02:44,693
Come on. Let’s eat.

23
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:47,988
Let the cello take a nap.

24
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,368
What’s this?

25
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:05,714
Honey!

26
00:03:08,592 --> 00:03:10,802
Must’ve been expensive!

27
00:03:11,886 --> 00:03:14,973
Well, I can afford decent dance shoes.

28
00:03:15,557 --> 00:03:18,143
- Aren’t Mom’s shoes pretty?
- Eat up.

29
00:03:21,187 --> 00:03:23,064
I’ll be able to dance so well in these.

30
00:03:26,443 --> 00:03:29,154
They say not to gift
shoes to your lover.

31
00:03:29,571 --> 00:03:30,155
Why?

32
00:03:30,322 --> 00:03:31,031
Why?

33
00:03:31,323 --> 00:03:33,450
‘Cause they might run away in them.

34
00:03:34,534 --> 00:03:37,412
Seems your dad is confident.

35
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:39,998
Come on.

36
00:03:41,082 --> 00:03:43,001
We need to practice when we can.

37
00:03:44,794 --> 00:03:46,379
Ready, start!

38
00:03:46,796 --> 00:03:48,548
One two three,

39
00:03:48,548 --> 00:03:52,635
two two three, three two three...

40
00:04:17,827 --> 00:04:20,413
<i>Thanks for your hard work and
years of dedication to Solar Paper.</i>

41
00:04:20,413 --> 00:04:22,499
Damned paper...

42
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:25,417
Honey, come here.

43
00:04:25,417 --> 00:04:26,378
Why?

44
00:04:28,296 --> 00:04:28,922
Come on.

45
00:04:30,673 --> 00:04:32,092
Come on, Ri-one.

46
00:04:34,719 --> 00:04:40,850
<i>Ri-two
Si-two</i>

47
00:04:44,729 --> 00:04:46,147
Just three minutes more.

48
00:04:47,023 --> 00:04:48,358
One minute...

49
00:04:56,908 --> 00:04:58,535
Know what I’m feeling now?

50
00:05:02,288 --> 00:05:03,790
I’ve got it all.

51
00:05:40,076 --> 00:05:44,706
<i>You people bought Solar Paper,
where I devoted 25 years of my life.</i>

52
00:05:45,457 --> 00:05:47,250
<i>But as soon as you take over, you say</i>

53
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,711
<i>you’ll cut 20% of the production line?</i>

54
00:05:50,378 --> 00:05:52,589
<i>And you ask for a
list of names to fire?</i>

55
00:05:53,506 --> 00:05:56,384
<i>Names of veterans who
taught me their craft?</i>

56
00:05:57,343 --> 00:05:59,929
<i>Names of young men who
came of age in this factory?</i>

57
00:06:01,181 --> 00:06:03,892
<i>Innocent workers who lovingly
cared for these machines,</i>

58
00:06:04,142 --> 00:06:07,520
<i>you want me to point
a gun at their heads?</i>

59
00:06:08,646 --> 00:06:09,939
<i>I can’t do it.</i>

60
00:06:11,191 --> 00:06:13,776
<i>Guns are meant to be
aimed at one’s enemies!</i>

61
00:06:13,776 --> 00:06:14,652
Stop! Think! Act!

62
00:06:14,652 --> 00:06:17,614
<i>I cannot give you that list.</i>

63
00:06:20,116 --> 00:06:22,160
<i>You Americans say</i>

64
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:24,037
to be fired is to be ‘axed’?

65
00:06:24,871 --> 00:06:26,706
Know what we say in Korea?

66
00:06:26,873 --> 00:06:28,249
Off with your head!

67
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:30,460
So being fired

68
00:06:31,711 --> 00:06:35,340
is having your head
chopped clear off with an ax!

69
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:42,055
<i>Job for life, old shoes</i>

70
00:06:42,055 --> 00:06:45,016
“If you don’t start a union,
we guarantee a job for life.”

71
00:06:45,391 --> 00:06:49,938
That beautiful tradition...
tossed out like old shoes!

72
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:52,190
To you Americans...!

73
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,358
Damn, my throat...

74
00:06:53,942 --> 00:06:55,735
I said to do this in the warehouse.

75
00:06:56,361 --> 00:06:58,238
All because you wanted to smoke.

76
00:06:59,155 --> 00:07:00,073
Quit, dammit!

77
00:07:00,073 --> 00:07:02,242
You put so much work into this.

78
00:07:02,242 --> 00:07:04,160
He could’ve said, forget it.

79
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,747
- But he acts like it’s his job at stake.
- It is!

80
00:07:07,956 --> 00:07:10,375
If you guys are fired,
who will I work with?

81
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:12,085
Real sense of humanity.

82
00:07:12,627 --> 00:07:13,628
Damn.

83
00:07:16,297 --> 00:07:17,298
Stop!

84
00:07:25,306 --> 00:07:26,266
Hello, sir.

85
00:07:36,985 --> 00:07:38,528
Off with your head!

86
00:07:38,528 --> 00:07:40,822
- So to be fired...
- Give back the helmet!

87
00:07:40,822 --> 00:07:42,782
...is to chop your head clear off!

88
00:07:43,157 --> 00:07:43,950
Wait!

89
00:07:45,451 --> 00:07:47,370
What’ll he do with that helmet?

90
00:07:54,711 --> 00:07:55,378
They didn’t...

91
00:07:56,421 --> 00:07:57,672
give you the eel, did they?

92
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:03,761
No way, right?

93
00:08:11,603 --> 00:08:12,478
Honey.

94
00:08:14,105 --> 00:08:14,856
What?

95
00:08:15,523 --> 00:08:17,150
You said you’d say something.

96
00:08:19,485 --> 00:08:20,445
I forgot.

97
00:08:20,695 --> 00:08:22,280
Aren’t you going to work?

98
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,406
Right, right.

99
00:08:23,781 --> 00:08:24,616
That’s right.

100
00:08:26,534 --> 00:08:28,119
Si-two Ri-two, house!

101
00:08:29,037 --> 00:08:30,371
Study hard.

102
00:08:32,832 --> 00:08:34,959
- Ri-one, let’s go.
- Ri-one!

103
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:37,211
Have a good day.

104
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,343
Good luck!

105
00:08:46,179 --> 00:08:48,514
I slaved for 25 years!

106
00:08:56,814 --> 00:08:57,899
Deep breaths.

107
00:09:14,582 --> 00:09:16,209
- I am...
- I am...

108
00:09:16,709 --> 00:09:17,835
A good person.

109
00:09:18,002 --> 00:09:19,379
A good person.

110
00:09:19,379 --> 00:09:20,296
Man-su!

111
00:09:21,005 --> 00:09:21,756
...person.

112
00:09:21,756 --> 00:09:23,508
- Losing my job...
- Losing my job...

113
00:09:24,008 --> 00:09:26,344
- Losing my job!
- Losing my job...

114
00:09:27,053 --> 00:09:30,306
is not my choice!

115
00:09:33,601 --> 00:09:36,479
- My loving family...
- My loving family...

116
00:09:36,479 --> 00:09:38,272
My loving family...

117
00:09:39,148 --> 00:09:42,568
will support me fully as I
seek new opportunities.

118
00:09:43,027 --> 00:09:47,031
...as I seek new opportunities.

119
00:09:47,699 --> 00:09:51,744
My loving family will support me fully

120
00:09:52,036 --> 00:09:53,996
as I seek new opportunities.

121
00:10:00,253 --> 00:10:01,546
<i>Honey.</i>

122
00:10:02,505 --> 00:10:04,006
Can you put in earphones?

123
00:10:04,006 --> 00:10:05,258
<i>Just a sec.</i>

124
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:08,344
<i>Hired in 3 months</i>

125
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:15,893
So you must’ve had sleepless nights?

126
00:10:19,772 --> 00:10:20,940
Are you crying?

127
00:10:23,609 --> 00:10:28,322
Where’s that brave bachelor
who proposed to a single mom?

128
00:10:29,115 --> 00:10:33,161
I made a new start, you can too.

129
00:10:34,495 --> 00:10:36,080
Sure you can!

130
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:39,459
Take all your hopes and dreams,

131
00:10:39,459 --> 00:10:42,628
<i>and recite your own incantation.</i>

132
00:10:43,671 --> 00:10:44,464
Ready?

133
00:10:44,672 --> 00:10:45,965
Go!

134
00:10:48,801 --> 00:10:49,719
<i>A new start...</i>

135
00:10:49,719 --> 00:10:51,471
<i>A new start... A new start...</i>

136
00:10:51,971 --> 00:10:52,930
<i>A new start.</i>

137
00:10:53,264 --> 00:10:54,182
A new start.

138
00:10:55,058 --> 00:10:56,392
I’m head of a family.

139
00:10:57,894 --> 00:10:59,103
I’ll be born again.

140
00:11:00,563 --> 00:11:04,025
To put food in my family’s mouths...

141
00:11:04,859 --> 00:11:06,360
<i>there’s nothing I won’t do.</i>

142
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:10,114
In three months,

143
00:11:12,158 --> 00:11:13,659
I’ll get hired again!

144
00:11:17,663 --> 00:11:19,165
I feel great!

145
00:11:22,126 --> 00:11:24,837
<i>3 Months Later</i>

146
00:11:24,837 --> 00:11:27,882
<i>13 Months Later</i>

147
00:11:27,882 --> 00:11:30,051
Hi Namgu, I know.

148
00:11:30,051 --> 00:11:31,135
Today at 5 o’clock.

149
00:11:31,135 --> 00:11:33,304
<i>My boss is really curious about you.</i>

150
00:11:33,846 --> 00:11:37,558
<i>Sorry to ask so suddenly,
but can you come at noon?</i>

151
00:11:37,809 --> 00:11:39,352
Listen, I’m...

152
00:11:40,394 --> 00:11:42,396
at the retail store, with my wife.

153
00:11:43,773 --> 00:11:47,985
<i>The boss suddenly booked
a 5pm flight back to China.</i>

154
00:11:47,985 --> 00:11:48,653
<i>Too much to ask?</i>

155
00:11:48,653 --> 00:11:50,321
No no, hold on.

156
00:11:50,613 --> 00:11:51,280
Wait.

157
00:11:51,614 --> 00:11:54,367
I’ll plead with my wife.

158
00:11:54,367 --> 00:11:57,245
<i>That’s right. Come over now.</i>

159
00:11:57,787 --> 00:12:01,916
<i>But there’s a question he always
asks. “What’s your weak point?”</i>

160
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:03,167
Weak point?

161
00:12:03,167 --> 00:12:07,839
<i>It’s a crucial-utely
sensitive issue, okay?</i>

162
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:09,215
Okay, thanks!

163
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,363
Weak point?

164
00:12:32,363 --> 00:12:35,449
<i>Sorry, I know it’s absolutely
impossible to answer.</i>

165
00:12:35,449 --> 00:12:37,201
What’s my weak point?

166
00:12:37,201 --> 00:12:41,414
What do you think?
You love plants too much.

167
00:12:41,414 --> 00:12:42,874
You’re a vegetable.

168
00:12:43,749 --> 00:12:46,002
<i>Last night you called me an animal.</i>

169
00:12:48,504 --> 00:12:50,840
<i>Namgu gave me this awesome tip.</i>

170
00:12:52,216 --> 00:12:54,010
<i>Mortgage Default Warning</i>

171
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:56,429
<i>If only I can explain
my weak point well.</i>

172
00:12:56,762 --> 00:12:59,348
<i>It’s a crucial-utely sensitive issue.</i>

173
00:13:00,725 --> 00:13:05,229
If you’re hired, you’ll work under
your former subordinate Namgu.

174
00:13:05,229 --> 00:13:07,064
Tell us how you feel about that.

175
00:13:07,523 --> 00:13:09,400
I was a manager, true,

176
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:13,487
but I’ve always considered
myself to be blue collar.

177
00:13:16,073 --> 00:13:17,783
So, in that respect...

178
00:13:17,783 --> 00:13:21,245
I don’t think you
understood the question.

179
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:24,040
Namgu...

180
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,918
No, of course I
understand, my point is...

181
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:31,589
Namgu came to Papyrus first,
so you’ll learn from him, right?

182
00:13:31,797 --> 00:13:32,798
Of course!

183
00:13:33,758 --> 00:13:35,343
I am always learning.

184
00:13:35,801 --> 00:13:39,513
I got hired as soon as I
graduated from high school.

185
00:13:40,181 --> 00:13:44,727
But even while working, I
earned a chemistry degree.

186
00:13:44,727 --> 00:13:47,772
Of course, that was
at a distance university.

187
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:55,780
Of course after that
too, I kept... learning.

188
00:13:56,072 --> 00:13:59,033
And of course, safety management.

189
00:13:59,992 --> 00:14:07,333
When I received the 2019 ‘Pulp
Man of the Year’, it was that aspect

190
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:09,669
that they singled out in my record.

191
00:14:10,336 --> 00:14:13,089
And that same year,

192
00:14:13,089 --> 00:14:15,800
I finally bought my own home.

193
00:14:16,592 --> 00:14:19,595
The very house I was born in.

194
00:14:19,929 --> 00:14:21,180
Of course...

195
00:14:21,889 --> 00:14:24,433
I’m saying “of course”
too much, aren’t I?

196
00:14:26,811 --> 00:14:30,314
It’s not so much because I’m nervous,

197
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:35,027
but... self-confidence?
Assurance? That’s what it is.

198
00:14:35,569 --> 00:14:37,196
Of course!

199
00:14:41,617 --> 00:14:45,538
If you don’t mind, could you
tell me about your weak point?

200
00:14:49,709 --> 00:14:50,751
No.

201
00:14:57,174 --> 00:15:01,929
...is the one thing I can’t say,
that’s my biggest weak point!

202
00:15:07,351 --> 00:15:09,228
Have you looked into Moon Paper?

203
00:15:09,478 --> 00:15:10,479
Moon?

204
00:15:11,147 --> 00:15:16,235
They say Moon Paper has cracked
the Japanese market, look into it.

205
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:19,739
Pacific Paper is
restructuring this winter, too.

206
00:15:19,989 --> 00:15:20,614
Really?

207
00:15:21,615 --> 00:15:22,700
Go to a dentist, will you?

208
00:15:24,035 --> 00:15:25,202
Just go, okay?

209
00:15:26,412 --> 00:15:28,748
If you get hired, you’ll
be too busy to go.

210
00:15:28,748 --> 00:15:30,166
No, I’m fine.

211
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:32,918
There’s that pigheadedness of yours!

212
00:15:33,669 --> 00:15:37,298
Anyway, get hired before winter, okay?

213
00:15:37,673 --> 00:15:39,508
The company will call you soon.

214
00:15:40,676 --> 00:15:41,635
Thanks.

215
00:15:43,095 --> 00:15:45,514
Don’t forget, Moon Paper!

216
00:15:47,183 --> 00:15:49,602
I’m a man. I’m a good person.

<i>Founded by legendary
paper man Moon Changho,</i>

218
00:15:54,231 --> 00:15:55,316
<i>Choi Sun-chul, Line

219
00:15:55,316 --> 00:15:56,817

220
00:15:56,817 --> 00:15:57,651
<i>Yes?</i>

221
00:15:57,651 --> 00:16:01,530
<i>We agreed to talk
about how paper is made.</i>

222
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:02,281
<i>That’s what I’m...</i>

223
00:16:02,281 --> 00:16:04,283
<i>Leave the promotion

<i>6 hours 17 minutes later...</i>

225
00:16:06,535 --> 00:16:10,706
<i>Many people think paper companies
mindlessly raze entire forests, right?</i>

226
00:16:11,165 --> 00:16:12,291
<i>That’s not true.</i>

227
00:16:53,874 --> 00:16:54,375
What?

228
00:16:58,295 --> 00:16:59,797
First, the good news.

229
00:17:00,005 --> 00:17:02,383
I got a part time job.

230
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:04,677
Mom’s going out to work now!

231
00:17:04,677 --> 00:17:07,138
You always blamed
us for killing your career.

232
00:17:07,513 --> 00:17:08,430
Congrats, Mom!

233
00:17:08,597 --> 00:17:09,640
Congrats, Mom!

234
00:17:09,807 --> 00:17:11,100
Thanks.

235
00:17:11,434 --> 00:17:13,435
Where? A dental clinic?

236
00:17:13,853 --> 00:17:17,231
- Dr. Oh Chin-ho.
- Dr. Ouch In-ho?

237
00:17:17,231 --> 00:17:18,691
No jokes allowed.

238
00:17:19,107 --> 00:17:22,944
I’d like us all to face
the fact we’re in a crisis.

239
00:17:23,446 --> 00:17:26,781
Refrain from the listed
activities until Dad finds work.

240
00:17:26,781 --> 00:17:30,536
Except for Ri-one’s lessons,
anything nonessential must go.

241
00:17:31,162 --> 00:17:31,745
For example...

242
00:17:31,745 --> 00:17:33,247
For example, meat in the soup?

243
00:17:33,247 --> 00:17:35,749
There is some, look harder.

244
00:17:38,377 --> 00:17:39,503
For example,

245
00:17:39,795 --> 00:17:40,921
my car.

246
00:17:42,047 --> 00:17:44,467
We’ll trade your car
for something smaller.

247
00:17:46,844 --> 00:17:49,096
And our house.

248
00:17:54,768 --> 00:17:59,190
If we sell the house, we can pay
off our loans and rent an apartment.

249
00:18:01,567 --> 00:18:04,153
You said you’d find work in 3 months.

250
00:18:04,153 --> 00:18:08,657
So we kept living as usual,
dipping into your severance pay.

251
00:18:08,657 --> 00:18:11,118
Now that’s run dry.

252
00:18:17,249 --> 00:18:19,251
<i>House Foreclosure in 3 Months</i>

253
00:18:20,085 --> 00:18:21,212
Honey.

254
00:18:22,796 --> 00:18:24,173
This house...

255
00:18:28,219 --> 00:18:30,763
I have so many childhood
memories in this home.

256
00:18:32,306 --> 00:18:36,727
After turning 9, I moved
every 10 months on average.

257
00:18:36,894 --> 00:18:38,896
I worked so hard to buy back this home.

258
00:18:40,147 --> 00:18:41,440
I mean, we did.

259
00:18:42,858 --> 00:18:44,068
With my own hands,

260
00:18:44,068 --> 00:18:46,695
I tore down the old barn,
built the greenhouse...

261
00:18:46,695 --> 00:18:48,030
and the swing.

262
00:18:48,781 --> 00:18:50,699
Every corner of this home...

263
00:18:50,699 --> 00:18:51,700
Honey.

264
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:56,121

they’ll take it anyway.

carpet...

00:19:02,962 --> 00:19:04,588

272
00:19:04,588 --> 00:19:05,547
My racket, too.

273
00:19:05,547 --> 00:19:07,007
No more tennis.

274
00:19:07,007 --> 00:19:08,509
Let’s quit dance lessons, too.

275
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:10,344
Your bonsai magazine.

276
00:19:10,761 --> 00:19:12,721
And I’m canceling Netflix.

277
00:19:17,142 --> 00:19:18,018
Hey!

278
00:19:18,936 --> 00:19:21,522
Before it’s cancelled, I
should watch one more show.

279
00:19:25,442 --> 00:19:29,280
So comrades, now for the bad news.

280
00:19:29,697 --> 00:19:30,864
Something even worse?

281
00:19:31,031 --> 00:19:32,366
Something even worse?

282
00:19:36,787 --> 00:19:40,833
In these circumstances, we can’t
afford to feed so many mouths.

283
00:19:42,918 --> 00:19:44,795
What do you mean, so many?

284
00:19:45,337 --> 00:19:47,214
- Don’t go, Ri-two.
- Ri-one.

285
00:19:48,048 --> 00:19:49,133
Si-one.

286
00:19:49,133 --> 00:19:51,427
We’ll see them soon, okay Ri-one?

287
00:19:51,427 --> 00:19:52,886
Come on.

288
00:19:52,886 --> 00:19:56,432
You can come visit
them at our house. Okay?

289
00:19:56,432 --> 00:19:59,685
Si-two Ri-two will be back.
As soon as Dad gets hired.

290
00:20:11,822 --> 00:20:13,949
That dog hair is brutal.

291
00:20:13,949 --> 00:20:15,409
I’m sorry, Dad.

292
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:18,621
Have a safe drive.

293
00:20:20,873 --> 00:20:21,665
Let’s go in.

294
00:20:21,665 --> 00:20:22,666
Come on.

295
00:20:24,293 --> 00:20:26,712
I’ll bring them back soon, I will.

296
00:20:32,968 --> 00:20:34,303
Hello, ma’am!

297
00:20:34,303 --> 00:20:35,888
You’re here early!

298
00:20:37,723 --> 00:20:40,225
The potential buyer is that dickhead?

299
00:20:42,728 --> 00:20:45,648
Not bad for a 50-year-old house.

300
00:20:45,648 --> 00:20:47,066
Look at the curtains.

301
00:20:47,691 --> 00:20:51,612
They fixed up this
ruined house so well.

302
00:20:51,612 --> 00:20:53,280
It’s been born again.

303
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,200
- You know my townhouse near here?
- Yes.

304
00:20:56,367 --> 00:20:59,662
That land was originally
part of his dad’s pig farm.

305
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,539
Wow, if he still owned that land...

306
00:21:02,748 --> 00:21:06,377
If we tear down that greenhouse,
it’d make a great practice green.

307
00:21:09,129 --> 00:21:10,381
Disgusting pig.

308
00:21:11,048 --> 00:21:13,801
You’re quite the handyman, You Man-su.

309
00:21:18,889 --> 00:21:20,641
That’s enough for today.

310
00:21:22,142 --> 00:21:23,644
The moms are besties.

311
00:21:23,644 --> 00:21:25,354
The kids are besties.

312
00:21:28,691 --> 00:21:30,442

Imagine waking up and
seeing that sturdy red pine!

317
00:21:48,919 --> 00:21:50,003
It’s a white pine.

318
00:21:51,004 --> 00:21:52,005
White pine...

319
00:21:52,172 --> 00:21:54,842
Look around. I’ll stop
by the dry cleaners.

320
00:21:54,842 --> 00:21:56,760
Pick up my clothes for an interview.

You’re a Man! Su! Fight!

322
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:02,975
Shall we see the kids’ rooms?

323
00:22:04,768 --> 00:22:07,229
With just one kid, we’ll
use that as a closet.

324
00:22:07,229 --> 00:22:09,189
I thought that too!

325
00:22:10,983 --> 00:22:12,234
Nice mattress.

326
00:22:14,278 --> 00:22:16,196
That’s for sale too, buy it.

327
00:22:20,659 --> 00:22:22,161

328
00:22:23,203 --> 00:22:25,080

00:22:26,331 --> 00:22:27,749
Hope you don’t go far.

00:22:30,002 --> 00:22:33,005
If we leave, Si-two Ri-two
won’t be able to find us.

331
00:22:33,213 --> 00:22:34,256
Says who?

332

We’re not leaving.

What’s going on? Who’s this?

344
00:23:11,668 --> 00:23:13,670
He was fired from Solar.

345
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:14,922
Just a sec.

346
00:23:17,591 --> 00:23:18,383
Come out.

347
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:21,470
I’m sorry.

348
00:23:21,804 --> 00:23:22,763
Going to the meeting?

349
00:23:22,763 --> 00:23:24,348
I wanted to talk to you.

350
00:23:24,348 --> 00:23:25,140
Sure, then.

351
00:23:32,231 --> 00:23:34,191
Let me look...

352
00:23:34,483 --> 00:23:36,401
God, you’re strong.

353
00:23:40,781 --> 00:23:42,866
If you have any shame,

354
00:23:43,534 --> 00:23:46,453
don’t do this in a place
where people shit and piss.

355
00:23:50,082 --> 00:23:51,208
Sir!

356
00:23:51,875 --> 00:23:55,128
I told you to come visit me!
We’ll have a nice barbecue.

357
00:23:55,128 --> 00:23:57,130
All right, then.

Oh my.

359
00:24:12,563 --> 00:24:13,772
Listen.

360
00:24:14,856 --> 00:24:19,653
On the hill opposite, there’s a
nice whisky bar called Moon Shine.

361
00:24:20,237 --> 00:24:21,864

<i>Ms. Wife</i>

370
00:25:03,155 --> 00:25:04,114
Hi honey.

371
00:25:04,114 --> 00:25:07,117
<i>Listen, the cello teacher called...</i>

372
00:25:07,826 --> 00:25:09,661
<i>- Where are you?</i>
- Huh?

373
00:25:11,663 --> 00:25:13,290
<i>- Are you in a bar?</i>
- No no.

374
00:25:14,082 --> 00:25:15,876
Well, it’s true.

375
00:25:16,835 --> 00:25:17,920
It’s true, but I’m not.

376
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,921
Look.

377
00:25:20,797 --> 00:25:21,798
I’m by myself.

378
00:25:21,798 --> 00:25:22,841
<i>Have you gone mad?</i>

379
00:25:23,592 --> 00:25:25,677
- I’m drinking this, really.
<i>- Whisky?</i>

380
00:25:26,178 --> 00:25:27,471
This here.

381
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,682
<i>You went to a bar to drink apple juice?</i>

382
00:25:31,016 --> 00:25:33,810
Honey, you trust me?

383
00:25:36,521 --> 00:25:38,357
<i>Of course.</i>

384
00:25:38,357 --> 00:25:39,608
Why’d the cello teacher call?

385
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:45,822
I can’t teach Ri-one anymore.

386
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,033
What?

387
00:25:48,033 --> 00:25:50,661
Ri-one’s talent is too...

388
00:25:51,161 --> 00:25:52,329
outstanding?

389
00:25:58,085 --> 00:25:59,503
But ma’am,

390
00:26:00,921 --> 00:26:04,383
how can I believe you?

391
00:26:05,258 --> 00:26:09,179
She doesn’t play for us.

392
00:26:09,888 --> 00:26:13,558
We’ve never heard
anything but a few notes.

393
00:26:13,976 --> 00:26:14,601
Right.

394
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:20,857
Why do you think I’d give up
my lesson fee to another teacher?

395
00:26:21,191 --> 00:26:22,359
Another teacher?

396
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:25,612
Ri-one needs to learn
from a music professor now.

397
00:26:27,239 --> 00:26:31,326
But you should know, the fee
is on a different level than mine.

398
00:26:35,205 --> 00:26:40,794
You said you wanted Ri-one
to be able to live independently.

399
00:26:44,965 --> 00:26:47,300
If so, this level of investment...

400
00:26:47,926 --> 00:26:50,137
<i>I’ll say two things.</i>

401
00:26:50,971 --> 00:26:55,517
<i>Many people think paper companies
mindlessly raze entire forests, right?</i>

402
00:26:55,517 --> 00:26:56,977
<i>That’s not true.</i>

403
00:26:56,977 --> 00:27:00,355
<i>Trees for paper are
grown separately, cut,</i>

404
00:27:00,355 --> 00:27:04,026
<i>planted again, grown and cut again.</i>

405
00:27:04,818 --> 00:27:07,529
<i>And that’s not all. There’s reuse.</i>

406
00:27:07,529 --> 00:27:09,865
<i>We collect waste paper, recycle it,</i>

407
00:27:11,033 --> 00:27:14,536
<i>- then collect it again and—</i>
- What are you watching?

408
00:27:17,456 --> 00:27:20,208
The only company doing
well these days is Moon Paper.

409
00:27:20,459 --> 00:27:23,962
They cracked the Japanese market.
He’s line manager of specialty paper.

410
00:27:25,005 --> 00:27:27,883
A perfect job for you.
You’re good at Japanese, too.

411
00:27:29,593 --> 00:27:33,388
<i>Korea’s the most advanced
country in paper reuse.</i>

412
00:27:35,515 --> 00:27:36,683
<i>Unlimited reuse!</i>

413
00:27:37,058 --> 00:27:38,560
<i>Freaking unlimited reuse!</i>

414
00:27:38,894 --> 00:27:40,896
Compared to my husband, he’s nothing.

415
00:27:43,899 --> 00:27:45,734
Can’t he get hit by lightning?

416
00:27:46,651 --> 00:27:49,488
Pointy umbrella in a thunderstorm...

00:28:42,124 --> 00:28:44,459

419
00:28:46,169 --> 00:28:48,421
Try living there just one week.

420
00:28:51,424 --> 00:28:54,135
An apartment can’t even compare!

421
00:28:58,348 --> 00:29:00,976
Come on, the ferry runs so often!

422
00:29:03,603 --> 00:29:04,855
I’m telling you.

423
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:09,359
I know that, but it’s so quiet there.

424
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:11,820
Air’s clean, it’s fabulous.

425
00:29:13,697 --> 00:29:16,283
Even more fabulous at night...

426
00:29:29,421 --> 00:29:30,297
Right.

427
00:29:33,383 --> 00:29:35,218
No, there aren’t any!

428
00:29:36,136 --> 00:29:40,348
If you’re scared, we’ll raise
chickens. They eat snakes.

429
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,601
What?

430
00:29:43,143 --> 00:29:45,145
Listen, honey...

431
00:29:46,605 --> 00:29:49,149
For once, at least come for a barbecue!

432
00:29:50,358 --> 00:29:53,695
Pork! Who roasts snakes?

433
00:29:57,407 --> 00:29:59,618
No alcohol, of course.

434
00:30:37,989 --> 00:30:39,240
Weight lifting?

435
00:30:44,287 --> 00:30:45,789
Honey! Honey!

436
00:30:52,504 --> 00:30:54,798
Even if this guy disappears,

437
00:30:54,798 --> 00:30:56,967
it’s not like I can take his place.

438
00:30:58,176 --> 00:30:59,135
Right?

439
00:31:00,595 --> 00:31:02,555
What’s so great about that spot?

440
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:14,734
The competition for
the place will be fierce.

441
00:31:15,318 --> 00:31:17,654
Actually, it is a pretty nice spot.

442
00:31:18,071 --> 00:31:20,115
Lots of sun, nice breeze.

443
00:31:20,699 --> 00:31:21,825
Right...

00:32:10,999 --> 00:32:12,542
This is Pulp Men.

451
00:32:12,542 --> 00:32:14,836

452
00:32:15,712 --> 00:32:16,546
Hey.

453
00:32:16,963 --> 00:32:19,799
At least give me those pajamas to wash.

454
00:32:20,383 --> 00:32:22,385
And take a shower this century!

455
00:32:23,928 --> 00:32:26,097
And will you let our pear tree die?

456
00:32:26,264 --> 00:32:28,266
Bugs are swarming all over it.

457
00:32:29,309 --> 00:32:32,020
Hey! You want me dead, too?

458
00:32:47,952 --> 00:32:49,704
Too drunk to feel pain?

459
00:32:49,954 --> 00:32:52,916
You’re practically paralyzed!

460
00:32:52,916 --> 00:32:55,710
It’s because of all those bugs.

461
00:32:56,086 --> 00:32:58,755

You quit drinking, and
now you’ll eat anything?

Suddenly, from who knows where,

540
00:42:04,884 --> 00:42:06,928
like a streetlight turning on,

541
00:42:06,928 --> 00:42:08,179
your face...

542
00:42:10,473 --> 00:42:15,478
<i>Please light a flame</i>

543
00:42:17,897 --> 00:42:21,943
<i>in my lonely heart...</i>

544
00:42:22,276 --> 00:42:23,486
Smiling,

545
00:42:24,278 --> 00:42:25,821
you lead me to the door.

546
00:42:26,155 --> 00:42:29,241
“Ara, follow me. Only me.”

547
00:42:31,118 --> 00:42:32,244
“Watch your step.”

548
00:42:35,247 --> 00:42:36,332
“Are you okay?”

549
00:42:37,458 --> 00:42:40,211
I was at my most innocent then.

550
00:42:42,129 --> 00:42:43,881
Plump and pretty.

551
00:42:44,674 --> 00:42:46,968
I let you have my first kiss.

552
00:42:53,391 --> 00:42:55,059
Remember what you said?

553
00:42:58,562 --> 00:43:02,858
“Ara, your lips are softer than
the highest quality Okamoto

554
00:43:04,068 --> 00:43:05,111
tracing paper.”

555
00:43:06,112 --> 00:43:07,780
Akimoto.

556
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:09,448
Okamoto is a condom brand.

557
00:43:10,658 --> 00:43:12,201
“Ara, your lips

558
00:43:12,201 --> 00:43:15,579
are softer than the highest
quality Akimoto tracing paper.”

559
00:43:25,089 --> 00:43:27,800
No message, no email.

560
00:43:28,050 --> 00:43:29,969
Paper, paper! Damned paper!

561
00:43:30,553 --> 00:43:33,347
My dad kept offering
to set you up with a café,

562
00:43:33,347 --> 00:43:35,141
but no, it had to be paper!

563
00:43:35,683 --> 00:43:39,937
Even if they hire you, you’ll
retire in 6-7 years. What then?

564
00:43:40,354 --> 00:43:42,023
In an age of living to 100?

565
00:43:42,023 --> 00:43:44,316
You with your nice audio system,

566
00:43:44,316 --> 00:43:46,485
you could earn even
more with a music café!

567
00:43:46,902 --> 00:43:48,362
Know how I feel lately?

568
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:52,825
I want to run through the
mountains, wailing like a madwoman!

569
00:43:54,493 --> 00:43:57,913
I’m like one of your
precious paper machines.

570
00:43:57,913 --> 00:43:59,749
Neglect me, and I’ll break!

571
00:43:59,749 --> 00:44:03,169
Hurry up and smother
me in that lube oil!

572
00:44:03,836 --> 00:44:07,798
Or I’ll rip you to pieces.
Like tracing paper!

573
00:44:09,133 --> 00:44:11,260
Paper has fed me for 25 years.

574
00:44:12,428 --> 00:44:13,387
Honey.

575
00:44:14,346 --> 00:44:16,974
It’s how I’m meant to
be, I’ve no other choice.

576
00:44:17,308 --> 00:44:20,186
You’ve been fed by the
money I earned from paper, too.

577
00:44:21,103 --> 00:44:23,147
That money was printed on paper I made,

578
00:44:23,522 --> 00:44:26,150
and the cigarette filter
you smoke is paper, too.

579
00:44:28,027 --> 00:44:30,279
If we don’t use paper, who will?

580
00:44:30,279 --> 00:44:30,988
What?

581
00:44:33,115 --> 00:44:34,950
They won’t send a text or email.

582
00:44:35,618 --> 00:44:37,119
The mailbox! The mailbox!

583
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:37,745
Hey!

584
00:44:38,204 --> 00:44:38,871
Hey!

585
00:44:40,581 --> 00:44:42,625
I’m through with you!

586
00:44:43,042 --> 00:44:43,876
You...

587
00:44:44,877 --> 00:44:47,338
As useless as scrap paper!

588
00:44:49,465 --> 00:44:51,008
Sorry to keep you waiting.

589
00:44:52,510 --> 00:44:56,847
- I’ll check before the doctor comes.
- Yes.

590
00:44:58,808 --> 00:45:00,142
You’re a nurse?

591
00:45:00,935 --> 00:45:03,687
Dental hygienist. It’s different.

592
00:45:06,106 --> 00:45:08,359
Don’t you have dance class now?

593
00:45:08,359 --> 00:45:10,486
My tooth hurts too much.

594
00:45:11,821 --> 00:45:13,656
Then say “ah”.

595
00:45:16,534 --> 00:45:18,744
You’ll come to the dance party, though?

596
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:22,081
How can I? I quit the lessons.

597
00:45:22,081 --> 00:45:25,292
You can still come! Ask the teacher.

598
00:45:25,292 --> 00:45:27,211
Ms. Lee, go on home.

599
00:45:27,211 --> 00:45:28,879
You need to pick up Ri-one.

600
00:45:28,879 --> 00:45:29,713
Yes.

601
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:35,135
You were a thing pure,
noble, honest, without stain!

602
00:45:35,135 --> 00:45:37,012
And now – oh!

603
00:45:37,012 --> 00:45:40,474
When I think that I made
of a man like you my ideal!

604
00:45:40,474 --> 00:45:43,227
Dear me! The ideal of my life!

605
00:45:46,564 --> 00:45:47,898
Fucking snake!

606
00:45:51,610 --> 00:45:53,362
Was its head triangle-shaped?

607
00:45:54,321 --> 00:45:56,949
Then it’s a cannibal viper.
It’ll eat its own mother.

608
00:45:58,117 --> 00:46:00,369
Or was it a black-and-white pattern?

609
00:46:00,369 --> 00:46:03,747
Then it’s a 7-step mamushi.
You’ll die before taking 7 steps.

610
00:46:03,747 --> 00:46:05,624
I think I heard a rattle, too.

611
00:46:06,959 --> 00:46:09,628
Keep the bite wound
higher than your heart.

612
00:46:13,716 --> 00:46:15,217
Shouldn’t it be lower?

613
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:19,805
Don’t worry. I did this in a play once.

614
00:46:20,055 --> 00:46:21,056
Did what?

615
00:46:48,417 --> 00:46:50,085
<i>- Honey, know what?</i>
- Listen...

616
00:46:50,544 --> 00:46:52,004
A snake just bit me.

617
00:46:52,004 --> 00:46:54,256
<i>- What?</i>
- Might be poisonous, I’ll call you back.

618
00:47:09,521 --> 00:47:12,316
Chase the snakes away like this.

619
00:47:13,234 --> 00:47:14,234
Damn it!

620
00:47:14,818 --> 00:47:18,197
1. Keep bite lower than heart.
2. Don’t cut, or suck out poison.

621
00:47:20,157 --> 00:47:21,242
For god’s sake!

622
00:47:22,201 --> 00:47:23,911
Shouldn’t you go to the hospital?

623
00:47:24,453 --> 00:47:25,329
It’s okay.

624
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:28,457
If it were poisonous, I’d be dead now.

625
00:47:38,884 --> 00:47:39,969
What’s with you?

626
00:47:43,555 --> 00:47:45,516
About the dance party...

627
00:47:45,933 --> 00:47:50,020
We better not go, right?
We quit the lessons.

628
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:52,815
What? But we practiced so much.

629
00:47:56,485 --> 00:47:58,737
It’s from the first
mixtape you gave me.

630
00:47:58,737 --> 00:48:02,074
For a guy who only
listens to '80s rock.

631
00:48:02,574 --> 00:48:04,368
I was blinded by love.

632
00:48:05,035 --> 00:48:07,579
I think I was prettiest back then.

633
00:48:07,913 --> 00:48:10,374
Even if I was a divorcee with a kid.

634
00:48:10,374 --> 00:48:12,376
Hey, don’t talk like that.

635
00:48:12,710 --> 00:48:15,421
Of course, I earned
more money than you.

636
00:48:16,630 --> 00:48:17,589
What?

637
00:48:17,923 --> 00:48:20,634
You think I proposed
because of your paycheck?

638
00:48:20,968 --> 00:48:23,637
Who knows? I had a college degree too.

639
00:48:24,847 --> 00:48:26,890
- So did I.
- Not back then.

640
00:48:29,184 --> 00:48:31,186
You’re so mean. Forget it.

641
00:48:31,770 --> 00:48:35,399
You were busy doing the
distance degree while working.

642
00:48:35,399 --> 00:48:37,776
I wanted so much to
have fun with you then.

643
00:48:37,776 --> 00:48:41,113
Apologize, will you? Right now.

644
00:48:41,113 --> 00:48:42,156
You’re right.

645
00:48:42,698 --> 00:48:47,703
Let’s have 10 times more fun now
instead of wasting time complaining.

646
00:48:48,912 --> 00:48:50,831
When should we tell Si-one?

647
00:48:51,832 --> 00:48:53,083
Tell him what?

648
00:48:53,667 --> 00:48:56,754
We agreed to tell him when
he’s old enough to shave.

649
00:48:58,130 --> 00:49:00,174
But do we have to tell him?

650
00:49:01,175 --> 00:49:03,719
I’ve been his dad since
he was 2, so I’m his dad.

651
00:49:09,350 --> 00:49:10,726
I’m sorry, Miri.

652
00:49:11,685 --> 00:49:15,356
You must want some
lube oil too. I’ve been so...

653
00:49:16,648 --> 00:49:18,192
Lube oil?

654
00:49:19,818 --> 00:49:21,111
It’s not that.

655
00:49:22,237 --> 00:49:26,033
I’ve just been so busy these
days with job interviews.

656
00:49:26,742 --> 00:49:28,702
Does it have to be paper?

657
00:49:29,203 --> 00:49:30,871
How about some other job?

658
00:49:32,164 --> 00:49:33,248
What?

659
00:49:33,916 --> 00:49:35,000
Like a café?

660
00:49:36,210 --> 00:49:37,586
Why a café?

661
00:49:38,712 --> 00:49:41,423
Paper has fed me for 25 years, honey.

662
00:49:42,216 --> 00:49:44,259
It’s how I’m meant to be.

663
00:49:45,177 --> 00:49:46,178
Think about it,

664
00:49:46,595 --> 00:49:50,140
would you tell a cannibal
viper to live off pear leaves?

665
00:49:50,516 --> 00:49:53,060
It’s meant to eat its mother.

666
00:49:56,563 --> 00:49:59,775
- Is that so, Mr. You?
- Yes.

667
00:49:59,983 --> 00:50:01,735
- Mr. You.
- Yes?

668
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:03,445
You’re not a bad dancer.

669
00:50:04,363 --> 00:50:05,948
Follow me. Only me.

670
00:50:07,157 --> 00:50:09,701
Guess you overdid the vibrato.

671
00:50:25,801 --> 00:50:28,095
This will be the best
job interview ever.

672
00:50:28,428 --> 00:50:29,888
Slay them all!

673
00:50:30,514 --> 00:50:32,891
Okay, I’ll slay them all.

674
00:50:33,058 --> 00:50:34,476
Green light!

675
00:51:07,634 --> 00:51:08,802
Chun-oh!

676
00:51:09,678 --> 00:51:10,929
Chun-oh!

677
00:51:17,186 --> 00:51:22,024
Doing it on your bed is great,
ma’am. It doesn’t even creak.

678
00:51:22,024 --> 00:51:24,651
Don’t call me ma’am!

679
00:51:24,651 --> 00:51:27,821
Tell your husband not to quit

680
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:31,867
that group for quitting
drinking. This is great.

681
00:52:10,781 --> 00:52:12,032
<i>Minsan City...</i>

682
00:52:32,135 --> 00:52:35,264
Hello, this is Red Pepper Paper.

683
00:52:35,264 --> 00:52:36,557
<i>Oh, hello!</i>

684
00:52:37,182 --> 00:52:39,017
- Hey, don’t!
<i>- What?</i>

685
00:52:39,017 --> 00:52:41,228
Yes? Hello? What was that?

686
00:52:41,812 --> 00:52:43,230
I’m having trouble hearing you.

687
00:52:44,106 --> 00:52:45,399
<i>I can hear you fine.</i>

688
00:52:45,399 --> 00:52:47,985
I heard well from the spot
where you first answered.

689
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:52,114
<i>I see! I’m heading there now.</i>

690
00:52:52,281 --> 00:52:53,115
Stop!

691
00:52:53,365 --> 00:52:54,866
That spot is perfect.

692
00:52:55,909 --> 00:52:57,577
You can hear best from here?

693
00:52:57,577 --> 00:52:59,538
<i>Yes, I can hear you great now.</i>

694
00:53:00,330 --> 00:53:03,709
By any chance are you at
your home in Minsan City?

695
00:53:04,584 --> 00:53:05,460
I am.

696
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:07,546
My boss would like to meet you.

697
00:53:08,338 --> 00:53:10,966
<i>He’s very curious about you, Mr. Gu.</i>

698
00:53:11,633 --> 00:53:13,010
- However...
<i>- Yes?</i>

699
00:53:13,010 --> 00:53:17,806
My boss is returning
to Zurich on a 5pm flight.

700
00:53:18,849 --> 00:53:23,979
I’m sorry, but if you leave from
Minsan right now, you should have time.

701
00:53:25,564 --> 00:53:26,606
<i>Right now?</i>

702
00:53:26,898 --> 00:53:28,859
Guess it’s too much to ask?

703
00:53:29,901 --> 00:53:33,488
Okay, then I’ll tell him you’re not...

704
00:53:33,488 --> 00:53:35,032
No, no!

705
00:53:35,574 --> 00:53:36,450
I can go.

706
00:53:36,950 --> 00:53:39,369
Of course! I’ll go.

707
00:53:39,745 --> 00:53:41,538
<i>Then I’ll text you right now</i>

708
00:53:41,830 --> 00:53:45,167
with the address of our
office, so please set off now.

709
00:53:45,167 --> 00:53:46,835
Of course, yes.

710
00:53:50,339 --> 00:53:53,759
I’ll just change
clothes quickly and go.

711
00:53:53,759 --> 00:53:55,093
Text me the address!

712
00:53:55,093 --> 00:53:57,095
No, no! You’re fine as you...

713
00:54:57,656 --> 00:54:58,782
Bitch...

714
00:54:58,782 --> 00:55:01,660
<i>No New Messages</i>

715
00:55:12,879 --> 00:55:14,089
Please answer...

716
00:55:22,806 --> 00:55:23,974
Come on, pick up.

717
00:55:44,870 --> 00:55:47,956
Hey, how are you? Busy?

718
00:55:48,665 --> 00:55:49,666
Bad reception?

719
00:55:50,709 --> 00:55:53,253
No way! The signal’s best here.

720
00:55:54,129 --> 00:55:55,297
You hear me, right?

721
00:55:55,839 --> 00:56:00,302
Well, I went to some gathering
without seeing that it got cancelled.

722
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:03,722
So I came back early, and
now I’m feeling so bored.

723
00:56:05,056 --> 00:56:05,807
My wife?

724
00:56:07,476 --> 00:56:08,268
Not sure.

725
00:56:10,687 --> 00:56:11,771
Maybe she went out.

726
00:56:14,649 --> 00:56:16,485
Want to catch up over a drink?

727
00:56:18,069 --> 00:56:23,200
I quit, sure, but now it’s under
control. I can drink reasonably.

728
00:56:25,660 --> 00:56:26,495
Exactly!

729
00:56:27,746 --> 00:56:29,831
See you at the fried chicken place.

730
00:56:30,832 --> 00:56:34,211
Come when you finish
work. I’ll wait there.

731
00:56:48,099 --> 00:56:50,519

732
00:56:53,355 --> 00:56:54,814
- Hello.
- Yeah.

733
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:02,447
- Hi Ri-one.
- You’re late.

734
00:57:13,291 --> 00:57:14,834
I’ll throw it out.

735
00:57:15,377 --> 00:57:16,419
Thank you.

736
00:57:21,049 --> 00:57:23,969
I waited to say hello
to you. I’m Oh Chin-ho.

737
00:57:24,636 --> 00:57:26,179
You’ve got a bad toothache?

738
00:57:26,179 --> 00:57:26,763
Yeah.

739
00:57:27,097 --> 00:57:28,139
Stop by some time.

740
00:57:29,266 --> 00:57:31,852
- Could you lower the window?
- I’m okay.

741
00:57:32,102 --> 00:57:33,770
I’m totally fine, Mr. Oh Chun-oh.

742
00:57:35,605 --> 00:57:38,483
Thank you, Doctor Oh. Chin. Ho.

743
00:57:38,775 --> 00:57:39,484
Thanks!

744
00:57:40,235 --> 00:57:41,319
Go home now.

745
00:57:47,033 --> 00:57:48,493
Goddamned embarrassing...

746
00:57:54,958 --> 00:57:57,669
Ri-one, it’s okay now.

747
00:57:57,669 --> 00:58:00,589
Dad’s not a very
smooth driver, that’s all.

748
00:58:01,548 --> 00:58:04,467
He’s young. Quite an age gap.

749
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:06,094
Age gap?

750
00:58:07,971 --> 00:58:08,847
With who?

751
00:58:08,847 --> 00:58:11,391

and suddenly,

01:00:50,216 --> 01:00:50,675
What!

787
01:00:51,134 --> 01:00:52,510

01:01:08,568 --> 01:01:09,611
What’s wrong with a music café?

796
01:01:15,784 --> 01:01:18,620
She even told you that?

797
01:01:21,539 --> 01:01:23,416
If you can’t earn
money, sell the house!

798
01:01:24,918 --> 01:01:26,795
Work at a retail store moving boxes!

799
01:01:27,879 --> 01:01:29,506
I’m an engineer!

800
01:01:30,173 --> 01:01:31,090
An expert!

801
01:01:33,802 --> 01:01:34,385
The house...

802
01:01:35,553 --> 01:01:37,013
is Ara’s father’s, so I can’t sell it.

803
01:01:38,807 --> 01:01:39,390
The boxes...

804
01:01:41,392 --> 01:01:43,311
hurt my back, so I can’t lift them!

805
01:01:44,145 --> 01:01:45,188
You proud of that?

806
01:01:53,404 --> 01:01:54,989
If you found out, tell me!

807
01:01:55,365 --> 01:01:56,491
Why not say something?

808
01:02:15,426 --> 01:02:16,261
And if I do?

809
01:02:17,428 --> 01:02:19,055
Will you come back?

810
01:02:19,055 --> 01:02:19,681
Huh?

811
01:02:19,931 --> 01:02:21,724
Snake bite! You fucker!

812
01:02:28,690 --> 01:02:29,232

813
01:02:29,399 --> 01:02:29,941

The gun!

816
01:03:22,827 --> 01:03:24,329
Give me the gun!

817
01:03:24,704 --> 01:03:26,080
I’m an ex-Marine!

818
01:03:51,064 --> 01:03:52,357
Losing my job

819
01:03:53,233 --> 01:03:55,401
is not my choice.

820
01:03:55,401 --> 01:03:57,195
How many times must I say it?

821
01:03:58,279 --> 01:04:01,240
Losing your job isn’t the problem!

822
01:04:01,491 --> 01:04:06,829
The problem is how you deal with it!

823
01:04:12,752 --> 01:04:14,170
Oh, come on...

824
01:04:16,714 --> 01:04:18,675

828
01:05:33,791 --> 01:05:35,626

Yep?

830
01:05:39,589 --> 01:05:41,257

- Did Mom leave me a costume?
<i>- Yep.</i>

839

01:06:41,401 --> 01:06:42,902
You don’t know the dance.

843
01:06:43,236 --> 01:06:45,071
Sure I know it.

844
01:06:46,155 --> 01:06:47,824
I memorized it, watching now.

845
01:06:48,908 --> 01:06:50,451
You said you practiced a lot.

846
01:06:51,828 --> 01:06:53,204
Got to show it off.

847
01:07:19,438 --> 01:07:22,441

01:07:29,657 --> 01:07:31,075
No, I don’t!

850
01:07:31,075 --> 01:07:33,452

851
01:07:34,370 --> 01:07:35,705
Nice!

You like it in the car.

856
01:10:10,484 --> 01:10:12,903
You wore the black
fishnet panties? Rose lace?

857

01:10:24,040 --> 01:10:25,124

You are! Take them off.

861

It’ll just take a second!

You can’t!

866
01:10:54,570 --> 01:10:56,656
We can’t go through that again!

You don’t discriminate. You’re
a dog to everyone when drunk.

What were you thinking?

878
01:11:51,043 --> 01:11:53,045
Matching your costume with Dr. Ouch.

You forgot? We watched
it a million times with her!

When I told Dr. Oh I’d be Pocahontas,

885
01:12:16,861 --> 01:12:19,697
the whole clinic decided
to be Native Americans!

886
01:12:20,030 --> 01:12:22,491
The nurse there was
dressed as one, too!

887
01:12:22,491 --> 01:12:26,287
You and I were meant to be a pair!

888

You think I’m that kind of person?

889
01:12:30,207 --> 01:12:32,126
How can you suspect me?

890
01:12:32,501 --> 01:12:34,462
Sure I can suspect you!

I’m fighting a war, for our family.

That damned greenhouse!

900
01:13:06,827 --> 01:13:10,998

901
01:13:11,916 --> 01:13:13,250
Why bring rubber pants?

902
01:13:13,751 --> 01:13:16,337
How can you get a
snakebite at a job interview?

903
01:13:16,337 --> 01:13:19,131
How stupid do you think I am?

904
01:13:19,131 --> 01:13:20,716
Tell me! Who is she?

905
01:13:21,300 --> 01:13:23,260
The bitch you go fishing
and eat chicken with,

906
01:13:23,260 --> 01:13:25,471
having sex smothered in lube oil!

907
01:13:27,181 --> 01:13:28,933
Honey, don’t do this to me.

908
01:13:30,142 --> 01:13:31,727
My job interviews,

909
01:13:32,853 --> 01:13:35,564
they’re really difficult interviews.

910
01:13:36,482 --> 01:13:39,026
Looking someone right in the eye...

911
01:13:39,777 --> 01:13:43,113
Doing that is really hard.

912
01:13:47,868 --> 01:13:49,411
You don’t deny it?

913
01:14:13,310 --> 01:14:15,312
<i>Drink with colleagues, work talk</i>

914
01:14:17,273 --> 01:14:18,607
How is this?

915
01:14:19,733 --> 01:14:21,902
This is a softer material.

916
01:14:21,902 --> 01:14:23,362
Not really.

917
01:14:29,076 --> 01:14:30,119
Just a moment.

918
01:14:30,786 --> 01:14:32,496
Yeni, what is it?

919
01:14:32,496 --> 01:14:35,708
Can I hang out with my
friends after art lessons?

920
01:14:39,628 --> 01:14:42,673
- Min’s dad will drive you?
- Yes.

921
01:14:42,673 --> 01:14:44,091
These are no good, either.

922
01:14:44,258 --> 01:14:45,676
Yes, just a minute.

923
01:14:46,427 --> 01:14:48,137
I have a pair that you’ll like.

924
01:14:51,098 --> 01:14:51,890
Go on, go!

925
01:14:53,642 --> 01:14:55,185
It’s a brand new item, so...

926
01:14:55,185 --> 01:14:56,228
Never mind, mister.

927
01:14:56,228 --> 01:14:56,979
Wait.

928
01:14:59,273 --> 01:15:00,941
Just a second.

929
01:15:00,941 --> 01:15:02,860
Don’t go yet.

930
01:15:06,614 --> 01:15:10,367
Headquarters only sends us a few pairs.

931
01:15:11,118 --> 01:15:12,536
Just a moment.

932
01:15:13,621 --> 01:15:14,872
I’ll be right there.

933
01:15:21,795 --> 01:15:23,213
Sir!

934
01:15:25,799 --> 01:15:27,801
So the other man left?

935
01:15:30,596 --> 01:15:31,597
Seems so.

936
01:15:33,140 --> 01:15:34,767
Sorry to keep you waiting.

937
01:15:35,601 --> 01:15:37,353
Shoes for yourself?

938
01:15:37,937 --> 01:15:38,979
Or a gift?

939
01:15:40,481 --> 01:15:41,982
I’ve got a daughter, too.

940
01:15:41,982 --> 01:15:43,567
How old is she?

941
01:15:45,653 --> 01:15:46,570
Come in.

942
01:16:07,675 --> 01:16:08,884
You miss it, right?

943
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:12,262
Having a drink with
colleagues, talking about work?

944
01:16:14,431 --> 01:16:17,017
It’s been over a year for me too,

945
01:16:17,643 --> 01:16:20,312
so I recognize an
unemployed comrade at once.

946
01:16:21,647 --> 01:16:23,899
You don’t look like a man for this job.

947
01:16:26,193 --> 01:16:27,361
Ten years old.

948
01:16:28,696 --> 01:16:29,863
Your daughter!

949
01:16:30,864 --> 01:16:32,449
What kind of shoes?

950
01:16:32,449 --> 01:16:33,867
Boots? Sandals?

951
01:16:34,827 --> 01:16:37,538
- Enamel shoes. Quite shiny.
- Yes.

952
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:39,748
I worked in the paper industry.

953
01:16:40,499 --> 01:16:41,583
Specialty paper.

954
01:16:42,042 --> 01:16:44,837
We made banknotes, lottery tickets...

955
01:16:45,838 --> 01:16:47,965
invoices, passports,
ice cream cone sleeves,

956
01:16:47,965 --> 01:16:51,051
menstrual pad release
paper, cigarette filters...

957
01:16:51,051 --> 01:16:53,053
People laugh when I say this,

958
01:16:54,471 --> 01:16:59,893
but for those of us who make
it, white paper is a kind of art.

959
01:17:01,645 --> 01:17:03,063
Why laugh?

960
01:17:03,605 --> 01:17:05,816
That feeling of touching fine paper

961
01:17:06,900 --> 01:17:08,402
is so comforting.

962
01:17:09,862 --> 01:17:11,864
You’ve got fine senses, I see.

963
01:17:12,656 --> 01:17:15,451
My daughter hardly ever speaks.

964
01:17:17,202 --> 01:17:20,664
When she does, it’s
to echo others’ words.

965
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:26,420
She was born that way.
She only plays cello.

966
01:17:28,130 --> 01:17:29,923
Her teacher says she’s gifted.

967
01:17:30,799 --> 01:17:33,969
Might even become world famous.

968
01:17:35,679 --> 01:17:38,056
But she won’t play for us.

969
01:17:39,141 --> 01:17:41,977
As parents, we should
support her talent,

970
01:17:43,479 --> 01:17:46,356
because without music
she’ll never be independent.

971
01:17:46,523 --> 01:17:52,029
Her teacher said she needs to
be playing on a $50,000 cello.

972
01:17:52,780 --> 01:17:55,449
She’ll give a recital this Christmas,

973
01:17:56,158 --> 01:17:59,745
but she only has rain boots.

974
01:18:00,871 --> 01:18:04,541
I can’t buy her an instrument,
at least I’ll get her shoes.

975
01:18:05,167 --> 01:18:06,293
Wait.

976
01:18:07,544 --> 01:18:11,924
Her lesson finishes soon.
Maybe I’ll bring her to try them on.

977
01:18:11,924 --> 01:18:13,133
When do you close?

978
01:18:13,133 --> 01:18:14,885
You can come any time before 7.

979
01:18:14,885 --> 01:18:17,179
Her lesson won’t finish by 7.

980
01:18:17,179 --> 01:18:18,972
It takes me an hour to clean up.

981
01:18:19,640 --> 01:18:21,016
I’ll wait, then.

982
01:18:21,225 --> 01:18:22,309
8 o’clock!

983
01:18:25,020 --> 01:18:30,025
I can only get a commission
if you buy through me.

984
01:18:30,567 --> 01:18:31,527
Yes.

985
01:18:51,338 --> 01:18:52,464
No other choice.

986
01:18:53,966 --> 01:18:55,259
No other choice.

987
01:18:55,592 --> 01:18:56,927
No other choice.

988
01:18:57,136 --> 01:18:58,470
No other choice.

989
01:18:59,096 --> 01:19:00,472
No other choice.

990
01:19:08,147 --> 01:19:10,023
What are you doing here?

991
01:19:10,357 --> 01:19:12,943
You haven’t been able
to pick up your daughter?

992
01:19:12,943 --> 01:19:16,363
Think it has to be towed.
It’s so expensive, though.

993
01:19:17,531 --> 01:19:20,409
Then, the money for the shoes...

994
01:19:25,706 --> 01:19:27,541
<i>I’m a machine repairman...</i>

995
01:19:27,541 --> 01:19:30,794
Let’s see if my skills are any use.

996
01:19:30,794 --> 01:19:33,964
My beloved Elantra, no less!

997
01:19:34,965 --> 01:19:37,885
My, without your glasses,
you look like a model.

998
01:19:40,053 --> 01:19:41,889
What have we got here?

999
01:19:48,187 --> 01:19:50,022
So this is on your way home.

1000
01:19:56,778 --> 01:19:58,697
So this is it!

1001
01:20:00,490 --> 01:20:01,658

01:23:36,957 --> 01:23:37,833
Honey.

1023
01:23:38,667 --> 01:23:39,501
Honey.

1024
01:23:39,793 --> 01:23:40,627
Honey!

1025
01:23:43,964 --> 01:23:45,298
The police are here.

1026
01:23:50,971 --> 01:23:52,430
What should we do?

1027
01:24:00,397 --> 01:24:02,232
Be sure not to panic, okay?

1028
01:24:02,691 --> 01:24:04,192
I need to change clothes.

1029
01:24:13,910 --> 01:24:15,871
I’ll explain it all at the station.

1030
01:24:17,789 --> 01:24:18,790
It’s all my...

1031
01:24:19,249 --> 01:24:20,417
You Si-one.

1032
01:24:22,043 --> 01:24:23,378
What were you saying?

1033
01:24:26,256 --> 01:24:30,427
It’s all my fault for
being a bad father.

1034
01:24:53,742 --> 01:24:55,493
You’re the one who said not to panic!

1035
01:24:58,497 --> 01:24:59,372
Get in!

1036
01:25:02,501 --> 01:25:03,460
The door...

1037
01:25:10,425 --> 01:25:12,594
Is Dongho’s mom not
picking up on purpose?

1038
01:25:13,970 --> 01:25:16,765
How could Dongho rat
on his friend like that?

1039
01:25:17,766 --> 01:25:20,936
It can’t have been Si-one’s idea.

1040
01:25:21,228 --> 01:25:24,272
It’s Dongho’s dad’s store.
So Dongho suggested it.

1041
01:25:24,689 --> 01:25:25,899
Isn’t it obvious?

1042
01:25:25,899 --> 01:25:27,400
<i>Dongho’s Mom</i>

1043
01:25:31,613 --> 01:25:34,866
He must be so lonely
and scared, my baby.

1044
01:25:35,700 --> 01:25:37,118
This is all your fault!

1045
01:25:41,289 --> 01:25:42,123
Excuse me!

1046
01:25:45,585 --> 01:25:47,754
Just a minute! Wait!

1047
01:25:49,130 --> 01:25:50,257
Hold on a minute!

1048
01:25:51,508 --> 01:25:54,219
Listen, his mother is parking the car.

1049
01:25:54,928 --> 01:25:58,265
Can we go in with
him? He’s still just a kid.

1050
01:25:58,265 --> 01:25:59,224
All right.

1051
01:25:59,224 --> 01:26:00,100
Thank you.

1052
01:26:01,726 --> 01:26:03,395
Lift your head. Look at me.

1053
01:26:04,479 --> 01:26:07,482
Dongho dragged you into it, right?

1054
01:26:08,191 --> 01:26:09,192
Dongho?

1055
01:26:10,235 --> 01:26:11,653
Why would he drag me...

1056
01:26:11,653 --> 01:26:14,281
Hey. Listen...

1057
01:26:15,615 --> 01:26:20,245
Doing a crime on your own
is incredibly lonely and scary.

1058
01:26:21,162 --> 01:26:23,123
That’s how I imagine it, anyway.

1059
01:26:25,667 --> 01:26:27,961
I’ll never leave you to feel lonely.

1060
01:26:27,961 --> 01:26:30,297
So, I need your cooperation.

1061
01:26:30,630 --> 01:26:31,923
Since we’re a team.

1062
01:26:36,511 --> 01:26:38,763
Actually, the one who suggested it...

1063
01:26:38,763 --> 01:26:41,725
Hey, hey, wait. Wait!

1064
01:26:41,725 --> 01:26:42,892
Get a grip.

1065
01:26:42,892 --> 01:26:44,019
Listen to me.

1066
01:26:44,853 --> 01:26:47,272
Our family is in a war now.

1067
01:26:47,647 --> 01:26:48,523
What?

1068
01:26:48,523 --> 01:26:50,859
No, I don’t mean with each other.

1069
01:26:53,570 --> 01:26:58,658
You and me, in this war, we
need to protect our women, right?

1070
01:26:58,867 --> 01:27:01,411
You know Grandpa’s pistol?

1071
01:27:01,411 --> 01:27:04,331
Your grandpa bent the
fingers of a dead Viet Cong

1072
01:27:04,331 --> 01:27:06,833
and took that pistol, why do you think?

1073
01:27:08,084 --> 01:27:14,132
To remember that if he hadn’t shot first,
the enemy would’ve shot him with that gun.

1074
01:27:15,216 --> 01:27:16,468
You get what I mean?

1075
01:27:42,869 --> 01:27:44,704
All the men...

1076
01:27:45,246 --> 01:27:47,582
What’ll you do, huh?

1077
01:27:57,008 --> 01:27:58,385
Let’s wash your hands.

1078
01:28:02,180 --> 01:28:03,264
Up you go!

1079
01:28:09,562 --> 01:28:15,235
Dongho says Si-one wanted to sell
the phones and help out his mom. Damn!

1080
01:28:18,488 --> 01:28:20,573
It’s your own store.

1081
01:28:21,157 --> 01:28:23,076
Let’s put this behind us.

1082
01:28:38,716 --> 01:28:41,636
If you don’t settle, he’ll
get a year’s sentence.

1083
01:28:42,387 --> 01:28:45,849
A mom can’t let that happen to her son.

1084
01:28:46,808 --> 01:28:47,851
Isn’t that so?

1085
01:28:52,605 --> 01:28:54,566
Hey, Man-su.

1086
01:28:55,358 --> 01:28:56,401
Wonno.

1087
01:28:56,943 --> 01:28:58,027
Gimme a smoke.

1088
01:28:59,112 --> 01:29:00,113
Sure.

1089
01:29:01,656 --> 01:29:03,408
What are you doing?

1090
01:29:04,117 --> 01:29:06,119
I started smoking again.

1091
01:29:13,126 --> 01:29:16,546
But honey, mind if I talk
to my friend for a sec?

1092
01:29:17,630 --> 01:29:18,673
Just talk.

1093
01:29:19,716 --> 01:29:21,176
You don’t mind, do you?

1094
01:29:22,844 --> 01:29:23,845
Well...

1095
01:29:29,893 --> 01:29:34,731
Dongho dragged Si-one into it.
That’s what Dongho will testify.

1096
01:29:35,732 --> 01:29:37,484
Si-one just stood nearby.

1097
01:29:38,151 --> 01:29:39,235
What a crock of shit!

1098
01:29:39,235 --> 01:29:41,696
Dongho turned off the CCTV,

1099
01:29:43,573 --> 01:29:44,949
but not the other one.

1100
01:29:46,951 --> 01:29:49,454
He didn’t know to turn
off the security system.

1101
01:29:49,454 --> 01:29:51,790
What if your wife found out

1102
01:29:51,790 --> 01:29:55,752
you use that store at night
as a place for fucking women?

1103
01:29:55,919 --> 01:30:01,841
And if she heard you bragged about
it to all the men in the neighborhood?

1104
01:30:02,383 --> 01:30:05,303
You jobless stinking piece of shit!

1105
01:30:05,720 --> 01:30:07,347
I’ll fucking kill you!

1106
01:30:07,805 --> 01:30:08,806
One more thing.

1107
01:30:09,766 --> 01:30:11,184
You’re not buying my home.

1108
01:30:12,101 --> 01:30:13,353
Miri, let’s go.

1109
01:30:16,648 --> 01:30:17,941
Forget buying it.

1110
01:30:18,358 --> 01:30:19,859
Honey, be careful.

1111
01:30:26,407 --> 01:30:28,660
Are they up there?

1112
01:30:28,910 --> 01:30:30,620
Are there many?

1113
01:30:33,748 --> 01:30:34,582
How many?

1114
01:30:36,751 --> 01:30:37,710
There’s more?

1115
01:30:40,797 --> 01:30:42,048
That brat...

1116
01:30:42,340 --> 01:30:44,801
Two, four, six...

1117
01:30:48,221 --> 01:30:50,223
We don’t have to give them back?

1118
01:30:50,849 --> 01:30:52,517
Let’s make them disappear.

1119
01:30:53,059 --> 01:30:56,104
Wonno can’t help
but cover it up anyway.

1120
01:30:56,521 --> 01:30:57,355
Right?

1121
01:30:57,605 --> 01:30:58,439
Of course.

1122
01:31:13,413 --> 01:31:15,081
What tree will you plant?

1123
01:31:15,582 --> 01:31:17,834
When the apples ripen, let’s make jam.

1124
01:31:18,835 --> 01:31:20,837
Will the roots grow over the phones?

1125
01:31:21,212 --> 01:31:23,548
The tastiest things grow on filth.

1126
01:31:24,007 --> 01:31:26,342
Fertilizer’s made from shit and piss.

1127
01:31:31,723 --> 01:31:33,641
Okay, thank you.

1128
01:31:35,768 --> 01:31:38,396
Is it true about Grandpa?

1129
01:31:39,981 --> 01:31:41,858
He hung himself in this house?

1130
01:31:46,029 --> 01:31:47,447
You know his pig farm?

1131
01:31:48,573 --> 01:31:49,908
They caught a disease,

1132
01:31:50,908 --> 01:31:53,661
and he had to kill
them all, 20,000 pigs.

1133
01:31:54,954 --> 01:31:55,997
How?

1134
01:31:55,997 --> 01:31:57,749
He buried them, alive.

1135
01:31:58,917 --> 01:32:01,628
But he was always a bit unstable.

1136
01:32:02,003 --> 01:32:03,921
Ever since fighting in Vietnam.

1137
01:32:04,505 --> 01:32:05,965
In the old barn, he...

1138
01:32:06,299 --> 01:32:09,719
you know... but I didn’t see it.

1139
01:32:12,472 --> 01:32:13,640
Hey.

1140
01:32:18,061 --> 01:32:19,145
Sit with me.

1141
01:32:19,854 --> 01:32:20,855
Come closer.

1142
01:32:29,697 --> 01:32:30,948
Mom doesn’t know.

1143
01:32:32,158 --> 01:32:33,409
Don’t look, don’t look!

1144
01:32:35,578 --> 01:32:36,663
I quit.

1145
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:40,375
Throw them out yourself.

1146
01:36:17,425 --> 01:36:18,384
Papyrus...

1147
01:36:19,635 --> 01:36:21,053
You interviewed there?

1148
01:36:23,306 --> 01:36:24,265
I was rejected.

1149
01:36:24,557 --> 01:36:27,059
- The name Go Si-jo—
- Never heard of it.

1150
01:36:33,774 --> 01:36:35,026
And Gu Bum-mo?

1151
01:36:42,450 --> 01:36:43,284
Not sure...

1152
01:36:44,160 --> 01:36:46,454
We’re visiting people
who interviewed there.

1153
01:36:46,996 --> 01:36:48,915
Anything unusual happen recently?

1154
01:36:49,290 --> 01:36:50,833
Have you felt in danger?

1155
01:36:55,171 --> 01:36:57,548
Those two men have disappeared.

1156
01:37:00,676 --> 01:37:02,261
You may think badly of me,

1157
01:37:02,470 --> 01:37:04,472
but even after hearing they died,

1158
01:37:05,139 --> 01:37:09,977
the thought that comes to mind is, I
wonder what lucky person got hired?

1159
01:37:09,977 --> 01:37:11,604
I said “disappeared”.

1160
01:37:12,521 --> 01:37:13,356
Give me that.

1161
01:37:13,814 --> 01:37:15,107
And then,

1162
01:37:15,441 --> 01:37:21,238
Mr. You, you said to me, “they died”.

1163
01:37:22,740 --> 01:37:24,617
Why do you think they’re dead?

1164
01:37:25,534 --> 01:37:26,786
Well...

1165
01:37:28,287 --> 01:37:31,207
In today’s world, if
someone disappears,

1166
01:37:31,791 --> 01:37:32,792
then usually...

1167
01:37:34,794 --> 01:37:40,257
“In today’s world, if someone
disappears, then usually...”

1168
01:37:40,549 --> 01:37:43,761
Go Si-jo’s wife reported him missing,

1169
01:37:44,011 --> 01:37:48,015
and after tracking his phone,
we found his car sitting by itself.

1170
01:37:48,224 --> 01:37:51,102
She said after being fired,
he was extremely depressed.

1171
01:37:51,352 --> 01:37:52,228
Oh my.

1172
01:37:52,228 --> 01:37:55,356
A phone contains all
of a person’s life, right?

1173
01:37:55,940 --> 01:37:57,566
Who you talked to,

1174
01:37:57,566 --> 01:38:00,111
and also, who you couldn’t talk to.

1175
01:38:00,903 --> 01:38:02,446
<i>9 Missed Calls</i>

1176
01:38:02,446 --> 01:38:03,447
What the!

1177
01:38:07,660 --> 01:38:09,870
It’s that number! The missed calls.

1178
01:38:10,705 --> 01:38:12,039
Umbrella.

1179
01:38:13,332 --> 01:38:14,750
Finally, you answered.

1180
01:38:15,167 --> 01:38:18,421
You’ve called the phone of
a man who’s gone missing.

1181
01:38:18,796 --> 01:38:20,673
Excuse me, but who are you?

1182
01:38:21,924 --> 01:38:23,926
I’m head of HR at Papyrus.

1183
01:38:24,218 --> 01:38:28,431
Mr. Go interviewed at our company,
and I called to say he was hired.

1184
01:38:28,639 --> 01:38:30,349
This is like some kind of curse.

1185
01:38:30,599 --> 01:38:31,225
<i>What?</i>

1186
01:38:31,684 --> 01:38:38,107
We originally planned to hire a different
applicant but couldn’t reach him, either.

1187
01:38:38,399 --> 01:38:40,151
What was that man’s name?

1188
01:38:40,568 --> 01:38:44,280
That man... hold on, his name...

1189
01:38:44,905 --> 01:38:46,323
He scored highest.

1190
01:38:46,323 --> 01:38:49,035
Gu... Gu... Gu...

1191
01:38:49,243 --> 01:38:50,369
Bum-mo.

1192
01:38:50,953 --> 01:38:54,248
And I knew I’d seen that name before.

1193
01:38:54,999 --> 01:38:56,125
<i>Gu Bum-mo</i>

1194
01:38:57,043 --> 01:38:58,294
Look, kiddo!

1195
01:39:01,213 --> 01:39:03,132
They knew each other?

1196
01:39:05,301 --> 01:39:07,928
So, there were two paper men.

1197
01:39:08,262 --> 01:39:11,599
They knew each other. And
disappeared at the same time.

1198
01:39:11,766 --> 01:39:14,268
We did a painstaking
search around the car.

1199
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:16,729
We found traces of Mr. Go’s blood...

1200
01:39:16,729 --> 01:39:17,480
Blood...

1201
01:39:18,522 --> 01:39:23,110
And what might’ve caused Mr. Go’s
blood to spill out of his veins?

1202
01:39:23,903 --> 01:39:24,779
A gun.

1203
01:39:24,945 --> 01:39:25,696
A handgun.

1204
01:39:25,696 --> 01:39:26,947
Made in North Korea.

1205
01:39:28,074 --> 01:39:29,367
A bullet shell was found.

1206
01:39:29,825 --> 01:39:30,493
By me.

1207
01:39:31,619 --> 01:39:32,620
<i>A bullet shell!</i>

1208
01:39:38,417 --> 01:39:39,460
Pretty scary.

1209
01:39:41,962 --> 01:39:45,883
Until I catch the culprit,
you must be very careful.

1210
01:39:49,345 --> 01:39:50,596
Ri-one.

1211
01:39:50,971 --> 01:39:53,140
What kid listens to such music?

1212
01:39:54,683 --> 01:39:57,103
I’ll contact you as
soon as I go missing.

1213
01:40:04,652 --> 01:40:07,446
This is not a joking matter.

1214
01:40:08,280 --> 01:40:09,281
Drive safely!

1215
01:40:10,199 --> 01:40:11,117
Ri-one!

1216
01:40:11,117 --> 01:40:12,243
What are you doing?

1217
01:40:17,289 --> 01:40:18,416
What’s wrong?

1218
01:40:18,666 --> 01:40:20,084
My dear Ri-one...

1219
01:40:21,585 --> 01:40:23,087
Don’t cry... Don’t cry.

1220
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:26,006
Don’t cry.

1221
01:40:26,006 --> 01:40:29,426
I’ll bring them back,
okay? Stop crying.

1222
01:40:31,971 --> 01:40:33,681
Just need to do one more.

Mr. Choi Sun-chul?

1230
01:41:22,980 --> 01:41:24,648
You thought I was a deer?

1231
01:41:25,483 --> 01:41:27,234
- For fuck’s sake.
- I waited all day.

1232

I’m You Man-su.

1233
01:41:30,738 --> 01:41:34,158
I was manager of specialty
paper at Solar until they fired me.

1234
01:41:39,079 --> 01:41:41,624
The guy from the restroom?

1235
01:41:41,874 --> 01:41:45,294
I’ve got all this free time,
and I envy you so much,

1236
01:41:45,502 --> 01:41:48,839
I’ve been watching your
Instagram every day.

1237
01:41:49,298 --> 01:41:50,341
Whoa.

1238
01:41:50,966 --> 01:41:52,635
You mean I’m being stalked?

1239
01:41:52,843 --> 01:41:56,388
Want to have a drink with me?

1240
01:41:58,641 --> 01:42:00,184
Seems like you already had some.

1241
01:42:02,436 --> 01:42:03,437
All right.

1242
01:42:08,692 --> 01:42:10,694
After slaving for 25 years,

1243
01:42:10,694 --> 01:42:13,072
they gave me 25 minutes to clear out.

1244
01:42:13,864 --> 01:42:15,324
I walk out of the office,

1245
01:42:15,574 --> 01:42:19,495
and the security guard had
my things in a box already

1246
01:42:19,495 --> 01:42:21,789
and was standing there, holding it.

1247
01:42:22,456 --> 01:42:26,710
They wouldn’t let me go down
the hallway where I’d always walked.

1248
01:42:26,961 --> 01:42:28,671
Sent you out the back door?

1249
01:42:28,671 --> 01:42:29,755
Exactly.

1250
01:42:29,755 --> 01:42:31,465
Fucking dickwads!

1251
01:42:32,258 --> 01:42:33,717
Hurry up and eat.

1252
01:42:56,365 --> 01:42:57,449
Not again!

1253
01:42:57,783 --> 01:43:00,119
If you don’t eat, I’ll
take that paper away!

1254
01:43:01,662 --> 01:43:05,874
You need to eat, so your arms get
strong, and your bowing gets stronger.

1255
01:43:10,629 --> 01:43:14,883
Why are the men in this house all
hiding something from me, Ri-one?

1256
01:43:15,384 --> 01:43:16,802
Why could it be?

1257
01:43:17,303 --> 01:43:19,388
Do they want to die?

1258
01:43:20,389 --> 01:43:24,601
My quality ratio was 96%.

1259
01:43:25,311 --> 01:43:27,813
On those old Bumin machines.

1260
01:43:29,440 --> 01:43:33,652
They don’t give out Pulp
Man of the Year to any old fool.

1261
01:43:34,320 --> 01:43:35,779
Hey, eat up. Eat this.

1262
01:43:37,448 --> 01:43:38,407
Right.

1263
01:43:39,700 --> 01:43:42,578
If they gave it to any old
fool, I’d have gotten one.

1264
01:43:44,413 --> 01:43:47,625
Hey, that’s not what I meant!

1265
01:43:49,501 --> 01:43:51,086
Sorry, fuck.

1266
01:43:51,545 --> 01:43:53,297
Damn it, drink up.

1267
01:43:55,132 --> 01:43:55,966
“Fuck”?

1268
01:43:57,092 --> 01:43:58,427
No, I...

1269
01:44:05,267 --> 01:44:07,603
Hey! Listen to you.

1270
01:44:07,603 --> 01:44:09,563
I fucking love it, fuck!

1271
01:44:09,938 --> 01:44:12,149
- Have a fucking drink!
- Let’s fucking drink!

1272
01:44:20,741 --> 01:44:23,202
Hey, slow down a bit.

1273
01:44:24,953 --> 01:44:27,164
To hell with that, I’m drinking fast.

1274
01:44:28,999 --> 01:44:30,667
Do they want to die?

1275
01:44:34,046 --> 01:44:36,674
So you saw it, or you think you saw it?

1276
01:44:42,680 --> 01:44:45,724
I’ll die if I keep working like this.

1277
01:44:46,809 --> 01:44:51,522
With this much work to
do, I need another manager.

1278
01:44:56,860 --> 01:44:58,112
Right.

1279
01:45:00,489 --> 01:45:01,532
At your level!

1280
01:45:01,865 --> 01:45:03,575
That’s what I’m saying!

1281
01:45:06,995 --> 01:45:09,123
Man-su my man, you crying?

1282
01:45:12,459 --> 01:45:13,752
Feel sorry for me?

1283
01:45:18,841 --> 01:45:20,634
Why so soft-hearted?

1284
01:45:23,345 --> 01:45:24,888
Ask the higher-ups.

1285
01:45:25,472 --> 01:45:26,306
Ask what?

1286
01:45:29,393 --> 01:45:31,061
Ask them to hire someone else!

1287
01:45:32,354 --> 01:45:33,939
Those tight-assed pricks?

1288
01:45:34,982 --> 01:45:37,401
If you sit tight, their
asses get tighter!

1289
01:45:37,401 --> 01:45:38,861
Demand it!

1290
01:45:39,069 --> 01:45:40,738
Just collapse at work one day!

1291
01:45:41,280 --> 01:45:43,657
You’ll need sick leave!
Production will stop!

1292
01:45:44,366 --> 01:45:46,535
Won’t they come to their senses then?

1293
01:45:49,455 --> 01:45:52,875
Come to their senses?
They’ll just fire me.

1294
01:45:53,083 --> 01:45:54,376
Recommend me.

1295
01:45:55,252 --> 01:45:57,254
We’d work really well together!

1296
01:45:57,463 --> 01:45:58,714
Complementing each other.

1297
01:45:59,840 --> 01:46:01,008
A Team, B Team.

1298
01:46:03,594 --> 01:46:04,928
Sure.

1299
01:46:06,138 --> 01:46:07,765
I’ll try talking to them.

1300
01:46:21,278 --> 01:46:22,571
<i>Oh dear.</i>

1301
01:46:23,781 --> 01:46:25,699
So this is the best you got?

1302
01:46:27,618 --> 01:46:30,621
I know, water streaks.

1303
01:46:31,872 --> 01:46:36,543
It’s the cross-link cellulose
recipe of those bastards at Bumin.

1304
01:46:36,543 --> 01:46:37,711
But you know,

1305
01:46:40,047 --> 01:46:42,382
I’ve got no other choice.

1306
01:46:42,674 --> 01:46:44,843
Even if you use their machines,

1307
01:46:45,302 --> 01:46:47,471
you don’t have to
use their recipe, too.

1308
01:46:47,679 --> 01:46:51,350
How can you afford this house
as a line manager? And that car?

1309
01:46:51,642 --> 01:46:55,729
Someone might think you’re
pocketing all kinds of cash.

1310
01:46:57,147 --> 01:46:58,941
That’s not what I think,

1311
01:46:59,358 --> 01:47:02,528
but others might
think that way, I mean.

1312
01:47:04,530 --> 01:47:06,532
I really don’t think that. Here.

1313
01:47:08,659 --> 01:47:09,785
Bottoms up.

1314
01:47:19,503 --> 01:47:20,546
You okay?

1315
01:47:35,060 --> 01:47:36,812
You’re dead now.

1316
01:47:49,867 --> 01:47:51,285
Bomb shots, okay?

1317
01:48:28,614 --> 01:48:29,615
No other choice.

1318
01:48:29,615 --> 01:48:30,741
No other choice.

1319
01:48:31,867 --> 01:48:33,827
No other choice...

1320
01:48:35,454 --> 01:48:37,706
Hurry the fuck up!

1321
01:49:35,389 --> 01:49:36,890
So freaking cold...

1322
01:49:38,809 --> 01:49:40,143
My head...

1323
01:49:48,110 --> 01:49:49,653
Where do you keep the...?

1324
01:50:31,945 --> 01:50:34,531
What a fucking relief!

1325
01:50:39,995 --> 01:50:42,748
I need some fucking air!

1326
01:50:42,956 --> 01:50:43,749
Let’s go out.

1327
01:50:44,166 --> 01:50:48,628
Getting drunk in front of a
bonfire is my lifelong dream!

1328
01:50:49,296 --> 01:50:51,214
You’re freaking awesome.

1329
01:50:51,214 --> 01:50:52,382
Vodka.

1330
01:50:55,510 --> 01:50:57,679
You had more?

1331
01:50:58,847 --> 01:51:00,182
Man-superman

1332
01:51:00,807 --> 01:51:02,559
you’re the best!

1333
01:51:18,784 --> 01:51:23,538
I moved here 6 months ago
and it’s my first fucking bonfire.

1334
01:51:25,791 --> 01:51:30,962
I thought I’d have barbecue every day.

1335
01:51:31,963 --> 01:51:35,383
When you get the thing you
want, that’s what happens.

1336
01:51:36,843 --> 01:51:39,095
My wife was right.

1337
01:51:43,266 --> 01:51:46,311
I really don’t want to do this.

1338
01:51:46,603 --> 01:51:47,395
What?

1339
01:51:48,855 --> 01:51:52,901
But if I don’t, the deaths of
those other two are meaningless.

1340
01:51:54,486 --> 01:51:55,695
Just a dog’s death.

1341
01:51:57,197 --> 01:51:58,907
No...

1342
01:51:59,908 --> 01:52:02,869
You shouldn’t barbecue dogs!

1343
01:54:11,456 --> 01:54:13,750
<i>Ms. Wife</i>

1344
01:54:24,594 --> 01:54:27,305
Sorry, I can’t turn on the video.

1345
01:54:27,764 --> 01:54:29,933
It’s okay. You look at me.

1346
01:54:30,308 --> 01:54:32,644
I didn’t want to get your hopes up,

1347
01:54:32,936 --> 01:54:35,063
but I’m visiting a
friend from Moon Paper.

1348
01:54:38,483 --> 01:54:42,821
He’s got so much work, the
company needs another line manager.

1349
01:54:43,196 --> 01:54:45,073
Remember what the detectives said?

1350
01:54:45,323 --> 01:54:47,367
- About the interviewees.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

1351
01:54:48,576 --> 01:54:49,536
That they died.

1352
01:54:50,370 --> 01:54:51,287
Yeah?

1353
01:54:54,582 --> 01:54:55,583
So?

1354
01:54:57,502 --> 01:54:58,712
I’m worried.

1355
01:54:59,504 --> 01:55:03,341
- You go around late at night...
- Hey, I’m okay.

1356
01:55:04,676 --> 01:55:06,302
How can you be so sure?

1357
01:55:06,678 --> 01:55:07,846
Because I’m...

1358
01:55:09,389 --> 01:55:10,682
me?

1359
01:55:12,100 --> 01:55:15,020
Hey, can’t you drop that
and come home now?

1360
01:55:15,937 --> 01:55:18,273
I don’t want to say this, but no.

1361
01:55:18,690 --> 01:55:20,775
Don’t carry the load by yourself.

1362
01:55:20,984 --> 01:55:23,194
Even a sheet of paper
is better lifted together.

1363
01:55:23,194 --> 01:55:27,032
That’s a favorite saying in
our industry. A sheet of paper.

1364
01:55:27,866 --> 01:55:31,161
If the four of us band
together, we can beat this.

1365
01:55:31,161 --> 01:55:31,995
Six.

1366
01:55:31,995 --> 01:55:34,664
I know, Si-two Ri-two.

1367
01:55:34,664 --> 01:55:36,624
I’m going to bring them back.

1368
01:55:36,624 --> 01:55:39,502
You’d be good at
gardening or bonsai, too.

1369
01:55:40,170 --> 01:55:43,173
People live to 100, you have time.

1370
01:55:43,506 --> 01:55:45,133
This is my last interview.

1371
01:55:45,467 --> 01:55:48,928
Up until now I’ve been digging,
now I need to plant the tree.

1372
01:55:49,137 --> 01:55:52,015
If you do something bad,

1373
01:55:52,515 --> 01:55:55,185
I’m doing it with you, okay?

1374
01:56:00,273 --> 01:56:02,901
Hey, don’t worry.

1375
01:56:04,402 --> 01:56:06,029
I think my friend woke up.

1376
01:56:06,738 --> 01:56:09,449
<i>- Your cheek...</i>
- I’ll call tomorrow, okay? Bye.

1377
01:56:09,449 --> 01:56:10,367
<i>Honey!</i>

1378
01:57:17,475 --> 01:57:19,102
Si-one, Si-one!

1379
01:57:19,894 --> 01:57:21,354
It’s okay.

1380
01:57:25,191 --> 01:57:26,860
I dug in the ground.

1381
01:57:28,111 --> 01:57:29,154
There?

1382
01:57:29,696 --> 01:57:31,489
There really was something.

1383
01:57:34,451 --> 01:57:35,827
He cut up a pig?

1384
01:57:36,161 --> 01:57:37,245
Yes.

1385
01:57:44,586 --> 01:57:47,297
Like when he barbecued
a pig for us last year?

1386
01:57:48,298 --> 01:57:51,426
He put a whole pig in the
ground to fertilize the tree.

1387
01:57:51,426 --> 01:57:53,344
Must’ve been so tough for him.

1388
01:57:53,970 --> 01:57:56,306
<i>So that’s what it was,</i>

1389
01:57:56,890 --> 01:57:58,057
<i>a pig...</i>

1390
01:59:20,974 --> 01:59:22,684
Did the interview go well?

1391
01:59:25,186 --> 01:59:26,104
Yeah.

1392
01:59:28,439 --> 01:59:29,524
Did you sleep well?

1393
01:59:48,293 --> 01:59:49,711
Just one minute.

1394
01:59:52,839 --> 01:59:57,510
59, 58, 57...

1395
01:59:57,510 --> 01:59:59,595
Count up, not down.

1396
02:00:01,347 --> 02:00:07,395
1, 2, 3, 4...

1397
02:00:10,189 --> 02:00:12,483
So you drank, in the end.

1398
02:00:13,109 --> 02:00:14,193
Yeah.

1399
02:00:15,820 --> 02:00:17,322
You smell of smoke, too.

1400
02:00:17,780 --> 02:00:20,074
We had a barbecue at my friend’s place.

1401
02:00:20,950 --> 02:00:23,870
He’s been on his own six
months, but he’s lonely already.

1402
02:00:25,121 --> 02:00:26,039
Divorced?

1403
02:00:26,789 --> 02:00:28,958
They split up because of the house.

1404
02:00:29,959 --> 02:00:33,963
He wanted to live in
nature, but she refused.

1405
02:00:34,213 --> 02:00:36,257
Can that be a reason?

1406
02:00:38,176 --> 02:00:39,886
Splitting up over that?

1407
02:00:43,890 --> 02:00:44,891
I’m sorry.

1408
02:00:45,600 --> 02:00:50,355
When I was doing my degree,
I couldn’t have fun with you.

1409
02:00:52,982 --> 02:00:57,236
You shouldn’t have lived so hard.

1410
02:01:10,500 --> 02:01:12,835
How many seconds? 30?

1411
02:01:18,132 --> 02:01:19,384
59.

1412
02:01:20,635 --> 02:01:21,344
60.

1413
02:01:32,939 --> 02:01:35,274
That must’ve been hard for you.

1414
02:01:36,192 --> 02:01:41,697
So what I realized while
going through that ordeal

1415
02:01:42,156 --> 02:01:43,991
is you need a creative plan.

1416
02:01:43,991 --> 02:01:46,911
The important thing is
to shift your perspective.

1417
02:01:47,328 --> 02:01:50,373
In the execution phase, you
have to be persistent and bold.

1418
02:01:50,373 --> 02:01:54,627
When necessary, at any time
you need to be able to say no.

1419
02:02:05,930 --> 02:02:07,974
We have a “lights-out system”.

1420
02:02:07,974 --> 02:02:11,436
Recently we built a
fully automated factory.

1421
02:02:11,436 --> 02:02:12,645
Lights out?

1422
02:02:12,645 --> 02:02:16,149
- Since AI doesn’t need lights turned on.
- Right.

1423
02:02:16,149 --> 02:02:20,945
The days of tapping a
roll with a stick are over.

1424
02:02:20,945 --> 02:02:22,280
Yes, of course.

1425
02:02:22,530 --> 02:02:25,283
Anyway, we quite urgently need you

1426
02:02:25,783 --> 02:02:27,368
to oversee this test run.

1427
02:02:28,786 --> 02:02:32,498
When you say fully
automated, the workers...

1428
02:02:33,124 --> 02:02:35,376
...will have to be reduced, right?

1429
02:02:35,918 --> 02:02:39,255
That’s the whole point of
the system. No other choice.

1430
02:02:39,964 --> 02:02:42,175
Do you have any objection?

1431
02:02:49,182 --> 02:02:51,851
If you don’t like it, you can say no.

1432
02:02:52,810 --> 02:02:53,936
Not at all.

1433
02:02:53,936 --> 02:02:56,314
How can you go against the times?

1434
02:02:57,064 --> 02:03:03,446
But at any rate, you need one
person to watch over it all, right?

1435
02:03:07,950 --> 02:03:12,330
So 5 years ago, there was a secret bid
at Minting and Security Printing Corp?

1436
02:03:12,622 --> 02:03:18,753
Yes, the competition was fierce then.

1437
02:03:20,087 --> 02:03:24,509
Solar, where I worked, was one
of the three designated companies.

1438
02:03:25,134 --> 02:03:28,221
We never even considered bidding.

1439
02:03:29,347 --> 02:03:31,015
Then who made the bid?

1440
02:03:31,641 --> 02:03:35,520
Two people facing off as representatives
of the two major paper companies.

1441
02:03:35,895 --> 02:03:40,733
Who were the rivals in
this bloody bidding war?

1442
02:03:43,694 --> 02:03:45,029
Gu Bum-mo and

1443
02:03:45,571 --> 02:03:46,447
Go Si-jo!

1444
02:03:47,323 --> 02:03:50,243
The day he returned from
his business trip to Daejeon...

1445
02:03:51,035 --> 02:03:53,955
His sleep-talking woke me
up in the middle of the night.

1446
02:03:55,748 --> 02:03:59,293
He started crying and whining,

1447
02:04:01,462 --> 02:04:05,675
saying things like “It’s not
fair!” and “Don’t insult me!”

1448
02:04:07,760 --> 02:04:08,928
Then after that,

1449
02:04:10,137 --> 02:04:11,514
wouldn’t you know...

1450
02:04:15,768 --> 02:04:17,520
He was surely asleep,

1451
02:04:18,271 --> 02:04:21,023
but he gathered the
phlegm in his mouth and...

1452
02:04:27,321 --> 02:04:29,657
He spit on his own face.

1453
02:04:32,952 --> 02:04:34,745
It startled him too, and he woke up.

1454
02:04:36,414 --> 02:04:38,207
The day he came back from Daejeon?

1455
02:04:38,207 --> 02:04:39,584
“It’s so unfair”?

1456
02:04:41,210 --> 02:04:44,505
As you know, Minting and
Security Printing Corp is in Daejeon.

1457
02:04:47,550 --> 02:04:49,427
Was that when it started?

1458
02:04:51,053 --> 02:04:54,974
He just listened to music here,
avoided going to bed with me.

1459
02:04:55,683 --> 02:05:00,897
After he got fired, he drank
all day, developed depression...

1460
02:05:01,689 --> 02:05:02,565
Oh my god.

1461
02:05:03,983 --> 02:05:05,902
He didn’t bring his medication.

1462
02:05:08,654 --> 02:05:09,614
Honey,

1463
02:05:10,573 --> 02:05:12,199
where in the world are you?

1464
02:05:12,199 --> 02:05:15,369
Does your husband own
a handgun by any chance?

1465
02:05:22,835 --> 02:05:25,504
Can I ask why you
take so long to answer?

1466
02:05:28,382 --> 02:05:31,969
If you own a firearm,
you need to report it, right?

1467
02:05:33,137 --> 02:05:34,347
He didn’t do that.

1468
02:05:34,597 --> 02:05:35,681
What’s more,

1469
02:05:37,350 --> 02:05:39,268
it vanished with my husband.

1470
02:05:40,061 --> 02:05:41,687
He could...

1471
02:05:42,605 --> 02:05:44,065
commit suicide with it.

1472
02:05:45,024 --> 02:05:46,275
Please find him quickly.

1473
02:05:51,197 --> 02:05:52,740
Was it one of these?

1474
02:06:10,800 --> 02:06:11,884
This one?

1475
02:06:21,227 --> 02:06:24,397
Gu Bum-mo’s wife really said that?

1476
02:06:26,440 --> 02:06:29,235
So be wary of Gu Bum-mo.

1477
02:06:29,777 --> 02:06:31,153
Remember his face.

1478
02:06:35,366 --> 02:06:39,829
Gu Bum-mo killed Go Si-jo and ran away?

1479
02:06:41,664 --> 02:06:44,250
Wow, this is...

1480
02:06:57,138 --> 02:06:58,389
<i>Honey!</i>

1481
02:07:01,308 --> 02:07:02,810
Got something to say?

1482
02:07:07,898 --> 02:07:09,984
Congrats on your first day at work.

1483
02:07:14,530 --> 02:07:16,615
This weekend, should we do a pig roast?

1484
02:07:16,615 --> 02:07:17,575
- No.
- No way!

1485
02:07:23,122 --> 02:07:26,834
It’s too cold for that now.

1486
02:07:28,586 --> 02:07:33,340
Quit the clinic and take up tennis
again. I’ll buy you a new racket.

1487
02:07:33,340 --> 02:07:35,259
I’m not doing that anymore.

1488
02:07:36,010 --> 02:07:37,303
I’ll save money.

1489
02:07:41,974 --> 02:07:43,726
Si-two Ri-two, house!

1490
02:07:44,059 --> 02:07:44,977
<i>House!</i>

1491
02:07:47,480 --> 02:07:49,774
Ri-one, come here!
Don’t play over there.

1492
02:07:50,775 --> 02:07:52,943
A snail! A snail!

1493
02:07:52,943 --> 02:07:54,862
I called the real estate agent.

1494
02:07:56,072 --> 02:07:57,615
Said we’ll keep the house.

1495
02:07:58,157 --> 02:07:59,366
Oh.

1496
02:07:59,366 --> 02:08:02,828
We planted an apple tree
here, how can we sell it?

1497
02:08:03,370 --> 02:08:04,663
Exactly.

1498
02:08:05,915 --> 02:08:07,333
Ri-one!

1499
02:08:08,751 --> 02:08:09,752
Ri-one!

1500
02:08:10,920 --> 02:08:12,463
I’ll see you later.

1501
02:08:16,634 --> 02:08:19,845
Bugs are eating it alive.

1502
02:08:27,561 --> 02:08:30,064
<i>…will ease up sometime this morning.</i>

1503
02:08:30,064 --> 02:08:33,651
After the nighttime rain which
seemed to mourn the passing of autumn,

1504
02:08:33,651 --> 02:08:38,030
the temperature also dropped sharply,
bringing us one step closer to winter.

1505
02:08:52,086 --> 02:08:54,880
- Going to school already?
- Dongho and I are meeting early.

1506
02:08:54,880 --> 02:08:57,258
Are you two still friends?

1507
02:08:57,508 --> 02:09:00,219
