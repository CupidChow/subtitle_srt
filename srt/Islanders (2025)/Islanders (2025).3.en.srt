12
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,785
-Good morning.
-Morning.

13
00:02:40,786 --> 00:02:42,454
Why did you get up so early?

14
00:02:42,538 --> 00:02:45,416
I'm going out later,
so I got up early to get ready.

15
00:02:46,876 --> 00:02:48,419
Why did you come so late last night?

16
00:02:52,464 --> 00:02:54,049
I went to the hospital to see my mom.

17
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:56,677
Has she got better?

18
00:02:58,804 --> 00:03:00,973
She's been deteriorating after her fall.

19
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:03,726
She can't manage her own daily life.

20
00:03:04,894 --> 00:03:07,730
Her dementia is getting worse.

21
00:03:09,023 --> 00:03:11,191
I'm worried soon she won't recognize me.

22
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,528
She must be suffering.

23
00:03:16,572 --> 00:03:18,532
She keeps saying she's tired of living.

24
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:21,076
I really don't know what to do.

25
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:26,081
I think she just doesn't want to live
without dignity.

26
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:29,877
If I were unable to do anything
on my own like her,

27
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:32,338
I'd make the same request.

28
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,842
So you think

29
00:03:36,926 --> 00:03:38,260
I should just let her die?

30
00:03:40,346 --> 00:03:42,473
I just think if that is what she wants,

31
00:03:44,475 --> 00:03:46,143
you should respect that.

32
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:52,274
What do you mean by that?

33
00:03:53,651 --> 00:03:55,736
I'm just saying what I truly think.

34
00:03:57,905 --> 00:04:00,449
What if we were talking about your mother?

35
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:02,159
Would you say the same thing?

36
00:04:03,077 --> 00:04:04,578
Don't get so defensive.

37
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,672
Did I ask your opinion?

38
00:04:15,339 --> 00:04:17,591
What you just said
is simply irresponsible.

39
00:04:17,675 --> 00:04:19,093
You think you're very frank.

40
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:20,886
That's a fault of your generation.

41
00:04:23,055 --> 00:04:25,474
-It's your mother, do whatever you like.
-Listen.

42
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:28,185
You've just known me for a few months,
and you think you know me well?

43
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:31,021
You've known your mother all your life,
do you know her?

44
00:04:31,105 --> 00:04:33,774
-Li Xianhong, what are you doing?
-How dare you judge my family?

45
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:36,193
Why did you have to come to my place
in the middle of the night?

46
00:04:36,694 --> 00:04:38,487
I don't need you that desperately.

47
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:42,741
I've got things to do,
please leave if you're done.

48
00:04:42,825 --> 00:04:44,284
What things to do?

49
00:04:44,368 --> 00:04:46,328
Just organizing your photos
and surfing the net.

50
00:04:46,412 --> 00:04:47,997
-You're just avoiding me.
-Say that again!

51
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,000
This is what I truly think.
Does it piss you off?

52
00:04:51,667 --> 00:04:54,628
I just don't want you to say
anything you will regret.

53
00:04:58,757 --> 00:04:59,758
Get out.

54
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:31,832
I know you're one day late
for my birthday on purpose.

55
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,003
Happy Birthday.

56
00:05:38,172 --> 00:05:41,592
Well, Rong has been looking for you.
Did you turn off your phone?

57
00:05:45,304 --> 00:05:46,138
It's dead.

58
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:47,473
Do you have a charger?

59
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:53,687
Honestly, why do you have to argue
with those youngsters?

60
00:05:53,771 --> 00:05:55,439
Don't you have enough things to deal with?

61
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:56,356
What's wrong?

62
00:05:58,484 --> 00:05:59,651
No way.

63
00:06:01,153 --> 00:06:02,488
Hey!

64
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:03,947
Do you really have no idea?

65
00:06:05,324 --> 00:06:06,784
What?

66
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:09,536
Your conversation with them
was posted online.

67
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,413
It has already gone viral.

68
00:06:13,207 --> 00:06:15,042
Is it such a big deal?

69
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:18,087
Adults can express
different points of view.

70
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:19,004
Come on.

71
00:06:19,088 --> 00:06:22,132
I just said what I truly thought, okay?

72
00:06:22,216 --> 00:06:23,467
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">Do you think…</font></font></i>

73
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:24,593
See for yourself.

74
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:26,095
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">…you could represent the young people?</font></font></i>

75
00:06:26,804 --> 00:06:28,055
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">Have you really met them?</font></font></i>

76
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:30,891
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">If you run for office,</font></font></i>
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">would they vote for you?</font></font></i>

77
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:34,103
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">In our time, we stood up</font></font></i>
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">against the KMT dictatorship.</font></font></i>

78
00:06:34,186 --> 00:06:36,480
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">We used student movements</font></font></i>
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">and pens as our weapons.</font></font></i>

79
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:39,608
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">We fought the tyranny</font></font></i>
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">and dismantled the Eternal Parliament.</font></font></i>

80
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:57,417
I heard you talking about worldviews.
What are your worldviews?

81
00:06:57,501 --> 00:06:58,794
-Well…
-It's nothing.

82
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:00,671
We had an upper-year classmate.

83
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:03,674
We haven't seen him
since he dropped out of university.

84
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:06,593
We heard he became a volunteer
in third-world countries,

85
00:07:06,677 --> 00:07:07,970
travelling around the world.

86
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:10,472
Unlike us, we're trapped
in the Taiwan-China mindset.

87
00:07:10,556 --> 00:07:11,974
We seem narrow-minded.

88
00:07:13,142 --> 00:07:15,853
I don't know
Taiwan is no longer a third-world country.

89
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,355
Mr. Li,

90
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,941
what do you mean by the third world?

91
00:07:21,859 --> 00:07:23,443
Let me put it this way.

92
00:07:23,527 --> 00:07:24,862
Categorized by influence,

93
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:26,321
there are superpowers,

94
00:07:26,405 --> 00:07:28,490
like the United States, Germany, Japan,

95
00:07:28,574 --> 00:07:31,201
and rising latecomers
like China and Russia.

96
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:34,454
There are also
the 17th century maritime powers,

97
00:07:34,538 --> 00:07:37,958
now declining, like the United Kingdom,
the Netherlands and Spain.

98
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:39,751
There are some European countries,

99
00:07:39,835 --> 00:07:42,337
emerging after WWII
and gaining strength slowly

100
00:07:42,421 --> 00:07:44,840
All the others are third-world countries.

101
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:47,342
But third-world countries
are important markets.

102
00:07:47,426 --> 00:07:50,387
You can tell from how much money
China has been investing in Africa lately.

103
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,430
Right.

104
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:54,099
So Mr. Li's worldview
focuses solely on the market?

105
00:07:54,892 --> 00:07:58,061
Don't say it like that.
Markets are indeed important indicators.

106
00:07:58,145 --> 00:08:00,522
Companies in Beijing
are doing global business.

107
00:08:00,606 --> 00:08:05,235
But in Taiwan, besides manufacturing,
transportation and OEM industries,

108
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:07,237
we don't do much global business.

109
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:08,780
We have little influence.

110
00:08:08,864 --> 00:08:11,366
True, but a country's value
is much more than that.

111
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:13,744
There are also
the standard of living, cultural literacy,

112
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:16,622
democracy, the rule of law
and sustainability, etc.

113
00:08:17,456 --> 00:08:20,042
I think what Mr. Li is saying
sounds like a slap in the face

114
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,419
to the hard-working
young generation in Taiwan

115
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:23,712
as if we're not trying our best.

116
00:08:24,213 --> 00:08:28,133
Frankly, I really don't understand
your generation.

117
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:30,260
So Mr. Li,

118
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:31,845
do you think our generation

119
00:08:31,929 --> 00:08:34,389
is not working hard enough
just to earn NT$22,000 each month?

120
00:08:34,473 --> 00:08:35,557
-What are you saying?
-No.

121
00:08:35,641 --> 00:08:36,516
You don't mind, do you?

122
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,018
It's okay. I don't mind.

123
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:40,938
I'm not saying
you're not working hard enough.

124
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:43,690
I'm just saying
in comparison to our generation,

125
00:08:43,774 --> 00:08:47,402
what you think as "hard-working"
is not worth mentioning.

126
00:08:47,486 --> 00:08:48,320
Sorry, Mr. Li.

127
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:50,197
-He's drunk, quite often.
-Shumei, film this.

128
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,532
-Don't mind him.
-Dowming, I'm not that drunk.

129
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:54,243
Frankly speaking,

130
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:56,161
Your generation
didn't create Taiwan's golden age.

131
00:08:56,245 --> 00:08:58,247
It was the war-ravaged generation
before you.

132
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:00,958
They worked hard
to create the MIT brand name,

133
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:03,460
which gave you
a chance to get an education.

134
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,129
Back then, studying abroad
made you look incredible.

135
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:08,340
Speaking English got you
into an international company

136
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:10,050
with a high salary to boot.

137
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:12,261
With a master's degree,
you could teach in the university

138
00:09:12,344 --> 00:09:14,054
and collect a lifetime pension.

139
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:17,182
-Young man, get to the point, okay?
-My point is that…

140
00:09:17,266 --> 00:09:19,226
master's degrees
can no longer get you a job.

141
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:21,520
All the international companies
are moving to China.

142
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:23,522
Even if the young people
are willing to leave home

143
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:24,523
to work in China,

144
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:26,525
our white-collar advantages
no longer exist.

145
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:27,985
I would like to ask Mr. Li.

146
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:31,488
Is it our incompetence,
or that you've taken everything?

147
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:35,617
Let me tell you,
this is classic victim mentality.

148
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:39,663
You think society is unfair to you,
but what effort have you made?

149
00:09:40,289 --> 00:09:42,541
Can drinking coffee change the society?

150
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:44,584
Hate the heat? Get out of the kitchen.

151
00:09:44,668 --> 00:09:48,088
If you just sit at home and type,
success won't fall from the sky.

152
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:51,008
You've taken Taiwan's resources.
Profits go to China, debts stay in Taiwan.

153
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:52,509
You exploit labor in China.

154
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,636
With the money you make,
you buy stocks and real estate.

155
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,305
Young people can't earn enough

156
00:09:56,388 --> 00:09:57,973
to buy a home and get married.

157
00:09:58,056 --> 00:09:59,433
Do you think you are not responsible?

158
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:00,809
All right, let's drink.

159
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:02,185
-Let's drink first.
-Let's eat.

160
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:03,979
I was young once too.

161
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:07,190
The hardships our generation faced
are beyond your imagination.

162
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:09,067
I know it's been hard for you,

163
00:10:09,151 --> 00:10:10,319
but what I'm saying is

164
00:10:10,402 --> 00:10:13,196
you must work it out,
instead of being a loser

165
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,323
and blaming others.

166
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:18,035
Well, Mr. Li, let's eat.

167
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:19,911
Successful people have the right to speak.

168
00:10:19,995 --> 00:10:22,205
The elder's words count at this table.

169
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:24,374
The right to speak has to be earned.

170
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:28,003
Okay, the right to speak
doesn't necessarily belong to the elders.

171
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:30,088
-All right.
-Right, let's eat.

172
00:10:30,172 --> 00:10:32,466
-Let's eat.
-We haven't started eating yet.

173
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:34,634
Mr. Li, I want to ask you.

174
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:37,471
Your company has been shifting to China.

175
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:39,639
You obviously don't understand
young people in Taiwan.

176
00:10:40,223 --> 00:10:41,224
I really don't.

177
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:44,227
You enjoy little joys.
You're losers who can't bear hardship.

178
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:46,313
If something goes wrong,
you hide behind your parents.

179
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:48,148
You avoid leaving graduate school.

180
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:51,068
You complain about the society
in social media.

181
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:52,319
You protest everywhere.

182
00:10:52,903 --> 00:10:56,490
I don't think
this is constructive for Taiwan.

183
00:10:57,824 --> 00:11:00,410
In our time, we stood up
against the KMT dictatorship.

184
00:11:00,494 --> 00:11:02,788
We used student movements
and pens as our weapons.

185
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:04,164
We fought the tyranny

186
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:06,041
and dismantled the Eternal Parliament.

187
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:09,461
After graduating, we worked
as hard as possible to achieve success.

188
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:11,880
We used our strength
to make Taiwan prosperous,

189
00:11:11,963 --> 00:11:14,758
to achieve free speech, democracy
and catch up with the world,

190
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:16,760
and to give you a comfortable life.

191
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:19,137
But you're always disgruntled

192
00:11:19,221 --> 00:11:20,430
and you won't work hard.

193
00:11:20,931 --> 00:11:22,641
Sometimes, I even think

194
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:24,267
Taiwan is falling behind,

195
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:27,145
and your generation
should share the responsibility.

196
00:11:49,668 --> 00:11:53,922
To Jay: When will you come back?

197
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:55,924
When will you come back?

198
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:29,082
-Jay.
-You're here.

199
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:30,709
-Do you need help?
-No.

200
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:32,878
Jay.

201
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:41,011
It's so cool.

202
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:42,846
You can go down there.

203
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,810
-What the heck?
-Be careful.

204
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,947
-Are you certainly going to Shanghai?
-Shanghai.

205
00:13:01,031 --> 00:13:02,365
I haven't decided yet.

206
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:03,909
-I'm going to Beijing.
-So it's decided.

207
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:06,244
-Yes, my friend is making contacts.
-It's decided.

208
00:13:06,328 --> 00:13:07,871
There are also jobs in Taiwan.

209
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:09,748
I'll stay there for three to five years.

210
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:11,875
Three to five years is too long.

211
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:13,168
It's not that bad.

212
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:28,475
Happy Birthday, Tsai Yuqiong.

213
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:30,143
Why are you using my full name?

214
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:33,480
Thank you all.

215
00:13:34,773 --> 00:13:38,360
I wonder when will we meet again
like this next time.

216
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:40,445
-Soon.
-I wonder if Taiwan will still exist.

217
00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:43,073
-What is that?
-Why are you so pessimistic?

218
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:45,158
You should be confident in Ma Ying-jeou.

219
00:13:45,242 --> 00:13:47,410
-How could I be?
-He's been working hard.

220
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:50,664
-What has he done specifically?
-You guys, stop fighting.

221
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:52,499
Tsai Yuqiong, blow out the candles.

222
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:54,084
Ax Kuo is mocking me.

223
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:56,086
-Okay, I'm making my wishes.
-Make your wishes.

224
00:13:56,169 --> 00:14:00,048
My first wish is
Ma Ying-jeou wins the election next year.

225
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:01,174
What kind of wish is that?

226
00:14:01,258 --> 00:14:02,467
What a waste.

227
00:14:02,551 --> 00:14:05,262
-What a lousy wish.
-That's your first wish?

228
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:07,222
My second wish is

229
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:10,100
no matter where we go in the future,

230
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:12,561
we can meet again like this every year.

231
00:14:14,229 --> 00:14:15,480
That is nice.

232
00:14:15,981 --> 00:14:17,399
And my third wish…

233
00:14:20,652 --> 00:14:21,903
-All right.
-Wait.

234
00:14:21,987 --> 00:14:22,946
Let's take some photos.

235
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:24,906
-Right.
-Let's record this moment.

236
00:14:25,407 --> 00:14:26,866
Make sure everyone is in it.

237
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:27,784
Here we go.

238
00:14:28,285 --> 00:14:30,287
-One, two, three.
-Yeah!

239
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,538
One more.

240
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:33,164
-Is it done?
-One, two, three.

241
00:14:33,248 --> 00:14:34,499
Yeah!

242
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:35,792
One, two, three.

243
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:38,628
-Happy birthday.
-Wait.

244
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:40,255
Who thought of buying a cake?

245
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:41,172
Lilian.

246
00:14:41,673 --> 00:14:44,593
I love you, Lily.

247
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:45,635
Cut the cake.

248
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:47,137
Remember to send me the photos.

249
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,263
Let's dig in.

250
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:49,973
Birthday girl must cut the cake.

251
00:15:02,986 --> 00:15:03,945
Jay.

252
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:07,741
What is it?

253
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:09,367
Nothing, just checking on you.

254
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:11,202
I'm getting some beer.

255
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:14,080
-Here.
-Thank you.

256
00:15:17,292 --> 00:15:19,252
Jay, are you really leaving Taiwan?

257
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:22,631
I want to see the ocean.

258
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:28,928
This should be enough.

259
00:15:29,012 --> 00:15:30,305
More than enough.

260
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:31,389
All right.

261
00:15:32,015 --> 00:15:33,683
Okay. Let's go.

262
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:39,230
Write their name with their ass.

263
00:15:39,314 --> 00:15:40,398
Fine.

264
00:15:42,317 --> 00:15:43,568
Holy crap!

265
00:15:43,652 --> 00:15:44,861
He got himself!

266
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,112
Dowming, okay.

267
00:15:46,196 --> 00:15:47,656
Watch my calligraphy, see?

268
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:49,032
See? The first character.

269
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:50,241
Don't fart.

270
00:15:51,493 --> 00:15:52,494
I couldn't tell.

271
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:53,703
This is calligraphy.

272
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:54,829
It is abominable.

273
00:15:54,913 --> 00:15:56,289
My turn, I've been waiting.

274
00:15:56,373 --> 00:15:58,958
Whoever it points to,
I'll give Shumei a kiss.

275
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:00,752
-Who wants to let you kiss?
-He can do that?

276
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:02,420
Go away.

277
00:16:02,504 --> 00:16:04,214
You go away. Don't mess with me.

278
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:05,799
-If you play, you pay.
-No way.

279
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:07,342
Jay, it's your turn.

280
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:08,385
-Yes.
-Come on.

281
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:09,969
-Don't go away.
-You're not playing.

282
00:16:10,053 --> 00:16:11,054
You guys play.

283
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:13,807
-Jay's using his sad eyes to avoid us.
-Yeah!

284
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:16,726
Mr. Zou, come on, have a seat.

285
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:18,645
Here we go.

286
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:19,771
Wait.

287
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:22,148
Whoever it points to, Jay will kiss them.

288
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:24,150
Such a good deal.

289
00:16:25,944 --> 00:16:28,238
-Who is it?
-It's between Guanxian and Lilian.

290
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:30,407
-Who is it?
-No, it points more to Lilian.

291
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,283
-That's right.
-Yeah, I think so.

292
00:16:32,367 --> 00:16:33,535
It does, doesn't it?

293
00:16:33,618 --> 00:16:35,286
We must be fair in this situation.

294
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:36,579
He should kiss us both.

295
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:38,206
Come on, Jay.

296
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:39,999
Okay, here we go.

297
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:45,004
Jay and Lily!

298
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:49,551
-Jay and Lily!
-It's fine. Go ahead.

299
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:52,345
-Jay and Lily!
-Come on.

300
00:16:52,429 --> 00:16:54,848
-Jay and Lily!
-Here he goes!

301
00:17:00,812 --> 00:17:02,480
Next.

302
00:17:02,564 --> 00:17:05,442
Okay, whoever it points to…

303
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:24,377
Did you sleep well last night?

304
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:28,006
It's my first time
staying so close to the sea.

305
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:29,674
I didn't want to waste time sleeping.

306
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,804
When I was little,
I used to sit by the sea alone at night.

307
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,307
I fell asleep listening to the waves.

308
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:40,477
When I first moved to Taipei,

309
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,812
I couldn't sleep
without the sound of the sea.

310
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:47,776
I always admire anyone who can be alone.

311
00:17:49,194 --> 00:17:51,780
I always seem to need someone by my side.

312
00:17:54,449 --> 00:17:55,408
I think…

313
00:17:56,326 --> 00:17:58,036
being alone is a capability.

314
00:17:58,953 --> 00:18:00,914
You need to start by being quiet.

315
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:05,335
If you're with someone
with whom you can't get along with,

316
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,047
you will feel even lonelier.

317
00:18:13,635 --> 00:18:16,554
If you could go anywhere now,
where would you want to go?

318
00:18:18,515 --> 00:18:20,141
It's harder for me

319
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,977
to stay in the same place all the time.

320
00:18:24,229 --> 00:18:25,230
How about you?

321
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:27,232
Where would you wish to go?

322
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:29,484
Greenland.

323
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:33,363
Why?

324
00:18:34,531 --> 00:18:37,075
I want to hear glaciers cracking
with my own ears.

325
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:38,743
They say it sounds like firecrackers.

326
00:18:42,372 --> 00:18:43,998
I want to feel…

327
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:46,751
the scream beneath the utmost tenderness.

328
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:55,218
But I will only travel
with someone I love.

329
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:57,262
Traveling by myself will be too lonely.

330
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:08,606
A philosopher I like once said,

331
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:12,861
"Life is a well of joy,

332
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:16,364
but where the rabble drinks too,

333
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:20,201
all the fountains are poisoned.

334
00:19:24,956 --> 00:19:26,833
I am fond of all that is clean,

335
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:29,961
but I hate to share it with the rabble."

336
00:19:55,403 --> 00:19:56,362
Jay!

337
00:19:57,322 --> 00:19:59,699
Wherever in the world you travel to,

338
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,410
can you please send me a postcard?

339
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:34,419
Long time no see.

340
00:22:01,362 --> 00:22:04,073
We haven't seen each other
for like four or five years.

341
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:06,617
Really?

342
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:10,621
When you're on the sea,

343
00:22:12,707 --> 00:22:14,959
time seems to flow very differently.

344
00:22:18,171 --> 00:22:20,506
It must be tough for you
to be drifting at sea.

345
00:22:23,634 --> 00:22:25,219
That's my life.

346
00:22:27,805 --> 00:22:30,349
Being a wanderer at sea

347
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:32,268
sounds very romantic.

348
00:22:35,188 --> 00:22:36,189
Romantic,

349
00:22:37,148 --> 00:22:38,107
drifting,

350
00:22:38,775 --> 00:22:39,692
wandering,

351
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:41,611
and roaming…

352
00:22:43,321 --> 00:22:47,033
In Chinese writing,
they all have the water component.

353
00:22:54,665 --> 00:22:55,625
How about you?

354
00:22:56,959 --> 00:22:58,169
What about me?

355
00:22:58,252 --> 00:22:59,462
Are you doing well?

356
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:03,883
Pretty good.

357
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:06,677
Do I look like I'm not doing well?

358
00:23:19,816 --> 00:23:22,068
Have you got a chance to visit Greenland?

359
00:23:47,135 --> 00:23:48,052
Jay.

360
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:50,888
May I take some photos of you?

361
00:24:22,712 --> 00:24:23,754
Take it off.

362
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,571
What the fuck?

363
00:30:23,572 --> 00:30:24,782
Asshole.

364
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:37,336
You two assholes.

365
00:43:04,791 --> 00:43:06,001
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">Over the past 20 years,</font></font></i>

366
00:43:06,084 --> 00:43:08,461

367
00:43:08,545 --> 00:43:09,879
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">We started as a publisher</font></font></i>

368
00:43:09,963 --> 00:43:12,215

<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">and creative industries.</font></font></i>

369
00:43:12,299 --> 00:43:15,719
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">And now, we have begun to invest</font></font></i>
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">in projects in mainland China.</font></font></i>

370
00:43:15,802 --> 00:43:19,180

371
00:43:19,264 --> 00:43:21,141
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">is widely recognized</font></font></i>
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">in the Chinese-speaking world.</font></font></i>

372
00:43:21,224 --> 00:43:22,058
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">Certainly.</font></font></i>

373
00:43:22,142 --> 00:43:26,104
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">So we hope that the soft power</font></font></i>
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">of our culture could expand its influence</font></font></i>

374
00:43:26,187 --> 00:43:28,064
to the entire Chinese-speaking community

375
00:43:28,148 --> 00:43:30,150
and tell people in the whole world

376
00:43:30,233 --> 00:43:32,235
that Chinese people love to read,

377
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:33,445
we know how to live

378
00:43:33,528 --> 00:43:35,488
and have the highest taste.

379
00:43:35,572 --> 00:43:36,823
As we can see here,

380
00:43:36,906 --> 00:43:39,451
Mr. Li has repeatedly emphasized

381
00:43:39,534 --> 00:43:42,829
that the driving force
needs to grow from this land.

382
00:43:42,912 --> 00:43:45,665
But what land does he refer to?

383
00:43:46,166 --> 00:43:49,794
There is clearly a significant gap
in points of view between generations.

384
00:43:49,878 --> 00:43:53,673
Many people think
Philo Culture Group should stay in Taiwan,

385
00:43:53,757 --> 00:43:56,426
instead of giving away
our resources elsewhere

386
00:43:56,509 --> 00:43:58,928
and putting young people in Taiwan
in difficult situation.

387
00:43:59,012 --> 00:44:02,432
Okay, let's see
what the young people say on the Internet.

388
00:44:03,016 --> 00:44:04,184
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">Mr. Li,</font></font></i>

389
00:44:04,267 --> 00:44:07,896
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">your company has been shifting to China.</font></font></i>

390
00:44:07,979 --> 00:44:11,066
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">You obviously don't understand</font></font></i>
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">young people in Taiwan.</font></font></i>

391
00:44:11,983 --> 00:44:13,443
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">I really don't.</font></font></i>

392
00:44:13,526 --> 00:44:16,321
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">You enjoy little joys.</font></font></i>
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">You're losers who can't bear hardship.</font></font></i>

393
00:44:16,404 --> 00:44:18,448
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">If something goes wrong,</font></font></i>
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">you hide behind your parents.</font></font></i>

394
00:44:18,531 --> 00:44:20,658
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">You avoid leaving graduate school.</font></font></i>

395
00:44:21,618 --> 00:44:24,329
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">You complain about the society</font></font></i>
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">in social media.</font></font></i>

396
00:44:24,412 --> 00:44:25,789
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">You protest everywhere.</font></font></i>

397
00:44:25,872 --> 00:44:28,249
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">I don't think</font></font></i>
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">this is constructive for Taiwan.</font></font></i>

398
00:44:28,333 --> 00:44:30,293
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">What Li Xianhong said that night</font></font></i>

399
00:44:30,377 --> 00:44:32,253
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">has become viral on the Internet.</font></font></i>

400
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:35,632
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">The power of the people</font></font></i>

401
00:44:35,715 --> 00:44:38,676
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">is like drops of water</font></font></i>
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">which gather into a river.</font></font></i>

402
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:42,597
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">It ultimately becomes a vast force,</font></font></i>
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">a great ocean of the people's will.</font></font></i>

403
00:44:44,015 --> 00:44:45,141
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">At their fingertips</font></font></i>

404
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:47,477
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">lies the world's new tyrant.</font></font></i>

405
00:44:48,353 --> 00:44:50,480
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">They have the power to decide who can stay</font></font></i>

406
00:44:51,106 --> 00:44:52,690
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">and who shall be forgotten.</font></font></i>

407
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,952
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">The same people once made him.</font></font></i>

408
00:45:04,536 --> 00:45:05,995

409
00:45:06,579 --> 00:45:07,539
