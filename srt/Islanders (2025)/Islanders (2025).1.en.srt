16
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:32,713
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

17
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:37,801
-Good morning, Rong.
-Good morning.

18
00:03:45,059 --> 00:03:46,060
Good morning.

19
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,394
Good morning.

20
00:03:51,649 --> 00:03:52,483
Good morning.

21
00:03:56,987 --> 00:03:58,405
Good Morning, Rong.

22
00:03:58,489 --> 00:03:59,573
Morning, Qiong.

23
00:03:59,657 --> 00:04:01,283
Is the interview all set up?

24
00:04:01,367 --> 00:04:04,495
Don't worry, I'm on top of it.
They arrived early to set it up.

25
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:06,872
And Hong Lifang?

26
00:04:06,956 --> 00:04:08,749
Ms. Hong is getting
her makeup done in there.

27
00:04:09,792 --> 00:04:12,294
-Take good care of her.
-Okay.

28
00:04:12,795 --> 00:04:13,921
I'll take a look.

29
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:15,714
Rong.

30
00:04:15,798 --> 00:04:17,758
I started setting it up last night.

31
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:20,260
I work so hard.
Don't I deserve a thumbs-up?

32
00:04:20,344 --> 00:04:22,096
You talk back too much.

33
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,181
Hello, nice to meet you.

34
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,099
Hello.

35
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:27,101
Hello, everyone.

36
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:28,477
Thanks for the hard work!

37
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,980
-Thank you all for coming.
-Thanks, everyone. Good work.

38
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,439
-Qiong?
-Yes.

39
00:04:32,523 --> 00:04:34,233
-Where will the Chairman sit?
-He'll sit here.

40
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:35,567
Okay.

41
00:04:36,402 --> 00:04:37,403
By the way, Rong,

42
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:40,114
TFF sent an invitation to the Chairman.

43
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:43,325
There's an exhibition in New York
from the 1st to the 5th next month.

44
00:04:43,409 --> 00:04:46,161
The Chairman is not available
before the 10th. He'll be in China.

45
00:04:46,245 --> 00:04:47,913
But he's interested in a few paintings.

46
00:04:47,997 --> 00:04:48,914
I'll contact them.

47
00:04:48,998 --> 00:04:50,624
-Okay.
-Where is he? In the office?

48
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:51,834
He's not here yet.

49
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:53,252
-Not here yet?
-Yes.

50
00:04:53,335 --> 00:04:54,712
He said he'd come in early today.

51
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:57,798
-Oh, shoot.
-What is it?

52
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:01,093
Nothing, I'm wondering
if it's because of the dinner last night.

53
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:02,761
What happened last night?

54
00:05:02,845 --> 00:05:04,888
Well, nothing really.

55
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:07,057
-I'll call the Chairman now.
-I'm already on it.

56
00:05:07,141 --> 00:05:08,976
-Take care of the set.
-Oh, okay.

57
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:10,728
Rong, leave it to me. No problem.

58
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:24,283
Hello, Lifang.

59
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:28,495
I'm sorry but the Chairman is stuck
in traffic, you will have to wait.

60
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:29,830
Long time no see, Rong.

61
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:32,666
Wait, I should address you
Mr. Executive Assistant now.

62
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,126
You can still call me Rong.

63
00:05:34,877 --> 00:05:35,961
It must have been two years.

64
00:05:36,045 --> 00:05:38,964
We met at Patrick's place last time,
with your boss, right?

65
00:05:39,048 --> 00:05:39,923
Uh-uh.

66
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:42,176
-It's been four years.
-It's been that long?

67
00:05:43,427 --> 00:05:45,846
Ms. Shen, allow me to introduce you.

68
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:47,598
-This is Ms. Hong Lifang.
-Ms. Hong.

69
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:48,932
-Hello.
-Nice to meet you.

70
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:51,185
You look younger and prettier in person.

71
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:52,811
You are too kind, Ms. Xiaowen.

72
00:05:52,895 --> 00:05:54,146
Just call me Xiaowen.

73
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:55,230
Lifang,

74
00:05:55,314 --> 00:05:58,609
Ms. Shen specially came back from China
a day early to meet you.

75
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,736
Am I that important? I am flattered.

76
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:03,155
So, during the interview,
please go easy on us.

77
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:04,948
I'm actually very nice!

78
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:06,658
So, is he on his way?

79
00:06:06,742 --> 00:06:07,826
Well…

80
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:08,744
He's late.

81
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:11,246
Shall we wait in the conference room?

82
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:12,414
-Sure!
-Come, please.

83
00:06:12,498 --> 00:06:13,624
I should congratulate you.

84
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:15,084
Your company has been on the rise.

85
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:16,293
He still has it!

86
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,462
Yes, Xianhong is truly a visionary.

87
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:20,756
He's laid out the blueprint
for the company.

88
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:22,925
I hope you're included in that blueprint.

89
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:24,635
I'm just kidding, Ms. Xiaowen.

90
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:26,428
-My mouth was too mean, sorry.
-No worries.

91
00:06:26,512 --> 00:06:29,181
I like the way you host your show.
You're humorous.

92
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:34,770
-Qiong.
-Yes?

93
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:38,607
Tell me. What happened last night?

94
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:40,901
Nothing. Well…

95
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:43,070
-You don't have to worry…
-He's not answering my calls.

96
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:44,071
The Chairman…

97
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:45,656
The Chairman is here.

98
00:06:46,657 --> 00:06:47,491
Mr. Li!

99
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:50,160
You had me worried. Why are you so late?

100
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:52,704
I'm okay. Anything wrong with me?

101
00:06:52,788 --> 00:06:54,498
Did you have a lot to drink last night?

102
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:55,499
Not much.

103
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:57,292
I had dinner
with Qiong and her classmates.

104
00:06:57,376 --> 00:06:58,836
Oh, I see.

105
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:02,005
Ms. Hong has been waiting for you.

106
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:04,424
-Do you need to get changed?
-No.

107
00:07:04,508 --> 00:07:05,884
How about make-up and hair?

108
00:07:05,968 --> 00:07:07,511
Really, no need. I'm fine.

109
00:07:09,513 --> 00:07:10,806
Lifang.

110
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:13,058
Li Xianhong!

111
00:07:13,142 --> 00:07:14,768
How dare you make me wait?

112
00:07:14,852 --> 00:07:15,769
I'm sorry.

113
00:07:15,853 --> 00:07:17,020
Let me buy you dinner.

114
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:18,605
You said the same thing four years ago.

115
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:20,649
My bad.

116
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:22,151
How about this?

117
00:07:22,234 --> 00:07:23,485
We'll go to Patrick's.

118
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:25,112
You like his cooking, right?

119
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:27,573
What? Are you afraid I'll eat you up?

120
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:30,742
Your mouth is still as mean as ever.

121
00:07:31,243 --> 00:07:33,162
All right. Let's get started.

122
00:07:33,245 --> 00:07:36,456
Five, four, three, two…

123
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,041
Hello, everyone.

124
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:40,669
Welcome to <i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">Three Links Across the Strait.</font></font></i>
I am Hong Lifang.

125
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:43,088
Our guest today is
a legend across the Strait,

126
00:07:43,172 --> 00:07:46,049
Mr. Li Xianhong,
Chairman of the Philo Culture Group.

127
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:47,801
There's been a rumor that

128
00:07:47,885 --> 00:07:51,513
China is very interested in the cultural
and creative section in your group.

129
00:07:51,597 --> 00:07:54,975
Both sides are actively discussing
the possibility of future collaboration.

130
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:56,810
We'd like Mr. Li to talk to us

131
00:07:56,894 --> 00:07:58,896
about your vision
for expanding into China,

132
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:02,191
as well as the differences
in how cultural industries operate.

133
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,278
Over the past 20 years, customers
in Taiwan have been very supportive.

134
00:08:06,862 --> 00:08:08,113
We started as a publisher

135
00:08:08,197 --> 00:08:10,324
and have moved into bookstore
and creative industries.

136
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:13,744
And now, we have begun to invest
in projects in mainland China.

137
00:08:14,328 --> 00:08:17,497
I believe Taiwan's cultural literacy
and appreciation

138
00:08:17,581 --> 00:08:19,917
is widely recognized
in the Chinese-speaking world.

139
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,918
Certainly.

140
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:24,546
We hope that the soft power
of our culture could expand its influence

141
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,632
to the entire Chinese-speaking community

142
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:28,467
and tell people in the whole world

143
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,344
-that Chinese people love to read
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">-Li Xianhong.</font></font></i>

144
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:31,345
we know how to live…

145
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:33,388
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">He's my first love.</font></font></i>

146
00:08:34,306 --> 00:08:35,724
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">More accurately,</font></font></i>

147
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:37,851
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">it is my unrequited love.</font></font></i>

148
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,648
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">I'd like to share</font></font></i>
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">what a philosopher once said.</font></font></i>

149
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:44,858
Have you heard of Nietzsche?

150
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:50,614
He said, "He who has a why to live

151
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:52,824
can bear almost any how."

152
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:56,578
If one knows
what is most important in life,

153
00:08:57,663 --> 00:09:00,040
they will not be beaten by any obstacles.

154
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:03,126
At that time, I deeply believed that

155
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:06,004
as long as you pursue your dreams
in a free atmosphere,

156
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:09,508
the world will always open doors for you.

157
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:11,843
Right now, you may think

158
00:09:11,927 --> 00:09:14,805
getting into a good university
is most important.

159
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:16,515
But what about after that?

160
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:19,184
Perhaps, you will want to fall in love.

161
00:09:19,977 --> 00:09:21,353
I was the same in my youth.

162
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:24,398
But having experienced martial law,

163
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:26,149
I can deeply understand

164
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:29,319
what it feels like
to be locked up and deprived of freedom.

165
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:32,990
Perhaps, you will experience loss
in the future.

166
00:09:33,991 --> 00:09:35,659
Then you will understand

167
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:37,494
what is most important to you.

168
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:42,624
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">After graduating from high school,</font></font></i>

169
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:46,795
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">I read all the books written by Nietzsche</font></font></i>
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">during that summer.</font></font></i>

170
00:09:47,296 --> 00:09:49,381
Don't you think he has X-ray eyes?

171
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:51,883
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">And I chose philosophy</font></font></i>
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">as my major at university.</font></font></i>

172
00:09:51,967 --> 00:09:54,344
If he hadn't identified
those Swedish forgeries,

173
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:55,679
I'd have made a mistake.

174
00:09:56,805 --> 00:09:58,974
Does he need funding for his research?

175
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:03,478
Just tell him not to worry about funding.

176
00:10:03,562 --> 00:10:04,479
We'll finance it.

177
00:10:05,147 --> 00:10:05,981
Thanks.

178
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:13,113
You're really amazing!

179
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:15,699
I just had a craving for egg fried rice,
and here you are.

180
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:18,618
I know you like it.

181
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:22,581
It might not be like your mom's,
but it is good enough.

182
00:10:23,415 --> 00:10:26,001
Honestly, I really miss that taste.

183
00:10:26,585 --> 00:10:27,419
Look.

184
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:31,798
If the chef is skilled,
the rice won't stick together.

185
00:10:31,882 --> 00:10:34,134
-Every single grain…
-is coated with egg.

186
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:37,763
I remember that,
so I've visited many places.

187
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:40,140
This one is passable. Give it a try.

188
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:43,143
You really get me.

189
00:10:59,034 --> 00:11:00,118
By the way, sir.

190
00:11:00,744 --> 00:11:03,872
I talked to you last time
about setting up a Facebook account.

191
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:05,290
Have you thought about it?

192
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:07,125
I've already told you

193
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:09,461
I'm not interested
in that online stuff, okay?

194
00:11:12,381 --> 00:11:13,340
But sir.

195
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:15,258
Facebook has become very popular.

196
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:16,843
Many businesses have set up accounts

197
00:11:16,927 --> 00:11:19,554
and use Facebook
as their main promotional platform.

198
00:11:19,638 --> 00:11:21,306
Plus, our target audience is young people.

199
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:22,849
-And…
-I only need you.

200
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:25,435
Tell you what,

201
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,354
you take care of the online stuff.

202
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:28,814
I trust you, okay?

203
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:32,275
Okay.

204
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:36,738
Come to think of it.

205
00:11:36,822 --> 00:11:38,657
If I ever set up a Facebook account,

206
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:41,576
that means you've been replaced.

207
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,669
I'm just teasing you.

208
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:55,298
Right.

209
00:11:57,634 --> 00:11:58,635
Bro.

210
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:01,805
Patrick! What brings you here?

211
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:03,723
Do I need a reason to visit you?

212
00:12:04,975 --> 00:12:06,601
Wow. This is good stuff.

213
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:08,728
This is Rong.

214
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:10,981
-I'm Patrick.
-Nice to meet you.

215
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:12,149
Don't be so formal.

216
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:13,525
I'm not as old as him.

217
00:12:14,276 --> 00:12:15,527
He's a friend from university.

218
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,779
He got his master's in the UK.

219
00:12:17,863 --> 00:12:19,948
He was in the Wild Lily student movement.

220
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:22,033
Why are you boring the kid with this?

221
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:25,162
You are eating already.
I wanted to invite you to dinner.

222
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:27,539
Rong is very considerate.
He brought me my favorite food.

223
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:29,708
Let me tell you.

224
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:31,710
Patrick is an amazing cook.

225
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:34,129
Back in college,
we always ate at his place.

226
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:36,590
Come on, what are you implying?

227
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:37,757
How about this?

228
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:39,384
Come to my place next week. I'll cook.

229
00:12:39,885 --> 00:12:40,844
Rong, join us!

230
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:43,096
Okay. We'll go together.

231
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:46,641
-Cheers.
-Sure.

232
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:03,658
Mr. Li, Ms. Hong.

233
00:13:03,742 --> 00:13:06,119
I've brought you some tea.
Please enjoy it.

234
00:13:06,203 --> 00:13:08,330
Is Pu'er tea okay? A friend gave it to me.

235
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:10,290
-It's mellow…
-Latte for me, thanks.

236
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:12,000
No problem. Be right back.

237
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:17,714
You don't drink coffee, do you?

238
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:20,425
Sorry, my wife.

239
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:23,803
-I'll give you some privacy.
-It's okay. Please sit down.

240
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:26,806
Hello?

241
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,309
Yes, I'm in a meeting.

242
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:31,561
What's with Mom?

243
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:34,397
Okay. I see.

244
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:37,317
Uh, I'll head over tonight.

245
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:39,528
All right, bye.

246
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,156
Is your mom okay?

247
00:13:43,949 --> 00:13:46,159
Oh, she's fine.

248
00:13:46,243 --> 00:13:47,160
She's just…

249
00:13:47,244 --> 00:13:48,286
getting older.

250
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:50,789
So…

251
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,416
Your wife's taking care of her?

252
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:56,545
Hmm.

253
00:13:59,673 --> 00:14:01,424
I remember how nice she is to you.

254
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:04,302
You only met her once. How would you know?

255
00:14:05,095 --> 00:14:06,429
It is obvious.

256
00:14:07,973 --> 00:14:10,475
-Ms. Hong, here's your latte.
-Thank you.

257
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:12,018
Enjoy it.

258
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:17,190
I've always wanted to ask you, why Bach?

259
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:22,153
Well…

260
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:23,989
I'm not sure.

261
00:14:25,407 --> 00:14:27,117
But whenever I listen to Bach,

262
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:29,911
my mind seems to be clearer.

263
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:35,750
His music is so precise and logical,

264
00:14:35,834 --> 00:14:38,795
but it is also very emotional.

265
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:41,423
It makes me feel…

266
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:45,093
close to God.

267
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:47,637
I didn't know you were religious.

268
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:48,847
Nah, I'm not.

269
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:50,307
But my mom is very pious.

270
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:53,059
I used to go to church with her
when I was a kid.

271
00:14:56,688 --> 00:14:57,981
I'm sorry to interrupt.

272
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:01,234
It's fine. What's up?

273
00:15:01,318 --> 00:15:04,279
It's lunchtime.
Shall we go for lunch together?

274
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:06,531
Lifang can join us.

275
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:08,450
No, thanks.

276
00:15:09,034 --> 00:15:10,243
I have other plan.

277
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:15,081
Even though we are in the 21st century,

278
00:15:15,165 --> 00:15:19,085
take a look at the illegal activities
in international waters around the world.

279
00:15:19,169 --> 00:15:20,795
They're getting worse and worse.

280
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:23,089
Some even involve human trafficking.

281
00:15:23,173 --> 00:15:26,801
Some people argue that open sea fisheries
are the origin of all these problems.

282
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:29,346
How about us?

283
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:32,641
Taiwan is an island
with a maritime culture.

284
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:35,310
Shouldn't we join
the international legal community?

285
00:15:36,353 --> 00:15:39,147
Unfortunately,
we cannot participate in the discussion

286
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:42,025
of United Nations Convention
on the Law of the Sea.

287
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:44,611
-Bye. Study hard.
-Bye.

288
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:46,363
-Bye.
-Bye.

289
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:47,864
-Bye.
-Study hard.

290
00:15:49,032 --> 00:15:49,866
Bye.

291
00:15:54,204 --> 00:15:58,083
To Chen Hanrong: How did the interview go?

292
00:16:04,089 --> 00:16:11,054
From Patrick: How did the interview go?

293
00:16:13,515 --> 00:16:17,811
It went well. She's pretty good though.
Trying to dig out insider information.

294
00:16:26,403 --> 00:16:33,368
Dinner together tonight?

295
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:55,640

I tagged you in the photo
at the restaurant last night.

301
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:28,483
A window to my world.

302
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:30,318
Wish I were as pretty as you!

303
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:32,320
The loveliest traveler in the world!

304
00:18:32,403 --> 00:18:34,948

-It hurts!
-It hurts because you keep moving.

322
00:19:55,153 --> 00:19:56,529
Stop hitting me! Go away!

323
00:19:56,613 --> 00:19:58,114
Just bear it a bit longer.

-Just bear it.
-Where's my doctor?

325

Call my doctor here.

328
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:06,664
It hurts so much.

329
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,168
Mr. Li.

330
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:11,753
I'm sorry.

331
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:12,670
I'm late.

332
00:20:12,754 --> 00:20:14,047
It's okay.

333
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:16,591
Mrs. Li isn't feeling well today.

334
00:20:16,674 --> 00:20:19,594
Last night, we gave her
an extra half dose of sedative.

335
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,473
Her condition is getting worse.

336
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:25,266
We've been monitoring her.

337
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:26,309
Don't worry.

338
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,121
-Don't! I said no.
-It's not…

339
00:20:47,205 --> 00:20:48,790
-It hurts.
-It's all right.

340
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:51,292
-Why are you torturing me?
-No, we're not.

341
00:20:51,376 --> 00:20:53,962
-Why are you torturing me?
-The nurse is gone. It's okay.

342
00:20:54,045 --> 00:20:55,380
You are fine now, Mom.

343
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:57,340
No more, the doctor said no more.

344
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:58,716
Okay? No more.

345
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,885
You are fine now Mom.

346
00:21:00,969 --> 00:21:02,303
Xiaowen?

347
00:21:04,389 --> 00:21:05,848
Mom, I'm Xianhong.

348
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:07,475
Look,

349
00:21:07,976 --> 00:21:09,978
I've brought you
your favorite vegetarian dumplings.

350
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:14,691
Mom.

351
00:21:16,234 --> 00:21:17,652
Please forgive me.

352
00:21:17,735 --> 00:21:20,113
I've been so busy.
I'm in China all the time.

353
00:21:20,822 --> 00:21:24,075
I haven't had much time to see you.
I'm really sorry.

354
00:21:27,829 --> 00:21:28,788
Xianhong.

355
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:33,835
I feel so tired.

356
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:36,671
Mom.

357
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:39,590
If you're tired,

358
00:21:39,674 --> 00:21:41,384
just rest and get some sleep.

359
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:43,177
Don't let your imagination run wild, okay?

360
00:21:43,261 --> 00:21:44,804
Let me go, please.

361
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:46,389
Let me go in peace.

362
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:49,225
-Let me go, please.
-Mom, don't be like this.

363
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:50,184
I'm in pain.

364
00:21:50,268 --> 00:21:52,478
-Don't you know that?
-Mom, don't say that.

365
00:21:52,562 --> 00:21:54,522
I know, I know that, Mom.

366
00:21:54,605 --> 00:21:56,399
Mom…

367
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:58,818
Mom, listen to me. Please, Mom.

368
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:01,154
Mom, calm down.

369
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:03,489
Please listen to me, okay?

370
00:22:03,573 --> 00:22:06,034
Listen to me.
I won't do this to you anymore.

371
00:22:06,117 --> 00:22:08,661
I won't put you through this anymore.

372
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:11,831
Listen to me,
everything's going to be fine.

373
00:22:13,124 --> 00:22:14,042
Get some sleep.

374
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:52,955
I'm home.

375
00:22:53,664 --> 00:22:55,875
That was fast. No traffic jam today?

376
00:22:56,793 --> 00:22:59,170
-What's going on here?
-I'm not done yet.

377
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:00,880
What's not done yet? What are you doing?

378
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:03,966
I'm making you dinner, what else?

379
00:23:04,801 --> 00:23:07,428
Chen Hanrong is cooking now?

380
00:23:07,512 --> 00:23:08,721
You're so annoying.

381
00:23:09,931 --> 00:23:11,224
What are you making?

382
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:12,767
Egg fried rice!

383
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:13,684
Go away.

384
00:23:13,768 --> 00:23:15,561
I don't need your help. I can do this.

385
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:20,608
Hey. Tell me.

386
00:23:21,109 --> 00:23:22,401
What exactly happened?

387
00:23:22,485 --> 00:23:24,028
You know perfectly well.

388
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:33,663
-Let me ask you.
-About Xianhong?

389
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:34,580
Yeah.

390
00:23:35,123 --> 00:23:37,708
Has he recently met someone
whom I don't know?

391
00:23:37,792 --> 00:23:40,878
I've been wondering when you'd ask me.
What have you noticed?

392
00:23:42,171 --> 00:23:43,923
Well, it was yesterday.

393
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:46,592
He got a call
after we played golf with a client

394
00:23:46,676 --> 00:23:48,344
and left me at the metro station.

395
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:49,303
Wasn't he rude?

396
00:23:54,976 --> 00:23:57,770
LI XIANHONG

397
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:01,023
Li Xianhong, Philo Culture Group.

398
00:24:01,107 --> 00:24:03,109
There's no profile picture. Is this him?

399
00:24:04,569 --> 00:24:06,112
He has a Facebook account now?

400
00:24:06,696 --> 00:24:09,073
Have you forgot to tell me
that you're his Facebook friend?

401
00:24:09,157 --> 00:24:12,535
Why are you asking so much?
Apparently, he doesn't want you to know.

402
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:14,620
Of course I need to know.

403
00:24:14,704 --> 00:24:17,081
He once made personal plans
without telling me.

404
00:24:17,165 --> 00:24:19,625
We were supposed to meet a foreign curator
but I couldn't find him.

405
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:22,837
He did ask me
about a student I taught before.

406
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:23,963
Who?

407
00:24:26,507 --> 00:24:28,342
Here, it's her Facebook page.

408
00:24:30,136 --> 00:24:31,846
She moved back from New York.

409
00:24:31,929 --> 00:24:33,556
She's rather good-looking.

410
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:35,975
She's smart and a good influencer.
She even made the news.

411
00:24:36,684 --> 00:24:39,687
She majored in visual communication
or something like that.

412
00:24:43,691 --> 00:24:44,817
What's that?

413
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:48,779
It literally means,
a curator of some sort of experience.

414
00:24:48,863 --> 00:24:49,864
I have no idea.

415
00:24:57,997 --> 00:24:59,999
So, can we order takeout now?

416
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:03,002
I'm definitely making this dinner.

417
00:25:08,216 --> 00:25:10,384
But I wouldn't dare eat anything you cook.

418
00:25:13,971 --> 00:25:16,891
Every grain of rice
should be coated with egg.

419
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:25,274
LI XIANHONG

420
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:38,287
I haven't played golf
in Taiwan for a long time.

421
00:25:39,163 --> 00:25:40,831
We have the best golf courses.

422
00:25:40,915 --> 00:25:42,375
The service is impeccable.

423
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:45,169
After all, Taiwan has
the best service industry.

424
00:25:46,671 --> 00:25:47,672
Chairman Chen.

425
00:25:48,339 --> 00:25:50,800
If you need anything, just let Rong know.

426
00:25:50,883 --> 00:25:52,301
He's been with me for years.

427
00:25:52,385 --> 00:25:53,928
He is attentive and capable.

428
00:25:54,011 --> 00:25:57,390
He attends to the details more than I do.

429
00:25:57,473 --> 00:25:59,934
With him around, I don't have to worry.

430
00:26:01,352 --> 00:26:02,979
Of course. No problem.

431
00:26:05,231 --> 00:26:06,607
Chairman Chen, please enjoy it.

432
00:26:06,691 --> 00:26:08,234
-I'm getting out now.
-Sure.

433
00:26:08,317 --> 00:26:09,568
I'll see you around.

434
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:08,669
Lifang!

435
00:27:08,753 --> 00:27:11,088
If you're not in a hurry,
let's talk a bit longer.

436
00:27:11,172 --> 00:27:12,715
Oh, sure.

437
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:14,884
I think you still look great!

438
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:16,218
You too! Look at you.

439
00:27:16,302 --> 00:27:17,887
You still look great in a suit.

440
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:18,804
Thanks, I try.

441
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:29,940
Here you are.

442
00:27:35,571 --> 00:27:37,406
What makes you want to come today?

443
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:40,284
How about I miss you?

444
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:46,207
Are you okay?

445
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:50,753
Are you asking about me or my mom?

446
00:27:51,879 --> 00:27:54,673
I visited her a few days ago.
She was doing quite well.

447
00:27:55,341 --> 00:27:56,967
This is common for old people.

448
00:27:57,051 --> 00:27:59,804
Their health could deteriorate
in just a few days.

449
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:15,528
Well, try not to think about that now.

450
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:17,154
Just relax.

451
00:28:37,216 --> 00:28:38,801
Do you remember Chairman Chen?

452
00:28:41,262 --> 00:28:42,388
Of course.

453
00:28:43,556 --> 00:28:46,183
His businesses in China
are doing quite well.

454
00:28:46,267 --> 00:28:48,269
A good relationship with him is helpful.

455
00:28:49,145 --> 00:28:51,313
But the situation with China is shifting,

456
00:28:51,897 --> 00:28:53,941
and the media landscape changes rapidly.

457
00:28:56,444 --> 00:28:59,405
Our top priority
should be our expansion plan.

458
00:29:01,323 --> 00:29:03,576
Once we've got connections in China,

459
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:05,953
whatever is labeled as a cultural product

460
00:29:06,036 --> 00:29:07,788
will become a viral hit.

461
00:29:14,503 --> 00:29:16,172
When you're in Taiwan,

462
00:29:16,255 --> 00:29:18,340
you have
your father-in-law's financial support.

463
00:29:18,966 --> 00:29:21,385
But I think
China has its own set of rules.

464
00:29:22,678 --> 00:29:24,013
You have to be careful.

465
00:29:26,432 --> 00:29:29,018
Having you by my side,
I've got nothing to be afraid of.

466
00:29:33,397 --> 00:29:35,024
Once I've succeeded there,

467
00:29:35,816 --> 00:29:36,984
I'll bring you over.

468
00:29:51,999 --> 00:29:53,000
Come.

469
00:30:26,492 --> 00:30:27,368
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">Patrick.</font></font></i>

470
00:30:28,744 --> 00:30:30,412
Happy Birthday.

471
00:30:31,664 --> 00:30:32,873
Oh…

472
00:30:33,791 --> 00:30:36,335
You didn't say anything when I came in.
I thought you forgot.

473
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:38,504
I remember it every year.
How could I forget?

474
00:30:38,587 --> 00:30:40,756
Wasn't it obvious when you saw me cooking?

475
00:30:41,674 --> 00:30:43,008
But there's no cake.

476
00:30:43,801 --> 00:30:45,553
Fried rice is like a cake.

477
00:30:45,636 --> 00:30:49,139
I made the fired rice myself.
Isn't it better than a store-bought cake?

478
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:55,521
Can I make my wishes now?

479
00:31:07,241 --> 00:31:08,200
Oh…

480
00:31:09,493 --> 00:31:11,328
You know my wishes before I say them.

481
00:31:13,789 --> 00:31:14,915
I'll make the wishes myself.

482
00:31:16,834 --> 00:31:18,377
My first wish is

483
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:21,005
I won't age so fast and lose so much hair.

484
00:31:21,964 --> 00:31:22,965
My second wish…

485
00:31:23,507 --> 00:31:26,051
Gosh, I wish my students
can be more intelligent,

486
00:31:26,135 --> 00:31:28,387
or my brain cells will die too fast.

487
00:31:29,388 --> 00:31:30,389
My third wish…

488
00:32:01,712 --> 00:32:04,381
Aren't you tired
of making the same wishes every year?

489
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:10,012
Today is very special.

490
00:32:10,638 --> 00:32:13,432
You're the only person in the world

491
00:32:13,515 --> 00:32:17,144
to have tasted the fried rice
personally made by Chen Hanrong.

492
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,065
Although it is not very tasty,

493
00:32:21,148 --> 00:32:23,484
-however…
-Actually, it's terrible.

494
00:33:13,826 --> 00:33:15,536
When we are in love with someone,

495
00:33:16,036 --> 00:33:17,746
it's because we love

496
00:33:18,539 --> 00:33:20,624
who we are when we're with them.

497
00:33:30,551 --> 00:33:31,844
Love…

498
00:33:31,927 --> 00:33:34,054
is purely a physiological need.

499
00:35:52,734 --> 00:35:54,862
After the joy of intimacy,

500
00:35:54,945 --> 00:35:57,197
the relief of seeing each other naked

501
00:35:58,782 --> 00:36:02,077
makes happiness and desire
indistinguishable.

502
00:36:04,037 --> 00:36:05,998
The nature of desire is not possession,

503
00:36:06,915 --> 00:36:08,834
but the moment of its unattainability…

504
00:36:10,919 --> 00:36:12,754
that keeps us yearning endlessly.

505
00:37:29,331 --> 00:37:32,918
Lilian Lin with Li Xianhong and two others
Double Date it is.

506
00:37:44,054 --> 00:37:49,977
Lilian Lin with Li Xianhong and two others
Double Date it is.

507
00:37:51,979 --> 00:37:52,896
Sir,

508
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:57,192
I called the restaurant that you wanted,
but they are fully booked today.

509
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:59,695
-Did you tell them it was for me?
-Yeah.

510
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:01,113
They sincerely apologized.

511
00:38:06,451 --> 00:38:08,912
Should we go to the restaurant
that I booked?

512
00:38:08,996 --> 00:38:10,747
I told Chairman Chen's son
to meet us there.

513
00:38:10,831 --> 00:38:13,166
It's easier if he goes there
straight from the airport.

514
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:15,127
What kind of restaurant?

515
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:17,879
It's an American restaurant,
as I'm also meeting my classmate.

516
00:38:17,963 --> 00:38:21,299
She just got back from the US,
so I thought it would be more…

517
00:38:21,383 --> 00:38:22,467
You know…

518
00:38:22,551 --> 00:38:24,094
You're meeting your classmate?

519
00:38:25,012 --> 00:38:26,471
Do you think it is okay?

520
00:38:38,775 --> 00:38:39,735
Here we are.

521
00:38:55,042 --> 00:38:57,627
Do you think
we can talk business at this place?

522
00:39:00,088 --> 00:39:02,632
I'll search right now. Well…

523
00:39:02,716 --> 00:39:04,384
There should be other options.

524
00:39:04,468 --> 00:39:07,220
There's a Sichuan restaurant
with a rating of 3.2 stars.

525
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,185
My classmate is here.

526
00:39:22,486 --> 00:39:23,528
Sir,

527
00:39:23,612 --> 00:39:25,405
I'll call to make a reservation
right away.

528
00:39:25,489 --> 00:39:28,366
It should be easy.
I know the people at the restaurant.

529
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:30,535
-It's okay. I'll tell my friend.
-No need.

530
00:39:30,619 --> 00:39:32,120
-This one is fine.
-Huh?

531
00:39:34,164 --> 00:39:35,082
Okay.

532
00:39:59,022 --> 00:39:59,898
So…

533
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:03,068
Qiong said that
you just came back from New York.

534
00:40:03,151 --> 00:40:03,985
Yes.

535
00:40:04,069 --> 00:40:05,487
Are you familiar with New York?

536
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:09,241
Yeah, I graduated from NYU.

537
00:40:09,324 --> 00:40:10,158
Really?

538
00:40:10,659 --> 00:40:11,493
Which year?

539
00:40:12,452 --> 00:40:13,620
Many years ago.

540
00:40:13,703 --> 00:40:14,955
New York has changed a lot.

541
00:40:15,038 --> 00:40:15,872
It must have.

542
00:40:15,956 --> 00:40:17,290
It's been a while since I was there.

543
00:40:17,791 --> 00:40:19,793
Honestly, I admire your courage.

544
00:40:22,462 --> 00:40:25,006
You somehow hired Qiong
to be your secretary.

545
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:27,968
-Hey!
-She's the one who needs a secretary.

546
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:29,511
I'm not that bad!

547
00:40:29,594 --> 00:40:32,973
Only she would arrange a business meeting
and meet her friend as a double date.

548
00:40:33,056 --> 00:40:34,474
Hey, stop it!

549
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:41,773
Qiong.

550
00:40:41,857 --> 00:40:42,983
Go see if Aaron has arrived?

551
00:40:43,066 --> 00:40:43,942
Sure.

552
00:40:49,197 --> 00:40:50,782
Sorry for intruding on your meeting.

553
00:40:51,658 --> 00:40:52,701
It's fine.

554
00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:55,036
Anyway, we might just end up chatting.

555
00:40:57,873 --> 00:40:58,832
Thank you.

556
00:40:58,915 --> 00:41:00,584
Feel free to order whatever you want.

557
00:41:01,418 --> 00:41:02,669
Today, we'll go Dutch.

558
00:41:04,421 --> 00:41:05,797
Certainly it will be my treat.

559
00:41:05,881 --> 00:41:06,840
Why?

560
00:41:06,923 --> 00:41:08,383
I am the guy.

561
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:10,343
Why should guys pay for girls?

562
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:15,056
Unless they're dating.

563
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:16,099
Then it's okay.

564
00:41:17,184 --> 00:41:18,894
Occasional generosity is affectionate.

565
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:21,396
Aaron is here!

566
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:23,190
-Long time no see, Aaron.
-Long time no see.

567
00:41:23,732 --> 00:41:25,275
-Aaron, please sit.
-Okay.

568
00:41:25,775 --> 00:41:27,736
-This is my friend, Lilian, Lily.
-Nice to meet you.

569
00:41:27,819 --> 00:41:28,987
Nice to meet you.

570
00:41:30,071 --> 00:41:30,906
How's your dad?

571
00:41:30,989 --> 00:41:31,823
He's great.

572
00:41:31,907 --> 00:41:33,992
-He plays golf three times a week.
-Really?

573
00:41:34,075 --> 00:41:34,951
He said

574
00:41:35,035 --> 00:41:37,329
he can't find a golf buddy like you.

575
00:41:37,871 --> 00:41:39,497
He'll be back in October. We'll play golf.

576
00:41:39,581 --> 00:41:40,498
Sure.

577
00:41:40,582 --> 00:41:41,917
No problem. It's a deal.

578
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,711
Uncle, how did you find this restaurant?

579
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:52,052
Last time, we talked on the phone

580
00:41:52,135 --> 00:41:53,845
about some big construction projects.

581
00:41:53,929 --> 00:41:56,806
Is it feasible to open a mall in them now?

582
00:41:57,474 --> 00:41:59,226
It's more difficult than I thought,

583
00:41:59,309 --> 00:42:00,769
but I know someone.

584
00:42:00,852 --> 00:42:02,479
He's my bro, so I think

585
00:42:02,562 --> 00:42:05,190
if I push your project a bit more,
it should be fine.

586
00:42:05,273 --> 00:42:06,107
Okay, thanks.

587
00:42:06,733 --> 00:42:08,693
Aaron sounds like he's the boss!

588
00:42:09,694 --> 00:42:11,947
Nah. We're all just good friends.

589
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:13,865
I'm thinking, if it goes well,

590
00:42:13,949 --> 00:42:15,659
we could move in the year after.

591
00:42:16,743 --> 00:42:17,744
-Great.
-Yep

592
00:42:19,579 --> 00:42:20,705
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

593
00:42:20,789 --> 00:42:21,748
Aaron, please.

594
00:42:21,831 --> 00:42:22,916
-Wait.
-Let's dig in.

595
00:42:22,999 --> 00:42:23,959
Let's take a picture.

596
00:42:31,174 --> 00:42:32,592
Don't bring it up again.

597
00:42:32,676 --> 00:42:34,719
Uncle, What's your Facebook username?

598
00:42:34,803 --> 00:42:35,637
I'll tag you.

599
00:42:37,722 --> 00:42:38,598
I don't have one.

600
00:42:38,682 --> 00:42:39,516
-You don't?
-No.

601
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:40,433
He doesn't?

602
00:42:40,934 --> 00:42:42,435
-How about you?
-I'll enter it.

603
00:42:42,936 --> 00:42:44,271
-I'll add you as a friend.
-Okay.

604
00:42:44,354 --> 00:42:45,230
Add me too.

605
00:42:45,313 --> 00:42:46,690
Sure, let's add each other.

606
00:42:47,983 --> 00:42:48,984
Do you use WeChat?

607
00:42:49,067 --> 00:42:51,361
I did, but I haven't used it
since I got back from New York.

608
00:42:51,861 --> 00:42:52,779
Add me on WeChat.

609
00:42:52,862 --> 00:42:54,447
-If you come to Shanghai,
-Sure.

610
00:42:54,531 --> 00:42:55,991
-it will be easier to contact me.
-Okay.

611
00:42:56,074 --> 00:42:58,159
-Add me on your WeChat.
-Sure, let's add each other.

612
00:42:58,243 --> 00:42:59,828
Uncle's friends are my friends.

613
00:42:59,911 --> 00:43:01,454
-We must thank Uncle then.
-Here, done.

614
00:43:02,831 --> 00:43:05,292
