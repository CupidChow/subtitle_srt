16
00:02:32,695 --> 00:02:35,114
Qiong: Lily, what happened
between you and Effie?

17
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:40,828
How come you just disappeared?
We're all worried about you.

18
00:03:58,155 --> 00:03:59,448
Babe, I'm going out.

19
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:02,451
-Why?
-I have to attend my boss' interview.

20
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:04,161
Stephanie?

21
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:06,914
-Yes, Steph. What?
-Steph.

22
00:04:07,665 --> 00:04:10,209
Didn't we talk about this last time?
Not again.

23
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:12,795
I know,
but she is making you work on Sundays.

24
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:14,213
I should be jealous.

25
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:22,012
You don't need to be jealous.

26
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,057
Jealousy is for people
who lack confidence.

27
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:28,102
Furthermore,

28
00:04:28,811 --> 00:04:30,646
I'm the one who should be jealous.

29
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:32,189
Your classmate.

30
00:04:45,703 --> 00:04:47,204
Please don't.

31
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,331
Don't! No. No!

32
00:04:49,415 --> 00:04:50,624
-Greenland.
-Greenland.

33
00:04:52,668 --> 00:04:55,004
What? What do you have against Greenland?

34
00:04:56,088 --> 00:04:57,715
You know I hate the cold.

35
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,301
And my work schedule is unpredictable.

36
00:05:01,385 --> 00:05:04,972
Plus, I can't take long holidays
to go somewhere so far away…

37
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:06,974
like Greenland.

38
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:13,981
I haven't been there, as I'm waiting
for the person I love to go with me.

39
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:21,030
Why can't the person I love
prefer somewhere warmer?

40
00:05:21,113 --> 00:05:22,364
For example,

41
00:05:23,032 --> 00:05:25,993
Cambodia or the Philippines.

42
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:31,874
You really can't stay?

43
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:37,129
-But I…
-But, but,

44
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:39,548
but you have to go save the world.

45
00:05:40,883 --> 00:05:42,885
Isn't that the reason why you love me?

46
00:05:45,054 --> 00:05:46,138
One of many.

47
00:06:04,073 --> 00:06:05,115
Here's your coffee.

48
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:11,830
How come you're working by yourself today?

49
00:06:13,332 --> 00:06:15,292
I fired that girl.

50
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,668
You fired another one?

51
00:06:17,628 --> 00:06:18,796
She's just uncreative.

52
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:20,464
How uncreative?

53
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:24,093
Last week,
she unexpectedly took two days off,

54
00:06:24,176 --> 00:06:26,095
saying it's her grandmother's funeral.

55
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:28,472
What's uncreative about it?

56
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:34,228
That was her grandma's fourth funeral.

57
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:39,775
Should I come help you out after my class?

58
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,653
No need. It's not that busy anyway.

59
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:46,115
Do you want something to drink?

60
00:06:46,198 --> 00:06:48,700
You got the dark roast Panama winey
from last time?

61
00:06:48,784 --> 00:06:50,119
That one ran out ages ago.

62
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:53,956
Why don't you try something else?

63
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:55,666
Light-roast is more interesting.

64
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:57,793
I like that one. Why should I change?

65
00:06:57,876 --> 00:07:00,796
You wouldn't know unless you try.
You may find something better.

66
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:07,678
It seems you're implying something else.

67
00:07:09,388 --> 00:07:11,265
Your girlfriend didn't come with you.

68
00:07:12,391 --> 00:07:13,475
She's busy.

69
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:16,770
On a Sunday morning?

70
00:07:16,854 --> 00:07:17,688
Yeah.

71
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:22,484
You should check out
whatever she's so busy with.

72
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:27,364
I'm getting in.

73
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,494
Table for two?

74
00:07:51,555 --> 00:07:54,349
Babe: At least tell me how you're doing.
Drop me a message, okay?

75
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:11,992
I've quit my job…missing u…

76
00:08:22,544 --> 00:08:24,379
Lily, you're okay?

77
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:03,353
I bought your favorite oyster omelet.

78
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:04,438
Double eggs.

79
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:05,605
With chili sauce.

80
00:10:15,574 --> 00:10:16,408
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">Hello, Babe.</font></font></i>

81
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:17,743
Where are you?

82
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:22,080

84
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,923
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">Talk to you later. Love you.</font></font></i>

85
00:10:56,948 --> 00:10:59,284
I still believe our demands are flawless.

86
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:02,704
I think energy policy should focus
on adjusting the industrial structure,

87
00:11:02,788 --> 00:11:05,540
improving energy education
and conserving energy.

88
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:07,501
These have to be done simultaneously.

89
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:10,587
So, reducing electricity demand
is top priority.

90
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:12,422
You think so too?

91
00:11:12,506 --> 00:11:13,340
Mm-hmm.

92
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:16,718
How about we take a break?

93
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:20,347
-Take a break.
-Hmm…

94
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:22,933
Let me recharge you.

DELETE PHOTO

104
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:33,873
I will visit Kai Capital,

105
00:14:33,957 --> 00:14:38,670
because they are the best in the industry
at financial planning and tax management.

106
00:14:40,255 --> 00:14:41,965
Our revenue has been dropping.

107
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:43,633
We're losing money every month.

108
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:44,759
We need a solution.

109
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,929
We have to adjust our business model.

110
00:14:48,972 --> 00:14:52,642
I think readers are still around.
They just aren't reading physical books.

111
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:54,519
Perhaps we can consider e-books,

112
00:14:54,603 --> 00:14:56,896
or create more profit in our retail space.

113
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:59,566
I've come up with a few plans
that might be helpful.

114
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:03,111
These won't be enough.

115
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:08,617
We have to rely on the Chinese market
to get through this hurdle.

116
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:18,585
All right.

117
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:20,253
I know.

118
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,048
You truly love books.

119
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:27,677
Changing the bookstore model
must have been very difficult for you.

120
00:15:31,348 --> 00:15:34,392
I do miss the days
working as an assistant editor.

121
00:15:35,143 --> 00:15:39,814
I only needed to work on the books I loved
and contact my favorite authors.

122
00:15:39,898 --> 00:15:43,193
Unlike now,
I'm dealing with numbers every day.

123
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:44,819
I often feel like

124
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:48,114
I'm drifting farther away
from my aspirations.

125
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:57,040
Thank you for everything.

126
00:15:58,249 --> 00:16:00,001
Once everything is set up in China,

127
00:16:00,502 --> 00:16:02,253
I'll definitely bring you over.

128
00:16:02,337 --> 00:16:04,047
Let you put your talents to work.

129
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:06,216
All right, I understand.

130
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:07,967
You keep saying that.

131
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:11,346
Sir! About that…

132
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:13,348
Why can't you knock first?

133
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:15,600
I'm sorry. I apologize.

134
00:16:16,768 --> 00:16:17,602
Excuse me.

135
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:23,149
Qiong is unbelievable.

136
00:16:25,276 --> 00:16:27,153
Are you meeting with Chairman Chen's son?

137
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:28,655
Aaron, right?

138
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:29,572
Yeah.

139
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:32,158
I feel more at ease
if a Taiwanese works for me over there.

140
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:33,952
True.

141
00:16:34,035 --> 00:16:36,371
Chairman Chen is well connected.
We should use this wisely.

142
00:16:36,955 --> 00:16:38,998
You should get ready. Don't be late.

143
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,085
-All right. I'm going.
-Mm-hmm.

144
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:48,216
Sir.

145
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:49,426
Wait a moment, please.

146
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:51,261
I have something very serious to tell you.

147
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:53,722
What is it?

148
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,354
Do you think
we can talk business at this place?

149
00:17:04,399 --> 00:17:06,901
I'll search right now. Well…

150
00:17:06,985 --> 00:17:08,570
There should be other options.

151
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:11,406
There's a Sichuan restaurant
with a rating of 3.2 stars.

152
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:15,952
My classmate is here.

153
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:35,889
It says you are an experience curator.
What exactly do you do?

154
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,099
Let me put it this way.

155
00:17:38,183 --> 00:17:39,768
Many people go to New York,

156
00:17:39,851 --> 00:17:42,645
but they only visit places
like the Statue of Liberty,

157
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:45,273
Times Square
and the Empire State Building, right?

158
00:17:45,356 --> 00:17:48,818
But I can set up
a utterly different New York experience.

159
00:17:48,902 --> 00:17:50,945
For example,
if you want a suspenseful experience,

160
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:54,365
I can take you at midnight
to the spot where John Lennon was shot.

161
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:57,911
I could even hire a gunman to aim at you.

162
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,000
I also take my clients
to visit hidden gems in Europe.

163
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:07,545
Basically, they only need to pay
my planning fee and travel expenses.

164
00:18:07,629 --> 00:18:08,922
I can also take photos for them.

165
00:18:10,173 --> 00:18:13,051
So, it's kind of like a tour guide, right?

166
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:20,058
It's not wrong if you put it like that.

167
00:18:20,141 --> 00:18:23,269
But even the oldest skills
can be marketed by trendy new names.

168
00:18:23,937 --> 00:18:25,522
It just depends
on who can come up with it.

169
00:18:30,235 --> 00:18:32,779
This is the song from our university camp.

170
00:18:41,496 --> 00:18:42,914
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">From now on…</font></font></i>

171
00:20:19,928 --> 00:20:20,887
Okay.

172
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:21,846
Um…

173
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:23,431
Let's do this again next time.

174
00:20:28,645 --> 00:20:31,314
Now I know whom to call
next time I come back.

175
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,693
Uncle, is your chauffeur off the clock?

176
00:20:35,777 --> 00:20:37,070
Can I offer you a ride?

177
00:20:38,446 --> 00:20:40,531
Maybe I can escort the ladies home.

178
00:20:40,615 --> 00:20:43,576
No need. We can just take a walk.

179
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:44,494
Thank you, sir.

180
00:20:45,203 --> 00:20:46,120
-Thanks.
-Okay.

181
00:20:47,956 --> 00:20:49,916
-Bye.
-Uncle, the car is over there.

182
00:20:56,965 --> 00:21:00,802
Lily, thank you for helping me out today.
I've never seen my boss so relaxed.

183
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:03,972
I think Uncle is quite cute.

184
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:07,767
Uncle is quite cute?

185
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:10,520
You can do whatever you want.
Just don't get me fired.

186
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:12,313
I've only been back for a month.
What can I do?

187
00:21:14,315 --> 00:21:16,317
-How many do you want?
-I want them all!

188
00:21:16,401 --> 00:21:18,778
-Non-stop drinking today!
-Okay, that's enough.

189
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:20,279
Enough.

190
00:21:20,363 --> 00:21:23,199
-You're too much.
-So why did you suddenly come back?

191
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,952
When you suddenly disappeared previously,
we were all worried about you.

192
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:27,495
We thought you were suicidal.

193
00:21:28,496 --> 00:21:29,789
That is ridiculous.

194
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:32,125
I'm fine, okay?

195
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:35,336
Back then, we all thought you liked Jay.

196
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:38,006
But later, you got together with Effie.

197
00:21:38,089 --> 00:21:41,843
Your range seemed to be very wide.

198
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:46,973
Jay liked being alone.

199
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:51,561
I didn't want to be the person
who got in his way.

200
00:21:53,396 --> 00:21:55,314
Can I ask you now?

201
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:58,276
You and Effie seemed
to be getting along well.

202
00:21:58,359 --> 00:21:59,861
What happened between you two?

203
00:21:59,944 --> 00:22:03,364
Stop pushing me for the details.
You've been asking since I got back.

204
00:22:03,448 --> 00:22:05,533
I have to take this chance to ask you.

205
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:09,078
When you were away,
I had to eat by myself.

206
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:13,249
Ax and Shumei were kind of dating.
They annoyed me.

207
00:22:14,042 --> 00:22:15,877
Dowming and some others moved to China.

208
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:19,547
I've been here by myself.
I'm nearly bored to death.

209
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:21,841
Now you're back.

210
00:22:22,884 --> 00:22:24,552
So you are…

211
00:22:24,635 --> 00:22:25,678
You're too much!

212
00:22:30,391 --> 00:22:32,018
It's so good to have you back.

213
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:16,539
Uncle.

214
00:24:28,176 --> 00:24:30,261
Are you all right? Something snapped?

215
00:24:30,761 --> 00:24:31,929
Should we move to another seat?

216
00:24:32,013 --> 00:24:33,014
I'm fine.

217
00:24:35,183 --> 00:24:36,058
Okay.

218
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:37,643
I'm good.

219
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:42,607
I saw your photography work on Facebook.

220
00:24:43,691 --> 00:24:44,525
Very impressive.

221
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:47,069
How so?

222
00:24:47,945 --> 00:24:49,030
You don't believe me?

223
00:24:50,531 --> 00:24:51,991
Anyone can say "impressive."

224
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:54,535
I'm more interested
in how you find it impressive.

225
00:24:55,411 --> 00:24:57,622
The reason I like your work is…

226
00:24:58,206 --> 00:25:02,752
whether you're photographing
people or objects,

227
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:05,922
like a tree or a chair,

228
00:25:06,714 --> 00:25:08,382
they all look like portraits.

229
00:25:09,467 --> 00:25:12,970
It feels like, in your eyes,
they're more than just objects.

230
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:17,850
They're more like
profound dramatic experiences.

231
00:25:19,393 --> 00:25:21,187
Very poetic and very romantic,

232
00:25:21,812 --> 00:25:24,815
with just a hint of innocence.

233
00:25:29,362 --> 00:25:32,448
A photographer I really admire once said,

234
00:25:32,949 --> 00:25:36,911
"what we capture is just a reflection
of ourselves we see in others."

235
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:39,038
So…

236
00:25:39,121 --> 00:25:41,290
have I seen the real you?

237
00:25:44,585 --> 00:25:46,420
Am I that easy to be seen through?

238
00:25:51,384 --> 00:25:52,677
Two Americanos.

239
00:25:53,261 --> 00:25:54,136
Thank you.

240
00:25:54,762 --> 00:25:55,680
Careful. It's hot.

241
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:57,265
Thank you.

242
00:26:09,694 --> 00:26:12,280
I've been really curious
about what you mentioned last time,

243
00:26:12,363 --> 00:26:14,282
experience curator, yeah,

244
00:26:14,365 --> 00:26:16,242
and why you came back to Taiwan.

245
00:26:16,993 --> 00:26:19,078
Actually, I can be
an experience curator anywhere.

246
00:26:19,161 --> 00:26:20,830
Right now, I'm more interested

247
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:23,082
in exploring hidden gems
in Asian countries.

248
00:26:23,165 --> 00:26:26,752
Many of my classmates
are doing well in China,

249
00:26:26,836 --> 00:26:29,297
so I might go check it out sometime.

250
00:26:30,339 --> 00:26:32,800
But I also wonder
if the people who stay in Taiwan

251
00:26:32,883 --> 00:26:34,885
would envy those who've gone to China?

252
00:26:36,804 --> 00:26:39,932
Don't you think
people always desire what they don't have?

253
00:26:44,145 --> 00:26:45,271
In what way?

254
00:26:45,855 --> 00:26:48,607
China's economy is so strong now.
Everyone has to pay attention to it.

255
00:26:48,691 --> 00:26:51,694
Taiwan's only edge now
is its democracy and freedom.

256
00:26:52,194 --> 00:26:56,782
But honestly, democracy and freedom
feel as natural as air to my generation.

257
00:26:56,866 --> 00:27:00,494
If you have air but no money,
life isn't that great, right?

258
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:05,041
If you had experienced
the fight for democracy and freedom,

259
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:08,210
your generation
might appreciate it a bit more.

260
00:27:08,294 --> 00:27:09,628
Now you're doing business in China,

261
00:27:09,712 --> 00:27:11,672
don't you care
about their political system?

262
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:14,633
Are you not bothered
to see people deprived of freedom?

263
00:27:14,717 --> 00:27:15,885
What can I do about it?

264
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:18,346
Besides, that's a separate issue.

265
00:27:18,429 --> 00:27:19,930
Politics is politics.

266
00:27:20,014 --> 00:27:21,349
Business is business.

267
00:27:21,432 --> 00:27:23,601
Honestly, I think they have their freedom.

268
00:27:24,393 --> 00:27:26,896
You sound like Faust
making a deal with the devil.

269
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:30,316
Are you scared?

270
00:27:38,407 --> 00:27:41,452
Would you like me
to set up a special experience for you?

271
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:46,207
A special experience?

272
00:27:47,708 --> 00:27:49,543
What? Are you scared?

273
00:27:53,547 --> 00:27:54,715
I have one question.

274
00:27:55,966 --> 00:27:57,968
Is it okay for me to pay the bill today?

275
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:19,365
Like this, upward.

276
00:28:20,157 --> 00:28:21,283
Yes.

277
00:28:23,994 --> 00:28:24,829
Don't turn.

278
00:28:24,912 --> 00:28:26,247
Don't twist your body.

279
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,374
Wait.

280
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:29,291
That turn.

281
00:28:37,258 --> 00:28:38,843
My, are you trying to kill me?

282
00:28:40,511 --> 00:28:41,345
Are you tired?

283
00:28:42,346 --> 00:28:43,347
What do you think?

284
00:29:09,957 --> 00:29:11,917
How did you get that scar on your back?

285
00:29:16,881 --> 00:29:19,300
My second Christmas in New York.

286
00:29:19,383 --> 00:29:21,010
I fell asleep in my apartment.

287
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:26,765
And in my dream, this alien showed up.

288
00:29:35,733 --> 00:29:36,859
I was being serious.

289
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:39,487
It came toward me slowly.

290
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:44,450
And then it asked me if I was lonely.

291
00:29:45,034 --> 00:29:47,703
I didn't say anything,
but somehow it just knew,

292
00:29:49,497 --> 00:29:51,499
like our minds were connected.

293
00:29:55,878 --> 00:29:57,713
Suddenly, my whole body felt hot,

294
00:29:58,881 --> 00:30:00,090
like I was burning.

295
00:30:04,178 --> 00:30:06,347
At that moment, I saw this glacier.

296
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:09,642
Without thinking, I just jumped right in.

297
00:30:12,686 --> 00:30:13,896
After that, I woke up.

298
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:21,028
I thought maybe 20 minutes had passed,
but it had been hours,

299
00:30:23,906 --> 00:30:25,991
as if time had been stolen.

300
00:30:36,252 --> 00:30:37,461
Why didn't you take the shot?

301
00:30:37,545 --> 00:30:38,879
The lighting wasn't right.

302
00:30:54,603 --> 00:30:56,605
What time has the best lighting?

303
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:01,777
You should ask
where has the best lighting.

304
00:31:09,451 --> 00:31:11,912
83 degrees 39 minutes north latitude.

305
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:14,873
Where is that?

306
00:32:55,182 --> 00:32:57,601
You can't drive.
Why would you pick up the car?

307
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,978
I do have a driver's license.

308
00:33:01,855 --> 00:33:03,607
You don't really know how to drive.

309
00:33:03,691 --> 00:33:05,275
How do you know I can't drive?

310
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:06,777
Only Li Xianhong doesn't know that.

311
00:33:07,277 --> 00:33:10,280
After all these years,
he still asked you to pick up the car.

312
00:33:12,658 --> 00:33:14,451
He doesn't know many things.

313
00:33:17,871 --> 00:33:19,998
Then why are you still so devoted to him?

314
00:33:20,874 --> 00:33:21,959
Turn your head.

315
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,924
See, I actually know you pretty well.

316
00:33:29,591 --> 00:33:31,176
That's a different matter.

317
00:33:31,885 --> 00:33:33,887
People break up
because they know each other too well.

318
00:33:34,555 --> 00:33:36,223
Then I don't know you that well.

319
00:33:36,932 --> 00:33:39,476
There's so much about you I don't know.
I don't know where you live.

320
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,978
I don't know when your birthday is.

321
00:33:41,061 --> 00:33:44,064
And I don't know
that sexy mole on your inner thigh either.

322
00:33:44,148 --> 00:33:45,357
Nonsense.

323
00:33:51,989 --> 00:33:52,948
Are you hungry?

324
00:33:53,949 --> 00:33:54,783
A little.

325
00:33:59,037 --> 00:33:59,997
You can eat this.

326
00:34:03,876 --> 00:34:05,919
Get out of here!

327
00:34:06,003 --> 00:34:07,463
Go away. You're so annoying!

328
00:34:08,505 --> 00:34:10,090
Fine. I'll cook some noodles.

329
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:12,468
Patrick.

330
00:34:15,012 --> 00:34:16,221
Thank you so much.

331
00:34:34,323 --> 00:34:36,700

<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">is imperative.</font></font></i>

334
00:34:41,914 --> 00:34:44,875
Ax Kuo got over a thousand likes.

335
00:34:44,958 --> 00:34:46,668
You're an internet sensation now.

336
00:34:47,377 --> 00:34:49,755
I'm discussing current affairs.

337
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:52,424
I'm different
from those internet celebrities, okay?

338
00:34:52,508 --> 00:34:54,510
Besides, my followers
can think for themselves.

339
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:56,094
Green DPP activists.

340
00:34:56,178 --> 00:34:57,679
They are still followers.

341
00:34:57,763 --> 00:35:00,849
-They just love to see you all worked up.
-I tell the truth.

342
00:35:00,933 --> 00:35:04,186
-Of course you think yours is the truth.
-No, I'm right about nuclear power.

343
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:06,230
-Every time you talk about politics…
-I miss you two.

344
00:35:06,313 --> 00:35:07,731
You're always bickering.

345
00:35:07,815 --> 00:35:09,817
I come back to watch you two.

346
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:10,734
-So noisy!
-Yeah!

347
00:35:10,818 --> 00:35:11,860
-All right.
-Come on.

348
00:35:11,944 --> 00:35:12,986
Forget it. Let's order.

349
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:14,613
Hakka stir-fry, I've been eyeing it.

350
00:35:14,696 --> 00:35:15,989
One Hakka stir-fry.

351
00:35:18,784 --> 00:35:20,452
I don't know why you must insist.

352
00:35:20,536 --> 00:35:22,120
I can take the bus or metro.

353
00:35:22,996 --> 00:35:24,373
It's on my way, anyway.

354
00:35:30,963 --> 00:35:33,715
Do you feel embarrassed
if your friends see me with you?

355
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:36,134
It's not about me being embarrassed.

356
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:39,888
I haven't seen them in a long time.
I want to have a nice dinner with them.

357
00:35:39,972 --> 00:35:42,140
You have nothing to talk about with them.

358
00:35:42,766 --> 00:35:43,767
How so?

359
00:35:43,851 --> 00:35:45,561
Don't you and I have plenty to talk about?

360
00:35:50,566 --> 00:35:52,317
Hakka stir-fry, spicy intestines.

361
00:35:52,401 --> 00:35:54,111
-Fish head casserole.
-These should be enough.

362
00:35:54,194 --> 00:35:56,238
-Roast chicken.
-Large one for this.

363
00:35:56,321 --> 00:35:57,239
Sure, large one.

364
00:35:57,322 --> 00:35:59,157
-Yes, thank you.
-Okay, have a seat.

365
00:35:59,241 --> 00:36:00,075
Thanks.

366
00:36:22,598 --> 00:36:25,183
Was that my boss?
Did he give you a ride here?

367
00:36:25,267 --> 00:36:27,144
He insisted. I wanted to take the metro.

368
00:36:27,811 --> 00:36:29,813
Have you guys been hanging out
for the past two months?

369
00:36:29,897 --> 00:36:31,398
We're just friends.

370
00:36:31,481 --> 00:36:33,442
We're just friends.

371
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:34,359
You're annoying.

372
00:36:34,902 --> 00:36:37,613
Don't mess it up.
It would be awkward for me.

373
00:36:37,696 --> 00:36:38,614
What would be awkward?

374
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:41,783
-I work under him. I…
-Lilian.

375
00:36:41,867 --> 00:36:44,161
-What are you whispering there?
-We're coming.

376
00:36:44,244 --> 00:36:46,204
-Don't just stand there.
-No.

377
00:36:47,289 --> 00:36:49,082
Friendship forever!

378
00:36:49,166 --> 00:36:51,752
How many years have you guys been there?
Five or six years.

379
00:36:51,835 --> 00:36:52,794
Not that long.

380
00:36:52,878 --> 00:36:54,588
-Three and a half years.
-Three and a half?

381
00:36:54,671 --> 00:36:56,089
That is still a long time.

382
00:36:56,173 --> 00:36:57,883
Are you following our chat group?

383
00:36:57,966 --> 00:36:59,301
-I am.
-Do you read our messages?

384
00:36:59,384 --> 00:37:01,011
I do read. I just hardly reply.

385
00:37:01,094 --> 00:37:02,220
I do follow you guys.

386
00:37:02,304 --> 00:37:04,890

<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">Hong Lifang…</font></font></i>

390
00:37:09,144 --> 00:37:11,313
What a disgusting shameless guy.

391
00:37:11,396 --> 00:37:12,773
What kind of interview is this?

392
00:37:13,607 --> 00:37:14,858
People like that are shameless.

393
00:37:14,942 --> 00:37:16,985
They've taken Taiwan's resources
to China to earn RMB.

394
00:37:17,069 --> 00:37:18,654
-Isn't it disgusting?
-Don't get worked up.

395
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:20,489
Yeah, why would you even say that?

396
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:23,408
I stayed up late at the office
to set up this interview.

397
00:37:23,492 --> 00:37:25,577
He is also my boss. Show some respect.

398
00:37:25,661 --> 00:37:26,703
These are different things.

399
00:37:26,787 --> 00:37:29,206
He is your boss,
but he's also done unscrupulous things.

400
00:37:29,331 --> 00:37:31,458
-What has he done wrong?
-Bad people must face criticism.

401
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:33,460
If I see him on the street,
I'll throw eggs at him.

402
00:37:33,543 --> 00:37:36,129
-Tell me, what has he done wrong?
-Yeah, what has he done wrong?

403
00:37:36,213 --> 00:37:37,839
What's wrong with him
making money in China?

404
00:37:37,923 --> 00:37:40,300
Our company
has over 400 families to support.

405
00:37:40,384 --> 00:37:41,301
Come on.

406
00:37:41,385 --> 00:37:43,261
If you dare to egg him, I will…

407
00:37:43,345 --> 00:37:45,764
-crush your balls.
-No physical assaults!

408
00:37:45,847 --> 00:37:46,932
Shumei still needs them.

409
00:37:47,015 --> 00:37:50,018
Wait. I agree with Qiong.
Earning RMB in Beijing is perfectly fine.

410
00:37:50,102 --> 00:37:52,854
Really! 10 years of hard work in Taiwan
earns less than one year in China.

411
00:37:52,938 --> 00:37:54,731
-It's true.
-With your salary in Taiwan,

412
00:37:54,815 --> 00:37:56,942
-can you afford to buy a house?
-Besides,

413
00:37:57,025 --> 00:37:58,610
after the Olympics and the World Expo,

414
00:37:58,694 --> 00:38:00,904
-Shanghai has become super globalized.
-I think your problem

415
00:38:00,988 --> 00:38:02,197
is that you've never been there.

416
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,281
You haven't seen it.

417
00:38:03,365 --> 00:38:05,325
If you had been there even once,

418
00:38:05,409 --> 00:38:07,119
you'd have realized
it's not what you imagined.

419
00:38:07,202 --> 00:38:08,537
I'm telling you.

420
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:11,832
I don't need to go.
I can already imagine what it's like.

421
00:38:11,915 --> 00:38:14,251
What was our major? Mass Communication.

422
00:38:14,334 --> 00:38:15,544
What's most important?

423
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:16,878
Media values.

424
00:38:16,962 --> 00:38:17,921
Press freedom.

425
00:38:18,005 --> 00:38:19,715
They treat these like crap in China.

426
00:38:19,798 --> 00:38:21,758
-I haven't heard this for a while.
-Don't exaggerate.

427
00:38:21,842 --> 00:38:23,176
-It is that bad.
-It's really not.

428
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:25,429
Listen to me, Ax, Chinese-style freedom

429
00:38:25,512 --> 00:38:27,264
-needs to be experienced to understand.
-Yeah.

430
00:38:27,347 --> 00:38:28,765
-Don't be so arrogant.
-Yeah!

431
00:38:28,849 --> 00:38:30,851
The sensitive topics
aren't so different from Taiwan.

432
00:38:30,934 --> 00:38:32,769
Wang Dowming, you've sunk too low.

433
00:38:32,853 --> 00:38:35,272
The fact you are avoiding
these sensitive topics

434
00:38:35,355 --> 00:38:36,690
is itself self-censorship!

435
00:38:36,773 --> 00:38:37,607
Yes, it is.

436
00:38:37,691 --> 00:38:39,234
That is exactly what it is!

437
00:38:40,569 --> 00:38:42,029
I just came from the Legislative Yuan.

438
00:38:42,112 --> 00:38:45,157
I thought I could have some peace here,
but you're as noisy.

439
00:38:46,033 --> 00:38:47,868
-Who's doing self-censorship?
-Ax Kuo!

440
00:38:47,951 --> 00:38:48,910
No, I'm not.

441
00:38:48,994 --> 00:38:50,245
Shumei, take a seat.

442
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:52,456
-Come here, You're late.
-Come.

443
00:38:52,539 --> 00:38:54,750
You must finish this drink first.

444
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:55,876
-Punishment?
-You're so busy.

445
00:38:55,959 --> 00:38:57,252
-Okay.
-All together.

446
00:38:57,836 --> 00:38:59,254
-Cheers, everyone.
-Together.

447
00:39:01,757 --> 00:39:03,425
Such a rare opportunity.
Let's take a picture.

448
00:39:03,925 --> 00:39:05,594
What a pity, Jay isn't here.

449
00:39:05,677 --> 00:39:06,678
Well, I'm here.

450
00:39:06,762 --> 00:39:08,638
How dare you compare yourself to Jay?

451
00:39:08,722 --> 00:39:10,849
I'm telling you, you need to get out more.

452
00:39:21,735 --> 00:39:23,945
Come on, enough about worldviews.

453
00:39:24,029 --> 00:39:26,156
-Get closer. Come on
-Photo time.

454
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:29,076
-Everyone, look here.
-One, two, three, and worldviews.

455
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:31,536
One, two, three.

456
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:34,748
Worldview.

457
00:39:35,332 --> 00:39:36,666
What the hell is that?

458
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:39,711
-What do you mean by worldview?
-Send the photo to the group, Qiong.

459
00:39:42,964 --> 00:39:44,257
Boss, what are you doing here?

460
00:39:49,846 --> 00:39:51,306
Let me introduce you.

461
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:53,225
This is my boss, Mr. Li Xianhong.

462
00:39:53,308 --> 00:39:54,643
I'm sure you all know him.

463
00:39:54,726 --> 00:39:55,852
-Yes.
-Hi.

464
00:39:55,936 --> 00:39:57,813
These are my university friends.

465
00:39:57,896 --> 00:39:59,898
They usually work in China.

466
00:39:59,981 --> 00:40:01,900
Shumei works at the Legislative Yuan,

467
00:40:01,983 --> 00:40:04,152
and Ax Kuo is currently in law school.

468
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:07,155
Lilian. You met her before.

469
00:40:08,865 --> 00:40:10,700
-Boss, have you eaten yet?
-Not yet.

470
00:40:10,784 --> 00:40:11,910
Well, come join us!

471
00:40:11,993 --> 00:40:12,828
Yes.

472
00:40:12,911 --> 00:40:14,538
-If you don't mind…
-Of course not.

473
00:40:14,621 --> 00:40:16,456
-Sir, this way.
-Here.

474
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:17,999
Have a seat, sir.

475
00:40:20,001 --> 00:40:21,920
Tell you what, it will be my treat

476
00:40:22,003 --> 00:40:23,296
Order whatever you like.

477
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:24,631
-Seriously?
-Thank you!

478
00:40:24,714 --> 00:40:25,841
-Thank you, sir.
-Thank you.

479
00:40:25,924 --> 00:40:28,135
Qiong, get a few bottles of white wine
from next door.

480
00:40:28,218 --> 00:40:29,094
Sure, no problem.

481
00:40:29,177 --> 00:40:33,348
Sir, the news was just talking
about your interview.

482
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:35,183
Now you're already sitting with us.

483
00:40:35,267 --> 00:40:37,018
We have to thank Qiong for this!

484
00:40:37,102 --> 00:40:38,311
-Yeah.
-Right.

485
00:40:38,395 --> 00:40:39,563
Thank you!
