1
00:00:07,591 --> 00:00:10,052
State Violence, Shame of Taiwan.

2
00:00:59,852 --> 00:01:01,687
PHOTOGRAPHY EXHIBITION

3
00:01:33,052 --> 00:01:34,720
How dare you give her a ring like this?

4
00:01:34,804 --> 00:01:38,641
-As an engagement ring, isn't it…
-It's the thought that counts.

5
00:01:38,724 --> 00:01:40,267
Yeah, I think it's great.

6
00:01:40,351 --> 00:01:42,728
Qiong, what's wrong with you?
Are you drunk?

7
00:01:42,812 --> 00:01:44,313
-No way…
-Keep your voice down.

8
00:01:44,396 --> 00:01:46,315
This is a classy place.

9
00:01:46,398 --> 00:01:48,984
Everyone is happy, so I have to drink.

10
00:01:52,154 --> 00:01:53,948
Actually, last week I…

11
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:55,908
-Okay, thank you.
-Thank you.

12
00:01:55,991 --> 00:01:57,034
-Congratulations.
-Thanks.

13
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,619
All right, quiet down.

14
00:01:58,702 --> 00:01:59,787
Let me ask you.

15
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,789
Is Lilian going to Shanghai next week?

16
00:02:01,872 --> 00:02:02,790
Yeah.

17
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:03,749
-What for?
-Right.

18
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:04,834
You don't know?

19
00:02:04,917 --> 00:02:07,336
She and my boss…

20
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:09,672
Hey! What are you whispering about?

21
00:02:10,589 --> 00:02:14,134
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations to you!

22
00:02:14,218 --> 00:02:17,304
Hey, listen.
Have you seen the ring on her finger?

23
00:02:17,388 --> 00:02:19,640
Stop talking about it.

24
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:21,350
-It's so unique.
-It's beautiful.

25
00:02:23,686 --> 00:02:24,520
Hey.

26
00:02:26,814 --> 00:02:28,649
-Hello, Uncle.
-Long time no see.

27
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,277
Oh, hi! Chairman Li.

28
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:33,946
-I've heard so much about you.
-This is my bro, Li Ming.

29
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:35,030
Nice to meet you.

30
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:36,907
-Chairman Li.
-Yes.

31
00:02:36,991 --> 00:02:39,159
We share the same ancestry and surname.

32
00:02:39,243 --> 00:02:40,578
-Yes.
-Where is your ancestral home?

33
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:41,954
It's Chengde in Hebei.

34
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:43,372
What are the odds?

35
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:45,833
-I'm from Zhangjiakou.
-Really?

36
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,334
Have a seat.

37
00:02:47,418 --> 00:02:48,294
Let's sit down.

38
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:50,004
We're from the same hometown.

39
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:52,006
The boss couldn't make it here today,

40
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:53,757
so he sent Chief Li to meet you.

41
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:55,509
You two have a chat.

42
00:02:55,593 --> 00:02:57,052
-I'll get back to work.
-Okay.

43
00:02:57,136 --> 00:02:59,805
Listen, it's all on me today.

44
00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:03,767
Li Ming, drink as much as you like.
Don't be polite, okay?

45
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:05,311
-Uncle, I'm going.
-Thank you.

46
00:03:05,394 --> 00:03:06,729
-Okay.
-Thank you.

47
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:09,690
Here.

48
00:03:10,316 --> 00:03:12,109
-Let's have a drink.
-Sure, cheers.

49
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:18,782
Comrade Li Ming.

50
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:20,910
You're young and talented.

51
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:23,704
I've met many partners
and executives here.

52
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:25,205
They're all as young as you.

53
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:27,207
Thank you very much.

54
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:29,126
Well, Chairman Li.

55
00:03:30,044 --> 00:03:31,670
As we're from the same hometown,

56
00:03:31,754 --> 00:03:33,464
I will be straight with you.

57
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:34,548
That will be great.

58
00:03:35,174 --> 00:03:37,927
The development project
that you've proposed

59
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,429
is very well received by our boss.

60
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:41,513
Thanks.

61
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,849
But this document…

62
00:03:49,355 --> 00:03:53,984
It must be personally reviewed
and signed by you.

63
00:03:54,068 --> 00:03:56,904
That's why we asked you
to fly here from Taiwan.

64
00:03:57,488 --> 00:03:58,822
We appreciate your effort.

65
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:15,589
STATEMENT

66
00:04:15,673 --> 00:04:21,053
I, Li Xianhong and the Philo Culture Group
adhere to the One China Principle.

67
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:18,819
Congratulations.

68
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:20,696
-Have a look around.
-Okay, don't mind me.

69
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,082
Hi!

70
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:37,880
Hi!

71
00:05:37,963 --> 00:05:39,381
I didn't expect you to come.

72
00:05:40,716 --> 00:05:43,052
Our company
did co-organize the exhibition.

73
00:05:43,135 --> 00:05:45,387
The Chairman isn't in Taiwan,
and he wants me to come.

74
00:05:46,722 --> 00:05:47,973
Is everything all right?

75
00:05:48,474 --> 00:05:49,391
It's great.

76
00:05:51,477 --> 00:05:52,936
Would you like to inspect it?

77
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:04,907
Congratulations.

78
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:43,362
<i>Now I'm relatively sure</i>

79
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:45,197
that you knew about the recording.

80
00:07:01,547 --> 00:07:04,216
Lily, could you take a look at this?

81
00:08:11,325 --> 00:08:15,621
Jay: Is the photography exhibition okay?
Sorry I couldn't be there.

82
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:26,465
It's okay.
The photography exhibition went smoothly.

83
00:08:31,053 --> 00:08:35,140
Jay, I will be working
in Shanghai from next week.

84
00:08:36,892 --> 00:08:40,562
Your address?

85
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,998
You don't need to send me
any more postcards now.

86
00:09:53,969 --> 00:09:56,555
<i>Philo Culture Group's project</i>
<i>in mainland China</i>

87
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:59,850
<i>has indeed caused a sensation</i>
<i>in Shanghai's cultural circles.</i>

88
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:03,020
<i>We would like to know</i>
<i>why Mr. Li has such ambitious goals.</i>

89
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:05,522
<i>The publishing industry</i>
<i>has been declining,</i>

90
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,524
<i>but you're still going for broke.</i>

91
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:09,443
I believe that

92
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:12,404
food for the soul
is indispensable to human beings.

93
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:15,282
Our Chinese culture is broad and profound.

94
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:18,118
Shanghai, in particular, is a place
that embraces cultural diversity

95
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:19,578
and intellectual exchange.

96
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:20,787
In my opinion,

97
00:10:20,871 --> 00:10:23,540
if Philo Culture is setting up
a home base in China,

98
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,959
Shanghai is definitely the first choice.

99
00:10:26,043 --> 00:10:28,545
Okay. Excuse me. Let's pause for a moment.

100
00:10:33,342 --> 00:10:35,719
Chris, I think we could approach this…

101
00:10:36,595 --> 00:10:38,138
from a personal perspective.

102
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:40,432
For example,
your mother's influence on you.

103
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:42,768
This allows the viewers
to see a different facet of you.

104
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,436
All right.

105
00:10:49,024 --> 00:10:51,526
Okay, 3, 2, 1.

106
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,320
Go.

107
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:57,824
I myself love reading books
and watching movies.

108
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:02,079
My mother has had a great influence
on my cultural development.

109
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:05,624
When I was a child,
she made me recite poems every day,

110
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:09,086
read a book every week,
and write a report on what I read.

111
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:10,796
She used to be a painter

112
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:12,923
and a great calligrapher too.

113
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:16,259
Therefore, if I actually have
any achievements today,

114
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:17,511
I must thank her.

115
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:21,431
<i>Recently, Chairman Li Xianhong</i>
<i>of the Philo Cultural Group,</i>

116
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:24,684
made a statement in China
acknowledging the One China Principle.

117
00:11:24,768 --> 00:11:27,521
<i>The group's General Manager,</i>
<i>Shen Xiaowen, stated that</i>

118
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:31,191
<i>Li Xianhong's recognition of One China</i>
<i>is purely his personal action.</i>

119
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:34,194
<i>Her attempt</i>
<i>to cut ties with Mr. Li completely</i>

120
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:36,238
<i>is a desperate way to dodge criticism.</i>

121
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:37,364
<i>Let's not forget</i>

122
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:40,158
<i>Philo Cultural Group</i>
<i>has been plagued by controversies.</i>

123
00:11:40,242 --> 00:11:41,868
<i>Can it overcome the crisis this time,</i>

124
00:11:41,952 --> 00:11:43,954
<i>and regain the trust</i>
<i>of the Taiwanese people?</i>

125
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:47,874
<i>I'm afraid Li Xianhong must come forward</i>
<i>and give us an explanation.</i>

126
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:49,334
Rong.

127
00:11:50,085 --> 00:11:51,086
Contact the press.

128
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,381
Try your best to smear
Xianhong's personal image.

129
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:56,174
Give them the evidence they need.

130
00:11:56,675 --> 00:11:58,093
I'll cut the ties with him again.

131
00:11:58,677 --> 00:12:00,053
We'll see where public opinion goes.

132
00:12:01,847 --> 00:12:03,432
Xiaowen, is this necessary?

133
00:12:03,974 --> 00:12:06,977
Shouldn't we contact the Chairman
and get his response first?

134
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,603
He didn't tell me anything.

135
00:12:08,687 --> 00:12:11,481
I didn't know that he made that statement
until I saw the news.

136
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:14,234
Did he mention anything to you?

137
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:16,445
Xiaowen.

138
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:18,697
-Do you know…
-Can you stop asking me?

139
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,198
Aren't you his assistant?

140
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:30,792
Have you read those posts?

141
00:12:32,002 --> 00:12:33,378
They're all very vicious.

142
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:36,423
These young people are really outrageous.

143
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:38,925
He was so supportive
of the student movement.

144
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,510
And now?

145
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:43,221
They've all turned on him and judged him.

146
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:54,649
If necessary,

147
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:57,986
once everything has settled down
in the company,

148
00:12:58,862 --> 00:13:00,655
I'll step down as general manager.

149
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:06,369
Why?

150
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:08,955
And then what?

151
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:16,004
Then I'll go to Shanghai to see him.

152
00:13:22,844 --> 00:13:23,845
Xiaowen.

153
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:27,516
Surely you know that

154
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:30,769
Lilian Lin is now
the creative director in Shanghai, right?

155
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:33,438
So I can't go see him?

156
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:36,233
What do you expect to get?

157
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:41,238
Isn't it obvious enough
that he won't come back to Taiwan?

158
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,742
To him, those of us left in Taiwan,

159
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:49,287
are no longer needed.

160
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:39,689
Xixi: Welcome to the motherland.
Dinner on me tonight.

161
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:40,940
Sure!

162
00:15:41,024 --> 00:15:44,611
Of course it's your treat. You've made
a lot of money in the motherland.

163
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:46,613
See you later.

164
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:02,212
CALL FROM XIAOWEN

165
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:13,556
Hello.

166
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:16,434
I didn't know
you could be so irresponsible.

167
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:20,814
Xiaowen.

168
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:22,857
Have you read my letter?

169
00:16:22,941 --> 00:16:24,025
Why should I bother?

170
00:16:24,526 --> 00:16:26,736
The company was having its toughest time
and you just left.

171
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:30,281
I know your true color now.

172
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:37,205
Chen Hanrong.

173
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:39,916
You owe him this.

174
00:16:41,376 --> 00:16:42,502
Without him,

175
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:44,921
you would have been nothing.

176
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:09,779
<i>Xiaowen.</i>

177
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,240
<i>Without me,</i>

178
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:15,285
<i>what would have Li Xianhong become?</i>

179
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:30,508
<i>Do you need me to go there?</i>

180
00:17:32,177 --> 00:17:33,928
No, it's really not necessary.

181
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:36,347
I need you in charge
of the home front in Taiwan.

182
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:39,893
When will you be back?

183
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:41,895
Mom's condition isn't so good.

184
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:43,980
The hospital said that…

185
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,648
we might need to be prepared.

186
00:17:49,611 --> 00:17:52,280
It could be a bit sensitive
if I go back right now.

187
00:17:53,948 --> 00:17:55,450
Right, about Mom…

188
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:57,368
Can she recognize you?

189
00:17:58,119 --> 00:17:59,454
Sometimes she can.

190
00:18:00,038 --> 00:18:01,623
She has an erratic temper.

191
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:04,250
But she often mentions your name.

192
00:18:06,878 --> 00:18:07,879
Xianhong.

193
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:11,341
Can I go see you sometime next month?

194
00:18:14,052 --> 00:18:15,220
You don't have to.

195
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:18,056
Mom and the company need you more.

196
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:19,891
How about you?

197
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:21,476
No one is taking care of you.

198
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:23,561
I won't be there for too long.

199
00:18:27,398 --> 00:18:28,483
I promise.

200
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:30,819
I'll be back soon, okay?

201
00:18:35,073 --> 00:18:36,407
I'll be right there.

202
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:41,329
Was that Lilian Lin?

203
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:43,540
I have a meeting.

204
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:45,416
Take good care of yourself, okay?

205
00:18:46,209 --> 00:18:47,168
Bye.

206
00:19:01,516 --> 00:19:04,686
Chen Hanrong, how long has it been
since we last met?

207
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:06,729
As long as the time you've been here.

208
00:19:09,274 --> 00:19:13,319
That means at least a decade.

209
00:19:13,403 --> 00:19:16,114
Time flies by so quickly.

210
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:18,992
Thank you.

211
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:22,161
You must have achieved
your high school dreams now.

212
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:25,123
High school dreams? What dreams?

213
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,208
Don't you remember?

214
00:19:27,292 --> 00:19:30,670
In high school, you said that
you wanted to travel around the world,

215
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:34,424
going back and forth
between Europe, America, and Taiwan,

216
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:37,218
staying in all the grand hotels
around the world,

217
00:19:37,302 --> 00:19:40,179
and having your own home in every city.

218
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:43,349
Why would you remember this so clearly?

219
00:19:43,975 --> 00:19:46,394
Do you also remember at that time you said

220
00:19:46,477 --> 00:19:50,106
when both of us are 50 years old
and neither of us is married,

221
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,649
we could live together?

222
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:52,859
What nonsense is that?

223
00:19:53,484 --> 00:19:55,320
-Did I?
-Yep, you did.

224
00:19:55,403 --> 00:19:58,072
-That's bullshit!
-What? Don't you remember?

225
00:19:58,156 --> 00:19:59,782
I was super serious about this.

226
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:01,534
That was super stupid.

227
00:20:01,618 --> 00:20:03,411
-Did I really say that?
-Sure.

228
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,788
Here, a toast to youth.

229
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:07,874
To stupidity.

230
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:17,300
I've heard that your boss Li Xianming
is doing well in Shanghai.

231
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:19,177
It's Li Xianhong.

232
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,888
And he's my former…

233
00:20:23,431 --> 00:20:24,515
former boss.

234
00:20:25,642 --> 00:20:28,269
Former boss? That's really strange.

235
00:20:28,353 --> 00:20:32,398
Since you've already left Philo,
why do you come to Shanghai?

236
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:37,403
I'm just curious.

237
00:20:38,488 --> 00:20:40,949
I'm curious
why everyone wants to come here.

238
00:20:41,032 --> 00:20:42,200
I can answer that.

239
00:20:42,283 --> 00:20:44,452
But before that, a toast to you.

240
00:20:44,953 --> 00:20:47,580
Let's celebrate
your return to the motherland.

241
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:55,046
But to be honest,

242
00:20:55,129 --> 00:20:57,924
It's really a bit late to come here now.

243
00:20:58,633 --> 00:21:00,885
Taiwan is really not competitive now.

244
00:21:00,969 --> 00:21:04,263
I've been in Shanghai for over a decade.

245
00:21:04,347 --> 00:21:07,934
I've found that
Shanghai is truly a world-class city.

246
00:21:11,521 --> 00:21:14,357
So you see this world-class city
as your home now.

247
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,316
Of course.

248
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,110
I'm Shanghainese.

249
00:21:18,111 --> 00:21:19,696
Shanghainese.

250
00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:27,036
Miss Xixi, It's been a long time.

251
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,663
I miss you a lot.

252
00:21:28,746 --> 00:21:30,873
I want to come here more often too.

253
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:32,917
Is your friend from Taiwan?

254
00:21:33,668 --> 00:21:34,794
Yeah!

255
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:37,922
Please treat
our distinguished guest from Taiwan well.

256
00:21:38,006 --> 00:21:39,382
-Okay.
-Of course.

257
00:21:40,508 --> 00:21:41,759
What is your name, sir?

258
00:21:42,343 --> 00:21:43,469
My surname is Chen.

259
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:45,555
Mr. Chen, please turn over.

260
00:21:46,723 --> 00:21:48,224
What have you been busy with, Miss Xixi?

261
00:21:48,725 --> 00:21:50,560
Flying here and there.

262
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,729
Sir, have you been sleeping poorly?

263
00:21:53,688 --> 00:21:54,731
I'm a light sleeper.

264
00:21:55,523 --> 00:21:57,316
If you'd like it stronger, let me know.

265
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,527
People from Taiwan like stronger massage.

266
00:22:00,028 --> 00:22:02,989
Master Gong, be gentle with my friend.

267
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:03,990
Sure.

268
00:22:05,074 --> 00:22:08,077
Miss Xixi, is Mr. Chen your boyfriend?

269
00:22:09,871 --> 00:22:12,165
He's my gay bestie!

270
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:14,500
Xixi.

271
00:22:16,794 --> 00:22:18,880
Taiwan is more open.

272
00:22:21,382 --> 00:22:23,092
A bit lower.

273
00:22:23,176 --> 00:22:24,052
That's the spot.

274
00:22:25,178 --> 00:22:26,387
Good.

275
00:22:26,471 --> 00:22:28,264
Drink some tea and relax later.

276
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:29,182
Okay.

277
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:30,308
Breathe in.

278
00:22:46,491 --> 00:22:47,617
Xixi.

279
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:50,369
Don't pay for this one. I'll pay.

280
00:22:50,453 --> 00:22:51,621
You've paid quite a lot.

281
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:53,247
It's not a big deal.

282
00:22:53,331 --> 00:22:54,791
You will only be here for two weeks.

283
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:57,251
A massage and a dinner are nothing

284
00:22:57,335 --> 00:22:59,378
I'm worried that I may bother you.

285
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:04,675
Where will you be flying to?

286
00:23:05,176 --> 00:23:08,096
I'll fly to Dubai first,
and then to London.

287
00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:11,182
I'll be back to Shanghai for one day.
Last flight is to Singapore.

288
00:23:11,265 --> 00:23:12,850
That's crazy, isn't it?

289
00:23:13,601 --> 00:23:15,728
You know, I spend half the year
away from Shanghai.

290
00:23:17,522 --> 00:23:19,315
You're really busy.

291
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:22,985
But I'm really grateful
that you got me those connections.

292
00:23:23,069 --> 00:23:24,654
That's nothing. It's a small world.

293
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:25,988
Everyone knows who's who.

294
00:23:26,656 --> 00:23:28,241
My taxi has arrived.

295
00:23:28,324 --> 00:23:29,450
That is quick.

296
00:23:29,534 --> 00:23:30,743
-I'll walk you out.
-No need.

297
00:23:30,827 --> 00:23:32,411
Take your time. It's okay.

298
00:23:32,495 --> 00:23:34,080
-Where are you going?
-I'll wander around.

299
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:38,084
Okay, if I'm going back to Taiwan
for the New Year, I'll let you know.

300
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:39,168
-Okay?
-Okay.

301
00:23:40,378 --> 00:23:41,629
Let's keep in touch.

302
00:23:41,712 --> 00:23:43,381
-Take care of yourself.
-I will.

303
00:23:44,257 --> 00:23:45,133
-Bye.
-Bye.

304
00:23:45,216 --> 00:23:46,759
-Love you.
-All right.

305
00:23:47,635 --> 00:23:48,636
Mr. Chen.

306
00:23:51,597 --> 00:23:53,850
Thank you, Master Gong.

307
00:23:54,684 --> 00:23:55,935
Call me Xiao Wu.

308
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:58,437
Master Xiao Wu.

309
00:23:59,272 --> 00:24:00,148
Just Xiao Wu.

310
00:24:04,152 --> 00:24:05,027
Xiao Wu.

311
00:24:09,866 --> 00:24:12,827
Do you have any plan for tonight?

312
00:24:39,312 --> 00:24:40,897
Good morning. Who will you be meeting?

313
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,899
I'd like to meet Chairman Li Xianhong.

314
00:24:43,691 --> 00:24:45,359
Do you have an appointment?

315
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:48,196
I am the general manager from Taiwan.

316
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:50,656
May I ask what your name is?

317
00:24:52,325 --> 00:24:53,159
Shen Xiaowen.

318
00:24:53,242 --> 00:24:54,076
Shen Xiaowen.

319
00:24:55,703 --> 00:24:57,163
Call your chairman and tell him

320
00:24:57,246 --> 00:24:59,749
that General Manager Shen Xiaowen
from Taiwan is here to meet him.

321
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:01,125
-Okay.
-Now.

322
00:25:02,752 --> 00:25:03,586
All right.

323
00:25:05,379 --> 00:25:06,881
Hello, this is the front desk.

324
00:25:07,423 --> 00:25:10,509
General Manager Shen Xiaowen
from Taiwan is here.

325
00:25:10,593 --> 00:25:12,220
She wants to meet the chairman.

326
00:25:14,055 --> 00:25:15,973
Okay.

327
00:25:17,934 --> 00:25:20,978
Ms. Shen, I'm sorry, but we're unable
to get you a last-minute appointment.

328
00:25:21,062 --> 00:25:22,146
Our chairman is very busy.

329
00:25:23,898 --> 00:25:24,941
Ms. Shen?

330
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:28,361
Ms. Shen, you can't just go in like this.

331
00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:30,529
I'll ask someone to escort you in a bit.

332
00:25:30,613 --> 00:25:31,489
Ms. Shen.

333
00:25:31,572 --> 00:25:32,657
Xiaowen.

334
00:25:49,674 --> 00:25:51,175
-Thank you, Mr. Li.
-We'll keep in touch.

335
00:25:51,259 --> 00:25:52,218
Sure.

336
00:25:55,179 --> 00:25:56,347
Excuse me, Miss…

337
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:58,474
Emma, it's fine.

338
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:14,490
Why did you come here without telling me?

339
00:26:15,449 --> 00:26:16,701
Have you booked a hotel room yet?

340
00:26:17,201 --> 00:26:18,536
Do you need me to book one for you?

341
00:26:19,328 --> 00:26:22,164
Why don't you go get some rest?
I'll meet you after work.

342
00:26:22,915 --> 00:26:24,583
So it's really Lilian Lin.

343
00:26:28,879 --> 00:26:30,298
I should have known.

344
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:39,432
Lilian is just the creative director
in Shanghai.

345
00:26:40,683 --> 00:26:41,892
Don't imagine things.

346
00:26:44,061 --> 00:26:45,146
I'm not imagining anything.

347
00:26:47,523 --> 00:26:48,649
You told me to wait.

348
00:26:49,483 --> 00:26:50,568
I believed you.

349
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:53,154
And I waited.

350
00:26:54,572 --> 00:26:56,407
You said you would bring me here.

351
00:26:57,658 --> 00:26:58,868
I believed you.

352
00:27:00,369 --> 00:27:01,495
I kept on waiting.

353
00:27:03,372 --> 00:27:04,832
But you never came back.

354
00:27:09,003 --> 00:27:10,504
You don't want me here to be with you.

355
00:27:21,557 --> 00:27:22,475
Xiaowen.

356
00:27:24,393 --> 00:27:26,437
I really need you
to take care of Mom in Taiwan.

357
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,897
Don't use Mom as an excuse.

358
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:45,122
Li Xianhong.

359
00:27:47,041 --> 00:27:48,709
I've been with you for 25 years.

360
00:27:50,461 --> 00:27:52,421
Don't I at least deserve
the truth from you?

361
00:27:58,094 --> 00:28:00,513
Can't you even tell me
the truth in person?

362
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,293
If I go back now,

363
00:28:33,087 --> 00:28:35,506
it will only cause more trouble
for the company.

364
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:38,843
Surely you know that…

365
00:28:39,885 --> 00:28:43,889
if we don't have the Chinese market
and the projects in China,

366
00:28:43,973 --> 00:28:45,641
the company in Taiwan will fail.

367
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:52,440
I'm also working hard for our company.

368
00:28:55,276 --> 00:28:56,777
You're definitely not thinking about us.

369
00:29:02,867 --> 00:29:04,034
To my own astonishment,

370
00:29:05,786 --> 00:29:08,164
I, Shen Xiaowen,
have had to spend so many years

371
00:29:09,874 --> 00:29:11,542
before I finally understand this.

372
00:29:26,348 --> 00:29:27,224
Xiaowen.

373
00:29:29,393 --> 00:29:30,769
I think you're just tired.

374
00:29:31,854 --> 00:29:33,272
Why don't you take a vacation?

375
00:29:33,355 --> 00:29:35,232
I'll deal with the stuff in Taiwan, okay?

376
00:29:40,404 --> 00:29:41,572
I am indeed very tired.

377
00:29:43,324 --> 00:29:46,202
I am tired of all the promises
that you've never kept.

378
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:28,244
I don't love you anymore.

379
00:30:51,642 --> 00:30:52,893
It surely happened.

380
00:30:52,977 --> 00:30:54,228
What exactly happened?

381
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:55,729
Many people gathered there.

382
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:58,440
That was exciting.

383
00:30:58,524 --> 00:30:59,608
So you saw it?

384
00:30:59,692 --> 00:31:00,901
Of course I did.

385
00:31:00,985 --> 00:31:03,821
She's truly shameless.
How dare she come to Shanghai?

386
00:31:03,904 --> 00:31:05,614
Let me tell you the inside story.

387
00:31:05,698 --> 00:31:10,119
I've heard that
she's the chairman's mistress in Taiwan.

388
00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:12,162
-Do you believe that?
-It's impossible.

389
00:31:12,246 --> 00:31:13,581
You're talking nonsense.

390
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:15,833
Who would want such an old woman
to be his mistress?

391
00:31:15,916 --> 00:31:17,751
Yeah, when I saw her, I just thought

392
00:31:17,835 --> 00:31:19,837
I should really take care of my skin.

393
00:31:20,838 --> 00:31:21,755
Besides,

394
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:24,049
Lilian is so beautiful and capable.

395
00:31:24,133 --> 00:31:24,967
Yeah.

396
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,885
-So humiliating.
-She made a fool of herself.

397
00:31:26,969 --> 00:31:28,637
She doesn't look like the mistress,

398
00:31:28,721 --> 00:31:33,475
but more like an old maid
coming all the way from Taiwan.

399
00:31:41,108 --> 00:31:43,277
Do you…do you need to use the toilet?

400
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,612
I need to wash my hands.

401
00:32:07,635 --> 00:32:08,886
I want to talk to you.

402
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:14,850
Take them to the lounge.

403
00:32:26,403 --> 00:32:28,113
Xiaowen, would you like to have a seat?

404
00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:33,952
-I'll ask them…
-Don't bother.

405
00:32:51,637 --> 00:32:54,473
Sorry, I was out of control just now.

406
00:32:57,101 --> 00:32:58,352
It's okay. I understand.

407
00:33:01,271 --> 00:33:03,065
I went
to your photography exhibition in Taipei.

408
00:33:03,607 --> 00:33:04,733
You're very talented.

409
00:33:06,485 --> 00:33:07,444
Thank you.

410
00:33:15,828 --> 00:33:18,497
It looks like you've managed
the company pretty well.

411
00:33:32,094 --> 00:33:33,262
Do you love him?

412
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:51,780
Everything you're doing now,

413
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:53,907
is it what you want to do?

414
00:34:00,247 --> 00:34:02,166
I don't know
why you're asking me this question.

415
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:08,881
Promise me one thing, okay?

416
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:15,846
No matter how you end up with him
in the future,

417
00:34:17,431 --> 00:34:18,432
you…

418
00:34:19,475 --> 00:34:21,185
must never lose who you truly are.

419
00:34:27,858 --> 00:34:28,901
Xiaowen.

420
00:37:51,061 --> 00:37:53,522
<i>I've always known that I'm different.</i>

421
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:56,775
<i>Under the same sky,</i>

422
00:37:57,526 --> 00:37:59,695
<i>we're each on our own piece of land,</i>

423
00:38:00,779 --> 00:38:02,864
<i>living lives with different values.</i>

424
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:05,742
<i>And then we're hit by desires.</i>

425
00:38:06,785 --> 00:38:07,869
<i>We get jealous.</i>

426
00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:10,497
<i>We have physical contact.</i>

427
00:38:11,498 --> 00:38:12,666
<i>We kiss.</i>

428
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:14,626
<i>We hug.</i>

429
00:38:15,961 --> 00:38:18,505
<i>After that, we realize we're all the same.</i>

430
00:38:22,259 --> 00:38:24,302
<i>"We're all born equal" is a lie.</i>

431
00:38:25,971 --> 00:38:27,597
<i>Only in the face of death</i>

432
00:38:28,932 --> 00:38:30,851
<i>can we truly reach…</i>

433
00:38:31,685 --> 00:38:33,311
<i>the promised land of our own.</i>
