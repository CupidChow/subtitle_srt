LI XIANHONG'S FOUR WOMEN

00:00:24,942 --> 00:00:30,197
CALL FROM UNCLE LEE
SLIDE TO ANSWER

4
00:00:51,093 --> 00:00:54,472
<i>Your call will be forwarded to voicemail,</i>
<i>after the tone…</i>

5
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:04,356
-Here she is!
-Miss Lilian Lin, can you tell us

6
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,233
about your affair with Li Xianhong?

7
00:01:06,317 --> 00:01:08,736
Is this age-gap relationship
some kind of quid pro quo?

8
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:12,364
Now that your affair is in the open,
do you think you're the victim?

9
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:16,118
Are you angry to find out
that you're not even his first mistress?

10
00:01:18,162 --> 00:01:19,371
I'm not a victim.

11
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:21,707
I'm fully responsible for my own actions.

12
00:01:21,791 --> 00:01:22,958
You've ruined a family,

13
00:01:23,042 --> 00:01:25,461
-how will you be responsible?
-I've posted on Facebook, thank you.

14
00:01:25,544 --> 00:01:27,129
Do you have anything to say to the public?

15
00:01:27,213 --> 00:01:28,047
Tell us more.

LI XIANHONG AND HIS WOMEN
OLD FLAMES AND NEW LOVE

17
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:34,428
Have you read this magazine?

18
00:01:45,523 --> 00:01:46,816
Please tell me…

19
00:01:47,483 --> 00:01:49,401
that you have nothing to do with this.

20
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:00,830
What have you done?

21
00:02:07,211 --> 00:02:08,963
Why would you do this?

22
00:02:10,548 --> 00:02:13,092
Aren't Li Xianhong and the Philo Group
already miserable enough?

23
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:14,176
What about me?

24
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:17,179
Has anyone asked me how I feel?

25
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,660
<i>Your coffee is ready.</i>

26
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,416
And your chocolate cake and cheesecake.

27
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:46,333
Thank you.

28
00:02:57,678 --> 00:02:59,763
I thought you had gone to Hualien.

29
00:03:00,472 --> 00:03:02,558
We're going to Jay's house
to celebrate the New Year.

30
00:03:03,434 --> 00:03:05,477
Jay? Jay Zou?

31
00:03:06,395 --> 00:03:08,480
I have no idea that you've been in touch.

32
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,445
Did you quit smoking?

33
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:16,488
My New Year's resolution.

34
00:03:16,572 --> 00:03:18,365
There's still a week until the New Year.

35
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,077
See you.

36
00:03:22,161 --> 00:03:24,079
Merry Christmas.

37
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:39,136
Do you need some advice?

38
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,515
It depends on what advice it is.

39
00:03:44,767 --> 00:03:46,435
Your father abandoned us both,

40
00:03:46,936 --> 00:03:50,189
but I guess I'm still qualified
to give you relationship advice.

41
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:52,691
I don't want to talk about him.

42
00:03:53,442 --> 00:03:54,526
Which one?

43
00:03:55,027 --> 00:03:56,153
Li Xianhong?

44
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:57,529
Or Jay Zou?

45
00:04:13,337 --> 00:04:14,922
So, what's your advice?

46
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:17,341
I think there has always been…

47
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:19,718
only one choice, right?

48
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,704
-Jay.
-Hello, guys.

49
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:31,999
-Amazing!
-Seriously?

50
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:34,710
-Hey, Jay!
-You look so tanned.

51
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:36,670
-Long time no see.
-Long time no see.

52
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:40,090
-Jay!
-Jay, how did you turn into this?

53
00:05:40,174 --> 00:05:41,467
-Too dark?
-You're finally back.

54
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,177
You didn't use sunscreen?

55
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,219
Let's go to the backyard.

56
00:05:44,303 --> 00:05:46,597
-Everything's ready, yeah.
-It's been so long.

57
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,890
-Barbecue, right?
-Yep.

58
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:49,767
-Hurry up, I'm starving.
-Jay, nice.

59
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,977
-It's all ready.
-Nothing has changed here.

60
00:05:52,061 --> 00:05:54,271
-Exactly like my memories.
-Long time no see.

61
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:56,106
Wow, it smells nice.

62
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:04,448
-Hey, Jay!
-Yes?

63
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:07,367
You're celebrating the New Year with us.
This is amazing.

64
00:06:07,451 --> 00:06:10,454
I've run out of excuses
to lure you to come to Taipei.

65
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:12,956
That's right, Jay.

66
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,667
You've been traveling and enjoying life.

67
00:06:15,751 --> 00:06:16,835
It sounds fantastic.

68
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,713
Jay, you should publish a book,

69
00:06:19,797 --> 00:06:20,923
like a photo book.

70
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:22,091
If Jay actually does,

71
00:06:22,174 --> 00:06:23,884
-we must all buy the book.
-Okay.

72
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:26,095
I'll personally buy 10 to support you.

73
00:06:26,178 --> 00:06:27,387
-Wow!
-I'll buy 20.

74
00:06:27,471 --> 00:06:30,808
-Jay, I really envy the way you live.
-You're admirable.

75
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:32,142
There's nothing to envy.

76
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:34,812
After going around the world a few times,

77
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:37,022
I've found people are all the same.

78
00:06:37,106 --> 00:06:38,482
No way!

79
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:41,151
You must have seen
a much bigger world than we have.

80
00:06:41,944 --> 00:06:44,822
I've experienced many things
that you wouldn't want to be involved.

81
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,533
Taiwan is relatively more stable.

82
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:49,201
Taiwan is about to be sold out.

83
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:50,369
How is it stable?

84
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:52,621
Don't do this all the time.

85
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:54,915
-You really like to stir up troubles.
-No…

86
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:57,084
-Right?
-But to be honest,

87
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:59,670
the cross-Strait tension
has been rising in the second half.

88
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:02,506
I'm worried that the CSSTA will be
forcibly passed through majority rule.

89
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:05,634
We'll play it like a KMT-DPP showdown
and generational conflict.

90
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:07,219
More young people will vote for us.

91
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:09,388
Excuse me, I'm a devoted KMT supporter.

92
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:11,890
Please don't imply
all young people share your ideology.

93
00:07:11,974 --> 00:07:14,226
Well, most young people do think that

94
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:16,353
the problem lies
in the distribution of resource.

95
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:17,855
The CSSTA is the same.

96
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:20,774
Young people's opportunities
are sacrificed for the interests of a few.

97
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:21,775
Exactly.

98
00:07:21,859 --> 00:07:24,945
See, my video with Li Xianhong
has got huge responses on the Internet.

99
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:26,905
What?

100
00:07:26,989 --> 00:07:29,449
-Such huge responses.
-Why do you have to bring this up?

101
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:31,493
-He didn't…
-Why do you…

102
00:07:35,414 --> 00:07:37,416
Why do you have to bring this up?

103
00:07:38,834 --> 00:07:40,043
Okay, I…

104
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:41,879
-Stop talking.
-I'll apologize.

105
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,406
Lilian…

106
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:10,949
I'm sorry.

107
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:12,659
Sorry for what?

108
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:16,246
-I didn't mean to.
-I don't want to talk about it.

109
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:20,667
If I'd known posting the video
would attract so much attention

110
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:22,794
and cause such repercussions,

111
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:24,796
I wouldn't have posted it.

112
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,090
We're friends.
I wouldn't mess with a friend.

113
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:30,010
-I didn't know about your relationship.
-Okay, it's fine.

114
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:33,972
Are we good?

115
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:38,435
We're good, right?

116
00:08:40,062 --> 00:08:42,147
Hey, what do you want to eat?
I'll grill it for you.

117
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:45,108
I'll just grill something.

118
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:47,069
Give me a minute.

119
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,869
The agreed-upon terms are as follows.

120
00:08:55,953 --> 00:08:59,164
First, the rights and obligations
of the underage children

121
00:08:59,248 --> 00:09:01,333
shall be jointly assumed by both parties.

122
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:05,837
Second, the monthly child support payment
shall be NT$200,000.

123
00:09:05,921 --> 00:09:08,465
of which the male party
shall bear two-thirds,

124
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:11,009
and the female party shall bear one-third.

125
00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:12,552
If either party fails to pay,

126
00:09:12,636 --> 00:09:14,846
the other party may seek legal recourse

127
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:17,349
to enforce the unpaid amount
for the obligation.

128
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:28,026
MUTUAL DIVORCE AGREEMENT

129
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:31,655
SIGNED: LI XIANHONG

130
00:09:52,843 --> 00:09:55,554
So after leaving New York,
you went to Anchorage.

131
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:57,639
Then Japan and finally back to Taiwan.

132
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:02,769
I thought you would never come back.

133
00:10:04,438 --> 00:10:05,439
I just…

134
00:10:06,982 --> 00:10:09,359
suddenly missed
the color of the sea in Hualien.

135
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:17,993
Those news stories are very boring.

136
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:22,706
Even you saw them.

137
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,295
Are you okay?

138
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:38,305
Don't give them any attention.

139
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:41,516
None of them understands you.

140
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:46,104
Sometimes, I myself don't know who I am.

141
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:51,151
But I know you.

142
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:01,620
Li Xianhong…

143
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:04,664
Does he treat you well?

144
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:29,356
-It works.
-Hurry.

145
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:30,524
Be careful.

146
00:11:31,233 --> 00:11:32,442
Here.

147
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:36,655
They're all lit up.

148
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:37,948
So beautiful.

149
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:46,331
Be careful. Jay, you're so brave!

150
00:11:46,415 --> 00:11:48,750
-Jay.
-Jay, you're so brave!

151
00:12:06,852 --> 00:12:08,061
They're burning so fast.

152
00:12:08,145 --> 00:12:10,272
Thank you for inviting us, Jay.

153
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:11,690
Aren't they beautiful?

154
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:13,567
All the different colors.

155
00:12:32,461 --> 00:12:34,754
Happy New Year!

156
00:14:18,984 --> 00:14:20,026
Mom?

157
00:14:21,111 --> 00:14:22,070
Mom?

158
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:23,780
Mom?

159
00:14:24,281 --> 00:14:25,782
Did you have a nightmare?

160
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:32,289
Who are you?

161
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:36,167
I'm your son, Xianhong.

162
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:41,590
Xianhong?

163
00:14:42,841 --> 00:14:43,717
Right.

164
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:45,885
Xianhong.

165
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:46,970
Mom.

166
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:48,805
What nightmare was it?

167
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:52,267
What nightmare?

168
00:14:54,436 --> 00:14:55,520
Never mind.

169
00:14:56,605 --> 00:14:57,439
It's nothing.

170
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:00,275
Xianhong.

171
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:03,528
You're no longer young.

172
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:06,531
Why haven't you got married yet?

173
00:15:10,285 --> 00:15:11,244
Mom.

174
00:15:12,287 --> 00:15:14,372
I've been married for over a decade.

175
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,668
Why didn't you invite me?

176
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:21,004
I did.

177
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:23,131
You were at my wedding.

178
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:25,258
Huh?

179
00:15:29,054 --> 00:15:30,263
I'm sorry.

180
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:32,474
-I must have forgot.
-It's okay.

181
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,144
Congratulations.

182
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,898
Someone was willing to marry you.

183
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:46,154
I must have done great things
in my past life.

184
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:47,072
Well…

185
00:15:48,073 --> 00:15:49,658
I've got you to be my mother,

186
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:52,243
and someone was willing to be my wife.

187
00:15:57,707 --> 00:16:00,001
You have to treat Xiaowen well.

188
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,297
Of course.

189
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,885
She's my only daughter-in-law.

190
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:12,222
If she leaves you,

191
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:15,642
who will take care of you for me?

192
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:24,693
Mom.

193
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:27,195
I can take care of myself.

194
00:16:31,533 --> 00:16:33,159
I am an adult.

195
00:16:33,243 --> 00:16:34,285
Well…

196
00:16:34,953 --> 00:16:36,204
Even an adult

197
00:16:37,122 --> 00:16:39,124
needs someone to take care of them.

198
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:55,849
Excuse me.

199
00:16:57,892 --> 00:16:59,894
Have you seen my son, Xianhong?

200
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,267
You don't have to clean it up.
I'll do it myself.

201
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:36,825
How long will you keep ignoring me?

202
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,536
You'll keep up the silent treatment?

203
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,708
Your definition of silent treatment
is rather broad.

204
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:57,720
You don't have to force yourself.

205
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:01,182
It seems that you don't want to stay here.

206
00:19:03,685 --> 00:19:06,062
I have no idea what I want.

207
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,608
I don't seem to know you anymore.

208
00:19:14,404 --> 00:19:18,408
If the only thing I have done for myself
makes you feel like this,

209
00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:22,036
maybe you really don't know me.

210
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,586
-Sorry, that's not what I meant.
-It's exactly what you meant.

211
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:44,309
I don't know…

212
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:49,063
I don't know if I can continue like this.

213
00:20:09,334 --> 00:20:10,752
Do you want to end it?

214
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:14,213
Do you care?

215
00:20:41,324 --> 00:20:42,241
Patrick.

216
00:20:46,037 --> 00:20:47,246
I'm really…

217
00:20:49,374 --> 00:20:52,001
-grateful to you for the past few years…
-Please don't.

218
00:20:56,339 --> 00:20:58,049
You can say anything.

219
00:21:00,468 --> 00:21:02,053
Just don't say you're grateful to me.

220
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,142
This is the only thing I can give you.

221
00:21:57,191 --> 00:21:58,151
Don't leave.

222
00:21:59,152 --> 00:22:00,445
Don't leave.

223
00:22:07,118 --> 00:22:08,161
I'm sorry.

224
00:27:33,903 --> 00:27:34,737
<i>Love…</i>

225
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:37,073
<i>is so foolish.</i>

226
00:27:38,908 --> 00:27:40,701
<i>No matter who the other person is,</i>

227
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:43,579
<i>love always behaves like a fool</i>

228
00:27:44,747 --> 00:27:46,040
<i>and would not hesitate</i>

229
00:27:46,624 --> 00:27:47,917
<i>to give itself away</i>

230
00:27:49,794 --> 00:27:52,421
<i>even to someone who is not worthy of love,</i>

231
00:27:53,714 --> 00:27:56,509
<i>even to someone who would accept love</i>

232
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:58,427
<i>without the slightest gratitude.</i>

233
00:28:00,262 --> 00:28:01,138
<i>Love…</i>

234
00:28:02,139 --> 00:28:03,474
<i>is like the rain.</i>

235
00:28:04,975 --> 00:28:06,727
<i>It falls on good people,</i>

236
00:28:07,812 --> 00:28:09,980
<i>and also on the wicked people.</i>

237
00:28:11,816 --> 00:28:13,317
<i>It does not distinguish.</i>

238
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:00,531
<i>I want to tell everybody this.</i>

239
00:29:01,198 --> 00:29:02,491
Perhaps in the future,

240
00:29:03,367 --> 00:29:05,536
you will experience what loss truly means.

241
00:29:06,495 --> 00:29:07,746
Then you will understand

242
00:29:08,873 --> 00:29:10,749
what is most important to you.

243
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:56,063
<i>A large number of students</i>
<i>are outside the Legislative Yuan,</i>

244
00:30:56,146 --> 00:30:57,856
<i>protesting against the CSSTA and demanding</i>

245
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:00,234
<i>that the government</i>
<i>should take this issue seriously.</i>

246
00:31:00,317 --> 00:31:03,237
Let's take a look
at the current situation.

247
00:31:06,198 --> 00:31:09,118
Many young people are protesting
at the front line of the Legislative Yuan.

248
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:10,452
This may be my opportunity.

249
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:13,831
You've finally cut ties with the company
and cleaned up your image.

250
00:31:14,832 --> 00:31:16,625
Why do you want to get involved?

251
00:31:16,709 --> 00:31:18,460
Aren't you afraid of cyberbullying?

252
00:31:20,087 --> 00:31:22,673
Lilian says that the nature
of the internet is inherently void.

253
00:31:22,756 --> 00:31:24,758
Everyone is lurking below the surface.

254
00:31:24,842 --> 00:31:26,635
When the timing is right, they rise

255
00:31:26,719 --> 00:31:27,845
to ride the momentum.

256
00:31:27,928 --> 00:31:28,887
Oh, my!

257
00:31:28,971 --> 00:31:30,973
You disliked Facebook just one year ago.

258
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:34,268
Now the one who could change your mind
has suddenly appeared?

259
00:31:35,144 --> 00:31:37,855
During this period,
she has been by my side.

260
00:31:37,938 --> 00:31:39,565
She has taught me a lot.

261
00:31:40,357 --> 00:31:41,775
I truly love her.

262
00:31:41,859 --> 00:31:42,818
Ew!

263
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:44,320
You're serious right now.

264
00:31:44,403 --> 00:31:45,988
I'm always serious.

265
00:31:51,619 --> 00:31:53,287
I can't do what you do.

266
00:31:53,787 --> 00:31:55,372
I can't even handle one lover.

267
00:32:01,587 --> 00:32:02,796
I'll tell you what.

268
00:32:03,339 --> 00:32:04,882
The thing about love is

269
00:32:04,965 --> 00:32:07,426
whatever relationship…

270
00:32:07,509 --> 00:32:11,096
You're the last person who should be
giving love advice, aren't you?

271
00:32:26,236 --> 00:32:27,905
We're going to Qingdao East Road.

272
00:32:27,988 --> 00:32:29,073
What for?

273
00:32:29,531 --> 00:32:31,158
Your college classmate, Zhang Zhiyang.

274
00:32:31,241 --> 00:32:33,327
He is there now. I've just contacted him.

275
00:32:34,745 --> 00:32:35,954
It really is Zhiyang.

276
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:39,208
-I hear he's been supporting civic groups.
-Let's get in the car.

277
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:40,959
I'll talk to you later.

278
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:42,961
Defend democracy!

279
00:32:43,045 --> 00:32:44,338
Stand firm for freedom!

280
00:32:44,421 --> 00:32:46,131
Go, Taiwan! Go!

281
00:32:46,215 --> 00:32:48,092
Go, Taiwan!

282
00:32:48,175 --> 00:32:49,802
Let's say thanks again to

283
00:32:49,885 --> 00:32:52,137
Professor Hong from the Department
of Political Science, NTU.

284
00:32:52,221 --> 00:32:53,764
Let's give her some applause.

285
00:32:54,682 --> 00:32:57,309
Thank you for joining us
despite your busy schedule.

286
00:32:57,393 --> 00:32:58,435
Thank you!

287
00:32:58,519 --> 00:32:59,520
All right, people.

288
00:32:59,603 --> 00:33:02,439
It seems that everyone
showing up today is a heavyweight.

289
00:33:02,523 --> 00:33:04,358
Next, I'll introduce you to

290
00:33:04,441 --> 00:33:08,779
Director Chen Boyuan from the Coalition
for the Defense of Taiwan's Democracy.

291
00:33:08,862 --> 00:33:09,947
A round of applause.

292
00:33:12,199 --> 00:33:13,909
Hello, everyone! I'm Chen Boyuan.

293
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:15,869
Thank you for coming here!

294
00:33:17,621 --> 00:33:20,374
Taiwan's democracy
is facing a great threat,

295
00:33:21,041 --> 00:33:22,918
because the signing of the CSSTA

296
00:33:23,043 --> 00:33:26,380
is a deal under the table
that the government does behind our back.

297
00:33:28,882 --> 00:33:30,634
Regarding the rights and interests
of the people

298
00:33:30,718 --> 00:33:32,261
and the future of our country,

299
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:34,763
they've not carried out
transparent communication or discussion.

300
00:33:34,847 --> 00:33:37,099
Is that right to ask us
to simply accept it?

301
00:33:37,182 --> 00:33:39,059
No!

302
00:33:42,271 --> 00:33:44,940
It's not only an economic issue,

303
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:47,568
but it also involves
the sovereignty of Taiwan.

304
00:33:47,651 --> 00:33:51,029
Can we accept
such a rash and hasty decision?

305
00:33:51,113 --> 00:33:52,865
No!

306
00:33:53,615 --> 00:33:54,533
He is here.

307
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:57,035
Zhiyang, it's been ages.

308
00:33:57,119 --> 00:33:59,204
I didn't expect to meet you again
at a student protest.

309
00:33:59,288 --> 00:34:01,457
-Thank you for doing this.
-It's nothing.

310
00:34:02,124 --> 00:34:04,793
Your assistant is very capable.
She handles coordination quickly.

311
00:34:04,877 --> 00:34:06,086
-Thank you.
-Are you ready?

312
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:07,588
After he comes down, it's you turn.

313
00:34:09,715 --> 00:34:10,883
I owe you one.

314
00:34:11,425 --> 00:34:13,761
We go way back. Don't mention it.

315
00:34:13,844 --> 00:34:15,596
-Go up there. We'll have a chat later.
-Okay.

316
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:16,764
…a better Taiwan!

317
00:34:19,933 --> 00:34:21,477
We're not a disorderly mob.

318
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,895
We are citizens.

319
00:34:22,978 --> 00:34:24,855
We're not a disorderly mob.

320
00:34:24,938 --> 00:34:26,732
We are citizens.

321
00:34:27,316 --> 00:34:28,984
We're not a disorderly mob.

322
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:31,111
We are citizens.

323
00:34:31,195 --> 00:34:32,821
We're not a disorderly mob.

324
00:34:32,905 --> 00:34:34,907
We are citizens.

325
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:36,450
Thank you, everyone.

326
00:34:36,533 --> 00:34:37,785
Thank you.

327
00:34:37,868 --> 00:34:39,369
Thank you, Director Chen.

328
00:34:39,453 --> 00:34:40,871
Thank you.

329
00:34:40,954 --> 00:34:44,124
Guys, I just said that
we got some heavyweights here today.

330
00:34:44,208 --> 00:34:46,668
Next, I'll introduce you
to an old friend of mine

331
00:34:46,752 --> 00:34:47,961
an old comrade-in-arms.

332
00:34:48,545 --> 00:34:50,964
Let's have a warm applause to welcome

333
00:34:51,757 --> 00:34:53,133
my old comrade-in-arms,

334
00:34:53,217 --> 00:34:56,512
Chairman of Philo Culture Group,
Mr. Li Xianhong.

335
00:35:35,759 --> 00:35:38,136
Get out of here!

336
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:40,138
Get out of here!

337
00:35:40,222 --> 00:35:44,476
Get out of here!

338
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,394
Hypocrite.

339
00:35:45,936 --> 00:35:46,812
Shameless.

340
00:35:49,106 --> 00:35:51,650
We're now at the Sunflower protest.

341
00:35:51,733 --> 00:35:54,736
It is really a sea of people here.

342
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:58,657
But surprisingly, Mr. Li Xianhong,
Chairman of the Philo Culture Group,

343
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:00,534
has unexpectedly shown up.

344
00:36:00,617 --> 00:36:05,581
Apparently, he has just made a bow
to the huge crowd here.

345
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:07,833
The crowd keeps booing him incessantly.

346
00:36:08,542 --> 00:36:12,212
Let's see what statement
Li Xianhong will be making.

347
00:36:12,296 --> 00:36:15,007
CHAIRMAN OF THE PHILO GROUP
SHOWS UP AT STUDENT PROTEST

348
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:21,972
Get out of here!

349
00:36:40,824 --> 00:36:43,535
I want to represent our generation

350
00:36:44,745 --> 00:36:46,413
to apologize to all of you.

351
00:36:47,497 --> 00:36:48,832
We didn't do well enough,

352
00:36:49,583 --> 00:36:51,126
which made you come out here.

353
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:55,130
You are the warriors defending Taiwan.

354
00:36:57,424 --> 00:36:59,259
I will always stand by you.

355
00:37:02,971 --> 00:37:04,640
The government is acting inappropriately

356
00:37:05,891 --> 00:37:07,601
and wants to pass the CSSTA forcibly.

357
00:37:09,061 --> 00:37:11,355
You young people have stepped up bravely

358
00:37:12,272 --> 00:37:15,400
to defend democracy
and to safeguard Taiwan's interests.

359
00:37:17,486 --> 00:37:18,862
Defend democracy.

360

Safeguard Taiwan's interests.

361
00:37:24,826 --> 00:37:26,244
Defend democracy!

362
00:37:26,328 --> 00:37:28,038
Defend democracy!

363
00:37:28,121 --> 00:37:29,456
Safeguard Taiwan's interests!

364
00:37:29,539 --> 00:37:31,041
Safeguard Taiwan's interests!

365
00:37:31,124 --> 00:37:32,209
Defend democracy!

366
00:37:32,292 --> 00:37:33,752
Defend democracy!

Safeguard Taiwan's interests!

00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:36,713
Safeguard Taiwan's interests!

369
00:37:36,797 --> 00:37:38,298
Safeguard Taiwan's interests!

370
00:37:38,382 --> 00:37:40,050
Safeguard Taiwan's interests!

371
00:37:40,133 --> 00:37:41,718
Everyone, shout it out with me.

372
00:37:41,802 --> 00:37:43,929
<i>The person who waves</i>
<i>the banner of morality</i>

373
00:37:44,012 --> 00:37:45,347
<i>is not necessarily moral.</i>

374
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:46,640
Go, Taiwan! Go!

375
00:37:46,723 --> 00:37:48,225
<i>Before that night,</i>

376
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:52,938
<i>Li Xianhong was a privileged old man</i>
<i>representing generational injustice.</i>

377
00:37:54,356 --> 00:37:55,691
<i>However, at dawn,</i>

378
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:57,985
<i>he has transformed himself</i>

379
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:01,238
<i>into a beloved and respected elder.</i>

380
00:38:02,531 --> 00:38:03,448
<i>He…</i>

381
00:38:04,491 --> 00:38:06,410
<i>has turned back to his younger self,</i>

382
00:38:07,035 --> 00:38:08,370
<i>the broad-minded</i>

383
00:38:09,329 --> 00:38:11,123
<i>and forward-thinking Li Xianhong.</i>

384
00:38:13,375 --> 00:38:14,584
<i>At that moment,</i>

385
00:38:15,419 --> 00:38:16,878
<i>I finally came to understand</i>

386
00:38:18,755 --> 00:38:20,632
<i>that I could never give Li Xianhong</i>

387
00:38:21,425 --> 00:38:23,218
<i>what Lilian Lin could give him.</i>

388
00:38:34,604 --> 00:38:36,231
Keep it up, students.

389
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:37,649
Keep it up, students.

390
00:38:37,733 --> 00:38:39,359
Abandon the CSSTA.

391
00:38:39,443 --> 00:38:40,819
Abandon the CSSTA.

392
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:42,112
Support the students.

393
00:38:42,195 --> 00:38:43,405
Support the students.

394
00:38:43,488 --> 00:38:44,948
Go, Taiwan! Go!

395
00:38:45,032 --> 00:38:46,283
Go, Taiwan! Go!

396
00:38:46,366 --> 00:38:47,784
Support the students.

397
00:38:47,868 --> 00:38:49,202
Support the students.

398
00:38:49,286 --> 00:38:50,579
Abandon the CSSTA.

He's faking. What a disgrace.
He stands with young people.

401
00:38:56,543 --> 00:38:57,586
Privileged guy!
Drop dead!

402
00:38:57,669 --> 00:38:59,671
An apology doesn't mean anything.
Apology is sincere.

403
00:38:59,755 --> 00:39:01,757
Old man has apologized.
What a phony. I don't buy it.

404
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,384
Go earn your RMB, don't stay in Taiwan.
He finally apologized.

405
00:39:04,468 --> 00:39:05,802
That old man is wise.
I support him.

<i>BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL</i>
BY FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE

407
00:40:27,217 --> 00:40:28,718
Hi, Boss.

408
00:40:32,722 --> 00:40:34,099
I just left the rally.

409
00:40:34,808 --> 00:40:35,976
Because…

410
00:40:36,935 --> 00:40:38,186
I'm not feeling well.

411
00:40:40,147 --> 00:40:41,982
If there's nothing else for today,

412
00:40:42,065 --> 00:40:43,525
I'd like to call it a day.

413
00:40:46,862 --> 00:40:47,737
Bye.

414
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:14,472
Sometimes, you need to lie
when you want to slack off.

415
00:41:19,936 --> 00:41:20,896
Then…

416
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:23,106
Why don't you just go home?

417
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:27,110
Because I don't want to go home.

418
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:33,158
It is said,

419
00:41:33,241 --> 00:41:34,826
"liars are not lying to others,

420
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:36,661
but to themselves."

421
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:49,591
What about you?

422
00:41:50,133 --> 00:41:51,676
Did you come from the rally?

423
00:41:52,385 --> 00:41:53,929
Why didn't you stay there?

424
00:41:54,471 --> 00:41:55,722
It's really exciting there now.

425
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:58,600
Such a passionate event doesn't suit me.

426
00:42:00,268 --> 00:42:01,102
Me either.

427
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,985
Passions change people easily.

428
00:42:09,486 --> 00:42:11,404
Watching people change is exhausting.

429
00:42:19,329 --> 00:42:20,789
People always change.

430
00:42:21,289 --> 00:42:22,123
Don't they?
