00:00:05,047 --> 00:00:07,508
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">You enjoy little joys.</font></font></i>
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">You're losers who can't bear hardship.</font></font></i>

2
00:00:07,591 --> 00:00:09,844
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">If something goes wrong,</font></font></i>
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">you hide behind your parents.</font></font></i>

3
00:00:09,927 --> 00:00:11,887
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">You avoid leaving graduate school.</font></font></i>

4
00:00:12,888 --> 00:00:15,683
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">You complain about the society</font></font></i>
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">in social media.</font></font></i>

5
00:00:15,766 --> 00:00:16,934
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">You protest everywhere.</font></font></i>

6
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:20,563
Hong Lifang is really scheming.

7
00:00:21,105 --> 00:00:22,940
The interview will be on TV tonight,

8
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:25,151
and this is the morning's breaking news.

9
00:00:25,234 --> 00:00:26,485
What is she up to?

10
00:00:26,986 --> 00:00:28,446
I was too optimistic.

11
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:29,780
Xiaowen, I'm sorry.

12
00:00:29,864 --> 00:00:32,158
I shouldn't have agreed
to Hong Lifang's interview request.

13
00:00:32,241 --> 00:00:34,201
She would play dirty sooner or later.

14
00:00:34,702 --> 00:00:37,121
Besides, her show is truly popular.

15
00:00:38,414 --> 00:00:39,665
You were just doing your best.

16
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:42,877
Come in.

17
00:00:43,461 --> 00:00:46,589
Ms. Shen, the chairman's wife called.
It's on the private line.

18
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,011
-I'll leave you.
-It's okay, you don't have to go.

19
00:00:53,512 --> 00:00:55,848
-This is Shen Xiaowen.
-Where is Li Xianhong?

20
00:00:56,599 --> 00:00:59,143
Mrs. Li, we're also trying to contact him.

21
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:01,854
The moment the market opened today,
our stock price dropped over NT$20.

22
00:01:02,438 --> 00:01:04,732
I can't stop him
making troubles out there.

23
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:07,193
But as the general manager,
you should handle the crisis.

24
00:01:07,276 --> 00:01:09,570
Now, how can we explain to our investors?

25
00:01:13,157 --> 00:01:16,869
Who approved the terrible idea
of having Hong Lifang do the interview?

26
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:20,748
It was all my fault.

27
00:01:22,917 --> 00:01:25,294
Haven't you thought
about the consequences?

28
00:01:25,836 --> 00:01:28,506
Li Xianhong left her and went back to you.

29
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:30,299
Do you think she's okay with that?

30
00:01:30,382 --> 00:01:32,593
Don't you understand
how she must have felt?

31
00:01:44,063 --> 00:01:46,315
Xiaowen, thank you.

32
00:01:46,941 --> 00:01:49,860
I'm sorry about the troubles
I've caused the company.

33
00:01:50,361 --> 00:01:51,779
But who were those people?

34
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:54,240
What was the chairman doing with them?

35
00:01:54,323 --> 00:01:57,368
During the interview yesterday,
nothing unordinary happened, right?

36
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:59,286
I don't know who those young people are,

37
00:01:59,787 --> 00:02:01,455
but I'll get to the bottom of it.

38
00:02:02,665 --> 00:02:03,916
I'll get back to you.

39
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,459
I'll get going.

40
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,704
Hi, Lifang.

41
00:02:42,955 --> 00:02:43,873
What's up?

42
00:02:43,956 --> 00:02:44,957
Did you come to see me?

43
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,459
I need a moment of your time.
It won't take long.

44
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:53,340
You should know why I'm here.

45
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:57,136
If you don't tell me, how would I know?

46
00:02:57,636 --> 00:03:00,514
Is it a negotiation technique
that Li Xianhong taught you?

47
00:03:03,142 --> 00:03:05,519
I was aware
that you might have your own agenda.

48
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:08,856
But I respected your professionalism
and chose to trust you.

49
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,610
And the outcome proved
that I was too naive.

50
00:03:16,447 --> 00:03:17,781
I know he has his flaws,

51
00:03:18,282 --> 00:03:19,783
but he's not an evil person.

52
00:03:20,284 --> 00:03:23,078
He didn't take
all Taiwan's resources to China.

53
00:03:23,162 --> 00:03:26,498
Projecting the public's demonized image
of corporations onto him

54
00:03:26,582 --> 00:03:28,042
is simply unfair.

55
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:31,712
Even worse, you're stirring up
intergenerational conflict.

56
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:32,796
It's not good for Taiwan.

57
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,757
Please get off your high horse.

58
00:03:35,257 --> 00:03:37,343
You can say it straight to my face

59
00:03:37,426 --> 00:03:40,554
that our news has caused
great damage to your company's image.

60
00:03:40,638 --> 00:03:42,181
I might respect you more.

61
00:03:42,264 --> 00:03:43,474
Don't you think

62
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:47,478
that the media needs to verify the facts
when using content from social media?

63
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:50,648
Every word in the video
came from Li Xianhong's mouth.

64
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:54,026
It's also a fact that he said every word
in his debate with Ax.

65
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:56,153
I don't think we've misled the viewers.

66
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:57,488
Or are you saying…

67
00:03:58,322 --> 00:04:01,992
that our interview needs to be censored
by the Philo Culture Group?

68
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:16,548
Here you are, fresh vegetable medley.

69
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:19,593
Don't blame him.

70
00:04:20,094 --> 00:04:21,637
I forced him to bring me here.

71
00:04:27,643 --> 00:04:29,979
I wasn't trying
to avoid people at the office.

72
00:04:31,814 --> 00:04:33,941
But sir, to be honest,

73
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:36,235
you don't need to respond
to online comments.

74
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:39,780
Do you want me to stay silent,

75
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:42,116
and put up with their smears and attacks?

76
00:04:43,117 --> 00:04:45,202
Each generation has
its mode of communication.

77
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,662
I honestly suggest

78
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:48,914
that you should return to conventional TV.

79
00:04:48,998 --> 00:04:51,083
It's the battlefield we're familiar with.

80
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,961
We can't reach out to young people
if we give up the internet.

81
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:57,297
Moreover, most of our company's customers
are young people.

82
00:04:57,798 --> 00:05:00,509
If we stick to traditional media,
won't we push them away?

83
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:01,760
I understand that.

84
00:05:01,844 --> 00:05:03,595
But conventional TV

85
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:06,765
can ensure that everybody
receives the same information.

86
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,226
People may interpret it differently,
but it's okay.

87
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,937
At least we'll have a chance
to explain and clarify.

88
00:05:12,021 --> 00:05:14,648
That might trigger even more argument.

89
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:17,151
Do you think that's a good idea?

90
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:18,819
Do you really think so?

91
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:25,743
Here.

92
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:26,869
Have some soup.

93
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:30,330
Let's eat something. Don't be so grim.

94
00:05:30,414 --> 00:05:31,457
Come on.

95
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:35,377
All the online comments
are very irrational now.

96
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,131
We won't be able to reply
to every single one of them.

97
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:41,091
These are all Facebook trolls,

98
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:43,302
and we have no idea who they are.

99
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:46,388
They're calling you
someone with entrenched interests.

100
00:05:46,472 --> 00:05:48,807
It's an unfair fight
between unequal forces.

101
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,977
I've never been afraid of any fight.

102
00:05:52,061 --> 00:05:53,270
I know you aren't.

103
00:05:53,771 --> 00:05:56,940
But sir, please give me a chance
to deal with the repercussions.

104
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:00,277
Okay.

105
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,445
What is your plan?

106
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:03,781
Li Xianhong is just one man.

107
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:06,575
Ax Kuo and those on social media
are a bunch of people.

108
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:10,037
Personal views and public perceptions
shouldn't be mixed in the same story.

109
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,289
Furthermore, you've edited it maliciously.

110
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:15,084
Do you want to discuss
journalistic ethics with me?

111
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:17,211
Let's not waste time then.

112
00:06:17,795 --> 00:06:20,506
You can get in the elevator
and discuss it with our management.

113
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:22,132
Have at it, Mr. Executive Assistant.

114
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:26,303
What if…

115
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,764
people find out
you and he once had an affair?

116
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:32,267
Wouldn't your professionalism
in this news story

117
00:06:32,351 --> 00:06:34,186
be greatly questioned?

118
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:38,774
I'd like you to go
on Hong Lifang's live show again.

119
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:40,859
Why would you still believe her?

120
00:06:40,943 --> 00:06:42,820
She's the one who caused the mess.

121
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:45,030
She stirred up intergenerational conflict.

122
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:48,909
I believe the best solution
is to resolve the conflict on her show.

123
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:52,579
But will she be impartial?
Besides, Xiaowen is your general manager.

124
00:06:52,663 --> 00:06:53,747
I've talked with her.

125
00:06:53,831 --> 00:06:55,582
If her romantic history is exposed,

126
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:57,209
-I'm sure…
-Okay, stop.

127
00:06:58,961 --> 00:07:00,003
Let's do it.

128
00:07:00,963 --> 00:07:02,256
Make the arrangements.

129
00:07:05,843 --> 00:07:06,718
Thank you, sir.

130
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:11,557
It's an old story over a decade ago.

131
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,600
What effect do you think it can have?

132
00:07:19,148 --> 00:07:22,192
But you aren't that unknown journalist
over a decade ago, are you?

133
00:07:23,277 --> 00:07:24,570
Hong Lifang, TV host.

134
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:30,576
What do you want?

135
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:36,707
Give him another chance.

136
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:38,959
Let him go on your live show.

137
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:41,170
It's a win-win for both of us.

138
00:07:41,253 --> 00:07:42,880
You will get a good rating,

139
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:45,674
and he'll get a chance to explain himself.

140
00:07:48,552 --> 00:07:51,388
But I need you to guarantee
that you will be impartial.

141
00:07:56,935 --> 00:07:58,645
Can I ask you one more question?

142
00:08:04,443 --> 00:08:05,694
I'll go get some water.

143
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:17,122
I'm wondering…

144
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:20,542
what your relationship
with Lilian Lin is right now?

145
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:49,279
Patrick.

146
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:50,781
Let's eat.

147
00:11:20,931 --> 00:11:21,890
Please forgive me.

148
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:51,688
You're the boss.
I'll eat whatever you want.

149
00:12:57,861 --> 00:12:59,112
Good morning, Ms. Shen.

150
00:13:00,906 --> 00:13:02,449
Mom, good morning.

151
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:05,869
Why do you come here so early?
Get to work.

152
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:07,329
Mom, I just got here.

153
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:09,956
You want me to leave.
Don't you want to see me?

154
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:13,001
Nonsense, I feel at ease when you're here.

155
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:17,172
I've brought you
your favorite balloon flowers.

156
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:19,257
I'll replace the old ones, see?

157
00:13:19,758 --> 00:13:20,842
So beautiful.

158
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:24,262
Is Xianhong okay?

159
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:27,849
He's okay, of course.

160
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:30,185
The Shanghai plan is on track.

161
00:13:30,268 --> 00:13:32,145
Hangzhou has good chances too.

162
00:13:32,229 --> 00:13:33,730
We are all very excited.

163
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:35,565
Mom.

164
00:13:36,066 --> 00:13:37,567
You look amazing today.

165
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,028
Some days are better than others.

166
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:43,907
But my brain isn't as good as before.

167
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:44,908
You will be fine.

168
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:48,161
Just get more rest
and remember to take your medication.

169
00:13:48,912 --> 00:13:51,039
Why do you say the same things as he does?

170
00:13:52,707 --> 00:13:54,000
I've told him already.

171
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:57,462
I don't like wasting away like this.

172
00:13:58,463 --> 00:13:59,965
Just let me die.

173
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:03,134
Mom.

174
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:06,221
If you're gone,

175
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:08,890
I'll have no one to keep me company.

176
00:14:17,941 --> 00:14:19,192
Mom, do you know that

177
00:14:19,276 --> 00:14:22,112
Xianhong was in a TV interview recently?

178
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:24,573
He couldn't stop talking about you.

179
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:27,409
He said he would always remember
when he was a child,

180
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:30,870
you would paint
while helping him with his homework.

181
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:33,957
He could only have his achievements today
thanks to you.

182
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,336
I've seen the news.

183
00:14:40,255 --> 00:14:41,923
How can they smear him like that?

184
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:46,928
It's all right.

185
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:49,472
Don't mind them. They will pass soon.

186
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:51,516
You don't need to watch the nonsense.

187
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,270
Why did he argue with those youngsters?

188
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:57,647
He's always so impulsive.

189
00:14:58,189 --> 00:15:00,025
The student movements and protests,

190
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:02,277
he caused troubles everywhere.

191
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:06,906
Mom.

192
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:08,617
Don't you worry.

193
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:10,910
No matter what happens,

194
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:12,746
I'll be by his side.

195
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:22,547
Xiaowen.

196
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:26,134
I'm so sorry.

197
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:29,721
I know you love him very much.

198
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:32,098
However…

199
00:15:33,475 --> 00:15:35,477
he's unable to give you what you deserve.

200
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:38,938
I'm really sorry.

201
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:44,653
In my mind,

202
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:47,906
you are my daughter-in-law.

203
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,119
I am very grateful.

204
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:00,585
I really am.

205
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,217
Can you move the coffee forward?

206
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,718
-This one?
-Yeah.

207
00:16:09,219 --> 00:16:10,679
Good, the chocolate too.

208
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:12,889
-Like this?
-That's good.

209
00:16:14,516 --> 00:16:15,350
Perfect.

210
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,102
Hi, table for one?

211
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:22,565
Lily.

212
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:24,067
You have a guest.

213
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:34,411
Single-origin coffee, my treat.

214
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:35,328
Thank you.

215
00:16:41,376 --> 00:16:43,378
It seems you've already investigated me.

216
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:46,881
There are no secrets on Facebook.

217
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:53,388
So why are you here?

218
00:16:58,893 --> 00:17:00,186
Do you like Li Xianhong?

219
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:07,527
It's none of your business.

220
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:12,657
I'm just wondering

221
00:17:13,158 --> 00:17:14,617
if you were there that night,

222
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,454
why didn't you stop him from arguing?

223
00:17:17,996 --> 00:17:21,249
In addition, did you know
he was being recorded secretly?

224
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:28,006
He's an adult.

225
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:30,759
Does he still need
my permission to do anything?

226
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:36,264
If you love him,
why didn't you protect him?

227
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:43,605
You like Xianhong?

228
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:48,860
I met him when I was in high school.

229
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:51,488
The first job I got,
I started working for him.

230
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:53,239
I've been with him for ten years.

231
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:55,408
You still haven't answered my question.

232
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:13,134
Was he at your place last night?

233
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:23,061
I'm his personal secretary.

234
00:18:23,144 --> 00:18:24,729
I need to know his whereabouts.

235
00:18:24,813 --> 00:18:27,565
I did remind him
not to put himself on a high pedestal.

236
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:29,984
Not everyone can respect others.

237
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:34,405
For example, his mother wanted to die
and hoped he could respect her.

238
00:18:35,532 --> 00:18:36,658
He probably couldn't.

239
00:18:39,202 --> 00:18:40,453
He told you that much?

240
00:18:43,331 --> 00:18:44,749
How long have you known each other?

241
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,334
Two months?

242
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:49,212
-Three months?
-Hey, I'm not your love rival.

243
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:51,589
I don't like him that much.

244
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:03,518
Does he know you like him?

245
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:22,996
Now I'm relatively sure

246
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:25,623
that you knew about the recording.

247
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,376
Thank you for the coffee.

248
00:23:27,156 --> 00:23:27,990
Hi.

249
00:23:28,074 --> 00:23:29,867
Shumei.

250
00:23:30,451 --> 00:23:31,911
Sorry to keep you waiting.

251
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:34,872
I just got here.
I haven't been waiting long.

252
00:23:34,956 --> 00:23:36,082
I don't believe you.

253
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:39,627
During the legislative session,
when I get off work becomes uncertain.

254
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:42,630
Especially when they start debating,
it never ends.

255
00:23:42,713 --> 00:23:45,383
Like the CSSTA lately,
I think it's very dangerous.

256
00:23:45,466 --> 00:23:46,300
Are you hungry?

257
00:23:50,263 --> 00:23:52,431
We can eat something
at a convenience store.

258
00:23:52,515 --> 00:23:54,350
No way, take it. Give me your purse.

259
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:56,018
-Where are we going?
-Put it on.

260
00:23:56,102 --> 00:23:57,061
Hop on and you'll know.

261
00:23:57,145 --> 00:23:58,312
Hold on tight.

262
00:23:59,522 --> 00:24:01,482
-Uncle Yung.
-Uncle Yung.

263
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:04,735
You must be Shumei.

264
00:24:04,819 --> 00:24:07,697
Oh, I haven't come for a while,
but you still remember me.

265
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,157
Of course I remember you.

266
00:24:09,657 --> 00:24:11,409
You bring your boyfriend this time?

267
00:24:12,285 --> 00:24:13,995
He's ugly. I don't like him.

268
00:24:14,078 --> 00:24:15,121
That's not true.

269
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:17,165
He's pretty handsome.

270
00:24:17,248 --> 00:24:18,291
And he's well-built.

271
00:24:18,374 --> 00:24:19,417
That's right.

272
00:24:20,168 --> 00:24:22,795
What right? Hurry up and order.

273
00:24:22,879 --> 00:24:25,089
Uncle Yung, one red bean soup.

274
00:24:25,631 --> 00:24:27,008
-Okay.
-The same for me.

275
00:24:27,091 --> 00:24:27,925
Sure.

276
00:24:28,551 --> 00:24:30,970
When we were students,
we came here a few times every week.

277
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:32,889
Now I can't remember
when I was here last time.

278
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:34,640
This is very common.

279
00:24:34,724 --> 00:24:37,518
I'm working day and night,
but I don't even know what I'm doing.

280
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:41,147
Hey, didn't you say
you wanted to see me for something?

281
00:24:43,191 --> 00:24:45,484
Nothing really, I just wanted to see you.

282
00:24:46,027 --> 00:24:47,445
What? Can't I ask you out?

283
00:24:47,945 --> 00:24:49,614
I can tell
you have something on your mind.

284
00:24:49,697 --> 00:24:50,531
Spill it out.

285
00:24:51,365 --> 00:24:52,533
You know me the best.

286
00:24:53,242 --> 00:24:54,619
Skip those cheesy words.

287
00:24:54,702 --> 00:24:55,786
Tell me.

288
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:59,498
This morning, the news station called me.

289
00:24:59,582 --> 00:25:02,084
They asked me if I can be
on their live show the day after tomorrow.

290
00:25:02,793 --> 00:25:04,503
One of the guests will be Li Xianhong.

291
00:25:05,588 --> 00:25:07,423
You will face off with Li Xianhong?

292
00:25:08,132 --> 00:25:09,759
He still dares to go on TV?

293
00:25:10,426 --> 00:25:11,594
I guess so.

294
00:25:12,261 --> 00:25:13,763
So I want to ask you this.

295
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:16,265
Should I focus my argument
on his generation,

296
00:25:16,349 --> 00:25:17,934
or on Li Xianhong personally?

297
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,728
It depends on what you want to accomplish.

298
00:25:22,063 --> 00:25:23,522
I want everybody to know

299
00:25:23,606 --> 00:25:26,609
that the young people of our generation
don't really want to become losers.

300
00:25:27,276 --> 00:25:28,277
My point is,

301
00:25:28,361 --> 00:25:32,490
given the current cross-strait situation
we're facing intense competition.

302
00:25:32,573 --> 00:25:36,744
But the ruling party is not willing
to give us a chance for fair competition.

303
00:25:40,206 --> 00:25:41,165
Then,

304
00:25:41,249 --> 00:25:45,628
I think you should tie Li Xianhong
to China and the ruling party.

305
00:25:46,504 --> 00:25:49,590
Isn't Philo Culture Group
opening a new location in Shanghai?

306
00:25:49,674 --> 00:25:52,468
You can use it as your starting point.
How about that?

307
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:53,552
It sounds good.

308
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:57,139
These large corporations
have devoured Taiwan's resources.

309
00:25:57,223 --> 00:26:01,686
Now they're shamelessly packing up
and going to China to earn RMB.

310
00:26:03,521 --> 00:26:04,772
-Uncle Yung.
-Uncle Yung.

311
00:26:04,855 --> 00:26:06,732
I've made this pork rib soup myself.

312
00:26:06,816 --> 00:26:07,858
Oh, okay.

313
00:26:07,942 --> 00:26:11,862
Life isn't easy for young people like you.

314
00:26:11,946 --> 00:26:13,239
Enjoy it.

315
00:26:14,031 --> 00:26:15,658
-Get back to work on a full stomach.
-Right.

316
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:16,575
Thank you, Uncle Yung.

317
00:26:16,659 --> 00:26:17,493
I'll get back to work.

318
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:19,036
-Okay.
-Uncle Yung, you go ahead.

319
00:26:21,122 --> 00:26:22,248
Pork rib soup.

320
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:26,836
-It is so rich.
-This is delicious.

321
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:29,880
JAY

322
00:26:29,964 --> 00:26:30,881
It's Jay.

323
00:26:33,551 --> 00:26:34,593

<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">is carefully orchestrated and executed,</font></font></i>

345
00:27:34,945 --> 00:27:36,530
Director, are we okay to go?

346
00:27:36,614 --> 00:27:38,824
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">it becomes proof that conflict does exist.</font></font></i>

347
00:27:43,037 --> 00:27:44,038
Rolling.

348
00:27:44,121 --> 00:27:46,749
5, 4, 3, 2…

349
00:27:54,131 --> 00:27:54,965
I'm Hong Lifang.

350
00:27:55,049 --> 00:27:57,134
Welcome back
to <i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">Three Links Across the Strait.</font></font></i>

351
00:27:57,218 --> 00:27:58,386
We were just talking

352
00:27:58,469 --> 00:28:00,638
about how the young generation believes

353
00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:05,351
that people born in the 1960s
have taken up most of Taiwan's resources

354
00:28:05,434 --> 00:28:07,853
and robbed young people
of their opportunities.

355
00:28:07,937 --> 00:28:10,064
Chairman Li, what's your take on this?

356
00:28:10,564 --> 00:28:12,400
How did we rob them
of their opportunities?

357
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:15,945
The question is, have they worked hard?

358
00:28:16,487 --> 00:28:18,030
One fight for one's opportunities, right?

359
00:28:18,114 --> 00:28:19,448
It's because your generation

360
00:28:19,532 --> 00:28:21,951
occupies all the decision-making positions
and won't give them up.

361
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:23,661
But why? Because you can't do it.

362
00:28:23,744 --> 00:28:25,871
Mr. Li, please let me finish.

363
00:28:25,955 --> 00:28:28,499
How did your generation accumulate wealth?

364
00:28:28,582 --> 00:28:30,418
-Through exploitation.
-Right, yeah.

365
00:28:30,501 --> 00:28:34,130
You exploited cheap labor
to plunder Taiwan's resources.

366
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:35,339
What's even worse,

367
00:28:35,423 --> 00:28:37,258
-profits went to only a few people.
-Okay, Ax.

368
00:28:37,341 --> 00:28:38,759
Please allow me interrupt.

369
00:28:38,843 --> 00:28:42,513
Our debate seems to have got stuck
in a Rashomon situation.

370
00:28:42,596 --> 00:28:45,099
So, the young generation believes that

371
00:28:45,182 --> 00:28:47,768
back then,
he broader environment was changing

372
00:28:47,852 --> 00:28:50,104
and the times made the heroes, right?

373
00:28:50,187 --> 00:28:54,191
But the same hard work and talent,
if placed in today's society,

374
00:28:54,275 --> 00:28:57,736
might not be competitive at all.

375
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:58,821
But actually,

376
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:00,948
today's young people
are not any worse than we are.

377
00:29:01,031 --> 00:29:03,033
They're probably even more outstanding.

378
00:29:03,117 --> 00:29:07,913
Why can't they accomplish great things,
like Chairman Li yourself?

379
00:29:07,997 --> 00:29:08,831
Ms. Hong,

380
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:12,001
I think you should ask
these young people this question.

381
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:15,546
-Okay, then…
-I agree fully with Ms. Hong's thinking.

382
00:29:15,629 --> 00:29:17,673
In this age of information explosion,

383
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:20,217
so many people got PhDs
from the US and Europe.

384
00:29:20,301 --> 00:29:22,428
I believe that someone
who matches Mr. Li Xianhong

385
00:29:22,511 --> 00:29:25,431
in terms of education and background

386
00:29:25,514 --> 00:29:28,809
might not even be taken seriously
by today's standards.

387
00:29:28,893 --> 00:29:30,936
Right, we're living in different times.

388
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:33,898
Young people in Taiwan today
are facing tough challenges,

389
00:29:33,981 --> 00:29:36,525
because your education
and your competitiveness

390
00:29:36,609 --> 00:29:39,278
must be strong enough
to face global competition.

391
00:29:39,361 --> 00:29:41,197
Honestly, things are very tough.

392
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,239
Okay, Zhenbang.

393
00:29:42,323 --> 00:29:44,033
You came back
from Cambridge a few years ago.

394
00:29:44,116 --> 00:29:45,326
What's your view?

395
00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:49,538
Okay, first I'd like to respond
to what Li Xianhong said earlier.

396
00:29:49,622 --> 00:29:53,751
I think the biggest problem
of people born in the 1960s

397
00:29:53,834 --> 00:29:55,294
is that you refuse to listen

398
00:29:55,377 --> 00:29:57,254
-to the voice of the young generation.
-Yeah.

399
00:29:57,338 --> 00:29:59,131
You call them the strawberry generation.

400
00:29:59,215 --> 00:30:01,884
-You complain about their incompetence…
-Zhenbang.

401
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:03,677
-Actually, I…
-Zhenbang, listen.

402
00:30:03,761 --> 00:30:05,596
Please let me explain.

403
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:09,475
That's why I'm here today.

404
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:10,559
Right?

405
00:30:11,101 --> 00:30:12,311
Ours is a democratic society.

406
00:30:13,229 --> 00:30:16,607
The best way to eliminate
misunderstandings is though discussion.

407
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:18,025
This is interesting.

408
00:30:18,108 --> 00:30:21,487
Mr. Li just mentioned
our democratic society.

409
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:24,156
Let me ask you,
dare you say that in China?

410
00:30:24,782 --> 00:30:26,951
Don't you have a double standard?

411
00:30:27,034 --> 00:30:29,954
With this kind of standard,
how can you get people to trust you?

412
00:30:30,037 --> 00:30:32,831
I don't think we need to waste time
discussing with him.

413
00:30:32,915 --> 00:30:35,459
To put it bluntly, the Philo Culture Group

414
00:30:35,543 --> 00:30:38,963
has been stealing the country's resources,
and kissing up to the CCP.

415
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:40,714
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">Let me ask you.</font></font></i>

416
00:30:41,257 --> 00:30:43,717
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">Do you have any love for this land?</font></font></i>

417
00:30:44,218 --> 00:30:46,345
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">Hasn't this land raised and nurtured you?</font></font></i>

418
00:30:46,428 --> 00:30:50,558
Don't we already know what the investors
of the Philo Culture Group really want?

419
00:30:50,641 --> 00:30:54,228
Your actions reveal your evil intentions.
It is as clear as day.

420
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:55,938
Everyone knows where you stand.

421
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:58,148
What core values could you possibly have?

422
00:30:58,232 --> 00:31:01,694
Simply put, businessmen have no homeland.

423
00:31:01,777 --> 00:31:03,904
Right, the Philo Culture Group

424
00:31:03,988 --> 00:31:06,115
has long been regarded by Taiwanese people

425
00:31:06,198 --> 00:31:10,160
as the benchmark and role model
of cultural creativity and local culture.

426
00:31:10,244 --> 00:31:14,039
But now, their conduct and attitude

427
00:31:14,123 --> 00:31:16,667
truly hurt the feelings
of Taiwanese people.

428
00:31:19,628 --> 00:31:21,463
We have hurt Taiwanese people?

429
00:31:21,964 --> 00:31:24,883
We're promoting Chinese-speaking culture
for Taiwanese people.

430
00:31:24,967 --> 00:31:27,219
But you are a public figure

431
00:31:27,303 --> 00:31:29,555
and run a local company
in cultural and creative industries.

432
00:31:29,638 --> 00:31:32,975
Yet you've forgot about freedom of speech
and freedom of the press.

433
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:34,977
You're catering to the Chinese market.

434
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,562
You call yourself cultural and creative,

435
00:31:36,645 --> 00:31:39,440
but you're actually making profits
for a small number of people.

436
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:43,694
Mr. Li, do you have a response?

437
00:31:44,653 --> 00:31:46,113
Then I will go on.

438
00:31:46,196 --> 00:31:47,281
-Lifang?
-Yes.

439
00:31:47,364 --> 00:31:49,658
I have some inside information here.

440
00:31:49,742 --> 00:31:50,576
Look at this.

441
00:31:51,577 --> 00:31:55,331
Philo Culture Group has been doing poorly
in Taiwan for the past few years.

442
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:57,875
The is not a secret any more.

443
00:31:57,958 --> 00:31:59,126
Take a look at this.

444
00:31:59,209 --> 00:32:03,380
As early as 2009, which was 5 years ago,

445
00:32:03,464 --> 00:32:06,467
they were already busy
expanding into the Chinese market.

446
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:07,551
Look carefully.

447
00:32:07,635 --> 00:32:09,595
Their sales in China have skyrocketed.

448
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:13,766
Wow! This information is truly shocking.

449
00:32:13,849 --> 00:32:17,561
I still remember back then,
Mr. Li repeatedly said to the media

450
00:32:17,645 --> 00:32:20,814
that he would keep his roots in Taiwan,
support local companies

451
00:32:20,898 --> 00:32:22,733
and create local jobs, etc.

452
00:32:22,816 --> 00:32:24,860
But while he was saying that,

453
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:27,613
one of his foot
already stepped onto China.

454
00:32:27,696 --> 00:32:28,530
Mr. Li,

455
00:32:28,614 --> 00:32:32,201
are you tired of keeping up appearances
or you simply can't be bothered?

456
00:32:47,049 --> 00:32:47,883
Hey!

457
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:49,301
-What is going on?
-Mr. Li.

458
00:32:49,385 --> 00:32:50,260
Is he leaving?

459
00:32:50,344 --> 00:32:51,220
He can't take it.

460
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:54,139
-Chinese pig, get out of Taiwan.
-We've caught him.

461
00:32:54,223 --> 00:32:56,392
What now? He's leaving the discussion.

462
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:59,436
Didn't he promise a dialogue?
Now we can see his true self.

463
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,604
It's ridiculous.

464
00:33:20,708 --> 00:33:22,418
I shouldn't have listened to you.

465
00:33:31,635 --> 00:33:32,845
On the bright side,

466
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:35,514
at least you went on the show
in good faith

467
00:33:35,597 --> 00:33:37,057
and talked to them sincerely.

468
00:33:37,891 --> 00:33:40,394
-Maybe we can find other media…
-Wei.

469
00:33:41,562 --> 00:33:42,896
Take me to Lianyun Street.

470
00:33:43,439 --> 00:33:45,274
Drop off Rong at a nearby Metro station.

471
00:33:45,774 --> 00:33:46,692
Okay.

KISSING UP TO CCP, SELLING OUT TAIWAN

490
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:26,667
Come out!

491
00:35:30,087 --> 00:35:31,839
Hello, everyone, journalists.

492
00:35:31,922 --> 00:35:33,298
Please be quiet.

493
00:35:33,382 --> 00:35:35,926
The general manager
will now give a statement.

494
00:35:37,261 --> 00:35:38,971
Is the Philo Culture Group
selling out Taiwan?

495
00:35:39,054 --> 00:35:40,347
Please explain!

496
00:35:42,891 --> 00:35:44,393
Dear shareholders,

497
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:47,563
the Philo Culture Group's
cross-Strait strategy these years

498
00:35:47,646 --> 00:35:50,023
has brought significant growth
in the company's sales.

499
00:35:50,107 --> 00:35:54,570
In particular, we've been opening up
shopping malls in key Chinese cities.

500
00:35:54,653 --> 00:35:56,363
-They serve as a model.
-Bullshit!

501
00:35:56,446 --> 00:35:58,782
-You're in bed with the CCP!
-Total crap!

502
00:35:58,866 --> 00:36:00,617
You're selling out Taiwan!

503
00:36:01,577 --> 00:36:03,537
Excuse me. Miss, please calm down.

504
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:04,872
Please let us finish.

505
00:36:04,955 --> 00:36:06,206
We'll give you an explanation.

506
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:08,166
-Get Li Xianhong out here.
-Thank you.

507
00:36:08,792 --> 00:36:10,752
What are your thoughts
on Mr. Li's remarks?

508
00:36:10,836 --> 00:36:11,753
Please explain.

509
00:36:11,837 --> 00:36:15,048
When the company profits,
all shareholders will also make money.

510
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:17,593
Chairman Li Xianhong's personal views

511
00:36:17,676 --> 00:36:19,344
do not represent the company.

512
00:36:19,428 --> 00:36:21,513
You can rest assured that our management

513
00:36:21,597 --> 00:36:24,016
will not be affected
by this public relations crisis.

514
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,939
Please stop!

515
00:36:31,732 --> 00:36:33,400
Don't record it.

516
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:57,925
Hey.

517
00:36:59,843 --> 00:37:03,096
If you've come to check
how I'm doing after being hit by eggs,

518
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,264
then don't worry.

519
00:37:04,348 --> 00:37:05,641
I'm not injured.

520
00:37:07,351 --> 00:37:08,977
I just reek of eggs.

521
00:37:20,822 --> 00:37:24,326
LI XIANHONG AND HIS WOMEN
OLD FLAMES AND NEW LOVE

522
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:27,162
Have you read this magazine?

523
00:37:34,544 --> 00:37:35,796
Please tell me…

524
00:37:37,047 --> 00:37:38,966
that you have nothing to do with this.

525
00:37:49,643 --> 00:37:51,770

to Chairman Li Xianhong
of Philo Culture Group.

530
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:01,363
Have you seen this? Wow!

531
00:38:01,446 --> 00:38:03,240
He looks like a gentleman,

532
00:38:03,323 --> 00:38:06,910
but it is no secret
that Li Xianhong is a womanizer.

533

536
00:38:13,917 --> 00:38:16,044

<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">and criticizing her.</font></font></i>

540
00:38:20,924 --> 00:38:23,552
They're calling her a shameless mistress.

541
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:26,221
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">Wow! They really kick her when she's down!</font></font></i>

542
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,515
I knew the story must be very complicated.

543
00:38:28,598 --> 00:38:30,183
See? This is a woman's revenge.

544
00:38:30,267 --> 00:38:34,146
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">She's gotten her revenge for being dumped</font></font></i>

545
00:38:34,229 --> 00:38:36,148
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">Yeah! Of course she has.</font></font></i>

547
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:39,151

548
00:38:39,234 --> 00:38:42,988

549
00:38:43,071 --> 00:38:46,033

551
00:38:48,702 --> 00:38:50,037
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">Guys, two years!</font></font></i>

552
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:53,707
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">You could have two kids,</font></font></i>
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">or maybe three if you try really hard.</font></font></i>

553
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:55,876

555
00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:01,548

557
00:39:04,384 --> 00:39:05,552
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">because Ya-Ru Liao</font></font></i>

558

<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">comes from a wealthy family</font></font></i>

559
00:39:09,097 --> 00:39:11,641
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">However, Shen Xiaowen</font></font></i>
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">is an extraordinary woman.</font></font></i>

560
00:39:11,725 --> 00:39:14,144
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">Long ago, Wang Baochuan</font></font></i>
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">waited 18 years for her husband.</font></font></i>

561
00:39:14,227 --> 00:39:17,230
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">Shen Xiaowen</font></font></i>
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">was with Li Xianhong for over 20 years.</font></font></i>

562
00:39:17,314 --> 00:39:18,899

563
00:39:18,982 --> 00:39:20,567
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">She still ended up getting dumped.</font></font></i>

564
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:22,444
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">Why did he do that? Ms. Zhan.</font></font></i>

565
00:39:22,527 --> 00:39:26,031
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">Shen Xiaowen had been with Li Xianhong</font></font></i>
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">since they started the company.</font></font></i>

566
00:39:26,114 --> 00:39:27,991
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">However, she was only the mistress.</font></font></i>

567
00:39:28,075 --> 00:39:29,409
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">She could never become his wife.</font></font></i>

568
00:39:29,493 --> 00:39:30,702
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">He already has a wife.</font></font></i>

569
00:39:30,786 --> 00:39:32,079
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">His wife is Ya-Ru Liao.</font></font></i>

570
00:39:32,162 --> 00:39:35,040
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">So strictly speaking,</font></font></i>
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">who is the official mistress?</font></font></i>

571
00:39:35,123 --> 00:39:36,500
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">It is Shen Xiaowen.</font></font></i>

572
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:38,293
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">Lilian Lin is the backup mistress.</font></font></i>

573
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:40,962
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">Maybe next year there will be a new one.</font></font></i>
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">Who knows?</font></font></i>

574
00:39:41,046 --> 00:39:42,047
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">And then another.</font></font></i>

575
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:43,548
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">-And another.</font></font></i>
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">-One each year.</font></font></i>

576
00:39:43,632 --> 00:39:45,175
<i><font face="sansSerif"><font color="#ffffff">The number keeps rising.</font></font></i>
