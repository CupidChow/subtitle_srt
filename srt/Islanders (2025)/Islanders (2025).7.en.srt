00:01:25,753 --> 00:01:29,340
The memorial service will now begin.

2
00:01:29,924 --> 00:01:34,178
Ms. Ya-Ru Liao

3
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:35,679
please take your position.

4
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:40,684
Colleagues and representatives
from the Philo Culture Group,

5
00:01:40,768 --> 00:01:42,186
please take your position.

6
00:01:44,063 --> 00:01:45,940
Officiant, please take your position.

7
00:01:46,565 --> 00:01:50,069
Accompanying officiants,
please take your position.

8
00:01:50,152 --> 00:01:52,071
Please offer incense.

9
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:57,243
Please pay respect to the deceased
with three bows.

10
00:01:57,326 --> 00:01:59,036
First bow.

11
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:03,541
Second bow.

12
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:06,710
Third bow.

13
00:02:09,088 --> 00:02:11,841
The bereaved family
please bow in gratitude.

14
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:16,637
Guests please return the bow.

15
00:02:19,515 --> 00:02:20,808
How is everything in the company?

16
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,601
It's…

17
00:02:23,102 --> 00:02:24,854
It's different without you.

18
00:02:26,272 --> 00:02:27,189
Is it?

19
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:29,900
You must be feeling more relaxed
without me.

20
00:02:29,984 --> 00:02:31,026
It's not true.

21
00:02:34,446 --> 00:02:36,073
It's been a while since I saw you last.

22
00:02:36,699 --> 00:02:38,200
Sadly it is in this situation.

23
00:02:42,413 --> 00:02:43,330
Yeah.

24
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:46,375
No one would have foreseen this.

25
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:50,588
Okay.

26
00:02:52,965 --> 00:02:53,924
Take care of yourself.

27
00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:01,724
I will.

MEMORIAL SERVICE FOR MS. SHEN XIAOWEN

29
00:03:06,312 --> 00:03:07,730
Come back to visit us, okay?

30
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:10,858
No, I won't.

31
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:12,109
You're so mean.

32
00:03:14,904 --> 00:03:15,821
Bye.

33
00:03:23,495 --> 00:03:24,330
Hi.

34
00:03:24,413 --> 00:03:25,247
Eh?

35
00:03:25,748 --> 00:03:27,041
Why haven't you left yet?

36
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:30,628
I wanted to talk to you.

37
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:34,590
Are you all right?

38
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:39,094
Not too bad.

39
00:03:44,016 --> 00:03:45,100
Li Xianhong…

40
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:47,937
He didn't come back?

41
00:03:51,607 --> 00:03:52,900
He sent floral wreaths.

42
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:01,909
Your new friend?

43
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:07,915
My boyfriend.

44
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:09,333
Half a year now.

45
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,131
You two look good together.

46
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,259
Hugging him must feel great.

47
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:26,475
I'm glad you're doing well.

48
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:28,852
I gotta go.

49
00:04:33,524 --> 00:04:34,358
Patrick.

50
00:04:41,824 --> 00:04:42,992
Take good care of yourself.

MEMORIAL SERVICE FOR MS. SHEN XIAOWEN

53
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,429
Please cancel today's meetings for me.

54
00:07:09,513 --> 00:07:11,265
Okay, I'll get right to it.

55
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:13,142
Let's start.

56
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:23,569
To promote the cultural heritage
of Chinese way of life,

57
00:07:23,652 --> 00:07:25,737
my aspiration is that Philo Culture

58
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,198
will take on this mission.

59
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:32,452
Everyone can clearly see
our achievements in Shanghai.

60
00:07:32,536 --> 00:07:36,248
We are also very grateful
for everyone's support.

61
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:39,668
I have a question
that I'd like to ask you.

62
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:41,503
It's about Ms. Lilian Lin.

63
00:07:41,587 --> 00:07:45,924
We often see
that you and M. Lilian Lin together.

64
00:07:46,008 --> 00:07:48,844
She's young
but she's been promoted to this position.

65
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:51,555
People are hence curious about her.

66
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:03,483
Lilian is the creative director
of Philo Culture in Shanghai.

67
00:08:04,568 --> 00:08:08,071
Not only did she have
extensive overseas experience,

68
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:11,158
but she is also very good
at foreign languages.

69
00:08:12,868 --> 00:08:16,205
And she is also an outstanding artist.

70
00:08:16,288 --> 00:08:19,917
We have several projects
for European and American products.

71
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:24,796
Lilian is personally in charge of them.

72
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,797
And that…

73
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,972
So,

74
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,809
you can certainly expect
great things from her.

75
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:39,770
All right, Chairman Li.

76
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:41,230
I have another question.

77
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:44,107
Apart from your current projects
in Shanghai,

78
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:48,028
do you have any plans
to open up new branches in other cities?

79
00:08:50,906 --> 00:08:52,783
Sorry, could you please repeat that?

80
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:54,493
Well, I was just saying

81
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:57,287
apart from your current projects
in Shanghai, do you…

82
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:23,290
CALL FROM XINPING HOSPITAL

83
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:38,555
Chairman Li.

84
00:10:39,765 --> 00:10:41,391
From the hospital's perspective,

85
00:10:41,475 --> 00:10:44,353
we will resuscitate the patient
regardless of their condition.

86
00:10:47,189 --> 00:10:48,982
But I must tell you in all honesty,

87
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,694
given your mother's current condition,

88
00:10:52,778 --> 00:10:55,030
any further invasive treatment…

89
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:58,033
would place a heavy burden on her.

90
00:10:59,743 --> 00:11:01,161
It will be very hard on her.

91
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:07,042
I know it's a hard decision to make.

92
00:11:09,461 --> 00:11:10,879
Here's the consent form.

93
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,881
Please read it.

94
00:11:13,924 --> 00:11:16,885
If you have any questions,
feel free to discuss it with me.

LI XIAN…

98
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,266
Thank you for going to the hospital.

99
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:44,653
You can sleep upstairs.

100
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:45,904
I'll sleep on the sofa.

101
00:15:49,574 --> 00:15:50,450
Okay.

102
00:21:34,544 --> 00:21:36,170
-How much is mine?
-All right.

103
00:21:36,671 --> 00:21:37,547
It's NT$75.

104
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:38,506
NT$75?

105
00:21:39,507 --> 00:21:40,425
Thank you.

106
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:07,368
Madam.

107
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:09,662
-A cup of warm soymilk.
-Okay.

108
00:22:45,573 --> 00:22:47,283
Sir, do you need any help?

109
00:22:50,578 --> 00:22:51,537
Let me help you.

110
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:52,872
Okay.

111
00:22:57,877 --> 00:22:58,836
It's a bit tight.

112
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,921
I know.

113
00:24:03,901 --> 00:24:04,819
Hello.

114
00:24:07,697 --> 00:24:08,739
What are the odds?

115
00:24:08,823 --> 00:24:09,699
Yeah.

116
00:24:11,576 --> 00:24:12,910
Are you setting up a tent?

117
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:14,495
Yeah.

118
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:18,666
Thank you for helping me earlier.

119
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:20,209
Don't mention it.

120
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,295
Are you a tourist?

121
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:24,338
Yeah.

122
00:24:24,422 --> 00:24:25,339
First time you're here?

123
00:24:26,007 --> 00:24:27,341
Not really my first time.

124
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:30,845
It is however the first time
that I drove here by myself.

125
00:24:31,721 --> 00:24:33,347
Why did you want to drive here?

126
00:24:34,974 --> 00:24:37,685
It was a rare opportunity
to come here by myself,

127
00:24:37,768 --> 00:24:41,105
so I wanted to try something
I didn't dare to do before.

128
00:24:42,023 --> 00:24:43,107
Drive carefully.

129
00:24:43,941 --> 00:24:45,193
I'm very careful.

130
00:24:45,276 --> 00:24:47,904
I drive at just 20 to 30 km/h.

131
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:49,030
That's too slow.

132
00:24:49,113 --> 00:24:50,198
A bit, yeah.

133
00:24:50,948 --> 00:24:51,949
Can you do me a favor?

134
00:24:52,533 --> 00:24:53,367
Sure.

135
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:57,205
Help me hang it up.

136
00:24:57,955 --> 00:24:59,832
-Hang it up.
-Yeah, over there.

137
00:25:00,374 --> 00:25:02,084
-All right.
-Like this.

138
00:25:07,924 --> 00:25:10,343
So, you said
because you used to work at sea,

139
00:25:10,426 --> 00:25:13,512
you have been
to the Philippines, Thailand,

140
00:25:13,596 --> 00:25:16,098
Papua New Guinea,

141
00:25:16,182 --> 00:25:17,725
as well as Greece,

142
00:25:17,808 --> 00:25:19,644
Alaska and Argentina.

143
00:25:20,144 --> 00:25:20,978
Yeah.

144
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:23,940
That sounds incredible.

145
00:25:25,983 --> 00:25:27,777
Every time I come back to Taipei,

146
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:30,488
my friends would assume
I've just returned from abroad,

147
00:25:30,988 --> 00:25:32,448
They always envy me.

148
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:36,035
But they don't really know…

149
00:25:36,619 --> 00:25:39,080
what kind of life I've had
in the last 10 years.

150
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:41,582
Perhaps…

151
00:25:42,625 --> 00:25:44,877
foreign lands always seem
beautiful and prosperous.

152
00:25:47,588 --> 00:25:48,631
So,

153
00:25:49,966 --> 00:25:53,386
you know how much we misunderstand
other people's lives.

154
00:25:57,223 --> 00:25:59,016
-Have you always been in Taiwan?
-Yes.

155
00:26:00,309 --> 00:26:02,103
But I went to Shanghai a few months ago.

156
00:26:02,812 --> 00:26:04,647
I was unemployed
and tried to find a job there.

157
00:26:05,147 --> 00:26:06,107
I didn't find one.

158
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,943
Maybe deep down, I wasn't ready yet.

159
00:26:10,152 --> 00:26:11,362
If you had found a job,

160
00:26:12,363 --> 00:26:13,781
would you have stayed there?

161
00:26:14,407 --> 00:26:15,408
I might have.

162
00:26:16,951 --> 00:26:18,619
Actually, I have many friends in Shanghai.

163
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:22,957
But the thought
of getting used to a new environment,

164
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,709
new people and new things

165
00:26:25,376 --> 00:26:26,669
kind of puts me off.

166
00:26:29,422 --> 00:26:30,589
If that is the case,

167
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:33,134
being alone is not too bad.

168
00:26:33,217 --> 00:26:34,635
Yeah, it's not too bad.

169
00:26:36,053 --> 00:26:36,887
How about you?

170
00:26:37,388 --> 00:26:39,473
Do you often do this? Being alone?

171
00:26:45,688 --> 00:26:49,066
Do you actually like being alone?
Or do you choose to be alone?

172
00:27:01,537 --> 00:27:02,997
Never mind. You don't have to answer.

173
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:06,500
But I can tell
that you truly love the sea. Am I right?

174
00:27:08,502 --> 00:27:09,378
Yeah.

175
00:27:15,551 --> 00:27:17,219
I used to love the sea when I was a child.

176
00:27:19,096 --> 00:27:20,723
You don't like it
now that you've grown up?

177
00:27:28,564 --> 00:27:30,274
People always change, don't they?

178
00:27:37,698 --> 00:27:39,200
Have we met before?

179
00:27:40,242 --> 00:27:41,202
No.

180
00:27:41,285 --> 00:27:43,871
We just met this morning
when you helped me move my car.

<i>BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL</i>

Watching people change is exhausting.

00:27:57,551 --> 00:27:59,136

00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:08,854
<i>You're the one who read Nietzsche</i>
<i>at the convenience store.</i>

187
00:28:08,938 --> 00:28:10,064
<i>That's right!</i>

188
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:12,441
<i>It took you long enough!</i>

189
00:28:15,653 --> 00:28:16,737
Long time no see.

190
00:28:21,534 --> 00:28:23,077
Long time no see.

191
00:28:23,828 --> 00:28:25,496
Long time no see.

192
00:29:57,671 --> 00:29:58,756
Where would you wish to go?

193
00:30:00,966 --> 00:30:02,009
Greenland.

194
00:30:02,843 --> 00:30:03,719
Why?

195
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:07,515
I want to hear glaciers cracking
with my own ears.

196
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:10,226
I want to feel…

197
00:30:10,851 --> 00:30:12,937
the scream beneath the utmost tenderness.

198
00:30:17,316 --> 00:30:19,818
But I will only travel
with someone I love.

199
00:30:19,902 --> 00:30:21,612
Traveling by myself will be too lonely.

200
00:31:02,278 --> 00:31:03,821
Promise me one thing, okay?

201
00:31:07,658 --> 00:31:10,995
No matter how you end up with him
in the future,

202
00:31:12,371 --> 00:31:13,205
you…

203
00:31:14,373 --> 00:31:16,083
must never lose who you truly are.

204
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:48,152
The people I met at sea…

205
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:54,199
helped me understand the value of life.

206
00:34:06,837 --> 00:34:07,755
Maybe.

207
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:12,134
Those people who appear in your life…

208
00:34:13,677 --> 00:34:15,971
can also easily disappear.

209
00:34:22,186 --> 00:34:23,687
For me,

210
00:34:26,565 --> 00:34:27,858
they are still here with me.

211
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:35,824
And it's because of their kindness
that we've ended up here now.

212
00:34:40,788 --> 00:34:41,622
A toast…

213
00:34:41,705 --> 00:34:43,040
to strangers.

214
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:55,719
To the whole world.

215
00:35:29,545 --> 00:35:30,462
Come on.

216
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:42,057
<i>The first step to becoming a free person</i>

217
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,561
<i>is to give up what is unnecessary.</i>

218
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:52,192
<i>A female Danish poet said,</i>

219
00:35:52,276 --> 00:35:55,445
<i>"the cure for anything is salt water:</i>

220
00:35:56,113 --> 00:35:59,157
<i>sweat, tears or the sea."</i>

221
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:03,829
<i>And Jay said,</i>

222
00:36:03,912 --> 00:36:05,539
<i>"though we are islanders,</i>

223
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:09,710
<i>most of us choose to face the land,</i>
<i>and turn our backs to the sea.</i>

224
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:11,795
<i>It's truly a pity,</i>

225
00:36:15,549 --> 00:36:19,344
<i>because we would lose the chance</i>
<i>to embrace a wider and greater world."</i>

226
00:36:48,457 --> 00:36:49,625
<i>I love the sea,</i>

227
00:36:50,792 --> 00:36:52,961
<i>not because it makes me feel small,</i>

228
00:36:55,672 --> 00:36:57,132
<i>but because it teaches me</i>

229
00:36:57,716 --> 00:37:00,636
<i>that I belong to a realm</i>
<i>that is vast and boundless.</i>

230
00:37:04,264 --> 00:37:05,182
<i>This…</i>

231
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:07,643
<i>could be what freedom means.</i>
