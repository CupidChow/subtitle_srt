=Episode 20=

11
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,240
I remember now.

12
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,000
I feel like I owe you an apology.

13
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,400
Sorry.

14
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,480
You don't owe me anything.

15
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,000
No guilt between us.

16
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,800
So, did anything come back to you?

17
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,480
Report.

18
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,760
I want to challenge.

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,200
Who do you want to challenge?

20
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,280
I want to challenge you.

21
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,160
Come on.

22
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:18,120
I don't hit women.

23
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,080
Go back.

24
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,520
I won.

25
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,480
Last minute.

26
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,160
If you can't find the last suspect,

27
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,520
everyone runs 10 km with full gear.

28
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:36,800
Report.

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,920
What are you doing?

30
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,040
Time's up.

31
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,040
The capture failed.

32
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,440
I just remembered

33
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,200
our college days.

34
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,990
- Chen Yasin.
- Here.

35
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,400
Tell everyone

36
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,780
how you finished the mission.

37
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,760
Sir,

38
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,000
I...

39
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,000
I used charm on Han Xu.

40
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,920
Of course, I wanted to win.

41
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,640
I remember now. Really.

42
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,320
But another me

43
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,480
seems to have gone.

44
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:35,760
Good.

45
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:37,960
Good.

46
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,080
What's your plan now?

47
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:49,920
He once told me

48
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,600
that the lighthouse in my hometown

49
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,200
is where it all began.

50
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,600
I'm planning to go see it.

51
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,640
The lighthouse?

52
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,400
Yeah.

53
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:05,710
The insider cop

54
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,800
has been using this number
to reach Wang Mingcheng.

55
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,760
(Insider cop)

56
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,600
I'll leave it to you.

57
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,680
Sure, I'll wait for you.

58
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,200
Sorry about that.

59
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,520
Han is still the sharpest.

60
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,160
We've been at this for so long,

61
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,360
but we couldn't help.

62
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,420
(Insider cop)
Yet he brought us the lead.

63
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:45,680
This time,

64
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,120
I got two real ones.

65
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,640
If this number

66
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,920
is really what we think,

67
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,440
then today

68
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,520
is when we finish the job.

69
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,800
When it's done,

70
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,580
we'll celebrate your success.

71
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,580
Do you really think it's him?

72
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,620
I think so.

73
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,480
My luck

74
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,760
has always been good.

75
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:05,960
Let's go.

76
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,040
How could he have escaped?

77
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,400
He didn't escape.

78
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,440
We didn't even see him.

79
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,560
Go question them first.

80
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,120
I have to go.

81
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,120
Alright.

82
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,480
Director.

83
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,560
Got you.

84
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,410
Watch the evidence; I'll go after him.

85
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,560
Don't move.

86
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,600
Put your gun down.

87
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,120
Director Zhou.

88
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,840
Spare yourself some dignity.

89
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,000
Songtai.

90
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,200
Stay calm.

91
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,120
What do you want?

92
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,080
Women?

93
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,120
Money?

94
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,680
Name the amount, and I'll pay it.

95
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,520
I only want you.

96
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,720
Drop the gun.

97
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:08,140
Chief Ma.

98
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,000
Songtai.

99
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:11,040
Let Director Zhou go.

100
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,240
Don't get in my way.

101
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,700
I'm the Senior Inspector of Police HQ.

102
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,600
I'm here under orders
to arrest the mole.

103
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,540
- Why should I trust you?
- I don't need you to.

104
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,600
If we take him back,

105
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,240
you'll see the proof.

106
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,040
Nice.

107
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,040
Well done.

108
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,080
All my efforts to mentor you paid off.

109
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,120
Senior Inspector?

110
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,320
This guy hid himself deep.

111
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,160
Clean up the scene.

112
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,700
(Tyrone Hotel)

113
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,000
Sworn Father.

114
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,040
Zhou's been exposed.

115
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:13,870
What should I do next?

116
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,440
Got it.

117
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,280
Good son.

118
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:23,800
You did well.

119
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,840
Come back.

120
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,120
Chief Ma.

121
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,110
Chief Ma.

122
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,980
(Mysterious prison guard)

123
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,760
Jiu.

124
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,760
Coming.

125
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:25,960
Boss.

126
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,560
Why is the door locked?

127
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,700
I was tired from the journey yesterday,

128
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:32,640
so I wanted to nap.

129
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,840
What's up?

130
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,400
Ma is back.

131
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:37,760
Go pick him up.

132
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,120
Only use this phone to reach him.

133
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,880
I don't smoke.

134
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,040
Boss Ma, you've been gone for years.

135
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,920
We thought you were dead.

136
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,000
Don't pry

137
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,760
into my business.

138
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,680
Why is it prying?

139
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,280
I'm just concerned for you.

140
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,200
Not many of the kids

141
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,900
from your group back then survived.

142
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,520
Seeing you today

143
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,440
really makes me happy.

144
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,400
Remember?

145
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,440
Back then,

146
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,280
who cooked for you guys?

147
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,280
I didn't do much.

148
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,920
Just helped my sworn father

149
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,400
handle some dirty work.

150
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,080
You vanished for years

151
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,320
and went deep undercover?

152
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:05,960
Impressive.

153
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,200
I knew it.

154
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,600
When the cops raided,

155
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,080
the Boss not only escaped

156
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,880
but also killed the cop
and the informant.

157
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,440
Do you know who that informant was?

158
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,360
- Xiao Ran.
- I know.

159
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,360
I'm the one who dealt with Xiao Ran.

160
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,720
That's a huge deal.

161
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,620
(Wang Yu)

162
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,120
(Found Xiao Ran's killer. Let's meet.)

163
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:16,840
Where is this?

164
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:18,360
Things are tense lately.

165
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,840
The Boss changed the spot.

166
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,310
Let's move.

167
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,720
The Boss is waiting inside.

168
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:53,320
Sworn Father?

169
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,480
Wang Yu.

170
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,240
Why is it you?
