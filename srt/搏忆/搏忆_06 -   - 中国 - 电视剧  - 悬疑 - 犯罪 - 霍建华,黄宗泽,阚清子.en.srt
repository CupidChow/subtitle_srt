11
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:51,860
Officer Han.

12
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:53,260
So you're letting me go?

13
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:56,160
I just frightened you.

14
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:57,860
No bullets in it.

15
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:01,860
Don't you want to know who made me lie?

16
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:05,300
Who was it?

17
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:06,780
I don't know.

18
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,390
But I have a recording of him.

19
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:10,010
I may find some clues in it.

20
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:12,020
Let me hear.

21
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,900
Zhang Ahua, got your evidence of crime?

22
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:18,900
If you don't want to get caught,

23
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:20,660
then do exactly as I say.

24
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:24,420
Officer Han Xu
will visit you this afternoon.

25
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:26,820
He's going to ask you to verify a video.

26
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,700
I don't care how you do it,

27
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:31,190
just make him believe the video

28
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,990
was recorded two months ago.

29
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:34,700
Once you finish,

30
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:37,620
all your evidence of crime will be erased.

31
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:40,540
If you mess up, you'll be heading to jail.

32
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,140
So this is the clue?

33
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:43,460
No, that's not it.

34
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,360
I'm just saying,

35
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:45,500
I've made a software

36
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:46,860
to filter and match audio.

37
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:48,220
If you have a sample,

38
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:49,940
we can figure out who made this call.

39
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:51,380
Think about it,

40
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,260
whoever found me before you got here

41
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,860
must know your moves.

42
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:56,260
Call him now.

43
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:57,420
I'll run the analysis.

44
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:58,760
Then we can narrow it down.

45
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,300
Take me to whoever checked this.

46
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,180
I'll ask them myself.

47
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,060
(Start matching? Yes; No)

48
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:14,140
(Wang Jian)

49
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:14,980
Han Xu,

50
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,260
didn't expect this.

51
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,580
Wang, how's your injury?

52
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,820
It's because of you. Any regrets?

53
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,100
(Sound Synthesis; Close)

54
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:30,420
I don't know yet.

55
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:32,540
Anyone else involved?

56
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:38,820
Yeah, there is.

57
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:55,300
(Wu)

58
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,740
Master, are you alright?

59
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:58,380
Wu,

60
00:02:58,460 --> 00:02:59,420
how's Wang's injury?

61
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,130
Nothing to worry about.

62
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:02,740
(OK)
They can't do anything to me.

63
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:09,700
Wu,

64
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:11,980
I know a few things.

65
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,740
I think we should meet.

66
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:17,510
Master,

67
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,340
you're at Zhang Ahua's place, right?

68
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:22,260
So it really is you.

69
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,820
I'll send you the address.

70
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:26,460
See you soon.

71
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:42,460
Master,

72
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:44,980
you lied to me.

73
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:46,900
I'm not your enemy.

74
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,460
I'm not your enemy.

75
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:51,580
You really lied to me.

76
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,220
Did you have that hacker trick me?

77
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:57,920
Yes.

78
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:59,960
Did Wang Jian really fake the autopsy report?

79
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:01,910
- No.
- Why lie to me?

80
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,060
Listen to this first.

81
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,540
Wu, I think I know

82
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,900
who's tipping off Wang Mingcheng.

83
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,540
I'm heading out to find evidence.

84
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,880
If anything happens to me,

85
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:19,010
remember, the clue is in 405.

86
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:20,740
These are my words.

87
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:22,340
You gave this to me.

88
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,060
It's completely real.

89
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,100
Our hometown dialect is complicated.

90
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,060
It's hard to fake.

91
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:28,340
I'm from your hometown,

92
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,500
and was your junior at school.

93
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,540
Only we at the station know the dialect.

94
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:40,500
What's inside 405?

95
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,620
After you lost your memory,

96
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:52,060
I checked everywhere
tied to 405 and you,

97
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,260
but found nothing at all.

98
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,500
Everything I did

99
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,500
was just for you
to get your memory back.

100
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:01,420
Master.

101
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,820
Let's find out the truth together

102
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:06,660
and expose the mole in the station.

103
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:13,900
You think Wang Jian did it?

104
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,060
Yeah.

105
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:16,820
It's just a guess, though.

106
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:20,140
Because he's the only one who dislikes you.

107
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,100
Think about it.

108
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,340
He locked you up

109
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,280
to prevent you from remembering anything.

110
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,180
What's he so afraid of?

111
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:27,580
Though,

112
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,860
I think there's nothing between Mr. An

113
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,140
and Ran.

114
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,220
But I can't prove that to you.

115
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,900
So I had to fake the autopsy report.

116
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:38,580
Just so you'd be more careful with him.

117
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,940
Believe it or not,

118
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:46,620
everything I've done

119
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,940
is to help you get your memory back.

120
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,060
All the answers

121
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,180
are in your memory.

122
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:04,420
Sorry.

123

There's a box of drinks for you.

Are you Chen Yasin?

That's me.

00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:22,920
- Here you go.
- Yeah.

Feel free to look around.

I'll just browse myself.

145
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,160
Yeah.

146
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,860
Ma'am, I'd like to try these two on.

147
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,180

Are you coming in?

154
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:06,820
Dr. Chen, you're always so clever.

Always got a solution.

Besides,

161
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:18,130
every police officer in the city is after me.

162
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:19,490
I had no other choice

163
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,930
and had to meet you like this.

164
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:22,920
Don't pay me back.

171
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,620
while I was working on a case.

172
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:53,900
It should be safe.
