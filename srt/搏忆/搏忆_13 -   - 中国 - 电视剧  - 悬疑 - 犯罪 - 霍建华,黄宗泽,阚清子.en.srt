11
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,480
This one.

12
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,000
Sir,

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,160
you didn't steal this, right?

14
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:55,840
I don't know anything.

15
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,000
It's fine.

16
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,320
Chief Wang.

17
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,140
I checked the street cameras.

18
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,480
No sign of him.

19
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,240
This is confiscated.

20
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,360
- Take it back.
- Yes.

21
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,240
He has great counter-surveillance skills.

22
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:13,880
Looks like we can't find him for now.

23
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,600
We have to keep looking.

24
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,600
Without him, how do we proceed the plan?

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,960
The plan?

26
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,040
Director, you're still hung up on it.

27
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,240
Our plan has already fallen apart.

28
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,720
We should be thinking about cleanup now.

29
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,760
Wang.

30
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,360
Keep your emotions in check.

31
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,600
I've got my own reasons.

32
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,760
How about this,

33
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,640
let's call in everyone involved.

34
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,440
We can talk it through.

35
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:07,880
What do you think?

36
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:13,460
(Suspected; Prison Guard: dead; Ahua: dead)

37
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,560
If he bolted from Chen Yasin's place,

38
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,520
it's a few hundred meters to the shop.

39
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,800
Why wasn't I informed?

40
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,760
Everyone,

41
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,360
so I'm out of the plan now?

42
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,240
Burning the bridge.

43
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,480
Songtai.

44
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,260
It's not the right way

45
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,120
to put it.

46
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:58,920
Back then,

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,560
we borrowed you from above

48
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,200
to have you pretend to be the dead Wu.

49
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,040
Now that your job is done.

50
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,440
Of course,

51
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,440
I'll report to them for your credit.

52
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,560
Now, go back to Headquarters.

53
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,520
Director Zhou.

54
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,400
Don't think I don't know

55
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,400
the plan has failed.

56
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,960
That means the truth isn't out yet.

57
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,280
You want me to leave now?

58
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,240
Could it be

59
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,280
you've got some other agenda?

60
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,200
Songtai!

61
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,440
Watch your tone!

62
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,440
Why did the plan fall apart?

63
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,280
You should know the reason.

64
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:43,880
Behind my back,

65
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,680
how many off-plan moves did you pull?

66
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,360
I know that too.

67
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,640
I'm giving you a way out.

68
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,280
Don't just linger.

69
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,840
You're not my subordinate,

70
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,600
but your rank's lower than mine.

71
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:58,640
Follow the order!

72
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,520
Songtai.

73
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,280
Alright.

74
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,480
I'll follow the order.

75
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,120
See Songtai off.

76
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,160
What do you mean?

77
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,750
It's not safe out there now.

78
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,320
They'll escort you.

79
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,840
Go.

80
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:36,130
I'll walk myself.

81
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,240
Your phone.

82
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,320
Why should I?

83
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,160
As Officer Wu,

84
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,380
anything tied to your work,

85
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,040
including your phone, must be handed in.

86
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:06,880
Tell Zhou,

87
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,160
forget it.

88
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,320
In his eyes,

89
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,240
we're all tainted.

90
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,080
Hand it over.

91
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,320
He won't reach out to me.

92
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,020
(Personal information)

93
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,200
Director Zhou,

94
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,080
given the situation,

95
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,080
I suggest issuing a wanted order.

96
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,160
Citywide search for Han Xu.

97
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,760
On what grounds?

98
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,220
You really want to claim

99
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,240
Han Xu killed An Shaocong and Xiao Ran?

100
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,040
The cause of their deaths

101
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,120
isn't exactly a secret.

102
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,640
But about the death of Zhang Ahua

103
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,720
and of the prison guard,

104
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,040
I believe Han Xu is a prime suspect.

105
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,880
That's nonsense.

106
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,040
As for Ahua's case,

107
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,400
he had no time to commit the crime.

108
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,920
If you issue a wanted order,

109
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,920
it'll be a clear wrongful case.

110
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,960
Mobilizing the public

111
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,880
at the city level

112
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,520
is the fastest way to find Han Xu.

113
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,000
Director Zhou,

114
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,240
it's a temporary fix.

115
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,080
I don't agree.

116
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,800
We're in a tough spot.

117
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,720
Don't make the situation worse.

118
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,560
If you hadn't

119
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,040
locked Han Xu up

120
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,680
without approval,

121
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,200
we should've had more choices.

122
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,920
This is my case, I'm in charge.

123
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,400
I decide if we lock him up or not.

124
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,240
Alright.

125
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,720
Enough arguing.

126
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,360
Sit down, please.

127
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,320
You two,

128
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,960
bickering like kids,

129
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,180
digging up old grudges.

130
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,080
What's the point?

131
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,200
We need to fix the problem at hand.

132
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,280
Ma,

133
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,130
issue a wanted notice.

134
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:23,980
- Yes.
- I reject it.

135
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:25,520
Li's already told me about your issues.

136
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,720
You've gone rogue more than once.

137
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,800
That's a fact.

138
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,840
Here's what we'll do.

139
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:32,880
Take two days off.

140
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,720
The rest of the case,

141
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,920
let Ma handle this.

142
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,760
Sir.

143
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,760
Follow the order.

144
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:06,300
(Reward wanted notice)

145
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,660
(Personal information: Han Xu)

146
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:12,460
(Wang Jian)

147
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:16,020
(Xiao Ran)

148
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:26,060
(Zhang Aniu)

149
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,280
If she can get through it,

150
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,360
I'll treat her like my own sister.

151
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:52,380
(Zhang Ahua)

152
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,080
Master,

153
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,320
you cleared my doubts the other day,

154
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,940
and the fog in my mind

155
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,200
faded a little.

156
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,760
Today I'm here

157
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,400
to ask for your help.

158
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,120
You left with results,

159
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,320
and came back with reason.

160
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,080
Very good.

161
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,640
Very good.

162
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,130
- Zhang Aniu.
- Yes.

163
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,600
Come with me.

164
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,960
To where?

165
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,040
Don't ask.

166
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,240
Get in.

167
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,120
Master.

168
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:28,960
Zhang Aniu.

169
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,640
Boss?

170
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:39,880
Wh-what are you doing here?

171
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:41,240
Wait,

172
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,200
you finally got out, why come back?

173
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,720
Left stuff behind?

174
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,360
You…

175
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,080
You became a monk?

176
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,160
Punch me once.

177
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,120
Huh?

178
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,440
What do you mean?

179
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,160
Don't tell me,

180
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,360
you spent the money I gave you.

181
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,520
That was meant for my sister.

182
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,320
I told you to punch me.

183
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,040
Come on.

184
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,520
What?

185
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,720
Why on earth would I hit you?

186
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,520
At least explain it to me.

187
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,280
Zhang Ahua is gone.

188
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:24,960
She died because of me.

189
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,400
I've known her for ages.

190
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:34,320
She's helped me so many times.

191
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:36,320
But this time,

192
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:38,760
she got dragged into my mess.

193
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,400
Someone shot her.

194
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,480
Look at me... Look at me!

195
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,200
You know,

196
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,240
Zhang Ahua was my only family.

197
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,240
Boss,

198
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,080
I'm begging you.

199
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,360
Get me out of here.

200
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,720
Tell me.

201
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,560
Who killed my sister?

202
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,480
I'll take them out myself.

203
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,400
I can't help you.

204
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,360
But I can promise you,

205
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,240
about her death,

206
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,080
you'll get the truth from me.

207
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,360
Boss,

208
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,200
I only had one sister.

209
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,720
Ahua…

210
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,480
Ahua…

211
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,480
I'll lay low for a few days.

212
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,640
Are you crazy?

213
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,720
Get the facts straight.

214
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,280
You're not my boss.

215
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:22,480
He posed as a prison guard to get in

216
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,840
and killed another guard in front of me.

217
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,080
He had a rough, raspy voice.

218
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,280
Got any leads?

219
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,720
Never seen the guy.

220
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,060
How good is he in a fight?

221
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,280
Impressive.

222
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,440
With guns and murder,

223
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,840
he's an expert.

224
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,760
So, going by what you said...

225
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,960
He could very well be a hitman.

226
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,000
Every boss in the game's got someone

227
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,720
to handle the dirty work.

228
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,320
But…

229
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,200
Something's off.

230
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,480
A Hitman…

231
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,800
Why would he know you so well?

232
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,840
Did you cross some big shot?

233
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,360
Got yourself a serious grudge?

234
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,680
What is it?

235
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,100
Got someone in your mind?

236
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,300
You seem to know me well.

237
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:18,360
My good son.

238
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,920
Why the rush to find me?

239
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,600
I've got a few guesses.

240
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,200
Come on, boss.

241
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,040
Take me with you.

242
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,000
How can you find them alone?

243
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,000
I used to be a cop.

244
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,760
Finding someone

245
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,600
isn't hard at all.

246
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,800
Back when Scar was around,

247
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,440
we split the goods by weight.

248
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,440
Now we only get this tiny amount.

249
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:49,600
It's pointless.

250
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,560
Exactly.

251
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,120
Things are really rough now.

252
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,600
Hey, big guy,

253
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,720
you've got the wrong person.

254
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,560
Do you know Scar?

255
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,880
That was ages ago, man.

256
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,760
If you want revenge, not on us.

257
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,600
Yeah.

258
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,480
I know far more than you think.

259
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,900
Otherwise, how could I have prepared

260
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:17,960
such a thoughtful gift?

261
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:19,800
Is this voice familiar?

262
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:21,600
No idea, sir.

263
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,560
Yeah, it's way too hard to tell.

264
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:24,600
Think carefully.

265
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:25,920
Ow! Bro, that hurts!

266
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,480
I know, I know!

267
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,480
I remember now!

268
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,680
One time back then,

269
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,400
I saw Scar talking to a guy.

270
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,000
That guy's voice was the same.

271
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,840
I remember Scar called him...

272
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,960
Paka.

273
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,360
Yes, that's it!

274
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,400
He fights illegal boxing
at South Ring.

275
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,400
I've placed bets for Scar a few times.

276
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,880
He's Scar's God of Wealth.

277
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,880
Wins every match.

278
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,840
Anyone else not afraid of risk?

279
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,160
I'll count to three.

280
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,120
Three.

281
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,080
Two.

282
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,680
One!

283
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,720
Bro, you'd better think this through.

284
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,360
I told you I'd find you

285
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,640
and I'd end you.
