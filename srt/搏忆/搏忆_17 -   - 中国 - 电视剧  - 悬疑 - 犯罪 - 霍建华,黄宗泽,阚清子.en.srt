11
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,520
Boss.

12
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,820
It's cleaned up outside.

13
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,560
Son, perfect timing.

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,840
Here.

15
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,760
See the elders off.

16
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,630
Mingcheng, it's not that serious.

17
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,860
Let's talk it over calmly.

18
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,840
Yeah, remember?

19
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,000
I helped

20
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:47,340
with your first deal back then.

21
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,280
Aren't you afraid I'll kill you first?

22
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,000
I trust you.

23
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,680
I can feel it.

24
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
We still have the bond.

25
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,240
Besides,

26
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,900
there are a lot of questions

27
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,720
that only I can answer.

28
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,600
The guys already checked the place.

29
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,720
This area has no cameras.

30
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,360
(612+(822)6537318)
Only a night market,

31
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,740
a supermarket, and a hotel nearby.

32
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,340
Easy to hide people and cars.

33
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,080
The rest are old, rundown homes.

34
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,120
We can rule them out.

35
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,840
What about Chief Ma's side?

36
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:11,610
What's going on?

37
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,860
They got the SWAT team involved.

38
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,880
They're sweeping, too.

39
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:14,830
I'd say

40
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,980
give it half an hour at most.

41
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,720
That'll keep us on schedule.

42
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:18,880
Alright.

43
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,840
Thanks for your work.

44
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,220
We're running out of time.

45
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,280
A supermarket,
a night market, and a hotel.

46
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,160
We can only pick one.

47
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,560
What do you think?

48
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,640
Take a bet?

49
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,880
I'm not lucky with bets.

50
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,280
Hotel.

51
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,000
Hotel?

52
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,720
You should remember 405.

53
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,400
Only the hotel links to 405.

54
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,320
If our guess is right

55
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,640
and Wang Mingcheng did it,

56
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,000
then the 405-related hotel

57
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,480
is our best shot.

58
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,400
If it's Wang Mingcheng,

59
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,720
someone will surely

60
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,880
tip him off.

61
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,560
We only have half an hour.

62
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,140
Tipping him off is a good thing.

63
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,560
I told you to kill them.

64
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,000
Not just scare them off.

65
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,560
Uncle Kun.

66
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,520
Huadu's biggest distributor.

67
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,440
Tila.

68
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,280
He owns a factory in Shahe.

69
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,400
The two of them,

70
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,160
plus the late Uncle Tai,

71
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,800
control 75%

72
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,800
of the supply chain in the market.

73
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,560
And you?

74
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,720
Your base got raided by the cops.

75
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,800
So, you're in a tough spot now.

76
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,400
If they're gone,

77
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,440
who'll handle your distribution?

78
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,080
Your goal isn't to kill them.

79
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,860
It's to intimidate them.

80
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,800
Right?

81
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,320
Why do you know all this so well?

82
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,440
Don't forget:

83
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,800
Two months ago,

84
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,440
I was the Chief of the Narcotics Unit,

85
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,600
and my mission

86
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,040
was to take you all down.

87
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,320
I was going to make an example

88
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,740
to scare the rest of you,

89
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,800
but keeping two of you works, too.

90
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,360
Gentlemen.

91
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:21,920
Did you hear that?

92
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,080
My son decided to spare your lives.

93
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,720
Let's go over the rules again.

94
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:28,880
You talk it through.

95
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,800
I'm worn out.

96
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,800
Why are you two so late?

97
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,640
Hurry.

98
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:41,800
Sorry, I had a stomach issue.

99
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,840
Hurry up.

100
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,400
Young Master, your room's on the right.

101
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,520
If you want to live,

102
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,720
keep quiet.

103
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,440
This time,

104
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,080
you'd better be right.

105
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,240
Don't worry. I have a feeling:

106
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,080
As long as Han Xu's life holds strong,

107
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,040
we won't lose.

108
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,520
Then let's settle it happily like this.

109
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,900
The cops are almost here.

110
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,280
I won't keep you two any longer.

111
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,240
When you leave,

112
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,200
don't forget
to take this gentleman with you.

113
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,760
Got it.

114
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,440
- Master.
- Han Xu.

115
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,840
Why are you two together?

116
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,840
We're here to save you. Come with me.

117
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,680
How?

118
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,220
By giving me one more shot?

119
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,320
This is 405, right?

120
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:53,390
Did you find anything?

121
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,760
You don't deserve to know.

122
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,600
Don't get in the way.

123
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,880
I know you're confused right now.

124
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,240
But this isn't the time to explain.

125
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,160
Just come with me.

126
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,480
Tell everyone:

127
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,240
Pack up and leave in ten minutes.

128
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,320
Keep an eye on that guy.

129
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:06,960
Sure.

130
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,400
Why are you here?

131
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,560
Didn't you say

132
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,500
I should treat this place like my home?

133
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,660
Do I need to check in
to enter my own place?

134
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,080
I'm disappointed.

135
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,640
I'm actually curious to know

136
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,160
what's written there.

137
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,120
Young Master.

138
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,500
That was a bit reckless of you.

139
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,160
The Boss is not too pleased.

140
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,360
Just go along with him later.

141
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,720
We were supposed to go save him.

142
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,800
But he ended up saving us.

143
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,200
How do we explain this to Doctor Chen?

144
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,820
Look on the bright side.

145
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,000
At least he's still alive,

146
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,340
and he still values our bond.

147
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,800
This time,

148
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,600
we really let him down.

149
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,280
And we came back empty-handed.

150
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,480
Well, not entirely.

151
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,680
Boss.

152
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,040
Want to take a look?

153
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,180
I'm not mad because you want to see it.

154
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,880
I'm mad because you act sneakily.

155
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,520
This was yours to begin with.

156
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,400
Are you saying

157
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,040
this is me?

158
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,360
Think about it carefully.

159
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,600
Let me jog your memory.

160
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,240
Your name's not Han Xu.

161
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,780
You take my family name.

162
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:03,920
You're Wang Yu.

163
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,640
When I first met you,

164
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,880
I almost killed you.

165
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,720
He's dying. He's useless.

166
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,120
Boss, wait.

167
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,360
The dead are still useful.

168
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:28,640
We can cut him open

169
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,200
and put it right in.

170
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:37,920
Little rascal.

171
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:38,960
I'll finish you!

172
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,640
Little punk.

173
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,400
Full of schemes.

174
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,440
Just like me.

175
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,600
Stick with me from now on.

176
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,800
I'm Wang Mingcheng.
