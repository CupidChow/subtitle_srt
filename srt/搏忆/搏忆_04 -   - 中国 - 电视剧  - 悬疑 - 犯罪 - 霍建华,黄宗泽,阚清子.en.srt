11
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,340
You sure found a great spot

12
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:58,520
to spy on the Police Station.

13
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:00,960
You're wrong.

14
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,640
I wasn't the one who found it.

15
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:06,720
It was you.

16
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,520
Me?

17
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,080
(Two months ago)
Isn't this dump

18
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,000
about to be torn down?

19
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,120
The order's out.

20
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,380
It'll be gone by year-end.

21
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,280
By year-end?

22
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:27,920
By then...

23
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:29,760
we can meet across the street,

24
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,200
no more sneaking around

25
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,200
like little mice.

26
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,160
The way you look,

27
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,660
at most, just like Mickey Mouse.

28
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,000
Anyway,

29
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,160
keep it steady.

30
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,360
The celebration is ready.

31
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,760
Okay.

32
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,800
Chief, quick update for you.

33
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,560
Next Friday,

34
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:45,980
Wang Mingcheng will ship a load.

35
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,920
A big one.

36
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,200
The source says he'll watch it.

37
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,320
Should we move in?

38
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,680
Can we trust him?

39
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,840
Very trustworthy.

40
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:53,960
He's currently

41
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,320
the only core insider

42
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,400
I could reach.

43
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,640
Alright, let me think.

44
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:00,960
Follow my lead.

45
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:02,800
Got it.

46
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,760
Master.

47
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:05,900
Master.

48
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,760
I remember now.

49
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,280
I saw Mr. An here once.

50
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,400
Really?

51
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:11,880
That's great news.

52
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,640
Didn't expect Doctor Chen to be the lead.

53
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,000
We're getting closer to the truth.

54
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,320
If we want the truth,

55
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,640
we need to get the original video file.

56
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,480
No way.

57
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,720
It's way too risky.

58
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,080
The whole city is after you.

59
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,240
I know.

60
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,240
But I might have an idea.

61
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,400
Master!

62
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,400
The decrypted video.

63
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,360
You can't get away!

64
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:24,900
(INTRUDER)

65
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,200
Open the door.

66
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,520
Chief Han,

67
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,680
whatever this is about,

68
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,040
it's definitely not me.

69
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,820
Haven't done this in ages.

70
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,600
I need your help.

71
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,480
Chief Han,

72
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,160
what's going on?

73
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,280
You still need me?

74
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,400
Chief Han,

75
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,160
you're in deep now.

76
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,920
Destroying evidence is risky.

77
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,680
You'll have to pay more.

78
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,680
Don't talk nonsense.

79
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,240
How could that be me?

80
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,360
No way.

81
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,480
It is you.

82
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,320
You sure?

83
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,160
Absolutely sure.

84
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,600
Your face in the video

85
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,880
shows no signs of tampering.

86
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,400
And no one has the skills

87
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,640
that can get past my eyes.

88
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,600
Chief Han,

89
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,280
verification costs money too.

90
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,700
You don't want the USB?

91
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,680
Hold on.

92
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,320
There's something off in this clip.

93
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,680
Impressive.

94
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,320
Seriously, a real pro.

95
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,040
The timecode's been altered

96
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,440
and the edit marks were hidden.

97
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,920
Wow, that's some serious skill.

98
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,480
If you hadn't come to me,

99
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,160
you'd never spot the trick.

100
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,080
When do you think this was shot?

101
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,840
An Shaocong

102
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:40,360
was the undercover you placed
by Wang Mingcheng.

103
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,660
According to the autopsy report,

104
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:42,760
besides the fatal wound,

105
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,680
a sample was also taken from the body,

106
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,640
showing male DNA.

107
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,400
It matched Officer An Shaocong.

108
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,560
I saw the whole crime scene play out,

109
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,360
like I was actually part of it.

110
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:54,360
The report came from a temporary number.

111
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,080
He said his name was Han Xu.

112
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,800
You're a suspect now.

113
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,200
But you still have a choice.

114
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,640
(No foreign DNA.)
The original report

115
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,560
shows no trace of semen DNA.

116
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,760
Mr. An and Ran are likely innocent.

117
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,960
You, me, and Mr. An

118
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,680
were classmates at the police academy.

119
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,240
This whole thing was against you.

120
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,160
You know you're not allowed at the scene.

121
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,280
Have Wu go with you.

122
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,160
You can watch,

123
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,600
but don't break the rules.

124
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,600
If he could make it stick

125
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,440
that you killed Ran and Mr. An,

126
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,840
you'd be silenced forever.

127
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,800
No matter who's involved in this case,

128
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:28,840
I'll get to the bottom of it.

129
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,400
You're a perfect scapegoat.

130
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,640
My condolences.

131
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:34,480
So far, no signs of split personality.

132
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,960
About that brain scan,

133
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,800
I want to do it now.

134
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,720
Hold on, I'll set it up.

135
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:52,920
Thanks.

136
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,700
I know you've been in trouble,

137
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,560
so I kept it a secret. Don't worry.

138
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:15,920
Thanks.

139
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,360
So what's my situation now?

140
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,560
Your head indeed suffered serious trauma.

141
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,680
How long ago was this video taken?

142
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,040
Two months ago.

143
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,440
When exactly?

144
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,560
Two months back.
