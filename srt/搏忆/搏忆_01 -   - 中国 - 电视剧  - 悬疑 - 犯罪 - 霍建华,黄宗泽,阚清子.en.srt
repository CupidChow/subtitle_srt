00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:48,670
(In Huaguang City,)

12
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:49,730
(a new narcotic is found.)

13
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:50,630
(Wang Mingcheng)

14
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:51,390
(is the culprit.)

15
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:52,600
(Two months ago, Han Xu failed)

16
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,680
(to arrest Wang Mingcheng.)

17
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,070
(He was injured and vowed to bring)

18
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:56,380
(Wang Mingcheng to justice.)

19
00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:00,820
(Huaguang City border,
Meilanna Federation)

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,940
What are you doing here?

21
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:11,500
(Xiao Ran)

22
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,120
Sorry.

23
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,270
The number you dialed...

24
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:18,580
(An Shaocong)

25
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:22,740
Sorry.

26
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,700
The number you dialed
is unavailable now.

27
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,400
Chief, we're sure he's inside.

28
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,360
Let's go.

29
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,940
Do you know him? Is he inside?

30
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:45,910
Yeah, I know him.

31
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,860
I'm just the doorman.

32
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:47,720
I don't know anything.

33
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,560
Take him away.

34
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:53,100
(Drug Manufacturing Plant)

35
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,040
You two, with me.

36
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,500
Everyone else, on guard.

37
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:09,980
Who are you?

38
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,440
Are you out of your mind?

39
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,680
Police.

40
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:14,620
Do you know Wang Mingcheng?

41
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,090
I've been looking for him.

42
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:21,920
Police?

43
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,040
So what?

44
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,320
Take him down for me.

45
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:04,920
Talk.

46
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,040
Sir.

47
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,040
I honestly haven't seen
Wang Mingcheng in ages.

48
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,540
You're lying to me, aren't you?

49
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,360
I'm not lying. I swear on my life.

50
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,200
I haven't seen him in a long time.

51
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,040
Master.

52
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,360
Master.

53
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,840
Master.

54
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,200
Master.

55
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,080
Master.

56
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,880
Who are you?

57
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,520
Who?

58
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,480
Me?

59
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,760
Your student, Wu.

60
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,120
Two days apart, and you forgot me?

61
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,400
Wu?

62
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,380
Shaved off your beard, huh?

63
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,520
You look a lot younger.

64
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,420
Let's get to business.

65
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,120
Come back to the station with me.

66
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:51,360
Director Zhou and Chief Wang
want to see you.

67
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,100
What's going on?

68
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,100
We'll talk in the car.

69
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,120
Take him with us.

70
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,320
Move.

71
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,000
What happened?

72
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,120
I can't say.

73
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,600
Let's just say
things aren't looking good.

74
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,280
You should be prepared.

75
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,120
Someone died?

76
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,760
Yeah.

77
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,640
Director Zhou.

78
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,600
Chief Wang.

79
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,760
Looking for me?

80
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,520
Who are they?

81
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,360
They're colleagues sent by higher-ups

82
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,960
to assist with the case.

83
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,360
Oh.

84
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,360
What kind of case is it?

85
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,300
Seems like a big deal.

86
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:00,380
A murder happened
in the city last night.

87
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:02,480
The victim was your colleague,

88
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,040
An Shaocong.

89
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,600
When did it happen?

90
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,720
The forensic report says

91
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,520
it happened
between 1 and 3 a.m. last night.

92
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,360
Right in the middle of the storm.

93
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,640
An Shaocong

94
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:17,920
was the one you sent

95
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,400
undercover near Wang Mingcheng.

96
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,700
After Wang Mingcheng escaped,

97
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,120
his cover was blown.

98
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,960
We suspect Wang Mingcheng
was retaliating.

99
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,320
Director Zhou,

100
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,040
I'd like to join the task force.

101
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,360
- No way.
- Why not?

102
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,680
I used to be a detective, too.

103
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:35,880
Your wife is gone.

104
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,040
What did you say?

105
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,750
Your wife, Xiao Ran,

106
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,160
was also found dead at the scene.

107
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:26,840
How could this happen?

108
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Who did it?

109
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,440
My wife's abroad.

110
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,440
That's impossible.

111
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,920
They must have made a mistake.

112
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,600
I'm going there. I'll check myself.

113
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,560
Han Xu.

114
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,000
Han Xu, calm down and listen to me.

115
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,920
I get how you feel.

116
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,400
But you're in charge
of Wang Mingcheng's case,

117
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,920
and you're also the victim's family.

118
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,980
You can't go to the scene.

119
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:45,900
You know that.

120
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,440
My condolences.

121
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,680
You can't stop me.

122
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,680
- Han Xu.
- Let go.

123
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,760
- Han Xu.
- Let go.

124
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,040
- Han Xu.
- Let go.

125
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:54,710
Don't move.

126
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,120
Let him go.

127
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,200
Have Wu go with you.

128
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,640
You can watch.

129
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,920
But stay within the rules.

130
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,460
What are you doing here?

131
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,640
Master.

132
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,040
I just saw the whole crime happen.

133
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,920
Like I was right there in it.

134
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,520
Don't say things like that.

135
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,600
I know it's not scientific.

136
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,120
But it really happened.

137
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:31,880
Master.

138
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,840
There's something I've held back.

139
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,760
Could it be that Mr. An and Ran

140
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,120
hit you too hard?

141
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,560
Don't report

142
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,640
what happened today.

143
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,560
Alright.

144
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,720
The crime scene is so hidden.

145
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,800
Who called it in?

146
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,480
The caller might be the suspect.

147
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,640
I can't say.

148
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,200
Tell me.

149
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,440
It was from a temporary number.

150
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,040
He said

151
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,530
his name was Han Xu.

152
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,560
You're saying I'm the one who called?

153
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,000
But there's no proof

154
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,240
that you've been to the scene.

155
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,480
- So...
- So what?

156
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,760
So everyone thinks I'm the killer?

157
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,600
I believe you.

158
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,120
Someone's clearly setting you up.

159
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:56,320
What about the voice?

160
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,720
Did you compare it yet?

161
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,960
The results aren't back yet.

162
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,080
No wonder.

163
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,760
Any other leads?

164
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,400
We found a hidden camera at the scene.

165
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,240
The footage is encrypted.

166
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,280
We're still decoding it.

167
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,920
You go back to the station.

168
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,120
I need to go back home.

169
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,320
Remember.

170
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,280
Do not report

171
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,200
anything that happened today.

172
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,560
Got it.

173
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,240
Chief Wang.

174
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,560
It's Wu.

175
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,640
