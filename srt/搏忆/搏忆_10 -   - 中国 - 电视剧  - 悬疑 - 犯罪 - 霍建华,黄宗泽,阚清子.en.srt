11
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:49,280
Come on.

12
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,600
Try our coffee.

13
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,240
No way I'd drink CIU coffee.

14
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,640
I added sugar for you.

15
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,720
It's way too sweet.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,120
You still complain?

17
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,270
- Hey.
- What?

18
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:17,780
What are you waiting for?

19
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:20,400
Waiting for approval, the usual process.

20
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,980
Don't you have any questions for me?

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,980
All the evidence is here.

22
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,220
What else do I need to ask?

23
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,080
Alright.

24
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,660
Let me ask you something.

25
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,280
What is it?

26
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:40,440
Just a small question.

27
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,360
But I want you to be honest.

28
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:46,400
Okay.

29
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,360
Go ahead.

30
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:49,400
I'll tell you what I can.

31
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,880
That car crash last time,
when you caught me,

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,180
what happened to the driver?

33
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:01,920
I knew you'd bring it up.

34
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,960
Here, see for yourself.

35
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,180
(Details: multiple bruises found)

36
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,480
Died in an accident?

37
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,040
He was killed fast.

38
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,680
Still worried about others?

39
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,560
Maybe look out for yourself.

40
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,200
Don't try to fool me.

41
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:21,120
He died

42
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,000
because of us.

43
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,640
That's one thing.

44
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,240
Alright.

45
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,420
So what is it?

46
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,760
Go on, tell me.

47
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,560
Wang,

48
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,920
since I moved to the Narcotics Unit,

49
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,200
we haven't worked together

50
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:43,420
for seven or eight years now.

51
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:45,320
Why are you guys

52
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,560
in the CIU so divided?

53
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,000
You're desperate to catch me,

54
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,600
while Wu is trying to help me run.

55
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,600
Now, even more lives
are dragged into this.

56
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,480
Tell me.

57
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,680
What kind of plan

58
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,720
are you working on?

59
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:55,810
Anything to do with me?

60
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,320
If yes, just tell me straight up.

61
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,680
There was never a plan.

62
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,400
Didn't I tell you? It was an accident.

63
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,720
I know you can see through this.

64
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,740
This wasn't an accident.

65
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,500
He hit you like that to take you out.

66
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,000
Here's what I think.

67
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,920
The person after you

68
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,540
must be inside the station.

69
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,800
Am I right?

70
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,720
Come on, Han.

71
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,420
That's kind of basic.

72
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:29,780
Trying to sow discord?

73
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,300
Listen.

74
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,060
We're pretty united inside.

75
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,060
Sure, if you say so.

76
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:40,820
Keep lying to yourself, then.

77
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,460
All these years,

78
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,540
your lying skills haven't improved.

79
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:48,740
Say whatever you want.

80
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,500
The fact is

81
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,300
that you're facing murder charges.

82
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:53,620
As for me,

83
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,100
I caught you.

84
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:59,220
Alright.

85
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,660
Let me ask you one last thing.

86
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,180
This time, you got me.

87
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,620
Did Chen Yasin help you?

88
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:26,450
Chief Wang, it's ready.

89
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:36,780
Transfer Han Xu

90
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:39,340
to the southern prison for trial now.

91
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,340
Chief Wang.

92
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,880
There's been a homicide in the south.

93
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,660
Director Zhou asked you to check it out.

94
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,060
I'll escort this suspect.

95
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,060
Okay.

96
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,900
- Go tell Director Zhou
- Chief Wang.

97
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,860
I'll head over
once I've dropped him off.

98
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:01,860
It won't take long.

99
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:03,460
Chief Wang.

100
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:05,860
I'll report it as it is.

101
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:14,580
(South Transitional Prison)

102
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:20,100
(Police)

103
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:20,940
Is everything ready?

104
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,120
Chief Wang, don't worry.

105
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,160
We'll handle it specially.

106
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,460
Procedures have been explained.

107
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,340
Thanks for your help.

108
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,340
Looks like I guessed right.

109
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,080
Stay put for now.

110
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,660
- Don't give me another chance.
- You

111
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,180
haven't answered my last question.

112
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,400
Take your time and guess.

113
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,180
There's plenty of time.

114
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,140
Move.

115
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:04,540
Hurry up.

116
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:08,260
Jacket off.

117
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:12,580
That too, off.

118
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:14,900
Faster.

119
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:03,820
Hey, newcomer.

120
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,380
Don't you know the rules?

121
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:09,780
I'm talking to you.

122
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:11,620
Are you deaf?

123
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:15,060
If he won't come over,

124
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,420
can't you just invite him?

125
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:18,900
Useless.

126
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,140
Not bad.

127
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:40,260
Listen.

128
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,540
I've been in a bad mood lately.

129
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,120
- Fine.
- Don't mess with me.

130
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,500
Let's stay out of each other's way.

131
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,060
- Sure.
- Got it?

132
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:49,500
What are you doing?

133
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,180
Get down.

134
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,540
Newcomer causing trouble?

135
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:55,700
How dare you?

136
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:57,540
Go to the Disciplinary Room.

137
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:04,780
This time, you got me.

138
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,980
Did Chen Yasin help you?

139
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:08,580
I know this is all really tough,

140
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,100
but you have to trust yourself.

141
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,140
Stay here.

142
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,640
Don't stir things up again.

143
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,300
From now on,

144
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,220
you're the boss of Room 4.

145
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:24,820
Take all this stuff away.

146
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:31,980
Don't judge me by my looks.

147
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:33,500
Listen.

148
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,460
I've got connections here.

149
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,500
If you ever need anything,

150
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:39,500
just let me know.

151
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,100
Cigarettes, wine,

152
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:44,700
or a girl to keep you company...

153
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,080
All of that can be arranged.

154
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,300
Let me know if you need anything.

155
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:52,340
My buddies and I

156
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,520
are with you from now on.

157
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,180
Can you help me get a phone?

158
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:05,500
A phone?

159
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:06,540
Yeah.

160
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,260
A phone's easier than a girl.

161
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:10,780
You'll get it.

162
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,220
(Calling Wu)

163
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,500
This is Han Xu.

164
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:03,740
How do you prove it?

165
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:09,060
The clue is in 405.

166
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,060
Where are you?

167
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:13,060
I found a clue in 405.

168
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,220
What did you find?

169
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:15,980
I can't talk about it now.

170
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,300
How about we meet up?

171
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,300
Eight tonight at the usual place.

172
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,140
Alright.

173
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,540
I might need the phone for a bit longer.

174
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:53,660
No need to say that.

175
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:55,700
It's yours now.

176
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:57,900
Use it however you want.

177
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,420
I need

178
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:02,620
one more favor.

179
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,140
Go ahead.

180
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,020
I need to leave.

181
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:08,600
Make some noise for me.

182
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,420
What?

183
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:15,380
Is it tricky?

184
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:17,660
Not really,

185
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:19,500
but I...

186
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:23,620
Sir,

187
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,300
I also need

188
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:28,740
a favor from you.

189
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,340
Go ahead.

190
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,300
I'll get it done.

191
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,020
Sir,

192
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,220
from the first time I saw you,

193
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:31,660
I knew you were loyal.

194
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,540
I'll hear the verdict in a few days.

195
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,540
My sister's address is on this.

196
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:40,540
I've saved money for her.

197
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,700
I'm most worried about my sister.

198
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,540
She's really naive.

199
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,820
I'm afraid she'll get scammed.

200
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,300
You keep the money.

201
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:53,980
Please.

202
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,020
Take care of my sister for me.

203
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,260
Can you do that?

204
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,380
If I can get through this,

205
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:11,940
I'll treat her like my own sister.

206
