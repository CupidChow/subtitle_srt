11
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,080
Listen to this.

12
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,880
Only the dead pose no threat.

13
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,080
If you make the right choice,

14
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,800
everything will come to light.

15
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,520
Take some time

16
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,060
to think things over in this room.

17
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,440
If you choose wrong,

18
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,160
there's no turning back.

19
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,880
I only care about the evidence.

20
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,120
You think Wang Jian did this?

21
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,680
He's the only one strongly against you.

22
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,200
We need to find out the truth now.

23
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,840
Everything I've done was to protect him.

24
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,600
Sticking to the original plan

25
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,920
is the best way to keep him safe.

26
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,720
He's fragile and very important now.

27
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:41,880
No matter who it is,

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,200
no one can get in the way.

29
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,560
What if I don't agree?

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,880
Whoever you are,

31
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:00,960
I'm busy right now.

32
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,320
Let's talk about this tomorrow.

33
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:11,600
Chief Wang.

34
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,040
You can disagree.

35
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,320
Let's see what you've got.

36
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,380
I've spent enough time talking here.

37
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,220
I'm taking my daughter home.

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,860
Alright then.

39
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,160
By the rules, I can't stop you.

40
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:26,800
But you were just kidnapped.

41
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,280
I'm worried about your safety.

42
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,520
So, I'll have someone protect you
around the clock.

43
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,420
Please cooperate with us.

44
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,120
Don't give them any chances.

45
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,840
Doctor Chen,

46
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,120
I need to be clear with you up front.

47
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,240
I have two colleagues

48
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,520
getting disciplined
because you didn't cooperate.

49
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,400
We're not like them.

50
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,280
You won't get another chance.

51
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,320
Please do your part as a citizen

52
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,840
and work with the police on this.

53
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,280
As long as Han Xu shows up,

54
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,300
we won't chase your matter further.

55
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,880
Doctor Chen, I need a direct answer.

56
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,720
Keep your voice down.

57
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,520
My daughter is sleeping.

58
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,740
Chief Han.

59
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,640
Take a look.

60
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,620
Everything's under my control...

61
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:20,460
No.

62
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,540
It's all under your control.

63
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,120
That thing you mentioned.

64
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,340
Is it really that mysterious?

65
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,880
Of course. What do you want to do?

66
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,040
I'll give you a special deal.

67
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:32,780
Don't hang up yet.

68
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,420
Extract the sounds from inside.

69
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,050
Doctor Chen,

70
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:41,500
I need a direct answer.

71
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:48,220
Come on, Nuo.

72
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:49,420
Head in first.

73
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:54,900
What do you mean?

74
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,500
You want to come in?

75
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,340
Special cases need special measures.

76
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:00,280
We need to set up some things
at your place.

77
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,300
We'll just work in the living room.

78
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:03,220
We'll be respectful.

79
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,340
If you were, you wouldn't come in.

80
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:10,980
(Sound Synthesis)

81
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,100
Done.

82
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:17,300
Say something to test it out.

83
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:21,460
Hello.

84
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:22,580
Hey.

85
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:23,620
You...

86
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,020
You're good at this.

87
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,280
Hold on, one more to go.

88
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:28,620
And here's this one.

89
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,220
Hello.

90
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,180
Hey.

91
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:32,780
How do I use this?

92
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:35,780
I recorded both of their audio tracks.

93
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:37,580
The left one talks nonstop.

94
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:38,820
He's that super chatty officer.

95
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,660
The right one's the driver.

96
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:46,380
Thanks.

97
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,220
No problem, that's what friends do.

98
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:54,740
I'm almost there.

99
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,100
How's it going on your end?

100
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,300
Don't worry.

101
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,700
Stick to the plan.

102
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:00,780
Got it.

103
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:04,520
All teams, stay alert.

104
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,640
Han Xu just showed up.

105
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,540
He's heading to Doctor Chen's place.

106
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:08,860
Naicai, Bagong, you're up.

107
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:12,420
Chief Wang, any instructions?

108
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:15,820
Chief Wang, any instructions?

109
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:17,980
No response when we need it.

110
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,200
It should've been replaced.

111
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,180
The target is here. What to do?

112
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:23,680
There's just the two of us.

113
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,680
We'd better be careful.

114
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:26,480
I'll wait for him outside.

115
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:27,420
You stay inside.

116
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:29,300
Can you handle it?

117
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,340
Wait for my signal.

118
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,740
Naicai, what's your status?

119
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:14,300
Naicai, did you catch him?

120
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,660
We got him. Open the door!

121
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:19,060
Doctor Chen.

122
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,260
Please stay here.

123
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,100
What's going on now?

124
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,180
Hurry up and open the door.

125
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,260
You don't even recognize my voice?

126
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:49,460
Doctor Chen.

127
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:50,580
I'm sorry.

128
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,890
I dragged you into this.

129
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,680
How did you pull that off?

130
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,660
Just a simple trick.

131
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,300
Why did you have to go out?

132
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,780
Wouldn't it be safer to stay inside?

133
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:15,860
We've known each other for years,

134
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,400
and you couldn't tell that wasn't me?

135
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:18,150
Why open the door?

136
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:19,920
I opened it because I recognized
your voice.

137
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,380
Alright.

138
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,780
So this is all my fault, huh?

139
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,020
What about you?

140
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,660
Telling everyone
you're a Muay Thai expert,

141
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,020
and acting all high and mighty,

142
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:29,150
but after a minute outside,

143
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,820
you got knocked down and blamed me?

144
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,460
How many moves did you last?

145
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,460
I let my guard down.

146
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:35,660
I wasn't ready for it.

147
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:36,500
Alright, enough.

148
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:37,580
So what do we do now?

149
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:40,540
What else?

150
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:41,620
Just wait.

151
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:43,760
Here, have some water.

152
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:49,380
Doctor Chen,

153
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:51,980
can I really trust you?

154
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:53,580
Of course.

155
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:57,780
Even if

156
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,060
I'm actually a drug dealer?

157
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,500
Did something just come to you?

158
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,220
Memories about Wang Mingcheng

159
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,380
just started to resurface.

160
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:15,620
They tell me

161
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,340
he's my sworn father.

162
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:20,940
Can you tell me

163
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:23,180
what that means?

164
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:31,420
You think you're

165
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:33,160
Wang Mingcheng's undercover
at the station?

166
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,140
I don't know.

167
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,860
I get that all this sounds insane,

168
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:43,340
but these memories are real to me.

169
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,740
I just can't deal with them at all.

170
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:50,180
If I really was a drug dealer,

171
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,420
how many innocent people

172
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,860
lost everything because of me?

173
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,940
How many colleagues died because of me?

174
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:01,980
I know this is all really tough,

175
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:06,870
but you have to trust yourself.

176
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,920
Xu, come with me.

177
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,120
I've got a surprise for you.

178
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:12,720
Xu,

179
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:14,300
I've been saving this money in secret.

180
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,940
It should be enough for us to get by.

181
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,200
When are we getting out of here?

182
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,030
Xu!

183
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:22,000
I'm planning to deal with Xiao Ran.

184
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,090
She might be working with the police.

185
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:34,900
I have to go now.

186
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:36,700
I'll be waiting for you here.

187
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:51,860
This time,

188
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:53,620
I won't let you get away again.

189
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:08,140
