=Episode 16=

11
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:51,880
My good son,

12
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,000
you're finally back.

13
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,480
Wang Mingcheng.

14
00:00:58,390 --> 00:00:59,320
Watch your mouth.

15
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,480
Call me Dad.

16
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:01,600
Are you crazy?

17
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,680
I'm a cop and hunted you for 7 years,

18
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:05,280
and you want me to call you Dad?

19
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,600
You see me as your son

20
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,780
just to take advantage.

21
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,160
It's normal you can't figure it out now.

22
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,640
I'll explain it to you in a bit.

23
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,480
Why is he still tied up?

24
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:17,880
Hurry, untie him.

25
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,440
Boss,

26
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,520
Young Master hasn't been stable lately.

27
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,600
He might hurt you.

28
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:23,760
Nonsense.

29
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:24,920
Untie him now.

30
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,240
He's right.

31
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,760
I really am a killer.

32
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,480
I killed your man

33
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,280
and I wouldn't mind

34
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,840
taking your life too.

35
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:43,880
You understand?

36
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,200
You

37
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,600
are still just like before.

38
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:48,880
Still so hot-headed.

39
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:50,720
Come on, sit down.

40
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,760
Here, take a seat.

41
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,680
Come on.

42
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:53,960
Sit down.

43
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,520
You can go now.

44
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,000
- Boss.
- It's fine, go.

45
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,040
Since you can't recall,

46
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,200
I'll tell you the whole truth.

47
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,760
Tonight at 11:08 PM,

48
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,120
these people got into two black sedans.

49
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,090
We preliminarily conclude

50
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:26,560
the one they carried was Han Xu.

51
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,440
After that, the two black sedans

52
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:31,360
drove from Fourth to Second Street.

53
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,160
This white car was driven by Chief Wang.

54
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:35,040
After Chief Wang passed them,

55
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,080
the two black sedans

56
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,680
headed into 11th Street,

57
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,320
and stopped outside
an abandoned factory.

58
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,030
Up until now,

59
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,400
the location of those cars

60
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,280
hasn't changed a bit.

61
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:45,680
Looks like it was abandoned.

62
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:48,560
But at exactly 11:47 PM,

63
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,240
an SUV left 21st Street.

64
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,560
That abandoned factory

65
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,120
happens to be right between

66
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,400
21st Street and 11th Street.

67
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,280
So we have reason to believe

68
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,360
Han Xu was moved into another car.

69
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,600
Where did that SUV end up?

70
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,560
In the end,

71
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,840
at 21st Street

72
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,440
and 17th Street's intersection.

73
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,120
But the cameras after that

74
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:11,560
were all broken.

75
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,200
Send me all possible locations.

76
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,600
I'll get a team on it now.

77
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,520
Alright.

78
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,160
Investigate?

79
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,400
Why wasn't I informed?

80
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,480
About this matter,

81
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,800
Director Zhou already gave the order.

82
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,690
This case has nothing to do with your unit.

83
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:35,680
Nothing to do with me?

84
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,960
One of my guys on the team

85
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,880
is dead.

86
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,520
Another in the hospital, badly hurt.

87
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,840
You tell me it's not my business?

88
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,880
That's Director Zhou's order.

89
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,500
If you've got a problem,

90
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,760
go talk to Director Zhou.

91
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,880
You're an outsider here.

92
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,880
Don't let me catch you slipping up.

93
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,160
Or I swear I'll...

94
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,920
Say one more word,

95
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,920
and I'll report you

96
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,560
for breaking the law and obstruction.

97
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,510
Stop staring.

98
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,360
Send it to me now.

99
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,720
Oh.

100
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,000
No matter whose fault...

101
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,400
This is all my fault.

102
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:26,960
I never should've sent you
to the police academy.

103
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:30,480
I thought having you inside

104
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,800
the police station

105
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,680
would make things easier for me.

106
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,040
Who knew you'd end up
losing your memory?

107
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,600
Only remembering you're a cop,

108
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,840
and forgetting I'm your father.

109
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,840
Look at the mess I've made.

110
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,560
I killed one of your guys.

111
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,280
I just wanted him to look out for you.

112
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,920
But turns out he was way too stubborn.

113
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,840
He cared more about boxing
than his life.

114
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,520
Guess it's lucky you took him out.

115
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,320
Otherwise, we wouldn't even meet now.

116
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,360
Seems you know what the police've done to me

117
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,000
even better than I do.

118
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,640
Tell me,

119
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,990
who's your man inside the station?

120
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,600
There's no one left now.

121
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:22,680
I can't cut it.

122
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,640
Can you?

123
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,680
Other matters,

124
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:31,960
let's skip for now.

125
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,640
Get some rest first.

126
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,800
When the time comes

127
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,240
and you remember me

128
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,640
as your father,

129
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,200
we'll talk then.

130
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,840
Why the rush to find me?

131
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,080
I've done it all.

132
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,800
Where is it? Give it to me.

133
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,000
This,

134
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,880
you got it for me.

135
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,680
I really can't recall.

136
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:52,240
It's alright.

137
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:53,100
Speak.

138
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:53,960
Boss,

139
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:54,920
I've checked

140
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,280
the news you wanted.

141
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,320
- Boss, look.
- Where?

142
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,000
Right where the black sedans vanished.

143
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,120
It's in this area.

144
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,240
Are you sure?

145
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,120
That useless Ma.

146
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,040
How can he compare to our CIU?

147
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,070
Stop staring, send it to me.

148
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,300
(Route Log)

149
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,480
I know the city's surveillance inside out.

150
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,640
So relax.

151
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,800
Our brothers

152
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,040
will check the place out

153
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:21,960
before them.

154
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,440
This time,

155
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,080
it's my fault for dragging you in.

156
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,080
Naicai and Bagong

157
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,880
went through life and death with us.

158
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,200
We're all holding back our anger.

159
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,660
We want to avenge them.

160
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,400
You should head back.

161
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,360
Leave it to me.

162
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,320
Alright.

163
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,080
This guy…

164
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,400
Can we trust him?

165
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,920
He keeps things tight, relax.

166
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,160
Let's go.

167
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,000
Young Master, you'll stay here tonight.

168
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,080
Some friends from the circle
will drop by.

169
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,920
Boss Cheng got you new clothes.

170
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,000
Go change into them.

171
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,960
Boss Cheng

172
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,280
wants you in too.

173
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,160
I'll head out now.

174
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,560
You two, keep an eye on him.

175
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,560
Yes.

176
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Listen to this first.

177
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:41,400
Remember, the clue's in Room 405.

178
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,980
(Chen Yasin)

179
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,640
Hey.

180
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:08,880
How's it going?

181
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,560
We've locked down the main address.

182
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,200
Songtai and I are on our way.

183
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,560
Can you two handle it?

184
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,560
I picked the safe house.

185
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,080
I'll take charge of this.

186
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,600
Naicai and Bagong both got into trouble.

187
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,800
I don't want to drag in more brothers.

188
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:25,920
What do you need me to do?

189
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:27,880
Nothing for now.

190
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:29,600
Just stay put.

191
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:31,880
Wait till I bring Han Xu back.

192
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,040
Promise me.

193
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,320
Bring him back safe.

194
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,100
I promise.

195
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,060
Gotta go.

196
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:52,900
Without you saying,

197
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,980
I thought you two were a couple.

198
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:00,340
Are all Inspection Unit folks this nosy?

199
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,540
I'm trying to lighten the mood.

200
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,500
I can't wait any longer.

201
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,100
Since you can't handle this,

202
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,380
I'll deal with it myself.

203
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,180
I have my own ways.

204
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:19,780
You don't need to worry about that.

205
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,220
This time,

206
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,500
I must get what's in his mind.

207
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:32,460
Yes.

208
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,460
He's not my son,

209
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,020
but he doesn't remember either.

210
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,940
Enough, stop wasting time.

211
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,140
Your people can't take him anyway.

212
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,460
Even if I leave, I'll take him with me.

213
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,100
And also,

214
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,980
mind your tone when you speak.

215
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:00,460
Sorry, I'm late.

216
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:03,510
Sorry.

217
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:07,700
Why don't you eat?

218
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:08,740
Not to your taste?

219
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:10,940
Mingcheng,

220
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,580
don't give me that cheeky grin.

221
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:15,600
We came here today

222
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,340
for something important to discuss.

223
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,570
- What's that?
- Playing dumb, huh?

224
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:22,940
Don't pretend with me.

225
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:24,940
Two months ago,

226
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,500
you got hold of a top batch.

227
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,570
You told us

228
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:29,960
you could make plenty more.

229
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,060
We believed you.

230
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,940
Gave you fifty million.

231
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:34,340
It's been two months.

232
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:35,660
Where's the product?

233
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:38,420
And now you're wanted by the police.

234
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:39,700
Been hiding till now.

235
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:41,240
Thought you switched lines,

236
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,100
quit the drug trade

237
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:43,740
and turned to scams.

238
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:53,830
You three started long before me.

239
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:55,620
You're all my seniors.

240
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:04,500
Let me first apologize to you three.

241
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:09,980
Yeah, that's right.

242
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:11,820
Some time ago,

243
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:13,620
I did run into a bit of trouble.

244
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:15,380
But things are fine.

245
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,500
My son's back.

246
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:18,820
With him here,

247
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,420
we can roll out the new goods fast.

248
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,100
And

249
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,160
as a way to make it up,

250
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,260
I'll cut 10%.

251
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,220
10%?

252
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:28,990
Take care of someone for you.

253
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:32,820
Let me tell you,

254
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,610
we came here today

255
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,420
to lay down new rules for you.

256
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,180
What rules?

257
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:41,660
Let our people

258
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:42,740
move goods in your turf.

259
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:43,740
Also,

260
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:45,740
you have to hand us the recipe.

261
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,340
Then we're even.

262
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,740
What if I say no?

263
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,220
If you say no,

264
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,140
your goods

265
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,660
won't sell a single piece.

266
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,540
Keep them to make noodles yourself.

267
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,060
Looks like

268
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,100
you already

269
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,860
set the rules for me.

270
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:18,780
