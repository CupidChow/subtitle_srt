11
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:51,900
Place your bets, come on, hurry up.

12
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,360
Nameless Rookie

13
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,110
versus the King of Killers.

14
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,600
You managed to find me.

15
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,000
Not bad at all.

16
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,480
Actually, I didn't find you.

17
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,760
It was Zhang Ahua who found you.

18
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:12,560
Zhang Ahua?

19
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:16,840
Who's that?

20
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:22,120
The young girl you killed.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,200
She's only twenty-one.

22
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:26,840
I came here today

23
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,240
to settle this debt for her.

24
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,280
You shouldn't have come.

25
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,640
Anywhere else, I'd let you go,

26
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,360
but not here.

27
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:41,880
This is the place under God's gaze.

28
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,120
You could really die here.

29
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,360
Our plan didn't just fail.

30
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,000
It was totally out of control.

31
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,210
It's my fault he got hurt.

32
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:06,440
Don't talk like that.

33
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,520
I came here hoping

34
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,840
we could come up with a plan.

35
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,120
I don't have a plan.

36
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,120
He doesn't trust me anymore.

37
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,720
And if we do find him, then what?

38
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,480
I honestly have no idea.

39
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:29,320
I shouldn't have come up with this plan.

40
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:30,880
Keep going.

41
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,200
I just don't get it.

42
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,120
You've got people backing you,

43
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:38,440
shielding you.

44
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,280
I was even told to steer clear of you.

45
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,600
But look at you now,

46
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,400
do you really deserve it?

47
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,160
I was thinking

48
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,680
if we manage to find him,

49
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:08,760
we should just tell him the truth.

50
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,600
No way.

51
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,720
Absolutely not.

52
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,120
He's been through so much.

53
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,400
And his memory hasn't come back.

54
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:14,990
Right now he's probably

55
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:16,560
in a highly unstable mental state.

56
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,640
If he takes another hit,

57
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,480
he could totally lose his grip.

58
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,840
What does that mean?

59
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,840
It means he'll lose his mind.

60
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,760
And develop a protective personality.

61
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,360
This another self has no reason.

62
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:33,560
Its possessiveness and aggression run high.

63
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,640
If it's not kept in check in time,

64
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,720
this second personality

65
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,600
will slowly consume the host.

66
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,480
Come on, again.

67
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,120
I'll turn everyone who helps you,

68
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,120
everyone who likes you,

69
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,960
and everyone you like,

70
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,080
into gifts just for you.

71
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:41,410
The Buddha is you, the Rakshasa is you.

72
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,680
Victory!

73
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:52,250
Nameless Rookie has won.

74
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:02,940
(Train Station)

75
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:11,610
Still following me?

76
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:13,130
Until you get on.

77
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:15,010
Until you leave on that train.

78
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:30,610
- What?
- Songtai.

79
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:31,570
Songtai!

80
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:32,690
Songtai!

81
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:33,770
Songtai!

82
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:34,850
What are you doing?

83
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:37,530
Everyone, make way.

84
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:40,930
Move aside.

85
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:53,890
Chief Wang,

86
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:56,010
I'll be straight with you.

87
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,450
I came despite being hunted.

88
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:05,930
People like us, pushed aside,

89
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:07,330
should join forces,

90
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:08,650
and find the truth together.

91
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:11,850
What do you say?

92
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:15,290
Impressive for someone so young.

93
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:17,050
But I got suspended.

94
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:18,730
This matter...

95
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:20,530
I can't help much.

96
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,090
I looked into you.

97
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:27,010
I know.

98
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,250
You're not some rigid fool.

99
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:34,490
Oh, you checked on me?

100
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:37,330
I did some digging on you too.

101
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:40,210
The junior officer on loan.

102
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:43,370
Your resume is a bit too fictional.

103
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,490
You're too suspicious

104
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:45,770
I just can't stand leaving

105
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:46,810
without the truth.

106
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:49,410
Besides,

107
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:51,890
I have an offer you can't turn down.

108
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:15,050
Each backup phone I own

109
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:17,570
has its own unique contact number.

110
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,090
I'm warning you,

111
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:27,010
don't talk nonsense to Han Xu.

112
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:28,770
Dr. Chen already said,

113
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:30,810
if he gets agitated,

114
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,010
he'll lose rationality.

115
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,090
Relax.

116
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:35,010
I don't want Chief Han hurt either.

117
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:36,570
So,

118
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:37,890
I need you

119
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:39,730
and your team.

120
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:47,530
Eat first.

121
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:51,970
I'm skipping the meal.

122
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:53,410
Might be poisoned.

123
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:55,570
And you?

124
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:57,170
I don't trust either.

125
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:45,850
I've been waiting for your call.

126
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:47,130
Master.

127
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:49,690
Chief Han.

128
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:51,410
I'm not your enemy.

129
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:52,850
But not my friend either.

130
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:55,010
Let's meet up.

131
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:57,130
I can help you.

132
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:00,050
Alright.

133
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:01,370
Same place as before.

134
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:03,370
Eight tonight.

135
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:06,210
I hope what I see this time

136
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:08,330
isn't a dead body.

137
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:17,420
(Wu; could be fake)

138
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:21,250
I'll ask questions.

139
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:22,290
Just answer me.

140
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,810
Leave out anything extra.

141
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:27,290
You're not the real Wu.

142
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:29,410
Who are you?

143
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:31,730
I'm on loan,

144
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,050
a police officer on the case.

145
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,090
My name's Songtai.

146
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:40,170
An Shaocong, Xiao Ran,

147
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:41,690
and the real Wu

148
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:43,610
died two months ago, right?

149
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:48,730
- Yes.
- What are you acting for?

150
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:49,930
The station's plan.

151
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:51,690
Case reenactment.

152
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:54,210
The goal was to trigger you

153
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:55,610
to help you recover memories.

154
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:58,130
But now the plan

155
00:10:58,610 --> 00:10:59,450
has failed.

156
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:01,650
So you're saying,

157
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:04,380
Xiao Ran and An Shaocong

158
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:05,240
weren't killed by me?

159
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:09,210
Then who actually did it?

160
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:11,530
I'm warning you.

161
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:14,050
Don't talk nonsense to Han Xu.

162
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:16,180
I have no idea.

163
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,040
Let me ask you again.

164
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:19,090
Is this tied to Wang Mingcheng?

165
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:20,120
I don't know either.

166
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,110
If I didn't kill them,

167
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:22,290
why are they after me?

168
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:25,290
Chief Ma

169
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,820
pinned the deaths of Zhang Ahua

170
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:28,980
and the guard on you.

171
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:31,140
The plan hit a snag.

172
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:32,900
Inside the station,

173
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,020
someone's taking you down.

174
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,340
What about Room 405?

175
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:39,900
I found nothing.

176
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,140
But during the investigation,

177
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,420
I came across something odd.

178
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:46,580
What is it?

179
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:49,220
Xiao Ran.

180
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,580
She's not really your wife.

181
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:57,210
Xu.

182
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,380
When are we breaking out?

183
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,620
I'm taking Ran with me.

184
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,220
I know a way to get out.

185
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,100
I'm ready to deal with Xiao Ran.

186
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,700
Your wife Xiao Ran is gone too.

187
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,340
Only the dead pose no threat.

188
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:07,180
Xu!

189
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:11,060
I know

190
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,660
it's hard for you to digest,

191
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:16,500
but it's the truth.

192
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:21,580
