=Episode 18=

11
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:50,810
Don't spin stories in front of me.

12
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:53,720
Back then,

13
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:55,880
you were in terrible shape.

14
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,000
My buddies

15
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,840
all told me

16
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,160
to get rid of you.

17
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,360
But I couldn't do that.

18
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:08,220
Rakshasa blessed us.

19
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,540
You were a sharp little thing,

20
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:16,260
so I had someone

21
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:17,640
teach you to make drugs.

22
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,140
It took just two years.

23
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,060
No one's better

24
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:22,840
than you when it comes to drug making.

25
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:24,380
Stop talking nonsense.

26
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:26,040
I'm Han Xu from Shafeng.

27
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:27,780
I studied here
in middle and high school.

28
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:29,520
After I graduated
from the police academy,

29
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,300
I joined
the South District Police Station.

30
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,060
Seven years later,

31
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,460
I was moved to the Narcotics Unit.

32
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:34,940
My mission was to catch you,

33
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:36,740
Wang Mingcheng.

34
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,140
It's all fake.

35
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:43,980
I made it all up.

36
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:45,540
And you believed it?

37
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:48,980
If you don't believe me,

38
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:50,860
go see for yourself

39
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,140
and find out where your home is,

40
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,540
Shafeng or this place.

41
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:58,180
Where were we?

42
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:00,900
Later,

43
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:02,940
you came up with the refined formula.

44
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:06,620
I thought we'd finally hit it big.

45
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,460
But that's when things fell apart.

46
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:15,220
You fell for a girl named Xiao Ran.

47
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,850
Xu.

48
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:21,140
Do you really like her?

49
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,440
And you want to marry her?

50
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,860
So, you killed Xiao Ran.

51
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,060
Jiu.

52
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,980
Xiao Ran was a police informant.

53
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,700
I did plan to kill her.

54
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:39,380
But you

55
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,700
were hopelessly in love

56
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,200
and insisted on protecting her.

57
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,280
And what happened next?

58
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:46,620
She left,

59
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:48,430
and our base got wiped out.

60
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:52,460
Forget it.

61
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,540
Let's not dwell on the past.

62
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,460
I never blamed you for any of it.

63
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,080
This is to welcome you home.

64
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:20,980
Try it. I made it.

65
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:28,600
What if I don't want to?

66
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,660
If my patience runs out,

67
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,500
the bond between us

68
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:43,660
will be over.

69
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:50,780
Boss.

70
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,100
Please, calm down.

71
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:54,980
Young Master.

72
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:57,140
Give it a try.

73
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:03,020
The Boss made this for you.

74
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,320
How is it, Young Master?

75
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:24,940
Good stuff.

76
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,500
That's more like it.

77
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:30,900
If anything comes to mind,

78
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,860
tell me right away.

79
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,500
Take the Young Master to rest.

80
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:37,540
Yes.

81
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:25,420
Is this a good time?

82
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:36,460
Get me a glass of water.

83
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:37,900
Quick.

84
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,360
Your water, Young Master.

85
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,220
Is this even drinkable?

86
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,640
Tastes like horse urine.

87
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:56,580
You looking down on me?

88
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:57,600
This is all we've got.

89
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,200
- Call Boss Jiu over now.
- Please...

90
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:07,420
You stirred up such a mess.

91
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:10,540
How will you explain with no results?

92
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,020
I'll leave you a body.

93
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,940
At least the trip won't be wasted.

94
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,940
I know exactly what you mean.

95
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:25,740
You just want that refined formula early

96
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,380
so you can squeeze me for cash,

97
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:28,620
right?

98
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,060
Listen.

99
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:31,900
I have him,

100
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,060
and I've drugged him.

101
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:36,180
What could be more thrilling
than my drug?

102
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,580
Do I have to do
whatever Doctor Chen says?

103
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:42,120
If he breaks down,
I'll just keep dosing until he dies.

104
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,760
Let's part ways.

105
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,020
Listen.

106
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,900
I'm done waiting.

107
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,580
You needed me, Young Master?

108
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,620
What do you need?

109
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,120
Tell them to get lost.

110
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,060
Out.

111
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:17,940
Who are you?

112
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,240
Why are you helping me?

113
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,140
Chief Han.

114
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:23,600
If you know I'm helping you,

115
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,420
don't mess things up.

116
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,060
I've saved this glucose powder for ages.

117
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:36,100
Next time, you might not be so lucky.

118
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,300
Why did you betray Wang Mingcheng?

119
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,860
Because you gave me a code name.

120
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:53,460
405.

121
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:55,780
405?

122
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:01,780
You're my informant?

123
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:02,700
No.

124
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,340
You're not qualified

125
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,660
to make me your informant.

126
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,420
To be clear,

127
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,060
we made

128
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:13,180
a deal

129
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,600
before you lost your memory.

130
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:27,980
With this look,

131
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,420
it's hard not to stand out.

132
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,320
What do you need to know?

133
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:36,660
Inside the station,

134
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,500
who's related to Wang Mingcheng?

135
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:39,780
Are you trying to get me caught?

136
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:42,980
Do you still want a way out?

137
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:48,980
You're really unreliable.

138
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:51,620
When I found a lead and went to you,

139
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,660
you were in a coma again.

140
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,060
Later, I went to the Wu guy,

141
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:57,700
and he ended up dead.

142
00:08:58,980 --> 00:08:59,860
Did you find the mole?

143
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,180
Who is it?

144
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,100
I found out.

145
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:07,860
But why should I tell you?

146
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,180
Because you swapped

147
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:14,940
the drug I was gonna take

148
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,340
with glucose powder.

149
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,020
You don't trust any of the cops

150
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,020
in the police station,

151
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,020
except me.

152
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,340
Also,

153
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,310
I'm guessing

154
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,420
the lead you got

155
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:28,620
is also unclear.

156
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:29,980
So,

157
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,260
leave it to me.

158
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:32,660
Don't worry.

159
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:33,660
I can help you.

160
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,500
I'll trust you one more time.

161
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:49,140
Wang Mingcheng
always called this number.

162
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,060
(Insider cop)

163
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,300
Aren't you afraid

164
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,780
I'll admit I'm Wang Yu?

165
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:02,700
Do you know why I wanted out?

166
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,540
Wang Mingcheng is too arrogant.

167
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,380
He makes up lies no one would buy.

168
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,940
It's just photoshopping.

169
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,820
But you're pretty odd, too.

170
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:16,420
You actually think
Xiao Ran was your wife?

171
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:19,180
Did the amnesia drive you crazy?

172
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,000
You don't even deserve her.

173
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:23,740
Xiao Ran

174
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:27,260
was not your wife.

175
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:32,460
What do you mean?

176
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:33,500
Spell it out.

177
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,540
Boss Jiu, the Boss wants you.

178
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,420
That's it.

179
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:44,980
Make do with this place.

180
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,780
We set up this room for you.

181
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:53,900
We'll have a meeting tomorrow morning.

182
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:55,940
Breakfast starts half an hour later.

183
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:58,860
Please bear with it.

184
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,580
We set up this room for you.

185
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,740
Please bear with it.

186
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:23,540
Xu, you're back.

187
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,860
Xu, I know a way we can get out.

188
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:37,860
Come with me.

189
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,140
Where on earth did he go?

190
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:13,560
We've been searching all day.

191
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:17,860
Boss Jiu.

192
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,140
No luck; let's head back.

193
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,280
You're asking for trouble.

194
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:23,740
The Boss shot the guys
watching the Young Master.

195
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:25,780
Eat up and keep looking.

196
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,540
Boss Jiu, where are you headed?

197
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,020
To the restroom.

198
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,160
Boss Jiu, I'll join you.

199
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:38,840
What, trying to outmatch me?

200
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:40,260
Hold it in.

201
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,340
Go grab some drinks.

202
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:49,140
(Convenience Store)

203
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,340
As you suggested,

204
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:07,300
I gave Han Xu the phone number.

205
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:10,740
What did he say?

206
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,780
The amnesia must've driven him mad.

207
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:15,660
He even thought Xiao Ran was his wife.

208
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:19,500
Find a chance to get out fast.

209
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,460
Wang Mingcheng isn't a fool.

210
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,660
It's not the right time yet.

211
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:27,940
I'm just starting to figure out
the real cause of Xiao Ran's death.

212
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,660
Who is it?

213
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:30,700
I'm not sure,

214
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:33,140
but there's one person
whose role is unclear.

215
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:34,780
Give me a little more time.

216
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,100
Only when things are clear

217
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,440
can you get your revenge.

218
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,120
If something happens to you,

219
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,720
I'll offer an incense stick for you

220
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:45,540
on behalf of Xiao Ran.

221
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:59,340
(Memory recovery: 40%)

222
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:01,580

the mole has been identified)
