The target's inside.

The rest, with me.

14
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,760
Move out.

15
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,640
Yes.

16
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,720
You three, wait for the lift.

17
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,680
I'll go that way.

18
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,600
You two, with me.

19
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:21,660
- Okay.
- You stay.

20
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:00,020
(Wu: I'll wait in the garage.)

21
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,640
Mom, you don't seem in a good mood today.

22
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:20,840
I'm fine.

23
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,960
Remember our deal, okay?

24
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:24,190
Mm-hmm.

25
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:35,640
You two, head that way.

26
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,600
You two, over there.

27
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:37,510
- Go.
- Follow me.

(Pusat Perniagaan Golden Summit)

Hey.

30
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,780
What's wrong with you?

31
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:05,760
Why'd you take my hat?

32
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,080
Sorry, I mistook you.

33
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,160
Psycho!

34
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:13,690
See?

35
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:14,560
Told you to trust me.

36
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,400
Yeah.

37
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,520
Don't move.

38
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,400
Hands on your head.

39
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:40,510
Turn around.

40
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,840
Found in the garage...

41
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,040
What's going on?

42
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,960
Chief Ma, it's me.

43
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,720
All clear on my side.

44
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,600
Just a quick update.

45
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,870
Sorry in advance, man.

46
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,520
Get in the car, Master.

47
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,360
Why are they after me?

48
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,800
The crime scene video is decrypted.

49
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:00,790
Director Zhou, Chief Wang.

50
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,660
This is from the night it happened,

00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:05,100
all captured by the encrypted camera.

52
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:26,740
Isn't that Han Xu?

53
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:35,780
What now?

54
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:47,700
Your case.

55
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,340
You call the shots.

56
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,340
Is your squad ready?

57
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:01,260
Yes, sir.

58
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:02,980
We can move anytime.

59
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:04,940
I won't let anything slip.

60
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:29,500
Go arrest him.

61
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:30,860
Yes.

62
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,500
No way, this isn't who Master is.

63
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,340
Master,

64
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,180
you're a suspect now.

65
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,260
What do you think?

66
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,580
I've been with you for so long.

67
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,180
I know exactly what you're like.

68
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,660
Let's take a huge step back first.

69
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:53,620
Even if Mr. An
and your wife were involved,

70
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,140
you wouldn't kill them.

71
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,980
Trusting your gut is a detective's trap.

72
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:01,940
I know.

73
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:03,860
I remember everything

74
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:04,780
you taught me.

75
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,420
Found anything yet?

76
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,060
I have two questions.

77
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:24,580
Be straight with me.

78
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:30,700
First,

79
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:33,660
is it really true

80
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:35,460
that you remember nothing?

81
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:43,380
The doctor said
I might've had head trauma.

82
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:44,620
So I've lost my memory.

83
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,680
On the bright side,

84
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,220
I don't have split personality.

85
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,580
It's actual memory loss.

86
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:56,970
Second,

87
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,540
if Ran and Mr. An

88
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:02,620
were really killed by you,

89
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:06,100
what's your plan?

90
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:13,620
According to the autopsy report,

91
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,720
besides the fatal wound,

92
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,340
there was also a male DNA sample.

93
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:20,500
I'm still a police officer.

94
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,980
If you hadn't tipped me off,

95
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:24,800
I'd have let them take me.

96
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:50,500
You still have a choice.

97
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,550
The Forensic Doctor

98
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,980
give you the autopsy report,

99
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,180
but I had my doubts.

100
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,060
She seemed like she meant well.

101
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:06,940
But that was against procedure.

102
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,580
So I decided to look into it.

103
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:13,100
I was trying to find the original report.

104
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:16,060
Didn't expect to uncover a secret.

105
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:20,860
I said everything exactly as you asked.

106
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,180
Did you get rid of the original?

107
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,180
Han Xu is a good police officer.

108
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:27,780
Don't leave anything behind.

109
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:29,420
Don't worry.

110
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:30,900
It's been shredded.

111
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:42,660
(No foreign DNA was found in the body.)

112
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,380
How could this be? Why?

113
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:47,500
- Master.
- You knew too?

114
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,700
This is the original report.

115
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,460
It shows no trace of semen DNA.

116
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:56,180
Mr. An and Ran are likely innocent.

117
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:57,820
This whole thing

118
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:59,440
was a scheme aimed at you.

119
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,460
Chief Wang told me,

120
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,380
I can't let you see it.

121
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:05,140
You know you're not allowed at the scene.

122
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:11,780
Think about

123
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,260
you and Mr. An's operation.

124
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:16,780
You set up a tight plan

125
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:19,940
to capture Wang Mingcheng.

126
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,650
Then why did he

127
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:23,580
still escape from your network?

128
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:29,500
Could it be...

129
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:32,780
we have a problem inside?

130
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:35,380
Every time we went after him,

131
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:36,940
he was the one in charge.

132
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,020
You mean

133
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,060
they're trying to make it

134
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,100
look like it's all on me?

135
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:50,780
Master,

136
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:53,340
you're a perfect scapegoat.

137
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,100
That's true.

138
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,860
Mr. An's my only contact.

139
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,940
I've dealt with
Wang Mingcheng the longest.

140
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,460
No wonder Chen Yaxin...

141
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:20,460
When Doctor Chen was treating me,

142
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,700
I kept thinking about that mission.

143
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,120
Wang Mingcheng was inside.

144
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,180
I'll get the informant out.

145
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:28,860
Turns out,

146
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:30,700
that was where it all began.

147
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:33,500
My guess is,

148
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:35,820
during his operation,

149
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,420
you found something linked to Wang Jian

150
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,660
and he felt threatened by it.

151
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,020
That's why

152
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,620
he used this chance to frame you.

153
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,560
If he could make it stick

154
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,340
that you killed Ran and Mr. An,

155
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,540
you'd be silenced forever.

156
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,380
So,

157
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:53,900
you can't get caught.

158
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,020
But why Wang?

159
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,380
He's with the CIU.

160
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,100
How could he know

161
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,440
a Narcotics Unit mission?

162
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,060
Besides,

163
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:06,660
he could never know

164
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:07,890
Mr. An was an undercover.

165
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:08,780
That's exactly why

166
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,380
he is the safest.

167
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,380
Think about it.

168
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:14,060
Our entire station

169
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,700
only has this many people.

170
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,620
You're closest to Mr. An.

171
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:18,780
Everyone knows that.

172
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:20,420
Mr. An suddenly quit.

173
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,660
With Wang Jian's instincts,

174
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,380
it's not hard to guess

175
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:26,300
Mr. An might be on some secret mission.

176
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,140
If you follow that logic,

177
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:30,860
you'd be a suspect too.

178
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:37,540
Master,

179
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:39,780
if I were the mole,

180
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:42,670
we wouldn't be here talking.

181
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,100
In the whole station,

182
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,620
I've known Wang the longest,

183
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,060
and we're the closest.

184
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,100
It couldn't be him.

185
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:02,380
Sometimes,

186
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,340
those you know best

187
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:07,300
are the ones who want you silent.
