=Episode 5=

11
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,000
You're way too anxious.

12
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:53,220
This can't go on.

13
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:55,420
What a coincidence.

14
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:56,980
I drink this brand too.

15
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,140
It was your favorite back in college.

16
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:02,420
Sometimes I grab a sip as well.

17
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:05,460
Mind if I smoke?

18
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:25,180
I didn't smoke in college, remember?

19
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,060
The last guest left it.

20
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,780
Looks like you share a taste.

21
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,060
Guess you're lucky tonight.

22
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:34,620
But better not to do it.

23
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:35,540
For your health.

24
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:37,740
For me right now,

25
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:39,100
the word "luck"

26
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:40,740
feels out of reach.

27
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:49,540
You know you can talk to me.

28
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:51,380
Don't forget,

29
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:52,580
I'm a psychiatrist.

30
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,420
Alright then.

31
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:06,300
There's no point hiding it.

32
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,220
I thought I just had

33
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:09,580
a split personality

34
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:11,260
and became a murderer.

35
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:12,980
But then you told me,

36
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,520
I never had an episode.

37
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:16,620
Wu said to me,

38
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:18,820
someone set me up on purpose.

39
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,880
So I went to the station for evidence.

40
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,080
The video shows that the murderer is me.

41
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,180
But it was shot two months ago.

42
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,700
Right when I lost my memory,

43
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:29,580
as you said.

44
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:31,670
This whole thing

45
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:33,280
becomes more complicated, right?

46
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,580
I still can't prove myself innocent.

47
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,160
The Han Xu I remembered

48
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,180
could never be the murderer.

49
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:46,530
What was Han Xu like

50
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:47,500
in your memory?

51
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:49,940
He was righteous,

52
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:50,980
brave,

53
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,100
and wise.

54
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:53,540
Most importantly,

55
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,300
he never gave up easily.

56
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:00,740
So you shouldn't give up.

57
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,220
Then how can I get my memory back?

58
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:18,700
Regaining memory is tough.

59
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:20,700
Sometimes it happens in a flash.

60
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,740
Sometimes it takes three to five years.

61
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:23,940
Or it may never happen.

62
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:26,220
But based on your situation,

63
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,420
I see two approaches.

64
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:30,060
First, I tried hypnosis on you once.

65
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,740
You started to remember some things.

66
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,980
Second, according to you,

67
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,340
before you got the evidence,

68
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,940
the parking lot brought back memories.

69
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:39,100
Just fragments, but still memories.

70
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:41,540
So here's what I suggest:

71
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:42,940
Try to find something else,

72
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:45,140
anything that might really trigger you.

73
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:47,820
Then we can use hypnosis to treat you.

74
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,180
Alright.

75
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,260
I'll fetch something. Wait here.

76
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:58,580
Looking for these?

77
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:00,700
Are you serious?

78
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:08,060
You think I'm the culprit,
but didn't arrest me.

79
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,560
Instead, you wait for me here.

80
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,060
The stuff's right there,
but you don't take it.

81
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:13,500
Why?

82
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,100
Because we are friends.

83
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,820
You didn't get rid of this stuff,

84
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,500
so I was right about you.

85
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,260
You're still the guy I know.

86
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,420
But I was wrong about you.

87
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,100
You think you're clever,

88
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,660
using a video from two months ago

89
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,380
to pin a murder on me from two days ago.

90
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,580
What are you talking about?

91
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:37,660
I had someone check it out.

92
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,220
The underlying timecode on this video

93
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,180
has been tampered with.

94
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:42,660
It's shot two months ago.

95
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:43,620
No way.

96
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:46,020
It's decrypted yesterday.

97
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:47,940
That's why we were after you.

98
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:50,540
Han Xu, you're stealing evidence.

99
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:51,780
That's a crime.

100
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,340
Wang.

101
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:55,940
After so many years,

102
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,460
you haven't improved much.

103
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,100
But your acting's gotten better.

104
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,070
Alright then.

105
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,460
Take me to whoever checked this.

106
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,780
- I'll ask.
- To silence them?

107
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,100
Han Xu, are you insane?

108
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,200
I lost my memory, not mind.

109
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,140
Are they trustworthy?

110
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,580
Why can't I see the autopsy report?

111
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:09,540
Is what they said legit?

112
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:10,420
You faked the report.

113
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,320
You framed me, smeared Mr. An and Ran.

114
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:12,970
You're crazy!

115
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:13,820
What's your motive?

116
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:19,900
Fine.

117
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:21,780
Let me make it clear.

118
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:25,140
I didn't fake any autopsy report.

119
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:28,220
I hid it for confidentiality, that's all.

120
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,540
And I didn't collude
with the forensic doctor.

121
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,060
Fine.

122
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:39,420
Act all you want.

123
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:40,780
So what now?

124
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:46,620
Let me guess.

125
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:47,980
What you just said

126
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,420
is what Wu told you, right?

127
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,660
I've had doubts about him for ages.

128
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:55,580
The reason I came today

129
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,420
is to ask you to turn yourself in.

130
00:06:58,980 --> 00:06:59,980
I can't wait any longer.

131
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,260
You need to come with me.

132
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,180
My people are all outside.

133
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:08,540
I hope you,

134
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:13,420
keep some dignity as police.

135
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:24,820
Alright.

136
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,620
Let me ask you one thing.

137
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:31,620
Just answer me.

138
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,060
Forget about detective work,

139
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,380
and forget our friendship.

140
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,020
What do you think

141
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,100
the relationship

142
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:49,700
between Mr. An and Xiao Ran?

143
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:01,820
I honestly have no idea.

144
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:05,940
But I trust the evidence.

145
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:36,020
Get in.

146
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:12,820
Don't go.

147
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:21,540
Don't!

148
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:24,820
Han Xu, please, don't go.

149
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,180
Han Xu!

150
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,100
Han Xu!

151
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:38,620
Han Xu!

152
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:57,640
Thought you weren't coming.

153
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:58,740
Don't wait for me.

154
00:10:59,100 --> 00:10:59,940
I can't make it.

155
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:01,460
Did something happen?

156
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:02,620
Wang Jian caught me.

157
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,140
But I escaped.

158
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:06,230
I'm worried I will drag you

159
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:06,820
into this.

160
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:07,860
Wang Jian?

161
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:08,860
That's impossible.

162
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,220
Hard to explain over the phone.

163
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,420
Anyway, thank you.

164
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,300
I'll figure out the truth.

165
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:15,940
Who helped you?

166
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:17,260
Was it Wu, that guy?

167
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:19,220
From what I see now,

168
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,140
something's off with Wu too.

169
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:22,920
Don't know who to trust.

170
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:25,260
Send me your address.

171
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,100
I'll go meet you.

172
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:28,440
To stir things up?

173
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,300
Han Xu,

174
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:30,900
listen to me carefully,

175
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:32,860
to me,

176
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:33,860
you'll always be

177
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,940
the righteous, brave, and wise police.

178
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,860
If you ever need anything, just tell me.

179
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:40,940
Anytime, anywhere.

180
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:45,300
Thanks.

181
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,500
Hey Ahua,

182
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,100
remember the mystery box I gave you?

183
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,020
What did you get?

184
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,900
I got a standard edition.

185
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,020
What about you?

186
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:05,380
Hold on, I'm still opening mine.

187
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:12,220
It's the Secret Queen of Hearts!

188
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:14,140
Wow, that's so lucky!

189
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:18,660
Officer Han,

190
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:20,300
you don't need to.

191
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,380
No charge for that video.

192
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,660
I need you to tell me the truth.

193
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:27,140
Hey, don't joke around.

194
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,580
I haven't done anything to upset you.

195
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,060
Tell me,

196
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,340
when was this video recorded?

197
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:35,300
I don't know.

198
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,580
I swear! I honestly have no idea.

199
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:38,700
I lied to you.

200
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,740
But the video's timecode

201
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:41,700
has been masked.

202
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:42,820
Their skills are too good

203
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:43,700
for me to restore it.

204
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:47,820
Why did you lie to me?

205
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,020
Someone forced me to lie.
