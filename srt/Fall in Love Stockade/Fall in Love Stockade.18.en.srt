20
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:58,100
But things are very clear now.

21
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:00,960
Seven years ago, Grandpa found my fa...

22
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,140
I left something here.

23
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,800
Don't get me wrong.

24
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,300
I just think

25
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,000
it's a waste to dump this.

26
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,260
This is what you were looking for?

27
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:42,260
Mm.

28
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,000
But it's

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,240
my lunch leftover.

30
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,220
Maybe I remembered it wrong.

31
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,900
I should go.

32
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:04,900
Zheyuan,

33
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,660
be patient, OK?

34
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,240
My father died.

35
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,400
My grandpa is in a coma.

36
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:10,760
Certainly, you can be patient!

37
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,600
To sort out the evidence for you,

38
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,100
I only sleep for two hours a day.

39
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,620
It's a case 24 years ago.

40
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,980
How many files do I have to check

41
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,180
and how many people do I have to ask?

42
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,180
You're an attorney

43
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,220
and don't you know that?

44
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,600
Knowing you're exhausted,

45
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,460
I want to help!

46
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,100
You're related in this case.

47
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,040
You can't get involved.

48
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,380
About this,
you know better than anyone else!

49
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,760
I got the wrong thing last time.

50
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,880
May I look around again?

51
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,200
I checked the cooker

52
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,600
and made some noodles.

53
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,180
Eat some.

54
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,480
I won't.

55
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,160
Whatever.

56
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:06,860
I'll feed them to animals.

57
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,600
Lin Wanwan, what on earth do you want?

58
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:16,240
You're away for two days.

59
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,760
But you come every day with an excuse.

60
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,240
Are you feeling sorry

61
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,160
or showing mercy?

62
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,300
I mean neither.

63
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,960
If you really don't like me,

64
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:32,260
stop giving me worthless sympathy.

65
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,400
That's the last thing I need.

66
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,380
I won't come again.

67
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:53,330
(Art Treasures)

68
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,120
Here goes the third lot.

69
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:57,780
50,000 yuan!

70
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,520
Anybody?

71
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,480
80,000!

72
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:01,980
80,000. Anyone?

73
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,120
100,000!

74
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,180
Deal.

75
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:07,820
Wanwan,

76
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,580
I looked for this box for three years.

77
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,720
At last, I found it.

78
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,240
As long as we get it,

79
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,040
we may possibly travel back.

80
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,540
The next lot is

81
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,120
from the Xuan Dynasty,

82
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,240
1,500 years ago.

83
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,480
Look. There it is.

84
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:31,860
That's indeed my box.

85
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,340
It's small and exquisite

86
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,610
and it even has a mechanism.

87
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,820
Is this mechanism real?

88
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,840
How much is it worth?

89
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,760
How much money have you brought?

90
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,280
Is it enough?

91
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:44,640
Poor taste.

92
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:47,820
It's just a box of bandits.

93
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:48,780
Not valuable at all.

94
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,060
A real collector

95
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,140
won't like it.

96
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,160
Yes, yes.

97
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:53,780
It has a long history,

98
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,240
but its owner also matters.

99
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,640
Maybe we can get it easily.

100
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,640
The starting price is

101
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:02,580
200,000 yuan.

102
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:03,960
What?

103
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,040
Why is it so expensive?

104
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,320
250,000!

105
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,320
And someone's really bidding?

106
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,220
250,000 going once.

107
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,580
Anybody?

108
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,580
- I...
- I'll give 300,000.

109
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,720
It's... It's like a robbery.

110
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,620
Now, 300,000.

111
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:17,460
Anyone?

112
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:18,940
300,000 going once.

113
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,620
350,000!

114
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,220
Anybody?

115
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,020
This lady offered 350,000.

116
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:25,860
What the heck!

117
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,340
- It's robbery.
- It's a rare treasure.

118
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,340
350,000 going once.

119
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,140
Anybody?

120
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,320
400,000!

121
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,080
450,000!

122
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,380
Hey. Why didn't you bid?

123
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,760
Song Jingyu!

124
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,720
- Song Jingyu, bid!
- That lady offered 450,000.

125
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,200
450,000 going once.

126
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,380
Do it!

127
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,300
But I only have 300,000 with me.

128
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,160
I can't bid.

129
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:49,580
Oh, no.

130
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,900
450,000 going twice.

131
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,020
500,000.

132
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:58,630
500,000.

133
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,280
This man offered 500,000.

134
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,620
He has sharp eyes.

135
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:02,460
Why are you here?

136
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:04,240
Anybody else?

137
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:05,380
Just a coincidence.

138
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,240
Why didn't you tell me?

139
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:13,380
It's something important.

140
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,520
But you didn't tell me either.

141
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,680
500,000 going once.

142
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,380
I didn't want to disturb you.

143
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,180
- Recently,
- 500,000 going twice.

144
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,620
you've been handling your father's case.

145
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:22,580
550,000.

146
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,000
600,000.

147
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,060
OK.

148
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,180
This gentleman offered 600,000.

149
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,720
Looks like he has to get it.

150
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,560
Anybody else?

151
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,240
My father died

152
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:34,980
24 years ago.

153
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:37,140
His case can't be solved in a day.

154
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,320
But I believe if I keep investigating,

155
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,500
the truth will be revealed.

156
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:43,620
You figured this out?

157
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:46,980
650,000!

158
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,560
800,000.

159
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,860
800,000 from this gentleman.

160
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,020
Generous, indeed.

161
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,480
Anybody?

162
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,260
Since I was little, rumors
have been hurting me.

163
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:57,300
Anybody?

164
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:59,580
I can finally do something for Father.

165
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:00,720
But it doesn't mean

166
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,300
you can't ask me for help.

167
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:05,620
This guy

168
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:09,220
can't help with anything.

169
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,040
I...

170
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,160
850,000.

171
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:15,760
A million.

172
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,240
Isn't that too much?

173
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:20,740
Unlike us,

174
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,200
you don't need the box.

175
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,680
You're wasting your money

176
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,360
- and I...
- If you have to go back home,

177
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,060
let me help you.

178
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:29,260
A million going once.

179
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:32,700
So, tell me seriously.

180
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,160
Do you have to go back there?

181
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,980
A million going twice.

182
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:44,760
Yes.

183
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,860
Then, I will get

184
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:49,800
this box.

185
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,740
A million going third.

186
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:53,580
Deal.

187
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,140
We got it, Chief Lin!

188
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,640
Mr. Tang, you're extremely wealthy.

189
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,340
Thanks.

190
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:09,460
I'm not that wealthy.

191
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:10,660
But at least,

192
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,960
I can afford a box.

193
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,400
Gentleman, get some rest in the VIP room.

194
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,100
We'll have your payment done

195
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,860
and then give you the box.

196
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,000
Don't be that arrogant.

197
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,160
Silly rich man.

198
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:29,780
I am, indeed.

199
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,760
Too much money can be a trouble.

200
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,700
I can't solve this problem, anyway.

201
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,640
You...

202
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,400
Hello.

203
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:44,740
OK.

204
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:46,700
What?

205
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,120
That abducted woman

206
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:49,960
has been saved.

207
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:51,860
Great.

208
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,440
Looks like

209
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,440
Zhuang Danian can't get away.

210
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,600
I didn't expect it to go that smoothly.

211
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,860
So, who yelled at me the other day?

212
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:06,660
I don't care.

213
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,820
You just owe me an apology.

214
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,240
And...

215
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:11,760
Finger heart.

216
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:14,920
He,

217
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:16,580
I'm sorry.

218
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,820
Come on. Forget it.

219
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:22,860
Disgusting.

220
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,200
Keep it for your woman.

221
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,220
Hope so.
