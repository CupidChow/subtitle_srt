What are you talking about?

I don't need a sister.

I need...

00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:03,820
Need what?

Need...

26
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,320
Need to be wise.

27
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,760
Go get Zhuang Mengyao.

28
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:16,220
I remember

29
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,620
Old Chief once painted

30
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:20,060
your house.

31
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,840
What's wrong with you?

32
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,680
Speaking of Zhuang Mengyao,

33
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,040
why are you silent?

34
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,440
No.

35
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,940
I... I'm in no relationship with her.

36
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:31,900
I'm just curious.

37
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:33,580
About what?

38
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:35,420
I wonder

39
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:37,640
why Grandpa could paint my house

40
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:40,700
if he never went there.

41
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:45,100
Zhuang Mengyao took photos for him.

42
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:46,620
Maybe,

43
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,880
your grandpa took her as your wife.

44
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,240
No. Listen.

45
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:55,700
Wait for me.

46
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,620
Hello, Mr. Zhuang.

47
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,840
Zheyuan,

48
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,900
did you return?

49
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,780
Yes. A couple of days ago.

50
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:07,680
Come have dinner with me.

51
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:09,540
I'll be waiting at the Dream Restaurant.

52
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,700
But I'm with a friend now.

53
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,440
How about next time?

54
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,140
Goodbye, Mr. Zhuang.

55
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,180
What?

56
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,540
Mr. Zhuang invited me to dinner.

57
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,480
I turned him down.

58
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,640
Why did you?

59
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,480
Go.

60
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:36,940
Tang,

61
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,680
is your grandpa getting better?

62
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:41,740
As bad as before.

63
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:43,180
Glad to hear that.

64
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,580
I mean

65
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,500
he isn't getting worse.

66
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:49,580
Living in this world,

67
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,680
we should be positive.

68
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,840
Mm.

69
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,680
You made sense.

70
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,640
Oh.

71
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:58,240
That year,
on his way back home from my place,

72
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,180
he had that car crash.

73
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:02,480
I've been regretting not driving him.

74
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:03,940
Zheyuan,

75
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,880
whatever your grandpa needs,

76
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,800
do tell me.

77
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,100
I'll try my best to help you.

78
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,140
OK, Mr. Zhuang.

79
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:14,420
There you are,

80
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:15,640
Zheyuan.

81
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,800
Long time no see.

82
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,860
(What are they doing here?)

83
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:19,040
When you came back here,

84
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,640
why didn't you take Mengyao?

85
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,220
Aunt,

86
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,440
Zheyuan has been too busy.

87
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,840
Be considerate.

88
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,380
You must be

89
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:32,300
Zheyuan's distant relative I heard about.

90
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:33,700
This is my friend,

91
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:34,540
Lin Wanwan.

92
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,340
She looks young.

93
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:38,200
Girl,

94
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,240
have you graduated?

95
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,180
Come on, Aunt.

96
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,580
Not everyone goes to college.

97
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,940
Oh. I see.

98
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:47,780
Sorry.

99
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,000
I didn't know you had this relative.

100
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,400
I don't think you need to know.

101
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,020
It doesn't matter.

102
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,240
Everyone

103
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,740
can be ignorant.

104
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,080
Who's the owner of car 8U888?

105
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,080
Move your car, please.

106
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:05,400
It's my car.

107
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,340
I'll be right back.

108
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,680
Behave yourself.

109
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:12,580
Don't fight anyone.

110
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:17,880
(Why would I fight?)

111
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:22,820
Wanwan,

112
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,900
I know Zheyuan is an excellent man.

113
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,240
However,

114
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:30,200
this is a family reunion.

115
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,880
Isn't it inappropriate

116
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,600
for you to stay?

117
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,780
Now,

118
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,200
many young girls

119
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,580
have no self-respect.

120
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,800
They pester someone else's boyfriend.

121
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:45,480
And she even dares
to eat with his real girlfriend.

122
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:48,500
How poorly she's been instructed!

123
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,440
So rude.

124
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,840
Elders haven't started to eat yet.

125
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,080
The dish is stained.

126
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:56,040
I don't want to eat it.

127
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,580
Have it removed!

128
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,120
(Childish woman.)

129
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:03,780
Oops.

130
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:05,740
Wanwan,

131
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,800
it was so careless of you.

132
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:10,000
Aunt, are you OK?

133
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,180
What kind of family are you from?

134
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,300
So rude.

135
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,980
My family.

136
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,480
Zheyuan,

137
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,980
Wanwan was so careless.

138
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:21,960
Zheyuan,

139
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:23,640
your father and I

140
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,180
grew up together.

141
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,180
We don't care about the bride price.

142
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:31,300
Just marry Mengyao and have children.

143
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:34,480
I can answer to your father, then.

144
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,320
Mr. Zhuang,

145
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,100
you got something wrong.

146
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,720
- Mengyao and I...
- Zheyuan,

147
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:41,000
my father doesn't mean to push you.

148
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,240
I know you've been busy.

149
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,740
Come on, Dad.

150
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,700
Why did you say that?

151
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:48,940
Wow.

152
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,900
People in your town take men forcibly?

153
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:53,880
Zheyuan,

154
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,740
didn't you tell me

155
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,500
you were in no relationship with her?

156
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,340
Lin Wanwan,

157
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,640
what are you talking about?

158
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,840
Zheyuan,

159
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,080
I know you're still angry at what I did.

160
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,740
Let's forget that, OK?

161
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:11,220
Mr. Zhuang,

162
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,740
Mengyao and I
were never in a relationship.

163
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,900
We've just been friends.

164
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,700
Three years ago...

165
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:19,620
Zheyuan,

166
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,540
my mother forced me on blind dates.

167
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,540
I had to tell her you were my boyfriend.

168
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,480
Help me, please, OK?

169
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:34,640
It's OK that I don't deny it.

170
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:38,080
But I won't admit it in front of them.

171
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,000
This is the best I can do.

172
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,520
OK, OK.

173
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:43,400
That's enough.

174
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,500
Enough.

175
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,540
That's what happened.

176
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,720
In the past years,

177
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,480
Zhuang Mengyao claimed to be my girlfriend.

178
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,500
I didn't deny it

179
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,940
just to do her the favor.

180
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,900
But now, I don't want
to be misunderstood.

181
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,020
Let's go.

182
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,020
Zheyuan!

183
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:02,940
What...

184
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:08,000
Tang Zheyuan is getting more arrogant!

185
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,840
Wait for me.

186
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:11,540
Wanwan.

187
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,540
Wanwan,

188
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,500
I explained everything, didn't I?

189
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:16,880
None of my business.

190
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:17,940
Out of my way!

191
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,040
Lin Wanwan.

192
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,180
Wait for me.

193
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,320
Lin Wanwan.

194
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:24,420
What?

195
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,440
Why are you so angry?

196
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:28,980
Is it because...

197
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,040
Shut up!

198
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:31,700
I'm not being jealous!

199
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:37,740
You just confessed that.

200
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,740
(Who said I was jealous?)

201
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,280
(You're the jealous one.)

202
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,280
(Always jealous.)

203
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,940
- Come out.
- Chief Lin.

204
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,520
Don't beat me.

205
00:07:58,780 --> 00:07:59,620
It's me.

206
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,700
What are you doing here?

207
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:04,280
Tang Zheyuan didn't allow me to see you.

208
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,700
In case I lose contact with you,

209
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,580
I have to wait here.

210
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,080
Chief Lin,

211
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,600
I've waited for a whole day.

212
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:13,020
Could you give me your phone number?

213
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,000
Put your number in.

214
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,300
If there's nothing else, leave.

215
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,500
Tang Zheyuan is returning soon.

216
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,220
