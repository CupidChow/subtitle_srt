What are you doing here?

24
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:14,400
Get out!

25
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:16,740
Tang Zheyuan.

26
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,280
You stink.

27
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,400
I'm freaked out.

28
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:24,560
Get out now.

29
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,400
You smell so bad.

30
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,500
Take me to Old Chief.

31
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,560
Don't go wild.

32
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,360
Take me to Old Chief.

33
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,440
Not until you get out!

34
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,340
Get out now!

35
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,360
Take me to Old Chief

36
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,700
and I'll tell you the password.

37
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,000
OK. I'll take you to him.

38
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,840
Now you go out.

39
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:41,700
Out!

40
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,660
That's settled, then.

41
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,600
Out you go.

42
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,540

(Surgical Appointment

44
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,300
A big hospital, indeed.

45
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,140
Let me repeat it.

46
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:59,460
Don't talk so loud.

47
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,000
I can't talk loud.

48
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,300
I'll just take a look and leave.

49
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,140
I get it.

50
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,040
Old Chief!

51
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,640
What're you doing?

52
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:23,440
Why is he so sick?

53
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:24,800
Old Chief,

54
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,140
I'm sorry.

55
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:28,640
- Sorry for this.
- Stop that. Go.

56
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:30,500
Old Chief, wake up!

57
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,340
Go. No noise here.

58
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:32,800
I'm sorry!

59
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,940
It's me, Wanwan!

60
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,740
It's the hospital. Be quiet.

61
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,740
Guys, come have a look.

62
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,440
What a heartless man!

63
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:52,500
She's crying.

64
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:53,400
Lin Wanwan, stop it.

65
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:57,460
What happened to her?

66
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,200
She's been crying for a long time

67
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,800
but this man remains indifferent.

68
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,060
He's your family.

69
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:05,060
You're so irresponsible.

70
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,400
What a man he is!

71
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,540
Poor girl.

72
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:09,800
This man must have knocked her up

73
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,360
but doesn't want to be responsible.

74
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,060
Betrayer.

75
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,320
- Lin Wanwan, stop!
- He's pulling.

76
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,660
You got everybody here.

77
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:18,380
Go!

78
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,340
Ooh.

79
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,340
Where's he taking her?

80
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:24,580
It's easy to make her cry

81
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:25,860
but it's hard to get her back.

82
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:27,320
That's right.

83
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:37,780
Stop crying, will you?

84
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,140
I'm not crying.

85
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:43,560
I took you there
just to make you identify him.

86
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,540
He's Old Chief.

87
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,260
But why is he unconscious?

88
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:52,800
He had a car accident

89
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,400
and is in a vegetative state.

90
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,260
What's a vegetative state?

91
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,000
He can't talk

92
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,200
or move.

93
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,800
But his mind is still conscious.

94
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,300
Then what?

95
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,600
Can he wake up?

96
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,480
I don't know.

97
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,200
It's been seven years.

98
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,300
Seven years?

99
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,640
Old Chief left me seven years ago.

100
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,040
Old Chief.

101
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:27,640
Old Chief!

102
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,820
Old Chief!

103
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,000
Weird.

104
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,380
Where's he?

105
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:39,350
(To Wanwan)

106
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,400
To Wanwan?

107
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:43,380
(Wanwan,)

108
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,740
(when you read this letter,)

109
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:48,060
(I've been away from Yunlu Abode.)

110
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,760
(I'm gonna enjoy my life.)

111
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,640
(And you'll be the new chief.)

112
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,040
(I left you the Secret Realm.)

113
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,900
(Remember to practice in it.)

114
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:03,840
(Work hard, girl.)

115
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,900
(Don't look for me.)

116
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:08,410
Since that day,

117
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:10,790
I've never seen him again.

118
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,560
Since I became an attorney,

119
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,240
I've never seen anyone make up so much.

120
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,740
What did I make up?

121
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,640
I even doubt if he's your real grandpa.

122
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,100
You didn't cry at all!

123
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,240
You can cry for him.

124
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:27,760
But I won't.

125
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,300
No need of that.

126
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,500
What's the point of the treatment, then?

127
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:37,700
It's my duty.

128
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,140
And that's all it is.

129
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,440
Why?

130
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,160
He hates me.

131
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,240
Why did you take me here?

132
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:08,660
Before recalling the password,

133
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:09,600
you're not going anywhere.

134
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,640
Zheyuan.

135
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:18,360
I came to make an apology.

136
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:22,100
I was rude.

137
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,760
I brought some cake I made.

138
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,680
Would you like

139
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,200
to taste some?

140
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:29,400
Get in first.

141
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:31,200
OK.

142
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,280
Wanwan,

143
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,000
since you're Grandpa Tang's family,

144
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,860
you're my family, too.

145
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,060
I misunderstood you.

146
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,160
My apologies.

147
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:49,500
I don't care.

148
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,660
After Old Chief wakes up,

149
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,860
I'll take him back.

150
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:55,960
And I won't see you guys anymore.

151
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,300
Yes.

152
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,240
That's right.

153
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:02,700
Zheyuan,

154
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,400
I made Provence vanilla macaron

155
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:08,900
with Saint-Honoré cream

156
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,600
and Paris-Brest green tea.

157
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,500
It's tasty. Give it a try.

158
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,560
I don't eat sweet food.

159
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,640
You taste some.

160
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,440
Oh, my poor memory.

161
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,740
I forgot Wanwan was our guest

162
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:27,760
and should taste it first.

163
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,900
It's just...

164
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,600
I made a very little cake.

165
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,640
It's not enough, maybe.

166
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,600
Why is it the flavor of green tea?

167
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:40,350
I hate it.

168
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,540
Mengyao,

169
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,160
I'm gonna have a meeting.

170
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,360
How about you leave now?

171
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,800
Zheyuan, focus on your meeting.

172
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,940
Wanwan is new in town.

173
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,760
I'll show her around today.

174
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,130
Don't bother.

175
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:55,980
Zheyuan,

176
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,340
Mr. Chen is here for his property case.

177
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,440
OK. Be right there.

178
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:03,780
And you...

179
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,500
I can go out alone.

180
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,640
Come on, Zheyuan.

181
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,540
Get to your business.

182
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,560
I'll take care of Wanwan.

183
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,840
Ask me if you need to know what to do.

184
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,160
You're quite hospitable.

185
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,040
Let's go.

186
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,600
What is this place?

187
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,160
A low-key but luxury shopping market.

188
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,680
Lucky enough,

189
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,740
someone can get great things here.

190
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,160
What a nice place!

191
