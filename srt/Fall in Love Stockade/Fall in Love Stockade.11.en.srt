20
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:58,600
This dish...

21
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,560
Tastes so familiar.

22
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,200
Did you learn to cook

23
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,020
from Old Chief?

24
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,900
(Is she changing the subject?)

25
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,620
(I won't let her be.)

26
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:12,260
Wanwan,

27
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,420
you asked many private questions.

28
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:15,800
What?

29
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:17,220
You're interested in me?

30
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,800
I don't get it.

31
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,260
I just want to ask you

32
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:24,760
about Old Chief.

33
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:29,620
He never cared about me.

34
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:31,120
To him,

35
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,480
he only cooked to keep me alive.

36
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,100
What about your parents?

37
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:38,460
They died when I was little.

38
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:40,420
Sorry.

39
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:42,000
I didn't mean to...

40
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,940
It's OK. Enjoy the dishes.

41
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:50,520
Have more meat.

42
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,300
(Old Chief said,)

43
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,060
(serving me food and feeding)

44
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,720
(are wicked behaviors.)

45
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,260
(She's holding my chopsticks)

46
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,920
(and she doesn't find me disgusting.)

47
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,000
(I can't let him be wicked.)

48
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,260
No, thanks.

49
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,800
Keep it to yourself.

50
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,620
(Does she know I like this dish?)

51
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:12,300
(Let's get back, please.)

52
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:22,940
Wanwan,

53
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,060
thank you for serving me.

54
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,280
Is there any wine?

55
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,820
How about you get me some?

56
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,920
Girls shouldn't drink too much.

57
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,160
Have some milk.

58
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,260
Slowly.

59
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,960
How does it taste?

60
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:04,060
Just so-so.

61
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:05,540
I don't know

62
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:08,160
why nobles in our world love to drink this.

63
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,820
What are we going to do after dinner?

64
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,460
Grandpa's old stuff is in the study.

65
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:21,600
Let's go check it.

66
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:26,700
Here we go.

67
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,220
But I'm not finished yet.

68
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,060
Why is there no light?

69
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,420
No one has lived here for years.

70
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,340
Guess.

71
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:07,960
Is this house haunted?

72
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,420
Nonsense. There are no ghosts.

73
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,360
Lights fused, I guess.

74
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:21,460
He-he.

75
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,620
Why aren't you scared at all?

76
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:26,720
Am I not frightening?

77
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,760
Not at all.

78
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,400
Check if you don't believe me.

79
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,140
Wanwan. Wanwan, it's me.

80
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:39,920
Get down.

81
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:43,180
No. That's scary!

82
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,080
Fine.

83
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:48,300
Let's go.

84
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,260
It's really dark.

85
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,700
I visited this room when I was little.

86
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,620
I remember there were collected books,

87
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:05,760
and some displays.

88
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,300
This box...

89
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,800
Old Chief, what's this?

90
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,960
Something very important.

91
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,620
I kind of saw it in Old Chief's painting.

92
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,720
It's quite an old box.

93
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,780
I've never seen it before.

94
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:03,260
Whatever.

95
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,820
Let's open it.

96
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,340
You...

97
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,280
You can unlock it?

98
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,580
Yes, of course.

99
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,260
Wanna learn it? I can teach you.

100
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,720
The inner part rusted.

101
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,920
I can't open it.

102
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:32,950
It doesn't matter.

103
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,760
Buy a tool tomorrow and lever it open.

104
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,540
(Those who stare at you)

105
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,660
(and often blush)

106
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,300
(are all wicked.)

107
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,280
Wicked guy!

108
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,360
Wanwan, did you get me wrong?

109
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,700
- How dare you!
- What are you doing?

110
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,380
- Why is this happening?
- Stop there!

111
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,200
Watch this!

112
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,200
Confess.

113
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,960
What on earth do you want?

114
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:08,460
This is what I want to ask you!

115
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,060
Deliberate harm is illegal!

116
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,460
I... I'm telling you.

117
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,060
A wicked man like you also...

118
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,720
Flirted.

119
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,820
Why am I wicked?

120
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:20,860
What did I do?

121
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,780
You blushed when you stared at me.

122
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:23,660
Your eyes...

123
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,560
Your eyes seem to be adoring.

124
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,280
You served me dishes

125
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:28,680
and stroked my head.

126
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,080
When you talked to me, your voice was...

127
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,460
Was... Was sweet.

128
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,660
You covered me up and praised me.

129
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:37,080
When... When did I do that?

130
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,260
You did that, everything!

131
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,420
You're just wicked!

132
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:41,260
Go!

133
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:42,800
Hurry!

134
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,330
No, I... What did I do?

135
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,620
What makes me wicked?

136
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,780
Who told you that?

137
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,620
Old Chief did.

138
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:49,580
You're having

139
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,580
no male virtues!

140
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:52,920
Male virtues?

141
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,720
What's that in your mind?

142
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,760
You sound like a remnant
of the middle ages.

143
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,120
You!

144
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:01,580
What?

145
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:03,020
It's a new era!

146
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,620
Stop that abstinence thing!

147
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,780
No wicked thing! No male virtues!

148
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,120
Lin Wanwan, listen.

149
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,060
This is the purest love in the world.

150
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,880
Male virtues are nothing!

151
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,060
What do you mean?

152
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,580
I didn't get it.

153
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:18,820
Lin Wanwan,

154
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,140
if one can't follow

155
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,520
his truest feelings,

156
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,720
he doesn't deserve to be a man!

157
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,020
Right.

158
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,360
I'm fascinated by you

159
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,560
and I want to be with you!

160
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,400
