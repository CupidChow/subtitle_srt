I'm fascinated by you

22
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,100

23
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:00,940
Any problem?

24
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,290
But just now, you said... You didn't...

25
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,400
Just now, you pinned me

26
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,340
and I couldn't move.

27
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:06,240
Why would I confess?

28
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,260
But Old Chief said...

29
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:08,520
Why must you follow his every word?

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,200
What if he never had a love

31
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,200
or understood love?

32
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,860
Why don't you ask yourself?

33
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:22,260
When we're together,

34
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
do you not feel happy?

35
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:35,020
Do I not feel happy?

36
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,640
I...

37
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,900
I don't feel bad.

38
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,160
So, not all his instructions

39
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,220
are correct.

40
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,840
I...

41
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,620
I'll let it go, for now.

42
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,900
But it doesn't mean you're right.

43
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,900
Lin Wanwan, listen.

44
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:22,960
From now on,

45
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,980
don't describe my feelings for you

46
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,040
as wicked behaviors.

47
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:29,860
OK.

48
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,900
I won't use that word anymore.

49
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,280
Don't you give me an answer?

50
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:46,920
I'm not sure.

51
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,000
That's not an answer.

52
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:49,720
Options of yes or no.

53
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,360
After all these days,

54
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,000
do you have no feelings for me?

55
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,600
No.

56
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:02,300
Oh, I... I mean... Come on.

57
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,520
I don't mean that.

58
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,560
All I want now is to save Old Chief

59
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,320
and men of my abode.

60
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,620
I never thought about the love thing.

61
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,360
I get it.

62
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:23,660
You don't like me.

63
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,520
Come on. I don't mean that.

64
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:32,860
Don't be like this.

65
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,020
Looks as if I bullied you.

66
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:37,860
Oh.

67
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,720
This is what I hate.

68
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,800
See?

69
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,600
Neither you nor I are happy now.

70
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:47,700
Why did you do this?

71
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,660
Why did you confess your love?

72
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,200
Why did you make everything such a mess?

73
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,100
Mess?

75
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,600

No, no.

77
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:19,800
I said the wrong thing again.

78
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,640
I didn't mean...

79
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,800
Don't be angry.

80
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,160

take her to a restaurant,

110

and confess love

111

117
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,620

118
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,000

143

00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,960
He brought back his mistress
even before getting married.

146
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:59,320
Isn't he an attorney in the city?

147
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,820
Yes, but so what?

148
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,600
He doesn't even make as much money

149
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,960
as his Internet celebrity girlfriend.

150
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:05,660
