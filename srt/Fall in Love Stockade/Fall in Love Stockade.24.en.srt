20
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,960
Look, the stars are gorgeous.

21
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,060
They never change
even through billions of years.

22
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:10,820
Either in your era

23
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,860
or mine,

24
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,620
we look at the same starry sky.

25
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:17,940
Yes.

26
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:21,120
The stars can connect us

27
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,520
through time and space.

28
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:27,200
In the future,

29
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,860
if you meet someone you like,

30
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,260
you can be with her.

31
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,420
But not someone like Zhuang Mengyao.

32
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:38,820
You can hold her hand,

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,060
kiss her,

34
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,720
buy her pretty dresses,

35
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,820
and go...

36
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,660
Go traveling with her.

37
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,260
You can do a lot of things with her.

38
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,260
But you can't...

39
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,360
You can't watch the stars with her.

40
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,520
Because the stars belong to us.

41
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,940
I won't watch stars anymore.

42
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:31,700
Lin Wanwan,

43
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,300
I'm fascinated by you

44
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,540
and I want to be with you!

45
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:35,380
Any problem?

46
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,040
But

47
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,640
our relationship is destined to end.

48
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,260
Do you still want it?

49
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:42,800
Why did you do this?

50
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:44,760
Why did you confess your love to me?

51
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,260
Why did you make everything a mess?

52
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:48,900
Do you have to go back there?

53
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,800
Yes.

54
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,660
Then, I will get

55
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,640
this box.

56
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:55,960
Listen.

57
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,960
I like you.

58
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,540
Every time I see you,

59
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:00,740
my heart thumps.

60
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,860
When I can't see you, I miss you.

61
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,640
I want to be with you.

62
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,100
And I never want to leave you.

63
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,640
Are you marrying me?

64
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,440
From this moment on,

65
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:17,540
you're my husband.

66
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,760
In either your era

67
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,860
or mine,

68
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,660
we look at the same starry sky.

69
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,640
Tang Zheyuan.

70
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,440
I'm still confused

71
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:35,940
about something.

72
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,120
About what?

73
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,500
I keep thinking

74
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,880
Old Chief disappeared seven years ago

75
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,080
when your grandpa fell into a coma.

76
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,280
They must be related.

77
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,700
Song Jingyu and I traveled here
at the same time.

78
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,640
But he landed three years ago.

79
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:55,880
It means our timelines varied.

80
00:03:58,700 --> 00:03:59,940
Maybe you came here,

81
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,440
just to meet me.

82
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,940
I just think

83
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,840
I'm almost reaching the answer.

84
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,440
But I just didn't get it.

85
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,520
Stop thinking.

86
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,340
Why haven't they come yet?

87
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,180
They can't have eloped, huh?

88
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,040
Regret not seeing her these days, huh?

89
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,900
I don't care about these days.

90
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,200
If we can go back to our world,

91
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,300
I can spend every day with Chief Lin.

92
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:42,610
That's not gonna happen.

93
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,000
What took you so long?

94
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,840
Three minutes to go.

95
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,380
As I count down, you open the box.

96
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:04,540
Tang Zheyuan,

97
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,840
keep this book.

98
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,480
It contains all martial arts of my abode.

99
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,900
Practice it every day.

100
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,300
When I'm away,

101
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,280
I don't know...

102
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,400
I don't know who else can protect you.

103
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,680
Wanwan,

104
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,440
thank you for this book.

105
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,400
Thank you for taking me to Old Chief.

106
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,120
Thank you

107
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,840
for getting the evidence
for Chens's Property Case.

108
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,800
Thank you for taking me.

109
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,440
Thank you

110
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,380
for drawing the map

111
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,120
so that I vindicated my father.

112
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:56,880
Tang Zheyuan,

113
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,200
I know what is weird.

114
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:06,690
Time's up.

115
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,000
Lin Wanwan, open the box.

116
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,500
Tang Zheyuan, let go of her.

117
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:14,350
(Magnificence)

118
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:15,490
Hurry!

119
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,900
Miss it and you can't go back home!

120
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,980
Who would remember your house?

121
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,880
Who would remember that map?

122
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,380
Who would show me this world?

123
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,380
Hurry, Wanwan.

124
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,340
Come on. Song Jingyu, hurry!

125
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,160
Wanwan.

126
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,700
Wanwan!

127
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,320
Wanwan!

128
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,140
Wanwan!

129
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,720
Wanwan!

130
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,120
Wanwan!

131
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,020
Sir.

132
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:41,980
Umm...

133
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,240
Sir,

134
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,940
could you tell me where I am now?

135
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,100
The Xuan Dynasty.

136
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,140
Xuan Dynasty?

137
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:51,710
Yeah.

138
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:52,940
What's wrong, young man?

139
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,280
You wear such strange clothes.

140
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,120
Are you all right?

141
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,880
May I ask

142
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:58,900
what year it is now?

143
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,500
Now?

144
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:02,100
The first year.

145
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,640
(Wanwan told me)

146
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,040
(she was born in the first year
of Xuan Dynasty.)

147
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,940
Could you tell me

148
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,240
how I can get

149
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,080
to Yunlu Abode?

150
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,500
Yunlu Abode?

151
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,340
Here...

152
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:14,780
Here is Yunlu Mountain.

153
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,580
But no such thing as Yunlu Abode.

154
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:17,980
Weird.

155
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,400
The first year of Xuan Dynasty?

156
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,280
Yunlu Mountain?

157
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:30,410
(18 years later)

158
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:36,850
(Yunlu Abode)

159
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:47,680
Chief,

160
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,580
we've taken all refugees
from down the mountain.

161
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,080
A new notice was posted.

162
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,280
The new District Defender Song Jingyu
announced it for his people.

163
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,780
(It's been 18 years.)

164
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:59,080
(And it's him, as expected.)

165
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,080
From this day on, the reform
will be carried out.

166
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,680
The county government offers
employment guidance,

167
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,680
skill training,

168
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,100
and job opportunities.

169
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,040
Citizens are encouraged to work.

170
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,340
Those who willingly wear local clothes

171
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,700
to present local customs,

172
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,680
traditional etiquettes,

173
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,900
food cultures, or other living styles

174
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:17,200
will be rewarded accordingly.

175
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:20,410
The government shall
actively get investments

176
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,880
and develop the local economy

177
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:24,860
through social
and diversified investment.

178
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:26,020
(Wanwan,)

179
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,040
(I've been waiting for 18 years.)

180
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,340
(Finally, I heard about Song Jingyu.)

181
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:31,920
(But you...)

182
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,880
(When can I get news about you?)

183
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,770
Chief, Chief.

184
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,680
Chief,

185
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:40,080
something unusual is happening
in the Secret Realm.

186
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:42,990
(Secret Realm)

187
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:46,980
(No way.)

188
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,840
(Once it collapses,)

189
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,940
(Wanwan will not come back.)

190
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,540
(The box...)

191
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,100
