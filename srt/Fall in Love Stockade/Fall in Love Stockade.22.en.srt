Why is it you again?

21
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,200
The tap in my room doesn't work.

22
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,260
Having a death wish?

23
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,300
Even I know you should get room service.

24
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:13,400
The phone can't work, either.

25
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,240
Right.

26
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:15,560
Room 150.

27
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,760
The tap doesn't work.

28
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,820
Please go check it.

29
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:24,760
Done. You can leave.

30
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,480
Now, no one will disturb us.

31
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:46,600
I got some food delivery.
Would you like some?

32
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,920
Why is he here again?

33
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,120
I'm so bored.

34
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,180
Come out and talk with me.

35
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:55,300
I bought poker cards.

36
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,260
Come out and play.

37
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:58,500
If he wants to listen,

38
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,060
let him be.

39
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:02,540
Smells great.

40
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,580
Come out and eat.

41
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,740
Look, someone slept poorly last night.

42
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,140
Yeah.

43
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,200
A dog was barking next door.

44
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:26,800
Really?

45
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,340
But I didn't hear.

46
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:30,200
He means

47
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,040
someone is even poorer than a dog.

48
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:32,920
Who?

49
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,640
That's pathetic.

50
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,140
Wanwan, sit here.

51
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,920
Wanwan, have some milk. It's healthy.

52
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,080
She's allergic to milk.

53
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,800
Here. Have some juice.

54
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,480
Stop it, both of you.

55
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,240
I'm going to the bathroom.

56
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,200
Now, you only focus on your pleasure.

57
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,800
What about Wanwan's reputation?

58
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:10,940
How can she get married
after she's back?

59
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,340
Funny.

60
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,300
It's the problem of your world.

61
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,040
Why must Wanwan sacrifice
her happiness for that?

62
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,680
You...

63
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,740
You imagined

64
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,400
Wanwan would marry
someone else back there?

65
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,700
All I want is her happiness.

66
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,260
What happiness?

67
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,300
I mean

68
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,840
I want you to be happy

69
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,160
whenever you're with me.

(Outpatient Gate No.3, Block D)

71
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:54,600
It's been days.

72
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:56,860
And you've recovered a lot.

73
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:00,700
Old Chief,

74
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,800
can you remember me now?

75
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,040
You...

76
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:12,920
Are you Zheyuan's

77
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,930
girlfriend?

78
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,860
No, Old Chief.

79
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,060
It's me.

80
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,360
Wanwan.

81
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,160
Can you remember?

82
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:29,780
I...

83
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:31,660
I'm not

84
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,640
your Old Chief.

85
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:35,940
That's impossible.

86
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,040
Do...

87
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,160
Do you have a brother?

88
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,940
Anyone who looks like you?

89
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,400
If he doesn't have a brother,

90
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,000
who else may look like him?

91
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,560
Maybe

92
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,000
after you came here,

93
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,540
you found the one

94
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,240
you were really supposed to see.

95
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,680
Grandpa.

96
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:11,500
Wang Ying called me.

97
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:14,920
What?

98
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,540
So soon?

99
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,680

103
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,400
go to the south of Mount Wangqing

104

with this box.

105
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,860
Maybe you can return

106
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:39,700
to when and where

107
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,560
you had the time travel.

108
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,360
Three days?

109
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,400
Are you sure?

110
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:47,180
Mm.

111
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,100
If you miss this chance,

112
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:49,940
the next one

113
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:51,840
may be a hundred years later.

114

115
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:56,260
