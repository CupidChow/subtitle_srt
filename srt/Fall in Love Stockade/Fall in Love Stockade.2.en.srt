Glad to hear that.

22
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,020
Who are you?

23
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:08,420
What's the password?

24
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,660
I'm the Chief of Yunlu Abode.

25
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,720
But unfortunately,

26
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,160
I was kidnapped here.

27
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:27,680
Fine, fine.

28
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,380
Anything you want,

29
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:31,680
I'm ready.

30
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:35,420
I don't have time for your silly words.

31
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:37,760
You trespassed on my place.

32
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:39,380
For this alone,

33
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,080
you may be imprisoned or detained
for up to three years.

34
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,420
You better tell me the password.

35
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,160
What?

36
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,660
Say it again.

37
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,960
Hey, let me do it.

38
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,320
Hello, ma'am.

39
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:57,080
We're with Shashi Law Firm.

40
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,380
We deal with bad guys for people.

41
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:00,980
I have something to ask you

42
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,380
and hope you can answer honestly.

43
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,180
Deal with bad guys

44
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,920
for people?

45
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:08,960
Defendant,

46
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:11,320
you trespassed on someone else's place.

47
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:15,040
You may be imprisoned or detained
for up to three years.

48
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:16,740
You better confess.

49
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,600
All right, I'll confess.

50
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,940
(Defendant, Plaintiff)
Who are you playing, Old Chief?

51
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,640
I'm personifying justice.

52
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:28,040
To deal with bad guys for people.

53
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:30,000
Just like a local lawyer.

54
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,260
Oh, I get it!

55
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,400
You're a lawyer.

56
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,200
You should have told me.

57
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,360
(What's she doing?)

58
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,020
(Playing dumb.)

59
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:42,660
You!

60
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,720
In broad daylight,

61
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,920
how dare you strip me?

62
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:45,860
I'll fight you!

63
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:46,750
We didn't.

64
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,600
Hey, calm down, ma'am.

65
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,120
What are you doing? Stop!

66
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:02,540
Watch out!

67
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,040
Freeze, everybody!

68
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,440
(Just now...)

69
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,740
I'm the Chief of Yunlu Abode.

70
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,100
(She called herself Chief.)

71
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,000
Chief,

72
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,000
I have something to tell you.

73
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:24,900
Don't be dramatic!

74
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:25,960
Oh, OK.

75
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,800
Chief, my female disciple

76
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,400
changed your clothes.

77
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:33,400
I'm a great doctor here,

78
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:36,360
descendant of Hua Tuo.
[*Great doctor in ancient China]

79
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:37,420
All right.

80
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,560
I always respect doctors.

81
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,080
Greetings.

82
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,260
Thank you.

83
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,960
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

84
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:44,860
Sorry for being rude.

85
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,760
I'm sorry, too.

86
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:46,880
Sorry for that.

87
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,260
It's OK.

88
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,180
And those two guys...

89
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:53,300
I have something to tell them.

90
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,880
Chief, you stay for some rest.

91
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:55,740
All right.

92
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:58,060
Go.

93
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,260
Oh, it's extendable.

94
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:06,080
She's suffering from
short-term memory loss.

95
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:06,920
What do we do?

96
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:08,380
Take her where she lost her memories

97
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:09,680
to stimulate her cerebral nerves.

98
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,520
It may work.

99
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:13,530
(Outpatient)

100
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,080
Are you really a lawyer?

101
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,500
And the other man...

102
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,980
Is he a lawyer, too?

103
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,820
Didn't the doctor just confirm that?

104
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,760
(Oh, my God.)

105
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:34,460
(It's exactly like what Old Chief described.)

106
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:38,460
Get in the car.

107
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:41,740
What?

108
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,240
Why are you pulling me?

109
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,460
Let me go!

110
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,000
Old Chief,

111
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,600
what are you drawing?

112
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,580
It's a car.

113
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,740
Just like our carriages,

114
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,280
it's a kind of vehicle.

115
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,180
Car?

116
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,320
That car looks bigger

117
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,380
than yours.

118
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,980
It looks more rugged, too.

119
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,180
So, you can't be very rich.

120
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,020
Mm.

121
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,760
(I'll hold my anger.)

122
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,680
(So, this is the other world
Old Chief talked about.)

123
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,640
Buckle up.

124
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:44,960
This is ridiculous.

125
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,380
I don't think I can't sit tight.

126
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:54,520
What are you doing?

127
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,300
What's going on?

128
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,360
Lin Wanwan, what are you doing?

129
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:08,980
What's wrong?

130
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,840
Don't throw up in my car.

131
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,980
I won't throw up.

132
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,580
Don't throw up in my car!

133
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,380
