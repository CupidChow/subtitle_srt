Tang Zheyuan!

No case can be verified, though.

23
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,040
Tang Zheyuan,

24
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,160
what's your...

25
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,000
E...

26
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:06,120
Email.

27
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,760
56283451.

28
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:08,880
OK.

29
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:16,300
They said it was sent

30
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,120
to your email.

31
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,420
Check your phone.

32
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:23,260
Did you receive it?

33
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,060
What did you do to them?

34
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,100
I've learned some interrogation skills

35
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,620
from my uncles.

36
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,600
Don't worry.

37
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:32,560
I'd be gentle.

38
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:34,300
Let me check on them.

39
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,520
His file is indeed comprehensive.

40
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,460
How did you know

41
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,920
he carried something I needed?

42
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,820
They came for the statement.

43
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,760
So,

44
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,960
they needed someone to verify it.

45
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:58,760
It's something confidential.

46
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,420
Only trusted members could know.

47
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:03,540
Check it.

48
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,600
Is it useful?

49
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,280
Yes.

50
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,300
Oh, good.

51
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:08,760
Now,

52
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,000
they'll be detained

53
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,980
until the court trial is held.

54
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,200
We don't call it "court trial".

55
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,460
Just court.

56
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,460
How did you make Zhuang Mengyao
do the live show?

57
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,300
How did you know she could do that?

58
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,740
Well...

59
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,340
Welcome to watch Mengyao's Gossip Time.

60
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:35,640
I had some breaking news today.

61
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,540
As soon as I hear it,

62
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,360
I came to share it with you.

63
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,840
Give me more "likes", please.

64
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,040
And be my followers.

65
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,280
Thank you, sweeties.

66
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,330
(Zhuang Mengyao, artist)

67

Live broadcast

68
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,440
can be done like this?

69
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,340
Do as I told you.

70
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:06,640
I'll let go of what happened last night

71
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,660
and even promise you

72
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,640
to stay away from Tang Zheyuan.

73
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,160
Otherwise,

74
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,360
I have other ways to deal with you.

75
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,460
But in this case,

76
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,300
Zheyuan will lose the lawsuit.

77
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,960
So what?

78
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:20,740
From this day on,

79
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,160
he'll be yours.

80
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,240
If he loses because of me,

81
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,760
how would he forgive me?

82
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,100
That's not a problem.

83
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,800
Cooperate with me

84
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:31,900
and let's do a drama.

85
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,140
Do as I told you.

86
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,200
Otherwise...

87
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,100
OK.

88
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:42,460
Your call.

89
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,540
Calm down.

90
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:51,940
Hello,

91
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,000
everyone.

92
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:56,340
The Chens' Property Lawsuit is making a stir.

93
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,600
You must have heard about it.

94
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,040
More "likes".

95
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,800
Done.

96
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,560
Show this to him

97
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,060
and he'll believe you.

98
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,700
So, you had that broadcasted

99
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:14,760
just to lure those guys

100
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,060
and get the evidence I need.

101
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,840
But why didn't you tell me before?

102
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,140
Hello,

103
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,340
Mengyao.

104
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,500
What's up?

105
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,000
Lin Wanwan, I did what you asked me to.

106
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,200
Now, you have to leave Tang Zheyuan.

107
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,240
I can't.

108
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:41,440
I just got the new evidence for him.

109
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,660
Thank you for your help, though.

110
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,300
Lin Wanwan, you fooled me!

111
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,260
Yes, I did.

112
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,960
I always make my own karma.

113
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,660
- Don't you remember?
- Lin Wanwan, just you wait!

114
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,040
If I had told you before,

115
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,600
how could I fool her?

116
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,300
We're not in a relationship.

117
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,540
She isn't my girlfriend.

118
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,760
But you did me a big favor.

119
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,260
If you need anything,

120
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,360
I can...

121
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:18,140
Old Chief is still in a coma.

122
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,900
I can't get any information

123
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,960
and I don't know

124
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,900
how to save my men in my world.

125
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,260
About Grandpa,

126
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:31,540
there's indeed nothing I can do.

127
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,000
But if necessary,

128
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,200
after the Chens' lawsuit is over,

129
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,460
I'll take you to my hometown
for some clues.

130
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,620
(Why is he stroking my head?)

131
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:44,620
(Is he)

132
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,500
(also a wicked man?)

133
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,380
(If he is,)

134
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,420
(why didn't he do anything wicked?)

135
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,460
(If he isn't,)

136
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:57,200
(why did he stroke my head?)

137
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:09,880
Old Chief,

138
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:10,940
what are you doing?

139
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,400
Beat me if you want.

140
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,900
I answer for what I did.

141
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,520
How many times have I told you?

142
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,580
A girl must protect herself!

143
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,120
Whoever flirts with you is wicked!

144
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,740
Why did you totally forget that?

145
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,360
But he didn't do anything to me.

146
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,880
You must catch all those men.

147
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,140
I failed to restrain you.

148
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,480
My bad.

149
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:33,700
My fault!

150
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:34,660
All my fault!

151
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,700
Let's talk.

152
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,220
Listen to me.

153
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,480
You didn't listen to me.

154
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,980
Why would I listen to you?

155
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,540
Don't beat yourself.

156
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,440
I'll listen. I will.

157
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,540
I'll catch all wicked men!

158
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:47,360
Say it again.

159
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,940
I'll catch all wicked men!

160
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,160
That's more like it.

161
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,100
Catch them.

162
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,600
I must listen to him.

163
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:05,260
You... What are you doing?

164
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,600
I... You may catch a cold.

165
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,280
Now that you're awake,

166
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,300
let's eat something.

167
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:16,980
(Wandering eye, wicked.)

168
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,380
I think I should watch him.

169
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,640
I don't know your favorite food.

170
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,140
So, I ordered some casually.

171
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:30,200
Thanks. I don't like
the green tea flavor.

172
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,280
Any other flavors are OK.

173
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,900
Eat more, then.

174
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,940
Spaghetti with this sauce

175
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,840
tastes...

176
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,640
Marvelous.

177
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:47,340
You start to sound like a modern girl.

178
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,440
(Dirt on your lip.)

179
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,140
(Let me wipe it off.)

180
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,100
(He wanted)

181
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,500
(to wipe my lips.)

182
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,480
(That's rather wicked.)

183
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,320
I'm sorry.

184
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,720
No offense. Something dirty on your lips.

185
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:09,680
(I can't be impulsive.)

186
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:12,100
(He's just suspected to be wicked.)

187
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,540
What's wrong?

188
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,340
Nothing.

189
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,200
Well,

190
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,440
