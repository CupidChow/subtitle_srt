1
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:58,820
All of this today

2
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,200
is because of you

3
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,320
Zhuang Mengyao

4
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,160
Stop

5
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,460
Song Jingyu

6
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,260
Ambulance

7
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,520
Zhuang Mengyao has been arrested

8
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:20,660
A formal case will be filed soon

9
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:29,660
Do you need me

10
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,440
to help?

11
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:35,000
It's no big deal.

12
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,220
If you really want to thank me,

13
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,800
why not give me more time

14
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,820
to date Lin Zhaizhu.

15
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:40,500
Get lost.

16
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,420
You two stop arguing.

17
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:48,000
Your hand

18
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:49,800
Do you need to go to the hospital?

19
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,000
Don't let it get worse.

20
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:53,920
Yeah.

21
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,060
Go to the hospital early.

22
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,240
If you go late, the wound will have healed.

23
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,960
No need to make a big fuss.

24
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,160
I trust Lin's medical skills.

25
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,700
They came to help us out of kindness.

26
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,060
And got hurt because of us.

27
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,160
I bandaged him up.

28
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,560
Isn't that normal?

29
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,900
Why are you being so stingy?

30
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,860
Did you hear that?

31
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,120
Don't be so

32
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,300
stingy.

33
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:18,960
Yeah.

34
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,660
They came from far away to help us.

35
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:22,860
We definitely need to

36
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,460
treat them well.

37
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,800
Tang Zheyuan

38
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,460
Jerk

39
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:32,700
Chief Lin

40
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,000
He did it on purpose

41
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,200
On purpose

42
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:44,920
See that?

43
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,420
This is intentional.

44
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,020
You all

45
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,460
Yes

46
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,200
No matter how long I can be with him

47
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,960
I have no regrets.

48
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:57,720
There's no going back.

49
00:02:58,460 --> 00:02:59,320
There's no going back.

50
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,160
Do you know why he's doing this?

51
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:03,120
He just wants you to stay here with him.

52
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,900
What about your brothers at Yunlu Village?

53
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,160
Song Jingyu

54
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,000
Can you stop being so petty?

55
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,320
Who's the petty one here?

56
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,200
Wanwan

57
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,020
I contacted a professional.

58
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,700
They should be able to help you go back.

59
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:19,800
Words alone are not enough.

60
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,880
You think I'll believe just because you said so?

61
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,300
I'll take you to see her tomorrow.

62
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,600
Okay.

63
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,800
Sister Wang Ying

64
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:36,620
Great lawyer

65
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:37,660
Where are the things I asked for?

66
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,000
You didn't even pour us a glass of water.

67
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,760
Oh dear

68
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:40,740
Business first

69
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:41,540
Bring it here

70
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,620
This is the box you wanted.

71
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,920
I brought it for you.

72
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,200
You must be Lin Wanan that He Lei mentioned.

73
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:52,960
This

74
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,020
isn't much different from us.

75
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:56,020
Sis

76
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,580
The difference you mentioned is

77
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,720
No, no, no

78
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:00,560
This should be calculated by generation.

79
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,300
You must be my

80
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:07,360
great-great-grandmother's

81
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,300
Why does that sound like an insult to me?

82
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,200
Alright, Sister Wang Ying

83
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,120
Let's talk business first

84
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,540
This way, please

85
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,060
This box

86
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,520
is just a medium

87
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,720
a positioning tool

88
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,760
The basic reason she came here

89
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,520
is still the celestial anomaly

90
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,500
which altered the Earth's magnetic field

91
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,520
creating a wormhole

92
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,720
According to her recent description

93
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,920
it should be related to sunspots

94
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:38,660
Historically,

95
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,920
there are many records of ancient people observing sunspots with the naked eye

96
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,560
It is speculated

97
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,420
that the next best observation time

98
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:47,520
should be this month

99
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:48,560
So soon?

100
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,720
What about the next time?

101
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,360
The next time might be in a hundred years

102
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,000
So, if we find that thing

103
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:00,700
that thing

104
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,720
and then use this box to locate it

105
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,020
we might be able to go back

106
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,220
That's roughly the logic

107
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,720
As for the specific time and place

108
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,060
We need to calculate carefully to know for sure.

109
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,540
But don't worry.

110
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:14,800
It should be quick.

111
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,960
Do you need me to arrange accommodation for you?

112
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,340
No, thank you, Wang Ying.

113
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,620
We've already booked a hotel.

114
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,120
Thank you.

115
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:30,780
Alright then.

116
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:31,980
Get some rest early.

117
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,740
I won't see you off too far.

118
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:37,380
Hey, hey.

119
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:38,880
So, who am I sharing a room with?

120
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,040
Here.

121
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,180
Your room card.

122
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,300
What do you mean?

123
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,840
There are two rooms, and you don't want to share one with me?

124
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,660
Who wants to share a room with you?

125
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,860
This

126
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:56,740
This you guys

127
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:57,180
Let's go

128
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,020
We finally got rid of that third wheel.

129
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,040
I don't know

130
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,040
if we'll ever get this chance again.

131
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:23,620
Who is it?

132
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:28,340
Um,

133
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:29,380
excuse me,

134
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:31,640
the hairdryer in my room is broken.

135
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,820
Can I borrow yours?

136
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:33,980
Here you go.

137
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:34,780
You can keep it.

138
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,280
I'm so angry

139
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,140
After you just finished

140
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,640
you talked with Sister Wang Ying for so long

141
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,420
what were you talking about

142
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,560
it wasn't that long

143
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:51,340
alright, alright

144
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,540
I asked her

145
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,040
about grandpa's coma seven years ago

146
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:57,980
if it was possible that his consciousness traveled

147
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,380
and what was the result

148
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,300
you were laughed at

149
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:01,780
yeah

150
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,680
because I think

151
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:06,840
it was his consciousness

152
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,280
guiding you here

153
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,940
so I can clear my father's name

154
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:12,940
She

155
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,340
denied it

156
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,180
but I still feel

157
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,320
that someone is guiding us to meet

158
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:21,820
destined

159
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:23,800
we are meant to be together

160
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,920
Who is it now?
