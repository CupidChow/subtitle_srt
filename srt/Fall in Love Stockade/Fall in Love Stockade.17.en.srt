Are you OK?

Yes.

00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,020
Tomorrow,

24
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,060
I'm moving out.

25
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,420
Where will you move to?

26
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,260
Let me help you.

27
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,500
Don't bother. I can do it myself.

28
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:24,000
(This guy)

29
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,100
(is really weak.)

00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,160
(If I leave...)

31
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,000
What's this?

32
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,360
It's...

33
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,160
Martial arts of my abode.

34
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,960
Hee-haw-haw.

35
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:43,220
My point is

36
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,480
an attorney like you

37
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,400
needs martial arts for self-protection.

38
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,460
How about I teach you some?

39
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:49,700
What?

40
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,260
Tang Zheyuan, move.

41
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,660
I am.

42
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,160
I'm moving.

43
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,000
Faster.

44
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:03,360
I'm fast enough.

45
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,000
Can you really do this?

46
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,400
Move.

47
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:09,760
Faster.

48
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,720
Tang Zheyuan, you're so weak.

49
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,260
Lin Wanwan, how heartless you are!

50
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,620
It's been an hour.

51
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,560
Zheyuan!

52
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:24,660
Zheyuan!

53
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:26,460
Come on, man.

54
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:28,120
Hang in there.

55
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,020
You're almost getting

56
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:31,660
to the first level of Yunlu Marital Art.

57
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,100
Hurry. Get up.

58
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,320
Punch me hard.

59
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,220
Hurry.

60
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,400
I brought you the hard drive.

61
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,000
I'll... I'll just leave it here.

62
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,200
I've got business. I should go.

63
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,020
I didn't hear anything.

64
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,040
One more time.

65
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:52,900
The hard drive is here.

66
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,000
I'll do business first.

67
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:03,200
But learning martial arts
is also business.

68
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:04,500
Don't you know?

69
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,680
When I'm away,
I'll still worry about you.

70
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,060
What?

71
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,360
Any clues?

72
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:26,540
Still checking.

73
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,560
Too many files in it.

74
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,240
Found it.

75
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,100
Huangping Town?

76
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,060
It's a hidden file.

77
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,760
So, Old Chief got the map

78
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,520
from this file.

79
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,320
"A female tourist
went missing in Bafang Town.

80
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,360
I have to record this.

81
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,120
If something happens to me,

82
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:02,460
hope someone can read this diary."

83
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,320
(I didn't expect)

84
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,520
(Zhuang Danian,)

85
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:08,200
(the friend who grew up with me, would...)

86
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,620
You didn't do this kind of thing before!

87
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,260
When you were out there for four years,

88
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,800
- what were you doing?
- I...

89
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,640
Tang.

90
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:17,120
Why do you do illegal things?

91
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,160
Tang, you're from a rich family.

92
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,320
Your father loves you, too.

93
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,160
You can't understand.

94
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,600
I finally found a rich woman.

95
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,820
When she gives birth,

96
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,820
her parents will have to approve.

97
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,060
I promise you.

98
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,260
It's the last time.

99
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:30,600
I won't do it ever again.

100
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,820
Tang, I beg you.

101
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,000
It won't work.

102
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,700
- Tang...
- You have a daughter.

103
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,900
- When you do the trafficking of women,
- Tang,

104
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,620
- how would you face her?
- I had no choice.

105
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:39,820
Don't you feel ashamed?

106
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,260
Tang, I'm begging you.

107
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,120
What are you doing?

108
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,760
- Let go of her!
- Don't pull me!

109
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,590
- Let go of her!
- Tang, stay out.

110
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,760
I'm begging you.

111
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,600
Help!

112
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:49,740
Tang,

113
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,100
I begged and begged

114
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,600
until they promised to let you live.

115
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,560
Get some sleep!

116
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,920
(I figured out)

117
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,960
(the buyer is in He Village,
Huangping Town.)

118
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,520
(When I call the police and get her out,)

119
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:05,820
(I'll have evidence)

120
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:06,760
(against them.)

121
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:10,620
(Zhuang Danian won't make more mistakes.)

122
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,930
(Attribute)

123
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,940
(August 14, 1998.)

124
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,210
(Hide, Confirm)

125
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,260
It's the day
my father had a car accident.

126
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:24,980
(Dad,)

127
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,660
(you didn't finish that.)

128
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:27,800
(I'll finish it for you.)

129
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,840
He,

130
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,820
I'll send you something.

131
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,860
Collect the evidence for this case.

132
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,020
What are you doing here?

133
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:54,100
To help you move out.

134
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,460
Is everything ready?

135
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:58,500
Have you taken your luggage out?

136
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,420
If you haven't, I'll do it.

137
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,760
Wait.

138
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:05,900
I'm not moving out today.

139
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,860
Maybe later.

140
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:09,260
- Why?
- Why?

141
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:12,980
You still want him.

142
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:13,920
No.

143
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,250
I've got something to do.

144
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,100
And I'll move out later.

145
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,800
What happened?

146
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,440
Here's your luggage.

147
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,560
It's getting late. You better leave.

148
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,560
Tang Zheyuan.

149
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,520
I've got business to do

150
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,420
and I won't walk you out.

151
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,000
Wanwan,

152
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:46,380

Hello, Zheyuan.

165
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,660
You finally answered.

166
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:21,760
Are you OK?

167
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,240
Still alive.

168
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,060
What have you got yet?

169
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,760
(Conference Room)
I asked around.

170
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,060
But I need more evidence and testimony.

171
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,040
Give me more time.

172
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,220
How many times have I told you?

173
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:32,940
Zhuang Danian said

174
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,460
my father was dating that missing woman.

175
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:36,000
But in fact, that woman was abducted.

176
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,160
I know you're anxious.

177
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,520
But now we need evidence.

178
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:41,520
You can't rush.

179
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,700
But things are very clear now.

180
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,520
And Grandpa's car crash
had something to do with him.

181
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:48,100
Seven years ago, Grandpa
found my father's hidden...
