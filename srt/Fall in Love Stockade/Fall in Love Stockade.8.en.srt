No Book Repository.

21
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,060
Only the Library.

22
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,800
I know what you want.

23
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:06,860
But medicine is rather complicated.

Those taking care of my grandpa

25
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,800
are professional doctors of a lifetime.

26
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,600
How many books do you have to read

27
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,460
before you catch up with them?

28
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,960
What do we do, then?

29
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:21,360
It feels awful to wait all the time.

30
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:26,820
I've been waiting for seven years.

31
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,020
(Because he feels sorry for Old Chief?)

32
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,400
Tang Zheyuan.

33
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,560
You helped me a lot

34
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:48,820
and you gave me this ph...

35
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:49,660
Phone.

36
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,640
Tell me.

37
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:55,400
Is there anything I can do for you?

38
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,040
Yes.

39
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:59,580
Unlock the safe for me.

40
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,920
Just now, I pressed some buttons.

41
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,520
Then it gave that sound.

42
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,460
I was trying to see

43
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:47,850
if I could unlock it with

44
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:49,540
a password.

45
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,300
(Three proofs.)

46
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,480
(If Mr. Chen sent her,)

47
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:09,060
(she wouldn't try
to unlock the safe this morning.)

48
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:11,300
(Second,)

49
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,680
(she was indeed drunk last night.)

50
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,260
(Unconscious, she still tried
to help Grandpa.)

51
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,450
(She couldn't fake that.)

53
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,480
(Third,)

54
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,820
(even He figured out nothing about her.)

55
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,220
(Is she really an ancient?)

56
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:26,160
(Zhuang Mengyao)

57
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,660
(Is there really an ancient abode)

58
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,800
(just like Arcadia?)

59
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,720
Zheyuan, bad news.

60
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:34,580
Check this.

61
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,940
Hello, everybody.

62
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:43,160
Chens' Property Lawsuit is making a stir.

63
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,460
You must have heard about it.

64
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,540
(Mengyao)
I have some insider knowledge.

65
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,160
If you want to know, comment "1".

66
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,160
The attorney for Mr. Chen Senior

67
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,840
is my friend

68
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,560
who got the statement
of his brother's company.

69
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,940
- More people are watching.
- More "likes".

70
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:04,140
There's no way we can keep a lid on this.

71
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,240
How did she know that?

72
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,360
Last night, she tried to hurt Miss Lin.

73
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:09,760
And today, she aimed at you.

74
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:10,960
Why?

75
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,180
Have some water.

76
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,680
Zheyuan...

77
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,320
Who told you

78
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:32,620
about the Chens' lawsuit?

79
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,240
Zheyuan,

80
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,920
you seldom watched my live show.

81
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,060
Zhuang Mengyao,

82
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,600
I don't like to beat about the bush.

83
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:42,400
Tang Zheyuan,

84
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,240
you're so cold, as always!

85
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,400
You never care what happened to me.

86
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,800
All you care about is yourself.

87
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,680
What do you mean?

88
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,640
Ask Lin Wanwan,

89
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,900
your boarder.

90
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,760
Do as I told you.

91
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:06,940
Otherwise...

92
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,740
During my live broadcast,

93
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:10,960
- she was by my side.
- (OK. Your call.)

94
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,840
- I had to say that.
- (Calm down. Hurry...)

95
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,680
Zheyuan,

96
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,560
you know I love you.

97
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:18,700
I'd never do anything harmful to you.

98
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,540
Lin Wanwan isn't a good guy.

99
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,960
Mr. Chen sent her!

100
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
She's been fooling you!

101
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:28,710
(Lingyun Pavilion)

102
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:34,070
(Get rich overnight
Become No. 1 in the world)

103
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,560
I guess I'll get rich overnight.

104
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:47,540
Where have you been?

105
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,360
Why didn't you come back last night?

106
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,640
Peanuts?

107
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,480
Come with me.

108
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,200
Why?

109
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,660
Just come.

110
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,640
And explain everything to me.

111
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,280
- Let me go. What's up?
- Hurry!

112
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,440
What are you doing, Tang Zheyuan?

113
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,560
Don't make me beat you.

114
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,600
You know what you did!

115
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,800
They may come for you anytime.

116
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,680
Leave with me now.

117
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,400
And then tell me everything you did!

118
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,160
Tang Zheyuan, listen.

119
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,000
Go!

120
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:11,680
Tang Zheyuan, stop running.

121
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,800
Wanna run away, Mr. Tang?

122
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,360
You're trespassing on my house.

123
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,140
If I call the police,

124
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,260
none of you can get away!

125
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,400
Mr. Tang, you know what?

126
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,600
In front of violence,

127
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,400
laws sometimes won't work.

128
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:35,940
I know what you want.

129
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,060
But I won't give it to you.

130
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:38,540
Hide behind me.

131
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,060
Pity, then.

132
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,600
The pretty girl behind you

133
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:45,800
will be given to someone else.

134
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,940
Dudes, beat him.

135
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:47,850
Go.

136
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,300
Leave. Don't worry about me.

137
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,300
I'm terribly sorry.

138
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,340
Guys,

139
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,700
go get a doctor.

140
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:11,770
If you're late,

141
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,060
you can't even walk tomorrow.

142
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:15,400
(She seems to have real martial arts.)

143
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:17,660
Put down your weapon

144
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:18,500
and surrender.

145
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,960
Or I would kill him.

146
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,500
Leave! Don't worry about me.

147
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:25,100
Chief, run away!

148
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,240
(I failed to save them.)

149
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:27,440
(But I can save you now.)

150
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,340
A really big salute.

151
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,360
How about you stay and have fun,

152
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,640
gentlemen?

153
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,440
Hello, Wang Ying.

154
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,460
Hi, Mr. Tang.

155
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,840
He told me you wanted to talk.

156
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,600
What for?

157
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,560
According to him,

158
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,180
you know quite a lot about time,

159
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:12,140
celestial bodies, and physics.

160
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,240
So, I want to ask you something.

161
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,240
He flattered me.

162
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,400
Not quite a lot.

163
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,440
I'm just interested.

164
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,320
Go ahead.

165
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:26,360
You think

166
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,860
she doesn't belong in our world?

167
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,040
I do suspect that.

168
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,340
But I can find no evidence.

169
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,140
Based on Einstein's general relativity,

170
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,500
time and space give mutual choices.

171
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:39,540
All over the world,

172
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,640
some people say they had a time travel.

173
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,660
No case can be verified, though.

174
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,200
