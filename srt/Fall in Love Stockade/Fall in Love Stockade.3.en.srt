00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:03,020
Mr. Tang,

21
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:04,480
I'll have this car washed

22
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,620
and sent back tomorrow.

23
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,120
OK.

24
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,440
Go.

25
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,140
Wear the seatbelt every time.

26
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:41,280
Or you would regret it.

27
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,140
And you remember this.

28
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:46,900
If you get this close to me again,

29
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,460
you'd regret it!

30
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,800
(What's all this about?)

31
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,560
(Smells terrible.)

32
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:14,620
Here.

33
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,080
The file.

34
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,220
Now, is it OK?

35
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:30,380
Hey.

36
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:32,060
(It's Old Chief.)

37
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:32,940
What are you doing?

38
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:37,380
It's Old Chief.

39
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:38,660
You know him?

40
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:39,500
Where's he?

41
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,020
It's my grandpa's medical report.

42
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,480
Your grandpa?

43
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,380
He can't be.

44
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:46,420
Wait.

45
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:47,820
He's the Old Chief of my abode.

46
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:50,220
And I'm here to find him.

47
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:51,820
Huang Ergou betrayed us.

48
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,220
He massacred our men with our enemy.

49
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,640
Tell me where Old Chief is!

50
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:56,820
OK, OK.

51
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:00,180
Dirty.

52
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,980
There are two possibilities for this situation.

53
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:07,420
First,

54
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:09,380
she's insane.

55
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,420
What about the second?

56
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:11,920
We're insane.

57
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,560
Stop.

58
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:16,420
Take this.

59
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:17,460
Why?

60
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:18,440
Go get changed.

61
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:21,080
(My clothes aren't dirty.)

62
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,980
(He's so unreasonably moody.)

63
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:27,980
(You'll show your slip someday.)

64
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,280
Are you guys very poor?

65
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:36,000
The clothes are torn.

66
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,300
And short.

67
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,240
And look, a hole.

68
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,240
You're pretending vividly.

69
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,000
You should wear it like this.

70
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:58,860
Lin Wanwan!

71
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:07,240
(Is it another test of Old Chief?)

72
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,960
(Oh, come on.)

73
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,540
Did Mr. Chen send you?

74
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,600
Chen what?

75
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,340
Which abode is he in?

76
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,400
Tell me the password

77
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,840
and I'll tell you where Old Chief is.

78
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,640
I don't know what you're talking about.

79
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:36,540
Since I started to work,
I've never lost a lawsuit!

80
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,440
But because of you, I'm gonna lose one!

81
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,400
You shall be responsible!

82
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,060
Why would I?

83
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,360
You knocked me out first.

84
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:43,740
This is my home.

85
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,800
And you broke in!

86
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,640
Hey, stop arguing.

87
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,480
Come on.

88
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:49,380
Come here.

89
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,840
Did you forget what the doctor said?

90
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,400
We must keep her happy

91
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,340
and relaxed.

92
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:56,540
I know.

93
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,180
Sorry, I lost control.

94
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,000
Let's do this.

95
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,440
She stays and you go back home.

96
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,900
Are you sure you'll take in a mad woman?

97
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:13,900
I'll figure out

98
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,500
if she's really mad.

99
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,740
She's eager to see my grandpa, isn't she?

100
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,540
I'll stay close and check up on her.

101
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:24,700
In this lawsuit,

102
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,460
I can't lose.

103
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,420
I'm Chief Lin Wanwan

104
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,800
of Yunlu Abode, the biggest abode

105
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,940
in southern Hunan.

106
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,740
It's my turn to ask questions, right?

107
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,800
You won't tell where Old Chief is

108
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,700
until I tell you the password, right?

109
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,360
It's a quid pro quo.

110
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:49,180
Made sense.

111
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,700
Martial artists like us

112
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,260
always do this.

113
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,200
Very fair.

114
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,100
How did you get in here?

115
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,600
What do you want?

116
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,760
Come on.

117
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,400
I told you.

118
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,260
Second Uncle betrayed me
and wanted to kill me.

119
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,080
Then I opened the box Old Chief gave me.

120
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,360
Suddenly, a glimmer of white flashed.

121
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,020
Then I ended up in your place.

122
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,180
But the box was gone.

123
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:31,670
If I can't recall it for the moment,

124
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,940
do you offer

125
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:34,600
meals?

126
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,400
Yes.

127
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,760
But when you're at my place,

128
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,700
you have to obey my rules.

129
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,160
OK, OK.

130
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,540
Umm, Mr. Tang,

131
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,140
is Old Chief really your grandpa?

132
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,200
If you mean the man in the photo,

133
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,500
yes, he is.

134
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,280
Oh.

135
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,660
Is he your biological grandpa?

136
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,800
Or what?

137
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,100
A biological father, too?

138
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,700
Is that really funny?

139
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:08,540
Umm...

140
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,420
How can your prove

141
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,280
my grandpa is the man you want?

142
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:15,660
As far as I remember,

143
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,060
on a painting,

144
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,500
Old Chief drew this house.

145
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,300
I kind of remember it.

146
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:23,940
I want some water now.

147
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,360
Where can I get it?

148
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,640
Water?

149
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,400
Oh.

150
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,060
I remember there's a well upstairs.

151
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,500
What well?

152
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:38,820
She must be pretending.

153
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:43,800
Oh, no.

154
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,440
Lin Wanwan!

155
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,680
I told you, huh?

156
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,600
Here it is.

157
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,840
Why did you dump it?

158
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,800
You ruined one of the only 100

159
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,060
globally limited edition mugs

160
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:20,460
that I got after a 16-hour queue
somewhere far away.

161
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,700
And you asked me why I dumped it?

162
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,380
I... Did I?

163
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:24,740
Umm...

164
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,480
Well,

165
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,000
maybe I remembered it wrongly.

166
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,600
I was too young at that time.

167
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:34,740
Old Chief painted a lot of things.

168
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,100
Some I can still remember.

169
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,140
