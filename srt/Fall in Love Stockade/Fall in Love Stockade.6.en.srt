00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,000
Come on, Wanwan.

21
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,000
This doesn't suit you.

22
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:04,800
Go. Let's take a look over there.

23
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,640
But it looks good.

24
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:07,040
- Better there.
- Go.

25
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,020
Too old-fashioned.

26
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,380
Terrible.

27
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:14,820
Go. Let's go ahead there.

28
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:16,630
Don't grab it.

29
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,180
- I want this.
- Let's go.

30
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:20,620
Wow.

31
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,920
So cute.

32
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:24,480
Oh, no. It doesn't suit you.

33
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:26,280
Come on. Let's move ahead.

34
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,320
Go.

35
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,320
Let me check it.

36
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:29,200
Check it over there.

37
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:30,140
Come on.

38
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,780
It's been a while
but I haven't bought anything.

39
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,540
I think I picked nice dresses.

40
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:43,080
Hey. We just want to get you the best.

41
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:46,580
This one looks good.

42
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,020
Wow.

43
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:50,980
What an elegant dress!

44
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:53,460
Wow.

45
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,360
This dress is gorgeous.

46
00:01:59,140 --> 00:01:59,980
Wanwan,

47
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:01,420
it's perfect for you.

48
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:02,580
Perfect for a prostitute.

49
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,320
Like it's made just for you.

50
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,760
It is?

51
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,760
Are you sure?

52
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,120
A dress for showing off.

53
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:14,440
Go get changed.

54
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,280
- OK.
- Go.

55
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,240
Why are dresses in your world

56
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,160
a little bit skimpy?

57
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,060
Come on.

58
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,440
It's the best dress in our world.

59
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:33,620
You'll get used to it.

60
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,380
Put on this pair of shoes

61
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,720
and you'll look better.

62
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,100
Look how clumsily she's walking.

63
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,100
Why can I not walk properly in them?

64
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,420
- Today, we're gonna fool her.
- So scared.

65
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:53,260
Yeah.

66
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:55,440
Why can't I walk steadily?

67
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,240
Are you OK?

68
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:04,840
It hurts.

69
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,600
Such terrible shoes.

70
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:12,580
Wanwan,

71
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:15,420
we picked the shoes for you.

72
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,220
If you don't wear them,

73
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:18,940
we'll be disappointed.

74
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,740
Yes. Such pretty shoes.

75
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,680
If they don't match this gorgeous dress,

76
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,620
that'd be a pity.

77
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,720
That's right.

78
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,480
Then...

79
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,120
It's such a pretty dress.

80
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,520
How about we wear it together?

81
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,880
- No, thanks.
- Madam,

82
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,720
one for each of us. The bill's on me.

83
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,880
No, no, no. We don't deserve it.

84
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,220
If...

85
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,580
If you don't wear it,

86
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,140
I won't, either.

87
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:41,980
We will!

88
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:43,780
We will wear it.

89
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,520
OK.

90
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,320
Good.

91
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:53,840
Totally humiliating!

92
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,680
Go.

93
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:56,380
Cover me. Come closer.

94
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,440
Hey, I don't carry a bag.

95
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,540
Don't pull my bag.

96
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,020
Cover me a little bit.

97
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,160
- How embarrassing!
- Go, go.

98
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,060
By the way,

99
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,720
is there a Book Repository?

100
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,540
What do you want that for?

101
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,180
I want to go through some ancient books

102
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,520
on the vegetative state

103
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:27,780
you told me about

104
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:30,920
and see if Old Chief can wake up soon.

105
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,980
My friends have something else to do.

106
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:37,340
I'll take you to the Book Repository.

107
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,740
Thanks.

108
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,840
This is the Book Repository.

109
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,180
Splendid.

110
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,540
Why is it so noisy here?

111
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:26,850
Pretty, huh?

112
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:31,820
Why are those guys staring at us?

113
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,560
Because we're special.

114
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,080
Then why do they keep drinking?

115
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,740
A rule set by literary people.

116
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,860
One has to drink 24 cups of wine

117
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,380
before entering the Book Repository.

118
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:51,120
We can't break the rule.

119
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:51,960
Go.

120
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,040
Quite an interesting rule.

121
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:03,200
Wanwan, here.

122
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,140
A toast to you.

123
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,360
Come on.

124
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:06,780
You're a cool girl, indeed.

125
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,320
Cheers.

126
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,040
Another toast.

127
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,240
Cheers.

128
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,640
Miss, one more time.

129
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:23,660
Cheers.

130
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,890
- One more.
- OK.

131
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,540
Really nice wine.

132
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,680
(Why can she hold that much?)

133
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:45,740
Cheers.

134
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,460
Why is she down?

135
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,840
I'm going to the toilet.

136
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,220
We shall keep drinking later.

137
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,440
OK.

138
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,440
When I leave my seat,

139
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,640
I'll start all over again.

140
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,420
Here I am.

141
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:30,680
Wanwan,

142
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,880
you can really hold your drink.

143
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,720
Come on.

144
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:34,940
The last round.

145
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:36,080
A toast to you.

146
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,080
You know what?

147
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:43,480
Back in my place,

148
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,180
I could drink really a lot.

149
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,780
I usually drank jars of wine.

150
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,180
And that was...

151
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,360
Piece of cake...

152
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,620
My friend there

153
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,420
is rather wild.

154
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:17,700
Enjoy a great time with her.

155
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:19,700
Got it.

156
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,020
Guys, move.

157
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:22,080
- Coming.
- Coming.

158
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:22,980
(Lin Wanwan,)

159
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,480
(after today,)

160
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,280
(I'll see how you can still
stay with Zheyuan.)

161
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:30,880
Guys, a girl's coming.

162
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,240
Come and enjoy yourselves.

163
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,280
Give us a hand. Don't just sit there.

164
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,560
Oh.

165
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:37,500
Mr. Red Hair got us

166
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,340
a very good girl.

167
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,920
Old Chief said,

168
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,380
men shouldn't be approached.

169
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,180
What chief?

170
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,480
Today, I'm gonna be your chief.

171
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,320
Get her in.

172
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,220
