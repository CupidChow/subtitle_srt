Zhuang Mengyao, what are you doing?

21
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:04,540
Zheyuan,

22
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:06,520
show some mercy on my father.

23
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,060
Trafficking of women is a felony.

24
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,640
He can't get away.

25
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:13,060
Zheyuan,

26
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,060
as long as you let go of my father,

27
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:15,900
tonight...

28
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:17,900
What are you doing?

29
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,560
I know you don't love me.

30
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,160
I offered this.

31
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:24,400
Show some mercy, please.

32
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,780
Calm down. Put your coat on.

33
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,500
- Zheyuan, you'll not be responsible.
- Zhuang!

34
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,100
- Zhuang, cool down.
- No.

35
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,960
- Put your coat on, Zhuang!
- I won't.

36
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,920
What are you doing, Lin Wanwan?

37
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,700
You barbarous woman.

38
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:36,900
Let me go!

39
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,100
Let go of me!

40
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:40,180
What's all this?

41
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:45,620
It's you again.

42
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,460
Why is it always you?

43
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,920
Tang Zheyuan and I grew up together.

44
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:52,320
- Why can you steal him?
- Wanwan.

45
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,160
Your father ruined Zheyuan's family.

46
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,420
How do you have the nerve to come?

47
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:59,360
If this is the way you love him,

48
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,420
I'm gonna steal him now.

49
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:02,660
Go.

50
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,020
Didn't you say you wouldn't be back?

51
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,200
Why are you back now?

52
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,100
What are the candles for?

53
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,460
Wanwan, what are you doing?

54
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:26,960
Let's talk, OK?

55
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,330
Shut up. Stop nagging.

56
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,290
A gentleman...

57
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,560
Wanwan, what's this about?

58
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,120
You spent a million for me.

59
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,240
What?

60
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,820
Whatever era it is,

61
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,920
I should give myself to you, huh?

62
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,660
Before someone else gets you,

63
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,100
I'll get you!

64
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,400
Wanwan, calm down.

65
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,040
Done.

66
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:05,900
Wanwan,

67
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,060
are you marrying me?

68
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:10,040
From this moment on,

69
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,430
you're my husband.

70
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:47,940
I...

71
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,700
I disobeyed Old Chief's instructions.

72
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,500
I married you, the wicked guy...

73
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:55,860
Then...

74
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,120
Then...

75
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,440
Do I have to

76
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:01,820
obey male virtues?

77
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,560
Yes, of course.

78
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,700
But to me, you don't need to.

79
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,900
- My waist...
- What's wrong?

80
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,860
Nothing.

81
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,360
My waist just...

82
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,360
It hurts a little.

83
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,700
What would you like to eat?

84
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:21,820
I'll make some for you.

85
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:23,720
I want...

86
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,020
River snail rice noodles.

87
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,260
Why do you always want such noodles?

88
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:30,460
They taste

89
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,620
like what we've experienced.

90
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,320
(Is she tired of me?)

91
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:35,620
(Do I stink?)

92
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:36,660
(I shouldn't be.)

93
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,460
Very tasty.

94
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,360
OK.

95
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:04,520
Whether I can return home,

96
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,400
I will not love you.

97
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,100
I never planned to be with you, either.

98
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,380
You spent a million for me.

99
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:16,700
Whatever era it is,

100
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,200
I should give myself to you, huh?

101
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:19,740
(Wait.)

102
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,800
(Last night and this morning,)

103
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,220
(she didn't say she liked me)

104
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,200
(or loved me.)

105
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,720
(Is she repaying me for that one million?)

106
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,620
(When do women lie?)
(Don't trust promises during sex.)

107
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,820
(If she doesn't even say
"I love you" during that,)

108
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,000
(would she really love you?)

109
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,720
(We can't be too honest with men.)

110
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,800
(Women are good at)

111
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:48,900
(telling lies.)

112
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,120
(It must be a man.)

113
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:51,960
(Out!)

114
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,660
If I ask her now,

115
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,720
she'll avoid the question.

116
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,560
Tang Zheyuan.

117
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,560
Why are you dressed up differently?

118
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,200
Didn't you say jeans and T-shirt
were perfect?

119
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:06,460
Mm.

120
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,320
I love this new style.

121
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,300
Do I not look good?

122
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,800
You do.

123
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,940
I like every style of yours.

124
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,660
What about you?

125
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,420
I'm going to watch TV.

126
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,720
TV time.

127
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,200
(That was a very unwise move.)

128
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,120
(My willpower failed last night.)

129
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,820
(I should have made us official.)

130
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,500
(In this big world, there are love rats.)

131
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,800
(Pretty women deceive men.)

132
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:41,540
(Oh, such poor men.)

133
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:49,900
What's wrong?

134
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,120
You said you didn't like such noodles.

135
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:55,200
Or I would have left some for you.

136
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,040
No need.

137
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,000
Tell me.

138
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,960
What's our relationship now?

139
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,340
What?

140
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,720
Question in the morning?

141
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,900
Last night, we just...

142
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,560
When you turned me down,

143
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,360
you said I was only a friend

144
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,000
and you had no feelings for me.

145
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,520
Would you do that thing

146
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:15,700
to a friend?

147
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,120
I wouldn't,

148
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,640
with no doubt.

149
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,560
Then tell me what our relationship is!

150
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,060
Make it very clear to me.

151
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:26,460
But...

152
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,100
Our relationship is destined to end.

153
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,360
Do you still want it?

154
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:38,500
I knew it.

155
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,220
