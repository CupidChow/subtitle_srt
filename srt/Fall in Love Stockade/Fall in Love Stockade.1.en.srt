20
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,520
Mr. Tang,

21
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,140
this is a hard-earned statement.

22
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,180
Do not say a word about it.

23
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,660
If it's destroyed,

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,460
we'll have to lose.

25
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,040
After confirmation, I'll back it up.

26
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,860
(Please set a password.)

27
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:29,810
(Someone's in there?)

28
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,410
(Folder)

29
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:34,760
(What is this place?)

30
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:37,580
(Why does it look so weird?)

31
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:44,160
(And this is...)

32
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,300
(It's a hard-earned statement.)

00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,860

(Secret Realm)

37
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,080
The Level 7 mechanism?

38
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,000
It's Old Chief, indeed.

39
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,560
(Password set.)

40
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,060

(1,500 years ago, Chongtian Pavilion)

42
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,440
Let me go!

43
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:39,300
Why am I tied up?

44
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,920
Hey. Stop yelling.

45
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:42,450
You must be new, huh?

46
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,940
How were you caught?

47
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:49,580
I was just proposing to Chief Lin.

48
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:50,900
You had quite a lot of nerve.

49
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,900
I just invited her to dinner

50
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:53,920
and then I was caught.

51
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,500
Wow. I just gave a compliment,

52
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,980
"You wear this amazing dress
to fascinate me, huh?"

53
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:58,900
Then I was caught.

54
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,040
I didn't say anything.

55
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,000
I only stared at her and she got angry.

56
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,200
(She's Lin Wanwan?)

57
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:12,300
- Big.
- Small.

58
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,620
Who allowed you to stop and chat?

59
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,660
Go on to recite it!

60
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,580
Rules for Men.

61
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:18,560
Women are everything.

62
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,620
They have privileges.

63
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,600
Women matter most.

64
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:21,600
They do whatever they want.

65
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,700
(Oh, no. I'm doomed.)

66
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,420
I lost some money just now.

67
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:29,780
Who dares to mess with me?

68
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:30,780
All dresses are for them.

69
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,020
Women are soft.

70
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:32,900
Men mustn't talk back.

71
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:33,740
Come on.

72
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,920
Keep playing.

73
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,760
Come on. Let's bet.

74
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,100
My turn to win, isn't it?

75
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,340
Oh, come on.

76
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:42,780
Wanwan,

77
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,600
Mr. Song is from Canglan Abode.

78
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,440
I finally invited him here.

79
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,280
How could you...

80
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:49,240
But how dare he

81
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,520
made me an offer of marriage?

82
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,700
He's the worst of the worst!

83
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:55,020
Come on. Wanwan, you have no idea.

84
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:57,000
Canglan Abode is very powerful.

85
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,100
If you marry Mr. Song,

86
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,080
we'll get a great future.

87
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,000
I won't.

88
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,080
Old Chief told me,

89
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,040
men

90
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,640
can't be approached.

91
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:11,960
(Today,)

92
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:14,460
(I should break the Level 7
Secret Realm Old Chief set.)

93
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:15,860
So much for today.

94
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,800
I'll quit.

95
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:17,920
I stayed up too late last night.

96
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:18,820
I'm gonna get some sleep.

97
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,060
Take the money.

98
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,780
- Thanks, Chief.
- Thanks, Chief.

99
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:22,620
It's mine.

100
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,820
Today's sunlight

101
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,300
feels a little bit weird.

102
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,300
Red snake.

103
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,600
Candling dragon.

104
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,860
Carduus.

105
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:45,800
Red hibiscus.

106
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,600
This one, I guess.

107
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,820
(Seven)

108
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:09,580
Here, indeed.

109
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:17,230
(Secret Realm)

110
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,420
(There seems to be a big game.)

111
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,080
Come on, Old Chief.

112
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,380
It's the seventh level already.

113
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:09,680
But you still set a puzzle.

114
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:20,020
(What's this?)

115
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,280
(To Wanwan)
Old Chief's letter?

116
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,600
Girl,

117
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,800
you were too slow just now.

118
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:32,180
Did you play too much
and practice too little?

119
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:33,560
Hey.

120
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,760
I didn't loaf.

121
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,260
It took me seven years
to have come this far.

122
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,280
Because you set excruciating traps.

123
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:44,080
I wanted you to be strong enough
for self-protection.

124
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:44,920
Remember.

125
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:47,860
Those who help you for no reason

126
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:48,960
or often flush are wicked.

127
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,280
They're wicked.

128
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:52,820
I must catch them
and show no mercy.

129
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,640
I get it.

130
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,760
You repeated that many times.

131
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:56,780
By the way,

132
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,060
you have to

133
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:59,280
keep this box very carefully.

134
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,320
Remember.

135
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:06,020
The box mustn't be opened
unless it's a bloody crisis.

136
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,900
What are you talking about?

137
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,360
You always say something I don't get.

138
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,600
All right, then.

139
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,240
I'll say no more.

140
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,240
Or you would find me annoying.

141
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,320
I should go.

142
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:21,760
Old Chief.

143
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:33,890
(Yunlu Abode)

144
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,000
Why is there some smoke?

145
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,740
Oh no, something must have happened.

146
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:51,900
What happened here?

147
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:55,280
Xiaoliu. Xiaoliu!

148
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,360
Wanwan.

149
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,400
Wanwan, bad news.

150
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,040
Wanwan.

151
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,120
- Canglan Abode...
- Second Uncle?

152
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,920
They're attacking us!

153
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,540
Song Jingyu,

154
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:11,640
come out!

155
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,040
Chief.

156
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,020
Run!

157
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,480
- Chief, Huang Ergou colluded with our enemy.
- Second Uncle?

158
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,040
Run away, Chief!

159
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,040
Stop, Second Uncle!

160
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,260
Wait, wait.

161
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,540
Oh, Chief Huang,
you didn't need to kill him.

162
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,440
We encourage peace, you know.

163
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:38,680
Song Jingyu,

164
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,240
how wicked you are!

165
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:42,050
I...

166
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,200
Wanwan, you got me wrong.

167
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,040
Mr. Song,

168
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,280
in this case,

169
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:47,800
I don't think

170
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,720
we still need to hide it.

171
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:51,080
You...

172
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:54,000
Wanwan, I care about you.

173
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,200
You're the chief of such a big abode

174
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,200
and it must be hard.

175
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,500
How about you abdicate

176
00:08:58,940 --> 00:08:59,980
to Mr. Song?

177
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:01,460
I...

178
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,120
Don't, Chief Huang!
