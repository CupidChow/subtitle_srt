20
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:00,760
Lin Wanwan,

21
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,780
get up and go.

22
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:04,880
Why so early?

23
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:06,200
My hometown is quite far.

24
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,400
It takes eight or ten hours.

25
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,360
Can we find clues there?

26
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,260
Hope so.

27
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:26,460
You...

28
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:27,940
Are you OK?

29
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:35,940
(What do I do?)

30
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,760
(How shall I deal with him?)

31
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,960
(Clues matter more.)

32
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,720
(I'll deal with him later.)

33
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:43,020
(Come on.)

34
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:49,920
In our opinion,

35
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,260
Lin Wanwan has great martial arts.

36
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,160
But she failed to dodge just now.

37
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,500
Only for one reason.

38
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,260
She's in love with him,

39
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,120
Tang Zheyuan.

40
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,060
I don't agree.

41
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,260
Objection.

42
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,120
Overruled.

43
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:04,980
You...

44
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,340
Zheyuan.

45
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,220
Zheyuan! Get in the car.

46
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,080
Oh.

47
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,560
This town looks a little bit

48
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,760
like my abode.

49
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,400
I left this town at the age of 16.

50
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,660
When I came back, it was seven years ago

51
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,180
after Grandpa had that car accident.

52
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:36,520
If he knew

53
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,320
you were an attorney now,

54
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:39,920
he would be proud.

55
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,460
Maybe...

56
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:52,400
Maybe he would.

57
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:53,980
What's wrong with your neck?

58
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,060
Nothing. It got stiff last night.

59
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,800
You know what?

60
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,840
The neck problem

61
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,020
is very serious.

62
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:01,940
Bear it.

63
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,020
Just a minute.

64
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,280
Ah!

65
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,760
OK?

66
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:15,660
Is it OK?

67
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,300
Let me check.

68
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,060
It's not OK. One more time.

69
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,160
It's OK. It recovered just now.

70
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,040
Save your breath.

71
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:34,000
Yeah, I worked today. So did you?

72
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,840
Glad to hear that.

73
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,160
Hey, look over there.

74
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,600
That jinx young man is back here.

75
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,900
Don't look at him.
It'd take years off your life.

76
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:42,760
You know what?

77
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,560
He's a terrible jinx.

78
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,920
Shortly after he was born,

79
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,820
his parents died.

80
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:47,780
Let's get in there.

81
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:50,040
His grandpa is in hospital.

82
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,500
Bad luck from him, too.

83
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,520
Your house is really big.

84
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,900
Sit anywhere you want.

85
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,000
Too much dirt here.

86
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,480
I haven't been back for years.

87
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,800
Oh, who are those ladies?

88
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,300
And why did they say that?

89
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,700
My parents died when I was little.

90
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,960
I'm used to those comments.

91
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,920
My grandpa raised me, the orphan.

92
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,170
In this town, it's rather a gossip.

93
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,500
How about you take some rest?

94
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,960
I'll call you when dinner is ready.

95
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,300
Tang Zheyuan,

96
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,700
why did you stroke my head?

97
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:01,300
You even hugged me!

98
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,120
This is outrageous!

99
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,700
Hello, He.

100
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,240
Zheyuan,

101
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,080
I showed your video
to the Martial Arts Association.

102
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,800
They said,
it was like a long-lost martial art.

103
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,120
They're very interested.

104
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,060
Could you give more descriptions?

105
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:19,960
Let me think.

106
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:22,420
And you blushed.

107
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:23,760
You blushed twice!

108
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,000
A shameless guy like you

109
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,020
would blush?

110
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,200
You must be pushing it!

111
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,880
I can't even pretend nothing happened!

112
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:33,360
Something like this.

113
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,800
Yes, yes. That's it.

114
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,720
It's a martial art

115
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,420
of bandits on Yunlu Mountain
1,500 years ago.

116
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:40,700
1,500 years ago?

117
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,320
Thank you, He.

118
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,520
I'll buy you dinner someday.

119
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,560
Am I...

120
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,340
Are you OK?

121
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,000
Am I really in love

122
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,120
with an ancient?

123
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,700
Here's our statement.

124
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:05,700
Tang Zheyuan's touch didn't disgust Lin.

125
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,980
It means she's OK with that,

126
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,400
she feels good,

127
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,700
and she wants that.

128
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,400
It's a hint.

129
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,240
Objection.

130
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,100
Don't imagine things.

131
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,120
Come on, I object.

132
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,200
Overruled.

133
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:20,540
You!

134
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,300
Why?

135
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,280
I had some much trouble

136
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,480
finding a reliable man in this world.

137
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,200
And why did he do that?

138
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,880
He's handsome,

139
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,280
but he's wicked, too.

140
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,940
But Old Chief,

141
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,260
when he touched me,

142
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:07,100
why did I not feel disgusted?

143
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,900
This wicked man here

144
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:15,180
looks really handsome.

145
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,500
What a curse!

146
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,680
Wanwan, come for dinner.

147
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,980
So much tasty food delivered?

148
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:33,640
No food delivery here.

149
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,080
(Oh, no.)

150
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,440
(He can't do anything wicked again.)

151
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,840
You made all this?

152
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,300
I've been living alone for many years.

153
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,580
So, I could cook.

154
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,600
But as I got busier, I stopped.

155
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:21,420
This dish...

156
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,180
Tastes so familiar.

157
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,880
But if someone likes these dishes,

158
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,680
I will cook for her.

159
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,540
Did you learn to cook

160
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,140
from Old Chief?
