21

Yeah. Young men nowadays, you know.

22
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,440
- Intentional.
- No manners!

23
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:05,260
Ouch. My leg.

24
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,640
What's wrong with you?

25
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,560
Guys, look.

26
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,220
I was skating.

27
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:14,360
How could I hit him that hard?

28
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,920
You skated, so what?

29
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,260
Look.

30
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:18,540
Look at my knee.

31
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,900
It has bruises all over.

32
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:20,940
Young man,

33
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:22,560
why do you keep denying it?

34
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:23,500
Old man,

35
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,500
stop the drama.

36
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,100
Ouch. My knee.

37
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:26,960
I think

38
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,400
you accidentally hurt your knee yourself.

39
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,000
Ouch!

40
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,220
My knee.

41
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:34,460
Stop it. Stop.

42
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:36,040
Tell me. What do you want?

43
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:39,220
An old man like me

44
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,820
won't give you a hard time.

45
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,620
Give me 5,000 yuan

46
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:43,900
and I'll go see a doctor.

47
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:45,600
5,000?

48
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:47,860
You must be insane.

49
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:50,740
Young guys like you have money
for entertainment,

50
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,800
but not for compensation, huh?

51
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,300
That's right.

52
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,060
Young guys are so rude.

53
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,060
They have no manners.

54
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,000
He should be given a lesson!

55
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,620
Such a gossipy woman!

56
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,080
Don't give the money. He's lying.

57
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,340
Who's this young woman?

58
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,220
(It's her.)

59
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,780
- It obviously appears
- How lawless!

60
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,420
to be an old wound.

61
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,300
It looks scary,

62
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,660
but actually gives no pain.

63
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:21,400
- Stunned?
- Ridiculous!

64
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:24,370
- Or lost your mind?
- I'm such a poor old man.

65
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:27,980
What are you doing here?

66
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,090
I saw a crowd and then came.

67
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,160
You guys,

68
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,720
stop wasting time!

69
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,500
Are you done talking?

70
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:36,620
Will you give me the money?

71
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,320
You're a racketeer.

72
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,620
Why would we give you the money?

73
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,120
Guys, help me out here.

74
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,860
I'm such an old man,

75
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,060
but they call me a racketeer.

76
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,740
- Ridiculous!
- How about this, old man?

77
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,060
I'll take you to get a medical test.

78
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,200
No, no.

79
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,700
I'll go alone later.

80
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,560
Make him give me the money.

81
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,200
This skateboard has a round head.

82
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,560
If it hit you,

83
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,120
the wound should be elongated.

84
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:06,560
So, I'm thinking

85
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,400
what exactly

86
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:10,360
caused such a big wound.

87
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,000
Come on. What are you talking about?

88
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,000
Give me money!

89
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,100
Don't stall for time!

90
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,020
Well, old man,

91
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,700
there is a full-day surveillance camera.

92
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,200
How about we check it?

93
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,200
Then we'll know the truth.

94
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:24,880
Yeah, a camera.

95
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,000
Out of my way!

96
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,860
Out!

97
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:27,700
- He ran.
- He ran away.

98
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,600
So, he's really a racketeer.

99
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,960
Isn't he Tang Zheyuan?

100
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,800
- It's over?
- Go.

101
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,100
He looks decent.

102
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,420
Yeah.

103
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:37,260
Who knows if he's playing decent?

104
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,880
(What's Wanwan's relationship
with this man?)

105
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,220
Come on. Don't be angry.

106
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,340
It's nothing.

107
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,320
I'm so pissed off!

108
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,760
Can people today
not distinguish right from wrong?

109
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,520
Not really.

110
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,500
Some people still stand for justice,

111
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,360
just like you.

112
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:56,560
I do, of course.

113
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,360
In my abode,

114
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:00,220
everyone helps people

115
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:01,400
who are in need.

116
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:04,100
Wanwan, wait here for me.

117
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,320
I'll be right back.

118
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,300
Don't go anywhere.

119
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,400
I don't know what's wrong with people.

120
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,860
If everyone swindled others,

121
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,820
the world would be terrible.

122
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,500
This is infuriating!

123
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,720
I'll punch you.

124
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,060
(I've been here for three years.)

125
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,240
(With some jewels I carried,
I managed to survive.)

126
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,280
(How has she lived?)

127
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,180
I'll punch you hard.

128
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,880
Darn it.

129
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,460
Hi, Chief Lin.

130
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,580
We encourage peace.

131
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:42,800
Don't be angry.

132
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,080
Oh, Chief Huang,

133
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,500
you didn't need to kill him.

134
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,660
We encourage peace, you know.

135
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,400
Song Jingyu?

136
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:55,900
You're dead to me!

137
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,900
(Wanwan will like it, I guess.)

138
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,840
Where's she?

139
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:05,700
Tang Zheyuan,

140
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,220
stop him!

141
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,540
Stop!

142
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,460
Or I'll break your legs!

143
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,680
Wanwan,

144
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,180
I've loved you for a long time.

145
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,280
Will you marry me?

146
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,650
Marry him.

147
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,600
- Marry him.
- Marry him.

148
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:00,090
Kiss her. Kiss her.

149
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,200
I will.

150
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:07,380
Tang Zheyuan,

151
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,200
stop him!

152
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:33,260
Let go of her!

153
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:37,760
How dare you!

154
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,000
Chief Lin!

155
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,540
Chief Lin.

156
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:45,800
You hugged her, huh?

157
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,800
Try it again.

158
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,640
Such a noise.

159
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,040
Untie him.

160
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,480
Why?

161
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:51,700
He's a bad guy.

162
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,640
He isn't.

163
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,640
He was just proposing to me.

164
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,040
And he just pursued,

165
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:01,940
like you said,

166
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:04,840
the most beautiful love in the world.

167
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:05,980
Isn't it...

168
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,600
Isn't it your point?

169
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:10,780
Wanwan,

170
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,440
I mean you should accept my feelings.

171
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,280
But to him,

172
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:17,800
do as Old Chief told you.

173
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,580
Come on. Just let him go.

174
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,860
Tell me. What did you do to my men?

175
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,140
I don't know.

176
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,440
Back then, I saw Huang Ergou dash at you.

177
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,200
Chief Huang, stop!

178
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,400
Then, a glimmer of white flashed.

179
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,260
Then, I ended up here.

180
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,260
So,

181
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,380
you experienced the same.

182
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:14,600
But you worked with Second Uncle

183
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,100
to destroy my abode.

184
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,100
For this, I won't let you go.

185
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:20,780
Chief Lin...

186
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,160
Chief Lin, let me explain.

187
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,000
I did everything

188
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,440
just for one person.

189
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:31,180
Who is it?

190
