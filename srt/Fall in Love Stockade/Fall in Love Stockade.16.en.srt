So what?

21
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,640
No...

22
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,100
Nothing.

23
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:04,100
Chief Lin,

24
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,360
you can't be in love with him.

25
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,920
I'm not!

26
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:11,860
Besides,

27
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:13,160
what does it concern you?

28
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,560
It doesn't concern me.

29
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:18,940
But...

30
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,920
If you're in love with Tang Zheyuan,

31
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,400
what about your men in Yunlu Abode?

32
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,320
They're dying.

33
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,780
You don't need to frighten me.

34
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,600
This world is wonderful.

35
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,420
But Canglan Abode is my home.

36
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:38,260
I will return there someday.

37
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:39,740
Don't worry.

38
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,060
I won't contact Huang Ergou anymore.

39
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,920
But if you don't return,

40
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,860
he'll still occupy your abode

41
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,560
and kill your men who don't surrender.

42
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,640
I know.

43
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,320
But Old Chief isn't awake yet.

44
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:55,960
What if he can't wake up?

45
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:00,860
He will.

46
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,900
He asked me to open the box in danger

47
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:04,920
and come here for him.

48
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,140
So, he will wake up.

49
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:11,000
Because he had that car accident.

50
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,120
I guess he didn't even expect it.

51
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,800
I can't leave him alone.

52
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,580
In this world, life,

53
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,390
civilization, technology, and medicine

54
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,900
are far more advanced than ours.

55
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,260
Which place is better for Old Chief?

56
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,200
You know that very well.

57
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,760
He doesn't need you most.

58
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,600
But your men need you.

59
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,220
Say no more.

60
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,520
I will go back there.

61
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,060
Wanwan,

62
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,260
don't fall in love with Tang Zheyuan.

63
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,260
With someone you miss,

64
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,240
you can't leave.

65
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:51,660
Or

66
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,920
when you leave, you'll feel more pain.

67
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,280
I won't fall in love with him.

68
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,200
I'm in the middle of something.

69
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,920
When it's done, I'll leave.

70
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:13,480
Listen, Song Jingyu.

71
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:17,500
He and I won't be together.

72
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,360
But it doesn't mean I will be with you.

73
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,260
Wanwan,

74
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:34,780
wait for me.

75
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,060
Didn't you promise
to come in ten minutes?

76
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,520
Where are you now?

77
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,600
The car broke down?

78
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:50,960
I often tell people

79
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:51,880
that limos...

80
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,060
Why is he everywhere?

81
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,360
Won't necessarily work very well.

82
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,160
Why are you here?

83
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:58,400
In case Wanwan

84
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:59,620
needs some help.

85
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:00,960
Wanwan,

86
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,600
don't get tanned in the sun.

87
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:03,760
My car is over there.

88
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,660
Let me drive you home.

89
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,560
No, thanks.

90
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,220
My car is arriving soon.

91
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,200
Wanwan,

92
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,120
wait here for me.

93
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:10,300
(Lin Wanwan,)

94
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,520
(you're leaving someday.)

95
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,160
I do have something to tell him.

96
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,860
How about I take his car?

97
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,160
You came here with me.

98
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,560
You leave with me, too.

99
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,920
You can't follow anyone else.

100
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,460
But your car broke down.

101
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,460
How could you drive her?

102
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,360
None of your business.

103
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,480
I want to visit Grandpa in the hospital.

104
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,880
I'm in the middle of something.

105
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,520
When it's done, I'll leave.

106
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,600
Let's go.

107
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:43,720
Go check on Grandpa.

108
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,160
Song Jingyu, shame on you!

109
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,120
Who's your grandpa?

110
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,120
Wanwan's grandpa is my grandpa, too.

111
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:49,360
Didn't you hear?

112
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,960
She said she would take my car.

113
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:52,760
Do you know where she's going?

114
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,320
To my house.

115
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,600
Wanwan can go anywhere she wants.

116
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,440
Go.

117
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,580
She's going to my house.

118
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,520
She'll follow me.

119
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:01,760
- My house.
- Follow me.

120
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:02,630
- To my house.
- Come...

121
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,480
Stop, both of you!

122
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,540
I'll go alone.

123
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,520
See? It's your fault.

124
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:09,490
Yours, actually.

125
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,120
- It's you.
- You.

126
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:15,790
(Silent)

127
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:18,740
(Old Chief,)

128
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,040
(why aren't you awake yet?)

129
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,940
(How can I take you back?)

130
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:35,420
Don't worry.

131
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,640
He's my grandpa.

132
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,680
I'll do my best to take care of him.

133
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,740
You don't need to worry.

134
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,040
I...

135
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,980
I'm not worried.

136
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,000
No need to explain.

137
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:56,220
I can get it.

138
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:03,520
You don't need to be so nice to me.

139
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,780
I didn't ask you to be responsible.

140
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,040
Why could you still restrain me?

141
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,040
Don't be so bossy.

142
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,380
Come with me.

143
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,380
What on earth do you want to say?

144
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,140
You asked me a question.

145
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,580
I can answer you now.

146
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,340
Actually,

147
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:46,800
I only take you as a friend.

148
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,300
I've never loved you.

149
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:51,940
You misunderstood me.

150
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,080
I'm sorry.

151
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:57,100
This isn't what you really mean.

152
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,200
Whatever you may think,

153
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,100
I've decided to move out.

154
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,340
Because of Song Jingyu?

155
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,600
I have nothing to do with him.

156
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:10,980
We just came from the same world

157
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,580
and we can easily communicate.

158
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,340
I heard your conversation.

159
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:20,700
He advised you to return

160
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,100
and you said you wouldn't love me.

161
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,280
I didn't mean to eavesdrop.

162
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,580
Now that you heard us,

163
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,400
I've got nothing more to say.

164
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,180
Whether I can return home,

165
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,600
I will not love you.

166
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,700
I never planned to be with you, either.

167
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,080
Henceforth,

168
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,340
take good care of your grandpa.

169
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,740
Do you need some help?

170
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,040
No.

171
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,040
I can get it myself.

172
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,040
Don't you sleep yet?

173
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:45,820
I'm sleepless.

174
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:46,870
I need some food.

175
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,720
What are you looking for?

176
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:48,640
Let me help you.

177
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:49,600
No, thanks.

178
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,300
I know where my things are.

179
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,140
I don't need your help.

180
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:52,980
I insist.

181
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,470
Go away! I don't need help.

182
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,580
I really know that.
