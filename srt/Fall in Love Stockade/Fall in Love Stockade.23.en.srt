Which one do you like, Miss?

21
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,740
Pick one.

22
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,700
When did I say I liked any of them?

23
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,700
Yeah. You don't like them.

24
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,860
But you stared at the balloons

25
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:17,020
instead of me.

26
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,400
I want this, then.

27
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:23,760
Here.

28
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:27,700
Why did you give it to me?

29
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,200
It's something I like

30
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:31,220
and I want the man I like to hold it.

31
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,400
I have something for you, too.

32
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,480
Stop!

33
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,640
You thief!

34
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,840
What did you steal?

35
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,200
Confess.

36
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:52,420
Stop.

37
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:55,340
What's going on?

38
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,360
Captain, isn't it an exercise?

39
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:58,940
Seriously?

40
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,660
Sorry, sorry.

41
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,140
Just some misunderstanding.

42
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,410
Misunderstanding. I got it wrong.

43
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,560
Sorry.

44
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,970
- We got it wrong.
- My apologies.

45
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:07,820
Go.

46
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:28,860
Haw-haw.

47
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,420
What's so funny?

48
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,360
I'm gonna conquer you.

49
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Let's do it together.

50
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,320
We got it.

51
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,860
(It's perfect timing.)

52
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:08,520
Miss, don't believe him.

53
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,600
It's just a trick to attract pretty girls.

54
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:13,900
Kid,

55
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,700
it's rude to disturb a date.

56
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:16,540
Where are your parents?

57
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,700
Miss, don't listen to him.

58
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,840
My mother said all men were...

59
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:22,760
Hey, kid.

60
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,530
- Stop. I'll beat you.
- Help! Help!

61
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,800
- Be ready for it.
- Someone's gonna hit a kid!

62
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,960
It's a beautiful place.

63
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,060
(No one can disturb us here, I guess.)

64
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,560
I wonder

65
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,960
- if you like this.
- I don't like this.

66
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,200
Why not?

67
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,360
No reason, exactly.

68
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:53,660
I could do it before, but why can't I now?

69
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:56,090
- You just can't. No reason.
- Ignore them. Let's eat.

70
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,600
Give me a reason, OK?

71
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:00,120
I really want to know why.

72
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,300
- No reason. We just don't match.
- Here.

73
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,600
Why do we not match?

74
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,620
- So sweet.
- Look, I have type-b blood.

75
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,820
So do you.

76
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:12,360
When you need blood,
I won't be stingy about it.

77
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,360
What are you talking about?

78
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,360
I mean, we match perfectly.

79
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,700
How's that related to blood type?

80
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:17,820
- So unromantic.
- Ignore them.

81
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:18,960
Are you cursing me?

82
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:19,800
I'm not.

83
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:20,660
Don't try to deny it.

84
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:26,760
Sorry, sorry.

85
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,120
- I didn't mean it.
- I'll wipe it for you.

86
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,200
My apologies.

87
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,300
Don't be scared. Come.

88
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:36,020
Gentleman, my girlfriend didn't mean that.

89
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:37,220
How much is your shirt?

90
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:38,100
I'll pay for it.

91
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,120
It's OK. Never mind.

92
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,960
Feelings for love can't be disguised.

93
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,760
Now that you love each other,

94
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,120
you should cherish it and stay together.

95
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:53,500
Unlike us...

96
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:55,820
We have very little time left.

97
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,060
I don't know how much longer we can stay.

98
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,620
Oh, I see.

99
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:03,120
I'm sorry.

100
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,500
So sorry.

101
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,600
Xiaozi, look.

102
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,240
They two

103
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:08,640
are quite positive

104
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,560
and energetic.

105
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,220
Even at the end of life,

106
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,200
they still love each other.

107
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,120
We should cherish the time
we spend together.

108
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,220
I don't mean that.

109
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,560
Wanwan,

110
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,800
we love each other.

111
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,700
Even when we're in different worlds,

112
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:30,860
as long as we have expectations,

113
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,520
we will meet again someday.

114
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,520
I'm looking forward to that day.

115
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,760
I'll always be waiting.

116
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,520
(I have to propose to her soon.)

117
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,680
(It's getting dark.)

118
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,860
Excuse me. Make way, please.

119
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,100
Watch your steps.

120
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:52,940
Don't step on it.

121
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,140
Watch the stairs.

122
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
What are they doing?

123
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,020
Don't forget the balloons.

124
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,660
Preparing for a wedding, I think.

125
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,880
A wedding on the lawn?

126
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,280
It's gorgeous.

127
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:13,960
What's this?

128
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,320
A wedding dress.

129
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,160
For a bride at her wedding.

130
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,900
It looks so pretty.

131
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,760
Sadly,

132
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,720
I can't wear it in my life.

133
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,720
I'm leaving soon.

134
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,480
Hello.

135
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,440
Tang Zheyuan.

136
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,360
Pretty, isn't it?

137
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,720
I love it.

138
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,860
You look gorgeous.

139
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,100
Zheyuan,

140
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,360
are you feeling unwell?

141
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,600
Miss Lin Wanwan,

142
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:33,860
will you marry me?

143
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,420
This is the way

144
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,460
we propose to a lady.

145
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,220
I will.

146
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,400
Even if it can last for only one day,

147
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,260
I will still marry you.

148
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,600
Who are you guys?

149
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,560
- Run.
- It's Mr. Xu's wedding scene!

150
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,100
Who are you? Hey, you!

151
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:25,960
