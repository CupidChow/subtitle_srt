=Episode 14=

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,400
That person is

21
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:02,960
right here.

22
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,480
You?

23
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:11,460
Out of my way.

24
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:12,660
Chief Lin,

25
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,620
you're always the one I love.

26
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,320
Sadly, we've been opponents.

27
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:18,540
My mother said,

28
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,060
unless I conquered Yunlu Abode,

29
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:21,360
I wouldn't be allowed to marry you.

30
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,380
So, I had to pretend

31
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,040
to collude with Huang Ergou.

32
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,620
After we got married,

33
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,360
I would make you lead Yunlu Abode again.

34
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,300
But you were gone.

35
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,700
Then, I also ended up here.

36
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,400
Song Jingyu,

37
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,360
based on your testimony,

38
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:37,960
you admitted three crimes.

39
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:39,540
First,

40
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,560
you threatened Wanwan

41
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,700
to marry you

42
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,260
with Yunlu Abode.

43
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,240
Second,

44
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,860
you invaded her abode

45
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,520
and seized her properties.

46
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,360
Third,

47
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:51,900
you had illegal weapons

48
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,060
and caused an affray.

49
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:57,410
You may spend your life in prison.

50
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,100
Wanwan,

51
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:01,760
men can't be trusted.

52
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,520
What about you?

53
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:06,260
Aren't you a man, too?

54
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,200
I'm not like you.

55
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,260
I'm her man.

56
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,520
Look at you,

57
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,720
how shameless!

58
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,620
Three years ago,

59
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,900
Wanwan and I had
some misunderstanding in Yunlu Abode.

60
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,660
Otherwise, I would be her husband.

61
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,600
You're so shameless.

62
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,560
Husband?

63
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,460
Believe it or not,
I'll have you imprisoned!

64
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,520
You just said

65
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,460
you came here three years ago?

66
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:32,960
Yes.

67
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,400
Three years and six months.

68
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:35,380
I looked hard for you.

69
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,660
For her? Such nonsense.

70
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,380
- Don't flatter yourself!
- Wanwan!

71
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,400
Three years and six months?

72
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,300
- Get off.
- Go.

73
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,680
- Wanwan!
- Shut up. Get out.

74
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,260
- I'll look for Old Chief with you.
- Three years.

75
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,100
Wanwan!

76
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,400
Wanwan.

77
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,000
Wanwan, trust me.

78
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,560
- Wanwan!
- Get out of my house!

79
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,760
Wanwan.

80
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,620
Wanwan, open the door.

81
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,200
I live in Bafang Hotel in the town.

82
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,660
Room 1314.

83
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:00,500
My phone number is

84
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,280
18108019918.

85
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,500
Call me.

86
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:04,700
Wanwan, open the door.

87
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:05,760
Did you hear?

88
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,600
Wanwan!

89
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,760
Such a noise. Stop yelling.

90
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,700
It stinks.

91
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,080
Seriously?

92
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,400
Just stinky tofu.

93
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,700
You've been gargling since this morning.

94
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:31,500
Quite a strong box.

95
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,120
Why do I still feel stinky?

96
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,360
What are these?

97
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,320
Grandpa's photos.

98
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,000
When Old Chief was young?

99
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,120
When I was seven.

100
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,720
Zheyuan is seven.

101
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:02,460
He's in primary school

102
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,560
with exam success.

103
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,960
I can't let him repeat that error.

104
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,220
Your grandpa seems

105
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:12,120
to care about you more than you think.

106
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,660
(Photo of Zheyuan when he's eight.)

107
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,900
(Photo of Zheyuan when he's nine.)

108
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,560
(He doesn't smile too much these years.)

109
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,100
(Am I doing the wrong thing?)

110
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,760
(Photo of Zheyuan when he's 19.)

111
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,620
(Zhuang Mengyao took it for me.)

112
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,220
Looks like you didn't know about them.

113
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,660
(He hasn't contacted me for one year.)

114
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,320
(I don't blame him.)

115
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,020
Stop playing.

116
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,380
What future can you have?

117
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,020
Will you sink just like your father?

118
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,320
No one could restrain him!

119
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,660
He didn't listen to anyone!

120
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,620
In the end, his family was ruined!

121
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,780
At the labor course,

122
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,120
I made it by myself!

123
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,580
But you ruined it!

124
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:05,140
I hate you!

125
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:06,620
(When I was little,)

126
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,000
(he was rather strict with me)

127
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,640
(and never praised me.)

128
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,120
(I thought he hated me)

129
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,600
(because of my father.)

130
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,060
After I went to college,

131
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,820
I never came back.

132
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:25,780
I worked so hard

133
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,480
to distinguish myself.

134
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,780
I wanted success all the time.

135
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,660
But actually...

136
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,640
Actually, I just wanted him to praise me.

137
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,200
He will wake up.

138
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,540
He will.

139
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:58,900
You know what?

140
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,280
No one has hugged me like this before.

141
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,860
You never enjoyed warmth in childhood.

142
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,060
Poor man.

143
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,300
But...

144
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:16,740
I'll go get some tissue for you.

145
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:18,800
How about

146
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:19,960
we hug later?

147
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,640
I can't get you tissue like this.

148
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,580
Go like this, then.

149
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,400
Put me down.

150
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,400
Well,

151
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:03,520
shall we keep checking

152
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:04,480
what else we can find?

153
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:06,660
Mm.

154
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,820
Some books he no longer needed.

155
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,520
What's this?

156
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,840
Something my grandpa carried

157
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,940
the day he had a car crash.

158
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:31,780
Newspaper briefing, I guess.

159
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:34,320
Sometimes, he collects something
he's interested in.

160
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,760
This thing...

161
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:42,020
It looks familiar.

162
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,840
Give me a pen and paper.

163
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,060
He Village?

164
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,940
I heard about this place.

165
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,080
In Huangping Town, I think.

166
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,720
(On the day of the car crash,)

167
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,360
(why was Grandpa carrying this map?)

168
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,350
(Is it because...)

169
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,420
How did your grandpa store

170
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:39,820
his books, materials, and files?

171
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,220
In his laptop.

172
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:47,640
Why can't I turn it on?

173
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,820
This laptop is too old

174
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,180
to be turned on.

175
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,080
I have to take back the hard drive.

176
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:10,920
And all these...

177
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,760
I should take them back, too.

178
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,740
Old Chief raised me for 12 years.

179
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:23,820
He only told me

180
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,680
how he established Yunlu Abode.

181
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,400
He never talked about you.

182
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,880
He never mentioned you, either.

183
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:36,940
If...

184
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,880
If Old Chief was traveling

185
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,480
between two worlds,

186
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,720
can we be siblings?

187
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,440
What are you talking about?

188
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:47,780
I don't need a sister.

189
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:48,620
I need...

190
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,240
