Coming.

Zheyuan?

What are you doing here?

25
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,400
Where's she?

26
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:25,840
Who?

27
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,200
Oh, Wanwan.

28
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,420
I don't know what was wrong with her.

29
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:33,800
In the pub, I tried to take her home.

30
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,160
But she refused.

31
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,700
You left her there alone?

32
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,700
I didn't.

33
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:39,460
She refused to go

34
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:40,400
and asked me to leave.

35
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,720
Tell me, Zheyuan.

36
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:44,160
Is Wanwan still mad at me?

37
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,100
Zhuang Mengyao, you're going too far.

38
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:49,300
Zheyuan.

39
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,340
Wait.

40
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,960
You're not Xiaoliu.

41
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,160
And you're not Shuan.

42
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,600
I'm going home.

43
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:10,600
Don't go home.

44
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,200
You're gonna have a great night.

45
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,740
Great?

46
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,700
Watch this!

47
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,160
I can't breathe.

48
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:21,000
Boss, help us!

49
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Help, Boss!

50
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,840
Boss!

51
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,000
What's going on here?

52
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,100
- Too heavy.
- She has too much strength.

53
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,360
You guys, remember.

54
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,220
If anyone grabs you like this,

55
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:39,490
- do this trick.
- Try harder, losers.

56
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,100
Shake-off.

57
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,400
Ouch!

58
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,960
You losers.

59
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:55,720
How dare you ruin my dress!

60
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,100
I order you!

61
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,020
Fix it and give it back to me tomorrow.

62
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,960
Or you'll have to suffer.

63
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,080
Boss, what do we do?

64
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,120
Get on her.

65
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,380
It's Miss Zhuang's order.

66
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,660
We have to do this. Go.

67
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,120
The first drunk girl we had

68
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,300
and she's such trouble.

69
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:15,540
Lin Wanwan!

70
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:19,780
Who are you?

71
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,480
Oh, my God.

72
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,040
Didn't you promise

73
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,060
to take me to the Book Repository
after drinking?

74
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,500
Liar!

75
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,700
What would you do there?

76
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,540
I'm going there

77
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,860
to find books

78
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:59,460
on the vegetative state.

79
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,700
You can't help him.

80
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,360
I can't?

81
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,300
I can't help him.

82
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,540
Nonsense!

83
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,000
I can help him.

84
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,880
You... You let me try.

85
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,300
She's quite stubborn.

86
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,240
I investigated her.

87
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,720
Mr. Chen of our lawsuit

88
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,960
didn't contact her.

89
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,840
I checked her fingerprints and DNA.

90
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,480
I also consulted nearby costume TV crews

91
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,020
and performance agencies.

92
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,200
No one knew her.

93
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:31,960
She was like...

94
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:33,560
Puff.

95
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,760
Appeared out of nowhere.

96
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,800
Mm.

97
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:39,800
I get it.

98
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,240
Here. Have some water.

99
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,140
Careful.

100
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,760
He, thank you for finding her.

101
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:18,980
My pleasure.

102
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,140
We'll wait until the bullies confess.

103
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:21,980
Yeah.

104
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,140
By the way,

105
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,540
since when were you not a neat freak?

106
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:27,860
It has nothing to do with the case

107
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,460
and I'm not gonna reply.

108
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,900
What was that for?

109
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,340
Sanctimonious.

110
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,620
So hot.

111
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,700
It's cool.

112
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,740
Feels great.

113
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:52,880
Stop it.

114
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,660
I won't let you go.

115
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,840
I just won't.

116
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,440
Feels cool.

117
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,200
Let me go.

118
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,700
So cool.

119
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,360
Don't stroke me.

120
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:26,700
Shh.

121
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,540
I'm exhausted.

122
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,560
Second Uncle betrayed me

123
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,700
and wanted to kill me.

124
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,600
I had trouble finding Old Chief.

125
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,640
But he's in a coma.

126
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:44,340
I don't know how to save my men.

127
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:48,260
No one can help me.

128
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:51,360
And I met a lawyer.

129
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:55,540
He bullied me.

130
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:58,780
He didn't bully you.

131
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,400
He did.

132
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:04,100
They said I was a mad woman.

133
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,740
Don't think I would not know that.

134
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,500
We didn't mean that.

135
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,160
I'm exhausted.

136
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:28,940
(Tang Zheyuan,)

137
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,560
(don't be silly.)

138
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,760
(All you want is the password.)

139
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,200
I...

140
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,800
How did I come back?

141
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:57,200
I won't let you go.

142
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,160
Don't think I would not know that.

143
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,100
Oh, no.

144
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,460
Oh, I'm so dead.

145
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,760
The wine!

146
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,240
I even...

147
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:07,780
Oh, no.

148
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:13,300
I'm done. I really am.

149
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,080
Umm...

150
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,340
What happened last night

151
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,000
was an accident.

152
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,400
I didn't mean to...

153
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:36,920
- (That sounds so irresponsible.)
- It's OK.

154
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:38,600
Have breakfast.

155
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,700
OK.

156
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,440
You made all this?

157
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,200
Smells great.

158
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,440
I ordered some food delivery.

159
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,040
Here.

160
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:07,580
In case of trouble,

161
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,540
long press this button and call me.

162
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,040
What happened last night

163
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,640
wouldn't happen again.

164
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,260
Thank you for last night.

165
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:16,840
If you hadn't arrived in time,

166
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,840
I would have...

167
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,200
Anyway, you're my friend now.

168
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,740
I owe you this.

169
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,340
Maybe those men are paid.

170
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,000
They'll insist that they just wanted you.

171
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:31,820
Come on.

172
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,860
Let's put this aside.

173
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,360

174
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,380
