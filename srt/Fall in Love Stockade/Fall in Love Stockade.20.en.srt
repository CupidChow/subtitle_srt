Song Jingyu

00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,860
does great in martial arts.

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,500
But you do great in reciting.

00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,120
Think?

You,

Mm.

57
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,320
Get to work, then!

58
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,360

About your father's scandal
with Chen Chunmei,

67
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,680

OK.

69
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,020

OK.

77

(Inpatient Building)
His awakening means a lot to us.

78
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,520
But it takes time for him to recover.

79
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,560
In later months,

80
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,080
he needs to be under observation.

81
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,280
You must take good care of him.

89
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,460

With your own eyes.

94
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:17,380

96
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,580

(He's sentenced to death)

101
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,400
(and deprived of political rights for life.)

102
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,920
It's finally over.

103
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:33,860
Yeah.

Open your mouth.

106

Why do you have the candy?

107
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,600

every time you feel bad,

109
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,920
you eat some candy.

110
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,660
I'll always take some for you.

111
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,820
Such a big candy.

112
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,220
I feel

113
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,420
really happy.

114
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,000

Lin Wanwan,

116
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,460

00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:28,500
what do you want?

119
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,640
Calm down. Let go of my grandpa.

120
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,240
Grandpa Tang,

121
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,960
you cared a lot about me, didn't you?

122
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,820
What level of martial arts
have you reached?

123
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,620
Still the first level.

124
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,420
I'm too busy for that lately.

125
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,160
The less you practice,

126
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,620
the more you regret when you need it.

127
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,440
Lin Wanwan, don't move.

128
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,820
Otherwise,

129
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,520
I'll push him into the water!

130
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,860
Come over

131
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,060
and kneel.

132
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:56,600
- Maybe I'll let him go.
- You!

133
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,020
She has Grandpa.

134
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,420
Don't move rashly.

135
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:02,520
Wanwan.

136
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,400
Wanwan.

137
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,360
Lin Wanwan,

138
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,960
what's so great about you?

139
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,920
You thought you always won, huh?

140
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,660
Now, you still lose!

141
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,320
Because of you, I lost everything.

142
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,820
And I'm gonna make you disappear.

143
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,820
Did you hear?

144
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:30,620
Yes, yes.

145
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,560
You still have that indifferent look.

146
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,560
What do you want?

147
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:38,500
I'll make a video

148
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,500
and even a live broadcast.

149
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,420
I'll make everyone in this world know

150
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,560
what kind of woman Lin Wanwan is!

151
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,400
Zhuang Mengyao,

152
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,000
let them go!

153
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,200
I'll give you anything you want.

154
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,020
Let them go?

155
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,420
Tang Zheyuan,

156
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,300
do you think I'll obey you

157
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,500
as I did before?

158
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,140
It's never gonna happen.

159
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,860
You ruined my family.

160
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,800
How could you want me to let them go?

161
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,200
Let's play a fun game.

162
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,480
Either Grandpa Tang or Lin Wanwan

163
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,260
can live.

164
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,500
Mr. Tang, the just attorney,

165
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,900
what's your choice?

166
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:21,860
I did everything!

167
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,120
I sued your father, too!

168
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,700
They're not involved!

169
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:26,740
If you don't choose, fine.

170
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,960
They're dying, anyway.

171
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,220
Grandpa Tang,

172
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,660
why didn't you help my father?

173
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,500
Everything happened

174
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,160
because of you!

175
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:43,320

176
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:45,540
