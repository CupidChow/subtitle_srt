I know life is hard.

70
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,060

Lin Wanwan, why do you insult me?

73
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,920
In every industry,

74
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,120
people work to make a living.

75
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,660
You work in a brothel.

76
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:40,720
But, you make a living with your hands.

77
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,060
Compared to those useless

78
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,360
young men and ladies,

79
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,060
you're much better.

80
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,640
Lin Wanwan,

81
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,820
say one word, and you're a dead woman!

82
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:53,900
Don't be angry, pretty.

83
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,460
I just wonder

84
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,300
if I should give you some advice.

85
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,900
Though you work in a brothel,

86
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:07,300
you better conduct yourself out here.

87
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,920
I once saw some girls

88
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,100
whose legs were exposed on the street.

89
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,600
That's a stain to their chastity.

90
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:16,100
And look how you're dressed up.

91
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,700
If people see you,

92
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,500
they'll blame you

93
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,060
as a promiscuous girl.

94
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:23,900
You!

95
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:31,300
Lin Wanwan,

96
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,460
stop playing innocent

97
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:34,820
or talking nonsense.

98
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,600
I'm Tang Zheyuan's girlfriend.

99
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,880
Girlfriend?

100
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:45,200
(So, Tang Zheyuan likes this kind of girl.)

101
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,500
I guess they're right.

102
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,900
You just use Grandpa Tang as an excuse

103
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,160
to stay in Zheyuan's house.

104
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,220
That's not an excuse.

105
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,000
I'm indeed here for Old Chief.

106
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,600
Are young girls

107
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,800
so cheap now?

108
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,760
You look innocent but do the dirty.

109
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:05,660
You know you aren't
pretty enough for Zheyuan.

110
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,940
So, you want to seduce his grandpa.

111
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:10,940
What was Grandpa Tang thinking?

112
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,740
How could he fancy someone like you?

113
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:13,580
Ah.

114
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,940
I won't let you humiliate Old Chief!

115
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,000
Lin Wanwan,

116
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,640
how dare you be this smug!

117
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:20,940
I'll fight you!

118
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,340
I slapped you, to teach you a lesson.

119
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,460
This one, for Old Chief.

120
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,500
And this one, for girls in the world.

121
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,660
You're a girl but disrespect other girls.

122
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,040
Had enough?

123
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,240
Do you want more?

124
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,840
No, no.

125
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,200
Don't slap me anymore.

126
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,800
I heard the quarrel from far away.

127
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,900
What happened here?

128
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:47,300
Miss Lin,

129
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,200
I don't know how I annoyed you

130
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:52,100
and made you slap me that hard.

131
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:54,180
Zheyuan.

132
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,830
- Zheyuan.
- Get up first.

133
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,700
I just asked about her relationship
with Grandpa Tang

134
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,400
and she slapped me.

135
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,000
I did, so what?

136
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:05,600
If he helps you,

137
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,600
I'll slap him, too.

138
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,090
Mengyao, you may leave.

139
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:13,780
Zheyuan,

140
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,140
won't you defend me?

141
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,240
Unless you have something urgent,

142
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,160
do not come lately.

143
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,000
You!

144
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,440
Go.

145
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,700
(No one dared to be so rude to me.)

146
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,940
(It's all because of you, Lin Wanwan.)

147
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,340
(It's all your fault!)

148
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,900
(Just you wait!)

149
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,300
(If she really wanted to hurt you,)

150
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:47,340
(your face would be disfigured.)

151
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,440
Hey.

152
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:53,880
Tang Zheyuan.

153
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,340
Tang Zheyuan.

154
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:01,780
Hey.

155
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,600
I have an idea

156
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,540
to make me recall the password.

157
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,300
Mm?

158
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,820
Do you have some wine?

159
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,100
Can it really work?

160
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:23,940
Of course.

161
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:25,700
Drinking always gives me a better memory.

162
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,300
But this...

163
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,560
Is this really wine?

164
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,600
I want a bigger bottle.

165
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,080
Here.

166
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,260
Bigger ones.

167
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:38,100
Drink.

168
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,640
It's...

169
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,400
It's too small.

170
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,860
I need a bowl to drink.

171
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:43,780
Bowl.

172
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:44,860
To swig it.

173
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,880
Like this.

174
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:51,780
Here.

175
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,060
OK.

176
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,200
(My table.)

177
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:58,800
(Just a little splash, fine.)

178
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,400
(I won't be angry.)

179
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,940
(Wine can't make me drunk, but I can.)

180
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,040
(Oh, my carpet.)

181
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:06,700
(Calm down, man.)

182
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:09,540
(Take the bowl and drink it up.)

183
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,400
(Calm.)

184
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,800
(It's not the worst case yet.)

185
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:15,940
Tastes great.

186
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,140
(Filthy and stinky.)

187
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,500
(This is too much!)

188
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,620
Have you recalled the password?

189
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,180
Get up!

190
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:29,700
Are you fooling me?

191
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,300
(You...)

192
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:38,360
I really don't understand you.

193
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:41,600
Why do you force me

194
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:45,240
to tell you the password

195
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:48,440
before you tell me where Old Chief is?

196
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:51,260
If you told me where he was,

197
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,660
I might have recalled the password.

198
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,840
I won't believe you!

199
00:08:59,100 --> 00:08:59,940
Where's he?

200
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,200
Tang Zheyuan.

201
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,240
Tang Zheyuan!
