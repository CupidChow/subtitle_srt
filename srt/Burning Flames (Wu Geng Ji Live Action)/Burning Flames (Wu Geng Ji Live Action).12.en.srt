[Episode 12]

4
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:48,509
Brat,

5
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:50,930
you're going to die today!

6
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,230
Lan, it's too late.

7
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:11,620
Go to hell.

8
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:45,710
Since you saved

9
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:47,210
my master's life,

10
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:48,980
I'm going to let you go today.

11
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,520
From now on,

12
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:53,010
my master doesn't owe you anything anymore.

13
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:53,950
Leave.

14
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,110
I just wanted a section of your horn

15
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:25,550
to save Bai Cai.

16
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:27,950
I didn't expect it

17
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:29,690
to end up like this.

18
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,640
Qiongqi,

19
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:36,890
hang in there.

20
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,770
Every time I get hurt,

21
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:49,270
Bai Cai would give me this medicine.

22
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:51,970
This medicine is very effective

23
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:54,440
for both internal and external injuries.

24
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,230
Bai Cai loves to smile.

25
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,790
She's a very good girl.

26
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:11,640
She knows pharmacology

27
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:13,600
and is good at cooking.

28
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:16,550
But I didn't like her

29
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:18,940
when I first met her.

30
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:22,450
As Gou,

31
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,510
Bai Cai and I have been friends

32
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:27,200
who have kept each other company since childhood.

33
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,370
As Wu Geng,

34
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:31,360
she has suffered so much for me.

35
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:34,550
I have the obligation and responsibility

36
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:35,810
to protect her.

37
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,080
So Bai Cai and he

38
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:40,970
have been through a lot together.

39
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:42,159
No wonder

40
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,180
they can't live without each other.

41
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:57,830
Qiongqi,

42
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:01,150
I didn't mean to hurt you.

43
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,750
But I must save Bai Cai.

44
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:05,630
I'm sorry.

45
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:07,350
Today,

46
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:09,630
I have to take your horn.

47
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,130
Qiongqi, thank you.

48
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,870
Qiongqi is a spiritual beast.

49
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:45,130
It doesn't like to get along with humans.

50
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,560
Wu Geng actually made Qiongqi touched.

51
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:50,800
Maybe High Priest was right.

52
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:55,270
Gou.

53
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:56,440
-Gou.
-Gou.

54
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:57,830
Gou.

55
00:05:59,909 --> 00:06:00,710
Clan Leader,

56
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:04,580
save Bai Cai.

57
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:15,590
-Gou.
-Gou.

58
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:16,720
-Gou.
-Gou.

59
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,270
-Gou.
-Gou.

60
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:22,880
Gou.

61
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:24,470
Gou.

62
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:25,560
Gou.

63
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:33,670
What exactly is the secret

64
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:35,420
of that girl's divine spirit?

65
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:37,670
Why has it been sealed?

66
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:41,120
If it's really some kind of ancient power,

67
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,320
it's extremely cold.

68
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:50,070
She once asked me

69
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,390
about the oracle bone.

70
00:06:51,909 --> 00:06:52,950
Could it be...

71
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:57,570
she saw it before?

72
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,070
High Priest.

73
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:15,920
Lan,

74
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:18,750
you've always been calm.

75
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:19,950
Why did you...

76
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:28,990
You know

77
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,450
how dangerous Qiongqi is.

78
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:31,630
If anything happens

79
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:32,990
to Wu Geng,

80
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:34,510
what we've planned for years

81
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,870
will be in vain.

82
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:39,350
I think highly of you

83
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:41,000
because you've never

84
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,830
been emotional.

85
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:42,990
But this time,

86
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:46,030
you really have let me down.

87
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:47,990
I know I was wrong.

88
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:50,310
Please punish me.

89
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:53,230
Forget it.

90
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:56,970
After all, nothing serious happened this time.

91
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:59,090
Wu Geng also came back safely.

92
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:00,730
Get up.

93
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,010
Thank you, High Priest.

94
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:05,990
In the prophecy,

95
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:09,410
Wu Geng is the God of War of the human race.

96
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:10,790
He's the only one

97
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,120
who can defeat Hei Long.

98
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:14,070
I entrusted him to you

99
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:16,910
because I hope you can protect him.

100
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:19,030
We can't afford to make any mistake.

101
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,660
If I'm gone one day,

102
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25,410
I also hope you can help him

103
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:27,630
accomplish the great cause.

104
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,260
High Priest, what do you mean?

105
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:33,299
Do you remember

106
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:35,600
the prophecy I told you?

107
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,610
Maybe soon,

108
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,419
the three realms

109
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:43,220
will be in chaos again.

110
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:45,990
You mean...

111
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:47,230
the person

112
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:48,910
who killed Wu Geng in the prophecy

113
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:49,790
has appeared.

114
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:51,710
There are many things

115
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:54,600
that can't be predicted

116
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:57,230
even with my divine power of the Kongshi Realm.

117
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:02,120
Maybe when Bai Cai wakes up,

118
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:04,750
we'll have an answer.

119
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:24,870
Gou.

120
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:35,030
Bai Cai,

121
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:36,880
you are fine now?

122
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:39,900
Of course.

123
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,300
Silly Gou, what are you thinking?

124
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:48,030
You...

125

♫It's someone else in front of me♫

132

Let's go pick wild vegetables

134
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:07,060

I'm not going to wait for you.

Gou.

146

Here, Bai Cai.

147
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:38,250
The medicine made with Qiongqi's horn is ready.

148
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:41,310
Bai Cai, drink the medicine.

149
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:22,310
Bai Cai.

150
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:24,630
Don't go, Bai Cai.

151
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:40,310
Silly Gou.

152
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:49,350
Bai Cai, you're finally awake.

153
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,630
Bai Cai, you're awake.

154
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:57,910
Looks like Qiongqi's horn

155
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:59,110
really is very effective.

156
00:11:59,110 --> 00:11:59,830
Wu Xia.

157
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:02,710
Right.

158
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:04,750
This is the medicine the clan leader gave you.

159
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,070
In order to get Qiongqi's horn,

160
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:07,430
you are injured all over your body.

161
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:08,950
Who is injured? You must be mistaken.

162
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:09,950
-Gou.
-Not me.

163
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:12,430
Did you get hurt again to save me?

164
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:15,480
But your previous wounds haven't healed yet.

165
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:16,550
It's all my fault.

166
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:20,400
What are you talking about?

167
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,250
It should be my fault.

168
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:24,310
I was busy with training every day.

169
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,280
I didn't know

170
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:26,960
you were poisoned long ago.

171
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:29,990
I was poisoned?

172
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:31,710
It was very serious.

173
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:32,890
If it weren't for Qiongqi's horn

174
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:34,250
brought back by Gou,

175
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,110
you would have been dead by now.

176
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,700
That's right, Bai Cai.

177
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:38,720
You have no idea.

178
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:39,950
Qiongqi is so fierce.

179
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:41,390
If he hadn't risked his life...

180
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:42,110
Enough.

181
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:43,090
You two go back first.

182
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:44,000
You are not needed here.

183
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,030
Bai Cai, let me tell you.

184
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:45,910
I'm going to put the medicine here.

185
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:46,550
Just put it here.

186
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:47,670
Remember to take the medicine.

187
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:48,670
You are not needed here today.

188
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:49,270
Bai Cai, remember to take the medicine.

189
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,150
Rest early.

190
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:05,110
Why are you crying again?

191
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:06,750
Gou,

192
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:07,990
do you know

193
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:09,590
I'm so afraid of losing you

194
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:11,380
and being alone?

195
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:13,750
Didn't I tell you?

196
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:14,970
I'll be fine.

197
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:16,630
Don't worry.

198
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:22,380
I said I'll be fine.

199
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:32,610
Don't worry.

200
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:35,330
Look at me. I'm fine now, right?

201
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:18,870
Zi Dian,

202
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:23,430
when Gou was trying to take Qiongqi's horn yesterday,

203
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:24,550
you wanted to kill him.

204
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:25,760
Am I right?

205
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:28,990
Yes, I have the courage to take responsibility for what I did.

206
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:30,010
You've been protecting him in secret.

207
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:31,540
You think I don't know that?

208
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:33,870
Don't you think you care too much about him?

209
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:35,470
There is no grudge between you and Gou.

210
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:37,470
But you tried to kill him many times.

211
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:38,710
It's a shame

212
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:39,950
to have you in Shenyin Village.

213
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:40,810
What about you?

214
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:42,990
High Priest asked you to teach him skills.

215
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:43,950
He didn't ask you to give the Dragon Whale Incense

216
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:44,710
to him.

217
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:47,790
People in Shenyin Village are not allowed to bully the weak.

218
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:49,040
You broke the rule.

219
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:52,290
I'm going to teach you a lesson on behalf of High Priest.

220
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:28,870
This time, the punishment is a warning.

221
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:30,450
If you dare to touch Gou again,

222
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:31,700
you might lose your life.

223
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:32,670
You care so much about him.

224
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:34,470
Have you fallen in love with him?

225
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36,830
I like you so much.

226
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:39,030
I betrayed the Immortal Clan for you.

227
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,630
But in the end, I'm not even as important as a human.

228
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:41,340
Enough.

229
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:43,310
Zi Dian,

230
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:44,630
you have no idea

231
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:46,090
how important Gou is to us.

232
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:49,060
Is he important to us

233
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:52,990
or you?

234
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:55,810
Stop being unreasonable.

235
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:57,400
You just need to know

236
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:59,900
you should stay away from Gou from now on.

237
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:01,680
If anything happens to him,

238
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:02,790
not just me,

239
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:05,430
High Priest won't easily forgive you either.

240
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:07,490
You'd better conduct yourself well.

241
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:23,870
Who's there?

242
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,120
Master.

243
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:26,190
It's me.

244
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:27,630
Gou.

245
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,350
Why are you following me

246
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:30,260
secretly?

247
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:32,230
Master,

248
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:35,910
thank you for giving me the Dragon Whale Incense.

249
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:38,550
Who... Who said the Dragon Whale Incense

250
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:39,520
was given to you?

251
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:41,100
When you

252
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:42,710
have your own Dragon Whale Incense in the future,

253
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,310
you should give it back to me.

254
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:45,840
Moreover,

255
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:47,710
if you can't finish today's tasks,

256
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:49,870
you won't be allowed to eat, rest,

257
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:51,710
or go back.

258
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:05,369
Sister. Sister.

259
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,150
Gou, you're back.

260
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:08,300
These fruits are for you.

261
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,550
They are the most effective for healing your wounds.

262
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:12,060
Here, eat more.

263
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:24,710
You've improved a lot.

264
00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:25,829
The medicinal wine I've saved for years

265
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:28,270
was not in vain.

266
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:29,790
You are lucky.

267
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:31,540
Save it.

268
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:33,790
Save some for that girl.

269
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:37,730
Thank you, Yun Zhongzi.

270
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:43,350
Gou, you're back.

271
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:44,720
Gou is back.

272
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:46,630
-Gou.
-Gou.

273
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:47,230
This set of clothes is for you.

274
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:49,760
This is good for healing your wounds. Take it.

275
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,020
Hurry.

276
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:56,000
Try it on.

277
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:13,830
You've improved a lot

278
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:15,470
and you've been recovering very quickly.

279
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:16,790
I believe soon,

280
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:17,550
we can

281
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:18,920
move to the next stage.

282
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,200
What's the next stage?

283
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:22,280
The Divine Activation.

284
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:24,260
What is the Divine Activation?

285
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:25,750
The Divine Activation

286
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:28,400
is the divine power that only the Immortal Clan has.

287
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,640
After the Divine Activation,

288
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,630
your cultivation

289
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:32,310
will reach a new level.

290
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:36,150
What kind of divine power

291
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:38,570
will I have after the Divine Activation?

292
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:40,390
Before the Divine Activation,

293
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:41,590
no one can be certain.

294
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:46,800
Then which kind of divine power is the strongest?

295
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:52,270
The divine power of the Colorless Realm

296
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:53,800
is the rarest divine power.

297
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:57,440
After you reach the highest level,

298
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,430
you can take the lives of all the living creatures

299
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:02,080
in the three realms.

300
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:03,750
The only person

301
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:04,950
who has this kind of divine power in the Immortal Clan

302
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:06,310
is Hei Long.

303
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,960
The divine power second only to the divine power of the Colorless Realm

304
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,750
is the divine power of the Primitive Realm.

305
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:13,530
It's obtained

306
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:16,110
with the help of an ancient divine beast's power.

307
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:17,270
Xin King

308
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:18,730
got the divine power of the Primitive Realm

309
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:20,290
thanks to Undying Bird

310
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:22,190
and caused severe damage to the Immortal Clan.

311
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:24,590
Next is the divine power of the Asura Realm.

312
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:26,590
It can summon living creatures.

313
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:27,870
My Assassination Butterflies

314
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:30,230
rely on the divine power of the Asura Realm.

315
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:32,830
The strongest person having this kind of power

316
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:34,320
is Shi Xing.

317
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:36,590
And there is the divine power of the Kongshi Realm.

318
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:37,940
What High Priest Fu Xi,

319
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:40,060
Xinyue Hu, Xinyue Kui,

320
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:41,280
and Bai Long have

321
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,300
is this kind of divine power.

322
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:44,790
If you master this kind of divine power,

323
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:46,420
you can understand

324
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,370
time and space

325
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:50,150
and foresee the future.

326
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:53,150
So Mom put Gou in the mortal world

327
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:55,580
because she foresaw the future.

328
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:57,720
Tian Kui's divine power of the Golden Warrior Realm

329
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,080
is mighty.

330
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:01,190
Gui Mu's divine power of the Earth Realm

331
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:02,920
can control poisonous things.

332
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:04,760
Zi Dian's divine power of the Wanxiang Realm

333
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,520
can use the power of nature.

334
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,420
And Clan Leader Kong Que's divine power

335
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:09,820
of the Immortality Realm

336
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:11,970
can heal all kinds of wounds.

337
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,190
Looks like

338
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:16,140
the divine power of the Colorless Realm is the strongest.

339
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:19,000
Then I want the divine power of the Colorless Realm.

340
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:23,550
Except Hei Long,

341
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:25,000
no one has ever activated the divine power

342
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,330
of the Colorless Realm,

343
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:27,830
let alone

344
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:28,660
a half-human, half-deity guy

345
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,180
like you.

346
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:33,350
If there's no precedent,

347
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:35,270
I'll set one.

348
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,840
Xin King is already dead.

349
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:51,710
But this lamp representing the God of War

350
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,570
is getting brighter.

351
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:56,300
Could it be...

352
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:59,150
my prediction was wrong?

353
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:02,000
Xin King is not

354
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:04,410
the chosen God of War in the prophecy.

355
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,580
If we don't get rid of this hidden trouble early,

356
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:42,540
he will become a threat

357
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:44,340
to King of Immortals someday.

358
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:52,590
It's time to go to my father.

359
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,990
Only his Eye of Prophecy

360
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:59,990
can help me find

361
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:03,150
the real chosen God of War.

362
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:09,440
Tell me.

363
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:11,870
In addition to ancient secret scriptures,

364
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:12,740
what are other ways

365
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:14,160
to make me stronger?

366
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:16,830
How would I know?

367
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:19,250
Please let me go.

368
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:20,310
You've been in charge of the Immortal Clan's scriptures

369
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:21,310
for so many years,

370
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:22,610
how could you not know?

371
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:24,630
Looks like you are not going to tell me

372
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:26,090
if I don't make you suffer.

373
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,670
This is the Demon Seed I cultivated

374
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:41,130
with the forbidden spell.

375
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,470
After you eat it,

376
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:43,650
the seed will take root and sprout

377
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:44,730
in your body.

378
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,780
Then you will become a puppet

379
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:48,020
and be at my disposal.

380
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:51,080
But... I haven't tried it

381
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:52,550
on a deity.

382
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:55,150
I'd like to know

383
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:56,650
if it still works

384
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:58,240
on you.

385
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:12,570
Are you okay?

386
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:14,680
Xinyue Hu, what are you doing?

387
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:16,350
Sister, undo the spell.

388
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:17,260
Otherwise,

389
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,260
I'll tell Father

390
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:19,100
everything you did

391
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,420
today.

392
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:21,260
You...

393
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:32,860
Thank you.

394
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,440
Xinyue Hu, what are you doing?

395
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:41,290
Sister,

396
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:42,660
have you forgotten what Father told us?

397
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:44,330
We can't practice the ancient forbidden spell.

398
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:45,750
Mind your own business.

399
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,150
What I cultivate is none of your business.

400
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:49,150
Sister,

401
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:51,410
the forbidden spell is extremely dangerous.

402
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:52,520
If anything goes wrong,

403
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,240
the cultivator will suffer a backfire.

404
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,230
Besides,

405
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,870
the cultivator has to offer the flesh and blood as a sacrifice.

406
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:58,590
It may endanger your life.

407
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:00,480
Sister,

408
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,910
go to Father with me.

409
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:02,720
I'm sure he has a way

410
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,840
to undo this spell for you.

411
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,980
Xinyue Hu,

412
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:05,990
don't think I don't know

413
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:07,250
what you're thinking.

414
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:09,270
You're worried

415
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:11,000
I'll become stronger than you.

416
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:14,650
If Father knows about this,

417
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:17,060
he will scold me again.

418
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,160
Isn't that exactly what you want?

419
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:23,370
Stop pretending.

420
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:25,660
I'm not like Father.

421
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:26,950
I'm not buying it.

422
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:28,310
Sister.

423
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:29,880
Sister!

424
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:41,890
Father.

425
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,040
You told Father.

426
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:45,220
I didn't.

427
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:52,720
What did you do, Kui?

428
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:53,390
Father.

429
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:54,350
Shut up!

430
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:00,800
How many times have I told you?

431
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,650
We can never practice the ancient forbidden spell.

432
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:04,650
But look at you.

433
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:06,900
Why are you so disobedient?

434
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:09,450
I just want to be stronger.

435
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:10,910
I can already use

436
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:13,400
the divine power of the Kongshi Realm freely.

437
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,000
It's just a forbidden spell.

438
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,100
Everything will be fine.

439
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:18,300
It'll be too late if something happens.

440
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,140
I'm going to undo the spell

441
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:28,280
for you now.

442
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:38,410
It's going to hurt.

443
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,630
You must hang in there.

444
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:42,910
Because this is the only way

445
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,220
to save you.

446
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,050
Sister.

447
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:01,400
The fire of the Fire Spell won't burn you.

448
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:05,010
It will only burn the corroded divine spirit

449
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:06,910
in your body.

450
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:18,320
Xinyue Hu is dead.

451
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,720
Now it's your turn.

452
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:31,000
Greetings, High Priest.

453
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:32,790
Gui Mu.

454
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:35,590
Have you recovered?

455
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:38,150
Thank you for caring about me.

456
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:39,860
I'm fine now.

457
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:41,360
Of course, if I have the medicine

458
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,320
given by High Priest,

459
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:45,970
I can certainly recover faster.

460
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:50,610
What can you give me in exchange for it?

461
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:53,340
Right,

462
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:55,540
last time, you said

463
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:58,740
you met Fu Xi at Northern Mountain Mine.

464
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,480
I wonder

465
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:02,410
if you have found out where he is.

466
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:06,520
High Priest, I...

467
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:08,270
Don't worry.

468
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:10,410
Fu Xi is my father,

469
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:13,320
but since he betrayed the Immortal Clan,

470
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:14,470
we have no longer been

471
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:16,550
father and daughter.

472
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:19,140
Feel free to tell me.

473
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:25,010
You haven't fully recovered.

474
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,900
I do have the medicine

475
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:29,170
that can cure you

476
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:32,880
and help you restore your divine spirit.

477
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:35,260
High Priest,

478
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:38,100
can you really restore my divine spirit?

479
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,990
As long as you can

480
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:43,460
help the Immortal Realm's six ministries capture the traitors,

481
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:45,500
I'll give you the medicine.

482
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:49,420
High Priest, I'm willing

483
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,850
to do anything for you.

484
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:54,620
But High Priest,

485
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:56,280
the Demon Clan

486
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,700
has frequently showed up in the mortal world.

487
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:00,480
The Immortal Realm's six ministries

488
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,940
have suffered certain losses.

489
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:03,470
I...

490
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:05,930
They are just on their last legs.

491
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:07,950
They can't cause any trouble.

492
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:13,160
Our top priority now

493
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,880
is to find Fu Xi.

494
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:26,840
Old Man.

495
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,460
Sit.

496
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:35,580
Bai Cai, are you feeling better?

497
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,060
I feel much better

498
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:40,420
after eating Qiongqi's horn found by Gou.

499
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:42,810
Bai Cai,

500
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:45,450
when did you

501
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:48,220
have this cold disease?

502
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:49,380
Does he

503
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:50,500
know something?

504
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,950
Maybe I was born with it.

505
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:58,100
I got sick sometimes when I was little.

506
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,140
The cold aura in your body

507
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:04,400
reminds me

508
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:06,290
of a legend

509
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:08,420
in the Immortal Realm.

510
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:12,810
The Immortal Clan also has legends?

511
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:19,260
It is said that after the ancient war in the Immortal Clan,

512
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:22,140
Hei Long, King of Immortals, ruled the three realms.

513
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:24,780
After that, Hei Long has been looking for a crystal

514
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:26,360
in the three realms.

515
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,330
It is said that this crystal

516
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:29,410
can unleash

517
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:30,940
the ancient divine power

518
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:32,770
hidden in the Crystal Mountain.

519
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:35,970
But Hei Long has never got it.

520
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,900
Until more than ten years ago,

521
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:42,540
this crystal suddenly appeared temporarily.

522
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:45,540
Hei Long sent men

523
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:47,840
to find the crystal.

524
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,210
But in the end,

525
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:53,860
all of his men died.

526
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:56,180
What killed them

527
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,860
is the ancient divine power

528
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,050
of the crystal:

529
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:02,030
the Crystal Glory.

530
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:12,710
We have to complete the seal now.

531
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:14,110
They are nearby. Search.

532
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:16,360
We don't have much time.

533
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,290
Bai Cai, be good.

534
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:17,940
No matter

535
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:19,170
what you hear or see later,

536
00:30:19,170 --> 00:30:19,920
you must hide inside.

537
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:20,700
Don't come out.

538
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:21,760
Do you understand?

539
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:23,340
Bai Cai,

540
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:25,480
if both Mother and Father are gone,

541
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,760
you must take good care of yourself.

542
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:30,380
Father, Mother,

543
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:32,950
are you abandoning me?

544
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:42,520
You are

545
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:43,870
our precious daughter.

546
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:45,100
I will never

547
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:45,920
abandon you.

548
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:46,640
Remember,

549
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:47,160
no matter

550
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,470
where we are in the future,

551
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:49,630
we love you.

552
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:51,020
Okay?

553
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:56,280
Take this.

554
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,370
Bai Cai, remember,

555
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,870
don't come out

556
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:02,380
after you hide inside.

557
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,790
Be careful.

558
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:28,180
According to the oracle bone,

559
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,510
the girl is here.

560
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:30,760
Find the crystal.

561
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:32,100
If you find the members of the Demon Clan,

562
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,050
kill them all.

563
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:33,570
Bai Cai.

564
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:34,310
Search!

565
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:35,560
Yes.

566
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:40,920
She's here.

567
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:44,010
Come out!

568
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,190
Let go of me!

569
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:46,540
Let go of me!

570
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:47,370
Take her away.

571
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:50,290
Father! Father!

572
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:57,620
Bai Cai.

573
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:02,550
Father. Father.

574
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:10,550
Bai Cai.

575
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:11,500
Bai Cai, don't cry.

576
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,410
Father.

577
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,750
I'm sorry.

578
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:15,770
Father.

579
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:16,920
Promise me.

580
00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:19,980
Father.

581
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:21,870
Promise me you'll live well.

582
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,500
I'm going to remove your ears

583
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:26,620
to complete the seal.

584
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:51,110
No!

585
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,610
Father! Father!

586
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:55,750
Father, wake up.

587
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:59,340
Don't leave me behind.

588
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:03,850
Father! Father!

589
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:05,900
Father!

590
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:07,080
Father.

591
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,430
Since that incident,

592
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:13,310
no one has ever known

593
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:14,930
where the crystal is.

594
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:17,520
Thus, Hei Long was furious.

595
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,180
After you fell into a coma due to the poison that day,

596
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:21,740
when I treated you,

597
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:22,810
I found

598
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:24,560
something very interesting.

599
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:26,060
The cold poison

600
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,390
you said you were born with

601
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:28,210
is very similar

602
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:29,530
to the Crystal Glory.

603
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:31,230
I also found

604
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:33,350
an ancient divine spirit that has been sealed

605
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:34,880
in your body.

606
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:37,420
Who on earth are you?

607
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:39,960
Old Man,

608
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:42,390
I also want to ask you a question.

609
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,510
Can that oracle bone

610
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:46,530
predict

611
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,830
where the crystal is?

612
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:50,080
The Crystal Glory in your body

613
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,280
has been sealed.

614
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,640
So my oracle bone

615
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:56,500
is useless.

616
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:15,239
Are you the only one...

617
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,469
having the oracle bone?

618
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,690
It's the one and only in this world.

619
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:23,540
It was really you.

620
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,719
Who on earth are you?

621
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:41,210
Why have you been with Gou?

622
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:54,239
What's wrong, Master?

623
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,800
It's Gui Mu's Poison Locust.

624
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,670
I'm going to High Priest.

625
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:57,670
You go back first.

626
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,470
I saw

627
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:07,060
your eyes.

628
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:13,620
Kill me if you're capable.

629
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,550
Bai Cai!

630
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:26,340
Old Man, what do you want?

631
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:27,060
He...

632
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:27,940
He...

633
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:29,180
He is the one

634
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,960
who killed my parents!

635
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:33,750
What are you talking about?

636
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:35,580
When did I kill your parents?

637
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:37,450
Back then, I saw with my own eyes

638
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,540
the divine general who killed my parents

639
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,540
was holding the same oracle bone

640
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:42,060
in his hand.

641
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:45,870
Back then, my oracle bone

642
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:48,340
was stolen.

643
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:51,630
To find the oracle bone,

644
00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:53,210
I went

645
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:55,090
to the secret room you mentioned.

646
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:56,930
But when I arrived,

647
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:59,060
I only saw the divine general's body.

648
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:01,100
There was no one in the secret room.

649
00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:03,460
I can promise you

650
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:04,900
I never asked anyone

651
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:06,330
to kill your parents.

652
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:07,910
Now, everyone...

653
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:09,430
everyone is dead. No one can testify for you.

654
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:11,490
Why should I believe you?

655
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:23,060
Gou, do you think so too?

656
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:28,060
I don't know what you're talking about.

657
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:29,500
But I'm sure

658
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:32,570
you wanted to kill Bai Cai just now.

659
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,050
That was because I...

660
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,000
So you don't trust me at all.

661
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:48,990
High Priest,

662
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:50,840
I can't let Bai Cai

663
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:52,040
be in danger.

664
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:55,590
I'm going to take Bai Cai out of here first.

665
00:36:58,910 --> 00:36:59,710
Gou.

666
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:02,680
Gou!

667
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:09,170
Bai Cai,

668
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:11,250
it's my fault

669
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,660
that I brought you to Shenyin Village.

670
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:14,280
You wanted to leave before.

671
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:15,960
I didn't notice your anxiety.

672
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:17,900
I didn't care about your feelings.

673
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:18,830
I'm sorry.

674
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:21,330
It's okay, Gou.

675
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:23,410
You've improved a lot.

676
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,900
You're getting stronger.

677
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,600
Where should we go now?

678
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:28,840
Now...

679
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:36,430
It's Gui Mu.

680
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:38,340
It's Gui Mu's Poison Locust.

681
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:39,380
I'm going to High Priest.

682
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:40,490
You go back first.

683
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:42,170
Shenyin Village is in danger.

684
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:46,380
Bai Cai, I...

685
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,520
Are you going back?

686
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:49,000
Yes.

687
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:50,380
After all, Master and the others

688
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:51,730
taught me a lot.

689
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,590
I'm going back with you.

690
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:57,460
No, it's too dangerous.

691
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:58,450
Wait for me here.

692
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,820
I've always discriminated clearly between love and hate.

693
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,180
Besides, everyone else in Shenyin Village

694
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:03,270
treated me well.

695
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:05,030
I'm going to face it with you.

696
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:08,270
Okay, let's go.

697
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:12,270
High Priest,

698
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,950
I saw Gui Mu's Poison Locust in Shenyin Village.

699
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:17,510
Oh no. I'm afraid the location of Shenyin Village

700
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:18,700
has been exposed.

701
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,150
Inform everyone immediately.

702
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:20,810
Move to another place right now.

703
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:22,400
It's too late.

704
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:08,120
You came really fast.

705
00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:09,690
Little Gui Mu.

706
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,840
It's thanks to the little girl

707
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:13,790
you saved in the mine.

708
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:15,330
If it weren't for her,

709
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:17,150
I wouldn't have found

710
00:39:17,570 --> 00:39:18,400
your beautiful small village

711
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,270
so fast,

712
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:22,540
Mentor.

713
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:25,120
You took advantage of the corpse poison in Bai Cai's body

714
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,520
to play a trick.

715
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,610
You taught me well.

716
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:31,290
You know

717
00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:32,950
all my tricks.

718
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:35,630
I was careless

719
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:37,400
and fell into your trap.

720
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:39,160
But what?

721
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:40,590
Did your boss

722
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:42,100
send you here alone?

723
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:43,740
You underestimated me.

724
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:49,550
Of course not, Mentor.

725
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,260
I'm not the only one

726
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,920
looking for you.

727
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:57,190
High Priest,

728
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,610
I didn't have time

729
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:01,550
to tell you just now.

730
00:40:01,850 --> 00:40:05,290
I have found Fu Xi

731
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,080
and

732
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,840
those traitors.

733
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:10,630
Good.

734
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,420
Although your divine power has become weaker

735
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:15,400
since you got hurt,

736
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:17,500
you have become

737
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:19,460
more reliable.

738
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:22,230
After we capture those traitors,

739
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:25,010
I'll give you the medicine

740
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:27,470
to help you restore your divine spirit

741
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:29,520
and regenerate your lost limbs.

742
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:32,750
Assemble all our men in the Immortal Realm's six ministries.

743
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:34,190
You lead the way.

744
00:40:34,210 --> 00:40:36,940
I'm going to capture those traitors personally.

745
00:40:37,090 --> 00:40:39,110
Thank you, High Priest.

746
00:40:39,350 --> 00:40:41,880
I'm going to do it now.

747
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:43,440
Xinyue Kui,

748
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,560
I didn't tell you everything.

749
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:47,430
After you fulfill your promise,

750
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:48,850
I'll tell you

751
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,760
another secret.

752
00:40:51,330 --> 00:40:52,470
What do you think?

753
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,480
Mr. Fu Xi,

754
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,300
do you regret

755
00:40:58,090 --> 00:41:00,610
inviting disaster by letting in invaders?

756
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,510
You go inform everyone.

757
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:06,340
I'll deal with him.

758
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:07,660
Okay.

759
00:41:33,730 --> 00:41:35,960
It's you.

760
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,230
It's been a while.

761
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:42,540
I didn't expect you to improve so fast.

762
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:44,820
All my cultivation

763
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:45,540
is

764
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:47,540
for dealing with you, an evil deity.

765
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:56,650
Gou.

766
00:41:58,590 --> 00:41:59,390
Old Man,

767
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:00,880
we came back

768
00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:02,370
just for Shenyin Village.

769
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:05,290
Gou, Bai Cai,

770
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:06,860
I don't want to cause any misunderstanding

771
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:08,720
between you and Shenyin Village.

772
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,450
So whether you

773
00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:13,010
believe it or not,

774
00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:15,630
I'm going to tell you this.

775
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:18,440
My oracle bone

776
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:21,510
once was stolen by Xinyue Kui.

777
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:25,320
It led to the death

778
00:42:25,570 --> 00:42:26,740
of your parents.

779
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:28,840
Xinyue Kui?

780
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:30,710
Xinyue Kui

781
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:32,900
is the high priest of the Immortal Clan.

782
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:33,650
She is indeed

783
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:34,990
an evil woman.

784
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:36,570
But her fault

785
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:39,340
is my fault in essence.

786
00:42:40,010 --> 00:42:42,380
You should hate me.

787
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:43,510
Old Man,

788
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:45,160
what's your relationship

789
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:46,320
with Xinyue Kui?

790
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:00,540
Don't run around.
