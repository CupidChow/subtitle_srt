[Xin Capital]

00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:16,230
Our King is here.

6
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:30,350
Kill!

7
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,540
Impossible...

8
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,710
They actually hurt the immortals.

9
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:01,350
Looks like they're not ordinary humans.

10
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,620
My hand...

11
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,850
My hand!

12
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:16,310
From now on,

13
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:18,270
it's your turn

14
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:22,370
to fear us.

15
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:24,560
How dare you insult me

16
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:27,230
and the Immortal Clan?

17
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:28,950
This loser Gui Mu

18
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:29,920
has really brought disgrace

19
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,550
to the Immortal Clan.

20
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:33,710
He can't even defeat a mortal.

21
00:03:33,829 --> 00:03:35,510
I'm afraid, it's the end of his

22
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:37,510
position as the Immortal of the Wen.

23
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,160
Divine power!

24
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:42,480
Poison Locust!

25
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,670
Poison Locust will eat him up

26
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:02,200
till there's nothing left.

27
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,790
Turn into blood.

28
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:24,710
That's impossible.

29
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,990
He could have killed him with one strike,

30
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:00,250
yet he's holding back.

31
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:01,960
Xin King is playing with us.

32
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:03,290
No.

33
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:06,590
He insulted the Immortal Clan

34
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:08,400
to bring a message

35
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,630
to other people.

36
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:11,010
That the immortals

37
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:13,210
are not necessarily undefeatable.

38
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:24,390
Immortals...

39
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,430
You're nothing, immortals!

40
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:31,310
You are nothing!

41
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:47,470
Mortal! You're too arrogant!

42
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,230
Father!

43
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,590
Your Majesty.

44
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,830
You overestimated yourself.

Pull yourselves together.

50
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:11,950
Charge!

51
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:30,650
Let's see how long you can hold on.

52
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:47,780
Xin King, it's you?

53
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,409
A mortal

54
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:51,190
can actually block

55
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:53,790
Tian Kui's Golden Warrior Realm divine power.

56
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:55,360
I'm starting to admire him.

57
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,720
In the Immortal Realm

58
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:59,390
only a few

59
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:01,600
can hold Tian Kui's attack.

Golden Warrior Realm divine power.

61
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:02,670
A mortal

62
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:04,430
can't have such power.

63
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:06,670
This is the power of the Immortal Clan.

64
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:08,720
The power of the Immortal Clan?

65
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:10,170
Impossible.

66
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:12,230
He's just a mortal.

67
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,650
This human race

68
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:32,630
is really noisy.

69
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,190
Death upon you...

70
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,280
It's her?

00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,360
The Heart Moon Fox.

72
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:48,980
I didn't expect this.

73
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:52,150
The once priest, Heart Moon Fox,

74
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:56,110

My dear sister.

78
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:19,230
You finally used your divine power.

79
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:21,870
You've been hiding in the mortal world for so many years.

80
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:22,750
I

81
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,090
miss you so much.

82
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:32,640

83
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:35,230
Why do you have divine power?

84
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,740
Remember our promise!

85
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,580
Protect Geng!

86
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,790
Also,

87
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:54,520
what's going on with

88
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:55,990
Father's armor?

89
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:58,280
Geng.

90
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:01,560
I was a member of the Immortal Clan.

91
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:03,880
On your father's armor

92
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,590
is Undying Bird's spirit.

93
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:09,440
It has been hidden in the dungeon in the palace.

94
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:39,090
You're from the Immortal Clan?

95
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:40,160
Geng.

96
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,080
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

97
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:44,230
But it's a serious crime for the Immortal Clan to

98
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:45,760
leave for the mortal world.

99
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:51,160
All these years,

100
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,190
I've been avoiding

101
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:53,790
the Immortal Clan's murder.

102
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,430
I didn't tell you...

103
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:57,850
to protect you.

104
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:02,910
And now,

105
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:06,790
there's no need to hide anymore.

106
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,680
That armor is alive.

107
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:20,950
It's sucking away Xin King's blood.

108
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,360
A mortal will be born in the mortal world.

109
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,600
They walked through the valley of death

110
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,310
and fought alongside the Undying Bird.

111
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:32,750
In the end,

112
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,240
they will lead the human race to defeat the Immortal Clan.

113
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:37,690
This mortal

114
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,960
is the real God of War.

115
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:43,710
The prophecy that has been going around

116
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:44,840
in the Immortal Clan

117
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:47,150
doesn't look fake

118
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:49,750
now.

119
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,530
What a strong pressure!

120
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:34,720
The Colorless Realm divine power

121
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,250
is the strongest power in the Immortal Realm.

122
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:45,540
It's the divine power of the Colorless Realm.

123
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:46,840
Hei Long is here.

124
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:49,560
Hei Long?

125
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:52,550
The King of Immortals who created the three realms.

126
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:53,270
Hei Long never

127
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:54,890
interferes in the affairs of the mortal world.

128
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:56,310
There is only one possibility

129
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:57,460
that he is here.

130
00:13:58,110 --> 00:13:59,440
He found that your father

131
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,750
is extraordinary.

132
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,660
In that case, Father!

133
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:05,590
You can't go.

134
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,230
Don't let Hei Long find you.

135
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:37,950
Kneel!

136
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,920
You want to rebel against me?

137
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:54,040
Yes.

138
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:57,360
Under my Colorless Realm divine power,

139
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,560
you can still speak.

140
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,860
You're no ordinary slave.

141
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:03,980
We are humans.

142
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:06,520
Not slaves!

143
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:09,960
Human?

144
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:15,350
Without the Immortal Clan opening up the three realms,

145
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:16,670
creating everything,

146
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:19,080
you slaves

147
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,240
wouldn't have the chance to stand here.

148
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:24,110
Without Immortals,

149
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:28,000
the human race will still go on.

150
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:31,840
We have home and family.

151
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,380
We have love.

152
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:37,300
Love is power!

153
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,599
The Immortal Clan once predicted

154
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:24,760
that there will be a God of War of the human race

155
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:25,829
who'd defeat me.

156
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:30,190
What a joke.

157
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:32,750
I'm talking about you!

158
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:34,540
What a joke!

159
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:38,380
The great and noble King of Immortals Hei Long

160
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:39,860
came to the mortal world

161
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:42,310
just for a prediction.

162
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:45,560
Are you that afraid?

163
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:50,170
Are you that afraid of being defeated by the human race?

164
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,430
I understood when I saw you.

165
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:55,280
The prediction

166
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:59,070
is but a rumor.

167
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:01,870
With me around,

168
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:03,350
humans

169
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,270
will always be a slave.

170
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:19,840
The Undying Bird that you rely on

171
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:22,310
had its wings tore out by me

172
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:24,580
600 years ago.

173
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,190
I removeed its fire feathers one by one.

174
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:32,820
Just like today.

175
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:45,150
I'm of the human race,

176
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,580
your biggest fear!

177
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,550
Father!

178
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,560
Your Majesty!

179
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:20,590
Mother.

180
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:21,990
Let's go and help Father.

181
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:23,070
He can't hold on anymore!

182
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:24,430
No! You can't go.

183
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:25,360
Your father has prepared

184
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,350
to sacrifice.

185
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,030
This is his duty.

186
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:29,000
Mother.

187
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,590
I've already prepared

188
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:32,080
to die on the battlefield.

189
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,510
It's also my duty

190
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:35,120
to protect my homeland and state!

191
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,450
-Geng.
-Your Highness.

192
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:34,770
Geng!

193
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:51,440
Even with the divine power of the Undying Berd,

194
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,860
a slave

195
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,810
will always be a slave.

196
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:12,030
Your Majesty!

197
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,210
No!

198
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:31,630
It's him.

199
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:33,380
He's back.

200
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:34,640
Who is he?

201
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:37,860
He's your uncle, Ziyu.

202
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:39,150
Uncle Ziyu?

203
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,150
That great human swordsman

204
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:42,410
who killed immortals?

205
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:03,480
Qi cultivation?

206
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,830
It seems that humans

207
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:08,670
have good skills too.

208
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:09,400
Father!

209
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:10,280
Your Majesty!

210
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,230
Father!

211
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:12,030
Your Majesty.

212
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:18,970
Without divine power,

213
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:20,400
he can break through Hei Long's Colorless Wall

214
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,600
with just cultivated qi.

215
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:24,680
This human

216
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:27,190
deserves to be my opponent.

217
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:28,580
Ziyu.

218
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:31,180
You're back.

219
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:32,430
Brother.

220
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:34,430
When I left,

221
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,670
I promised you

222
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,310
I’d come back any time

223
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:38,710
if you need me.

224
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:41,940
I'm back today

225
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:43,670
to help you.

226
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:44,790
Good.

227
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:18,290
Great swordsman.

228
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:20,270
Let me play with you.

229
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:34,630
Your Majesty!

230
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,010
Undying Bird!

231
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:39,030
Burn my blood!

232
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,610
[Asura Realm divine power]

233
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:47,130
[Huang Lang]

234
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:03,230
Because of you,

235
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:04,990
the human race has lost so much blood

236
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:07,250
over the past tens of thousands of years!

237
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:08,880
Today,

238
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:11,600
I'll let you taste the taste of bleeding too!

239
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,200
Over the past 100,000 years,

240
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:15,270
you are the first mortal

241
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:16,800
who hurt me.

242
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:34,920
Your Majesty!

243
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,030
Brother.

244
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:25,270
You can still stand up?

245
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:58,920
Your Majesty.

246
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:03,190
Your Majesty.

247
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:05,350
He died standing up.

248
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:23,130
Great swordsman.

249
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:24,890
You're distracted.

250
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:26,540
The game

251
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:27,990
is over!

252
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:10,680
Your Majesty!

253
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:19,200
Your Majesty!

254
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:24,850
Father!

255
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:30,870
Father!

256
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:43,230
Your Majesty!

257
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:27,560
Father!

258
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:33,980
Father!

259
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:44,960
Geng, don't cry.

260
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:48,990
You are my son.

261
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:51,350
You're the Prince of Xin State.

262
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:53,000
Remember,

263
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:55,630
I'm not the one

264
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,200
who ended the war,

265
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,090
but you.

266
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,690
So you have to have the courage to fight the Immortals

267
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,650
and fulfill what

268
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:07,630
I was unable to complete.

269
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:09,590
Promise me.

270
00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:11,270
Promise me.

271
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,440
To protect our people

272
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:15,760
and Xin State.

273
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,670
You have to be strong.

274
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:21,420
Live on strong.

275
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:24,989
Your mother and I...

276
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,010
Your mother and I

277
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,960
will always be by your side.

278
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:38,480
Father!

279
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:48,110
Father!

280
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,159
Father!

281
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:08,080
Your Majesty!

282
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:29,160
In this painful mission,

283
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:31,470
I'm glad

284
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:33,000
you were always by my side

285
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,890
so that I never feel lonely.

286
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:38,640
We will meet again.

287
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,340
Before that,

288
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:45,790
please, for the last time,

289
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:49,390
protect our child.

290
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:35,720
[West Street]

291
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,160
Father!

292
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,300
Xin King, the God of War of the human race,

293
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,690
is also nothing

294
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:40,490
in front of the Immortal Clan.

295
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:41,950
The soldiers of Bai State

296
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:44,030
should be bow down to the Immortal Clan.

297
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:44,790
Charge!

298
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,820
General, be careful!

299
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:39,550
Your Highness!

300
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:41,890
The evil empress must be up there.

301
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:43,380
Go!

302
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:44,830
Hurry up!

303
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:15,990
Evil empress.

304
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,420
Catch them alive!

305
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:38,720
Where are you from?

306
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:39,600
Catch her!

307
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:40,720
Catch her!

308
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:47,290
How blind.

309
00:38:56,690 --> 00:38:57,740
You're from the Immortal Clan.

310
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:58,860
Sorry for just now.

311
00:38:58,890 --> 00:39:00,550
Please forgive me, Immortal.

312
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:09,070
Sister, you're so difficult to find.

313
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:12,000
I've been looking for you for years.

314
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,880
I didn't expect you to hide here

315
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:17,830
and had a child with a human.

316
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:21,210
Isn't it good to be a noble Immortal?

317
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,630
Why did you give up on yourself

318
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:26,070
and become a lowly person?

319
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:29,390
Because you're superior,

320
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:33,880
you don't understand the happiness of the mortal world.

321
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:38,030
I'm not here to quibble with you.

322
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:40,770
Now that Xin King is dead,

323
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:42,640
come back with me to the Immortal Realm

324
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,870
to be punished.

325
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:45,820
Maybe King of Immortals

326
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:47,770
will spare your life.

327
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:58,400
What if I don't go back with you?

328
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,750
It's not up to you.

329
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,190
Geng.

330
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:08,830
Geng.

331
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:15,390
Look at the son you gave birth to,

332
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:17,310
tainting the blood of the Immortal Clan.

333
00:40:17,310 --> 00:40:18,350
A mortal body

334
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:19,790
is weak.

335
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,870
I might as well kill him

336
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:23,980
in case he continues to live in the world

337
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:25,830
humiliating the Immortal Clan.

338
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,350
Admit defeat, sister.

339
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,070
You've lived in the human world for many years.

340
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:42,810
and neglected your skills.

341
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:45,120
You're no match for me.

342
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:45,910
I never thought

343
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:47,480
of being your opponent!

344
00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:05,510
Do you really want to die for the human race?

345
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:12,840
Mother...

346
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:15,250
What are you doing?

347
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,430
Geng.

348
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:20,360
Don't be afraid.

349
00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:23,420
It won't hurt soon.
