4
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:40,910
It's okay.

5
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:42,170
Daddy's here.

6
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:45,580
It hurts so much.

7
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:48,870
Don't worry, Daddy's here.

8
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:49,820
Daddy's here.

9
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,240
I won't let anything happen to you.

10
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:55,650
It hurts so much.

11
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:07,610
Daddy.

12
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,720
It doesn't hurt anymore.

13
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:13,270
-It doesn’t hurt anymore.
-Let Daddy take a look.

14
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:14,430
It doesn't hurt anymore.

15
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:15,310
Really?

16
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,390
Yes.

17
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,670
Who could have thought

18
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,860
the Crystal Glory has such powers?

19
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:24,370
Thank you for

20
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:25,640
saving my daughter.

21
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,070
Nitian Erxing,

22
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:30,160
it's your lucky day.

23
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,550
We'll settle the score

24
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:33,030
between you and me later.

25
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:35,350
Let's go, baby.

26
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:36,510
Let's go home.

00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,890
♫Why don't you go with them?♫

28
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,430

♫The land is a river made of desolation♫

33

♫And what are you?♫

35
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:19,910
It seems like Nitian Erxing

36
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:20,950
hasn't been idle all these years.

38
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:24,470

with Nitian Erxing

42
00:03:29,829 --> 00:03:31,150

Ms. Bai Cai.

56
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:02,110
Grand Marshal, please come in.

57
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:03,040
Come in and talk.

58
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:07,010
This place is a bit shabby.

59
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:08,270
I'm sorry, Miss.

60
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:10,430
Thank you for your concern, Grand Marshal.

61
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:11,550
This house is

62
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:12,870
pretty cozy to live in.

63
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:14,670
Did it...

64
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:16,800
bring back some memories of your past?

65
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:21,670
Not so much memories,

66
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:23,640
but there's a certain feeling.

67
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,680
I'm here today

68
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:28,950
to apologize

69
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,230
for forcing you

70
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,040
when we were at the cemetery.

71
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:34,790
I shouldn't have ignored how you felt

72
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:36,190
and forced you to recall

73
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:37,630
all those sad memories,

74
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:39,950
and make you accept

75
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:42,550
a whole new identity for yourself.

76
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:49,260
It's just that I cherish

77
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:51,340
each and every member of the Demon Clan.

78
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:52,270
I hope we can

79
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:53,870
band together in solidarity.

80
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:56,550
That's why I was so eager to meet you.

81
00:04:58,750 --> 00:04:59,670
It's okay.

82
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:02,820
I understand how you feel, Grand Marshal.

83
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:05,080
But I hope you can also understand that

84
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,310
I don't remember

85
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:09,600
what happened in my childhood.

86
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,630
In my memory,

87
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:13,390
I'm just

88
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:15,450
an ordinary orphan among the people.

89
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:20,470
Gou and I relied on each other for survival,

90
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:22,130
and we tried our best to live on

91
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,080
despite the tough environment.

92
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,300
The happiest thing that could happen

93
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,100
was when we had some herbs to sell

94
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,910
in exchange for a piece of meat.

95
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,730
Besides having the strange cold disease,

96
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:36,670
I'm no different from

97
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:39,010
the other girls in the mortal world.

98
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:41,630
Luckily, I met Gou.

99
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:42,790
He can relieve

100
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:44,110
my cold disease.

101
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:47,310
So what I've always wished for

102
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:49,670
was to lead

103
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:52,010
a simple, peaceful life with Gou,

104
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,780
that although could be tough,

105
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:55,270
but also happy.

106
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:00,590
Bai Cai.

107
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,350
I understand how you feel.

108
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,070
If I were you,

109
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:07,870
I would also not be able to accept the fact that

110
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:10,670
my identity for the past ten over years isn't real.

111
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:13,270
Or the fact that the place where I lived for more than ten years,

112
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,500
doesn't belong to me.

113
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,040
The past has been overturned.

114
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:20,710
The peaceful life of the past

115
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:22,710
will no longer exist.

116
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:26,710
Grand Marshal,

117
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:29,430
I'm overwhelmed by

118
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:31,310
what you've told me.

119
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:33,530
I hope that

120
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:36,080
I can just be most ordinary Bai Cai

121
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,560
from the past to the present,

122
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,350
and in the future.

123
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:42,550
I hope to continue living in the world

124
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:43,880
where there is just Gou.

125
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:47,500
But if...

126
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:50,600
if I don't accept

127
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,110
my real identity,

128
00:06:52,909 --> 00:06:54,230
does that mean I...

129
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:54,909
Bai Cai.

130
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,940
More than your acceptance of your new identity,

131
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,510
I want you to be happy.

132
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:02,270
I believe your parents

133
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:03,870
would think so too.

134
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:11,820
I believe

135
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:13,710
this is something you have lost.

136
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,270
In my memory,

137
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:18,110
it belongs to your mother.

138
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:21,470
Now, it belongs to you.

139
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,909
I will never abandon you

140
00:07:33,909 --> 00:07:34,950
as your mother.

141
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:36,390
Remember, no matter

142
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:38,020
where Mother and Father may be,

143
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:39,350
we will always love you.

144
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:40,320
Do you remember?

145
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:52,070
I've been looking for it for a long time.

146
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,710
Why do you have it?

147
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,150
After your parents

148
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:58,790
took you away from the Demon Clan,

149
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:00,540
they were nowhere to be seen or heard.

150
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,670
So I sent people to search everywhere.

151
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,560
But in the end,

152
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:05,880
I only found this necklace.

153
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,310
Grand Marshal.

154
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:15,070
Did you know my parents well?

155
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:17,870
What kind of people are they?

156
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,270
Your parents

157
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:22,360
were generals

158
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,890
under the command of my brother, Haikuo Tiankong.

159
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:26,620
They had great military achievements

160
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:28,280
and a formidable reputation,

161
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,830
were bold and resolute,

162
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,710
but also benevolent.

163
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:37,350
They practiced medicine within the Demon Realm,

164
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,030
to get rid of people's illnesses.

165
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:42,120
Unfortunately,

166
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,630
the Demon Realm is short of resources.

167
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:46,760
They had to travel thousands of miles

168
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,890
just to find medicine that could cure.

169
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,460
They loved each other.

170
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,830
Wherever your mother was,

171
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,900
your father would definitely be nearby.

172
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,150
Then they...

173
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,670
Why did they leave the Demon Realm

174
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,360
and go to the mortal world?

175
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:09,910
Unfortunately,

176
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,320
fate is a joke.

177
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:14,150
After my brother was killed by Shen Yan,

178
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,720
the Demon Realm was split apart.

179
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,350
The civil war would not stop.

180
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:21,440
Your parents were disheartened.

181
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:22,950
Besides,

182
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:25,120
you still had divine power inside you.

183
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,140
So they took you

184
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,270
to the mortal world.

185
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:29,950
They just hoped that

186
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:32,910
you could lead a happier life in the future.

187
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:34,630
Unexpectedly,

188
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:37,700
they were hunted by the Immortal Clan.

189
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,880
I sent people to look for you secretly,

190
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,670
but I couldn't find you.

191
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:54,710
It's been more than ten years.

192
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,430
When I saw that

193
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:57,910
you were still alive,

194
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:00,670
I was really happy.

195
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:09,270
How can you be sure that

196
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:10,910
I'm their daughter

197
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:12,790
just based on this Crystal Glory?

198
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:19,870
It's not only that.

199
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,010
It's because we're from the same clan,

200
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,020
so I can tell at a glance.

201
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:32,710
Father.

202
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:35,910
Mother.

203
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:16,210
Father, Mother.

204
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:49,310
Sir.

205
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:55,510
The Flower of Dawn

206
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:57,960
can dispel diseases and calamities.

207
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,390
One flower costs one spirit stone.

208
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:00,470
Buy three and get one free.

209
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:01,600
How many do you want?

210
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:04,320
I don't have spirit stones.

211
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,110
Sir,

212
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:14,270
is this flower really

213
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:15,530
as magical as you said?

214
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:19,030
You guys are from above the ground, aren't you?

215
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,950
How dare you!

216
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:23,950
The Flower of Dawn is our clan's sacred object.

217
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:26,350
How can you insult it like this?

218
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:32,070
Sir, the two of us

219
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:33,930
indeed just arrived at Demon Realm.

220
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:35,890
There are many things we don't understand.

221
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:36,710
I hope

222
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:38,070
you can tell us

223
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:39,630
the origin of this flower.

224
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:44,260
These flowers are from the Immortal Realm, called Flower of Dawn.

225
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,910
They can cure Petrification Sickness.

226
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:48,910
This flower

227
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:51,000
is from the Immortal Realm?

228
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:53,070
Ah Lan!

229
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:55,000
Have you seen it before?

230
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:57,050
No, I have never seen it.

231
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:59,070
It's the Immortal Realm.

232
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,260
How could you a little girl like you

233
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:01,510
have ever seen it?

234
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:04,070
Fortunately, the seal is  now broken.

235
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:06,440
Grand Marshal is about to lead his army,

236
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,830
fight their way into Immortal Realm,

237
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:08,950
and help our people

238
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:10,630
obtain the Flower of Dawn,

239
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:13,430
to save the people who are currently suffering.

240
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:16,710
My old bones

241
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:20,330
are already half-buried.

242
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:23,470
Well, that's something to look forward to.

243
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:24,880
Flower of Dawn.

244
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,660
Dispel diseases and calamities.

245
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:28,120
Buy three and get one free.

246
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:29,810
Anyone interested?

247
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,470
Although I can't guarantee

248
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:37,240
I can cure everyone,

249
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,750
but I will do my best.

250
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:39,880
One at a time, everybody.

251
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:40,830
Don't crowd.

252
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:42,570
Please take a look at me.

253
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:46,960
Make way! Make way!

254
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,320
Move!

255
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:51,750
Get up.

256
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:54,500
This leg of mine

257
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,030
is harder than a rock.

258
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,150
It really is.

259
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:00,710
Miss, you don't even know.

260
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:01,870
This stone plague

261
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:03,670
came out of nowhere.

262
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:05,930
It will then spread all over the body.

263
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,550
People like me

264
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:09,020
who has deep skills,

265
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:11,280
can live for seven or eight years at most.

266
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:12,540
What a pity.

267
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:13,970
Yes.

268
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,570
Is this disease contagious?

269
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:20,970
No, it can't spread between people.

270
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:22,750
But regardless whether you are young or old,

271
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:23,870
you will get this disease.

272
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:25,270
There's no choice.

273
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:50,330
Could there be a cure?

274
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:52,770
It's still there.

275
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:55,150
Sorry, I tried my best.

276
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:56,170
You...

277
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,210
My leg...

278
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:03,310
Let's go.

279
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:09,310
My leg doesn't hurt anymore.

280
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,140
Really?

281
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:17,510
Miss, you're amazing.

282
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:19,210
Please try it on me.

283
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:21,030
Please take a look at me.

284
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:22,070
One at a time, everybody.

285
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:24,000
Please don't push or crowd around.

286
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:48,910
Excuse me.

287
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:49,710
Move over.

288
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:51,750
Gou.

289
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:52,640
Bai Cai.

290
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:54,030
What's wrong?

291
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,870
I'm treating everyone.

292
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,830
I know you are.

293
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:58,710
But you have to

294
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:00,110
take care of your health.

295
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:01,790
Gou.

296
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:03,660
The Crystal Glory can cure Petrification Sickness.

297
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,070
Isn't that a good thing?

298
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:06,990
Judging from your complexion,

299
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:08,750
you're definitely overstretching yourself.

300
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,610
Healing others is not your forte.

301
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:12,140
There are thousands of people suffering from Petrification Sickness

302
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:13,310
in the Demon Clan.

303
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:15,390
Just with your efforts alone,

304
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:16,900
your body won't even make it

305
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:19,360
before you could even save just a few of them.

306
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:24,270
Everyone, we will call it a day.

307
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,070
Please leave.

308
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:26,990
What should we do?

309
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:28,670
I've been waiting for so long.

310
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:30,470
We're all suffering.

311
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:32,470
Why don't you just take a look at me?

312
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:36,230
Everyone, wait.

313
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,730
We're saved.

314
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:39,990
Gou,

315
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:41,070
you can't stop doing what's right

316
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:42,310
just because

317
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,400
we're weak.

318
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:45,910
Bai Cai.

319
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:47,710
Do you want to die?

320
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:50,390
If you can really help the Demon Clan

321
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:51,630
eradicate their pain and suffering,

322
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:53,310
I will definitely support you.

323
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:54,070
But I don't want you

324
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:55,310
to be doing so on the premise that

325
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:56,070
you are sacrificing your own body,

326
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:57,310
to do this here.

327
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,270
Bai Cai, Gou is right.

328
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:09,480
The Crystal Glory

329
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,390
is not like the divine power from the Immortality Realm,

330
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:12,740
which has the ability to heal.

331
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,150
For you,

332
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:15,270
you are putting your life in danger

333
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:18,670
with sustained and substantial consumption of your energy.

334
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,069
From now on, without my orders,

335
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:22,750
no one is allowed

336
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:23,910
to disturb Ms. Bai Cai.

337
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:24,630
Yes.

338
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:28,349
All of you go back!

339
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:29,430
Don't disturb

340
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:30,350
Ms. Bai Cai anymore.

341
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,070
Go back.

342
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:34,430
With my condition, I can't wait much longer.

343
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:37,830
Go back.

344
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:42,480
Come with me.

345
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,080
What's wrong?

346
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:50,110
It's nothing.

347
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:52,560
I didn't sleep well last night.

348
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:56,470
Your body is all cold,

349
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:58,210
and you still say you're fine?

350
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:59,270
Go get some rest.

351
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:32,950
How do you feel?

352
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:34,680
I feel much better.

353
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:37,870
You shall not do this

354
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:39,200
to yourself ever again.

355
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:41,680
Got it.

356
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:46,500
Gou, let me tell you a secret.

357
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:48,690
Don't be angry anymore, will you?

358
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:50,010
What secret?

359
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:53,930
If you don't want to hear it, that's fine.

360
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:55,230
I want to hear it.

361
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:56,880
Who said I don't want to hear it?

362
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,310
As long as it's your word,

363
00:18:58,330 --> 00:18:59,550
I want to hear it

364
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:01,210
no matter what secret that is.

365
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:04,950
Do you remember

366
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:07,280
what was your home like when you were a kid?

367
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,270
I don't really remember.

368
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:13,270
But I remember.

369
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,530
The stone mountains here,

370
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:16,670
the stone houses,

371
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:17,670
and the candles that never goes out,

372
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:19,400
which every household lights.

373
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:20,670
From the moment

374
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:21,750
I came here,

375
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:22,670
I knew

376
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:24,150
this is my home.

377
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:25,550
This is where I was born.

378
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:30,990
You mean...

379
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:31,980
I'm from the Demon Clan.

380
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,510
Demon Realm is my hometown.

381
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:36,610
You are part of the Demon Clan?

382
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:43,590
I didn't tell you before

383
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,830
because

384
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:46,430
I didn't want to admit it.

385
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:48,470
That's because some of my childhood memories

386
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:49,540
were too painful.

387
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:50,910
Besides,

388
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:52,030
I even led

389
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:53,360
a normal person's life.

390
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:54,510
It was the last thing

391
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:55,910
my parents wanted for me.

392
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,240
But when I came back this time,

393
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:01,510
I saw my people suffering.

394
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,810
That was when I decided

395
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:05,430
I must not continue hiding it.

396
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:07,630
I want to shoulder the burden with them.

397
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:13,590
No matter

398
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:14,920
which clan you are from,

399
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:16,960
you are the Bai Cai that started

400
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,270
this journey with me from the mine,

401
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:20,330
and we have made it this far together.

402
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:22,790
It's just that

403
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:24,550
our visit to Demon Realm

404
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:26,410
was probably all part of the plan.

405
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:28,800
No matter what we do in the future,

406
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,070
you have to promise me.

407
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:32,630
Firstly, you must protect yourself.

408
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:34,490
Don't make me worry anymore.

409
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:39,820
Okay, I promise you.

410
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,060
Actually, I totally understand.

411
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:46,830
As long as someone needs help,

412
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:48,670
you will definitely help.

413
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:49,870
Otherwise,

414
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:51,510
you're not Bai Cai.

415
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:53,270
Gou.

416
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:55,310
I knew you would understand me.

417
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:00,810
In the past few days,

418
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:01,870
we've seen

419
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:03,470
the suffering of Demon Clan.

420
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:07,470
Since this is your hometown,

421
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,410
and they are all your clansmen,

422
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:11,430
I promise you that

423
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:12,960
I will try my best

424
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:15,270
to find a way to save Demon Clan.

425
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:22,270
Gou.

426
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:23,670
I'm part of the Demon Clan now.

427
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:24,800
Are you afraid of me?

428
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,360
What's there to be afraid of?

429
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:31,940
You don't have pointy ears.

430
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:35,270
Wait.

431
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:37,630
Why do I feel that

432
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:39,750
your ears have been getting pointy

433
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:40,910
in the past two days?

434
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,590
What are you looking at?

435
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:46,730
Is it really getting pointy?

436
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:54,910
Bai Cai.

437
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:56,350
If...

438
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:57,960
I mean if...

439
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:01,350
If I also tell you

440
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:02,630
one of my secrets in the future,

441
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:03,150
will you...

442
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:03,910
Gou.

443
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:06,380
Everyone

444
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:08,470
has their own secrets.

445
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:11,000
You can tell me

446
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:12,560
when you feel like it.

447
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:13,470
Right?

448
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:18,310
Yes.

449
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:38,410
Is Bai Cai feeling better now?

450
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:39,710
Much better.

451
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:43,440
From now on,

452
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,310
she can't be

453
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:47,190
consuming her own energy

454
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:48,950
to treat patients like what she did today.

455
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:49,790
Her body

456
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:51,150
can't take it.

457
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:52,870
Yes.

458
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:54,950
It is indeed pitiful that

459
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:56,160
those in Demon Clan

460
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:58,150
suffer from Petrification Sickness.

461
00:22:58,150 --> 00:22:59,510
I must find a way

462
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:00,750
to relieve them.

463
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:04,110
Bai Cai... is part of the Demon Clan,

464
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:06,110
right?

465
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:09,770
You know it too?

466
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:12,110
What's up with

467
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:14,210
the ancient divine power in her body?

468
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:16,120
And when she was in King's City,

469
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:17,350
she used her divine power

470
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:19,410
to unlock Shi Xing's Seal of the Dead.

471
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,190
And when she's here in Demon Clan,

472
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:24,110
she can even treat patients with Petrification Sickness.

473
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:25,250
All of these...

474
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:31,630
Bai Cai!

475
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:33,270
Ah Lan.

476
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:34,950
Do you know on the day of the attack

477
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:36,080
at Shenyin Village,

478
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:39,180
Grandpa tried to kill Bai Cai?

479
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:40,430
Really?

480
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:42,200
I've always felt that

481
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:44,410
he didn't do it

482
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:46,750
simply because of a misunderstanding.

483
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:49,110
Did Grandpa ever had a prophecy

484
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:50,470
regarding Bai Cai?

485
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:53,510
Did he tell you anything?

486
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:56,840
Gou.

487
00:23:57,710 --> 00:23:58,950
You only need to know

488
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:01,910
everything the High Priest did

489
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:03,580
was for you.

490
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:08,440
Okay.

491
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:11,350
Ah Lan.

492
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:13,990
I want to form an alliance with the Demon Clan

493
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:15,720
and attack the Immortal Realm.

494
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:17,590
Will you and your folks at Shenyin Clan

495
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:18,790
be willing to join us?

496
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:22,870
You have seen

497
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:23,870
the way the Demon Clan

498
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:25,160
treats the Immortal Clan.

499
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,750
It's so indiscriminate.

500
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:28,180
I came here

501
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:29,910
just to protect you.

502
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:31,190
As for the rest,

503
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:32,880
it has nothing to do with me.

504
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:35,430
I know.

505
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:37,710
Shenyin Clan has always been

506
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:39,550
living by the principle of hiding from the the world and avoiding disaster,

507
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:40,680
in order to survive.

508
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:44,310
This time, our tribe was massacred,

509
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:47,350
our families destroyed, and we were forced to be displaced.

510
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:48,810
We can't avoid it anymore.

511
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:49,950
Lan.

512
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:51,790
We have no other choice

513
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,390
but to join in the battle.

514
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:55,790
Besides,

515
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:57,920
it's hard to survive as a lone tree.

516
00:24:58,190 --> 00:24:59,670
To save my grandpa,

517
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:01,630
we need the help of the Demon Clan.

518
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:03,870
You know that

519
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:05,300
as well as I do,

520
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:06,550
right?

521
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:15,710
Gou.

522
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:17,440
Why are we here at the cemetery?

523
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:19,990
We're heading to

524
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:22,310
where the ancestors of Demon Clan were buried.

525
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:23,770
They were buried together

526
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:25,470
with their memories.

527
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:27,710
If you want to get to know a place,

528
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:29,840
you not only have to see their present,

529
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:31,870
but also understand their past.

530
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:35,630
Gou.

531
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:48,760
Don't be afraid.

532
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:05,140
Excuse me, it's already late.

533
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:06,630
Where are you going?

534
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:08,930
What a ridiculous thing to say

535
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:10,840
as the younger generation.

536
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:14,220
Do I have to choose a time to die?

537
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:15,150
Move!

538
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:17,790
I need to bid farewell

539
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:20,510
to my Grand Marshal.

540
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:22,120
If I'm late,

541
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:24,300
I won't have a chance.

542
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:26,030
Is that person Nitian Erxing?

543
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:28,210
Nitian Erxing?

544
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:30,870
The Grand Marshal I mentioned

545
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:34,880
is the greatest commander of Demon Clan

546
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,070
in the past 100,000 years.

547
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:41,390
He is a hero who led

548
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:43,960
Demon Clan towards glory.

549
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:48,990
No, not right now.

550
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:50,550
It's disrespectful to our ancestors

551
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:52,370
if you die here.

552
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:53,830
Hang in there.

553
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:56,070
We're almost there. Let's go.

554
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:02,720
Turns out...

555
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:05,120
they are all going to the cemetery.

556
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:08,070
Looks like what Grand Marshal said is true.

557
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:09,350
Let's go.

558
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:10,830
Let's follow them.

559
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:34,620
This should be the tomb of

560
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:38,950
[Tomb of Brother Haikuo Tiankong]

561
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:36,990
the Grand Marshal which they were talking about.

562
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:38,470
Haikuo Tiankong.

563
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:44,870
I won't be able to wait for the Flower of Dawn.

564
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:48,270
I have no regrets if I die

565
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,470
with the Grand Marshal.

566
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:53,690
Grand Marshal.

567
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:54,890
In the next life...

568
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:56,950
I'll be your soldier in the next life.

569
00:27:58,390 --> 00:28:00,710
I'll be your soldier in the next life.

570
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:29,710

I don't want to die.

573
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:41,270
It's so unfair.

574
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:43,670
I thought

575
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,670
everyone is equal in the face of death.

576
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:47,000
But I didn't expect that

to the Demon Clan,

578
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:49,350
even a normal death

579
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:50,910
has become a luxury.

581
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,710

582
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:55,640
the last dignity of the Demon Clan.

583
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:03,870
I must save Demon Clan.

584
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:06,830
I must save those who are bullied,

585
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:08,630

00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:26,430
You'd better figure out

646
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:29,310
whether you are holding the antidote

647
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:31,330

It's just a lie

that it can cure Petrification Sickness.

00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:05,390
Its pollen

658
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:07,950

your Air Vanishing Spell

680
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:23,430

Go back and tell Rou

that I'm sorry.

690
00:35:58,230 --> 00:35:59,950

and accompany her to the end.

692
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:04,870

693
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:07,990

I've hurt you. I'm sorry.

695
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:12,350
Remember,

696
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:16,390
the truth of the Flower of Dawn cannot be known to others.

697
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:18,080
It is the only reason

698
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:21,730
that is keeping Demon Clan alive.

699
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:27,150
Do you remember our oath?

700
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:49,590
You'll have to

701
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,790
complete it for me.

702
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:13,870
I promise you.

00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,070
no matter what

713
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:34,600
Nitian Erxing's attitude is after 7 days,

714
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:36,320
I want to help the Demon Clan

715
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:37,520
regain its freedom.

716
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:40,920
The hardships they are experiencing now,

717
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:41,990
in my opinion,

718
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:43,430
are no different from

719
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:44,760
the people of Xin State.

720
00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:46,910
Besides, we're compatriots.

721
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:48,510
I won't sit back and watch.

722
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:53,620
Is he really bearing this huge lie all alone,

723
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:54,430
just for a sliver

724
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:55,910

725
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:00,510
Nitian Erxing.

726
00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:03,030
What kind of person are you?

727
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:05,540
Let me ask you.

728
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:07,150
Did you see it clearly?

729
00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:09,430
I saw it clearly.

730
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:10,840
It was that woman.

731
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,470
It was because of her

732
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:14,110
that I lost an arm.

733
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:15,310
Even if she turns into ashes,

734
00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:16,590
I still remember her.

735
00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:20,430
No wonder Nitian Erxing

736
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:22,490
took it upon himself to take her away.

737
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:24,910
She turns out to be a big treasure.

738
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:28,030
Your Majesty.

739
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:33,840
Your Majesty, someone ran away again.

740
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:35,670
Didn't I pass the order?

741
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:36,870
If you dare to betray me,

742
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:37,870
you'll be a traitor,

743
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:39,430
and I will chop them up and eat them.

744
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:40,710
There are too many of them.

745
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:42,310
They all went to see Physician Bai.

746
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:43,670
We couldn't stop them at all.

747
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:45,670
They said since they are going to die sooner or later,

748
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:47,270
as long as they can have just

749
00:39:47,270 --> 00:39:49,030
two days where they feel completely comfortable,

750
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:51,640
it will be all worth it.

751
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:54,010
Nitian Erxing.

752
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:57,550
You played dirty.

753
00:39:57,870 --> 00:39:59,800
You don't even need a knife to kill.

754
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:01,400
I've worked so hard

755
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:02,070
all these years

756
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:03,330
to build up this tribe.

757
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:04,670
He swallowed us up

758
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:06,200
without even a single word.

759
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:07,470
Your Majesty,

760
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:08,470
we were the ones

761
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:09,350
who found

762
00:40:09,350 --> 00:40:10,230
Physician Bai first.

763
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:10,710
If we consider that,

764
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:12,570
she should be part of your people.

765
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:14,630
Your Majesty!

766
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,210
Bad news, Your Majesty!

767
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:19,730
Please go and see Young Master.

768
00:40:19,730 --> 00:40:21,270
Young Master's the stone plague is acting up again.

769
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:22,330
Little Dragonfly.

770
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:31,430
Be good.

771
00:40:31,450 --> 00:40:32,540
My dear.

772
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:34,260
My dear.

773
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:45,050
Daddy.

774
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:47,190
Daddy's here.

775
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:49,800
It doesn't hurt.

776
00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:52,740
I am brave.

777
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:56,090
I won't cry.

778
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:01,550
How is my daughter?

779
00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:03,430
How is my daughter?

780
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:05,190
Your Majesty,

781
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:06,270
Young Master...

782
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:07,360
I'm afraid...

783
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:09,530
she can't make it through this year.

784
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:16,870
Daddy,

785
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:20,510
will I be able to

786
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:23,600
meet Mom very soon?

787
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:32,440
My dear.

788
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:35,150
If you go and meet your mom,

789
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:37,700
what about Daddy?

790
00:41:40,770 --> 00:41:41,750
Don't be afraid.

791
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:43,320
Don't be afraid.

792
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,650
I won't let anything happen to you.

793
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:47,990
Father.

794
00:41:48,970 --> 00:41:50,350
I'll take you to

795
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:51,790
Physician Bai right now.

796
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:52,870
Let's go.

797
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:56,030
Gather the team

798
00:41:56,030 --> 00:41:57,430
and head to Nitian Tribe!

799
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:04,030
Lan.

800
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:07,030
Do you know who is Shen Yan?

801
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:08,870
How do you know him?
