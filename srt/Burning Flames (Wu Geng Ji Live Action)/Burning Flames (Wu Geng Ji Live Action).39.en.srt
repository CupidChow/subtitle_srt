00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:01,670
Why has the Immortal Clan

192
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:03,390
become so lowly?

193
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:05,400
We demons are not like you guys,

194
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:07,190
who blather on and on.

195
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:08,839
Even if we can't defeat you,

196
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:11,630
we'd rather put up a desperate fight.

197
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:26,069
Hei Long,

198
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:28,109
in order to survive,

199
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:30,450
you fought for 100,000 years.

200
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:33,390
In order to save me,

201
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:36,520
you killed people for another 100,000 years.

202
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:38,310
But after 100,000 years,

203
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:41,310
when I opened my eyes,

204
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,790
the first thing I saw

205
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:46,200
is

206
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:50,910
a wrath-forged blade.

207
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,130
It's like old immortals

208
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:57,030
being driven to the underground world.

209
00:17:58,150 --> 00:17:59,830
Whether we were enemies

210
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:01,110
or friends,

211
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:03,150
lava could be spewed out

212
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:04,750
once again.

213
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:10,060
I can fight with fate

214
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,590
for another 100,000 years,

215
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:15,340
until it brings you back to me.

216
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:18,190
Hei Long,

217
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:22,370
there are many things that can't be changed.

218
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:24,510
Why don't you let it take its course?

219
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:28,480
The human race,

220
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:30,630
the Demon Clan,

221
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,320
and all the living creatures in this world

222
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,000
have the right to love.

223
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:42,590
The love among them

224
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:44,590
is the same

225
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:46,310
as your love for me.

226
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,080
What do you want me to do?

227
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:09,720
Don't kill the innocent.

228
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:12,170
Just force them to retreat.

229
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:15,630
Since it's what you want,

230
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:17,710
I'll do as you wish.

231
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,510
I don't want

232
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:33,510
to waste my time on trivial matters.

233
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:35,610
You guys attack together.

234
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:37,410
Don't move.

235
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,030
Leave Hei Long to me.

236
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,430
The combination of the qi cultivation technique

237
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:08,750
and the divine power of the Colorless Realm

238
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,800
has increased the power of the punch.

239
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,820
What a wonderful combination.

240
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,420
It's been 100,000 years.

241
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:29,260
I didn't expect a humble mortal

242
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,780
to hurt me.

243
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,200
Hei Long, you're so arrogant.

244
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:39,750
I'm going to make you pay with your blood today.

245
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:43,540
I always thought

246
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:44,630
the human race's power

247
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:46,150
is weak.

248
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:48,750
You surprised me.

249
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,190
This is...

250
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:24,820
The power is familiar.

251
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:28,130
I didn't expect that these people

252
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:29,740
can make Hei Long

253
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:31,710
use the ancient blood spear.

254
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:34,980
It's indeed a surprise.

255
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:37,190
I thought

256
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:39,610
he could fight with Hei Long

257
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,520
for longer.

258
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:43,360
This is better.

259
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:47,070
Even fate

260
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:48,550
is on our side.

261
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:50,310
Looks like

262
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:51,830
that legend has given them

263
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:54,150
the faith to defeat Hei Long.

264
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:00,150
The legend is just

265
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:01,910
a way to enslave them.

266
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:04,310
They actually think

267
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:06,150
they can defeat Hei Long.

268
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:08,850
It's a daydream.

269
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:12,630
It's time to carry out the follow-up plan.

270
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:14,720
No hurry.

271
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:17,230
Let them deplete

272
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:19,160
more of Hei Long's power.

273
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:51,400
If you have anything

274
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,550
worth my reevaluation,

275
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:57,190
prove it with your hands.

276
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:00,150
Don't make me think

277
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:01,790
I'm wasting my time.

278
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:36,230
Liu Yue,

279
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,910
what should we do?

280
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:46,040
-Elder.
-Elder.

281
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:47,710
The rebels have fought their way into the Crystal Mountain.

282
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:48,910
Should we go?

283
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:51,310
Elder,

284
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,900
if Immortal King blames us...

285
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:56,470
Don't say anything.

286
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:58,470
Come in with me.

287
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:01,920
I have a more important task

288
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,110
to give you.

289
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:07,830
But

290
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:10,670
the defense power of the Tomb of Heaven...

291
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:12,920
It has disappeared.

292
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:56,050
What is that?

293
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:02,390
This mortal is amazing.

294
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:05,460
He has forced Hei Long to use the white wall.

295
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:07,490
In that white light,

296
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:08,920
any living thing

297
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,790
will be destroyed and killed.

298
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:30,310
Oh no!

299
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:37,350
Gou!

300
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:43,630
This is all your power

301
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:45,950
for the decisive battle.

302
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:49,710
You are arrogant,

303
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:51,740
but your power is weak.

304
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,120
Now,

305
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:55,470
I'm going to show you

306
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:58,350
the price of disobeying immortals.

307
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:17,750
Gou.

308
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:19,790
Gou, I'm here.

309
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:21,060
Gou, it's okay.

310
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:25,190
Bai Cai, don't cry.

311
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:27,830
There's nothing worth crying over.

312
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:29,070
This battle

313
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:30,950
is not over yet.

314
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:34,350
Gou.

315
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:35,550
Gou, listen to me.

316
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:36,630
Gou.

317
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:38,480
Gou, you can't die.

318
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:39,550
Gou.

319
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:41,180
Who said I'm going to die?

320
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:42,440
I...

321
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:51,650
I still have a lot of things...

322
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:55,550
a lot of things to do.

323
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:57,550
We...

324
00:26:58,670 --> 00:26:59,830
can't give up.

325
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:02,350
We won't give up, Gou.

326
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:04,490
We won't give up, Gou.

327
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:05,590
Bai Cai.

328
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:08,960
Don't cry.

329
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:12,830
I just...

330
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:15,030
want...

331
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:16,880
want to...

332
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,360
have a rest.

333
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:37,790
Gou.

334
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:39,670
Gou.

335
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:44,790
Gou, listen to me.

336
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,090
Don't fall asleep.

337
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:49,110
Gou.

338
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:51,870
Don't fall asleep, okay?

339
00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:00,350
Gou!

340
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:04,630
Gou.

341
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:11,200
Gou.

342
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:12,880
I'm here.

343
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:15,370
Gou, I'm here.

344
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:17,470
Let me take you home, okay?

345
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,270
We'll stop fighting.

346
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:20,710
Gou.

347
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:30,550
Wu Geng,

348
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:34,670
you've accomplished your mission.

349
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:38,340
I will

350
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:41,670
kill Hei Long for you.

351
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:47,140
Elder,

352
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:49,400
what formation is this?

353
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:50,630
We have injected

354
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:51,870
so much divine power,

355
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:55,390
but it's not reacting at all.

356
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:02,230
This is an ancient formation.

357
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:04,640
It's called Immortal Sealing.

358
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:08,270
After being refined by this formation,

359
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,790
the divine spirit will eventually become

360
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:11,720
the energy of the Crystal Mountain

361
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:13,830
to reciprocate the Immortal Realm.

362
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:18,100
The spirit and blood of immortals

363
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:23,110
are essential

364
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:24,640
to activate the formation.

365
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:37,350
You two are basically qualified

366
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:38,960
to offer the spirit and blood

367
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:42,710
needed to activate the formation.

368
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:44,310
Liu Yue.

369
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:08,510
Is my time coming?

370
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:22,980
A kind of ancient power is reviving.

371
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:24,110
Someone activated

372
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:25,970
the seal of the Crystal Mountain.

373
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:29,690
The ancient forbidden spell.

374
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:34,710
Bai Long.

375
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:13,350
Someone removed

376
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:15,210
the seal of the Crystal Mountain.

377
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:16,950
To remove the seal,

378
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:18,870
he has to use the ancient forbidden spell

379
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:20,350
to control

380
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:22,080
the power of the Crystal Glory.

381
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:23,130
Could it be....

382
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:25,600
an ancient old immortal

383
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:28,400
has been hiding in the Immortal Realm?

384
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:52,390
Geng.

385
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:58,750
Geng.

386
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,990
I heard

387
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:19,400
once the crystal seal is removed,

388
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:21,590
the world will be destroyed.

389
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:24,550
The Crystal Glory

390
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:27,270
is the key

391
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:29,830
to removing the seal of the Crystal Mountain.

392
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:28,190
It's Gen Gu.

393
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:39,830
Hei Long.

394
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:45,990
Bai Long.

395
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:52,230
Great Hei Long,

396
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:55,920
are you surprised?

397
00:33:57,630 --> 00:33:59,110
This is the Immortal Sealing Formation

398
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:01,640
established with the ancient divine power

399
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,290
sealed in the Crystal Mountain.

400
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:06,350
It's a spell

401
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:08,570
that can't be undone.

402
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:11,630
Even though you are very powerful,

403
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:14,230
once you're hit by the formation,

404
00:34:14,949 --> 00:34:15,949
your divine power

405
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:20,030
will be suppressed to less than 10%.

406
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:22,230
Hei Long,

407
00:34:22,659 --> 00:34:24,900
you are destined

408
00:34:24,989 --> 00:34:26,790
to die today.

409
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:30,870
I've been waiting for 100,000 years.

410
00:34:30,929 --> 00:34:32,830
Today, I'm going to take back

411
00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:35,110
the title of King of Immortals.

412
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:36,190
Gen Gu,

413
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:39,830
you are still so despicable and shameless

414
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:41,670
as you were 100,000 years ago.

415
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:54,790
The Immortal Sealing Formation can seal all kinds of divine power.

416
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:55,630
Today,

417
00:34:56,350 --> 00:34:59,230
I'd like to see how you can break the formation.

418
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,100
Shen Yan,

419
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:03,810
how dare you betray me!

420
00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:09,580
It's time to end

421
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:11,900
your rule over the three realms.

422
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:16,100
I will lead the Immortal Clan.

423
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:17,550
I

424
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:22,330
am going to destroy you myself.

425
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:43,740
She has reached her limit.

426
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:46,480
I didn't expect it to be so fast.

427
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:49,070
Bai Long.

428
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:51,750
Hei Long,

429
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:55,950
don't be obsessed with our past.

430
00:35:57,350 --> 00:35:58,830
Free yourself.

431
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:01,810
Free everyone.

432
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:10,480
Goodbye, Hei Long.

433
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:16,990
I don't care about the three realms.

434
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:21,230
I'm not as great as you think.

435
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:24,830
Everything I did

436
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:28,350
is for you.

437
00:37:11,790 --> 00:37:12,710
Bai Long.

438
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:23,120
Gen Gu,

439
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:25,350
I'm going to kill you today

440
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:27,310
to avenge Bai Long!

441
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:05,080
You are overconfident.

442
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:07,350
Who do you think you are

443
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:09,630
to challenge the power of the Creator?

444
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:11,920
Hei Long,

445
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:13,310
you're going to die.

446
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:15,550
Accept your fate.

447
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:17,030
Fate?

448
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:20,310
If I can't

449
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:21,510
be with the one I love,

450
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,730
even if it's fate,

451
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:26,570
I'll crush it in one go!

452
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,590
You actually can use the divine power of the Colorless Realm

453
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:46,320
for the divine manifestation.

454
00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:51,830
I haven't saved Gou yet.

455
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:53,870
I can't let his plan succeed.

456
00:38:57,830 --> 00:38:58,920
Uncle Ziyu,

457
00:38:58,920 --> 00:38:59,630
destroy

458
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:01,390
the crystal in front of me.

459
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:02,780
Hurry!

460
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:07,590
The Crystal Glory is a kind of ancient divine power.

461
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:09,650
Even Hei Long can't handle it easily.

462
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:12,360
It's almost impossible to destroy it.

463
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:14,270
How would we know if we don't try?

464
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:08,090
No, it's impossible.

465
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:09,740
Impossible!

466
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:18,590
Impossible.

467
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:20,750
It's impossible

468
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:22,920
to resist the power of the Creator.

469
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,470
Uncle Ziyu.

470
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:04,950
Gou.

471
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:12,940
Gou.

472
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:14,950
We'll stop fighting.

473
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:17,390
Let's go home, okay?

474
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,920
Gou, let's go home.

475
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:36,990
Gou.

476
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:39,190
Uncle Ziyu,

477
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:41,430
Gou is still alive, Uncle Ziyu.

478
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:43,690
Gou.

479
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:46,110
Gou.

480
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:21,190
Bai Long is dead.

481
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:28,130
There's no chance of bringing her back to life again.

482
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:30,630
In that case,

483
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:37,090
I'm going to destroy the three realms

484
00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:41,950
to make this world

485
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:46,130
return to chaos

486
00:42:50,870 --> 00:42:52,470
and start from nothing.

487
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:05,940
You ants,

488
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,920
perish with me.

489
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:25,230
Luanwu Kuangdao,

490
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:26,750
give up your weapon!

491
00:44:36,190 --> 00:44:37,400
Luanwu Kuangdao!

492
00:44:38,030 --> 00:44:38,940
Kuangdao!

493
00:44:39,110 --> 00:44:40,070
Kuangdao!

494
00:44:40,670 --> 00:44:43,070
Hei Long has the power to destroy the world.

495
00:44:43,150 --> 00:44:44,410
Since Bai Long is dead,

496
00:44:44,430 --> 00:44:45,990
he is determined to die.

497
00:44:46,070 --> 00:44:47,830
Looks like he's going to make the three realms

498
00:44:47,830 --> 00:44:49,160
perish with him.

499
00:44:49,550 --> 00:44:50,590
Hang in there!

500
00:44:59,670 --> 00:45:00,470
Gou,

501
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:01,990
I know you can

502
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:02,950
hear me.

503
00:45:03,390 --> 00:45:05,550
Hei Long wants to destroy the three realms.

504
00:45:05,550 --> 00:45:06,990
Only you can save us.

505
00:45:07,550 --> 00:45:08,390
Gou,

506
00:45:08,590 --> 00:45:10,120
wake up, okay?

507
00:45:11,110 --> 00:45:11,910
Gou.

508
00:45:15,590 --> 00:45:17,060
Gou!

509
00:45:21,630 --> 00:45:23,470
Gou, wake up, okay?

510
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:24,600
Gou.

511
00:45:32,950 --> 00:45:34,680
Gou.

512
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:47,790
Gou.

513
00:45:48,870 --> 00:45:49,890
Gou.

514
00:45:51,630 --> 00:45:52,630
Gou.

515
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:56,230
Wu Geng.
