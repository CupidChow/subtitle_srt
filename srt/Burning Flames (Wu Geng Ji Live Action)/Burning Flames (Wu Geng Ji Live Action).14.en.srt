[Episode 14]

4
00:01:41,509 --> 00:01:43,030
Sir, are you okay?

5
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:43,910
If you feel unwell,

6
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:44,970
please let me know.

7
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,330
Push harder!

8
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:54,390
Come on.

9
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:56,360
Push harder!

10
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:59,220
This is right. Good.

11
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,120
Push harder!

12
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,860
Now you're doing it right.

13
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,360
Give me a hand.

14
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:10,380
Help with this.

15
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:12,750
Let's place it here.

16
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,250
The baby is born!

17
00:02:18,829 --> 00:02:21,030
The clan leader has given birth to a boy!

18
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:23,910
The clan leader has a baby now!

19
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,450
It's a boy!

20
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:31,120
Come on. Be careful.

21
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:09,630
Gou's left arm was injured by divine power.

22
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,750
Even the strongest

23
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,610
Immortality-Realm divine power

24
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:15,670
can't heal it.

25
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:17,610
Clan Leader,

26
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:19,270
you need a break.

27
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:29,510
Gou,

28
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,829
you've been badly injured. Don't move.

29
00:03:37,829 --> 00:03:39,030
I'll go find Shi Xing now.

30
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:41,290
Listen to the clan leader and stay still.

31
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,510
Look what you've become!

32
00:03:45,829 --> 00:03:48,360
Now you're even no match for Wu Dong and Wu Xia.

33
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:50,430
Just focus on your own recovery first.

34
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,120
Everything can wait till you get well.

35
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,110
Your body

36
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,270
is suffering from severe injuries

37
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:55,710
inflicted by the failed Divine Activation.

38
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:57,740
Although you have a remarkable ability to heal,

39
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:58,550
it still takes time

40
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:00,680
for you to restore the internal power.

41
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:03,120
There's no rush to go find Shi Xing.

42
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:04,750
I know him well.

43
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,230
He is violent,

44
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:08,430
but he's a man of his word.

45
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:17,149
The high priest

46
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:18,350
found this limestone cave

47
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:20,610
for Shenyin Clan as a temporary shelter.

48
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:24,370
How is everyone doing?

49
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:26,670
Are their injuries serious?

50
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:28,270
What about Wu Dong and Wu Xia?

51
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:30,030
Don't worry.

52
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,350
They are all fine.

53
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:33,870
It's true that they were all wounded,

54
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:35,400
but now they've settled in.

55
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:37,150
For the time being,

56
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:39,409
people can stay here to heal and recover.

57
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:41,470
You should take a good rest too.

58
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:42,390
Try not to move.

59
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:56,020
Our priority now

60
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:58,550
is to find a new place to reside,

61
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:01,510
and to quickly rebuild our village.

62
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,670
I don't want

63
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,270
to choose a new site.

64
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,070
We've relocated

65
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,510
numerous times,

66
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,150
and this place

67
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,040
is the most special of all.

68
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,070
It's not only

69
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:17,310
the result of the high priest's hard work,

70
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:18,990
but also Gou's current home.

71
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,310
Now I'm getting a deeper and deeper understanding

72
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:23,110
of why the high priest

73
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:24,310
would choose Gou.

74
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:28,620
From now on, I won't take people

75
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,140
to hide in different places anymore.

76
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:31,400
With Gou being around,

77
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:33,510
I'd like to go back to the original site

78
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:34,840
to rebuild our village,

79
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:37,360
and wait for the return of the high priest.

80
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:42,430
What is this?

81
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:44,250
I don't think it's edible.

82
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:45,950
Having food like this in such a situation

83
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:46,870
is already a blessing.

84
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:48,510
What gives you the right to be picky?

85
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:49,430
I'm not Bai Cai...

86
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:50,310
Stop it.

87
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:51,990
Listen up,

88
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:55,110
don't talk about Bai Cai in Gou's presence.

89
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,430
Now he can't

90
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:59,610
hear Bai Cai's name at all.

91
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,950
I pity Bai Cai.

92
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:03,210
She's such a nice girl.

93
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:04,840
It's a shame that she's caught by that crazy man.

94
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,890
To be frank,

95
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,230
I'm truly missing

96
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:09,990
Bai Cai's cooking.

97
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:12,950
Without Bai Cai,

98
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:15,300
there does seem to be a void.

99
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,150
Her arrival at the village

100
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:21,510
has brought us a special kind of vigor

101
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:22,910
that's totally new to

102
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:23,740
all of us.

103
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:26,210
She always wears a smile.

104
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,870
Even the villagers

105
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:30,350
have smiled a lot more under her influence.

106
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,750
She has an ability

107
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:35,090
to warm the heart

108
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:36,440
of everyone around her,

109
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:39,120
so much so that you'd genuinely like her.

110
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:41,470
But Shi Xing took her away.

111
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,610
Judging from her physical condition,

112
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:44,790
I'm afraid...

113
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:46,940
I wish her the best of luck.

114
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,820
I pray for her to get out of danger,

115
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,820
and to come back to Shenyin Village.

116
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:52,670
Right.

117
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,760
She's a clever girl.

118
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,210
I bet even Shi Xing can't make her surrender.

119
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:08,470
I'm going back.

120
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:09,590
It took me so much effort

121
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:11,450
to save you from the jaws of death.

122
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:13,040
How could you go back there?

123
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:17,230
You should've saved Gou,

124
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:18,350
not me!

125
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:20,200
Get out of my way!

126
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,190
It's Gou again!

127
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,659
It's a message from the clan leader and the guys.

128
00:07:42,659 --> 00:07:44,010
They've reached a new shelter.

129
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:45,409
They must be safe at the moment.

130
00:07:45,409 --> 00:07:47,620
That's a relief for you, isn't it?

131
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:32,390
Gou.

132
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:38,510
Master,

133
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:39,830
you're back.

134
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,680
You've been badly injured.

135
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:46,990
Instead of taking a rest,

136
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:48,320
what are you doing here?

137
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,590
The Immortal Clan has caused so much damage

138
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:52,720
to Shenyin Village,

139
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:54,470
and captured Bai Cai.

140
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:56,410
How am I supposed to sleep?

141
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:59,270
I'll continue with my cultivation.

142
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:00,730
I need to become stronger.

143
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:02,990
You haven't recovered from

144
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:04,720
the failed Divine Activation.

145
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:07,090
Even if you are to start cultivation,

146
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:08,910
you'll have to take small steps.

147
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:21,910
Gou, come sit here.

148
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:36,750
Master,

149
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:38,990
am I useless?

150
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:42,090
I always say I'd defeat Hei Long.

151
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:43,780
But now,

152
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:45,660
I can't even take down Shi Xing,

153
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,480
or protect the people around me.

154
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:51,670
Do you know

155
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:54,870
why the high priest would take you

156
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,180
to Shenyin Village,

157
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:58,940
and ask us to teach you how to cultivate?

158
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:03,750
Because

159
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,700
I have a talent for it.

160
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:07,670
Correct.

161
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:09,990
That aside,

162
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,800
there's a more important reason.

163
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:15,050
The high priest's Kongshi-Realm divine power

164
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:16,980
enables him to foresee the future.

165
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,060
The person he's seen in it

166
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:21,980
is you,

167
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:25,790
the son of Xin King, Wu Geng.

168
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:27,660
I...

169
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:36,100
Master, you knew from the beginning that...

170
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,280
That's right.

171
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,130
That is to say,

172
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,270
it's this particular reason that motivated

173
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:46,390
the old man to go to the Northern Mountain Mine

174
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:48,660
to find and help me.

175
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,050
Anyway,

176
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:05,510
I let him down in the end.

177
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:09,210
I even failed the Divine Activation.

178
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:12,750
One can make more than one attempt for the Divine Activation.

179
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,270
Don't you forget

180
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:16,790
that you once released Colorless-Realm divine power.

181
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:17,960
As I told you,

182
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,550
it's the strongest type of divine power in the three realms,

183
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:21,900
and it's exclusive to the King of Immortals,

184
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:22,950
namely Hei Long.

185
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:24,950
Wu Geng,

186
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:28,510
you've been proved to be an extraordinary cultivator.

187
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:30,610
The high priest's prophecy

188
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:32,090
used to seem dubious to me.

189
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:33,360
But now,

190
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,400
I have firm belief in it.

191
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:38,960
Therefore, Wu Geng,

192
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:41,030
you must pull yourself together.

193
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:41,840
Okay?

194
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:44,790
Master,

195
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:48,280
I've never heard you say so many words.

196
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:49,670
It's rare.

197
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,860
If you do understand what I mean,

198
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,660
you should go and take a rest now.

199
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:04,240
It's been a long time

200
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,390
since someone called me Wu Geng.

201
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:08,550
Thank you, Master.

202
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,240
I assure you

203
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:15,340
that Shi Xing

204
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:17,510
will be the first immortal

205
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:20,970
I take down on my way to overthrow the Immortal Clan.

206
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:38,590
Our hideout was discovered.

207
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:42,140
We were besieged by the six tribes of the Immortal Realm.

208
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:43,780
Many of our people were gone.

209
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,660
We lost our homes overnight.

210
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,380
I know everyone of you

211
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:49,310
is upset now.

212
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:51,310
Luckily,

213
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:53,180
our children are fine.

214
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,520
We can rebuild Shenyin Village,

215
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:59,430
but we must not lose another member of ours.

216
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:02,730
The bad news is,

217
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:05,100
even the high priest was captured.

218
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,120
The old man...

219
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,310
All the six tribes of the Immortal Realm took part in this operation.

220
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:13,310
I'm afraid now the high priest is...

221
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,840
Xinyue Kui must have gone out of her mind!

222
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,480
She even hurt

223
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:19,630
her own father!

224
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,160
The old man was taken away.

225
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,770
Why did no one tell me that?

226
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:28,180
It's a serious issue.

227
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:29,990
Why did no one tell me that?

228
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:35,910
Clan Leader,

229
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:37,640
let me explain it to Gou.

230
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:51,630
Clan Leader,

231
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:53,790
I fixed it.

232
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:58,430
We can repair

233
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,810
anything our enemy has ripped apart.

234
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:02,610
As long as we don't give up,

235
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:05,320
everything will be fine again.

236
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,950
Thank you, Gou.

237
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:24,240
Didn't I tell you to go and take a rest?

238
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,840
Why would you come out again?

239
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:26,790
Master.

240
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:32,110
that old man is Xinyue Kui's father.

241
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,860
Does it mean he's my grandfather?

242
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:50,540
Do you remember the test

243
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,590
that the high priest gave you

244
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:55,320
when you met him for the first time in the mine?

245
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:59,270
What I need you to do

246
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:01,350
is stay here,

247
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,780
and do your job well as a slave.

248
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:05,910
He asked me

249
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,280
to do my job well as a slave.

250
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,910
We kept your relationship with him secret

251
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:15,110
because we wanted to protect you.

252
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,560
On the other hand,

253
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:19,450
the high priest meant for it as a test for you.

254
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:23,470
If in the beginning,

255
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:24,850
we had disclosed your real identity

256
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:26,580
as the high priest's grandson,

257
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:28,350
everyone in Shenyin Village

258
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:30,350
would've treated you differently.

259
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:33,430
You would've taken things for granted

260
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:35,890
since you knew your privileged status here.

261
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:39,310
You would've resumed your bad temper and arrogance

262
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:41,080
you had when you were a prince.

263
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:45,580
The high priest said

264
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:49,070
you had to see yourself as an ordinary man,

265
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,190
so you could be constantly challenged,

266
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:53,090
rejected,

267
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:55,070
or even put through difficult times,

268
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:57,030
and so you could toughen yourself up,

269
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:59,270
and gain more courage as you encountered setbacks.

270
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:00,670
That's the kind of Wu Geng

271
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:04,710
that the high priest expected to see.

272
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:09,310
Grandfather went to extraordinary lengths

273
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:11,730
to help me become a better person,

274
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:13,900
but I didn't even get a chance

275
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,110
to call him Grandpa.

276
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,790
Now he's in danger.

277
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:25,800
I must help my grandfather out.

278
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,510
Xinyue Kui has taken the high priest

279
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:29,770
to the Immortal Realm,

280
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,550
where there are countless invincible fighters.

281
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:33,630
Besides those who you've seen,

282
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:35,710
namely the major immortals from the six tribes of the Immortal Realm,

283
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:37,050
there's also the Sage Hall

284
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:38,430
guarded by the Great Sage

285
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:40,150
who has even more powerful magic.

286
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:41,750
I don't think you and I are now

287
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:44,790
able to fight against the Immortal Realm.

288
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:46,030
I know.

289
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:49,030
Now isn't the best time

290
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:51,490
to attack the Immortal Realm.

291
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:54,310
Only when I become stronger

292
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:56,610
can I save my grandfather.

293
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:00,030
Wu Geng,

294
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:03,870
you've become a lot more mature in these days.

295
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:07,109
The high priest was right.

296
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:09,990
From now on,

297
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:12,650
you don't need to call me Master anymore.

298
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:15,430
Just call me Lan.

299
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:22,430
Okay.

300
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:24,829
Lan.

301
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:37,360
The most important thing now

302
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:39,690
is to rescue Bai Cai from the King's City.

303
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:40,950
If Uncle Ziyu

304
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:42,550
is really in the King's City,

305
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,550
he'll definitely help us.

306
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:47,790
Then, when we reach the Immortal Realm,

307
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:50,530
we'll also stand a higher chance of winning.

308
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:11,560
Alright. Quiet down!

309
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:15,730
In my opinion, this matter isn't that complicated.

310
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:16,870
We should set out now

311
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:17,950
while Hei Long is asleep,

312
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:18,910
and head to the Immortal Realm

313
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:19,830
to save the high priest.

314
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:21,130
It's simplicity itself, isn't it?

315
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:23,310
-Yeah!
-That's right!

316
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,550
If we were truly strong enough

317
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:25,790
to fight the Immortal Realm,

318
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:26,470
we wouldn't be

319
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:28,230
reduced to this situation

320
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:29,970
by those six tribes of theirs.

321
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,030
Right?

322
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:32,440
That's not true, is it?

323
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,070
Our fists

324
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,150
aren't half bad!

325
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:35,280
That's right!

326
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:36,550
You're just afraid of death.

327
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:39,410
We'll rescue the high priest on our own without you!

328
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:45,950
Everybody, calm down.

329
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,550
Before Xinyue Kui attacked Shenyin Village,

330
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:49,410
the high priest

331
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:52,270
had given me a lamp with the Dragon Whale Incense.

332
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:54,150
I guess he must have predicted

333
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:55,070
this disaster.

334
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:56,310
Let's hear

335
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:57,930
the message he left us.

336
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,230
-Okay.
-I agree!
-Okay!

337
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:01,960
Let's hear what he said.

338
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:26,790
If one day, misfortunes befall me...

339
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:30,310
If one day, misfortunes befall me...

340
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:31,750
You must prioritize

341
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:34,190
the preservation of qualified combatants.

342
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:35,350
You must prioritize

343
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:38,050
the preservation of qualified combatants.

344
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:39,470
Do not try to save my life.

345
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,880
Make sure Wu Geng is well protected.

346
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:44,070
Do not try to save my life.

347
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,510
Make sure Gou is well protected.

348
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:52,740
If necessary,

349
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:54,570
kill Bai Cai.

350
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:07,350
What else did the high priest say?

351
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:11,760
The high priest also told us

352
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:13,830
not to worry about his safety.

353
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:16,630
Rebuilding Shenyin Village is the most pressing task here.

354
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:17,430
Also,

355
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:22,150
we must protect Gou.

356
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:24,990
Protect him?

357
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:27,360
Look at the situation we're in!

358
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,270
How are we supposed to make an effort

359
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:30,000
to protect this worthless bum?

360
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,020
Plus,

361
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,100
why is it our duty to protect him?

362
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,350
He doesn't deserve it!

363
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:35,350
Besides protecting him,

364
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:36,030
didn't the high priest

365
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:37,070
give us other instructions?

366
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,470
The high priest also said

367
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:40,300
if you had learned to respect people,

368
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,230
you wouldn't have ended up

369
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:42,350
a total loser every time.

370
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:42,750
You...

371
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:43,390
Fine.

372
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:46,230
Since the decision was made by the high priest,

373
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:48,230
I believe he had good reasons for it.

374
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,830
Now the urgent priority here

375
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:51,950
is to rebuild our village as soon as possible,

376
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:54,550
and shelter ourselves from the Immortal Clan.

377
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:56,910
The high priest left a formation

378
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:59,270
to help us reconstruct the village safely.

379
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:01,130
Do you know about that formation?

380
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:03,110
Lan?

381
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:05,710
Lan!

382
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:08,950
Yes.

383
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:12,320
I'll take some people with me to that place later.

384
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:24,790
The high priest has always been kind and loving.

385
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:26,920
Why would he be so merciless to Bai Cai?

386
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:28,110
Has something happened

387
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:29,870
during Bai Cai's stay

388
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:31,790
in Shenyin Village?

389
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:37,510
Lan.

390
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:40,390
Lan?

391
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:43,480
What's the matter with you?

392
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:44,630
Since you finished

393
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:45,910
reading that message,

394
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:48,150
you have seemed to be disturbed.

395
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:52,710
I'm just worried about the high priest.

396
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,670
Lan,

397
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:57,310
I've done some

398
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:58,400
serious thinking.

399
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:00,610
My grandfather and Bai Cai

400
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:02,000
are very important to me

401
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,550
in this world.

402
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:05,030
So, no matter what,

403
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:06,350
I must go save them.

404
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:08,460
The Immortal Realm is far away.

405
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:10,030
Based on what you're capable of now,

406
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:11,350
before you get to the Immortal Realm,

407
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:12,670
you will die on the halfway.

408
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:13,480
I know.

409
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:15,110
To fight the Immortal Realm,

410
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:17,470
there should be a carefully considered plan.

411
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:19,230
Given that, I'll go find Shi Xing

412
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:19,990
in the King's City first.

413
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:21,510
You're no match for Shi Xing.

414
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:22,750
How could you throw your life away like that?

415
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:23,230
How can we be so sure

416
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:25,760
that it'll be a failure before giving it a try?

417
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:28,350
Actually, I'm going to the King's City

418
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:29,790
for two main reasons.

419
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:30,910
Bai Cai was captured

420
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:31,910
because of me.

421
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:34,160
Before that, there had been several times

422
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,210
when Bai Cai nearly lost her life

423
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:36,700
because of me.

424
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:38,710
So I can't leave her in the lurch.

425
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,730
The other reason is

426
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:42,990
that during the battle in Xin capital,

427
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:43,950
my uncle Ziyu,

428
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,830
who's the best sword user in the human race,

429
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:48,560
was also taken away by Shi Xing.

430
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,470
So I think I can find

431
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:52,830
Uncle Ziyu's trails in the King's City.

432
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:56,870
If it's true that Ziyu was captured by Shi Xing,

433
00:22:57,190 --> 00:23:00,250
it's very likely that he's still in the King's City now.

434
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:03,270
But now you haven't made a full recovery

435
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:05,030
from the failed Divine Activation yet.

436
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:06,670
After you succeed in the Divine Activation,

437
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:07,670
when you're up against Shi Xing,

438
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:09,130
perhaps you'll stand some chances of winning.

439
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:10,630
The previous attempt I made

440
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:11,630
for the Divine Activation happened

441
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:13,270
during a fight against Shi Xing.

442
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:15,550
So, if I am to make another attempt,

443
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:17,030
fighting Shi Xin again is the best option.

444
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:17,470
But...

445
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:19,350
Where there's a will, there's a way.

446
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:21,190
Lan, trust me.

447
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:22,470
If I don't even

448
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:24,400
have the courage to fight Shi Xing,

449
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:26,440
how am I supposed to fight Hei Long?

450
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:29,950
It's settled.

451
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:56,070
Clan Leader,

452
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:57,590
there's something

453
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,070
I need to ask your opinion about.

454
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:02,360
I know what it is without you saying it.

455
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:05,280
You're worried about Wu Geng, aren't you?

456
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:08,190
In fact, I can tell

457
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:10,190
that you're not just treating

458
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:12,190
Wu Geng as your apprentice.

459
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:15,950
Why would you say that, Clan Leader?

460
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:18,520
Since Wu Geng came to Shenyin Village,

461
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:20,190
we've all clearly seen

462
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:21,870
how you treat him.

463
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:24,590
Whether it's the Dragon Whale Incense,

464
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:25,950
or even your life,

465
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:27,790
you would give Wu Geng

466
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:29,110
whatever he wants.

467
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,300
That's because

468
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:33,930
the high priest said

469
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:35,400
Wu Geng was the most likely one

470
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,790
to kill Hei Long.

471
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,830
It's this assertion that makes me look differently at him.

472
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:40,910
I'm just...

473
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:44,000
Just...

474
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:45,640
You're such a bad liar.

475
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:48,950
It's no wonder that you can't even deceive Zi Dian.

476
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:50,150
Even Zi Dian can tell

477
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:52,480
what kind of feelings you have for Wu Geng.

478
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:55,710
Why would you try to lie to everyone, including yourself?

479
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,160
I don't mean any harm, Lan.

480
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:00,640
I only want to give you a kind reminder.

481
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:02,070
Things won't work out

482
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:03,710
for you and Wu Geng.

483
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:05,150
Once a human and an immortal

484
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:06,590
fall in love with each other,

485
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:08,320
disasters are bound to happen.

486
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:10,430
In the past, Xinyue Hu and Shi Xing

487
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:11,790
were a good example.

488
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:14,420
I'd hate to see you invite trouble to yourself.

489
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:15,950
More importantly,

490
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:17,810
Wu Geng is in love with Bai Cai now.

491
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:21,230
I know you're very worried about Wu Geng.

492
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:22,510
The failed Divine Activation

493
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:24,370
has brought him severe injuries.

494
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:26,210
But now I'm more worried about you.

495
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:29,410
Your concerns about him have compromised your judgment.

496
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:39,450
Wu Geng insists on going to the King's City.

497
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:41,230
It's such a dangerous place.

498
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:42,990
What he's capable of now

499
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,610
isn't enough to help him survive.

500
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:57,270
Since Wu Geng

501
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:58,780
is determined to fight against the Immortal Realm,

502
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:00,670
all the experiences he's having now

503
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:02,070
are what he can't avoid.

504
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:05,430
Though the high priest has told us to protect him,

505
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:06,430
I bet he would

506
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:07,630
prefer to see

507
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:09,890
how we keep Wu Geng company as he grows up,

508
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:11,710
rather than how we help him

509
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:12,750
get around the obstacles and hardships

510
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:14,680
on his journey to become stronger.

511
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:19,190
Let destiny decide for us.

512
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:20,590
Isn't it what you

513
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:21,830
always say?

514
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:24,310
How come you've forgotten it

515
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:26,170
since you met Wu Geng?

516
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:32,510
Lan, you're obviously tense.

517
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:37,840
Wu Geng

518
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:40,090
is just my apprentice.

519
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,960
That's all.

520
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:05,020
Wu Geng.

521
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:08,870
Don't try to persuade me.

522
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:10,430
I've made up my mind.

523
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:14,360
I'll go with you to the King's City.

524
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:21,970
Why would you suddenly...

525
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:24,770
I thought you'd be firmly against this idea.

526
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:28,090
I've promised the high priest

527
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:29,270
to keep you safe.

528
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,390
Thank you, Lan.

529
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:46,730
[King's City]

530
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:08,710
Who is it?

531
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,130
Knock it off!

532
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:12,200
Show up and confront me, I dare you!

533
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:15,190
All of these are my preys.

534
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:30,680
Big guy,

535
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:32,960
are you also tied up?

536
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,890
Let's make a trade.

537
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:37,950
You'll help me out of here,

538
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:39,010
and I'll untie you.

539
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,970
If I don't tie myself up,

540
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:03,270
I might do something terrible

541
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:04,740
after I fall asleep.

542
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:11,020
Fine!

543
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:13,110
You go to sleep. I won't blame you for not knowing anything.

544
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:14,310
I'm leaving then.

545
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:25,950
If you want to stay alive

546
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:27,480
till Gou arrives,

547
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:30,030
you'd better not wander around,

548
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:32,330
especially at night.

549
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:49,090
It's a large place.

550
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:51,160
Why isn't there a person at all?

551
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:53,400
It seems like no one's living here.

552
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:21,150
Do you know how to

553
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:22,280
get out of this city?

554
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:47,550
Now I understand why that big guy

555
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:48,880
wouldn't try to stop me.

556
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:50,190
He knows

557
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:52,820
there's no way I can leave this city.

558
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:56,500
Gou, I miss you so much.

559
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:57,950
Where are you?

560
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,620
Let's stop here.

561
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:15,030
Gou,

562
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:16,400
Lan,

563
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,760
it'll be a dangerous journey.

564
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:19,870
Don't forget

565
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:21,270
to keep yourselves safe.

566
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:23,190
You must not

567
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:24,920
go head-to-head with Shi Xing.

568
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:25,950
You got it?

569
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:28,050
Don't worry, Clan Leader.

570
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:30,390
Last time when I fought Shi Xing,

571
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:31,960
he didn't manage to kill me.

572
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:33,630
I won't give him a second chance

573
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:34,790
to take my life.

574
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:36,150
Good.

575
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:38,960
Brat,

576
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:41,830
it has never occurred to me

577
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:43,780
that you're actually so gutsy.

578
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:45,610
Today,

579
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:47,350
I'm impressed.

580
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:50,870
You take care too.

581
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:53,530
You've gotta rebuild the village

582
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:56,240
with the clan leader and the other villagers.

583
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:01,150
Take this.

584
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:04,270
You treasure this gourd.

585
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:06,600
Are you sure you wanna give it to me?

586
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:08,000
Did I say it'd be yours forever?

587
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,260
You'll return it to me when you come back.

588
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:12,310
Cheapskate!

589
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:14,680
It's a helpful tool.

590
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:17,100
Soon you'll understand what I mean.

591
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:19,880
Thanks.

592
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:24,920
Enough!

593
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:27,150
No need for all this.

594
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,870
I'm just worried that if you die,

595
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:30,730
no one will drink with me anymore.

596
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:33,530
Gou,

597
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:36,550
Shi Xing is a brutal savage.

598
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:39,090
He'd do anything it takes to win a fight.

599
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:41,030
You must be very cautious.

600
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:44,240
Don't compete with him on physical strength.

601
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:46,910
But if you do that,

602
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:49,350
perhaps the potential in you

603
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:50,470
will be unleashed.

604
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:02,740
Brat,

605
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:04,510
I'm warning you,

606
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,860
if you dare to let Lan get hurt,

607
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:08,739
I'll make you pay a steep price.

608
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:19,590
Don't take it the wrong way.

609
00:34:19,989 --> 00:34:21,949
I don't mean for this thing to help you.

610
00:34:21,949 --> 00:34:23,389
I just want you to protect Lan with it

611
00:34:23,389 --> 00:34:24,590
when there are emergencies.

612
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:25,650
Do you understand?

613
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:29,070
Zi Dian,

614
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:31,270
thank you.

615
00:34:32,469 --> 00:34:33,270
Lan,

616
00:34:33,389 --> 00:34:34,550
if I weren't needed for

617
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:35,469
the village's reconstruction,

618
00:34:35,469 --> 00:34:37,000
I'd definitely go with you.

619
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:39,840
Protect the villagers.

620
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:41,110
No problem.

621
00:34:41,389 --> 00:34:43,320
I look forward to your safe return.

622
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:52,060
Let's go.

623
00:34:55,739 --> 00:34:56,870
Have a safe trip!

624
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:58,310
Lan, we await your safe return!

625
00:34:58,310 --> 00:34:59,310
-Take care!
-We wish you a safe journey!

626
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:00,950
Promise us you'll come back alive!

627
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:02,110
You've gotta come back safe and sound!

628
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:03,310
Take care!

629
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:04,570
Keep yourselves safe!

630
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,310
Big guy!

631
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:35,830
What kind of hellhole is this?

632
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:37,350
There were loud noises last night.

633
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:38,950
I couldn't sleep at all!

634
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:17,510
I'm hungry!

635
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:19,570
I'm saying that I'm hungry!

636
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:21,560
I need to eat!

637
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:29,260
You... He...

638
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:34,920
That cook

639
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:37,390
slept beside you last night.

640
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,910
Because he wandered about

641
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:41,340
against the rules,

642
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:42,750
he was...

643
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:43,680
I'm telling you,

644
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,050
don't try to bluff me!

645
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:46,710
Should anything happen to me,

646
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:48,270
Gou will hunt you down!

647
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:49,230
Listen up,

648
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:50,470
Gou and I have once

649
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:51,630
conquered a huge white tiger

650
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:52,670
with bare hands.

651
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,830
That tiger was triple your size!

652
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:55,710
Plus,

653
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:57,230
all those in the mine are my friends.

654
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:58,150
One simple request of mine

655
00:36:58,150 --> 00:36:59,310
will be enough to flatten

656
00:36:59,310 --> 00:36:59,990
this stupid place of yours.

657
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:00,990
Say one more word,

658
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:02,650
and I'll eat you alive.

659
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:06,230
Go and cook!

660
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:07,790
From now on,

661
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:09,680
you'll cook for all of them.

662
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:12,050
Not only will you keep them alive,

663
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,010
you'll also need to figure out ways

664
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:16,150
to make them stronger.

665
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:17,370
That can

666
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:20,090
guarantee me

667
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,300
a wonderful night of battles.

668
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:38,990
That chubby mister lied to me

669
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:40,870
and said this would be a nice tool.

670
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,030
As it turns out, he only left

671
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:43,760
a little amount of water for us.

672
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:53,890
We'll have to ration it.

673
00:37:56,430 --> 00:37:58,150
Come on. Shake it a bit.

674
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,810
It's filled with water now?

675
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,150
Yes.

676
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:13,470
With this gourd,

677
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:15,150
we won't suffer from thirst.

678
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:19,620
Yun Zhong Zi is quite interesting.

679
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,410
When we go back,

680
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:23,920
I'm gonna have a drinking party with him.

681
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:34,390
Don't worry.

682
00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:36,030
My arm was just burned,

683
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:37,230
and is numb now.

684
00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:39,850
I can't use the Fire of Chaos. No big deal.

685
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:44,070
By the way,

686
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:46,790
where is the King's City?

687
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:51,870
It's in the deepest part of the desert,

688
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:53,830
Ordinary humans

689
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:55,230
can't reach there.

690
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:56,510
Besides,

691
00:38:57,580 --> 00:39:00,320
the exact location of it remains a mystery.

692
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:04,430
Sounds true.

693
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,190
Even Mr. Yuan Yi doesn't know

694
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:09,320
the exact location of the King's City.

695
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:11,880
What we need to do now

696
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:12,840
is find some clues

697
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,770
that can lead us to the King's City.

698
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,830
Are you worrying about Bai Cai?

699
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:23,640
Shi Xing is a violent predator.

700
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,350
I hope he won't give Bai Cai a hard time.

701
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:27,430
Rest assured.

702
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,510
Though Shi Xing is a crazy guy,

703
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:31,170
he always keeps his promises.

704
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:32,670
Before we arrive,

705
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:34,110
Bai Cai won't be killed.

706
00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:35,280
In fact,

707
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:37,810
you should worry about yourself.

708
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:41,910
Last time,

709
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:44,220
I survived a fight against Shi Xing.

710
00:39:44,350 --> 00:39:46,410
It means I'm fated to live a long life.

711
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,220
You're quite confident, aren't you?

712
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,110
Shi Xing will be

713
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:53,790
the first enemy I take down

714
00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:55,550
on my way to defeat Hei Long.

715
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:57,550
Okay.

716
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:01,860
I hate Shi Xing!

717
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:04,540
How could he let me deliver food to these guy?

718
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:05,730
I wonder

719
00:40:06,090 --> 00:40:08,220
what kind of monsters are kept inside.

720
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:49,330
It's time to eat!

721
00:41:03,350 --> 00:41:04,870
No! No!

722
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,250
No!

723
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,090
Thank goodness.

724
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:24,040
Not every prisoner here is a monster.

725
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:26,420
It's time to eat!

726
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:29,350
What?

727
00:41:29,390 --> 00:41:30,510
Don't you find the buns I make

728
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:31,470
tasty?

729
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:33,150
You can try some.

730
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:33,710
People say

731
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:35,170
the buns I make taste good.

732
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:41,230
How did you get caught?

733
00:41:41,310 --> 00:41:42,590
Where are you from?
