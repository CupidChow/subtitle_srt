00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:54,130
From now on,

195
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:55,830
you must line up for food.

196
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:57,110
Everyone can only

197
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:58,310
take their own share.

198
00:11:58,390 --> 00:11:59,270
If I find out

199
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:01,000
that someone took another person's share,

200
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,030
then they must give me

201
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:03,270
twice the bloodstone amount.

202
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:05,310
If they can't, they will be punished severely.

203
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:06,390
Understand?

204
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,990
Yes.

205
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:11,520
Put them back first.

206
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:13,150
Bring the food back.

207
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,510
Bring them back!

208
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,430
If you took extra shares, bring them all back.

209
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:17,110
Bring them all back!

210
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:18,570
Hurry up.

211
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:20,310
Line up first.

212
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:23,830
Let the elderly, sickly, women, and children get food first.

213
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:24,790
Line up.

214
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:25,870
Come on. Line up.

215
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:27,790
Line up.

216
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,110
Everyone, line up.

217
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:31,420
Don't push.

218
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:33,460
Let's start.

219
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:34,910
Here's yours.

220
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:35,670
Thank you.

221
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:36,320
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

222
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:36,790
Take it and leave.

223
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:37,910
Let the elderly, sickly, women, and children line up first.

224
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:38,870
Next. Here you go.

225
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:39,590
Thank you.

226
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:40,990
Thank you.

227
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:42,310
Here you are.

228
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:43,150
Thank you.

229
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:44,310
Thank you.

230
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:46,860
Thank you.

231
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:47,670
Take it.

232
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:48,390
Thank you.

233
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,760
This is yours.

234
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:52,270
Thank you.

235
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:52,950
Yours.

236
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:53,710
Thank you.

237
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:54,510
Thank you.

238
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:55,710
Here.

239
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:57,510
Thank you.

240
00:12:58,550 --> 00:12:59,350
Thank you.

241
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:00,790
Gou is really something.

242
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:01,950
Gou being the centurion

243
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:03,230
is a blessing for everyone.

244
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:04,040
Yes.

245
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:05,570
Everyone, line up.

246
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:06,710
Line up.

247
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:07,830
Don't worry.

248
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:09,470
Everyone has a share.

249
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:26,480
Why are you looking at me like that?

250
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:29,270
I think how you are now is great too.

251
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:37,950
Centurion.

252
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:44,710
This is food

253
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,520
we specially prepared for you.

254
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:59,230
Thank you for your good intentions.

255
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:00,830
Just leave the meat here.

256
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:02,230
Take the rest back.

257
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:06,730
Thank you, Centurion.

258
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:16,070
Here.

259
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:18,830
For me?

260
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:20,510
Don't you want it?

261
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:22,350
Won't you eat?

262
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:24,750
No.

263
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:26,100
I promised everyone

264
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,670
to share weal and woe together.

265
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:28,710
If I eat it,

266
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,350
I would be like Cai.

267
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:40,110
If you won't eat, I won't eat either.

268
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:40,910
I don't want to be

269
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:42,510
the person holding you back.

270
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:51,470
Sirs,

271
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,120
this is from the centurion.

272
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:55,830
Take it.

273
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:07,750
Be careful.

274
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:09,310
It hurts so much.

275
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:10,510
Why is he so badly injured?

276
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:11,350
He was beaten

277
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:12,310
by that Bigfoot Monster.

278
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:13,310
Bigfoot Monster?

279
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:14,790
Isn't he locked up in the dungeon?

280
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:15,510
Tell us.

281
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:16,960
It's an old habit.

282
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,690
These guards

283
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:18,980
send whatever slave they don't like

284
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,510
into the arena as prey.

285
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:21,180
Watching the slaves

286
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,240
get beaten up

287
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,190
is entertainment for them.

288
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:23,830
They even

289
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:25,270
starve that monster for a few days.

290
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:26,400
Come, give me a hand.

291
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:29,320
They've gone too far.

292
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:31,210
Bai Cai,

293
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:32,590
quickly check on his wound.

294
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:33,830
I'll go check on the situation.

295
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:34,470
Okay.

296
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:38,500
Bastard, get up.

297
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:46,440
You bastard!

298
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,890
Pull yourself together!

299
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:49,670
Go inside and continue.

300
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,540
I'll reward you with meat later.

301
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,850
Get up.

302
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,300
Get up! Go!

303
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:55,750
Get up! Go!

304
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:02,040
Go!

305
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:07,030
Beat him!

306
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:08,400
Beat him!

307
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:16,720
Kill him!

308
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:32,660
Bigfoot Monster!

309
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:35,380
Hit him! Hit him hard!

310
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:36,430
Get up!

311
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:42,650
Why are you not moving?

312
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:44,190
Don't you want to eat?

313
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:45,040
Continue.

314
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,060
Bigfoot Monster,

315
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,670
have you forgotten

316
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:49,030
what I told you before?

317
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,770
Actually, we are all the same.

318
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:54,640
We all live oppressed

319
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:56,270
and enslaved lives,

320
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:58,920
but whether it's your life,

321
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:00,110
my life,

322
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:02,150
or anyone's life here,

323
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:04,270
we should not be trampled on.

324
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:08,530
I was wondering who it was.

325
00:17:09,109 --> 00:17:10,910
Turns out it's our new centurion,

326
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:11,910
Gou.

327
00:17:13,869 --> 00:17:15,130
Why are you doing this?

328
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:16,319
What do you know?

329
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:18,030
We do this

330
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:19,950
to preserve the beastly nature

331
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:21,030
of this monster.

332
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:23,310
Otherwise, without its beastly nature,

333
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:25,109
how can it serve Mr. Chen Jing?

334
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:28,310
They are humans,

335
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:29,300
not prey.

336
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:31,550
You made Bigfoot Monster

337
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,910
hurt so many slaves,

338
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:35,390
holding them up from digging bloodstones.

339
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:37,150
If Mr. Chen Jing blames us,

340
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:39,050
can you bear the responsibility?

341
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:01,150
Fine. Just you wait.

342
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,300
Go!

343
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:02,350
Bigfoot Monster.

344
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:32,910
Bigfoot Monster,

345
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:36,030
don't hurt others for food

346
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:37,260
anymore.

347
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:38,670
This way,

348
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:40,870
you won't be taken advantage of.

349
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:53,100
Centurion.

350
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:54,030
Centurion.

351
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:56,070
Centurion.

352
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:57,590
Centurion.

353
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:17,170
Here, this basket of bloodstones is for you.

354
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:19,220
Centurion, this can't do.

355
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:20,280
It's okay.

356
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:21,630
You're sick.

357
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:22,890
Have a good rest.

358
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:24,710
Work after you're done resting.

359
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:25,980
Thank you, Centurion.

360
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,860
Thank you, Centurion.

361
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:31,650
What's going on?

362
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:34,470
Come on.

363
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:35,480
Everyone, come here.

364
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,430
Come on.

365
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:39,610
I have something to announce.

366
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:41,150
From today onwards,

367
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:43,350
every four people will be put into a team.

368
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:45,550
As long as each team fills four baskets,

369
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:47,340
everyone can rest early,

370
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:49,270
even if the bell hasn't rung yet.

371
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:50,910
Great, we can rest now.

372
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:55,270
We don't actually have

373
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:56,910
many elderly, sickly, women, and children here,

374
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:58,220
so each team

375
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,150
will have three strong workers

376
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:01,470
and one weak worker.

377
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:02,350
This way,

378
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:03,550
everyone can finish

379
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:04,550
and rest early.

380
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:11,310
You are truly a lifesaver.

381
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:13,570
Please get up.

382
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:18,070
Please get up.

383
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:28,110
These stone walls

384
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:29,390
all look similar,

385
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:30,580
but when you shine a torch on them,

386
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,350
you will find

387
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:32,830
that the color is different.

388
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:33,630
It will look

389
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:34,790
semi-transparent.

390
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:35,540
Look.

391
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:37,070
These spots

392
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:38,400
will have bloodstones.

393
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:40,710
Really, Bai Cai?

394
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:41,790
You don't believe it?

395
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:42,570
You don't believe me?

396
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:43,570
Then try digging.

397
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:53,780
Look.

398
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:54,530
Look!

399
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:55,820
There really are bloodstones.

400
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:56,970
Look.

401
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:58,260
Continue.

402
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:00,260
Hurry and dig.

403
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:06,630
Look.

404
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:08,950
There really are bloodstones.

405
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:10,030
Not bad, Bai Cai.

406
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:10,950
Bai Cai is amazing.

407
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:12,150
So many bloodstones.

408
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,910
I didn't expect Chen Jing's qi cultivation

409
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:49,950
to be so powerful.

410
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:50,950
Why is he still willing to be

411
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:52,480
the Immortal Clan's lackey

412
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:53,270
and guard

413
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:54,830
this dark mine?

414
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:14,330
Remember,

415
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:16,420
next time you see me practicing,

416
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:18,300
you must stay away.

417
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:19,260
Understand?

418
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:21,190
Yes.

419
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:26,680
What's the matter?

420
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:29,470
Mr. Chen,

421
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:31,060
I discovered that many tools

422
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:31,830
in the mine

423
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:33,350
haven't been repaired in years.

424
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:34,110
It has seriously affected

425
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:35,150
the efficiency of

426
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:36,470
our bloodstone mining.

427
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:37,680
I've counted the amount

428
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,750
of loss.

429
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,060
You can have a look.

430
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:56,230
You are very thoughtful.

431
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:00,070
All I care about is the mine.

432
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:01,690
I just want to improve

433
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,230
the bloodstone production.

434
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:04,640
Us workers below you

435
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:05,710
can only live well

436
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:06,910
if you can

437
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:08,510
perform well

438
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:09,480
before the Immortal Clan,

439
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,230
right?

440
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:16,270
These days,

441
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,410
the production of bloodstones

442
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:21,190
have indeed increased from before.

443
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:22,240
You did a good job.

444
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:24,430
It's my duty.

445
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:28,570
Someone will bring the things

446
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:30,060
to the mine in a few days.

447
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:32,390
Thank you, Mr. Chen.

448
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:32,950
Zhazha.

449
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:33,810
Father.

450
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:35,430
My good son.

451
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:36,020
My good son.

452
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,030
You promised me yesterday

453
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:38,510
to go hunting with me in the back mountain.

454
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:39,390
Did I?

455
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:42,190
Father, I don't care.

456
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:42,580
I don't care.

457
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:43,790
Okay, my dear.

458
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:44,270
I want you to go hunting with me.

459
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:45,030
Okay.

460
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:45,750
Let's go.

461
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:46,750
I'll go with you.

462
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:56,790
Be careful.

463
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:57,740
I'm fine.

464
00:24:58,350 --> 00:24:59,470
Thank you.

465
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:00,510
No need.

466
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:01,630
Here.

467
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:02,430

I will rescue

511
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:39,160
everyone from here.

512
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:42,070
I met a girl.

513
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:43,960
She's smart and kind.

514
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:45,470
She not only taught me

515
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:46,950
many survival skills,

516
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:48,830
but I also learned

517
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:51,270
resilience and compassion from her.

518
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:53,550
Now,

519
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:54,790
I'm Gou

520
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:57,470
and also Prince Wu Geng of Xin State.

521
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:00,870
I seem to have found my own path.

522
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:05,390
Father, Mother,

523
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:07,190
do you see this?

524
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:26,030
Bai Cai.

525
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:37,190
Come.

526
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:47,630
How is it? Does it work?

527
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:06,430
Thank you.

528
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:07,710
I feel much better.

529
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:08,470
Bai Cai,

530
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:10,070
you're sick again.

531
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:36,710
Do you feel better?

532
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:42,750
You finally remember.

533
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:45,070
When I was sick before,

534
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:47,590
this was how you helped treat me.

535
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:55,910
I will never forget it again.

536
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:17,020
[Four years later]

537
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:05,070
Godfather, we've arrived at the Northern Mountain Mine.

538
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:54,310
Welcome, Immortal Gui Mu.

539
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:04,990
Welcome, Immortal. Please forgive me

540
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:06,790
for not welcoming you formally.

541
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:08,510
Rise.

542
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:10,830
Thank you, Immortal.

543
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:14,360
Chen Jing,

544
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:16,670
what wrongdoings do you have?

545
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:19,190
All these years,

546
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:20,750
the bloodstone production

547
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:23,550
of the Northern Mountain Mine has risen steadily.

548
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:25,910
Congratulations.

549
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:28,360
The High Priest specially sent me

550
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:30,110
to visit you.

551
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:32,560
I heard that

552
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:35,070
you were injured when killing the Xin King.

553
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:39,140
Now, I see you are safe

554
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:40,900
and even more magnanimous.

555
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:43,350
It's really pleasant to see.

556
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:46,970
Chen Jing,

557
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:49,720
are you mocking me?

558
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:51,790
I dare not.

559
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,720
I was lucky to witness

560
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:55,470
the unique skills of all Immortals.

561
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:56,710
It's unforgettable.

562
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:58,500
All of your teachings

563
00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:00,120
are still fresh in my memory.

564
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,310
I don't dare to slack off

565
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:02,970
on the mining of bloodstones.

566
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:08,310
You are merely the king of the subjugated Wanqu State.

567
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:12,220
The High Priest let you

568
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:15,170
manage the mine because he pitied you.

569
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:19,570
It's your duty

570
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:24,670
to be grateful to the Immortal Clan.

571
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:28,210
Yes, Immortal Gui Mu.

572
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,840
It is my duty.

573
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:34,110
It's my duty.

574
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:41,560
That's right.

575
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:43,130
Qiao.

576
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:44,670
Godfather.

577
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:49,310
This is Zhou Qiao, the prince of Bai State.

578
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:51,970
To help me recover my divine spirit,

579
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:53,920
he specially selected

580
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:56,230
suitable boys and girls

581
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:57,720
for me to feed on,

582
00:32:58,430 --> 00:33:02,070
helping me recover greatly,

583
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:04,770
so I decided

584
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:06,910
take him as my godson.

585
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:09,510
Qiao has an idea.

586
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:11,750
He wants to learn some skills

587
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:16,910
to better serve the Immortal Clan in the future,

588
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:19,350
but the Immortal Clan's spells

589
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:21,710
can't be taught to mortals.

590
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:23,550
Chen Jing,

591
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:25,790
your qi cultivation

592
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:28,760
is extraordinary among the mortal world.

593
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:30,230
What do you think?

594
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,250
Would you like to teach him?

595
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:37,300
You're not willing?

596
00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:41,230
Not everyone can master qi cultivation.

597
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:45,270
If one is not born with the suitable physique,

598
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:46,710
it will be in vain no matter how hard

599
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:47,710
one works.

600
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:49,810
Your Highness has a noble status.

601
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:51,960
Why waste your energy here?

602
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:55,470
A king should constantly strive for self-improvement.

603
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:58,260
I'll stay here and cultivate for a few days.

604
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:01,110
If you think I'm not qualified

605
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:03,240
and will have difficulty succeeding,

606
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:05,630
you can drive me out anytime.

607
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:10,150
I dare not.

608
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:11,909
Since Immortal Gui Mu

609
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:13,870
and the prince have both spoken,

610
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:15,949
I'll naturally obey.

611
00:34:17,429 --> 00:34:20,389
Master, please accept my bow as your disciple.

612
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,590
Your Highness, you flatter me.

613
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:26,100
However,

614
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:28,710
I am busy with work matters these days.

615
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,679
I'm afraid I won't be able to

616
00:34:30,699 --> 00:34:32,270
focus entirely on teaching Your Highness.

617
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:33,550
I dare not hide it from you two.

618
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:35,230
Recently, a man-eating monster

619
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:37,790
has appeared in the mine.

620
00:34:38,949 --> 00:34:40,210
A man-eating monster?

621
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:41,389
I've never heard of

622
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,659
such a monster.

623
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:45,389
In order to increase the bloodstone production,

624
00:34:45,389 --> 00:34:47,760
we dug a few new tunnels in the mine.

625
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:50,940
Perhaps they dug too deeply

626
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:53,030
and an unknown monster

627
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:53,909
was accidentally released

628
00:34:53,909 --> 00:34:55,510
from underground.

629
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:57,640
In the past few days,

630
00:34:58,190 --> 00:35:01,190
this monster has eaten nearly 100 people.

631
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:05,220
I was afraid it might cause panic,

632
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:07,380
so I ordered to block the news.

633
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:10,190
The outside world hasn't found out yet.

634
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:15,070
It has eaten one hundred people?

635
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:18,570
It can eat more than me.

636
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:24,510
I would like to see it.

637
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:37,750
Zhou Qiao?

638
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,000
Isn't this one of

639
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,530
the Immortals who attacked Father back then?

640
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:43,310
They actually

641
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:45,840
came to the Northern Mountain Mine together.

642
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:48,110
This is the mining area.

643
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:49,270
There are

644
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:51,230
more than 3,300 tunnels

645
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:53,540
and 221 tunnels—

646
00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:55,500
Where is that man-eating monster?

647
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:00,870
Hurry up.

648
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:02,540
Get to work.

649
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:05,820
Gou.

650
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:08,230
Come here.

651
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:21,630
Greetings, Mr. Chen Jing.

652
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:23,750
Sir, what can I do for you?

653
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:26,830
Gou, this is the Plague Immortal

654
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:29,720
and this is the prince of Bai State.

655
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,080
Greetings, Immortal.

656
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:33,070
Greetings, Your Highness.

657
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:34,030
They want to know

658
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:35,760
about the man-eating monster.

659
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:37,150
Explain quickly.

660
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,060
The man-eating monster...

661
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:40,870
Wait.

662
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:50,950
You. Raise your head.

663
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:53,870
Raise your head.
