Let's get out of here.

194
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:42,910
I want to go home.

195
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:45,470
Okay.

196
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:47,500
Let's go home.

197
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:52,910
Come on! Let's go home!

198
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:53,430
Let's go home!

199
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:57,270
Let's go home!

200
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:58,230
Let's go home!

201
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,350
We can go home!

202
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:01,710
Let's go home!

203
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:03,300
Let's go home!

204
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:07,720
Let's go home!

205
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:32,520
Good job, Prince Wu Geng!

206
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:34,510
We're saved!

207
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:39,710
We're free!

208
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:41,320
Prince Wu Geng!

209
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:43,350
Welcome, Prince Wu Geng!

210
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:45,660
To think Wu Geng

211
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,710
really succeeded.

212
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:51,230
With a fragile mortal body,

213
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:53,950
he defeated an immortal.

214
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:55,630
Your Majesty.

215
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:57,550
To stabilize the overall situation,

216
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:58,550
you took a step back

217
00:15:58,550 --> 00:15:59,390
and governed

218
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:00,950
Bai state well.

219
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:02,930
The people live and work in peace.

220
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:04,910
You're the only king

221
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:05,830
in our hearts.

222
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,750
Everyone,

223
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:20,680
Immortal King Hei Long's dead.

224
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:24,030
Great Sage will govern Immortal Realm now.

225
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:26,510
They've agreed

226
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:28,150
that from now on,

227
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:29,720
the three realms will rule themselves

228
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,910
and never fight.

229
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:33,750
We're free!

230
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:47,310
Man.

231
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,320
From now on,

232
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,150
I'll show you

233
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:50,470
the peaceful world,

234
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:51,030
okay?

235
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:52,230
We're free.

236
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,070
Great! We're free!

237
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:56,270
We're finally free!

238
00:16:56,270 --> 00:17:00,350
We're free!

239
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:59,150
You have an immortal decree!

240
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:00,640
We have a mortal decree!

241
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:02,310
I'll read it to you now!

242
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,670
The days of immortals bullying mortals

243
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:06,910
are over!

244
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:14,910
Everyone,

245
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:17,110
now that Hei Long's dead,

246
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:19,230
the three realms need to be revived.

247
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:21,150
The clans' settlement

248
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:22,430
is the

249
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:23,230
priority.

250
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:24,740
I have

251
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:26,630
some thoughts about it.

252
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:28,260
I hope

253
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:29,670
you'd hear me out.

254
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:31,070
Here,

255
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:34,510
the most trusted person

256
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:36,030
in the three realms

257
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:37,470
is you.

258
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:42,670
Wu Geng, go ahead.

259
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:47,740
The human race, Demon Clan, Shenyin Clan,

260
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:48,750
and Immortal Clan

261
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:51,070
each has their own

262
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:52,350
traditions

263
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:53,550
and lifestyles.

264
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:55,310
So we still need people

265
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:57,310
who are trustworthy

266
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,070
and most familiar with them

267
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:00,500
to take on the task.

268
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:05,070
Zhou Qiao.

269
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:07,870
You were already qualified

270
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:09,300
and became the Bai King.

271
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:11,070
Under your governance,

272
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:12,950
Bai State was revived.

273
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:14,110
We all

274
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:15,230
witnessed it.

275
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:17,110
I hope you can

276
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:18,150
stay on

277
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:19,350
as Bai King,

278
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:21,510
so that all mortals can

279
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:22,970
live and work in peace.

280
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:25,470
Wu Geng.

281
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:27,630
Do you really think

282
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,910
I can be a qualified king?

283
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:33,170
I've never doubted it.

284
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:41,150
The demons have always wanted

285
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:42,550
to live above ground.

286
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:44,550
King's City might be

287
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:45,910
a good choice.

288
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:49,550
King's City is closest to Demon Clan.

289
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:51,010
It's easier for us to move.

290
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:52,150
But

291
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:54,300
the demon clan

292
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:56,150
lacks a leader now.

293
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:57,970
I've thought about it.

294
00:20:58,150 --> 00:20:59,310
The demons have always

295
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:00,830
believed in survival of the fittest

296
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:01,910
through warfare.

297
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,130
Now that you're above ground,

298
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:05,830
the way you used to live

299
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:07,150
is no longer suitable.

300
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:08,710
Suifeng Qiwu.

301
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:10,230
You know

302
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:11,560
Nitian Erxing the best.

303
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:12,710
You should

304
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:14,540
keep his faith

305
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:15,750
alive.

306
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:18,110
I will do my best.

307
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:24,630
As for Shenyin Clan,

308
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:26,070
we'll still rely on

309
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:28,310
Clan Leader Kong Que and Yun Zhongzi.

310
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:29,550
No problem.

311
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:30,870
With us here,

312
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:32,950
Shenyin Clan will be fine.

313
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:34,510
Don't worry, Wu Geng.

314
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,740
Shi Xing and Xuanfeng Great Sage

315
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:42,110
will take care of the immortals

316
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:43,310
in Immortal Realm.

317
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:44,390
No problem.

318
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:46,430
I'll watch them for you.

319
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:48,270
They won't get a chance

320
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:50,670
to disrupt the peace in the three realms.

321
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:53,670
Fine.

322
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,750
Since you trust me,

323
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,030
I won't

324
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:58,550
let you down.

325
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:00,630
I hope the three realms

326
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:02,150
have a better future

327
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:04,030
under your leadership.

328
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:06,430
Let's get along well as equals

329
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:07,840
and help each other out,

330
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:09,070
eradicating

331
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:10,870
bullying and enslavement

332
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:11,880
for good.

333
00:22:58,590 --> 00:22:59,390
Did I put it on

334
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:01,470
properly this time?

335
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:04,890
It's so pretty.

336
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,910
I'll never throw it away again.

337
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:15,950
Bai Cai.

338
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:19,070
This is my mother's chamber.

339
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:20,670
I'm putting

340
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:21,930
the hairpin on you here

341
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:24,230
to inform my parents

342
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:25,670
that

343
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:27,680
you're my wife.

344
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:29,880
In this life,

345
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:32,350
we'll never be apart.

346
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:48,480
Okay, I promise you.

347
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:50,510
We'll never be apart again.

348

She is getting married, and a convoy came to meet her.

Magpies build nests, and doves take possession of them.

She is getting married, and the convoy sends her away.

369

Magpies build nests, and doves fill them.

370

She is getting married, and the convoy helps her.

371
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:35,350
Let's begin the wedding ceremony.

♫Will there be any response if I think about it?♫

383
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:23,910
♫Don't think about love♫

384
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:30,200
♫We can't forget each other, just like the moonlight♫

385
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:33,430
Bai Cai!

386
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:35,670
Bai Cai.

387
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:41,030
Wu Geng.

388
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:47,670
Wu Geng, I'm sorry.

389
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:49,510
I thought I could

390
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:50,950
stay longer with you.

391
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:52,950
Bai Cai.

392
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:54,510
What are you on about?

393
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:57,910
Clan Leader Kong Que.

394
00:26:57,910 --> 00:26:59,240
Please check on Bai Cai.

395
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:07,080
Bai Cai was already near her end

396
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:09,200
when she was at Immortal Realm.

397
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:11,070
You have the weight of the world

398
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:12,310
on your shoulders,

399
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:14,040
so she kept it from you.

400
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:37,520
Wu Geng.

401
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:39,390
Actually,

402
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:41,660
I'm not that noble.

403
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:44,710
I just selfishly

404
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:47,230
wanted a wedding with you.

405
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:50,270
But...

406
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:53,850
I couldn't even finish it.

407
00:27:58,310 --> 00:27:59,840
Thank you for your company.

408
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:03,430
It was short

409
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:05,480
but

410
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:07,430
beyond wonderful.

411
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:10,270
If...

412
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:13,070
If I had a choice,

413
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:17,310
I'm willing to be by your side

414
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:20,030
forever

415
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:22,110
and ever,

416
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,670
without regrets.

417
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:37,950
Bai Cai.

418
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:42,510
The wedding is done.

419
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:46,060
You are my wife,

420
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:48,720
as heaven and earth had witnessed.

421
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:51,910
In my life,

422
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:55,150
you're my only wife.

423
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:58,270
Wu Geng.

424
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:00,990
You have many years left.

425
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:03,510
Maybe we will

426
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:06,300
meet again one day.

427
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:09,510
Okay.

428
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:11,750
I'll wait for you.

429
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:15,530
Even till the end of the three realms,

430
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:18,230
I'll keep waiting.

00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:46,880
What are you looking at?

472
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:49,270
Father promised

473
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:52,250
to take me to see the sun.

474
00:32:57,950 --> 00:33:00,950
Now that Father is gone,

475
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:05,110
I want to see the sun

476
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:07,830
for him too.

477
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:12,450
Little Dragonfly.

478
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:14,230
Your father

479
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:16,350
and many friends

480
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:18,750
went to another world.

481
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:21,430
I believe

482
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,930
bright sunlight exists there too.

483
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:27,030
From now on,

484
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:28,750
no one will have to

485
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:30,630
live in the dark anymore.

486
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:33,150
We all have a new home.

487
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:43,260
Well said!

488
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:48,960
Sir, I'm going to play.

489
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:56,790
Wu Geng.

490
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:00,510
You always surprised me.

491
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:03,870
Before I found out you defeated Immortal Clan

492
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:05,470
and returned to Bai capital,

493
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:08,760
I was already

494
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:10,960
ready to abdicate.

495
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:14,800
Everything has been reset.

496
00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:16,870
So a new king

497
00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:18,469
should lead us.

498
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:20,949
Am I right?

499
00:34:25,429 --> 00:34:27,230
Everyone has different dreams.

500
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:30,510
Becoming king is your dream,

501
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:32,030
not mine.

502
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:34,510
I just want to see

503
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:36,350
world peace,

504
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:38,630
where everyone

505
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:39,659
has happy

506
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:41,630
and comfortable lives.

507
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:43,830
That's enough.

508
00:34:47,489 --> 00:34:48,810
Your aspiration

509
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,389
is beyond my reach.

510
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:58,830
I have my own path.

511
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:01,150
I believe

512
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:04,800
Bai Cai's divine spirit is still around.

513
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:07,070
She must be waiting for me

514
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:08,670
somewhere.

515
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:12,710
Okay.

516
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,630
I hope both of us

517
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:17,230
get what we want.

518
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:21,670
Zhou Qiao.

519
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:25,230
The people are finally freed from the war

520
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:27,470
and Immortal Clan's enslavement.

521
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:29,350
You must be

522
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:30,310
a good king.

523
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:34,360
Don't worry.

524
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:37,590
I will fulfill my mission

525
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:40,350
and won't let you down.

526
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:01,570

570

00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:55,530
♫Leaving the mortal world behind♫

572
00:37:57,990 --> 00:37:58,830
Wu Geng.

573
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:00,560
Are you sure about leaving?

574
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:02,230
Yes.

575
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:05,790
Although I really hope

576
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:06,670
you'd stay

577
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:07,870
as our leader,

578
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:09,070
I know you have

579
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,950
something more important

580
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:11,870
to do.

581
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,270
I believe one day,

582
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:16,390
your wish will come true.

583
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:20,110
Thank you, Kong Que.

584
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:25,710
Enough.

585
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:29,310
Forget about cheesy stuff.

586
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:31,550
Brat.

587
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:33,440
Since you've decided to leave,

588
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:34,870
drink with me

589
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:36,760
to our hearts' content

590
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,510
tonight.

591
00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:40,670
Sure.

592
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:43,710
Let's get drunk tonight.

593
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:48,350
Geng.

594
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:50,550
Always drink in moderation.

595
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:56,030
Great Swordsman.

596
00:38:57,070 --> 00:38:58,230
Try it first.

597
00:38:58,880 --> 00:38:59,830
You'll know

598
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:02,150
how good this wine is.

599
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:03,990
Here.

600
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:10,270
Have some tea.

601
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:14,700
Wu Geng.

602
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:17,830
Are you going to find Bai Cai?

603
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:19,670
You must bring her back.

604
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:21,870
Tell her...

605
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:26,140
I know it wasn't her

606
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:28,070
who hurt Wu Dong.

607
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:30,070
I...

608
00:39:30,830 --> 00:39:32,070
I miss her a lot.

609
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:33,870
I promise you.

610
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:36,310
I will.

611
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:45,870
Are you going to leave without a word?

612
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:47,230
I knew

613
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:49,310
you'd be waiting for me here.

614
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:54,470
Wu Geng.

615
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:55,710
I want to sincerely

616
00:39:55,990 --> 00:39:57,190
thank you and Bai Cai.

617
00:39:57,670 --> 00:39:58,840
Without you two,

618
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:00,430
I'd still be

619
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:01,550
a zombie

620
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,030
without purpose.

621
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:06,440
She made me realize that I should express love

622
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:07,750
promptly

623
00:40:08,350 --> 00:40:09,670
and bravely confront

624
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:12,110
her presence and absence.

625
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:14,490
I'm even more grateful to you.

626
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:15,950
You defeated Hei Long,

627
00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:17,830
so no one

628
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:18,790
has to suffer

629
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:20,550
like we used to ever again.

630
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:22,590
You eliminated darkness

631
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:23,950
and death

632
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:25,270
in this world.

633
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:27,350
Shi Xing.

634
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,470
This is unlike you.

635
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:32,150
So,

636
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:35,070
what are your plans?

637
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,910
I think I'll travel the world

638
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:40,510
like you,

639
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,590
to see the world's splendor

640
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:43,870
for Mingyue.

641
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:46,070
Maybe

642
00:40:46,790 --> 00:40:48,550
we'll meet somewhere.

643
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:50,150
We will.

644
00:40:58,830 --> 00:40:59,710
Uncle Ziyu.

645
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:01,710
I chose

646
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:02,870
not to be Xin King

647
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:05,150
and continue the reign of Xin State.

648
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:07,120
Are you disappointed in me?

649
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:09,520
No matter what choice you make,

650
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:11,710
I believe

651
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:12,550
your parents

652
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:14,670
will support you.

653
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:16,950
Me too.

654
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:20,360
The

655
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:22,370
continuation of Xin State

656
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:23,910
is not about form

657
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:26,470
but people's hearts.

658
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:29,510
To win people's hearts,

659
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:31,030
let them live in

660
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,110
a properous

661
00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:34,830
and egalitarian country.

662
00:41:36,270 --> 00:41:37,080
By the way,

663
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:40,950
do you know what your parents'

664
00:41:41,830 --> 00:41:43,310
greatest wish is?

665
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:46,350
It is for you

666
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:49,270
to lead

667
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:50,510
a happy

668
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:53,020
life.

669
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:55,270
Uncle Ziyu,

670
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:56,950
don't worry.

671
00:41:58,630 --> 00:42:00,060
No matter where I am,

672
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:01,910
I'll never forget

673
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:03,030
what my parents

674
00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:04,480
and

675
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:06,510
you

676
00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:09,110
taught me,

677
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:11,710
and my responsibilities.

678
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:15,750
So,

679
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:18,600
you've figured out where to go,

680
00:42:19,110 --> 00:42:19,910
right?

681
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:21,910
I think

682
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,560
I'll go to King's City first.

683
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:26,830
The demons

684
00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:28,110
built a new home there.

685
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:30,910
And that place

686
00:42:32,270 --> 00:42:33,960
is also Bai Cai's new home.

687
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:45,100
[Liusha City]

688
00:42:47,470 --> 00:42:48,390
I just saw the Demon Clan's

689
00:42:48,390 --> 00:42:49,510
new city-state.

690
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:50,480
It's well built.

691
00:42:50,910 --> 00:42:52,030
There's no trace

692
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:54,090
of the former destroyed King's City.

693
00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:56,190
Zhou Qiao sent many craftsmen

694
00:42:56,190 --> 00:42:57,670
to help us build it.

695
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:00,370
Zhou Qiao is right.

696
00:43:01,030 --> 00:43:02,510
Only by working and developing

697
00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:03,470
together

698
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:05,350
can the three realms have

699
00:43:05,350 --> 00:43:06,470
long-term peace.

700
00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:08,470
I believe

701
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,630
this is what Nitian Erxing

702
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:11,920
would've wanted.

703
00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:15,470
Wu Geng.

704
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:17,950
Man told me you are

705
00:43:18,550 --> 00:43:19,950
a truly upright and loving

706
00:43:19,950 --> 00:43:20,830
leader

707
00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:22,710
who cherishes

708
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:23,710
the three realms.

709
00:43:24,390 --> 00:43:25,230
In this world,

710
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:27,470
there's no one more fit to be

711
00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:29,920
the three realms' leader than you.

712
00:43:32,470 --> 00:43:33,530
In troubled times,

713
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:35,910
I'm willing to contribute

714
00:43:36,430 --> 00:43:37,710
for the three realms.

715
00:43:39,190 --> 00:43:41,050
But now there's universal peace.

716
00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:43,230
I believe you can

717
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:45,160
find someone more suitable than me

718
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:46,590
to rule the three realms.

719
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:49,270
I'm leaving.

720
00:43:50,350 --> 00:43:51,620
Is it for Bai Cai?

721
00:43:54,070 --> 00:43:54,910
I believe

722
00:43:56,070 --> 00:43:57,070
she's not dead.

723
00:43:58,790 --> 00:43:59,870
She must be waiting for me

724
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:00,670
somewhere.

725
00:44:01,470 --> 00:44:02,230
So,

726
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:04,150
even if I have to

727
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:05,230
travel the world,

728
00:44:06,030 --> 00:44:07,480
I must find her.

729
00:44:12,510 --> 00:44:13,310
Bye.

730
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:21,750
Man.

731
00:44:22,150 --> 00:44:23,510
Wu Geng has sacrificed a lot

732
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:25,140
[Liusha City]

733
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:25,110
for everyone.

734
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:27,230
