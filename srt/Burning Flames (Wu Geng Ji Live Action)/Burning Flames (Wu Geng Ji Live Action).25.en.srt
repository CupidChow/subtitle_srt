[Episode 25]

4
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:43,030
Gou, it's so lively today.

5
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:44,190
It's really lively today.

6
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:45,789
Yes, it is.

7
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:58,580
It's been years since we parted.

8
00:01:58,580 --> 00:01:59,710
I didn't expect

9
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,070
that you successfully

10
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:02,870
left the Northern Mountain Mine

11
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:06,230
and saved so many slaves.

12
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:09,070
I was just lucky.

13
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:10,910
No.

14
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:13,270
You have activated the divine power,

15
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:14,670
you defeated immortals.

16
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:18,890
and you formed an alliance with the Demon Realm.

17
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,910
I believe

18
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:22,070
this is fate.

19
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:24,590
There is still hope for Xin State to revive.

20
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:25,590
You will

21
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:28,230
lead us

22
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:30,630
to rebuild Xin State.

23
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:34,790
If His Majesty were still alive,

24
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:38,350
he would be very happy.

25
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:43,070
General An,

26
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:46,910
I only found out

27
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:48,590
how big

28
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:50,910
this world is

29
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:54,750
after going through a lot outside all these years.

30
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:00,910
I know

31
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:02,590
in Bai State,

32
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:04,710
there are still many officials

33
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:05,750
missing Xin King.

34
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:07,150
Since you're back,

35
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:10,070
I plan to start to gather the old troops now.

36
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,860
Your Highness,

37
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:14,800
when do you plan to take action?

38
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:19,070
I don't plan to start a war against Bai State.

39
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:23,150
As long as the Immortal Clan is not defeated,

40
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,829
both Xin State and Bai State

41
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:25,960
will still

42
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:27,550
be enslaved.

43
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:28,910
There will be no difference

44
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:30,510
from the current situation.

45
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,630
Only by defeating the Immortal Clan

46
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:35,230
can we really succeed.

47
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:41,430
Yes. Don't worry, Your Highness.

48
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:42,550
I believe

49
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:44,510
the old troops of Xin State

50
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:46,670
and the slaves

51
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,750
saved by you in the mine

52
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:50,590
are waiting

53
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:51,670
for your order.

54
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:53,320
If there is a war,

55
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,630
we'll come back as long as you summon us.

56
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:56,390
Good.

57
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:59,250
Actually, in my heart,

58
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:00,870
I already have a plan.

59
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,360
I came to Bai capital this time

60
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:04,910
to prepare

61
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:06,950
for dealing with the Immortal Clan.

62
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:08,070
But

63
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,590
if we want to go to the Immortal Realm,

64
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:11,990
we have to sail on the sea.

65
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:14,310
Our priority now

66
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:15,790
is to find shipbuilders.

67
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:17,350
Okay.

68
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:20,910
Since you have made up your mind,

69
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:25,510
I will follow you in life and death.

70
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,710
Speaking of shipbuilders,

71
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:40,150
I know one.

72
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:41,630
This old official

73
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:43,760
has been missing his homeland.

74
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:44,750
Just like me,

75
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:46,870
he would rather starve

76
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:49,030
than eat the Eternal Fruit.

77
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,550
Who is he?

78
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,950
By the way, De, Shitou,

79
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:54,590
do you know

80
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:55,870
about the Eternal Fruit?

81
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:56,710
The kids said

82
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:58,350
that's the best thing in the world.

83
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:59,920
But Gou and General An said

84
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,350
we can't eat it.

85
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,450
That's right.

86
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,390
You saw it along the way.

87
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:05,670
No one is eating rice.

88
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:07,510
They only eat the Eternal Fruit.

89
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:10,150
That thing was given by the Immortal Clan.

90
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:11,430
They don't need to do anything after the seeds are planted.

91
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:12,710
There will be fruits in a few days.

92
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:13,350
Now

93
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:15,410
it's the grain of Bai State's people.

94
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,270
If the food problem is solved,

95
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,590
they can send all the workers

96
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:20,590
to do mining work.

97
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,390
What a good plan.

98
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:23,510
Yes, think about it.

99
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:24,590
It was given by the Immortal Clan.

100
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,590
What good intentions can they have?

101
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:28,230
They gave it to us free of charge.

102
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:30,360
There must be something wrong with it.

103
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:31,550
Don't worry.

104
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:33,590
Gou already has a plan.

105
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:35,680
I heard

106
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:38,330
Bai King hasn't attended court for days.

107
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:39,390
I think

108
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:40,940
something must have happened

109
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,260
in the palace.

110
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:46,240
Let De investigate this.

111
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:47,270
Now he is

112
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:49,230
the guard captain of the palace of Bai capital.

113
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:51,290
It's more convenient for him to do it.

114
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:55,710
Is he trustworthy?

115
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:56,510
Yes.

116
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:59,070
Also,

117
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:01,870
we must continue to investigate

118
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:04,070
the Eternal Fruit.

119
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,160
Since I'm back,

120
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:07,830
I can't just sit by and watch.

121
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:09,240
But

122
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:12,300
it's full of dangers in Bai State now.

123
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,350
You should be careful.

124
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,150
Don't worry.

125
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,350
Drink.

126
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:19,830
I haven't found out

127
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:20,870
any clue

128
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:22,270
about the Eternal Fruit.

129
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:24,270
That thing is very strange.

130
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:26,070
At first, they planted a few trees a day

131
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,510
in the suburbs and in the city.

132
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:29,350
Later, Bai King suddenly ordered them

133
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:30,950
not to plant them in the city.

134
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,590
So, except the largest tree in the city

135
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:33,790
that can't be moved away,

136
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:35,909
the rest of them have been moved to the suburbs.

137
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:38,070
Then why did Bai King suddenly give the order?

138
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,270
I don't know.

139
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:41,270
Bai King

140
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:43,120
must have found out something.

141
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:44,750
And because of this,

142
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:46,750
he has been imprisoned by Gui Mu.

143
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:49,430
What? Bai King has been imprisoned?

144
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:51,270
Yes.

145
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,230
Sir, please wait a moment.

[Yongsheng Palace]

147
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:53,550
Immortal Gui Mu is inside.

148
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:55,750
It's given by the Immortal Clan.

149
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:57,710
Now I just want

150
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:59,830
some rewards.

151
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:01,910
You're not that petty, right?

152
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:02,910
I will destroy

153
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:04,360
all the Eternal Fruits.

154
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,910
How dare you disobey the order of the Immortal Clan?

155
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:08,110
After that quarrel,

156
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:09,230
Bai King gave an order

157
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:11,070
that forbids them to plant Eternal Trees in the city.

158
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:11,990
Soon after that,

159
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:13,230
Gui Mu said he is sick

160
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,270
and needs to rest.

161
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:15,870
He has hidden him well.

162
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:17,630
Over the past six months,

163
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:18,590
I haven't found any clue

164
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:19,670
about Bai King.

165
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,270
I heard that Gui Mu

166
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,670
asked Zhou Qiao back.

167
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:23,790
De.

168
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:25,070
Find it out

169
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:25,920
as soon as possible.

170
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,590
Okay.

171
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:27,830
Thank you, De.

172
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:30,270
It was not easy for you to get the chance to live a good life.

173
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:31,710
What are you talking about?

174
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:32,909
For you and Gou,

175
00:07:32,909 --> 00:07:33,750
it doesn't matter

176
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,030
if I'm an official.

177
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:35,790
Besides,

178
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:36,810
Gou, if it weren't for you,

179
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:38,159
I would have died in the mine.

180
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:38,750
That's right.

181
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:39,830
If it weren't for you and Gou,

182
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:40,810
I would still be a slave

183
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:41,770
in the mine.

184
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:44,270
You must be hungry.

185
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,510
Eat something first.

186
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:47,670
Let's go eat.

187
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:02,610
Your Highness.

188
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:03,830
No.

189
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:09,710
Gou.

190
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:13,430
I'm thinking

191
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:14,790
this place is not suitable

192
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:16,390
for us to gather together.

193
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:17,990
Should we

194
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:19,990
find a place in the city as soon as possible,

195
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:21,830
so that we can contact each other conveniently?

196
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:22,760
No need for that.

197
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:24,250
This place is okay.

198
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:26,590
The most dangerous place

199
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:28,350
is the safest place.

200
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:35,030
Okay.

201
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:37,909
What makes you so happy?

202
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:39,750
Now you are

203
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:41,950
brave and resourceful.

204
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,120
I'm happy for the late king and queen.

205
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,550
Alright, stop praising me.

206
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:55,050
What makes me happier is

207
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:58,640
you're married now.

208
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,300
You're married to Ms. Bai,

209
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,290
such a good person.

210
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:11,490
Xin State

211
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,000
has a successor.

212
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,000
Married?

213
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:19,840
You...

214
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,960
You and Ms. Bai

215
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,020
have been together for so many years.

216
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,680
Haven't you married yet?

217
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,000
I haven't avenged my family or country.

218
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,030
I don't have time for this.

219
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,690
If so,

220
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,840
I wonder if Ms. Bai

221
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:47,070
has any complaint.

222
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:05,130
Today, Shitou and De

223
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,080
told me a lot

224
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,650
about the Eternal Fruit.

225
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,760
I'm just worried that

226
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:10,560
since the kids have been eating it

227
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,880
for so many years,

228
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,300
will they...

229
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,890
After going through so much,

230
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:19,990
I just feel

231
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,010
the past days

232
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:22,160
weren't that hard.

233
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,440
Although the past life was bitter

234
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,770
because I always didn't have enough food,

235
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,640
I don't need to be afraid

236
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,240
or worried about being used.

237
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,530
It's good

238
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:33,930
to be an ordinary person.

239
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I just think

240
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,560
I can't

241
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,020
go back to the old days.

242
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:43,010
That's not true.

243
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,170
Just like you.

244
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,440
You can never

245
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,900
be that silly Gou anymore.

246
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:54,660
So,

247
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,760
you like the past Gou

248
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,850
more than the current me.

249
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,720
How about this?

250
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:05,980
Tell me

251
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,800
what Gou was like before.

252
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I can imitate him.

253
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,420
All right.

254
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,840
Don't worry.

255
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,800
As long as you,

256
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,160
Snotty and the others, and I exist,

257
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,290
our home exists.

258
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,520
But...

259
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,720
Don't think too much.

260
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,560
We will be safe.

261
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,810
You're right.

262
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:46,690
As long as we stand side by side,

263
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:48,010
nothing will happen.

264
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,090
Gou,

265
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:53,000
today, I told Shitou, De,

266
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,360
and the kids

267
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:56,080
you have mastered the divine power,

268
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,440
defeated immortals,

269
00:11:57,570 --> 00:11:59,160
and formed an alliance with the Demon Clan.

270
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,890
They all think you're amazing.

271
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:04,290
Really?

272
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:07,840
What do you think?

273
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:10,710
I think...

274
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:12,210
you're not bad.

275
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,530
Keep it up.

276
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,720
Bai Cai,

277
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,280
after we defeat Hei Long,

278
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,580
let's get married.

279
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:39,640
Okay.

280
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:45,670
♫Hear rain falling on the window♫

281
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:48,990
♫Lovesickness changed into a wound♫

282
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:52,640
♫I was silently visited♫

283
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:56,520
♫I just don't dare look at you♫

284
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:59,000
♫Where is the person in my heart?♫

285
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:02,770
♫The person in front of me is different♫

286
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:09,190
♫Lies are sorrows♫

287
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,160
Right, Gou,

288
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:08,530
what's your opinion

289
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:09,480
on the mysterious person who saved me today?

290
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:13,940
♫The past and time are intertwined♫

291
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,460
The mysterious person...

292
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,250
Who is it?

293
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:20,120
Gou.

294
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,480
When did you come here?

295
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:23,730
It depends on

296
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:25,000
when you started.

297
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,730
Right?

298
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:26,880
You two go on.

299
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:28,450
We're leaving.

300
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:30,330
Gou, no, Brother-in-law,

301
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:31,770
come on! Come on!

302
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:33,090
Well, you...

303
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:33,850
Let's go.

304
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,290
This... They...

305
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:50,520
Gou!

306
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,360
Gou!

307
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,620
Gou!

308
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,680
Gou!

309
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:08,800
Gou!

310
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,620
Gou!

311
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:14,120
Gou!

312
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:16,030
Gou!

313
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,360
Gou!

314
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:21,990
Gou.

315
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:24,050
Gou.

316
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,330
G-Gou.

317
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,600
Why are you here?

318
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:35,960
Gou.

319
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:38,160
Gou, what's wrong?

320
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:43,240
Bai Cai.

321
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,840
Bai Cai?

322
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:49,010
It's me, Bai Cai.

323
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,760
Is Gou beside you

324
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:10,840
really your Gou?

325
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,550
Who are you?

326
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:16,530
Why are you trying

327
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:18,460
to drive a wedge between me and Gou?

328
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,210
If you really think I'm talking nonsense,

329
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,440
why are you so nervous?

330
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,330
Stop talking nonsense.

331
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:29,840
Leave, okay?

332
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:35,380
Leave, okay?

333
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,410
Leave.

334
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,630
Leave!

335
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,770
Leave!

336
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:43,530
Gou!

337
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,550
Gou!

338
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,620
Gou!

339
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,140
Gou!

340
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:53,960
Gou.

341
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:55,660
Gou!

342
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:58,280
Gou!

343
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,000
Bai Cai,

344
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:01,680
did you have a nightmare?

345
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,490
Gou,

346
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:04,490
I had a horrible dream.

347
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:06,010
Gou in my dream

348
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,010
was not Gou.

349
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:09,970
You fool.

350
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:11,530
How can I not be me?

351
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,530
Gou,

352
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,800
tell me the truth.

353
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,610
Are you the one

354
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:26,320
who grew up with me?

355
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:32,920
Yes.

356
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,170
I am your Gou.

357
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,480
What is this?

358
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,530
Flour.

359
00:17:05,329 --> 00:17:06,680
Where did you find it?

360
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:08,440
I just found

361
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,640
a small

362
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,140
wild wheat field outside.

363
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,450
But the wheat grains

364
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:14,710
can only produce this small bag of flour.

365
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:15,819
This is enough.

366
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:17,880
We can make steamed buns today.

367
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,609
So,

368
00:17:19,849 --> 00:17:21,170
I've asked the kids

369
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:22,700
to boil water and make fire.

370
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,329
Everyone is waiting for you

371
00:17:24,329 --> 00:17:25,930
to show your cooking skills.

372
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:27,329
You glutton.

373
00:17:27,329 --> 00:17:28,560
Let's go. Everyone is hungry.

374
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,490
Hurry. Let's go make steamed buns.

375
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,250
In the past, after military training,

376
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,240
Xin King would always go

377
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,060
to an old couple's steamed buns shop.

378
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,960
The steamed buns made by the old couple

379
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,930
are as delicious as those made by you.

380
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:45,970
I wonder

381
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:47,450
if they

382
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,960
are still alive.

383
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:50,890
How do you know

384
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:52,950
about Xin King's military training?

385
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:01,560
I heard it from others.

386
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,140
Maybe I want to eat steamed buns too much.

387
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:08,960
Right,

388
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,960
Bai Cai, I suddenly remember

389
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,210
I need to go to Mr. An.

390
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:13,160
I want to go too.

391
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:13,970
You stay here

392
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:15,300
to take care of the kids.

393
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,280
I'm leaving.

394
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:18,930
Gou.

395
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,580
Come back quickly.

396
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,720
She really has become suspicious of him.

397
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:38,360
High Priest, I don't understand.

398
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,320
You saved Bai Cai

399
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,580
from Zhou Xiao before.

400
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:43,840
Now you used the Kongshi Realm's illusion

401
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,450
to confuse her mind.

402
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:47,920
Why?

403
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:49,320
I want to drive a wedge

404
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,370
between Wu Geng and Bai Cai.

405
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,320
I want to take advantage of her confusion

406
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,400
between Wu Geng and Gou

407
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,530
to make her hate the person in front of her.

408
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:01,760
I see.

409
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:05,400
My spell is called Kongshi Dream.

410
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:07,040
As time goes by,

411
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,330
no matter how strong

412
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:09,650
her divine power is,

413
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,760
she will believe

414
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,640
the illusion I created for her.

415
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:14,610
By that time,

416
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,720
Bai Cai will believe

417
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,240
whatever I say.

418
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:00,840
Your Majesty,

419
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,080
I'm useless.

420
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,090
I didn't find the medicine that can save you.

421
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,000
Please forgive me

422
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,960
for my incompetence.

423
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,510
I'm incompetent.

424
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:22,280
-Bai Cai.
-Bai Cai.

425
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:23,370
-Bai Cai.
-Bai Cai.

426
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:24,160
Bai Cai,

427
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,080
don't bother

428
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:25,960
to cook anymore.

429
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,440
Let's eat this.

430
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,300
She wants to eat it now?

431
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,050
Gou said

432
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:43,780
we can't eat the Eternal Fruit.

433
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:45,640
Why?

434
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:47,280
This is from the Immortal Clan.

435
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,450
Why can't we eat it?

436
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:49,680
Think about it.

437
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,240
Would we give cats and dogs

438
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,610
the best food?

439
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,400
In the eyes of the Immortal Clan,

440
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,930
we are worse than cats and dogs.

441
00:20:57,930 --> 00:20:59,720
So, would the Immortal Clan

442
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,160
give us the best thing?

443
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:05,170
We should

444
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:06,720
plough the land and harvest grain

445
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,130
with our own hands.

446
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:09,080
Do you understand?

447
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:09,930
From now on, we should

448
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:11,160
pick wild vegetables in the mountain

449
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,290
instead of eating this harmful thing.

450
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,360
-Bai Cai.
-Bai Cai.

451
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,620
Don't throw them away.

452
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,450
General An,

453
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,560
how have you been these days?

454
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,600
Don't worry, Your Highness.

455
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,080
The symptoms of vomiting and hurting

456
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,500
happen occasionally.

457
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,620
But they are not serious anymore.

458
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,650
So,

459
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,480
people who have eaten the Eternal Fruit for a long time

460
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,680
will get sick once they stop eating it.

461
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,400
According to my observation, yes.

462
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:43,640
Even martial artists as strong as us

463
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,090
have gotten sick.

464
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,240
Why haven't those old and weak people

465
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,360
gotten sick?

466
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,080
The reason is

467
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:53,130
they eat

468
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:54,730
the Eternal Fruit every day.

469
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,680
I'm worried

470
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,880
the longer they eat it,

471
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:01,460
the greater harm it will cause.

472
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,080
Bai Cai has to

473
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,330
keep an eye on the kids at all times.

474
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:06,400
Here, eat up.

475
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:08,720
Eat up.

476
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:09,600
Let me tell you.

477
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,240
My cooking skills

478
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,340
has improved a lot.

479
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:18,210
Biggie, eat up.

480
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,520
Eat it while it's hot.

481
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,690
After eating the buns I made,

482
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:30,550
you wouldn't want to eat

483
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:31,720
that disgusting fruit.

484
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,490
Eat up.

485
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,600
Glutton! What's wrong?

486
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:51,880
The smell alone disgusts me.

487
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,230
Who wants to eat your buns?

488
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:55,040
We want to eat the Eternal Fruit!

489
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:56,320
That fruit

490
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,320
made you like this.

491
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,250
You can't eat it.

492
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,620
I want to eat the Eternal Fruit!

493
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,650
I want to eat the Eternal Fruit!

494
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:05,320
You can't eat it.

495
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:06,530
Stop this.

496
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:08,410
You're upsetting me.

497
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,250
You can't eat it.

498
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:12,130
We want to eat the Eternal Fruit!

499
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,610
Let me out!

500
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,010
Help the children detoxify their bodies.

501
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,230
It's already noon.

502
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,850
De went to the palace to investigate.

503
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:40,250
Why isn't there any news?

504
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,560
I'll go

505
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:42,880
check the palace.

506
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:44,050
General An.

507
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,720
You can't go.

508
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,040
I'm afraid the palace guards

509
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,560
recognize your appearance

510
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,290
because of

511
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:51,690
the man-eating monster.

512
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:52,860
Mother.

513
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,560
Geng.

514
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,350
This is...

515
00:24:58,090 --> 00:24:58,880
Mother.

516
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,960
Father gave you this hairpin, right?

517
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,320
You seem to love it.

518
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,050
When I married

519
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:04,040
your father,

520
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:05,520
he gave it to me.

521
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,330
Geng.

522
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:08,650
If you meet

523
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:10,040
the girl you like,

524
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,170
tell me.

525
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,320
I'll give her this hairpin,

526
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,130
okay?

527
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,640
But I think

528
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,400
no one is

529
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,840
as pretty as you.

530
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,410
You're the sweetest.

531
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:35,930
Stop!

532
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,520
Your Highness.

533
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:38,720
[Lingze Palace]

534
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:42,900
Raise your head.

535
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,610
I remember you.

536
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,600
You were

537
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,530
Wu Geng's fellow slave in the mine.

538
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,890
Why are you here?

539
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,290
I am now

540
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:56,850
the captain of security in the Imperial Palace.

541
00:25:56,850 --> 00:25:58,490
I guard the capital.

542
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,520
As the captain,

543
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:04,040
why were you so flustered?

544
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:05,240
I...

545
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,900
It's my first time seeing you,

546
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:09,080
so I was nervous.

547
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:11,890
Really?

548
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,210
This is the only way

549
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:15,240
to my father's chamber.

550
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,480
Don't you know

551
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:20,370
this is a forbidden place in the palace?

552
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,880
Why

553
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,450
are you here?

554
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,970
I'm just worried about

555
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:27,140
Bai King's safety.

556
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,040
That's why...

557
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,440
I think Wu Geng sent you here

558
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,370
to inquire about my palace's situation

559
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:34,300
and find the chance to cause chaos.

560
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:39,880
Gou!

561
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:41,680
Gou.

562
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,490
Wu Geng?

563
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:44,050
Long time no see.

564
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:46,040
Speak of

565
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,480
the devil.

566
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,420
Didn't you also

567
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:49,280
lead troops

568
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,680
to my residence?

569
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:52,200
I should also

570
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,120
reciprocate.

571
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,660
Where do you think this is?

572
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:56,160
I'm...

573
00:26:57,890 --> 00:26:59,550
too familiar with this place.

574
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:02,320
This used to be my home.

575
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,170
Your home?

576
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:07,890
It's all in the past.

577
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,160
Now the capital

578
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,730
belongs to Bai State.

579
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,050
Really?

580
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:18,130
Then why is a Bai prince

581
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:20,190
bowing down to

582
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:21,600
a crippled immortal?

583
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:23,090
In my opinion,

584
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,740
you're just Immortal Clan's lapdog.

585
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:26,610
No.

586
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,480
Zhou Fa is a lapdog.

587
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:30,630
You're not qualified.

588
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:37,610
What are you doing?

589
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,100
In the eyes of immortals,

590
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,070
you are just a lowly slave.

591
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:43,920
They don't care about you.

592
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:45,810
What's wrong with

593
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,430
being the immortals' slave?

594
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:48,820
At least in the mortal world,

595
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:50,170
I'm omnipotent.

596
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:52,230
Omnipotent?

597
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:55,200
De.

598
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:56,530
Tell him

599
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,170
what happened to

600
00:27:58,410 --> 00:27:59,730
Bai King, Zhou Fa.

601
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:02,580
Bai King is imprisoned.

602
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:03,890
He's half-dead.

603
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,250
Impossible!

604
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:09,040
Zhou Qiao.

605
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:10,620
Your lian qi technique

606
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:11,970
is decent.

607
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,320
In the whole palace,

608
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:14,690
other than Gui Mu,

609
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,690
no one can stop you.

610
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,170
If you don't believe me,

611
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:21,440
you can check it yourself.

612
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:27,690
Guards!

613
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,680
Arrest him!

614
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,490
Did Father really

615
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,540
end up as they said?

616
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:47,870
Good.

617
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,640
I was afraid of

618
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:52,100
Wu Geng's Colorless divine power.

619
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:54,460
He's not with Bai Cai now.

620
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,780
It's my chance.

621
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:06,830
De.

622
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:09,250
If you have any questions,

623
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:10,080
just ask.

624
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,880
Gou, just now,

625
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,900
why did Zhou Qiao call you Wu Geng?

626
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,660
It's a long story.

627
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:24,040
I'm indeed Xin King's son,

628
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:25,040
Wu Geng.

629
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:27,130
It's just that

630
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:28,120
I can only

631
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:29,630
live as Gou now.

632
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,520
Sorry

633
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:33,250
for not telling you.

634
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:37,360
I don't care if you're Gou

635
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,210
or Wu Geng.

636
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,200
The one I know

637
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,120
saved my life in the mine,

638
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:44,050
risked his life for his comrades,

639
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:45,330
fought for us,

640
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:48,470
and helped free everyone.

641
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,360
He's a hero.

642
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:53,290
This is good news.

643
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:54,490
I have

644
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,040
another friend,

645
00:29:56,570 --> 00:29:57,370
Wu Geng.

646
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,730
Thank you, De.

647
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,720
But I want to

648
00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:09,890
tell Bai Cai this myself.

649
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:10,910
So...

650
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:11,690
So,

651
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,580
you'll always be Gou to me.

652
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,000
I won't be servile

653
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,250
just because you're

654
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:18,600
a prince.

655
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,240
De.

656
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,240
Go back to Orphan Village first.

657
00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:28,030
I'll ask around for a solution

658
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,960
about the Eternal Fruit problem.

659
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:30,640
Okay.

660
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,510
What should I do?

661
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,660
Why is nothing

662
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,560
working?

663
00:30:57,650 --> 00:30:59,200
The poison in their bodies

664
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:02,450
can only be suppressed with lian qi technique.

665
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:04,480
Lian qi technique?

666
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:05,400
Yes.

667
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:06,840
Wu Geng

668
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:09,170
is a master of lian qi technique.

669
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:11,290
Wu Geng?

670
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,840
You mean Prince Wu Geng of Xin State?

671
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:18,140
It seems

672
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:20,920
you know nothing.

673
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:22,960
Let me tell you.

674
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:25,640
General An by Wu Geng's side

675
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,520
was poisoned

676
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,520
with this same poison.

677
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:29,820
Wu Geng

678
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,880
used lian qi technique to suppress it

679
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:34,170
and brought him to this room.

680
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:36,880
General An?

681
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:40,790
You mean Mr. An?

682
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,530
I knew it.

683
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:44,880
He never told you

684
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,050
about this?

685
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:50,720
Forget it.

686
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:52,680
Ask no more.

687
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,440
There's no time to lose.

688
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,880
Go find Wu Geng.

689
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,440
I mean...

690
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:01,280
Go find your Gou.

691
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:04,330
Wu Geng?

692
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:07,960
Gou?

693
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:13,040
Gou.

694
00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:17,090
Wu Geng.

695
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:22,930
Bai Cai.

696
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,360
Bai Cai, what happened?

697
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:29,240
Shitou, watch the kids.

698
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,370
I'll find a way.

699
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:30,980
Okay.

700
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:48,650
If I absorb

701
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:51,290
Bai Cai's ancient divine power,

702
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,690
I'll definitely recover.

703
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,330
My power will even

704
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,890
be upgraded.

705
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,330
What?

706
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:08,180
High Priest.

707
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,450
You don't

708
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:13,030
want me to attack Bai Cai?

709
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:16,650
Xinyue Kui got involved.

710
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,280
I'll have to find

711
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:20,240
another way to kill Bai Cai.

712
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:22,200
Xinyue Kui.

713
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:25,390
We are enemies.

714
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,440
Looking around aimlessly won't do.

715
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:33,000
Right!

716
00:33:50,050 --> 00:33:51,930
We still haven't heard from Shenyin Clan.

717
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:54,330
Since their village has just been rebuilt,

718
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,890
they must be too busy

719
00:33:55,890 --> 00:33:56,970
to take note of it.

720
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,560
What brings you here?

721
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:35,860
Father!

722
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:38,889
Qiao.

723
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:40,719
Father!

724
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:42,199
Hurry!

725
00:34:42,219 --> 00:34:43,010
Qiao.

726
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:43,880
Father.

727
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,650
Qiao.

728
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:03,200
Zhou Fa is your biological father.

729
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,400
What do you think?

730
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,780
Seeing your biological father

731
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,250
like this.

732
00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:13,650
How does it feel?

733
00:35:15,090 --> 00:35:17,540
Don't you want to work with Wu Geng

734
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:22,170
to avenge your biological father?

735
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:26,990
Would Zhou Qiao turn against Gui Mu

736
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:28,270
for Bai King?

737
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,000
He

738
00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:31,520
might hesitate.

739
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,080
But in order to

740
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,540
become the almighty king,

741
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:36,530
he will.

742
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,850
When I was young,

743
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
he sent me to Xin State as a hostage.

744
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,650
He was never a father

745
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:47,890
to me.

746
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,120
Although he and I

747
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,050
are father and son,

748
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,600
we have no emotional ties.

749
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:04,810
As for Wu Geng,

750
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,600
I've been living in

751
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,280
the shadow of this name.

752
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:12,290
I wish

753
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:14,240
I could kill him.

754
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,330
Godfather.

755
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:22,740
In this world,

756
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:24,830
only you recognize my talent.

757
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:26,100
Only you

758
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,490
can help me get the throne.

759
00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:28,640
Why would I foolishly

760
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,900
join hands with Wu Geng

761
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:31,870
and give up the throne

762
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:33,170
at my fingertips?

763
00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:43,840
Godfather.

764
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:45,800
I only have one father

765
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:49,250
who loves me.

766
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:52,270
That's you.

767
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:02,860
I was right about you.

768
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:05,750
Bai King!

769
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:08,210
Your biological son

770
00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:11,040
can achieve great things.

771
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,650
In that case, not only Bai King

772
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:21,510
but those Eternal Trees

773
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:23,270
we saw in the suburbs were also

774
00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:25,690
morphed from humans?

775
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:27,040
So,

776
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,330
people didn't go missing

777
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,540
because of some man-eating monster.

778
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:33,440
They

779
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:34,840
became trees.

780
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,370
The immortals are too much,

781
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,040
hatching such a

782
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,170
despicable scheme.

783
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:42,230
If I'm right,

784
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:44,650
Zhou Qiao already knows

785
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:46,870
the true identity of the Eternal Fruit.

786
00:37:47,810 --> 00:37:48,570
Lan.

787
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,330
You've been in Immortal Realm for a long time.

788
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:52,120
Have you

789
00:37:52,210 --> 00:37:54,000
heard of the Eternal Fruit?

790
00:37:55,290 --> 00:37:56,880
No.

791
00:37:57,690 --> 00:37:59,010
Like you,

792
00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:01,770
it's my first time seeing the Eternal Tree.

793
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:03,550
However,

794
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:05,410
Kong Que told me

795
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:08,250
there is a kind of plant in Illusion Island.

796
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:10,320
It's very similar to the Eternal Fruit

797
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,180
you described.

798
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:12,930
Maybe

799
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:15,180
lian qi technique

800
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:17,170
can suppress the Eternal Fruit.

801
00:38:19,810 --> 00:38:21,640
I wish Uncle Ziyu were here.

802
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:24,120
I'll go find him.

803
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,410
Illusion Island is too far.

804
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:29,490
You might not make it in time.

805
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,370
Don't worry. I have my way.

806
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,380
Stand up!

807
00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:37,440
In the past,

808
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,250
Xin King and Wu Geng

809
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:43,890
overestimated themselves

810
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:45,920
and challenged

811
00:38:46,010 --> 00:38:47,650
Immortal Clan.

812
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,290
How did they end up?

813
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:53,590
The country was destroyed

814
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,940
and they perished.

815
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,530
If Wu Geng

816
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,640
didn't have an immortal mother,

817
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,940
he'd have died

818
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:06,430
in the fire at Zhaixing Pavilion.

819
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,010
Now,

820
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,680
he learned some petty tricks

821
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:13,800
from some traitors

822
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:17,850
and wants to challenge Immortal Clan again.

823
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,850
Zhou Qiao.

824
00:39:23,290 --> 00:39:24,320
Remember,

825
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,310
a mortal

826
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,530
will always be a mortal,

827
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:34,250
who can never defeat immortals.

828
00:39:35,090 --> 00:39:36,550
You're right, Godfather.

829
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:38,980
Qiao.

830
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,740
I know

831
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,040
you only care about

832
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,190
the throne.

833
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,660
In this world,

834
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:50,510
only I

835
00:39:52,370 --> 00:39:55,910
can give you that.

836
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,050
I understand.

837
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,040
I won't let you down.

838
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:06,470
The more I look at you, the more I like you.

839
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:12,000
Now Wu Geng and his men

840
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:16,320
know where Zhou Fa is.

841
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,590
They will try their best

842
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,360
to save him.

843
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,170
What should we do?

844
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,480
Let's design a scheme that's like

845
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,880
taking candy from a baby.

846
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,480
Don't worry, Godfather.

847
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,120
I will capture Wu Geng back

848
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:35,300
and avenge

849
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,110
you and me.

850
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:45,100
It's up to you.

851
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,140
What about you? What's your plan?

852
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:51,120
I heard there's a festival tonight

853
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:54,440
called... Immortal Appreciation Festival.

854
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:55,880
It's a festival

855
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:57,530
Bai King established in recent years

856
00:40:57,530 --> 00:40:59,190
to thank Immortal Realm for giving them

857
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:00,510
the Eternal Fruit.

858
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,440
Isn't it ironic?

859
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,090
The Immortal Appreciation Festival

860
00:41:04,090 --> 00:41:05,360
will be very lively.

861
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:08,880
The Imperial Guards will patrol the city

862
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:09,940
to maintain order.

863
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,450
The palace's defense

864
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,010
will be very weak.

865
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,650
I see.

866
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,570
Someone's here.

867
00:41:21,010 --> 00:41:23,610
Gou! Lan!

868
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:25,560
Bai Cai?
