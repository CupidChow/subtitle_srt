[Episode 4]

4
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,680
I see.

5
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,840
I got it.

6
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,960
This jade pendant

7
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,240
looks very expensive.

8
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,360
Gou, it seems

9
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,920
you're not entirely ignorant.

10
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,590
You knew

11
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:57,920
that the Xin King had a lot of good stuff on him

12
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,850
and wanted to get some loot, right?

13
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,840
Good for you, Gou.

14
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:04,290
This thing

15
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:05,870
can feed the kids for years.

16
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,560
Bai Cai, let me out.

17
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,480
Give me back my jade pendant.

18
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,540
Give it back to you?

19
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,790
You eat and drink my stuff.

20
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:21,960
Even you yourself belongs to me.

21
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,670
How dare you settle accounts with me?

22
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:25,070
I found the jade pendant.

23
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:25,800
Don't forget

24
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,040
you brought back a fugitive too.

25
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,180
He eats a lot.

26
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,000
Medicine and food

27
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,050
all cost money.

28
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:30,920
How dare you

29
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,520
ask me for this jade pendant?

30
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,160
Don't look at me like that.

31
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,920
You'll know how expensive things are when you manage the household.

32
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,560
Let's go.

33
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,000
Crybaby and the others will be back soon.

34
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,200
They'll be anxious if they don't see us.

35
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,520
Take your stuff.

36
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,760
Don't just stand there. Keep up.

37
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,070
For General An,

38
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,220
I'll put up with it.

39
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,160
Kids, time to eat.

40
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,900
You must be hungry.

41
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,320
Come on.

42
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,760
Biggie,

43
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,680
split it among everyone.

44
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,350
Okay.

45
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:07,840
Here.

46
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,840
Give it to me first.

47
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,960
I want it.

48
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,400
Give it to me first.

49
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,520
Me too.

50
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,160
Gou.

51
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,240
Gou.

52
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,000
Give it to me.

53
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,860
Bring it to the one in the room.

54
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,320
Don't get me wrong.

55
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,360
I just think he's badly injured

56
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,280
and needs to eat more food.

57
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,810
This way, he can get to work.

58
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,280
I'm not pitying him.

59
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,420
Thank you.

60
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:42,150
Gou

61
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,560
isn't stupid anymore

62
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:46,180
and he looks quite nice when he smiles.

63
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:00,820
It's really delicious.

64
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:01,820
It's so good.

65
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:02,890
Listen up.

66
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:04,230
The man inside

67
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,230
is a hero.

68
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,600
Even if I'm not around,

69
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,640
you have to take good care of him in the future.

70
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,400
Understand?

71
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,560
Yes.

72
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,360
Eat up.

73
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,290
It's delicious.

74
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:16,880
Gou.

75
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,800
Have some too.

76
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,209
Take it.

77
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:21,970
Take it.

78
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,120
I'm the commoner Gou now.

79
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,740
I'm no longer a prince.

80
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:39,230
Eating bran is better than starving.

81
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,720
This bowl is chipped.

82
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,980
Why are you still using it?

83
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,180
Just throw it away.

84
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,159
Throw it away?

85
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,980
What will we use to eat if we throw it away?

86
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,240
Just rotate it.

87
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,560
Eat.

88
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,160
Eat.

89
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:05,270
What's your name?

90
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:19,810
You're like a puppy.

91
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,600
Then I'll call you

92
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:23,370
Gou, like a puppy.

93
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,640
Gou.

94
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:25,920
Gou.

95
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:27,060
Gou.

96
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,480
Gou.

97
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:30,920
Gou.

98
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:13,840
Gou.

99
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,360
Gou.

100
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,280
I'm here.

101
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:22,530
Bai Cai.

102
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,630
Bai Cai.

103
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:26,080
Bai Cai.

104
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:26,830
Bai Cai.

105
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,120
Bai Cai.

106
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,240
Bai Cai.

107
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,400
Bai Cai.

108
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,480
Bai Cai.

109
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,080
Bai Cai.

110
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,080
Bai Cai.

111
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,720
Bai Cai.

112
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,530
Bai Cai.

113
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,560
Bai Cai.

114
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:39,940
Why is she so cold?

115
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,880
Gou, have you forgotten?

116
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:44,890
This is Bai Cai's old ailment.

117
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,680
She's often like this.

118
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,260
When she gets sick,

119
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,760
she's as cold as ice.

120
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:54,590
How could I forget?

121
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:57,470
I'll get her some hot water to drink.

122
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:58,070
No, don't.

123
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,920
You're always the one

124
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,240
who cures Bai Cai.

125
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:02,600
We'll go boil the water.

126
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,000
You stay here

127
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,260
and accompany Bai Cai.

128
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,180
Gou, how about this?

129
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,880
Take care of Ms. Bai.

130
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,200
I'll take them to boil water.

131
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,000
Let's go.

132
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,960
Okay, let's go.

133
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,480
Let's go.

134
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:23,260
She's usually very energetic.

135
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:25,910
How can she fall sick without warning?

136
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,360
Gou.

137
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:35,580
G-Gou.

138
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,400
Here.

139
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:48,320
It's okay. It's an old ailment.

140
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:49,940
Give me a massage.

141
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:53,030
It'll be fine after a while.

142
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:54,710
You'll be fine with a massage?

143
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,200
How is that possible?

144
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:58,710
You need to take medicine when you're sick.

145
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,200
There should be a lot of herbs at home.

146
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:01,990
Tell me

147
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,280
which one can cure you.

148
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,200
I'll make the medicine for you.

149
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,040
My illness...

150
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,320
There's no cure for my illness.

151
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,200
My illness can't be cured either.

152
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,130
How can you not treat your illness?

153
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:12,910
I know my illness.

154
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,250
I got it.

155
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,080
You must be unhappy

156
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,240
because you're sick, right?

157
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,100
How about this?

158
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,600
I'll first make you some medicine

159
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,360
for your cold.

160
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,200
Wait for me here.

161
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,200
Come back!

162
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,480
There's some warm water on the stove.

163
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:25,670
Give it to Ms. Bai—

164
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,410
She doesn't—

165
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,440
What happened to her?

166
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,200
She fainted.

167
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,480
She fainted?

168
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:34,740
Bai Cai.

169
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:35,450
Ms. Bai.

170
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,240
Take care of the kids here.

171
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,280
I'll take her to the clinic.

172
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,720
Okay, be careful.

173
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,560
Hurry up.

174
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,360
How is she?

175
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,760
Why are you sighing?

176
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,800
This is bad.

177
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,560
Bad?

178
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,220
Is there no cure?

179
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:06,610
Why is it him?

180
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:07,960
Why did you get this

181
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,080
greedy quack to treat me?

182
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,000
This woman

183
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,930
was born with

184
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:16,530
a cold and weak aura.

185
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,130
Can it be cured?
When I recover,

186
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:19,540
you two will be the first I deal with.

187
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,700
It can be cured,

188
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,360
but we're in chaotic times now.

189
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,520
Look. All the herbs in this room

190
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,560
have been expropriated by the officials.

191
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,080
If you want treatment,

192
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,320
you'll need many shells.

193
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,450
He wants to scam you.

194
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,170
I don't want treatment.

195
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,290
Bai Cai.

196
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,170
This is my life.

197
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:41,640
I don't want that quack

198
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,370
to treat me.

199
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,320
He doesn't even know

200
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,450
what my illness is.

201
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:45,910
Bai Cai, stop it.

202
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,520
Everyone has only one life.

203
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,760
Only by surviving can there be hope.

204
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,320
Am I right?

205
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,360
You're not helping me.

206
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,560
You're making me mad.

207
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,120
When I was sick before,

208
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,560
Gou would stay by my side

209
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,760
and treat my illness.

210
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,280
I'm treating your illness right now.

211
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,280
Stop pretending.

212
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,020
You are not Gou at all.

213
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,520
You don't even remember an important thing

214
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,370
like this.

215
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:08,370
Didn't I tell you?

216
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,040
After I got hurt,

217
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,880
I remembered my childhood,

218
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,360
but for some reason,

219
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:15,820
I can't remember the past.

220
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:18,190
Don't take me.

221
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,300
Behave yourself.

222
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:20,160
I won't go.

223
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,560
It's your honor to serve the Immortal Clan.

224
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,680
It’s not up to you.

225
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,760
Don't take me!

226
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:25,860
Don't take me. I won't go!

227
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,190
Go! How dare you escape!

228
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:28,140
I won't go.

229
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:30,270
Don't take me.

230
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:31,290
What's wrong?

231
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:32,520
Bad news!

232
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:33,640
The Bai Army is capturing forced laborers

233
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,720
for the Northern Mountain Mine.

234
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,120
Hurry through the back door.

235
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,120
If they find out

236
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,200
that I'm hiding laborers,

237
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,320
I'll be in trouble.

238
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,280
Hurry and go.

239
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:41,240
Can you walk?

240
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:41,890
Yes.

241
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:42,560
Come on.

242
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:43,610
Hurry.

243
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:44,640
Hurry up!

244
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:53,400
Stop! Catch them!

245
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:54,450
What are you doing?

246
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:55,680
Shut up and just follow me.

247
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,360
Stop!

248
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,730
Take them away.

249
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:01,560
Officer, this is my husband.

250
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,720
We just got married.

251
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,950
We haven't had a child yet.

252
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:04,850
Take him anyway.

253
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:05,510
Wait.

254
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:07,240
According to the law,

255
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,730
childless couples are not to be conscripted

256
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:09,440
to the mine.

257
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,560
You are

258
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,880
openly violating the law.

259
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,710
Aren't you afraid of being punished?

260
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:14,540
Law?

261
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,590
That was the law of the former Xin State.

262
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:18,460
Now, the Bai King has issued a new law.

263
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:20,120
Other than the old, weak and disabled,

264
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,730
all civilians able to work

265
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:23,110
must be conscripted to the mines

266
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:24,570
until the quota is filled,

267
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,600
no matter if they're married with kids or not.

268
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,400
How can the Bai King

269
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,000
disregard the lives of the people like this?

270
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,060
Take them all away!

271
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,710
How dare you disobey orders?

272
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:52,170
Call for reinforcements!

273
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:07,990
Actually, I'm not that good at fighting.

274
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,390
They were too weak.

275
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:30,300
Thank you. I feel much better.

276
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:31,420
Let's hurry back.

277
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,150
Thank you?

278
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:37,850
She really doesn't believe me anymore.

279
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,120
I'll slowly widen the distance

280
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,120
between us.

281
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,640
You run when the timing is right.

282
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,500
What about you?

283
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:20,510
I can more than handle it.

284
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,400
If you stay here,

285
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,240
you'll hold me back.

286
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,960
No, we must run together.

287
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,370
Run!

288
00:17:17,849 --> 00:17:19,079
He was trying to stall the tiger

289
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,079
and let me escape.

290
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:24,880
No.

291
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:26,520
Whether he is Gou or not,

292
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:28,040
I can't abandon him.

293
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:38,240
They said he could

294
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,150
fight a bunch by himself.

295
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,120
[Zhazha]

296
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:40,250
He's just so-so.

297
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,450
White Tiger!

298
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,520
Come here.

299
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,790
This guy is quite a fighter.

300
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,610
Take them both back.

301
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:07,390
Yes.

302
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:15,820
Hurry up.

303
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:16,680
Go up.

304
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,600
Let's go in.

305
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,240
What are you yelling for?

306
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,660
Get in. Behave yourself.

307
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:36,550
Mother.

308
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:38,500
Please help me.

309
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,610
Can you save me?

310
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,940
Take care of them.

311
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,540
Your Highness.

312
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:50,240
Ms. Bai.

313
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:26,760
Go away.

314
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:32,110
I'm leaving.

315
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:34,010
Your Highness!

316
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:51,000
I can't expose His Highness's identity.

317
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:54,840
Gou!

318
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:01,550
Take care of the children.

319
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:02,540
I'll check out the mine.

320
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:03,150
Okay.

321
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:04,770
I'll wait for your return.

322
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:06,870
Take care.

323
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:16,390
His Highness.

324
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,060
Be careful.

325
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:24,820
Mother.

326
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:52,910
What's wrong?

327
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:55,590
Hey,

328
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:57,770
you don't look much older than me,

329
00:20:57,770 --> 00:20:59,300
but you already have a wife.

330
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:01,460
You're lucky.

331
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:03,450
What wife?

332
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:06,430
You mean her?

333
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:07,550
She's not my—

334
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:08,610
It's because of my poor luck

335
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:10,280
that I married such a loser.

336
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:12,700
You must be careful.

337
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,450
Plus, who knows what'll happen

338
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:15,590
to a woman going into

339
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:16,870
somewhere like a mine?

340
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:19,110
You have to protect your wife.

341
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:20,100
That's right.

342
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:21,750
Your wife is so beautiful.

343
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,040
Maybe someone will get

344
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,970
attracted to her along the way.

345
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:35,640
I'm the unlucky one

346
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:37,110
to have married

347
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:38,270
such a feisty wife,

348
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:40,780
but I'm not afraid.

349
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:43,540
I can even fight a tiger.

350
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:44,900
If anyone dares

351
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:46,050
to touch my wife,

352
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:47,320
I'll beat

353
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:48,470
his brains out.

354
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:49,750
That's right, bro.

355
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,070
I heard that the Northern Mountain Mine

356
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:07,620
is a scary place.

357
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:08,920
So what?

358
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:10,980
We used to be the slaves of Xin State.

359
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,590
Now we're slaves of Bai State.

360
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:14,390
It's just that we got a new owner.

361
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,000
Sooner or later, we have to go through this.

362
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:19,820
Some slaves have comfortable lives.

363
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:21,180
I heard that some slaves

364
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,950
eat fish and meat every day.

365
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:25,390
Even if we get to eat fish and meat every day,

366
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,380
you'll never come out of the mine

367
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,700
once you enter it.

368
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:30,780
What's the point

369
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,910
of living like this?

370
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:40,350
Is it really impossible to get out?

371
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:55,640
[Northern Mountain Mine]

372
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,160
Is this the Northern Mountain Mine?

373
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,270
My mother told me

374
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:06,470
that this place

375
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:08,350
is truly hell.

376
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:10,300
If you're lucky,

377
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:11,100
a teenager

378
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,780
can survive for 20 or 30 years,

379
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:15,350
but in the end, you'll still die from exhaustion.

380
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:16,240
My father

381
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:17,650
was conscripted to the Northern Mountain

382
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:19,090
not long after I was born.

383
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,050
There was no news of him after that.

384
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,080
My mother said

385
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,620
he's already died inside.

386
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,120
Anyone

387
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:33,150
who enters the Northern Mountain Mine

388
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:34,940
can only see

389
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:37,510
the light of day again in death.

390
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:06,550
Even such a little kid...

391
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,030
Get in.

392
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:11,380
Hurry up.

393
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:12,880
Look.

394
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:13,690
What are you waiting for?

395
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:14,450
Okay.

396
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,370
Hurry up.

397
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:18,250
Hurry up. Over there.

398
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:19,890
When the Xin King was alive,

399
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:20,820
a teenager

400
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,150
could escape this fate.

401
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:23,530
Now that the Bai State is in power,

402
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:24,490
the people of the Xin State

403
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:25,940
have become captives of the Bai State.

404
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:27,370
Those with the strength to work

405
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:29,180
have all been sent here as laborers.

406
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:30,410
Might makes right.

407
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:33,330
Does the loser have to be at the mercy of others?

408
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:34,290
Stop dilly-dallying.

409
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:35,520
How dare a few slaves like you put on airs?

410
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,290
What are you doing?

411
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:37,010
Sir, sir.

412
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:38,370
Sir, my husband isn't right in his head.

413
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:39,420
He's a fool.

414
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:40,740
Please don't mind him.

415
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:41,330
He's not right in the head.

416
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:41,940
Enough.

417
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:42,820
It doesn't matter if he's smart or not.

418
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:43,650
Mining is physical labor.

419
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:44,210
Hurry up.

420
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:44,970
Okay.

421
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:45,490
Hurry up.

422
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:46,420
Hurry, let's go.

423
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:47,130
Go!

424
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,650
Hurry up. Go that way.

425
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:55,030
Get over there.

426
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:59,430
What are you doing? Stand still.

427
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:01,150
Are you crippled? Stand up!

428
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:02,530
Stand up!

429
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:04,830
Mr. Chen Jing has arrived.

430
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:30,170
[Chen Jing]

431
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:36,450
How many people were recruited this time?

432
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,330
Sir,

433
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:39,970
we recruited

434
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:41,570
80 strong workers this time.

435
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:47,130
You all traveled a long way to get here

436
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:49,620
and must be tired.

437
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:53,610
However, the most difficult part

438
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,020
has passed.

439
00:25:56,610 --> 00:26:00,210
The life in the mine is quite nice.

440
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:01,330
In the future,

441
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:04,180
we will live and mine together,

442
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:07,770
like family.

443
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:11,200
If you need anything in the future,

444
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:13,140
just let me know.

445
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:16,610
I will try my best to satisfy you.

446
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:19,450
You won't be treated badly.

447
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:24,450
Is he telling the truth?

448
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:25,460
No way.

449
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:26,610
He's just

450
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:27,530
purposely saying nice things

451
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:28,720
to deceive us.

452
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:31,930
What a hypocrite.

453
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:33,250
I hope our future days

454
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:34,260
won't be too hard.

455
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:37,080
Father.

456
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:39,080
This place is not fun at all.

457
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,290
I don't want to stay here anymore.

458
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:41,420
I want to play a horseback-riding game.

459
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:42,610
Okay.
A horse riding game.

460
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:43,450
Okay.

461
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:45,130
I'll take you there now.

462
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,270
I'll take you there now.

463
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:47,590
Great!

464
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:51,900
Father, hurry up.

465
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:53,130
Father, let's go!
Alright. we're going now.

466
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:53,490
Hurry up, Father.

467
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:54,490
Let's go now.

468
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:55,770
We'll go right now,

469
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:56,690
my dear.

470
00:26:56,690 --> 00:26:57,620
Starting today,

471
00:26:58,170 --> 00:26:59,050
you all are slaves

472
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:00,780
of the Northern Mountain Mine.

473
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,160
Your only task

474
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:05,150
is to dig up bloodstones for the Immortal Clan.

475
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:06,150
Remember,

476
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:08,770
mining bloodstones for the Immortal Clan

477
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:09,940
is your honor

478
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:11,610
and your mission.

479
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,700
Why should I take the lead?

480
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:15,980
Because I believe

481
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:16,860
that one day, the human race

482
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,210
will reach that place.

483
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:19,530
We will

484
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:23,460
personally tell the King of Immortals

485
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:24,590
that the human race

486
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:27,860
will no longer be their slaves.

487
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:31,780
No!

488
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:33,040
I don't want to be a slave!

489
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,440
I don't want to be a slave!

490
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,110
I don't want to be here!

491
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,160
Murder! Murder!

492
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,180
Did you all see that?

493
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:44,410
That is the consequence

494
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:47,660
of betraying the Immortal Clan and trying to escape.

495
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:50,330
What you must do here

496
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:52,820
is to be loyal to Mr. Chen Jing

497
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,980
and serve the Immortal Clan!

498
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:56,730
Be loyal to Mr. Chen Jing

499
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:58,170
and serve the Immortal Clan!

500
00:27:58,170 --> 00:27:59,690
Be loyal to Mr. Chen Jing

501
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:01,130
and serve the Immortal Clan!

502
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:02,420
Say it.

503
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,760
Say it!

504
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:06,910
Hurry and say it!

505
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:09,250
Say it!

506
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,490
Hurry up.

507
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:12,820
I'm not afraid. I'm not afraid. I can do it.

508
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:14,370
Hurry up.

509
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:15,570
Line up and go.

510
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:16,700
Hurry up.

511
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,410
Hurry up. That way.

512
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:19,810
What are you waiting for?

513
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:20,810
Move forward. Hurry.

514
00:28:20,810 --> 00:28:21,930
Walk forward.

515
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:23,930
Hurry up.

516
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:26,650
Stop dawdling. Hurry up.

517
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:27,890
Don't dawdle. Line up.

518
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:28,940
Hurry up. Get in line.

519
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,540
Hurry up. Don't fall behind.

520
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:33,660
Hurry up. Move forward.

521
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:34,540
Get in line.

522
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:35,130
Go!

523
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,450
Hurry up!

524
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:37,870
Behave yourselves!

525
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:39,260
Listen up.

526
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:42,090
I'm the centurion here.

527
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:43,290
My surname is Cai.

528
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:45,660
You newcomers

529
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:47,330
need to get branded here.

530
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:49,180
You can

531
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:53,340
only go inside after getting branded.

532
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:57,420
Let's begin.

533
00:28:58,770 --> 00:28:59,770
Behave yourself.

534
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:12,270
What are you looking at?

535
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:14,340
I want to look at the outside world.

536
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:15,200
I don't know

537
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:16,500
if I can see it again.

538
00:29:16,810 --> 00:29:17,900
Take a good look.

539
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:20,500
You might not get the chance again.

540
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:23,570
It looks so painful.

541
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,460
Yes, once we get branded,

542
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:26,290
we'll be slaves of the mine

543
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:27,730
for the rest of our lives.

544
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:29,490
We are human.

545
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:30,810
We're not animals.

546
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:31,680
Father risked his life

547
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,040
to not be a slave of the Immortal Clan.

548
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,120
But now, I...

549
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:36,170
How can I face

550
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:38,090
Father and Mother in the future?

551
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:41,000
I'll go first.

552
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:43,480
Since we're here, it's useless to be afraid.

553
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:44,740
Yang.

554
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:48,410
Come with me.

555
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:50,090
No, no, no.

556
00:29:58,580 --> 00:29:59,770
Are you willing

557
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:01,290
to be slaves here forever?

558
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:02,370
What are you doing this time?

559
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:03,170
I'm not willing!

560
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:03,730
I'm not willing!

561
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:04,660
I'm not willing!

562
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:05,420
Shut up!

563
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:06,740
Go!

564
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:10,050
Rascal, what did you just say?

565
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:10,770
He hit his head.

566
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:11,490
He's a fool.

567
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:12,290
Don't mind him.

568
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:13,370
We'll go get branded now.

569
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:13,930
I won't.

570
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:14,820
Gou!

571
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,220
I don't want to be lackeys

572
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:17,770
of the Immortal Clan like them.

573
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:18,570
What?

574
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,050
Gou, no!

575
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:25,070
Ah...

576
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:28,970
Stand still.

577
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,500
Bai Cai, your sickness is back.

578
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:33,140
Behave yourselves!

579
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:37,330
Let go of me!

580
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,290
You dare to resist?

581
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:51,230
This is the consequence of resisting.

582
00:30:59,140 --> 00:30:59,930
I'll kill you!

583
00:30:59,930 --> 00:31:01,890
Gou, we must survive.

584
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:06,450
Kid, you'll suffer in the future.

585
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:11,130
Listen up.

586
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:12,790
Since you're here,

587
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:14,750
you have to listen to my orders.

588
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,080
See this?

589
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:21,710
I'm a superior slave.

590
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:23,780
I'm different from you all.

591
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:27,530
Listen up, you guys.

592
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:30,530
Even if you toil here forever,

593
00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:32,610
you'll never reach my position.

594
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:34,130
Understand?

595
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:35,450
Hurry up.

596
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:36,250
I'm sorry.

597
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:38,050
It's all my fault.

598
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:39,580
It's not your fault.

599
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:42,550
Since I want to fight back,

600
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:43,570
I'm ready

601
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:45,030
to bear the consequences.

602
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:46,690
But if you want me

603
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:48,020
to be an obedient slave,

604
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:49,890
it's impossible.

605
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,030
Follow closely.

606
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:49,410
Sir, everyone is here.

607
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:50,580
They're here?

608
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,090
Do you see the big bell up there?

609
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:57,260
From now on,

610
00:32:57,890 --> 00:32:59,930
you must listen to the bell

611
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:02,140
for when to mine, eat, and rest.

612
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:03,490
You must meet

613
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:05,090
the daily bloodstone quota.

614
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,570
Otherwise, you can't rest

615
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:08,010
or eat.

616
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:09,770
See that side?

617
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:11,920
They didn't dig enough today.

618
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:13,970
The others are resting,

619
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:15,500
but they still need to work.

620
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:17,660
Alright. Hurry up and get started.

621
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,080
Take it.

622
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,210
Hurry up. Take it yourself.

623
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:26,010
Hurry up.

624
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:27,750
It's already night.

625
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:29,740
We travelled a long way here.

626
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:31,260
You're making us dig without even giving us

627
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:32,890
a chance to catch our breaths.

628
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:34,490
Brat, it's you again?

629
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,300
Where do you think this is?

630
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:38,690
You want to catch your breath?

631
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:39,810
If you can't finish your work,

632
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:41,940
you won't be able to breathe tomorrow.

633
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:43,970
Stop talking nonsense.

634
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:44,900
Hurry up and dig.

635
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,290
Little girl,

636
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:56,770
why are you so thin?

637
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,200
How about I get you something to eat?

638
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:02,620
Don't be shy, little girl.

639
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:04,010
If you need anything,

640
00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:05,700
just tell me.

641
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:07,490
What are you doing?

642
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:08,690
This is my wife.

643
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:10,780
No need to bother you with this.

644
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:12,860
Yes, thank you for your concern.

645
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:13,489
If anything happens,

646
00:34:13,489 --> 00:34:14,820
my husband will help me.

647
00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:18,469
What are you looking at?

648
00:34:18,469 --> 00:34:19,290
What are you looking at?

649
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:20,199
Go to work.

650
00:34:21,170 --> 00:34:21,780
Go.

651
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:22,929
Work hard.

652
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:23,889
Hurry up.

653
00:34:24,449 --> 00:34:25,250
Go inside.

654
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:27,060
Did you not eat? Hurry up!

655
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:28,940
Hurry up.

656
00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:30,260
What are you waiting for?

657
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:31,219
Get to work.

658
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:32,100
Hurry up.

659
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,730
Hurry up.

660
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:34,570
Keep up.

661
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:36,100
Get inside. Stop dawdling.

662
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:36,889
Hurry up.

663
00:34:36,889 --> 00:34:37,420
Move!

664
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:38,210
Get inside.

665
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:38,969
Hurry!

666
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:42,050
Hurry up. Keep up.

667
00:34:42,969 --> 00:34:43,780
Move forward.

668
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:45,010
Hurry up. Keep up.

669
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:16,260
The Immortal Clan is forcing the human race to work

670
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:17,690
for these bloodstones.

671
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,240
But what's the use

672
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:20,850
of these bloodstones?

673
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:23,380
What are you looking at?

674
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:24,370
Get to work.

675
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:25,940
Do you want a beating?

676
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:28,090
Work harder.

677
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:29,410
Hurry up.

678
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:34,690
You haven't recovered yet

679
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:36,410
and you haven't eaten anything all day.

680
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:37,210
Stop digging.

681
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:41,480
But if I don't reach the quota,

682
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:43,060
I won't have food to eat.

683
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:52,730
Don't slack off.

684
00:35:54,490 --> 00:35:55,750
Aren't you all hungry?

685
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:00,070
Get to work. Don't dawdle.

686
00:36:01,370 --> 00:36:02,170
Work hard.

687
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:06,250
Did you not eat?

688
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:11,820
We had a long journey here

689
00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:13,850
and haven't eaten anything all day.

690
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:14,940
Can you let everyone

691
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,250
eat before working?

692
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:18,250
You're just a slave,

693
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:19,770
but you talk quite big.

694
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:22,820
Are you here to make decisions for me?

695
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:23,780
We are human,

696
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:25,410
not animals.

697
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:27,250
Humans all have dignity.

698
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,030
I just can't stand dogs like you

699
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:30,850
who think you're above others.

700
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,150
Not bad. You've got guts.

701
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:37,700
Since you're all

702
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,040
humans with dignity,

703
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:42,150
I guess you won't eat food handed out in contempt.

704
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:43,260
In that case,

705
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:45,830
today's food will be reduced by half.

706
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:48,580
All of you,

707
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:51,690
come and thank this boy

708
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:54,850
who is full of justice and refuses to be a dog.

709
00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:56,820
Gou.

710
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:57,530
Gou.

711
00:36:58,410 --> 00:36:59,610
Stop talking.

712
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:00,720
Do you have to make everyone

713
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,450
starve with you before you stop?

714
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:03,150
Get to work.

715
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:04,410
Alright, let's go.

716
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:05,210
Let's go.

717
00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:09,900
Hurry up.

718
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:11,570
Sir,

719
00:37:12,370 --> 00:37:14,230
should we teach this guy a lesson?

720
00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:15,570
No hurry.

721
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:17,700
If he wants to suffer,

722
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:21,540
I have more than enough hardships

723
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:22,800
for him to experience.

724
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:10,060
Stop digging.

725
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:12,090
Your hand is bleeding.

726
00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:13,010
It's nothing.

727
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:13,940
I dig fast.

728
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:15,470
Take a rest if you're tired.

729
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,040
Go and rest. I'll do it.

730
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:28,410
Time to eat!

731
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:30,620
It's time to eat?

732
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:31,790
It's time to eat.

733
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:33,210
Gou, let's go eat.

734
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:34,780
Let's go eat.

735
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:37,630
Aren't you going to eat?

736
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:41,450
Come on, Gou. Let's eat first.

737
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,080
Let's go.

738
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:44,390
Let's eat first.

739
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:45,220
Let's go.

740
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:46,570
Time to eat.

741
00:38:55,770 --> 00:38:56,940
Time to eat!

742
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:00,410
Don't fight.

743
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:03,100
I got here first.

744
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,150
It's mine.

745
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:11,420
How can we squeeze through?

746
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:12,710
How about this?

747
00:39:12,970 --> 00:39:14,050
Push me from behind.

748
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:14,930
Build up force for me

749
00:39:14,930 --> 00:39:15,570
and I'll rush over.

750
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:15,930
Okay.

751
00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:17,250
Come, count three, two, one and I'll go.

752
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:19,250
Come. One, two, three.

753
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:22,900
Move!

754
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:24,730
Hurry up. Take it.

755
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:25,730
Hurry and take it.

756
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:26,890
Hurry.

757
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:34,730
Bai Cai, hurry.

758
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:37,500
It's delicious.

759
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:38,860
Eat up.
