00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:39,350
Bai Cai.

5
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:41,390
I'll try to stall them.

6
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:42,729
Once there is a chance,

7
00:01:42,789 --> 00:01:43,910
run to the tunnel.

8
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,060
Do you think I'd leave

9
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,470
you and escape on my own?

10
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:51,630
Fine.

11
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:53,890
Let's move forward together.

12
00:02:30,829 --> 00:02:31,850
Gou!

13
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,890
Gou!

14
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:58,140
Gou.

15
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:32,790
I want to see

16
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,240
how long it takes

17
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:38,780
to corrode your bones and blood.

18
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:52,560
Gou!

19
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:01,950
Are you in pain?

20
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:05,330
Just scream if you're in pain.

21
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:08,000
Scream as much as you want.

22
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:12,360
Enjoy your last moments.

23
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:22,200
So comfortable!

24
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:26,230
Immortal Gui Mu.

25
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,080
This is so comfortable.

26
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,130
Didn't you say

27
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:36,030
you would cut me into pieces?

28
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:39,760
What? Is this all you've got?

29
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:50,310
Go ahead, keep pretending.

30
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:01,100
Immortal!

31
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:04,190
Immortal.

32
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:06,900
Please show mercy.

33
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:09,660
I just remembered

34
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:11,670
I have something to say.

35
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:13,190
What?

36
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:16,520
Are you begging for mercy already?

37
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:26,830
Immortal.

38
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:29,470
There is something

39
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:32,430
I have to tell you before I die.

40
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:34,810
Otherwise, I won't rest in peace.

41
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:36,170
Fine.

42
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:39,220
I'd like to see what a slave like you

43
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,159
could tell me.

44
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:01,840
Back then,

45
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:03,490
Xin King

46
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,730
beat you into a pulp.

47
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:08,070
It was such an awesome sight.

48
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,060
Let's go.

49
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:28,230
I'll tear you into pieces!

50
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:28,950
Watch out!

51
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:08,280
-Young Master.
-Zhazha.

52
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,070
Where are you?

53
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:10,870
Young Master!

54
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:12,210
Zhazha!

55
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:13,510
Report!

56
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:14,780
We found no trace of Young Master

57
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,430
in the forest southeast of the mine.

58
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:17,270
Keep searching!

59
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:17,940
Yes.

60
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:19,290
Zhazha!

61
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:21,030
We've searched the barracks,

62
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:23,230
but we still couldn't find Young Master.

63
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:24,840
Keep searching!

64
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:26,680
Bad news, Sir!

65
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:27,770
Immortal Gui Mu...

66
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:28,940
He ate people!

67
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,190
What did you say?

68
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:31,530
I heard it with my own ears.

69
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:32,570
In the secret room of the pharmacy.

70
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:33,390
Immortal Gui Mu...

71
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:34,670
He ate a living person.

72
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:37,610
No, no, no.

73
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:39,150
Zhazha!

74
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:03,940
Gui Mu!

75
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:07,020
Chen Jing.

76
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:09,880
What do you want?

77
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:12,390
Don't get in my way.

78
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,890
Let me ask you.

79
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,790
Weren't you resting in the pharmacy?

80
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:17,430
Why are you here?

81
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,810
You're asking me?

82
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:21,660
You have two wicked sons.

83
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:24,180
Now you need me

84
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,040
to clean up your mess.

85
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:27,940
Isn't it embarrassing?

86
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:30,750
Mr. Chen, please uphold justice for us.

87
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:33,080
I didn't mean to offend the Immortal Clan.

88
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:34,809
But I can’t stand by

89
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:36,110
and watch my wife

90
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,789
get eaten alive.

91
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:38,789
Sir.

92
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:40,490
I was working in the mine today

93
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:41,990
when I was suddenly caught by Prince Zhou Qiao's guards

94
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:43,270
and sent to the secret room of the pharmacy.

95
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:44,260
They wanted to offer me

96
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:46,320
to Immortal Gui Mu to heal his wounds.

97
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:48,190
If Gou hadn't arrived in time...

98
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:48,910
Sir.

99
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:51,430
Gui Mu not only wanted to eat my wife,

100
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:52,230
he also...

101
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:53,830
What else?

102
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:56,070
He also ate Young Master Zhazha.

103
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:57,130
What?

104
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:00,670
Are you serious?

105
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:02,640
I saw it with my own eyes.

106
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,430
The red beads

107
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:04,340
Young Master Zhazha

108
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,380
always carried with him

109
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,720
is with Gui Mu right now.

110
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:08,590
Gui Mu!

111
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,040
Where is my son?

112
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:14,620
You're the father,

113
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:16,270
but you're asking me?

114
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:18,130
Let me ask you again.

115
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:21,250
Did you eat my son?

116
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:28,380
I...

117
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:31,790
Ate him.

118
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:58,020
Chen Jing.

119
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:01,980
How dare you attack me?

120
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:05,060
Do you want to break your promise?

121
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:07,190
My son, Zhazha...

122
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:14,830
I keep tolerating things.

123
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:18,470
But my only son

124
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:20,880
still couldn't escape

125
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:22,400
from you.

126
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:25,360
Immortal Clan!

127
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,500
You have gone too far!

128
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:30,300
Poison Claw!

129
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:34,380
Golden Warrior Spirit!

130
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:35,630
Chen Jing finally stopped

131
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:37,360
tolerating the Immortal Clan.

132
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:02,670
Godfather!

133
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:03,400
Let's go.

134
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:04,980
Chen Jing, stop!

135
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:06,790
I know where Zhazha is.

136
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:08,990
Zhazha is still alive?

137
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:09,950
Where is he?

138
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:10,670
We have all fallen

139
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,750
into Gou's trap.

140
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:13,450
Someone just reported

141
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:14,640
finding a secret tunnel

142
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,510
under the mine, leading to the outside world.

143
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:17,390
Who else would do that

144
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:18,710
except for that brat?

145
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,460
The missing people in the mine

146
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,190
must have been taken out by him.

147
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:23,690
I don't want to hear these.

148
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,330
Tell me where Zhazha is!

149
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:26,290
Listen to me.

150
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:27,860
He must be using Zhazha

151
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:29,070
to sow discord among us

152
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:30,530
and let us kill each other.

153
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,230
Haven't you ever considered that

154
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:33,690
Gou might have pretended to be a human-eating monster

155
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:34,950
and kidnapped Zhazha?

156
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:37,590
This way, he could confuse and threaten us.

157
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,850
Chen Jing, you fell into the trap

158
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,310
because you were worried and lost your composure.

159
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:42,150
In my opinion,

160
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:44,240
Zhazha must still be with him.

161
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,820
Aren't you the one who instigated things?

162
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,620
He must still be alive right now.

163
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,390
If we let Gou escape,

164
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:51,490
we won't know if Zhazha will live.

165
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:54,200
Gou.

166
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:58,040
Gou!

167
00:11:58,390 --> 00:11:59,370
Qiao.

168
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:01,790
You're right.

169
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,230
That Gou

170
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:07,050
is indeed the Prince of Xin.

171
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:10,940
But...

172
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:13,710
But where did he get the Immortal Clan's

173
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:15,790
curse mark on his body?

174
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,030
Take him down.

175
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,440
Yes.

176
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:32,380
Gou!

177
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:35,920
Gou!

178
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:43,610
Gou, how dare you lie to me?

179
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:45,790
Tell me, where is Zhazha?

180
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:47,510
Zhazha is still alive.

181
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:48,650
As long as you let us go,

182
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:49,650
I'll tell you.

183
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:50,510
Otherwise,

184
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:51,730
you will never see him again.

185
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:53,240
Zhazha is my bottom line.

186
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:55,990
You're asking for death.

187
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,820
Don't blame me.

188
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:00,990
How does it feel

189
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:02,790
to be fooled by

190
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:05,110
your own slave?

191
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:10,170
Gou!

192
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:14,940
Tell me! Where is Zhazha?

193
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:17,300
Or I'll make your life miserable.

194
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:18,730
Why bother?

195
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:31,230
As long as we chop off this girl's limbs,

196
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:33,110
he will tell us.

197
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,240
Zhou Qiao!

198
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:41,640
Which arm should I start with?

199
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:43,790
I'm just a slave,

200
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:45,110
I didn't expect you

201
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:46,960
to personally tend to me, Prince Zhou.

202
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,620
Kill me if you dare!

203
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:51,340
What? You don't dare to do it?

204
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:52,670
That's right.

205
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:54,710
You're just a monster

206
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:56,550
who calls an evil man your father, steals people's homes,

207
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:57,790
and harms the populace!

208
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:58,630
You coward!

209
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:03,270
Bai Cai!

210
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:12,980
Gou!

211
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,600
If you want to die, I'll grant your wish.

212
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:19,990
Go to hell!

213
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,450
-Gou!
-Zhou Qiao!

214
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:01,310
Gou!

215
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:03,030
Catch them all!

216
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:09,130
Mr. Chen.

217
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:11,400
The management of your mine

218
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:15,070
sure is something.

219
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,510
Gou, are you okay?

220
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:23,120
I'm fine.

221
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:29,390
We can leave

222
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:31,250
once we pass through this tunnel.

223
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:35,040
Let's go, Bigfoot Monster.

224
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:37,640
You mean we should split up?

225
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,630
It's good to split up.

226
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:39,790
This way, they can't catch us in one go.

227
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:41,770
Bigfoot Monster, you're big.

228
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,710
An underground tunnel will restrict

229
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:43,510
your movements instead.

230
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:44,270
Take care.

231
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:45,570
See you

232
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:46,710
in the sunlight.

233
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:53,470
Let's go.

234
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:02,030
Give it to me.

235
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:15,350
After them! After them!

236
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:46,830
Over there.

237
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:47,510
Go.

238
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:03,690
Shoot!

239
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:25,780
Spear!

240
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:58,020
Bigfoot Monster.

241
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:06,750
Bigfoot Monster.

242
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,550
Don't hurt others

243
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:11,790
for food again.

244
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,140
Bigfoot Monster!

245
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:36,290
Gou.

246
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:38,930
You sure have a lot of tricks up your sleeves.

247
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:41,430
How long did you think

248
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:44,280
a mere beast could stop me?

249
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:46,670
It's not a beast.

250
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:48,490
It's my friend.

251
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:30,150
It's really divine power.

252
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:06,520
Your gaze

253
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,910
is just like that man.

254
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:17,950
The divine power of the Earth Realm.

255
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:21,810
The dead spiritual energy of the underworld.

256
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:30,400
Wild Snake!

257
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:42,150
Gou!

258
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:01,200
Even with the curse mark,

259
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,590
you won't be able to resist

260
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:05,130
my dead spiritual energy.

261
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:07,180
Tell me.

262
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,830
Who gave you the curse mark?

263
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:14,800
Who is it?

264
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:29,050
Gou!

265
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:49,730
Gou!

266
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,280
Gou, are you okay?

267
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:32,070
Gui Mu, oh Gui Mu.

268
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:35,000
The almighty Plague Immortal,

269
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:37,050
reduced to

270
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,840
bullying a kid.

271
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:41,710
You're truly regressing.

272
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:45,470
[Fu Xi]

273
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:44,840
Fu Xi.

274
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:48,230
It's you!

275
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:50,540
Godfather, who is he?

276
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:57,700
He used to be the High Priest of the Immortal realm.

277
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:00,320
He was also my mentor.

278
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:03,070
But his identity now

279
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:06,880
is a traitor wanted by the Immortal Clan.

280
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:09,150
I did betray the Immortal Clan.

281
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,440
But that was because

282
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,240
Hei Long went against the rules.

283
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:14,840
He betrayed the path of justice first.

284
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:16,150
Justice?

285
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:26,970
The Immortal Clan rules over the three realms!

286
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:30,590
We are justice.

287
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:32,710
There's no point in talking.

288
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:34,940
These two kids

289
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,200
have better places to be.

290
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:38,440
No!

291
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:42,920
Gou! Return Zhazha to me!

292
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:00,990
We...

293
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:03,000
Are we free now?

294
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:04,950
Gou.

295
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:09,100
We finally escaped!

296
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:13,710
By the way,

297
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,150
didn't Zhou Qiao

298
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:16,150
stab you just now?

299
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:17,750
How are you fine?

300
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:21,400
It's all thanks to this.

301
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:27,480
The heart-protecting mirror.

302
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:29,630
Thank you, Bai Cai.

303
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:55,520
[Lan]

304
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:59,110
Are you Gou?

305
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:02,350
I'm here to pick you up.

306
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:03,150
Come up.

307
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:05,870
Who are you?

308
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:15,570
Gou!

309
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:19,610
Gou.

310
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:23,310
Who are you?

311
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:24,640
Why should I go with you?

312
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:25,830
I told you

313
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:27,350
I'm here to pick you up.

314
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:28,530
I won't leave with you

315
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:29,990
if you don't make it clear.

316
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:31,110
Besides,

317
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,590
to save us,

318
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:34,730
Old Man is still in the back mountain.

319
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:36,230
He will be fine.

320
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,400
But you are

321
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:38,510
so troublesome.

322
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:39,910
We Shenyin Clan

323
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:41,680
should have stayed out of this.

324
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:42,710
Shenyin Clan?

325
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:44,710
You know Old Man?

326
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:52,250
Gou, wait for me!

327
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:53,540
I can go with you.

328
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:54,980
Take my friend with you.

329
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:55,950
So troublesome.

330
00:25:58,310 --> 00:25:59,370
Gou!

331
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:39,270
Why are you lighting the oil lamp

332
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:40,510
in broad daylight?

333
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:42,200
This is not an oil lamp.

334
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,860
This is Dragon Whale Incense.

335
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:45,110
After lighting it,

336
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,540
no matter how far it is,

337
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:48,350
the High Priest will find us.

338
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,500
Old Man.

339
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:17,030
Old Man.

340
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:18,550
Did Gui Mu hurt you?

341
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,950
Gui Mu's just a small fry,

342
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:22,310
he couldn't hurt me.

343
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:24,710
Let me check your wound.

344
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:38,540
Good for you.

345
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:40,230
You promised to be

346
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:41,560
a good slave in the mine.

347
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:43,230
You did what you promised.

348
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:44,350
Old Man,

349
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:46,030
you once saved me.

350
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,420
How could I break my promise

351
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:48,860
to my savior?

352
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:51,370
You're a good student.

353
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:53,790
Although you haven't been in the mine for long,

354
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:56,030
you've grown a lot.

355
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:59,950
Now that you're out of the mine,

356
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:01,710
what's your plan?

357
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,270
I want to be strong.

358
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:16,390
I want to be strong enough to fight Hei Long.

359
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:21,870
Good, you have guts.

360
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:24,250
Are you willing

361
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:26,370
to join the Shenyin Clan

362
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:28,750
and train with me?

363
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:31,150
Old Man.

364
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:32,600
You saved Bai Cai and me

365
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,770
from danger.

366
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:36,050
I shouldn't suspect anything of you.

367
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:38,060
But I still have some questions.

368
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:39,650
It's good to be cautious.

369
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:40,950
Go ahead.

370
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:43,350
In the mine,

371
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:44,180
you appeared as

372
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,540
an ordinary slave.

373
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:46,790
But just now,

374
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:47,790
Gui Mu said

375
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:50,590
you were once the High Priest of the Immortal Clan.

376
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,830
Who exactly are you?

377
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,710
He's right.

378
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:58,180
I was once

379
00:28:58,220 --> 00:28:59,760
the High Priest of the Immortal Clan.

380
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,580
I couldn't stand

381
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:02,100
what Hei Long did.

382
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:02,900
So I gathered

383
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,060
some comrades

384
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:05,790
and defected from the Immortal Clan.

385
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:07,990
Then, we established the Shenyin Clan.

386
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:09,470
And now,

387
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:13,230
I'm the High Priest of the Shenyin Clan.

388
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:15,910
You once said in the mine that

389
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:17,050
you came for me.

390
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:19,270
I want to know the reason.

391
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:20,390
Gou.

392
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:23,910
You are wise and courageous.

393
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:26,390
You can tolerate

394
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:28,310
and can do what others cannot.

395
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:29,630
I know

396
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:32,520
you have ambitions.

397
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,840
Just like you,

398
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:36,070
I want to defeat Hei Long

399
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:38,000
for the equality of all beings.

400
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,510
So I had to go to the mine

401
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:42,740
to see for myself

402
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:44,470
if you can shoulder

403
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:45,730
this responsibility.

404
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:48,920
Of course,

405
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:52,350
if you choose this path,

406
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:54,270
you will face

407
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:55,550
the greatest enemy

408
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:57,030
in this world.

409
00:29:57,950 --> 00:29:59,920
You will face countless dangers

410
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:02,070
and you might die at any time.

411
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:07,550
Gou.

412
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:09,950
I don't want you to die.

413
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:12,870
It's easy if you don't want to die.

414
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:14,510
Gou.

415
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,830
I know you've suffered a lot.

416
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:19,230
You can go back to the mortal world

417
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:20,310
with Bai Cai

418
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,890
and become an ordinary person.

419
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:25,350
With the Fire of Chaos,

420
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:27,190
you can live a peaceful life.

421
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:31,230
Bai Cai.

422
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:33,190
Although we saved

423
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:34,710
many miners this time,

424
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:36,430
as long as the Immortal Clan

425
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:37,830
and Hei Long still exist,

426
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:39,070
countless people

427
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:40,730
will be sent to the mine again.

428
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:42,630
I don't want anyone else

429
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,320
to go through all this again.

430
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:47,590
Okay.

431
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:48,710
No matter what you do,

432
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:49,740
I'll support you.

433
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:52,070
But don't leave me.

434
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:02,870
Old Man, I've made up my mind.

435
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:04,400
I want to join the Shenyin Clan

436
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,230
and train with you.

437
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:12,070
Okay, get up.

438
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:14,030
That's the look.

439
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:31,110
Old Man.

440
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,100
Her too.

441
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:35,310
Do you want to join the Shenyin Clan too?

442
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:37,550
I want to be with Gou.

443
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:39,070
I'll do whatever he does.

444
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:40,670
Lan.

445
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:42,150
What do you think?

446
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:43,590
An ordinary person

447
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:44,590
who can't do anything

448
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:46,450
shouldn't join the Shenyin Clan.

449
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,590
Who says I can't do anything?

450
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:50,310
Besides, I can learn if I can't.

451
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:51,910
Were you born capable of everything?

452
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,310
Regardless, I disagree.

453
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:55,150
If the High Priest

454
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:56,760
insists on taking her back,

455
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:58,360
her survivability will

456
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:00,870
depend on her fate.

457
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:03,630
Don't regret it.

458
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:06,310
I'll go forward with Gou.

459
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:07,430
I won't regret it.

460
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:11,740
I like

461
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:13,070
your attitude.

462
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:14,990
Come on.

463
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:27,030
My mark is gone too.

464
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:32,390
I want this mark

465
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:34,400
to disappear forever.

466
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,340
Zhazha...

467
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:48,990
Zhazha...

468
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:51,830
Father.

469
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:54,330
Father!

470
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:57,260
Father!

471
00:32:58,390 --> 00:32:59,190
Zhazha?

472
00:33:00,390 --> 00:33:01,590
-Zhazha...
-Father!

473
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:04,380
-Father.
-Zhazha.

474
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:12,230
-Father!
-Zhazha!

475
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:15,420
-Father!
-Zhazha!

476
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,870
Zhazha!

477
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:21,130
Father.

478
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:22,760
Zhazha.

479
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:28,590
-Father!
-My son!

480
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,680
-Father!
-I missed you so much.

481
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:33,870
You are still alive.

482
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:36,200
Still alive!

483
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:41,310
Father.

484
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:44,510
Zhazha, hurry.

485
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:46,430
Let me see.

486
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:47,710
Let me see.

487
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:48,970
Are you hurt?

488
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:50,830
Are you hurt anywhere?

489
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:52,630
Father, I'm fine.

490
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:53,570
See?

491
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:55,990
See? Everything is fine.

492
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:59,590
Great.

493
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:00,440
Zhazha.

494
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:03,870
You scared me to death.

495
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:10,469
Zhazha, don't worry.

496
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:12,070
I will

497
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:13,429
catch Gou.

498
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:14,500
After that,

499
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,590
I will kill him

500
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:16,719
and vent your anger.

501
00:34:17,909 --> 00:34:18,389
Father.

502
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:21,260
Please don't kill Brother Gou.

503
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:22,909
What’s wrong?

504
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:23,870
Father.

505
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:26,230
Brother Gou taught me

506
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:28,030
how to be a good person.

507
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:30,020
Before this,

508
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:31,870
I made many mistakes

509
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:35,070
and I was not filial enough.

510
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:36,590
Please forgive me.

511
00:34:39,949 --> 00:34:40,830
Okay.

512
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:42,780
Good.

513
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:44,909
My son.

514
00:34:44,909 --> 00:34:46,350
You've grown up.

515
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:47,830
You've grown up.

516
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:52,590
In the end,

517
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,190
I still underestimated Gou.

518
00:34:54,949 --> 00:34:55,850
I didn't expect that

519
00:34:55,850 --> 00:34:57,850
even the mischievous Zhazha

520
00:34:58,310 --> 00:34:59,790
listens to him now.

521
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:06,840
[Shenyin Village]

522
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:08,440
Wait for me! Hurry!

523
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:19,990
Come on.

524
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:25,030
Hurry up.

525
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:49,270
Come closer.

526
00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:51,590
High Priest.

527
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:52,710
Great!

528
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:53,990
Great!

529
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:57,790
High Priest.

530
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:01,840
Such beautiful houses.

531
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:05,740
Look, over there.

532
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:08,240
That is the meeting hall of the Shenyin Clan.

533
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:14,700
Let's go to the training ground first.

534
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:19,910
Greetings, High Priest.

535
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:20,590
Hello.

536
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:21,350
Hello.

537
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:22,390
Good day, High Priest.

538
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:23,590
Okay, go back to work.

539
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:24,390
Greetings, High Priest.

540
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,390
High Priest.

541
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:26,520
Hello, High Priest.

542
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:29,520
Let's go play.

543
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:59,180
Work harder.

544
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:13,070
[Zi Dian]

545
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,550
This is the training ground.

546
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:15,270
Lan!

547
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:17,630
You're back.

548
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:19,450
Young people in the village

549
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:20,630
will receive training here

550
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:21,590
every day.

551
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:24,150
And from tomorrow onwards,

552
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:26,350
you will receive training here as well.

553
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:28,550
Lan risked her life

554
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:29,680
to leave the village

555
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:31,230
for

556
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:34,060
you, a mere human.

557
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,070
Let's go.

558
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:41,970
Let's go to your rooms.

559
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:47,790
Get up!

560
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:58,480
Gou.

561
00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:00,790
You'll live here from now on.

562
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:02,870
Bai Cai,

563
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:04,950
that's your place.

564
00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:06,970
Thank you, Old Man.

565
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:08,030
Let's go.

566
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,180
Gou,

567
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,870
this is my place.

568
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:19,670
I've informed Clan Leader Kong Que

569
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:21,160
to bring all the elders

570
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,320
to my place.

571
00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:23,870
You can get familiar

572
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:24,800
with each other.

573
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:25,550
After all,

574
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:26,870
we'll be a family.

575
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:29,510
Please wait for a moment.
