00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:38,060
[Episode 30]

4
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:40,910
I will remember all of you.

5
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:43,830
I'll be somewhere distant,

6
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:46,360
watching you suffer from constant struggle,

7
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:47,840
despair,

8
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:49,950
and death.

9
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:02,670
Shi Xing!

10
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:07,230
Why did you stop me?

11
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:11,240
They have returned to the Immortal Realm.

12
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,430
Maybe you alone are able

13
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:15,270
to kill Xinyue Kui,

14
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:16,750
but there's no way you can

15
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,610
leave the Immortal Realm safely.

16
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:23,430
I thought

17
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:24,870
we would certainly win,

18
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:26,610
but I didn't expect

19
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,670
that in the Immortal Realm,

20
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:28,990
some grand immortals could be hundreds of times

21
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:32,050
stronger than the leading immortals of the six tribes.

22
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:34,670
Shi Xing,

23
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:36,910
our anti-immortal journey

24
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:38,150
has just begun.

25
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:42,610
A great cause can easily be ruined by a touch of impatience.

26
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:44,670
That's right.

27
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:45,990
We've made plans

28
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:47,630
to conquer the Immortal Realm.

29
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:49,430
We must avoid reckless actions.

30
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:51,630
Fine.

31
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,630
Since I've decided

32
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:55,110
to be your ally,

33
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,470
I'll take your advice.

34
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:41,470
Heroes, I'm late.

35
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,260
Sorry to keep you waiting!

36
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:44,829
The battle in Bai State

37
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,670
went pretty well.

38
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,630
This combat was indeed

39
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,550
unprecedented and phenomenal.

40
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:53,590
His Majesty especially asked us

41
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:54,829
to hold a banquet tonight

42
00:03:54,829 --> 00:03:57,430
to celebrate victory with you heroes.

43
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,430
It isn't necessary.

44
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,700
It's true that we've defeated

45
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,190
the six tribes of the Immortal Realm,

46
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:04,190
but their leaders, in where they're from,

47
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:06,190
aren't the most prominent figures.

48
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:07,880
Our little accomplishment

49
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:09,480
isn't exactly remarkable.

50
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:14,430
Wu Geng,

51
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:15,950
though the great sages

52
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:17,350
are real menaces,

53
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:19,680
you're not fighting alone.

54
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:20,990
You're supported

55
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:22,910
by us, the entire Demon Clan.

56
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,120
And us, Shenyin Clan.

57
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,190
That's right. The whole Shenyin Clan

58
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:31,630
would stand alongside you on the battlefield.

59
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:32,490
Your Highness,

60
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:35,110
we are weak,

61
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:37,550
but for the sake of the people,

62
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:39,270
we're ready to make sacrifices,

63
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:40,560
and give up our lives.

64
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:49,530
Having you as my allies

65
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:51,420
is such an honor.

66
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:54,909
I, Wu Geng,

67
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:56,800
promise not to let you down.

68
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,060
Geng,

69
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:08,750
The previous battle was proceeded

70
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:11,350
with deliberation and brilliant strategies.

71
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:12,790
In particular, the fight against the six tribes

72
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:14,790
of the Immortal Realm and Xinyue Kui

73
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:17,510
inflicted severe damage on the Immortal Clan.

74
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:18,750
Geng,

75
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:21,890
have you been injured?

76
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,350
I'm fine, Uncle Ziyu.

77
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,070
Good.

78
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:33,530
As I recall,

79
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:35,350
in the King's City,

80
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,270
you once told me

81
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:39,990
that the way your father and I

82
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:41,510
fought Hei Long

83
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:43,870
let you see hope,

84
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:45,470
and convinced you

85
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:46,810
that immortals

86
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:49,550
were not invincible.

87
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:51,870
And now,

88
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,480
you've also let me see hope.

89
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:59,150
I can tell

90
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,430
that today the sudden appearance of

91
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:05,230
Xuanfeng Great Sage and the White Lotus Great Sage

92
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,150
has brought you

93
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:08,430
new pressure, right?

94
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:10,300
Uncle Ziyu,

95
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:13,470
between the six tribes of the Immortal Realm

96
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:15,110
and the great sages,

97
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:16,310
there's a huge gap,

98
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,230
while the latter and Hei Long

99
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:18,350
are even

100
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:19,950
worlds apart.

101
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:23,470
The battle in Bai capital

102
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:24,670
has made me realize

103
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:26,230
that our fight

104
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:27,690
against the Immortal Clan

105
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:29,550
is much more challenging

106
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,110
than I imagined.

107
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:33,710
It's true.

108
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,170
But the previous battle

109
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:39,630
was a knockout blow to the six tribes of the Immortal Realm,

110
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:42,030
and it greatly weakened the Immortal Clan.

111
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:44,909
Actually, in my opinion,

112
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:48,550
you're way out of everyone else's league

113
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:51,570
in terms of strategies and strength,

114
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,630
because under your leadership,

115
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:57,550
we have achieved

116
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,080
an unprecedented success.

117
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,910
Plus, you've made people

118
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:04,230
feel

119
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,110
convinced, empowered,

120
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:11,070
and hope.

121
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,230
I'm wondering about one thing.

122
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:24,190
Xinyue Kui is a conniving woman.

123
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:25,680
How did you manage to

124
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,070
trap her?

125
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:30,730
I used the Colorless-Realm divine power

126
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:33,190
to interrupt Xinyue Kui's spying on me.

127
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:35,480
In fact, both Wu Geng

128
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:37,310
and Gou are me.

129
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:41,960
My mother used to be a priest in the Immortal Clan.

130
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,770
When I was born,

131
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:46,230
she foresaw the misfortunes in my life,

132
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,230
so she extracted a portion

133
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:48,590
of the benevolent part in my nature,

134
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:50,020
and left it in the mortal world,

135
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,550
which then grew up to be Gou.

136
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,840
After the downfall of Xin State,

137
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:55,630
to cover up what she had done,

138
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:57,230
she recombined

139
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:58,890
me and Gou.

140
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:02,670
That is to say, I'm Gou,

141
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,470
and Gou is me.

142
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:07,990
Bai Cai,

143
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:10,590
actually, in the very beginning,

144
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:12,400
I meant to be upfront with you.

145
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:14,960
But as we spent more time together,

146
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:19,030
I gradually lost the courage to tell you the truth.

147
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:20,670
Why?

148
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:25,830
I was afraid that if I told you the truth,

149
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:28,160
you would chase me away.

150
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:32,950
I trust you,

151
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:35,130
and I won't chase you away.

152
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:36,950
Gou...

153
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:46,690
No. I should

154
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:48,760
call you Wu Geng now, right?

155
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:52,190
Bai Cai,

156
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:53,900
didn't you say

157
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:56,090
no matter what I came out to be,

158
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:57,920
I'd always be your beloved Gou?

159
00:08:58,390 --> 00:08:59,200
So,

160
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,480
you can continue to call me Gou.

161
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:08,610
However,

162
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:12,160
we need to keep things from people for a while.

163
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:15,070
Good.

164
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:18,230
Very good.

165
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:23,550
Geng,

166
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,150
I believe at this moment,

167
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,830
your father and mother

168
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:31,970
must be filled with pride,

169
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,610
as they watch you in heaven.

170
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:43,350
I must defeat Hei Long,

171
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:46,950
as a way to pay respects

172
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:49,450
to my late father and mother.

173
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:55,990
Pause!

174
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:04,400
To better fight the Immortal Clan,

175
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:07,270
we must be vigilant and fully prepared.

176
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:09,030
Shields

177
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:12,360
are used to protect our bodies.

178
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,630
Use the power in your legs,

179
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:18,600
waist and arms at the same time.

180
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:22,290
You must see the shield as an integral part of your body.

181
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:23,470
Got it?

182
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:24,550
Yes!

183
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:27,800
Gather!

184
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:35,990
Assemble!

185
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:42,890
Your Highness,

186
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:45,590
I've let the soldiers pitch tents here,

187
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:47,000
and practice every day.

188
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,440
After training, they've become

189
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:50,710
more skillful.

190
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:52,470
But I'm not sure

191
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,790
if they're strong enough to fight the Immortal Clan.

192
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:55,710
Your Highness,

193
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:56,990
we want your opinion.

194
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:57,780
Yeah, Your Highness!

195
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,620
Will we be able to defeat the Immortal Clan?

196
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:00,820
Yeah, Your Highness!

197
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:03,430
Soldiers,

198
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:05,750
it's true that in one-on-one confrontations,

199
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,590
you're no match for the Immortal Clan.

200
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:09,110
But as long as you play as a team properly,

201
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:10,510
and practice more often,

202
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:12,430
I believe one day,

203
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:15,110
the Immortal Clan won't dare to look down on you.

204
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:16,670
Yeah! Even if we can't make it,

205
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:18,110
we can always count on His Highness!

206
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:18,950
So,

207
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,870
we need to work harder.

208
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:22,950
An enormous number of ants

209
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:24,550
can even kill an elephant!

210
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:25,590
Am I right?

211
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:26,470
Yes!

212
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:29,310
Just now, you said

213
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:31,960
you wanted to defeat Hei Long, didn't you?

214
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:36,430
You're admirably brave.

215
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:39,110
But let me tell you something.

216
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:40,310
In terms of strength,

217
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:41,910
the six immortal tribe leaders are like infants,

218
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,870
while our great sage is like a brawny man.

219
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:44,630
But compared with Hei Long,

220
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:45,990
our great sage is like an ant,

221
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:47,790
while the former is like a giant.

222
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:49,480
I'm not bluffing.

223
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,750
Even if we manage to fight our way through,

224
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:54,810
there will be a lot of deaths and injuries in our troops.

225
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:05,380
Grand Marshal,

226
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:07,750
do you have something

227
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:09,150
to discuss with me?

228
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:11,160
The look on your face

229
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:13,600
tells me you'd also like a discussion.

230
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:17,830
Our military action has a high profile.

231
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,230
It's only a matter of time

232
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:21,560
before the Immortal Clan takes measures.

233
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:23,490
Do you really think

234
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:24,670
we should

235
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:25,830
build a warship

236
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:27,470
to openly launch

237
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:29,830
massive attacks at the Immortal Realm?

238
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:33,070
That's exactly what I'm worried about.

239
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:34,720
Even if we can enter the Immortal Realm,

240
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,920
we'll definitely suffer great losses.

241
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:39,730
So,

242
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:41,390
it will be the best

243
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:44,150
if we can enter the Immortal Realm quietly.

244
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:47,410
Actually, a long time ago,

245
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:48,630
I had an idea.

246
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:50,330
At that time,

247
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:51,870
I was still working in the Northern Mountain Mine

248
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:52,710
as a slave.

249
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:54,670
It wasn't until I became

250
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:56,310
a centurion did I realize

251
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:57,830
that in the mine,

252
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:00,430
there would be several large shipments

253
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:02,230
of bloodstones every year

254
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:04,510
bound for the Immortal Realm by sea.

255
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:06,760
That's when I started thinking

256
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:08,700
if I wanted to go to the Immortal Realm,

257
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:09,710
then hiding in a ship

258
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:11,470
that carried bloodstones

259
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,710
could be a good way to do so

260
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:15,030
without being noticed, right?

261
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:18,840
Given what we're capable of,

262
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,670
it's easy for one person

263
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:21,230
to quietly sneak onto

264
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:22,290
one of those ships.

265
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,670
But it's impossible for so many soldiers

266
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:27,040
to do the same thing.

267
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:29,840
Wu Geng,

268
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:32,230
for each shipment of bloodstones,

269
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:34,910
what's the number and the carrying capacity of the ships?

270
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:35,970
Frankly speaking,

271
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:38,620
there would be quite a lot of ships,

272
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:39,550
but they can't

273
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:42,050
carry the whole anti-immortal army.

274
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:43,900
That said,

275
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:47,630
if the ships are ours...

276
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:51,310
Are you saying...

277
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:52,490
Grand Marshal,

278
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,070
don't say it out yet.

279
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:55,870
Let's write down

280
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:56,750
our ideas,

281
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:58,830
and see if we're on the same page.

282
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:10,710
[Freight]

283
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:13,970
[Freight]

284
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:14,870
That's right.

285
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:16,930
We're gonna build some transport ships

286
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:18,030
that are exactly the same

287
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:19,150
as the bloodstone ships

288
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,820
bound for the Immortal Realm.

289
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:33,350
Ms. Bai Cai, are you tired?

290
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:34,030
Not at all!

291
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:35,500
Let me take it off you.

292
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,230
Thank you.

293
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:40,750
You need a few days' rest.

294
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:41,550
Ms. Bai Cai!

295
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:42,270
Thanks.

296
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:43,310
Come on. Slowly.

297
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:44,070
Kong Que,

298
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:46,520
in these days, the number of patients

299
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,870
is much less than usual.

300
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:49,430
Yes.

301
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:51,640
Everything's getting better.

302
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:54,950
Where is Lan?

303
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,510
Wasn't she here just now?

304
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:02,630
Maybe she hasn't figured out

305
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:04,030
how to behave around you.

306
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:07,630
The high priest demanded that she kill you.

307
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:09,360
She has told me about it.

308
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:12,110
Shenyin Village owes you.

309
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,480
Sorry, Bai Cai.

310
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:14,550
It's okay.

311
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,030
I'm fine now, aren't I?

312
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:18,290
She failed to take my life anyway.

313
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:23,300
No one knows how many lives will be endangered

314
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,760
when we start attacking the Immortal Realm.

315
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:29,410
I hope there won't be too many casualties and injuries.

316
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,730
Kong Que, don't worry.

317
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:31,630
Every day, Gou

318
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,110
spares no effort to train the army.

319
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:33,870
The troops of the human race

320
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:36,400
will definitely grow stronger and stronger.

321
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:39,030
In fact, I know

322
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:41,750
that you're not only worried about the anti-immortal army,

323
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:42,590
but also

324
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:44,550
the innocent civilians in the Immortal Realm,

325
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:45,870
just like how you're concerned

326
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:47,930
about Zhui Ri Grand Immortal, right?

327
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:50,510
Honestly, I'd hate to see

328
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:51,910
casualties and injuries

329
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:53,730
happen on either side.

330
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:57,070
I hope after this battle,

331
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:00,690
there won't be warfare in the world anymore.

332
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:03,320
I believe

333
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:04,510
Gou will

334
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:05,630
make it come true.

335
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,870
Besides, there's one more thing

336
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:11,160
you need to be extra careful about.

337
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:16,230
It's true that the great sages are formidably strong.

338
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:18,190
But I've thought it through.

339
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:20,750
Where there's a will, there's a way.

340
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:23,590
We'll leap over every obstacle as it comes.

341
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:26,550
Now the only thing we can do is to focus on

342
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:27,880
the imminent problems.

343
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:33,030
It's not what I meant to say.

344
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:37,830
I know.

345
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:39,870
You're worried that the Immortal Clan

346
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:41,470
wouldn't easily give up.

347
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:43,030
You're thinking that the army of the human race

348
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:44,660
should find a new hideout.

349
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:46,440
Don't worry.

350
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:48,120
I've already had a plan.

351
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:51,600
What I meant to say is

352
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:54,230
that the White Lotus Great Sage's Earth-Realm divine power

353
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:56,310
is the worst poison in the three realms.

354
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:57,710
When its effects kick in,

355
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:00,160
even immortals can't help with anything.

356
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:03,390
You've never talked about it,

357
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:04,430
but I know

358
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:06,430
that you've been hit by him once.

359
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:08,030
It's a life-threatening issue.

360
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:09,760
You must treat it with caution.

361
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:13,970
I'm fine.

362
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:16,920
All I got was just a minor scratch.

363
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,099
It wouldn't hurt or itch.

364
00:17:18,099 --> 00:17:19,230
Just stop worrying.

365
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:26,230
Don't push yourself so hard.

366
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:27,750
We're different.

367
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:30,390
You still have a whole life ahead of you.

368
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:34,430
I'm heading back to the Demon Realm.

369
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:39,470
If anything comes up,

370
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:40,630
just send me a message

371
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:42,430
via the contact stone I gave you.

372
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:00,470
Shi Xing,

373
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:05,000
Gou said

374
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,230
you and Uncle Ziyu

375
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:07,560
would be leaving today.

376
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:08,910
He asked me to bring you

377
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:10,310
some food before your departure.

378
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:11,030
It occurred to me

379
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:12,020
that back in the King's City,

380
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:12,750
you seemed to enjoy

381
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:13,750
the buns I made,

382
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:15,710
so I brought you some.

383
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,480
Wu Geng is indeed different from before.

384
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:25,680
When he awoke me in the Demon Realm,

385
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:27,670
I already felt

386
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:29,230
that there's boundless energy

387
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:30,270
hidden in him.

388
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,950
In the battle in Bai capital,

389
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:35,030
he showed both intelligence and bravery.

390
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,470
In such a short time,

391
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:39,630
he has miraculously organized an anti-immortal army

392
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:42,820
consisting of Shenyin Clan, Demon Clan and the human race.

393
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:45,550
He has even used Xinyue Kui's scheme against her.

394
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:48,270
In the past 100 thousand years,

395
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:51,550
the Immortal Clan has never suffered such a huge setback.

396
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:53,480
My beloved Gou is no doubt amazing.

397
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:56,510
Perhaps in the future,

398
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:58,980
he can really overthrow the Immortal King.

399
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:01,830
But before that,

400
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:04,340
there is another thing I'm concerned about.

401
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:06,630
It's relevant to you.

402
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:08,380
Me?

403
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:22,030
Uncle Ziyu,

404
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:24,350
when will you return

405
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:26,410
from the Illusion Island?

406
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:27,550
Don't worry.

407
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:29,750
The agreement between us

408
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:31,480
will remain valid forever.

409
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:34,670
If I need you...

410
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:39,470
Wherever I am,

411
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:42,340
I'll show up in time.

412
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:11,750
Shi Xing, you're leaving too?

413
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,650
The day the anti-immortal battle begins

414
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:31,090
will be the day we reunite.

415
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:42,150
Gou.

416
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:46,330
What's wrong, Gou?

417
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,270
You're upset about parting with

418
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:51,000
Shi Xing and Uncle Ziyu, right?

419
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:52,880
No.

420
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:56,520
Gou, something must be bothering you.

421
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:57,700
I'm all fine.

422
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,280
Don't keep secrets from me.

423
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:02,870
The departure of Shi Xing

424
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:05,400
and Uncle Ziyu is indeed bugging me, alright?

425
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,630
When we start striking at the Immortal Realm,

426
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:09,630
they'll come back to be with us, won't they?

427
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:10,910
If we win,

428
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:12,420
we'll see them more often.

429
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:14,620
[Gongchen Gate]

430
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:14,590
Yes.

431
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:16,740
After all, when we get married,

432
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:18,870
I'll invite them over for our wedding.

433
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:22,930
Have I agreed to marry you?

434
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,500
Gou?

435
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,470
Gou, what's going on with you?

436
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:30,270
Gou?

437
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,340
Gou! Gou!

438
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:36,500
Gou!

439
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:38,240
Gou!

440
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:40,700
Gou, what happened to you?

441
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:27,110
The White Lotus Great Sage's Earth-Realm divine power

442
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:28,990
is the most overwhelming in the three realms.

443
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:30,550
His Nine Voids Blood Lotus Pool

444
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:31,680
is highly toxic.

445
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:34,250
Even I can't do anything about it.

446
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:36,550
Wu Geng must've been poisoned

447
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:37,750
as a result of a sneak attack launched

448
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:38,950
by the White Lotus Great Sage

449
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:40,230
during their wrestle.

450
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:43,030
He should've received treatment days ago.

451
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:45,630
Now the poison has infected his divine spirit.

452
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:49,150
I'll tell the Great Swordsman to come back,

453
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:50,580
and get in contact with the Demon Clan.

454
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:52,430
We'll work out a solution together.

455
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:53,350
It won't work.

456
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:55,910
The Nine Voids Blood Lotus

457
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:58,110
grows in the ancient Crystal Mountain.

458
00:22:58,150 --> 00:22:59,550
The ancient divine power

459
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:01,310
is the only cure for Gou.

460
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:04,410
The ancient divine power?

461
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:23,760
Gou.

462
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:26,510
Gou, would you please wake up?

463
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:27,240
Gou!

464
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:30,790
Gou, wake up.

465
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:32,370
♫Wild geese pass by in the autumn wind♫

466
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:31,870
Gou...

467
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:34,740
♫Leaves know the sky is cold♫

468
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:39,230

♫The moon in the sky is not me♫

♫Fair or unfair, it's all wrong♫

472
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:53,370
♫Life is unpredictable♫

473
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:55,420
♫Forget the evenings; forget the mornings♫

474

♫Laughing at lovers for torturing themselves♫

♫I can see the wind and rain outside the curtain♫

♫It's always been like a dream♫

♫Don't ask why or about the path ahead♫

489

Bai Cai,

490
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:10,830
take a break if you're too tired.

491
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:11,870
No.

492
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:14,030
I must help Gou get better.

493
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:27,320
♫Wild geese pass by in the autumn wind♫

494
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:29,390

♫And grieved over the suffering in the world♫

513
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:37,570
I can't believe he has really gotten better.

514
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:38,830
If this goes on for a few more days,

515
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:40,230
it might really help Gou.

516
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:43,430
Great!

517
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:46,430
Bai Cai,

518
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:48,990
it's gonna be a long haul.

519
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:51,230
Don't put too much strain on yourself.

520
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:54,950
Lan,

521
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:56,690
let's have a word outside.

522
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:10,630
Bai Cai,

523
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:16,850
what do you want to tell me?

524
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:19,230
I need your confirmation

525
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:20,430
on one thing.

526
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:23,230
Without it, I'll feel rather unsettled.

527
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:25,830
I'm all ears.

528
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,190
Did the old man

529
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:29,990
once make

530
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:31,230
a prophecy?

531
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:38,790
There are tons of prophecies made by the old man.

532
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:41,190
Which one are you talking about?

533
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:42,280
Cut it out, Lan.

534
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,270
You're as simple

535
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:44,630
as an open book.

536
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:46,630
You clearly know what I'm talking about,

537
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:48,760
but you're pretending that you don't.

538
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:55,830
When we were in Shenyin Clan,

539
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,830
the old man asked you to kill me.

540
00:27:58,070 --> 00:28:00,270
Was it because he predicted something?

541
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:01,610
What compelled him

542
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:03,490
to make that decision?

543
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:05,550
Also,

544
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:07,550
when you tried to kill me,

545
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:09,210
you said the word "prophecy."

546
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:12,430
Don't tell me that you've forgotten it.

547
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:21,430
I dare not to let my thoughts run wild

548
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:22,910
because I'm scared.

549
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:24,790
You and the old man

550
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:27,230
are kind people who care about all the living souls.

551
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:28,630
If you are to kill me,

552
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:30,670
the reason must be that my existence

553
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:31,630
will jeopardize

554
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:33,750
your whole plan.

555
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:35,030
Am I right?

556
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:38,720
You have to avoid even the slightest risk.

557
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:39,630
For instance,

558
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:43,830
I might hurt Wu Geng.

559
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:52,290
How could it possible for you to hurt him?

560
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:53,850
To save Wu Geng's life,

561
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:55,480
you wouldn't sleep or rest.

562
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:57,550
No one in the world

563
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:59,910
cares more about him than you do.

564
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:02,250
But the old man told you to kill me.

565
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:04,850
It means I'm a threat, doesn't it?

566
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:08,870
Lan,

567
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:11,270
now that our talk has gone this far,

568
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:12,230
can you just tell me

569
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:13,710
the entire truth?

570
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:24,880
The high priest

571
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:27,910
foresaw that a girl

572
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:30,230
attacked Wu Geng,

573
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,190
and

574
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:35,270
threw him into an abyss.

575
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:41,130
The high priest only said

576
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:43,670
that when Wu Geng was being beaten,

577
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:44,870
he didn't fight back.

578
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:47,030
It made him believe

579
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:48,670
that the girl must be close to Wu Geng.

580
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:50,030
Maybe it's not you.

581
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:03,590
Bai Cai,

582
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:07,880
why would you suddenly ask me about these things?

583
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:10,110
Has anything happened recently?

584
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:14,230
Lan,

585
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,950
can I ask you for a favor?

586
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:19,750
Go ahead.

587
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:21,910
If...

588
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:24,300
If one day

589
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,430
I hurt Wu Geng,

590
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:28,830
can you please take my life?

591
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:36,950
Lan,

592
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:39,630
the old man already asked you to kill me.

593
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:42,090
I'm not asking for too big a favor, right?

594
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:44,830
I'm sorry

595
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:47,530
that I'm making the request in such a way.

596
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:48,550
But...

597
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:50,010
Apart from you,

598
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:52,560
I don't know who to turn to for help.

599
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:56,110
Bai Cai,

600
00:30:57,670 --> 00:30:58,990
I should be the one

601
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:00,630
to apologize.

602
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:04,170
I shouldn't have kept the truth from you.

603
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:06,630
I shouldn't have intended to kill you.

604
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:10,430
Bai Cai,

605
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:13,730
I can't bring myself to hurt you anymore.

606
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:16,950
I just can't do it.

607
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:20,120
But I can make a promise.

608
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:24,060
I'll do everything within my power,

609
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:25,870
or even sacrifice my own life,

610
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:26,950
to protect Wu Geng.

611
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:34,870
The two of you

612
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:38,590
should stick together.

613
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:40,430
Don't easily give up.

614
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:43,550
Don't you remember what Wu Geng always says?

615
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:46,430
People can triumph over their fate.

616
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:54,230
Bai Cai,

617
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:57,150
are you hiding something

618
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:58,350
from me?

619
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:00,750
No.

620
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:01,790
I need to go on

621
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:03,270
to help Gou get rid of the poison.

622
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:04,350
As Kong Que said,

623
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:06,030
my power is really helpful.

But before that,

652
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:44,750
there is another thing I'm concerned about.

653
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:45,130
♫In illusions, the world is ever changing♫

654
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,820

♫Life is a prison; my dreams are my horses♫

659
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:52,270
Back in the King's City,

660
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:53,390
I attempted to

661
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:54,230
use your power

662
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,860

♫Come and smell the blossoming flowers of chaos♫

665
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:58,110
I wasn't up to much good.

666
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:01,790
But what happened was beyond my expectations.

667
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:02,990
You actually

668
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:04,630
started repeatedly

669
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:06,030
using your divine power.

670
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:08,150
Don't you know

671
00:34:08,429 --> 00:34:09,960
that before Wu Geng was able to use his divine power,

672
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,790
he had to go through the Divine Activation?

673
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:12,469
In contrast, you are

674
00:34:12,469 --> 00:34:13,670
just a lousy combatant who has never

675
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:16,199
learned the techniques of the Immortal Clan.

676
00:34:16,219 --> 00:34:17,630
How did you get all that

677
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:18,750

try not to use

your divine power again.

702
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:11,150
It's been a day and a night.

703
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:14,080
I wonder if he's getting better.

704
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:26,740
Bai Cai has been outputting her ancient divine power for three days.

705
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:28,030
Can she cope with it?

706
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:31,810
There's nothing we can do now.

707
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:34,710
Our only hope lies in Bai Cai.

708
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:37,950
Gou,

709
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:39,990
you have to wake up.

710
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:42,030
You've promised to

711
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:43,550
restore peace

712
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:44,800
for the people.

713
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:47,550
You've sworn to free the old of suffering,

714
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:49,620
to feed the children,

715
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:51,920
to abolish slavery in the mine,

716
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:53,870
and to relieve people

717
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:56,200
from the oppression of the Immortal Clan.

718
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:58,030
They're all waiting for you,

719
00:35:58,110 --> 00:36:00,180
hoping you to return freedom to the world,

720
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:02,110
and to improve social well-being.

721
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:12,110
Gou,

722
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:15,620
not a day we've spent together

723
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:18,550
has passed without bringing me joy.

724
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:21,510
No matter how time flies,

725
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:23,470
and how years go by,

726
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:26,630
you'll always be my beloved Gou.

727
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:40,110
Gou,

728
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:44,150
if...

729
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:48,830
If one day I hurt you,

730
00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:53,870
it must not be the real me.

731
00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:57,100
Because the real Bai Cai

732
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,270
would never hurt Gou.

733
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:53,470
It's all good now. He has recovered.

734
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:55,570
Great!

735
00:38:56,430 --> 00:38:57,230
Let's go.

736
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:03,550
Kong Que, I'm doing okay.

737
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:05,150
This is odd.

738
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:06,390
You kept outputting

739
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:09,110
your ancient divine power for three days and three nights.

740
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:10,750
Instead of fatigue,

741
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:13,580
you've gained stronger divine power. How so?

742
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:16,800
Maybe I'm endowed with a special gift.

743
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:17,950
Kong Que,

744
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:20,230
you just don't have it.

745
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:51,220
Gou, you finally woke up.

746
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:52,750
Are you feeling unwell?

747
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:55,060
As I recall,

748
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:56,710
I was poisoned.

749
00:39:57,870 --> 00:40:00,430
How did I manage to reach a full recovery?

750
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:02,590
You're amazing.

751
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:03,790
You were poisoned by the White Lotus Great Sage,

752
00:40:03,790 --> 00:40:05,320
but you quickly recovered.

753
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:07,400
Bai Cai, how are you holding up?

754
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:08,600
I'm doing great.

755
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:09,950
You're awake now?

756
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:11,810
Has anything happened to Bai Cai?

757
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:14,910
Since you sank into a coma,

758
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:16,760
Bai Cai has been taking care of you.

759
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:19,090
I'm just thinking maybe she's exhausted.

760
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:21,710
Come on.

761
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,620
All the toxins have left Gou's system.

762
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:30,550
He is safe now.

763
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:36,030
However...

764
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:37,810
What's the matter?

765
00:40:38,350 --> 00:40:39,150
Wu Geng,

766
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:42,070
now try concentrating your divine spirit.

767
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:09,220
My divine power is gone.

768
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:10,510
What should we do?

769
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:13,310
The toxins once spread to Gou's meridians,

770
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:15,470
causing suppression on his divine power.

771
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:16,750
Perhaps in a few days,

772
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:18,110
Gou will resume his power.

773
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:19,510
What if it won't happen?

774
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:21,830
Don't worry.

775
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:24,320
At least I've survived the crisis.

776
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,920
If the power won't come back,

777
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:27,710
I'll start cultivation again.

778
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:28,830
Under such circumstances,

779
00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:30,890
cultivation can't get you anywhere.

780
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:33,830
You'll have to play it by ear.

781
00:41:37,430 --> 00:41:38,230
By the way,

782
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:39,670
it's already been some time

783
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:41,230
since we left Shenyin Village.

784
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:42,030
It is high time

785
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:43,310
we went back to inform the villagers

786
00:41:43,310 --> 00:41:44,970
of our victory in Bai capital.

787
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:48,710
Lan will stay here with you.

788
00:41:48,990 --> 00:41:50,830
Contact me if anything happens.

789
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:52,710
I'll walk you out.

790
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:53,390
Gou!

791
00:41:56,990 --> 00:41:57,590
You

792
00:41:58,060 --> 00:41:59,430
should take your medicine now.

793
00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:01,190
Don't you want to regain your divine power?

794
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:02,910
I'll see the people of Shenyin Village off.

795
00:42:02,910 --> 00:42:03,670
You stay put.

796
00:42:04,270 --> 00:42:05,870
Kong Que, let me walk you out.

797
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:21,630
Kong Que, what is this?
