[Episode 28]

4
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:00,110
What?

5
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:02,590
You left just like this?

6
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:05,450
It's you again.

7
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:14,910
He's not my Gou.

8
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,060
Why would I stay by his side?

9
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:18,270
You finally know

10
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:19,990
he's not your Gou.

11
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:21,630
Then, where is

12
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:23,030
your Gou now

13
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:24,630
and why did he

14
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:27,710
impersonate your Gou?

15
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,070
I don't know.

16
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:32,790
You actually know very well.

17
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:34,630
Your Gou

18
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:37,070
is already dead.

19
00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:41,190
Poor Gou.

20
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,500
He only wanted to protect Bai Cai when he was alive.

21
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,510
Who would care

22
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:47,829
about him after he died?

23
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:51,110
Who would avenge him?

24
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,550
Avenge?

25
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,030
Do you want to know

26
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:06,710
how your Gou

27
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,910
really died?

28
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,070
I can let you

29
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:13,230
see the true natures

30
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:16,310
of the people around you.

31
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,470
Bai Cai.

32
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:53,910
Gou.

33
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:18,910
Bai Cai.

34
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,550
Gou, Gou.

35
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:24,110
Gou, bad news!

36
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:25,670
Lan just came back.

37
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:27,670
She said Bai Cai left Bai State.

38
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:29,590
The Immortal Realm is watching eagerly now.

39
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:30,590
It's too dangerous

40
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:31,850
for Ms. Bai to be alone.

41
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:34,070
Where is Uncle Ziyu?

42
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:35,070
Uncle Ziyu said

43
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:36,270
he wants to find a remote place

44
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:37,400
for qi cultivation.

45
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:39,310
Gou.

46
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:42,390
Gou, Zhou Qiao is here.

47
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:52,870
Zhou Qiao,

48
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:54,800
what are you doing here?

49
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,110
Don't be so nervous.

50
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:59,070
I came here alone.

51
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:00,630
I have no time to chat to you.

52
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:02,110
I need to find Bai Cai.

53
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:03,690
I can help you find her,

54
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,390
but things have different priorities.

55
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:07,110
Now, you have

56
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:08,710
a more important thing to do.

57
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:10,790
Enter the palace with me.

58
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:12,390
Enter the palace?

59
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,160
What do you mean?

60
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:15,710
You said it yourself.

61
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:17,870
You want me to pay homage to the Xin King and Queen,

62
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:19,510
help clear their names,

63
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:21,270
and also expose to the public

64
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:22,430
the truth of the Immortal Realm

65
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:23,390
using the Eternal Fruit

66
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,470
to kill people.

67
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:26,180
These things

68
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:27,870
have all been prepared.

69
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:29,370
They're in the palace,

70
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:30,870
right before the portraits

71
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:32,470
of the Xin King and Queen.

72
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:34,120
You mean

73
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:35,880
ancestral worship?

74
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:37,510
That's right.

75
00:05:37,909 --> 00:05:39,640
Tomorrow is an auspicious day.

76
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:41,270
Tomorrow morning,

77
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:43,030
I will open the palace gate

78
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:44,630
so that all the people

79
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:47,560
can enter the palace to worship the Xin King with you.

80
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:48,620
At that time,

81
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:50,150
you can tell them

82
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,790
about the Eternal Fruit

83
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:54,230
and take advantage of the public anger

84
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:55,270
to go up in arms

85
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:57,640
and strengthen your anti-immortal army.

86
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:59,970
This is killing two birds with one stone.

87
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,510
Your reputation

88
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:02,670
will be at the level

89
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:04,200
of the Xin King from before.

90
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,590
When did you

91
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:06,870
become so kind?

92
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:08,960
What are you trying to pull?

93
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:11,270
You chose

94
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,710
these two things,

95
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:15,170
but now you ask me what I'm trying to pull?

96
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:18,390
Okay.

97
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:20,770
I'll go find Bai Cai first.

98
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:21,870
Tomorrow,

99
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:23,760
I'll enter the palace with you.

100
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:26,110
According to etiquette,

101
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:26,950
the day before

102
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:29,830
worshipping a late king, you need to burn incense and bathe,

103
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,910
you can't eat or sleep,

104
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:34,400
and you must pray quietly in the palace

105
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:36,110
for the blessings of the ancestors.

106
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:37,670
Have you forgotten?

107
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:40,570
Your Highness,

108
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:42,510
what Zhou Qiao said

109
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:44,390
is reasonable.

110
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:45,710
Although

111
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:48,110
the Xin State is gone,

112
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,030
that means we must

113
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:52,470
follow the etiquette even more.

114
00:06:59,159 --> 00:07:00,480
Just go to the palace.

115
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:03,270
I can help you find Ms. Bai Cai.

116
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:04,390
It'll better than you

117
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:06,320
looking for a needle in a haystack.

118
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:33,650
Your Highness,

119
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,600
we found traces left by Bai Cai.

120
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:41,640
Zhaixing Pavilion.

121
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:59,310
Bai Cai's aura is here.

122
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:00,670
She must have been here.

123
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:29,310
What's your name?

124
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:42,309
You look like a puppy.

125
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:43,710
I'll call you

126
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:45,270
Gou.

127
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:47,230
Gou.

128
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:48,790
No,

129
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:51,310
I'm Wu Geng.

130
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:57,510
Gou!

131
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:19,990
Miss.

132
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,600
You look so tired.

133
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,390
Have some tea.

134
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:29,150
Here.

135
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:46,010
My Kongshi Dream has been completed.

136
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,900
Bai Cai is now delirious

137
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:50,430
and completely

138
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:52,030
under my control.

139
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:53,670
Plus,

140
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:55,710
the juice of the Eternal Fruit

141
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:58,430
can make one's divine spirit dazed,

142
00:09:58,430 --> 00:09:59,710
waver,

143
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:00,710
and even

144
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:02,890
produce hallucinations.

145
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:09,910
What should we do with this pot of tea?

146
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:11,270
I believe

147
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:13,710
you understand.

148
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:14,990
I understand.

149
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:18,380
Don't let me down.

150
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:20,830
I'll take her to Zhaixing Pavilion.

151
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:22,310
You know what to do.

152
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,890
This is Zhaixing Pavilion

153
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,870
and where your Gou

154
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:54,630
was killed.

155
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:55,880
Gou...

156
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:58,500
Gou died here.

157
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,160
Your Gou

158
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:12,060
died at the evil empress's Zhaixing Pavilion,

159
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:14,510
under Xinyue Hu's sword.

160
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,840
Xinyue Hu?

161
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,520
The late Queen?

162
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,070
That's right, Xinyue Hu.

163
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:29,990
In other words,

164
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:32,050
Wu Geng's mother.

165
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:38,310
Impossible.

166
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:41,760
Since you don't believe me,

167
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,370
I'll show you.

168
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:03,410
This is my memory.

169
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,530
I want you to see the truth with your own eyes,

170
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:08,800
lest you think I'm lying to you.

171
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:14,320
This is Prince Wu Geng.

172
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:17,220
Although his body is dead,

173
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:18,470
his divine spirit

174
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,960
is in Xinyue Hu's hands.

175
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,270
Gou.

176
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,830
In a short while,

177
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:30,910
he won't be your Gou anymore.

178
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:33,310
Open your eyes wide

179
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:35,630
and take a good look.

180
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:37,510
Mother,

181
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:38,880
what are you doing?

182
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:41,700
I'm going to transfer your divine spirit

183
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,510
into this child's body.

184
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:46,310
From now on, his body

185
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:48,030
will be yours to use.

186
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,630
You're a lowly slave,

187
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:56,950
but you look a bit

188
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:58,590
like Geng.

189
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:00,590
Having Geng

190
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,470
live in this world for you.

191
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,920
is your good luck.

192
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:07,720
You're a fool

193
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,910
and, furthermore, a slave.

194
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,830
Poor child.

195
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,670
In this world,

196
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,470
you're just a useless person,

197
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:22,510
but Geng is different.

198
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,350
He inherited

199
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:26,150
the Immortal Clan's bloodline.

200
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:28,270
He's the prince of Xin State

201
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:31,070
and also the hope of Xin State.

202
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,910
Having him live in this world for you

203
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,670
will be much more important than you.

204
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:56,590
Gou.

205
00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:00,410
Gou.

206
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:04,900
Gou.

207
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:11,470
Gou.

208
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:19,420
Gou!

209
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:27,460
Xinyue Kui.

210
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:29,800
So at that time,

211
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:32,660
Gou was already dead.

212
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,640
He'd died in your mother's hands.

213
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:40,030
You're just a human.

214
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,020
How could you know the tactics of the Immortal Clan?

215
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:44,750
Besides,

216
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,430
they were fully prepared

217
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,270
to deceive you.

218
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:50,510
How could they let you know?

219
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:55,200
Poor Gou.

220
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,790
He died in Wu Geng's place

221
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:00,280
just because they had similar looks.

222
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,540
Wu Geng!

223
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:05,930
Wu Geng, come out!

224
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:08,510
I need to get a clear answer!

225
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:10,730
Wu Geng!

226
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:12,310
That's right, Bai Cai.

227
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:15,070
You want to kill Wu Geng

228
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:17,120
to avenge Gou.

229
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:20,510
Kill Wu Geng

230
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:23,310
to avenge Gou.

231
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:26,510
To avenge Gou.

232
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:27,910
Do you remember

233
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:30,270
what I said before?

234
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:32,470
When necessary,

235
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:35,310
kill Bai Cai.

236
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:37,120
Don't worry.

237
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:39,550
Wu Geng will appear

238
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:41,230
in front of you soon.

239
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:42,840
By then,

240
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:46,830
you can ask him clearly.

241
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:27,510
Why, Lan?

242
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,480
I didn't want to kill you,

243
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,390
but now it seems

244
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,910
that I must.

245
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:33,910
Don't blame me.

246
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:37,710
Why do you want to kill me?

247
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,660
The High Priest ordered me

248
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,740
that if anything happens,

249
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:43,910
I must kill you myself.

250
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:51,030
Does Wu Geng know

251
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:52,990
that you want to kill me?

252
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:53,990
He doesn't.

253
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:56,270
He loves you wholeheartedly.

254
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:57,670
I've never told him.

255
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,270
Bai Cai,

256
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:00,910
why are you going against Wu Geng

257
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:01,840
with Xinyue Kui?

258
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:03,790
He loves you so much.

259
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:05,730
Why do you have to hurt him?

260
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,990
He killed Gou.

261
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:10,430
He killed Gou,

262
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:11,470
you know?

263
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:18,069
Bai Cai,

264
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:19,910
I used to think

265
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:22,150
that I could ignore

266
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:23,750
those unfounded prophecies

267
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,230
and even disobey the High Priest's order.

268
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:27,030
Prophecy?

269
00:17:27,369 --> 00:17:28,310
Bai Cai,

270
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:30,190
I'm sure now.

271
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:32,190
You will definitely hurt Wu Geng.

272
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:33,470
Whether it's his body

273
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:34,510
or his heart,

274
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:36,270
you will hurt him.

275
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,230
Bai Cai,

276
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,870
you asked me before

277
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:46,110
if I have any other feelings for Wu Geng.

278
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:47,870
Love between the Immortal Clan and human race

279
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:49,230
will be cursed.

280
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:51,190
The Xin King and Xinyue Hu,

281
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:52,910
Shi Xing and Mingyue...

282
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:55,730
The human will be the one who gets hurt in the end.

283
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,260
I'm from the Immortal Clan

284
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:58,710
and Wu Geng is human.

285
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,340
Even without you,

286
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:01,270
we can only be

287
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:02,270
a teacher and student,

288
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:03,530
comrades, or friends.

289
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,310
I can fight for him

290
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,830
and die for him,

291
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:08,260
but nothing else,

292
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,670
other than that.

293
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:12,030
You can blame me,

294
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:13,230
but don't blame him!

295
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:14,070
Lan!

296
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:33,270
Don't hurt her.

297
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:38,590
Tomorrow

298
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:40,480
is a big day.

299
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:42,540
All of this

300
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:45,310
relies on you, Ms. Bai Cai.

301
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:48,290
Have you made up your mind?

302
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:49,790
I don't need to repeat

303
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:52,460
the rules for tomorrow, right?

304
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:02,430
Prince Wu Geng,

305
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:03,950
I found this on the street.

306
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:04,670
Look.

307
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,510
Does it belongs to Ms. Bai Cai?

308
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:19,310
By the way,

309
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:21,470
this is the ritual for the sacrificial ceremony tomorrow.

310
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:23,470
Your Highness, please have a look.

311
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,360
[Sacrificial Ceremony Ritual]

312
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:29,120
Welcome the Immortal half a quarter before sunrise?

313
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:29,420
[Sacrificial Ceremony Ritual]

314
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,630
Tell Zhou Qiao

315
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,940
this is unnecessary.

316
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:35,070
I'm rebelling against the Immortals.

317
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:36,690
Yes.

318
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:47,930
Congratulations, High Priest.

319
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,620
Our plan was successful.

320
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:51,610
Wu Geng is in the palace now.

321
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:52,480
According to etiquette,

322
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,110
he can't eat or rest

323
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:55,270
today.

324
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:56,310
Just this

325
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:58,410
can also consume some of his strength.

326
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:00,030
Well done.

327
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:02,270
As you can see,

328
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:03,830
once Wu Geng is eliminated,

329
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:05,030
you can

330
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,560
ascend to the throne without any obstacles.

331
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:12,870
Zhou Qiao,

332
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:15,430
I know

333
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:17,440
you have your own purposes.

334
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:18,740
But my divine power

335
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:20,670
of the Kongshi Realm

336
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:23,190
allows me to see through

337
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,240
your every move.

338
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,510
I... I dare not

339
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:29,510
lie to you.

340
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,910
Do you want to replace Gui Mu

341
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:34,580
as the immortal resident in the mortal world forever

342
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:36,910
or become the second Xin King

343
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:38,510
or Zhou Fa?

344
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,230
I advise you to think carefully.

345
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:44,510
Before I come to the mortal world,

346
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:47,070
take care of the rest problems.

347
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:49,710
Don't leave any hidden trouble.

348
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,100
Okay, High Priest.

349
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:55,290
Are you saying

350
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:59,360
Wu Geng will mourn Brother and Sister-in-law

351
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:01,900
in front of the palace?

352
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:04,390
That's right.

353
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:06,340
At noon the day after tomorrow.

354
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:12,390
Don't worry, High Priest.

355
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:13,190
Tomorrow,

356
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:15,080
Ziyu definitely will not show up.

357
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,330
As for Lan,

358
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:19,910
High Priest,

359
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,670
this is what I think.

360
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,540
Wu Geng's divine power of the Colorless Realm

361
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,670
is very strong.

362
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:26,360
I think we should keep her alive.

363
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,090
If anything happens tomorrow,

364
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:31,870
Wu Geng will have to think twice for the sake of her life.

365
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:34,270
You're very thoughtful.

366
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:38,190
Then let her live one more night.

367
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:40,720
Ziyu won't show up tomorrow.

368
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:43,070
Lan and those slaves

369
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,630
are in our hands.

370
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:45,870
Also,

371
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:47,510
Bai Cai will turn against him.

372
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:48,310
High Priest,

373
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:50,670
we have a very careful plan.

374
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:52,310
I really don't know

375
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:55,030
how Wu Geng can survive.

376
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,530
Trying to send a message?

377
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:24,510

378
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:25,670

379
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:28,030
please bless me

00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:30,730
with a smooth day tomorrow.

00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:59,150
hold their heads high, become strong,

390
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:00,680
and not kneel to immortals.

391
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:03,170
My mother always believed

392
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:05,390
that everyone was born equal.

393
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:07,920
Father and Mother

394
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:10,490
didn't like people kneeling to them.

395
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:18,790
The Immortal Clan killed my parents

396
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:20,970
and left their bodies in the wild.

397
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:24,270
It also destroyed Xin State, which has a 100-year history.

398
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:25,730
This is a personal grudge.

399
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:29,230
The Immortal Clan has occupied Xin State

400
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:30,630
and enslaved the people.

401
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:32,630
They have even used the Eternal Fruit

402
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:33,830
to harm the people.

403
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:36,040
This is a public grudge.

404
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:40,110
Although my strength is weak,

405
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:42,110
I won't yield to power.

406
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:44,510
We should know

407
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:47,440
we don't need to be afraid of immortals

408
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:49,640
and destiny is nothing to be afraid of.

409
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:01,310
My father once said

410
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:04,160
what people pursue in this life

411
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:06,160
is not about never failing.

412
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:08,870
It's about being able to stand up again

413
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:10,190
when you fall.

414
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:12,990
That's what he said

415
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:14,870
and did.

416
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:16,830
My parents

417
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:19,710
had a clear conscience towards Heaven, Earth,

418
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:20,830
their hearts,

419
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:22,990
and the people.

420
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:29,550
Today, I'm going to fight against immortals.

421
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:30,350
Maybe

422
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:32,390
I'll fail like them.

423
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:34,070
Maybe

424
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:36,070
I'll die like them.

425
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:38,710
But I hope

426
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:40,960
you can remember what I said today.

427
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:43,520
Remember,

428
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,040
the people come first

429
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:47,600
than immortals.

430
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:49,870
The people come first

431
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:51,390
than Heaven.

432
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:56,400
Well said.

433
00:25:57,670 --> 00:25:58,510
Well said.

434
00:25:59,020 --> 00:25:59,920
Well said.

435
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:01,830
Well said.

436
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:12,830
Let's begin.

437
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:50,470
Bai Cai?

438
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:54,190
Bai Cai,

439
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:56,070
I'm glad you came.

440
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:57,190
Come.

441
00:26:57,370 --> 00:26:59,190
Mourn my parents with me.

442
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:00,910
They would be very happy.

443
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:15,510
A sage is someone whose spirit lives on after he dies.

444
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:24,390
[Tianji Palace]

445
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:19,840
There's law in the world. The great virtue can be demonstrated widely.

446
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,440
Bow

447
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:24,190
and show your respect.

448
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:27,230
Xin King will be remembered forever.

449
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:30,710
Xin King will be remembered forever.

450
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,990
[Tianji Palace]

451
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:51,730
[Tianji Palace]

452
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:03,750
If they

453
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:05,410
really had a clear conscience

454
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:07,560
towards Heaven, Earth,

455
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:09,430
and the people like you said,

456
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,260
how did my Gou

457
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:13,480
die?

458
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:39,790
The wind has risen.

459
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:43,080
Wu Geng,

460
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:45,280
Lan,

461
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:48,620
are you okay?

462
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,530
If destiny really exists,

463
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:01,710
what did my Gou

464
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:02,870
do wrong?

465
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:05,710
Bai Cai,

466
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:07,890
what are you doing?

467
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:15,430
What's going on?

468
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:20,230
Protect Prince Wu Geng.

469
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:24,610
Gui Mu's Poison Locust!

470
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:28,370
Zhou Qiao!

471
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:40,630
Gou.

472
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:41,710
-Hurry.
-Gou.

473
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:42,550
What's wrong?

474
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:42,990
What's wrong?

475
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:43,910
Go protect the people.

476
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:45,070
But... what about you?

477
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:46,230
Go!

478
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:48,670
Let's go. Protect everyone.

479
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:49,710
Be careful, Gou.

480
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:50,400
Okay.

481
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:51,350
Be careful, Gou.

482
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:52,830
Hurry! Leave now!

483
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:53,920
Get out of here!

484
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:54,950
-Leave!
-Leave!

485
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:55,870
Hurry!

486
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:57,070
Everyone, leave now!

487
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:03,430
Don't stay here.

488
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:04,390
Leave!

489
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:05,890
Leave now!

490
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:18,910
Bai Cai, why?

491
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:22,640
[Tianji Palace]

492
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:24,680
Why?

493
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:32,020
[Tianji Palace]

494
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:41,870
Run!

495
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:52,070
This way.

496
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,130
[Tianji Palace]

497
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:14,280
Wu Geng,

498
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:16,510
why are you so distant?

499
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:19,880
Today is the big day of mourning my sister.

500
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:22,070
Why didn't you tell me?

501
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:23,430
Don't you

502
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:26,110
regard me as your family?

503
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:08,950
You have colluded with each other

504
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:10,940
to set a trap to kill me?

505
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:12,410
What else do you think?

506
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:15,710
Should we let you, a rebel from the previous dynasty,

507
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:17,070
mourn Xin King, an anti-immortal rebel,

508
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:19,080
openly?

509
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:21,130
If I don't kill you,

510
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:22,310
how can I

511
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:24,790
sit on the throne at ease?

512
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:28,390
Gui Mu,

513
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:30,550
Plague Immortal,

514
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:31,810
can't miss this scene.

515
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:33,490
Zhou Qiao,

516
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:36,020
go ask your godfather here now.

517
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:39,790
Yes, High Priest.

518
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:45,810
Wu Geng,

519
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:48,050
today,

520
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:50,110
I'm going to let Fu Xi know

521
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,390
what destiny is.

522
00:34:10,429 --> 00:34:12,800
[Tianji Palace]

523
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:13,340
This dagger

524
00:34:13,469 --> 00:34:14,710
was specially made.

525
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:17,440
It can suppress the divine spirit.

526
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:19,400
Now,

527
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:20,710
you can no longer use

528
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:22,969
the divine power of the Colorless Realm.

529
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:24,510
Accept your fate.

530
00:34:33,909 --> 00:34:36,639
High Priest's divine power of the Kongshi Realm.

531
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:41,560
Zhui Ri's divine power of the Wanxiang Realm.

532
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:44,510
Great.

533
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:48,469
They are here to save me.

534
00:34:49,469 --> 00:34:51,010
Zhou Qiao,

535
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:57,050
I'll make you pay the price.

536
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:05,580
Stay away!

537
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:26,830
Good, Bai Cai.

538
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:28,550
Wu Geng

539
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:30,220
is the one who killed Gou.

540
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:32,790
You must avenge him.

541
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:47,640
Wu Geng,

542
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:49,600
because of you,

543
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,110
I can never

544
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:52,110
see my Gou again.

545
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:55,470
If anyone

546
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:56,870
dares to hurt my Gou,

547
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:59,230
I will never let him go.

548
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:15,250
Darn it.

549
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:17,270
The ancient divine power is so strong.

550
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:18,030
It's resisting

551
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:20,090
my divine power of the Kongshi Realm.

552
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:28,640
Bai Cai,

553
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:31,310
Wu Geng killed Gou.

554
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:32,990
Now I order you

555
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,440
to kill him.

556
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:35,920
Kill Wu Geng.

557
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:45,170
Answer me now.

558
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:46,930
Are you Wu Geng

559
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:48,510
or Gou?

560
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:10,440
Bai Cai,

561
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:13,820
whether I'm Wu Geng or Gou,

562
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:16,030
I will protect you

563
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:17,910
forever.

564
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:47,830
Fine.

565
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:50,050
I trust you.

566
00:37:57,970 --> 00:38:00,230
The divine power of the Colorless Realm.

567
00:38:12,730 --> 00:38:14,380
The nature of humans

568
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:16,920
is endowed

569
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,010
by Heaven.

570
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:25,740
What is destiny?

571
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:28,620
The strong are destiny.

572
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:31,270
The powerful are destiny.

573
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:34,100
Immortals are destiny.

574
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:39,670
But in this world,

575
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:41,400
the people's will

576
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:43,250
and all the living creatures

577
00:38:44,290 --> 00:38:47,460
are destiny too.

578
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:53,040
Kui,

579
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:56,030
if you don't understand this,

580
00:38:57,950 --> 00:39:00,750
what's the use

581
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:04,710
of having my eyes?

582
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:18,310
Fortunately, the livestock used on the memorial ceremony

583
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:19,400
is fresh enough

584
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:21,550
to let me apply some blood on my body.

585
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:22,920
Otherwise,

586
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:24,310
it would've been really difficult

587
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:25,470
to put on this show.

588
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:36,490
Xinyue Kui,

589
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:38,690
everything you saw

590
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:40,810
is what we wanted you to see.

591
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:42,970
You thought you would surely win.

592
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:44,070
Actually,

593
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:45,870
it was just

594
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:47,580
a show.

595
00:39:47,810 --> 00:39:50,450
Xinyue Kui is evil and cunning.

596
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:52,640
She likes to play tricks secretly.

597
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:53,870
So in the future,

598
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:55,510
she definitely will try

599
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:56,670
to deal with us.

600
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:57,630
We must

601
00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:59,100
think of a perfect plan

602
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:02,290
to make sure we can defeat her with just one blow.

603
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,070
The Demon Realm

604
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,840
is the Demon Clan's territory.

605
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:07,490
She definitely won't show up here.

606
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:08,430
This is also another reason

607
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:10,230
why I want to return to Bai State.

608
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:13,170
As long as I appear in the mortal realm...

609
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:14,780
She definitely will show up.

610
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:16,190
By that time,

611
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:18,090
we can catch the turtle in the jar.

612
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:22,070
I knew it

613
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:24,310
when you approached Bai Cai for the first time.

614
00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:25,230
By the way, Gou,

615
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:27,350
what's your opinion

616
00:40:27,350 --> 00:40:28,490
on the mysterious person who saved me today?

617
00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:30,280
There's no secret between us.

618
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:31,890
This is what you can't see.

619
00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:33,230
So,

620
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,300
Gou asked me to pretend not to know

621
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:36,640
and play along with you.

622
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:43,740
-Gou.
-Gou.

623
00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:49,840
After I figured out your intention,

624
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,350
I used the divine power of the Colorless Realm

625
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:53,510
to isolate your divine power of the Kongshi Realm.

626
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:54,910
Then I told Bai Cai

627
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:56,440
about the relationship between me and Gou.

628
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,170
This is also what you can't see.

629
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:00,680
Actually, I'm Wu Geng.

630
00:41:01,350 --> 00:41:02,570
I'm also Gou.

631
00:41:02,850 --> 00:41:04,710
Bai Cai pretended to be bewitched

632
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:06,390
to make you think

633
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:07,710
you succeeded

634
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:08,950
in driving a wedge between us.

635
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:09,750
This

636
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:11,270
is our first step.

637
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:14,310
Actually, I knew

638
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:16,870
you would use Bai Cai to hurt me

639
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,110
on the day of the memorial ceremony long ago.

640
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:20,590
So we followed your plan

641
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:22,440
to catch a turtle in the jar.

642
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:23,590
This

643
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:25,430
is our second step.

644
00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:28,710
I was worried that we couldn't fool you.

645
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:30,630
I didn't expect

646
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:31,310
the Immortal Realm's high priest

647
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:33,440
to fall into Wu Geng's trap so quickly.

648
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:36,480
Xinyue Kui,

649
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:37,630
you underestimated

650
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:38,990
Bai Cai's trust in me.

651
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:41,280
This is the first mistake you made.

652
00:41:42,790 --> 00:41:43,590
Good.

653
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:46,870
Very good.

654
00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:49,270
You have many tricks.

655
00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:52,230
You know how to play along.

656
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:55,710
So what?

657
00:41:57,110 --> 00:41:58,310
So what?

658
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:01,510
I'm going to attack the Immortal Realm

659
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:03,110
and destroy

660
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:04,270
all the powerful immortals like you!
