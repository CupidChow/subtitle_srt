[Episode 5]

4
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:38,970
Take one.

5
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,259
Hurry.

6
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,080
Bai Cai, hurry.

7
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:50,660
It's delicious.

8
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,120
Eat up.

9
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:57,210
You guys!

10
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,740
You're not allowed to eat.

11
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:01,460
Why can't we eat?

12
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,590
Because you haven't dug up

13
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,050
enough bloodstones.

14
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:06,250
We only arrived late last night.

15
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:07,910
How can you compare us to them?

16
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,320
But they've all

17
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:10,660
met their quotas.

18
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,760
Don't just stand there. Keep eating.

19
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,870
You're deliberately making things hard for us.

20
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,110
So what?

21
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:29,520
You can only blame yourselves.

22
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,040
You made the wrong friend.

23
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,260
Here, eat.

24
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:43,060
I said, you can't eat!

25
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,300
You…

26
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,320
I can not eat it,

27
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:48,610
but they have to.

28
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:50,480
They deserve to eat.

29
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:52,800
I'm the centurion here.

30
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,750
I said you can't eat it,

31
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,190
and that's it!

32
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,020
Centurion?

33
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:00,660
Do you think being the head slave

34
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,010
makes you different from us?

35
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:03,410
In the eyes of the Immortal Clan,

36
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:04,330
you and I

37
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,620
are no different

38
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:06,890
from anyone else here.

39
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:08,610
We're all just dogs.

40
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:11,370
I dare you to say that again.

41
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:12,380
Gou.

42
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:13,230
I said,

43
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:15,430
you're just a servile dog,

44
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,920
bullying the weak, flattering the powerful,

45
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,110
and always begging for mercy with your tail between your legs.

46
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,170
Gou is right.

47
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:19,770
He's so sharp-tongued.

48
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:20,530
He doesn't look like someone

49
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:21,720
who has suffered brain damage.

50
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,520
Beat him!

51
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:26,620
Stop!

52
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,220
Stop!

53
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:30,010
Stop!

54
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,620
Stop! Stop!

55
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:33,690
Gou.

56
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:35,310
You're quite tough.

57
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:37,570
Centurion, Centurion, Mr. Cai.

58
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,200
He's an imbecile. Please cut him some slack.

59
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,140
He's having an episode, or he wouldn't have dared to offend you.

60
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,090
You have a big heart.

61
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:43,130
Please let him go.

62
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:44,810
Don't beg this servile dog!

63
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:46,070
You just won't give in!

64
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,160
I'll beat you up.

65
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,520
Bai Cai!

66
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:55,530
Bai Cai.

67
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,140
Centurion.

68
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:59,990
Centurion, now that you've already beaten him,

69
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,110
please calm down.

70
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,450
I promise

71
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:04,420
he won't do anything stupid again.

72
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:05,850
Please forgive him.

73
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:08,600
Gou!

74
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,910
Bai Cai will get beaten because of you!

75
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:15,170
If this happens again,

76
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:16,390
I'll kill you!

77
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:18,529
Let's go.

78
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:21,329
Are you okay?

79
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:21,610
Are you okay?

80
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:22,810
What are you looking at? Get back to work.

81
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:24,620
Bai Cai, are you okay?

82
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:25,650
Don't dawdle.

83
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:29,830
Hurry up.

84
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,680
Hurry up.

85
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,360
Keep up.

86
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:35,250
This way.

87
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,750
Move, move.

88
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:39,030
Those behind, keep up.

89
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,700
Move! Hurry!

90
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:43,110
Hurry!

91
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:46,159
Hurry up.

92
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:47,750
I'm talking about you.

93
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:50,290
Those bullies…

94
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:53,350
Gou, let's go to sleep.

95
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,580
We have to get up early to work tomorrow.

96
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:58,320
We'll sleep together?

97
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:01,240
Of course. We're a married couple.

98
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:03,640
There are few women in the mine.

99
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,040
I can't sleep on the floor

100
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,520
with a bunch of strangers.

101
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,090
Gou, let's go sleep there.

102
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:12,920
Let's go.

103
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:42,770
You can quickly adapt

104
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:43,900
to any environment.

105
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,650
Unlike you, I don't have an issue

106
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:47,140
with everything.

107
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:58,490
I'll sleep here.

108
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,390
What a dump. There isn't even a door.

109
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:41,390
How dare you kick me?

110
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:43,470
It's midnight.

111
00:06:43,659 --> 00:06:45,350
You're audacious.

112
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:47,050
I can report this to Chen Jing.

113
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,450
Don't slander us.

114
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,840
We're just doing a routine check.

115
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,820
If you dare

116
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,280
come near my wife again,

117
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,820
I'll kill you!

118
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:54,710
You…

119
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:57,050
Let's go.

120
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:59,159
Brat, wait and see!

121
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:39,020
What's wrong?

122
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,490
Listen.

123
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:44,250
You really should stop

124
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:45,909
offending Cai and the others.

125
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:48,210
We're on their turf.

126
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:49,930
Nothing good can come from

127
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:51,390
going toe to toe with them.

128
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,710
Whether you want to resist

129
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:57,180
or escape,

130
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:59,610
you have to keep yourself safe first.

131
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:00,380
Am I right?

132
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,570
Only after you survive will there be hope.

133
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:04,980
You told me that.

134
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,210
Geng.

135
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:10,160
You'll start all over

136
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:13,730
with this identity.

137
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,100
You'll experience the hardships of life

138
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,780
and develop unforgettable relationships.

139
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:21,920
Life

140
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,890
will be harder for you than ever.

141
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:28,110
But that's the only way

142
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,470
that you can find

143
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,890
your own path.

144
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:33,860
Geng.

145
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:38,130
Stay alive.

146
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,220
Remember.

147
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,120
I'm not the one

148
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:42,750
who will stop the war.

149
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:43,750
You'll do that.

150
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:47,340
So you have to have the courage to fight against the immortals.

151
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,720
You need to

152
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,610
fulfill the duty that I failed to fulfill.

153
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:53,060
Promise me

154
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,730
to stay strong

155
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:57,690
and stay alive no matter what.

156
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:00,170
Yes.

157
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:02,300
I have to stay alive.

158
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,300
Father, I won't forget what you said.

159
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,300
I'll stay alive.

160
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,460
I've become Gou,

161
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:14,230
but I'll always be the son of Xin King.

162
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:16,530
Go to sleep.

163
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:53,230
Gou no longer acts out.

164
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:54,630
You've straightened him out.

165
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:56,490
I don't want to get myself killed.

166
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:59,140
Bai Cai.

167
00:09:59,230 --> 00:09:59,970
How did you dig up

168
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:01,210
so many bloodstones?

169
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:02,650
I'm lucky.

170
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:03,610
I've found a crack

171
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:05,540
where there are many bloodstones.

172
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,360
We have to work harder.

173
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,710
Come on, Shitou.

174
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:37,290
Don't grab. Everyone has a share.

175
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:38,930
You ravenous savages!

176
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,920
Stop grabbing!

177
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:41,490
You slack off at work

178
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:43,820
but never miss a beat when it's time to eat.

179
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:45,650
Why did you take my bun?

180
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:46,620
It's not your bun.

181
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,640
It belongs to whoever gets hold of it.

182
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,810
Gou.

183
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,650
Let it go.

184
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:51,240
He must be too hungry.

185
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,930
We have two more buns, don't we?

186
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:54,330
Let's go up and eat them.

187
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:57,170
How could he do that?

188
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,150
Can't he get his own bun?

189
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,250
Here.

190
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:29,250
Old Man.

191
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:31,610
You didn't get a bun, did you?

192
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,650
Here. This is for you.

193
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,620
Thank you, young man.

194
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:52,580
I'm old.

195
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:54,370
I don't need to eat much.

196
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:56,490
You're still growing.

197
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,920
Eat it yourself.

198
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:00,410
Just take it, Old Man.

199
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,820
I appreciate the gesture.

200
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,900
How are your wounds?

201
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,720
You mean the wounds I got

202
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,250
when Cai beat me?

203
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:17,490
It was just like a tickle.

204
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:18,800
I'm fine.

205
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:22,270
Young man,

206
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,910
don't underestimate that whip.

207
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:28,100
It takes a long time for the wounds it causes to heal.

208
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:29,640
Old Man.

209
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:31,670
You're a good man.

210
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:35,670
Recently,

211
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:37,970
I've been through a lot.

212
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:40,820
In a time of unrest,

213
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:44,140
keeping oneself safe is already hard enough.

214
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:46,450
Few people

215
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,570
care about others

216
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:50,650
like you do.

217
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,100
I care about you

218
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:56,660
because you look like

219
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,370
someone I know.

220
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:02,720
Is he your family?

221
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:09,170
He was a boy

222
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:11,780
I met in this mine

223
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,300
many years ago.

224
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:56,420
[Young Xin King]

225
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,160
Idiot!

226
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,550
Do you have a death wish?

227
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:04,980
These bloodstones are for the Immortal Clan.

228
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:05,690
If you break them,

229
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:08,620
even killing you ten times is not punishment enough.

230
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:14,140
You're dead!

231
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:17,810
Forget it.

232
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,160
We can't defeat them.

233
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:21,330
What's so amazing about the Immortal Clan?

234
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:22,140
The lives of us humans

235
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:23,140
matter as well!

236
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,200
One day,

237
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:42,190
I'll defeat the Immortal Clan

238
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:44,410
so that the human race

239
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:46,250
will not suffer anymore.

240
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,110
Just wait and see.

241
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,860
I'll prove to you

242
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,010
that the Immortal Clan

243
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:55,360
is not invincible.

244
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,130
The moment

245
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:03,230
you grabbed Cai's whip,

246
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:04,410
you looked exactly

247
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:06,820
like that boy.

248
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:09,130
So, in this mine,

249
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:11,570
someone once resisted.

250
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:12,810
Of course.

251
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:16,040
That boy also promised

252
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,330
to create a world

253
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:18,650
where no one lived

254
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:21,050
under the oppression of the Immortal Clan.

255
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,720
Soon after,

256
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:24,540
he escaped

257
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:25,650
from this mine.

258
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:27,840
He escaped?

259
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,540
There's a way

260
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:34,450
to escape this place?

261
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:35,700
Of course.

262
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,060
If you want

263
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:38,190
to escape this…

264
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:42,670
Old Man.

265
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:45,330
Old Man.

266
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:46,130
Old Man.

267
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:47,180
Sir. Sir.

268
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:47,690
Old Man.

269
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:49,060
Help him up.

270
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:49,890
Help him up.

271
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:50,730
Take care of him.

272
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:51,730
I'll go find the centurion.

273
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:52,610
Okay, Gou.

274
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:03,820
He's awake. Hurry.

275
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,080
Old Man, you're awake.

276
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,660
Here, have some water.

277
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:09,740
Let's go back to work.

278
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:11,820
Thank you.

279
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:15,610
Take your time. Take your time.

280
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:25,490
Miss, thank you.

281
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:28,120
I want

282
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:30,640
to ask you for a favor.

283
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:32,250
Sure. Go ahead.

284
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:51,860
It's Ling.

285
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:53,520
I saved it in this mine

286
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:55,500
a few years ago.

287
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:59,570
Take care of it for me in the future

288
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:01,340
so that it can keep

289
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:03,000
Gou and you company.

290
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:04,329
Okay?

291
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,690
Sir, don't worry.

292
00:17:06,819 --> 00:17:08,380
I'll take good care of it.

293
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:09,579
You'll definitely

294
00:17:09,579 --> 00:17:11,050
recover soon.

295
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:12,490
Thank you.

296
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:18,619
He's sick.

297
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:19,380
Can you

298
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,700
find a doctor for him?

299
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,490
Do your quota first.

300
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:25,060
I'll take care of him.

301
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:33,070
Old Man.

302
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:34,990
After seeing the doctor,

303
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,940
you'll get better.

304
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,590
Thank you, boy.

305
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:40,780
I don't remember

306
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,610
seeing this old man before.

307
00:17:58,170 --> 00:17:59,300
This bird…

308
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:00,980
The old man

309
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,380
left it in my care.

310
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,500
He wanted it to keep us company.

311
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,090
I wonder

312
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:06,970
if they can cure

313
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:08,230
the old man's disease.

314
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:16,500
Bai Cai, go back to work.

315
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,210
I'll go take a look.

316
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:17,850
Okay.

317
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:32,670
Such a useless man should have died long ago.

318
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:34,480
Let's go.

319
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:35,890
Go.

320
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:41,040
You just killed a man!

321
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,540
A man?

322
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:48,700
There are no men in the mine.

323
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:49,410
There are only tools

324
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:51,140
used for mining bloodstones.

325
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,030
If a tool is broken,

326
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:54,850
of course I have to dispose of it.

327
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,540
Then I'll go ask Chen Jing

328
00:18:57,910 --> 00:18:59,700
if he approves of killing people

329
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,210
in the mine!

330
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,100
You want to tell on us?

331
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,250
You'd be dead before you could do that.

332
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:13,210
Stay back.

333
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:14,260
Or I'll let go.

334
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:15,060
Don't do that.

335
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:16,730
Back off. Back off!

336
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,570
Are you afraid of death too?

337
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:21,460
Didn't you say

338
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:23,500
humans were just tools?

339
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,130
After you die,

340
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,690
someone else will take your place

341
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:28,250
as the centurion.

342
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:28,980
Am I right?

343
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:29,400
Boss.

344
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:31,930
No!

345
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,260
Mr. Gou, please don't let go.

346
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,250
I'm begging you.

347
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:36,190
I'm begging you.

348
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:37,440
I'm begging you.

349
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:44,560
I'm different from you.

350
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:46,170
Don't let me see

351
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:47,430
you kill anyone again.

352
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:49,900
Otherwise, I'll make you pay!

353
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:54,740
Boss. Boss.

354
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:56,060
Boss, are you okay?

355
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,390
Where were you just now?

356
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:15,450
Gou.

357
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:16,450
Where did you go?

358
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:17,820
You don't look well.

359
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,210
Gou.

360
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:23,220
What happened?

361
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:26,200
There are no doctors in the mine.

362
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:28,190
They threw the old man

363
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:29,500
off the bridge.

364
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:30,950
What?

365
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:32,470
That means

366
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:33,810
everyone here

367
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:34,900
can't get sick.

368
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:37,090
Otherwise, we'll be thrown off the bridge

369
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:38,090
and die on our own.

370
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,060
Cai and his minions

371
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:42,310
are not treating us as humans!

372
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,850
Bai Cai, are you okay?

373
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:46,840
You look pale.

374
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:47,670
I'm fine.

375
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,460
I feel sorry for the old man.

376
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:52,410
He worked so hard all his life

377
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:53,060
but ended up

378
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,140
like that.

379
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:55,900
We may

380
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,750
end up like that too.

381
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:01,680
Yeah.

382
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,810
Once we enter this mine,

383
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,370
we can never get out of here.

384
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:18,370
No.

385
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:20,870
I will get out of here.

386
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:54,890
Get up.

387
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:56,470
Get up and work. Hurry up.

388
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:58,490
Get up. Come on.

389
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:00,700
Hurry up.

390
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:02,530
Hurry. Get up.

391
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:03,690
Hurry.

392
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:07,100
It's time to get up, Bai Cai.

393
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:13,370
Bai Cai?

394
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:21,180
Bai Cai.

395
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,370
Why are you so cold?

396
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:33,960
Your body is so cold.

397
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,370
You're having a relapse again.

398
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,660
What happened?

399
00:22:58,660 --> 00:22:59,450
I don't know.

400
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:06,720
Bai Cai is sick.

401
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:10,310
But there are no doctors in the mine.

402
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:11,400
What should we do?

403
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,350
Bai Cai was whipped.

404
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:15,000
because of me.

405
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,260
It's all my fault.

406
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:22,730
Come.

407
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:25,420
You two go to work now.

408
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:26,860
Don't let Cai know

409
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:27,940
Bai Cai is sick.

410
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:28,650
Otherwise,

411
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:30,590
they'll take this opportunity to take revenge.

412
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:31,850
Okay. Don't worry, Gou.

413
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:32,410
Okay.

414
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:32,970
Let's go, Shang.

415
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:33,660
Let's go.

416
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:36,690
Do you know where I can find a doctor?

417
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:38,820
There are no doctors here. Move aside.

418
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,140
Do you know where I can find a doctor?

419
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:40,820
No.

420
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:42,020
Do you know where I can find a doctor?

421
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:42,410
No, no.

422
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:44,410
Do you know where I can find a doctor?

423
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:46,570
It's you.

424
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:47,370
It's me.

425
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:49,170
What? Do you want to fight again?

426
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:50,820
Do you know where I can find a doctor?

427
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:51,650
Doctor?

428
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,090
When people here get sick,

429
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:54,580
they have to recover on their own or die.

430
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:56,490
Go away. I'm busy.

431
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:04,140
Go take a look.

432
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:04,850
Okay.

433
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:06,050
Don't dawdle.

434
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:07,370
Let's go.

435
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:15,210
Shitou.

436
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,930
Gou and Bai Cai aren't here today.

437
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:17,730
We need

438
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:18,900
to cover their share of bloodstones.

439
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:19,890
You need to dig up more.

440
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:20,220
I know.

441
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:22,130
But I'm already doing my best.

442
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:23,780
Work hard.

443
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:29,260
Where are Gou and his wife?

444
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:30,370
They…

445
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:31,570
They went to dig for bloodstones over there.

446
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:32,620
They said there were many bloodstones there.

447
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:33,420
Yeah, yeah.

448
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:34,520
Don't lie to me!

449
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,480
I just came back from over there.

450
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:37,900
How dare you lie to me?

451
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:39,270
Do you want to die?

452
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:40,460
Centurion.

453
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:42,810
They didn't come to work today.

454
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:44,740
It seems that the woman is sick.

455
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:56,890
Here.

456
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:07,550
Are you feeling better?

457
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:08,890
I'm fine.

458
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:11,840
You should go back to work.

459
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,160
I just need to lie down.

460
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:15,600
I'll be fine after lying down for a while.

461
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:17,750
Don't be silly.

462
00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:19,670
If it weren't for me,

463
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:21,800
you wouldn't have been beaten by Cai.

464
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:23,610
If I left you alone now,

465
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:24,810
I'd be a jerk.

466
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:28,740
Here, drink more.

467
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:32,730
I'll go ask around

468
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:34,860
to see if anyone can treat your wounds.

469
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:36,820
She's there. Take her away.

470
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:38,050
Look at her.

471
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,810
She must have something contagious.

472
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:41,320
Throw her into the mass grave.

473
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,210
Don't let her stain the place where the living stay.

474
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:44,060
Go!

475
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,210
Gou, I'm so cold.

476
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:51,070
Bai Cai, hang in there.

477
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:51,980
I'll find a way

478
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:52,740
to heal you.

479
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:53,450
Move away!

480
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:54,170
Move!

481
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:55,140
Move!

482
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:56,020
Move!

483
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:57,060
Move!

484
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:58,280
Gou.

485
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,120
Put me down and run for your life.

486
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:00,930
No.

487
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:01,780
I won't let them

488
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:03,210
throw you into the mass grave.

489
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:03,740
Move.

490
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:04,410
Go away!

491
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:05,210
Move!

492
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:06,700
Move!

493
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:09,340
I saw them

494
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,670
running into that cave.

495
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:21,280
Where are they?

496
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,580
I saw them running into here.

497
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:26,400
Yeah. Where are they?

498
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:27,820
Check over there.

499
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:29,480
Let's go.

500
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:35,420
Why couldn't they

501
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:36,450
see us?

502
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:42,050
Bai Cai.

503
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:43,810
Bai Cai.

504
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,100
Bai Cai, wake up!

505
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:46,490
Don't scare me.

506
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:47,460
Tell me.

507
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,830
What can I do to save you?

508
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:49,850
Bai Cai.

509
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:52,970
It'll be too late if she doesn't get treated now.

510
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:25,980
Old Man?

511
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,890
You're still alive.

512
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,660
Silly boy.

513
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:34,070
Staying alive here is harder than death.

514
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:37,930
Let me ask you.

515
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:40,430
To save this slave,

516
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:42,930
are you willing to do anything?

517
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:45,010
As long as you can save Bai Cai,

518
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:46,650
I'll do anything for you.

519
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:47,650
Okay.

520
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,600
Remember what you said.

521
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,990
Make her take this.

522
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,090
One pill a day.

523
00:27:57,090 --> 00:27:58,290
Don't up the dose.

524
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:00,750
She'll recover

525
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,810
after taking it for a while.

526
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:06,090
Thank you, Old Man.

527
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,080
Here, Bai Cai.

528
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:28,450
I didn't expect

529
00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:31,580
Prince Wu Geng

530
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,700
to beg someone

531
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,010
for a slave.

532
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:40,380
You're really like him.

533
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,960
What did you just call me?

534
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,250
Wu Geng.

535
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:51,020
Do you know why your father

536
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:54,040
fought against the Immortal Clan?

537
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:57,400
You know my father?

538
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:01,780
Who on earth are you?

539
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:03,770
It doesn't matter who I am.

540
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:05,770
Just keep this in mind.

541
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,440
I'm here for you.

542
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:11,450
Many years ago,

543
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:13,130
just like you, your father

544
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:15,650
ate, worked,

545
00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:19,010
and lived with slaves

546
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:20,410
in this mine.

547
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:21,900
He promised

548
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:23,370
to fight for the freedom

549
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:25,130
of the human race.

550
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:27,660
I care about you

551
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,210
because you look like

552
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:30,930
someone I know.

553
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:32,250
Is he your family?

554
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,080
He was a boy

555
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:36,200
I met in this mine

556
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:38,330
many years ago.

557
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:40,140
So, the boy

558
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:41,390
you mentioned before…

559
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:42,760
He was your father,

560
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:44,630
Xin King.

561
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:57,760
That brand is very unique.

562
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:02,200
What?

563
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,800
You don't want to be a slave here?

564
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:05,990
Of course not.

565
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,200
Fine.

566
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,770
What I want you to do

567
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:11,870
is stay here

568
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:13,700
and be a good slave.

569
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:16,450
Old Man.

570
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:18,010
The old man left it

571
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:19,370
in my care.

572
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:21,250
He wanted it to keep us company.

573
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:24,630
So what happened that day

574
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:27,380
was all planned by you on purpose?

575
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:30,580
Without experiencing the hardships of the mortal world,

576
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,890
how can you understand

577
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:35,080
what real justice is?

578
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:40,220
Fine.

579
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:43,620
I'll be a good slave.

580
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:44,690
But I won't

581
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:45,970
stay here forever.

582
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:48,370
My father once fought

583
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:50,240
for the freedom of the human race.

584
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:51,970
Now that he's dead,

585
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:53,430
I'll fulfill

586
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:55,010
his dream.

587
00:30:56,410 --> 00:30:57,580
Good boy.

588
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:18,730
What's this?

589
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:20,840
A gift for you.

590
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:23,100
The Fire of Chaos.

591
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:27,130
The Fire of Chaos?

592
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,680
The Fire of…

593
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:39,540
Old Man.

594
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:43,700
Bai Cai.

595
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,660
Bai Cai, you're awake.

596
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:50,450
Gou.

597
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Shang.

598
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:02,030
Go.

599
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:04,110
Go away!

600
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:05,260
Gou and his wife

601
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:06,260
disappeared.

602
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:07,410
You two have to

603
00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:08,410
cover the loss

604
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:09,980
caused by their absence.

605
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:11,210
We didn't skip work.

606
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:12,770
Why did you hit us?

607
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:14,700
Because you two

608
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,210
covered up for them

609
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:17,710
and lied about their whereabouts.

610
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:19,180
That's not true!

611
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:21,090
You abused slaves.

612
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,840
So Gou escaped with Bai Cai.

613
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:24,510
How is that our fault?

614
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:26,550
Who told you we escaped?

615
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:27,390
Gou.

616
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:29,450
We just woke up

617
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:30,610
a little late.

618
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:31,630
We'll make up

619
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:33,200
for all the work we delayed.

620
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:34,930
Weren't you

621
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:36,130
dying just now?

622
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:36,690
Why are you…

623
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:38,800
Centurion, I'm fine.

624
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:40,670
You must have been mistaken.

625
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:43,360
You two are lucky this time.

626
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,210
Remember

627
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:46,210
to meet your quotas today.

628
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:47,010
Let's go.

629
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:51,190
Are you blind? What are you doing?

630
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:51,930
Go back to work!

631
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:52,790
Go back to work!

632
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:54,370
Behave yourselves. What are you looking at?

633
00:32:54,370 --> 00:32:55,050
Bai Cai.

634
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,580
We were so worried about you this morning.

635
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,670
Yeah. Gou was worried sick about you.

636
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,890
Are you okay?

637
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,290
We're fine.

638
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:05,690
We're not fragile. Don't worry about us.

639
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:07,290
Yeah. Let's get back to work.

640
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:15,020
I'm surprised.

641
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:16,980
You actually care so much about me.

642
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,890
I was just worried about being held back by you.

643
00:33:19,890 --> 00:33:21,500
I usually dig up more bloodstones than you.

644
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,560
You're the one who's holding me back.

645
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:27,680
Go have some rest. I'll do it.

646
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:57,960
This matter has nothing to do with you two.

647
00:33:58,390 --> 00:34:00,480
I'll cover Bai Cai's share.

648
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:02,340
Gou, don't say that.

649
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,860
It's hard for you

650
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,630
to do the work of two.

651
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:05,300
But it's not that hard

652
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:06,380
for the three of us

653
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:07,480
to do the work of four.

654
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,190
Yeah.

655
00:34:08,219 --> 00:34:09,370
We came here together.

656
00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:10,830
We should help each other.

657
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,310
Bai Cai is our good friend too.

658
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:13,060
Besides,

659
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,790
the three of us are like brothers.

660
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:17,060
We should have each other's backs.

661
00:34:23,170 --> 00:34:24,570
It's not the three of you.

662
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:26,480
It's the four of us.

663
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,409
Bai Cai, why did you come?

664
00:34:32,139 --> 00:34:33,090
If I hadn't come,

665
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:34,250
I wouldn't have known

666
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:36,250
you guys were working so hard for me.

667
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:37,949
I want to work too.

668
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:38,980
No.

669
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,500
You should take a good rest now.

670
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,010
We

671
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:42,409
will do the work.

672
00:34:42,429 --> 00:34:44,520
I don't have the strength to dig for bloodstones,

673
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,050
but I can help you find them.

674
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:48,010
How?

675
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:17,790
Here it is. Dig into it.

676
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:21,930
How did you manage to do that?

677
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:22,860
You know where bloodstones are

678
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:24,320
just by touching the wall.

679
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:32,690
Why can't I

680
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:33,810
feel anything?

681
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,560
Trust me. You won't waste your time.

682
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,710
Are you sure?

683
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,810
It doesn't look so special.

684
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:40,110
Could it be

685
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:41,710
that your parents were slaves too?

686
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:42,990
Did they pass this skill down to you?

687
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:44,420
I'm an orphan.

688
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:45,100
I don't have parents.

689
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:47,410
Who could have passed this skill down to me?

690
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:48,850
Let's just dig into it.

691
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:50,850
Okay. I trust Bai Cai.

692
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:51,810
Okay.

693
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:18,330
Bai Cai, you're amazing.

694
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:19,230
Great.

695
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:20,820
We can meet our quotas.

696
00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:21,450
Maybe

697
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:23,310
we can even be rewarded with meat.

698
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:31,620
Hurry up.

699
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:32,970
Keep up. Move!

700
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:33,700
Hurry.

701
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:35,650
Stop dawdling.

702
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:36,610
Keep moving.

703
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:37,600
Hurry! Get in!

704
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:38,570
Hurry.

705
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:41,810
Don't dawdle!

706
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:43,020
You, come here.

Gou, let it go.

00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:18,690
I'm fine.

746
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:19,490
Go back now.

as long as there is sunlight,

00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:31,870
it can thrive.

00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:00,810
♫Escorting the warmth across the river♫

768
00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:06,550
♫Lighting up the spring in the future♫

769
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,130
It's been so long since I came here.

770
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:49,550
I wonder what the outside world

771
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:51,580
is like now.

772
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,140
Boss, it's enough.

773
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:10,850
Okay.

774
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:14,290
What's wrong with you?

775
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:15,820
Are these all the bloodstones

776
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:16,770
you dug up today?

777
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:18,970
He's sick.

778
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:20,050
I heard him coughing badly

779
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:22,110
when he was digging for bloodstones.

780
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:24,850
Can you keep working or not?

781
00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:26,310
You're coughing so badly.

782
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:28,370
Gou.

783
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:30,420
He once robbed your food.

784
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:31,630
Besides, when Bai Cai was sick,

785
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:32,780
it was he who told on you.

786
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:33,910
You want to help him?

787
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,010
-Can you keep working or not?
-Gou.

788
00:40:36,010 --> 00:40:37,010
If you can't,

789
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:38,310
I'll throw you into the mass grave.

790
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:38,850
Hold on. Hold on.

791
00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:40,090
Calm down.

792
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:40,960
Calm down.

793
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:43,620
We dug up a lot of bloodstones today.

794
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:45,560
I'll make up for his shortage.

795
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:55,180
It's enough now, right?

796
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:57,660
Why?

797
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,040
We're all slaves.

798
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,540
We should help each other.

799
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:02,250
But what I did to you…

800
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:03,680
Let bygones be bygones.

801
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:05,810
If we don't team up

802
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:07,150
and keep hurting each other,

803
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:08,810
life here will be even harder.

804
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:16,320
You love playing hero, don't you?

805
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:17,370
Fine.

806
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:18,780
From now on, whenever someone can't meet their quota,

807
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:20,580
you'll make up for the shortage.

808
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:21,990
Weigh the bloodstones.

809
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,160
What are you cooking?

810
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:39,530
These are morning glory seeds.

811
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:40,520
They're

812
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,760
slightly toxic.

813
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:42,980
But after being boiled in water,

814
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:44,330
they can be used as cough medicine.

815
00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:45,730
The slave just now

816
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:46,500
coughed so badly.

817
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,230
After I'm done here,

818
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:48,490
bring the seeds to him.

819
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:53,270
I didn't know you knew this.

820
00:41:55,950 --> 00:41:56,880
You used to

821
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:58,450
go up mountains

822
00:41:58,450 --> 00:41:59,900
to pick herbs with me.

823
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,600
Yeah. I remember that.

824
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:11,010
By the way,

825
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:12,020
do you remember

826
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:13,930
Prince Wu Geng of Xin State?
