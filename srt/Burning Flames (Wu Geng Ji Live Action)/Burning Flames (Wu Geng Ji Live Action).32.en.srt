[Episode 32]

4
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:39,509
So he didn't hang you up?

5
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,750
He didn't dare!

6
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:44,050
He was just trying to scare me.

7
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:44,850
However,

8
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,350
now, everyone at the mine

9
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:48,020
believes I got hung up.

10
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:51,930
Mr. Chen is so thoughtful.

11
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,979
Since you've come out,

12
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,860
there must be something Mr. Chen

13
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,180
wants you to tell me.

14
00:01:58,210 --> 00:01:59,009
No!

15
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:00,380
No?

16
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:03,880
Master, my father wants to see you.

17
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,600
Let's go.

18
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:10,350
Wait.

19
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,300
Take the secret passage.

20
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:13,240
Secret passage?

21
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:14,910
I mean the tunnel

22
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:16,030
you dug.

23
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:17,860
Stupid!

24
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,000
Master, let's go. Let's go.

25
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,660
Your Highness.

26
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:28,010
Your Majesty.

27
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:30,400
Now that you've killed Gui Mu,

28
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,460
the late king can rest in peace.

29
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,310
With you here,

30
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:34,230
Bai State won't be oppressed

31
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:36,310
by the Immortal Clan anymore.

32
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:38,850
Murder!

33
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:39,950
Murder!

34
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:10,760
Why is that divine power

35
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:13,160
so similar to Bai Cai's?

36
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:25,630
Sir.

37
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:30,490
I heard that

38
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:33,510
bandits have been lurking around at night lately.

39
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:35,350
No one dares to go out.

40
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:36,960
Where are you going?

41
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:38,280
Miss,

42
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,220
I've also heard

43
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,300
about those bandits.

44
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,110
But a while ago,

45
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:48,070
I was injured by the divine power of a Grand Immortal.

46
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,829
I haven't fully recovered yet.

47
00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:53,590
It hurts so much here at night.

48
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,270
So I decided

49
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:56,920
to come out

50
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,380
to try my luck.

51
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:59,930
See if I can find a doctor.

52
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:03,990
Is that so?

53
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,840
Well, let me treat you.

54
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:16,260
You're that fairy

55
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,510
who can cure diseases,

56
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:19,029
right?

57
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:22,380
Great! Great!

58
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,260
Here.

59
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:25,560
Take my pulse. Take my pulse.

60
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:29,560
Thank you, miss.

61
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,390
Sure enough, someone

62
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:44,520
is impersonating me to commit murder.

63
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,780
No. If that's the case,

64
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,620
that old man will die.

65
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,280
Bai Cai.

66
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:58,030
What's holding you back?

67
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:01,410
Does it scare you so much

68
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,830
to become one with me?

69
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,580
If I help him,

70
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:11,800
I'll become an entirely different person,

71
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,990
and Gou and I

72
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,130
will have no future at all,

73
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:14,890
right?

74
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:16,720
Yes.

75
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:19,630
Whether this insignificant man lives or dies

76
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:21,530
is none of your business.

77
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:52,130
Leave.

78
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:54,050
Leave!

79
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:13,270
Master, why didn't you feed me?

80
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,370
I'm going to eat you!

81
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:17,480
I'm so hungry!

82
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:19,790
Oh, no.

83
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:21,630
I've lost control of the Spirit Eater.

84
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:24,000
You helped him after all.

85
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:25,870
Don't provoke me!

86
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:28,010
Gou is fighting for the whole world.

87
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:28,740
How can I

88
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:30,700
let personal feelings shackle me?

89
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:53,680
What's with the divine power

90
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,670
in your body?

91
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,380
You're not Bai Cai.

92
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:02,770
If I had just watched him die,

93
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:03,950
how could I

94
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:05,840
be worthy of Gou?

95
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:43,450
Who on earth are you?

96
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:48,940
Both heaven and earth

97
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:51,000
originate from the crystal.

98
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:53,510
It has all three realms in it

99
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:55,440
and nurtures all immortals.

100
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,070
The five saints revere it.

101
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,250
All immortals worship it.

102
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:02,890
Through cultivation and tribulation,

103
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:05,140
one can see my omnipotence.

104
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:07,090
The crystal…

105
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,300
I see.

106
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:15,980
This is the true meaning of that prophecy.

107
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,470
You were actually threatened

108
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:19,870
by your own Spirit Eater.

109
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:22,290
As the high priest of the Immortal Realm,

110
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:24,710
you're far weaker than your predecessors.

111
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:29,410
Your Divinity, there must be a reason why you manifested yourself.

112
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:30,610
Please enlighten me.

113
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:39,010
My mission

114
00:08:39,549 --> 00:08:41,299
is to maintain order.

115
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,159
Your Divinity,

116
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:45,300
a rebel called Wu Geng

117
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,860
killed immortals and defied the Immortal Clan.

118
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,720
I don't care about the Immortal Clan.

119
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,540
My mission is to maintain the Heaven Way.

120
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:54,570
Anyone who goes against it,

121
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:57,420
whether they're humans or immortals,

122
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:00,040
has to be punished.

123
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,820
That's exactly what Wu Geng did.

124
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:04,630
He attempts to attack the Immortal Realm

125
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:06,270
and has disrupted the order between humans and immortals.

126
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:07,470
He's thrown his lot

127
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:08,550
in with the Shenyin Clan

128
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:09,830
and aspires to subvert the Heaven Way

129
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:10,390
and rebuild the world.

130
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:12,550
I know everything

131
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:14,420
this body knows.

132
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,930
So save your breath.

133
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:20,510
Who's there?

134
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:34,510
Guards! This way!

135
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:45,540
Take her down!

136
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:02,630
After what happened tonight,

137
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:05,030
Wu Geng will surely misunderstand Bai Cai.

138
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:09,390
Why haven't we met anyone

139
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:10,790
on our way here?

140
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:12,380
Everyone's taken the day off.

141
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,840
Now, the slaves don't need to work

142
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,160
on full moons,

143
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:17,030
half moons, and new moons.

144
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,320
Father has realized

145
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,830
that Gou's idea is great.

146
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:21,840
When the slaves can take breaks,

147
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:24,050
they work even harder.

148
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:25,780
The output of bloodstone has increased drastically.

149
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,180
So, Father just let it be.

150
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:29,340
That's great.

151
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:31,000
Not only that,

152
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,620
but we also have cabbage stuffing

153
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:33,630
in our buns now.

154
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:36,290
We even get to eat meat on our days off.

155
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:37,110
Meat?

156
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:39,150
Wu Geng.

157
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,510
Thanks to you,

158
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:41,980
the lives of the people here

159
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,190
have improved a lot.

160
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:47,530
After I defeat the Immortal Clan,

161
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:48,960
I'll free all the slaves

162
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:50,310
in the world.

163
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,600
Mr. Chen Jing said

164
00:10:58,630 --> 00:10:59,910
only Gou could go in.

165
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:00,830
The others have to stay outside.

166
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:01,230
Gou.

167
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,390
I can't go in either?

168
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,390
Sorry, Young Master.

169
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:05,740
That's Mr. Chen's order.

170
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:06,420
I…

171
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:08,520
Wait for me outside.

172
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:12,200
Don't worry. Everything will be fine.

173
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:44,430
Come on. Let's…

174
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,390
So petty.

175
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,220
At the Northern Mountain Mine,

176
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:58,080
we don't serve wine to outsiders.

177
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:00,260
Mr. Chen, why are you so sure

178
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:01,830
that I'm an outsider?

179
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:06,410
Mr. Chen, if you

180
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:07,960
wanted to stand against me,

181
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:08,910
you wouldn't have

182
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,230
let me in just now.

183
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,580
Gou.

184
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:14,470
Two things.

185
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,380
First,

186
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,040
you kidnapped Zhazha

187
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:21,710
and released 3,000 slaves

188
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:22,910
from my mine.

189
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:24,790
How should we settle that score?

190
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:26,900
I was wrong

191
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:28,830
in kidnapping Zhazha.

192
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:31,200
But I had no choice.

193
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:32,750
Mr. Chen, I'd be grateful

194
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,080
if you could forgive me.

195
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:36,640
However,

196
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:38,930
I'll never regret

197
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:41,020
releasing the slaves.

198
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:54,190
We're even now.

199
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:01,470
You're big-hearted.

200
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,390
What's the second thing?

201
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,130
Second,

202
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:11,190
the help you want from me,

203
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:12,870
I can't give it to you.

204
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:19,780
Zhazha has told me

205
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,800
why you came here.

206
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:22,500
I can let bygones

207
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,940
be bygones.

208
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:26,090
But the thing you're going to do,

209
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:28,170
I want no part of it.

210
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,200
Are you really willing

211
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:31,940
to be trampled on by the Immortal Clan

212
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:33,070
for your whole life?

213
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:37,960
I, Chen Jing,

214
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:40,360
was born to be the immortals' servant.

215
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,000
It's my honor

216
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,430
to be trampled on by them.

217
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:45,140
Do you really think so?

218
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:47,200
It doesn't matter what I think.

219
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:48,990
Look at you.

220
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,740
You've lost all your divine power.

221
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,480
Do you think I can't see it?

222
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:55,750
You're so weak now.

223
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:58,990
How are you going to rebel against the immortals?

224
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:01,630
Your priority should be staying alive.

225
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:04,050
There's wisdom in neutrality.

226
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,150
Maybe

227
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:07,060
you have to be my age

228
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:08,750
to understand it.

229
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:11,310
The world is about to change.

230
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:12,970
Mr. Chen,

231
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:15,330
you're in the center of the storm.

232
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:17,480
How can you possibly stay neutral?

233
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:36,980
Since you've made up your mind,

234
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,080
I'll quit persuading you.

235
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:41,110
I understand

236
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:42,950
why you're hesitating.

237
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:45,980
It's because

238
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,430
you don't want Zhazha to get hurt.

239
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:49,910
Neither do I.

240
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:51,000
I don't want Zhazha

241
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,330
to get involved either.

242
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:54,000
I can promise you

243
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:55,860
that no matter

244
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:57,950
what decisions you'll make,

245
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,580
whether

246
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,220
we'll be friends or foes,

247
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:03,750
if Zhazha

248
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:05,270
is in danger,

249
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,960
I'll protect him with my life.

250
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:36,470
Zhazha.

251
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,840
Do you remember

252
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,160
that a while ago,

253
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:42,290
a slave called Gou

254
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:43,500
secretly dug

255
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,760
a tunnel

256
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:47,840
leading out of the mine?

257
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:49,500
I remember.

258
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:50,670
Later,

259
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:52,370
in order to prevent the slaves

260
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,410
from escaping,

261
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:56,030
you sealed that tunnel.

262
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:58,550
Do you think

263
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:01,200
there are slaves

264
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,910
hiding there?

265
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,390
If there were really people

266
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:06,470
hiding there,

267
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:08,920
I would never find out.

268
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:11,430
No.

269
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,110
That place is no longer part of the mine.

270
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,780
We won't send anyone to patrol it.

271
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:22,110
Thank you.

272
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,170
Zhazha.

273
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:25,660
Let's go.

274
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:33,090
Lan. Send out the contact butterfly.

275
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:49,170
General An.

276
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:50,910
Everything's settled at the Northern Mountain Mine.

277
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:53,010
Light the Immortal-Averting Incense on the road.

278
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:54,710
After the army enters the mine,

279
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:55,910
split it into small groups.

280
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:57,130
The soldiers will go undercover

281
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:58,700
in the mine as slaves

282
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:00,730
and wait for further instructions.

283
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:07,460
General An.

284
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:09,750
What's wrong?

285
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:10,869
Bai Cai asked me

286
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:12,310
to give you this.

287
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,560
General An.

288
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:23,180
Please take care of those children.

289
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:28,650
What's wrong

290
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:30,720
with Ms. Bai?

291
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:32,870
Boys, gather around.

292
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,050
I'll send the kids to Shenyin Village first.

293
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:38,720
After that,

294
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,430
I'll meet you at the mine.

295
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:41,760
Director Zhang.

296
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:43,600
Be careful on the road.

297
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,420
I will.

298
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:46,700
Get ready to roll.

299
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:47,840
Yes!

300
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:58,220
General An has set off.

301
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:59,090
Director Zhang is with the army.

302
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:00,030
After they arrive at the mine,

303
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:02,090
we can start making ships right away.

304
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,510
Good.

305
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:13,000
What are you doing here?

306
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:14,830
What?

307
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:16,670
You mean,

308
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:18,620
someone with Crystal Power

309
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:20,030
appeared in the Bai capital

310
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:21,490
and killed lots of people?

311
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:22,730
Crystal Power

312
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,140
is supposed

313
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:25,070
to only be possessed by Ms. Bai Cai.

314
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:27,760
What did Zhou Qiao say about it?

315
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,510
Prince Zhou Qiao

316
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:30,630
would like to ask

317
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:31,930
your opinion about it.

318
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,560
My opinion?

319
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:34,960
It's a false rumor, of course.

320
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,470
You're wise, Prince Wu Geng.

321
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:37,630
Prince Zhou Qiao agreed.

322
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:39,870
He carefully examined the victims' wounds

323
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:40,950
and found them

324
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:42,310
very similar to the wounds

325
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:43,070
left by Ms. Bai Cai's Crystal Power.

326
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:45,930
However, he believes it was not Ms. Bai Cai's doing.

327
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:49,190
It could be that some people still haven't given up

328
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:50,270
driving a wedge

329
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:53,200
between Ms. Bai Cai and the anti-immortal alliance.

330
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:55,150
Zhou Qiao is smart this time.

331
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:58,280
I'm afraid Sage Hall is also planning something.

332
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,280
We need to hurry back to the Bai capital

333
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,660
to meet Bai Cai and Zhou Qiao

334
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:03,150
and then go back to Shenyin Village.

335
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:04,790
There's a barrier around Shenyin Village.

336
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:06,390
The immortals can't find us.

337
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:07,810
Okay.

338
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:11,840
Lan.

339
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:13,370
Can I

340
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,690
ask you a favor?

341
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:16,900
If one day,

342
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:18,330
I hurt Wu Geng,

343
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:21,550
can you please kill me?

344
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,310
What's wrong?

345
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:34,830
Let's go.

346
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:42,300
What a waste of time.

347
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:44,500
I knew she couldn't be trusted.

348
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,130
We went easy on her

349
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:47,740
and brought disaster to ourselves!

350
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:48,720
Bai Cai.

351
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,320
What's wrong with you?

352
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:52,310
These immortals are all traitors.

353
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:54,710
They're the enemies of the Immortal Realm.

354
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:56,630
Help me, Your Divinity.

355
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:59,470
I can't see in them any signs

356
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:01,400
of the Heaven Way being disrupted.

357
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:05,200
These lesser beings can't amount to much.

358
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:08,110
Why should I bother to deal with them?

359
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:09,500
Darn it.

360
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:10,600
She actually

361
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,340
can't be of any help.

362
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:23,750
The barrier was built

363
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,270
with an ancient secret spell.

364
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:25,950
It can only be opened

365
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:26,950
from the inside.

366
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:27,880
After the people outside

367
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,180
burn Dragon Whale Incense,

368
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:31,510
those inside will see it and open the door.

369
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:32,710
Clan Leader Kong Que

370
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:35,070
has only told this method to Bai Cai.

371
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:44,270
It looks like someone has gotten in.

372
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:47,070
Kong Que.

373
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,380
Clan Leader Kong Que.

374
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:50,590
The village. Hurry.

375
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,290
Kong Que.

376
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:20,470
Being too stupid

377
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:22,930
is also against the Heaven Way.

378
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:27,170
You want Wu Geng to misunderstand me.

379
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:28,590
Do you think

380
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:30,840
I can't see through your little trick?

381
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:32,680
I just chose

382
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:34,730
to turn a blind eye.

383
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:42,950
Eat them all!

384
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:50,240
Bai Cai.

385
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:52,910
Why do you want us dead?

386
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:05,720
I'll kill you!

387
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:01,240
Bai Cai.

388
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:03,870
What happened to you?

389
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,470
She must've been bewitched

390
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:07,670
by some divine power.

391
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:09,540
In you, I do see signs

392
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:10,870
of the Heaven Way

393
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,430
being changed.

394
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:13,470
It seems that

395
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:15,830
you're destined to die at my hands.

396
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,080
Bai Cai, wake up.

397
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:24,140
It's me!

398
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:26,310
You're so foolish.

399
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:28,410
At this point,

400
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:30,400
you still don't know who I am.

401
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:32,840
The Heaven Way is constant.

402
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:35,150
The Crystal Mountain forever exists.

403
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:36,680
It doesn't alter for humans

404
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:38,250
or immortals.

405
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:39,760
Is she

406
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:41,830
the spirit of Crystal Mountain?

407
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:43,760
Wu Geng, get out of here!

408
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:45,180
She's not Bai Cai anymore.

409
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:46,630
She's the spirit of Crystal Mountain.

410
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:47,510
Go!

411
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:54,510
Gou.

412
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,760
Gou, stay back.

413
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:58,170
Gou, leave.

414
00:24:58,470 --> 00:24:59,400
Leave!

415
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:00,790
Bai Cai.

416
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:05,360
It's you.

417
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:08,070
You're actually still with me.

418
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:11,070
Gou!

419
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,270
Zi Dian.

420
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:32,690
Wu Geng has no divine power now.

421
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:34,030
I'll deal with her.

422
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:35,010
You get Wu Geng out of here.

423
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,150
I'll hold her back.

424
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:37,340
You two leave now!

425
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:38,790
Keep Wu Geng safe.

426
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:40,200
I'm not going anywhere.

427
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,240
Bai Cai.

428
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:45,560
It's me.

429
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:50,910
She can't recognize you.

430
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:51,710
Go.

431
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:54,860
Bai Cai.

432
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:58,430
I'm your Gou.

433
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:03,950
You promised

434
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:06,650
never to abandon me

435
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:08,870
no matter what I became.

436
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:10,850
I'll do the same.

437
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:13,130
No matter what you become,

438
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:15,120
I won't walk away from you.

439
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:22,040
Bai Cai.

440
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:36,030
Gou. Gou.

441
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:46,640
Gou.

442
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:48,810
Gou, help me.

443
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,590
Gou.

444
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,220
Gou.

445
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:13,630
Gou.

446
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:34,580
You were not my target.

447
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:38,150
But since you're trying to disrupt the Heaven Way,

448
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:43,360
I have no choice but to kill you.

449
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:09,140
Zi Dian.

450
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,680
Stay alive.

451
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:38,120
Zi Dian.

452
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:40,940
Zi Dian!

453
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:21,270
Lan!

454
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:49,740
Father.

455
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:51,690
Did you see that?

456
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:54,030
The man you put

457
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:55,660
hope and trust in,

458
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:58,720
Prince Wu Geng who you care so much about,

459
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:02,080
the God of War who you think can topple the King of Immortals,

460
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:04,470
will no longer exist in the world

461
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:07,150
from now on.

462
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:38,410
You killed Gou.

463
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:40,590
You killed Gou.

464
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:42,840
I killed him, or you did.

465
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:44,830
What's the difference?

466
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,320
Yeah.

467
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:48,870
I killed him.

468
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:51,180
I killed Gou.

469
00:32:54,670 --> 00:32:56,000
I want you dead!

470
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:58,470
You'll die with me!

471
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:08,770
Gou.

472
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:18,220
What are you doing?

473
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:22,220
What are you doing?

474
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:26,140
Gou.

475
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:27,470
Stop.

476
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,650
Stop!

477
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:33,970
Stop!

478
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:51,830
Now that Wu Geng is dead,

479
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:55,910
the alliance of the three realms has become leaderless.

480
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:57,510
Just a bunch of riffraff.

481
00:33:57,530 --> 00:33:58,930
They're no threat at all.

482
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:02,890
All the obstacles in the way of the King of Immortals

483
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:06,970
will disappear.

484
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,790
A catastrophe is coming.

485
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:34,940
A catastrophe is coming.

486
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:40,860
A catastrophe is coming!

487
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:11,170
[Bei]

488
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:37,340
Whale,

489
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:38,990
thank you for bringing me to the shore.

490
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:39,920
Go back now.

491
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,120
I've never seen

492
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:11,030
such strange divine power.

493
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,500
Ancestor,

494
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:04,180
please tell me

495
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:06,040
how I can save him.

496
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:35,360
I see.

497
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:37,790
I don't have a cure

498
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:39,590
for the strange ice poison in your body,

499
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:40,310
but I can transfer it

500
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:41,590
into my body.

501
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:51,430
Who are you?

502
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:52,940
You woke up.

503
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:57,030
You're badly injured. Stay still.

504
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:02,520
You saved me.

505
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:04,890
When I found you

506
00:39:04,890 --> 00:39:05,960
on the shore,

507
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:08,190
you were dying.

508
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:09,400
Luckily, I'm smart

509
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,130
and thought of a way to save you.

510
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:12,670
But

511
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:15,310
because I'm going through a tribulation,

512
00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:18,100
I can only alleviate your pain for now.

513
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,270
I can't completely heal you.

514
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:29,370
Thank you.

515
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,470
You spent a lot of divine power

516
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:34,910
saving me.

517
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:36,920
That must be why you're so weak.

518
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:38,590
I'm fine.

519
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:41,030
If you want to thank someone,

520
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:42,090
thank the ancestor

521
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,380
of the Sea Spirit Clan.

522
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:45,360
The Sea Spirit Clan?

523
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:13,800
That bubble just now

524
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:14,930
is unique to the Sea Spirit Clan.

525
00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:16,350
It creates a space full of air

526
00:40:16,350 --> 00:40:18,810
and allows people to travel freely in water.

527
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:25,760
What is this place?

528
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:29,870
It's the forbidden place of the Sea Spirit Clan:

529
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:30,670
Sealed Abyss.

530
00:40:34,570 --> 00:40:36,400
I forgot to introduce myself.

531
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:37,550
My name is Bei.

532
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:40,320
I'm the youngest daughter of the Sea Spirit King.

533
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,260
Princess Bei.

534
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:44,030
I heard that

535
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:45,590
the Sea Spirit Clan

536
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:47,670
has been guarding the Immortal Realm for generations

537
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:50,400
and is the most loyal friend of the Immortal Clan.

538
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:52,670
The Immortal Clan's friend?

539
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:54,360
In the immortals' eyes,

540
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:54,910
we're just

541
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:56,430
their watchdogs.

542
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:09,630
Like the human race,

543
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:11,180
the Sea Spirit Clan

544
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:12,750
has been living under the oppression

545
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:14,550
of the Immortal Clan for 100,000 years.

546
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:16,480
Our lives can't be more miserable.

547
00:41:17,270 --> 00:41:18,350
A long time ago,

548
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:20,310
the Sea Spirit Clan

549
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:21,670
was the ruler of the sea.

550
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:24,590
At that time, we were on good terms with the Immortal Clan

551
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:26,350
and lived a peaceful life.

552
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:28,710
But 100,000 years ago,

553
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:30,910
a war broke out in the Immortal Clan.

554
00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:32,790
Hei Long killed and sealed

555
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:34,060
all the ancient immortals,

556
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:36,060
becoming the new King of Immortals.

557
00:41:36,310 --> 00:41:38,790
In order to rule over all the creatures in the three realms,

558
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:40,250
he brought war everywhere

559
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:42,490
and attacked the Sea Spirit Clan too.

560
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:45,590
Hei Long wanted the Sea Spirit Clan

561
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:47,390
to surrender to the Immortal Clan

562
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:48,670
and relinquish the Sea Realm

563
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:50,310
where we lived for generations

564
00:41:50,310 --> 00:41:52,350
as a barrier to defend the Immortal Realm.

565
00:41:52,350 --> 00:41:53,540
You just agreed?

566
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:56,150
No.

567
00:41:58,510 --> 00:41:59,870
The ancestor of the Sea Spirit Clan

568
00:41:59,870 --> 00:42:01,930
led the people to fight back bravely,

569
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:03,390
but they ended up

570
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:05,650
being slaughtered by the Immortal Clan.

571
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,030
Even my ancestor

572
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:10,590
was beheaded too.
