[Episode 22]

4
00:01:38,229 --> 00:01:40,270
Among the 13 Generals of the Demon Clan,

5
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:41,190
12 are currently

6
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:42,390
under your command.

7
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:44,690
In the words of the people,

8
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,140
you beat them up

9
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:47,630
until

10
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:49,110
they surrender.

11
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,830
This method is crude

12
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,270
but effective.

13
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:55,830
Why didn't you

14
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:57,870
use it on Qiongxiong Ji'e?

15
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,330
With other generals,

16
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:04,710
it's a duel.

17
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:08,400
But Qiongxiong Ji'e has his own army

18
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:09,990
and many followers.

19
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,270
Attacking him

20
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,870
would trigger a great war.

21
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:18,990
And our grudge can't be resolved

22
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:22,150
with just

23
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,630
a duel.

24
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,550
Is it related to your dead brother?

25
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:32,750
My brother

26
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:34,070
Haikuo Tiankong

27
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:35,910
was once the best leader

28
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:37,510
of the demon clan.

29
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:40,829
He knew that to be strong,

30
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:41,920
we had to be united.

31
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:44,690
In order to resolve the war of the demons,

32
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:46,110
he found

33
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:47,860
the leaders of 13 tribes

34
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,740
and subdued them one by one.

35
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:55,470
The strongest among them

36
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,150
was Qiongxiong Ji'e.

37
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:03,200
♫Why don't you go with them?♫

38
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,750
♫Let wind and sand swallow you up♫

39
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:06,960
♫This desert is so vast♫

40
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:10,290
♫It's beyond the horizon♫

41
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:12,510
♫The sky is boundless♫

42
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:17,000
♫The land is a river made of desolation♫

43
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:15,590
My brother defeated Qiongxiong Ji'e

44
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,030
with his absolute power.

45
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:20,410
♫And what are you?♫

46
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:18,829
My brother overlooked the past

47
00:03:18,829 --> 00:03:20,240
and took him in.

48
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:23,270
From then on, Qiongxiong Ji'e swore to follow him

49
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:25,130
♫People are so small♫

50
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:25,790
to become the most ferocious general

51
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:29,720
♫Still waiting for the lost sparks♫

52
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:27,910
of the 13 Generals.

53
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:31,310
When I was 16,

54
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:37,800
♫Go straight, believe, and look up♫

55
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,510
I sneaked into the Immortal Realm

56
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:35,110
and stole the Flower of Dawn.

57
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,750
And my brother

58
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,150
was also the Grand Marshal

59
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:39,280
of the Demon Clan.

60
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:40,900
To save me,

61
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:43,310
he was attacked by Shen Yan.

62
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:47,510
Qiongxiong Ji'e

63
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,480
respected my brother the most.

64
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:51,790
He knew there was no hope for revenge.

65
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:53,520
So he blamed my brother's death

66
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,829
on me.

67
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:58,620
From then on, the Demon Realm was split up.

68
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,390
Until I became the Grand Marshal

69
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,560
and started subduing and uniting

70
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:04,990
the factions.

71
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:07,390
I've experienced

72
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:09,750
the pain of losing family.

73
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:11,670
It's not your fault.

74
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:15,830
Now that the seal is broken,

75
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,230
we'll be able to invade

76
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:19,430
Immortal Realm soon.

77
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:21,390
We have the same goal.

78
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:24,470
As the saying goes,

79
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:26,110
many a little makes a mickle.

80
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:28,030
Against the Immortal Realm,

81
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:29,430
every bit of help

82
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:30,910
counts.

83
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:34,470
Gou.

84
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:36,550
As the Grand Marshal,

85
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:37,630
I promise you,

86
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:39,430
we demons

87
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:41,070
are your most loyal

88
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:42,300
comrades.

89
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,270
It's still

90
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:50,270
not enough.

91
00:04:50,909 --> 00:04:52,550
To truly win,

92
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:54,430
we must join forces

93
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:55,890
with every possible ally.

94
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,800
Are you talking about

95
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:03,070
Shenyin Clan?

96
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:04,910
You know?

97
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:05,740
Since the first time

98
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,230
I saw your friend,

99
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:09,350
I knew she's an immortal.

100
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,510
They were all once

101
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,150
persecuted by Hei Long.

102
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:13,750
Just like us,

103
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:16,030
they hate Immortal Realm.

104
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:18,840
Although they had defected from Immortal Realm,

105
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,400
they're still immortals.

106
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:22,310
My clan can't accept

107
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:24,110
cooperating with them,

108
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:25,510
be it in terms of

109
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,470
chivalry or emotions.

110
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:29,750
But to me,

111
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:32,390
they're my most loyal comrades.

112
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:33,550
Gou.

113
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:35,680
I'm sorry.

114
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:38,270
As the Grand Marshal of the Demon Clan,

115
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:38,950
I must consider

116
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,350
my clansmen's feelings.

117
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:42,290
This concerns the battle.

118
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:43,970
I won't tell anyone

119
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:45,230
about

120
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:46,630
your friend's identity.

121
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,670
In Mount Zheluo,

122
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,720
I saw these decent realgar pieces,

123
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:17,470
so I brought you some.

124
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:43,390
I thought

125
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:45,050
you forgot this place.

126
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:47,090
How could it be?

127
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,760
Does it hurt here?

128
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:12,520
Here?

129
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:14,230
Does it hurt?

130
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:22,750
Take off your mask and let me see.

131
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,480
It's indeed better

132
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,950
than before.

133
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,310
In my current condition,

134
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:48,550
how long can I last?

135
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:51,000
Even with the aid of the Fire Bodhi,

136
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,330
your actual situation

137
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:54,310
is more serious than you think.

138
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:55,670
The petrified area

139
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:57,520
has been embedded in the organ.

140
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,600
Even if I can help you persist

141
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,130
until the day of the attack,

142
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,590
I can't guarantee

143
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:05,490
you wouldn't perish on the battlefield.

144
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:14,090
I'm the Grand Marshal.

145
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:16,870
I will never

146
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:20,150
perish.

147
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:22,390
But once you use your demonic power,

148
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:24,070
your condition will get worse.

149
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:24,710
I don't want to

150
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:26,440
remind you about this anymore.

151
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:27,410
Grand Marshal.

152
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:30,550
I know.

153
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,100
Is the war finally starting?

154
00:08:42,809 --> 00:08:43,789
Yes.

155
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,740
The war is finally about to start.

156
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,510
I, General Muwu Biaoqing,

157
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:53,950
am hereby asking for your permission.

158
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,470
Please allow me

159
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:57,200
to join the anti-immortal camp

160
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:58,710
as a war medic.

161
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:02,870
Mu,

162
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,230
all these years,

163
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:07,270
if it weren't for you,

164
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,710
I wouldn't be alive today.

165
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:14,680
It's their honor to have you

166
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:16,870
in the anti-immortal army.

167
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:32,910
It's you?

168
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,230
Why are you spying on

169
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,350
Grand Marshal?

170
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,430
You're an immortal?

171
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,670
Why did you sneak into the Demon Realm?

172
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:17,210
I have no ill intentions towards demons.

173
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:18,710
I'm here for Gou.

174
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:21,270
All you immortals

175
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:23,230
are self-righteous and deceitful.

176
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:24,110
You must be

177
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:25,430
a spy sent by them!

178
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:26,810
No, listen to me!

179
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:44,330
Dragon Fang Warriors?

180
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:57,780
Leave her here!

181
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,810
Night Light Slash!

182
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,060
Ms. Lan, hang in there!

183
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:13,990
Man!

184
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:17,910
Your face...

185
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:20,270
Get Gou to the clinic now.

186
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,280
This Dragon Fang dart was poisoned.

187
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:43,990
If it were any later

188
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:45,940
and it invaded the heart,

189
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:47,830
it would have been incurable.

190
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,550
She's safe now.

191
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:55,710
I gave her some medicine.

192
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:58,070
I'm afraid she needs to sleep for a few more hours.

193
00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:59,270
What happened?

194
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:00,510
Who hurt her?

195
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:03,430
Qiongxiong Ji'e's men.

196
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,020
When I was fighting with her,

197
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,020
we were

198
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:08,670
caught off guard.

199
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:15,270
You two,

200
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:16,740
please come out with me.

201
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:24,870
General Suifeng,

202
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,550
what did Lan do wrong?

203
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:27,950
Why did you attack her?

204
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:29,550
Why did I attack her?

205
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,030
She sneaks around the Demon Realm

206
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:32,350
while hiding her identity as an immortal.

207
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:33,670
She must be up to something.

208
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,200
It's true that Lan is an immortal.

209
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:35,830
But you're

210
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:37,470
making groundless

211
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:38,910
accusations!

212
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:39,750
I saw her spying on Grand Marshal

213
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:40,950
with my own eyes.

214
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:41,710
How is it groundless?

215
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:42,390
Enough!

216
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:44,830
The alliance has yet to be formed

217
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:46,390
and there's already an internal strife?

218
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,430
Wu, go back

219
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:49,430
and reflect on yourself.

220
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:50,310
Grand Marshal.

221
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:51,110
Go.

222
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:06,670
Gou.

223
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:08,550
I take full responsibility

224
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:09,910
for what happened.

225
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,510
I didn't teach my subordinates well.

226
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:14,590
If you really want to form an alliance,

227
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:16,270
you shouldn't let your men

228
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:18,150
doubt and hurt my friends.

229
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:20,150
The grudge

230
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,590
between the demons and immortals

231
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:23,790
is 100,000 years old.

232
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:25,970
The Immortal Clan killed demons

233
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:29,470
and forced them to live underground.

234
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:31,910
Demons of all ages

235
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:34,880
were infected with Petrification Sickness.

236
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:36,000
It's impossible

237
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,550
to ask them to forget

238
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:38,810
such painful memories

239
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:40,510
in a short time.

240
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,190
Hei Long caused this misery.

241
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:45,380
What does it have to do

242
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:46,870
with Shenyin Clan and Lan?

243
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:47,710
I know.

244
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:49,430
You only care about the demon clan.

245
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:50,760
There's nothing wrong.

246
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:52,310
But in the three realms,

247
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:53,830
there are other clans.

248
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,230
I want to ally with you

249
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:57,190
for the sake of

250
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:58,600
all who are oppressed.

251
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:01,190
Trust is most important in alliances.

252
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:02,310
Like this,

253
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:04,390
how can you talk about sharing weal and woe

254
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:05,510
and fighting enemies?

255
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:06,310
Gou.

256
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:08,550
I will never forget

257
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,300
your kindness to our clan.

258
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,310
Trust me.

259
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:13,790
My sword

260
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:15,030
will only kill Hei Long.

261
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:16,360
I won't hurt my friends.

262
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:20,720
Grand Marshal.

263
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:22,900
To kill Hei Long,

264
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:24,430
our alliance

265
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:25,870
must be sturdy.

266
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:28,910
Hei Long must be killed in one blow.

267
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:31,230
Our power

268
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:32,190
is not enough.

269
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:34,780
We need the Demon Clan,

270
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:36,790
Shenyin Clan, human race,

271
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:37,710
and

272
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:38,670
all oppressed people

273
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,030
to unite.

274
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:41,650
Do you understand?

275
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:45,030
Let me ask you.

276
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:47,230
Will the Shenyin Clan

277
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:49,230
trust the Demon Clan completely?

278
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:50,130
Grand Marshal.

279
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,400
Since I'm here

280
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:54,320
to discuss about taking down Hei Long

281
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,980
and invading Immortal Realm,

282
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,870
I’m confident

283
00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:59,310
I can persuade Shenyin Clan

284
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:00,830
to let go of any prejudice

285
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:02,670
and form an alliance with the demons.

286
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:04,430
If you really want to form an alliance,

287
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:05,910
you should be determined.

288
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:09,710
Okay.

289
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:11,350
Gou.

290
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:13,430
To take down Hei Long,

291
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:15,430
and for my men,

292
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:17,630
I promise you

293
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:20,000
what happened today

294
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:22,030
will never happen again.

295
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:24,590
Okay.

296
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:26,790
I trust you this time.

297
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:29,870
The future of the Demon Clan

298
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:32,120
should be decided by you,

299
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:33,670
the Grand Marshal.

300
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:48,990
A liar sells their soul.

301
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:51,790
You knew the Immortal Clan is spreading rumors

302
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:53,390
but chose to feign ignorance

303
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:56,230
and used it to win over the people's hearts.

304
00:15:58,430 --> 00:15:59,350
Nitian Erxing.

305
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:02,110
You think you're protecting

306
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:03,240
your people's hope,

307
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:05,550
but you're just

308
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:06,910
promising them

309
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:08,070
an illusory future.

310
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:10,630
And many of them

311
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,390
have to

312
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,230
die for this.

313
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:19,320
How did you find out?

314
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:21,870
My mother's Kongshi Realm's divine power

315
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:22,950
unintentionally connected

316
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:25,830
to Haikuo Tiankong's remaining divine consciousness.

317
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:27,270
So I found out the truth.

318
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:29,910
As per my brother's instructions,

319
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:32,010
you kept the secret of the Flower of Dawn.

320
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:32,910
This is the choice you made

321
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:34,110
for your clan.

322
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:36,190
I understand it.

323
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,230
But I don't agree with it.

324
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:39,750
In my opinion,

325
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,250
in the three realms,

326
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:42,950
all living beings

327
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:45,230
should know the truth.

328
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:47,990
They should live under the sun

329
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:51,230
and have a free heart.

330
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:59,310
I think everything I did

331
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:00,990
is for my people

332
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:03,550
so that they can live.

333
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:05,869
It may be biased,

334
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:07,400
but nothing is wrong.

335
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:09,030
You want

336
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:10,950
everyone in the three realms

337
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:12,589
to live with dignity.

338
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,790
This is beyond my power.

339
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:17,230
Gou.

340
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:19,230
You showed me

341
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:20,680
a different kind of power.

342
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,990
You made me realize

343
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:25,150
a leader has to be

344
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:26,630
upright.

345
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:54,390
High Priest.

346
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,710
I don't know if he feels guilty

347
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,240
for neglecting his duties,

348
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:00,630
or if he's too busy

349
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:02,430
dating with Liu Yue,

350
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,070
but Tai Ji's visits to Oracle Hall

351
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:06,950
has been less frequent.

352
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:08,310
Otherwise,

353
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:11,030
I wouldn't have asked you

354
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:12,270
to come here.

355
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:14,060
It's my pleasure

356
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:15,510
to serve you.

357
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:16,990
You flatter me.

358
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:18,950
You are

359
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:20,310
the mainstay

360
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:21,590
of Oracle Hall.

361
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,990
From now on,

362
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:25,710
I'll rely on you more.

363
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:30,340
Have you found what I want?

364
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,150
This flower is planted

365
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:44,230
in a hidden area of the Immortal Garden.

366
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:45,440
It took me some effort

367
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,270
to find it.

368
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:48,310
So I picked one randomly.

369
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:51,270
With a few delicate flowers,

370
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:52,990
he suppressed the Demon Clan

371
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:54,750
for 100,000 years.

372
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:58,200
He also killed and injured many demons.

373
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:01,630
As expected of Grand Elder Shen Yan.

374
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:05,300
How sinister.

375
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:09,130
But

376
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:11,190
it'd be a pity

377
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:13,070
if such a good thing

378
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:15,300
is not put to good use.

379
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:20,710
You mean...

380
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:24,890
Wu Geng has been in the Demon Realm for days.

381
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:27,430
As the saying goes,

382
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:29,020
birds of a feather flock together.

383
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:31,740
I'm afraid the Demon Realm has changed

384
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:33,350
due to my negligence.

385
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:36,110
How dare underground crawlers like them

386
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:37,760
dare to ascend to the sky?

387
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:41,880
I'll let them know what

388
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,910
wishful thinking

389
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:45,430
is.

390
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,530
Let me see

391
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:51,820
who the lucky one is.

392
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,360
Old Demon.

393
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:04,740
Old Demon.

394
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,150
Old Demon.

395
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:09,880
Who is it?

396
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:11,190
Who is calling me?

397
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,910
Of course I'm calling you.

398
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:16,110
Everyone in the Demon Realm

399
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:17,980
knows your title.

400
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:22,540
Beauty,

401
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:26,640
what can I do for you?

402
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:29,640
You seem talented.

403
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:31,950
How did you end up like this?

404
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:33,630
I chose the wrong place

405
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:35,390
to be reincarnated.

406
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:36,830
Why did I choose such a terrible place?

407
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:38,740
If it weren't for this stone plague,

408
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:39,830
I'm

409
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:41,590
also a hero.

410
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:44,790
That's easy.

411
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:58,390
I...

412
00:20:58,470 --> 00:20:59,190
I...

413
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:00,910
I k-know this flower.

414
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:02,790
This is the Flower of Dawn

415
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:04,230
on the amulet.

416
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:06,390
I cherish talents,

417
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:09,950
so you can have the flower.

418
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,830
Thank you, Lady.

419
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:16,430
Since you're so virtuous,

420
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:17,970
I won't stand on ceremony.

421
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,710
Why did you hit me?

422
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:28,740
You're shameless.

423
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:31,070
I gave you an egg-laying hen,

424
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:32,820
but you want to eat it.

425
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:35,150
If you eat it like this,

426
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:36,790
there will be nothing left.

427
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:39,390
But if you plant it in the soil

428
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:40,920
and let it grow,

429
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:44,670
you can have as many as you want.

430
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:46,420
By then,

431
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:49,030
all demons' lives will depend on you.

432
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:51,630
Not to mention being a hero,

433
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:53,670
you can even be

434
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:56,710
the Grand Marshal.

435
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:59,410
Thank you for your advice.

436
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:01,290
Thank you for your advice.

437
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:03,050
Thank you for your advice.

438
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:04,730
Thank you for your advice.

439
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:05,790
Thank you for your advice.

440
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:06,750
Thank you for your advice.

441
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:09,950
Thank you...

442
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:22,790
Your Majesty,

443
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:24,390
our brothers

444
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:25,510
have just recovered.

445
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:26,750
But another war is coming.

446
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:27,710
They might be

447
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:29,190
a little resentful.

448
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:31,770
Why don't we postpone the deployment

449
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:33,190
so as not to jeopardize morale

450
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:34,550
and agitate the people?

451
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:36,870
Are you a man of the Demon Clan?

452
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:38,510
How could you say that?

453
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:39,630
I deserve to die.

454
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:42,590
Nitian Erxing colluded with an immortal spy

455
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:44,430
and joined forces with foreign enemies.

456
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:45,670
He betrayed us

457
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:46,910
and disregarded the grudge

458
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:47,910
of 100,000 years.

459
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:50,150
Fortunately, the Dragon Fang Warriors found out in time.

460
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:51,150
I wish

461
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:53,150
to chop him into minced meat right away!

462
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:54,550
Calm down, Your Majesty.

463
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:57,260
Nitian Erxing did collude with immortals.

464
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:58,430
But it's also true

465
00:22:58,430 --> 00:23:01,100
he's seizing the Flower of Dawn for the clansmen.

466
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:03,700
Maybe he's retreating to advance.

467
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:06,550
I don't care for winning

468
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,160
by begging for mercy!

469
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:12,030
I'll be the Grand Marshal.

470
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:13,160
And I'll

471
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:14,890
seize the flower!

472
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:17,640
Yes! Yes!

473
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:19,430
Yes! Yes!

474
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:21,510
Let's go!

475
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:23,070
Yes! Yes!

476
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,070
Hurry up.

477
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,510
Hurry up.

478
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:26,960
As His Majesty said,

479
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:28,150
we are going to

480
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:29,870
get rid of traitors!

481
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:32,510
Show them our courage and uprightness!

482
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:33,510
Yes!

483
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:34,190
Let's go!

484
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:40,270
Grand Marshal, your mask.

485
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:42,430
Report!

486
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:45,470
Report!

487
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:46,390
Grand Marshal.

488
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:47,540
Qiongxiong Ji'e's troops

489
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:48,350
have assembled

490
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:49,750
and are on their way here.

491
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:50,990
Pass my order.

492
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:52,150
Ask all troops to gather

493
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:54,190
at Qiyao Hill 10 miles away

494
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:55,310
to fight the enemy.

495
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:55,990
Yes!

496
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:58,230
Are we really going to

497
00:23:58,230 --> 00:23:59,110
fight Qiongxiong Ji'e

498
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:00,670
for an immortal?

499
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:02,330
Grand Marshal.

500
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:04,350
To kill Hei Long,

501
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:05,830
our alliance

502
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:07,230
must be sturdy.

503
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:09,150
Hei Long must be killed

504
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:10,980
in one blow!

505
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,080
I'm responsible for

506
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:14,630
Lan's injury.

507
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,470
She was hurt by

508
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:18,530
my indecisiveness and willfulness.

509
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:24,350
We can't defeat

510
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:25,870
Immortal Clan

511
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:26,870
on our own.

512
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:30,560
Anyone who dares to resist them

513
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:32,030
can be

514
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:33,550
an ally.

515
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,670
Here.

516
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:36,430
Dr. Mu said

517
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:38,110
two herbs were removed today.

518
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:39,710
It's not as bitter as before.

519
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:51,990
It sounds like the assembly signal.

520
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:53,340
What's going on?

521
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:07,590
You're awake.

522
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:08,590
Gou.

523
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,030
What's going on outside?

524
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:13,570
Qiongxiong Ji'e is at the border.

525
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:14,870
This time, Nitian Tribe

526
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:16,470
has gathered all the troops.

527
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:19,670
There was already friction between the two,

528
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:20,390
but it wasn't

529
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:21,630
to this extent.

530
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:22,950
What is it this time?

531
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:26,750
I'll play it by ear and handle it.

532
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:28,110
Focus on your recovery.

533
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:30,350
Is it because of me?

534
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:32,470
I used my divine power.

535
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:35,090
The Dragon Fang Warriors would've noticed.

536
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:39,950
Looks like it's a crusade.

537
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:41,350
Qiongxiong Ji'e

538
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:42,550
has done much evil

539
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:43,790
and only has audacity.

540
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:44,470
Now,

541
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:46,000
he's acting all righteous.

542
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:48,540
Lan!

543
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:50,280
You haven't recovered yet.

544
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:52,150
Although I don't like the Demon Clan,

545
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:54,030
Nitian Erxing saved me.

546
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:55,880
I can't just sit back and watch.

547
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:57,390
Lan!

548
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:03,000
Bai Cai, the battlefield is dangerous.

549
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,430
Wait here for our news.

550
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:06,790
Gou, I can do it too...

551
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:06,720
Wait and see.

552
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:09,700
Nitian Erxing?

553
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:12,150
Qiongxiong Ji'e?

554
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:15,740
They're nothing compared to me

555
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:18,430
with my meteoric rise!

556
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:52,360
Traitor! Traitor!

557
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,190
Traitor! Traitor!

558
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,790
Traitor! Traitor!

559
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:02,580
Traitor! Traitor!

560
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:03,510
Traitor!

561
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:06,630
Grand Marshal.

562
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:08,550
I, Qiongxiong Ji'e,

563
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:10,350
am not ungrateful.

564
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:12,350
You saved Little Dragonfly.

565
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:14,470
I appreciate your kindness.

566
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:15,750
Today,

567
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:18,310
hand over the immortal

568
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:19,950
so I can skin them alive.

569
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:21,870
Then I won't usurp

570
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,950
your Grand Marshal position for now.

571
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:26,480
It's rare to hear you call me "Grand Marshal."

572
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:27,590
Well,

573
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:29,880
did you assemble your people

574
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:31,950
to surrender today?

575
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:34,670
You are even more brazen than me.

576
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:37,070
You colluded with an immortal, aiding an enemy

577
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:38,800
and betraying your ancestors.

578
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:40,270
I'm here today

579
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:41,830
to kill a traitor like you

580
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:43,510
for our ancestors!

581
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:49,550
The immortal you're referring to

582
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:51,710
is not a lackey of the Immortal Realm,

583
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:53,350
but a victim like us

584
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:55,710
who was oppressed by Hei Long.

585
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:57,430
She had long cut ties with the Immortal Clan

586
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:59,230
and has been living in seclusion

587
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:01,100
and advocating equality.

588
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,840
She never abused her divine power

589
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,230
or bullied the weak.

590
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:06,870
How is such an immortal

591
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:08,150
related to

592
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:09,870
the criminal Heilong

593
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:11,270
and his men?

594
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:14,030
If you don't ask why, don't distinguish right from wrong

595
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:15,190
or good from evil,

596
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:17,320
and fight in the name of loyalty and righteousness,

597
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,830
venting personal anger and killing the innocent,

598
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:21,150
is it still

599
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:23,350
following the ancestors' laws?

600
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:30,270
Nitian Erxing!

601
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,720
Stop making excuses.

602
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,330
An immortal is an immortal.

603
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:35,430
Since ancient times, demons and immortals have been enemies.

604
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:36,790
This is the rule.

605
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:38,190
That's the law.

606
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:39,710
Get into formation!

607
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:45,310
Soldiers!

608
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:46,790
Listen to my order.

609
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:51,400
Prepare to fight the enemy.

610
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:03,470
Attack!

611
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:38,470
Zhui Ri.

612
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:45,710
Oh no.

613
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:47,230
The fog is spreading the Petrification Sickness.

614
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:48,550
Disperse now!

615
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:59,480
You idiots!

616
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:01,660
With just a small trick,

617
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:03,830
I subdued all of them.

618
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:20,830
That's...

619
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:25,300
Colorless Wall?

620
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:28,680
Everyone, come towards me!

621
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:32,930
Your Majesty, let's go too.

622
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:18,090
What's wrong?

623
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:46,550
Lan, are you okay?

624
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:14,630
Shenyin Clan's influence

625
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:16,300
has actually reached the Demon Clan.

626
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,500
Looks like they're going to resurrect.

627
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:21,060
But they're not very particular

628
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:22,570
in choosing their allies.

629
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:24,230
Wu Geng?

630
00:37:25,090 --> 00:37:26,430
Back in Xin State,

631
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:27,790
I was careless

632
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:29,390
and let my cunning sister

633
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:30,630
deceive the world

634
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:33,630
and use petty tricks so that you can survive until now.

635
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:35,870
I didn't expect

636
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:37,910
you to be more despicable

637
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:39,540
than her.

638
00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:42,180
Wu Geng.

639
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:44,070
Just you wait.

640
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:48,150
I'll make your life miserable.

641
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:49,950
High Priest.

642
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:51,950
Wu Geng can't

643
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:53,410
keep hiding underground.

644
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:55,060
Thinking long-term,

645
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:57,030
when they return to the mortal world,

646
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:58,950
we can subdue them all

647
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:00,430
to prevent future trouble.

648
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:02,790
Wu Geng has developed successfully.

649
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:05,180
To deal with him,

650
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:07,710
we need to strategize carefully.

651
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:09,330
No matter how powerful Wu Geng is,

652
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:11,070
he is still a mortal.

653
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:12,630
As long as I join hands with Tian Kui,

654
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:13,750
Tai Ji, and Liu Yue,

655
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:15,630
we will subdue Wu Geng.

656
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:19,190
If you are worried,

657
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:21,590
I can contact other immortals now.

658
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:22,870
No need.

659
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,510
I have my own plan.

660
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:28,130
Now,

661
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:30,550
I'll add fuel to fire.

662
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:32,230
They can

663
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:34,550
go down in flames.

664
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:41,750
You're just a bunch of dying people.

665
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:44,230
Just accept your own fate.

666
00:38:44,290 --> 00:38:46,150
Why are you struggling?

667
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:48,240
Kongshi Realm's divine power...

668
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:50,550
So it's you who's been playing tricks.

669
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:51,550
Xinyue Kui?

670
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:53,410
Immortal!

671
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:54,750
Show your face

672
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:55,870
if you dare!

673
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:58,310
Don't play dirty tricks behind my back.

674
00:38:58,310 --> 00:38:59,880
Shut up!

675
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:01,670
You idiots!

676
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:04,230
You should thank me.

677
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:05,990
If it weren't for me,

678
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,270
you'd be

679
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:08,830
deceived by your Grand Marshal

680
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:10,030
until your death.

681
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:12,430
The anti-immortal plan

682
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:13,910
he's been touting

683
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:16,310
doesn't include your futures.

684
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,950
I'll give you a gift.

685
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:51,180
Grand Marshal, it's the Flower of Dawn.

686
00:39:51,370 --> 00:39:52,580
Flower of Dawn!

687
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:55,600
It's really the Flower of Dawn!

688
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:57,590
We're saved!

689
00:39:58,550 --> 00:39:59,740
We're saved!

690
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:01,440
We're saved!

691
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:02,790
Your Majesty, we can be saved!

692
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:04,060
We're saved!

693
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:06,630
We're saved!

694
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:17,410
What's going on?

695
00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:25,810
Nitian Erxing!

696
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:31,870
Of course he knows what this is.

697
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:33,490
Not only that,

698
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:34,390
he also knows

699
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:36,190
the secret of this flower.

700
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,870
An antidote

701
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:39,670
to Petrification Sickness?

702
00:40:46,910 --> 00:40:48,890
What a joke.

703
00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:51,330
Not only is this flower not the antidote,

704
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:52,860
its pollen

705
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:54,270
is the cause

706
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:56,410
of the Petrification Sickness.
