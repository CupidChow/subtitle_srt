[Episode 33]

4
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:40,630
Hei Long asked us to submit

5
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:41,990
to the Immortal Clan

6
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:43,710
and let the Sea Realm

7
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:45,430
we've lived in for generations

8
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:47,470
become a barrier to protect the Immortal Realm.

9
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:48,670
Did you agree?

10
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:51,229
No.

11
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:55,039
The ancestor of Sea Spirit Clan

12
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:57,030
led his people to fight bravely,

13
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:58,470
but they were

14
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:00,070
massacred by the immortals.

15
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:02,150
Even my ancestor

16
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,430
was beheaded.

17
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:09,350
Hei Long is too powerful.

18
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:10,550
We are brave

19
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:12,030
and good at fighting,

20
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:14,790
but though we went all out,

21
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:17,070
we were still no match for them.

22
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,950
After conquering us

23
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:22,350
and occupying our sea,

24
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:25,030
immortals would join in the battle.

25
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:26,670
Those who resisted

26
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:27,870
were killed.

27
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:31,030
Only a few survived.

28
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:32,579
Now,

29
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:35,720
they've all become slaves of Immortal Clan,

30
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,920
guarding the Lost Sea for generations.

31
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,070
For whatever reason,

32
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:40,030
those who go to

33
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:41,840
Immortal Realm through the Lost Sea

34
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,390
will be killed by Father.

35
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:45,230
Our Sea Spirit Clan

36
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,630
has protected the sea for generations

37
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:48,390
and helped

38
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:50,230
lost ships as our duty.

39
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,430
But now, I can't accept

40
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:53,670
Father's choice.

41
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:58,350
There was

42
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:01,270
a mortal king who was oppressed by Immortal Clan too.

43
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:02,550
I can understand

44
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:04,130
your father's choice,

45
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,230
but I don't agree.

46
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:07,430
Since you

47
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:08,630
don't agree,

48
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:10,950
why don't you try to resist?

49
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,590
How do you know I didn't?

50
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:15,730
Behind Father's back,

51
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,270
I guided

52
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,630
the lost ships

53
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:20,910
and helped those

54
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,390
who were in danger at sea.

55
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:27,150
But Father found out.

56
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:32,270
He locked me

57
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:34,070
in this forbidden Sealed Abyss,

58
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:36,270
where I also felt the divine awareness

59
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:37,470
of my ancestor.

60
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:39,550
He told me

61
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,590
the mortal hero to overthrow Immortal Clan

62
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:42,990
will eventually appear.

63
00:03:44,829 --> 00:03:46,470
With the help of my ancestor,

64
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:48,070
I escaped from my father's

65
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:49,150
confinement.

66
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:50,870
My ancestor's words

67
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:52,270
rekindled my hope.

68
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:55,470
He told me

69
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,790
that one day,

70
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:00,280
someone will lead us

71
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,880
to overthrow Immortal Clan.

72
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:09,470
Overthrow them?

73
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,160
But I've lost all my divine power.

74
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:20,390
It's fine.

75
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:21,630
Don't be afraid.

76
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:23,550
My ancestor will help us.

77
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,190
Let's go.

78
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:02,020
Not bad.

79
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,540
Under my guidance,

80
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:07,750
your Crystal Glory has improved greatly.

81
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:11,550
Your guidance?

82
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:15,280
Just with your

83
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:17,340
Kongshi power?

84
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,260
Dream on.

85
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,000
Don't forget

86
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:26,760
I helped you

87
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:28,350
return to Immortal Realm.

88
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:30,550
Otherwise, you'd still

89
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:32,550
be a slave in the mortal realm

90
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:34,460
with no dignity.

91
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:37,490
I don't need

92
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:39,830
a mere priest like you

93
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:42,470
to tell me about my dignity.

94
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:23,430
It seems the Sea Spirit ancestor died

95
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:25,360
because he stood up for his values,

96
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:27,390
just like my father.

97
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:50,950
Ancestor.

98
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,710
I brought the mortal hero Wu Geng

99
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:53,790
to see you.

100
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:04,030
Ancestor?

101
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:07,870
Ancestor! Are you there?

102
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:15,070
Have you seen

103
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,870
your ancestor?

104
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,590
No.

105
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:27,390
I only heard his summons,

106
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:29,070
but I've never seen him.

107
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:38,600
Don't touch it.

108
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:41,130
Father said,

109
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:44,350
after Ancestor was killed,

110
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:47,070
his head and body were to be kept separate.

111
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:50,030
Whoever touches the body

112
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,860
or worships Ancestor

113
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,350
will be cursed

114
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:54,940
and doomed forever.

115
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:57,290
So over the years,

116
00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:00,200
Father has never been here

117
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,630
and never worshiped my ancestor.

118
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:13,070
The immortals even tried to

119
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,470
control people's minds,

120
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,690
threatening the enslaved Sea Spirits

121
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:17,550
with

122
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:19,070
such a vicious curse.

123
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:23,070
They can't worship their ancestor?

124
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:28,230
Do you dare fight against Immortal Clan?

125
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:30,430
Your ancestor is a hero.

126
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:34,870
I'll put it back for you.

127
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:48,230
It's an honor to meet you.

128
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:49,230
I'm Bei,

129
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:51,520
Sea Spirit King's youngest daughter.

130
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:56,200
I'm Wu Geng.

131
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,750
Greetings.

132
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:06,300
My soul stayed intact

133
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:08,080
in the depths of

134
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,430
this forbidden place

135
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:11,350
for 100,000 years

136
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:13,320
just for today.

137
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:16,440
I've finally met the mortal God of War

138
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:19,670
capable of overthrowing

139
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:21,230
the immortal tyrants!

140
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:36,390
Why is there

141
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:38,670
no power in your body?

142
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,140
If you're the one in the prophecy

143
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,730
who'd defeat Hei Long,

144
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:43,760
why are you so weak

145
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,170
and have no fighting spirit?

146
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:46,220
Ancestor!

147
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:48,350
Bei!

148
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:58,910
Immortal Clan destroyed my country and family.

149
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:00,150
Even the person I love

150
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:01,860
is manipulated by them.

151
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:04,400
Not only did she turn against me

152
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:05,620
but also killed

153
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:06,730
my friends.

154
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:07,820
If I could,

155
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:09,430
I'd barge into Immortal Realm now

156
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:10,630
to take revenge.

157
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:12,230
No fighting spirit?

158
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:14,870
I was just harmed

159
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:17,280
by White Lotus Great Sage's sneak attack

160
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,040
and lost my power for now.

161
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:21,600
Yes, Ancestor.

162
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:23,670
When I saved him at sea,

163
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:25,450
he was half dead.

164
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:27,170
Useless.

165
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,150
Useless!

166
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:30,030
You couldn't even defeat

167
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:31,020
a mere Sage.

168
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,670
How can you defeat Hei Long?

169
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:44,620
It's disadvantageous for us

170
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,610
right now,

171
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:47,500
but my comrades and I

172
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:49,600
have never been disheartened.

173
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:51,770
Whether it's the Great Sage

174
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:53,790
or Hei Long,

175
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:54,870
I believe

176
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:56,470
my comrades

177
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:58,390
will defeat them some day.

178
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:23,450
You're practically useless now.

179
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:27,240
Give up the fight against Immortal Clan

180
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:29,720
and I'll spare your life.

181
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:31,580
I will never give up.

182
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:45,340
Even if the future

183
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:46,960
is dangerous?

184
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:01,480
Even if I die!

185
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:04,260
Okay.

186
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:16,460
Wu Geng?

187
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:18,660
Is he dead?

188
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:32,030
Geng.

189
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:33,970
You must control your own fate

190
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,330
and protect our people.

191
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:38,470
Protect Xin State.

192
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:39,670
Geng.

193
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:41,470
Geng.

194
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:43,910
You'll bear

195
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:45,630
unprecedented hardships.

196
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:47,730
Only in this way

197
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,330
can you find

198
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:51,060
your own path.

199
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:51,990
Wu Geng.

200
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:53,910
Do you remember your true enemy?

201
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:54,390
Wu Geng.

202
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:55,790
Who is it?

203
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:57,470
-Wu Geng.
-Wu Geng.
-Wu Geng.

204
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:58,470
You carry

205
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:59,150
our hope.

206
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:00,440
We must defeat Hei Long together.

207
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,030
Your Highness.

208
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:02,590
Only you can lead us

209
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:04,030
to defeat Immortal Clan.

210
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:06,190
Gou, you promised me

211
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:08,020
you'd abolish slavery

212
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,550
and free the world.

213
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:37,590
-Geng.
-Your Highness.

214
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:38,990
Live well.

215
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:39,790
Live well.

216
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:41,700
Only by surviving can there be hope.

217
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,260
You told me that.

218
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:46,530
If we don't eliminate Immortal Clan,

219
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:48,710
Xin State will never be at peace.

220
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,360
If you really care for the country,

221
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:52,480
you should fight

222
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,270
for the Xin people

223
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:55,840
to the death!

224
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:36,790
Thank you

225
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,070
for helping me break the seal

226
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:39,200
and regain my power.

227
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:42,230
Ultimately,

228
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:43,270
your willpower

229
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:45,030
was what broke the seal.

230
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:48,290
It was due to your determination.

231
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,060
Even the slightest waver

232
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:53,270
could've caused you

233
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:54,960
to fail.

234
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:58,670
Wu Geng, come here.

235
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:20,440
Ancestor, this is...

236
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:23,280
This is my remaining divine power.

237
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:26,200
A corpse like me

238
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:28,270
has no use for it.

239
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:31,590
Now I'm giving it all to you.

240
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:34,800
You must defeat Immortal Clan

241
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:37,670
and lead my people to freedom.

242
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:40,980
Not just Sea Spirit Clan

243
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:43,710
but everyone in the three realms

244
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:45,670
is dependent on you.

245
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:49,510
Thank you, Ancestor.

246
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:17,430
Bei.

247
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,810
You should know what this is.

248
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:21,950
With the Water Command,

249
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,750
you can command all Sea Spirits.

250
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:28,440
Now the Sea Spirit Clan is in danger.

251
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,810
Bei, as my descendant,

252
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:33,070
you must take the responsibility

253
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:35,430
and resolve our crisis.

254
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:37,870
I understand.

255
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:40,110
I

256
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:43,430
will not let you down.

257
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,360
Wu Geng.

258
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:49,230
Bei was imprisoned because she disobeyed

259
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:50,430
Sea Spirit King.

260
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:52,230
She was already poisoned,

261
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:55,520
but even more injured now because she absorbed

262
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:57,670
all the cold poison

263
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:59,550
in your body

264
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:01,630
in order to save you.

265
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:03,950
You must find a way

266
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:05,350
to save her.

267
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:09,030
Ancestor.

268
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:11,350
I will heal Bei

269
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:12,830
and protect her.

270
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:17,870
The last of my soul

271
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:19,870
has dissipated.

272
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:22,270
Now, everything

273
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:24,030
is on you.

274
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:28,590
I finally met you,

275
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,670
Wu Geng.

276
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:49,080
Ancestor?

277
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:51,720
Ancestor!

278
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:55,410
Ancestor.

279
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:02,590
Ancestor.

280
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:04,670
He's gone.

281
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:19,070
Bei.

282
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:20,630
After we overthrow

283
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:22,030
Immortal Clan's rule,

284
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:24,160
let's return here to repair

285
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,420
the Sealed Abyss

286
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:28,030
so Ancestor can rest in peace.

287
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:35,680
Come on.

288
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:41,240
You're injured.

289
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,950
I'll take you back to Shenyin Village.

290
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:45,430
My friends there

291
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:47,270
can heal you.

292
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:49,670
I'm fine.

293
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:51,750
We have to leave now,

294
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:53,470
lest Father find out.

295
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,710
Okay.

296
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:20,030
Why can't I see anything?

297
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,030
Do my Eyes of Prophecy

298
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:24,150
no longer work?

299
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:26,250
Wu Geng is dead and can't cause trouble

300
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:27,680
anymore.

301
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,810
Immortal King's threat is gone too.

302
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:32,040
Of course you can't see anything.

303
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:36,500
It is Wu Geng's fortune

304
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:39,430
to die in my hands.

305
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:41,270
Don't be mistaken.

306
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,860
I killed him.

307
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:46,900
You did contribute

308
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:49,100
to his death.

309
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:51,500
But if it weren't for my good plan,

310
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:52,630
you might

311
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:54,790
still be meekly by Wu Geng's side

312
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,530
as his personal maid.

313
00:20:58,430 --> 00:20:59,560
Where are you going?

314
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:03,470
I've spent much time in the mortal world

315
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:04,730
without cultivation.

316
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,310
The Crystal Glory in my body

317
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:07,350
is too weak.

318
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:09,270
I need to

319
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:10,230
strengthen it.

320
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:12,790
I have an idea

321
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:16,190
to enhance your divine power.

322
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:44,650
What is this place?

323
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:48,470
This is the Immortal Prison.

324
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:50,840
Those locked in cages are traitors

325
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:52,190
who disrespected

326
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:54,190
Immortal King.

327
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:14,450
I do sense

328
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:16,260
intense

329
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:18,570
rebellious sentiments here.

330
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,250
Xinyue Kui!

331
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:24,830
You heartless lackey!

332
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:26,670
Kill me if you dare!

333
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:43,100
Look at him.

334
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,390
How pitiful.

335
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,880
Be it an immortal,

336
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,830
mortal, or demon,

337
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:52,510
one is most scared when in face of death

338
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:55,670
because of

339
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,430
the inescapable

340
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,730
despair.

341
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:01,430
And the energy of fear

342
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:04,130
is greatly beneficial

343
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:06,710
to Crystal Glory.

344
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:17,230
It's urgent to protect the Heaven Way.

345
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:20,060
Since the Heaven Way is damaged,

346
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:22,740
he's pointless in this world.

347
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:37,350
Xinyue Kui!

348
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:40,650
You helped Hei Long to kill your people.

349
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:43,440
You'll die a horrible death!

350
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:18,570
High Priest!

351
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:21,110
It's not my fault.

352
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:23,110
I was bewitched by Fu Xi

353
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:24,750
and those traitors!

354
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:27,170
Please let me go.

355
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:28,700
Please let me go.

356
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:29,670
Please.

357
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:31,270
Please let me go.

358
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:32,590
Please let me go.

359
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:33,870
Please let me go.

360
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:35,280
Please let me go.

361
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:37,480
Please let me go.

362
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:39,200
Please let me go.

363
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:40,730
Please let me go.

364
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,710
Please let me go.

365
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:44,660
Please let me go.

366
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,480
High Priest, I beg you.

367
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:48,510
Please, High Priest.

368
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,370
The energy of fear

369
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,270
is indeed very helpful.

370
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,160
When your Crystal Glory

371
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,310
is at its peak,

372
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:08,500
I'll offer you

373
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:11,150
to Immortal King.

374
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:32,000
Bei.

375
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:33,610
Your cold poison

376
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:34,770
is getting worse.

377
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:38,160
Wu Geng.

378
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:39,920
You're the only one

379
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,870
who can free Sea Spirit Clan

380
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,550
from Immortal Clan's

381
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:45,110
control.

382
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:49,340
It's nothing to suffer for you.

383
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:53,310
Bei.

384
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:54,710
Hang in there.

385
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:56,150
I'll take you

386
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:58,280
to Clan Leader Kong Que for treatment.

387
00:26:58,950 --> 00:26:59,750
Let's go.

388
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:04,830
Bei.

389
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:07,750
Here.

390
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:18,040
Wu Geng.

391
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:19,820
Put me down.

392
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:21,510
Take a break.

393
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:23,430
Bei.

394
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:25,530
We're at Shenyin Village.

395
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:26,430
We'll meet

396
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:27,920
Clan Leader Kong Que soon.

397
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:30,230
It's beautiful here.

398
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:32,700
Sea Spirits

399
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:34,810
are guardians of the sea

400
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:37,680
and ordered not to leave the sea.

401
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:39,550
All my life,

402
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:40,790
I've never

403
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:41,810
gone beyond

404
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:43,030
my family's island.

405
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:44,510
I've never seen

406
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:46,070
such a scene.

407
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:48,070
Sea Spirits

408
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:49,430
were not free before.

409
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:51,280
It's good

410
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:53,310
you came on land now.

411
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:54,950
The land is vast,

412
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:57,950
with mountains, fields,

413
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:59,820
and the endless Gobi desert.

414
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:01,400
From now on,

415
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:03,360
you can go

416
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:05,110
wherever you want.

417
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:06,870
Wu Geng.

418
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:08,510
On land,

419
00:28:08,530 --> 00:28:09,850
you're my only friend.

420
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:12,440
I'll rely on you from now on.

421
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:14,670
You must take me

422
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:16,310
to all those places

423
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:17,830
you mentioned.

424
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:19,070
Of course.

425
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:21,310
Would I run away?

426
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:51,720
I'll make some medicine

427
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,670
for you later.

428
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:53,920
You should be fine.

429
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:55,950
Thank you, Clan Leader.

430
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:58,190
The Immortality power is awesome.

431
00:28:58,190 --> 00:28:59,310
It no longer hurts.

432
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:02,110
Clan Leader Kong Que.

433
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:04,550
Bei saved me.

434
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:06,270
She's a Sea Spirit.

435
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,670
Her father

436
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:08,950
is the Sea Spirit King

437
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:10,230
who guards the Lost Sea.

438
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:11,090
Bei has decided

439
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,140
to join us

440
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:13,670
as a guide in our invasion

441
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:14,870
of Immortal Realm.

442
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:16,340
That's great.

443
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:18,790
With the Sea Spirit Clan's help,

444
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:20,630
we won't get lost at sea.

445
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,630
I'll help you get through the Lost Sea

446
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:23,910
successfully.

447
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:25,830
For Wu Geng,

448
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:27,990
I'm not afraid of being captured

449
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:29,130
by my father again.

450
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:32,150
Thank you, Bei.

451
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:35,050
If the Sea Spirits

452
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,200
need my

453
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:37,270
help,

454
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:38,480
just tell me.

455
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:40,350
I really need you now.

456
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:43,840
I need you to decoct medicine for me

457
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:46,820
and defeat Hei Long for Sea Spirits

458
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:48,630
so we're no longer enslaved.

459
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:50,870
Don't worry.

460
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:52,540
I can do it.

461
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,670
Brat.

462
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:59,470
You're so lucky.

463
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:01,510
All of them

464
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:03,910
are so devoted to you.

465
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:11,920
You've accumulated

466
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,510
many injuries over a long time.

467
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:15,450
I couldn't heal everything.

468
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:17,350
To fully recover,

469
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:18,830
you need to rest well.

470
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:19,910
For now,

471
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:21,510
stay at Shenyin VIllage.

472
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,550
Let me know if you need anything.

473
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:26,070
Thank you, Clan Leader Kong Que.

474
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:28,090
Your Highness!

475
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:29,370
Your Highness!

476
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:30,810
Your Highness.

477
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:33,970
Your Highness.

478
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:34,830
General An.

479
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:36,190
How are you?

480
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:38,830
I knew...

481
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:41,110
you'd be fine.

482
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:43,350
You have to lead us

483
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:45,430
to invade Immortal Realm

484
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:48,400
and avenge His Majesty.

485
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:50,300
This time,

486
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:52,550
I survived,

487
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,020
but Lan and Zi Dian...

488
00:30:57,830 --> 00:30:58,630
What?

489
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:00,770
What happened to them?

490
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,310
To save me,

491
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:08,070
they were killed by Bai Cai.

492
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,070
What?

493
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:13,690
No wonder they didn't respond

494
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:14,890
when I contacted them

495
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:16,840
with Dragon Whale Incense.

496
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:19,110
Lan and Zi Dian...

497
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:20,990
What

498
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:24,070
happened to Bai Cai?

499
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:40,020
Gou.

500
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:42,320
Gou, help me.

501
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:43,850
Gou.

502
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:50,700
Zi Dian!

503
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:53,490
Zi Dian!

504
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:55,970
Lan!

505
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:27,710
Wu Geng.

506
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:31,430
What's your plan?

507
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:34,630
Their deaths

508
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:36,070
made me reflect.

509
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:38,950
Bai Cai alone

510
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:40,670
caused us many casualties.

511
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:43,330
There are many powerful immortals.

512
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:44,610
We can't defeat them

513
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:45,880
just by having

514
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:46,950
more people.

515
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:49,750
We'll just be annihilated

516
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:51,620
like Xin State did.

517
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,230
Yes.

518
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:56,710
Not only do they have 100 Immortal Groups

519
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:58,870
but also the three Great Sages.

520
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:01,750
Each of them

521
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:03,260
can match

522
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:05,020
1,000 mortals.

523
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:07,670
So I want to go to Illusion Island

524
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:08,870
to refine qi.

525
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:11,070
Illusion Island?

526
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:12,310
Yes.

527
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:14,830
It's the island of refined qi.

528
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:16,510
Everything on the island

529
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:17,870
is made of qi.

530
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:19,430
A year there

531
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:21,510
is a day here.

532
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:24,310
So I can make

533
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:26,070
great improvement

534
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:27,550
in a short time.

535
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:29,110
Okay.

536
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:31,260
I'll arrange a boat

537
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:33,390
to escort you to Illusion Island.

538
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:34,190
General An.

539
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:36,070
It's not an ordinary island.

540
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:37,880
You can't go there by boat.

541
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,670
Only strong refined qi

542
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:42,070
can send one to Illusion Island.

543
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:45,310
Uncle Ziyu will take me there.

544
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,540
Your Highness.

545
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:49,830
You're alone.

546
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:52,820
Take care.

547
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:54,030
Don't worry.

548
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:57,470
General An.

549
00:33:58,270 --> 00:34:00,710
Go back to Northern Mountain Mine

550
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:02,910
and pick some strong mortal warriors

551
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:03,870
who can

552
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:04,870
refine qi.

553
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:06,870
When I reach Illusion Island,

554
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:08,360
I'll ask the island chief

555
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:09,810
to allow mortal warriors

556
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:11,409
to refine qi there.

557
00:34:11,909 --> 00:34:14,030
I'll pick you up then.

558
00:34:14,989 --> 00:34:15,790
Great.

559
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:17,750
I'll wait for you

560
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:19,520
at Northern Mountain Mine.

561
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:04,670
Uncle Ziyu.

562
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:12,430
Shang?

563
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:14,160
Why are you here?

564
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:16,510
Gou, long time no see.

565
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:21,430
Shang.

566
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:23,230
You've changed a lot.

567
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:24,710
I almost didn't recognize you.

568
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:26,510
After we said goodbye at the mine,

569
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:27,630
you disappeared.

570
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:29,560
Everyone's worried about you.

571
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:32,310
Why are you on Illusion Island?

572
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:33,970
After escaping from the mine,

573
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:35,910
I kept running east,

574
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:38,710
fearful of being hunted down by immortals.

575
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:39,540
But I still

576
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:41,350
ran into trouble.

577
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:42,710
Venerable Bai Yue of Illusion Island

578
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:43,520
saved me.

579
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:44,430
So,

580
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:46,550
I followed him here

581
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:48,400
and became his disciple

582
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:50,550
to refine qi.

583
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:52,910
Great.

584
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:55,870
The human race, Demon Clan,

585
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:56,870
and Shenyin Clan

586
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,710
who're dissatisfied with Hei Long

587
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:00,070
have joined forces.

588
00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:02,100
I'm here to persuade

589
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:04,110
the island chief

590
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:05,590
to allow mortal warriors

591
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:07,510
to come here to refine qi.

592
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:08,700
Shang.

593
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:10,480
We need more power.

594
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:11,750
Join us.

595
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:13,310
Chief

596
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:14,630
won't allow you

597
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:17,110
to cultivate here for war.

598
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:18,510
She experienced

599
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,170
the ancient Immortal Clan war

600
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,850
and witnessed

601
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:23,410
Immortal Clan's endless conquests

602
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:24,540
over 100,000 years.

603
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:27,470
That's why she hates warfare.

604
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:29,950
If she knows how atrocious

605
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:32,110
Hei Long and Immortal Clan are,

606
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:33,370
she should understand

607
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:35,310
we're trying to

608
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:36,910
free all three realms

609
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:38,870
from these

610
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:40,120
endless conquests.

611
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:42,830
It's because

612
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:45,070
she knows the cruelty of war

613
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:47,170
that she stays away from all that.

614
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:50,050
She built this happy land

615
00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:51,770
with refined qi,

616
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:52,870
believing that

617
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:55,630
the way to change the world

618
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:58,670
is creation, not destruction.

619
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:00,310
The world's being destroyed

620
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:01,750
as everyone is

621
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:03,670
enslaved by immortals.

622
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:05,430
So,

623
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:07,360
we must use force.

624
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:11,760
But the price

625
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:13,910
will be

626
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:15,700
massive bloodshed.

627
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:27,870
Illusion Island chose

628
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:32,950
rebirth

629
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:34,910
instead of revenge.

630
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:37,690
You're

631
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:38,990
so powerful,

632
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,310
yet you ignore those trampled and killed

633
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:42,660
by immortals.

634
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:44,880
It's not rebirth

635
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,350
but escapism.

636
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:47,750
Chief

637
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:49,370
thinks all lives matter,

638
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:51,750
including

639
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:54,150
immortals' lives.

640
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:57,070
She used her power to help everyone.

641
00:37:57,180 --> 00:38:00,190
But humans abused their power

642
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:01,910
to bring bloodshed.

643
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:04,110
Just like Xin King.

644
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:06,150
It's clearly the immortals

645
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:07,870
who're abusing their power.

646
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:09,550
My father wanted

647
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:10,870
to free mortals from

648
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:12,510
the immortals' oppression,

649
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:13,830
so he

650
00:38:13,850 --> 00:38:15,370
risked his life.

651
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:17,880
Father?

652
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:19,870
Yes.

653
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:23,140
I'm Wu Geng, son of Xin King.

654
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:25,030
I see.

655
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:28,240
After the fall of Xin State,

656
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,870
the Bai Army killed my mother.

657
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:33,870
Do you...

658
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,470
Do you think

659
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:37,630
challenging the immortals is noble?

660
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:39,750
So many innocent people

661
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:41,270
are implicated!

662
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:42,870
How can they be sacrificed

663
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:44,070
just for your

664
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:45,110
noble ideals?

665
00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:47,040
Under the immortals' tyranny,

666
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:48,870
no one can be free.

667
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:50,310
Only by defeating

668
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:51,640
the mastermind Hei Long

669
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:53,790
can the three realms be at peace.

670
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:55,070
Because

671
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:57,030
you claim so,

672
00:38:57,390 --> 00:38:58,480
so many innocents

673
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,740
have to be sacrificed?

674
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:02,070
If you act so wilfully,

675
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:03,390
you'll only repeat

676
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:04,720
your father's failure.

677
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:06,110
He didn't fail.

678
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:09,110
He let everyone know that

679
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:12,510
no one has rights under the immortals' rule.

680
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:14,870
When have you and your father

681
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:18,070
ever given anyone

682
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,930
the right to choose?

683
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,070
The weak

684
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:36,310
have no rights;

685
00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:37,110
not even

686
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:38,550
the right to live.

687
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:40,230
What we're doing now

688
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:41,350
is to let the people

689
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:42,470
regain their dignity

690
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:43,230
and

691
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:44,950
have the right to live!

692
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:49,510
Release!

693
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:09,160
Silver Shield!

694
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:41,300
The stronger the will,

695
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:43,500
the heavier it gets.

696
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:49,120
The greater it is...

697
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:57,670
The tougher it is.

698
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:37,950
Colorless power?

699
00:42:02,470 --> 00:42:03,470
Years ago,

700
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:04,960
I was coincidentally

701
00:42:05,910 --> 00:42:06,640
guided

702
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:08,340
by the island chief.

703
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:13,230
I heard she built an illusion island...

704
00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:16,610
where everyone

705
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,280
is truly equal.

706
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:19,310
That's right.

707
00:42:19,990 --> 00:42:22,110
That's the island chief's wish.

708
00:42:23,310 --> 00:42:24,450
The island's people

709
00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:26,920
will never be involved in killing.

710
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:27,990
Indeed.

711
00:42:28,870 --> 00:42:29,970
Building a new world

712
00:42:29,970 --> 00:42:31,330
is a beautiful wish.

713
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,550
But if one day

714
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:35,670
the three realms are wiped out,

715
00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:40,030
can Illusion Island stay aloof?
