00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:38,050
[Episode 6]

4
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,700
What are you cooking?

5
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:42,130
These are morning glory seeds.

6
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:43,050
It

7
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:44,250
contains a toxin.

8
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:45,420
But after treatment,

9
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:46,660
it can cure coughing.

10
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:48,220
I noticed that slave

11
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:48,940
was coughing badly.

12
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:49,650
When I'm done cooking,

13
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:50,820
send it to him.

14
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:55,850
I didn't expect you to know this too.

15
00:01:58,450 --> 00:01:59,479
You used to

16
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:00,990
go up mountains

17
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:02,460
to pick herbs with me.

18
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:08,250
Yes, that's true.

19
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:13,620
By the way,

20
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:14,460
do you remember

21
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:16,380
Prince Wu Geng of Xin State?

22
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:19,860
Could she have realized something?

23
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,860
Last time, he wanted to catch me.

24
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,650
I only managed to escape

25
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:27,250
after I tossed morning glory seeds at his face.

26
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,220
I see.

27
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:44,450
You're here.

28
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:50,340
Drink this.

29
00:02:50,579 --> 00:02:52,170
Bai Cai specially cooked it for you.

30
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:53,490
It can cure your cough.

31
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,140
Take it.

32
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,150
Actually, I came...

33
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:18,010
to apologize to you.

34
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,410
If you hadn't saved me just now,

35
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:23,170
I would have likely...

36
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,170
died.

37
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:29,540
As long as

38
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:31,260
you don't rob others anymore,

39
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:33,250
I'll let bygones be bygones.

40
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,010
Thank you.

41
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,600
You were willing to save me

42
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,700
despite how I treated you in the past.

43
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:46,490
I...

44
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,170
All right.

45
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:50,620
Since we're all slaves,

46
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:52,820
we should help each other, right?

47
00:03:59,170 --> 00:03:59,980
I...

48
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,550
I don't even know your name.

49
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:04,860
Gou.

50
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,390
Nice to meet you, Gou.

51
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:09,310
I'm De.

52
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,860
Call me anytime if you need anything.

53
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:12,780
Anytime.

54
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:17,850
Here, bring these back

55
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:19,140
and take them after boiling in water.

56
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:21,140
Then, you should be able to recover.

57
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:22,540
Go back and rest now,

58
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,060
De.

59
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:27,380
Okay.

60
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,460
Thank you, Gou. Thank you, Gou.

61
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:33,620
I'll get going, Gou.

62
00:04:35,659 --> 00:04:36,540
Thank you, Gou.

63
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:43,960
I'll get going.

64
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:22,570
When are these days

65
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:24,020
coming to an end? Tell me.

66
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,310
Before I knew it,

67
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,450
it's winter already.

68
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:42,340
I don't know how many more days

69
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:44,060
we have to spend

70
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,120
without sunlight.

71
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,360
Come and look!

72
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:02,680
Look at the snowman I made.

73
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,690
Come on.

74
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,080
It's a snowman.

75
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:16,500
It's well made.

76
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,180
Yes.

77
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,810
♫Wild geese pass by in the autumn wind♫

78
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,170
♫Leaves know the sky is cold♫

79
00:06:44,409 --> 00:06:48,560
♫In a drunken stupor; I'm desolate♫

80
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,330
♫Dreams of good times are in vain♫

81
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:54,320
♫The moon in the sky is not me♫

82
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:59,270
♫Fair or unfair, it's all wrong♫

83
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:02,800
♫Life is unpredictable♫

84
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,850
♫Forget the evenings; forget the mornings♫

85
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:06,670
After I reviewed the memorials,

86
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:10,680
♫Laughing at lovers for torturing themselves♫

87
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,960
once I saw that it's snowing outside,

88
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,660
I knew you'd be here.

89
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:15,380
♫I can see the wind and rain outside the curtain♫

90
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:12,980
Father.

91
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:17,290
Geng, have you been practicing your martial arts hard?

92
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:21,580
♫If it's unforgettable, why do I ponder about it?♫

93
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:18,380
Your Majesty.

94
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,930
Geng has always been working hard.

95
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:21,540
It wasn't easy for me

96
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:22,920
to ask him to come out and make snowmen.

97
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,350
Yet you're checking his homework as soon as you came.

98
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:26,060
♫It's always been like a dream♫

99
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:29,560
♫But this love is engraved in my heart♫

100
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,770
Father, Mother.

101
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:30,230
Coincidentally, I've recently

102
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:33,980
♫How many times do you need to look back if you spend a lifetime together?♫

103
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,100
learned a new set of sword techniques.

104
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,100
Please give me some advice, Father.

105
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:36,610
♫If you're destined to be alone♫

106
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,590
♫There's no way out♫

107
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:45,150
♫Don’t ask why or about honor and disgrace♫

108
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:47,250
♫I once trampled mountains and rivers♫

109
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:50,920
♫And grieved over the suffering in the world♫

110
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:55,120
♫Willing to fight against the recurrence of fate together♫

111
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,780
♫Wherever we meet♫

112
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:01,030
♫The flowers fall♫

113
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:05,220
♫Don't ask why or about the path ahead♫

114
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,910
I really hope I'd get the chance

115
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,700
to make snowmen and play snowball fights

116
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:17,370
with my children.

117
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,260
Uncle, what's wrong?

118
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,130
When I was just arrested

119
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:26,170
to the mine,

120
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:28,030
my child was just born.

121
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,200
It's been more than ten years.

122
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:31,340
I don't even know

123
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,970
what he looks like now,

124
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:34,740
and if he's even still alive.

125
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,090
My family of three

126
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:44,179
was arrested here together.

127
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:45,600
In the end,

128
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:48,370
when my son was mining bloodstones,

129
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,320
the mine suddenly caved in...

130
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,860
and he was killed.

131
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:55,500
Not long after,

132
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:58,820
his mother was so sad...

133
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,000
that she chose to end her life too.

134
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,450
My father died in the mine too.

135
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:07,720
His last wish

136
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:08,950
before he died...

137
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:11,180
was to see the outside world

138
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,150
once more.

139
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:14,420
You're all so lucky.

140
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:15,850
At least you've met

141
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:16,890
your parents.

142
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:18,850
I'm an orphan.

143
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,500
I don't even know who my parents are.

144
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:23,020
When Xin King was alive,

145
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,020
Her Majesty had established

146
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,930
a charity hall which kept me fed and clothed.

147
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:27,500
Then I was arrested to here.

148
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:29,380
In a place like this,

149
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,530
it's enough for me that I am fed

150
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:33,140
and can stay alive.

151
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,840
No wonder you...

152
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:38,260
Gou, it was you who let me realize

153
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,300
we should help each other as slaves.

154
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,740
I used to only know

155
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:42,630
to fight for

156
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:43,780
what I want.

157
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,780
But now I realize

158
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,590
I gain a lot more from helping others

159
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:49,130
than just getting the things

160
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,080
I steal or grab.

161
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,950
I'm also more relaxed and happier.

162
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,190
Am I right?

163
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:01,660
Yes.

164
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,210
We must live on well.

165
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,720
Cheer up, everyone.

166
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:08,620
We will have a chance

167
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:10,110
to leave this place.

168
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:13,340
It's easier said than done.

169
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:16,030
I can't live to see that day.

170
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,960
But if that day really comes,

171
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,230
I hope you can

172
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:23,000
bury me outside the mine.

173
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:24,250
I don't want to

174
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:26,820
stay in this darn place even after I die.

175
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,130
I will escape.

176
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,020
I'll take everyone

177
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,290
out of this place.

178
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,710
Everyone, don't be sad.

179
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,710
We must have hope.

180
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:49,430
There will come a day when we will be free

181
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:51,040
and stand under the sun,

182
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:51,830
right?

183
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,360
How about this?

184
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,060
Let me dance for you.

00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:40,150
♫Waking up under the moonlight♫

192
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:45,290
♫Alone in a dangerous pass, I watch the wind blow away the clouds♫

193
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:48,030
♫The past has gone with the wind♫

194
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:52,770
♫The sword of Nirvana ignited in my heart♫

195
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:56,690
♫Singing between heaven and earth♫

196
00:11:56,690 --> 00:12:00,000
♫Annihilating time♫

197
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:07,560
♫Bury all the pain in the wilderness♫

198
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,300
♫Standing between heaven and earth♫

199
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:15,940
♫My mind is purified♫

200
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:18,120
♫The longings along the way♫

201
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:22,460
♫Turn into gorgeous colors all over the sky♫

202
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:30,580
Sir.

203
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:38,920
These stupid servants

204
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:41,580
are making noise at night and talking about insubordination.

205
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,940
I'll deal with them now!

206
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:45,580
So you are making the decisions now?

207
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:48,790
I-I dare not.

208
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:50,940
These slaves

209
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,480
are trapped in Northern Mountain Mine

210
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,630
and can't escape.

211
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:55,370
By singing and dancing,

212
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,660
they're just comforting themselves.

213
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,450
The mine won't collapse.

214
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,110
Compared with the mine,

215
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,980
the outside world

216
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:05,780
is just a bigger cage.

217
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:08,400
Yes, yes.

218
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:13,060
It's getting cold.

219
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,500
Give these slaves

220
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:15,690
more hides.

221
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:17,440
Don't let them freeze to death.

222
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,390
If they freeze to death

223
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,170
and delay the schedule of bloodstone mining,

224
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,070
I'll hold you responsible.

225
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:30,260
I will handle it.

226
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,210
I will.

227
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:38,740
Everyone, come here!

228
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:39,530
Come here!

229
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:40,990
Stop working and come here.

230
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:41,620
Hurry up!

231
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:42,980
Hurry up!

232
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:44,980
Stop working!

233
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:45,640
You, over there!

234
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,830
-Go over there.
-Hurry up!

235
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:47,820
It's getting cold.

236
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:48,580
We haven't even received

237
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:49,380
our winter hides

238
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:50,180
and he

239
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,710
already has new clothes on.

240
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:53,790
Everyone, hurry up!

241
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:55,240
Hurry up!

242
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:58,320
I have good news for you.

243
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:02,180
Everyone has been working hard lately.

244
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:03,270
So,

245
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:05,100
I specially reported it

246
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:06,250
to Mr. Chen

247
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:07,540
and

248
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,720
got a benefit for everyone.

249
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:11,430
Benefit?

250
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,380
You'll be getting extra food!

251
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,500
What? Extra food?

252
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:16,540
Extra food?

253
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:17,750
There will be meat?

254
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:18,980
I don't remember the last time

255
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:19,780
I had meat.

256
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:20,570
Yeah!

257
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:22,500
Why does he suddenly have a conscience?

258
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,340
But as you all know,

259
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,780
the supplies in the mine are limited.

260
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:27,660
We can't guarantee

261
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,590
that everyone will get extra food.

262
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:31,250
So I decided

263
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,590
to use a fair method.

264
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,540
Boss, here.

265
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,460
There's meat and rice inside.

266
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,040
I'll throw it to you.

267
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,250
Whoever grabs it...

268
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,070
will get it.

269
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:49,690
Let's begin!

270
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:53,080
Let's go!

271
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:55,940
Let's go, Gou.

272
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:56,420
Gou.

273
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:58,740
All that talk about getting benefits for us.

274
00:14:58,740 --> 00:14:59,970
Wasn't he just taking credit for our labor

275
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:01,260
in front of Chen Jing?

276
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:03,560
Now he's even making fun of us.

277
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,340
Gou, who cares?

278
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:06,650
We'll have food if we get it.

279
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:07,940
We did our best too, right?

280
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:08,330
Yes.

281
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:08,940
Shitou.

282
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,220
Don't you dream of eating meat?

283
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:11,540
Follow me. Let's go!

284
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:13,260
Gou, let's go.

285
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:15,630
Grab it quickly.

286
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,360
Grab it quickly! This way!

287
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:28,150
Grab it with all your might!

288
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:29,860
Grab it!

289
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:36,440
Here!

290
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:38,770
One more!

291
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,530
Come on!

292
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:52,810
Don't fight with me!

293
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:53,530
Wait!

294
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:56,050
Here!

295
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:56,820
Move aside!

296
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:57,930
Move aside! Get lost!

297
00:15:57,930 --> 00:15:59,290
Who is this?

298
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,720
It's Gou.

299
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:02,570
I didn't expect

300
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:04,900
that you, the one with the most integrity,

301
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:08,780
would also fight for food like a hungry dog.

302
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:15,870
Re-mem-ber this!

303
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,940
Since you chose to be a dog,

304
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:26,980
you have to learn to

305
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,840
keep your tail between your legs.

306
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:31,940
Are you done?

307
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:43,600
Look at him!

308
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:46,890
Continue fighting for food!

309
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:48,640
Go! Come on!

310
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:51,170
Come on.

311
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:52,410
Go on!

312
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,560
Grab it!

313
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,940
Why didn't you wait for me to do it with you?

314
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:22,780
Didn't we agree

315
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,540
I'll be in charge of these work?

316
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:25,849
I can do it.

317
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,150
At the mine,

318
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,810
meat was being distributed to everyone.

319
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:34,770
But you weren't there,

320
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:36,340
so I got you one.

321
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:39,340
Here.

322
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,820
I think I squashed it.

323
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:49,040
Although it doesn't look good,

324
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:50,460
the meat is still inside.

325
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:51,540
You can try it.

326
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:04,110
It's delicious.

327
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,180
Why are you crying?

328
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:11,880
Nothing.

329
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:13,650
I haven't eaten meat for a long time.

330
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:14,710
It's so delicious.

331
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:18,310
Eat more if you like it.

332
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:35,960
Why are you so nice to me?

333
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:41,300
Because you're Bai Cai

334
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:42,380
and I'm Gou.

335
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:45,070
You raised me for so many years.

336
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:46,420
Of course I will

337
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:47,460
treat you well.

338
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,820
Tell me the truth.

339
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:53,820
Are you really Gou?

340
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,680
Since you woke up last time,

341
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:01,540
I feel you've changed.

342
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:04,300
You seem to be a different person.

343
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:07,350
From Xin capital to here

344
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,700
and for half a year in the mine,

345
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:12,390
many things you said and did

346
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,900
were too strange.

347
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:16,350
I feel like...

348
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,460
I feel like I'm a mess.

349
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:21,420
Tell me.

350
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,260
What should I do?

351
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:27,960
I don't know

352
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,120
what to tell you.

353
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:32,160
I have my reasons.

354
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:37,500
Gou.

355
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:46,730
Gou.

356
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:48,600
Who am I

357
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,160
to you?

358
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:55,860
You're the person I want to protect.

359
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:00,430
You're the same to me.

360
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,630
Maybe in this world,

361
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,380
no one would treat me

362
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:06,780
better than you do.

363
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:11,310
I've made up my mind.

364
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:14,540
No matter what you become in the future,

365
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:16,330
you will always be my Gou.

366
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:24,220
Thank you, Gou.

367
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:26,180
I thought that after I came to the mine,

368
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:27,840
I wouldn't be able to eat meat.

369
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:42,640
Does it still hurt?

370
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,480
I've been fine since long ago.

371
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:47,400
You just said

372
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:49,030
no one in this world

373
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:50,870
would treat you better than I do.

374
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:53,510
But you got whipped for me.

375
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,880
How is that good?

376
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:57,580
Beggars

377
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,770
can't be choosers.

378
00:21:58,810 --> 00:21:59,980
What else can I do?

379
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,750
I'm full. Let's get to work.

380
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:09,940
Bai Cai.

381
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:11,520
Let's get out of here.

382
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:13,150
Get out of here?

383
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:14,300
Dream on.

384
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:15,820
They wouldn't let us out.

385
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:21,460
You mean...

386
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:24,150
Dig a tunnel?

387
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:25,180
Lower your voice.

388
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:27,850
This is too risky.

389
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:28,770
We'll get killed

390
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:29,970
if someone finds out.

391
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:33,170
I'll do it with you.

392
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:34,690
This...

393
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,080
No matter what Gou does,

394
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,240
I will be with him.

395
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:41,710
Count me in too.

396
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:43,460
Even if I die,

397
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,030
I should die with vigor!

398
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:46,420
Okay.

399
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:47,980
From now on,

400
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,180
you are our boss.

401
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:51,180
We will all listen to you.

402
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,040
I believe you can take us

403
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:54,470
to escape from this hell.

404
00:22:56,690 --> 00:22:57,500
I know

405
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,650
this is very risky.

406
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:01,970
We might also lose our lives.

407
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:04,120
But for us to leave here

408
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:05,230
and to ensure

409
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,180
we regain control

410
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,220
of our own fates,

411
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:09,060
we must do our best

412
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:10,280
and give it a go.

413
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:11,620
Give it a go.

414
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:12,410
Give it a go.

415
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:16,540
Hurry up!

416
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:17,660
Stop dawdling!

417
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:18,660
Yes.

418
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:21,530
Hurry up. Stop dawdling.

419
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:22,580
Get out of the way!

420
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:23,550
Get back to work!

421
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:27,340
You...

422
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,110
Boss.

423
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:45,210
Did he have a change of heart?

424
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:52,360
Don't fight!

425
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:53,680
Hurry up and go!

426
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:55,180
Don't fight! Take it and go!

427
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:55,860
Don't fight! Take it and go!

428
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:56,820
Excuse me.

429
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:57,650
Take it and go!

430
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:58,880
Thank you.

431
00:23:58,900 --> 00:23:59,930
Hurry up and go!

432
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:01,870
Did you hear that?

433
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:04,170
That fellow just thanked me.

434
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:05,680
Did you hear it right?

435
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:06,450
Weird.

436
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:07,820
What are you fighting for? One for each person.

437
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:08,580
Come on. One for each person.

438
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:09,380
Come on. Hurry up and go.

439
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:09,730
Take it.

440
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:10,380
Take it and go.

441
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:11,580
Take it. Don't fight.

442
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:23,840
The amount of bloodstones mined

443
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,240
has increased a lot.

444
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:26,310
Good.

445
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:27,860
Centurion.

446
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:29,970
I was immature before.

447
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:31,260
From now on,

448
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:32,220
I'll work hard

449
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:33,400
in the mine

450
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:34,380
and live well.

451
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:36,700
I hope you can

452
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:37,900
be magnanimous

453
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,130
and let bygones be bygones.

454
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:40,520
Don't worry, Centurion.

455
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,760
Gou was immature before.

456
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,290
In the future,

457
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:44,260
please take care of him, Centurion.

458
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:48,390
-Centurion, please take care of him.
-Centurion, please take care of him.

459
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:52,730
No problem.

460
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,030
Get back to work.

461
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:54,960
I'll get to work.

462
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,010
All right.

463
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:12,860
We're almost done digging the straight path.

464
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:14,740
We can dig upwards in a while.

465
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:16,740
Great.

466
00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:18,940
At this digging rate,

467
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:20,160
within a year,

468
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:21,780
we can escape from here.

469
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:25,560
What do you want to do

470
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:27,230
when you get out?

471
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,170
I just want to open a restaurant.

472
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:31,490
As a chef,

473
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,570
I won't starve.

474
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:34,070
All you know is eating.

475
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:36,190
What about you, Shang?

476
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:37,900
I...

477
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:41,500
I want to build a career.

478
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:43,540
My parents were slaves.

479
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:45,190
I don't want

480
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:46,930
my children to be slaves too.

481
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:50,330
If you become rich in the future,

482
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:50,840
don't forget

483
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,000
to take care of us.

484
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:52,670
Yes.

485
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:54,210
Gou.

486
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:56,470
After you two get out,

487
00:25:56,810 --> 00:25:57,660
will you

488
00:25:57,690 --> 00:26:00,920
get married and have children right away?

489
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:03,790
Nonsense!

490
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:04,490
If you keep talking nonsense,

491
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:05,610
I'll beat you up.

492
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:06,220
Don't hit me!

493
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:07,420
You're asking for a beating.

494
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:08,570
Stop talking nonsense!

495
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:09,770
Who told you to say that?

496
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:11,230
We'll stop talking, okay?

497
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:17,900
Are you done?

498
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:23,040
Sir, the few of them

499
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:25,050
pretend to work overtime every night

500
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:26,290
but are actually secretly digging

501
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:27,420
a tunnel to escape.

502
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:34,620
Is that so?

503
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:35,500
Yes.

504
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:37,640
Guards.

505
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:39,700
You...

506
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:42,360
go to the abandoned hole he mentioned

507
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,000
and find the tunnel.

508
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:45,950
You guys,

509
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:48,220
bring that Gou here.

510
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:50,670
If he dares to resist,

511
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:52,540
kill him.

512
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:53,500
Yes, sir!

513
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:08,270
Greetings, Mr. Chen Jing.

514
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:09,170
Sir, I wonder

515
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,520
why you summoned for me

516
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:11,620
so urgently?

517
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:14,760
Your centurion

518
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,680
came to complain to me about you.

519
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:19,630
He said you are digging a tunnel

520
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:21,220
and plotting to escape.

521
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,670
The things you're doing

522
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:29,430
have been exposed!

523
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:32,500
Sir, I'm innocent.

524
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:33,960
There is no such thing.

525
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:35,250
Stop pretending.

526
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:37,090
Do you think we have no clue

527
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:39,020
what you and your friends

528
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:40,710
are doing sneakily every day?

529
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:42,290
We were

530
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:43,830
working overnight every day

531
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:45,540
to increase the yield of bloodstones.

532
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:46,340
Sir.

533
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:47,370
You said

534
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:48,660
this is our honor

535
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,730
and mission.

536
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:00,910
Sir, please be discerning!

537
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:01,950
We dare not harbor

538
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:03,410
thoughts of running away.

539
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,280
We

540
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,570
have always regarded what you said

541
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:06,490
as the truth.

542
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:08,000
We accelerated the mining process

543
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:08,810
to repay

544
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:10,580
the grace of the Immortal Clan.

545
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:16,710
Do you really think so?

546
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:17,910
Of course.

547
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:19,540
Our monthly

548
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,720
mining yield

549
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,150
is twice that of others'.

550
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:23,550
This can be proved.

551
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:25,950
Recently,

552
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:28,230
the yield of bloodstones has increased.

553
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:29,550
Indeed,

554
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:31,300
it's thanks to their hard work.

555
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:32,690
But Sir...

556
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:35,500
Go on.

557
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:39,800
We are working so hard,

558
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:40,790
but Cai doesn't even

559
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:41,800
give us enough food.

560
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,160
He hasn't given us the hides either.

561
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,820
He even said we broke the rules

562
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:47,060
and beat us up without explanation.

563
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:48,150
Sir.

564
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:49,080
You can

565
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,300
ask other slaves to verify

566
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:50,920
all these.

567
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:52,200
Nonsense!

568
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:53,430
So,

569
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,000
you wanted to run away?

570
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:58,440
We never thought about

571
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,250
running away.

572
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:02,870
Cai

573
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:04,450
was afraid of being exposed for taking all the credit

574
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:05,410
himself

575
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,240
and losing

576
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:07,510
your trust in him.

577
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,400
So he made up this lie

578
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:10,780
to frame us.

579
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:13,020
Sir, he's lying!

580
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,730
They've been digging the tunnel secretly!

581
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:16,930
You can send someone to investigate it!

582
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,050
Sir.

583
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:31,440
I've gotten the investigation results.

584
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:35,660
In the abandoned mine,

585
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:38,810
there is indeed a newly-dug pit.

586
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:43,090
But it's not a tunnel!

587
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:44,910
That pit

588
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:46,370
is to store bloodstones.

589
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:48,160
It's not a tunnel at all.

590
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:50,340
Sir, please be discerning!

591
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:51,850
How is that possible?

592
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:54,460
I heard you digging the tunnel!

593
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:02,850
The biggest obstacle

594
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,600
to leaving here is Cai.

595
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,770
My move of letting him in on our plan

596
00:30:06,770 --> 00:30:07,710
is to arouse

597
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:08,740
Cai's suspicion.

598
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:10,290
In order to earn merits,

599
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:11,050
he'd definitely

600
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:12,310
tell Chen Jing about us digging

601
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,260
the tunnel.

602
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,180
When I see Chen Jing,

603
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:16,350
I'll tell him everything

604
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:17,560
about Cai withholding

605
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,690
our food

606
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,840
and hides.

607
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:21,800
By then,

608
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:23,550
Cai can say goodbye

609
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:25,110
to his centurion position.

610
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:27,620
I know.

611
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:29,620
I once offended Centurion.

612
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,090
But I never thought

613
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,920
Centurion would do anything

614
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:34,320
to get me killed.

615
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:35,890
He even...

616
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:38,890
He even can compromise the interests of the mine!

617
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:39,660
Sir.

618
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,370
Please help me!

619
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:42,260
Sir.

620
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:43,270
He's lying.

621
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:44,620
He is trying to frame me!

622
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:53,840
You each have your own side to the story.

623
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,160
How about this?

624
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:59,350
Don't say I won't give you a chance.

625
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,860
Not long ago,

626
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:04,280
I caught a Bigfoot Monster.

627
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:07,860
Cai and Gou,

628
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:11,060
you two will go fight him.

629
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:13,750
If anyone can survive it,

630
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:16,060
not only will I pardon his sins

631
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,570
and allow him to continue

632
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:18,900
serving as a centurion,

633
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:21,990
but I will also reward him separately.

634
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,520
Bigfoot Monster...

635
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:24,950
That means

636
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:26,460
only one can live.

637
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:29,490
Gou.

638
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:30,990
You mustn't go.

639
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:32,020
I heard that

640
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:32,870
dozens of ferocious beasts

641
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:33,730
can barely subdue

642
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:35,000
a Bigfoot Monster.

643
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:36,490
What do you think?

644
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:39,520
Once he is tamed,

645
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,240
my mine will

646
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:42,900
gain one more warrior!

647
00:31:54,850 --> 00:31:58,170
Seize the chance, young man.

648
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:08,460
Okay.

649
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,030
I hope he can

650
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:45,410
get through this successfully.

651
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:46,930
Please keep him safe.

652
00:32:47,610 --> 00:32:49,740
Bless him. Bless him.

653
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:01,290
They have to fight this thing?

654
00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:03,130
This is not a human at all.

655
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,920
Did... Did you just save me?

656
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:33,200
We are both

657
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,570
the Bigfoot Monster's prey.

658
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:36,430
Is there a need to kill each other?

659
00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:10,980
Father!

660
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:12,810
Bigfoot Monster is so powerful!

661
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:14,270
I'm watching.

662
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,170
This Bigfoot Monster

663
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:17,730
is really powerful indeed.

664
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:18,780
From now on,

665
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:20,449
I'll catch a few more for you.

666
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:22,210
Gou, don't be afraid!

667
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:23,120
He is so big!

668
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:24,590
He must have a weakness!

669
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:25,730
Come on!

670
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:27,280
Come on, hit him!

671
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:28,239
Go, Gou!

672
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:29,540
-Come on!
-Hit him!

673
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,080
Come here!

674
00:34:37,699 --> 00:34:38,860
Come here!

675
00:34:39,699 --> 00:34:40,929
I'm not afraid of you!

676
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:49,080
Dead?

677
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:50,310
Dead?

678
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:51,340
He's so powerful?

679
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:52,949
It was just one move!

680
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:10,550
Gou!

681
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:11,850
Attack him from behind

682
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:13,320
and prod him at his ankle!

683
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:33,460
Great job, Bigfoot Monster!

684
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:34,730
Yes, that's it!

685
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:35,570
Hit him!

686
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:36,620
Hit him now!

687
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:38,410
Yes, that's it!

688
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:39,960
Hurry up, Bigfoot Monster!

689
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:42,710
Bravo!

690
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:43,330
Nice!

691
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:44,420
Good job!

692
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:47,610
Bigfoot Monster, come on!

693
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:50,190
This fellow is quite capable

694
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:52,000
at such a young age.

695
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:05,620
Gou!

696
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:47,260
Father, this slave is so despicable.

697
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:48,620
Although he didn't win

698
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:50,050
fair and square,

699
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:51,420
it was still a way

700
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:53,220
of survival.

701
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:53,880
Kill him!

702
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:09,780
Bravo!

703
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:11,100
Bravo, Gou! Bravo!

704
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:16,910
Hit him! Hit him!

705
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:30,200
Great! He won!

706
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:31,770
Bravo! Bravo!

707
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:32,940
We won!

708
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:34,090
Bravo!

709
00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:35,120
Awesome!

710
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:39,860
Good job.

711
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:42,210
Father.

712
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,970
The Bigfoot Monster is not that powerful!

713
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:01,440
We won!

714
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:30,450
Gou!
