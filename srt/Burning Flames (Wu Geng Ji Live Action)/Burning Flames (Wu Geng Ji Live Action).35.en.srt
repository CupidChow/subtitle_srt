[Episode 35]

4
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:55,229
Bei.

5
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:57,950
Gou told me that

6
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:58,990
you saved him

7
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:00,040
by the sea.

8
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,440
Thank you for saving him.

9
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:02,680
You're welcome.

10
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:05,330
Gou?

11
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:08,669
You mean Wu Geng?

12
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:11,790
Why do you call Wu Geng

13
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,630
differently from everyone else?

14
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:14,590
His name was Gou

15
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,750
when we first met.

16
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,870
No matter how heroic he's become,

17
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:18,630
in my heart,

18
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:19,870
he's still Gou.

19
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:24,290
That is to say,

20
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:26,350
those in love

21
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:28,110
have special names for each other, right?

22
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:29,150
I think so.

23
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,350
I'm not sure either.

24
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:32,829
Then let me ask you

25
00:02:32,829 --> 00:02:34,490
something you're sure about.

26
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:36,030
How does it feel,

27
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,490
being in love with Wu Geng?

28
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,510
Do you know what love is?

29
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,020
Of course I do.

30
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:49,880
My mother once told me that

31
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:51,710
if I could recognize that person at a glance

32
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:53,310
in the whole sea,

33
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,110
if I would want to give him

34
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:57,310
the most beautiful pearls and coral under the sea,

35
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,190
and if I'd want to sing

36
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:00,230
the most beautiful Song of Ethereality for him,

37
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:01,810
that means I love him.

38
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,270
Your mother was right.

39
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:04,870
So, did you meet that person?

40
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:11,830
I think I did.

41
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:14,930
When I first heard his heartbeat,

42
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:16,470
I realized that

43
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:17,870
it was something even more beautiful

44
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:19,530
than the Song of Ethereality.

45
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:20,510
Really?

46
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:21,510
Who is that person?

47
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:22,630
I'm so curious.

48
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:24,200
It's Wu Geng.

49
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,870
Bai Cai, do you also love Wu Geng

50
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:28,030
like this?

51
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,520
You don't want to see him sad.

52
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,829
You just want to see him happy every day.

53
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,320
Whatever he wants to do,

54
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,250
you want to help him accomplish it.

55
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:38,510
Bei.

56
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,870
This is how it feels to love someone.

57
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:41,870
But

58
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:43,630
it takes two.

59
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,790
Only if you love him and he loves you back

60
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:47,310
can you be together.

61
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:48,990
But if the person you like

62
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:50,550
is already in love with someone else,

63
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:52,630
you can't be together.

64
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:24,680
Your Highness.

65
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:28,510
Your Highness.

66
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:30,070
Before it gets dark,

67
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:31,430
the repair of the warship

68
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:32,710
will be completed.

69
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:35,260
On the surface,

70
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:36,909
our warship looks no different

71
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:38,830
from the previous bloodstone ships.

72
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:40,030
But we replaced

73
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,270
all materials with

74
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:43,180
the most rugged materials a warship can use

75
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:45,110
and expanded the space of the cabin

76
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:46,440
so that all our warriors

77
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:47,710
can hide in the ship,

78
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:49,630
safe and sound.

79
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:51,470
Good.

80
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:55,630
Wu Geng, we're here.

81
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,250
[Reef Henge] [The Ruins on the Sea]

82
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:27,300
To attack the Immortal Realm, the first test

83
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,560
will be the Reef Henge.

84
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:33,710
The guards of the Sea Spirit Clan

85
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:35,030
will get on board to conduct inspections.

86
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:36,350
As long as we can get through the inspection,

87
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:37,550
we'll be able to pass through

88
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:39,010
the Lost Sea ahead safely.

89
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:40,390
For 100,000 years,

90
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:41,470
the Sea Spirit Clan has been

91
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:42,630
guarding this place.

92
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:43,630
Except for ore ships,

93
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:44,830
no ships

94
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:46,550
ever managed to break through.

95
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:47,950
But we've got Bei here this time.

96
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:50,350
We should be able to muddle our way through.

97
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:51,909
I'll definitely try my best to help you.

98
00:05:51,909 --> 00:05:52,820
I'm confident.

99
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:54,270
Okay.

100
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:58,790
If the Lost Sea

101
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:00,050
is just a piece of cake,

102
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:03,470
the Ruins on the Sea should be the main dish.

103
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:05,360
[Reef Henge] [The Ruins on the Sea]

104
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:06,990
The Immortal Clan will definitely

105
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:08,710
send all their elite warriors here

106
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:10,710
to make sure it's heavily defended.

107
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:17,670
There will be a fierce battle.

108
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,310
Since we're here,

109
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:23,890
we won't be afraid of fierce battles.

110
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,820
Although the Immortal Clan's soldiers are good,

111
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,350
the Demon Clan's soldiers

112
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:30,080
are also brave and formidable.

113
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:41,750
This

114
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:45,520
is the forbidden place of the Immortal Realm,

115
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:47,270
where Hei Long is at.

116
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:50,230
He's been sleeping

117
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:52,590
in the Tomb of Heaven

118
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:53,830
for 100,000 years.

119
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:57,590
He only wakes up when something big happens.

120
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:59,310
Hei Long is the strongest warrior

121
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:00,910
in Immortal Clan's history.

122
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:02,830
Anyone can't help but feel frightened

123
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,870
in front of him.

124
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:07,860
He killed His Majesty

125
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:10,470
and slaughtered our people.

126
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:13,950
No matter how powerful he is,

127
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:15,710
we must avenge the dead

128
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:18,070
even if we have to risk our lives.

129
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:23,070
The Lost Sea

130
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,510
is our first test.

131
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:26,070
By then,

132
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,950
everyone must hide

133
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:30,190
in the compartment of the bloodstone cabin.

134
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:31,550
Also, some of our men

135
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:34,050
will need to pretend to be slaves with me.

136
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:36,950
Once the Sea Spirit Clan gets on board for inspection,

137
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:38,350
we'll be able to handle it

138
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:39,870
if anything happens.

139
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:41,670
Got it.

140
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,230
[Reef Henge] [The Ruins on the Sea]

141
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:11,360
You also can't sleep

142
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:14,490
because of the expedition tomorrow?

143
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:24,950
Wu Geng.

144
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:26,720
If anything happens

145
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:28,720
to the Demon Clan in the future,

146
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:30,750
I hope you can give them a hand.

147
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:33,870
Since we are in

148
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:35,830
the Heaven-Breaking Army together,

149
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:37,110
we're family.

150
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:39,350
No matter what happens,

151
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:42,039
I won't stand aside and do nothing.

152
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:48,560
Qiongxiong Ji'e's demonic power is very strong,

153
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:50,370
but he's too competitive.

154
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,550
He may be a great warrior,

155
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:56,110
but he can't be the leader of the entire Demon Clan.

156
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:58,710
I know.

157
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,700
I'll keep an eye on him.

158
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,070
If he causes any trouble,

159
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:06,210
I'll beat him until he's utterly convinced.

160
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:15,480
But what worries me the most

161
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:17,430
is still Wu.

162
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:21,070
She likes you so much.

163
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:22,830
She listens to you in everything.

164
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,430
What's there to worry about?

165
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:30,470
What I'm worried about isn't her safety,

166
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:32,910
but

167
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:35,310
her happiness.

168
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:41,950
I don't want to see her

169
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:44,110
spend the rest of her life

170
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:46,110
in pain and memories

171
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:50,190
after I'm gone.

172
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:58,390
Maybe we can find

173
00:09:58,990 --> 00:09:59,910
the way to treat Petrification Sickness

174
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:01,840
after we get to the Immortal Realm.

175
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:06,040
Miracle doesn't exist

176
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:07,830
in this world.

177
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:09,500
The real miracles

178
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:12,310
are made by us.

179
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:21,870
In the end,

180
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:25,230
my life will stay in the Immortal Realm.

181
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,230
So,

182
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:29,310
I can't promise Wu anything.

183
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:44,510
Don't be so sad.

184
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:46,350
It's just I'll have to leave

185
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:48,110
earlier than everyone else.

186
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:49,390
But

187
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:50,750
I can still live on

188
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,030
in your memories.

189
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:33,670
Everyone.

190
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:35,870
We are here today,

191
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:38,560
ready to set out to attack the Immortal Realm.

192
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:39,670
In the past,

193
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:41,560
we've been through so much,

194
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,370
made so many preparations,

195
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:44,550
worked so hard,

196
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:45,950
and suffered so much.

197
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:47,670
What's it all for?

198
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:49,710
For victory!

199
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:51,300
That's right.

200
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:52,870
It's all for victory.

201
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:54,510
We've been making such determined efforts

202
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:55,880
and training so hard.

203
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:58,110
No matter how hard the road ahead is,

204
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:00,390
and no matter how strong our opponent might be,

205
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:02,030
we must win.

206
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:04,440
Even if we die on the battlefield,

207
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:05,950
our faith

208
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:07,670
will be passed on.

209
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:09,230
Our clansmen,

210
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:10,550
our descendants,

211
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:12,470
they'll inherit our legacy

212
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:14,120
and continue fighting,

213
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:15,830
until the living creatures in the three realms

214
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:16,670
can enjoy

215
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:18,780
sunshine and rain as equals,

216
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:19,990
and live in this world together

217
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:21,210
in peace.

218
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:26,990
Fight! Fight! Fight!

219
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:28,170
Are you afraid?

220
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:29,260
No!

221
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:41,030
Victory! Victory! Victory!

222
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,230
Anchors aweigh!

223
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:51,990
Setting out!

224
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:16,330
Look!

225
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:18,790
Rainbow Octopuses and Magical Jellyfish.

226
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:24,750
So many.

227
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:25,380
And they're in color.

228
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:27,240
Yes, I've never seen them before.

229
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:43,670
Look, it's so high.

230
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:44,310
Look.

231
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:46,550
Rainbow.

232
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:47,190
Rainbow.

233
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:48,250
It's so beautiful.

234
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,550
I rarely saw them

235
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:56,260
even when I was in the sea.

236
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:57,140
I didn't expect

237
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:58,590
I'd see them here.

238
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:00,550
Wu Geng.

239
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:01,710
It must be because

240
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:02,990
the sea knows the purpose of our journey

241
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:03,830
that it sent them here

242
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:05,359
to give us their blessings.

243
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:18,150
We must

244
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:19,480
bring freedom and peace

245
00:17:19,869 --> 00:17:21,790
back to the sea.

246
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:54,300
Everyone, hole up

247
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:57,290
and get ready for the Sea Spirit Clan's inspection.

248
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,360
Why are there so few bloodstones this time?

249
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:08,350
Is it because Chen Jing didn't discipline you well,

250
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:09,630
or is it because you slaves

251
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:10,960
have been slacking off?

252
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,680
How could we possibly slack off?

253
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:15,720
Maybe it's because

254
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,310
we opened a new mine this time.

255
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:19,750
We didn't expect that there weren't many bloodstones there,

256
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,750
so we only got a small number of them.

257
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:23,420
Why do you need 3 ore ships

258
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:25,910
to transport such a small number of bloodstones?

259
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:26,710
Did you

260
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:28,750
carry something else?

261
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:31,070
How could we possibly carry something else?

262
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,200
You must be kidding.

263
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:15,790
Go back and tell Chen Jing

264
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:19,030
the mining of bloodstones can't be delayed.

265
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:21,350
If there are still so few bloodstones next time,

266
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:23,410
save yourselves the trouble to come.

267
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:24,770
It won't happen again.

268
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:43,390
Why did the inspection

269
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:44,950
take so long today?

270
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:45,870
I thought

271
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:46,870
the Hallucination Coral that I hid

272
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,110
in the compartment failed,

273
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:48,870
and they detected

274
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:50,230
our breath.

275
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:51,400
It didn't fail.

276
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:53,870
Fortunately, you thought of it in advance.

277
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:55,330
Otherwise, the first test

278
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:57,690
would have already been a fierce battle.

279
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:22,470
You insolent slaves.

280
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,270
How dare you

281
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:25,230
play tricks under my nose?

282
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:27,030
Oh no, Father is here.

283
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:28,950
Go back.

284
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:43,900
Sea Spirit King.

285
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:46,630
We've inspected the ore ships.

286
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:59,010
Bei, come out here.

287
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:14,190
Father.

288
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,710
You slave.

289
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:24,940
Do you think

290
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:27,150
you can make it through the Lost Sea?

291
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:29,030
Bei.

292
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:32,400
Do you think

293
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,460
the Hallucination Coral can fool me?

294
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:36,430
It's bad enough that you once led some humans

295
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:38,470
into the Lost Sea.

296
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:39,950
But now,

297
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:42,150
you even associated with these slaves.

298
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,420
I'm so mad!

299
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:46,190
Come here already!

300
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:47,120
Sea Spirit King.

301
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:50,780
We never meant to be your enemy.

302
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:52,580
But I know well that

303
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:54,230
the Sea Spirit Clan

304
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:56,550
also suffers the fate of being enslaved and oppressed

305
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:57,790
by the Immortal Clan.

306
00:22:58,190 --> 00:22:59,230
I also know that

307
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:01,870
garrisoning the Lost Sea

308
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:03,930
is not what you Sea Spirit Clan wants.

309
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:04,910
So,

310
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:07,030
if you want to regain

311
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:08,390
your freedom,

312
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,430
please make way for us.

313
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,030
In the three realms,

314
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:15,030
the Immortal Clan is the dominating one.

315
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:15,950
The rebels

316
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:18,230
must die.

317
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:21,030
Since we're here today,

318
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:23,830
we'll make it through if you make way for us.

319
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:25,030
But even if you don't,

320
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:26,230
we'll still

321
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:27,850
get through the Lost Sea.

322
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:42,550
Father.

323
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:55,520
Here is the Water Command.

324
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:58,790
In the name of the ancestors of the Sea Spirit Clan,

325
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:00,250
I order the Sea Spirit Clan

326
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:02,190
to make way for Wu Geng

327
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:03,950
and open the path to the Immortal Realm.

328
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:04,750
Bei.

329
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:06,550
Don't think that

330
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:08,430
I'll let them go

331
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:11,000
since you have the missing Water Command.

332
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:12,050
Bei.

333
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:13,870
Don't you understand

334
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:15,470
my good intentions?

335
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:16,480
I'm actually doing this

336
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,670
for you, Honey.

337
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:20,430
For the Sea Spirit Clan,

338
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,870
we can’t offend the Immortal Clan.

339
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:25,470
If we offend them,

340
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:27,830
the entire Sea Spirit Clan

341
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:31,070
will be killed by Hei Long.

342
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:32,030
Now,

343
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:33,630
only by serving

344
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:35,560
the Immortal Clan wholeheartedly

345
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:36,950
can we live

346
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:39,550
a peaceful life.

347
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:45,200
Father.

348
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:47,230
When I was little,

349
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:49,270
Mother told me that

350
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:51,030
our sea

351
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:53,790
represents inclusion and freedom.

352
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,070
I'm the daughter of freedom.

353
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:58,790
But I've never experienced freedom

354
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:01,430
or inclusion.

355
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:04,560
For as far as I can remember,

356
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:06,190
we've always been

357
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:08,390
following the will of the Immortal Clan

358
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:10,070
and driving away

359
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:11,310
their enemies who want to

360
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:12,270
break into the Lost Sea

361
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:13,480
for them.

362
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:15,270
Father.

363
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:17,950
This is my choice.

364
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:22,200
I believe Wu Geng and the others

365
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:24,270
will bring hope

366
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:25,630
back to our sea.

367
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:30,200
Bei...

368
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:53,350
Oh no, it's coming!

369
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:54,340
Let's go!

370
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:27,680
It's Void.

371
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:29,290
100,000 years ago,

372
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:31,020
after the war of the three realms,

373
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:33,030
the hostility of the dead

374
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:34,520
turned into Void.

375
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:35,220
[Void]

376
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,670
Once attacked by Void,

377
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:38,230
you'll lose your life

378
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:40,270
or your soul

379
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:42,110
and become its puppet.

380
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,270
Wu Geng, be careful.

381
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:03,230
Geng, you must be careful.

382
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:04,470
I once heard on Illusion Island

383
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:05,670
about the power of Void.

384
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:07,400
Even Hei Long can't control it.

385
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,330
Let me help you.

386
00:27:58,710 --> 00:27:59,810
Stop him!

387
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:01,390
Those who are corrupted by Void

388
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:02,470
will lose their mind

389
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:05,530
and become monsters, and all they know will be killing.

390
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:11,560
Is there no solution at all?

391
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:13,030
No.

392
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:23,510
Uncle Ziyu.

393
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:25,830
How are you doing? Can you hold on?

394
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:28,710
Wu Geng.

395
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:31,480
Something seems to be wrong with the Great Swordsman.

396
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,740
It seems that he got infiltrated by Void.

397
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,270
Uncle Ziyu.

398
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:46,390
Don't come near me.

399
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:48,110
I'll hurt you.

400
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,860
Great Swordsman!

401
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:17,710
Father, let go of me!

402
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:19,910
Bei, don't do anything stupid.

403
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:21,960
Sea Spirit King.

404
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:23,330
What are you doing?

405
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:26,270
Father, let go of me.

406
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:27,830
If Void gets in here,

407
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:29,030
we'll all die.

408
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:29,630
Bei.

409
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:31,630
You'll lose your life if you do that.

410
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:32,820
Father.

411
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:35,230
Since our ancestors gave me the Water Command,

412
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:36,850
I must live up to their expectations.

413
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:37,500
You...

414
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:54,050
Bei!

415
00:32:57,630 --> 00:32:58,430
Bei!

416
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:38,070
Bei!

417
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:42,909
Bei!

418
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:47,949
Don't!

419
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:13,270
Uncle Ziyu.

420
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:23,340
Thank you for saving me.

421
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:28,580
Bei, it's all thanks to you.

422
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:33,950
Wu Geng.

423
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:35,620
This is for you.

424
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:43,190
Bei, why are you...

425
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:47,790
Bei, what's going on?

426
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:55,950
Bai Cai.

427
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,950
I want to tell you a secret.

428
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:02,190
I really

429
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:05,470
like Wu Geng

430
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:07,070
the way you do.

431
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:10,590
But I know

432
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:13,070
Wu Geng

433
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:16,110
only likes you.

434
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:23,670
Wu Geng.

435
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:27,020
You said

436
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:30,100
you'd take me to see dandelions.

437
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:33,130
It seems

438
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,760
there's no way we can do that.

439
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:40,310
I said

440
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,630
I'd show you

441
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:45,870
my colorful world under the sea.

442
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:48,510
It seems

443
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:51,710
there's no chance to do that either.

444
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:00,610
I'm sorry.

445
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:05,360
I'll have to say goodbye

446
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:08,710
to you here.

447
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,710
♫Formless beast♫

448
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:30,410
Bei!

449
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:32,700
♫Enshrouded by dark clouds♫

450
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:35,030
♫Prowling in the wind♫

451

♫Before I could take a breath♫

452
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:39,390
Bei!

453
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:40,660
♫The walls of fate♫

454
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:45,540
♫Collapsed one after another♫

455
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:46,070
Bei!

456
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:48,410
♫Who fought back, who never gave in, who held out hope?♫

457
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:49,100
I will bring freedom back

458
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:51,190
♫Praying and calling in the abyss♫

459
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:50,830
to you.

460
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,920
♫Supporting some kind of faith♫

461
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:57,950
♫Holding up the unyielding heart♫

462
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:02,540
Bei!

♫Abandoning the chaos of inner demons♫

464
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,830
♫Together we experienced joy and sorrow♫

465
00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:07,460
♫Faced with continuous hardships♫

466
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:08,840
♫We went upstream against the current♫

467
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:15,000
♫Through the darkness, I cried loudly♫

468
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:19,220
♫You and I, our pride stands tall♫

469
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:20,950
♫Piercing through the endless despair♫

470
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:23,370
♫Letting the light shine through♫

471
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,270
♫Escorting the warmth across the river♫

472

♫Lighting up the spring in the future♫

473

♫In despair, there is hope♫

474
00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:36,270
♫I fought back, and I lost hope♫

Bei!

476
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:37,930
♫Nervous, helpless♫

477
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:39,870
Why do you have to

478
00:38:37,970 --> 00:38:39,630
♫Years of melancholy♫

479
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:42,270
leave me just like your mother?

♫Time is torture♫

481
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:44,350
♫That face, full of resentment♫

482
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:45,190
What happened to her and her mother

483
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:45,760
♫Suppressed, growling♫

484
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:48,240
♫In illusions, the world is ever changing♫

485
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:49,110
was all my fault.

486
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:50,930
♫Shackles of the soul♫

487
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,840
♫Chaining expressions♫

488
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:56,890
♫Life is a prison; my dreams are my horses♫

489
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,980
♫Fighting with each other for survival♫

490
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:04,820
♫Come and smell the blossoming flowers of chaos♫

491
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:39,430
I think

492
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:42,470
Bei would hope

493
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:45,630
that you can take it,

494
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:50,470
the real responsibility of the Sea Spirit Clan.

495
00:40:06,830 --> 00:40:08,630
Now I finally understand

496
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:11,240
what the freedom and inclusion

497
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:14,710
Bei wanted is.

498
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:18,670
But my Bei

499
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:22,710
is already gone.

500
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:24,910
Sea Spirit Clan bids farewell to the God of War, Wu Geng,

501
00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:27,080
and the warriors.

502
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:34,510
Wu Geng.

503
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:37,450
I hope when we meet again,

504
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:40,670
you can bring freedom back

505
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:42,690
for Bei and the Sea Spirit Clan.

506
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,170
Listen up, everyone.

507
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:55,310
Let's go!

508
00:41:56,090 --> 00:41:57,630
Get ready to fight!
