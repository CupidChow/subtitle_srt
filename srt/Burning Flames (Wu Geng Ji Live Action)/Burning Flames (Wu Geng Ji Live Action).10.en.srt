[Episode 10]

4
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:07,390
High Priest.

5
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,430
Kong Que.

6
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:13,910
High Priest, you're back.

7
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:15,630
Everyone is here.

8
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:17,620
Please take good care of them both

9
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,150
from now on.

10
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,110
Come.

11
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:22,510
Greet Kong Que, the clan leader of Shenyin Village.

12
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:23,950
[Kong Que]

13
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:24,150
Welcome to Shenyin Village.

14
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:27,110
Greetings, Clan Leader Kong Que.

15
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:27,990
My name is Gou.

16
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:31,240
Gou.

17
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:32,810
What about you?

18
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:34,510
What's your name?

19
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:35,910
Just call me Bai Cai.

20
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,300
One's name means dogs.

21
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,270
The other one's name means cabbage.

22
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:40,610
Dogs eat cabbage.

23
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,590
Wu Dong, don't be rude.

24
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:51,510
From now on,

25
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:53,110
take this place as your home.

26
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:54,950
We'll hold

27
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:56,280
a bonfire party tonight

28
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,590
to welcome you.

29
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,080
Thank you, Clan Leader.

30
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:05,950
Gou

31
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:08,990
is really something.

32
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:11,550
Fu Xi exposed his whereabouts

33
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:12,830
to save him.

34
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:16,230
He also gave him the Fire of Chaos.

35
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:20,630
If he is really

36
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:22,390
Xinyue Hu's son,

37
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:25,630
then everything makes sense.

38
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:27,670
What kind of divine power

39
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:29,110
the Fire of Chaos is?

40
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:31,140
The Fire of Chaos

41
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:35,010
is an ancient curse mark of our Immortal Clan.

42
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:37,360
I didn't expect

43
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:40,650
that Fu Xi gave it to that boy.

44
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:45,270
But I care more about

45
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:46,910
what that girl has

46
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:48,329
than the Fire of Chaos.

47
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,590
I'm sure

48
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:55,790
that is an ancient divine power.

49
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:57,150
Godfather.

50
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:58,350
Should we report it

51
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:00,150
to Immortal Realm immediately?

52
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:03,480
I have my own plan.

53
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,390
Keep an eye on Chen Jing.

54
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:09,470
He has long been dissatisfied with the Immortal Clan.

55
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:11,000
His disobedience this time

56
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:15,870
has exposed his true intention.

57
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:18,000
Godfather, your injury...

58
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,750
I'll go find some good medicine

59
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,310
for you.

60
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:23,230
I'll go now.

61
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:25,870
The ancient crystal which King of Immortals

62
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:28,510
is searching for in the three realms

63
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:31,790
is said to be extremely yin.

64
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:35,190
It's extremely cold.

65
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:38,990
Does that girl's divine power

66
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:42,080
have something to do with the crystal?

67
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,640
Give it to me.

68
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:07,080
High Priest is here.

69
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:19,410
Ladies and gentlemen.

70
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,160
Today, two new friends

71
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:23,010
came to our Shenyin Village.

72
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,190
Gou. Bai Cai.

73
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:27,430
Great!

74
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:31,360
Starting tomorrow,

75
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:32,630
they'll

76
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:35,270
practice and live with us.

77
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:38,990
Great!

78
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:39,790
Gou.

79
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,380
Let me introduce

80
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:43,310
Master Yun Zhongzi to you.

81
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,700
[Yun Zhongzi]

82
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:49,830
Drink. Let's continue.

83
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:52,820
I'm handsome.

84
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,860
Drink till you die.

85
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:58,870
Although he likes to drink,

86
00:05:58,870 --> 00:05:59,909
he's also good

87
00:05:59,909 --> 00:06:01,310
at fighting.

88
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:02,230
Starting tomorrow,

89
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:04,490
he'll also be in charge of your training.

90
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:06,600
Yun Zhongzi.

91
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:11,390
This is Mr. Yuan Yi,

92
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:13,710
the chief blacksmith of our Shenyin Village.

93
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:14,190
[Mr. Yuan Yi]

94
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:17,470
He's the best at inventing things.

95
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:19,830
This thing is an iron musket.

96
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:21,270
It can shoot extremely powerful iron pellets

97
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,950
in an instant.

98
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:25,470
It's powerful enough to break rocks and metal.

99
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:26,670
How can such a small thing

100
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:27,670
be so powerful?

101
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:28,570
Are you bluffing?

102
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:29,590
This thing is so small.

103
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:30,470
Let's make a deal.

104
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:31,630
You can't use divine power.

105
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:32,870
I won't use divine power.

106
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:34,010
Just by itself.

107
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:35,110
Watch carefully.

108
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:40,420
Mr. Yuan Yi.

109
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,850
If you need anything in the future,

110
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:43,110
feel free to come to me.

111
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:45,630
Coming.

112
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:46,230
Excuse me.

113
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:48,070
Clan Leader, the wine is here.

114
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:48,950
Clan Leader.

115
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:50,600
Here.

116
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,270
After drinking the welcome wine,

117
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:53,390
you two will become members

118
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:54,720
of our Shenyin Village.

119
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,430
Yes. Right.

120
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:04,070
Great!

121
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:06,150
Great!

122
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:47,659
Clan Leader.

123
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,070
These swaddling clothes

124
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:49,940
were carefully made

125
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:51,200
by us.

126
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:52,510
Clan Leader, please take them.

127
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:54,180
When the child is born,

128
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,630
it can be considered a token of our gratitude.

129
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:58,140
I want to thank you on behalf of the baby.

130
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:58,990
I'll take them first.

131
00:07:58,990 --> 00:07:59,920
You're welcome.

132
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:01,240
Thank you.

133
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:03,690
So thoughtful.

134
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:05,430
So beautiful.

135
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:08,830
I don't think the life of the Immortal Clan here

136
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:09,650
is different

137
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,110
from that of the common people

138
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:12,310
in our Xin State.

139
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:15,770
Bai Cai.

140
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:17,940
Bai Cai.

141
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:20,140
What's wrong?

142
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:21,230
Nothing.

143
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:22,590
I just arrived in a strange place.

144
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:23,790
I'm a little nervous.

145
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:29,110
Here. Have some fruit.

146
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:34,130
Does the food not agree with you?

147
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:36,070
Our Shenyin Village

148
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:37,950
has the principle that all beings are equal.

149
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:39,350
We never kill creatures.

150
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:40,669
Usually,

151
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:42,789
we eat vegetables and fruit.

152
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:44,850
I hope you can

153
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,270
get used to the food here.

154
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:49,020
We can get used to it.

155
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:51,000
We

156
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:52,950
haven't eaten anything so delicious

157
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:54,630
for a long time.

158
00:08:58,830 --> 00:08:59,790
Old Man.

159
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:01,590
When will you start

160
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:02,830
teaching me skills?

161
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:05,970
I'm not your master.

162
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:08,190
Lan.

163
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:11,070
From now on, Lan will be responsible

164
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:12,310
for your training.

165
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:16,450
High Priest.

166
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:20,720
Listen.

167
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:22,470
He's just a mortal.

168
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:23,250
Just ask

169
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:25,080
a nobody in the village to teach him.

170
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,210
It doesn't need Lan.

171
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:29,290
This is Zi Dian.

172
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:31,990
He's the number one warrior of our Shenyin Village.

173
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:32,830
This thing...

174
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:33,470
Be careful.

175
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:34,990
It can be used to cheer kids up.

176
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:36,500
It's useless

177
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,310
in battlefields.

178
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:44,630
What's the big deal?

179
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:45,190
Can the number one warrior

180
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:46,470
look down on others?

181
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:51,430
If you want to be respected,

182
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:52,630
earn it.

183
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,390
If you're bitter,

184
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:56,320
show me what you got.

185
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:57,750
Wu Dong.

186
00:09:58,350 --> 00:09:59,150
I'm coming.

187
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:02,430
This guest named Gou.

188
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:04,310
He wants to compete with you.

189
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:05,190
Okay.

190
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:06,730
Is he

191
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:08,150
the nobody in the village you mentioned?

192
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,830
It seems that he's just a kid.

193
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,100
He's good enough

194
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:12,790
to beat him.

195
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:19,710
Do it.

196
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:27,630
Do it.

197
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,310
How old are you?

198
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:35,510
I'm 14.

199
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:38,430
In the human race,

200
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:39,470
people at your age

201
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:40,670
are just kids.

202
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,630
Don't blame me for bullying you later.

203
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:44,710
Don't save your strength.

204
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,310
Even if you try your best,

205
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:47,780
you can't hurt him.

206
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:57,120
Even the children here are so awesome.

207
00:11:57,310 --> 00:11:58,150
Why did they

208
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,350
bring Gou back?

209
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:02,110
Gou.

210
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:21,070
Gou.

211
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:22,470
In this place, even children

212
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:23,470
can bully you.

213
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:24,430
Will we

214
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:26,430
still have a good life in the future?

215
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:27,920
I want to leave here.

216
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:29,630
Because in this place,

217
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:31,310
even children are so awesome,

218
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:33,270
other people here must be more awesome.

219
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:34,070
I'll definitely learn

220
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:35,110
a lot of skills.

221
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,530
But I want to go back to Xin capital.

222
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:42,310
I miss Biggie and the others.

223
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:44,000
Don't you miss them?

224
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:47,470
Of course I do.

225
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:49,310
I definitely do.

226
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:53,310
Believe Mr. An.

227
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:54,470
Mr. An

228
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:56,200
will take good care of them.

229
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:58,630
We still have

230
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:00,760
more important things to do right now.

231
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:05,790
Bai Cai, how about this?

232
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:06,860
When I learn

233
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:07,990
what Old Man got,

234
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:10,310
I'll go back to Xin State with you

235
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:11,910
to see Biggie and the others.

236
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:14,470
Okay.

237
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:16,710
Since you insist on staying,

238
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:18,120
I'll stay here with you.

239
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:21,150
Alright.

240
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:22,790
The training starts tomorrow.

241
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:24,050
Take care of yourself.

242
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,390
Otherwise, you'll get hurt again.

243
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:26,790
By then,

244
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:28,450
you won't have a good outcome.

245
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,150
Here.

246
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:38,070
Gou.

247
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:39,470
Come out.

248
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,230
Master.

249
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:10,190
I'm here to apologize to you

250
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:11,600
for Zi Dian's rudeness.

251
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:15,390
Don't think too much about today's competition.

252
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:18,390
Wu Dong and Wu Xia are from the Immortal Clan after all.

253
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:20,390
It's understandable

254
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:23,450
that you can't beat them with your strength.

255
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:26,390
I underestimated my opponents.

256
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:28,320
I didn't expect that even children

257
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:30,630
are so powerful in Shenyin Village.

258
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:32,630
The lifespan of the Immortal Clan

259
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:34,630
is longer than that of the human race.

260
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:37,160
The Immortal Clan can live hundreds of years.

261
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:39,830
As far as I know,

262
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:42,270
since my ancestors' generation,

263
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:44,530
Hei Long has been oppressing this world.

264
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:45,910
It's been more than hundreds of years.

265
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:46,710
That's right.

266
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:47,630
The Immortal Clan

267
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:50,430
is divided into two types: new immortals and old immortals.

268
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:52,310
New immortals and old immortals?

269
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:58,230
The Immortal Clan in Shenyin Village

270
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,490
and the Immortal Group in Immortal Realm

271
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:01,630
are the new Immortal Clan

272
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:03,430
created by Hei Long.

273
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:06,430
We can only live hundreds of years.

274
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:09,270
Although we're born with divine power,

275
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,190
we need the apocalypse

276
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,390
to use it.

277
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:15,760
So new immortals

278
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:17,480
are created by Hei Long?

279
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:18,310
That's right.

280
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:20,350
The old immortals which were represented by Hei Long

281
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:21,110
had existed

282
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,740
since the beginning of time.

283
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:25,890
Their lifespan was hundreds of thousands of years.

284
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:27,990
They were born with divine power.

285
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:29,150
They could use it at will.

286
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:29,990
Their power

287
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:31,830
was unparalleled by

288
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:33,510
us new immortals.

289
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:36,470
Except Hei Long,

290
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:37,260
why have I

291
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,630
never heard of legends

292
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:40,070
of other

293
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:41,200
ancient immortals?

294
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:44,890
100,000 years ago,

295
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,750
a great war broke out in Immortal Realm.

296
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:50,750
Hei Long killed all the ancient immortals

297
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,660
on his own.

298
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:54,230
After that,

299
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:56,080
he rebuilt the three realms

300
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:58,400
and created the new Immortal Clan.

301
00:15:58,830 --> 00:15:59,630
Therefore,

302
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:02,040
he's the grandmaster of new immortals

303
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:04,110
and the undisputed supreme lord

304
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:05,870
in the three realms.

305
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:10,090
The supreme lord in the three realms?

306
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:12,030
Even though he was born powerful,

307
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:12,830
can this be a reason

308
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:14,360
to bully others?

309
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:18,430
Gou.

310
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:20,670
What lies in front of you

311
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:22,670
is a path to heaven.

312
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:26,240
A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.

313
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,230
I hope your journey

314
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:30,510
can start from Shenyin Village.

315
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:33,030
Don't worry, Master.

316
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,430
Even if I have to start from scratch,

317
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:36,830
I'll be down-to-earth

318
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,070
in every step.

319
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:41,790
But before that,

320
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:44,430
I need to meet someone first.

321
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:48,990
I haven't seen

322
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:49,870
such a vast and beautiful starry sky

323
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:51,950
in five years.

324
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:54,320
Our Xin State

325
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:55,870
used to be like this.

326
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:01,910
You're finally here.

327
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:03,950
Old Man.

328
00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:06,030
You knew I was coming?

329
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:08,230
Have a seat.

330
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:18,069
Old Man.

331
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:19,609
I have a question

332
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,490
for you.

333
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:22,920
Do you know my mother

334
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:24,150
Xinyue Hu?

335
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:28,369
She used to be a priest of the Immortal Clan.

336
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:52,180
Old Man?

337
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:53,990
Old Man?

338
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:00,180
Wu Geng.

339
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:05,870
You must have heard

340
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:08,140
Gui Mu calling me Mentor before.

341
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:10,410
And your mother Xinyue Hu

342
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:12,750
was also kind of my student.

343
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:16,120
Like me,

344
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,590
she practiced the divine power of the Kongshi Realm.

345
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:21,990
And she was the most talented student

346
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:24,030
I've ever seen.

347
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:27,950
She was the kindest immortal in the immortal realm.

348
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:32,030
But I never saw her again

349
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:35,710
after our farewell 20 years ago.

350
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:42,470
The relationship between Mom and Old Man

351
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:43,230
shouldn't be

352
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:44,630
that simple.

353
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:50,950
My mother once told me

354
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:53,190
the priests of the Immortal Clan

355
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:55,070
can see the future.

356
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:57,210
So she created Gou

357
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,840
in the mortal world early on.

358
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:00,310
Old Man.

359
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:03,550
You used to be a priest in the Immortal Clan too.

360
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,830
So you brought me here

361
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:07,880
because of

362
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:08,960
the future you saw?

363
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:22,010
You're indeed Prince Wu Geng.

364
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:23,490
So you know...

365
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:28,670
It's too late.

366
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:31,330
Tomorrow's training

367
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:32,760
won't be easy for you.

368
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,620
Go back and rest.

369
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:01,850
Yun Zhongzi.

370
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,040
Aren't you here

371
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,460
to teach me skills today?

372
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:05,520
Why...

373
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:10,840
He's so weak.

374
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:16,640
You violated martial arts ethics.

375
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,090
You started

376
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:19,170
before I was ready.

377
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:22,530
Brat.

378
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:25,780
This is the first lesson

379
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:26,810
I taught you.

380
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:27,710
Do it again.

381
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:28,590
Your opponents

382
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:29,910
won't wait for you to be ready

383
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:31,110
before making a move.

384
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,920
That's why you need to strike first.

385
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:37,200
Surprise is the most important element of attack.

386
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:44,130
Impressive.

387
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:45,430
Good.

388
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:50,870
What are you doing?

389
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:52,250
I'm using what I learnt.

390
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:53,910
Didn't you teach me just now?

391
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:56,160
I need to strike first.

392
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:59,070
Surprise is the most important element of attack.

393
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:05,510
Good boy. Fine.

394
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:14,220
I'll teach you the second lesson now.

395
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:18,130
In front of absolute strength,

396
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:24,860
fancy things are useless.

397
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:43,910
Stop! Stop fighting!

398
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:50,940
Isn't it just training?

399
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:52,480
Why is he hitting him hard?

400
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:54,090
This level of training

401
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:54,970
isn't enough.

402
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:56,940
I think you're doing it on purpose.

403
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:58,520
Gou!

404
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:00,180
I'm fine.

405
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,100
Brat.

406
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:09,360
Except being able to take a beating,

407
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,870
you're worthless.

408
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:13,320
How long will it take

409
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:16,260
to make you great?

410
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:22,010
Go on.

411
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:29,100
Gou!

412
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:02,910
Gou!

413
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,000
Practice hard.

414
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:14,760
That's all

415
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:15,870
for today.

416
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:17,740
Don't go.

417
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,200
We haven't finished yet.

418
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:21,940
You still want to fight?

419
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:24,170
If I beat you again, you'll die.

420
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:26,820
With your level,

421
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:28,860
you want Lan to train you?

422
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:31,110
You don't deserve it.

423
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:04,190
Gou.

424
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:12,660
He'll survive.

425
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:15,720
He beat him unconscious first.

426
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,720
Then you treated him.

427
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,530
What are you

428
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:18,680
planning?

429
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:22,820
This is the training method of the Immortal Clan.

430
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:24,880
It's the only way to become stronger.

431
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:26,620
But Gou is a human.

432
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,470
He doesn't have divine power to protect his body like you do.

433
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:29,270
At this rate,

434
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:30,260
he'll die

435
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,880
without learning anything.

436
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:35,530
When he wakes up, remember to give him the medicine.

437
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:52,600
What is the Immortal Clan

438
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,130
up to?

439
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:55,830
No.

440
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,050
We finally escaped

441
00:24:57,050 --> 00:24:58,450
from the mine.

442
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:00,430
We can't die here.

443
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:21,190
Give Gou back to me!

444
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:27,110
You want to leave?

445
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:27,940
Yes.

446
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:30,340
Okay. I'll give you a lift.

447
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:35,080
Gou!

448
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:38,780
Gou!

449
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:53,910
Master.

450
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:01,300
Where is Bai Cai?

451
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:03,030
She left.

452
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:04,980
She left?

453
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:11,320
Wait.

454
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:16,030
Are you leaving with her?

455
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:17,950
It's too dangerous outside.

456
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:19,230
I'm going to find her.

457
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:26,870
Bai Cai.

458
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:29,760
Bai Cai.

459
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:03,470
Bai Cai.

460
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:05,690
Gou. You're awake.

461
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:06,590
I knew

462
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:08,020
you would come to me.

463
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,110
Bai Cai.

464
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:10,680
Why do you want to leave?

465
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,290
Gou.

466
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:16,910
I think people in Shenyin Village

467
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:18,600
are even more unreasonable

468
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,730
than Cai in the mine.

469
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:20,930
And Lan.

470
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:22,350
I said I wanted to take you away.

471
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:23,520
She sent me here

472
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:25,140
with a swarm of butterflies.

473
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:27,230
Gou.

474
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:29,270
Before they come,

475
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:30,630
let's leave here.

476
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:31,410
Okay?

477
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:35,520
Bai Cai.

478
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:37,610
I can't

479
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:39,660
leave Shenyin Village now.

480
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:40,980
Why?

481
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:43,410
You were almost beaten to death by them.

482
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:49,000
Gou.

483
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:50,940
Do you know

484
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:52,120
why Old Man showed up

485
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,000
when we left the mine?

486
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,480
Ling?

487
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,310
Yes. It was Ling.

488
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:02,240
He gave me Ling

489
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:04,070
in order to spy on us.

490
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
It can't be.

491
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:08,160
Why not?

492
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:09,430
We have no idea

493
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:11,180
what they want to use you for.

494
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:14,900
Bai Cai.

495
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:16,890
No matter what they'll use me for,

496
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:18,350
I can't

497
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:20,280
leave Shenyin Village now.

498
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:21,860
I want to save

499
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:23,290
more slaves like us.

500
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:24,750
Think about it.

501
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:26,130
If we really

502
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:27,680
leave Shenyin Village now,

503
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:29,230
who will teach me divine power

504
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:30,830
to defeat the Immortal Clan?

505
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:33,230
But your injuries...

506
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,070
You'll be beaten to death

507
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:37,290
before you finish your cultivation.

508
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:39,340
If I can't even

509
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:40,170
endure pain

510
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,560
and injuries,

511
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:43,290
how will I

512
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:44,460
attack the Immortal Clan

513
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:46,320
and defeat Hei Long in the future?

514
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:49,190
Bai Cai.

515
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:50,670
Don't worry.

516
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,120
In this place,

517
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,710
even children are so powerful.

518
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:55,440
If they wanted to hurt us,

519
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,460
they wouldn't

520
00:28:56,490 --> 00:28:57,970
train me like this.

521
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,440
Gou.

522
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:04,040
What if they want to use you

523
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,150
to attack Hei Long?

524
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,880
That's exactly what I want.

525
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,600
Alright. Let's go back.

526
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,030
Let's go.

527
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,320
♫Why don't you go with them?♫

528
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:45,860
♫Let wind and sand swallow you up♫

529
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,230
♫This desert is so vast♫

530
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:50,560
♫It's beyond the horizon♫

531
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,780
♫The sky is boundless♫

532
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:57,270
♫The land is a river made of desolation♫

533
00:29:57,290 --> 00:30:00,680
♫And what are you?♫

534
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:05,400
♫People are so small♫

535
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:09,990
♫Still waiting for the lost sparks♫

536
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:18,070
♫Go straight, believe, and look up♫

537

♫They said silence♫

538
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:21,180
♫Is the fragility of the ordinary people♫

539
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:23,160

♫Only relying on dreams will not last long♫

544
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,280
was really hard to find.

545
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,560
Okay. The water is perfect.

546
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:30,640
♫Learn to let go, bend down, and lower your head♫

547
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,400
You can go in.

548
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,440
Gou.

549
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:31,720
♫Even if no one praises you♫

550
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,520
Go to the training ground immediately.

551
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,200
Master.

552
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,000
Are we going to continue training

553
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:35,560
or do something else?

554
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,200
Training.

555
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:36,440
Okay.

556
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,320
Wait, Gou.

557
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:38,920
Lan.

558
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:39,760
Can't you let Gou

559
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,120
take a herbal bath before going?

560
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:41,840
Bai Cai.

561
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,600
Put it here.

562
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,760
I'll do it when I'm back.

563
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,040
It'll be cold when you come back.

564
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,120
Gou suffered a lot of injuries

565
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,080
during training.

566
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,470
He can only recover after taking a herbal bath.

567
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:49,520
Can't you wait until he recovers from his injuries

568
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,230
before going?

569
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:50,920
If enemies break in

570
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,120
at this time,

571
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,630
do we have to wait for him to take a bath first?

572
00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:55,510
These things are useless.

573
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,150
It's just a waste of time.

574
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:02,600
Mortals' cultivation

575
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,530
should start with qi cultivation.

576
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,830
Open the eyes of your heart through cultivation

577
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:08,590
and form a cycle of the breath.

578
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:11,080
It makes qi keep moving in your body.

579
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:13,110
If you don't have divine power,

580
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:15,360
you need strength, reaction, speed,

581
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,760
and other abilities

582
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,710
to maximize qi.

583
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,230
Then is my Fire of Chaos

584
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,520
divine power or qi?

585
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,870
The Fire of Chaos is divine power.

586
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:28,000
You can use it.

587
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,680
It means

588
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,880
you have some divine power in your body.

589
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,640
This is what makes you different

590
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,900
from ordinary people.

591
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,520
It must be because Mom

592
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,520
was from the Immortal Clan.

593
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,280
I'm half

594
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,280
immortal,

595
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,320
so I have divine power.

596
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,200
Immortals are born with divine power.

597
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,430
Qi cultivation can integrate the human body

598
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:47,690
with heaven and earth.

599
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:50,240
Qi cultivation can solidify qi.

600
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,360
The form of qi

601
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,640
can further

602
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,470
stimulate the divine power in your body.

603
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:56,200
The two complement each other.

604
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:57,720
Now,

605
00:31:58,110 --> 00:32:00,160
find the eyes of your heart.

606
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,200
Once you master qi cultivation,

607
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,360
you can really

608
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,820
control the Fire of Chaos.

609
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:08,320
So the reason you asked me to be beaten every day

610
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,000
and go to Mr. Yuan Yi's place to hammer iron

611
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,260
is for qi cultivation?

612
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:13,200
That's right.

613
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,270
Give me your hand.

614
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,880
I'll give you some divine power.

615
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,540
Try to control the curse mark.

616
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,720
It really works, Master.

617
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:56,040
What are you doing here?

618
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:56,830
Get out.

619
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,320
I just want to remind you.

620
00:33:58,590 --> 00:33:59,600
You're too close

621
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,720
to Gou.

622
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,200
I'm not happy.

623
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:04,240
What does it have to do with me?

624
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,510
I'm completing the task

625
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:06,710
given by High Priest.

626
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,080
He asked me to teach Gou skills.

627
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,650
You have no right to interfere.

628
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:11,000
Teach him skills?

629
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:13,480
Do you need to hold hands

630
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,610
to teach him skills?

631
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:15,800
Besides,

632
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:17,510
you smiled at him.

633
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:18,679
Lan.

634
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:20,120
I've known you for so long.

635
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,000
You never smiled at me.

636
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:21,960
Even just once.

637
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:25,239
Zi Dian.

638
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,360
Listen.

639
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:28,159
Teaching Gou skills

640
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:29,679
is of great significance

641
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:31,000
to Shenyin Village

642
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,330
and High Priest's plan.

643
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:33,040
I don't want

644
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,500
to be disturbed by anyone,

645
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,719
including you.

646
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,210
I thought in your heart,

647
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,449
I'm different from others.

648
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:43,840
He's just

649
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,880
a humble human.

650
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,040
He doesn't deserve to be treated well by you.

651
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,120
Zi Dian, stop talking.

652
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:48,920
Leave.

653
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,199
If you spy on us again in the future,

654
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:53,130
I'll tell Clan Leader and High Priest

655
00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:55,199
you're disrupting our training.

656
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:00,400
Also,

657
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:02,600
from now on,

658
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,030
don't step into my room again.

659
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:37,670
♫Why don't you go with them?♫

660
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:40,210
♫Let wind and sand swallow you up♫

661
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:41,570
♫This desert is so vast♫

662
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:44,910
♫It's beyond the horizon♫

663
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:47,130
♫The sky is boundless♫

664
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:51,620
♫The land is a river made of desolation♫

665
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:55,030
♫And what are you?♫

666
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:59,750
♫People are so small♫

667
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:04,330
♫Still waiting for the lost sparks♫

668
00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:12,420
♫Go straight, believe, and look up♫

669
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:14,210
♫They said silence♫

670
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:15,530
♫Is the fragility of the ordinary people♫

671
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:17,510
♫Who shouted themselves hoarse♫

672
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:18,880
♫They said it's dark ahead♫

673
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:20,340
♫Like beasts appearing in herds♫

674
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:22,810
♫Only relying on dreams will not last long♫

675
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:24,990
♫Learn to let go, bend down, and lower your head♫

♫Even if no one praises you♫

677

♫The sparks which meet power♫

♫Is more worth♫

♫Handing over the burning freedom♫

682
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,310
Every move was quick and clean.

683
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:55,040
You found the position by listening to the sound. Every punch was precise.

684
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,150
Good for you.

685
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:57,660
You've only been in Shenyin Village

686
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:58,780
for half a month.

687
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,600
You've made such great progress.

688
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,160
I believe

689
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,400
you'll be good at

690
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,320
using qi

691
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,150
and control the Fire of Chaos soon.

692
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,520
Old Man.

693
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,720
I don't think my progress

694
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,720
is fast enough.

695
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,600
My fists aren't powerful enough

696
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,880
to fight against my enemies.

697
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,780
With my current rate of progress,

698
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:21,960
when can I

699
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,540
fight against my enemies?

700
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:27,040
Come, Kid.

701
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:32,280
Use all your strength to attack me.

702
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,800
The speed of your punches

703
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,800
has revealed

704
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,200
that you're too anxious.

705
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:16,240
You shouldn't be anxious when facing enemies.

706
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,440
Speed is important,

707
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,720
but in front of absolute power,

708
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,040
all skills

709
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,240
will become useless.

710
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,710
And your anxiety

711
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:26,400
will only make the power you gained

712
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,670
become as weak

713
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:31,080
as a castle in the air.

714
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:33,720
Old Man.

715
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,100
Am I practicing the wrong way?

716
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:39,880
You have a long way to go.

717
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:41,880
Don't rush.

718
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:44,240
Wu Geng.

719
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:50,040
Yes. Wu Geng.

720
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:53,990
I had been in Northern Mountain Mine for many years.

721
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:55,800
I almost forgot whether my name

722
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:59,350
is Wu Geng or Gou.

723
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:10,080
Kid, tell me.

724
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:13,570
Do you remember

725
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,520
who your real enemy is?

726
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:16,550
It's Hei Long.

727
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,400
Every night when I close my eyes,

728
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,320
what appear in front of me

729
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,960
are the figure of my father

730
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,070
who was killed but still standing

731
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:27,660
during the war of Xin State,

732
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:30,540
the fire on Zhaixing Pavilion,

733
00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:33,730
and the innocent people of Xin State

734
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,970
who were tragically killed by the Immortal Clan.

735
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:40,040
Hei Long thinks of humans as ants.

736
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:41,560
They treat us

737
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:42,720
as their tools

738
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,320
for digging up bloodstones.

739
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,610
I hate that I'm not capable enough.

740
00:39:46,790 --> 00:39:47,840
I can't appear

741
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,400
in front of Hei Long immediately

742
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,520
and kill him

743
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,680
to avenge the deaths of my father, mother,

744
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,320
and the people of Xin State.

745
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,560
One day in the future,

746
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,520
I'll make Hei Long know

747
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:00,880
that the human race

748
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:02,710
can't be underestimated.

749
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,240
Good.

750
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,520
I'm glad

751
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,450
you have such fighting spirit.

752
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,120
And I also believe

753
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:14,720
one day in the future,

754
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,360
you'll be able to do it.

755
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,000
But don't forget

756
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,560
that your enemy

757
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,200
is the most powerful being

758
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,720
in this world.

759
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:26,590
If you want to defeat him,

760
00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:27,800
in addition to

761
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,390
constantly improving your strength,

762
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:31,400
you must learn to wait.

763
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:34,000
Because time

764
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:35,520
can not only

765
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,080
improve your strength

766
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:39,440
but also make you

767
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,270
stronger inside.

768
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,720
In 100,000 years,

769
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,900
Hei Long has never been defeated.

770
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,920
If you want to defeat him,

771
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,280
you have to improve your strength

772
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,960
in practice,

773
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,160
make yourself brave and resourceful,

774
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:00,320
and make more people love

775
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,560
and support you.

776
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:02,710
Only in this way

777
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,910
can you walk up to him

778
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:06,440
step by step

779
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:07,880
and defeat him.

780
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,080
You can have anger.

781
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,560
Because anger

782
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:12,720
can guide you.

783
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,440
But you can't let anger

784
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,440
destroy your sanity.

785
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,230
Old Man.

786
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,630
I understood.

787
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:23,630
Don't worry.

788
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:26,360
No matter how long it takes,

789
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,560
I'll never give up.
