00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:38,050
[Episode 24]

4
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:40,450
Weren't you just talking about

5
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:41,250
atonement?

6
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,039
Actually,

7
00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:43,770
it was all your own

8
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,130
wishful thinking.

9
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,289
To think you call yourself Shi Xing the Immortal.

10
00:01:47,289 --> 00:01:49,850
You're selfish, foolish, cowardly, and incompetent.

11
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:50,520
You knew

12
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,450
the Immortal Clan would oppose your wedding with Mingyue,

13
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:54,050
and that they would kill her.

14
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,580
But you insisted on holding the wedding.

15
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,729
In the end,

16
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:59,289
Mingyue and the people

17
00:01:59,289 --> 00:02:00,970
of Liusha City all died because of you.

18
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:02,440
That is proof of your selfishness and foolishness.

19
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,080
No.

20
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:04,770
You knew the real murderer was the Immortal Clan.

21
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:04,930
No.

22
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:06,090
But you didn't dare to take revenge.

23
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:08,360
You used death as an excuse to escape.

24
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:10,250
That is proof of your cowardice.

25
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,000
It's not like that.

26
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:14,600
It's not like that?

27
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,410
Then prove it to us.

28
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,250
As the governor of the King's City,

29
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:19,890
you failed to protect anyone.

30
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,660
You've been defeated long ago.

31
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,730
Even the human race

32
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:24,000
you despise the most

33
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,400
dare to oppose Hei Long

34
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,600
and the Immortal Clan.

35
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,660
The Demon Clan

36
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,980
has never given up for 100,000 years.

37
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:31,150
But what about you?

38
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,700
Shi Xing. Fight.

39
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:35,770
Use your power

40
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:37,640
to fulfill your mission

41
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,280
and your responsibility.

42
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:06,390
I...

43
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:09,590
I will fight.

44
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,690
Welcome to the team,

45
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:12,650
Shi Xing.

46
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,780
Since Xin King died,

47
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:16,010
I've been waiting for

48
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:18,440
the next body to be reborn in the fire.

49
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,510
Shi Xing.

50
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:21,280
Are you willing to make

51
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,670
a contract with me

52
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:24,670
and spread the flame of rebellion

53
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,340
to the guilty immortals?

54
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,700
I am.

55
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:45,460
From now on,

56
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,060
you will suffer

57
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:49,310
the burning pain every day.

58
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:51,500
Every time you endure the burning,

59
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,030
you will gain more power,

60
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:54,220
until the last flame burns out.

61
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:56,630
until the last flame burns out.

62
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,570
I want to go back and protect the city.

63
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:36,440
Wu Geng,

64
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,730
when you need me,

65
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:39,650
I'll come to you immediately.

66
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,580
Few people live in this house.

67
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,760
Once it's vacant,

68
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:03,570
it would be a little lonely.

69
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,370
Grand Marshal, why are you here?

70
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:06,370
Ms. Bai Cai.

71
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,650
These days,

72
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:09,500
you've helped our people a lot.

73
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:12,880
How about I give you a gift?

74
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:13,610
What do you think?

75
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:15,080
Sure. What gift?

76
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:19,870
Grand Marshal!

77
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:25,460
Grand Marshal!

78
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,290
This skill is called the Air Vanishing Spell.

79
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:31,650
It's a secret skill of our clan.

80
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:33,170
It can bypass any constraints in the region

81
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:35,710
and allow the user to instantly teleport oneself.

82
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:36,909
I see.

83
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,400
No wonder it's called the Air Vanishing Spell.

84
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,210
It's amazing.

85
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:40,780
If you want to learn,

86
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:41,890
I can teach you.

87
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:43,670
Thank you, Grand Marshal.

88
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:53,610
Tell me,

89
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,000
how many fruits fell on the ground?

90
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:04,530
Grand Marshal.

91
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:05,480
Are you kidding me?

92
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,000
How can we count them?

93
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,230
You don't count

94
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:09,730
the amount of items.

95
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:11,250
You feel it.

96
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:13,040
The key to the Air Vanishing Spell

97
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,290
is not to travel through space by itself,

98
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:16,620
but to include space

99
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:18,770
in your consciousness.

100
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,170
This way, you can physically reach

101
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:21,640
where your consciousness can reach.

102
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,890
If you want to physically get somewhere,

103
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:24,810
your consciousness must reach there first.

104
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:27,240
So if you want to master the Air Vanishing Spell,

105
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,490
you need to train your consciousness.

106
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:44,640
From now on,

107
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,010
you'll train your

108
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,920
senses this way.

109
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:48,860
You need to sense

110
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:50,150
the specific number of fruits there are

111
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:51,790
before they hit the ground.

112
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:57,280
The secret to sensing

113
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,430
will be uncovered

114
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:00,970
through your hard work and practice.

115
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:02,560
Bai Cai.

116
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,170
You have the physique of the Crystal Glory.

117
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:06,320
You can do it.

118
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:09,340
Thank you, Grand Marshal.

119
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:10,750
I'll practice hard.

120
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:14,380
But I specially picked these fruits

121
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,270
for Dr. Mu.

122
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:20,600
Keep practicing.

123
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:39,700
Bai State is far away.

124
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:41,490
I wonder when

125
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:44,220
we'll get to meet again in the future.

126
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,290
Bai Cai.

127
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:49,600
I hope you can help me

128
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,810
apologize to Lan.

129
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,330
I'm sorry about

130
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,740
what happened before.

131
00:07:58,930 --> 00:07:59,760
Actually...

132
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,610
I resented you

133
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,330
when you hurt Lan back then.

134
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:06,160
But I figured it out later.

135
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:07,800
You also have someone

136
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,740
who you desperately want to protect.

137
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,950
So you just made

138
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,740
the right choice for you.

139
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,050
But don't worry.

140
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:16,370
Lan told me.

141
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,100
She doesn't blame you anymore.

142
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:22,280
But the person I want to protect

143
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:26,370
doesn't have me in his heart.

144
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:30,010
Wu.

145
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,450
I understand you.

146
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:37,330
How can you understand me?

147
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:40,350
You and Gou are so happy together.

148
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,090
Wherever you go,

149
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,090
you can accompany each other.

150
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:48,520
As for us,

151
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:51,650
I cherish every chance I get

152
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:54,490
to have a glimpse of him.

153
00:08:58,050 --> 00:08:59,050
Wu.

154
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,880
I really envy you.

155
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,850
Envy?

156
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,430
Me?

157
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:08,000
Don't comfort me, Bai Cai.

158
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:11,270
Think about it. You're meticulous, gentle,

159
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:13,070
intelligent, and skillful.

160
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,490
You can protect and help

161
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,660
the person you like.

162
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:16,920
Unlike me.

163
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,320
Most of the time,

164
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,880
I'm a burden to Gou.

165
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,310
I can't do anything.

166
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,290
Actually, I know

167
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,080
why he doesn't accept me.

168
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,880
Grand Marshal

169
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,410
is the leader

170
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:42,520
of the Demon Clan.

171
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:43,730
He has to shoulder

172
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:45,260
so many responsibilities.

173
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,720
But I'm sure

174
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:48,850
he's waiting for the right time

175
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:49,850
to confess to you.

176
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,480
I hope so.

177
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,360
But

178
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:02,780
I really envy

179
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,770
you and Gou.

180
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,200
You can express your love

181
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,520
for each other freely.

182
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:09,280
Actually, Gou

183
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,770
has many shortcomings.

184
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:11,850
Come closer.

185
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:14,050
Once...

186
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,730
All right.

187
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,720
Why are you upset?

188
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,970
Sir, I'll miss you.

189
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,130
Remember to come back.

190
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:07,010
Come back and visit me.

191
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:11,090
I will

192
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,320
definitely come back to see you.

193
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:18,530
Little Dragonfly.

194
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:19,800
This is a gift

195
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,000
for you.

196
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:23,200
It will accompany you

197
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,130
in my stead.

198
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:32,600
Look at its little wings!

199
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,780
Thank you, Sir.

200
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,330
And you, Lan.

201
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,430
Bai Cai.

202
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:49,220
I don't want you to leave either.

203
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:52,570
You have to come back and visit me.

204
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:54,240
Don't worry, Little Dragonfly.

205
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,970
This is also my home.

206
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,830
You're all my family.

207
00:11:57,930 --> 00:11:59,370
Lan and I will come back

208
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:00,370
and visit you often,

209
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:01,450
okay?

210
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:06,760
Gou.

211
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:11,010
This is the messenger crystal of the Demon Realm.

212
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:12,770
As long as you activate it,

213
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:14,530
I can hear

214
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:15,610
your words.

215
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:17,210
No matter how far apart we are,

216
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:18,410
as long as you need me,

217
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,560
I will be there.

218
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,040
Gou.

219
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,570
Once the ship is built,

220
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,680
you must inform me.

221
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:29,050
Grand Marshal.

222
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:31,640
Xinyue Kui used the Flower of Dawn

223
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:33,620
to massacre the Demon Clan citizens.

224
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:36,250
I will let you avenge them.

225
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,290
I can't wait

226
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:40,610
to see the day

227
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:42,410
the Immortal Clan faces defeat.

228
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,850
It's a long journey. Have a safe trip.

229
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:49,290
See you.

230
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:12,090
Take care. See you.

231
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:12,650
Take care.

232
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:14,680
Have a safe journey.

233
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:22,650
[Gongchen Gate]

234
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:33,040
Gou, we're finally home.

235
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:53,070
What's wrong, Gou?

236
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,230
Aren't you happy that we're back home?

237
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,860
This

238
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:59,870
is no longer our home.

239
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:04,850
[Gongchen Gate]

240
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:14,440
I thought the people would live a hard life

241
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,280
under Bai State's rule.

242
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:16,340
[Gongchen Gate]

243
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,010
Now that I look at it,

244
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:19,810
it doesn't seem that bad.

245
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,200
Bai Cai.

246
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:25,820
Have you noticed it?

247
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:26,900
There isn't

248
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,480
a single young and strong man

249
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,240
here.

250
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:30,900
You're right.

251
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:31,850
Have they been

252
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:33,640
taken to the mine to dig?

253
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:36,930
Gou.

254
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,070
Do you feel it?

255
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,820
A mysterious power is

256
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:41,730
covering the whole capital.

257
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:43,090
I'm afraid people from the

258
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,730
Immortal Realm are watching us.

259
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:45,790
It doesn't matter.

260
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,370
I can use

261
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:49,040
the divine power of the Colorless Realm

262
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,480
to stop the divine power of the Kongshi Realm from spying on us.

263
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,990
As long as you are by my side,

264
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:54,460
you won't be in any danger.

265
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:56,760
If I'm not here,

266
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,330
you must be careful.

267
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:01,530
Xinyue Kui won't

268
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:02,810
come to the mortal world so easily.

269
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:04,450
Now that you've defeated Shi Xing,

270
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:06,640
the remaining six tribes are no match for you.

271
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,830
I'm afraid Xinyue Kui

272
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:08,880
will use even more vile methods

273
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,810
to deal with you.

274
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:10,960
Don't worry.

275
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:14,380
I'm only afraid that she won't show up.

276
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:23,000
The divine power of the Colorless Realm?

277
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:42,000
Wu Geng.

278
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:45,250
Although you used the divine power of the Colorless Realm

279
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,330
to block my Kongshi Realm,

280
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:49,920
in the three realms,

281
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:51,680
only you and the King of Immortals

282
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,370
can use the Colorless Realm.

283
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,460
Your cover-up will only confirm that

284
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,920
you are in the capital.

285
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:02,880
Move.

286
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:04,980
[Gongchen Gate]

287
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:19,810
[Gongchen Gate]

288
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:21,650
Now that Bai State

289
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,410
is under the control of Gui Mu and the Immortal Clan,

290
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:25,140
there are dangers everywhere.

291
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:26,250
We need to find

292
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:27,290
our allies.

293
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,320
Zhou Qiao

294
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,890
could be an opportunity.

295
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,690
He isn't as loyal

296
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:33,040
to the Immortal Clan

297
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:33,970
as it seems.

298
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,930
Zhou Qiao, as the prince of Bai,

299
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:36,530
took the man-eating Gui Mu

300
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:37,970
as his godfather.

301
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:40,250
Will he really betray the Immortal Clan?

302
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:41,570
He will.

303
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,850
We can't stay here for long.

304
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:45,650
I'll go find a shipwright first.

305
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:46,530
Lan.

306
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,610
Take Bai Cai to the kids.

307
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:49,730
No need.

308
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:50,900
I know the way to the Orphan Village.

309
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,080
I can go back by myself.

310
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:52,960
Lan. Gou.

311
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,290
Focus on your tasks. Don't worry about me.

312
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:56,090
Okay.

313
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,970
I'll contact the Shenyin Clan.

314
00:16:58,610 --> 00:16:59,410
Okay.

315
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,410
Once Clan Leader Kong Que and the others arrive,

316
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:02,490
come to us.

317
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:03,690
Remember,

318
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,410
don't use divine power

319
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,329
unless you absolutely have to.

320
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,319
Be careful.

321
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:11,510
Be careful.

322
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:27,810
This is strange.

323
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:30,820
There are no grains, the fields are barren,

324
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:31,690
and I didn't see any

325
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:33,120
restaurants along the way.

326
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,130
What are the people surviving on?

327
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:37,250
But judging from

328
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:38,600
the crowd at the market,

329
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,000
they didn't seem malnourished either.

330
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:13,520
What happened?

331
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:22,680
Move! Move!

332
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,110
If the monster resists,

333
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:25,310
kill it immediately.

334
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,620
Kill! Kill!

335
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:52,250
General An!

336
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:53,570
Kill! Kill!

337
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:56,010
General An, it's me.

338
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:57,500
Don't you recognize me?

339
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,770
Are you from Xin?

340
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:10,580
If you're from Xin, go fight and kill!

341
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:15,860
Offer the blood of the immortals to our king!

342
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,340
To our King!

343
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:19,320
You...

344
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,460
You must protect His Highness.

345
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:24,680
I...

346
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:28,340
I failed to protect

347
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,000
His Highness.

348
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,850
I failed to protect him.

349
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:34,230
How could they

350
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,290
hurt you like this?

351
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,030
Let's go.

352
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:45,800
Biggie, Crybaby.

353
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,850
Snotty, Glutton.

354
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,310
I'm home.

355
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:51,490
Crybaby, Snotty.

356
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:54,060
Glutton. I'm back.

357
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:40,910
Let's go.

358
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:45,190
It hurts!

359
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:58,620
-It hurts!
-General An.

360
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:00,140
General An!

361
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:02,880
General An!

362
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:07,380
General An, listen!

363
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,970
The Immortal Clan is invading. Stand by for instructions.

364
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:11,230
No mistake is allowed.

365
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:23,700
If there's a war, summon him back.

366
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,060
Summon him back.

367
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:30,190
If there's a war, summon him back.

368
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:33,480
If there's a war, summon him back.

369
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:36,630
If there's a war, summon him back.

370
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,830
If there's a war, summon him back.

371
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,010
Uncle Ziyu once said

372
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:42,230
the lian qi technique can connect

373
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:43,800
with all lives in this world.

374
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,060
I can only give it a try.

375
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,780
General An.

376
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:14,990
It's me.

377
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:16,520
I'm Wu Geng.

378
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,300
General An?

379
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,160
General An.

380
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,210
Your Highness?

381
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:38,060
Your Highness!

382
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,210
Are you alright?

383
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,290
Your Highness, it's you!

384
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:55,890
Your Highness.

385
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,930
You're finally here!

386
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,950
Bai Cai!

387
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,370
Get up.

388
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:13,130
Bai Cai is back!

389
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:14,040
Biggie, Crybaby.

390
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:14,520
Snotty.

391
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,600
Bai Cai! Bai Cai!

392
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,680
I miss you so much.

393
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,010
Did you miss me?

394
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:19,980
Yes.

395
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,440
I miss you so much.

396
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,300
Good children.

397
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,010
I miss you too.

398
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:24,330
You won't leave again, right?

399
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:25,650
Why are you back so late?

400
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:27,980
What took you so long?

401
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:29,090
Bai Cai,

402
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,850
I thought I'd never see you again.

403
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:32,970
Poor thing.

404
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,310
Bai Cai, where's Gou?

405
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:37,930
Why isn't he back?

406
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:38,690
Gou

407
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:39,760
has something to do.

408
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,920
He'll be back soon.

409
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:41,990
Bai Cai,

410
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,150
you and Gou

411
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:45,110
didn't send any news back in the past years.

412
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:46,810
We were so worried.

413
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:49,480
I'm sorry

414
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:51,090
for making you suffer.

415
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,850
Bai Cai.

416
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,210
How did you escape

417
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:55,250
from the mine?

418
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:56,080
Don't they say that

419
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:56,640
once you go there,

420
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,170
you can never come back?

421
00:23:58,390 --> 00:23:59,380
Well...

422
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:01,130
That's because Gou

423
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,360
is very smart.

424
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:03,730
I'll tell you

425
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:04,320
all about the mine later.

426
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,320
Okay.

427
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:05,970
How about this?

428
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:06,880
You sweep the floor.

429
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,130
Okay.

430
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:07,930
You wash the dishes.

431
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:09,050
You clean the table.

432
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:09,930
You soak the sheet.

433
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:10,400
Okay?

434
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:10,730
Okay.

435
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:11,400
Go.

436
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,060
Let's eat together later.

437
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,170
Eat?

438
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:17,570
You must be starving.

439
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:20,810
No?

440
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,210
Glutton.

441
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:24,790
You're not hungry either?

442
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:25,970
Bai Cai.

443
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:27,560
We don't eat food anymore.

444
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:28,560
What?

445
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,090
Then what do you eat?

446
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:31,200
Take a guess.

447
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,080
Don't you get hungry?

448
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:32,840
Bai Cai.

449
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,210
We eat this now.

450
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:35,600
Yes, we eat this.

451
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:37,480
This is mine.

452
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,940
It's mine.

453
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,600
Bai Cai.

454
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,060
We don't eat food anymore.

455
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:46,340
We eat this.

456
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:47,210
We won't grow up

457
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:48,480
or grow old.

458
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:09,600
Greetings, Godfather.

459
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:13,220
I heard from Chen Jing

460
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:16,930
that you're very talented in the lian qi technique

461
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,770
and you've reached a very high level.

462
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:24,370
I'm really happy for you.

463
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:25,520
Godfather,

464
00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:27,690
you urgently summoned me back to Bai capital.

465
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:28,820
What can I do for you?

466
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:31,810
Bai King is sick.

467
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:34,930
You've been cultivating at Chen Jing's place

468
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:36,840
for so many years.

469
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:39,040
You've made great progress.

470
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,420
But the country

471
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:45,210
needs a king.

472
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:49,130
So I urgently summoned you back

473
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:51,230
to handle state affairs.

474
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:57,950
No wonder when I went to see Father just now,

475
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,690
I was stopped by the attendant.

476
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:01,280
Godfather,

477
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:02,340
when can I

478
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,330
see Father?

479
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,020
What's the hurry?

480
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:08,850
When he gets better,

481
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:12,570
I'll take you to him.

482
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:18,890
I won't let you

483
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:20,100
or Father down.

484
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:23,010
I will continue to serve the Immortal Clan.

485
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,970
You're filial.

486
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:32,650
You're filial.

487
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:35,730
Godfather, are you tired?

488
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:37,090
Let me help you rest on the bed.

489
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:38,530
Don't touch me.

490
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,780
Don't touch me.

491
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,880
I can do it myself.

492
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,130
Godfather, do you remember

493
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,560
the rebel

494
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,860
we met in the Northern Mountain Mine,

495
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:55,910
Wu Geng, the son of Xin King?

496
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:00,090
Wu Geng?

497
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:04,170
You saw him?

498
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:05,300
Yes.

499
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,050
I saw him with my own eyes today.

500
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:09,410
He came back to Bai capital

501
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:11,880
with that female slave.

502
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:15,960
That girl

503
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,640
has ancient divine power in her body.

504
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:21,060
If I eat her,

505
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:24,330
I'll definitely recover completely.

506
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:27,580
Qiao,

507
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,400
immediately go find out their whereabouts

508
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,520
without delay.

509
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:31,340
Okay.

510
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,450
Wait.

511
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:36,240
Don't alert them.

512
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:39,730
I want them alive.

513
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,440
Okay.

514
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,240
Greetings...

515
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:04,750
Greetings, Your Highness.

516
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,240
Welcome back to the city.

517
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:17,650
Xin State has been destroyed.

518
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,770
I'm no longer a prince.

519
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:21,420
Didn't I tell you before?

520
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:24,110
Call me Gou.

521
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:27,850
Okay.

522
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:30,820
Prince Gou.

523
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:34,000
No.

524
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:36,940
Your Highness.

525
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:39,560
No.

526
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:47,860
No matter who you become,

527
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,750
in my heart,

528
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:54,130
you'll always be my prince.

529
00:28:58,950 --> 00:28:59,750
General An,

530
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:01,450
tell me

531
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:02,950
what on earth happened.

532
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:06,670
Back then, after you left,

533
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:09,000
Zhou Qiao and the others

534
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,460
found out my whereabouts.

535
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,160
I didn't want to implicate the kids,

536
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:15,570
so I started to hide.

537
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:19,390
Later, I couldn't find any food

538
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,610
in the city.

539
00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:24,810
I had nothing to eat

540
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:27,330
for a few days in a row.

541
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,570
Later, I found out

542
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:33,220
the civilians seemed to be eating

543
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:35,450
a fruit called the Eternal Fruit.

544
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:37,450
What is this?

545
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:38,570
It's scary.

546
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:39,290
Bai Cai,

547
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:40,530
this is called the Eternal Fruit.

548
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:41,770
You won't be hungry for a few days

549
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:43,210
after you eat even just a small one.

550
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:44,320
Yes, Bai Cai.

551
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,930
Eating this has allowed us

552
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:48,130
to live healthily till now all these years.

553
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:50,210
It is said that the fruit

554
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:52,060
is from the Immortal Realm.

555
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,500
It's something from the Immortal Realm?

556
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,600
Yes.

557
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:59,180
The Eternal Fruit is everywhere.

558
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,090
When I was cornered,

559
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:04,800
I was starving.

560
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:07,710
So I ate one.

561
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,940
But when I just put it in my mouth,

562
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:11,470
I felt something was wrong.

563
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,040
I did see

564
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,360
many strange trees

565
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,610
on the way.

566
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:16,970
There are many

567
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:18,170
weird fruits on them.

568
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:20,300
Could it be...

569
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,650
those are Eternal Fruits?

570
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:25,780
This is for Bai Cai.

571
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,810
Bai Cai, eat.

572
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:29,520
It's very delicious.

573
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,010
Yes, Bai Cai.

574
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:32,380
It's very delicious.

575
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,190
You can't eat the fruits.

576
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,740
They

577
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:38,360
look very strange.

578
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:40,910
You have stopped eating them, right?

579
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:42,630
I've stopped eating them.

580
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:47,530
But that thing is really weird.

581
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:50,240
Not long after I stopped eating them,

582
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,750
I felt uncomfortable all over my body.

583
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:55,520
There was always a voice in my mind

584
00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:58,290
asking me to continue to eat.

585
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,900
When I realized it,

586
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:03,570
my body was already covered with...

587
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:06,630
Your Highness,

588
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,310
what is given by the Immortal Realm

589
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:10,070
is definitely not a good thing.

590
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,030
It's right not to eat it.

591
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,270
It will corrupt your mind

592
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,000
and eventually kill you.

593
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:20,810
All these years,

594
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:25,120
I tried my best to control myself.

595
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:26,520
That was how I stopped myself

596
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,850
from continuing to eat the Eternal Fruit.

597
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:30,740
I've been eating tree barks

598
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:33,510
and drinking dirty water.

599
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:36,690
I don't know

600
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:38,490
how I managed to make it through.

601
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:43,080
Since I'm back,

602
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:45,020
I won't leave easily.

603
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,930
And I won't let you

604
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,290
live like this anymore.

605
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:56,010
Good.

606
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,170
General An,

607
00:31:57,970 --> 00:31:59,250
I pretended to be a man-eating monster

608
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,810
in the mine before

609
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:02,640
in order to save the miners.

610
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:04,020
Why is there

611
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,060
really a man-eating monster now?

612
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:08,230
I also think this is strange.

613
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:10,580
The man-eating monster

614
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:12,800
is a rumor in recent years.

615
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:15,020
Right,

616
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,640
the rumor about the man-eating monster

617
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,670
emerged

618
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:22,330
not long after the Eternal Fruit appeared.

619
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,040
The man-eating monster?

620
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,660
The Eternal Fruit?

621
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:34,500
Get down!

622
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,490
Bai Cai.

623
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:39,190
Hide well. Don't go out.

624
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,610
-Bai Cai.
-Bai Cai.

625
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:44,880
Ms. Bai Cai.

626
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:57,410
Long time no see, Ms. Bai Cai.

627
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:00,100
Where is Wu Geng now?

628
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:01,130
Wu Geng?

629
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:03,760
I don't know who you're talking about.

630
00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:06,690
If you

631
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:08,150
don't want to tell me here,

632
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:10,230
let's go somewhere else.

633
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,090
-Bai Cai.
-Bai Cai.

634
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:31,830
-Bai Cai.
-Bai Cai.

635
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:40,870
No!

636
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:58,140
This...

637
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:00,650
Let's go.

638
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,170
Go! Hurry!

639
00:34:09,469 --> 00:34:10,280
Who is it?

640
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:25,690
You are an immortal from the Immortal Realm.

641
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:28,340
Madam,

642
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:29,889
Bai Cai and Wu Geng

643
00:34:29,889 --> 00:34:31,480
are treacherous rebels.

644
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:32,909
I wonder

645
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:34,850
why you stopped me.

646
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,060
It's not your concern.

647
00:34:37,690 --> 00:34:39,060
In the future,

648
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,960
you can't hurt Bai Cai.

649
00:34:41,969 --> 00:34:43,239
Do you understand?

650
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:45,600
I want to share the burdens of the Immortal Realm.

651
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,330
Since you don't understand,

652
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,370
I might as well take your ears away.

653
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,040
I understand.

654
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:53,530
I understand.

655
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:07,610
Thank you for saving me.

656
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:09,540
Please show yourself.

657
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:11,620
I have my own reason for saving you.

658
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:14,350
I will let you know in the future.

659
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,670
Don't tell anyone else about this.

660
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:18,970
Otherwise, the people around you will get hurt

661
00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:20,330
and be in danger again.

662
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,400
It's so easy.

663
00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:31,410
I finally found you,

664
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:33,380
Bai Cai.

665
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:34,720
High Priest,

666
00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:38,050
what's so special about Bai Cai?

667
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,700
You don't understand.

668
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,440
Bai Cai

669
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:44,510
is the one who can kill Wu Geng.

670
00:35:44,530 --> 00:35:46,380
Now we should

671
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:48,690
seize the crucial opportunity.

672
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,350
Bai Cai

673
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:52,020
can kill Wu Geng?

674
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,050
Who Bai Cai cares most about

675
00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:55,330
is her Gou.

676
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:58,160
But I don't think she knows

677
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,880
the relationship

678
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:03,820
between her Gou and Wu Geng.

679
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:08,880
Why did those soldiers arrest you?

680
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:10,840
A few days ago,

681
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:13,600
those soldiers of Bai State

682
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,200
found out my whereabouts.

683
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,240
Maybe I look

684
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:20,640
too scary.

685
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:22,810
So they have considered me

686
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:24,340
as the man-eating monster.

687
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:25,690
Fortunately,

688
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:27,650
I'm lucky.

689
00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:30,640
Finally,

690
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:33,590
you're back.

691
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:35,730
General An,

692
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:38,200
where do you live now?

693
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:45,040
I know a place.

694
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,480
You've been

695
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:48,010
to that place before.

696
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,050
But

697
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:51,490
you can't

698
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:52,750
disclose my identity.

699
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:55,490
You should still call me Gou in the future.

700
00:36:55,490 --> 00:36:57,410
Over there! Search!

701
00:36:57,430 --> 00:36:58,960
Your Highness, be careful.

702
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,050
Don't worry. I'm here.

703
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:05,720
The door is open.

704
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:07,000
Just show yourselves.

705
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:13,060
Shitou?

706
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:14,610
De?

707
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:16,200
-Gou.
-Gou.

708
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:17,680
I was wondering

709
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:19,330
why this voice sounded so familiar.

710
00:37:19,330 --> 00:37:20,680
It's really you.

711
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,740
We're friends. We are on the same side.

712
00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:25,720
Gou,

713
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:26,760
where have you been

714
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,920
all this time?

715
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,250
We asked about you everywhere,

716
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:31,110
but we didn't find any information on you.

717
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:32,350
It's a long story.

718
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:34,760
Let's talk about you.

719
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:36,500
What happened

720
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:37,830
after you came out from the mine?

721
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:38,740
Why have you

722
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,580
become Bai State's guards?

723
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:41,310
Gou,

724
00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:42,480
we did this

725
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,530
for you.

726
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:45,570
When I was in the mine,

727
00:37:45,610 --> 00:37:46,520
I already knew your ambition

728
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,840
is not just as simple

729
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:49,130
as saving the slaves in the mine.

730
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:51,040
Under Gui Mu's control,

731
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:52,280
Bai capital is like a puppet.

732
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,010
He enslaved all the civilians.

733
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:56,850
I guessed you would definitely come to Bai capital.

734
00:37:56,850 --> 00:37:57,760
We've been waiting

735
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,000
for you here.

736
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:00,730
We have become

737
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:02,350
Bai capital's guards

738
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:03,620
to gain

739
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:05,440
first-hand information on the palace.

740
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,180
In this way, as long as you need us,

741
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:08,380
we can help you.

742
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:09,430
That's right, Gou.

743
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:10,940
No matter where you go in the future,

744
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:12,260
we'll follow you.

745
00:38:12,730 --> 00:38:13,770
Now De

746
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,980
is the captain of the guards.

747
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:16,330
I'm not worth mentioning.

748
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:17,040
I'm now

749
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,200
a guard at the library.

750
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,930
The man-eating monster has been too arrogant lately.

751
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:22,130
That's why I was ordered

752
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:23,400
to work with them temporarily.

753
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,770
I didn't expect to be so lucky

754
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:26,330
to meet you again.

755
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:28,130
With your help,

756
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:29,570
I'm sure my trip to Bai capital this time

757
00:38:29,570 --> 00:38:30,830
will be much smoother.

758
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:34,060
Gou, where is Bai Cai?

759
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:34,910
Well...

760
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:36,400
have you separated?

761
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:37,450
We would

762
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:38,850
never separate.

763
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:40,120
Let's go.

764
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:41,670
I'm going to take you to her.

765
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:42,420
Okay.

766
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:43,440
Go pack your things now.

767
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,320
This place has been exposed.

768
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,290
We can't stay here anymore. Go.

769
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:46,130
Okay, let's go.

770
00:38:46,130 --> 00:38:46,840
Pack up.

771
00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:53,880
Bai Cai,

772
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,490
the Eternal Fruit can cure all diseases.

773
00:38:55,490 --> 00:38:56,370
If you eat it,

774
00:38:56,370 --> 00:38:57,890
your wound will heal soon.

775
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:00,130
Can this fruit really cure diseases?

776
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:01,360
Yes, Bai Cai.

777
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,290
Trust us.

778
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:04,050
All these years, we've been eating the Eternal Fruit.

779
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:05,610
We've never been sick.

780
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:06,520
Eating the flesh

781
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,010
is more effective than drinking its juice.

782
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:09,650
Bai Cai, have some

783
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:10,720
and you'll recover.

784
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,120
Yes, have some.

785
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:14,330
Eat it and you'll recover.

786
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:16,170
Bai Cai, this can heal wounds.

787
00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:18,690
Bai Cai, have some.

788
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,210
Eat it, Bai Cai.

789
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:21,600
-Have some.
-Have some.

790
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,890
-Eat.
-Eat.

791
00:39:24,450 --> 00:39:25,380
You can't eat it!

792
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:29,040
Gou.

793
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:31,300
This is a trap of the Immortal Clan.

794
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,440
You're wounded.

795
00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:35,050
Who was here?

796
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,420
Zhou Qiao was here.

797
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,680
But a mysterious person showed up

798
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:39,490
and saved us.

799
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:41,380
A mysterious person?

800
00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:42,400
Gou.

801
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,400
Gou.

802
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,210
Gou, we miss you so much.

803
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:45,770
It's you, Gou.

804
00:39:45,770 --> 00:39:48,120
We miss you so much, Gou.

805
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:49,930
Right, Gou,

806
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:51,000
Zhou Qiao has found this place.

807
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:51,930
I'm worried the children will be in danger.

808
00:39:51,930 --> 00:39:52,690
We can't stay here anymore.

809
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:54,150
We need to find a new place.

810
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,330
Don't be afraid.

811
00:39:55,530 --> 00:39:56,790
We're not going anywhere.

812
00:39:56,790 --> 00:39:58,560
He's the one I've been waiting for.

813
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,930
I'll protect the kids.

814
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:01,810
But...

815
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:04,070
Shitou, De.

816
00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:05,600
Bai Cai.

817
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:06,570
I didn't expect to see you again

818
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:07,450
after we parted in the mine.

819
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:08,410
It's good to see you safe.

820
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:10,080
Gou, there are so many people today.

821
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:10,790
Shitou,

822
00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:11,240
why are you thinner

823
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,810
than you were in the mine?

824
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:13,610
Thinner?

825
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:14,930
All the civilians in Bai capital

826
00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:16,370
are eating the Eternal Fruit.

827
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:17,010
The young and the strong

828
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:18,330
have been taken to the mine.

829
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:19,410
Without anyone farming,

830
00:40:19,410 --> 00:40:21,040
of course we lack grain.

831
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:24,490
Now it's even more difficult to have a hearty meal

832
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:26,450
than it was when we were in the mine.

833
00:40:27,330 --> 00:40:28,120
Don't worry.

834
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:29,240
I'm here.

835
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,250
I'll make sure

836
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,400
you'll have delicious food.

837
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,550
Good. Great.

838
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:33,520
Ms. Bai.

839
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:36,150
Mr. An.

840
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:38,060
Yes.

841
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:40,750
We meet again.

842
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:42,950
I'm too familiar

843
00:40:43,770 --> 00:40:45,180
with this place.

844
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:48,400
Back then, thanks to your medicine

845
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,040
and nice cooking skills,

846
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,280
I recovered very quickly.

847
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:54,070
Right,

848
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,430
I remember

849
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,590
you would often faint at that time.

850
00:40:58,590 --> 00:40:59,790
Have you recovered?

851
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,970
Don't worry. I've completely recovered.

852
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:05,360
Gou.

853
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:07,270
It's really lively today.

854
00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:09,250
-Yes, it's lively.
-It's indeed lively.
