[Episode 21]

4
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:39,590
Lan,

5
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:42,430
do you know what Shen Yan is like?

6
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:44,960
How did you learn about him?

7
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:47,870
I just heard about him

8
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:49,229
from Nitian Erxing.

9
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:55,910
Shen Yan is the grand elder of the Sage Hall.

10
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:57,370
He enjoys exalted status,

11
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:59,560
and the right to put the immortals at fault on trial.

12
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,030
His Kongshi-Realm divine power

13
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:02,100
is second to none.

14
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:04,070
Even the high priest

15
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,710
isn't as strong as him.

16
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,580
But he lives in seclusion,

17
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:11,230
and keeps a distance from the mortal world.

18
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:12,710
When I was in the Immortal Realm,

19
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:14,190
I seldom got to see him.

20
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:18,070
Saving your clan?

21
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:20,710
You'd better first figure out

22
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:23,680
whether you're holding a cure,

23
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,680
or a poison.

24
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,520
He keeps a distance from the mortal world,

25
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,430
but he's now having

26
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:37,500
the Demon Clan in the palm of his hand with a flower.

27
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,740
He is a more terrible person

28
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:39,790
than Xinyue Kui.

29
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:42,829
Why would you ask?

30
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:44,510
Have you met him?

31
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:47,070
Shortly

32
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:48,750
after I arrived in the Demon Realm,

33
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:49,950
I met a senior member

34
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:51,110
of the Demon Clan.

35
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:51,910
He was...

36
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:52,550
Gou!

37
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,100
Gou, where are you?

38
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:57,210
I need to see Physician Bai!

39
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,870
Lan, let me go check it out.

40
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:02,030
It's improper for you to show up.

41
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:02,960
Wait for me here.

42
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:10,670
Physician Bai, come out!

43
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:12,340
Physician Bai!

44
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:14,270
Nitian Erxing,

45
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:15,230
today I'm not here

46
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:16,430
for a fight with you.

47
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:18,720
I only need you to hand over a person to me.

48
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:25,970
About this matter,

49
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:27,310
I need to discuss with Gou

50
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:28,310
and Ms. Bai Cai.

51
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:29,070
Cut the crap!

52
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:29,950
Physician Bai was

53
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:31,070
was first found by me!

54
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:31,990
Now I'm simply asking to get her back.

55
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:33,310
I'm being polite enough.

56
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,670
Tell Gou to come out.

57
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:35,720
I'll talk to him.

58
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:40,270
I know what can help with the Petrification Sickness.

59
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:41,070
What a braggart!

60
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:42,070
I won't buy a word of yours!

61
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:43,730
I demand to see Physician Bai!

62
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:52,130
When did it become so serious?

63
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:54,820
Sir,

64
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:57,210
I'm in pain.

65
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:00,700
Will I become a stone?

66
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:01,670
Don't worry.

67
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:03,190
I'm here for you.

68
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:04,910
You won't become a stone.

69
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:06,030
Quit being a poser!

70
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,110
Now help my daughter!

71
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:08,110
Qiongxiong Ji'e,

72
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:09,110
calm down.

73
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:13,510
I know what we can do to help Little Dragonfly.

74
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:14,830
What is it? What can we do?

75
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:16,610
Say it. Say it now!

76
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:18,630
Nitian Erxing,

77
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:20,290
is there a Sky Blazing Cave

78
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,370
in the Demon Realm?

79
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,920
This cave is a forbidden area for the Demon Clan.

80
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:26,680
Why would you ask?

81
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:37,050
[Sky Blazing Cave
Fire Bodhi]

82
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:40,600
Sky Blazing Cave...

83
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,270
Fire Bodhi?

84
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:46,280
I know I've isolated myself from the outside world for a long time,

85
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:49,920
and that there isn't much I can do for the clan.

86
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:53,070
Only the God of War can summon this item,

87
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:56,990
and help the Demon Clan weather through difficulties.

88
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:59,230
In the Sky Blazing Cave, there's an item

89
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:00,430
called "Fire Bodhi."

90
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,130
It's a divine item from the ancient times.

91
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:04,730
It can reduce the pain brought by the Petrification Sickness.

92
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:06,660
You're making it sound like it's true.

93
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:07,750
The Sky Blazing Cave?

94
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,110
I heard about it when I was young.

95
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:09,920
That's a forbidden area.

96
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,980
No one can go there.

97
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:11,990
I've never heard about

98
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:13,070
the Fire Bodhi or whatever.

99
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:14,710
What's that Sky Blazing Cave and stuff?

100
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:15,550
Who knows if you're just

101
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:17,080
making up a story to fool me?

102
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,510
Little Dragonfly must

103
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:20,240
receive proper treatment now!

104
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:22,030
How about this?

105
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,150
Let's first take Little Dragonfly

106
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:24,270
to Bai Cai's place,

107
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:26,200
so Bai Cai can help reduce her pain.

108
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:28,510
Then I'll go get the Fire Bodhi right away.

109
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:29,310
No way!

110
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,830
Get Physician Bai here now.

111
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:31,630
I'll by no means let you

112
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:32,670
take my daughter away.

113
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:34,430
You and Nitian Erxing are probably

114
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:36,030
cooking up some sort of plan!

115
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,150
As the grand marshal,

116
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:38,909
I assure you

117
00:05:38,909 --> 00:05:40,230
that while Little Dragonfly is with us,

118
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:41,830
she won't get hurt in any way.

119
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:42,710
You and your army

120
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:43,920
can stay here.

121
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:46,070
If Gou can't get the Fire Bodhi back,

122
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:47,310
or Little Dragonfly gets hurt

123
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:48,630
at our place,

124
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:49,830
your army

125
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,510
can start launching attacks right away.

126
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:54,270
I'll be ready for a battle anytime.

127
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:57,840
We must take action now!

128
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:00,790
Sir...

129
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:02,850
Daddy...

130
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:04,830
My little girl.

131
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,590
Help me...

132
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:07,760
Daddy is right here.

133
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:09,490
Little Dragonfly!

134
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:14,070
Daddy won't let anything happen to you.

135
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:19,870
Young man,

136
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:21,810
there's nothing I won't do

137
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:23,630
for Little Dragonfly.

138
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:25,260
Don't you try to pull stunts!

139
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,660
I'll give you three days.

140
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:28,640
If you can't get the Fire Bodhi back

141
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:30,910
to save my daughter's life,

142
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:32,550
I...

143
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:36,030
I'll start a bloodbath here,

144
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:38,140
and take every life in Nitian Tribe!

145
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,110
Everyone will have to

146
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:41,760
die with Little Dragonfly!

147
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,810
I don't need three days.

148
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:44,990
One is enough.

149
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:46,710
But I need a promise from you.

150
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:48,440
After I get the Fire Bodhi back,

151
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:50,110
you'll share it with the whole clan,

152
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,710
instead of keeping it to yourself only.

153
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:53,190
How dare you!

154
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:55,270
Fine! You have my promise!

155
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:59,030
Today, all of you will be witnesses to this vow.

156
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,870
If Gou can really retrieve the Fire Bodhi,

157
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,230
our tribe and Qiongxiong Ji'e's tribe

158
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:08,710
will share it with all the members of the Demon Clan.

159
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,710
Okay. I agree with it.

160
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:17,240
Don't forget what you said.

161
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:21,410
Grand Marshal,

162
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:23,110
please take Little Dragonfly

163
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,270
to Bai Cai's place,

164
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:25,240
where her pain will be eased.

165
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,190
I'll go get the Fire Bodhi now.

166
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:27,910
Gou,

167
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:30,150
are you sure you're up for it?

168
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:32,270
What'd you say?

169
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,260
Soldiers, I have an order!

170
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:39,710
Pitch camps right here!

171
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:40,510
Yes!

172
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:42,370
Those who break into Nitian Tribe

173
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:43,230
will be killed!

174
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:44,290
Yes!

175
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:07,230
Grand Marshal,

176
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:08,070
are you going to the Sky Blazing Cave

177
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:08,920
to help Gou?

178
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:09,800
Yes.

179
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,950
The Sky Blazing Cave is a dangerous place.

180
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,430
Little Dragonfly's life is being threatened.

181
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:15,150
Only when I help Gou get the Fire Bodhi

182
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:16,950
can the whole problem be solved.

183
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:18,310
I'll go with you then.

184
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,510
I can be of help to you.

185
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:20,670
You should first send someone

186
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:22,120
to bring Muwu Biaoqing here.

187
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,070
Before our return,

188
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,110
we must ensure

189
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:25,310
Ms. Bai Cai's safety.

190
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:26,910
You must fulfill your duty

191
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:28,310
as a general of the tribe.

192
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:29,140
Yes.

193
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:35,510
Gou!

194
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:37,760
What are you doing here?

195
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:39,990
The Sky Blazing Cave is a forbidden area for the Demon Clan.

196
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:41,390
It might be more dangerous than expected.

197
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:42,590
How can I not concern about it,

198
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:44,049
and let you go there alone?

199
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:57,270
It's my ride, Garuda.

200
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,430
This bird and I will keep you company

201
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:01,870
on this journey.

202
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:04,180
Thanks.

203
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:17,190
Gou,

204
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:18,750
how did you get to

205
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:20,390
know about the Fire Bodhi?

206
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:21,790
An old senior member

207
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:23,650
of the Demon Clan told me about it.

208
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,020
He's named Yongheng Zhiye.

209
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,790
I used to be apprenticed to him.

210
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,670
However, he apparently knows

211
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:33,270
how to treat the Petrification Sickness.

212
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:35,070
Why wouldn't he tell me about it?

213
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,580
How am I supposed to know why?

214
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,430
Next time when you see him,

215
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:40,030
you should ask him yourself.

216
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,110
This is a forbidden area for the Demon Clan.

217
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:46,640
Even I have never been here.

218
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,280
I didn't expect it to look like this.

219
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:51,430
Judging from the terrain here,

220
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:52,190
I guess in the Demon Clan,

221
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:53,650
all the underground magma

222
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,080
would finally gather here.

223
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:59,430
Don't you want to see

224
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:01,110
what's behind the waterfall?

225
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:02,770
That's what I'm thinking too.

226
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:35,830
I can't believe this bird is

227
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:37,530
multiple times larger than Garuda.

228
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:38,860
It's so huge.

229
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:39,870
It must be the skeleton

230
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:41,930
of some kind of ancient divine beast.

231
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:43,030
I think

232
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:44,800
I've seen one such bird.

233
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:48,950
In the battle between Xin King and Hei Long,

234
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:50,620
such an animal fought shoulder to shoulder

235
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:51,990
with the human race.

236
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:54,960
Xin King...

237
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,430
He was indeed

238
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:57,830
a hero in this era.

239
00:10:58,540 --> 00:10:59,950
So, do you mean

240
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:02,230
this is probably the skeleton of an ancient divine beast

241
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:03,490
named "Undying Bird"?

242
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:40,950
I can sense there is a call.

243
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:43,990
I feel like it's a call

244
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:45,030
from the old times.

245
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:45,860
Undying Bird,

246
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:47,790
is it really you?

247
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:49,310
You're still alive?

248
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:51,470
What death means to me

249
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,990
is the start

250
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:54,950
of a new life.

251
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,000
I thought

252
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,850
you died with my father.

253
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,070
Your father?

254
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:04,070
Are you Xin King's son?

255
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:09,420
That explains everything.

256
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:11,920
Who are you?

257
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:14,670
I'm the grand marshal of the Demon Clan, Nitian Erxing.

258
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:16,510
Has the human race formed an alliance

259
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:18,400
with the Demon Clan now?

260
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:20,430
The atrocities committed by the Immortal Realm

261
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:22,510
must have enraged both humans and demons.

262
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:25,930
The King of Immortal's days are numbered.

263
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:27,790
We came to the Sky Blazing Cave

264
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:29,830
to look for

265
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,550
a cure for the Demon Clan,

266
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:33,050
namely the Fire Bodhi.

267
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:34,790
Have you seen it?

268
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:36,510
What did you just say?

269
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:38,880
The Fire Bodhi?

270
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:41,750
I was wondering why you two would come.

271
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:45,440
How dare you try to get hold of such a divine ancient treasure!

272
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,340
It's very bold of you!

273
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:49,780
Entering the forbidden area

274
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:52,550
is a capital offense already!

275
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:14,790
Nitian Erxing,

276
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:16,070
let's go!

277
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:17,590
We are no match for this bird.

278
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:19,050
But we can't both die here.

279
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:21,980
Undying Bird, hear me out!

280
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:27,310
Go! Or it'll be too late!

281
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:47,790
How are you?

282
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:48,670
I'm fine.

283
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,600
Watch out!

284
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:18,530
I guess we'll have to resort to violence.

285
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,270
The opponent's weakness

286
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:33,030
usually lies in

287
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:34,560
the most unexpected place.

288
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:39,680
Gou, cover me.

289
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:41,170
I'll leave the rest to you.

290
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,230
Quitting with empty hands

291
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:44,500
isn't my style.

292
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:20,310
Wu Geng, you're impressive.

293
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:23,750
I didn't expect you to have the Colorless-Realm divine power.

294
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,070
Nitian Erxing,

295
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:26,270
it's very lucky

296
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:27,790
for the Demon Clan to have you

297
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:29,320
as their grand marshal.

298
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:30,150
Undying Bird,

299
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:32,030
were you just...

300
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:33,130
What I did to you

301
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:35,160
was just a test.

302
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:37,360
He who can lead the anti-immortal army

303
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,120
against the King of Immortals

304
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,270
must be extraordinarily brave.

305
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:42,910
I already saw that kind of bravery

306
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:44,310
in both of you.

307
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:46,230
What's more admirable

308
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,750
is that you trust each other with your lives,

309
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,190
and that you wouldn't leave your partners in the lurch.

310
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:51,030
This,

311
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:52,950
in the future battles where you'll fight as a team,

312
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:54,950
will be your most valuable quality.

313
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,470
You'll be just like

314
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:59,080
Xin King and me in the past.

315
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,360
The Fire Bodhi!

316
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:04,890
The arrival of the son of an old friend of mine

317
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:06,910
has awakened my divine awareness,

318
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:10,080
and revived my spirit from flames.

319
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:11,990
This Fire Bodhi

320
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:14,910
was generated during my rebirth.

321
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:17,990
Now I'd like to give it to you as a gift, Wu Geng.

322
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:32,900
A new anti-immortal force is being formed.

323
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:34,660
Shi Xing,

324
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:38,430
how much longer till you rise again?

325
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:06,670
Gou!

326
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:12,380
How did it go? Have you got the item?

327
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,349
Yes.

328
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:14,890
Grand Marshal.

329
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:17,190
How is Little Dragonfly doing?

330
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,470
Much of her pain

331
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:19,430
has been reduced.

332
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:20,470
She's asleep now.

333
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:23,190
By the way, Gou,

334
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:24,430
I've heard that the Sky Blazing Cave

335
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:25,829
is a forbidden area for the Demon Clan.

336
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:27,310
No one has ever set foot on it.

337
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:29,910
You met quite a lot of danger there, didn't you?

338
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:32,270
D-Did you get injured?

339
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:34,200
I had a great helper.

340
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:35,310
I didn't get hurt.

[Muwu Biaoqing]

342
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:49,990
The Fire Bodhi!

343
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,790
Have you got the Fire Bodhi?

344
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,810
Have you brought the Fire Bodhi back?

345
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:56,870
Great!

346
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,470
Great!

347
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:00,070
Little Dragonfly's life will be saved!

348
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:00,990
Mr. Gou,

349
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:01,920
please help Little Dragonfly now!

350
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,270
No. I should call you hero!

351
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:05,200
Please help Little Dragonfly now!

352
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:07,210
Grand Marshal,

353
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:08,470
please send someone

354
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:09,930
to treat Little Dragonfly right now.

355
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:10,950
That's right!

This is the best doctor

in the Demon Clan.

359
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:16,830
Without further ado,

360
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:18,830
please go to help Little Dragonfly.

361
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:54,150
What's wrong?

362
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:55,590
Why did you stop?

363
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:57,920
I couldn't proceed with it.

364
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:01,280
I can't activate the energy within.

365
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:04,500
Only the God of War can summon this item.

366
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:05,430
Remember,

367
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:06,190

who has gained the Fire Bodhi's recognition

370
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:08,870
can use it.

371
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:13,760
Let me give it a shot.

372
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,240
You made it, Gou!

It's gone!

It's gone!

00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:15,830
It has disappeared!

378
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:17,000
I've got rid of it!

379
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:22,680
I'm well again!

380
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:30,360
Sir!

381
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:32,680
I really didn't turn into a stone!

382
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:35,560
I'm glad that you're fine.

383
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,550
I'm so glad.

384
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:38,870
Thank you, Sir.

385
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:46,350
Mind your steps, Little Dragonfly.

386
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:47,770
Daddy!

387
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,510
Little Dragonfly!

388
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:55,560
Let me look at you.

389
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:57,630
Daddy, look! It's all gone!

390
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:00,290
Show me your other arm!

391
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,340
Are you happy?

392
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:04,250
Your legs!

393
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:06,650
Daddy,

394
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:08,820
Mr. Gou saved my life.

395
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:10,870
Mr. Gou is amazing.

396
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:12,330
When I was asleep,

397
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:14,300
he kept talking to me.

398
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:17,350
Ms. Bai Cai, thank you too.

399
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,870
You've been taking care of me.

400
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:21,390
You and Mr. Gou are good people.

401
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:23,330
You're my lifesavers.

402
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:32,170
Mr. Gou, you're a hero.

403
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:34,450
My gratitude for you is beyond words.

404
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:36,550
You did save Little Dragonfly's life

405
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:38,340
in less than one day.

406
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:40,310
I see you as my lifesaver too.

407
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:41,500
If you ever need a favor in the future,

408
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,820
as long as it doesn't jeopardize the Demon Clan,

409
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:43,790
just let me know!

410
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:46,990
I promise I'll lend you a helping hand!

411
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:49,230
The Demon Clan's future

412
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:50,790
lies in these children.

413
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:53,270
I just did the least I could do.

414
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:56,110
I'm a man of my word.

415
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:57,990
Since I've promised to share

416
00:21:57,990 --> 00:21:59,540
the Fire Bodhi with the whole Demon Clan,

417
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:00,950
I won't try to take it away.

418
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:02,510
If someone wants to grab it,

419
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:05,160
I won't let that happen either!

420
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:06,800
That's for sure.

421
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:14,780
Sweetheart, let's go home.

422
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:18,670
Goodbye, sir.

423
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:20,410
Goodbye, Ms. Bai Cai.

424
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:22,310
Bye, Little Dragonfly.

425
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:28,870
Little Dragonfly, come on. Take this.

426
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:35,350
It smells so good!

427
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:37,030
You're hungry, aren't you?

428
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:38,590
You'll feel full after eating it,

429
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:40,690
and it won't cause pain in your tummy.

430
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:44,390
Ms. Bai Cai, you're so nice.

431
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:47,550
Daddy, I want you to eat it.

432
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,810
Daddy is not hungry.

433
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:51,230
You eat it.

434
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:53,590
Let's go.

435
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:01,390
Sweetheart,

436
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:02,860
let's go home!

437
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:05,510
Daddy, eat it. It smells great!

438
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:07,680
Daddy's not hungry. You eat it.

439
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:08,950
No, I'm good.

440
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:10,810
It smells wonderful. Have a bite!

441
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:27,190
Tiexue Wushuang!

442
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:28,910
Put the Fire Bodhi away.

443
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,790
Keep it safe and under watch.

444
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:32,350
Yes, Grand Marshal.

445
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:00,830
What's up?

446
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:02,150
Is there a problem?

447
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:06,810
Muwu Biaoqing and I

448
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:08,480
have come up with a plan.

449
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:09,390
Tomorrow,

450
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:10,520
we'll give it a try.

451
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:12,910
Do you need my help?

452
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:18,820
Gou,

453
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:20,880
you did so much hard work

454
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:22,750
to get the Fire Bodhi.

455
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:25,970
I'd like to thank you on behalf of the Demon Clan.

456
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:33,190
Grand Marshal, without your help,

457
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:34,470
it wouldn't have been possible

458
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:36,870
for us to defeat the Undying Bird so easily.

459
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:38,270
The Undying Bird?

460
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:39,750
Are you referring to the Undying Bird

461
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:41,710
that people have been talking about after the war in the Xin State?

462
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:42,510
Yes.

463
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:44,070
Didn't it get killed

464
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:45,670
with Xin King by Hei Long?

465
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:47,950
The Undying Bird is an ancient divine beast.

466
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:49,110
It has the Primitive-Realm divine power,

467
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:51,630
which is the second strongest power in the Immortal Clan.

468
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:53,910
Legend has it that such a bird wouldn't die or vanish.

469
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:55,070
Ten thousand years ago,

470
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:56,550
it was involved in the battle against Hei Long,

471
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:57,990
and was killed by the latter.

472
00:24:57,990 --> 00:24:59,070
But its spirit

473
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:01,170
attached itself to Xin King's armor.

474
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:03,630
I thought the war in the Xin State

475
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:04,950
would completely tear apart

476
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:06,390
the Undying Bird's spirit,

477
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:08,050
and crushed the life out of it.

478
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:09,260
But unexpectedly,

479
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:11,340
it was reborn in the Demon Realm.

480
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:15,360
In the past, the Undying Bird gave Xin King its recognition.

481
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:17,350
If you can be recognized by it too,

482
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:18,990
you'll gain a lot of help.

483
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:22,050
Even without the bird's assistance,

484
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:23,870
I'm still gonna win

485
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:25,420
the war against immortals.

486
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:41,230
Now the only solution I can think of,

487
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:42,310
is to throw the Fire Bodhi

488
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:44,220
towards the crater of Mount Zheluo.

489
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:45,830
Then, we'll transfer energy

490
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:46,830
to that mountain,

491
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:48,030
in the hope of

492
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:49,910
spreading all the divine power in the Fire Bodhi

493
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:52,370
to the whole clan through the mineral veins.

494
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:53,680
This way,

495
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:55,390
all those with the Petrification Sickness

496
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:56,510
will be cured,

497
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:57,960
fair and square.

498
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:00,390
This is the only solution

499
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:01,390
I can think of now.

500
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,210
However, ordinary members of the Demon Clan

501
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:04,610
can't use the Fire Bodhi.

502
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:06,150
Except Wu Geng,

503
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:08,670
who else can make the miracle happen?

504
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:11,260
Who could gain the Fire Bodhi's approval?

505
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:14,670
Wu Geng and I

506
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:16,470
got the Fire Bodhi together.

507
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:18,540
I'm sure I can have its approval too.

508
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:53,870
But in that case,

509
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:56,070
you'll lose all your demonic power.

510
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,810
Given your current health status,

511
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:00,870
by the time all the divine power

512
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:02,580
in the Fire Bodhi is released,

513
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:05,750
your life will be ended.

514
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:15,650
Muwu Biaoqing,

515
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,760
if my life is endangered,

516
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,550
you'll be the leader of the Demon Clan,

517
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:21,150
and form an alliance with Gou

518
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:23,040
to fight the immortals together.

519
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,070
Now everyone in the Demon Realm

520
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:35,070
is hovering between life and death.

521
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:35,910
I'm determined

522
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:37,880
to help the Demon Realm out of this crisis

523
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,670
at any cost, even if it means to

524
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:41,400
sacrifice my own life.

525
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:00,280
Grand Marshal,

526
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:01,790
breaking promises

527
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:03,850
isn't what a real gentleman would do.

528
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,820
How am I breaking my promises?

529
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:07,200
Don't you remember?

530
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,230
Our agreement to stay honest to each other

531
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:09,950
for seven days isn't terminated yet.

532
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:10,950
In these seven days,

533
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:12,010
we must treat each other

534
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:13,340
with absolute honesty.

535
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:15,280
If you continue with this,

536
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,920
how can our agreement be executed?

537
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:19,070
You retrieved the Fire Bodhi for the Demon Clan.

538
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:20,590
It's already a huge contribution.

539
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:21,390
Now,

540
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:22,390
are you gonna deprive me of the chance

541
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:23,870
to fulfill my duty as the clan leader?

542
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:26,070
In my eyes, the members of the Demon Clan

543
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:27,550
are no different

544
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:29,430
than the people in the Xin State.

545
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:32,000
Now that I'm intending to be your ally,

546
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:34,390
I've also made up my mind

547
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:37,300
to work for the wellbeing of the Demon Clan.

548
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:52,750
[Tomb of My Late Brother Haikuo Tiankong]

549
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:12,870
Daddy, look!

550
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:14,800
The sky's all lightened up!

551
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:23,830
My body...

552
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:24,750
Look at me!

553
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:26,190
I'm cured!

554
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:27,170
I'm cured too!

555
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:29,750
We're all cured!

556
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:30,990
We're well again!

557
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:32,250
You've recovered too!

558
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:34,800
Great! The illness is gone!

559
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:37,350
Have you been cured?

560
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:39,080
The disease's gone! I'm cured!

561
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,550
Have you all recovered?

562
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:41,470
The illness's gone! Great!

563
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:43,430
Marvelous!

564
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:48,240
He did it.

565
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,870
He did it!

566
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,590
Man...

567
00:29:58,750 --> 00:29:59,550
Don't worry.

568
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:00,950
Gou won't let anything happen

569
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:02,150
to the grand marshal.

570
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:19,070
Gou, thank you.

571
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:22,010
No need to thank me.

572
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,230
If you are to say thank you,

573
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:26,150
say it to your aide,

574
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:27,550
namely General Suifeng.

575
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:30,230
Just as I speculated.

576
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:34,000
With the help of the Fire Bodhi,

577
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,310
I hope everyone in the Demon Clan

578
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:37,240
can be relieved from the suffering

579
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,820
brought by the Petrification Sickness.

580
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:44,630
Who is it?

581
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,670
General Suifeng?

582
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,240
Gou, I'd like to ask you for a favor.

583
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,440
I hope you can help me.

584
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:59,270
General Suifeng, no need for this.

585
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:00,590
Please get up.

586
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:08,350
Just tell me what I can help with.

587
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:13,270
Is it a matter about Nitian Erxing?

588
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:15,880
Man is the grand marshal of the Demon Clan.

589
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:17,830
Protecting the Demon Clan is his obligation,

590
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:19,430
and also his life's mission.

591
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:21,200
For the sake of the Demon Clan,

592
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:21,950
he has done

593
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:23,190
everything he can.

594
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:25,390
The Demon Clan can't afford to lose him!

595
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:28,270
Though it's just been a few days

596
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:29,790
since I met Nitian Erxing,

597
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,550
I can say for sure

598
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:32,640
that he is

599
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,150
a trustworthy leader.

600
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:38,020
Yes.

601
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:42,030
He is the perfect grand marshal

602
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:43,350
in everyone's heart.

603
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,480
Over these years,

604
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:48,270
I've always wanted to share

605
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:49,870
the burden on his shoulders.

606
00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:52,540
I'm happy to do anything for him,

607
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:53,740
except for one thing.

608
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:00,630
Man has suffered from the Petrification Sickness

609
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:01,750
for years too.

610
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:04,070
To set the Demon Clan members' minds at rest,

611
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:05,550
he has kept that secret all the time.

612
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:07,750
I'm the only one who knows it in the clan.

613
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:09,830
If possible,

614
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:11,350
I truly wish

615
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:12,230
I can bear all the pain

616
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:13,590
for him.

617
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:15,070
General Suifeng,

618
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:17,030
just level with me.

619
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:19,270
As long as I can be of help,

620
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:21,710
I won't refuse any of your requests.

621
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:24,310
Gou,

622
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:27,400
since you came to the Demon Realm,

623
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:28,990
I started to see an unprecedented kind

624
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:30,670
of sparkle in Man's eyes,

625
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:32,350
Your appearance

626
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:34,430
has brought hope to the Demon Clan,

627
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:36,030
and confidence to Man.

628
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:38,000
I feel the same way about him.

629
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,510
On my anti-immortal journey,

630
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:40,840
having a friend like him

631
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,400
is a blessing for me.

632
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:50,740
The grand marshal and Muwu Biaoqing

633
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:51,950
have had a discussion.

634
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:53,270
If the Fire Bodhi is to be used

635
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:54,030
to cure the Petrification Sickness

636
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:55,430
plaguing the Demon Realm,

637
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:57,060
then it must be placed with the mineral veins

638
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:58,150
of Mount Zheluo in order to transfer

639
00:32:58,150 --> 00:32:59,430
its divine power to every spot in the clan

640
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:01,030
to relieve people of pain.

641
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:02,870
But this process

642
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:04,510
will consume all the demonic power

643
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:05,720
that the grand marshal has,

644
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,870
and worsen his illness

645
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:08,200
till it eats up his life.

646
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:11,020
General Suifeng,

647
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:12,740
I understand.

648
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:15,780
I'm setting off to Mount Zheluo now.

649
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:17,230
General Suifeng

650
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:18,870
has given you her heart.

651
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:21,530
She deserves better than disregard.

652
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:24,640
I know her feelings

653
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:25,990
for me.

654
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,640
But I'm in no position

655
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:32,330
to respond to her affection.

656
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:40,190
It's smaller!

657
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:43,540
My petrified parts are smaller!

658
00:33:45,050 --> 00:33:46,450
Mine too!

659
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,830
We've gotta

660
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:52,230
live our lives to the fullest!

661
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:53,030
That's right!

662
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:54,610
Guys,

663
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:57,670
I'm gonna marry ten women,

664
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:01,510
and dress them up with jewelry.

665
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:03,270
I'll provide them with tons of new clothes!

666
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:04,270
Just the thought of it already makes me happy!

667
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:05,140
You?

668
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:06,540
Will girls be attracted to you?

669
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:08,030
My legs are all fine now!

670
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:09,670
Everyone's legs are!

671
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:12,469
Look who's coming!

672
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:13,389
Everyone's cured!

673
00:34:13,389 --> 00:34:15,989
-Your Majesty!
-Your Majesty!
-Your Majesty!

674
00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:16,989
I'm cured!

675
00:34:16,989 --> 00:34:17,540
You're cured?

676
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:18,070
It's all fixed!

677
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:19,070
Your Majesty, I'm well too!

678
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:19,630
So are you?

679
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:20,670
-Yeah!
-Me too!

680
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:21,500
My legs are healed!

681
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,400
Great!

682
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:23,550
Daddy,

683
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:24,630
no one will

684
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:25,750
ever turn into

685
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:27,070
rocks again, right?

686
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:27,989
Yes!

687
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:29,989
None of our people

688
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:31,989
will turn into rocks anymore!

689
00:34:31,989 --> 00:34:32,900
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

690
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:36,550
In the future,

691
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:39,409
Daddy will take you up to the world on the ground.

692
00:34:39,469 --> 00:34:40,270
No.

693
00:34:40,889 --> 00:34:43,340
We'll be heading to the Immortal Realm,

694
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:46,510
and take back all the valuables

695
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:47,940
and delicious food

696
00:34:47,989 --> 00:34:49,190
that the Immortal Clan owes us!

697
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:51,989
-Yeah!
-Take the things back!
-Take them all back!

698
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:53,760
Dr. Muwu,

699
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:54,670
does it mean

700
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:55,750
the Demon Realm

701
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:56,989
won't be troubled

702
00:34:56,989 --> 00:34:59,120
by the Petrification Sickness again?

703
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:02,790
The root cause of this disease is unclear yet.

704
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:03,830
But the Fire Bodhi

705
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:05,430
is indeed a temporary fix.

706
00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:09,370
If we are to get rid of this illness for good,

707
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:12,740
we still need to leave the Demon Realm,

708
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,580
and move back to the world on the ground.

709
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:16,550
Only in that way can we be free of worries.

710
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:17,350
Then let's move back

711
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:18,400
onto the ground.

712
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:21,750
Gou will definitely lead us

713
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:22,870
to fight and build

714
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:25,020
a new order that embodies freedom and equality.

715
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:26,500
He will make it happen.

716
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:31,390
Gou,

717
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:33,190
stop it.

718
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,490
You're collapsing.

719
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:36,310
No.

720
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:38,750
There are so many lives I haven't saved yet.

721
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,400
Gou,

722
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:53,830
stop it.

723
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:56,590
I can't give up.

724
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:43,300
Gou!

725
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:45,590
Gou?

726
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:19,150
Gou, you finally woke up.

727
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:24,390
Gou,

728
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,190
when the grand marshal

729
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:27,310
brought you back,

730
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:28,710
I was scared.

731
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:32,190
Don't worry.

732
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:33,350
I just

733
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:34,830
lost some divine power.

734
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:36,390
I'll recover

735
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:37,510
after a short rest.

736
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:41,020
You were in a coma for a whole day.

737
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:42,480
You must be unwell, right?

738
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:45,870
Anyway,

739
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,430
wherever you go since now,

740
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:48,550
I'll go with you.

741
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:50,290
Don't you ever leave my sight.

742
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:52,520
What if

743
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:54,690
I need to take a shower or use the toilet?

744
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:56,220
Are you gonna be with me too?

745
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,550
You clearly know

746
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:02,480
that's not what I'm talking about.

747
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:06,310
Alright. No more teasing.

748
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:09,400
Where is the grand marshal?

749
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:10,390
How is he?

750
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:12,600
How is everyone in the Demon Clan?

751
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:14,750
They're lucky to have your help.

752
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:18,210
Now, they're celebrating as if there's a festival.

753
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:21,110
Terrific.

754
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:24,830
The curse on the Demon Clan has been lifted.

755
00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:27,350
The people here have been spared from pain.

756
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:28,590
This is

757
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:29,910
such a relief for me.

758
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,710
I know you've been hoping

759
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:35,630
to make a contribution to the Demon Clan.

760
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:36,390
Now seeing

761
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:37,390
how happy they are,

762
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:38,590
I'm delighted too.

763
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:42,510
But when the idea of

764
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:44,470
your life being endangered by it strikes me,

765
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:46,540
I'd rather be a selfish person,

766
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:48,370
and only pray for your safety.

767
00:38:53,570 --> 00:38:55,910
Gou, I'm warning you,

768
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:57,510
from now on,

769
00:38:57,590 --> 00:38:59,030
you must not leave me.

770
00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:01,780
Why would I ever do that?

771
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,920
Get those wild thoughts out of your head.

772
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,360
Gou will never leave you.

773
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:12,420
You really must not leave me.

774
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:14,950
Of course I won't.

775
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:18,110
Keep this in mind!

776
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:41,550
Again!

777
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,500
This time,

778
00:39:57,890 --> 00:39:59,630
we saved Little Dragonfly,

779
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:01,670
but Qiongxiong Ji'e still won't

780
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:02,390
give up on the competition

781
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:03,850
over the reign of the clan.

782
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:05,990
A battle

783
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:07,430
will break out

784
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:08,910
sooner or later.

785
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:11,140
Among the 13 Generals of the Demon Clan,

786
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:12,150
12 are now

787
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:13,360
at your disposal.

788
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:15,310
To subdue an enemy,

789
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:16,950
in the commoners' words,

790
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:18,790
force is what you need to resort to.

791
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:20,790
Keep bashing till your opponent caves in.

792
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:22,710
Though it's simple and rough,

793
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:24,030
it does work.

794
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:26,640
Why wouldn't you

795
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:28,760
adopt this method on Qiongxiong Ji'e?
