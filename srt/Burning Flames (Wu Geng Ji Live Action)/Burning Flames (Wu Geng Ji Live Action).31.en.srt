Kong Que, what is this?

00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,470
After the reconstruction of Shenyin Village,

6
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:53,150
we set a new barrier

This is the way to enter Shenyin Village.

10
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:03,070
Actually,

11
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:05,230
you don't have to tell me.

12
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:06,870
Just tell Gou.

13
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:09,949
Why?

14
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:12,150
Nothing.

15
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,290
I'll keep that in mind.

16
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:42,990
If my divine power

17
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:44,790
can't be recovered,

How is your recovery?

Tell him I want to see Chen Jing.

Of course not.

My divine power hasn't been recovered yet.

41
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:44,030

I didn't call you when we attacked the Immortal Clan

63

64
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:45,590
It was my fault.

00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:46,909
I was just worried.

66
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,630
You're just a kid.

67
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:53,840
I was worried

68
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:55,800
because you're so capable.

69
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:56,630
If you had single-handedly

70
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,830
beaten the Immortal Clan off,

71
00:04:58,830 --> 00:04:59,550

73
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,590
Okay. This is one thing.

Zhazha.

79
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:14,470
I really don't know

80

why you're angry.

81
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:18,470
Tell me.

82
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:21,800
I'm begging you.

83
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:22,790
Okay?

84
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:27,850
What are you doing?

85
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:29,990
I'm warning you.

86
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:30,790
If you do this again,

87
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:32,720
believe it or not, I'll hang you up.

88
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:41,159
That's right.

89
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:43,630
What do you mean?

90
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:47,750
Master, why did you

91
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:49,430
use "please"

92
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:50,790
and beg me?

93
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:52,990
You're my master.

94
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:54,340
You should just give me orders

95
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:55,670
and push me.

96
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,550
I'm warning you.

97
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:59,310
From now on, if you want me to do anything,

98
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:00,670
just give me an order.

99
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:03,690
If you use words like "please" again,

100
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,830
I won't be your disciple anymore.

101
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,110
You're really...

102
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:13,790
Fine.

103
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:16,080
Zhazha, listen carefully.

104
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:19,670
Send a letter to your father immediately.

105
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,010
Tell him I want to see him.

106
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:22,050
Yes, Master.

107
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:26,630
This is my good master.

108
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:27,730
Good master.

109
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,880
Be careful.

110
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,550
Don't be afraid.

111
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:43,490
It's okay.

112
00:06:43,909 --> 00:06:45,440
Master, I'm leaving.

115
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:54,470
Impressive.

116
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:57,530
You know how to butter kids up now.

117
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:00,190
How is it?

118
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,990
Is the capital stable these days?

119
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:04,190
Get to the point.

120
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:06,470
I'm busy.

121
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:09,210
I don't have time to make small talk with you.

122
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,070
I'm going to take the old troops of Xin State

123
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,590
to a safe place

124
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,000
and hide them there.

125
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:21,520
Northern Mountain Mine?

126
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:23,630
Talking to smart people

127
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:25,450
indeed saves time and energy.

128
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:27,700
Yes.

129
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:28,830
This way,

130
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:30,430
when they stay at that place,

131
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:32,640
they can also build bloodstone ships.

132
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:37,190
What?

133
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:38,760
Any objections?

134
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:42,590
You already said

135
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:44,990
they're the old troops of Xin State.

136
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:46,659
What does this have to do with me?

137
00:07:46,659 --> 00:07:48,390
Why did you explain it to me?

138
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:50,310
I forgot

139
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,070
I joined forces with you.

140
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:53,700
Zhou Qiao.

141
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:55,490
You

142
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:58,120
must have been targeted by the Immortal Clan.

143
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:59,630
If I leave,

144
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:00,830
you'll stay

145
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:01,990
in Bai capital alone...

146
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:02,830
Wu Geng.

147
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:07,380
Are you trying to transfer me

148
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:10,390
so that you can take my throne?

149
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:13,190
Zhou Qiao.

150
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:16,390
You still think the worst of people.

151
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:24,230
I'm just kidding.

152
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:26,390
I said that before.

153
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:28,220
Whoever sits on the throne now

154
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,830
will die.

155
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:31,850
I'm not worried

156
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:34,200
that my throne may be taken.

157
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:36,710
Don't tell me

158
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:40,000
you're worried about the people of Bai State.

159
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,430
My father has passed away.

160
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,630
I'm the only king.

161
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,470
When the Immortal Clan attacks here,

162
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:52,230
I can fight back

163
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:53,910
like Xin King did.

164
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,110
By then,

165
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:58,470
my reputation will be better.

166
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:01,990
You?

167
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:05,990
How can you learn from my father?

168
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:08,930
I'm afraid at the crucial moment,

169
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,950
the first person who disappears

170
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:13,830
will be you, Prince Zhou Qiao.

171
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:21,380
The people who gave birth to me are my parents.

172
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:22,670
The person who knows me

173
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:24,590
is Wu Geng.

174
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:28,680
Now the king of the mortal realm

175
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:30,430
and the hero of the mortal realm

176
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:32,630
are only you, Wu Geng, and me, Zhou Qiao.

177
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:35,470
You, Wu Geng, want to rebel against the immortals.

178
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:36,630
But I, Zhou Qiao,

179
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:39,750
just want to be the king of the mortal realm

180
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,470
and have a place in history.

181
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,030
We stay out of each other's way.

182
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:44,950
I don't care

183
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:47,550
who will win between you and the Immortal Clan.

184
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:49,390
I'll support

185
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:51,070
whoever supports me

186
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:53,660
to be the king of the mortal realm.

187
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:55,470
So,

188
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,990
I have neither the need

189
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:00,470
nor the desire to leave.

190
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,340
Now that you've made up your mind,

191
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,530
I won't persuade you anymore.

192
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:09,030
General An.

193
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:09,670
Yes.

194
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:11,350
Continue to train the troops in the capital.

195
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:12,670
When Chen Jing agrees,

196
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:15,070
take the troops to Northern Mountain Mine.

197
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:16,510
Yes.

198
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:18,030
What?

199
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:20,310
You're leaving.

200
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,410
But you're leaving someone to protect me?

201
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:26,550
You're overthinking it.

202
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:29,320
I'm doing this to keep an eye on you.

203
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:34,070
What a pity.

204
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:36,690
If you're willing to serve me,

205
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:40,270
I'll definitely give you

206
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,270
a land and a title.

207
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,670
And it'll be hereditary.

208
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:49,320
I'm more generous than you.

209
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:51,870
Whether I win or lose,

210
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:54,490
I approve of you being the king

211
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,210
of the mortal world.

212
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:11,390
Gou, take the medicine.

213
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:13,230
Okay.

214
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,110
Bai Cai.

215
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,550
I'm going to Northern Mountain Mine.

216
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:19,990
Do you want to go with me?

217
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:22,110
I'm not going.

218
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:25,230
Didn't you tell me before

219
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:27,990
that the life in Northern Mountain Mine was hard,

220
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:30,190
but it was simple, peaceful,

221
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,390
and unforgettable?

222
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:32,750
I think

223
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,150
you still want to go back with me,

224
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:35,230
right?

225
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:38,990
Northern Mountain Mine is so scary.

226
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,250
I don't want to go back.

227
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:42,480
I need to take care of the kids here.

228
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:43,670
Besides,

229
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:45,470
Bai State is finally safe and peaceful.

230
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:46,830
I've always wanted to open a steamed bun shop.

231
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:48,030
Will you support me?

232
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:51,270
Of course.

233
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:53,050
Take the medicine.

234
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,280
Something is wrong.

235
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:00,070
Something is very wrong.

236
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:01,990
Are you

237
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:03,450
hiding something from me?

238
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:07,870
No.

239
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:09,510
I've been thinking

240
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:10,860
that my poison

241
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,030
couldn't be detoxified so quickly.

242
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,480
Did you use the Crystal Power

243
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,010
to remove the poison for me?

244
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:21,350
Yes.

245
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,430
Otherwise,

246
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:23,870
you wouldn't have recovered so quickly.

247
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:25,130
I just didn't tell you.

248
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:27,270
What? You can't use your divine power.

249
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:28,470
Are you blaming me for making you wrong?

250
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:30,710
No. I'm worried about you.

251
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,470
That's the poison of White Lotus Great Sage.

252
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:34,630
Are you okay?

253
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:35,670
I'm fine.

254
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:36,750
Kong Que said

255
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:37,840
not only did I consume nothing,

256
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,370
but I also became stronger.

257
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:40,430
Really?

258
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:41,150
Yes.

259
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:42,470
What?

260
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,140
You can activate divine power.

261
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,900
But I can't be talented?

262
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:48,550
Yes, you can.

263
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:50,230
You're talented.

264
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:52,670
Gou.

265
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:54,470
Practice hard on the way.

266
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:56,270
Get your divine power back soon.

267
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:58,080
It's okay if I can't get it back.

268
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:00,030
My Bai Cai became stronger.

269
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:02,670
You can protect me.

270
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:05,870
Come here. Sit down.

271
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:08,670
Take the medicine.

272
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:34,910
Isn't Bai Cai going with us?

273
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,270
No.

274
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:39,390
Gou.

275
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,790
Gou.

276
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:44,710
Zhazha said

277
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,390
his White Tiger is too eye-catching.

278
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:48,790
So he went back first to persuade Chen Jing.

279
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:50,170
Your Highness.

280
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:51,920
[Gongchen Gate]

281
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,030
Be safe.

282
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:53,460
Take care.

283
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:00,630
In that case,

284
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:02,270
let's set off.

285
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,900
[Gongchen Gate]

286
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:10,270
Sorry, Gou.

287
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:13,330
I know it's difficult without divine power.

288
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:15,950
It's the best

289
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:17,030
I can do.

290
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,260
I believe my Gou

291
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:20,720
can deal with it well

292
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:22,320
no matter how hard it is,

293
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:24,630
just like you did in the mine

294
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:26,230
and King's City.

295
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:28,630
In my absence,

296
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:31,390
you'll definitely be able to defeat the Immortal Clan

297
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:32,480
and save people.

298
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:33,390
Ms. Bai.

299
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:34,870
What's wrong?

300
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:57,570
Bai Cai.

301
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:01,330
Is it you who awakened me?

302
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:02,270
Who are you?

303
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,250
Are you Xinyue Kui?

304
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:06,350
Are you another member of the Immortal Clan

305
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:07,830
who came to bewitch me?

306
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:10,230
Do you really want to save

307
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:11,690
the person in front of you?

308
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:14,230
He's the most important person to me.

309
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:17,180
When you remember who you are,

310
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:19,240
you can save him.

311
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,230
Go away! Don't come over!

312
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:52,160
You've already made your choice.

313
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:54,450
What kind of monster are you?

314
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:56,960
One is everything.

315
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:58,870
Everything is one.

316
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:01,000
I'm you.

317
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:03,280
You're me.

318
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:23,990
Even though you're wearing my face,

319
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,620
you won't become me.

320
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:27,520
I don't care what you are

321
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:29,440
or what your purpose is,

322
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:31,620
I won't let you!

323
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,030
Your Crystal Power

324
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:36,160
is transformed from my divine spirit.

325
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,610
The more

326
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,210
or the more often you use it,

327
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:45,210
the sooner my divine awareness will awaken.

328
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:47,440
Of course,

329
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:50,870
whether you use it or not, it's all fated.

330
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,880
It's futile to struggle.

331
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:56,110
Fear is also useless.

332
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:01,000
Because returning to the three realms

333
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:04,460
is my destiny.

334
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:12,510
I don't believe in destiny.

335
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:14,510
I must find out

336
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:15,859
what's going on.

337
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:35,850
Are you awakening me?

338
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:54,700
Why is there

339
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:58,020
ancient divine spirit in Bai capital?

340
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:25,970
We're so hungry.

341
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:28,960
We're so hungry.

342
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:36,250
If this continues,

343
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:38,220
I'll be eaten by the Spirit Eaters.

344
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:44,000
Let me taste my master.

345
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,890
I'm so hungry.

346
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,960
She smells good.

347
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:53,540
I'm so hungry.

348
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,520
She smells good.

349
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:49,740
Immortal King.

350
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:52,350
Immortal King.

351
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:57,100
Have you seen everything I did

352
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:01,430
for the Immortal Clan?

353
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:24,190
Kui, what are you looking at?

354
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:26,180
Father.

355
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:29,790
Father.

356
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:30,750
Did you go to Crystal Mountain

357
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,080
to visit Immortal King?

358
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:32,990
Yes.

359
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:34,350
When you go to Crystal Mountain next time,

360
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:35,680
can you take me with you?

361
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,790
Immortal King is wise and handsome.

362
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:40,030
He unified the three realms

363
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:40,820
and created Immortal Realm

364
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:41,870
for us to live.

365
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:43,160
I admire him so much.

366
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:45,870
Kid.

367
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:48,470
Crystal Mountain is a forbidden place.

368
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:50,590
Only the High Priest can go.

369
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:51,990
I can't take you

370
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:54,070
Practice in peace.

371
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:01,630
High Priest?

372
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:04,510
If I become the High Priest...

373
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,990
The three realms belong to the Immortal Clan.

374
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:16,210
The Immortal Clan belongs to Immortal King.

375
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:18,030
I'll definitely remove all the obstacles

376
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:18,830
for the Immortal Clan

377
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:20,390
and Immortal King.

378
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:39,920
Tai Ji. Liu Yue.

379
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:46,110
Tai Ji. Liu Yue.

380
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,170
Greetings, High Priest.

381
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:53,670
Good.

382
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:56,150
I'm not dead yet.

383
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:58,150
How could you snub me?

384
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:01,130
I heard

385
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:02,950
you often

386
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:05,350
go to Sage Hall these days.

387
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:07,040
What?

388
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:09,670
You want a new rock?

389
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:12,580
With your skills,

390
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,110
in Shen Yan's heart,

391
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,310
you're worse than dogs.

392
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:20,110
Where's Zhui Ri?

393
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:21,710
Why isn't he back yet?

394
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:23,710
High Priest,

395
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:25,550
Zhui Ri

396
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:28,230
seems to have deliberately hidden his divine spirit.

397
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:30,110
We can't track him.

398
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:38,470
Tian Kui and Gui Mu are dead.

399
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:40,140
Shi Xing defected.

400
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:43,470
Now even Zhui Ri's whereabouts are unknown.

401
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:47,550
There were six Grand Immortals in Immortal Realm.

402
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:49,510
You two are the only ones left.

403
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:56,370
You suddenly summoned us.

404
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:58,110
Do you have any orders?

405
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:04,500
I just felt that there was ancient immortals' divine spirit

406
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:06,950
in the direction of Bai capital.

407
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,910
It's strong and unfamiliar.

408
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:29,840
Bai Cai?

409
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:33,910
Why did her divine power change?

410
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:38,250
Tai Ji. Liu Yue.

411
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,950
Go to the mortal realm to check immediately.

412
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:42,080
It can't be delayed.

413
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:47,750
Are you deaf?

414
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:49,390
High Priest,

415
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,240
the six tribes of Immortal Realm suffered losses one after another.

416
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,910
Now even you

417
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,600
are seriously injured.

418
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:02,910
It's not wise

419
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:06,290
to act rashly at this time.

420
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:08,910
Yes, High Priest.

421
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:11,030
What if

422
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:13,350
this is Wu Geng's trap again?

423
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:15,070
What should we do?

424
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,640
How dare you disobey my order?

425
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,300
I dare not.

426
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:21,830
But that day,

427
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:24,400
when Xuanfeng Great Sage got us back,

428
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:25,790
he sent

429
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:27,710
Grand Elder Shen Yan's word.

430
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:31,570
He said it's about the dignity of the Immortal Clan.

431
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:33,820
If we...

432
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:35,870
Go on.

433
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,360
If we...

434
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:40,870
If we're trapped by the human race again,

435
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:44,400
according to the Great Sages,

436
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:47,710
we'll be left to rot.

437
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:51,590
A great opportunity

438
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:52,990
is right in front of us.

439
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:54,230
But you two

440
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:55,710
are such cowards.

441
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:57,590
Didn't you see?

442
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:58,710
Something

443
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:00,350
must have happened to Bai Cai.

444
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:01,510
This is a great opportunity for us

445
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:02,750
to do something.

446
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:07,230
High Priest,

447
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:09,550
you're overconfident.

448
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:12,350
Wu Geng is now in alliance

449
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:14,150
with the human race,

450
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:17,110
the Demon Clan, the Shenyin Clan,

451
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:18,990
and Ziyu.

452
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:21,110
He's already fully-fledged.

453
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:22,260
Just like us,

454
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:25,030
the relationship between him and Bai Cai

455
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:26,790
won't be damaged

456
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:29,150
by you.

457
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:32,410
Now,

458
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:35,190
only members of Sage Hall can stop Wu Geng.

459
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:35,990
Then leave them

460
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:37,790
with the Great Sages.

461
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:41,830
In the three realms,

462
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,790
only Bai Cai can hurt Wu Geng now.

463
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:48,640
I'm not using the same trick again.

464
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:49,790
I just want to see

465
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:51,110
that happen.

466
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:54,880
I want to see Wu Geng and Bai Cai

467
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:57,680
die and get injured respectively.

468
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:01,820
With all due respect,

469
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:04,430
no matter what,

470
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:07,730
Immortal King and members of Sage Hall will stand before us.

471
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:09,270
Why should we juniors

472
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:10,390
persistent in

473
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:11,680
rushing forward?

474
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:13,590
You...

475
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,050
Take care, High Priest.

476
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:40,470
I will never give up.

477
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:46,530
Immortal King.

478
00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:51,720
For the Immortal Clan,

479
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:55,270
even if I have to sacrifice my life,

480
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:00,110
I won't hesitate.

481
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:46,570
Isn't this place nice?

482
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:55,110
This was your favorite cake

483
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:56,470
when you were a kid.

484
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:57,960
I don't know if you still like it

485
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,220
after all these years.

486
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:02,230
Everything has changed.

487
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:03,960
I don't like these anymore.

488
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:07,110
Yes.

489
00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:11,070
You've grown up.

490
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:13,340
But in my eyes,

491
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:14,950
you're still the kid

492
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:16,350
who chased after me

493
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:17,870
for candies.

494
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:19,990
All these years,

495
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:22,950
I've been avoiding being hunted by the Immortal Clan.

496
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:24,110
I don't know any news

497
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:26,390
about the clan.

498
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:28,110
Aren't you the one

499
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:31,310
who chose to betray the clan?

500
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:35,750
I know because of me,

501
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:37,630
you've been cold-shouldered at home

502
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:38,750
all these years.

503
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:42,090
But if you were asked to choose again,

504
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:44,880
you'd still betray the Immortal Clan.

505
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:51,560
That year, when you left,

506
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:54,370
I asked the elders of the clan,

507
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,680
"Where has my sister gone?"

508
00:28:58,550 --> 00:28:59,910
No one told me.

509
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:01,930
Then I thought

510
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:03,230
you

511
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:05,090
would definitely come back soon.

512
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:06,720
So I hadn't touched

513
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:08,550
that cake.

514
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:11,270
I wanted to wait for you to come back

515
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:12,330
and eat it with you.

516
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:15,960
I waited

517
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:18,430
until the cake

518
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:19,670
became moldy.

519
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:23,150
But you didn't come back.

520
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:26,710
So I removed the mold,

521
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:28,640
put it there, and kept waiting.

522
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:30,870
That cake was getting smaller.

523
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:36,350
Your image in my heart

524
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:39,270
was also getting blurry.

525
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:41,950
I'm sorry.

526
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:45,870
I always thought

527
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:48,930
that as long as I became stronger,

528
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:50,310
I could defeat the Shenyin Clan

529
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:51,670
that took you away

530
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:53,550
and bring you back.

531
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:57,240
I always told myself

532
00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:00,960
that the Immortal Clan couldn't be defeated.

533
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:07,350
But I later realized

534
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:10,790
that I was wrong.

535
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:17,150
I lost to you.

536
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:20,940
Zhui Ri.

537
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:24,030
I never regretted

538
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,390
being a traitor.

539
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:27,670
Now,

540
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:28,550
I still believe

541
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:30,150
that I did the right thing.

542
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,390
But you're the only one

543
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:33,710
I should say sorry to.

544
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,020
I've abandoned you for so many years.

545
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:40,070
I'm not a good sister.

546
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:43,740
Zhui Ri.

547
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:48,110
Members in our Shenyin Clan are free to come and go as they please.

548
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:49,510
If you don't want to stay,

549
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:52,370
no matter if you go back to Immortal Realm

550
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:54,470
or turn against me,

551
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:56,960
I won't blame you.

552
00:30:58,350 --> 00:30:59,150
Don't worry.

553
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:01,480
From now on,

554
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,770
I'll travel around the world.

555
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:07,270
I'm tired of

556
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:09,590
staying in Immortal Realm.

557
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:18,110
I made it out of boredom when I was a kid.

558
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:19,770
It's useless for me to keep it.

559
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:22,430
Take it.

560
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,820
I wonder how's the negotiation

561
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:18,550
between Wu Geng and Chen Jing.

562
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:21,350
I hope everything goes well.

563
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:24,670
Man.

564
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:27,190
I don't know when

565
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:29,970
your expectations for Wu Geng

566
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:33,550
became higher than your expectations for everyone else.

567
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:36,150
Not only me,

568
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:38,750
the 13 Generals

569
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:41,160
think so too.

570
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:43,830
Wu.

571
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:46,470
I can imagine

572
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,880
that we'll leave here in the future.

573
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:50,470
Demons

574
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:52,990
will work

575
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,250
from sunrise to sunset.

576
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:56,790
They'll no longer suffer

577
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:58,520
from Petrification Sickness.

578
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:14,040
Unfortunately,

579
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:16,230
I may not be able to see it.

580
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:34,130
You got Petrification Sickness?

581
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:35,190
Man.

582
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:37,750
Don't frown.

583
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:41,360
You don't look good when you frown.

584
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:47,110
When did you get it?

585
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:54,110
It's okay.

586
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:56,750
After I got sick,

587
00:33:58,110 --> 00:33:59,550
I felt at ease.

588
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:02,150
Fate

589
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:05,030
tied us

590
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:06,270
together.

591
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,350
I don't have to worry

592
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:12,070
that you're alone anymore.

593
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:17,230
You don't have to push me away anymore.

594
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:23,949
Okay.

595
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:27,880
In that case,

596
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:32,550
let's fight together until the end.

597
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:37,540
At this point,

598
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:40,949
you still don't know how to say nice things.

599
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:53,600
[Tomb of My Late Brother Haikuo Tiankong]

600
00:34:49,949 --> 00:34:50,949
It's okay.

601
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:52,750
It's good.

602
00:34:56,830 --> 00:34:57,670
This

603
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,590
is for the best.

604
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:11,910
We're back again.

605
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:15,230
You're home.

606
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:16,470
You're home.

607
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:18,230
But as soon as I got here,

608
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:19,830
my legs started to tremble.

609
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:21,540
I... I want to cry.

610
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:31,110
I didn't expect to come back here.

611
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:32,950
It's weird.

612
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:34,750
Every time I come here,

613
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:36,350
I'm at my most vulnerable.

614
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:39,550
Last time, I had no power.

615
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:42,550
This time, I lost all my divine power.

616
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:44,070
Don't worry.

617
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:46,010
Everything will be all right.

618
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:53,270
Greetings, Centurion.

619
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:55,550
For a long time,

620
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:56,910
no one called me that.

621
00:35:57,910 --> 00:35:58,840
Where is Zhazha?

622
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:00,390
Why didn't he come out to welcome me?

623
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:01,190
Centurion.

624
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:02,780
Young Master

625
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:05,010
is being hung and punished by Master.

626
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:06,910
Did I hear you right?

627
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:09,440
Chen Jing loves his son so much.

628
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,350
He hung Zhazha up

629
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:12,910
like me?

630
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:15,480
Gou, how dare you come back?

631
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:16,860
Prepare to die!

632
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:49,560
Mr. Chen, long time no see.

633
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:53,780
Gou, tell me.

634
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:55,950
Why did you come back this time?

635
00:36:58,700 --> 00:36:59,890
I just heard

636
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:01,800
that you hung Zhazha up.

637
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:03,830
I know how to do this well.

638
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:05,260
How about I help you

639
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:06,550
teach him a lesson?

640
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:09,670
Zhazha acts recklessly.

641
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:12,230
I didn't expect him to go all the way

642
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,270
with you

643
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:14,940
and speak for you.

644
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:18,700
As a slave of immortals,

645
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:20,790
I must teach him a lesson.

646
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:24,030
Mr. Chen.

647
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:26,270
Why don't you speak louder?

648
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,190
In fact, Xinyue Kui

649
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:28,910
doesn't have time

650
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:30,510
to watch the View Mirror now.

651
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:32,670
Stop acting.

652
00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:37,510
Listen up.

653
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:41,110
This person is an enemy of the Immortal Clan.

654
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:42,230
Being with him

655
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:44,400
is being an enemy of the Immortal Clan.

656
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:45,870
Remember,

657
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:48,250
don't be with him in private.

658
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:49,360
Understood?

659
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:50,550
Yes.

660
00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:53,870
Also, from today onwards,

661
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:56,670
Northern Mountain Mine will close

662
00:37:57,550 --> 00:37:59,120
until this enemy

663
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:01,180
leaves on his own.

664
00:38:03,830 --> 00:38:05,160
Are you really leaving?

665
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:06,830
Mr. Chen.

666
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:10,150
He...

667
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:14,910
The door closed.

668
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:37,310
Why did I fall asleep here?

669
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:39,460
How long have I been asleep?

670
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:48,240
I need to cook first.

671
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:49,870
When the kids come back,

672
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:51,270
they can have food to eat.

673
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:03,220
Fate is coming.

674
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:05,980
Fate is coming.

675
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:08,260
Fate is coming.

676
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:10,790
Fate is coming.

677
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:13,690
Fate is coming.

678
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:16,320
Fate is coming.

679
00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:38,950
Bai Cai.

680
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:40,730
Bai Cai.

681
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:43,620
Bai Cai.

682
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:45,250
What took you so long?

683
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:46,310
Bai Cai.

684
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:47,870
We went to the city today.

685
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:50,150
A soldier was killed in the daytime.

686
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,560
They said he was killed by divine power.

687
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:55,350
Everyone said it was the revenge of the Immortal Clan.

688
00:39:55,350 --> 00:39:56,990
That corpse is so scary.

689
00:39:57,550 --> 00:39:58,430
You're so young.

690
00:39:58,430 --> 00:40:00,070
How could you look at dead people?

691
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:01,550
We heard it from others.

692
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:02,270
It is said

693
00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:04,480
that that divine power is very rare.

694
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:06,150
The corpse was covered with frost,

695
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:08,050
as if it was frozen.

696
00:40:08,350 --> 00:40:09,440
Daytime?

697
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:11,130
Where was I in the daytime?

698
00:40:21,350 --> 00:40:22,390
Bai Cai, what's wrong?

699
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:23,310
What's wrong?

700
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:24,350
What's wrong?

701
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:29,040
Kids.

702
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:30,230
I prepared meals

703
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:31,350
for you

704
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:33,160
They can be eaten for days.

705
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:34,550
In the next few days,

706
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:36,390
I won't live here.

707
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:38,270
Bai Cai, where are you going?

708
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:39,030
Bai Cai.

709
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:40,290
I have something to do.

710
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:42,150
Listen to me.

711
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:44,140
Don't go out at night.

712
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:44,910
Be good.

713
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:45,750
Understood?

714
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:49,390
If you find me

715
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:50,710
being weird

716
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:52,150
and behaving like others

717
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:54,280
on the street in the next few days,

718
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:56,150
don't come to me.

719
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:57,270
You should run away immediately.

720
00:40:57,270 --> 00:40:58,150
Understood?

721
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:01,110
I knew.

722
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:02,070
Bai Cai is going

723
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:03,150
to Gou.

724
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:04,810
So she doesn't want to take us.

725
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:07,990
I see.

726
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:09,710
Naughty. Go.

727
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:10,150
Let's go.

728
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:10,750
Bai Cai is going

729
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:12,270
to Gou.

730
00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:29,140
It looked like

731
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:29,910
Master wanted to

732
00:41:29,910 --> 00:41:31,150
fight to the death.

733
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:32,660
It's impossible for us to have a talk with him.

734
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:34,750
Why are we still here?

735
00:41:34,830 --> 00:41:35,760
Are you stupid?

736
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:38,870
Lan, tell him.

737
00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:42,950
If Chen Jing really had wanted to fight us,

738
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:46,150
he wouldn't have allowed us to warm ourselves by the fire.

739
00:41:47,830 --> 00:41:49,150
You're right.

740
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:50,550
Gou, you thought of everything.

741
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:51,540
Yes.

742
00:41:52,430 --> 00:41:53,640
Master!

743
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:55,730
Master!

744
00:41:56,350 --> 00:41:57,290
Master!

745
00:41:57,550 --> 00:41:58,570
Master.

746
00:41:58,950 --> 00:42:00,150
You weren't hung up?

747
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:01,630
He doesn't dare.

748
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:04,750
He just said it.

749
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:07,150
But everyone in the mine

750
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:08,960
thinks I've been hung up now.

751
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:12,550
Mr. Chen is really thoughtful.

752
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:15,770
Since you can come out,

753
00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:17,630
Mr. Chen must have something

754
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:18,910
for you to tell me.

755
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:19,790
No.

756
00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:21,070
No?

757
00:42:22,350 --> 00:42:24,510
Master, my father wants to see you.
