[Episode 15]

4
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,660
No! No!

5
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:03,510
Thank god.

6
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:06,080
Not everyone here is a monster.

7
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:08,840
It's time to eat.

8
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:11,870
What's the matter?

9
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,950
Do you not like the buns I made?

10
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:15,550
Give it a try.

11
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:16,150
Everyone says

12
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,520
the buns I made are good.

13
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,470
Why are you locked up here?

14
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:24,829
Where are you from?

15
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,840
Are you from Xin State?

16
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:47,450
How is Xin State now?

17
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:49,660
I guess

18
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,710
you've been locked here for a long time.

19
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:52,870
Or you wouldn't have asked that.

20
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,060
Answer me!

21
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,510
You monsters

22
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:00,150
are all so brutal!

23
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:01,670
Tell me

24
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:02,910
how to get out of here first.

25
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:04,030
What happened to Xin State?

26
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,430
Tell me now!

27
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:08,290
Xin State doesn't exist anymore.

28
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:10,480
The Immortal Clan conquered Xin State

29
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:12,480
and replaced it with Bai State.

30
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:16,350
How about the empress of Xin State?

31
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,470
Is she still alive?

32
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,150
No.

33
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:24,150
The empress took the prince

34
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,150
to the Zhaixing Pavilion and set it ablaze,

35
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:27,750
perishing in the flames with Xin State.

36
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,750
The fire burned for a day and a night.

37
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:32,190
Both of them were burned to ashes.

38
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,520
Shi Xing.

39
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:47,990
I underestimated

40
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:50,050
your divine power of the Asura Realm.

41
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:51,350
The Seal of the Dead

42
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:53,310
hasn't weakened you at all.

43
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:57,240
On the contrary, it has made you stronger.

44
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:14,960
Father.

45
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:17,200
Look.

46
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,050
Your eyes

47
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:23,980
fit me perfectly.

48
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:03,000
Very good, Hu.

49
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,720
Recently,

50
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:07,500
your divine power of the Kongshi Realm has grown much stronger.

51
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,750
And your prophecy skills

52
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,410
have improved quite a lot too.

53
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:13,680
Father,

54
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:15,470
but I still can only see

55
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:17,350
blurry visions.

56
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:18,190
I still can't see

57
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,830
more specific things.

58
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:21,960
Don't worry.

59
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:23,950
Take your time to feel

60
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:26,130
the change of the divine power in your body.

61
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:28,390
Transform it and control it

62
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:30,270
so that you can make use of it.

63
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:33,330
Don't be like your sister.

64
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,760
She just wants a shortcut, and her foundation is weak.

65
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:41,150
Father.

66
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:42,510
The prophecy skills

67
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:43,930
are what my sister wants to learn the most.

68
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:45,550
She just wants to master them as soon as possible

69
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:47,110
to make you happy.

70
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:49,750
Your sister

71
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:52,390
is gifted,

72
00:06:52,909 --> 00:06:54,820
but she's too ambitious.

73
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:57,130
The more divine skills she learns,

74
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:58,580
the greater

75
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,360
her ambitions become.

76
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:03,330
It'll cause her to lose her sanity in the end.

77
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:04,520
Father.

78
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:05,710
Forget it.

79
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:08,420
Come on. Let's practice together.

80
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,900
You praise my sister for whatever she does.

81
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:25,710
But no matter what I do,

82
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:27,270
I'm still a thorn in your eyes.

83
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:28,270
Just wait and see.

84
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,870
High Priest. High Priest!

85
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:55,030
I'm Gui Mu.

86
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:56,150
It's you again.

87
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:57,850
Gui Mu.

88
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:00,790
Fu Xi is very cunning.

89
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,040
How did you

90
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,240
track him down?

91
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,550
High Priest.

92
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,800
The person I tracked down

93
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:15,590
was not Fu Xi,

94
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:18,530
but a slave girl.

95
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:20,630
Through this girl,

96
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:23,170
I found Shenyin Village.

97
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,300
I also found that

98
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:27,270
this girl possessed

99
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:31,100
a mysterious power.

100
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:32,780
What mysterious power?

101
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:35,940
I don't know it yet.

102
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,799
Gui Mu.

103
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:41,960
Speaking of which,

104
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:43,980
you got injured again

105
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,840
in the battle at Shenyin Village.

106
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,110
Look at you now.

107
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:54,350
How pitiful you are.

108
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:58,500
High Priest, please show me mercy

109
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:01,270
and give me some pills.

110
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:03,130
Think about it.

111
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,490
If it weren’t for me,

112
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:08,470
you wouldn’t have found

113
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,430
Shenyin Village so easily, right?

114
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,190
You're right.

115
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:17,230
In that case,

116
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:19,170
compared to fighting in battles,

117
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:21,370
you, the Plague Immortal,

118
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:22,710
are better suited

119
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:24,710
to gather information.

120
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:27,350
Why don't you go to Xuan Chai

121
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:29,250
to ask for a job?

122
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:36,290
Gui Mu.

123
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:38,630
You should be grateful

124
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:40,080
that I didn't punish you for your incompetence.

125
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,130
Get out.

126
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:42,630
Don't let me

127
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:44,560
see your embarrassing face again.

128
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:48,560
Okay. I'm out of here. I'm out of here.

129
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:49,430
Stop.

130
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:51,830
If you can't

131
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:53,630
find out who that girl is,

132
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:57,420
I'll kill you.

133
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:00,520
I understand.

134
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:02,310
I'm your loyal servant.

135
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,570
I'll go find it out right away.

136
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:09,150
Father.

137
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:11,950
How many secrets

138
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:14,350
are hidden in your eyes?

139
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:34,020
Who killed him?

140
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,430
Should we take a break?

141
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:39,990
No.

142
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:41,710
It's cooler in the desert at night

143
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:43,470
than during the day.

144
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:44,950
We can walk fast at night.

145
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,070
But we don't even know

146
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:48,470
where the King's City is.

147
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:49,830
It's useless to be anxious.

148
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:50,840
The sooner we get there,

149
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,390
the better chance we stand.

150
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:00,280
High Priest.

151
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,670
Should we take action now?

152
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:06,590
Have you forgotten what Shi Xing said that day?

153
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:08,510
Whoever wants to kill him

154
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:10,470
will be killed by me.

155
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,070
At this moment,

156
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:16,130
they're too close to the King's City.

157
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:17,750
If we take action now,

158
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:19,350
Shi Xing can feel

159
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:20,750
our divine power immediately.

160
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,590
He's a crazy man.

161
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:24,670
We need to wake the King of Immortals from his seclusion

162
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:26,030
to take him down.

163
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:27,820
For such a trivial matter,

164
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:30,000
we can't afford to disrupt

165
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:32,410
the King of Immortals' seclusion.

166
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:35,480
Then, High Priest, what do you think we should do?

167
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:39,360
Trap them in the desert until they die.

168
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,070
Keep it quiet when you do it.

169
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,950
Don't let Shi Xing notice it.

170
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:00,450
Lan.

171
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,960
Stay still.

172
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:50,610
We're surrounded by quicksand.

173
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:51,590
Why is the tornado

174
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:53,190
following us wherever we go?

175
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:55,150
It's the divine power of the Wanxiang Realm.

176
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,910
The divine power of the Wanxiang Realm?

177
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,230
This is the Immortal Clan's doing?

178
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:59,140
It's strange.

179
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:01,950
The wind can't hurt us

180
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:03,350
but can trap us here.

181
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:04,110
I wonder

182
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:05,320
what this is for.

183
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,590
I know.

184
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:08,550
Someone is using the tornado

185
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:10,390
to lure us into quicksand.

186
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,190
The quicksand can't trap us,

187
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:14,150
but it can lead us astray.

188
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:15,350
In the end,

189
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:16,270
we won't be able

190
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:17,600
to find the King's City.

191
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,990
So the right way

192
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:21,830
is in the direction of the tornado.

193
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:22,600

00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:58,990
To celebrate…

382
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:14,510
It seems that

383
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:17,040
they're monsters that only come out at night.

384
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:20,610
That's the only place that has light.

385
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:22,630
Shi Xing must be there.

386
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:46,590
Shi Xing, let me out!

387
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:48,630
After I get out, I'll kill you!

388
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:51,350
Shi Xing, let me out!

389
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:52,860
Let me out!

390
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:54,560
Could Bai Cai and Uncle Ziyu

391
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:56,180
be locked up here?

392
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:00,630
Looks like someone has a death wish.

393
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:02,340
Come here. Let me out!

394
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:04,350
I'll kill Shi Xing for you!

395
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:06,030
Let me out!

396
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:07,630
Let me out!

397
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:08,350
Who is she?

398
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:11,540
Who on earth is she?

399
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:14,080
It's time to eat.

400
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:21,260
It's time to eat.

401
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,670
Who on earth

402
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:29,900
is that woman?

403
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:38,230
Tell me.

404
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:39,610
Tell me!

405
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:42,710
Who on earth is that woman?

406
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:46,030
Let go of me!

407
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:47,310
You lunatic!

408
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:49,550
I don't know what you're talking about.

409
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:10,870
Bai Cai, how are you?

410
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:17,090
Gou.

411
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:22,020
Gou, you're finally here.

412
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:24,480
Gou, what took you so long?

413
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:26,050
Gou.

414
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:28,640
Sorry. I'm late.

415
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:42,120
I'm fine.

416
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:49,270
By the way, Gou,

417
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:51,890
many people are imprisoned here.

418
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,260
Over there,

419
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:56,000
there seems to be someone from Xin State.

420
00:30:56,670 --> 00:30:57,510
Xin State?

421
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:03,470
Could it be Uncle Ziyu?

422
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:29,480
Gou, let's run.

423
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,780
We can't beat him.

424
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,830
Without taking him down,

425
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:34,160
we can't get out of here.

426
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:35,830
You really came.

427
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:39,670
Shi Xing, I've come as promised.

428
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:41,650
Why didn't you keep your promise?

429
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:43,030
So what?

430
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:05,960
I didn't expect

431
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:08,490
the battle at Shenyin Village

432
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:12,850
to give you

433
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:14,480
quite a bit of combat experience.

434
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,410
Shi Xing.

435
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:17,670
Although you're from the Immortal Clan,

436
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:18,590
you must not underestimate

437
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:20,190
the wisdom of the human race.

438
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:28,920
The human race is ignorant.

439
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:31,270
Do you really think

440
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:33,930
you can hurt me just like this?

441
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:38,680
Gou.

442
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:09,350
Gou!

443
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:16,950
You haven't improved at all.

444
00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:22,560
I feel humiliated by the fact

445
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:25,490
that you actually came to me with a crippled arm.

446
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:31,790
Didn't I tell you

447
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:33,550
to elevate your cultivation to its peak

448
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:34,680
before coming to me?

449
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:36,910
Look at you now.

450
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:39,310
You're a total wreck.

451
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:42,550
You're not qualified to be my opponent.

452
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:45,380
Let Bai Cai go.

453
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,990
Since you care so much about her,

454
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:50,070
tomorrow,

455
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:52,070
at midnight,

456
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:53,670
come to defeat me.

457
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:56,150
If you fail,

458
00:33:56,830 --> 00:34:00,300
both of you will die.

459
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:05,270
Actually, it's easy to defeat you,

460
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:08,030
as long as you do me a favor.

461
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:10,880
What's it?

462
00:34:11,469 --> 00:34:14,449
Send me

463
00:34:14,989 --> 00:34:16,520
into the cell in the middle.

464
00:34:19,429 --> 00:34:20,449
Interesting.

465
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:23,270
Interesting.

466
00:34:24,389 --> 00:34:25,300
Boy,

467
00:34:25,469 --> 00:34:26,230
you are the first person

468
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,909
who has intrigued me.

469
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:32,909
Don't let me down.

470
00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:35,810
Gou.

471
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,840
Gou.

472
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:45,719
Gou.

473
00:34:46,469 --> 00:34:47,270
Gou.

474
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:34,620
Were you

475
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:36,590
taken here by Shi Xing as well?

476
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:53,150
How long have you been kept here?

477
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:56,790
How long?

478
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:00,110
I don't remember.

479
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:05,230
Don't you want to escape?

480
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:10,390
The people I care about

481
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:11,870
are all gone.

482
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,990
To me, the outside world

483
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:16,960
is just

484
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,830
a bigger prison.

485
00:36:21,830 --> 00:36:23,090
Are you from Xin State?

486
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,430
Xin State is gone.

487
00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:40,670
He's gone too.

488
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:42,870
Uncle Ziyu.

489
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,430
It's really you.

490
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:48,030
Back then, when Xin State was at war,

491
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:49,180
you and my father

492
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:51,200
fought against Hei Long together.

493
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:54,190
Uncle Ziyu, it's me.

494
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:55,740
I'm Wu Geng.

495
00:36:57,470 --> 00:36:59,140
You're Wu Geng?

496
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:03,110
I don't know who you are.

497
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:06,050
But one thing's for sure, you're not Wu Geng.

498
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:08,950
That day, I rushed back to the Xin capital

499
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:09,910
to rescue the people there

500
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:12,030
before the Immortal Clan attacked the city.

501
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:13,310
However,

502
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:16,740
she set fire to the Zhaixing Pavilion.

503
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:19,870
She and Wu Geng

504
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:23,710
are long gone.

505
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:26,580
No, Uncle Ziyu.

506
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:28,840
My mother

507
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:30,270
saw the future

508
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:32,080
when I was born.

509
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:34,030
So she took out

510
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:35,670
a shred of my primordial spirit

511
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,400
and kept it in the mortal world.

512
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:39,680
Before she died,

513
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:42,150
she protected me with her divine spirit

514
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:42,910
so that I could

515
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:44,270
take on Gou's identity

516
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:46,680
to evade the Immortal Clan's pursuit.

517
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:09,530
It's your mother's wristband

518
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:12,690
and her remaining divine spirit.

519
00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:20,900
Are you really Wu Geng?

520
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:24,740
You're not dead?

521
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,360
Uncle Ziyu.

522
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:29,270
I guessed

523
00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:30,230
that Shi Xing would have brought you

524
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:31,310
to this place.

525
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:34,270
Before I arrived in the King's City,

526
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:34,950
I was nervous

527
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:36,470
all the way.

528
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:39,350
I was afraid that I'd be disappointed in the end.

529
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:42,190
But now, I'm finally looking at you.

530
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:44,310
Great.

531
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:47,670
Wu Geng.

532
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:50,960
Since you were born,

533
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:54,400
I had been traveling around the world.

534
00:38:55,790 --> 00:38:56,950
I've never taken a close look

535
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:58,390
at you like this.

536
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:01,840
Your eyes

537
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:04,560
look exactly

538
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:08,350
like your father's eyes.

539
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:26,550
Wu Geng.

540
00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:29,280
Uncle Ziyu.

541
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:01,030
Break!

542
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:18,710
Wu Geng, wait for me.

543
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:25,790
Who's she?

544
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:28,620
That woman.

545
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:34,490
Where is she?

546
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:44,420
Why can't I remember anything?

547
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:51,360
Who on earth is that woman?

548
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:52,930
Who is she?

549
00:40:57,190 --> 00:40:59,490
Why can't I remember anything?

550
00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:03,160
Where is she?

551
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:19,310
Tell me. Who is she?

552
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:20,070
How would I know

553
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:21,250
who that woman is?

554
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,270
You're lying.

555
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:25,110
You definitely know

556
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:26,390
who that woman is.

557
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:27,700
Tell me.

558
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:29,220
Tell me who she is!

559
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:31,490
I…I don't know.

560
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:38,560
Who is she? Answer me!
