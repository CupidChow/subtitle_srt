[Episode 11]

4
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:39,940
Over the past 100,000 years,

5
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:42,490
Hei Long has been invincible.

6
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:44,710
If you want to defeat him,

7
00:01:45,229 --> 00:01:46,910
you have to improve

8
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:48,670
your abilities in practice

9
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:50,870
to become brave and resourceful,

10
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:54,030
and make more people adore you

11
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,229
and support you.

12
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:56,509
Only in this way

13
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:58,670
can you approach him

14
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:00,190
step by step

15
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:01,620
and defeat him.

16
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:03,830
You can have anger.

17
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:04,910
Because anger

18
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:06,510
can guide you.

19
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:09,139
But you mustn't let anger

20
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:11,070
hinder your rationality.

21
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:13,030
Old Man.

22
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:15,390
I understand.

23
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:17,390
Don't worry.

24
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,070
No matter how long it takes,

25
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:22,390
I will never give up.

26
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:23,630
Good child.

27
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:27,240
Alright, it's late.

28
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:29,050
Go back and rest early.

29
00:02:36,829 --> 00:02:38,760
By the river outside Shenyin Clan,

30
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:41,130
there is a type of herb called Wuxin Herb.

31
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:44,270
It's very effective for treating your injury.

32
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:46,920
Remember to check it out tomorrow.

33
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:52,710
Father, Mother.

34
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,329
I won't be defeated by anyone,

35
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:57,110
be it an enemy

36
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,680
or myself.

37
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:18,510
Oh no. Why is it her?

38
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:19,870
If she finds out

39
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:20,710
I'm here too,

40
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,670
she'd gouge my eyes out.

41
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:32,750
Who is it?

42
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,030
Come out!

43
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:50,700
As expected, I can't hide anything from

44
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,630
your Assassination Butterflies.

45
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:05,910
What are you doing here?

46
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,630
To see you, of course.

47
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:08,870
Now you can't

48
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,030
use the human race as an excuse

49
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,030
to avoid me.

50
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:14,510
I want to talk to you.

51
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:16,560
I have nothing to talk with you.

52
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,560
I just want to tell you

53
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:20,459
I've always loved you.

54
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:21,700
Let go!

55
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:44,890
Excuse me.

56
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:47,140
I've only been at Shenyin Village for a few days.

57
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:49,270
I don’t know much about the rules here.

58
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:50,190
Is this how

59
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:51,870
you chase girls here?

60
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,080
It's quite special.

61
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,360
Especially shameless.

62
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:01,110
You're an unskilled human.

63
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:02,630
This is none of your business.

64
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:03,350
Get lost!

65
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,230
You're unlucky.

66
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:07,550
I like

67
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:09,390
to ruin things for others.

68
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:20,790
High Priest, someone's killing someone!

69
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:26,710
Do you think you can hurt me

70
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:28,440
with your inferior abilities?

71
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,520
Since you are courting death,

72
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,450
don't blame me for being ruthless.

73
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:37,830
You're haughty because you have divine power.

74
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:39,460
If I have divine power too,

75
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:40,630
we don't know

76
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:41,670
who will win.

77
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:43,720
No wonder Master doesn't like you.

78
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:48,200
Even if I don't use my divine power,

79
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:50,800
killing you is a piece of cake.

80
00:05:58,470 --> 00:05:59,409
Zi Dian!

81
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,380
High Priest will punish you

82
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,630
and kick you out of Shenyin Village.

83
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:04,990
Since the day I met you,

84
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,190
I couldn't stop.

85
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:07,510
I love you so much.

86
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:08,990
The whole Shenyin Village knows it.

87
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:10,250
But you just ignore it.

88
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,590
What's wrong with me?

89
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,880
What's wrong with you?

90
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:15,490
What's good about you?

91
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:21,830
For the sake

92
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:23,070
of High Priest,

93
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:25,720
I wanted to spare your life.

94
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:28,620
There is actually

95
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,880
a scumbag like you in Shenyin Village!

96
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:02,180
To save this human,

97
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:04,990
you actually sacrificed your divine spirit

98
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:06,510
to nullify your paralysis!

99
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,310
Why do you care so much about him?

100
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:10,590
If you don't leave,

101
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,230
I'll get the Assassination Butterflies

102
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:13,790
to cut off your head.

103
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:36,990
His attacks were vicious.

104
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,590
Why did you provoke him?

105
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:41,270
I couldn't watch him bully you

106
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:42,590
and do nothing.

107
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,330
His heart is severely damaged.

108
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:07,310
It's hard for him to recover quickly

109
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:09,040
with magic and medicine alone.

110
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:11,230
Lan.

111
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,120
This isn't training.

112
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,420
You're practically killing him.

113
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:17,310
I know

114
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,630
you're anxious for Gou to finish his apprenticeship.

115
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:21,630
But training should be conducted in moderation.

116
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:23,390
I went overboard.

117
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,560
Thank you, Clan Leader Kong Que.

118
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,350
Remember it.

119
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:33,070
Master.

120
00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:36,230
Lie down.

121
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:38,000
You're severely injured.

122
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:39,030
Master.

123
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:41,110
Why didn't you tell the clan leader

124
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:42,370
it was Zi Dian's fault?

125
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:45,030
I know what to do about this.

126
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,360
He wanted to harass you.

127
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:48,480
We can't let him off just like this.

128
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:50,230
We can talk

129
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:51,870
after you recover.

130
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,190
An evil immortal like him

131
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:57,190
shouldn't stay in Shenyin Village.

132
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:02,550
Fine.

133
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:04,250
I'll tell you then.

134
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:05,490
Don't move around.

135
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:08,430
Zi Dian

136
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:10,610
is my brother's buddy.

137
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,230
My brother

138
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:22,000
was a general of the Immortal Clan.

139
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:24,390
He offended Xinyue Kui

140
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:26,440
and was framed for treason.

141
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:27,870
Hei Long ordered

142
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,310
to kill our whole family.

143
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:32,090
When my brother was arrested,

144
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:34,920
he asked me to escape from Immortal Realm.

145
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:37,310
But there were immortal soldiers and generals everywhere.

146
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,910
Where could I'd escaped to?

147
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,070
At that time, I thought

148
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,450
I could just die in battle with my brother.

149
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:48,510
But at that time,

150
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:51,710
Zi Dian came to save me.

151
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:55,910
He even took me along to escape from Immortal Realm

152
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:57,990
and became a traitor.

153
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:01,850
Can he be disrespectful to you

154
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:02,790
just because

155
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:03,900
he helped you?

156
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:08,910
He has his reasons.

157
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:10,790
All these years,

158
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,910
although he kept saying he doesn't want to

159
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:14,070
be in exile anymore,

160
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:15,870
he kept following

161
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:18,470
and protecting the people of Shenyin Village.

162
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:20,910
He has done so much for me.

163
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:22,750
I can't repay him.

164
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:26,200
From now on,

165
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:28,120
don't fight him head-on.

166
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,230
I'll make him understand

167
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:31,790
that you're not an enemy.

168
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:37,870
By the way,

169
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:39,790
don't tell Bai Cai

170
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,230
I'm hurt.

171
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:42,430
Gou.

172
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:43,970
Gou.

173
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:46,390
You need someone to take care of you.

174
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:48,790
I heard about it.

175
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:49,510
Tell me.

176
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:51,070
Who did this to you?

177
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,910
I'm fine.

178
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:54,350
Don't I end up like this

179
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:55,390
after every training?

180
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:56,720
It's not the first time.

181
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:58,830
Neither Yun Zhongzi nor Lan

182
00:10:58,910 --> 00:10:59,710
would ever attack you

183
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:00,590
so viciously.

184
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:02,270
Tell me the truth.

185
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:04,070
Who did this to you?

186
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:10,510
It's me.

187
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:13,230
I thought

188
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:15,230
I've improved a lot.

189
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:16,590
So I went to Master

190
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:18,490
and got her to compete with me.

191
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:20,490
I also asked her not to show mercy.

192
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:21,480
In the end,

193
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:23,070
this happened.

194
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:29,830
Where are you going?

195
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:30,950
You're severely injured.

196
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:31,910
I'm going to ask Lan for a prescription

197
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:33,110
to brew some medicine for you.

198
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:34,110
I'm really fine.

199
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,910
All right, just lie down.

200
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:36,540
Here.

201
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:41,150
Bai Cai...

202
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,190
Why did you hurt Gou?

203
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,280
I don't know what you're talking about.

204
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:55,790
I asked Kong Que.

205
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:56,550
This time, Gou

206
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,430
didn't just sustain a simple external injury.

207
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:00,390
His heart is severely damaged!

208
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:01,750
Are you training him

209
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,430
to make him stronger

210
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:05,390
or making use of this chance to torture him

211
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:06,900
and give him false hope,

212
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:08,150
to see him suffer

213
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:09,280
over and over again?

214
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,750
Deep down, do you all

215
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,070
think he's laughable?

216
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:18,110
He chose

217
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:19,710
this path himself.

218
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:22,170
High Priest and I had already told him

219
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:23,320
that on this path,

220
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:24,550
he'd encounter infinite danger.

221
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:26,230
Danger should come from the enemy,

222
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:27,510
not our own.

223
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:29,750
You are training him hard

224
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:31,630
because you want him to defeat Hei Long.

225
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:33,400
You talk about how all beings are equal.

226
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,950
Is Gou's life less important

227
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:36,500
than others' lives?

228
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:44,000
Could it be that I'm wrong?

229
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:47,750
It's fine that you don't care

230
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:48,750
about Gou's life.

231
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,070
But let me tell you,

232
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:51,190
I care.

233
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:52,550
Whoever dares to

234
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:53,390
hurt him again

235
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:54,450
will be dealt with.

236
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:13,070
I thought we'd be free

237
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:14,590
after leaving the mine,

238
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:16,190
and we'd be able to live a free

239
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:17,540
albeit poor

240
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,230
life as before.

241
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:21,390
To think we'd end up here.

242
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:23,050
We might as well be at the mine.

243
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:24,800
Don't say that.

244
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:26,910
At the mine,

245
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:28,310
we had no autonomy.

246
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:29,830
Now that we're here,

247
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,390
we make our own decisions.

248
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:37,970
Do you remember Bigfoot Monster?

249
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:40,990
Of course.

250
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:43,270
I will never forget it.

251
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,110
When I saw you all beat up

252
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:46,230
at the training ground,

253
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:47,550
it was like we were back at the mine

254
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:48,990
when you were fighting Bigfoot Monster

255
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:50,430
at the coliseum.

256
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:52,830
How is it the same?

257
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:55,200
In Shenyin Village,

258
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:55,960
they are trying

259
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,110
to make me stronger.

260
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:58,710
And now,

261
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:00,870
I'm getting stronger indeed.

262
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:02,910
All right.

263
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:04,430
Stop talking.

264
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,750
By the way,

265
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:09,190
back at the mine,

266
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:10,070
the medicine Old Man gave you

267
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:11,110
cured my illness.

268
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:12,550
I'll go find him now.

269
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:13,830
He must have the magical medicine

270
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:15,110
to cure your illness.

271
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:16,550
Here, drink it up.

272
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:18,610
It's okay, Bai Cai.

273
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:22,710
Old Man!

274
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:23,990
Old Man!

275
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:25,190
Bai Cai.

276
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:26,510
Can you save Gou?

277
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:27,750
What's wrong with Gou?

278
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,380
Previously, didn't you give him

279
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:30,150
some magical medicine

280
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:31,190
at the mine?

281
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:31,910
Yes.

282
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:33,480
Gou is seriously ill now.

283
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:34,990
I want you to save him.

284
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:37,590
I know about

285
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:38,550
Gou's injury.

286
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:40,230
What he needs most now

287
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:42,230
is to recover and rest.

288
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:43,830
Bai Cai.

289
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,150
Kong Que cultivates

290
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:47,150
the divine power of the Immortal Realm.

291
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:48,190
Her healing

292
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:49,430
is much more effective

293
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,890
than my magical medicine.

294
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:51,830
Don't worry.

295
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:59,000
Old Man.

296
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:01,870
Is this an oracle bone?

297
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:03,070
Yes.

298
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:06,630
I didn't expect you to recognize this object

299
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:08,550
at such a young age.

300
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:12,390
I heard a legend

301
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:13,430
that people in ancient times

302
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:15,630
used oracle bones to predict good or bad luck.

303
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:17,290
I've always been interested.

304
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:20,230
Can I have a look?

305
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:22,070
Sure.

306
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:28,680
I've seen it before.

307
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:30,230
I really have.

308
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:35,240
Can it really predict good or bad luck?

309
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:36,390
Of course.

310
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:43,030
Does it have other functions?

311
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:47,020
It can predict

312
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:48,870
where people with special abilities

313
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:49,830
are at.

314
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:54,270
Thank you, Old Man.

315
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:56,160
I'll go back to take care of Gou.

316
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,110
If none of you are willing to save Gou,

317
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:09,310
I'll save him myself.

318
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:10,750
When he recovers,

319
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,550
I'll take him away immediately.

320
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:19,790
Oh no.

321
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,200
This bout of cold disease is strong.

322
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,070
It seems to be more serious

323
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:25,390
than before.

324
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,210
Wine can ward off the cold.

325
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:31,710
I don't care.

326
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:42,590
That's right!

327
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:44,910
Wine...

328
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:57,250
When the weasel pays its respect to the chicken,

329
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,880
it must have an ulterior motive.

330
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:07,869
Yun Zhongzi.

331
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:08,750
I'm here

332
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,190
to apologize to you.

333
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:11,230
That day,

334
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:13,030
I hurt you because I was anxious.

335
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:14,510
Please be magnanimous and forgive me.

336
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:15,910
Don't mind my ignorance.

337
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:18,069
This is my signature dish.

338
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:19,390
As the saying goes,

339
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:20,790
having good wine and good food

340
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,150
beats being an immortal.

341
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:23,240
If you don't mind,

342
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,540
I'll cook all your drinking dishes

343
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:25,510
in the future.

344
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:26,740
Here.

345
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:32,600
You're quite the sweet talker.

346
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:34,960
It's rare for you to be so kind.

347
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:44,070
You have

348
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:45,380
a short temper,

349
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:47,620
but you're

350
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,070
a decent cook.

351
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:52,230
Eat more if you like it.

352
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:53,230
If you want to eat anything,

353
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:54,070
just let me know.

354
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:56,310
Alright, stop dawdling.

355
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:59,000
Tell me, what do you want from me?

356
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:00,230
Yun Zhongzi,

357
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:01,990
you're really smart.

358
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:03,910
I'll be frank then.

359
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,210
I heard from the villagers

360
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:07,750
there is a kind of divine medicine

361
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,150
in the medicinal wine you brew.

362
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:10,190
Is it true?

363
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:17,790
Do you see that mountain?

364
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:20,230
It's called Mount Haoyu.

365
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:22,390
It's extremely high,

366
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:24,930
covered in snow, and extremely cold.

367
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:26,870
A kind of spiritual flower panacea

368
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:28,390
grows in the mountain.

369
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,070
It takes 100 years to take root,

370
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:33,280
100 years for the branches to grow,

371
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:34,920
and 100 years of budding

372
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:36,850
for one Cold Red Heart Lotus

373
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:39,510
to bloom.

374
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:41,430
It can cure all diseases.

375
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:44,310
Originally, this spiritual flower

376
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:45,630
is a herb

377
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:46,830
in my wine recipe.

378
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:50,270
But it's too rare.

379
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:52,510
All these years,

380
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:53,590
I've only drunk

381
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,060
a jar of wine

382
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:57,320
that was brewed with it.

383
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:03,630
You're bragging.

384
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:04,910
There is no flower

385
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:06,570
that only blooms in 300 years.

386
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:08,230
Silly girl.

387
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,310
I'm the suave Yun Zhongzi.

388
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:11,870
Would I lie to you?

389
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:13,390
How'd I know what is in the medicinal wine

390
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:14,230
you make?

391
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:15,750
You can say anything you want.

392
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:16,510
Unless...

393
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,800
Unless you take me to have a look.

394
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:24,750
Okay.

395
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:27,710
Since I'm free today,

396
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:29,190
I'll make sure

397
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,060
you're convinced.

398
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:55,400
See?

399
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:58,790
This is the Cold Red Heart Lotus.

400
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:02,140
Seeing is believing.

401
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:03,770
I didn't lie to you.

402
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:07,630
You can't touch it.

403
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:09,390
Okay.

404
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:10,430
You stay here

405
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:11,990
and enjoy looking at your flower.

406
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:12,910
I'll go find some herbs

407
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:14,390
nearby.

408
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:16,390
Don't wander around.

409
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:17,790
Don't worry, Yun Zhongzi.

410
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:19,450
I'll wait for you to come back.

411
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:27,350
The nectar of the Cold Red Heart Lotus

412
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:29,410
is called Red Blood Spiritual Syrup.

413
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:31,550
Yun Zhongzi said

414
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:34,020
it can only be harvested with blood.

415
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:16,670
Let's go. Stop looking.

416
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:17,510
Let's go back.

417
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:19,470
Bai Cai! Bai Cai?

418
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:21,230
Oh no.

419
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:22,990
Come with me down the mountain now!

420
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:23,790
If you die here,

421
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:25,510
I'll be in big trouble.

422
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:26,440
I'm not leaving.

423
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,610
My goodness.

424
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:29,630
This thing

425
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:31,230
only blooms once every 300 years.

426
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:32,000
Are you

427
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,190
going to wait here

428
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:34,230
until you die?

429
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:35,670
Before you freeze to death,

430
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:36,710
go down the mountain with me.

431
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:37,470
No.

432
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:39,290
Don't make it hard for me.

433
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:41,910
Bai Cai, be good.

434
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:44,030
You...

435
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:13,040
Gou. Gou. Gou.

436
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:14,310
Gou, you're awake.

437
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:15,220
Gou.

438
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,310
Bai Cai, what's wrong with you?

439
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:18,230
I'm fine.

440
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:19,270
What happened to you?

441
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:20,030
Gou.

442
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:21,820
Drink this now.

443
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:24,150
Drink it and you'll recover.

444
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:25,070
Trust me.

445
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,150
What is this?

446
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:27,310
While it's still fresh.

447
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:29,670
Drink it. Don't care about what it is.

448
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:32,670
Okay, calm down.

449
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:33,830
I'll drink it.

450
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:35,580
Drink it now.

451
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:49,270
Master, why did you do that?

452
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:50,490
You can't drink this.

453
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:53,460
My nectar...

454
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:54,970
My nectar...

455
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:57,110
Gou's Red Blood Spiritual Syrup...

456
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:00,180
Why did you do that?

457
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:02,230
What a cold aura.

458
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:08,110
Bai Cai!

459
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:11,240
Bai Cai!

460
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:12,470
Bai Cai!

461
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:17,830
Judging from her pulse,

462
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:20,120
besides the cold disease you mentioned,

463
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:23,060
there seems to be a kind of...

464
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:25,350
poison.

465
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:27,710
Poison?

466
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:30,310
Wasn't it a relapse of the cold disease?

467
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:31,670
It's her old ailment.

468
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:33,230
Why is there poison?

469
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:35,330
Let me examine her.

470
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:36,310
High Priest.

471
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:36,830
High Priest is here.

472
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:37,870
High Priest is here.

473
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:39,030
High Priest.

474
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:00,400
How is it?

475
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:14,180
She was poisoned indeed.

476
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:18,150
And it is Gui Mu's corpse poison.

477
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:25,030
Bai Cai used her blood as the enhancing ingredient

478
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:26,860
to make the Cold Red Heart Lotus bloom.

479
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:28,310
The Red Blood Spiritual Syrup

480
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:30,170
contains Gui Mu's corpse poison.

481
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,710
When I used the Assassination Butterflies just now,

482
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:33,640
I noticed an anomaly in the nectar,

483
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:35,170
so I discovered it by luck.

484
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:38,710
Although I don't know

485
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:39,670
what exactly the cold disease

486
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:40,870
that Bai Cai has is,

487
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,470
according to my speculation,

488
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:43,310
Gui Mu's corpse poison

489
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:45,310
is very similar to the cold disease.

490
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:47,090
It's hard to detect it normally.

491
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:48,310
And the corpse poison

492
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:49,790
has been latent

493
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:50,920
for quite a while.

494
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:52,970
Kid.

495
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:55,190
Last time in the mine,

496
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:57,270
Bai Cai had a relapse, right?

497
00:24:58,150 --> 00:24:58,990
Yes.

498
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:00,670
Her last relapse

499
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,400
was unusually dangerous.

500
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:04,430
Her entire body was ice-cold.

501
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,710
Her body kept exuding

502
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:07,870
ice-cold aura from the inside out.

503
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:10,310
It was only suppressed

504
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:11,990
after she took the magical medicine

505
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:13,630
you gave me.

506
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:19,510
That's strange.

507
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:21,400
How could this mortal girl

508
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:21,910
have such

509
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:23,310
a strange disease?

510
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:37,970
No.

511
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,720
This girl is not a mortal.

512
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:41,470
There is some divine spirit circulating

513
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:42,310
in her body.

514
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:44,710
It was sealed in for some reason

515
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:45,870
and has no way to break through.

516
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:48,600
That's why the body was attacked by the cold aura.

517
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:56,310
How is it, Old Man?

518
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:01,430
Gui Mu is so vicious.

519
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:03,370
How could he be so ruthless

520
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,130
to a young lady?

521
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:13,410
Old Man, Clan Leader Kong Que.

522
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:15,750
Since you're from Immortal Clan,

523
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:17,110
you must have a way to save Bai Cai,

524
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:17,820
right?

525
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:21,220
The corpse poison is dangerous. It invaded the heart.

526
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:23,750
The cold disease makes it even worse.

527
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:24,880
With the current

528
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,880
herbs and magic in Shenyin Village,

529
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:29,810
I'm afraid there's nothing we can do.

530
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:32,870
Is there

531
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:34,680
really no other way?

532
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:42,990
There's really no other way?

533
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:47,830
Don't look at me.

534
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:48,470
This one

535
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:49,510
almost killed herself in order to

536
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:50,190
get you

537
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:51,470
your medicine.

538
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:52,720
If I get you involved again,

539
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,020
I'll be in big trouble.

540
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:54,830
Yun Zhongzi.

541
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:55,670
You know

542
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:56,680
how to save Bai Cai,

543
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,350
right?

544
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:03,260
To save Bai Cai,

545
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:06,110
we have to find Qiongqi's horn in the Spiritual Mountain

546
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:07,390
outside the village.

547
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,810
Qiongqi's horn?

548
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:09,830
Qiongqi's horn?

549
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:10,740
That is dangerous.

550
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:10,990
That's right.

551
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:12,190
How is that possible?

552
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:13,030
Old Man.

553
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:15,230
What is Qiongqi's horn?

554
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:21,710
Kid.

555
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:26,170
Qiongqi is a beast of Spiritual Mountain.

556
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:28,070
It is said that its horns

557
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:30,200
can detoxify the body of all kinds of poison.

558
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,510
But Qiongqi is cunning, cruel,

559
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:33,740
and

560
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:35,310
great at hiding.

561
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:36,910
So with your cultivation,

562
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:38,310
it's impossible to get

563
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:40,190
its horn.

564
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:41,950
Besides,

565
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:43,270
without the lure of the Dragon Whale Incense,

566
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:44,670
it won't show up.

567
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:49,210
Dragon Whale Incense?

568
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:51,950
Why are you lighting an oil lamp

569
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:53,230
in broad daylight?

570
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:54,730
This is not an oil lamp.

571
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:56,610
This is the Dragon Whale Incense.

572
00:27:57,390 --> 00:27:58,190
Master.

573
00:27:58,340 --> 00:27:59,310
When you contacted

574
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:00,230
Old Man,

575
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:03,160
you used the Dragon Whale Incense, right?

576
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:07,170
Everyone in the village has a Dragon Whale Incense.

577
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:09,900
There's only one Dragon Whale Incense in a lifetime

578
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,580
for secret contact.

579
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:14,690
Besides, it involves the safety of the clan.

580
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,560
It has to be used with caution.

581
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:18,650
According to our rules,

582
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:22,000
we never lend the Dragon Whale Incense to outsiders.

583
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,110
Kid.

584
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:25,630
Let us

585
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:27,030
think of other ways.

586
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:35,990
Master.

587
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,120
Yun Zhongzi.

588
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:06,710
Copy Shenyin Village's rules

589
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:07,670
a hundred times

590
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:09,080
and submit it tomorrow.

591
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:11,470
Copying the village rules at my age?

592
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:12,230
Clan Leader...

593
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:14,090
Don't talk too much in the future.

594
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:15,430
Elders.

595
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:18,740
It's nearly impossible to survive an encounter with Qiongqi.

596
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:20,830
I'm sure you all know that.

597
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:23,910
For the safety of Gou

598
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:25,470
and everyone

599
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:26,750
in Shenyin Clan,

600
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:28,670
let me repeat.

601
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:30,570
Shenyin Clan has an ironclad rule

602
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:34,310
against lending the Dragon Whale Incense to outsiders.

603
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:35,670
Anyone who violates it

604
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,450
will be severely punished.

605
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:39,080
Everyone, dismiss.

606
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:59,050
Greetings, High Priest. I'm Gui Mu.

607
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:02,570
Gui Mu?

608
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:06,270
Aren't you recuperating in the mortal realm?

609
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:08,130
You lost to a mortal

610
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:10,120
and humiliated the Immortal Clan.

611
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:13,600
Why did you come to the Immortal Realm?

612
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:16,780
I...

613
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:20,690
In my journey to Northern Mountain Mine,

614
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:21,760
I met

615
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,940
an unexpected acquaintance.

616
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:29,300
Your father,

617
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:31,710
Fu Xi.

618
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:36,670
Fu Xi?

619
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,250
Yes.

620
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,800
He went to Northern Mountain Mine this time

621
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:43,420
to save

622
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:45,020
a human slave.

623
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:46,990
It seems this slave

624
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:49,850
is very important to Fu Xi.

625
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:50,990
Otherwise,

626
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:54,670
the inconspicuous Shenyin Clan members

627
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:56,890
wouldn't dare show up rashly.

628
00:30:57,870 --> 00:30:59,830
Where is Fu Xi now?

629
00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:02,320
I'm still investigating.

630
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:04,890
In that case,

631
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:07,780
report to me when you've found him.

632
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:10,050
All right, you may leave.

633
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:13,590
You should know your place in the future.

634
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:20,830
Anything else?

635
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:26,400
I'm stupid.

636
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:30,220
There's something I don't understand.

637
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:37,080
Why does Hei Long

638
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:41,610
want to find a crystal?

639
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,390
How dare you

640
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:48,460
snoop on Hei Long?

641
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:51,950
The crystal

642
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,500
has nothing to do with you.

643
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,720
I just heard that

644
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:58,750
Hei Long is looking for

645
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:01,370
a crystal with ancient divine power.

646
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:04,380
Since I've stayed in the mortal world for a long time,

647
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,590
maybe

648
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:08,500
I can dedicate myself to it.

649
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,670
Gui Mu.

650
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,350
If you hadn't failed your task

651
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:20,550
at the Northern Mountain Mine,

652
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:23,030
they wouldn't have escaped.

653
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:26,130
Tell me,

654
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,680
how should I punish you?

655
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:32,090
I deserve to die!

656
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:35,110
High Priest, please spare my life!

657
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:38,810
I will make up for my mistake

658
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:40,890
and catch all those

659
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:43,070
who've escaped!

660
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:45,540
Don't let me down.

661
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:17,160
Father.

662
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:24,800
Long time no see.

663
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:00,190
Who exactly

664
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:02,550
wants to kill Wu Geng?

665
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,920
High Priest, what's on your mind?

666
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,150
Lan.

667
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:21,310
When I was meditating,

668
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,110
I saw

669
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:24,949
an ominous scene in an illusion.

670
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:29,190
Wu Geng was attacked by a woman...

671
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,929
and his life was in danger.

672
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:35,699
Who was that woman?

673
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:38,510
In the illusion,

674
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:40,270
I couldn't see her face.

675
00:34:41,469 --> 00:34:42,190
But Wu Geng

676
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:43,630
didn't fight back

677
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:45,639
when she attacked him.

678
00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:48,030
So I guess

679
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:50,030
it's someone who is close to him

680
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:51,659
and trusted by him.

681
00:34:53,449 --> 00:34:54,429
But no one

682
00:34:54,429 --> 00:34:55,699
other than you and I

683
00:34:56,610 --> 00:34:57,880
knows

684
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:00,070
Wu Geng's real identity.

685
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:02,230
Looks like this tribulation

686
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:05,110
is inevitable.

687
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,800
Bai Cai, why are you up?

688
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:26,980
Gou.

689
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,560
The Cold Red Heart Lotus' nectar...

690
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:30,710
Even...

691
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:33,200
even if you have a sip...

692
00:35:34,370 --> 00:35:35,560
Who said I didn't?

693
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:37,220
I drank it all.

694
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:39,580
Old Man

695
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,680
used his spell to gather

696
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,050
all the spilled nectar.

697
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:44,830
I drank it all at once.

698
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:46,470
I've never drunk anything

699
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:47,630
this delicious.

700
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:49,230
Look.

701
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,070
I'm fully recovered.

702
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:52,820
Thank you, Bai Cai.

703
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:55,990
You...

704
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:59,150
You really drank it? You aren't lying to me?

705
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:02,790
That's great.

706
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:06,080
So,

707
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:08,030
you have to get well soon.

708
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:10,470
Clan Leader Kong Que and Old Man

709
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:11,270
said

710
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:13,230
you had a relapse of the cold disease.

711
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:14,670
Because you caught a cold,

712
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:16,130
it's a little more severe.

713
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:17,470
When you're treated

714
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:18,270
with the herbs and spells

715
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:19,470
of Shenyin Village,

716
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:21,070
you'll recover soon.

717
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:27,110
Gou, I'm too tired.

718
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:28,830
I want to sleep.

719
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:31,230
Okay.

720
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:32,950
Here.

721
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:08,950
Dragon Whale Incense?

722
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:20,080
Thank you, friend.

723
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:22,550
When I get Qiongqi's horn,

724
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,940
I'll come and thank you.

725
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:51,500
Qiongqi.

726
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,540
The Dragon Whale Incense is here.

727
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,260
Come and get it if you dare.

728
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:04,630
I heard you like eating humans.

729
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:06,560
Now the incense has been lit.

730
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,940
I'm here too.

731
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:08,980
Come out now!

732
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:42,230
What big horns!

733
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:44,750
If I just take a small piece of it,

734
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:46,790
I doubt it'd be harmed.

735
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:51,040
Why don't we discuss first?

736
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:53,120
Give me a small piece of your horns,

737
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,680
and I'll give you the Dragon Whale Incense.

738
00:38:57,890 --> 00:38:59,220
I don't want to hurt you.

739
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:10,790
Bai Cai!

740
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:12,350
Bai Cai, what's wrong with you?

741
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:13,350
What should we do?

742
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:15,070
Go find the clan leader now!

743
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:15,630
Okay.

744
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:17,270
Bai Cai!

745
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:19,310
Don't scare me, Bai Cai!

746
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:45,090
Clan Leader!

747
00:40:46,830 --> 00:40:49,650
Clan Leader, Bai Cai...

748
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:52,280
Bai Cai is such a good person.

749
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:53,990
She can't die like this.

750
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,550
Clan Leader.

751
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:59,830
Can we buy some medicine to save her?

752
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:00,790
It's useless.

753
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,630
Bai Cai's disease

754
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:04,920
can't be cured by ordinary herbs.

755
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:07,490
Bai Cai.

756
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:10,190
Bai Cai, you have to hang in there.

757
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:27,520
Brat.

758
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:29,550
You deserve to die today.
