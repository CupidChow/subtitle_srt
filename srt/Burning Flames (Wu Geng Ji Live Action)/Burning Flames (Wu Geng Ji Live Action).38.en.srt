[Episode 38]

4
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:40,500
Let's put an end to this!

5
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,460
You can't stop me.

6
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,510
Only those with strong minds

7
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,100
can be detached from the mundane world.

8
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:25,230
You've not only defeated me,

9
00:02:25,829 --> 00:02:27,270
but also relieved me

10
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:30,520
of the Evil Chan personality that bothered me for centuries.

11
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,070
You've purged my heart

12
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,750
of its darkest part.

13
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,090
A human of your kind

14
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,920
is rarely seen.

15
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:40,430
Between the two of us,

16
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:43,470
you're the more strong-minded one.

17
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,310
I won't try to stop you.

18
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:50,710
You should go.

19
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:26,910
May all the grievances and feuds

20
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:29,510
vanish into thin air.

21
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,150
Zhen Chan Great Sage's divine power has disappeared!

22
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,079
Their divine energy's going away!

23
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:58,620
Guys!

24
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:00,550
This is an opportunity for us!

25
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:02,430
Let's head to the Immortal Realm!

26
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,780
We won!

27
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,690
Gou, listen.

28
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:19,510
Zhen Chan Great Sage

29
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:22,110
has lost his Immortality-Realm divine power?

30
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,770
How can it be true?

31
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,030
It looks like Uncle Ziyu

32
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:35,960
has defeated Zhen Chan Great Sage.

33
00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:37,890
We should keep up with his pace!

34
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:53,950
It's impossible.

35
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,930
It's impossible.

36
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:03,030
Your crooked witchcraft

37
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:05,090
has taken so many innocent lives.

38
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:07,310
The power brought by it

39
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:09,630
won't make you the ultimate winner.

40
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:13,070
Grandpa always missed you.

41
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:15,200
He even asked me to spare your life.

42
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:18,430
But all you want is to be Hei Long's aide.

43
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:20,550
You've even gone as far as to use evil sorcery.

44
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:21,790
So what?

45
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:25,130
As long as I become strong enough,

46
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:29,310
I'll be a top immortal forever.

47
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:32,909
Everything else

48
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,210
doesn't matter.

49
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:11,470
Geng,

50
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:13,930
if possible,

51
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,070
help her.

52
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:24,030
Gou, are you okay?

53
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:29,480
Let's get back to the army,

54
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,650
and set out to find Hei Long.

55
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:32,540
Okay.

56
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:40,830
We won!

57
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:41,670
We won!

58
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:44,110
-We won!
-We won!

59
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:45,830
We won!

60
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:46,510
How are you?

61
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:48,870
Grand Marshal, we won!

62
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:53,560
-Great!
-We won!
-It's a victory!

63
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:57,740
-We won!
-We won!
-We won!

64
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:03,340
It's a triumph!

65
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:05,830
We're the winners! We won!

66
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:13,550
It's a victory!

67
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:14,410
Grand Marshal,

68
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,110
next,

69
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:16,190
shall we proceed with the winning streak,

70
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:18,030
and march towards the Crystal Mountain?

71
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:20,380
We won! We won!

72
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:24,830
Let the soldiers rest and heal

73
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:26,070
before going to the Crystal Mountain.

74
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:26,870
Yes.

75
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,990
It's a triumph! We won!

76
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:31,890
Everyone, take a rest right here.

77
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:40,930
Qiongxiong Ji'e, where are you going?

78
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:42,390
I'll deal with the real business!

79
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:43,390
Nitian Erxing,

80
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:44,940
save your demonic power.

81
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:47,180
I'll probe the way ahead of us!

82
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:06,550
You insisted on having a combat.

83
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:07,510
Good for us.

84
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,390
Now we've reached the point of no return.

85
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:10,390
This ending

86
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:12,510
is much better than I thought.

87
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:13,150
Just now,

88
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:14,940
the moment I left the world,

89
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,710
I had a lot of grievances,

90
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,910
regrets and fear.

91
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:20,990
But when I set foot in this place,

92
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:23,030
all those feelings went away.

93
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:25,150
Maybe this is actually

94
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:26,390
a good ending.

95
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:28,320
If there's still a chance,

96
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,470
I'd like to take you to the mortal realm.

97
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:32,030
You'll love that place.

98
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:34,630
There's no chance anymore, is there?

99
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:57,510
The inside of the Tomb of Heaven

100
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:58,970
actually looks like this.

101
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:02,100
It turns out that all the excavated bloodstones

102
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,540
have been shipped here.

103
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:07,340
Is Hei Long

104
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:09,470
sleeping in such a place?

105
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,510
This is unbelievable.

106
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:17,240
It appears to be so desolate

107
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:19,070
as if no one has been here

108
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:20,670
for several thousand years.

109
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,830
Who is this?

110
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,900
I can't believe it's not Hei Long.

111
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,020
How can it not be Hei Long?

112
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,790
Does it mean

113
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:54,730
the high priest was wrong?

114
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,780
Who are you?

115
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:03,720
Why would you try to kill me?

116
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,030
I didn't mean to harm you.

117
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:07,650
I only wanted to...

118
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:34,380
You were targeting

119
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,720
Hei Long, right?

120
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:38,730
You planned to sneak into

121
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:41,760
the Tomb of Heaven and kill him in his sleep.

122
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:44,830
The Tomb of Heaven

123
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:48,120
is protected by the strongest barrier in the Immortal Realm.

124
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,160
No one in the three realms can peek at

125
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,470
the mysteries inside.

126
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:52,740
So,

127
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,630
you've made a fatal mistake.

128
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,150
I'm sorry.

129
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:59,310
I meant no harm to you!

130
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:00,190
I...

131
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:11,630
Now go away.

132
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:13,980
If Hei Long sees you,

133
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:15,680
he'll kill you.

134
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:36,410
The Tomb of Heaven...

135
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:38,840
This is bad!

136
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:41,230
Immortal King is in trouble.

137
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:42,440
Immortal King...

138
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:43,950
No! Immortal King...

139
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:45,670
I can't let anything happen to him!

140
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:47,710
Immortal King...

141
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:52,790
It’s Hei Long.

142
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:54,190
Hei Long has woken up.

143
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:56,290
This moment has finally come.

144
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:58,170
It is high time to end

145
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:01,040
all the suffering of the three realms.

146
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:10,440
It didn't occur to me that we could meet again.

147
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:11,800
You've woken up?

148
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:14,170
I'm sorry

149
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:16,840
to have kept you waiting.

150
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:18,840
I've promised

151
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:22,110
to wake you up

152
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:23,440
and let you see me again.

153
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:26,070
As you know,

154
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:27,570
I never break my promises.

155
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:29,270
I know.

156
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,260
I attacked the wrong person.

157
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:49,470
The person I injured

158
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:52,060
is Hei Long's beloved woman.

159
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,260
It's you who stabbed Bai Long.

160
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:13,670
Who are you?

161
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:34,240
Hei Long,

162
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:35,390
today I'm here

163
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,440
to take your life!

164
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:24,840
It's Lan.

165
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:26,770
Why is she here?

166
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:28,120
Lan?

167
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:29,910
Lan?

168
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:47,770
I can feel that her divine spirit

169
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:48,830
is breaking apart.

170
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:50,620
The divine power I've transferred to her

171
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:51,860
isn't working at all.

172
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:54,450
Let me give it a try.

173
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:23,710
Gou,

174
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,910
Lan's injury is so serious

175
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:27,109
that my Crystal Glory

176
00:17:27,109 --> 00:17:28,240
can barely heal her.

177
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:48,110
Lan?

178
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:53,310
Lan, you finally woke up.

179
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:58,390
Wu Geng,

180
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:01,470
you're still alive.

181
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:04,630
This is great.

182
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:06,190
Lan,

183
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:09,030
my Crystal Glory can't help you.

184
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:10,670
I'm sorry.

185
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:16,470
I'm beyond cure.

186
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:20,540
I was injured by Hei Long's divine power.

187
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:22,550
In this world,

188
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:25,310
no one can save my life.

189
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:29,990
Bai Cai,

190
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:31,860
thank you.

191
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,270
In fact,

192
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:39,750
I didn't like you at first,

193
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:41,830
because I always thought

194
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:44,200
you would be a burden to Wu Geng.

195
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:47,310
But then I realized

196
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:50,230
you were a wonderful girl.

197
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,260
I just

198
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:55,590
didn't know

199
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:57,910
how to get along with you.

200
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:04,310
Lan,

201
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:06,230
hang in there.

202
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:07,070
Clan Leader Kong Que

203
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:08,270
will arrive soon.

204
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,710
Wu Geng,

205
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:19,550
for the whole time, my biggest wish

206
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:24,930
is for you to be safe and sound.

207
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:29,650
It's a pity that in the end,

208
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:32,110
you'll have to fight Hei Long.

209
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:35,110
His divine power

210
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:37,550
is truly terrifying.

211
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:42,830
Countless amazing combatants who challenged him

212
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:43,910
all ended up

213
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,270
being killed by him.

214
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:51,950
But...

215
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:57,710
I'd hate to see you get in danger.

216
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:15,070
Lan,

217
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,030
I will defeat Hei Long,

218
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:21,890
and achieve your and Grandpa's common aspiration.

219
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:27,750
I believe you.

220
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:30,910
From now on,

221
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:37,160
you won't need my protection anymore.

222
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:41,870
You'll always be my master.

223
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:44,710
I still need you to teach me,

224
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:46,190
Lan.

225
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:50,960
Wu Geng,

226
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:53,750
actually,

227
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:55,510
in Shenyin Village,

228
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:57,670
during the days we spent together,

229
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:00,230
I found

230
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:03,990
that I was developing an affection for you,

231
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:08,310
but I couldn't tell you that,

232
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:11,070
because

233
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:13,120
I hadn't avenged my family

234
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:16,040
and compatriots.

235
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,750
Plus,

236
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:21,160
you were already with Bai Cai at that time.

237
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:24,940
Therefore,

238
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:30,070
I had to restrain my passion.

239
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:42,310
Wu Geng,

240
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:53,900
don't feel sorry for me.

241
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:57,130
My life is full of burdens.

242
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,490
I found it hard to continue it long ago.

243
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:03,390
Death,

244
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:06,270
for me,

245
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:10,600
is a relief.

246
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:12,870
No, Lan.

247
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:15,110
When I defeat Hei Long,

248
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:16,790
your life

249
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:17,850
will be forever

250
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:19,010
free of burdens.

251
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:25,550
Wu Geng,

252
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:27,950
promise me

253
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:31,320
you'll take good care of yourself,

254
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,900
and come back alive.

255
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,330
Wherever I will be,

256
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:42,960
I'll protect you

257
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:45,580
and pray for you

258
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:47,660
in my own way.

259
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:50,550
Wu Geng,

260
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:54,960
thank you.

261
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:09,950
Lan,

262
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,190
farewell.

263
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:33,440
About the mission Lan hoped I could complete,

264
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:34,770
now

265
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:36,650
it's time to do it.

266
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:57,160
Hei Long,

267
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:00,910
give me some time.

268
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,110
I'd like to know

269
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:11,620
what happened in the three realms

270
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,770
in the past 100 thousand years.

271
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:22,030
Immortal King! Immortal King!

272
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:23,470
Immortal King, I pray for your safety!

273
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:24,330
Immortal King!

274
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:30,110
W-Who is that?

275
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:32,870
What is Immortal King doing?

276
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:43,030
In retrospect, in the past 100 thousand years,

277
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:47,450
there were many changes in the three realms.

278
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:49,670
I didn't expect you

279
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:53,110
to be foolishly

280
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:56,830
spending

281
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:58,470
100 thousand years

282
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:03,140
digging up all the bloodstones in the world

283
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:06,200
just to bring me back to life.

284
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,450
As long as I could see you again,

285
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:14,290
I wouldn't mind waiting 100 thousand years.

286
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,800
Even if it would cost me a million years,

287
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,700
or even ten million years,

288
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:22,310
nothing could stop me.

289
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:25,950
I know

290
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:29,030
you would honor

291
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:30,690
every promise you've made me.

292
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,040
But in order to get bloodstones,

293
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:35,270
countless tragedies have been created

294
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:36,870
in the three realms.

295
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:39,490
I'm feeling so guilty.

296
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,620
All the creatures in the three realms

297
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,390
are just uncivilized servants.

298
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,010
Their lives

299
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:53,630
are worthless.

300
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:00,590
Immortal King,

301
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:05,950
it turns out that your ultimate purpose

302
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,050
of exhausting bloodstones

303
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,840
is to revive

304
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:14,720
the woman you love.

305
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:17,520
Xinyue Kui,

306
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,290
I didn't summon you.

307
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:25,260
You've spent most of your time

308
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:28,100
in the Tomb of Heaven

309
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,490
not because of cultivation,

310
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:33,440
but because you want to be with her.

311
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:38,510
You've dedicated 100 thousand years

312
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:39,780
to enslave the human race

313
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:43,180
and to make them exploit bloodstones non-stop,

314
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:46,230
just because you want to revive her.

315
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:54,390
Everything you've done is for her.

316
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:58,220
Did you...

317
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:01,350
Did you create

318
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:02,670
new immortals like me

319
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:03,790
also because

320
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,540
of her?

321
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:10,440
If I hadn't created you,

322
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:12,990
who else would supervise

323
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:15,320
the slaves as they dug up bloodstones, me?

324
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:22,950
In these 100 thousand years,

325
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:27,470
do immortals and humans

326
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:30,670
have no difference in your eyes?

327
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:33,980
In this world,

328
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:37,490
except for my beloved one,

329
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:40,170
all living souls mean

330
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,190
nothing to me.

331
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:46,670
They're just the same.

332
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:59,150
What's the point of everything I've done?

333
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:04,260
I've spared no effort to assist you

334
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:07,560
in consolidating the power of the Immortal Clan.

335
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,670
But you...

336
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:10,930
You'd rather sleep in the Tomb of Heaven

337
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:12,490
with her.

338
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:15,890
Have you ever thought about the Immortal Clan?

339
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:17,410
You're being rude!

340
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:20,650
Leave right now!

341
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:32,150
I'm so silly!

342
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:36,450
This is my comeuppance.

343
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:39,250
I sacrificed my father's life

344
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:40,910
and caused my sister's death.

345
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:43,910
To do my job well,

346
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:47,800
I've even risked my life

347
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:50,430
to learn forbidden witchcraft.

348
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:54,510
I've put my life at stake numerous times.

349
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:55,510
In fact...

350
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:57,230
As it turns out,

351
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:00,750
all I've done is in vain!

352
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:06,980
At the end of the day, in your eyes,

353
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:10,130
immortals are no different than humans.

354
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:14,110
You're just using us as slaves

355
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:16,710
in the course of reviving her!

356
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:33,030
No.

357
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:35,820
No.

358
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:40,030
If she dies,

359
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:42,590
the king of immortals will return

360
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:44,720
to rule the three realms again, right?

361
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:46,010
Yeah.

362
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:48,040
She shouldn't be alive.

363
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:49,600
She must die.

364
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:51,150
I'll kill her!

365
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:31,510
Sister, come after me!

366
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:32,790
I'm catching up with you!

00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:34,150

00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:19,150
I'm sorry, Sister.

384
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:19,590
♫Look, the heavy rain is approaching♫

385
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:23,330
♫We can't stop it from flooding the city♫

386
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:21,910
It's my fault

387
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,700
that you lost your loved one,

388
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:26,030
♫Like the late realization of obsession♫

389
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:26,190
and were separated from your child.

390
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,210
♫The wet tears♫

391
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:31,170
♫Slowly, I come to my senses♫

392
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:34,950
♫I want to go crazy with you♫

393
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:36,510
I'm sorry, Wu Geng.

394
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:38,800
♫Remove our armor and bathe in the light of the blades♫

395
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,470
I racked my brains

396
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:41,110
♫When we're seriously injured, we shall retreat♫

397
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:41,950
to stop you from fighting against the immortals.

398
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:46,380
♫And confine ourselves to my city forever♫

399
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:43,670
In the end,

400
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:46,110
I became a joke.

401
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:50,410
If I could have a chance to start over,

402
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:52,170
I will

403
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:55,550
absolutely make a different choice,

404
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,510
and never fall in love

405
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:01,370
with the wrong man.

406
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:12,970
She made ridiculous remarks.

407
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:14,720
She deserved death.

408
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:28,250
Hei Long!

409
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:30,530
My fellow men and women

410
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:32,710
suffer from cold and hunger every day.

411
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:34,750
These heinous slaves!

412
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:37,030
But you're here on your cozy throne!

413
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:37,670
Today, I'll make you...

414
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:38,870
As I said,

415
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:42,270
the outside world is too noisy.

416
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:44,590
Shut up!

417
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:56,150
Deadly Wringer!

418
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:16,830
G-Good game!

419
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:39,150
Strengthen, now!

420
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:42,510
Daddy,

421
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:45,480
what's on the other side of the stone dome?

422
00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:47,389
The sun!

423
00:34:47,469 --> 00:34:48,830
What is it?

424
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:50,590
I don't know.

425
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:51,389
Daddy

426
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:53,350
heard it from your grandpa.

427
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:55,070
Do you want to know

428
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:56,350
what the sun is?

429
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:58,710
Daddy knows how to help you

430
00:34:58,710 --> 00:34:59,550
understand what the sun is.

431
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:00,350
How?

432
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:02,570
Daddy, tell me! Tell me!

433
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:06,410
Once we defeat the Immortal Clan,

434
00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:08,790
we can move back onto the ground.

435
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:10,830
Extreme Realm!

436
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:13,790
When that happens,

437
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:16,400
we'll know what the sun is.

438
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:20,030
But the Immortal Clan is formidable.

439
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:22,240
I don't want to see you get hurt, Daddy.

440
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:24,510
Even if I have to die,

441
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:27,130
Ferocious Mace!

442
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:29,550
I'll by all means bring you

443
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:30,790
whatever you like.

444
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:37,550
Daddy,

445
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:39,670
I want to see the sun with you.

446
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:42,110
We'll see the sun!

447
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:43,710
Let's watch the sun together!

448
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:45,510
We'll go watch the sun together!

449
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:12,110
Qiongxiong Ji'e!

450
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:14,470
Wu Geng,

451
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:16,670
I couldn't even

452
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:18,630
catch a look at Hei Long's face

453
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:20,910
before I was beaten down.

454
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:24,430
I've killed many people in my life,

455
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:28,190
but I've never begged anyone.

456
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:32,790
Now I implore you

457
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:34,550
to take Little Dragonfly

458
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:41,390
to see the sun in the mortal realm.

459
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:46,870
Okay. You have my word.

460
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:13,270
Hei Long!

461
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:14,910
Today,

462
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:16,570
on behalf of the three realms,

463
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:18,150
I'm declaring war on you!

464
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:23,110
I'll kill all of them,

465
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:28,400
so they can't disturb us anymore.

466
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:04,550
Who are you?

467
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:07,550
My father was the king of the human race.

468
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:10,110
My mother was a priest in the Immortal Clan.

469
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:10,910
I

470
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:13,790
am the prince of Xin State, Wu Geng.

471
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:17,350
The king of the human race...

472
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:20,990
He was just

473
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:22,750
one of my slaves.

474
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:23,950
Hei Long,

475
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:27,510
you've slept in the Crystal Mountain for a long time.

476
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:29,110
You have no idea

477
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:31,040
what the outside world has become.

478
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:33,870
Everyone in the three realms hates you.

479
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:35,320
Your existence

480
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:36,710
is a disaster

481
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:37,990
for the whole world.

482
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:40,140
Only when you disappear

483
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:43,190
will there be hope in the new world.

484
00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:48,790
I remember years ago,

485
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:52,390
a slave was also in over his head.

486
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:54,120
He came to challenge me,

487
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:58,710
and I destroyed his kingdom.

488
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:03,110
Now that I see it,

489
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:05,110
you do have

490
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:06,950
some resemblance to him.

491
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:44,910
Hei Long,

492
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,870
is it all you've got?

493
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,950
You do surprise me,

494
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,510
but that's all there's to it.

495
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:17,110
The Crystal Glory?

496
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:29,370
Grand Marshal.

497
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:31,110
Ms. Bai Cai, are you okay?

498
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:31,670
I'm fine.

499
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:32,760
I'm holding up well.

500
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,230
You should go see Gou.

501
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:44,310
Are you okay?

502
00:40:52,610 --> 00:40:53,710
Never been better.

503
00:40:58,390 --> 00:40:59,790
Who are you?

504
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:02,350
I'm the grand marshal of the Demon Clan.

505
00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:03,750
My name is Nitian Erxing.

506
00:41:04,430 --> 00:41:06,090
It's been 100 thousand years.

507
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:07,870
The Demon Clan

508
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:08,870
has finally

509
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:10,310
left the gloomy

510
00:41:10,310 --> 00:41:11,350
nether region.

511
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:14,550
Today,

512
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:16,950
let me end the feuds once and for all!
