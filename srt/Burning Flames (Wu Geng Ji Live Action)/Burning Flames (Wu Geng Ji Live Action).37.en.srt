Nine Voids Blood Lotus Pool!

6
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:49,380
You want to trap me with this pool of stagnant water?

7
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:26,410
You fool.

8
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:28,170
The more you move,

9
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,160
the faster your body sinks.

10
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,030
You will be completely submerged

11
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:35,510
before you get to me.

12
00:03:37,829 --> 00:03:38,630
Really?

13
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:40,440
I don't think so.

14
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:03,190
How naive.

15
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:35,510
I got it.

16
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:36,960
It's your lifeline.

17
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,900
Who is the fool here?

18
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:45,620
You actually tied your life

19
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,390
to a monster like this?

20
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:56,150
No... This is impossible.

21
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:58,390
How can a human

22
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:02,100
have this kind of wisdom?

23
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:04,390
How can a human

24
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:06,210
have such divine power

25
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:12,200
to break my Blood Lotus?

26
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:13,710
I told you

27
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,340
that the Immortal Clan

28
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,690
will be destroyed by your arrogance

29
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:17,620
sooner or later.

30
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:19,990
You made me lose my power.

31

Now I've escaped from death.

32
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:24,350
No matter how powerful the enemy is,

33
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:25,950
they won't be able to stop me.

34

38
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:39,390
It's only effective against Immortals.

39
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:42,740
A sword practiced only for killing Immortals?

40
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:43,750
That's right.

41
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:47,150
After the battle in the Xin capital failed,

42
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:49,560
I was trapped in King's City for years.

43
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:50,990
I pondered about

44
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,500
a technique to counter divine power.

45
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,360
If I reused an old method

46
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:57,550
to practice the sword,

47
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:58,830
I would still fail.

48
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:00,590
So,

49
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:05,910
I solidified it.

00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:46,130
You think that human beings are born stupid

55

56
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:49,500

that you're wrong!

58
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,710

00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:18,940
try to murder an Immortal!

60
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,740
I worked to edify you,

61
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,740
but you're stupid and stubborn!

62
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:24,600
You're hopeless!

63
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,110
You never learn.

64
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,630
You're beyond idiotic.

65
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:36,520
You forced me to attack.

How did he become like this?

67

00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:57,750
I've been thinking about the truth all my life.

Why do all beings have to experience

71
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:03,440
life, death, and reincarnation?

72
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:08,230
I realized the way.

73
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:11,990

You have your own way.

77
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,020
Why don't you allow other ways

78
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,450
to exist in the world?

79
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:25,320
I don't care about your way.

80

Cruelty and bloodshed

Shallow, stubborn,

91
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:06,060
and ignorant human.

92
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:08,290
You have committed

an unforgivable crime,

94
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:13,200
so you must be punished.

95
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:15,290
Is the so-called unforgivable crime

96
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:19,970
not being willing to submit to you?

97
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:25,510
Yes.

Oh no!

If I can't defeat him quickly,

109
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:07,120
The allied army will suffer even greater losses.

110

00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,550
Are you okay?

113

Yes.

114
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,740
The Grand Marshal's strength

115
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,190
is for killing Hei Long.

116
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:05,560
You don't deserve to be his opponents.

117
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:53,430
My brother,

118
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:55,140
I won't

120
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:00,780
I will keep moving forward.

121

We will meet again

123
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,280
Who's there?

124
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,310
You won't get anything

125
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:47,910
from me.

126
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:50,910
Either kill me

127
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:53,830
or get lost.

128
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:56,750
Grandpa.

130
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:07,430
Geng, is that you?

131
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:10,830
Geng.

132
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:12,620
Where are you?

133
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:19,630
Grandpa,

134
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:21,190
it's me.

135
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:23,470
Bai Cai is here too.

136
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:25,470
Good.

137
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:27,320
Good.

138
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,110

You're finally here.

You're finally here.

141
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:40,520
Great.

142
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:44,790
Since you came to the World's End,

143
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:46,870
it means that the anti-immortal army

144
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:48,730
has breached the Immortal Realm.

145
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:51,350
Good.

146
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,190
You've become

147
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:55,550
so strong now.

148
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,940
I can feel

149
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:59,030
a strong force

150
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:01,270
in your body.

151
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:06,240
These Immortal Clan bastards.

152
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:09,350
Grandpa, I will break the boulder

153
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:10,030
and save you.

154
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:10,750
No.

155
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:12,830
Geng,

156
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:16,070
it's useless.

157
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:17,990
I'm sealed here.

158
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:20,430
My body and this stone

159
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:22,470
have already become one.

160
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:24,830
Child, it can't be reversed

161
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,910
even if Hei Long is here.

162
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:33,830
Don't waste your energy.

163
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:37,260
I don't have much time left.

164
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:38,550
Child,

165
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:48,500
I've suffered

166
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:50,970
every day here.

167
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:53,470
I persisted for this long

168
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:56,910
because I've been waiting

169
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,010
to see you.

170
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:03,460
Now that you've grown up

171
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,910
and become stronger,

172
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:10,750
I can rest in peace.

173
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:16,190
Grandpa,

174
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:19,110
you are

175
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:22,270
my only family left in this world.

176
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:29,390
Silly child.

177
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:31,470
What are you talking about?

178
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:34,430
You still have family,

179
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:38,270
friends, and companions.

180
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:40,360
You still have people who love you.

181
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:43,150
I will just

182
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:44,670
keep an eye on you

183
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:46,910
in a different place.

184
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:52,070
Bai Cai.

185
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,670
Old Man.

186
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:57,990
Promise me

187
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:00,170
that in this life,

188
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:02,870
you will stand with him,

189
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:06,869
love him, and support him forever.

190
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,390
I promise you.

191
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:11,230
I will always be with him.

192
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,430
Good.

193
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:18,390
Although I can't see anymore,

194
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:20,579
I can still

195
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:21,950
clearly predict

196
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:23,829
your final victory.

197
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,930
Geng,

198
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,770
keep fighting bravely

199
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:32,830
toward your aspirations.

200
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:36,620
You're the grandson I'm the proudest of

201
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:40,030
and the son that your mother was proudest of.

202
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,950
You will definitely be

203
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:45,190
the pride of the three realms.

204
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:49,390
Grandpa,

205
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:51,270
don’t worry.

206
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:53,510
I will achieve it.

207
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:03,790
Geng.

208
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:06,910
Geng.

209
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:10,510
Now,

210
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:15,470
I can finally go to your mother

211
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,430
without regret.

212
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,790
But the one that I still

213
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,600
can't let go of in my heart

214
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:33,060
is my other daughter,

215
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:36,460
Xinyue Kui.

216
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:41,150
My Kui...

217
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,470
I never thought

218
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:45,390
she was a useless person.

219
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,770
It's all my fault as a father.

220
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,880
Back then, I didn't let her feel

221
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,820
that I loved her too.

222
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:54,940
It was my attitude

223
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:56,750
that pushed her further away

224
00:18:56,790 --> 00:19:00,230
until she went astray.

225
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:03,830
Geng,

226
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,190
promise me.

227
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,850
If possible,

228
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,760
save her.

229
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,720
Pull her back.

230
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:25,310
I will continue to watch you move forward.

231
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:27,950
In order for the tragedy of my generation

232
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:29,350
to no longer continue,

233
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:33,990
you must defeat Hei Long

234
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:37,510
and save the three realms.

235
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:06,500
Grandpa,

236
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:08,810
farewell.

237
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:37,110
The Tomb of Heaven...

238
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,130
Kill Hei Long.

239
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,710
High Priest,

240
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:46,710
don't worry.

241
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:49,670
I will definitely

242
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:51,030
fulfill your wish.

243
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,590
High Priest.

244
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:13,690
The High Priest...

245
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:16,260
The High Priest predicted long ago

246
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:17,660
that this day would come.

247
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:19,780
He has fulfilled

248
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:20,910
his mission.

249
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:29,190
There are too many injured people here.

250
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:30,070
Yun Zhongzi,

251
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,190
Yuan Yi and I

252
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:32,710
will take them back to Shenyin Village first.

253
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:34,840
You quickly go and meet up with Wu Geng.

254
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:36,910
Okay.

255
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:38,670
Yun Zhongzi,

256
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:41,220
you must be careful.

257
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:43,350
You and Clan Leader Kong Que

258
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:44,610
take the injured back.

259
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:46,030
I'm here.

260
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,130
What your grandpa wants to see the most

261
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:00,110
is not you being sad for him,

262
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:02,550
but you continuing forward.

263
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:05,950
Now,

264
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:08,480
we have another account

265
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:10,930
to settle with the Immortal Clan.

266
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:24,190
What a touching scene

267
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:25,480
about life and death.

268
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:27,710
Instead of being so sad,

269
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:29,710
why don't I

270
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:32,390
send you to see your grandpa now?

271
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:33,590
Xinyue Kui,

272
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,720
you're the one who killed Grandpa

273
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,850
with lowly methods.

274
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:38,470
How dare you come here?

275
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:39,580
So what?

276
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:42,690
He betrayed the Immortal Clan.

277
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:44,810
He deserved it.

278
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:46,550
And you...

279
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:48,330
Since you're here,

280
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,950
you should stay here forever

281
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:51,150
and keep him company.

282
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,390
Grandpa thought of you

283
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:55,590
before he died.

284
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:57,550
You don't deserve it at all.

285
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:59,190
Who cares about him?

286
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:03,230
All I care about is the Immortal Clan.

287
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:06,000
As long as the power stays with the Immortal Clan,

288
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,800
I'm willing to

289
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:09,860
sacrifice anything.

290
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,310
All these years,

291
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:14,150
I loyally guarded

292
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:16,010
everything in the Immortal Realm

293
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:18,230
to help the Immortal King

294
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:19,890
remove all of his obstacles.

295
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,490
This includes

296
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:23,660
you all.

297
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,480
You crazy woman.

298
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:26,970
Before, you tricked me to go to Shenyin Village

299
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:28,570
to kill the innocent villagers.

300
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:29,900
I almost killed Gou too.

301
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:31,210
Let's settle

302
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:32,460
everything today.

303
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:33,810
Bai Cai,

304
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:35,470
what you said

305
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,350
is very saddening.

306
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:38,910
Although

307
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:40,550
I don't want to kill you now,

308
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:41,750
it's time

309
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:43,470
to make you suffer.

310
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,460
The fog

311
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,160
seems to have a life of its own.

312
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:25,080
I can sense the resentment and unwillingness

313
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:25,790
of dying unjustly

314
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:26,990
in the dark fog.

315
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:28,350
Gou, be careful.

316
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:30,030
Wu Geng,

317
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:31,990
you should feel honoured.

318
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,630
This is an ancient curse

319
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:35,350
I prepared specially for you.

320
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:37,270
It has absorbed many lives

321
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:38,830
of the traitorous Immortals

322
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:40,680
who are trapped in the World's End.

323
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,590
It turned their resentment from their unwillingness to die

324
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:43,790
into a curse.

325
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:46,350
It will erode your life

326
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:47,910
bits by bits

327
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:50,790
until you die in pain.

328
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,520
Enjoy it.

329
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:29,980
Xinyue Kui,

330
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:41,460
I don't like war and killing.

331
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:42,870
But today,

332
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:46,250
since you all came to the Immortal Realm seeking death,

333
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:48,400
I don't mind letting you understand that

334
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,360
destroying your

335
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:50,950
ant-like lives

336
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:52,990
is not even considered as killing.

337
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:03,790
Gou!

338
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:09,220
Stop the pointless resistance.

339
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:10,710
Come with me.

340
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,790
The King of Immortals is waiting for you.

341
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:13,750
No way!

342
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:30,970
Even the air in my body

343
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,410
is being drained out little by little.

344
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,610
I can't breathe.

345
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:40,080
This is why

346
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,270
I stopped using

347
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:42,790
the Vacuum trick.

348
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,270
It will drain out the surrounding air

349
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:46,390
in an instant.

350
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,950
No one can combat in a vacuum

351
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,530
or even survive.

352
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:55,410
My body is about to explode.

353
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:57,820
The generals of the Immortal Realm will wipe you out,

354
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:59,660
just like killing ants.

355
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,960
This is the difference
in our power.

356
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:03,390
No.

357
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,180
We are far from over yet.

358
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:08,580
There is only one possible way

359
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:10,720
if you wish to end this war.

360
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:13,410
And that is for Hei Long to fall!

361
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:33,680
Is this guy

362
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,800
really indestructible?

363
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:53,150
Shi Xing, you're here.

364
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:55,540
Am I late, Wu Geng?

365
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:59,040
No, you're just in time.

366
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,780
Shi Xing.

367
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:02,790
As the son of the King of Immortals,

368
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:04,300
you betrayed the Immortal Clan

369
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:05,510
and killed your master Tian Kui

370
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:06,870
at Bai capital.

371
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:10,360
And you still have the nerve to return to Immortal Realm?

372
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:12,640
You killed the love of my life

373
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:13,540
and casted

374
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:15,150
the Seal of the Dead on me,

375
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:16,750
which made me reincarnate endlessly

376
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:17,870
in the torment

377
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:19,670
of being neither alive nor dead.

378
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:20,970
Wu Geng was the one

379
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:23,150
who fred me from this pain.

380
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:24,510
Now,

381
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,970
I will use all my life

382
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:29,770
to take revenge on trhe Immortal Clan

383
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:30,920
who brought me pain.

384
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:36,840
Wu Geng, go to the Crystal Mountain.

385
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:38,880
Your real enemy is there.

386
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:40,240
Leave this place to me.

387
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,010
Thank you, Shi Xing.

388
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:45,310
But before that,

389
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,700
I have one more thing to deal with.

390
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:09,390
Don't think that with the help of Shi Xing,

391
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:11,070
you can easily defeat him.

392
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:12,440
The King of Immortals.

393
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,590
will never be defeated.

394
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:15,670
Really?

395
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:17,540
Let's try then.

396
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:24,620
Shi Xing is here too.

397
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:26,850
Interesting.

398
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:31,480
This play is getting more and more exciting.

399
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:40,460
Is this the place?

400
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:42,570
We're finally here.

401
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,260
Stop right there.

402
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,880
So this is the new high priest.

403
00:30:54,170 --> 00:30:55,590
Then why isn't she holding onto

404
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:57,000
the bloodstone crystal?

405
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:00,140
Do you have something to report?

406
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:01,510
Yes.

407
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:02,410
Kneel down,

408
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,720
and tell me what you want to report.

409
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,550
I have to report in person.

410
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:10,630
Don't you know the rules?

411
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:11,750
All of the high priests

412
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:12,910
does it like this.

413
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:17,000
Unfortunately,

414
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:19,030
I'm not a high priest.

415
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:05,870
Lan,

416
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:07,630
I can only help you

417
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:09,470
till this stage.

418
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:11,520
Not even I

419
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:14,530
can view the situation in the tomb.

420
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:18,470
Don't let me down.

421
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,390
Seems like you, Shi Xing,

422
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:28,870
is planning to go all out.

423
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:31,510
I initially just wanted to

424
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:33,040
teach that fellow a lesson.

425
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:34,910
I don't want to be your enemy.

426
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,370
Since you want to have a serious fight,

427
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:39,580
today

428
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:42,290
will be a life-and-death situation for us.

429
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,930
I can feel

430
00:32:57,290 --> 00:32:59,190
his divine spirit burning.

431
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:02,760
As expected from the soul of the Undying Bird.

432
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:10,910
The old immortals' strength

433
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:12,670
are all terrifyingly strong.

434
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:13,840
However,

435
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:15,690
even if you have the help of

436
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:16,760
the Undying Bird's divine power,

437
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,280
you still can't defeat me.

438
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:31,740
As an old immortal who used to have formidable strength,

439
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:34,010
is that all you've got now?

440
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:59,640
You used all your divine power on attacking

441
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,770
and improved your destructive power.

442
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:03,230
But, it also exposed

443
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:04,510
a fatal weakness.

444
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:07,450
your ability to defend will plummet.

445
00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:16,590
My Vacuum

446
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,830
has entered your body.

447
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:29,230
Now is the time!

448
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:33,510
You did it on purpose!

449
00:34:34,409 --> 00:34:35,560
Your speed

450
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:37,250
is indeed unsurpassable.

451
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:39,460
But, I want to defeat you

452
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:40,710
in my own way.

453
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:53,860
What other tricks do you have?

454
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:55,750
Just use them all.

455
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,630
You still refuse to give up?

456
00:34:57,790 --> 00:34:58,580
Fine.

457
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:00,590
I'll grant your wish.

458
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:01,630
I'll show you

459
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:04,100
my Boundless Universe.

460
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:20,750
May you forever sleep in the depths of your sinful desires,

461
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,030
never to awaken.

462
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:28,220
You evil hindrance!

463
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,280
Is that all?

464
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,110
This is by no means a match

465
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:43,010
for me, Immortal-Killing Sword.

466
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,590
What am I doing?

467
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:07,950
Ziyu.

468
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:15,570
What's wrong?

469
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:18,020
You don't seem to recognise me.

470
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:20,470
Because everything here

471
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:21,670
is not true.

472
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:31,860
I am in the King of Immortal's spirits.

473
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:34,710
You and everything in this place

474
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,960
are all constructed by the divine power.

475
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:55,390
Wu Geng has grown up.

476
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:57,270
He is fulfilling

477
00:36:57,270 --> 00:36:59,200
what his brother left unfinished.

478
00:36:59,810 --> 00:37:00,880
He will definitely

479
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:03,170
not disappoint your expectations of him

480
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:20,040
The Boundless Universe

481
00:37:20,290 --> 00:37:21,870
can arouse the deepest obsession

482
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:23,280
of the human race.

483
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,390
No one from the human race

484
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:27,570
has ever escaped their desires.

485
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:31,190
You're clearly also a member of the human race.

486
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:35,740
How could you reach such a stage?

487
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:41,230
That's because

488
00:37:41,830 --> 00:37:43,690
you touched

489
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,320
the deepest part of my heart.

490
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:47,010
This memory

491
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:50,860
will always be clear and Profound to me.

492
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:53,150
You shouldn't have touched it.

493
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:54,210
Because it will

494
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,580
awaken and enrage me.

495
00:37:55,610 --> 00:37:57,920
Let's end it here!

496
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:17,430
Wu Geng,

497
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:19,910
I admire your courage.

498
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,920
But it's not that easy

499
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:23,150
to get even with me.

500
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:26,510
I am a high priest of the Immortal Clan.

501
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:28,190
High priest?

502
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:29,710
How did you

503
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:30,910
How did you become a high priest?

504
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:32,270
you know it best.

505
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:34,270
Along the journey,

506
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:36,350
if it weren't for Mother's protection

507
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:37,680
and Grandpa's teachings,

508
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,340
I wouldn't have come this far.

509
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:42,870
And yet, you're the one who killed them.

510
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:44,820
They were all so protective

511
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,170
and biased towards you.

512
00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:48,590
The more they cherish

513
00:38:48,970 --> 00:38:50,840
and want to protect something,

514
00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:53,230
the more I want to destroy it.

515
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:54,820
In fact, I'd like to see

516
00:38:55,310 --> 00:38:56,150
how they would look

517
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:57,990
if they knew

518
00:38:58,470 --> 00:39:00,320
you'd die in my hands.

519
00:39:00,890 --> 00:39:02,010
Unfortunately,

520
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:03,770
I can't witness that anymore.

521
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:06,510
Because they're all dead.

522
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:31,060
What is she doing?

523
00:39:31,090 --> 00:39:34,150
She's absorbing the divine power of the Spirit Eaters.

524
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,180
That's such a vicious spell

525
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:36,500
she's using.

526
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:37,070
Isn't she afraid of the backlash

527
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:38,700
from the power of the Spirit Eaters?

528
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:40,110
Gou, get started now.

529
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:41,910
When she gets stronger,

530
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:43,710
it'll be harder to deal with her.

531
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:47,110
No, it's too late.

532
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:05,590
Come on, Wu Geng.

533
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:07,790
I'll use your insignificant life

534
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:11,030
to unlock my new spell.

535
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:31,670
These demonic energies

536
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:32,910
have become irritated

537
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:34,640
under Xinyue Kui's influence.

538
00:40:58,390 --> 00:40:59,180
Gou,

539
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:00,870
These demonic energies have no physical form.

540
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:03,130
The Qi Cultivation Punch can't hit them.

541
00:41:06,770 --> 00:41:08,090
In this world,

542
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:12,910
only the Immortal Clan can rule the three realms.

543
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:17,230
And the Immortal Clan is the master of the human race.

544
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,970
It's precisely

545
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:20,460
the arrogant

546
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:21,560
and self-righteous attitude of the Immortal Clan,

547
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,360
treating life in the three realms

548
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,790
with contempt,

549
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:25,820
that has led to today's consequences.

550
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:27,100
No matter how strong Hei Long is,

551
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:27,920
how powerful the Immortal Clan is,

552
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,000
what can they do?

553
00:41:29,310 --> 00:41:30,590
Even if a person's power

554
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:32,310
is as small as a grain of sand,

555
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:33,960
as long as we unite,

556
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:35,980
we can still overwhelm mountains.

557
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:39,040
Sand will eventually turn into dust.

558
00:41:39,210 --> 00:41:41,740
How can it be compared with the Immortal Clan?

559
00:41:41,870 --> 00:41:43,870
The Immortal Clan is undefeatable.

560
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:45,780
My purpose

561
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:47,750
is to clear all obstacles

562
00:41:47,790 --> 00:41:48,940
of the Immortal Clan.
