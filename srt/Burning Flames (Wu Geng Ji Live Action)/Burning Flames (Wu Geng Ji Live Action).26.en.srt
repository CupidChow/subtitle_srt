[Episode 26]

4
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,740
Someone's coming.

5
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:46,560
Gou! Lan!

6
00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:48,580
Bai Cai?

7
00:01:49,789 --> 00:01:51,250
How does she know I'm here?

8
00:01:52,789 --> 00:01:53,950
Just in case,

9
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:55,640
I gave the contact butterfly you gave me

10
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,630
to Bai Cai.

11
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:57,310
She

12
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:59,440
followed the contact butterfly here.

13
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:17,170
What's wrong, Bai Cai?

14
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:19,590
Something happened to the kids.

15
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,360
My lian qi technique

16
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:47,270
can't cure the kids yet.

17
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:49,000
They ate too much

18
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,070
Eternal Fruit.

19
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:51,920
They're heavily poisoned.

20
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:56,350
Eternal Fruit.

21
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:58,680
I want to eat Eternal Fruit.

22
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:01,670
Biggie.

23
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:03,590
Bai Cai, please.

24
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,150
Give me Eternal Fruit.

25
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:06,910
This is exactly the same

26
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:07,350
as Bai King's situation.

27
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:08,270
Give me Eternal Fruit.

28
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:09,750
Give me Eternal Fruit.

29
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,290
Give me Eternal Fruit.

30
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:12,110
Please.

31
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:14,870
Gou, I feel so bad.

32
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,150
I want to eat...

33
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:18,070
I want to eat Eternal Fruit.

34
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:18,829
No.

35
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:20,350
You can't eat it anymore.

36
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:21,630
That thing

37
00:03:21,829 --> 00:03:23,270
made you like this.

38
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:28,230
Bai Cai, please.

39
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:30,070
Just give me one, okay?

40
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:31,390
Be good.

41
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:33,030
Be good. You'll be fine after a nap.

42
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:33,829
Okay?

43
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:35,990
Bai Cai, you've changed.

44
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:37,190
You don't love us

45
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,400
as much as you used to.

46
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:41,270
Gou, you've changed too.

47
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:43,310
You weren't like this in the past.

48
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:48,270
Be good. You'll be fine. You'll be fine.

49
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:49,470
Give me one.

50
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:52,150
Just one.

51
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,070
Give me one more.

52
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:55,470
Gou, you guys go out first.

53
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:56,910
Leave me and the kids alone for a while.

54
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:57,550
Please.

55
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:58,550
Give me one more.

56
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:00,470
Bai Cai, please.

57
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:01,990
Please.

58
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,360
Be good.

59
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:07,670
Please.

60
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:09,630
Give me one more.

61
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:14,190
It's okay. Be good.

62
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,590
I want to eat Eternal Fruit.

63
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,350
You'll be fine. Be good.

64
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:31,830
Bai Cai.

65
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:33,350
Go take a nap.

66
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:35,550
I'll guard the kids.

67
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,360
I want to go for a walk far away.

68
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,990
If something happens to the kids,

69
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:41,190
call me immediately.

70
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,830
You've used a lot of lian qi.

71
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:44,150
You should rest too.

72
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:48,470
You're going for a walk far away.

73
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:52,510
I'm afraid you'll be in danger.

74
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:57,380
You're afraid I'll think too much

75
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,640
when I'm alone, right?

76
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,270
Bai Cai.

77
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:03,350
You can tell me

78
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,630
everything.

79
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:06,550
Don't keep them to yourself.

80
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:10,670
I should be the one to say that to you.

81
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:15,150
Say that to me?

82
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:19,550
Don't worry, Gou.

83
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,280
Didn't we

84
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:21,860
already make an agreement?

85
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,150
I believe you.

86
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:24,950
Of course you have to believe me.

87
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:26,630
No matter what happens,

88
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:28,740
I can face it alone.

89
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,190
Okay. Be careful.

90
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:57,470
Gou, you've changed too.

91
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:59,670
You weren't like this in the past.

92
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:13,550
It's you again.

93
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:15,360
What did you come again?

94
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:16,950
Silly girl.

95
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:19,760
I'm here to relieve you of your doubts.

96
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,590
At this moment,

97
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,150
you must be full of doubts.

98
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:27,150
No.

99
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:29,950
Let me ask you.

100
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,390
Do you remember

101
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:34,230
what the real Gou

102
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:35,740
was like?

103
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:39,630
The real Gou?

104
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:02,980
♫An inch of love in my heart♫

105
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:07,480
♫Against your unresolved obsession♫

106
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:14,860
♫Riding alone, the battle horse leaves a trail of dust behind♫

107
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,560
♫Carve a line of heartless words♫

108
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:23,590
♫The name I dare not mention♫

109
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:30,000
♫Hiding my feelings and heart away secretly♫

110
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:26,750
How disobedient you are.

111
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:37,430
♫The wind soothes a moment of yearning♫

112
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:39,840
♫But I can't go beyond it♫

113
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:44,150
♫We're not fated to be♫

114
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:48,420
♫Look, the heavy rain is approaching♫

115
00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:46,710
How is it?

116
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:49,230
Do you remember now?

117
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:52,159
♫We can't stop it from flooding the city♫

118
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:50,750
Yes.

119
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,230
My Gou

120
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:54,870
♫Like the late realization of obsession♫

121
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:54,270
was unintelligent,

122
00:07:54,909 --> 00:07:56,670
but he never complained.

123
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,040
♫The wet tears♫

124
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:00,000
♫Slowly, I come to my senses♫

125
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:58,670
As long as he had a bite to eat,

126
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:00,350
he could be happy for a long time.

127
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:03,790
♫I want to go crazy with you♫

128
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:02,310
But...

129
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,860
But now, Gou

130
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:07,640
♫Remove our armor and bathe in the light of the blades♫

131
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:07,150
is brave and wise.

132
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,950
♫When we're seriously injured, we shall retreat♫

133
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:08,910
He became responsible.

134
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:09,990
He's admired by many people.

135
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:15,210
♫And confine ourselves to my city forever♫

136
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:12,390
Stand up.

137
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:21,350
He's no longer

138
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:22,670
my own Gou.

139
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:25,550
That's because Wu Geng and Gou

140
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:28,270
are two different people.

141
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,309
But it doesn't matter.

142
00:08:34,309 --> 00:08:37,510
Gou was just an idiot.

143
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:39,789
How can an idiot

144
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:42,350
compare to

145
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:44,350
the young hero

146
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:45,870
who everyone admires now?

147
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,320
But who cares

148
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,990
how poor Gou

149
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:56,550
died tragically?

150
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,550
No. How could I forget

151
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:00,510
my Gou?

152
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:02,070
He had been with me for so many years.

153
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:04,200
He was the most important person to me.

154
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:15,500
Gou.

155
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,070
Gou, tell me what to do.

156
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:54,830
Good.

157
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:58,510
My Kongshi Dream is working.

158
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:00,190
It won't be long

159
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:02,590
before Bai Cai is controlled by me.

160
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:03,990
Bai Cai and Wu Geng

161
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:06,190
have been dependent on each other for so long.

162
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:07,630
Will she trust you

163
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:08,830
just because of this?

164
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:10,550
Of course I know.

165
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:12,880
I pretended to help Bai Cai several times.

166
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:14,350
This brat

167
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,190
won't trust me

168
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:17,350
so easily.

169
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:20,790
But these pathetic humans

170
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:23,850
pride themselves on their emotions.

171
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,030
But they don't know

172
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:27,020
this is their greatest weakness.

173
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:28,870
All their actions

174
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:30,950
are ruled by emotions.

175
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:33,990
Bai Cai's weakness is Gou?

176
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:37,910
If I hadn't been afraid of the Colorless Realm's divine power

177
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:39,780
and waited for Bai Cai to be alone,

178
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:41,750
I would have succeeded long ago.

179
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,010
But it doesn't matter.

180
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,190
Wu Geng can't always

181
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:47,150
be by Bai Cai's side.

182
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:51,070
What?

183
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:55,030
You seem to have objections

184
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:56,870
to my plan.

185
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:58,550
I dare not.

186
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:00,630
I just think

187
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:02,990
that since the Immortal Clan is invincible,

188
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:03,830
why do we

189
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,070
use these tricks?

190
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:06,990
The dignity of our Immortal Clan...

191
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:07,870
Zhui Ri.

192
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:10,140
Don't have

193
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,310
any sympathy for enemies.

194
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:17,590
Let me remind you.

195
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:21,550
Kong Que is a traitor.

196
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:25,150
She's no longer your sister.

197
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:36,110
Sister.

198
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,790
We'll meet again soon.

199
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:40,830
This time,

200
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:42,750
I can't go easy on you anymore.

201
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,230
Bai Cai.

202
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:00,690
What happened to you just now?

203
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,590
You kept saying

204
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:04,850
"Gou" and "Silly Gou."

205
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:07,310
Nothing.

206
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:10,590
A lot of things have happened recently.

207
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,030
I feel very confused.

208
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:18,470
I don't know what happened

209
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,990
between you and Gou.

210
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:22,200
But no matter what happens,

211
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,790
please trust Gou.

212
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:32,070
You're right.

213
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:36,150
I should trust my Gou.

214
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:45,950
Why is there the fluctuation

215
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:48,550
of the Kongshi Realm's divine power on Bai Cai?

216
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:49,500
Could it be that someone

217
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,160
is trying to control her mind?

218
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:54,190
High Priest.

219
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:58,290
Bai Cai seems to be hiding something from me.

220
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:00,630
What should I do?

221
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,200
High Priest!

222
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:11,500
Lan.

223
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:16,270
High Priest.

224
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,360
What happened to your eyes?

225
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,710
Xinyue Kui did this?

226
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:28,110
Lan, calm down.

227
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,150
Calm down.

228
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:33,670
High Priest.

229
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:35,110
Where are you now?

230
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:36,160
I'll go save you.

231
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:37,140
Lan.

232
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:39,780
My life isn't important.

233
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:40,750
This time,

234
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:41,790
I tried to see you

235
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:43,070
with my divine power.

236
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:44,950
We can't waste time.

237
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:46,870
I sensed

238
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:48,600
the star representing the God of War

239
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,670
is shaking.

240
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:51,270
Xinyue Kui might be

241
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:53,150
trying to change Wu Geng's destiny.

242
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:54,070
Remember,

243
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:56,430
Wu Geng can't be affected

244
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:57,670
by anything.

245
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,790
Chaos starts from the inside.

246
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:02,630
You should always keep an eye

247
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:04,030
on the people around him.

248
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,390
You mean

249
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:08,630
Bai Cai?

250
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:11,030
Bai Cai?

251
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:13,270
What did she do?

252
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:15,470
She seems to be doubting

253
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:16,670
Wu Geng's identity.

254
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:18,430
And it seems

255
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:20,110
that someone is using the Kongshi Realm's divine power

256
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:21,390
to get in her head.

257
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:23,630
If she doesn't resist,

258
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,690
other people can do nothing about it.

259
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:27,590
Lan.

260
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:31,270
Do you remember

261
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:34,310
what I once said?

262
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:39,320
If necessary,

263
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:42,430
kill Bai Cai.

264
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:46,110
But High Priest,

265
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:48,750
Bai Cai may not be

266
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,280
the person in the prophecy.

267
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:52,310
And we're

268
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:53,870
friends now.

269
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:55,260
Bai Cai is really nice.

270
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:56,230
She's very kind.

271
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:57,710
She also loves Wu Geng very much.

272
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:59,110
Wu Geng can't live without her.

273
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:00,090
Lan.

274
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:03,230
There are many variables

275
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:05,110
in destinies.

276
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:07,390
I can't see through them all.

277
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:09,990
The Heaven Way is vast.

278
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,950
You need to understand it yourself.

279
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:25,670
Okay.

280
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:28,290
High Priest, don't worry.

281
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:31,400
I'll follow your instructions

282
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:34,390
and protect Wu Geng.

283
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:40,110
High Priest.

284
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:41,930
High Priest, listen to me.

285
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,780
Shenyin Village has been safely rebuilt.

286
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:44,950
Wu Geng also succeeded in activating

287
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:45,950
the Colorless Realm's divine power.

288
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:46,990
He also formed an alliance with the Demon Clan's

289
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:48,030
Grand Marshal Nitian Erxing.

290
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,150
I believe it won't be long

291
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:50,550
before we can go save you.

292
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:52,360
You must take care of yourself.

293
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:53,430
High Priest.

294
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,460
High Priest!

295
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:56,790
Lan.

296
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,670
I believe you and Kong Que.

297
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:01,580
I also believe Wu Geng.

298
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:03,750
I believe you can

299
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,310
complete your missions.

300
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:18,710
No wonder there're fluctuations in the Kongshi Realm's divine power

301
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:20,990
coming from the World's End.

302
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,410
Luckily, I came to take a look.

303
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:25,430
Otherwise, I wouldn't have known

304
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:27,710
you still have something up your sleeve.

305
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:35,750
You want Lan to kill Bai Cai.

306
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,790
I'm here.

307
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,350
No matter what you do,

308
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:43,870
you won't change the ending.

309
00:16:58,270 --> 00:16:59,070
Bai Cai.

310
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:01,810
Where are the kids?

311
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:04,470
I left them

312
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:05,599
with Lan and Shitou.

313
00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:09,650
Why did you suddenly come to the city?

314
00:17:10,109 --> 00:17:11,910
I want to make some fish for the kids.

315
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:13,270
I found that there's no seasoning

316
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:14,630
in this city.

317
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:27,950
Why are there fireworks all of a sudden?

318
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:28,740
Yes.

319
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:46,270
If everything were really fine,

320
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:47,950
how happy would it be?

321
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:50,270
But some things

322
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,670
aren't what they seem.

323
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:57,330

330

♫Lies are sorrows♫

333
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,750
when I meet a girl I like,

I must give it to her personally

335
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,430
and put it on her.

♫We can't forget each other, just like the moonlight♫

or on your mother?

351
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:00,470
Thank you, Gou.

352
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:09,440
Bai Cai.

353
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:14,350
Do you remember that after the fall of Xin State,

354
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,270
you often said I was weird

355
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:20,470
and kept asking who I was?

356
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:22,510
Yes.

357
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:28,110
I did hide something

358
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:28,950
from you.

359
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:32,030
But I didn't mean to hide it from you.

360
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:34,790

♫We can't forget each other, just like the moonlight♫

369

Immortal Realm won't be able to detect

371
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,270
my actions.

372
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:54,870
Wu Geng, what took you so long?

373
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:57,750
I've been expecting you.

374
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:00,270
Where is Gui Mu?

375
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:01,950
Why isn't he here?

376
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:04,710
How do you know?

377
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:06,670
I'm here to take Zhou Fa away.

378
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:08,750
Do you really want

379
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:10,810
Zhou Fa to continue to suffer?

380
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:14,590
Gui Mu chickened out?

381
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,310
Did you hear that?

382
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,670
This rebel is trying to harm His Majesty.

383
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:21,710
Arrest him now!

384
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:36,120
Your Highness.

385
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:38,190
Your Highness.

386
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:39,750
His Majesty is missing.

387
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:43,190
Wu Geng.

388
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:45,050
Where is my father?

389
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:46,880
Zhou Fa is in my hands.

390
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:49,030
How about we make a deal?

391
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:50,270
What do you want?

392
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:52,720
First,

393
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,360
worship my father and mother in public,

394
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,350
clear their names,

395
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:59,080
and restore their reputation.

396
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,070
Father.

397
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:01,550
I'm not finished yet.

398
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:05,270
Bai Cai, you go first.

399
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:09,590
Second,

400
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:11,870
destroy all Eternal Fruit

401
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:14,910
and tell the public

402
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:16,480
that Immortal Realm uses Eternal Fruit

403
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,470
to harm the common people.

404
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:18,550
Are you crazy?

405
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:21,070
You're openly defying Immortal Realm.

406
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:22,270
The Immortal Clan and I

407
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:23,630
have already been enemies.

408
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:25,630
This isn't the first day you know me.

409
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:27,150
Wu Geng.

410
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:30,470
Do you really want Bai State

411
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,170
to become the second Xin State?

412
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:35,310
Are deaths of living beings and rivers of blood

413
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:36,590
what you want to see?

414
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:40,340
Know the situation.

415
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:43,070
People

416
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:45,870
can never bounce back.

417
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:49,940
Don't think

418
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,220
you're the exception.

419
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:52,980
Hasn't anyone

420
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:54,450
resisted the Immortal Clan

421
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:55,910
in the past 100,000 years?

422
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:58,070
Why can you succeed?

423
00:22:58,950 --> 00:22:59,910
You think you've learnt

424
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:01,070
some skills and lian qi,

425
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:03,070
so you're invincible in this world?

426
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:07,810
Compared with the Immortal Clan,

427
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:09,550
you're

428
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:12,080
not even close.

429
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:14,680
Really?

430
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:19,410
Then you should really take a closer look

431
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:20,670
at the situation

432
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:21,630
at this moment.

433
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:29,220
The Poison Locust

434
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:30,540
should be used by Gui Mu

435
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:32,300
to track Bai Cai, right?

436
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:35,520
The reason why Gui Mu didn't show up

437
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:36,850
is because your target

438
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:38,050
is not me

439
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:39,510
but Bai Cai.

440
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:40,740
Am I right?

441
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:42,590
But as soon as the Poison Locust

442
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:44,190
landed on Bai Cai's body,

443
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:47,430
it was frozen by the Crystal's divine power.

444
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:51,920
Wu Geng, I didn't expect

445
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:54,560
that not only did you become stronger,

446
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:57,480
you also became smart.

447
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:03,250
But this is the palace.

448
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:05,300
If you attack Gui Mu,

449
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:07,790
you'll kill me.

450
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:09,620
What do you mean?

451
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:13,950
Gui Mu is very cautious.

452
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,110
Usually, even I

453
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,150
don't know

454
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:19,950
which room he's hiding in.

455
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,540
But now,

456
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:27,150
there's an opportunity.

457
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:32,550
Lan.

458
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:34,250
We've found Illusion Island.

459
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:35,960
But we didn't feel

460
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:37,850
Great Swordsman's breath there.

461
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,440
You fools!

462
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:49,490
What are you waiting for?

463
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:50,460
Go after him!

464
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:51,130
Yes.

465
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:54,740
Qiao.

466
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,720
Godfather.

467
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:58,070
Godfather, you're finally here.

468
00:24:58,070 --> 00:24:59,540
I know.

469
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:02,910
They took Zhou Fa away.

470
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:05,420
But I'm so incompetent

471
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:07,030
that I failed to keep Wu Geng

472
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:08,300
and Bai Cai.

473
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:09,590
I don't know what method

474
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:10,430
that woman used.

475
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:12,230
She disappeared all of a sudden.

476
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,870
Don't worry.

477
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:19,270
She used the Demon Clan's Air Vanishing Spell.

478
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:21,940
But Bai Cai's ability is mediocre.

479
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:24,090
She also has Zhou Fa on her back.

480
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:26,750
The distance between each Air Vanishing Spell

481
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:28,070
won't be too far.

482
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:32,270
Actually, I've already covered Zhou Fa

483
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:34,470
with Poison Locust.

484
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:37,910
No matter where Bai Cai goes,

485
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:41,550
I know her whereabouts.

486
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:44,430
She can't go far.

487
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:46,130
Great, Godfather.

488
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,510
I've sent soldiers

489
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:48,750
to chase them just now.

490
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:49,870
In order to

491
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:50,870
distract the soldiers

492
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:51,950
and protect Bai Cai,

493
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:54,280
Wu Geng is going a different way from hers.

494
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:55,740
Bai Cai

495
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:57,430
is alone now.

496
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:19,620
You've been using the Air Vanishing Spell all the way.

497
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,480
Girl.

498
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:23,460
You must be tired.

499
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:24,920
My divine spirit

500
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,990
has blocked the area.

501
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:29,220
No matter how you teleport,

502
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:32,510
you're just circling around.

503
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:34,830
Surprised?

504
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:36,840
From the beginning,

505
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:39,720
my target has been you.

506
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:41,260
I don't know

507
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,760
why High Priest

508
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:44,500
has been protecting you.

509
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,790
But now,

510
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:50,810
Wu Geng used his Colorless Realm's divine power

511
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:54,120
to stop High Priest's View Mirror.

512
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:56,390
What a pity.

513
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:58,980
No one in heaven or on earth

514
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,050
can save you now.

515
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:13,120
Then don't blame me

516
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:14,260
when you die later.

517
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:15,710
If you want to blame someone,

518
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:17,590
blame yourself for being stupid.

519
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:20,170
Wu Geng.

520
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:23,430
Wu Geng!

521
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,840
Gui Mu.

522
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:40,030
It's my divine spirit

523
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:41,800
that sealed the surroundings.

524
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:43,380
No matter how you struggle,

525
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:44,610
you can only

526
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,640
stay here.

527
00:27:58,820 --> 00:27:59,830
What do you want?

528
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:00,950
First,

529
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:03,480
worship my father and mother in public.

530
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:06,150
He's really Wu Geng,

531
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:07,470
not Gou.

532
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:09,470
If you want to live,

533
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:11,150
tell me honestly

534
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:14,300
what Eternal Tree is.

535
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:25,190
I can tell you.

536
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:26,750
Right.

537
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:29,470
Those trees

538
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:32,510
are formed from humans.

539
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:35,470
Once you take

540
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:37,110
Eternal Fruit,

541
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:38,910
you should keep eating it.

542
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:41,950
Keep eating.

543
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,800
If you stop

544
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:45,660
or disobey my orders,

545
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:48,720
you'll become Eternal Tree.

546
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:51,420
Didn't that Zhou Fa

547
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:54,440
end up like this?

548
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:58,530
It's exactly what I thought.

549
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:00,930
There's no human-eating monster at all.

550
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:03,840
All the missing people turned into trees.

551
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,020
How is it?

552
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:08,530
The idea of man-eating monsters is good,

553
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:09,740
isn't it?

554
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,160
That's all thanks to you.

555
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:15,050
In this way,

556
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:19,870
no one will know the connection between Eternal Fruit

557
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:23,350
and the disappearance of common people.

558
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:26,030
Qiao.

559
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:31,230
I never made you take

560
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,750
Eternal Fruit.

561
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:34,990
I treat you as my own child

562
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:36,340
and teach you well.

563
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:39,830
You should understand what I'm doing.

564
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:44,210
Your father

565
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,300
is stupid and incompetent.

566
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:49,490
But you're different.

567
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:53,670
You're teachable.

568
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:56,350
As long as you trust me,

569
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:59,400
the common people of Bai capital are nothing.

570
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:01,500
Listen to me.

571
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:03,300
You'll be worshiped

572
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:05,750
by all the human race in the world.

573
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:07,080
You'll get

574
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:09,780
supreme glory.

575
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:11,100
Gui Mu.

576
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:14,070
How can we detoxify Eternal Fruit?

577
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:19,350
You're dying.

578
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:22,150
There's no need for you to ask.

579
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,260
Gui Mu.

580
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:29,840
Back then, my father cut off

581
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,550
one of your arms and one of your legs.

582
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:32,570
Today,

583
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:34,280
I'll cut off

584
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:35,760
all your remaining limbs.

585
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:41,990
I'll fight to the end.

586
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:45,170
The Earth Realm's divine power.

587
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:17,350
Congratulations, Zhou Qiao.

588
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:18,810
You avenged Bai King.

589
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:23,150
I have no way out now.

590
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:25,190
We can work together.

591
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:28,110
Who said you have no way out?

592
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:30,100
You didn't kill him.

593
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:34,560
No matter what,

594
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:36,150
you trust me.

595
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:38,450
It means you're really smart.

596
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:40,000
It's worth

597
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:41,690
working with you.

598
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:45,460
Whether or not

599
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,960
you stabbed him in the back,

600
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,390
I could handle Gui Mu.

601
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:54,270
Don't be happy too soon.

602
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:23,900
This fruit isn't bad.

603
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,160
Yes. It's really good.

604
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:31,030
No.

605
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:32,900
No.

606
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:35,190
No!

607
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:40,630
No! No!

608
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,460
Gou.

609
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,560
Stop.

610
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:01,390
You'll hurt the kids.

611
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:07,490
Don't panic.

612
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:14,480
Uncle Ziyu.

613
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:28,070
Bai Cai.

614
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,190
Great Swordsman had a feeling that you need him.

615
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:39,590
He returned from Illusion Island long ago.

616
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:41,120
I shouldn't have bothered.

617
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:42,510
I said before

618
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:44,389
that as long as you needed me,

619
00:34:44,389 --> 00:34:45,909
I'd arrive in time

620
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:48,409
even if you were thousands of miles away.

621
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:12,790
If I were two hours late,

622
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:15,590
I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to save people.

623
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:16,790
Time is running out.

624
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:18,720
I'm not capable enough.

625
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:21,870
Give lian qi to Lan.

626
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:23,190
Okay.

627
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:03,190
Zhou Qiao.

628
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:06,110
You're so calculating.

629
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:10,270
Don't be happy too soon.

630
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:12,470
Now,

631
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,750
you can't even compare

632
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:17,270
to Wu Geng's fingers.

633
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:20,710
Do you think you'll have a bright future

634
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:23,670
if you join forces with him?

635
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:31,630
Zhou Qiao.

636
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:33,470
Don't forget

637
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:36,080
what you did to Xin King's body

638
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:37,670
back then.

639
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:39,360
What did you do

640
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,930
to Xin King's body?

641
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,990
Will Wu Geng spare you?

642
00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:55,310
Will the Immortal Clan spare you?

643
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:29,670
Uncle Ziyu.

644
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,270
Are you okay?

645
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:34,590
I need some rest. I'm fine.

646
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:36,070
But

647
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:38,550
she consumed too much power.

648
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,720
Lan.

649
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:53,570
Wu Geng, I'm fine.

650
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:55,950
Take a rest.

651
00:38:57,350 --> 00:38:58,150
Here.

652
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:13,520
You're awake.

653
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,670
Bai Cai. Bai Cai.

654
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:16,910
Bai Cai.

655
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:19,110
I'm glad you're awake.

656
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:21,430
Do you still feel bad?

657
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:23,110
Bai Cai.

658
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:25,110
Gou, we're fine.

659
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:25,990
Gou.

660
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:26,740
You're all fine?

661
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:27,110
Yes.

662
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:27,830
Great.

663
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:28,470
Gou.

664
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:29,670
We're playing outside.

665
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:30,230
Let's go.

666
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:32,670
Let's go.

667
00:39:32,990 --> 00:39:33,710
Wait for me.

668
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:41,590
Zhou Qiao has joined forces with us.

669
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,110
The kids are fine now.

670
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:44,520
You can be relieved now.

671
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:46,910
Of course I'm relieved,

672
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:52,470
Prince Wu Geng.

673
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:01,590
He's just a human.

674
00:40:03,790 --> 00:40:05,920
I didn't expect him to have such power.

675
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:09,750
One night.

676
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:11,350
For a whole night,

677
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:12,610
he completely blocked

678
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:14,580
the Kongshi Realm's divine power.

679
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:16,990
By the way, High Priest,

680
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:17,790
Gui Mu's throne

681
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:19,590
seemed to move slightly just now.

682
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:21,510
The color of the throne keeps changing.

683
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:23,640
Something might have happened to him.

684
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:25,550
Gui Mu died?

685
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:28,510
I don't think he's dead.

686
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:30,440
But something must have happened.

687
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:32,270
I can't reach him.

688
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:33,590
I'm afraid that he was tricked

689
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:34,470
by the human race.

690
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:35,510
Gui Mu.

691
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:40,070
Gui Mu is a loser.

692
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,250
But he has humiliated

693
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:43,840
our immortal realm.

694
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:47,250
Since Shi Xing died,

695
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:48,460
our Immortal Clan

696
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:50,460
has long been disgraced.

697
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:54,900
High Priest.

698
00:40:55,110 --> 00:40:56,950
Let me go to the mortal realm to check.

699
00:40:56,950 --> 00:40:58,120
There's no rush.

700
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:00,480
Why don't we wait a little longer?

701
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:03,080
The most interesting thing

702
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:05,450
has already happened.
