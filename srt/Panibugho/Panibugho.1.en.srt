1
00:01:20,734 --> 00:01:22,691
Ahem... my apologies.

2
00:01:23,153 --> 00:01:25,486
As I was saying earlier...

3
00:01:26,114 --> 00:01:27,114
There's an issue.

4
00:01:28,367 --> 00:01:29,868
According to my findings,

5
00:01:29,893 --> 00:01:32,771
Most of your father's holdings are...

6
00:01:33,413 --> 00:01:36,166
Currently under litigation.

7
00:01:37,459 --> 00:01:39,541
What does that mean Attorney?

8
00:01:40,128 --> 00:01:41,919
Well, to put it simply...

9
00:01:42,756 --> 00:01:45,631
The trust will have to
fund your allowance...

10
00:01:45,926 --> 00:01:47,216
Through assets that were,

11
00:01:47,427 --> 00:01:49,012
Already liquidated.

12
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:52,054
But also, there was something else...

13
00:01:52,474 --> 00:01:56,475
A farm, I believe... Somewhere in...

14
00:01:57,715 --> 00:01:58,549
San Pablo.

15
00:01:58,574 --> 00:01:59,574
- Yes there is.
- Exactly.

16
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:02,231
With that, there's hope.

17
00:02:03,418 --> 00:02:04,378
Here's the plan...

18
00:02:04,403 --> 00:02:08,532
I'll ask my assistant to
handle the deed and...

19
00:02:08,557 --> 00:02:11,823
We'll quickly have it put under your names.

20
00:02:11,927 --> 00:02:14,638
How long is this going to take?

21
00:02:14,663 --> 00:02:16,598
Dad has been dead for a month.

22
00:02:16,623 --> 00:02:20,625
We're doing everything we can,

23
00:02:20,769 --> 00:02:22,626
To expedite the process.

24
00:02:24,059 --> 00:02:25,936
Thank you for this,

25
00:02:25,961 --> 00:02:27,234
I'll be off now.

26
00:02:27,259 --> 00:02:29,148
Safe travels, Attorney,

27
00:02:29,173 --> 00:02:30,854
Our apologies,
that's all we can offer.

28
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,798
We'll make it up
to you next time.

29
00:02:33,156 --> 00:02:35,289
Thank you, Attorney.

30
00:02:35,314 --> 00:02:36,907
Thank you too,

31
00:02:36,932 --> 00:02:39,140
For the chicken and the rice cake.

32
00:02:40,174 --> 00:02:41,648
Take care.

33
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,528
Ester!

34
00:03:03,803 --> 00:03:05,513
Damn it.

35
00:03:05,622 --> 00:03:07,749
That land is ruining our plans.

36
00:03:09,259 --> 00:03:10,259
"Our plans"?

37
00:03:11,303 --> 00:03:12,536
Are you sure about that?

38
00:03:12,929 --> 00:03:13,929
What?

39
00:03:14,281 --> 00:03:15,991
Don't act like you're
not benefitting from this.

40
00:03:16,016 --> 00:03:18,490
This pays for your ticket
to medical school right?

41
00:03:18,852 --> 00:03:21,646
I just need enough
to get back to the city.

42
00:03:22,355 --> 00:03:24,115
I don't know why it's
taking fucking forever.

43
00:03:26,276 --> 00:03:28,150
I don't know why
you're being so impatient.

44
00:03:28,612 --> 00:03:30,861
Why are you so intent on leaving?

45
00:03:31,781 --> 00:03:33,280
You're leaving sis?

46
00:03:33,783 --> 00:03:36,158
Who would want to stay here?

47
00:03:41,374 --> 00:03:42,959
I'm going to bed.

48
00:03:47,589 --> 00:03:49,796
Lea, you should go to bed too.

49
00:07:43,544 --> 00:07:47,220
When are you teaching me to drive?

50
00:07:47,245 --> 00:07:49,372
Come on,

51
00:07:49,372 --> 00:07:51,624
You can't even get around commuting,

52
00:07:51,649 --> 00:07:54,249
Trikes and jeepneys
almost never pass here.

53
00:07:54,305 --> 00:07:56,142
Where do you even plan to go?

54
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:00,171
Well, I'll go to the fiesta
in the next town over.

55
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:04,401
I haven't gone to
the dance in a while.

56
00:08:04,426 --> 00:08:06,469
That's what you're good at anyway.

57
00:08:08,241 --> 00:08:11,308
Alright, I guess I can
find time to teach you.

58
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:14,814
But... on one condition.

59
00:08:16,499 --> 00:08:18,857
When you've learned to drive,

60
00:08:18,882 --> 00:08:22,886
We'll take turns
going to the market.

61
00:08:23,047 --> 00:08:24,215
Sound good to you?

62
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,630
Yes, sis.

63
00:08:27,719 --> 00:08:30,680
Wait, isn't this right around,

64
00:08:30,705 --> 00:08:33,246
The river we used to swim in?

65
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:35,251
Yes, it is. Why?

66
00:08:35,276 --> 00:08:37,237
Can we swing by for a bit?

67
00:08:37,967 --> 00:08:40,970
Next time, we still
have to make dinner.

68
00:08:42,091 --> 00:08:43,882
Come on, just for a bit.

69
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,550
Please?

70
00:08:48,499 --> 00:08:50,656
Oh, alright then.

71
00:08:50,681 --> 00:08:52,015
What do you say, Ester?

72
00:08:52,677 --> 00:08:54,739
- Let the youngest have this one.
- Alright.

73
00:08:55,396 --> 00:08:57,372
Great!

74
00:09:01,798 --> 00:09:02,798
Halt!

75
00:09:04,368 --> 00:09:06,137
Where are you headed, ma'am?

76
00:09:06,716 --> 00:09:08,051
Wait, at ease...

77
00:09:08,076 --> 00:09:10,367
Aren't you Don Fidel's daughters?

78
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:12,802
Yes sir. Good afternoon.

79
00:09:12,827 --> 00:09:14,537
So, where are you headed?

80
00:09:14,582 --> 00:09:17,332
We just wanted
to swing by the river.

81
00:09:17,544 --> 00:09:18,461
Alright,

82
00:09:18,486 --> 00:09:19,486
Let them through.

83
00:09:19,729 --> 00:09:20,897
- Thank you, sir.
- Ma'am...

84
00:09:20,922 --> 00:09:22,170
Our apologies, but...

85
00:09:22,357 --> 00:09:23,858
Please return before dark.

86
00:09:23,883 --> 00:09:25,840
You may not have heard,

87
00:09:25,924 --> 00:09:28,677
Rebels have been
spotted in the area.

88
00:09:28,781 --> 00:09:30,449
Best be careful.

89
00:09:31,975 --> 00:09:33,615
- Okay.
- Thank you, sir.

90
00:09:33,852 --> 00:09:35,703
- Take care.
- Alright, Buddy...

91
00:09:35,728 --> 00:09:36,728
Open it!

92
00:11:01,981 --> 00:11:05,148
That was fun!

93
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,610
We haven't gone out in a while.

94
00:11:09,138 --> 00:11:10,320
And see?

95
00:11:10,907 --> 00:11:14,574
You both went hours
without a fight.

96
00:11:18,651 --> 00:11:20,779
Don't worry. I promise that...

97
00:11:20,804 --> 00:11:24,390
When everything in the villa is sorted...

98
00:11:24,428 --> 00:11:26,961
We'll be able to go out everyday.

99
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:28,633
And not just to the river...

100
00:11:28,658 --> 00:11:30,243
We'll go wherever you want.

101
00:11:30,843 --> 00:11:32,637
There you go with your promises again,

102
00:11:32,662 --> 00:11:34,589
You're going to break her heart again.

103
00:11:34,989 --> 00:11:36,240
Remember last year?

104
00:11:36,265 --> 00:11:38,222
When Dad was still alive,

105
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,378
Didn't she cry all the time?

106
00:11:40,676 --> 00:11:44,042
All because you promised
to take her with you.

107
00:11:44,732 --> 00:11:45,816
But as always...

108
00:11:46,526 --> 00:11:47,785
You never did.

109
00:11:48,319 --> 00:11:49,362
If it were me,

110
00:11:49,988 --> 00:11:52,964
I wouldn't make promises I can't keep.

111
00:11:53,157 --> 00:11:54,397
I wouldn't give her false hope.

112
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:56,285
That's enough!

113
00:11:56,599 --> 00:11:58,276
I've lost my appetite.

114
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:03,292
What was that?

115
00:12:07,255 --> 00:12:08,339
Calm down,

116
00:12:08,364 --> 00:12:10,074
It's probably just a firefight.

117
00:12:11,157 --> 00:12:13,574
I hope those rebels get caught.

118
00:12:13,928 --> 00:12:15,471
Bringing their fight
to us like this...

119
00:12:15,496 --> 00:12:17,373
Those animals, those pests.

120
00:13:05,229 --> 00:13:06,189
Wait,

121
00:13:06,189 --> 00:13:07,789
You're just going to
leave him like that?

122
00:13:07,861 --> 00:13:10,251
Lea, we don't even know him.

123
00:13:10,276 --> 00:13:12,785
If someone's after him,
they'll come after us too.

124
00:13:13,029 --> 00:13:14,986
But he's hurt!

125
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:18,031
Can't you patch up his wound?

126
00:13:18,367 --> 00:13:20,617
He won't make it to the hospital!

127
00:13:31,214 --> 00:13:33,466
Ester, hurry, we need to move him.

128
00:14:16,425 --> 00:14:17,677
Hand me the scalpel.

129
00:14:24,131 --> 00:14:26,144
Ester, give me the forceps...

130
00:14:58,009 --> 00:14:59,302
Tomas?

131
00:14:59,302 --> 00:15:00,845
Wake up, Tomas!

132
00:15:00,845 --> 00:15:02,138
Tomas?

133
00:15:04,682 --> 00:15:05,920
How'd you sleep, son?

134
00:15:06,184 --> 00:15:07,143
It was good, mother.

135
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,147
Study well, son.

136
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:11,026
With those looks,

137
00:15:11,051 --> 00:15:13,280
You could attract distractions.

138
00:15:16,652 --> 00:15:18,446
Why would they do this?

139
00:15:19,322 --> 00:15:20,322
Father!

140
00:15:21,866 --> 00:15:24,037
Father, wake up! Father...

141
00:15:24,452 --> 00:15:25,870
Father, wake up! Father...

142
00:15:25,895 --> 00:15:27,204
Father...

143
00:15:28,122 --> 00:15:29,122
Father...

144
00:15:31,756 --> 00:15:33,295
Lea, wait...

145
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,344
You need to rest.

146
00:15:41,369 --> 00:15:43,120
You're burning up.

147
00:15:45,264 --> 00:15:47,683
You're wounded pretty deep.

148
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:49,937
And the bullet was in
your thigh for a while.

149
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:53,039
It'll need some time to recover.

150
00:15:53,356 --> 00:15:55,483
What do we call you?

151
00:15:58,945 --> 00:15:59,945
Felipe.

152
00:16:00,696 --> 00:16:02,531
I'm Sonya.

153
00:16:03,157 --> 00:16:04,967
And these are my sisters.

154
00:16:04,992 --> 00:16:06,898
Lea and Ester.

155
00:16:09,914 --> 00:16:10,939
Leah,

156
00:16:10,964 --> 00:16:13,812
Would you kindly,
fetch some cold water?

157
00:16:14,168 --> 00:16:16,406
Felipe needs to drink water.

158
00:16:22,662 --> 00:16:24,289
Hey, slow down.

159
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:26,523
You shouldn't move around.

160
00:16:26,847 --> 00:16:28,203
Your body needs rest.

161
00:16:29,459 --> 00:16:30,793
I'm sorry,

162
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,146
But I need to use the bathroom.

163
00:16:59,797 --> 00:17:01,036
I'll do it.

164
00:17:37,668 --> 00:17:39,388
You were dreaming weren't you?

165
00:17:39,837 --> 00:17:41,638
You were calling out to your father.

166
00:17:54,959 --> 00:17:56,127
Go to sleep.

167
00:17:57,104 --> 00:17:58,104
Thank you.

168
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,379
Good, you're awake.

169
00:20:58,786 --> 00:20:59,703
I brought breakfast.

170
00:20:59,703 --> 00:21:02,039
I made it myself, Ginarep.

171
00:21:03,582 --> 00:21:04,582
Thank you.

172
00:21:09,964 --> 00:21:11,173
Would you like coffee?

173
00:21:11,173 --> 00:21:12,508
I can make some.

174
00:21:12,508 --> 00:21:13,634
Maybe later.

175
00:21:14,927 --> 00:21:16,554
Oh yes, Felipe,

176
00:21:16,554 --> 00:21:19,098
There are extra clothes in
the closet that might fit you.

177
00:21:19,098 --> 00:21:21,058
They were left by
some of our old workers.

178
00:21:21,058 --> 00:21:23,018
You can wear those for now.

179
00:21:29,316 --> 00:21:30,505
There it goes,

180
00:21:31,068 --> 00:21:34,349
Those old wardrobes keep
swinging open by themselves.

181
00:21:35,823 --> 00:21:36,823
Eat up.

182
00:21:46,584 --> 00:21:47,584
Do you like it?

183
00:21:48,586 --> 00:21:49,586
Yes, it's good.

184
00:21:52,214 --> 00:21:53,974
Did you sleep well?

185
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,300
Of course.

186
00:21:55,718 --> 00:21:57,386
Well, most of the night at least.

187
00:21:57,411 --> 00:21:59,851
The pain kept me up for some of it.

188
00:22:00,889 --> 00:22:02,141
Don't worry.

189
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:04,265
We can take care of you here.

190
00:22:04,935 --> 00:22:06,392
You're too kind.

191
00:22:07,062 --> 00:22:09,064
How can I repay you?

192
00:22:09,064 --> 00:22:10,566
Don't think about that.

193
00:22:10,566 --> 00:22:12,732
The important thing is
that you get better.

194
00:22:13,652 --> 00:22:15,109
I've been thinking,

195
00:22:15,404 --> 00:22:16,527
That since...

196
00:22:16,989 --> 00:22:21,741
I'm pretty handy around the house,

197
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:24,994
Maybe I could fix some things for you.

198
00:22:25,456 --> 00:22:28,459
I could start with self-opening wardrobes.

199
00:22:28,459 --> 00:22:29,585
No need to fuss,

200
00:22:29,585 --> 00:22:31,459
Sonya can handle those things.

201
00:22:31,837 --> 00:22:34,795
And I don't plan on staying long.

202
00:22:35,565 --> 00:22:37,025
Why is that?

203
00:22:37,259 --> 00:22:40,290
I'm just waiting on the money
our Dad left for us.

204
00:22:40,429 --> 00:22:44,096
Then, I'll be on my way to Manila.

205
00:22:44,475 --> 00:22:46,849
Hopefully I'll get a job.

206
00:22:47,102 --> 00:22:48,601
Maybe start a family too.

207
00:22:49,313 --> 00:22:50,978
What about your sisters?

208
00:22:51,003 --> 00:22:52,171
They're grown ups.

209
00:22:52,202 --> 00:22:56,275
Sonya has her own
plans with the money.

210
00:22:56,654 --> 00:22:59,281
She'll probably go
back to medical school.

211
00:22:59,442 --> 00:23:01,097
As for Lea,

212
00:23:01,122 --> 00:23:04,033
She'll probably stay here
and grow old single.

213
00:23:05,412 --> 00:23:07,761
What about you Felipe?
Where are you from?

214
00:23:07,915 --> 00:23:09,455
How'd you get here?

215
00:23:09,917 --> 00:23:11,251
I'm from Manila.

216
00:23:11,276 --> 00:23:12,917
I'm just here on vacation.

217
00:23:13,087 --> 00:23:15,503
Do you want to call your family?

218
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:25,846
No need.

219
00:23:26,266 --> 00:23:27,768
I wouldn't want them to worry.

220
00:23:30,729 --> 00:23:32,231
Go, move there.

221
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:43,968
You know, your hair's already soft.

222
00:23:43,993 --> 00:23:45,452
I don't think you really need this.

223
00:23:45,484 --> 00:23:47,548
Is there a boyfriend
we don't know about?

224
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,765
I'm telling Sonya.

225
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:50,833
No, of course not!

226
00:23:51,667 --> 00:23:52,667
Not yet.

227
00:23:52,876 --> 00:23:55,960
And why does Sonya have to
know everything about me?

228
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:57,672
And stop that!

229
00:23:57,835 --> 00:24:00,442
Don't make a habit out of telling her...

230
00:24:00,467 --> 00:24:02,010
Every little thing about you.

231
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,950
Hey, Lea!

232
00:24:28,328 --> 00:24:29,451
What's that for?

233
00:24:29,621 --> 00:24:31,120
Are you cooking something?

234
00:24:31,331 --> 00:24:33,330
It's for Ester's...

235
00:24:35,729 --> 00:24:37,710
Listen you two,

236
00:24:38,046 --> 00:24:39,548
Don't let your guard down.

237
00:24:40,466 --> 00:24:44,102
It's unsettling to have
a stranger in the house.

238
00:24:44,425 --> 00:24:46,510
We can't take this lightly.

239
00:25:04,715 --> 00:25:06,341
He's wounded.

240
00:25:06,366 --> 00:25:08,343
He's in no shape to do any harm.

241
00:25:08,368 --> 00:25:09,407
Ester,

242
00:25:09,645 --> 00:25:11,271
I'm just being cautious.

243
00:25:21,774 --> 00:25:23,567
From now on...

244
00:25:23,592 --> 00:25:26,425
Lea and I will be in charge of Felipe.

245
00:25:26,853 --> 00:25:29,011
I'll change his bandages.

246
00:25:29,235 --> 00:25:30,820
And Lea,

247
00:25:30,845 --> 00:25:32,765
You'll bring his food.

248
00:25:50,427 --> 00:25:53,347
Ester! Sonya!

249
00:25:53,426 --> 00:25:56,071
You're louder than the damn chickens!

250
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:58,066
- What's happening?
- Sonya...

251
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:06,548
Lea!

252
00:26:07,277 --> 00:26:09,363
What happened to the chickens?

253
00:26:09,388 --> 00:26:11,971
I specifically asked you
to look after them!

254
00:26:12,801 --> 00:26:15,347
But I was so sure I tied them up.

255
00:26:15,769 --> 00:26:17,521
How could this happen?

256
00:26:18,252 --> 00:26:21,088
This could only happen
if they were left untied!

257
00:26:21,113 --> 00:26:22,209
Just admit it Lea!

258
00:26:22,234 --> 00:26:23,919
Why won't you believe me?

259
00:26:23,944 --> 00:26:24,778
Ugh, god...

260
00:26:24,803 --> 00:26:26,638
I'm telling the truth.

261
00:26:27,695 --> 00:26:29,613
Why would I want this to happen?

262
00:26:32,494 --> 00:26:33,494
Lea!

263
00:26:43,297 --> 00:26:44,506
Let me do that.

264
00:26:44,531 --> 00:26:45,531
No it's fine.

265
00:26:47,259 --> 00:26:48,427
Thank you.

266
00:27:01,356 --> 00:27:02,356
Bulalo...

267
00:27:02,983 --> 00:27:03,983
My favorite.

268
00:27:04,751 --> 00:27:05,711
Really?

269
00:27:05,736 --> 00:27:07,071
Me too.

270
00:27:07,451 --> 00:27:08,451
Really?

271
00:27:12,284 --> 00:27:14,641
Ester mentioned that...

272
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:16,626
You're from Manila?

273
00:27:18,974 --> 00:27:20,809
Is Manila really that beautiful?

274
00:27:20,834 --> 00:27:21,835
Yeah.

275
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:25,380
Do you plan on going too?

276
00:27:25,405 --> 00:27:26,698
Ester seems to want to go.

277
00:27:28,216 --> 00:27:29,715
I'm not keen on leaving.

278
00:27:30,886 --> 00:27:32,384
I like it here.

279
00:27:33,822 --> 00:27:35,866
I grew up here in Rosario.

280
00:27:36,172 --> 00:27:37,172
I see.

281
00:27:37,601 --> 00:27:39,087
And I...

282
00:27:41,188 --> 00:27:44,188
I don't think I can live
apart from my sisters.

283
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:49,243
I get that.

284
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:54,423
Let me get you some more.

285
00:27:55,535 --> 00:27:56,535
Lea!

286
00:28:07,089 --> 00:28:08,089
Felipe...

287
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:14,403
I hope you don't do
something you'll regret.

288
00:28:15,472 --> 00:28:17,474
You don't know what I'm capable of.

289
00:28:17,985 --> 00:28:19,309
You don't trust me.

290
00:28:21,353 --> 00:28:22,521
I understand.

291
00:28:23,605 --> 00:28:26,024
I hope I can prove
that I'm a good person.

292
00:28:28,485 --> 00:28:29,485
I hope so too.

293
00:28:42,249 --> 00:28:43,959
May I have your attention!

294
00:28:44,376 --> 00:28:47,376
We regret to inform you that this
marketplace will be temporarily shut down.

295
00:28:48,463 --> 00:28:52,009
We have received reports
that suspicious individuals,

296
00:28:52,034 --> 00:28:53,274
have been sighted staying here.

297
00:28:54,145 --> 00:28:56,321
It's best to take these precautions.

298
00:28:57,055 --> 00:28:59,558
As there might be rebels among us.

299
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,602
We ask everyone buying,

300
00:29:03,603 --> 00:29:06,148
To quickly conclude their
business and go home.

301
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,528
What about you ma'am?

302
00:29:12,362 --> 00:29:14,031
Are you done stocking up?

303
00:29:15,632 --> 00:29:19,094
We can take you to another
marketplace if you need any more.

304
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:21,179
We have enough, thank you.

305
00:29:21,204 --> 00:29:22,873
We should go, Sonya.

306
00:29:22,898 --> 00:29:24,357
Let's go home.

307
00:29:28,503 --> 00:29:31,438
Sorry to come on such short notice.

308
00:29:32,174 --> 00:29:34,829
But I just wanted to do this in person.

309
00:29:36,136 --> 00:29:39,473
I have good news to
share and hand over.

310
00:29:42,925 --> 00:29:48,774
Here I have the deed
to your lands in San Pablo.

311
00:29:48,774 --> 00:29:50,689
Take it! Look!

312
00:29:51,558 --> 00:29:53,150
That's clean.

313
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:56,234
Thank you, Attorney.

314
00:29:56,431 --> 00:29:58,947
Apologies for the delay.

315
00:29:59,342 --> 00:30:00,802
It's because of a...

316
00:30:00,827 --> 00:30:03,285
An old case...

317
00:30:03,605 --> 00:30:06,108
Against Don Fidel.

318
00:30:07,459 --> 00:30:08,916
It's true! And...

319
00:30:09,361 --> 00:30:12,697
They claimed that your
father did not own the land.

320
00:30:14,826 --> 00:30:16,048
But...

321
00:30:16,338 --> 00:30:19,091
The claimant died.

322
00:30:19,116 --> 00:30:21,702
And their heirs were never found.

323
00:30:21,882 --> 00:30:26,308
So the whole thing fell through.

324
00:30:27,979 --> 00:30:29,648
Thank you, Attorney.

325
00:30:30,148 --> 00:30:31,148
Wait,

326
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:33,441
we don't understand any of this.

327
00:30:33,777 --> 00:30:36,985
This is exactly why we're asking you now...

328
00:30:37,823 --> 00:30:41,031
We want you to have time to move.

329
00:30:41,329 --> 00:30:43,206
We are giving you seven days,

330
00:30:43,231 --> 00:30:46,161
To arrange your departure
and move your belongings.

331
00:30:46,414 --> 00:30:49,167
But how is the land still not ours?

332
00:30:50,102 --> 00:30:53,271
We have been farmers
here all of our lives.

333
00:30:53,296 --> 00:30:54,464
This land is ours.

334
00:30:55,249 --> 00:30:56,870
This is the agreement,

335
00:30:57,025 --> 00:30:59,361
This states that you've agreed,

336
00:30:59,386 --> 00:31:01,198
From this day forward,

337
00:31:01,555 --> 00:31:04,763
That all of this now
belongs to Don Fidel.

338
00:31:05,809 --> 00:31:07,391
I never agreed to this.

339
00:31:07,727 --> 00:31:09,351
There must be some mistake.

340
00:31:09,938 --> 00:31:10,938
Don Fidel!

341
00:31:11,815 --> 00:31:13,438
Please don't do this!

342
00:31:14,192 --> 00:31:17,445
- Have mercy!
- We don't have anywhere to go!

343
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:18,958
Mother, Father...

344
00:31:19,256 --> 00:31:20,632
What is happening?

345
00:31:20,657 --> 00:31:22,325
The agreement still holds.

346
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:24,950
Please comply to avoid complications.

347
00:31:26,163 --> 00:31:27,619
Let us go, Don Fidel.

348
00:32:27,098 --> 00:32:28,668
Why can't we...

349
00:32:29,492 --> 00:32:31,453
Just stay in your room?

350
00:32:31,478 --> 00:32:33,063
Your sisters are both asleep anyway.

351
00:32:34,814 --> 00:32:36,629
We have to be cautious.

352
00:32:39,294 --> 00:32:41,652
This place smells like shit.

353
00:32:41,677 --> 00:32:43,156
It's putting me off.

354
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:49,152
What's wrong? Why are you on edge?

355
00:32:50,455 --> 00:32:51,498
Why not?

356
00:32:51,498 --> 00:32:52,749
All this time,

357
00:32:52,749 --> 00:32:54,125
And we haven't even caught one.

358
00:32:54,125 --> 00:32:56,051
And we know the rebels are here.

359
00:32:56,586 --> 00:32:58,277
Filthy scum.

360
00:32:58,922 --> 00:33:01,383
What about the other towns?
Didn't you find anything there?

361
00:33:02,384 --> 00:33:03,635
What do you think?

362
00:33:03,635 --> 00:33:04,761
Of course we did.

363
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:07,472
We must have hit
at least one of them,

364
00:33:07,497 --> 00:33:09,249
We won that recent engagement.

365
00:33:09,874 --> 00:33:11,251
And I never miss.

366
00:33:14,437 --> 00:33:17,996
By the way, I asked my CO and...

367
00:33:18,166 --> 00:33:22,170
He put Villa Paraiso on my watch.

368
00:33:22,195 --> 00:33:24,531
So, if you see anyone suspicious,

369
00:33:24,556 --> 00:33:26,998
You'll tell me, right?

370
00:33:28,218 --> 00:33:31,137
Why don't you just leave them be?

371
00:33:31,162 --> 00:33:33,581
Because they always have some crusade,

372
00:33:33,606 --> 00:33:35,324
Even when it's over nothing.

373
00:33:35,709 --> 00:33:37,460
They'll always have some complaint,

374
00:33:37,485 --> 00:33:39,112
With whoever's in power.

375
00:33:39,754 --> 00:33:41,461
All I care about,

376
00:33:41,798 --> 00:33:43,717
Is snuffing them out.

377
00:33:44,884 --> 00:33:46,261
After that...

378
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:49,556
I'll finally be assigned someplace else.

379
00:33:50,324 --> 00:33:52,535
I can't stand Rosario anymore.

380
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:53,559
What?

381
00:33:55,812 --> 00:33:57,272
Don't worry...

382
00:33:58,773 --> 00:34:00,233
I'll come around to see you.

383
00:34:02,027 --> 00:34:03,816
I will always come back for you.

384
00:36:23,626 --> 00:36:25,628
Oh, Felipe, come sit!

385
00:36:25,628 --> 00:36:27,881
Ester, I can do that,
Thank you. Let me do it.

386
00:36:27,881 --> 00:36:29,257
Thank you.

387
00:36:43,563 --> 00:36:44,563
Eat.

388
00:36:45,106 --> 00:36:46,396
Thank you.

389
00:37:08,087 --> 00:37:09,087
Thank you, Lea.

390
00:37:16,679 --> 00:37:17,880
Thank you three.

391
00:37:18,348 --> 00:37:20,732
The food is always great.

392
00:37:28,399 --> 00:37:29,859
I think I should,

393
00:37:29,892 --> 00:37:32,762
Introduce myself formally.

394
00:37:34,072 --> 00:37:35,448
I am...

395
00:37:37,116 --> 00:37:39,491
I am Felipe Dela Paz.

396
00:37:39,661 --> 00:37:41,037
That's my full name.

397
00:37:42,372 --> 00:37:45,205
I came to Rosario on vacation.

398
00:37:46,084 --> 00:37:49,459
I went hiking before I
was to go back to Manila.

399
00:37:50,022 --> 00:37:51,144
But then...

400
00:37:51,631 --> 00:37:52,757
This happened.

401
00:37:54,008 --> 00:37:55,368
I apologize for the inconvenience.

402
00:37:56,719 --> 00:37:59,844
I think we should
inform the police.

403
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:02,602
So they can track down
whoever did this to you.

404
00:38:03,309 --> 00:38:04,352
Lea, let's not.

405
00:38:06,938 --> 00:38:08,687
Sonya's right.

406
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:10,647
That might be risky.

407
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:13,778
I haven't been back
here in a while.

408
00:38:15,113 --> 00:38:17,445
They might mark me as a rebel.

409
00:38:18,032 --> 00:38:20,365
You know how their brains work...

410
00:38:21,744 --> 00:38:22,744
All gunpowder.

411
00:38:28,918 --> 00:38:31,126
We'll wait for you to recover.

412
00:38:34,173 --> 00:38:36,548
Ester, Lea...

413
00:38:36,884 --> 00:38:40,802
It's better if no one
knows about our guest.

414
00:38:44,183 --> 00:38:45,849
Thank you very much, Sonya.

415
00:38:46,227 --> 00:38:47,227
Eat.

416
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,646
Thank you.

417
00:38:49,606 --> 00:38:50,886
- Have more rice.
- This is good.

418
00:39:19,052 --> 00:39:21,054
Are you okay, Felipe?

419
00:39:22,321 --> 00:39:24,198
Lea, if you don't mind,

420
00:39:25,016 --> 00:39:26,468
Would you hand me the scrubber?

421
00:39:26,628 --> 00:39:27,796
It's a little hard to turn.

422
00:39:42,158 --> 00:39:43,242
Here?

423
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,556
That's enough.

424
00:40:05,556 --> 00:40:07,433
Thank you.

425
00:40:13,022 --> 00:40:14,114
Lea,

426
00:40:14,139 --> 00:40:17,226
Sonya's been looking for you.

427
00:40:17,251 --> 00:40:18,251
Go now.

428
00:40:26,619 --> 00:40:29,536
Do you still need help?

429
00:40:30,073 --> 00:40:31,825
I'm okay now, Ester.

430
00:40:31,850 --> 00:40:32,892
I can handle this.

431
00:42:07,553 --> 00:42:08,930
What are you doing?

432
00:42:11,265 --> 00:42:12,433
What's the meaning of this?

433
00:42:13,476 --> 00:42:14,972
Why do you have my money?

434
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,080
I don't know what you're talking about.

435
00:42:17,104 --> 00:42:18,981
I don't know how that got there.

436
00:42:21,943 --> 00:42:23,903
You're insatiable aren't you?

437
00:42:24,796 --> 00:42:26,631
You already have your share,

438
00:42:26,656 --> 00:42:28,282
And your savings,

439
00:42:28,307 --> 00:42:30,440
Now you want what's mine?!

440
00:42:32,161 --> 00:42:33,871
Why're you always on my case?

441
00:42:34,705 --> 00:42:36,386
Why don't you ask Lea?

442
00:42:40,253 --> 00:42:41,170
Ester?!

443
00:42:41,195 --> 00:42:43,518
What would Lea even
do with the money?

444
00:42:43,879 --> 00:42:46,839
Isn't it proof enough that this
is in your panties?

445
00:42:47,468 --> 00:42:50,011
You have no right to treat me this way.

446
00:42:50,388 --> 00:42:51,848
You might have put that in there,

447
00:42:51,873 --> 00:42:53,792
Just to have a reason to fight me.

448
00:42:54,517 --> 00:42:55,628
You know...

449
00:42:55,910 --> 00:42:57,954
Being the eldest...

450
00:42:57,979 --> 00:42:59,438
Nor being the one feeding us,

451
00:42:59,463 --> 00:43:00,722
Doesn't give you
the right to be like this.

452
00:43:01,415 --> 00:43:02,808
You don't have to worry,

453
00:43:03,025 --> 00:43:05,464
I'll be gone soon anyway.

454
00:43:06,612 --> 00:43:07,997
And I don't need you.

455
00:43:08,022 --> 00:43:09,729
I can take care of myself.

456
00:43:11,426 --> 00:43:13,253
I can feed and clothe myself.

457
00:43:13,619 --> 00:43:16,542
And you won't have to give
me a thing from this house.

458
00:43:16,848 --> 00:43:18,808
I don't want to have
to owe you anything!

459
00:43:18,833 --> 00:43:20,792
Enough, of this please.

460
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,136
How brave...

461
00:43:22,681 --> 00:43:24,224
Let go of me Lea!

462
00:43:28,217 --> 00:43:29,635
Look at your sister!

463
00:43:29,635 --> 00:43:31,479
See how big her head is?!

464
00:43:31,504 --> 00:43:33,839
Just because you got
what you wanted?!

465
00:43:33,931 --> 00:43:35,725
All this cash?!

466
00:43:36,684 --> 00:43:38,811
Take it all and eat it!

467
00:43:38,811 --> 00:43:40,146
I will!

468
00:44:10,676 --> 00:44:11,966
Ester!

469
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:14,238
Let's eat together!

470
00:44:14,263 --> 00:44:16,474
I've been waiting
for you to wake up.

471
00:44:18,059 --> 00:44:19,310
Just need to finish this.

472
00:44:20,061 --> 00:44:21,061
What's the occasion?

473
00:44:23,105 --> 00:44:24,105
Oh, nothing.

474
00:44:26,192 --> 00:44:28,069
I just thought it'd be nice,

475
00:44:28,069 --> 00:44:30,173
To cook breakfast for everyone.

476
00:44:31,113 --> 00:44:34,700
Sonya and Lea have eaten already
before they went to the market.

477
00:44:40,289 --> 00:44:41,289
Coffee.

478
00:44:54,512 --> 00:44:57,431
You know, even though I've
only known you a short time,

479
00:44:58,163 --> 00:45:00,791
I know you'd never do
what you're accused of.

480
00:45:02,315 --> 00:45:04,352
I'm always in her sights.

481
00:45:05,189 --> 00:45:07,149
Did she even consider
that Lea could have done it?

482
00:45:07,441 --> 00:45:08,441
No she didn't.

483
00:45:08,609 --> 00:45:11,204
I think she honestly
forgot where she put it.

484
00:45:11,946 --> 00:45:13,406
It happens when you get older.

485
00:45:13,406 --> 00:45:14,949
It happens when you don't get laid.

486
00:45:27,545 --> 00:45:29,255
Are you doing anything today?

487
00:45:29,255 --> 00:45:30,615
Do you want to do something today?

488
00:45:35,177 --> 00:45:36,053
What about Lea?

489
00:45:36,053 --> 00:45:37,516
What's the story with her?

490
00:45:38,994 --> 00:45:40,287
Is she taken?

491
00:45:40,474 --> 00:45:42,798
Why are you so interested in her?

492
00:45:44,979 --> 00:45:45,979
No reason.

493
00:45:46,188 --> 00:45:48,190
She's the quietest
out of you three, so...

494
00:45:48,215 --> 00:45:49,215
I mean not like this.

495
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:50,900
One on one.

496
00:45:52,514 --> 00:45:55,272
I wouldn't be surprised if she
ends up like the Virgin Mary.

497
00:45:55,795 --> 00:45:57,742
Only the Holy Spirit
has a chance with her,

498
00:45:57,767 --> 00:46:00,397
Because she isn't at
all interested in boys.

499
00:46:01,328 --> 00:46:03,069
But if I was her age...

500
00:46:04,358 --> 00:46:06,381
I wouldn't waste my youth.

501
00:46:07,944 --> 00:46:10,437
I'd look for someone who'll marry me,

502
00:46:10,462 --> 00:46:12,163
While someone will take me.

503
00:46:14,717 --> 00:46:16,423
Don't be so harsh on yourself.

504
00:46:16,802 --> 00:46:18,342
You're still young.

505
00:46:18,537 --> 00:46:19,937
There'll be plenty who'll take you.

506
00:46:20,723 --> 00:46:21,932
Will you?

507
00:46:29,349 --> 00:46:31,772
Why not? Will someone get angry?

508
00:46:40,701 --> 00:46:42,334
Yeah, this will.

509
00:48:06,370 --> 00:48:07,955
Where have you been?

510
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:10,316
We've been worried sick.

511
00:48:10,958 --> 00:48:12,290
I'm sorry Sonya,

512
00:48:13,294 --> 00:48:15,379
We just thought that,

513
00:48:15,379 --> 00:48:16,672
It'd be nice to get some air.

514
00:48:17,381 --> 00:48:18,879
We lost track of time because,

515
00:48:19,258 --> 00:48:20,342
We were telling stories.

516
00:48:21,886 --> 00:48:23,175
What's for dinner?

517
00:48:23,512 --> 00:48:24,512
Kare-kare.

518
00:48:24,722 --> 00:48:26,887
You know I'm allergic to peanuts!

519
00:48:28,434 --> 00:48:30,790
I thought you could feed yourself?

520
00:48:31,228 --> 00:48:33,977
Didn't I tell you to eat your money?

521
00:48:37,943 --> 00:48:39,278
Lea,

522
00:48:39,278 --> 00:48:40,321
Let me help you with that.

523
00:48:41,822 --> 00:48:42,865
Thank you.

524
00:49:07,890 --> 00:49:09,308
Come in.

525
00:49:42,466 --> 00:49:44,340
You missed me already?

526
00:49:44,677 --> 00:49:46,967
This will feel better with oil,

527
00:49:47,346 --> 00:49:50,221
I have some on the table.

528
00:49:50,547 --> 00:49:51,568
I'll get it.

529
00:49:51,857 --> 00:49:52,913
Go ahead.

530
00:52:00,062 --> 00:52:03,065
What's this? It itches!

531
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:07,403
Ouch, it hurts!

532
00:52:09,113 --> 00:52:10,864
It hurts!

533
00:52:11,615 --> 00:52:13,367
It itches.

534
00:52:15,994 --> 00:52:17,746
Ester!

535
00:52:20,165 --> 00:52:21,598
What did you do to Ester?

536
00:52:22,501 --> 00:52:23,668
I didn't do anything!

537
00:52:25,712 --> 00:52:27,950
This isn't what I use on you!

538
00:52:30,676 --> 00:52:32,219
It really itches!

539
00:52:32,244 --> 00:52:33,950
Why'd this happen?

540
00:52:34,555 --> 00:52:35,681
Why does it...

541
00:52:37,245 --> 00:52:38,676
It smells like peanuts.

542
00:52:38,986 --> 00:52:40,113
Why does it...

543
00:52:40,169 --> 00:52:41,692
Wait, stop! Don't scratch!

544
00:52:42,104 --> 00:52:43,105
But it itches!

545
00:52:43,130 --> 00:52:45,504
Lea, I have meds
in my room. Go get them.

546
00:52:46,567 --> 00:52:47,359
What?

547
00:52:47,384 --> 00:52:49,090
You feel bad for me now?!

548
00:52:51,255 --> 00:52:52,423
What the hell is this?

549
00:52:52,448 --> 00:52:54,411
I didn't have anything
to do with this, Ester.

550
00:52:54,436 --> 00:52:55,401
Then what's all this?

551
00:52:55,426 --> 00:52:56,702
I hate this life!

552
00:52:56,727 --> 00:52:59,161
Now you're trying to
kill me out of spite?

553
00:52:59,392 --> 00:53:00,935
Please believe me,

554
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:02,654
I don't know where that came from.

555
00:53:02,749 --> 00:53:03,834
Wow, so it's magic?!

556
00:53:04,668 --> 00:53:06,211
I'm not a fool, Sonya!

557
00:53:06,211 --> 00:53:07,713
That's enough, you two!

558
00:53:07,713 --> 00:53:09,223
Stop acting like children!

559
00:53:13,594 --> 00:53:14,594
Take this.

560
00:53:34,156 --> 00:53:35,487
Do you need anything?

561
00:53:35,991 --> 00:53:36,991
No I don't.

562
00:53:37,534 --> 00:53:38,866
Just having trouble sleeping.

563
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:40,621
I needed some air.

564
00:53:42,164 --> 00:53:43,832
Here, want some?

565
00:53:44,708 --> 00:53:45,334
Sure.

566
00:53:45,709 --> 00:53:46,919
What about you?

567
00:53:46,919 --> 00:53:48,712
Did you put away
half the bottle?

568
00:53:49,796 --> 00:53:51,381
Felipe, tell me...

569
00:53:53,091 --> 00:53:54,635
Do you have siblings?

570
00:53:58,430 --> 00:53:59,430
No I don't.

571
00:54:00,599 --> 00:54:01,767
I'm an only child.

572
00:54:04,436 --> 00:54:07,314
So you haven't experienced these...

573
00:54:07,314 --> 00:54:09,355
Fights we've been having?

574
00:54:17,157 --> 00:54:18,992
But you know?

575
00:54:20,285 --> 00:54:22,746
Even when we fight a lot,

576
00:54:22,746 --> 00:54:25,207
I still love Ester so much.

577
00:54:26,208 --> 00:54:27,748
To be honest,

578
00:54:28,001 --> 00:54:30,337
I'm jealous of her and Lea.

579
00:54:31,271 --> 00:54:34,358
Take Ester for example,

580
00:54:34,383 --> 00:54:36,677
If she wants something,

581
00:54:36,702 --> 00:54:39,413
She'll stop at nothing to get it.

582
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:42,429
When she doesn't like something,

583
00:54:42,683 --> 00:54:44,473
She'll say it outright.

584
00:54:44,810 --> 00:54:46,937
She's the bravest woman I know.

585
00:54:48,817 --> 00:54:51,611
I think she got that from our father.

586
00:54:57,239 --> 00:54:58,657
But sometimes,

587
00:54:58,682 --> 00:55:02,227
She'll get carried away,
and gets hurt in the process.

588
00:55:02,953 --> 00:55:04,243
And...

589
00:55:04,564 --> 00:55:06,062
As for Lea,

590
00:55:06,582 --> 00:55:08,333
Because she's the youngest,

591
00:55:09,626 --> 00:55:11,503
She never dealt with...

592
00:55:11,528 --> 00:55:14,906
Much responsibility like Ester and I did.

593
00:55:15,632 --> 00:55:18,215
Our mother passed
early in our lives.

594
00:55:18,719 --> 00:55:20,592
When Lea was born.

595
00:55:21,638 --> 00:55:24,558
Ester and I brought her up.

596
00:55:28,604 --> 00:55:31,189
You know, I miss
our mother so much.

597
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,669
I remember her telling me...

598
00:55:35,694 --> 00:55:37,988
To take care of my sisters...

599
00:55:38,447 --> 00:55:40,782
The way she took care of me.

600
00:55:44,828 --> 00:55:46,280
You know Felipe...

601
00:55:47,998 --> 00:55:51,126
I hope someday, they'll understand,

602
00:55:51,126 --> 00:55:53,378
Why I had to be strict with them.

603
00:55:56,757 --> 00:55:59,760
I hope they see that,
I truly love them.

604
00:56:03,055 --> 00:56:06,058
Don't know what
I'd do if they get hurt.

605
00:56:08,143 --> 00:56:10,020
It would kill me, Felipe.

606
00:56:16,216 --> 00:56:17,676
Oh God...

607
00:56:18,904 --> 00:56:20,906
Why am I crying?

608
00:56:20,906 --> 00:56:22,491
Have another drink.

609
00:56:36,380 --> 00:56:39,383
Oh... no wonder.

610
00:56:41,385 --> 00:56:44,221
This is why you've been
watching my every move.

611
00:56:44,971 --> 00:56:46,556
You've been planning this all along.

612
00:56:46,556 --> 00:56:48,475
Ester, why are you
having such dirty thoughts?

613
00:56:48,475 --> 00:56:50,519
Ester, it's not what you think.
We're just talking here.

614
00:56:50,519 --> 00:56:51,520
You deserve each other!

615
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:52,520
Ester!

616
00:57:01,696 --> 00:57:02,823
You okay?

617
00:58:24,041 --> 00:58:26,156
We're alone now.

618
00:58:26,156 --> 00:58:27,932
They're in town.

619
00:58:28,992 --> 00:58:30,410
And...

620
00:58:30,410 --> 00:58:31,828
I've recovered, see?

621
00:58:36,166 --> 00:58:38,001
I'm sorry for
the other night.

622
00:58:38,001 --> 00:58:39,461
I didn't take it well.

623
00:58:40,629 --> 00:58:42,130
But I gave it some thought and,

624
00:58:42,155 --> 00:58:44,283
I know you'd never get with Sonya.

625
00:59:18,275 --> 00:59:20,319
Wait, stop.

626
00:59:21,044 --> 00:59:22,212
What's wrong?

627
00:59:27,592 --> 00:59:30,345
I just thought of your sisters.

628
00:59:30,345 --> 00:59:32,722
What do they have to do with us?

629
00:59:32,722 --> 00:59:34,766
- Nothing.
- Did Sonya say something?

630
00:59:34,766 --> 00:59:35,934
No, she didn't.

631
00:59:35,934 --> 00:59:38,228
I just don't want to break their trust.

632
00:59:38,228 --> 00:59:39,521
That's all.

633
00:59:55,537 --> 00:59:57,205
So, did you eat your fill?

634
00:59:57,205 --> 00:59:59,082
Of course I did.

635
00:59:59,708 --> 01:00:01,084
Good, good.

636
01:00:01,084 --> 01:00:03,670
I'll get you more next time!

637
01:00:04,045 --> 01:00:06,631
Next time, let's bring Ester along.

638
01:00:06,631 --> 01:00:08,508
Yeah, that would be fun.

639
01:00:10,073 --> 01:00:12,376
What are you trying to do, Sonya?

640
01:00:12,401 --> 01:00:13,930
Ester! What are you doing?!

641
01:00:13,955 --> 01:00:15,557
Ester! Stop it!

642
01:00:17,142 --> 01:00:19,227
Why do you have to meddle...

643
01:00:19,227 --> 01:00:21,021
In my private life?!

644
01:00:21,021 --> 01:00:23,148
Don't you have anything better to do?

645
01:00:27,068 --> 01:00:28,528
What are you talking about?

646
01:00:37,954 --> 01:00:39,497
Felipe...

647
01:00:39,497 --> 01:00:40,957
Admit it...

648
01:00:40,957 --> 01:00:42,417
What did Sonya tell you?

649
01:00:43,043 --> 01:00:45,003
Wait, what's going on?

650
01:00:45,003 --> 01:00:46,296
See?

651
01:00:46,296 --> 01:00:48,565
Even Felipe's too scared to speak out.

652
01:00:49,507 --> 01:00:51,718
Whatever's between me and Felipe...

653
01:00:51,718 --> 01:00:52,802
is none of your business!

654
01:00:52,802 --> 01:00:53,887
Stop meddling!

655
01:00:57,933 --> 01:00:59,143
Ester...

656
01:01:00,143 --> 01:01:03,182
I never wanted anything
but a good life for you.

657
01:01:05,182 --> 01:01:06,975
While you live here,

658
01:01:07,061 --> 01:01:09,776
I want you to respect
me and my rules!

659
01:01:11,180 --> 01:01:12,838
I'm your sister!

660
01:01:13,127 --> 01:01:14,670
I'm not your enemy here.

661
01:01:16,551 --> 01:01:19,262
I have the right to choose
what's best for you.

662
01:01:19,287 --> 01:01:20,872
As long as it's for your own good.

663
01:01:20,897 --> 01:01:23,186
And how would you
know what's good for me?

664
01:01:24,584 --> 01:01:26,178
This exactly your problem...

665
01:01:26,273 --> 01:01:28,319
You never even consider us...

666
01:01:28,672 --> 01:01:30,131
And you're always right!

667
01:01:31,216 --> 01:01:32,624
When was the last time...

668
01:01:33,051 --> 01:01:35,011
You asked me what I wanted?

669
01:01:41,142 --> 01:01:42,142
Alright.

670
01:01:43,228 --> 01:01:44,354
If that's what you want.

671
01:01:46,106 --> 01:01:48,191
You're free to do whatever you want.

672
01:01:49,859 --> 01:01:50,859
From now on...

673
01:01:51,778 --> 01:01:53,822
I'm not going to meddle in your life!

674
01:01:56,545 --> 01:01:57,797
Just as well...

675
01:01:57,993 --> 01:02:00,412
You'll get your inheritance soon.

676
01:02:01,788 --> 01:02:03,289
Remember this day.

677
01:02:05,083 --> 01:02:06,960
We're not sisters any more.

678
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:08,837
So go live your own damn life!

679
01:02:10,588 --> 01:02:11,588
Good!

680
01:02:11,613 --> 01:02:13,100
I hate this life!

681
01:02:32,986 --> 01:02:33,986
Lea...

682
01:02:35,196 --> 01:02:36,196
Lea...

683
01:02:36,990 --> 01:02:37,990
Lea...

684
01:02:38,408 --> 01:02:39,408
Lea, wait!

685
01:02:47,083 --> 01:02:48,210
You know...

686
01:02:48,668 --> 01:02:50,336
When we were young...

687
01:02:51,129 --> 01:02:52,797
Whenever they'd fight...

688
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:55,508
I'd come here.

689
01:02:56,134 --> 01:02:57,135
This place...

690
01:02:57,886 --> 01:02:59,345
It calms me.

691
01:03:01,056 --> 01:03:03,266
Nobody was there to comfort me.

692
01:03:07,181 --> 01:03:09,309
I'd lie down...

693
01:03:09,481 --> 01:03:10,899
And look at the stars.

694
01:03:12,067 --> 01:03:15,487
It's like all the noise
and troubles stop existing.

695
01:03:17,697 --> 01:03:20,033
I haven't looked up in a while.

696
01:03:21,159 --> 01:03:22,786
It does lift the spirits.

697
01:03:24,913 --> 01:03:27,061
I'm waiting for a shooting star.

698
01:03:27,707 --> 01:03:29,000
What would you wish for?

699
01:03:30,835 --> 01:03:31,961
I wish they'd,

700
01:03:31,961 --> 01:03:33,797
Finally resolve their differences.

701
01:03:34,339 --> 01:03:36,466
And never fight again.

702
01:03:39,344 --> 01:03:40,678
To be honest,

703
01:03:41,679 --> 01:03:43,723
I'm jealous of them,

704
01:03:44,599 --> 01:03:47,185
Because they had
all this time together.

705
01:03:48,228 --> 01:03:49,896
They grew up together.

706
01:03:50,855 --> 01:03:51,981
And...

707
01:03:53,608 --> 01:03:55,527
They got to know our mom.

708
01:04:00,115 --> 01:04:01,366
Felipe...

709
01:04:01,366 --> 01:04:02,366
Yeah?

710
01:04:02,534 --> 01:04:04,661
Tell me the truth...

711
01:04:05,036 --> 01:04:06,036
What do you mean?

712
01:04:07,064 --> 01:04:09,629
Is there something
between you and Ester?

713
01:04:22,137 --> 01:04:23,137
Nothing.

714
01:04:24,222 --> 01:04:26,015
There's nothing between us.

715
01:04:30,854 --> 01:04:31,854
But...

716
01:04:33,064 --> 01:04:34,440
Do you like her?

717
01:04:37,986 --> 01:04:38,986
I don't.

718
01:04:45,118 --> 01:04:46,327
I like someone else.

719
01:04:48,830 --> 01:04:49,830
Who?

720
01:05:18,693 --> 01:05:21,401
If we don't see any shooting stars,

721
01:05:22,780 --> 01:05:23,945
I promise,

722
01:05:25,992 --> 01:05:28,158
I'll help make your wish come true.

723
01:09:44,041 --> 01:09:51,299
To get it in first gear,
you have to depress the clutch,

724
01:09:51,299 --> 01:09:55,178
Yeah like that, but slowly.

725
01:09:55,887 --> 01:09:58,389
Then put your foot on the accelerator.

726
01:10:01,058 --> 01:10:02,862
Ah, like this?

727
01:10:11,697 --> 01:10:12,817
Did you do it?

728
01:10:17,979 --> 01:10:18,979
Yes.

729
01:10:21,259 --> 01:10:24,523
Good. I can't go to you yet,
we're at the next town.

730
01:10:30,296 --> 01:10:31,631
Felipe...

731
01:10:31,631 --> 01:10:34,509
Would you get some
coconut milk from the back?

732
01:10:45,102 --> 01:10:46,102
Kiss me first.

733
01:10:47,271 --> 01:10:49,346
Just go get it, hurry.

734
01:10:50,775 --> 01:10:51,775
Yeah, alright.

735
01:11:14,882 --> 01:11:15,883
Ester...

736
01:11:18,302 --> 01:11:19,470
Can I pass?

737
01:11:19,470 --> 01:11:20,763
I'll just get the basin.

738
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:28,520
Ester...

739
01:11:30,087 --> 01:11:31,922
I know that...

740
01:11:32,070 --> 01:11:34,320
No matter how many
times I ask for forgiveness...

741
01:11:35,486 --> 01:11:37,405
It'd be unfair for you
to give it so soon.

742
01:11:39,198 --> 01:11:41,367
But I hope one day...

743
01:11:41,367 --> 01:11:42,785
You'll be able to...

744
01:11:44,412 --> 01:11:46,205
Forgive me.

745
01:11:46,205 --> 01:11:48,749
Felipe! Where's the coconut milk?

746
01:11:56,215 --> 01:11:57,216
Alright...

747
01:12:08,769 --> 01:12:10,813
Here it comes!

748
01:12:14,650 --> 01:12:16,110
There!

749
01:12:17,236 --> 01:12:18,863
It looks great!

750
01:12:18,888 --> 01:12:19,888
Of course!

751
01:12:19,913 --> 01:12:23,375
I'm positive that
with just one bite...

752
01:12:23,451 --> 01:12:25,620
You won't be able to sleep

753
01:12:25,620 --> 01:12:27,496
Thinking about this.

754
01:12:28,581 --> 01:12:31,422
Oh wow, look who grew an ego!

755
01:12:31,447 --> 01:12:33,078
Really? Let's have a taste.

756
01:12:41,260 --> 01:12:43,211
I haven't tasted anything this good.

757
01:12:44,472 --> 01:12:47,099
Ester! Have some!

758
01:12:47,099 --> 01:12:48,893
Isn't this your favorite?

759
01:12:48,918 --> 01:12:50,328
Ginataang Mais.

760
01:12:53,483 --> 01:12:55,082
Ester, come on, have some.

761
01:12:55,107 --> 01:12:56,108
Thank you.

762
01:12:56,133 --> 01:12:57,797
By the way Felipe...

763
01:12:58,944 --> 01:13:00,738
If it's not too much trouble,

764
01:13:00,763 --> 01:13:04,767
Maybe you could go with
Lea to the market tomorrow.

765
01:13:08,704 --> 01:13:10,373
I'm feeling a bit sore,

766
01:13:10,398 --> 01:13:13,470
I might not be able to drive
and carry things for her.

767
01:13:15,127 --> 01:13:16,420
Here, have some rice.

768
01:13:17,421 --> 01:13:18,547
And...

769
01:13:19,090 --> 01:13:22,320
I heard the soldiers have
pulled out of the marketplace.

770
01:13:22,635 --> 01:13:25,125
They've moved on to a different town.

771
01:13:26,305 --> 01:13:28,961
It seems they didn't find
whoever they were looking for.

772
01:13:29,892 --> 01:13:31,268
I'm coming along.

773
01:13:31,293 --> 01:13:33,727
Lea might forget
to buy some things.

774
01:13:34,931 --> 01:13:35,973
Ester, it's fine.

775
01:13:35,998 --> 01:13:37,453
Felipe'll be there.

776
01:13:37,865 --> 01:13:41,016
I might need you here with me.

777
01:13:41,696 --> 01:13:44,399
I thought we weren't
supposed to trust strangers?

778
01:13:45,074 --> 01:13:47,250
Why does it seem like
I'm the one you don't trust?

779
01:13:49,078 --> 01:13:50,871
He should be healed by now.

780
01:13:51,497 --> 01:13:52,790
Why is he still here?

781
01:13:53,207 --> 01:13:54,709
- Ester!
- Hey!

782
01:13:54,734 --> 01:13:55,734
What?

783
01:13:56,168 --> 01:13:57,168
Ester...

784
01:13:58,629 --> 01:13:59,880
Lea and I are together now.

785
01:14:00,381 --> 01:14:01,381
What?!

786
01:14:03,926 --> 01:14:04,926
You knew about this?

787
01:14:06,637 --> 01:14:08,891
How was I the last to know?

788
01:14:10,416 --> 01:14:12,293
What even is my place here?!

789
01:14:13,978 --> 01:14:14,978
Please...

790
01:14:15,954 --> 01:14:18,373
We really wanted to tell you...

791
01:14:18,858 --> 01:14:21,402
But, there was never a right time.

792
01:14:22,528 --> 01:14:24,530
We knew you'd react this way.

793
01:14:49,472 --> 01:14:50,472
Lea?!

794
01:14:52,433 --> 01:14:53,433
What happened?

795
01:14:55,728 --> 01:14:57,772
Stay there, I'm getting the first aid kit.

796
01:15:06,739 --> 01:15:07,739
What's that?

797
01:15:09,742 --> 01:15:10,742
Show me.

798
01:15:10,785 --> 01:15:11,785
Felipe.

799
01:15:15,414 --> 01:15:16,415
Glass?

800
01:15:20,377 --> 01:15:21,796
What happened?

801
01:15:21,796 --> 01:15:23,891
How did glass get in there?

802
01:15:25,591 --> 01:15:28,164
How could this happen?

803
01:15:28,427 --> 01:15:29,427
Wait...

804
01:15:34,725 --> 01:15:35,725
Hold on...

805
01:15:37,937 --> 01:15:38,854
Let me see.

806
01:15:38,854 --> 01:15:39,854
Say ah...

807
01:15:43,859 --> 01:15:44,859
There...

808
01:15:45,903 --> 01:15:48,280
Thank god it's not deep.

809
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:50,813
And your tongue is unscathed.

810
01:15:52,701 --> 01:15:54,787
I need to apply this.

811
01:15:54,787 --> 01:15:56,121
It'll get better faster.

812
01:15:59,708 --> 01:16:01,252
Take it easy,

813
01:16:02,461 --> 01:16:05,047
Bite down...

814
01:16:06,507 --> 01:16:07,507
There...

815
01:16:13,514 --> 01:16:16,100
Go to your room, Lea.
You should rest.

816
01:16:17,184 --> 01:16:19,770
Felipe, would you take her?

817
01:16:28,112 --> 01:16:31,664
Ester, you should go to
the market in Lea's stead.

818
01:16:44,475 --> 01:16:47,645
Oh wait, Sonya wanted
us to buy some laurel.

819
01:16:52,595 --> 01:16:55,383
Can we get a pack of laurel?

820
01:16:57,266 --> 01:16:59,672
Thank god, the soldiers are gone.

821
01:16:59,752 --> 01:17:00,544
God,

822
01:17:00,569 --> 01:17:03,530
They'd ask to get
my goods for free as if...

823
01:17:03,647 --> 01:17:07,318
We owe them for looking out for us.

824
01:17:08,002 --> 01:17:09,795
But they were the
ones killing our sales.

825
01:17:09,820 --> 01:17:11,947
The customers were all afraid.

826
01:17:11,972 --> 01:17:14,133
We do owe them that much.

827
01:17:14,158 --> 01:17:17,328
What if the rebels came for us?

828
01:17:17,353 --> 01:17:18,353
Really?!

829
01:17:18,746 --> 01:17:20,122
Do you really believe that load of crap?

830
01:17:20,147 --> 01:17:21,147
Here's what I owe.

831
01:17:21,258 --> 01:17:22,207
What's wrong with you?

832
01:17:22,207 --> 01:17:24,501
Do you really believe that rebels exist?

833
01:17:24,526 --> 01:17:27,156
They have nothing to show
for all their trouble!

834
01:17:27,504 --> 01:17:29,063
Are you that gullible?

835
01:17:29,088 --> 01:17:31,266
Hey Tomas!

836
01:17:31,383 --> 01:17:33,552
When did you get back?

837
01:17:35,554 --> 01:17:38,474
You must have the wrong guy,
His name is Felipe.

838
01:17:38,474 --> 01:17:40,517
No that's Tomas!

839
01:17:40,517 --> 01:17:42,269
Felipe was his father!

840
01:17:42,269 --> 01:17:44,229
You're Felipe Sta. Cruz's boy right?

841
01:17:44,229 --> 01:17:45,606
From San Pablo?

842
01:17:46,052 --> 01:17:48,679
I'm not mistaken!
I'm from there too!

843
01:17:48,704 --> 01:17:50,914
Sorry ma'am but you
have the wrong guy.

844
01:17:51,378 --> 01:17:53,547
Come Ester.
They might be waiting for us.

845
01:17:53,572 --> 01:17:54,448
Please excuse us.

846
01:17:54,473 --> 01:17:56,695
I'm not that person.

847
01:17:57,336 --> 01:17:58,994
Who is Tomas?

848
01:18:04,500 --> 01:18:05,793
Ester, about earlier...

849
01:18:06,627 --> 01:18:08,563
No one has to know.

850
01:18:10,422 --> 01:18:11,423
Thank you.

851
01:18:44,748 --> 01:18:47,156
Lea, how's your wound?

852
01:18:47,334 --> 01:18:49,086
Come, help me with this.

853
01:18:50,796 --> 01:18:51,796
Hey...

854
01:18:53,424 --> 01:18:54,258
Hey...

855
01:18:54,258 --> 01:18:55,258
What's wrong?

856
01:18:55,759 --> 01:18:57,531
Are you feeling unwell?

857
01:19:03,325 --> 01:19:05,244
The heat's just
getting to me, is all.

858
01:19:05,269 --> 01:19:07,146
I'll take a bath before dinner.

859
01:19:07,980 --> 01:19:08,980
Okay...

860
01:20:37,945 --> 01:20:40,030
Thank you, take a seat.

861
01:20:46,578 --> 01:20:48,747
Sonya, are you okay?

862
01:20:49,832 --> 01:20:50,958
It's nothing.

863
01:20:52,376 --> 01:20:53,866
Is it your stomach?

864
01:20:54,586 --> 01:20:58,340
Do you want me to
boil up banaba leaves?

865
01:20:58,340 --> 01:21:00,634
No need. I'm probably just hungry.

866
01:21:00,659 --> 01:21:02,147
Let's just eat.

867
01:21:09,101 --> 01:21:12,479
Come and eat Ester.

868
01:21:16,066 --> 01:21:18,569
Let's pray first. Lea?

869
01:21:20,696 --> 01:21:22,823
We thank you Lord,

870
01:21:22,823 --> 01:21:24,950
For the food on our table.

871
01:21:26,368 --> 01:21:28,662
Thank you also for...

872
01:21:29,989 --> 01:21:31,807
Keeping us together.

873
01:21:32,958 --> 01:21:35,377
And thank you Lord for...

874
01:21:37,553 --> 01:21:41,755
Having Felipe with us everyday.

875
01:21:42,217 --> 01:21:44,178
And we ask you Lord,

876
01:21:44,203 --> 01:21:47,496
For his honesty about who he really is.

877
01:21:48,140 --> 01:21:50,222
What is this Ester?

878
01:21:50,733 --> 01:21:52,609
Why don't we ask Felipe...

879
01:21:55,397 --> 01:21:56,231
I mean...

880
01:21:56,231 --> 01:21:57,482
Tomas.

881
01:21:58,609 --> 01:22:00,215
What's your real name?

882
01:22:02,905 --> 01:22:04,156
Felipe?

883
01:22:08,076 --> 01:22:10,403
Do you need help explaining?

884
01:22:18,962 --> 01:22:21,548
Sonya, Lea, I wanted to tell you,

885
01:22:21,548 --> 01:22:23,383
About who I really am.

886
01:22:23,383 --> 01:22:24,468
I was waiting for the right time.

887
01:22:24,468 --> 01:22:26,762
What aren't you telling us?

888
01:22:28,472 --> 01:22:30,140
Ester is right.

889
01:22:30,140 --> 01:22:32,142
Felipe isn't my real name.

890
01:22:36,605 --> 01:22:37,689
My name is Tomas.

891
01:22:39,066 --> 01:22:40,481
Tomas Sta. Cruz.

892
01:22:41,443 --> 01:22:43,445
I grew up in San Pablo.

893
01:22:43,470 --> 01:22:47,973
I was the only son born to
Marcia and Felipe Sta. Cruz.

894
01:22:49,258 --> 01:22:50,718
One day,

895
01:22:50,928 --> 01:22:53,305
I found my father lifeless.

896
01:22:53,330 --> 01:22:55,916
Covered in blood,
with a bullet in his chest.

897
01:22:55,916 --> 01:22:57,334
My mother told me,

898
01:22:57,693 --> 01:23:00,279
That it was the rebels.

899
01:23:01,505 --> 01:23:04,791
Days after he was buried.

900
01:23:04,816 --> 01:23:07,110
My mother followed soon after.

901
01:23:07,135 --> 01:23:09,012
My relatives told me...

902
01:23:09,037 --> 01:23:11,951
That it was the grief that killed her.

903
01:23:12,182 --> 01:23:14,685
They were together all their lives.

904
01:23:14,710 --> 01:23:17,584
They never fought or got separated.

905
01:23:18,355 --> 01:23:20,062
Even in death,

906
01:23:20,087 --> 01:23:22,272
They wanted to be together.

907
01:23:23,002 --> 01:23:25,046
In my anger,

908
01:23:25,170 --> 01:23:27,214
I joined the rebels.

909
01:23:27,239 --> 01:23:30,117
I wanted them to pay
for what they've done.

910
01:23:31,814 --> 01:23:33,399
In those days,

911
01:23:33,704 --> 01:23:35,831
All I could think about,

912
01:23:36,433 --> 01:23:39,144
was getting justice for them.

913
01:23:40,134 --> 01:23:42,678
I tried many times to hurt them.

914
01:23:42,703 --> 01:23:44,503
But I could never do it.

915
01:23:45,048 --> 01:23:48,715
Even in the height of my hatred,
I just couldn't do it.

916
01:23:48,925 --> 01:23:50,427
It felt wrong.

917
01:23:50,554 --> 01:23:52,596
I gradually lost hope.

918
01:23:52,793 --> 01:23:55,205
I wanted to end it all.

919
01:23:55,230 --> 01:23:56,852
But they stopped me.

920
01:23:56,852 --> 01:23:59,331
I told them why I tried to do it.

921
01:23:59,356 --> 01:24:01,317
But I was wrong from the start.

922
01:24:01,732 --> 01:24:03,856
They didn't even know my father.

923
01:24:04,254 --> 01:24:05,586
They told me,

924
01:24:05,611 --> 01:24:07,901
That it was probably
a false flag operation.

925
01:24:08,071 --> 01:24:11,113
A twisted play by those
who sought our land.

926
01:24:11,591 --> 01:24:13,593
The rebels were just boogeymen,

927
01:24:13,618 --> 01:24:15,576
Used as cover for their heinous crimes.

928
01:24:16,330 --> 01:24:18,662
We were equally victims after all.

929
01:24:18,931 --> 01:24:23,520
No one else could have done it.

930
01:24:23,545 --> 01:24:24,792
Except Don Fidel.

931
01:24:24,817 --> 01:24:27,666
The only one who could
have gained something.

932
01:24:28,833 --> 01:24:32,628
The army eventually found us.

933
01:24:33,010 --> 01:24:34,678
To be honest,

934
01:24:35,599 --> 01:24:39,363
I don't know how
many of us are alive.

935
01:24:40,771 --> 01:24:41,995
And who died.

936
01:24:43,398 --> 01:24:45,689
I walked the jungle for days,

937
01:24:45,859 --> 01:24:48,859
I had time to think, to plan.

938
01:24:49,988 --> 01:24:54,323
Until I found you, I got the chance...

939
01:24:54,873 --> 01:24:57,167
To watch you, to study you.

940
01:25:00,952 --> 01:25:03,497
The day came when,

941
01:25:03,669 --> 01:25:09,424
I got the chance to begin my plan.

942
01:25:09,449 --> 01:25:12,688
I knew you wouldn't let me die.

943
01:25:15,649 --> 01:25:19,415
Sonya, Ester, Lea...

944
01:25:19,609 --> 01:25:21,774
I was behind everything.

945
01:25:22,145 --> 01:25:24,454
The chickens...

946
01:25:25,816 --> 01:25:28,068
The money...

947
01:25:29,319 --> 01:25:31,571
The allergies...

948
01:25:32,881 --> 01:25:34,716
But as the days went by...

949
01:25:34,741 --> 01:25:37,786
I found my resolve shaken.

950
01:25:37,811 --> 01:25:40,564
Because of the kindness you showed me.

951
01:25:41,243 --> 01:25:44,498
This is where I felt
like I had a family again.

952
01:25:52,843 --> 01:25:53,978
I knew...

953
01:25:55,019 --> 01:25:57,981
I knew you were a rebel,
the first time I saw you.

954
01:25:59,057 --> 01:26:00,767
I'm not dumb.

955
01:26:02,310 --> 01:26:03,310
But...

956
01:26:05,730 --> 01:26:08,400
Lea was so happy
when you were there...

957
01:26:10,193 --> 01:26:12,776
And I felt like you
weren't a bad person...

958
01:26:13,029 --> 01:26:14,614
I let it slide.

959
01:26:17,242 --> 01:26:19,327
But you tried to harm us.

960
01:26:20,871 --> 01:26:23,248
I don't think I can
forgive you for that.

961
01:26:25,333 --> 01:26:27,416
I just wanted you to understand.

962
01:26:29,337 --> 01:26:31,673
I did those things for my family.

963
01:26:33,633 --> 01:26:35,469
And I deeply regret them.

964
01:26:36,928 --> 01:26:38,763
I'm in love with Lea.

965
01:26:41,808 --> 01:26:43,974
I'll do anything...

966
01:26:44,269 --> 01:26:45,642
To earn your forgiveness.

967
01:26:48,190 --> 01:26:49,479
What are you thinking?

968
01:26:49,691 --> 01:26:52,065
You're letting yourself be
swayed by his words again?

969
01:26:52,546 --> 01:26:53,422
Ester...

970
01:26:53,476 --> 01:26:55,255
Lea is in love with him.

971
01:26:55,280 --> 01:26:57,073
Would you take that away from her?

972
01:26:57,098 --> 01:26:58,099
In love?

973
01:27:00,160 --> 01:27:01,995
Thanks for yesterday, by the way,

974
01:27:02,020 --> 01:27:03,313
I enjoyed what we did together.

975
01:27:09,002 --> 01:27:11,752
What do you mean?

976
01:27:20,514 --> 01:27:21,264
Lea...

977
01:27:21,515 --> 01:27:22,390
Lea...

978
01:27:22,390 --> 01:27:24,184
Lea, let me explain.

979
01:27:24,184 --> 01:27:25,184
Lea...

980
01:27:25,685 --> 01:27:26,685
Lea...

981
01:27:32,817 --> 01:27:33,817
Thank you...

982
01:27:36,613 --> 01:27:37,613
Just through here...

983
01:27:45,455 --> 01:27:47,249
You can stay here
for the time being.

984
01:27:53,911 --> 01:27:55,993
I'm doing this for Lea.

985
01:27:57,175 --> 01:27:59,469
You need to let the tension die down.

986
01:28:00,345 --> 01:28:01,638
Stay here for now.

987
01:28:03,848 --> 01:28:06,390
Thanks for understanding, Sonya.

988
01:28:08,979 --> 01:28:10,313
Don't worry.

989
01:28:11,481 --> 01:28:14,067
I'll fix things with Ester...

990
01:28:15,026 --> 01:28:16,319
And Lea.

991
01:28:18,530 --> 01:28:21,074
I'll never break your
trust again. I promise.

992
01:28:30,492 --> 01:28:33,118
Oh, what brings you here?

993
01:28:33,878 --> 01:28:36,212
I have information
on the guy you want.

994
01:28:40,054 --> 01:28:42,348
Is this really true?

995
01:28:42,373 --> 01:28:46,711
Why haven't I heard
from Sonya about this?

996
01:28:46,803 --> 01:28:48,540
You and Sonya are still in touch?

997
01:28:49,894 --> 01:28:51,354
Always on a high horse playing the saint.

998
01:28:51,379 --> 01:28:52,879
What a fake...

999
01:28:54,178 --> 01:28:56,180
So she fooled you.

1000
01:28:58,153 --> 01:29:00,864
I know she's clever but...

1001
01:29:01,197 --> 01:29:02,407
I have no idea why...

1002
01:29:03,158 --> 01:29:04,492
She'd settle for you.

1003
01:29:04,868 --> 01:29:06,508
There're a lot of
other options out there.

1004
01:29:07,621 --> 01:29:09,247
It might be because of this.

1005
01:29:14,914 --> 01:29:16,383
You're fucking married?!

1006
01:29:16,963 --> 01:29:18,923
Does my sister know?!

1007
01:29:19,470 --> 01:29:20,634
Get off my case.

1008
01:29:20,659 --> 01:29:22,160
I'm not in the mood.

1009
01:29:22,677 --> 01:29:23,928
Sonya knows everything.

1010
01:29:24,469 --> 01:29:26,245
She agreed to all of this.

1011
01:29:30,594 --> 01:29:32,012
Speechless?

1012
01:29:32,771 --> 01:29:34,131
You should shut
up once in a while.

1013
01:29:34,524 --> 01:29:36,891
Don't feel sorry for your sister.

1014
01:29:37,359 --> 01:29:39,694
We both know what we want.

1015
01:29:40,153 --> 01:29:42,757
If she really loved me
and wanted a family,

1016
01:29:43,406 --> 01:29:45,905
Then she wouldn't
have gotten an abortion.

1017
01:29:46,242 --> 01:29:48,327
I don't believe she wanted this.

1018
01:29:49,579 --> 01:29:50,757
Then ask her.

1019
01:29:51,247 --> 01:29:53,249
You came at the right time too.

1020
01:29:54,042 --> 01:29:55,718
I've been waiting for this.

1021
01:29:56,878 --> 01:29:59,297
When I catch that fucking rebel,

1022
01:30:00,006 --> 01:30:01,679
I'll be gone from here.

1023
01:30:04,850 --> 01:30:06,389
I've changed my mind.

1024
01:30:06,805 --> 01:30:08,366
What the fuck?!

1025
01:30:09,224 --> 01:30:11,046
Are you fucking kidding me?!

1026
01:30:11,637 --> 01:30:13,337
Don't you want to see Manila?

1027
01:30:14,229 --> 01:30:17,524
The bounty on that
rebel is pretty big.

1028
01:30:19,192 --> 01:30:20,568
I can share some with you.

1029
01:30:21,653 --> 01:30:24,322
Fuck! Ester!
Come back here!

1030
01:30:39,170 --> 01:30:40,797
What do you think you're doing?

1031
01:30:42,132 --> 01:30:43,132
Hey...

1032
01:30:44,592 --> 01:30:45,969
We can help each other.

1033
01:30:47,178 --> 01:30:49,597
This helps your sisters too.

1034
01:30:51,433 --> 01:30:52,892
I love Sonya.

1035
01:30:54,412 --> 01:30:56,154
I've been thinking too,

1036
01:30:56,521 --> 01:30:58,982
I might take her with me.

1037
01:31:01,276 --> 01:31:03,027
I can break off my marriage.

1038
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:06,514
And we'll start over.

1039
01:31:08,366 --> 01:31:10,493
See? I need your help here.

1040
01:31:24,674 --> 01:31:26,509
I've been thinking too.

1041
01:31:26,509 --> 01:31:28,636
Why do we even need to
involve my sisters,

1042
01:31:28,661 --> 01:31:30,622
When we can leave on our own?

1043
01:32:33,284 --> 01:32:34,994
Ester!

1044
01:32:34,994 --> 01:32:39,666
- Ma'am, please don't!
- Ester!

1045
01:32:39,666 --> 01:32:42,168
Don't touch her.

1046
01:33:21,852 --> 01:33:23,854
I still can't believe it.

1047
01:33:25,920 --> 01:33:27,046
What if...

1048
01:33:27,881 --> 01:33:30,008
What they say is true?

1049
01:33:30,008 --> 01:33:32,093
That rebels were behind this.

1050
01:33:32,677 --> 01:33:34,012
Lea,

1051
01:33:34,012 --> 01:33:35,346
My comrades aren't murderers.

1052
01:33:37,181 --> 01:33:38,641
Yes it's true that...

1053
01:33:39,100 --> 01:33:42,600
We use force in our struggle,

1054
01:33:42,812 --> 01:33:43,605
But...

1055
01:33:43,605 --> 01:33:45,648
They'd never involve
anyone who's innocent.

1056
01:33:45,648 --> 01:33:47,108
I'm sure of that.

1057
01:34:11,213 --> 01:34:15,551
I thought that,
you'd never let me in.

1058
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:18,718
Why were you calling
the other night?

1059
01:34:19,641 --> 01:34:20,641
Huh?

1060
01:34:21,517 --> 01:34:23,561
You left a lot of missed calls.

1061
01:34:23,586 --> 01:34:25,186
I wasn't able to answer.

1062
01:34:25,605 --> 01:34:26,605
Why?

1063
01:34:27,774 --> 01:34:29,061
I don't remember.

1064
01:34:30,234 --> 01:34:31,461
I was probably drunk.

1065
01:34:31,486 --> 01:34:32,486
Or...

1066
01:34:32,612 --> 01:34:33,738
I probably missed you.

1067
01:34:39,869 --> 01:34:41,972
Even when you're drunk,

1068
01:34:42,664 --> 01:34:44,916
You'd never call like that.

1069
01:34:46,167 --> 01:34:48,504
We agreed that you'd text first.

1070
01:34:49,295 --> 01:34:53,091
And you were on duty that night.

1071
01:34:55,843 --> 01:34:57,470
Well, yeah.

1072
01:34:58,513 --> 01:35:02,441
Can't I miss you while I'm on duty?

1073
01:35:03,351 --> 01:35:05,090
Can't I...

1074
01:35:05,353 --> 01:35:07,855
Break the rules sometimes?

1075
01:35:11,359 --> 01:35:13,894
You think I'm too dumb to see,

1076
01:35:13,919 --> 01:35:16,785
That you've been watching us
since Ester died?

1077
01:35:17,323 --> 01:35:19,033
Be honest...

1078
01:35:19,033 --> 01:35:20,243
Tell me, Mako.

1079
01:35:22,265 --> 01:35:23,475
What the fuck?

1080
01:35:24,565 --> 01:35:27,360
You talk more than the
machine guns at the base.

1081
01:35:27,959 --> 01:35:28,959
You know...

1082
01:35:29,252 --> 01:35:30,962
If you don't stop with this,

1083
01:35:31,096 --> 01:35:32,889
You're gonna get it!

1084
01:35:44,603 --> 01:35:46,635
I know you're still grieving.

1085
01:35:49,399 --> 01:35:52,152
But for Ester to find peace,

1086
01:35:53,651 --> 01:35:55,903
We should just pray for her.

1087
01:36:06,914 --> 01:36:09,208
While I'm here...

1088
01:36:10,296 --> 01:36:11,922
I'll always protect you.

1089
01:36:15,048 --> 01:36:16,799
I promise you.

1090
01:36:22,972 --> 01:36:25,099
I love you so much Lea.

1091
01:36:26,142 --> 01:36:27,697
I love you too...

1092
01:36:28,269 --> 01:36:29,269
Tomas.

1093
01:36:54,462 --> 01:36:55,880
Motherfucker!

1094
01:37:00,218 --> 01:37:02,053
What the fuck Sonya...

1095
01:37:03,471 --> 01:37:05,807
Haven't you been thinking?

1096
01:37:07,266 --> 01:37:10,061
You let a rebel scum
into your home.

1097
01:37:10,895 --> 01:37:12,845
Don't you know
how dangerous that is?

1098
01:37:15,399 --> 01:37:16,609
And you...

1099
01:37:18,027 --> 01:37:20,696
You thought you could
get away with this?

1100
01:37:21,531 --> 01:37:22,990
You piece of shit!

1101
01:37:22,990 --> 01:37:24,492
It's your last day alive!

1102
01:37:27,078 --> 01:37:29,122
Tell me where your friends are.

1103
01:37:32,208 --> 01:37:33,751
Answer me!

1104
01:37:43,344 --> 01:37:45,202
You'll get nothing from me.

1105
01:37:45,847 --> 01:37:48,015
You fucking monster.

1106
01:37:50,124 --> 01:37:54,147
Stop, enough of this!

1107
01:37:54,147 --> 01:37:55,690
Calm down.

1108
01:37:55,690 --> 01:37:56,690
Please...

1109
01:37:56,899 --> 01:37:57,942
Calm down.

1110
01:37:57,942 --> 01:38:00,194
Tomorrow we can turn him over.

1111
01:38:01,112 --> 01:38:01,904
You motherfucker.

1112
01:38:01,904 --> 01:38:04,240
Enough of this for now.

1113
01:38:04,240 --> 01:38:05,950
I don't want you to kill.

1114
01:39:34,136 --> 01:39:36,932
Shit!

1115
01:39:43,130 --> 01:39:44,548
Motherfucker.

1116
01:39:56,269 --> 01:39:57,687
Motherfucker.

1117
01:40:00,022 --> 01:40:01,399
Sonya...

1118
01:40:02,900 --> 01:40:04,110
Drop the gun.

1119
01:40:04,110 --> 01:40:05,110
Shut up.

1120
01:40:05,778 --> 01:40:07,862
Or I'll blow off your balls.

1121
01:40:07,947 --> 01:40:08,947
Well,

1122
01:40:10,449 --> 01:40:13,042
Why would I be afraid,

1123
01:40:13,421 --> 01:40:15,244
Of you shooting me?

1124
01:40:15,955 --> 01:40:18,128
You don't even know
how to use that.

1125
01:40:18,916 --> 01:40:20,526
And Sonya,

1126
01:40:21,335 --> 01:40:23,612
I know you'd never do that to me.

1127
01:40:23,637 --> 01:40:25,839
You seem to be forgetting,

1128
01:40:27,466 --> 01:40:30,303
How you taught me one time.

1129
01:40:30,303 --> 01:40:31,846
You arrogant prick.

1130
01:40:33,389 --> 01:40:37,143
You said that one day,
I would need to use it.

1131
01:40:37,143 --> 01:40:39,145
Well, I'm using it on you.

1132
01:40:39,145 --> 01:40:40,432
So thank you.

1133
01:40:40,457 --> 01:40:42,083
Alright then...

1134
01:40:43,699 --> 01:40:45,925
The rebel goes free.

1135
01:40:46,237 --> 01:40:47,737
I'm not turning him in.

1136
01:40:48,946 --> 01:40:50,964
I'll keep your sister out of this.

1137
01:40:51,407 --> 01:40:53,117
Don't do something

1138
01:40:53,791 --> 01:40:56,111
That soon you'll regret.

1139
01:40:57,076 --> 01:40:59,339
Weren't you going to be a doctor?

1140
01:40:59,957 --> 01:41:00,957
Or...

1141
01:41:01,500 --> 01:41:03,002
Do you want to go to prison?

1142
01:41:04,045 --> 01:41:06,505
We can still start over.

1143
01:41:06,505 --> 01:41:07,757
You talk too much.

1144
01:41:09,140 --> 01:41:10,603
Tell me...

1145
01:41:11,260 --> 01:41:12,470
Did you have anything to do...

1146
01:41:12,495 --> 01:41:13,979
With Ester's death?

1147
01:41:16,015 --> 01:41:17,224
What the fuck?

1148
01:41:17,975 --> 01:41:19,769
Why would you
bring me into that?

1149
01:41:20,686 --> 01:41:23,230
Wasn't your sister tired of living?

1150
01:41:26,823 --> 01:41:28,971
Tell the truth.

1151
01:41:29,111 --> 01:41:30,237
Did you have anything to do...

1152
01:41:30,262 --> 01:41:31,697
With Ester's death?

1153
01:41:31,791 --> 01:41:33,418
You're accusing me?!

1154
01:41:34,367 --> 01:41:35,826
You have no proof!

1155
01:41:42,291 --> 01:41:45,259
The night that you were calling...

1156
01:41:45,284 --> 01:41:47,546
was the same night that Esther left.

1157
01:41:47,571 --> 01:41:49,990
She went to you to turn in Felipe.

1158
01:41:52,143 --> 01:41:54,553
You're too smart for your own good.

1159
01:41:55,395 --> 01:41:57,440
Why can't you both
just let things be?

1160
01:41:57,598 --> 01:41:59,323
It only gets you in trouble.

1161
01:41:59,471 --> 01:42:01,560
Do you want to die next?

1162
01:42:02,478 --> 01:42:03,854
Fuck you!

1163
01:42:21,664 --> 01:42:22,498
Motherfucker!

1164
01:42:22,498 --> 01:42:24,375
I'm the only one
who'll fuck you!

1165
01:42:25,251 --> 01:42:27,086
You think someone else will?

1166
01:42:27,795 --> 01:42:30,003
Me and my child don't
need you anymore!

1167
01:42:30,589 --> 01:42:31,715
What the fuck?!

1168
01:42:32,258 --> 01:42:33,987
You didn't get the abortion?!

1169
01:42:35,886 --> 01:42:38,050
And here I thought
you were smart.

1170
01:42:38,764 --> 01:42:40,182
You're as dumb as they are!

1171
01:42:41,308 --> 01:42:43,766
You're going to raise that kid,

1172
01:42:44,145 --> 01:42:45,604
Without a father?!

1173
01:42:46,063 --> 01:42:47,189
Makes sense though,

1174
01:42:47,815 --> 01:42:48,983
If you were smart,

1175
01:42:49,345 --> 01:42:52,479
You wouldn't have had
an affair with a married man.

1176
01:42:53,276 --> 01:42:55,195
You're so fucking desperate!

1177
01:43:27,152 --> 01:43:28,432
Sis...

1178
01:43:29,300 --> 01:43:31,878
I'm not a murderer.

1179
01:43:34,144 --> 01:43:35,144
Lea...

1180
01:43:41,535 --> 01:43:43,417
Leave now!

1181
01:43:45,393 --> 01:43:47,175
I'll handle this.

1182
01:43:47,200 --> 01:43:49,643
Just go.

1183
01:43:49,668 --> 01:43:50,919
Please just go.

1184
01:43:53,612 --> 01:43:56,675
Leave now!

1185
01:43:57,902 --> 01:44:01,721
Go ahead.
