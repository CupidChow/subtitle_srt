1
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:18,369
Jung Hyeon-su.

2
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:45,730
Darn it.

3
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:10,088
Hey, Prosecutor Cha.
Jung Hyeon-su just escaped.

4
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,132
Yes, Investigator.

5
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,718
What? What happened to Prosecutor Cha?

6
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:21,391
Damn it.

7
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:31,234
Hey, Ji-uk.

8
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:37,198
What did you just say?

9
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:39,659
Yu-jeong had what?

10
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:44,873
Okay.

11
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,293
What happened?

12
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:50,003
Did something happen to Prosecutor Cha?

13
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:02,432
Hey, Prosecutor Lee.

14
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:06,352
Give me a call as soon as you find out
Jung Hyeon-su's whereabouts.

15
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:09,188
Thank you. Bye.

16
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,697
Hey, what happened?

17
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:21,200
Yu-jeong. Cha Yu-jeong!

18
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:23,202
Is Prosecutor Cha all right?

19
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:27,040
Hey, what's wrong with Yu-jeong?

20
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:28,791
Why is she unconscious?

21
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,502
Well, she had a mild concussion.

22
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:32,587
A concussion?

23
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:35,006
Hey, the damage of concussions
can be serious.

24
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:37,300
She has to be examined then.
Why is she just lying here?

25
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:39,219
The doctor wanted to take a CT scan--

26
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:41,054
Is there a specialist
instead of an intern?

27
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:43,389
Shouldn't we move her
to a specialized hospital?

28
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:46,434
Hey, Ji-uk. Do you know any doctors?
Please help her.

29
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:48,228
Please help her.

30
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:52,607
Hey, Yu-jeong. Yu-jeong.

31
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:54,108
Please wake up.

32
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:57,362
Hey, why is she unconscious?

33
00:03:57,445 --> 00:03:59,864
Be quiet. You're embarrassing me.

34
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:01,074
Yu-jeong.

35
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:02,659
Keep quiet.

36
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:07,622
I fell asleep.

37
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:10,750
I'm so relieved.

38
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:12,877
I'm relieved.

39
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:14,921
I really am.

40
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:18,424
You idiot.

41
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,763
I was just acting.

42
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:35,149
They haven't caught Jung Hyeon-su yet?

43
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:36,401
No.

44
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:40,989
I should have seen it coming
that he was going to run.

45
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:43,283
There's no way
you could've predicted that.

46
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:48,454
Do you think he regained his memory?

47
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:50,748
I think so.

48
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:53,042
I had no way of knowing
how much of his memory

49
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:54,836
was regained.

50
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:56,462
I see.

51
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:00,300
Speaking of...

52
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:04,846
I want you to stay at my house
for the time being.

53
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:11,060
No one knows what he's going to do.

54
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:13,521
No.

55
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:16,399
Bong-hui,
you should listen to me this time.

56
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:19,193
Don't worry. I'll be careful.

57
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:32,290
Are you really okay?

58
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:33,791
Aren't you feeling dizzy at all?

59
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,418
I'm fine.

60
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:38,963
Shall I get you anything?
Is there anything you need?

61
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,091
Climb on my back.

62
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:43,426
I'm fine.

63
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,108
-We are here.
-Yes.

64
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:00,818
-Be careful.
-Okay.

65
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,156
Hey, Yu-jeong. Take your bag.

66
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:08,868
Goodness.

67
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:10,745
Yu-jeong, here is your bag.

68
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:24,383
I'm exhausted.

69
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:29,972
Hey, get some rest now.

70
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,933
Call me if there's anything.

71
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:34,602
I hope I never wake up from sleep.

72
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:36,729
What do you mean?

73
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:38,940
I'm a prosecutor who lost a suspect.

74
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:43,194
How am I supposed to face
the consequences?

75
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,462
How much...

76
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:47,133
does Jung Hyeon-su know?

77
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:50,845
People he met after he woke up are...

78
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:53,473
me...

79
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:59,145
Prosecutor Cha...

80
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:03,691
and...

81
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:08,154
Bong-hui.

82
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:13,993
Who is that woman?

83
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,379
How much of his memory...

84
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,759
did Jung Hyeon-su recover?

85
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:49,904
PARK SO-YEONG

86
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:59,664
Why did I murder them?

87
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:02,959
What is it that I couldn't finish?

88
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:06,921
Did he regain his memory...

89
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:10,466
regarding the murders...

90
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:14,345
and his purpose?

91
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:22,687
It has been two days
since the suspect, Mr. Jung,

92
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:26,023
escaped from the hospital
where he was being investigated.

93
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:28,734
His whereabouts are still unknown.

94
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:31,112
The prosecution issued
a nationwide man hunt

95
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:35,241
and announced they put in
large number of manpower for the arrest.

96
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:38,828
They are being criticized
for wasting manpower...

97
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:43,082
I'm sorry, sir.

98
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:45,459
If you are sorry,

99
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:47,670
stay out of my sight.

100
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:49,422
There are many ways.

101
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:52,008
You can take a leave of absence
or something.

102
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:55,678
Hey, I'm about to get transferred
to one of the rural areas.

103
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:58,347
I'm a city type of guy, you know?

104
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:01,309
Hey, this is ridiculous.

105
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:04,437
Should I resign or transfer? Should I?

106
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:06,606
You should go now.

107
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,733
Go take your leave of absence.

108
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:09,859
Go right now!

109
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:11,819
Hey, you should go with her.

110
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:14,447
You can follow her right away.

111
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,824
Good grief. You know what? I'll go.

112
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:18,451
Unbelievable.

113
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,411
This is ridiculous!

114
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:23,664
Come on.

115
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:26,792
Why are you all serious?

116
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:29,462
Are you that afraid of that suspect
with the memory loss?

117
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:32,048
He's right. I bet he can't even go far.

118
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:33,257
They will catch him soon.

119
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:36,093
By any slim chance,
if he shows up in front of me,

120
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:37,803
I'll catch him.

121
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:40,681
I can go at him one more time.

122
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:43,309
I agree. We must catch him.

123
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,853
Our current situation

124
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:47,438
is nothing to joke about.

125
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,942
I still don't think
you understand my feelings.

126
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:55,196
I really want you to feel what I feel.

127
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:57,490
What should I do?

128
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:01,285
I have no other choice.
I shall kill them all.

129
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:08,209
Everyone, stop goofing around.
It's not funny.

130
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:11,087
Let me tell you again.
You have to keep yourselves safe.

131
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:12,380
Got it?

132
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:37,905
PARK SO-YEONG

133
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:26,162
Do you think Jung Hyeon-su
will really come here?

134
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:28,372
It's very much likely.

135
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:31,876
If he hasn't fully regained
his memory yet,

136
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:35,671
he'll wander around
to get his memory back,

137
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:39,383
and this is the one place
that he remembers for certain.

138
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:41,719
The school in the yearbook, right?

139
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:44,054
That's right. After that,

140
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:48,017
he'll go to the places
where he killed his victims.

141
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,978
I've already called the company
that's rebuilding the apartment.

142
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:53,230
I've also sent them
the wanted flyer for Jung Hyeon-su.

143
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:54,857
Great. Good work.

144
00:12:57,359 --> 00:13:00,613
Gosh. I would've sent a unit here
for stakeout if I called the shots.

145
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:04,408
Shall we go?

146
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:07,119
All right.

147
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:55,084
Who are you?

148
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:17,314
Aren't you leaving for the day?

149
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,192
I just want to finish this up.

150
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:23,195
Oh, I see. See you tomorrow.

151
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,573
-Get home safely.
-Okay.

152
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:32,056
Who are you?

153
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:37,937
Are you asking me right now?

154
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:39,980
Who the hell are you?

155
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:46,862
I should be asking you...

156
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:49,740
why you are here right now.

157
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,785
Gosh. Well...

158
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:55,496
My head is hurting so badly.

159
00:15:57,998 --> 00:15:59,124
I beg your pardon?

160
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:00,209
You're...

161
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:05,297
the very first person I saw
as soon as I woke up.

162
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:09,510
But my head keeps telling me
that I have to get rid of you.

163
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:11,303
Do you happen to know the reason?

164
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:13,639
Do you?

165
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:43,752
I must make sure she can't talk.

166
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:55,764
I asked you a question,
so you should answer me.

167
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:00,728
Why are you doing this to me?

168
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:05,858
Tell me. Who are you? What are you?

169
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,736
Gosh, what am I?

170
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:11,155
Who am I? Tell me.

171
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:12,698
Why...

172
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:16,535
Why on earth am I being like this?

173
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:23,584
Do you want to know the reason?

174
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:27,838
It's because you murdered someone...

175
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,216
and I witnessed it.

176
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,245
Bong-hui, are you all right?

177
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,538
Mr. Noh.

178
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:43,831
Mr. Noh.

179
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,418
Mr. Noh, you're bleeding. The blood...

180
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:08,605
Mr. Noh.

181
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:12,651
Mr. Noh.

182
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:26,498
Gosh, please...

183
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,292
Please...

184
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:36,341
What?

185
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:38,177
-You want to become like Dad?
-Yes.

186
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,053
Yes, I want to be like you when I grow up.

187
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:43,891
My gosh, I'm so honored.
Come here, my boy.

188
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:47,811
Who told you that you can wear
my judicial robe?

189
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:49,104
Raise your arms.

190
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,523
-Dad.
-Yes.

191
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:15,756
Prosecutor Noh.

192
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,008
Prosecutor Noh.

193
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,135
-Prosecutor Noh.
-Ji-uk.

194
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,137
Ji-uk...

195
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:26,558
Come here. Let's go.
I'll get you out of here.

196
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:28,602
It's okay. Let's go.

197
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:30,729
Dad...

198
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,941
Dad, no...

199
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:39,529
Dad...

200
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:42,282
Dad...

201
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:56,505
Are you okay?

202
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,093
I'll go in and get your mom and dad too.

203
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,621
No...

204
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:36,586
GUKIL MEDICAL CENTER

205
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:54,313
Hey, Ji-uk. Are you all right?

206
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:56,648
I'm Eun-hyeok.
Can you recognize me, Ji-uk?

207
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:59,484
Hey. It's me, your dad.

208
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:00,777
Thank you, Ji-uk.

209
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:03,655
Hey, why aren't you saying anything?

210
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:05,365
Can't you recognize me?

211
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:07,993
It's me. Say something. Can't you talk?

212
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:10,370
Why are you two stopping me?

213
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:15,834
-Who are you?
-What?

214
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:20,088
Hey, Ji-uk. It's me.

215
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:27,596
You little... Gosh, he totally scared me.

216
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:31,183
You've obviously
regained your consciousness.

217
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:32,684
You brat.

218
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:35,145
He's such a prankster.

219
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:37,105
You little...

220
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:39,441
-Gosh, you totally got me.
-Mr. Byeon.

221
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:41,401
-Mr. Byeon.
-Let's get something to drink.

222
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:42,694
-What?
-Let's step out.

223
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:44,279
-Just a few minutes.
-Why?

224
00:22:44,362 --> 00:22:45,697
-Let's get some fresh air.
-All right.

225
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:47,616
-I just wanted to see him.
-You saw him.

226
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:49,618
Why are you guys being like this? Hey.

227
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:51,995
Hang on a second.
Why on earth are you two being like this?

228
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,413
You guys are so weird.

229
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:55,791
We should let them have
some alone time together.

230
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:57,459
Why don't you get it?

231
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:01,797
Oh, are they...

232
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:04,633
You guys should have just told me.

233
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:06,968
-Most people just know--
-All right, I heard you.

234
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:08,595
I should go to the restroom.

235
00:23:08,678 --> 00:23:10,430
He just can't take a hint.

236
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,272
Bong-hui.

237
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:24,444
I'm sorry.

238
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:31,701
Why did you have to get yourself
involved and get hurt like this?

239
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:35,330
If you do that again,

240
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:37,499
I'll actually get mad at you.

241
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:40,127
You should apologize to me.

242
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:45,340
You quit your job because of me,

243
00:23:45,465 --> 00:23:46,967
and you get hurt because of me.

244
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:49,136
What is this mess?

245
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:23,003
So?

246
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:25,630
Have you regained your memory?

247
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:35,682
Let's start over.

248
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:37,976
You're Jung Hyeon-su, right?

249
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:45,609
Do you know why you're here now?

250
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:57,954
Do you really not remember anything?

251
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:09,299
LEE JAE-HO MURDER WEAPON

252
00:25:09,382 --> 00:25:11,885
The knife had Lee Jae-ho
and Bang Eun-ho's blood on it.

253
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:15,305
It was found at your place,
with your fingerprints all over it.

254
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:17,182
You don't remember it?

255
00:25:28,735 --> 00:25:29,736
Mr. Jung.

256
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:33,198
Let's see how long you can exercise

257
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,450
your right to remain silent.

258
00:26:58,283 --> 00:26:59,367
Well...

259
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:02,245
Did you sleep well?

260
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:06,708
Yes, I did. Thanks to you.

261
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:08,293
How are you feeling?

262
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:09,836
How are the stitches on the stab wound?

263
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,296
-Can I see?
-No.

264
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,090
You can't. It looks so ugly right now.

265
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:15,425
I absolutely can't let you see it.

266
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:17,385
Don't say that.

267
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:19,471
I'm sure it looks cute and sexy.

268
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:28,021
I'm sorry.

269
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:29,898
I can't really keep my feelings
out of this.

270
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:32,150
It's okay. Don't worry about it.

271
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:33,401
I like it.

272
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:39,407
I'll go wash my face quickly.

273
00:27:40,116 --> 00:27:41,034
Bong-hui.

274
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:53,421
I need to tell you something.

275
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,301
It's about something very important.

276
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:01,763
What is it?

277
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:04,849
Mr. Noh!

278
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:06,893
Did you sleep well?

279
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:10,105
What are you doing here?
Did you skip school or what?

280
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:11,398
Why are you here now?

281
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:14,025
Today is Saturday.

282
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:16,194
Kids don't have school on Saturdays
these days?

283
00:28:16,277 --> 00:28:19,531
-No, they don't.
-What a great world they live in.

284
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:22,409
How did you get yourself injured?

285
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:24,244
May I see the wound?

286
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:25,745
No, you may not.

287
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:28,498
Just show us.
It's not like it'll get any worse.

288
00:28:28,581 --> 00:28:31,042
-Let us see it.
-It's not even healed yet--

289
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:33,795
You guys shouldn't be doing this to him.

290
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:34,796
Bong-hui.

291
00:28:35,338 --> 00:28:36,714
You've been the worst.

292
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:38,925
-Have I?
-Yes.

293
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:43,805
Jae-hong.

294
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:46,599
You see that man there, right?
Ask him to show you his scar.

295
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:49,102
His scar is a lot bigger than mine.

296
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,816
I have no interest in him.

297
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,277
I have no interest in you either.

298
00:29:00,029 --> 00:29:02,449
By the way, are you ill too?

299
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:04,993
Me? I'm totally fine.

300
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:07,662
Your face and hair look weird.

301
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:13,334
Hey, you should go home.

302
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:15,336
That little boy

303
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:17,464
has a very good eye.

304
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:20,800
What?

305
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:26,639
By the way, I really can't wait
to leave the hospital.

306
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,809
Being hospitalized
is even more exhausting.

307
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:31,352
Right? I know.

308
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:40,278
PROSECUTOR CHA YU-JEONG

309
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:52,123
Gosh, you startled me.

310
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,668
I didn't expect to see you here.

311
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:58,171
You're standing in front of my office.

312
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:02,133
Right, this is your office.

313
00:30:03,718 --> 00:30:04,844
How's your head?

314
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:06,596
Are there any delayed symptoms?

315
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:08,765
Symptoms like headaches,
dizziness or memory loss,

316
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:10,266
or anything like that?

317
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,101
-There is.
-Seriously?

318
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:13,186
I'm depressed.

319
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:15,772
Not because of the concussion.

320
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:17,565
My life is depressing.

321
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,026
Things will get better soon.

322
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,654
Jung Hyeon-su hurt you,
Ji-uk, and Mr. Bang like that,

323
00:30:22,737 --> 00:30:24,072
and he's been caught, you know.

324
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:27,700
You're right.
He won't be able to escape again.

325
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:29,077
Of course not.

326
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:31,746
Oh, right. Take this.

327
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:35,834
You've been skipping meals all the time.

328
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:37,085
You should eat well

329
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:38,920
to pull all of those all-nighters.

330
00:30:40,296 --> 00:30:42,507
Okay. Thanks.

331
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:45,218
I'm off.

332
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:59,065
Gosh, it hurts.

333
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:18,543
Hey, what are you doing?

334
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:23,715
You absolutely have to stay away
from work until you fully recover.

335
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:26,342
I'm really okay.
We should have a meeting now.

336
00:31:26,634 --> 00:31:28,511
The doctor said
that you shouldn't be working now.

337
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:29,929
You got discharged on that condition.

338
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:32,473
I'm really fine.
I can take care of myself--

339
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:35,018
I will look after you.
As your coworker, that is.

340
00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:39,188
-No, Bong-hui.
-No, Mr. Noh.

341
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:43,568
I'll feel guilty if you don't let me.

342
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:47,655
I'll beat myself up,
thinking you got stabbed instead of me.

343
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:48,740
Shall I do that?

344
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:03,254
Eat the porridge first,
then take your medication with water.

345
00:32:06,382 --> 00:32:07,300
Hey, I...

346
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:09,302
I don't like porridge.

347
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:46,255
I'll help you.

348
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:47,674
No, it's okay.

349
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:48,841
No, it must be hard for you.

350
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:50,677
No, it's okay. I can do it myself.

351
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:11,280
You're tickling me.

352
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:13,533
Am I?

353
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:23,376
I'm really struggling to hold myself back.

354
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:31,259
Hey.

355
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:33,720
I'll do it.

356
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:37,223
Okay.

357
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:56,909
Nothing is for certain
because it happened too long ago.

358
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:57,994
However,

359
00:33:58,161 --> 00:34:00,580
there's a possibility that it was
an accidental fire, not arson.

360
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:02,957
That's the best conclusion
we can arrive at now.

361
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:09,839
How am I...

362
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:13,968
supposed to bring all this up to Bong-hui?

363
00:34:33,529 --> 00:34:35,364
There's something I have to tell you.

364
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:40,203
Can you make some time for me
after work today?

365
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:44,582
Sure, I will.

366
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:18,866
The reason of the fire
still remains to be unknown.

367
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:22,078
But one thing I'm certain of...

368
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:26,499
is that your father...

369
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:30,002
was not an arsonist...

370
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:34,465
that killed...

371
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:38,469
my parents.

372
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:43,015
Actually, it was the opposite.

373
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:47,228
He saved my life...

374
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:49,772
and passed away...

375
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:54,026
while trying to rescue my parents.

376
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:11,919
Then...

377
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:13,629
why...

378
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:18,426
was my dad accused of killing them?

379
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:21,762
Why on earth did that happen?

380
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:35,902
It was because of me.

381
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:37,778
Sorry?

382
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:43,993
-I beg your pardon?
-I...

383
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:52,793
gave the wrong statement.

384
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:57,798
I said that your dad is the culprit.

385
00:36:58,841 --> 00:37:01,302
I gave the wrong statement back then.

386
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:05,223
Why?

387
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:07,058
Why would you do that?

388
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:10,186
Answer me.

389
00:37:10,686 --> 00:37:12,271
Tell me why you did such a thing.

390
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:14,941
Whatever I say will be an excuse.

391
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:16,776
Then at least give me your excuse.

392
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:18,444
Say something, please.

393
00:37:18,861 --> 00:37:21,781
Do whatever you can
to try to make me understand.

394
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:26,744
Can you recognize him?

395
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:32,708
This man is the one

396
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:34,293
who killed your dad

397
00:37:34,877 --> 00:37:36,712
and mom.

398
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:38,089
Okay?

399
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:41,384
I think...

400
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:44,679
I had lost my memory temporarily

401
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:47,598
due to the shock from the incident...

402
00:37:48,724 --> 00:37:49,767
back then.

403
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:55,898
The Chief Prosecutor, Jang Mu-yeong,
who wrongly charged your dad,

404
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:58,234
had to conceal his mistake.

405
00:37:58,943 --> 00:37:59,944
Hence,

406
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:02,363
he probably blamed him for the fire...

407
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:04,991
because he was found on the scene.

408
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:08,911
The prosecution...
Back then, the prosecution

409
00:38:09,328 --> 00:38:12,790
refused to admit their mistakes,
even more so than they do now.

410
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:17,628
No, but...

411
00:38:20,589 --> 00:38:21,966
It was that man.

412
00:38:22,758 --> 00:38:24,927
He's the culprit.

413
00:38:28,764 --> 00:38:31,726
Whatever excuse I give,
it is ultimately...

414
00:38:36,939 --> 00:38:38,232
all my fault.

415
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:00,106
I must have...

416
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:04,068
gotten way ahead of myself.

417
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:07,947
He's not even calling me.

418
00:40:09,448 --> 00:40:11,242
Ji Eun-hyeok, you jerk.

419
00:40:20,334 --> 00:40:21,710
Hey, you're home.

420
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:32,346
Hey.

421
00:40:33,722 --> 00:40:34,849
Did you cry?

422
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:36,392
Damn it.

423
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:39,395
Pretend you didn't see that.

424
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:45,693
Why the hell are you about to cry too?

425
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:59,540
Hey, I'm okay.

426
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:03,169
You don't have to cry for me.
I'm not that sad.

427
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:09,967
Hey, I'm really fine.

428
00:41:25,232 --> 00:41:27,359
-Hey.
-Hey, don't cry.

429
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:30,529
-Don't cry.
-Don't cry.

430
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:39,121
Eun-hyeok, you've been nice to me lately.

431
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:43,042
It's all because of meeting you
coincidentally.

432
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:46,629
Besides, who knew
I had to carry all these files?

433
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:51,842
By the way, you are going to read
all of them again at home?

434
00:41:52,801 --> 00:41:54,428
Don't you think
you're overworking yourself?

435
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,181
Eun-hyeok.

436
00:41:58,474 --> 00:41:59,350
Yes?

437
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:03,270
Is it really a coincidence?

438
00:42:04,396 --> 00:42:05,314
Sorry?

439
00:42:06,148 --> 00:42:08,734
You always help me
whenever I'm having a tough time.

440
00:42:10,277 --> 00:42:12,571
Is this really a coincidence?

441
00:42:14,823 --> 00:42:16,742
Yes, it is.

442
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:19,954
I see.

443
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:22,456
I got it then.

444
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:26,210
I could have gotten the wrong idea.

445
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:31,632
We are just friends.
We are just good friends,

446
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:33,968
aren't we?

447
00:42:40,474 --> 00:42:41,809
Yes, we are.

448
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:15,467
I did the right thing.

449
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:20,014
Yes, I did.

450
00:43:24,351 --> 00:43:25,311
I did well.

451
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:08,479
SEONHO DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

452
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:10,439
What brings you here?

453
00:44:12,107 --> 00:44:15,152
I know you hate me,
but don't make it too obvious.

454
00:44:15,694 --> 00:44:20,074
I didn't exactly come here
because I like you.

455
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:21,450
Then you should leave.

456
00:44:21,533 --> 00:44:23,619
I can't go without telling you
what I have to say.

457
00:44:24,453 --> 00:44:25,996
I should do that before I go.

458
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,831
Then go on.

459
00:44:28,874 --> 00:44:29,917
I...

460
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:34,630
am going to tell you some things
that you won't like to hear

461
00:44:35,297 --> 00:44:37,257
and that will hurt your feelings.

462
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:39,968
Your son, Hui-jun.

463
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:42,513
Leave if you are going to talk nonsense.

464
00:44:42,596 --> 00:44:44,640
You have it all wrong.

465
00:44:45,724 --> 00:44:48,060
-Bong-hui isn't the culprit.
-Yeong-hui.

466
00:44:48,143 --> 00:44:51,605
You know that guy who lost his memory?

467
00:44:52,147 --> 00:44:55,025
His name is Jung Hyeon-su. He's your guy.

468
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:56,193
What are you saying?

469
00:44:56,318 --> 00:45:00,155
You are ignorant,
think you're always right,

470
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:02,533
and never listen to others.

471
00:45:02,991 --> 00:45:05,077
But you aren't stupid.

472
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:08,330
Think about it.

473
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:11,417
If you look
at all the circumstantial evidence,

474
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:13,794
you will come to realize
Jung Hyeon-su is the culprit.

475
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:17,464
So look over the case carefully

476
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:21,635
and stop harassing Ji-uk...

477
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:24,388
and Bong-hui.

478
00:45:26,098 --> 00:45:28,100
Ji-uk is born to be a prosecutor.

479
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:31,270
Reinstate him.

480
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:56,336
JANG HUI-JUN MURDER CASE AT SUPA APARTMENT

481
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:59,465
WATER TANK MURDER CASE AT SUPA APARTMENT

482
00:46:19,151 --> 00:46:21,320
I was going to visit you.

483
00:46:22,988 --> 00:46:24,406
Look how I ran into you.

484
00:46:24,656 --> 00:46:26,074
You are here to see me?

485
00:46:26,408 --> 00:46:27,284
Yes.

486
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:31,288
I was going to tell you

487
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:33,373
that you should lead a better life.

488
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:34,458
What?

489
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:36,502
My dad was...

490
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:40,339
Eun Man-su.

491
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:45,177
You are...

492
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:47,888
Eun Man-su's daughter?

493
00:46:49,389 --> 00:46:50,265
Yes.

494
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:54,478
He's the scapegoat who you used
to cover up your little mistake.

495
00:46:55,437 --> 00:46:57,147
I'm his daughter.

496
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:59,274
-That was--
-Just listen.

497
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:03,028
My dad...

498
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:06,240
was never an arsonist.

499
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:08,742
I’m...

500
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:12,412
not the murderer who killed your son.

501
00:47:13,705 --> 00:47:16,959
But you think you are always right

502
00:47:17,042 --> 00:47:19,795
and that you are never wrong.

503
00:47:20,587 --> 00:47:23,465
On top of that, you even fabricated
evidence and persecuted him.

504
00:47:25,801 --> 00:47:29,429
Have you thought about
how many lives you have ruined?

505
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:32,808
Or how my mother lived?

506
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:36,728
Do you know how hard my life was
because of what you did to me?

507
00:47:38,146 --> 00:47:41,358
You don't know, do you?
You never cared, anyway.

508
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:47,823
Let me tell you again.

509
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:50,742
My dad...

510
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:55,205
was an innocent man who did nothing wrong.

511
00:47:58,458 --> 00:47:59,543
It was you

512
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:02,254
who made a mistake.

513
00:49:26,004 --> 00:49:28,590
No, don't. There's no need. I'm fine.

514
00:49:31,551 --> 00:49:32,511
Sit down.

515
00:49:33,762 --> 00:49:35,222
-Bong-hui.
-Mr. Noh.

516
00:49:36,098 --> 00:49:37,516
Just listen to me, please.

517
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:40,143
You feel really bad...

518
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:42,729
right?

519
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:50,195
Yes.

520
00:49:51,571 --> 00:49:53,490
I know you were a child back then.

521
00:49:54,074 --> 00:49:57,953
I know that the chief prosecutor's mistake
was bigger than yours.

522
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:01,331
That's that. Anyway...

523
00:50:02,624 --> 00:50:04,835
it is true that you did make
the false statement

524
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:06,712
against my dad.

525
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:11,383
You're right.

526
00:50:14,219 --> 00:50:16,346
So wait for my decision.

527
00:50:16,888 --> 00:50:18,807
Whether I should forgive you,

528
00:50:19,057 --> 00:50:20,767
or I should just let things be.

529
00:50:23,311 --> 00:50:24,354
Please sit down.

530
00:50:25,647 --> 00:50:27,649
No, it's really okay.

531
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:30,694
I can do it myself. Don't worry about it.

532
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:34,656
All right, then.

533
00:50:37,743 --> 00:50:38,744
Wait.

534
00:50:49,588 --> 00:50:50,589
Thanks...

535
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:52,632
for coming back.

536
00:50:55,844 --> 00:50:57,304
I didn't come back for good.

537
00:50:58,597 --> 00:51:00,474
I'm just trying to keep
my feelings from work

538
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:03,477
and giving myself time
to think things through.

539
00:51:06,188 --> 00:51:07,481
You're right, but...

540
00:51:09,107 --> 00:51:11,193
this is more than good enough for me.

541
00:51:22,621 --> 00:51:23,663
Just listen to me.

542
00:51:24,122 --> 00:51:26,416
They can settle right away.

543
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:28,084
Gosh, that's not how it works.

544
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:29,878
Are you sure you have
decades of experience?

545
00:51:29,961 --> 00:51:34,007
Goodness, that's how things
used to be done back in the days.

546
00:51:34,090 --> 00:51:35,759
Can we please get this meeting done?

547
00:51:35,842 --> 00:51:37,803
Yes, please. That's what I wanted to say.

548
00:51:37,886 --> 00:51:39,763
Ms. Lack of Evidence, shut it.

549
00:51:39,888 --> 00:51:41,223
Gosh, seriously!

550
00:51:41,556 --> 00:51:43,141
Let's focus on the meeting, please!

551
00:51:43,475 --> 00:51:45,060
You guys are so loud.

552
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:46,353
Hey, don't record this.

553
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:47,854
You're distracting me.

554
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:50,774
Hey, you should've told us
that you were filming us.

555
00:51:50,857 --> 00:51:52,234
Good. Okay.

556
00:51:54,236 --> 00:51:55,529
I look pretty good.

557
00:51:58,073 --> 00:51:59,282
Okay.

558
00:52:02,035 --> 00:52:04,412
Can we please get this meeting done?

559
00:52:04,496 --> 00:52:06,581
Yes, please. That's what I wanted to say.

560
00:52:08,875 --> 00:52:11,086
Hey, shut it.

561
00:52:11,837 --> 00:52:12,921
EDIT

562
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:21,555
Gosh, seriously!
Let's focus on the meeting, please!

563
00:52:21,763 --> 00:52:23,098
Hey, don't record this.

564
00:52:42,033 --> 00:52:43,076
Can you...

565
00:52:44,703 --> 00:52:45,912
recognize me?

566
00:52:53,628 --> 00:52:55,046
Your memory must've come back.

567
00:52:58,717 --> 00:52:59,968
Yes, thanks to you.

568
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:02,137
Then you must know this too.

569
00:53:02,554 --> 00:53:05,015
There's no more loophole
for you to escape through.

570
00:53:05,974 --> 00:53:08,059
You're charged with two counts
of attempted murders,

571
00:53:08,143 --> 00:53:09,227
one of which is mine.

572
00:53:09,811 --> 00:53:12,814
And I'll be sure to prove
that you killed all those people. So...

573
00:53:13,648 --> 00:53:14,941
you better come clean, asshole.

574
00:53:15,942 --> 00:53:19,321
The system in this country is merciful
toward those who confess

575
00:53:19,404 --> 00:53:20,947
and repent their wrongdoings.

576
00:53:21,281 --> 00:53:24,284
But personally,
I don't think scums like you

577
00:53:24,367 --> 00:53:26,828
deserve any mercy.

578
00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:33,919
What was that about?
Are you not totally there yet?

579
00:53:34,002 --> 00:53:35,837
Is that it?
Do you not get what's going on?

580
00:53:35,921 --> 00:53:38,840
No, no. That's not it.

581
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:41,509
This is just a speculation,

582
00:53:41,927 --> 00:53:44,095
but someone might still be on my side.

583
00:53:44,429 --> 00:53:45,805
That's what it was about.

584
00:54:05,367 --> 00:54:07,202
SEONHO DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

585
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:16,169
So you've finally decided to talk?

586
00:54:18,838 --> 00:54:19,965
Mr. Jung.

587
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:29,683
First off...

588
00:54:32,143 --> 00:54:33,645
I killed them all.

589
00:54:37,399 --> 00:54:39,109
Whom shall I start with?

590
00:54:40,276 --> 00:54:41,778
Whom shall I talk about first?

591
00:54:43,238 --> 00:54:46,157
We first met in Chef Yang Jin-wu case,

592
00:54:46,241 --> 00:54:47,701
so shall I start with him?

593
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:49,035
No, no. I take that back.

594
00:54:49,202 --> 00:54:52,163
Supa Apartment.
I should start with Supa Apartment.

595
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:55,542
You've managed to confirm
the identity of only one body

596
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:57,043
found in the water tank there, right?

597
00:54:57,794 --> 00:54:59,295
Shall I tell you who the other one is?

598
00:55:00,714 --> 00:55:02,465
There's no reason for me to say no.

599
00:55:04,384 --> 00:55:05,385
All right.

600
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:08,388
His name is Seong Jae-hyeon.

601
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:10,015
He and Jin-wu
went to the same high school.

602
00:55:10,098 --> 00:55:11,182
Go ahead and check it.

603
00:55:13,518 --> 00:55:14,769
-Is that right?
-I'm not done yet.

604
00:55:14,853 --> 00:55:16,187
How dare you cut me off?

605
00:55:21,067 --> 00:55:22,527
There was one more.

606
00:55:24,863 --> 00:55:26,322
Was his name Jang Hui-jun?

607
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:29,951
Jang Hui-jun?

608
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:34,456
I'm pretty sure it was Jang Hui-jun.
Yes, that was his name.

609
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:38,793
Well... Initially,

610
00:55:39,044 --> 00:55:41,212
I had no intention of killing that dude.

611
00:55:41,379 --> 00:55:43,631
I was doing my thing on the rooftop,

612
00:55:43,715 --> 00:55:44,966
and someone witnessed it.

613
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:46,843
That was Eun Bong-hui.

614
00:55:47,135 --> 00:55:49,471
So I went there to kill her,

615
00:55:49,554 --> 00:55:52,140
but I found a drunk guy instead of her.

616
00:55:53,266 --> 00:55:55,977
I ended up stabbing him with a knife,

617
00:55:57,353 --> 00:55:59,105
and he collapsed, crying.

618
00:56:02,317 --> 00:56:03,401
"Dad.

619
00:56:05,737 --> 00:56:07,030
Dad, save me.

620
00:56:07,405 --> 00:56:08,823
Dad, help me.

621
00:56:10,909 --> 00:56:12,243
I'm terrified."

622
00:56:13,078 --> 00:56:14,412
He was saying things like that.

623
00:56:15,747 --> 00:56:16,998
And he kept crying.

624
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:20,794
Gosh, that dude was such a crybaby,
I couldn't stand it.

625
00:56:20,877 --> 00:56:22,962
So I stabbed him again
and finished him off.

626
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:29,636
That's what happened.

627
00:57:34,826 --> 00:57:37,454
Hey, Ji-hae.
I'm on my way to your office now.

628
00:57:38,371 --> 00:57:39,539
Yes, okay.

629
00:57:46,087 --> 00:57:47,297
I'm sorry.

630
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:03,062
I won't accept your apology.

631
00:58:27,462 --> 00:58:28,546
Come with me for a second.

632
00:58:29,255 --> 00:58:30,298
Why?

633
00:59:40,285 --> 00:59:42,996
I'm calling from the HR department
at the Ministry of Justice.

634
00:59:43,204 --> 00:59:46,457
You are recruited
as an experienced prosecutor.

635
01:00:26,164 --> 01:00:28,166
