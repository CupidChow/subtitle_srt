1
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:35,702
I hesitated to start this
because I was afraid of the end.

2
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:38,163
The moment I realized
my feelings for you...

3
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:40,915
I ran away from you like a coward.

4
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:43,543
Don't fall for me.

5
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:45,712
And I failed

6
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:49,632
because I started to have feelings
for you without realizing.

7
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:51,801
If you feel like it, change your mind.

8
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,553
I'll be waiting. You can take your time.

9
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:56,556
It must be related in some way.

10
00:00:56,681 --> 00:00:59,559
It's about Jung Hyeon-su.
Please run some background check on him.

11
00:00:59,684 --> 00:01:03,480
The guy who was going to report
didn't look like him?

12
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:05,356
-Ms. Eun.
-What a coincidence.

13
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:10,820
It was me who made Ji-uk
defend a murderer.

14
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:11,988
I came here to tell you this.

15
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:16,242
Bong-hui, I'll be reinvestigating
your ex-boyfriend Jang Hui-jun's case.

16
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:19,662
If I witnessed something
without even realizing it...

17
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,498
Bong-hui. Stay here.

18
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:24,709
...and I had to go through everything
I've been through, I feel so wronged.

19
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:29,923
It'll be okay.
I took care of it perfectly.

20
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:31,883
Hey, Ji-uk. Our client's here.

21
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:35,470
I can see what's ahead of me. I can see
what's going to happen in the future.

22
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:39,015
There's a probability
that two people will die soon.

23
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:42,769
I changed my mind.

24
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:45,730
I started to feel pressured
and uncomfortable to accept your feelings.

25
00:01:46,105 --> 00:01:49,317
Please respect my feelings
and my decision.

26
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:51,986
You said you can foresee the future.
Is it true?

27
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:55,573
I get hunches. It only happens
once in a while though.

28
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:59,160
You said two people at my firm
might die. Was that also true?

29
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:00,453
Yes, that's true too.

30
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,210
I should get going.

31
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:08,753
-Thank you so much.
-You're welcome.

32
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:10,004
-Bye.
-Bye.

33
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:19,597
Gosh, no!

34
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:35,989
By the way, I'm not...

35
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:39,075
a swindler after all, right?

36
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:02,140
Don't cry too much, Mr. Noh.

37
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,519
Everything will be okay.

38
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:14,193
Yes, Mr. Noh.

39
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:21,576
Where am I now? I am...

40
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:24,996
Okay. Stay where you are.

41
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:27,874
All of us

42
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,209
have lost someone.

43
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:32,503
Some lost a family member.

44
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:34,505
Some lost a friend.

45
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,257
Some lost a lover.

46
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:39,135
Whether the person was kind or evil,

47
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:41,179
there is no one

48
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:43,806
who didn't lose someone

49
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:46,142
in their course of life.

50
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,774
Therefore, life is cruel.

51
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:57,946
If that's true,

52
00:03:58,529 --> 00:04:00,657
during this cruel, limited period of time

53
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:02,533
and in a way,

54
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:05,495
in this brief lifetime,

55
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:07,872
the only thing we can do is...

56
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:24,764
Bong-hui.

57
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:30,687
Please...

58
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:34,649
Please like me back.

59
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,362
I'm sorry I couldn't keep my promise

60
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:42,282
that I would wait for you.

61
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:45,076
Bong-hui,

62
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:49,038
I want you to like me back now.

63
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:03,863
What should I...

64
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:05,948
do now?

65
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:32,809
What's wrong?

66
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:37,355
I'm the one who should ask you
that question.

67
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:40,525
Why did you suddenly confess your feelings

68
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:43,319
in the middle of the street?
I felt pressured.

69
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:44,654
I just...

70
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:48,449
suddenly felt like...

71
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:50,827
I was wasting my time.

72
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:53,704
It's your turn, Bong-hui.

73
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:56,374
I know there's something going on.

74
00:06:58,459 --> 00:06:59,377
What is it?

75
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:20,314
I'm just really exhausted.

76
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:22,275
Today was just one of those days

77
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:24,902
that you find everything annoying,
and you just want to cry.

78
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:27,363
That's when I ran into you.

79
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:30,074
That's why I cried,
which really wasn't like me.

80
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:41,252
Jung Hyeon-su.

81
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,300
Is it because of Jung Hyeon-su?

82
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,730
What do you know of him?

83
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:42,104
Long time no see, my friend.

84
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:55,034
What about you?

85
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:57,203
What do you know?

86
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:07,964
I know that Jung Hyeon-su...

87
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:14,554
might be

88
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:16,138
the murderer.

89
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:22,603
He could be the one who murdered
Chef Yang.

90
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,688
And maybe...

91
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:30,611
This is just an over interpreted guess.

92
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:32,238
I have no evidence to prove it.

93
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:33,322
It's just...

94
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:36,909
something I guessed based on my instincts.

95
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,786
It's a nonscientific guess.

96
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:42,957
You're so mean.

97
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,421
Why didn't you tell me
when you knew everything?

98
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:50,339
You said you won't keep things from me.

99
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:55,094
Okay, I shouldn't have done that.
I'm sorry.

100
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:56,637
Then stop everything you're doing.

101
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:58,889
Stop expressing your feelings for me.

102
00:09:58,973 --> 00:09:59,974
I'm sorry,

103
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,310
but I don't want to.

104
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:04,437
-What do you mean?
-Why do we have to be like this

105
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,646
because of a jerk like him?

106
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:07,732
Do you really not know why?

107
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:08,941
No.

108
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,318
That's why I'm asking you.

109
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:13,029
-Try putting yourself in my shoes.
-I do.

110
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,824
I think a lot about how you might feel.

111
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:21,454
I know you're blaming yourself.

112
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:23,623
"I lured the criminal.

113
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:24,832
It's all because of me.

114
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:26,834
I defended a criminal

115
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:27,960
and set him free."

116
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:30,963
You're going through a hard time.
I know that already.

117
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,966
You're right. You know very well.

118
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:35,259
But I'm trying to tell you...

119
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:37,887
that you're mistaken.

120
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:39,805
No, you're wrong. It's the truth.

121
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,307
It's not the truth. It's an accident.

122
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,938
You got into an accident
called Jung Hyeon-su.

123
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:50,608
And I'm going to get through this accident

124
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:52,401
with you.

125
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,904
My decision won't change
even if you try to push me away.

126
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,197
I'm definitely...

127
00:10:57,281 --> 00:10:58,658
going to catch Jung Hyeon-su.

128
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:04,830
So you need to make a decision.

129
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,751
Do you want us

130
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:10,878
to go through this separately?

131
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:14,715
Or do you want to do this together?

132
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:17,676
I want us...

133
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:22,598
to do this together.

134
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:30,875
I told you not to leave me, Yeon-wu.

135
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:33,085
Let's put an end to this.
We should just die together.

136
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:01,989
CHOI YEON-WU

137
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:11,290
Hey, Yeon-wu. It's been such a long...

138
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,546
What happened?

139
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:30,309
Where are you going at this hour?

140
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:32,311
Oh, well...

141
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:35,523
A friend of mine had a mishap.

142
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:36,607
A mishap?

143
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:38,234
Yes.

144
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,114
Yeon-wu!

145
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:45,658
Yeon-wu.

146
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,077
Hey, what happened?

147
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,162
Look at me. Let me have a look.
What happened?

148
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:53,791
I broke up with my ex-boyfriend,
and he said we should die together.

149
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,501
What?

150
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:59,213
Why, that fucking asshole...

151
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:01,215
Where's that jerk now?

152
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,175
He's in the holding cell.

153
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:08,222
But we couldn't find the weapon
you insisted he attacked you with.

154
00:14:08,847 --> 00:14:11,183
He really tried to stab me with a knife.

155
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:13,644
She has this cut
seemingly brushed by a knife.

156
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:16,939
It should be considered attempted murder
if he brandished a weapon.

157
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:18,691
However... Excuse me for a second.

158
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:21,694
The wound is too insignificant
to insist that was the case.

159
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:24,780
Plus, there's no evidence
it was done by her ex-boyfriend.

160
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:25,948
What are you talking about?

161
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:27,908
I'm telling him the fact.

162
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:31,161
He can be detained
for up to 48 hours, right?

163
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:32,329
Yes, that's correct.

164
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:34,707
And we have to find
a suspect or the weapon

165
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,083
in order to request a warrant.

166
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,961
We'll go through the CCTV footages
around the time of his arrest.

167
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:40,379
We'll do a thorough search.

168
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:42,965
Please find something.

169
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:45,551
You have to find something
within 48 hours.

170
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:52,683
I'll kill her.

171
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:57,479
You should go in.

172
00:14:57,771 --> 00:15:00,232
-Thanks.
-Don't worry too much.

173
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:31,055
You two must be close friends.

174
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:35,726
I met her while preparing
for the bar exam.

175
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:38,771
I see. I guess you guys
used to study together.

176
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,440
No, I was a regular at her parent's diner.

177
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:50,491
I'm really upset.

178
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:53,202
Why did she date a jerk like that?

179
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:11,971
I just...

180
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:15,599
suddenly felt like...

181
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,268
I was wasting my time.

182
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:46,755
Then stop everything you're doing.

183
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,799
Stop expressing your feelings for me.

184
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:49,800
I'm sorry,

185
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:53,804
-but I don't want to.
-What do you mean?

186
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:56,348
Why do we have to be like this
because of a jerk like him?

187
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:13,240
So you need to make a decision.

188
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:17,494
Do you want us
to go through this separately? Or...

189
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:21,498
do you want to go through it together?

190
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,001
I want you by my side

191
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:26,962
when we go through this.

192
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:19,723
Hey, hey! Goodness!

193
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:22,101
What do you think you're doing now?
What are you looking at?

194
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,269
I came to tell you something.

195
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:25,813
What is it?

196
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:29,525
I thought hard all night.

197
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,652
And I've decided to live with no shame.

198
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:35,614
Who cares, right? We should just
be selfish and live as we please.

199
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:43,622
Let's start today.
Today is our first day. See you.

200
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:47,334
Hey, what does that mean?
What did you say?

201
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:49,294
Let's start a relationship.

202
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:50,420
What relationship...

203
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:58,178
That relationship.

204
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:01,682
I have a girlfriend now.

205
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:12,860
I finally told him.

206
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:20,117
Does that mean today
is our first day together?

207
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:01,992
What's going on? What brought
such a drastic change in mood?

208
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,578
It's like night and day.

209
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:07,831
It's like going from a fall-winter
collection to a spring-summer one.

210
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:14,838
By the way, did the two of you not
get a good night's sleep or what?

211
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:16,548
I didn't get any sleep.

212
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:17,633
Same here.

213
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:20,344
Gosh, you two must've gotten insomnia
from Ji-uk.

214
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,387
What that crazy guy said...

215
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,640
keeps bothering me.

216
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:27,809
He said that two people from here
will die.

217
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,311
I think

218
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:33,023
you and I will be those two people.

219
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:35,442
Why are you dragging me into it?

220
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:37,694
Oh, I guess none of you
have heard the news about...

221
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:38,862
What news?

222
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:41,949
It's nothing.

223
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:44,243
Don't cry so much,

224
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:46,203
Mr. Noh.

225
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,666
Everything will be okay.

226
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:54,378
Anyhow, from now on,
no matter what happens,

227
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:56,421
no one can talk about anyone dying.

228
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:58,257
-Just don't talk about it, okay?
-By the way,

229
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:02,844
did I tell you that my doctor
wants to me to get tests done again?

230
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:07,349
Gosh, I must be terminally ill--

231
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:10,018
Mr. Noh just said we can't talk
about things like that.

232
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,396
You always have to cut me off
like that, don't you?

233
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:16,191
-With all due respect--
-Don't even begin if you have any respect.

234
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,734
Our meeting is going nowhere.

235
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:19,987
Why are you trying to blame me?
It's all your fault.

236
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,780
Today, it's your fault.

237
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:24,992
Be quiet! Go get me a glass of water.
I need to take my medication.

238
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:28,287
The older you get, the more you need
to move around to stay healthy.

239
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,372
Hey, Ms. Lack of Evidence!

240
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:31,957
-Yes?
-Goodness.

241
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:33,625
Young people these days...

242
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:35,585
I should try to be understanding.

243
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:39,172
What? What is it?

244
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:40,674
-What is it?
-Well...

245
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,720
You know...

246
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:47,472
I told you about my family,

247
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:49,224
didn't I?

248
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:51,435
Yes, you told me.

249
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:56,315
My parents' friends who raised me

250
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:58,734
are my parents now.
I told you about them too,

251
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:00,235
right?

252
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,570
Yes, you did.

253
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:04,448
I really think they are like angels.

254
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:08,577
But I didn't tell you

255
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:11,455
who they are.

256
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:12,748
No.

257
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:13,874
Who are they?

258
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:16,460
One of them is Mr. Byeon.

259
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:17,753
I see. Mr. Byeon?

260
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:21,298
Byeon...

261
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:27,429
Mr. Byeon?

262
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:31,058
Yes.

263
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:33,226
-It's him.
-I know you.

264
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,436
You are a murderer.

265
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:35,395
Ms. Lack of Evidence.

266
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:36,438
Ms. Lack of Evidence!

267
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:38,482
We have a secretary.
It's Ms. Lack of Evidence.

268
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:41,735
Ms. Lack of Evidence, you lost my trial!

269
00:22:41,943 --> 00:22:43,528
Hey! Look at you.

270
00:22:44,237 --> 00:22:45,280
Are you all right?

271
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:51,620
We are doomed.

272
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:58,835
I do think we are doomed.

273
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:07,844
What are you up to?

274
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,263
Why are you smiling?

275
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:11,807
I'm not up to anything.

276
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:12,891
Don't smile.

277
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:14,935
It makes me feel sick.

278
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:23,443
I'm done.

279
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:25,320
I'm finished.

280
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:51,221
Yes?

281
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:54,474
What?

282
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:55,725
You found him?

283
00:23:58,145 --> 00:23:59,646
Thank you for contacting me.

284
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:01,982
Okay. All right.

285
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:05,527
Nice!

286
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:21,084
Whom did they find?

287
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:27,007
Were you still investigating
Jung Hyeon-su?

288
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:29,342
To be more precise,

289
00:24:32,762 --> 00:24:34,472
I found the identity
of the man in the photo.

290
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:40,979
I explicitly told you to stop
investigating him temporarily.

291
00:24:42,939 --> 00:24:44,566
So you don't want me to brief you?

292
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:49,362
Well, I mean...

293
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:52,449
It'd be rude if I don't,
since you investigated.

294
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:54,367
You don't need to be so formal between us.

295
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:55,410
You don't need to hear it.

296
00:24:55,493 --> 00:24:56,703
No, no.

297
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:01,875
I'd like to hear your report.
Please tell me.

298
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:12,093
-I met Go Chan-ho's teacher.
-I will look into that.

299
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:14,012
Thank you.

300
00:25:14,137 --> 00:25:15,430
Did he have any close friends?

301
00:25:15,513 --> 00:25:17,140
-I went to the youth club...
-I don't know.

302
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:19,309
...he went during his high school days.

303
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:20,560
Finally,

304
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:24,272
I received a call.

305
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:26,608
He was in a senior class
in Go Chan-ho's high school.

306
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:29,236
There was a reason why I couldn't find him
in the year book.

307
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:30,946
They all graduated in different years.

308
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:32,822
But what on earth...

309
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:35,992
happened between them?

310
00:25:37,118 --> 00:25:38,203
Firstly,

311
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:39,955
I will meet with Kim Min-gu.

312
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:41,164
Since I found out who he is,

313
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:43,541
I'm sure I can find out
his address and contact quickly.

314
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:49,923
Hello?

315
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,841
It's me.

316
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:54,886
We just identified the body
in the water tank.

317
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:58,682
Luckily, he was in the database
of the missing person.

318
00:25:58,765 --> 00:26:00,475
We found his identity quite fast.

319
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:04,896
No, we only identified one body,
not all of them.

320
00:26:06,022 --> 00:26:06,940
His name is

321
00:26:07,023 --> 00:26:08,108
-Kim Min-gu.
-Kim Min-gu.

322
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:11,027
How did you know?

323
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:13,655
When was
the missing person's report filed?

324
00:26:14,322 --> 00:26:16,074
STATUS OF GO CHAN-HO'S DISAPPEARANCE

325
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,451
Go Chan-Ho, the forensic officer,

326
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:21,413
said he wanted to give Bong-hui
information about the real killer.

327
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:22,706
After that, he's gone missing.

328
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:25,125
And this man.

329
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:29,671
This man was recently found dead
in the water tank on the roof top.

330
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,131
When did he disappear?

331
00:26:31,214 --> 00:26:32,382
The date of his disappearance

332
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:34,301
is around the date
of Jang Hui-jun's murder.

333
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:36,761
-Which means--
-Everything is connected.

334
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:39,514
And this is the murder weapon
used in Jang Hui-jun's murder.

335
00:26:39,597 --> 00:26:40,807
The size of the murder weapon

336
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:43,143
happens to match the size
of Chef Yang's murder weapon.

337
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:45,645
This implies the murderer
of these two cases is the same.

338
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:47,397
-That's right. He is--
-Jung Hyeon-su.

339
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:50,650
Jung Hyeon-su was listening
to the same song

340
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:53,361
that I heard on the night
of Hui-jun’s murder.

341
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:55,655
We don't have

342
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:56,948
any physical evidence, do we?

343
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:59,034
No. None at all.

344
00:27:00,618 --> 00:27:02,037
First, we should find that man.

345
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:03,413
But...

346
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:07,167
what if something bad happened
to that guy too?

347
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:08,835
Nothing might have happened to him.

348
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:10,587
We should have hope and look for him.

349
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:12,756
No.

350
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:15,467
We are going to stop everything here.

351
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:18,470
We are civilians
without any investigative right.

352
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:20,096
I am going to let the prosecution
take over.

353
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,222
Which means

354
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:24,225
everyone in this room

355
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:26,102
cannot make a rash move...

356
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:28,229
or do anything.

357
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:30,023
I agree with Ji-uk on this.

358
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:32,901
I will notify Prosecutor Cha.

359
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:34,778
All right. That's all.

360
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:47,665
Are you feeling all right?

361
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:51,878
That's a relief.

362
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:56,925
Don't look back.

363
00:27:57,717 --> 00:27:58,927
I don't even want to see it.

364
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:07,185
SEONHO DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

365
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:11,064
Prosecutor Cha.

366
00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:15,652
I'm glad I caught you.
I came here to see you.

367
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:18,696
Why? You said you wanted
to meet only coincidentally.

368
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:19,989
Why did you contact me?

369
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:23,910
-Then should I not?
-I didn't say that.

370
00:28:25,286 --> 00:28:26,830
Well, it's nice

371
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:29,249
if you want to get in touch with me.

372
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:31,209
Goodness, Yu-jeong.

373
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:36,297
Hello, Ms. Na.

374
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:39,509
Hello, Mr. Ji.

375
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:42,887
Let go. I said let go.

376
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:45,515
-You need to let go first.
-Hold on. Wait!

377
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:47,225
-Darn it.
-All right. There you go.

378
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:51,688
Have a good day then.

379
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:54,023
I need to talk to you.

380
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:54,983
Okay.

381
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:01,573
What was that?

382
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:03,908
I think he just laughed at me.

383
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:06,453
No way. He couldn't have.

384
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:12,792
You are suspecting Jung Hyeon-su
to be the murderer?

385
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:14,085
Well, not exactly.

386
00:29:15,336 --> 00:29:18,214
So far, we just think that he has
something to do with the murders.

387
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:31,895
To be honest,

388
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,314
something about him
didn't sit right with me.

389
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:36,816
I see.

390
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:38,943
So?

391
00:29:39,235 --> 00:29:41,237
What do you really want to tell me?

392
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:43,490
We need the authority to investigate.

393
00:29:44,365 --> 00:29:46,284
There's nothing we can do.

394
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:48,745
Okay.

395
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:50,705
By the way,

396
00:29:50,997 --> 00:29:52,999
why are you guys involved
in the case this deeply?

397
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:54,626
Is it about justice?

398
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:55,794
Or...

399
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:58,421
is it about Bong-hui?

400
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:00,673
Can't it be both?

401
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:05,595
I feel terrible.

402
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:08,348
I feel like I have been replaced.

403
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:11,601
Regardless of my wrongdoings,
I have lost you guys,

404
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:13,770
and now I have to investigate for her.

405
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:17,106
What should I do?
Should I look for another prosecutor?

406
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:18,900
No.

407
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:20,276
I'll do it.

408
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:22,821
However,

409
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:24,906
don't be so harsh on me.

410
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:28,284
You know that you guys are
the only friends I have.

411
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:36,417
Please look into this case for us.

412
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:41,673
But,

413
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:43,842
you shouldn't personally handle it.

414
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:45,343
Jung Hyeon-su is dangerous.

415
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:52,392
You know there are strong
and experienced investigators.

416
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:53,643
Ask them to help you.

417
00:30:53,726 --> 00:30:55,645
I'm also strong and experienced.

418
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:58,273
I can take care of myself
and protect others.

419
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,441
You know me.

420
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,278
Right, I know you.

421
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:06,948
I guess I went a too far.

422
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:12,370
Be careful.

423
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:15,748
Being careful won't cause any harm.

424
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:20,962
I'm going now.

425
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:29,262
Still nothing?

426
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:32,015
The weapon wasn't caught
on any CCTV cameras in the area

427
00:31:32,098 --> 00:31:33,683
around the time of the incident.

428
00:31:33,766 --> 00:31:35,768
It happened at night,
and the angle wasn't ideal either.

429
00:31:36,185 --> 00:31:38,897
We also searched the area,
but we couldn't find anything.

430
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:42,901
We'd like to know where he was
before he got arrested.

431
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:43,943
Is that okay?

432
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:49,032
You don't have to tag along like this.

433
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:50,617
I'll figure it out on my own from here on.

434
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:51,701
What will you do now, then?

435
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:54,037
I need to find the weapon.

436
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,038
All by yourself?

437
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:57,874
That's nonsense. Even the police
wasn't able to find it.

438
00:31:58,082 --> 00:32:00,710
If that jerk gets released
with no weapon found,

439
00:32:00,793 --> 00:32:02,378
I know exactly what he's going to do.

440
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:04,422
He'll come to get her again.

441
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:05,924
You're right. That's highly likely.

442
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:07,508
-But still--
-I should still

443
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:10,219
try my best with whatever it is
that I can do.

444
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:12,722
All right. Good luck with it.

445
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:13,806
Thanks.

446
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:23,358
Let's go and find that weapon.

447
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:25,109
Goodness.

448
00:32:33,993 --> 00:32:35,370
Didn't it happen over there?

449
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:36,663
It did.

450
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:41,125
It was right here.

451
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:48,132
Then...

452
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:24,836
They said he went in there, right?

453
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:27,588
Do you think he could've left it in there?

454
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:30,299
If you go in there,

455
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:32,927
it could be seen as trespassing
on public property for sexual purposes.

456
00:33:48,901 --> 00:33:50,653
Shit. Damn it.

457
00:33:55,616 --> 00:33:56,617
There's nothing.

458
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:58,661
Let's go.

459
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:16,054
It happened quite long ago.

460
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:19,849
All the garbage from that time
must've been picked up already.

461
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:23,227
Are you really sure?

462
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:51,631
Let's go.

463
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:02,391
There's certainly a problem here.

464
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:08,689
Hey, you guys are back.

465
00:35:10,024 --> 00:35:12,485
Gosh, what on earth happened?
What is this smell?

466
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:14,487
Right? They really stink.

467
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:19,158
I feel like throwing up.
It's nasty, right?

468
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:20,660
I don't smell anything.

469
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:26,207
Anyway, that's not important right now.

470
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:28,376
We couldn't find the weapon.

471
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:29,961
We have less than 24 hours now.

472
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:31,587
Oh, your friend's case, right?

473
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,506
What about the witness?

474
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:37,009
Not yet. I know which school
she goes to because of her uniform,

475
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:40,096
but I couldn't track her down
among all the students.

476
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:41,472
I see.

477
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:44,100
By the way, I'm getting

478
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:45,810
a bad feeling about this case.

479
00:35:46,018 --> 00:35:48,729
I feel like that jerk was determined
to harm her.

480
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:51,983
Don't cry so much,

481
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:53,568
Mr. Noh.

482
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:56,362
No, nothing will happen.
Everything will be fine. That can't be.

483
00:35:56,445 --> 00:35:57,363
Pardon?

484
00:35:59,907 --> 00:36:01,909
What? I was just saying
you should go wash up.

485
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:05,079
We should wash up for everything
to be okay. What I mean is

486
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:08,082
we won't get sick
if we get rid of all the germs. Let's go.

487
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:10,751
Don't you smell anything?

488
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:12,712
Thank goodness.

489
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:14,005
They'll wash up.

490
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:15,089
Thank goodness indeed.

491
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:17,258
Where's the air freshener?

492
00:36:27,226 --> 00:36:28,269
Alibi...

493
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:33,441
I need an alibi.

494
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:48,706
No, I have to come up
with the order first.

495
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:52,376
Who's going to go first?

496
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:03,387
If we can't find the weapon
or any witness,

497
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:05,473
it'll be considered
as a simple assault case,

498
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:07,099
and he'll just get a fine.

499
00:37:07,683 --> 00:37:09,810
Right. That's why we have to find it.

500
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:12,230
Yes, we have to find it. We must.

501
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:16,150
By the way, why are you guys still
working at this late hour?

502
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:18,569
We have a lot of work, Ji-uk.

503
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:19,779
Unlike someone.

504
00:37:19,862 --> 00:37:20,905
That's right.

505
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:25,243
Okay, fine. Let's say that is the case.

506
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:28,079
But what I'm saying is,
you can work on it at home.

507
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:30,248
Why do you guys have to work here
until this late hour?

508
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:32,083
Today is the first day.

509
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:33,709
No, it's not.
It's the middle of the month.

510
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:35,461
My credit card payment was paid yesterday.

511
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,380
By first day, do you mean...

512
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:39,757
-that kind of first day?
-What do you mean?

513
00:37:45,012 --> 00:37:46,347
Hey, go find the witness.

514
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:49,100
You'll find a clue if you watch
CCTV footage until your eyes hurt.

515
00:37:49,183 --> 00:37:50,434
I told you that I'm busy.

516
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:52,853
Then I'll help you like the last time.

517
00:37:53,187 --> 00:37:54,397
For goodness' sake.

518
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:56,482
I'll try to track her down
using social media.

519
00:37:56,565 --> 00:37:57,733
You said she's in high school.

520
00:37:58,025 --> 00:37:59,527
Then she must be on social media.

521
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:02,405
How can we use it to find her?

522
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:05,116
Well, we can look up
the school's name as a hashtag

523
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:07,034
and see if anything about the case
has been posted.

524
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:08,536
If that doesn't work,

525
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:11,205
we can look for her
with the school's name as a hashtag.

526
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:17,920
You guys are not following, are you?

527
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:21,716
Don't you use social media?

528
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:24,510
Are you really not on Instagram,
Facebook, and Twitter?

529
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:29,724
Bong-hui, you don't use it either?
To record your daily lives and stuff.

530
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:33,686
Oh, I keep a journal.
I handwrite it though.

531
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:35,604
Dude,

532
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:39,984
Alex Ferguson said that social media
is a waste of time.

533
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:41,110
That is true.

534
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:44,196
I see. All right.

535
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:46,991
Then I'll go waste my time
and use social media

536
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:49,618
in order to track down that girl
all on my own.

537
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:53,039
Gosh, you guys are seriously...
Good grief.

538
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:54,749
You guys are amazing.

539
00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:56,459
They're such nerds.

540
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:58,044
Right, social media. That's it.

541
00:38:58,711 --> 00:38:59,712
Goodness.

542
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:01,714
They should just go home.

543
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:04,008
Darn it.

544
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:26,030
Today must've been stressful for you.

545
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:29,283
Don't worry about it. But I must say,

546
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:31,369
going through the dumpster was a bit much.

547
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:35,790
Which tea do you want?

548
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:39,085
Anything.

549
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,961
Anything? Okay.

550
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:55,476
Thanks for everything today.

551
00:39:57,353 --> 00:39:58,354
Look at you.

552
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:01,482
Come here.

553
00:40:03,275 --> 00:40:04,985
That's enough to celebrate our first day.

554
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:14,495
She's pretty good at this.

555
00:40:16,163 --> 00:40:17,164
That girl.

556
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:25,089
Don't work too hard.

557
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:47,695
You can drink this. Hey, drink it.

558
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:58,122
Gosh, this is bitter. What is it?

559
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:01,584
Is this drinkable?

560
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:02,668
What is this?

561
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:20,478
Tomorrow, I have to find the weapon,
a witness, or something

562
00:41:21,103 --> 00:41:22,730
and have a warrant issued.

563
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:32,990
Focus on. Look.

564
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:37,912
Take the photo and upload it.

565
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:43,667
-Is that it?
-Yes.

566
00:41:45,419 --> 00:41:47,338
Come on. Try it. I'm going to check.

567
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:54,470
-Take the photo.
-Take the photo.

568
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:57,097
-Upload it.
-It worked!

569
00:41:57,515 --> 00:41:59,975
It was uploaded.

570
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:03,896
HELLO

571
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,315
THIS IS COOL
#FIRST UPLOAD, #SELFIE, #BONGBONG

572
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:10,653
Ta-da. I liked your photo.

573
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:11,946
So did I.

574
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:15,908
I also liked my own photo.

575
00:42:17,826 --> 00:42:19,578
-This is new.
-I like this.

576
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:21,830
I liked your photo too, Eun-hyeok.

577
00:42:22,748 --> 00:42:24,041
I have two likes.

578
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:29,296
Ms. Eun, you look good in the photo.

579
00:42:30,464 --> 00:42:32,341
DONGBANG HIGH SCHOOL

580
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,177
-Look at him.
-Gosh, you are so handsome.

581
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:36,178
He's amazingly hot.

582
00:42:36,303 --> 00:42:37,638
He's so good looking.

583
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:53,862
You guys are the ones
who wrote comments online, right?

584
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:57,866
What's up?

585
00:42:58,951 --> 00:43:00,244
You are not that bad to look at.

586
00:43:00,327 --> 00:43:02,621
Well, I have great looks actually.

587
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:04,832
What am I saying?

588
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:08,627
I shouldn't act like your peers.
I'm an adult after all.

589
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:10,004
Anyhow,

590
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:13,215
there was someone who witnessed

591
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:15,634
an assault around here
the night before yesterday?

592
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:18,846
Yes, but she won't testify.

593
00:43:19,054 --> 00:43:20,431
Leave that to me.

594
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:23,309
Where can I find her?

595
00:43:30,232 --> 00:43:33,527
I'm glad I caught you, Ji-hae.
I need to talk to you.

596
00:43:34,486 --> 00:43:35,487
What is it?

597
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,699
Don't try to assault me again.
Just tell me.

598
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:41,452
When did I assault you?

599
00:43:42,661 --> 00:43:46,290
What do you think about the crimes
committed after breakups

600
00:43:46,373 --> 00:43:47,541
that are on the rise nowadays?

601
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:52,046
Are you here to tell me you broke up
with Hui-jun because of me

602
00:43:52,254 --> 00:43:54,214
and physically abuse me again?

603
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:56,967
How did you become a prosecutor
with that head of yours?

604
00:43:57,676 --> 00:44:00,262
I feel extremely uncomfortable

605
00:44:00,596 --> 00:44:02,890
to hear that from you, okay?

606
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:04,600
Obviously, I'm not.

607
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:10,230
You don't know the number of people
who reported assault by their boyfriends

608
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:12,858
for the last five years
is over 30,000, right?

609
00:44:12,941 --> 00:44:15,319
I don't run the statistics.
How would I know that?

610
00:44:15,527 --> 00:44:19,323
Average of seven women per month
are dead due to dating violence.

611
00:44:19,406 --> 00:44:21,784
You ought to know this as a prosecutor.

612
00:44:22,034 --> 00:44:24,286
So what do you want from me?

613
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:30,626
Gather up all the related previous cases

614
00:44:30,709 --> 00:44:32,252
and run an investigation for me.

615
00:44:32,586 --> 00:44:34,630
Get some attention to your investigation.

616
00:44:34,713 --> 00:44:36,048
Inform the public of precautions.

617
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:38,467
I have a suitable case to hand you over.

618
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:41,136
If you look into other cases,
I'm sure you'll find more cases.

619
00:44:41,261 --> 00:44:43,722
Hey, this isn't easy.

620
00:44:44,264 --> 00:44:47,476
I know that crimes committed
after breakups are problems.

621
00:44:47,893 --> 00:44:50,604
There are no legal acts
that can prevent the crimes.

622
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:54,233
Besides, they have to commit crimes
for me to arrest

623
00:44:54,316 --> 00:44:57,319
and punish them. What can I do
before the crimes even occur?

624
00:44:57,778 --> 00:45:00,906
I knew it. You are not capable of this.
It was a waste of time.

625
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:02,533
-Hey!
-What?

626
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:19,758
There are only two hours left
until we reach the 48th hour.

627
00:45:25,431 --> 00:45:26,640
Yes, Mr. Ji.

628
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:30,936
Yes. Should I go?

629
00:45:34,022 --> 00:45:36,150
Then I will go see Yeon-wu then.

630
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:39,736
Yes. Okay, I got it.

631
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:42,030
Thank you so much.

632
00:45:42,489 --> 00:45:43,532
Okay.

633
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:48,203
Mr. Ji is really helpful.

634
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:49,621
I'm so touched.

635
00:45:51,248 --> 00:45:52,291
He is.

636
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,001
He is indeed.

637
00:46:01,383 --> 00:46:02,843
What about me?

638
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:05,179
What about me? I'm doing my hardest too.

639
00:46:18,066 --> 00:46:21,403
I told you to look into and save
all the text messages

640
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:25,491
and letters Choi Yeon-wu received, right?

641
00:46:26,074 --> 00:46:27,493
Yes, I did those.

642
00:46:27,993 --> 00:46:31,163
You did? Okay. Good job.

643
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:35,542
I'm going to meet Yeon-wu later.

644
00:46:35,792 --> 00:46:39,004
My instincts tell me
that I should be with her today.

645
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:45,761
I'll come with you.

646
00:46:45,928 --> 00:46:47,846
What? I'll be all right.

647
00:46:49,181 --> 00:46:51,058
My instincts tell me...

648
00:46:52,184 --> 00:46:53,727
that I should come with you.

649
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:22,464
Yes, this is Bang Eun-ho speaking.

650
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:25,092
You found him?

651
00:47:26,468 --> 00:47:27,511
Okay.

652
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:31,223
I see.

653
00:47:31,807 --> 00:47:34,977
He recently came to Korea. I see.

654
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:38,230
His name is Lee Jae-ho?

655
00:47:38,897 --> 00:47:39,898
I see.

656
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:42,484
Do you have his address and phone number?

657
00:47:43,068 --> 00:47:44,111
Okay.

658
00:47:47,781 --> 00:47:49,366
Yes. Thank you.

659
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:52,995
Thank you so much. Goodbye.

660
00:47:57,958 --> 00:48:00,085
We are civilians
without any investigative authority.

661
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:02,588
I'm going to let the prosecution
take over.

662
00:48:02,754 --> 00:48:06,174
Which means everyone in this room

663
00:48:06,341 --> 00:48:09,553
cannot make a rash move or do anything.

664
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:17,728
After your message,
press the star or the sharp button.

665
00:48:17,811 --> 00:48:18,895
LAWYER NOH JI-UK

666
00:48:19,021 --> 00:48:21,231
I'm on my way to Lee Jae-ho, Mr. Noh.

667
00:48:21,898 --> 00:48:24,151
You know the other man
in Go Chan-ho’s photo?

668
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:25,444
I found his whereabouts.

669
00:48:26,028 --> 00:48:28,488
He has been abroad until recently
and just moved back to Korea.

670
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:32,117
I think that I should make a move
before Jung Hyeon-su gets to him.

671
00:48:32,534 --> 00:48:35,704
I will leave you his number
and address just in case.

672
00:48:35,954 --> 00:48:36,955
Bye.

673
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:42,294
Can he go there by himself?

674
00:48:42,711 --> 00:48:45,672
I told him not to do this.
Goodness, Mr. Bang.

675
00:48:46,214 --> 00:48:47,299
Should I call him?

676
00:48:47,799 --> 00:48:48,925
He won't listen.

677
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:51,011
It's not like we don't know how he is.

678
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:54,556
Then go to Mr. Bang.

679
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,141
I will go to Yeon-wu.

680
00:48:58,101 --> 00:48:59,436
Do you think you'll be okay alone?

681
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:01,146
Of course. Don't worry.

682
00:49:02,689 --> 00:49:04,024
Goodness.

683
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:08,111
Okay. Let's do that.

684
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:18,664
I'll call you.
You should call me too, okay?

685
00:49:18,747 --> 00:49:19,956
I will.

686
00:49:23,377 --> 00:49:24,419
Bong-hui.

687
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:28,382
Be careful.

688
00:49:31,259 --> 00:49:32,511
Don't worry.

689
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:57,703
-Hey, Yeon-wu.
-Bong-hui!

690
00:49:57,911 --> 00:49:59,287
You didn't have to come.

691
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:01,123
Come on, that's nonsense.

692
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:03,917
A lawyer must protect her client.

693
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:07,337
Follow me. I'll protect you tonight.

694
00:50:08,964 --> 00:50:11,174
-Let's go.
-Let's get going.

695
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:13,093
Are you done for the night?

696
00:50:20,225 --> 00:50:21,601
MY FRIENDS ARE SO PRETTY!

697
00:50:21,727 --> 00:50:23,270
Come on.

698
00:50:28,233 --> 00:50:29,359
Yes, Detective.

699
00:50:30,318 --> 00:50:32,779
I know that our 48 hours are up.

700
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:35,741
Please, give us a bit more time.

701
00:50:36,032 --> 00:50:38,410
I want to hold him for a longer time too,

702
00:50:39,161 --> 00:50:41,121
but I can't hold him
for more than 48 hours.

703
00:50:42,497 --> 00:50:45,292
I really believe
that I can meet up with the witness.

704
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:48,336
I don't even need that much time.
Please give me a bit more time.

705
00:50:50,297 --> 00:50:51,757
She's here. I just met her.

706
00:50:51,923 --> 00:50:53,633
Detective, please do me a favor. Okay?

707
00:50:55,093 --> 00:50:56,094
Hello.

708
00:50:57,053 --> 00:50:59,097
Do you know how long I've waited for you?

709
00:50:59,431 --> 00:51:00,432
Me?

710
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:01,767
Who are you?

711
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:04,978
Anyway, thank you so much for coming.

712
00:51:05,437 --> 00:51:08,690
So can you spare me some time
to do a good deed?

713
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:14,279
They won't issue an arrest warrant,
so you'll be out in no time.

714
00:51:14,362 --> 00:51:15,739
Don't worry. You just need to wait.

715
00:51:15,864 --> 00:51:16,990
I trust that I'm in good hands.

716
00:51:17,073 --> 00:51:18,200
Okay.

717
00:51:19,868 --> 00:51:20,952
Excuse me, sir.

718
00:51:23,079 --> 00:51:25,874
-Are you talking to me?
-What will happen to a guy like me?

719
00:51:26,291 --> 00:51:28,168
Will I go straight to prison?

720
00:51:30,212 --> 00:51:32,255
I don't defend people for free.

721
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:40,889
I heard he's been locked up
for more than 48 hours.

722
00:51:40,972 --> 00:51:42,891
Why are you still keeping him there?

723
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:45,310
-Well, it's because--
-You can't do this.

724
00:51:45,393 --> 00:51:47,813
You can't do this to a civilian
without a warrant.

725
00:51:47,896 --> 00:51:49,231
What you're doing is illegal.

726
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:55,445
Why can't you testify?

727
00:51:56,404 --> 00:51:59,407
I only witnessed it
because I skipped a class that day.

728
00:52:00,158 --> 00:52:02,744
If my mom finds out about that
after I testify,

729
00:52:03,662 --> 00:52:04,830
she'll kill me.

730
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:08,583
I'll make sure she never finds out.

731
00:52:08,667 --> 00:52:10,001
My mom knows everything.

732
00:52:12,254 --> 00:52:13,255
I see.

733
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:15,298
Okay.

734
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:18,385
Then I'll just tell her everything.

735
00:52:18,885 --> 00:52:20,887
-What?
-You skipped class that day,

736
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:22,806
and you came out early today
to do the same thing.

737
00:52:22,889 --> 00:52:24,724
I'm going to tell your mom everything

738
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:25,934
if you don't testify.

739
00:52:34,359 --> 00:52:35,360
By the way,

740
00:52:35,443 --> 00:52:37,362
is she okay? She got stabbed with a knife.

741
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:39,531
You saw a knife?

742
00:52:39,614 --> 00:52:40,448
Yes.

743
00:52:41,157 --> 00:52:43,368
Then did you see what he did
with that knife?

744
00:52:43,451 --> 00:52:44,953
Did you see where he threw it away?

745
00:52:45,328 --> 00:52:46,580
Yes, I did.

746
00:52:49,457 --> 00:52:52,043
He put it inside his cast.

747
00:52:57,716 --> 00:52:58,925
Yes, this is Ji Eun-hyeok.

748
00:52:59,384 --> 00:53:00,760
I already found the witness.

749
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:02,095
The weapon is in...

750
00:53:04,222 --> 00:53:05,765
The suspect got released?

751
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,149
I'll walk you home tomorrow too.

752
00:53:14,232 --> 00:53:15,358
How will you go home?

753
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:18,486
You don't need to worry about me.

754
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:19,571
Yeon-wu.

755
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:23,825
-Stay behind me.
-Oh, gosh.

756
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:24,868
Stay there.

757
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:32,959
Bong-hui.

758
00:53:37,255 --> 00:53:39,883
-Hey, are you okay?
-I told you to stay behind me.

759
00:53:43,303 --> 00:53:45,305
JI EUN-HYEOK

760
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:49,643
Hey, what did the witness say?

761
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:50,769
I found

762
00:53:50,852 --> 00:53:52,020
the weapon.

763
00:53:52,854 --> 00:53:53,855
Where?

764
00:53:54,314 --> 00:53:55,941
He hid it inside his cast.

765
00:53:56,024 --> 00:53:58,026
-What?
-But there's a problem.

766
00:53:58,568 --> 00:54:01,738
It's been more than 48 hours,
so he got released.

767
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:04,616
-He's probably--
-You should've told me that first.

768
00:54:04,699 --> 00:54:05,825
Okay, I got it.

769
00:54:06,451 --> 00:54:07,452
Shoot.

770
00:54:18,964 --> 00:54:21,257
Bong-hui.

771
00:54:21,549 --> 00:54:24,469
Bong-hui. I'm her guardian.
Get out of my way.

772
00:54:24,552 --> 00:54:26,805
Bong-hui. Hey, Bong-hui.

773
00:54:27,013 --> 00:54:28,056
Are you...

774
00:54:28,682 --> 00:54:29,683
Mr. Noh.

775
00:54:33,144 --> 00:54:34,270
Are you okay?

776
00:54:34,896 --> 00:54:38,024
I'm okay. It just brushed against my arm.

777
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:44,656
-Hey, you. Get over here.
-Stop, Mr. Noh.

778
00:54:44,739 --> 00:54:46,199
I'm really okay.

779
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:48,576
I'm fine. I'm okay.

780
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:52,539
Are you sure you're okay?

781
00:54:53,623 --> 00:54:54,708
Okay.

782
00:55:05,385 --> 00:55:06,469
I'm relieved.

783
00:55:08,304 --> 00:55:09,597
Hey, wait.

784
00:55:10,765 --> 00:55:12,350
Where's Mr. Bang?

785
00:55:14,894 --> 00:55:15,895
I was on my way there,

786
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:18,023
but I came here as soon as
I got a call from Eun-hyeok.

787
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:21,651
Then you should go to him right now.

788
00:55:24,070 --> 00:55:25,030
Okay.

789
00:55:25,363 --> 00:55:29,492
Eun-hyeok will be here soon, so ask him
for help if anything happens.

790
00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:31,786
-Okay?
-Okay. You should hurry up and go.

791
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:33,747
Please look after her.

792
00:55:34,289 --> 00:55:35,331
I'll go now.

793
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:43,715
Why? What's wrong?

794
00:55:54,059 --> 00:55:55,894
-It's okay.
-Okay.

795
00:55:56,936 --> 00:55:58,021
You should go.

796
00:56:00,231 --> 00:56:01,232
Bye.

797
00:56:03,568 --> 00:56:04,652
Please take good care of her.

798
00:56:41,272 --> 00:56:44,651
The line is busy. Please leave
a message after the beep.

799
00:56:47,654 --> 00:56:48,988
Why isn't he picking up?

800
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:50,031
MR. BANG

801
00:56:50,115 --> 00:56:53,701
The line is busy. Please leave
a message after the beep.

802
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:32,240
Is anyone here?

803
00:57:36,828 --> 00:57:38,079
Mr. Lee Jae-ho?

804
00:57:40,999 --> 00:57:42,125
Mr. Lee Jae-ho?

805
00:58:08,109 --> 00:58:10,528
LAWYER NOH JI-UK

806
00:58:14,073 --> 00:58:16,367
Hello? Mr. Bang?

807
00:58:16,701 --> 00:58:17,827
Hello?

808
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:19,704
Mr. Bang, can you hear me?

809
00:58:31,925 --> 00:58:34,594
I used to an investigator
who was known for being good at fighting.

810
00:58:37,305 --> 00:58:38,765
MR. BANG

811
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:44,187
Hello? Mr. Bang.

812
00:58:45,146 --> 00:58:46,397
Hello? Mr. Bang!

813
00:58:46,731 --> 00:58:47,649
Hello?

814
00:58:48,066 --> 00:58:49,859
What? What's going on?

815
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:51,611
Damn it.

816
01:00:01,931 --> 01:00:02,932
Mr. Bang.

817
01:00:16,863 --> 01:00:17,905
