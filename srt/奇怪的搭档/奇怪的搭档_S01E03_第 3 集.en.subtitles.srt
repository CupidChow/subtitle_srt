1
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:41,082
Sometimes you fall in love
before you know it.

2
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:49,424
Just like the spring breeze
and moist rain drops,

3
00:00:49,507 --> 00:00:52,343
your heart slowly gets soaked with love
before you know it.

4
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:54,095
Love gets into our hearts.

5
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:56,598
At some point, you will come to realize

6
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:59,350
that a certain someone is holding
a special place in your heart.

7
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:04,522
-Is this all true?
-Are you the murderer?

8
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:06,107
Do you admit the charge?

9
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:07,484
How do you feel now?

10
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:09,903
-Please give us a comment.
-Share a word.

11
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:12,030
-What was your motive?
-Please answer our questions.

12
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:19,829
Some say for one to fall in love,
0.2 second is more than enough.

13
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:25,251
The time I needed to fall in love
was only 0.2 second.

14
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:29,130
It was love at first sight.

15
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:34,761
SEONHO DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

16
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,849
This is why I'm going to confess my love.

17
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,559
I'll confess that I love him.

18
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:44,771
I'll tell him he's my only present,

19
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:46,940
my only love, and my destiny.

20
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:48,233
I think that we...

21
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:50,610
met by fate.

22
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:55,031
I also think you're my destiny--

23
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:56,157
An ill-fated encounter.

24
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:02,747
So...

25
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:06,417
let's never cross paths again.

26
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:29,524
Hey, Bong-hui.

27
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,152
I wanted to give you this.

28
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:35,113
What is this?

29
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:36,823
This tea is good for insomnia.

30
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,909
How did you know that I have insomnia?

31
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:43,329
For about two months,
I worked as your underling...

32
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:46,457
I mean your trainee prosecutor.
I was bound to find out.

33
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:49,085
Believe it or not, I know you quite well.

34
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:55,466
I didn't delve into your private life
or pry on you. Don't worry.

35
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:59,429
By the way, considering your condition,
you don't look tired,

36
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:01,723
or have dark circles. Did you know that?

37
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:04,475
At a glance, people might think
you sleep like a baby at night.

38
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:06,895
It makes me realize the importance
of skin once again,

39
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:08,771
and I'm rambling on, aren't I?

40
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:09,898
-Yes.
-I'm sorry.

41
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:12,025
You must be, but go on

42
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:14,402
whether you want to ramble on
or have something to say.

43
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:16,195
This will be the last time anyway.

44
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:19,657
Last time...

45
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:25,330
There are so many things I'm sorry about.

46
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:28,666
I mistook you for a pervert before.

47
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:30,585
Because of me,

48
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:32,712
you were fired from your position.

49
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:34,505
I'm sorry for everything.

50
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:37,425
Okay.

51
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:39,302
And I'd like to thank you too.

52
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:42,597
To me, you are a hero, Prosecutor Noh.

53
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,057
I won't change you for Iron Man.

54
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:47,185
Really?

55
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:48,102
Yes.

56
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:49,520
And...

57
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:53,191
I like you.

58
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:55,902
And?

59
00:03:57,445 --> 00:03:58,696
And... What was it?

60
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:01,199
Oh, right. The real culprit.

61
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:03,451
I think I ran into the real culprit.

62
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:04,702
What?

63
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:06,412
But you don't have to worry about that.

64
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:09,415
From now on, I won't bother
or harm you in any way.

65
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:10,750
I will take care of this on my own.

66
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:14,295
You lost your job because of me.

67
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:15,964
It doesn't matter if I lost my job or not.

68
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:18,466
You should've told me
if you saw the real culprit.

69
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,678
Well... I wasn't completely certain.

70
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:22,971
What do you mean?

71
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:24,055
Well...

72
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:28,601
We sort of met through a song.

73
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:30,061
A song?

74
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:34,440
The sound of the whistle I heard
on the night of Hui-jun's murder.

75
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:36,401
I also heard it in court.

76
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:42,991
I believe that the real culprit
came to my trial.

77
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:45,410
The whistle...

78
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:47,078
What kind of song was it?

79
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:05,805
Gosh.

80
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:10,977
Is this music from the third world?

81
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:14,314
How should I put it? This is quite unique.

82
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:15,690
Repeat it again.

83
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:17,066
Again?

84
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,151
Yes.

85
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,472
Gosh, this is bitter.

86
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,224
Gosh, this isn't good.

87
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,853
This is bitter and not tasty.

88
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,781
Hey, stop it. That's enough.

89
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:06,991
Stop with this odd melody.

90
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:09,243
What does he look like?
How old does he look?

91
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:11,454
-Well...
-Yes?

92
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:16,000
I won't accept your help again.

93
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:19,003
-What?
-You went through a lot for me.

94
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:21,339
I will take care of this on my own.

95
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,299
You don't have to worry about that.

96
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:25,343
I wasn't worried about you.

97
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:27,220
I was just curious.

98
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:31,307
Goodness, Bong-hui,
you don't know anything.

99
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:41,567
Seriously, this is so bitter.

100
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,389
You eat, sleep, and breathe

101
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:38,851
in a place where my son was murdered.
You are alive and well.

102
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:42,104
How dare you be alive?

103
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:49,820
I'm also heartbroken...

104
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:53,574
about what happened to your son.

105
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:56,160
I really mean it.

106
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:58,037
However,

107
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,832
I really didn't do it.

108
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:04,085
I know that you don't believe me,

109
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:06,003
but that doesn't mean...

110
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:09,757
I can admit something I didn't do.

111
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:13,553
I didn't find any evidence
that proves you didn't murder my son.

112
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:15,221
With all due respect,

113
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:18,641
there is no evidence that I did.

114
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:19,934
There is.

115
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:22,687
Only if Noh Ji-uk
didn't mess up the trial,

116
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,439
you would have been in prison
serving time for your crime.

117
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:27,984
That evidence...

118
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:30,778
was fabricated.

119
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:31,862
What?

120
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:34,198
Please forgive me...

121
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:36,033
for saying this.

122
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:37,952
However,

123
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:40,830
the prosecution has to prove my guilt.

124
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:44,375
According to the presumption of innocence,
I'm innocent.

125
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,919
If you believe that I'm guilty,

126
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:49,297
the prosecution ought to prove that.

127
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,592
There is no responsibility on my side...

128
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,719
to prove that I'm innocent,

129
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:56,679
but...

130
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:59,223
I'm going to prove my innocence.

131
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,059
I'll do it for myself,

132
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:04,604
Prosecutor Noh,

133
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,231
and my mom.

134
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:09,900
I will...

135
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:14,071
catch the real culprit for you
and Hui-jun. I'll make sure...

136
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:32,423
I didn't know
how you won my son's heart...

137
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:35,760
with what kind of means or abilities.

138
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:40,056
I was wondering how you put
Noh Ji-uk under your spell

139
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:42,183
to get you out and regain
your freedom so brazenly.

140
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:44,185
I get it now.

141
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:47,480
Now I know that you aren't a typical girl.

142
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,524
-Sir--
-However,

143
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:54,862
you are going to regret
acquiring your freedom again.

144
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:57,698
I'm going to catch you by all means.

145
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:00,493
I'm definitely going to punish you.

146
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,704
As long as you and I are alive,

147
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:06,207
I'm going to make you suffer,

148
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:08,501
and I won't forget to punish you.

149
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:24,975
THE LATE NOH YEONG-SEOK

150
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:27,395
Dad.

151
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:30,314
I resigned.

152
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:36,404
Before I could even solve
the last case as a prosecutor,

153
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:40,324
I quit.

154
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:44,370
What? You want to be like me?

155
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:46,580
Yes, when I grow up,
I'm going to be just like you.

156
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:49,083
My goodness, what an honor.

157
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:53,504
There is no greater honor than a son
wishing to be just like his father.

158
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:55,089
I'm sorry that...

159
00:11:58,717 --> 00:11:59,927
I failed to become like you.

160
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,681
I'm sorry.

161
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:07,685
For not keeping my promise.

162
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,500
LAWYERS NOH JI-UK AND JI EUN-HYEOK

163
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,756
Welcome, Noh Ji-uk!

164
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:48,767
My gosh.

165
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:52,104
Why are you doing this to me?

166
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:56,734
I'm sincerely welcoming you
because I really like you.

167
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:03,699
Get lost.

168
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:06,744
No, wait.

169
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:08,537
What? Tell me anything you need.

170
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,168
I had an ill-fated relationship.

171
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:15,294
You did? With whom?

172
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:17,087
-Just listen.
-Okay, I will.

173
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,173
It's fine as long as I'm not the one.

174
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:21,592
You're the worst one ever.
I already hate you.

175
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:22,801
My gosh.

176
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:25,846
Anyway, I told someone
that we have an ill-fated relationship,

177
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,974
and to never show up in front of me.
But the thing is,

178
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:31,310
I need to ask that person something.

179
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:32,728
So if I contact that person first...

180
00:13:32,811 --> 00:13:34,897
Come on. That'd be humiliating.

181
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,233
-Do you think so?
-Of course.

182
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:38,609
You'll look silly.

183
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:41,529
But it'd be nice.

184
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:45,741
If it were me, I'd like
it. I'd be more touched and excited

185
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:47,660
if someone called me
after saying that they won't.

186
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,996
That's how I felt
when you contacted me first.

187
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:53,958
The less you expect,
the bigger the surprise.

188
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:56,877
Get lost.

189
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:59,880
That's what I'm talking about.
You say that and then call me again.

190
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:02,174
It makes me have butterflies
in my stomach.

191
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:03,259
Hey.

192
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:06,053
Just because I act like nothing happened,

193
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:08,472
don't get delusional
and actually think that way, Eun-hyeok.

194
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:13,185
Okay.

195
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:16,063
-Please disappear.
-But, Ji-uk...

196
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:19,984
This is also my office.

197
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:22,361
This is your desk. That's my desk.

198
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:24,196
Where should I disappear to?

199
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:33,539
I really can't stand this lecture.
It's so boring.

200
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,124
Bong-hui.

201
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:36,750
Do you want to eat with us?

202
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:38,460
-Hey, stop it.
-Hey.

203
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:39,545
You can't ask her.

204
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:44,466
Let's go.

205
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:47,595
Let's go eat.

206
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:51,599
I decided to listen to all the music
in the world

207
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:53,601
until I find the source of that melody.

208
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:58,689
LOOKING FOR A WITNESS
WHO SAW A BIKE HERE ON MAY 11, 2015

209
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:02,026
I even sent a message to the culprit.

210
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:03,986
I let him know that I was looking for him,

211
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,571
so he should come find me too.

212
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:06,906
Hey, culprit.

213
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:11,660
Let's have a head-to-head battle.

214
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:25,674
This is the only place the culprit
left a trace.

215
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:45,069
Where did the culprit go after that?

216
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:04,755
No way.

217
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:12,221
They always return
to the scene of the crime.

218
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:16,976
Bong-hui?

219
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:19,895
Mr. Noh?

220
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:26,318
You scared me. Why didn't you
tell me who you were?

221
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:27,987
You didn't ask me.

222
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:31,156
How could you not reveal yourself
at such a shady place like this?

223
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,158
Then am I supposed to say my name
out loud while I walk

224
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:34,451
when nobody even asked?

225
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:35,619
It's a shady place.

226
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:37,496
Of course I mistook you for the culprit!

227
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:39,581
You're the one who came here
alone at this hour.

228
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,291
I was looking for criminal evidence.

229
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,006
Were you worried about me?

230
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:51,552
No. Of course not.

231
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:54,513
Of course, you weren't.

232
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:24,334
My gosh.

233
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,437
Why did you come here, Mr. Noh?

234
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:46,398
The fact
that a competent prosecutor like me

235
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:48,984
failed to solve his last case...

236
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:50,527
How should I put it?

237
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:54,698
It hurts my pride
and it doesn't sit right with me.

238
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:56,617
I see.

239
00:17:57,451 --> 00:18:00,412
I'll help you restore your pride
by finding the source of that melody.

240
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:03,749
Forget that. I'll give you
the CCTV footage of the court.

241
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:06,043
So check the culprit's face and...

242
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:07,377
I never saw his face.

243
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:12,966
You said you saw him.

244
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,760
I did, but I told you

245
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:16,929
that I met him through a song.

246
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:19,765
He passed me by on a bicycle,
and in court, I only heard the melody--

247
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:20,724
What?

248
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:23,644
Melody my ass!

249
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:26,438
Why are you getting angry?

250
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:29,942
Okay, fine.
What did the bicycle look like?

251
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:32,111
What kind of bicycle was it?
What does it look like?

252
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:34,988
All bicycles look alike.
They have two wheels.

253
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:36,698
I didn't know that there was a difference.

254
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:58,345
My goodness, I had no idea.

255
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:01,515
I thought you had a clue or something.

256
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:03,725
I was so curious to know what that was.

257
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:07,729
Because of that, my insomnia
got worse, and I couldn't work.

258
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,731
I came here despite looking silly!

259
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,318
My gosh, Bong-hui.

260
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:17,322
That's why I said
I'll solve this on my own.

261
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:20,576
How are you going to solve it?
Tell me how!

262
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,161
Coming here at this hour?

263
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:24,830
You're making me think that
you're worried about me.

264
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:31,003
You're right.

265
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:33,881
Does that mean you're not mad
at me anymore?

266
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:38,719
You told me to get lost and said
we have an ill-fated relationship.

267
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:40,637
So I thought I'd never get to
see you again.

268
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:41,722
That's true too.

269
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:43,432
Sorry?

270
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:48,729
As your former mentor and guardian
for two months,

271
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:51,732
I did worry about you quite a lot. But...

272
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:54,234
it ends here.

273
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:56,320
Not anymore.

274
00:19:57,779 --> 00:19:59,907
So please stay out of trouble.

275
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,285
And live safely.

276
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:16,798
I'm really going to find a clue.
I'm going to find the culprit.

277
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:19,801
I might visit you after that.
That's okay, right?

278
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:24,473
I'm going to become successful,
and I'm going to repay you.

279
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:28,769
I'm going to change our relationship...

280
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:32,814
from an ill-fated one to a good one.

281
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:04,513
JURISTIC ACT

282
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:10,435
I lived a diligent life.

283
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:35,460
And sometimes, when I had a tough time...

284
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:38,547
I'm so happy.

285
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:41,717
Congratulations! I'm so jealous.

286
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,177
Why are you jealous?
I'm not the only one who got appointed.

287
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:46,346
You've all landed a job at law firms, too.

288
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:47,889
All of us did pretty well.

289
00:21:48,598 --> 00:21:49,808
Except for someone.

290
00:21:54,354 --> 00:21:57,232
From time to time when I felt like
life was suffocating me,

291
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:05,782
I took a little break...

292
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:08,785
by peeking at you.

293
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:20,422
Okay.

294
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:23,717
That way. Yes, good.
Pull it a bit more towards you.

295
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,760
Okay!

296
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:26,470
Let's secure it now.
Go ahead and secure it.

297
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:30,640
Okay. I think it's good.

298
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:33,060
Thank you for your help.
I got it done easily thanks to you.

299
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:36,730
Are you the witness by any chance?

300
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:38,106
Are you going to report yourself?

301
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:42,944
Thanks anyway.

302
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:50,285
PLEASE CALL THIS NUMBER

303
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:52,496
ADD TO CONTACTS

304
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:58,085
LOOKING FOR A WITNESS
WHO SAW A BIKE HERE ON MAY 11, 2015

305
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:02,589
Goodness, this is...

306
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:04,174
Well...

307
00:23:05,258 --> 00:23:07,135
Even if the injured party won't settle,

308
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:10,222
you can't threaten him like that.

309
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:12,557
A sincere apology and self-reflection
should come first.

310
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:14,267
Of course, he won't accept your apology,
but--

311
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:16,978
We are also victims here, Mr. Noh.

312
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:19,481
Why are they
turning it into such a big deal?

313
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:21,399
Boys will be boys, punching each other!

314
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:23,235
Why are they treating him
like a brutal criminal?

315
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:25,529
That's an understatement. Look at this.

316
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:27,447
He's been instigating the bullying.

317
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:29,825
He's in for confinement
and group assault as well.

318
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:31,827
The victim was released
from the ICU only recently.

319
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,995
That bastard deserved to get beaten up.

320
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,205
Be quiet.

321
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:37,082
He's saying that guy deserved it.

322
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:38,500
He should've behaved himself.

323
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:40,710
Everyone has a breaking point!

324
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:41,837
Aren't I right?

325
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,630
We're not asking him to settle for free.

326
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:45,298
I offered more than the hospital bills

327
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:47,467
but he said it wasn't enough.
They obviously want more.

328
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:48,844
I get that they're poor,

329
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:52,139
but how can they try to make money
off of their injured son?

330
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:55,225
Anyway, my son's future is in your hands.

331
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:57,519
Please make sure he gets suspension
of prosecution or sentence.

332
00:23:57,644 --> 00:24:00,856
Okay, let's say we get out of this.
But what about the next time?

333
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:03,650
After his upcoming birthday, he'll
no longer be considered a minor.

334
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:04,943
What do you mean...

335
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:07,445
I'm a lot more experienced than I seem.

336
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:08,822
I passed the exam very young.

337
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:12,909
I mean, I passed the bar exam
before I even graduated.

338
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:14,035
What a show-off.

339
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,829
Yes, I'm showing off.

340
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:18,748
Because I have a lot of experience
as a prosecutor, I've seen jerks...

341
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:21,126
I mean, I've seen many boys like you.

342
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:23,420
Hey, isn't this your third case?

343
00:24:23,503 --> 00:24:26,756
I see here that you almost raped
a girl and threatened her...

344
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,884
-almost bribing her.
-That girl was a gold digger.

345
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:31,136
Right, of course. I'm sure
he's never done anything wrong.

346
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:33,054
-It must be everyone else's fault.
-Goodness.

347
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:36,725
You've been, and will be backing him up
with your money and connections.

348
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:40,187
So he never learned his lessons.

349
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:42,063
Nor he will ever learn.

350
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:45,400
He'll continue to commit bad deeds
because he doesn't know right from wrong!

351
00:24:45,483 --> 00:24:47,277
If he gets in huge trouble
that you can't fix

352
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,030
you'll send him to a school abroad.
Then he'll get into drugs...

353
00:24:50,113 --> 00:24:52,574
and won't even be able to graduate.
Then he'll return to Korea

354
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:56,203
and exercise violence against those
who are poorer and weaker than him.

355
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:58,288
Then he'll pay his way out of it. Well!

356
00:24:58,371 --> 00:25:00,707
Everything will be okay.
Your mom will take care of everything.

357
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:03,001
Ma'am, you'll have to live longer
than your son does

358
00:25:03,084 --> 00:25:04,961
because you'll have to fix his mess
all your life.

359
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:06,379
For goodness' sake!

360
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:10,217
Money take cares of everything.
What an amazing world we live in.

361
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:20,602
Well, you know.

362
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:22,854
I'm just saying.

363
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:24,898
That's how the world is.

364
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:29,319
Shall we...

365
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:31,529
start over from the beginning...

366
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:33,823
with a refreshed mindset?

367
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:36,868
Let's start from a sincere apology
and self-reflection.

368
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:38,370
Lawyer Noh!

369
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:41,331
You're no longer a prosecutor.
You're a lawyer now.

370
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:45,293
It's already been two years since
you gave up your prosecutor badge.

371
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:48,046
Why are you still
acting like a prosecutor?

372
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:52,384
Who are you to demand
self-reflection from your client?

373
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:57,430
Look at you. "I'm not listening."

374
00:25:57,514 --> 00:25:59,891
"You can talk all you want."
Is that what you're thinking now?

375
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:04,646
No, that's not really what I'm thinking.

376
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:06,564
You should reflect on yourself.

377
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:08,942
Don't just demand it from your client.

378
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:10,485
You do it first.

379
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:13,446
My life motto is, "No regrets."

380
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:15,615
But I'm starting to regret...

381
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:16,992
bringing you here.

382
00:26:17,575 --> 00:26:18,660
Good grief.

383
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:38,096
PROSECUTOR NOH JI-UK

384
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:45,979
PROSECUTOR NOH JI-UK

385
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:47,564
PROSECUTOR WOO MYEONG-SIK

386
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:02,454
Let's go for food.

387
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:05,165
I'm busy.

388
00:27:08,626 --> 00:27:10,545
Let's eat. Come on.

389
00:27:10,628 --> 00:27:11,671
I'M BUSY

390
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:34,861
I think the food at Goyang District Court
is the best.

391
00:27:34,944 --> 00:27:37,739
Then you should eat there.
Why do you come here every day?

392
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:39,407
I can't go all the way to Ilsan--

393
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:41,743
You have a lot of time
because you don't have much work.

394
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:43,036
Aren't I right, Prosecutor Noh?

395
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:44,329
I mean, Lawyer Noh.

396
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:48,833
I heard you had a team dinner
two days ago.

397
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:52,420
Guys,

398
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:57,425
have you watched the movie,
The Devil's Advocate?

399
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,387
In that movie...

400
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:03,598
a lawyer...

401
00:28:03,681 --> 00:28:06,267
sells his soul to a devil.

402
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:09,521
You see, it shows
that some of us are even willing...

403
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:13,066
to defend a devil for wealth and fame.

404
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:18,613
How should I put this?
I think that movie...

405
00:28:19,322 --> 00:28:21,908
captured the nature of lawyers
very precisely.

406
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:27,914
Anyway, I hate lawyers so much.

407
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:36,923
Even devils have the right to be defended.

408
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:40,009
All of us here, including me, are lawyers.

409
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:44,139
Mr. Noh. We rarely get to have
everyone gathered like this...

410
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:46,182
for a company dinner.

411
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:50,395
Ji-uk made the rare company dinner
even more special.

412
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:54,107
Hey, you're really...

413
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:55,942
Don't be ridiculous.

414
00:28:56,025 --> 00:28:58,069
Let go, you punk.

415
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,530
Why are there so many lawyers
in this world?

416
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:03,199
You used to criticize prosecutors so much
when you were a prosecutor.

417
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:05,660
Now that you're a lawyer,
you badmouth them all the time.

418
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:08,997
I bet there are many ridiculous stories
you can share with me.

419
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,707
Prosecutor Noh. I mean, Lawyer Noh.

420
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:13,334
Isn't this a bit too salty? I prefer foods
that are low in sodium.

421
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:16,171
Chameleons, lizards, and octopus.

422
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:17,964
Even those creatures change colors

423
00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:20,300
and blend in with their surroundings
to survive.

424
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:23,094
You should at least be on par with them
if you can't surpass them.

425
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:24,262
For goodness' sake!

426
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:26,848
I'm really not cut out for it!

427
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:30,518
I like convicting criminals. I hate
having to defend people so much.

428
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:32,353
Gosh, I absolutely hate it.

429
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:39,402
When I was about five or six years old,

430
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:43,156
I realized, I have to do things
I don't want to do at times in life.

431
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:44,491
That's when I learned it.

432
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:49,579
Goodness. Don't worry so much, Mr. Bang.

433
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:52,040
You get hammered down when you're prickly.

434
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:53,583
I'm trying to toughen him up.

435
00:29:53,666 --> 00:29:54,667
Right?

436
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:59,464
But he'll never become rounded
no matter how much he gets beaten.

437
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:00,757
His consistency is so charming.

438
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,300
I am very consistent.

439
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:03,927
I despise you consistently.

440
00:30:06,012 --> 00:30:07,055
Where are you going?

441
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:11,726
Isn't he so consistently mean?

442
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:12,977
Which one of you?

443
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:15,146
Gosh, you just hurt my feelings.

444
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:21,361
He's doing that a lot these days.

445
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:24,823
He's just lonely
from being an outcast for a long time.

446
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:28,117
He talks to the walls
because he has no one to talk to.

447
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:56,771
I never even run into the one
I miss so much,

448
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:59,107
but I keep bumping into my enemy
in this hallway.

449
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,608
What are you talking about?

450
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:03,695
You don't even get to come here often
because you have no clients.

451
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:06,781
I'm saying I see you whenever I'm here.
You have bad comprehension.

452
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:08,575
You're so...

453
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:10,410
You look so bad.

454
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:13,580
I get that you're broke,
but still, try to be presentable.

455
00:31:13,663 --> 00:31:14,956
You have horrible sense of fashion.

456
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,624
My clothes are cheap, but so what?

457
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:19,919
My soul and body are so classy.
They can make up for everything.

458
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:23,631
Your heels are about to turn into flats.

459
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:26,509
I saw your heel dangling
when you were walking.

460
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:30,972
It's fixed.

461
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:32,098
Are we good now?

462
00:31:33,182 --> 00:31:35,435
We sure are.

463
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:40,565
The CCTV footage from the scene
the prosecution submitted as evidence

464
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:43,776
can't be used to confirm
the identity of the defendant

465
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,153
due to its low resolution.

466
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:48,448
Also, seeing that no crucial evidence
such as

467
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:51,784
fingerprints or footprints
were found at the crime scene...

468
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:05,256
The defendant is guilty.

469
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,343
He is guilty, Your Honor.

470
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:12,138
You're saying that he's guilty?

471
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:16,434
Did I say that? You must be mistaken.

472
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:18,978
The defendant is not guilty.
He's innocent.

473
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:26,069
Next.

474
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:29,405
Case number 2017-G-66390.

475
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:38,915
How embarrassing.

476
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:43,419
The defendant admits to his mistake.

477
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:46,047
He has sincere regrets for what he did.

478
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:50,635
He also did his best to settle
with the victim,

479
00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:52,971
and they succeeded in reaching
an agreement.

480
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:55,890
He has a family to take care of

481
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:59,894
and has no criminal records
of the same... Okay.

482
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:01,729
I'm sorry.

483
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:02,939
He has no...

484
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:07,360
He has no previous criminal record
of the same offense.

485
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:10,780
Please take that into account, Your Honor.

486
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:44,063
Mr. Ji?

487
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:45,898
It's been so long.

488
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:47,984
How are you, Ms. Eun?

489
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:51,029
Thanks to you, I'm still alive.

490
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:53,239
How have you been doing?

491
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:55,408
I'm also still alive, thanks to you.

492
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,203
You must've been peeking at Ji-uk.

493
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:01,330
Peeking?

494
00:34:01,664 --> 00:34:03,249
-I was just looking.
-Hey.

495
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:04,333
Ji-uk's coming out now.

496
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:12,383
I'll be right back.

497
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:16,888
Hi, Ji-uk.

498
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:20,892
Gosh, you can at least say hello.

499
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:21,893
No.

500
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:23,144
I love you nonetheless.

501
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:24,520
I love you,

502
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:25,938
Ji-uk.

503
00:34:31,694 --> 00:34:32,779
How pretty.

504
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:37,366
SHOE REPAIR

505
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:48,169
Hello, I'm Lawyer Eun Bong-hui
always available wherever you are.

506
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:52,131
Yes.

507
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:53,633
In 30 minutes?

508
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:55,009
Okay.

509
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:58,846
Okay. I'll see you in 30 minutes.

510
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,391
Sir, can I have my shoes back?

511
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:04,352
I just started repairing them.
I was loaded with work.

512
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:06,270
Here.

513
00:35:06,979 --> 00:35:08,231
My goodness.

514
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:10,066
What should I do?

515
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:11,984
Should I wear these? No, I can't do that.

516
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:16,489
Okay.

517
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:26,541
Hey, Ji-hae.

518
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,459
Hey, Prosecutor Na.

519
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:30,044
Where did she suddenly come from?

520
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:31,462
Don't come near me.

521
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:33,214
What are you doing?

522
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:35,925
How pretty. Your size must be 240mm.

523
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:37,009
So?

524
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:40,596
-What?
-Here. Wear these. There you go.

525
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:43,349
Just think of this as a small payment...

526
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:45,226
for always being...

527
00:35:45,351 --> 00:35:47,186
so mean to me.

528
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:48,354
My shoes are over there.

529
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:50,439
Sir, give her the repaired shoes.

530
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:52,608
-Who's going to pay?
-She'll pay.

531
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:53,693
Hey, you crazy wench!

532
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:57,113
I hope this client is a normal person.

533
00:35:57,196 --> 00:36:00,908
I really hope so.
Please be a normal person.

534
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:04,245
Up until now, 90 percent of all my clients

535
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:05,496
were not normal.

536
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:09,417
I want to...

537
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:12,295
kill my husband.

538
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:14,130
But I don't know how.

539
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:17,049
I heard that you succeeded in...

540
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:19,677
killing your boyfriend.

541
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:27,977
There's so much evidence against you
of committing murder.

542
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:30,521
-How can I prove your innocence?
-I know you have your ways.

543
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:32,315
You know how to get away with murder.

544
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:40,573
I'm not a professional killer.

545
00:36:40,656 --> 00:36:42,283
I met these kinds of people.

546
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:46,412
My gosh.

547
00:36:47,955 --> 00:36:48,998
My goodness.

548
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:53,169
Let's put these away.

549
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:01,385
It's good, right?

550
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:06,557
So please let this one be a normal client.

551
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:16,150
EUN BONG-HUI LAW FIRM

552
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:24,283
Yes, come in.

553
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:37,421
I am...

554
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:40,549
a so-called stalker.

555
00:37:42,134 --> 00:37:43,970
There was a woman I loved.

556
00:37:45,012 --> 00:37:46,639
We both liked each other very much.

557
00:37:47,723 --> 00:37:50,685
The story he told me from then on...

558
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:53,104
was very similar to mine.

559
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:58,651
Just like how I did,

560
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:01,570
he also fell in love at first sight.

561
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:09,745
Let's talk, Na-eun.

562
00:38:10,162 --> 00:38:11,497
Don't ever show up again.

563
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:14,625
-Na-eun.
-Just like me...

564
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:18,004
-he also had to disappear.
-Hey!

565
00:38:28,514 --> 00:38:30,016
But again, just like me,

566
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:33,394
he kept wandering around her,
and in the end...

567
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:35,479
I received a restraining order.

568
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:41,068
After that, I hadn't seen her
for a year and a half.

569
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:43,112
Then suddenly, two days ago...

570
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:55,583
It was really a coincidence.

571
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:59,837
We both pretended like we were strangers,
but it was so awkward.

572
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:03,382
So I thought it'd be okay to say hello.

573
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:09,013
Na-eun.

574
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:17,980
No.

575
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:19,315
It can't be a coincidence.

576
00:39:20,983 --> 00:39:22,068
I'm sure...

577
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:24,737
it wasn't.

578
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:28,491
I admit that running into him
could be a coincidence.

579
00:39:28,574 --> 00:39:31,494
I made sure that he didn't know
my place nor contact number.

580
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:35,373
But the fact that he got on the bus
cannot be a coincidental happening.

581
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:36,832
I'm sure of it.

582
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:38,876
I'm sure he was trying to stalk me...

583
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:43,339
in order to find out where I live...
and where I work.

584
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:55,351
COURT IN SESSION

585
00:39:56,268 --> 00:39:59,397
Case number 2017-GD-22520.

586
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:01,941
Plaintiff, Jeon Seong-ho.

587
00:40:02,316 --> 00:40:04,360
Defendant, Lee Na-eun.

588
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:33,180
PLAINTIFF, DEFENDANT

589
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:45,985
According to the medical report
that I've submitted,

590
00:40:46,068 --> 00:40:50,322
Mr. Jeon injured his wrist that requires
eight weeks of medical treatment.

591
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:54,076
He also injured his ankle
which requires four weeks of treatment.

592
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:57,413
He asks for a compensation
regarding his medical fees,

593
00:40:57,496 --> 00:40:59,331
loss of earnings, and
psychological damage.

594
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:02,418
The plaintiff had received
a restraining order.

595
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:05,838
This happened while he was in violation
of the given orders.

596
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:09,091
It means the plaintiff
was the cause of his own damage.

597
00:41:09,216 --> 00:41:11,469
The defendant doesn't accept
the responsibility

598
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:12,970
for the plaintiff's injury.

599
00:41:13,387 --> 00:41:16,182
Ergo, I ask that you dismiss
the monetary demand of the plaintiff.

600
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:17,766
After the restraining order was issued,

601
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:20,102
the plaintiff didn't stalk
the defendant even for a moment.

602
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:23,230
Their encounter on the bus
was pure coincidence.

603
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:25,733
There is no evidence
that it was a coincidental encounter.

604
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:30,571
Even if it was, isn't that
in violation of the restraining order?

605
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:32,573
Even if that's true,
it doesn't change the fact

606
00:41:32,698 --> 00:41:34,783
that the defendant physically
harmed the plaintiff.

607
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:37,286
The defendant still doesn't have
the right to harm the plaintiff.

608
00:41:37,369 --> 00:41:39,538
The defendant was
psychologically traumatized

609
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:41,415
due to the constant stalking.

610
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:44,168
Your Honor, pushing the plaintiff

611
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:46,837
can be seen as a self-defense mechanism.

612
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:49,965
Your Honor, when the plaintiff
stalked the defendant,

613
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:53,260
there wasn't a single incident
the plaintiff caused any physical harm.

614
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:55,429
Physical harm isn't
the only type of abuse.

615
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:59,600
Stalking itself means psychological
and emotional stress and abuse.

616
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:01,644
The plaintiff only...

617
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:05,689
observed the defendant from afar.
Don't you think it's too much...

618
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:07,233
to condemn it as an assault?

619
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:10,277
Why is he looking at me?

620
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:13,239
Unwanted attention is also
a form of abuse.

621
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:16,450
When someone whom I don't like
observes and tails me from afar,

622
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:19,620
the feelings of fright, anxiety,

623
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:21,664
and unpleasantness can't be understood...

624
00:42:23,457 --> 00:42:25,709
by someone who hasn't had the experience.

625
00:42:26,752 --> 00:42:29,463
Is this meant for me?

626
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:33,467
Due to the stalking, the defendant
was forced to move constantly.

627
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:36,303
The defendant also had to cut off ties
with most of her acquaintances.

628
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:40,391
She even had to give up her job
which she loved the most.

629
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:43,394
Bingo. This is about me.

630
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:45,062
Everything was...

631
00:42:46,021 --> 00:42:49,441
her desperate attempt to escape
from the plaintiff.

632
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:58,492
As I have mentioned before,
it was a coincidence...

633
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:04,873
I knew it.

634
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:09,962
You knew that I was stalking you,
didn't you?

635
00:43:11,338 --> 00:43:12,923
Everything you say...

636
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:15,593
is aimed at me under the pretext
of a trial, isn't it?

637
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:21,640
Plaintiff's counsel.

638
00:43:23,517 --> 00:43:26,437
I was asking you
if it would be possible...

639
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,314
for you to settle this incident.

640
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:34,653
It was the defendant
who refused to settle.

641
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:38,365
The plaintiff, Jeon Seong-ho,
is willing to dismiss both criminal...

642
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:42,036
and civil cases if the defendant
makes a sincere apology.

643
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:46,248
The defendant has no intention
to face and apologize to the plaintiff.

644
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:47,916
With this opportunity--

645
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,502
You do not have to worry about that.

646
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:53,881
The plaintiff is currently preparing
to emigrate to another country.

647
00:43:54,923 --> 00:43:58,552
If needed, I will submit documents
regarding this matter.

648
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:19,073
Good work.

649
00:44:22,868 --> 00:44:26,830
Okay. Well, I will contact you
after I talk to my client.

650
00:44:27,706 --> 00:44:28,957
All right. I'll get going.

651
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,696
The door is closing.

652
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:04,451
By the way, Prosecutor...

653
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:09,790
Hasn't it been so long
since we last met, Mr. Noh?

654
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:11,583
It hasn't been that long.

655
00:45:12,167 --> 00:45:16,046
I saw you in court when you argued
that the defendant was guilty.

656
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:18,549
Right. You saw that.

657
00:45:21,718 --> 00:45:23,178
By the way, why are you being so formal?

658
00:45:23,595 --> 00:45:27,766
You used to call me by my name
and treat me casually.

659
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:30,436
You were my person back then.

660
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:36,567
That only lasted two months,
and I haven't seen you for two years.

661
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:40,863
It'd be weirder if I treated you casually
due to those two months.

662
00:45:41,947 --> 00:45:43,949
It's not weird. It feels distant.

663
00:45:44,032 --> 00:45:46,785
Of course, you should feel distant.
We are meant to be distant.

664
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:50,831
Oh, I see.

665
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:51,957
The door is opening.

666
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:53,041
Bye.

667
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:00,716
That way.

668
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:12,644
Let me say this again.
After the settlement agreement,

669
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:14,855
you can't ever ask Ms. Lee's contact

670
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:16,815
or approach her. Do you understand that?

671
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:19,610
Even after this settlement,
the restraining order and injunction

672
00:46:19,693 --> 00:46:20,861
are still valid.

673
00:46:20,986 --> 00:46:24,865
Don't worry, I won't do anything
that Na-eun doesn't like.

674
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:26,533
But you stalked her.

675
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:36,001
I just know how she feels
when I look at her.

676
00:46:36,668 --> 00:46:39,796
Her outfit, hair,
and the look on her face.

677
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:43,800
From the first day we met, I knew
everything by looking at those.

678
00:46:45,177 --> 00:46:46,762
So you don't need to worry.

679
00:46:47,763 --> 00:46:48,805
Okay.

680
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:09,117
With this, it is settled
that the plaintiff will drop the lawsuit,

681
00:47:09,201 --> 00:47:11,870
and the defendant will not press
charges or file a lawsuit

682
00:47:11,954 --> 00:47:14,122
for the violation
of the restraining order.

683
00:47:14,206 --> 00:47:15,958
Do both of you agree?

684
00:47:18,126 --> 00:47:19,169
Yes.

685
00:47:29,096 --> 00:47:30,806
Hey, I will call you later.

686
00:47:40,482 --> 00:47:42,568
Are you going to be okay on your own?

687
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:44,820
I will be. Thank you, Mr. Noh.

688
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:46,863
I'm sorry to leave first.

689
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:48,532
Don't be. Please go.

690
00:47:48,615 --> 00:47:49,783
Thank you for your work.

691
00:47:51,326 --> 00:47:52,327
Sure.

692
00:47:58,166 --> 00:47:59,209
Bye.

693
00:48:12,598 --> 00:48:13,974
He didn't even say goodbye.

694
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:17,894
Make a U-turn right now.

695
00:48:24,651 --> 00:48:25,902
Sir, please hurry.

696
00:48:42,878 --> 00:48:43,962
Thank you for your work.

697
00:48:45,297 --> 00:48:46,757
How could he smile?

698
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,219
It was the last time
he would see a girl he loves.

699
00:48:52,095 --> 00:48:55,599
Even if it ended on good terms,
how could he smile?

700
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:57,643
Can that be possible?

701
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:06,193
The melody.

702
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:11,573
LAWYER EUN BONG-HUI

703
00:49:15,702 --> 00:49:17,996
The number you have dialed
is not available at this moment.

704
00:49:19,081 --> 00:49:20,123
Please.

705
00:49:31,343 --> 00:49:33,053
If you tell me the address,
I can go by myself--

706
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:34,137
How can I...

707
00:49:35,055 --> 00:49:36,765
I don't trust the plaintiff's counsel.

708
00:49:37,182 --> 00:49:38,517
Okay, then. Excuse me.

709
00:50:11,258 --> 00:50:13,301
It's just a bad feeling I have.

710
00:50:13,385 --> 00:50:14,761
It's highly likely to be nothing.

711
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:16,304
What is your bad feeling based on?

712
00:50:16,388 --> 00:50:18,098
The look on Mr. Jeon's face.

713
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:22,269
It wasn't a look someone would have
after letting his loved one go.

714
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:24,730
Also, small coincidences?

715
00:50:24,813 --> 00:50:26,440
-Coincidences?
-For instance,

716
00:50:26,523 --> 00:50:27,649
the melody before.

717
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:29,568
You are still obsessed with the melody.

718
00:50:29,651 --> 00:50:32,112
It's not that.
I'm talking about the ringtone.

719
00:50:32,237 --> 00:50:33,780
It's still fresh in my mind.

720
00:50:34,614 --> 00:50:37,868
The song that played
on the very first day I met Na-eun.

721
00:50:38,326 --> 00:50:40,120
In my opinion, perhaps,

722
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:42,748
Mr. Jeon Seong-ho might be mistaken...

723
00:50:42,831 --> 00:50:45,417
that Ms. Lee Na-eun wore
the same outfit for him...

724
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:47,252
and chose the ringtone.

725
00:50:47,335 --> 00:50:49,880
He might be thinking that
these are her signals for him.

726
00:50:49,963 --> 00:50:51,923
I think he might be deluded.

727
00:50:53,175 --> 00:50:54,843
I hope you are right.

728
00:51:10,066 --> 00:51:11,109
JUNGNAM APARTMENT BUILDING A

729
00:52:17,926 --> 00:52:20,011
I'll go in first. What's the address?

730
00:52:21,263 --> 00:52:22,556
Unit 308 in Building A.

731
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:23,890
Okay.

732
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:30,313
Hey, Bong-hui.

733
00:52:30,772 --> 00:52:34,234
Do not get involved
even if anything happens. Got it?

734
00:52:34,359 --> 00:52:35,360
Okay.

735
00:52:36,444 --> 00:52:37,612
You just talked casually to me.

736
00:52:40,365 --> 00:52:42,242
Hey!

737
00:52:58,884 --> 00:52:59,885
Na-eun.

738
00:53:12,314 --> 00:53:14,316
I looked everywhere for you.

739
00:53:14,649 --> 00:53:16,109
I missed you, Na-eun.

740
00:53:24,242 --> 00:53:26,453
Na-eun, I know everything.

741
00:53:26,536 --> 00:53:27,537
Come on out.

742
00:53:27,996 --> 00:53:30,123
Na-eun, let's talk. Come out.

743
00:53:30,498 --> 00:53:32,042
Open the door.

744
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:33,627
Na-eun.

745
00:53:34,127 --> 00:53:36,296
Na-eun!

746
00:53:36,421 --> 00:53:37,547
Lee Na-eun!

747
00:53:39,257 --> 00:53:40,300
Na-eun.

748
00:53:41,259 --> 00:53:42,886
Na-eun, open the door.

749
00:53:43,219 --> 00:53:45,096
Come out, so that we can talk. Na-eun!

750
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:46,932
Na-eun!

751
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:48,600
Mr. Jeon!

752
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:51,770
What do you think you're doing?
Are you out of your mind?

753
00:53:51,853 --> 00:53:52,854
You're...

754
00:53:53,355 --> 00:53:54,439
Don't come closer.

755
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:56,650
Don't interfere, please.

756
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:00,028
Please don't get in my way!

757
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:03,198
Hey, Bong-hui.

758
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:05,033
Hold on.

759
00:54:05,116 --> 00:54:06,284
Don't come closer.

760
00:54:06,368 --> 00:54:07,494
Don't come.

761
00:54:07,577 --> 00:54:08,954
I said, don't come closer!

762
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:29,766
A lawyer...

763
00:54:31,017 --> 00:54:32,644
shouldn't beat up her client.

764
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:36,398
There he is.

765
00:54:36,523 --> 00:54:38,274
-Is he the stalker?
-I guess so.

766
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:40,652
Please step back.
Move out of the way, please.

767
00:54:40,735 --> 00:54:42,028
He looks completely normal.

768
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:43,071
Go on.

769
00:54:58,003 --> 00:54:59,045
Hey.

770
00:55:01,047 --> 00:55:02,632
Did everything get sorted out
on the scene?

771
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:04,467
Yes, almost.

772
00:55:04,551 --> 00:55:06,386
How's Ms. Lee? Is she okay?

773
00:55:06,511 --> 00:55:07,512
She's okay.

774
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:10,015
She's actually relieved
that things turned out like this.

775
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:13,601
I'm glad to hear that.

776
00:55:15,812 --> 00:55:16,813
Here.

777
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:19,733
Thank you.

778
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:23,111
I...

779
00:55:24,112 --> 00:55:25,530
I never thought about the possibility.

780
00:55:26,281 --> 00:55:27,282
Mr. Jeon...

781
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:31,244
I mean, that scum. I can't believe
he's a complete psycho.

782
00:55:32,954 --> 00:55:34,664
I thought he looked normal.

783
00:55:37,751 --> 00:55:39,753
Don't beat yourself up too much.

784
00:55:40,086 --> 00:55:41,129
You see,

785
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:44,549
those scums usually look
completely normal.

786
00:55:44,966 --> 00:55:46,634
Still, I can't help beating myself up.

787
00:55:46,718 --> 00:55:49,554
We could prevent a big mishap
thanks to you.

788
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:53,099
Thanks for saying that.

789
00:55:54,059 --> 00:55:55,185
It's true.

790
00:55:57,729 --> 00:55:59,064
Let's get up.

791
00:55:59,147 --> 00:56:00,523
You need to give a witness statement.

792
00:56:01,232 --> 00:56:02,233
Right.

793
00:56:04,486 --> 00:56:07,155
By the way, do you realize
that you keep talking casually to me?

794
00:56:07,238 --> 00:56:08,239
No.

795
00:56:10,492 --> 00:56:12,452
Because you grabbed the bat,

796
00:56:12,577 --> 00:56:14,579
-Ms. Lee...
-I told you I never hit her.

797
00:56:14,662 --> 00:56:16,289
Why would I hit the woman I love?

798
00:56:16,372 --> 00:56:17,665
You kept banging on her door--

799
00:56:17,749 --> 00:56:19,667
I'm telling you I never did such things.

800
00:56:20,126 --> 00:56:22,462
-Why did you pick up the bat...
-Did you see it? Did you?

801
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:26,299
That's the statement we got.
Don't you raise your voice at me.

802
00:56:26,382 --> 00:56:30,303
Not being loved back by the one
you love is like torture.

803
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:32,305
But in a way,

804
00:56:33,098 --> 00:56:36,059
being loved by someone
you don't want to be with...

805
00:56:36,476 --> 00:56:38,311
and being forced to love
that person back...

806
00:56:38,394 --> 00:56:40,438
could be a bigger torture.

807
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:43,650
What is the scope of love?

808
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:46,736
Where does it end,
and where does obsession begin?

809
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:51,366
And I...

810
00:56:52,158 --> 00:56:54,285
-Why is the office in this area?
-At this moment,

811
00:56:54,369 --> 00:56:55,745
between love and obsession,

812
00:56:56,162 --> 00:56:57,789
where am I standing?

813
00:56:58,331 --> 00:57:00,250
Physical harm isn't
the only type of abuse.

814
00:57:00,625 --> 00:57:04,546
Stalking itself means psychological
and emotional stress and abuse.

815
00:57:06,297 --> 00:57:07,715
Unwanted attention...

816
00:57:08,133 --> 00:57:09,175
is also a form of abuse.

817
00:57:09,843 --> 00:57:10,885
I would...

818
00:57:11,302 --> 00:57:13,847
like to give myself a restraining order.

819
00:57:14,472 --> 00:57:16,057
Arrived at the destination.

820
00:57:16,141 --> 00:57:17,725
Ending voice navigation.

821
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:20,645
This is the address according
to the navigation. Is this it?

822
00:57:20,728 --> 00:57:21,771
Sorry? Oh...

823
00:57:22,856 --> 00:57:24,524
Yes, this is it.

824
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:26,234
Thank you for the ride.

825
00:57:45,503 --> 00:57:47,088
I just don't want you to worry.

826
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:51,968
Other than for work-related things
or bumping into you unexpectedly,

827
00:57:52,051 --> 00:57:55,430
I'll stay at least 100m away
from you at all times.

828
00:57:58,433 --> 00:58:00,768
What exactly do you mean by that?

829
00:58:01,269 --> 00:58:03,062
I literally meant what I said. And...

830
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:04,147
And?

831
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:07,025
Don't get the wrong idea.

832
00:58:07,942 --> 00:58:09,486
I don't like you.

833
00:58:09,903 --> 00:58:14,240
I may have looked like I do
since I feel grateful and indebted to you,

834
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:15,742
but don't worry or get the wrong idea.

835
00:58:15,825 --> 00:58:17,535
I have no feelings for you whatsoever.

836
00:58:17,619 --> 00:58:19,412
Really. I'm serious. Please believe me.

837
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:20,747
Drive safely.

838
00:58:21,372 --> 00:58:22,373
Hey.

839
00:59:03,498 --> 00:59:05,542
I couldn't even date him.

840
00:59:06,251 --> 00:59:08,211
How many times do I have to get dumped?

841
00:59:57,176 --> 01:00:01,389
"If you keep looking for me,
I'll find you first"?

842
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:09,897
PLEASE CALL THIS NUMBER

843
01:00:13,735 --> 01:00:15,445
If you keep looking for me,

844
01:00:15,862 --> 01:00:17,530
I'll find you first.

845
01:00:37,508 --> 01:00:38,801
Someone was in my office.

846
01:00:38,885 --> 01:00:39,802
It's you, isn't it?

847
01:00:39,886 --> 01:00:42,388
Are you worrying about me now?

848
01:00:42,889 --> 01:00:46,643
I came because you kept on begging,
but I don't know if I should.

849
01:00:47,268 --> 01:00:49,437
Noh Ji-uk and Eun Bong-hui were together?

850
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:50,647
I keep getting this feeling...

851
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:52,899
annoyingly protective feeling
when it comes to Eun Bong-hui.

852
01:00:53,107 --> 01:00:56,194
I'm going to go back
to my ex-boyfriend whom I betrayed.

853
01:00:56,277 --> 01:00:57,820
Come back to me.

854
01:00:57,904 --> 01:00:59,364
Come work with me,

855
01:00:59,739 --> 01:01:00,865
Bong-hui.

856
01:01:05,745 --> 01:01:07,914
