1
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:35,243
-You're back.
-Yes.

2
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:36,870
Let me see your face.

3
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,288
No, it's okay. Go away.

4
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,790
I've been staying up until now
to see your face.

5
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,375
You have to show me.

6
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:43,626
Got you!

7
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:57,182
It was a thirty-versus-two fight.

8
00:00:57,265 --> 00:01:00,101
It was a fierce fight. There were
thirty guys against the two of us.

9
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:14,199
Gosh, what kind of scums did this to you?

10
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:16,910
You don't need to know.
They're just jerks.

11
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:20,163
Call me next time. You know
I'm a fourth-degree tae kwon do master.

12
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,294
Be gentle.

13
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,674
The other side too.

14
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:43,937
Sometimes, it doesn't look like
he suffers from insomnia.

15
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:21,224
This is the definition
of the word "beginning."

16
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:41,077
The first step of an act
or a circumstance.

17
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:45,540
Or the first step of an emotion.

18
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:20,450
Well...

19
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:24,913
Don't get the wrong idea.

20
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:26,623
Why? What is it?

21
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:31,210
What do you mean why?

22
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:34,672
I don't know
what you are telling me not to do.

23
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,843
I just told you not to get the wrong idea
since it was nothing.

24
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:41,721
If you ask me that question,
I don't know how to respond to that.

25
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:45,391
Teasing you is fun.

26
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,437
Hey, I've been too nice to you, haven't I?

27
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:52,023
Not really.

28
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:53,691
-You think I'm easy.
-No, comfortable.

29
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,693
I'm the CEO and you are a mere employee.

30
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:58,905
I forgot for a moment
that you pull ranks on people.

31
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:00,823
Really? Let me refresh your memory

32
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,617
of the days when you were a trainee.

33
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,785
I'll behave now.

34
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:06,204
You knew you were misbehaving.

35
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:09,582
I'm sorry. I overstepped my boundary
because I was hyper.

36
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,042
Are you drunk? Why are you hyper?

37
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:13,920
I'm not drunk. I was hyper
because I was in a good mood.

38
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:21,010
I didn't get to thank you properly.
Thank you.

39
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:24,097
You always rescue me
whenever I'm at a dead end.

40
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:26,432
Pay me back with hard work.

41
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:27,976
I'll do my best.

42
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:30,687
Okay. Do your best.

43
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:37,610
Make sure you lock your door.
I might accidentally go in.

44
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:40,822
I was kidding. I was hyper.

45
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:43,533
Darn it. Why do you keep getting hyper?

46
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:02,135
GOT HIRED AND BECAME A HOSTAGE

47
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:10,893
Nice.

48
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,029
This is our very first meeting at last.

49
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:25,825
The beginning is...

50
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,453
-always thrilling.
-You're not firing her?

51
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:32,248
Why are you glaring at me?
Ms. Lack-of-evidence.

52
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:38,004
We are feeling a bit fierce
from the start, aren't we?

53
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:39,839
Should I brief you on recruiting first?

54
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:41,883
-Please.
-We need secretaries, clerks--

55
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:43,885
We have a secretary, Ms. Lack-of-evidence.

56
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:46,262
I'm a lawyer with a proper license.

57
00:05:46,345 --> 00:05:48,598
You'll be both. If you don't like it,
pay for your position.

58
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:50,308
Who would pay for
his or her position at work?

59
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:52,226
You should do that

60
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,771
because you will bring our firm
only negative effects.

61
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:59,650
I'll make the profits, Mr. Byeon.

62
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:02,487
All right. You are our only hope.

63
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:06,407
That's why you should make me a partner.

64
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:09,786
Instead of Noh Ji-uk Law Firm,
make it Ji and Noh.

65
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:12,830
Or Noh and Ji?

66
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:14,832
We should go ahead with Byeon and Noh.

67
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:19,128
Then Mr. Byeon,
we should go with Noh, Ji, and Byeon.

68
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:21,756
If you're going to include
everyone's name, then add mine too.

69
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:23,716
Noh, Ji, Byeon, Eun, and Bang.

70
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:25,551
I added my last name too.

71
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:28,846
Let's move onto the next agenda.

72
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:31,390
-The next agenda is--
-By the way,

73
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:34,977
what happened to your faces?
Did you have a fight?

74
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:38,856
No, we just had to teach
20 or 30 high school juveniles.

75
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:43,069
As for me, I won a fight
against 37 people all by myself.

76
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:44,862
-Did you just laugh at me?
-Did I?

77
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:46,531
It was a rainy night.

78
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,283
There were 37 thugs in our neighborhood.

79
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:50,368
The beginning...

80
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:52,537
is often quite clumsy.

81
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:54,914
But this is

82
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:57,083
worse than being clumsy.

83
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,210
This is a freaking mess!

84
00:06:59,418 --> 00:07:00,586
Get to work!

85
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:22,608
What's your relationship with her?

86
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:25,069
What? What do you mean?

87
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,780
I saw everything earlier.

88
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:29,115
Can't you hear me?

89
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:31,367
Hire Eun-hyeok!

90
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:32,577
-Whatever.
-You little...

91
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:36,914
What?

92
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,126
That brat.

93
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:46,799
What?

94
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:50,470
Why is she coming out of there?

95
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,138
Are you living with her?

96
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:57,310
She had nowhere to go,
so I'm just letting her stay here.

97
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,479
It's okay.

98
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:01,189
You can be honest with me.

99
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:05,151
Is there really nothing going on
between you two?

100
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,361
Nothing.

101
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:13,993
Ms. Eun!

102
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:19,832
Where have you been?

103
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,502
I ran a small errand for Mr. Bang.
I also needed to get something.

104
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,920
Bye, then.

105
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,004
Hey.

106
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:30,176
You know what happened
between me and Ji-uk, right?

107
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:33,471
Whom should I badmouth for you?

108
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,680
A friend of mine.

109
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:45,107
That friend who was with Yu-jeong...

110
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:48,194
that night.

111
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:51,531
You're very quick-witted.

112
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:53,741
It's both my strength and weakness.

113
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:56,160
People don't like that I'm quick-witted.

114
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:06,212
Ji-uk called me thanks to you.

115
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:10,925
He wanted me to defend your case.

116
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:15,054
I guess...

117
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:18,516
I became a murder suspect
in order to help you guys

118
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:20,184
get back in touch.

119
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:22,770
That's right.
I really can't thank you enough.

120
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:30,403
I know you hate me,

121
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,863
but don't hate me too much.

122
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:36,951
It wasn't even my love affair.
I have no right to hate you.

123
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:40,413
I really don't like
jerks and wenches who...

124
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:44,458
I really don't like cheaters.

125
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:51,048
But why are you always
joking around and laughing?

126
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:53,259
If I don't joke around,

127
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:58,347
how can I hang around Ji-uk?

128
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:02,602
I don't know

129
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,478
any other way.

130
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,195
I guess I was meant to be a lawyer.

131
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,239
I really can't picture myself
as a prosecutor or judge.

132
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:18,409
Instead of accusing and judging
someone of their crime,

133
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:21,996
I'm the type who'd rather plead for mercy.

134
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:25,082
I'm more fit to be a lawyer.

135
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:28,377
You're good-hearted.

136
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:29,420
My gosh.

137
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:32,048
My colleagues
will laugh at what you just said.

138
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:35,551
I'm a murderer.
I'm a person who killed someone.

139
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:45,936
So you ended up kicking that pervert?

140
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,021
That's right.

141
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:50,274
Everything got so messed up
because of him.

142
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:53,736
You're really something.
I admire your courage.

143
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,489
They seem close.

144
00:10:58,491 --> 00:10:59,575
No way.

145
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:01,911
Are you jealous?

146
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,747
Come on! That's nonsense.

147
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,583
If Bong-hui is in her right mind,

148
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:10,169
she'd never become friends
with a jerk like Eun-hyeok...

149
00:11:13,672 --> 00:11:15,758
What's with everyone today?

150
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,678
Why are you laughing?

151
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,516
Hurry up and tell me.

152
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:27,019
-Well, it's not...
-Gosh, it's cold!

153
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:27,978
Hey!

154
00:11:28,687 --> 00:11:30,189
You're spraying water on me.

155
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:31,941
What's wrong with you, Ji-uk?

156
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,317
Mr. Noh?

157
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:34,610
Hey!

158
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:36,862
What's wrong with you?

159
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,740
I'm going to go in now.

160
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,661
Hey, stop. You're getting my suit wet.

161
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:45,371
My gosh, stop it.

162
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:46,914
Hey! It's cold!

163
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:53,462
Did you finish your training?

164
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:54,547
Yes.

165
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:56,132
Our boss is here.

166
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:00,386
Hello.

167
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:03,681
Thank you so much.
Nobody would hire me at my age.

168
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,851
Darn it.

169
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,563
It's nice to meet you.

170
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:14,567
"Darn it. It's nice to meet you"?

171
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:17,862
I tend to curse when I'm nervous.

172
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:21,031
Are you sure that we've never met?

173
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:22,741
Miss.

174
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,452
Look at me in the eyes.

175
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:26,745
Look at me in the eyes and answer me.

176
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:29,331
Is it really your first time seeing me?

177
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:30,374
I feel like

178
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:33,085
I was born again.

179
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,547
My goodness, you're funny.

180
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,048
You are a newborn baby.

181
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:39,925
Why don't you cry like one?

182
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:44,763
But then again, newborn babies
do tend to have a lot of wrinkles.

183
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:49,393
What an old and brazen newborn baby.

184
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:50,936
Let's welcome her with an applause.

185
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:56,442
Miss,

186
00:12:56,775 --> 00:12:57,943
you better watch out.

187
00:12:58,402 --> 00:13:01,363
I'm the incarnation of revenge.

188
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:05,367
My gosh, this is so frustrating.

189
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:11,373
But I'm going to let it go.

190
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,464
I look forward to working with you, ma'am.

191
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:21,675
I'm a very diligent worker.

192
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:24,303
I may be old, but I make sure
to keep a neat appearance.

193
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,764
I live from hand to mouth, you see.

194
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:29,141
I can't afford to lose a month's pay.

195
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:33,354
My husband doesn't earn a single penny
and lies in bed.

196
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:36,315
But I still need to provide for him
because he's my husband.

197
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:38,442
My daughter's trying her best,

198
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:40,528
but she doesn't have a stable job yet.

199
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:42,655
As a parent, the least I could do

200
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:44,323
is to provide for myself.

201
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:46,825
That's why I changed my mind...

202
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:48,953
and decided to stay.

203
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,664
Why are you so pitiful?

204
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:53,040
I know.

205
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:54,583
I feel sorry for you,

206
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,710
but I also feel annoyed by you.
This is confusing me.

207
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:57,836
I know.

208
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:01,757
I'd also love to be arrogant
without having to be so pitiful.

209
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:04,093
Just like someone I know.

210
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:05,219
Hey!

211
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:08,889
What should I do first?

212
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:10,891
I don't know. Just find something to do.

213
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:14,395
My goodness, you must've eaten
a lot of chicken and pizza.

214
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:15,938
You have such a strong voice.

215
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:19,024
Well, yes. Our pizza tastes delicious.

216
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,402
Wait a minute.

217
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:24,321
What does that have anything to do
with my voice?

218
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:26,490
Exactly.

219
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:28,033
My gosh.

220
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:31,328
My gosh, she always has the last word!

221
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:34,540
My goodness. Hey, Mom and Dad.

222
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:37,251
I heard other ancestors
look out for their children from above.

223
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:39,461
Why did you have to send me here
to work for that wench?

224
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:43,757
Hello.

225
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:46,510
They haven't caught the culprit yet.

226
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,637
What? That's so scary.

227
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:49,847
THE SUSPECT STILL AT LARGE

228
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,563
STAR CHEF'S DEATH SHOCKS EVERYONE

229
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,107
What do you think the reason is?

230
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:04,653
Why would someone kill a person?

231
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:06,739
I'm not sure.

232
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:09,325
I guess everybody has their own situation
and reason.

233
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,243
What kind of situation
can justify a murder?

234
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,877
Revenge for certain women.

235
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:29,053
A reasonable punishment.

236
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:35,434
Hey.

237
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:08,217
DEUTERONOMY 22:25

238
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,551
"But if out in the country a man

239
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:12,846
happens to meet a young woman
pledged to be married and rapes her,

240
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:15,516
only the man who has done this shall die.

241
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:19,144
Deuteronomy 22:25."

242
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:30,114
A thief.

243
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:31,365
A thief.

244
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:37,663
A thief. It was done by a thief.

245
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:38,998
A thief did this.

246
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:43,002
Something expensive.

247
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:44,795
Something expensive needs to be gone.

248
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:50,217
Mr. Jung Hyeon-su.

249
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:53,971
You're under arrest
for the murder of Yang Jin-wu.

250
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,557
You have the right to a lawyer

251
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,726
and to resist an unlawful apprehension.

252
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,067
How do you feel at the moment?

253
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:09,486
-What's your motive?
-Why did you kill him?

254
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:10,779
Please say a few words!

255
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,322
Please step back.

256
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:24,418
I heard you kept denying the charges
during the police interrogation.

257
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:28,172
There's a witness who saw you
on the day of the incident.

258
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:33,469
You used to deliver packages
to residents in Donga Building One.

259
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:37,181
Because of that, one of the residents

260
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,975
recognized you right away.

261
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:41,894
He's the courier guy.

262
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:44,354
That's not all.

263
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:47,900
The footprints, DNA and other evidence
found at the scene...

264
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:50,069
Everything is pointing at you.

265
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:53,197
What I'm trying to say
is that denying it is of no use.

266
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:59,953
I'll prosecute you
for robbery and homicide.

267
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:04,833
Are you remaining silent?

268
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:07,628
I guess you paid attention
when they read you Miranda warning.

269
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:09,379
MIRANDA WARNING:
NOTIFYING A SUSPECT'S RIGHTS

270
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:11,215
Well...

271
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:15,427
You won't believe me
even if I tell you the truth, right?

272
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:18,097
You're jumping to conclusions
without even trying.

273
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,308
I know that much.

274
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:27,731
I admit it.

275
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:31,360
I don't believe you, Mr. Jung Hyeon-su.

276
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:43,747
Will anyone be able to really understand

277
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:46,500
and believe me?

278
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:59,304
How do the lyrics go? Well, who cares?

279
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:20,993
Backing the car into a parking spot!

280
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:25,622
Nicely done. Perfect job.
I got it done at one blow.

281
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:31,712
You get to use a company car?
What a great place to work.

282
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,673
I can use it whenever I need it for work.
Isn't it great?

283
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:37,551
I can eat as much pizza as I want.
Isn't it great?

284
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:39,219
Gosh, that's amazing.

285
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,638
-Order anything.
-What should I get?

286
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:42,806
You can order everything.

287
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:51,148
The chairman is a man
named Byeon Yeong-hui.

288
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:54,818
His voice is loud,
but he's so petty-minded.

289
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:57,571
You wouldn't even believe
how petty and small-minded he is.

290
00:19:57,654 --> 00:19:59,072
It blows my mind.

291
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,866
Let me vent to you about a venomous snake.

292
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:03,160
Every word my boss utters is like venom.

293
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:05,537
My boss too.
Every word he utters is like a bomb.

294
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:06,663
Even her eyes look evil.

295
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:08,123
My boss' eyes look messed up.

296
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,209
That woman is so cold.

297
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:13,629
You can feel her cold energy
even when she's 15m away...

298
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,132
The cold energy is...

299
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:24,723
Is she your daughter?

300
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:27,643
I didn't know anyone could become
a lawyer these days.

301
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:33,023
Mom. Recently, there was a verdict
that workplace harassment

302
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,817
can be considered
an industrial accident as well.

303
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:38,862
Just keep that in mind.
Oh, and the Ministry of Labor is

304
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:42,241
putting together recommendations for
eliminating workplace harassment.

305
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:47,162
Are you saying those things
to me right now?

306
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:49,373
Not at all. Why would I?

307
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:54,211
After bad-mouthing me like that,
you're saying those things to--

308
00:20:57,297 --> 00:20:58,715
I think this is about work.

309
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:01,009
Hello? Lawyer Eun Bong-hui speaking.

310
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:03,512
-I obviously know who you are.
-Hey, Lawyer Noh!

311
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:05,555
What? "Lawyer Noh"?

312
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:07,182
What's up? Get to the point.

313
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:10,852
Hey, stop being ridiculous
and get yourself back here immediately.

314
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:13,063
Oh, I totally forgot
about the meeting with our client.

315
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:14,147
All right.

316
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:18,026
Is she out of her mind?

317
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:19,695
Daughter, you're so cool.

318
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:21,697
Don't forget, Mom.

319
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,032
Workplace harassment
can be considered an industrial accident.

320
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:26,702
What? That little...

321
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:31,123
Gosh, she sure takes after you!

322
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:37,087
The police, who have been
investigating Mr. Jung who was

323
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:39,631
arrested as a suspect for
the murder of Chef Yang Jin-wu,

324
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:42,759
sent Mr. Jung to the prosecution
this morning

325
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:45,345
for robbery and murder charges.
Those in prosecution are saying

326
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:47,973
that he is denying the allegation
and that any details...

327
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:52,686
The suspect, Mr. Jung,
wants me to take on the case?

328
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:03,655
I heard that you succeeded in
killing your boyfriend.

329
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:07,242
I know you have your ways.
You know how to get away with murder.

330
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:09,453
People like that come to me.

331
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:12,122
They assume I'm like them
because I was a murder suspect.

332
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:14,207
You're useful, Ms. Lack-of-evidence.

333
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:16,043
It could actually help us
promote the firm.

334
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:17,461
It's all over the media, you know.

335
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:19,546
Our firm will surely be well-known.

336
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:20,964
"Be famous,

337
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:23,133
and they will praise you
even when you are pooping."

338
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:24,343
Oh, Andy Warhol.

339
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:25,761
No, it's not.

340
00:22:26,344 --> 00:22:28,055
-He actually never said it.
-See?

341
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:31,683
Even something you didn't say
becomes famous when you're famous.

342
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:33,477
Yes, that's so true.

343
00:22:34,352 --> 00:22:37,981
Who knew Ms. Lack-of-evidence
would be so useful?

344
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:39,900
A lawyer who has experience
with being arrested.

345
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:41,610
Share your experience
in the detention cell.

346
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:43,820
A lawyer who understands how killers feel.

347
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:45,530
I don't. I don't understand them.

348
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:49,659
They keep calling me Lack-of-evidence.

349
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:53,330
Yes.

350
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:55,207
All right, Mom.

351
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,251
Okay.

352
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:03,715
Did something happen?

353
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:07,511
A young woman insulted my mom today.

354
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:10,097
My gosh, how rude.

355
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,348
What's wrong with people?

356
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:13,683
What do you need?

357
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:15,393
Well...

358
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:19,689
I'm heading out to visit Jung Hyeon-su.
Should I go alone?

359
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:29,825
Do you know why I quit the firm
and opened my own practice?

360
00:23:30,408 --> 00:23:32,536
-No.
-To make others do all the work.

361
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:37,040
That's what CEOs do.
They suck the life out of their employees.

362
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:40,335
I'll go with her, Ji-uk.

363
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,021
Hello.

364
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:03,108
Hey, Ji-uk! My gosh.

365
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:05,944
I had this terrible nightmare last night.

366
00:24:06,027 --> 00:24:07,404
Maybe it's because I was to meet you.

367
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:09,406
I'll go in first.

368
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:12,450
I'm sure I hate this more.

369
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:14,744
Hey, do you bring her everywhere?

370
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:16,288
Why?

371
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:18,039
I don't even know.

372
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:35,891
How have you been, Ms. Cha?

373
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:39,269
Not well. What about you, Ms. Eun?

374
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:41,438
I've been very well.

375
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:42,981
-Good for you.
-It is good.

376
00:24:43,064 --> 00:24:45,984
Let me cut to the chase.
Are you two really dating?

377
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:49,321
Am I obligated to answer that question?

378
00:24:49,404 --> 00:24:50,655
I do have the right to know.

379
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:53,116
You talk about that right to know
whenever it works for you.

380
00:24:55,952 --> 00:24:56,953
I'm so annoyed.

381
00:24:57,495 --> 00:24:58,413
Same here.

382
00:24:58,496 --> 00:25:00,540
I really liked you when I first saw you.

383
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:01,917
Why does it have to be you?

384
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,295
That's what I want to say.
I really liked you too.

385
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:08,548
And why did he have to date
such a pretty woman?

386
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:10,508
It upsets me so much.

387
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:12,928
What's she saying?

388
00:25:13,803 --> 00:25:16,473
What a bunch of bullshit.

389
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:20,185
So? You won't tell me?

390
00:25:20,727 --> 00:25:22,229
I asked if you two are actually dating.

391
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,942
Yes, we are.

392
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:34,032
It's a lie. I knew it.

393
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:35,951
No, it's true.

394
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:38,453
I knew it. With me around,
Ji-uk would never--

395
00:25:38,536 --> 00:25:39,621
Right, you are around...

396
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:44,876
but I chose her.

397
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:56,554
Shall we?

398
00:26:13,571 --> 00:26:16,449
Hey, Bong-hui, are you okay?

399
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:18,910
Your face looks all weird.

400
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:24,541
I forget to breathe sometimes.

401
00:26:24,624 --> 00:26:26,668
How can you forget to breathe?

402
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:30,297
You gave me a hard time
for acting like your girlfriend!

403
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,381
And now this?

404
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:36,845
Well, you know.
I can't turn my employee into a liar.

405
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:40,849
How shall I put this?

406
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:43,935
Shall I say I reaped what you sowed?

407
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:45,061
Whatever!

408
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,272
You think I'm easy, don't you?

409
00:26:47,355 --> 00:26:49,357
-Yes.
-I've been way too lenient.

410
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:50,483
We're late.

411
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:52,360
We were already late long ago.

412
00:26:56,614 --> 00:26:59,242
There are more than 20,000 lawyers
in this country nowadays.

413
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:02,620
Why did you choose me over others
who have better winning-rate?

414
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:05,957
If you were planning to ask me
how to get out of a murder charge

415
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:07,959
or to ask for tips on lack of evidence--

416
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:15,008
Why are you laughing?

417
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:19,471
This is driving me nuts.

418
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:23,516
I killed him.

419
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:25,226
I stabbed him.

420
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:29,064
Is this the answer you were looking for?

421
00:27:31,649 --> 00:27:34,277
Is there no other way
than admitting to a false charge

422
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:36,196
and plea for mercy?

423
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:40,825
Ms. Eun.

424
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:42,369
I...

425
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:48,708
I thought you might be
my only ray of hope.

426
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:50,335
Mr. Noh, you believe me, don't you?

427
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:54,839
I trust that you believe me.

428
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:56,257
To me,

429
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:58,468
you are my only hope.

430
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:00,845
I'm a delivery man.
You know this, don't you?

431
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:06,142
I can't even count how many times
I've been to that neighborhood

432
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:08,019
and that house.

433
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:10,563
They're saying that's the evidence.

434
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:14,109
They told me that's the evidence.
That's the evidence.

435
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:15,944
That is the evidence for the murder.

436
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:18,029
That's how they got me
and put me in this seat.

437
00:28:19,697 --> 00:28:23,910
I still don't understand
why I'm sitting in this seat now.

438
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:26,496
I don't even understand
how this happened to me.

439
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:29,374
To be honest, I'm really lonely.

440
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:33,878
This situation scares me.

441
00:28:34,629 --> 00:28:35,630
It really does.

442
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:38,717
Then I did some thinking.

443
00:28:39,509 --> 00:28:41,177
I thought that

444
00:28:41,594 --> 00:28:43,930
there may be a person
who sincerely understands and believes me.

445
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:46,433
There might be a person
whom I could rely on.

446
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:50,228
That's it.

447
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:57,360
I don't know why this is happening to me.

448
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:00,363
I can't believe this is really happening,
and I'm scared.

449
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:03,575
But you are the only person I can rely on.

450
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:17,046
You're asking me if Bong-hui
really killed the son of the Chief?

451
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:18,173
Yes.

452
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,759
She doesn't look like
she would do that sort of thing.

453
00:29:23,052 --> 00:29:26,347
I've been a prosecutor
only for a few years.

454
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:29,058
I've met a lot of criminals
who committed murder.

455
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:32,854
My conclusion is

456
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:35,648
everyone is capable of killing a person.

457
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:40,779
Of course, some people are just born
as psychopaths and crazy jerks.

458
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:42,447
Excluding them,

459
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:45,241
normal people do kill people too.

460
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,160
They kill in the heat of anger.

461
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:49,579
People die from a simple beating.
They kill people accidentally.

462
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:51,623
Some people murder people out of hatred

463
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:53,750
and money as well.

464
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:56,044
Therefore, my answer
to your question is...

465
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:00,632
Yes, Bong-hui killed him.

466
00:30:01,257 --> 00:30:03,718
It's based on my personal feelings

467
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:05,553
and reasonable doubts.

468
00:30:07,847 --> 00:30:09,724
I didn't know
this is how you thought of her.

469
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:12,477
I'm letting this take its own course,

470
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:14,687
but one day,

471
00:30:15,271 --> 00:30:17,690
I'm definitely going to catch her.

472
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:19,442
Ms. Na.

473
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:22,111
What you said...

474
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:25,657
is helping me come up with an excuse.

475
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:28,034
Sorry?

476
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,161
Nothing.

477
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:36,417
In the afternoon of the incident,

478
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,378
since the weather was great,

479
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,089
I went for a walk to the park.

480
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:44,175
Girls were having fun with the balloons

481
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:46,010
and running about. They were so cute.

482
00:30:47,762 --> 00:30:51,266
I remembered The Usual Suspects
was being re-released.

483
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:52,892
So I went to the movies
to catch that film.

484
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:55,895
I came back
because the schedule didn't fit mine.

485
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,522
And...

486
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:03,194
I had the street food for lunch that day.

487
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:05,822
I had tteokbokki.
I had good coffee though.

488
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:07,490
I had tteokbokki and cafe mocha.

489
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,450
I added whipped cream
on top of the coffee.

490
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:13,913
And I had a drink by myself at a bar
that I visit sometimes.

491
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:15,456
I usually drink alone.

492
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:18,668
By the way, at the bar,

493
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:20,503
a couple had a birthday party on that day.

494
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:22,046
One, two, three.

495
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:25,091
This was a video.

496
00:31:25,174 --> 00:31:26,134
Seriously?

497
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:28,052
-Got you.
-He got us.

498
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:29,762
-Come sit down.
-Let me see.

499
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:32,098
Here it is.

500
00:31:32,515 --> 00:31:35,476
They brought a birthday cake with candles.

501
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:53,077
There's no physical evidence
that can prove his alibi.

502
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:56,706
There's nothing on his transit pass,
and there are no photos either.

503
00:31:56,831 --> 00:31:58,666
He even paid for his drink with cash.

504
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,668
He said he rarely uses credit cards.

505
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:02,879
-Do you actually believe that?
-I was in his shoes.

506
00:32:02,962 --> 00:32:04,964
There was no physical evidence
that could prove my alibi.

507
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:06,841
You're overly empathizing with him.

508
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:09,552
We're lawyers.
We have to side with our clients.

509
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:11,346
This is precisely why I hate lawyers.

510
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:12,764
Then why did you become one?

511
00:32:12,847 --> 00:32:14,307
I became one because of you...

512
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:27,153
Do not empathize with all murderers
in this world.

513
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:30,239
With all due respect,
I do not empathize with murderers.

514
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:32,325
I only do so with someone
wrongfully accused of murder.

515
00:32:32,408 --> 00:32:34,869
I'm saying there's no evidence
of him being wrongly accused.

516
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:36,371
I'm not trying to say

517
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:38,581
that I'll blindly believe him.
I'm saying we should check

518
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:40,458
all facts and believe him
if he seems innocent,

519
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:41,626
and we should do our best.

520
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:43,002
You already believe him.

521
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:44,379
We're his lawyers!

522
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:45,838
This is why I hate lawyers...

523
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:48,758
From over there to here,

524
00:32:48,841 --> 00:32:50,885
I've been repeating myself because of you!

525
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:53,471
Because of me? It was because of you!

526
00:32:53,554 --> 00:32:55,723
Why is it because of me?
It was all because of you!

527
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:56,766
It's your fault.

528
00:32:57,016 --> 00:32:58,726
You're seriously a piece of work.

529
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:00,561
Stop right there! Hey.

530
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:10,655
Hey.

531
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:13,157
Why didn't you answer my calls?

532
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:15,159
Why are you and Ji-uk
treating me like this?

533
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:17,036
Are you two ganging up against me or what?

534
00:33:17,912 --> 00:33:19,455
Why am I being so childish?

535
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:20,790
I don't even know anymore.

536
00:33:20,873 --> 00:33:23,501
Everything got messed up
because of you two.

537
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:27,463
I know that you guys hate me.

538
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,674
I admit that what I did was bad.

539
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:31,926
You were bad too.

540
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:35,179
But what's so wrong with that?

541
00:33:36,222 --> 00:33:38,266
Hey, did you know
that Ji-uk has a girlfriend now?

542
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:40,935
How could you let him date someone
who used to be a murder suspect?

543
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:45,148
Why am I blabbering away like this?
I'm so annoyed.

544
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:51,988
It's been a long time.

545
00:33:54,323 --> 00:33:55,324
Yes.

546
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:57,243
It has been a long time.

547
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:01,247
You should get going.

548
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:02,790
What?

549
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,168
Let's...

550
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:11,257
only run into each other by chance.

551
00:35:26,749 --> 00:35:29,043
I think it's somewhere around here.

552
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:35,633
This is it.

553
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:54,193
I think there used to be
a cake shop around here.

554
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:55,361
Please stay in the car. I'll--

555
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:56,487
No, I'll go.

556
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:00,992
I should get it myself.

557
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:18,092
Today is my son's birthday.

558
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:23,306
Cheesecake was his favorite.

559
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:26,142
I will wrap one for you.

560
00:36:57,506 --> 00:36:59,091
Oh, sir.

561
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:06,307
How dare you smile?

562
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:10,311
-Excuse me?
-Do you know what day today is?

563
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:12,271
How could you laugh and smile like that?

564
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:17,443
If he were alive,

565
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:21,280
he would be lighting the candles
about now.

566
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:24,408
I would be holding the hand of my son,

567
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:28,454
who would be alive.
My heart is breaking into pieces

568
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:30,456
as I buy a cake he can't even eat.

569
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:35,002
How dare you?
You are smiling all you want.

570
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:38,089
Sir, that's...

571
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:44,804
If I were a mere, insignificant thug,

572
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:46,222
it would have been better.

573
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:49,600
If I were a savage
who didn't care for the law or ideals...

574
00:37:50,893 --> 00:37:52,895
An eye for an eye. A tooth for a tooth.

575
00:37:53,312 --> 00:37:56,899
I would have ripped you into pieces
immediately.

576
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:23,175
I really didn't do it.

577
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:30,057
There's nothing I can do
even if you don't believe me.

578
00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:32,184
I...

579
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:36,564
didn't do it. You can accuse
me all you want,

580
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:39,025
but I can't admit
to what I never did, sir.

581
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:40,109
Prove it then!

582
00:38:42,194 --> 00:38:45,614
If you are not the real culprit,
bring me the real culprit.

583
00:38:46,615 --> 00:38:48,200
Until then, you're the culprit.

584
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:51,912
To me, you are the only culprit.

585
00:39:32,411 --> 00:39:33,746
This is the alibi of Jung Hyeon-su.

586
00:39:37,124 --> 00:39:40,127
He said he could have seen him,
but he was not certain.

587
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:42,463
The bar owner didn't help,

588
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:45,508
but I found this.

589
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:52,681
MAY 20TH: BIRTHDAY

590
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:54,517
The birthday photo
on the day of the incident.

591
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,105
This completely backs up
what Jung Hyeon-su told us, doesn't it?

592
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:01,357
However, it won't be considered evidence

593
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,942
that could prove his alibi.

594
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:06,153
This gives us grounds
that we can trust him.

595
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:09,490
I scored one today.

596
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:47,236
I'm relieved.

597
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:49,613
This won't be a major bruise.

598
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:52,575
It's all right, Bong-hui.

599
00:40:53,742 --> 00:40:54,869
Yes?

600
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:20,686
What happened?

601
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:24,523
This is nothing.

602
00:41:26,233 --> 00:41:27,401
It's okay. You can tell me.

603
00:41:39,538 --> 00:41:41,165
I don't want to talk about it.

604
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:45,169
Okay.

605
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:50,549
Will you be okay?

606
00:41:55,262 --> 00:41:56,263
Okay.

607
00:41:57,139 --> 00:41:58,599
All right, then.

608
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,887
I'll make copies of evidence files
including footprints

609
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:38,222
and the DNA in the buttons.

610
00:42:38,305 --> 00:42:40,724
By the way, the witness
is a senior citizen.

611
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:42,726
Does the witness have good eyesight?

612
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:44,603
Gosh.

613
00:42:45,479 --> 00:42:47,606
Ms. Lack-of-evidence,
bring me a cup of water.

614
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:52,653
Then we should get rid of the witness.

615
00:42:53,612 --> 00:42:55,155
I have to find out more
about the assailant.

616
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:57,157
Since I have other cases,
I can't help out a lot,

617
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:58,534
but I will help whenever I can.

618
00:43:00,035 --> 00:43:01,662
Hey, Ms. Lack-of-evidence?

619
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:03,330
-Ms. Eun, a pen, please?
-Yes, sir.

620
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:09,003
You can't hear only
when I'm talking to you, right?

621
00:43:09,336 --> 00:43:11,255
She has selective hearing.

622
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:13,257
Darn!

623
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:16,343
I'll get some water.

624
00:43:22,641 --> 00:43:25,477
Can the witness identify
the suspect at this distance?

625
00:43:26,812 --> 00:43:29,398
It might be possible
if the witness knew the suspect.

626
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:31,442
One more time. Let's do it again.

627
00:43:37,489 --> 00:43:40,659
The witness claimed
that she knew the restaurants,

628
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:44,371
neighbors, and residents
in that neighborhood.

629
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:47,583
Why was she staring at
someone else's house?

630
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:48,792
It's because she's lonely.

631
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:50,836
When we are lonely,
we look at other people.

632
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:53,714
We look to see what others are doing
or if others are not lonely.

633
00:43:58,844 --> 00:43:59,845
Can you see me?

634
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:03,223
One more time?

635
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:21,867
Something is off,

636
00:44:22,618 --> 00:44:24,036
but I can't put a finger on it.

637
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:26,872
We are tracing the stolen items now.
Something might turn up.

638
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:31,752
Why would the robber stab the victim
so many times?

639
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:36,674
Oh, you're right.

640
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:38,300
The murder weapon hasn't been found yet?

641
00:44:38,592 --> 00:44:39,635
No.

642
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:51,522
You don't have to visit me
every single time.

643
00:44:51,605 --> 00:44:54,775
I'm thankful and sorry, Ms. Eun.

644
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:56,568
Don't be.

645
00:44:57,945 --> 00:44:58,946
Excuse me.

646
00:45:02,616 --> 00:45:03,617
Yes, Mr. Noh.

647
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:06,328
Yes, I'm in an interview.

648
00:45:07,913 --> 00:45:09,706
I don't know anything.

649
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:12,418
-Okay.
-Thank you.

650
00:45:14,837 --> 00:45:16,839
We can't find anything useful
from this place either?

651
00:45:19,842 --> 00:45:22,511
Excuse me. Could we have a talk?

652
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:26,723
Oh, no. Your looks didn't work.

653
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:28,517
I didn't use my looks just now.

654
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:40,904
By the way, where did we park the car?

655
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:44,867
We parked it somewhere in some alley.

656
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:46,535
But this is an alley too.

657
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:47,661
Exactly.

658
00:45:48,745 --> 00:45:50,289
We'll eventually find it around here.

659
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:52,541
Hey.

660
00:45:53,375 --> 00:45:54,793
She's hopeless.

661
00:46:02,384 --> 00:46:04,678
-Where are we?
-I think we're going in circles.

662
00:46:07,639 --> 00:46:09,850
The alleys here all look alike.

663
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:12,769
-Exactly.
-Why open a restaurant here?

664
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:15,647
It's a trend to open a restaurant
in places like this.

665
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:16,732
Really?

666
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:23,113
-It's raining.
-It's suddenly raining.

667
00:46:23,864 --> 00:46:24,907
Let's go over there.

668
00:46:38,086 --> 00:46:40,130
My gosh, why is it raining
all of a sudden?

669
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:41,965
I washed my hair this morning.

670
00:46:43,258 --> 00:46:45,010
People normally wash their hair
in the morning.

671
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:46,178
It's nothing special.

672
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:47,679
Really?

673
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:49,681
Yes.

674
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:04,047
Let's go.

675
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:06,675
It's still raining a little.

676
00:48:06,758 --> 00:48:08,385
This isn't too bad.

677
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:09,970
We need to prepare for trial. Let's go.

678
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:22,941
Ms. Cha.

679
00:48:25,485 --> 00:48:26,528
Ms. Cha.

680
00:48:31,116 --> 00:48:32,784
I have to go to trial.

681
00:48:32,868 --> 00:48:34,786
Okay, I'll go too.

682
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:36,079
I can go by myself.

683
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:39,958
I'm a pretty decent prosecutor.
I can be eloquent.

684
00:48:40,042 --> 00:48:41,376
You should stay here and rest.

685
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:43,754
No, it's okay. I want to go too.

686
00:48:50,886 --> 00:48:51,970
Do you think Jung Hyeon-su...

687
00:49:21,249 --> 00:49:22,751
Let's go, Ms. Eun.

688
00:49:34,763 --> 00:49:36,515
COURT IN SESSION

689
00:49:36,848 --> 00:49:38,058
DEFENSE COUNSEL

690
00:49:53,865 --> 00:49:57,077
At 7:30 p.m. on May 20, 2017,
the defendant, Jung Hyeon-su,

691
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:59,913
secretly entered the victim's house

692
00:49:59,996 --> 00:50:01,873
to commit burglary.

693
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:05,043
After cruelly murdering the victim
with a sharp weapon,

694
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:06,920
he stole the victim's belongings.

695
00:50:07,003 --> 00:50:10,924
Hence, I accuse the defendant,
Jung Hyeon-su, of murder and theft

696
00:50:11,091 --> 00:50:13,051
under Article 338 of the Criminal Code.

697
00:50:14,094 --> 00:50:17,055
Lawyer, do you admit to the charges?

698
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:25,689
The defendant does not
admit to the charges.

699
00:50:29,067 --> 00:50:31,111
The defendant has no reason

700
00:50:31,194 --> 00:50:34,072
or motive to kill the victim.

701
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:37,159
A murder by a robber

702
00:50:37,242 --> 00:50:40,120
does not require
a specific reason or motive.

703
00:50:40,787 --> 00:50:42,289
You're right.

704
00:50:42,748 --> 00:50:45,584
However, there must be a premise.

705
00:50:45,959 --> 00:50:49,296
The major premise is
that the defendant committed robbery.

706
00:50:49,588 --> 00:50:52,841
We found at the crime scene
a belonging had gone missing.

707
00:50:52,924 --> 00:50:54,760
You're right. Something did go missing.

708
00:50:55,051 --> 00:50:59,389
But there is also no proof that
the missing object was stolen

709
00:50:59,973 --> 00:51:01,057
by the defendant.

710
00:51:03,935 --> 00:51:05,228
The prosecution

711
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:09,357
has yet failed to track down
those missing objects.

712
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:11,526
The missing objects

713
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:14,946
were nowhere to be found
in the defendants' house nor workplace.

714
00:51:15,197 --> 00:51:17,491
Also, when we checked
his bank account and cash,

715
00:51:17,699 --> 00:51:19,743
we could not find
any kind of monetary benefit

716
00:51:19,826 --> 00:51:20,994
from robbery.

717
00:51:21,077 --> 00:51:23,497
Are you claiming
that there was never a thief

718
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:24,498
to begin with?

719
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:25,582
Yes, Your Honor.

720
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:28,084
Let me show you this, Your Honor.

721
00:51:29,961 --> 00:51:32,130
In order for a murder by a robber
to be valid,

722
00:51:32,297 --> 00:51:34,925
one first needs to be proven
guilty of robbery.

723
00:51:35,008 --> 00:51:36,635
Also, one needs to have

724
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:39,262
committed murder
at the chance of robbery itself.

725
00:51:39,721 --> 00:51:42,307
Therefore, the prosecution's charge
against the defendant

726
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:44,851
based on Article 338 of the Criminal Code

727
00:51:44,976 --> 00:51:48,814
is not valid because
the defendant never tried to

728
00:51:49,064 --> 00:51:50,315
commit robbery.

729
00:51:51,316 --> 00:51:54,110
There is also no specific
evidence to prove

730
00:51:54,236 --> 00:51:55,904
that the defendant committed murder.

731
00:51:58,573 --> 00:51:59,699
Therefore, the defendant...

732
00:52:00,992 --> 00:52:02,285
also can't be accused of murder.

733
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:03,328
That is all, Your Honor.

734
00:52:03,411 --> 00:52:05,205
PROSECUTOR

735
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:47,289
If we keep this up until the second trial

736
00:52:47,372 --> 00:52:49,374
and successfully impeach the witness,
we'll win the case,

737
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:50,917
and Jung Hyeon-su will get released.

738
00:52:51,376 --> 00:52:52,377
Mr. Noh?

739
00:53:07,142 --> 00:53:08,184
Yu-jeong.

740
00:53:11,771 --> 00:53:12,731
Ji-uk.

741
00:53:13,064 --> 00:53:14,065
Are you okay?

742
00:53:14,524 --> 00:53:15,817
I'm okay.

743
00:53:16,651 --> 00:53:18,153
I don't think you should drive right now.

744
00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:19,988
I can handle it.

745
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:21,406
No, I'll drive.

746
00:53:22,991 --> 00:53:23,992
Get in.

747
00:54:09,037 --> 00:54:11,039
I know this is going to sound immature,

748
00:54:12,374 --> 00:54:14,250
but I sometimes envy girls who get sick.

749
00:54:15,585 --> 00:54:19,005
My mom gave birth to such a healthy girl,
so I rarely get sick.

750
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:23,969
You don't need to laugh.

751
00:55:51,222 --> 00:55:52,223
Bye.

752
00:55:52,766 --> 00:55:53,767
I'll get going now.

753
00:55:54,434 --> 00:55:55,685
Shouldn't you go to the hospital?

754
00:55:57,270 --> 00:55:59,939
It's okay. I'll get better
after taking a fever reducer and sleep.

755
00:56:00,565 --> 00:56:03,443
You know me. I always feel better
after sweating it out.

756
00:56:03,568 --> 00:56:04,569
All right, then.

757
00:56:12,911 --> 00:56:14,204
You should come in.

758
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:29,469
Just come in for a cup of tea, okay?

759
00:56:29,594 --> 00:56:30,637
Let's not do this.

760
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:35,642
I loved you too much.

761
00:56:36,267 --> 00:56:38,603
That's why your love for me
never felt enough.

762
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:41,606
I was always thirsty for more.

763
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:45,026
I felt like I was always the anxious one
in the relationship.

764
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:47,403
But after you left...

765
00:56:47,654 --> 00:56:48,780
After we broke up,

766
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:52,617
I realized it still had to be you.

767
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:57,205
Even if it meant dying of such thirst,

768
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:00,375
I wanted to be by your side, Ji-uk.

769
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:40,623
It's looks pretty well-organized.

770
00:58:31,841 --> 00:58:33,551
Gosh, why isn't he back yet?

771
00:59:20,598 --> 00:59:22,225
I thought you might not come home.

772
00:59:32,318 --> 00:59:33,570
I like you.

773
00:59:37,699 --> 00:59:38,783
I...

774
00:59:40,868 --> 00:59:42,620
like you, Mr. Noh.

775
01:00:05,143 --> 01:00:06,185
Don't...

776
01:00:09,397 --> 01:00:10,440
fall for me.

777
01:00:15,778 --> 01:00:18,406
Not everything that has started
progresses into something else.

778
01:00:19,198 --> 01:00:22,118
Some things stop as soon as they begin

779
01:00:22,785 --> 01:00:25,246
because every beginning is frightening.

780
01:01:00,156 --> 01:01:02,158
