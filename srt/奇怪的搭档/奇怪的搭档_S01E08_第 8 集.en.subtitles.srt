1
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:53,470
Hello, I'd like fries and beer.

2
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:56,639
I had a drink by myself
at a bar that I visit sometimes.

3
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:58,099
I usually drink alone.

4
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:03,063
By the way, at the bar, a couple
had a birthday party on that day.

5
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:06,066
They brought a birthday cake with candles.

6
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:07,275
Great!

7
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:12,113
-Do you like the flowers?
-Yes.

8
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,174
There is a Latin epigram.

9
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:35,970
"If it's false in one thing,
then it's false in everything."

10
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:12,465
Mr. Jung Hyeon-su,

11
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,801
who...

12
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:17,303
are you?

13
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,683
Mr. Noh.

14
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:28,481
Where are you going?

15
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,818
I thought you already left.

16
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:34,487
But I came back.
You should drink with me too.

17
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:36,406
I already drank a lot.

18
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:38,658
Just have one more drink. Let's go.

19
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:47,750
Gosh.

20
00:02:50,169 --> 00:02:51,296
Goodness.

21
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:57,719
Gosh.

22
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,061
Family?

23
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:10,148
I don't have a family.

24
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:12,609
Everyone in my family
left for some reason.

25
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:14,485
What about you, Mr. Noh?

26
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,864
Well, mine too.

27
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,450
Let's just say,
something similar happened.

28
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:21,534
Okay.

29
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:24,537
-Have a shot.
-Thank you.

30
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:26,456
Pour me one.

31
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:35,381
Oh, right. Do you have a girlfriend?

32
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:39,093
A girlfriend? I don't have a girlfriend.

33
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:40,970
Why? Will you introduce a girl to me,
Mr. Noh?

34
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,430
-No.
-I see.

35
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:44,557
The only girl I know is...

36
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,355
Ms. Eun here. So I don't think
I can introduce a girl to you.

37
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:54,776
You know how people ask questions
about your personal life

38
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:58,655
when they want to be friends with you.

39
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,281
-Oh, that was the point.
-Yes.

40
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,951
Do you have a girlfriend, Mr. Noh?

41
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:04,786
Goodness.

42
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:07,830
You totally got me with that one.

43
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,540
You said people ask questions
to be closer.

44
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:11,584
-I want to be friends with you.
-Right, I said that.

45
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:18,424
I see you two playing truth or dare.

46
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:21,344
Let me in too.

47
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:23,763
I love playing truth or dare.

48
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,557
Wait, we played it
a little while ago though.

49
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:29,102
I like playing truth or dare too.

50
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:31,854
I love Ji-uk!

51
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:34,023
Beep. Truth.

52
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:35,942
What's going on?

53
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,193
Are you awake?

54
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:39,112
I sincerely apologize. They're just

55
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:42,031
all crazy. If you think of them
as crazy people,

56
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,574
-you'll feel at ease.
-No, it's fine.

57
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:46,077
I love it when people are having fun
like this. It's great.

58
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:48,955
It's very fun
and infuriating at the same time.

59
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:52,542
-I'll pour you one.
-Thank you.

60
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:54,794
-This is nice.
-Indeed.

61
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:24,115
Water...

62
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:37,754
Water is here.

63
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:54,228
Water...

64
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,732
I need water again.

65
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:15,708
Am I

66
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,335
dreaming right now?

67
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:20,713
My gosh!

68
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,805
I heard...

69
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,849
it's great for hangovers.

70
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:35,645
Mr. Bang, I really... Mr. Bang!

71
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:38,773
You know that I'm very fond of you,
right? You need to know that.

72
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,194
What should I do now?

73
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:48,241
I said I can do anything I set my mind to.

74
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:51,202
I told myself that I'd give up
my feelings for him.

75
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,085
I need to wake up.

76
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:05,550
Well, I just...

77
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:09,178
took water and medicine to her
because you asked me to.

78
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:13,057
She was disappointed to the point
that she was about to cry.

79
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:14,725
She really did that?

80
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,310
My gosh.

81
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:18,271
I'll scold her.

82
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,399
Just don't get scolded from her.

83
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:23,234
You can't scold her.

84
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:25,653
And it looks like you got the wrong idea.

85
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:28,614
I'm not complaining to you about Ms. Eun.

86
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:31,367
I'm complaining about Mr. Noh
who's right in front of me now.

87
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,119
Why... What do you mean?

88
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:37,206
I have no idea what's going on
between you two.

89
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,795
You said you have another favor to ask.

90
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:44,130
Oh, right.

91
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:46,466
It's about Jung Hyeon-su.

92
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:48,676
Please run some background check on him.

93
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:51,095
You mean, our former client,
Jung Hyeon-su?

94
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,221
Yes.

95
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:53,848
Keep it confidential.

96
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:57,477
Why are you digging up information
on him confidentially?

97
00:07:57,935 --> 00:07:59,854
Just to double-check. You know how I am.

98
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:01,314
Gosh, you still

99
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:03,816
think you're the prosecutor.
You have an issue.

100
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,818
If it could be fixed easily,
it wouldn't be an issue.

101
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:08,279
Goodness, you sure have a way with words.

102
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:11,574
Just think of it as conducting
a light background check.

103
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:14,494
All right. Got it.

104
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,664
Wait, Mr. Bang.

105
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:24,045
Well...

106
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:27,715
I'm grateful.

107
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:29,342
For what?

108
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:31,093
You know.

109
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,512
Everything.

110
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:36,307
You gave up being a civil servant
and joined my firm like this.

111
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:40,353
I'll be sure to pay you well enough.

112
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:43,356
Running the firm alone
must be financially challenging.

113
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:45,191
Mr. Byeon is rich, you know.

114
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:46,901
He won't take his money to his grave.

115
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:49,237
I'm very happy here.

116
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:52,532
I'm working with wonderful people
at a great firm.

117
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,700
I'm really content here.

118
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:56,577
What's the one thing...

119
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,789
you regret the most in your life?

120
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:03,042
Submitting my letter of resignation,
coming here, and meeting all of you.

121
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:09,215
-You should get back to work.
-All right.

122
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,177
Do you need me
to check on Jung Hyeon-su right away?

123
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:17,014
I'm the only paralegal here,
so I have so much work to do.

124
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,393
Right, you can do it
when your time allows.

125
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:21,894
I'll see what I can do.

126
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:23,938
My gosh.

127
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:31,821
What about Jung Hyeon-su?
What are you looking into?

128
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:35,283
Why don't you ask Mr. Noh directly?

129
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:46,419
What about Jung Hyeon-su?

130
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:49,880
Oh, it's

131
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:52,341
-Jung Hyeon-su is...
-Yes.

132
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:55,094
Well...

133
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:03,894
Mr. Noh.

134
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:09,150
I'm over the moon.

135
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:12,028
I'm so thankful.

136
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,282
Whenever I saw Jung Hyeon-su,

137
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:20,995
I felt as if I was looking at myself.

138
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:25,082
I was once pegged as a murder suspect

139
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,627
and was locked up, you know.

140
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:31,380
I felt as if I was looking
at myself from that time.

141
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:36,802
Thanks to that experience,
I could get him his freedom back.

142
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:40,640
I think it's so cool.

143
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:43,643
I also feel truly rewarded.

144
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:46,896
Gosh.

145
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:50,816
I'm so happy.

146
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:54,320
Mr. Noh.

147
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,280
What are you looking into?

148
00:10:58,866 --> 00:10:59,909
Well...

149
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:03,913
You don't need to know about it yet.

150
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:08,334
What is it? Why are you saying
I don't need to know it yet?

151
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,671
Well, if I tell you the reason,

152
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,048
it'll become something you need to know.

153
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:16,342
He was my client too.

154
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:17,551
Why wouldn't you tell me?

155
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:20,554
Because I don't want to tell you.
Because I say so. Okay?

156
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:22,264
-No, we're not.
-Whatever.

157
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:25,309
Oh, right.

158
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:26,560
How's...

159
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,562
your hangover? Are you okay now?

160
00:11:28,687 --> 00:11:29,563
I won't tell you.

161
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:31,315
How can you be so disrespectful
to your mentor--

162
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,317
Mentees take after their mentors.

163
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:34,860
I'm like this because I learned from you.

164
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:36,779
That's not true.
You were always like this.

165
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:37,947
-I was?
-Yes.

166
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,448
-That was such nonsense.
-Darn it.

167
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:41,575
"Darn it"? You little...

168
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:10,479
These inquiries are
all from Mr. Ji's clients.

169
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:13,190
The two of you here

170
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:15,317
should either do pro bono work

171
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,903
or apply to become public defenders.

172
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:20,698
For now, I'll use my connections
I built back in my...

173
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:22,825
Hey.

174
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,619
Are your stomachs all right?

175
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:28,914
The last thing we ate, the sausage
or whatever it was... Gosh.

176
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,499
That killed me.

177
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,418
It's coming up. I can feel it coming up.

178
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:34,837
Gosh, you made me feel nauseous.

179
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,172
I feel like I'm about to throw up.

180
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:37,756
We should quit drinking.

181
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,592
-I agree.
-Me too.

182
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:42,136
If I drink ever again,

183
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,846
you can call me her son.

184
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:45,639
You'll have a son soon, Ms. Eun.

185
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:47,224
I don't want a son like him.

186
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:48,767
What? Why not?

187
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:52,021
What's wrong with me?
I'm handsome and rich, you fool!

188
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:53,439
I just want his money.

189
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:54,565
Let's split it.

190
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:56,901
Why you...

191
00:12:58,777 --> 00:13:01,864
Can we please have a proper meeting
just once at least?

192
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:04,617
That's my earnest wish
at the moment, okay?

193
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,076
I'm back.

194
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,913
What now? What's wrong?
Did you guys upset Ji-uk again?

195
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:10,289
Did the trial go well?

196
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:11,916
Of course. You know me.

197
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:14,418
Oh, right. Make yourselves available
this evening.

198
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:15,753
I'll treat you all.

199
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:18,506
I got an exquisite bottle
of wine as a gift.

200
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:19,757
I have champagne too.

201
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:22,593
I'll prepare whatever you guys want.

202
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,053
Everyone is available, right?

203
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:25,971
I need to use the washroom.

204
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:27,139
The meeting is over.

205
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,682
Over.

206
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:29,892
Well...

207
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:31,101
You're all in, right?

208
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:37,316
You must know why you're here now.

209
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:38,901
Yes.

210
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:41,445
For alleged destruction
of evidence and perjury.

211
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:45,407
I'm not sure if you're aware
that those are serious crimes.

212
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:48,661
Then shall we begin?

213
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:05,678
Just a second.

214
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:13,686
I can't help but think that...

215
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,813
something is strange.

216
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:18,524
Why did you hide...

217
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:21,402
the picture frame?

218
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:25,114
Something's in there, isn't it?

219
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:29,451
I think there is.

220
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:32,997
You can tell me that much, can't you?

221
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:05,613
"But if out in the country,

222
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:08,949
a man happens to meet a young woman
pledged to be married and rapes her,

223
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:11,493
only the man who has done this shall die."

224
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:00,084
The more I think about it,

225
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:04,088
the more I can't understand why.

226
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:06,674
Why did that culprit

227
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:11,303
do such a terrible thing
to Hui-jun and me?

228
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,349
That's because...

229
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:34,493
you witnessed something
you shouldn't have.

230
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:41,208
But unfortunately, you weren't there.

231
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:48,298
And you couldn't recognize me
when you encountered me.

232
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:02,688
I'm going to continue
to keep my eyes on you.

233
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:13,699
If you never find out who I am,

234
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,368
I'll always be good to you.

235
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:40,225
LAWYER EUN BONG-HUI

236
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:42,352
Hello?

237
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:44,730
Ms. Eun, it's me.

238
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:48,400
I was taking a walk in the park by myself.

239
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,736
As I was freely walking around,

240
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:54,448
I suddenly felt sorry and thankful
towards you. That's why I called.

241
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,951
There's no need for you to think that way.

242
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:01,121
Thanks to you, I finally feel like
I became a proper lawyer.

243
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:02,915
It feels great.

244
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,417
-You startled me.
-Is it Jung Hyeon-su?

245
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:06,710
Yes.

246
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:10,798
Sure. Of course. We should meet sometime.

247
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:14,176
Oh, really? Yes, okay.

248
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:17,179
Yes. Really?

249
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:27,731
Yes, I'm listening.

250
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:30,442
Yu-jeong, why are you crying
like a baby in the hallway?

251
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:34,613
Why are you shedding tears in the hallway?

252
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:39,243
One day, I'm going to teach you
how to say things nicely, Ji-hae.

253
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:43,205
-Gosh.
-I see. Okay.

254
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,044
She seemed so cool
when I didn't know her that well.

255
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:51,213
Now that I do, she's quite
a disappointment.

256
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:54,216
I'm starting to lose my respect for her.

257
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,635
Yes, okay.

258
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:58,303
Gosh, what's wrong with you?

259
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,222
I was just curious. Why did he call?

260
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:01,348
He just called to thank me.

261
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:03,016
He wants to meet me since he's thankful.

262
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,644
I also have all the right to hear
and gain his gratitude.

263
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:07,437
I really did my best in court.

264
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:09,690
So let's meet him together.

265
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:14,653
I'll tell Jung Hyeon-su
to personally give you a call.

266
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:16,113
I'll tell him to thank you.

267
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:17,573
So you're meeting him by yourself?

268
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:19,032
-Can't I?
-You can't.

269
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,742
-Why not?
-We defended him together.

270
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,626
My gosh, I'm sorry.

271
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:43,974
We should meet him together, right?

272
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:49,062
Together...

273
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:19,968
Why are you afraid to get on the elevator?

274
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,274
Don't...

275
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:17,442
lay a hand on her.

276
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:18,735
What?

277
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:20,862
I understand.

278
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:23,490
I'm sure you need someone to hate.

279
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:25,450
You probably need someone to blame.

280
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,412
But you shouldn't cross the line.

281
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:30,831
If you ever try to hurt her again,

282
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:34,084
I'm not a lowly person like you are,

283
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:36,336
so I'll press legal charges on you.
But sometimes...

284
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:38,672
I do tend to become a bit barbarous.

285
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:44,261
Are you threatening me again?

286
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:47,139
Yes. I'm threatening you.

287
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:48,849
So listen to me carefully.

288
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:52,811
If you ever hurt Bong-hui again...

289
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:00,861
I'm going to do the exact
same thing to you.

290
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,155
So...

291
00:22:04,614 --> 00:22:06,033
don't touch her.

292
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:15,792
By the way,

293
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:19,838
you should take the elevator
for executives in the future.

294
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:22,632
You're only making your employees
feel uncomfortable.

295
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:49,242
Bong-hui, let me explain what happened.

296
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:51,119
Don't ever meddle in my business again.

297
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:54,539
How is that just your business?
It's mine too.

298
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:55,707
It's mine,

299
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:58,668
but it also became yours
because you decided to interfere.

300
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:01,713
So this ends now.

301
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:04,466
-You're mistaken.
-No, I'm not.

302
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:10,555
You are.

303
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:13,141
Even if we were strangers,

304
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,727
this still would have been something
I should care about and solve.

305
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:17,729
You already suffered a loss by doing that.

306
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:20,440
You lost your job as a prosecutor
and quit the law firm.

307
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:23,568
What more can you go through?
Do you enjoy suffering?

308
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,702
You're right.

309
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:35,997
But regardless of what happened,

310
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:39,167
it was a choice I made for myself.
None of it was your fault.

311
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:47,926
Now that I think of it,
you might be right.

312
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:52,347
About us being...

313
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:56,101
in an ill-fated relationship.

314
00:23:58,436 --> 00:24:00,230
-Bong-hui, I didn't mean...
-This is a warning.

315
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:02,524
I'm really angry.

316
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:05,861
Just like how I respect
and listen to what you say to me,

317
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:07,821
I ask that

318
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:11,074
you respect and comply
with my wishes as well.

319
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:42,063
I can't stop having feelings for him.

320
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:45,775
This is too difficult.

321
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,616
I'm not really fit for this.

322
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:17,599
All right. Why don't all of us go home
on time for once?

323
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:21,311
Just like I said before,
I will treat everyone dinner today.

324
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:24,606
No.

325
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:27,901
Everyone is still hung over,
and it's a mess.

326
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:29,444
Everyone isn't feeling well today.

327
00:25:38,411 --> 00:25:39,454
I thought so.

328
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:50,382
You guys...

329
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:52,550
ate the whole cake
without asking me first.

330
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:02,310
I'm going to catch you!

331
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,723
Happy birthday,

332
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:41,766
Eun-hyeok.

333
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:48,106
Let's see.

334
00:26:58,908 --> 00:26:59,909
Yu-jeong.

335
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:01,244
Happy birthday.

336
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:09,044
Three of us used to come here often.

337
00:27:09,627 --> 00:27:12,505
So I accidentally stopped by here.

338
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:14,632
When I was passing by,
I saw you by chance.

339
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:18,762
I'll just move along by chance.

340
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:28,480
Why don't I do this?

341
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:30,899
Can I sit here by any chance?

342
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:32,984
My legs hurt.

343
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:35,320
No.

344
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,657
I said you can't.

345
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:40,909
I got it.

346
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:09,062
Hey, Eun-hyeok,

347
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:10,855
Happy Birthday.

348
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:23,785
Mr. Ji,

349
00:28:24,327 --> 00:28:25,495
Happy Birthday.

350
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:48,727
Goodness.

351
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:49,811
H...

352
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:51,146
Oh, fuck!

353
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:52,772
-Sorry?
-What?

354
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:55,608
That wasn't directed at you, Bong-hui.

355
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:58,778
I don't care even if it was meant for me.

356
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:00,447
Hey...

357
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:06,745
MY JI-UK

358
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:10,081
H...

359
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:14,502
This is

360
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,755
what I told Ji-uk.

361
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:19,883
I told him that I left

362
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:21,676
because his love wasn't enough.

363
00:29:22,218 --> 00:29:23,803
-What?
-I know.

364
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:26,306
I regret what I said.

365
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,893
There's no point in regretting it.

366
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:31,603
You already said it.

367
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:33,229
You can't take back what you said.

368
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:37,108
You're right. It was my fault.

369
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:41,237
But I wished you guys
didn't hate me this much.

370
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:43,948
Do you hate me that much?

371
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:47,869
Yes.

372
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:54,250
Whom...

373
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:57,337
do you hate the most in this world?

374
00:29:58,171 --> 00:29:59,422
Is it among one of us?

375
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,301
I...

376
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:08,389
really hate this person.

377
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:11,726
I really do.

378
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:16,481
But despite my hatred...

379
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:20,985
I have a person...

380
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:25,532
whom I can't dislike nor hate.

381
00:30:31,412 --> 00:30:32,413
I don't like you.

382
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:49,514
You jerk.

383
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:51,558
Happy Birthday.

384
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:19,502
What are you doing?

385
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:21,713
Hey.

386
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:25,842
What happened?

387
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:29,470
You barely make mistakes.

388
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:32,348
Why were there my footprints

389
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:35,393
and a button which I didn't
even leave behind?

390
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:37,979
-Why?
-I don't know either.

391
00:31:38,771 --> 00:31:41,024
I think I must have been flustered
and made a mistake.

392
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:43,526
A mistake?

393
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:47,864
A mistake?

394
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:54,203
I get it. Anyone can make a mistake.

395
00:31:54,495 --> 00:31:55,455
Hey.

396
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:57,040
Just once.

397
00:31:57,665 --> 00:31:59,417
-They can make only one mistake.
-But...

398
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,628
But what? What is it?

399
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:02,921
It's nothing.

400
00:32:03,212 --> 00:32:05,173
-It's nothing?
-Yes, it's nothing.

401
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:09,344
If this ever happens again,
it won't be considered as a mistake.

402
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:11,179
It will be your intention to betray,

403
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:14,140
fool, and stab me in the back.

404
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,477
Then what should I do now?

405
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:19,938
Hey.

406
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:22,148
Hey, look at me.

407
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:24,817
Look at me.

408
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:34,410
We need to continue what we've been doing.

409
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:36,120
Right?

410
00:32:37,872 --> 00:32:39,415
Three people have disappeared,

411
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,251
and four people will disappear.

412
00:32:43,544 --> 00:32:45,254
Help me out until then.

413
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:50,301
That's the only way you'll pay
for your mistake, Chan-ho. Right?

414
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:52,512
Do you agree with me or not?

415
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:55,932
What was that, you punk?

416
00:32:56,933 --> 00:32:58,226
My gosh.

417
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:02,021
Get going. Bye.

418
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,279
I guess he can't fall asleep again.

419
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:26,230
Mr. Bang, can I have the files?

420
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:27,774
You mean these files?

421
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:29,859
Thank you.

422
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:02,975
I think staying as it is now
isn't that bad.

423
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:06,395
I've gotten used to seeing him
as only my boss.

424
00:35:08,397 --> 00:35:09,524
I'm glad.

425
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:13,611
I ended my one-sided love as well.

426
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:15,780
-You ended it?
-Yes.

427
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,658
I won't like him anymore.
I will just be his fan.

428
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:21,619
You know how the celebrities
have a fan club?

429
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:23,579
It's similar to that.
I will like him as a fan.

430
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:25,623
How is that different from having a crush?

431
00:35:25,998 --> 00:35:28,292
It's different. I don't have
any expectation.

432
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:31,629
No, as a fan, I can't expect
anything from him.

433
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:34,132
I just admire him.

434
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:37,343
Well, I can understand that.

435
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:42,265
I'm not joking. I think
I really have put an end...

436
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:45,434
to loving him in a romantic way.

437
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:46,936
I am...

438
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:49,355
about 98 percent over him.

439
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,109
I think I'll love him...

440
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:55,736
until the day I die.

441
00:36:02,785 --> 00:36:04,328
If that's the case,

442
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:06,789
shall I help you?

443
00:36:07,373 --> 00:36:08,374
Help me what?

444
00:36:10,084 --> 00:36:12,336
No one knows better than I am

445
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,547
how it feels to just admire someone.

446
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:17,466
That's a bit sad.

447
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:19,051
Isn't it?

448
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:21,554
Then...

449
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:23,389
come a little closer.

450
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,642
Sorry?

451
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:31,939
Then start laughing.

452
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:33,316
-Laugh?
-Yes.

453
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:35,401
There's a reason for it. Hurry.

454
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:37,278
Laugh.

455
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:39,572
What is this? Just like this?

456
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:41,490
What about you?

457
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:46,329
-Come closer.
-This is a bit weird.

458
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:47,413
Laugh.

459
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:05,348
Good job. You ought to act your age now.

460
00:37:08,684 --> 00:37:09,769
What on earth is this?

461
00:37:12,146 --> 00:37:13,189
Darn it.

462
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:27,578
Hey! Hey, you jerks.

463
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:32,708
Why am I doing the dishes here
day in day out?

464
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:35,169
You should win the Ghost Leg game then.

465
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:39,465
I won't play that game ever again.
You got that, punks?

466
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:41,467
Where are you meeting Jung Hyeon-su?

467
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:43,636
I'm going to meet him in his neighborhood.

468
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:50,518
I couldn't find anything.

469
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:53,062
Just like he said,
he doesn't have any family members.

470
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:54,563
He doesn't have any acquaintances.

471
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:59,694
Then can you check if anyone
from his deceased

472
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:02,488
family members or acquaintances
was a victim of a crime?

473
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:04,031
Yes, sir.

474
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:33,728
You quit your job?

475
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:34,979
Yes.

476
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:38,441
I was on a contract anyway,

477
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:41,027
and I was held
in the detention center too.

478
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:44,655
I understand what you went through
and how you must have felt.

479
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:47,158
I think I could be of help to you.

480
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:50,661
No, that's all right.
I can't be a hassle to you anymore.

481
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:52,830
I didn't get to pay you a lot
for the legal fee.

482
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:55,333
But I'll buy you meals from time to time
to make up for it.

483
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,918
All right then. I will let you
buy me meals from time to time.

484
00:38:58,669 --> 00:38:59,962
I will buy you meals too.

485
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:11,682
Mr. Noh.

486
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:16,437
Oh, my goodness.

487
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,607
How can this...

488
00:39:20,274 --> 00:39:23,694
What are the chances of meeting you here?

489
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:32,370
Call me if you need help anytime.

490
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:33,454
Don't mind if I do.

491
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:35,581
Please do. Don't be a stranger.

492
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:38,626
-I'll get going then.
-Bye.

493
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:39,710
Take care now.

494
00:39:44,256 --> 00:39:45,341
Mr. Noh.

495
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:49,512
What are you trying to pull?

496
00:39:49,595 --> 00:39:50,971
What do you mean? What?

497
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:53,349
This is all but a coincidence.

498
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:54,433
As if.

499
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:57,686
All right. I followed you here. So what?

500
00:39:57,770 --> 00:40:00,022
-Why did you follow me?
-It's because

501
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:01,357
I just wanted to.

502
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,278
Tell me what you are not telling me.

503
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:09,532
Tell me what you and Mr. Bang
are keeping from me

504
00:40:09,615 --> 00:40:11,784
and what is wrong with Jung Hyeon-su.

505
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:14,537
What are your suspicions?

506
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:22,837
Family?

507
00:40:24,171 --> 00:40:25,840
I don't have a family.

508
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:28,551
Everyone in my family left
for some reason.

509
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:31,512
Oh, right. Do you have a girlfriend?

510
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:34,265
A girlfriend? I don't have a girlfriend.

511
00:40:34,348 --> 00:40:35,474
-I see.
-Why?

512
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:36,976
Will you introduce a girl to me?

513
00:40:37,309 --> 00:40:39,437
You know how people

514
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:41,856
ask questions about your personal life

515
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:45,860
when they want to be friends with you.

516
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:50,281
How can this...

517
00:40:51,323 --> 00:40:54,785
What are the chances of meeting you here?

518
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:21,812
Mr. Noh?

519
00:41:23,355 --> 00:41:24,356
Yes.

520
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:27,860
So...

521
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:31,572
it's only a bad hunch now.

522
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:32,781
On what grounds?

523
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:35,659
His alibi is...

524
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:38,579
Answer it.

525
00:41:40,372 --> 00:41:41,373
I'm sorry.

526
00:41:43,375 --> 00:41:44,376
Yes, Mom.

527
00:41:45,377 --> 00:41:46,462
I'm going now.

528
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:50,174
Okay. I got it.

529
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:55,304
I had plans with my Mom.
You said something about his alibi.

530
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,890
No, it's all right.
Let's talk when you get back.

531
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:00,476
Let's do that then.

532
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:02,394
I'll get going now.

533
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,530
Come on.

534
00:42:23,457 --> 00:42:24,500
My firm's CEO?

535
00:42:25,292 --> 00:42:26,418
He's awesome.

536
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:28,921
Is he handsome? Is he single?

537
00:42:29,004 --> 00:42:30,506
Does he have a girlfriend?

538
00:42:30,589 --> 00:42:33,008
-He's handsome.
-Really?

539
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:37,012
He has broad shoulders,
and he is very understanding.

540
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:39,598
His eyes gleam like stars.

541
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:41,433
On the back of his head,
there's a light bulb.

542
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:42,726
A light bulb?

543
00:42:43,143 --> 00:42:45,020
A halo. Like a light.

544
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:46,397
It shines like this.

545
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,983
Goodness, you are giving me goosebumps.

546
00:42:49,191 --> 00:42:51,026
You are being so childish now.
It's too much.

547
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:52,778
Gosh, she's making me want to vomit.

548
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:56,156
I think he was born to give me
a heart attack.

549
00:42:57,825 --> 00:42:58,826
Bong-hui.

550
00:42:59,702 --> 00:43:01,620
He makes my heart beat irregularly
every single time.

551
00:43:02,871 --> 00:43:04,707
I turn into a little girl
every single time.

552
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:12,464
But he rejected me.

553
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:14,008
Why?

554
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:17,011
That's just how it ended.

555
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:21,473
So are you going to give up?

556
00:43:22,057 --> 00:43:23,976
Do you think you'll be able
to meet another person

557
00:43:24,476 --> 00:43:26,270
you can like that much?

558
00:43:28,772 --> 00:43:29,815
You don't think I can?

559
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:38,699
She's head over heels for him.

560
00:43:39,783 --> 00:43:41,577
A guy like that doesn't exist.

561
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:45,831
Except for my son.

562
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:48,626
Son!

563
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:54,840
Son!

564
00:43:57,176 --> 00:44:00,679
I could've met you inside.
Why did you want to meet here?

565
00:44:00,763 --> 00:44:02,973
There are some weird women inside.

566
00:44:03,098 --> 00:44:05,434
Even just one of them is scary enough.
When they're together,

567
00:44:05,517 --> 00:44:06,644
they really scare me.

568
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:08,812
What kind of women are they?

569
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:11,523
I was getting a bit of cabin fever inside.

570
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:14,860
I get to lock arms with you
and see your face like this.

571
00:44:14,943 --> 00:44:15,986
It's so nice.

572
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:19,657
My goodness.

573
00:44:20,032 --> 00:44:21,784
You've lost weight.

574
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:23,535
Did something happen?

575
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:24,745
Has work been very stressful?

576
00:44:25,412 --> 00:44:27,039
No, I'm fine.

577
00:44:29,249 --> 00:44:32,044
I rarely get to see you these days.

578
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:34,963
I'm sorry I couldn't visit you often.

579
00:44:37,132 --> 00:44:38,967
I'm so fascinated from time to time.

580
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,470
When did you grow up like this?

581
00:44:42,721 --> 00:44:43,764
I know, right?

582
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,059
It seems like only yesterday
that you were crying in my arms

583
00:44:47,142 --> 00:44:48,727
because you couldn't fall asleep.

584
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:51,855
It's okay.

585
00:44:52,481 --> 00:44:53,982
It's all right, Ji-uk.

586
00:44:56,068 --> 00:44:57,778
I won't go anywhere.

587
00:44:58,779 --> 00:44:59,947
I'm right here for you.

588
00:45:00,906 --> 00:45:01,990
I'll never leave you.

589
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:05,452
I'll never disappear.

590
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:07,996
I'll always stay right by your side.

591
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:13,836
Sleep tight.

592
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:16,547
Sleep tight.

593
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:19,007
You've grown so much, son.

594
00:45:20,342 --> 00:45:21,343
No.

595
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:25,097
-I don't feel like I've grown at all.
-Why not?

596
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:27,141
Just because...

597
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:30,477
I'm a coward.

598
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:33,021
Gosh, no way.

599
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:34,982
You should get back to work.

600
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:37,359
I guess you're busy.

601
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:39,820
All right. See you.

602
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:41,196
Let's have a meal next time.

603
00:45:42,281 --> 00:45:43,282
Promise!

604
00:46:14,563 --> 00:46:15,564
It must be...

605
00:46:17,024 --> 00:46:18,275
related in some way.

606
00:46:31,914 --> 00:46:35,709
There's also no specific evidence to prove
that the defendant committed murder.

607
00:46:37,085 --> 00:46:39,671
Therefore, the defendant
also can't be accused of murder.

608
00:46:39,796 --> 00:46:40,714
That is all, Your Honor.

609
00:47:12,955 --> 00:47:14,039
Oh, hello.

610
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:16,708
What brings you here?

611
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:20,170
Are you here to ask me
for another personal favor?

612
00:47:20,629 --> 00:47:22,923
No, I'm just... Well...

613
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:24,925
There's something I'm curious about.

614
00:47:26,927 --> 00:47:27,844
What is it?

615
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:29,096
By any chance...

616
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:31,890
did you know Chef Yang Jin-wu personally?

617
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:38,272
-No.
-Then you must know Jung Hyeon-su.

618
00:47:39,398 --> 00:47:40,566
No, I don't.

619
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:43,193
Then why did you attend
every trial of his?

620
00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:47,489
I had to attend another trial
as a witness.

621
00:47:47,573 --> 00:47:49,032
As an investigator, I have to sometimes.

622
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:50,826
I can just do a quick check

623
00:47:50,909 --> 00:47:52,703
to find out whether that's true or not.

624
00:47:55,205 --> 00:47:58,083
At first, I just wondered
if you knew Jung Hyeon-su

625
00:47:58,208 --> 00:48:01,211
or Yang Jin-wu personally.

626
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:02,504
I was hoping...

627
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:06,174
that you'd just be
an acquaintance of one of them.

628
00:48:13,515 --> 00:48:15,309
But now I'm certain
that there's something.

629
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:18,478
Call me anytime.

630
00:48:18,812 --> 00:48:20,230
I'll help you if there's anything

631
00:48:20,314 --> 00:48:21,481
I can do for you.

632
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:24,776
I'll wait for your call.

633
00:48:38,874 --> 00:48:42,419
JUNG TRANSFERED TO PROSECUTION
FOR MURDER BY A ROBBER

634
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:04,232
AFFIDAVIT

635
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:11,365
If Jung Hyeon-su...

636
00:49:12,407 --> 00:49:14,368
really killed Yang Jin-wu,

637
00:49:15,243 --> 00:49:17,204
there has to be a motive.

638
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:31,301
Yes, Noh Ji-uk speaking.

639
00:49:31,718 --> 00:49:32,719
It's me.

640
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:34,971
You were looking for something.

641
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:37,933
The frame that was missing
from Chef Yang's house.

642
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:39,768
We found it.

643
00:49:40,102 --> 00:49:41,978
We seized and searched
Professor Yang's house.

644
00:49:44,356 --> 00:49:45,399
Will you come and see it?

645
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:48,110
Can you...

646
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:50,237
send it to me?

647
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:52,406
You know that it can't get out.

648
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:53,907
It's evidence.

649
00:49:54,616 --> 00:49:57,077
Come and see it if you still need to.

650
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,248
I'll be there.

651
00:50:22,561 --> 00:50:24,771
PROSECUTOR CHA YU-JEONG

652
00:50:37,033 --> 00:50:38,076
Hey, you came.

653
00:50:38,952 --> 00:50:39,953
Yes.

654
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:41,538
Let me see the photo first.

655
00:50:43,248 --> 00:50:44,249
Okay.

656
00:50:54,176 --> 00:50:55,427
It's a verse from the bible.

657
00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:56,887
DEUTERONOMY 22:25

658
00:50:59,848 --> 00:51:01,016
And I found this.

659
00:51:02,184 --> 00:51:04,978
IF A MAN RAPES HER, ONLY THE MAN SHALL DIE
DEUTERONOMY 22:25

660
00:51:06,855 --> 00:51:07,856
This is...

661
00:51:09,107 --> 00:51:10,901
Was it an act of revenge, then?

662
00:51:11,151 --> 00:51:12,152
Probably.

663
00:51:45,227 --> 00:51:46,937
Hello, it's been a long time.

664
00:51:47,979 --> 00:51:49,356
There's something I need to tell you.

665
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:50,524
Me?

666
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:55,612
By any chance, have you
found out something?

667
00:51:56,696 --> 00:51:57,697
Yes.

668
00:51:57,989 --> 00:51:59,241
Really? What is it?

669
00:52:00,992 --> 00:52:02,410
I know...

670
00:52:05,121 --> 00:52:06,289
who bought you the shoes.

671
00:52:08,083 --> 00:52:09,960
Who is it?

672
00:52:12,003 --> 00:52:14,297
Okay. I'll leave right now.

673
00:52:34,651 --> 00:52:36,027
LAWYER NOH JI-UK

674
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:42,450
This is what we got from the frame.

675
00:52:43,201 --> 00:52:44,619
Nothing was found, right?

676
00:52:44,911 --> 00:52:46,079
Sadly, yes.

677
00:52:50,041 --> 00:52:51,293
DNA ANALYSIS REPORT

678
00:52:56,298 --> 00:53:00,176
The number you have dialed
cannot be reached at the moment.

679
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:02,053
Please leave a message after the tone.

680
00:53:08,143 --> 00:53:09,352
FINGERPRINT ANALYSIS REPORT

681
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:17,527
-You're just going to leave?
-Yes.

682
00:53:19,738 --> 00:53:21,823
Thanks for letting me see this. Bye.

683
00:53:39,758 --> 00:53:42,344
BONG-HUI: I'M ON MY WAY TO HANMU PARK
TO MEET GO CHAN-HO

684
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:20,548
LAWYER NOH JI-UK

685
00:55:17,272 --> 00:55:18,314
Hey, Hyeon-su.

686
00:55:18,606 --> 00:55:19,607
Where are you, Chan-ho?

687
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:23,278
Well, I came outside for a bit.

688
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:24,904
I see.

689
00:55:25,697 --> 00:55:27,532
This place is so huge and dark.

690
00:55:27,615 --> 00:55:29,325
I called because I had trouble
finding you.

691
00:55:30,285 --> 00:55:31,369
I think I found you now.

692
00:55:35,582 --> 00:55:36,624
Gosh.

693
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:38,668
There you are.

694
00:56:11,493 --> 00:56:12,660
My gosh.

695
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:15,246
You startled me.

696
00:56:15,705 --> 00:56:17,749
I thought I was going to have
a heart attack.

697
00:56:24,964 --> 00:56:26,382
I'm the one who should be saying that.

698
00:56:34,766 --> 00:56:38,645
Bong-hui, are you out of your mind?

699
00:56:39,437 --> 00:56:41,523
How could you
come to a place like this by yourself?

700
00:56:42,941 --> 00:56:45,610
Even if you could be thoughtless
at times, this is just too much.

701
00:56:46,027 --> 00:56:48,196
You should know better
after going through so much.

702
00:56:51,116 --> 00:56:52,117
What if...

703
00:56:52,617 --> 00:56:55,662
What if something happened to you?
What were you going to do?

704
00:56:55,954 --> 00:56:57,247
What would you have done?

705
00:56:58,123 --> 00:56:59,124
And what about me?

706
00:56:59,791 --> 00:57:01,167
What could I have done?

707
00:57:09,759 --> 00:57:11,553
My gosh, Bong-hui.

708
00:57:13,054 --> 00:57:14,430
You're troublesome.

709
00:57:15,223 --> 00:57:17,100
You're a nuisance. Do you know that?

710
00:57:18,935 --> 00:57:20,311
Then what was I supposed to do?

711
00:57:21,479 --> 00:57:24,399
He called me over urgently,
and you weren't picking up your phone.

712
00:57:24,482 --> 00:57:25,859
You should've waited for me.

713
00:57:25,942 --> 00:57:29,112
I did wait for you.
I was going to go by myself,

714
00:57:29,696 --> 00:57:31,823
but it felt so wrong.

715
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:36,244
It felt like something could happen,
and I thought you might scold me.

716
00:57:37,996 --> 00:57:39,289
Most of all,

717
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:41,332
I was scared.

718
00:57:42,417 --> 00:57:44,544
So I walked back here
on my way inside the park.

719
00:57:44,711 --> 00:57:46,796
I came back and waited for you here.

720
00:58:37,472 --> 00:58:38,473
I'm sorry.

721
00:58:41,476 --> 00:58:42,602
Do you mean it?

722
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:46,189
Yes, I do.

723
00:58:49,609 --> 00:58:51,444
Let's see if you're telling the truth.

724
00:59:00,578 --> 00:59:01,663
You are telling the truth.

725
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:55,133
Mr. Noh.

726
01:00:46,893 --> 01:00:48,978
