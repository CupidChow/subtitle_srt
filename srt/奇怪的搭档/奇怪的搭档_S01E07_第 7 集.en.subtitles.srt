1
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:52,761
I thought you might not come home.

2
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:02,520
I really didn't mean to confess my love.

3
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,105
I like you.

4
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:09,694
I like you, Mr. Noh.

5
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:33,301
Don't...

6
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:37,555
fall for me.

7
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:06,835
Why not?

8
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:11,756
Do you...

9
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:16,094
No.

10
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:24,769
There are so many things...

11
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:29,941
I want to ask you.

12
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:35,822
But...

13
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:41,452
you won't answer my questions, right?

14
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:44,956
Will I...

15
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:47,584
regret this moment?

16
00:02:58,803 --> 00:03:01,347
I'm starting to regret
confessing my love to you.

17
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:05,643
Will I regret stopping myself
because I'm scared to start

18
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:08,354
a new relationship?

19
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:14,777
But I don't regret liking you.

20
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:29,250
Can I ask you for a favor?

21
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:35,340
Let me...

22
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:38,009
hug you one more time.

23
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:43,514
Can't you at least allow me to do that?

24
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:46,476
Since I have to end this one-sided love--

25
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:25,843
What...

26
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:28,137
Well...

27
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:32,225
I slept so much that my eyes got swollen.

28
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,602
Ice-cold spoons are the cure
for swollen eyes.

29
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:39,524
Cold towel.

30
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:42,360
I'll soak a towel in cold water for you.

31
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:45,905
Don't do that.

32
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:50,576
You told me not to like you.

33
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:53,329
Then you shouldn't be so nice to me.

34
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,289
You have to help me out.

35
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:58,543
Right.

36
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:03,923
I always listen to you so well.

37
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:07,552
So I'm trying my best to not like you.

38
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:12,974
But if you keep being nice like this,

39
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:15,351
it'll be hard for me.

40
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:17,061
I'll get the wrong idea.

41
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:19,939
Okay.

42
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:24,861
I'm...

43
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:27,780
going to reset myself

44
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:30,158
to back when I didn't like you.

45
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:31,826
Back to when you were my mentor.

46
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,330
So...

47
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:39,083
don't do this.

48
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:52,680
Okay, fine.

49
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:54,432
I'll do as you say.

50
00:07:58,728 --> 00:07:59,770
Are you going to stay here?

51
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:07,612
No.

52
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,167
My gosh.

53
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:33,763
What is all this?

54
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:38,726
I used what I had in the fridge
to make these,

55
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,103
so the dishes

56
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:42,522
are quite random.

57
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,023
Do you have insomnia again?

58
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:45,149
Is it a special day today?

59
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:46,275
I know what this is.

60
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,153
You two.

61
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:50,863
What do you think you're doing?

62
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:53,449
Last night,

63
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,702
I finished work a bit late.

64
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:01,832
That's when I saw it.

65
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:04,877
Look at those two.

66
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:07,672
I saw you guys hugging each other.

67
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:12,802
-You must be mistaken.
-Yes.

68
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:14,971
-What? What?
-That can happen when you're old.

69
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:17,306
I saw it with my own eyes.

70
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,432
Ji-uk, say something.

71
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:19,600
You two were definitely--

72
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:21,435
If Bong-hui says you're wrong,
I guess you are.

73
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,438
Don't try to fool me.

74
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:27,441
I'm sure there's something
going on between you two.

75
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:29,193
-No, there's nothing going on.
-Nothing.

76
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:30,444
Nothing between us.

77
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:33,030
Really?

78
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:35,992
Then was I really mistaken?

79
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,410
-Yes.
-Yes.

80
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:42,373
Hey, should I get my eyes checked?

81
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:44,375
You little...

82
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:46,460
I had breakfast already,

83
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:48,087
but I'll have it again. Thank you.

84
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,172
Mr. Byeon.

85
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:52,174
It's okay. Everything will be fine.

86
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,426
Your eyes will get better.

87
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:01,892
As you can see, it's a murder by a robber.

88
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:05,104
The prosecution charged Jung Hyeon-su
for the murder by a robber.

89
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:07,523
The evidence is the witness
living across from the victim,

90
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:09,150
Jung's footprint,

91
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:11,694
and the button
that fell off from his shirt.

92
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,488
He even has a criminal intent.

93
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:17,408
Jung Hyeon-su's lease contract
was soon to be terminated.

94
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:19,118
The lease deposit money is expensive.

95
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:20,953
-Right.
-I guess he needed money.

96
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:22,705
Jung Hyeon-su's criminal record?

97
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:27,126
He got into a minor assault incident
while he was trying to

98
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:28,628
save a woman from danger.

99
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:30,046
But

100
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:31,422
what happened to the weapon?

101
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:32,590
It disappeared.

102
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,966
The autopsy results

103
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:37,136
says it must be a knife that's around
13cm in length and 3.5cm in width.

104
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:41,098
There's no direct evidence to prove
that Jung Hyeon-su is the murderer.

105
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:43,643
But there's no evidence
to prove that he's not either.

106
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:45,895
I'll find his alibi.

107
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:48,898
I'm going to look for that couple
who was at the bar

108
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:51,651
with Jung Hyeon-su
on the day of the incident.

109
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,445
I'm looking for the couple
in this picture.

110
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:55,946
It's a very important matter.

111
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:57,490
Please call me at this number.

112
00:10:57,615 --> 00:11:00,117
I left my phone number at the bar.
I'm sure I'll get a call.

113
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:02,203
Jung Hyeon-su is the culprit.

114
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:03,454
I'm sure of it.

115
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:18,469
With that naive face of his,

116
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:19,970
he was mocking

117
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:21,555
me and the law.

118
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:23,599
I don't care about that,

119
00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:25,810
but I must win this case
because I'm going against Bong-hui.

120
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:28,521
Anyway, don't overwork yourself.

121
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:29,730
You were really sick.

122
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,233
I'm all better now.
What's the use of being sick?

123
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:35,152
I don't have a guy to take care of me.
It's all useless.

124
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:36,237
I agree.

125
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:39,532
No good comes from being sick.
We should always stay healthy.

126
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:19,363
What are you doing, Ms. Eun?

127
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:20,781
I'm drying off.

128
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:22,700
What?

129
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:30,791
Do you want me
to keep talking to you or not?

130
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,377
Gently, please.

131
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:35,671
Talk to me gently, please.

132
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:40,634
My whole body is filled with water
right now.

133
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:43,762
If you accidentally poke me,
I might burst.

134
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:47,933
I hope you dry yourself well.

135
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:52,688
I just need to make sure
I don't cry in front of Mr. Noh.

136
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,024
I can do that much, right?

137
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:01,071
Would you like to cry your eyes out
in advance?

138
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:03,574
Should I do that?

139
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:11,165
I think I'm done for.

140
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:28,849
Excuse me.

141
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:30,017
Yes?

142
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:32,520
What happened between you and Ms. Eun?

143
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:34,396
Mr. Byeon...

144
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:36,524
saw you hugging each other.

145
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,651
Then you guys were so cold
around each other this morning.

146
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:40,778
Excuse me, but since
I'm working with both of you,

147
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:42,821
I need to know what's going on.

148
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,911
You said there weren't any CCTVs
in the alley, right?

149
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:51,038
At least get me a CCTV footage
of the nearby road.

150
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:53,374
And try to find out if there were
any dashboard cameras nearby.

151
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:56,252
I also need every single information
on Chef Yang's restaurant.

152
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,754
Including the list of employees,
I want to know about his reputation,

153
00:13:58,837 --> 00:14:00,005
rumors, and every other detail.

154
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:03,884
And don't forget to check
if the stolen material was found.

155
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:05,094
I'm not curious.

156
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,721
I don't have a single thing
I wish to know about you two.

157
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:09,723
I'm serious.

158
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:12,518
Okay, I think I'll need about that much.

159
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:14,770
I'm serious.

160
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:26,907
You might like him more
because you can't get him.

161
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,617
I wish I could just be okay.

162
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:30,870
Of course. If things turn out
how we wanted them to,

163
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:33,038
life would be so much easier.

164
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:36,500
Why are you guys slacking off?

165
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,002
Sorry, Ji-uk.

166
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:40,462
Are you going somewhere?

167
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:43,549
-I'm going on a field investigation.
-I'll go with you.

168
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,926
Hurry, or I'll leave without you.

169
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:50,139
Good luck.

170
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:53,017
Get a grip.

171
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:55,769
You can do it.
It's best to forget about him.

172
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:56,812
Right?

173
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,022
Good luck.

174
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,941
-Good luck.
-Good luck.

175
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:13,871
But doing your best doesn't mean
you can change your mind.

176
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:24,214
Get a grip.

177
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,718
Gosh, that hurts.

178
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:39,772
I don't think there's any here.

179
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:49,782
Nothing was visible because someone
sprayed spray paint over it.

180
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:52,159
This one is out.

181
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,669
This one was turned off
because it's broken.

182
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:12,471
Is this where the prosecution's evidence
is from?

183
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:14,598
I don't think I've seen that one.

184
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:17,101
Okay. Check it
and get the footage from it.

185
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:27,277
I didn't think you'd work this hard.

186
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,905
I must prove
that Jung Hyeon-su is not guilty

187
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,615
in order for myself
to understand this case.

188
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:35,452
Well, don't get the wrong idea.
I'm doing this for myself.

189
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:40,499
All right, Bong-hui. Go.

190
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,377
-Pardon?
-Relax and get in there.

191
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:45,087
Yes.

192
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:11,363
Good. Underlings have to take care of
these things.

193
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:13,365
Yes, sir.

194
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:02,873
Something definitely seems off.

195
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:05,626
It's so odd.

196
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:12,216
What's so odd?

197
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:24,394
Why do you think
he took the framed painting?

198
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:31,568
By the way,

199
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:33,695
we are committing trespassing, aren't we?

200
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:36,573
Plus, we're illegally
searching the property.

201
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:39,785
Come on.

202
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:50,712
I can't get arrested again.
I'm still traumatized from last time.

203
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:53,423
Right. That's understandable.

204
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:07,312
What's this? It's you guys?

205
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:10,107
-Let go.
-You let go first.

206
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,988
Goodness. Stop it already.
Both of you should let go.

207
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,240
We're...

208
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:24,538
We're here to inspect the scene
as Mr. Jung's lawyers.

209
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:27,708
Good luck. Let's go, Bong-hui.

210
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:29,168
Shall we?

211
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:31,003
Stop right there, Ji-uk.

212
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:36,675
Let's talk for just ten minutes.
Bong-hui, you can leave.

213
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:37,968
Pardon?

214
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:42,097
If you guys leave,
I'll get a warrant for your arrest.

215
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:44,933
Just Bong-hui alone.

216
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:46,268
Sorry?

217
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:48,353
Why only me?

218
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:49,980
It's up to me.

219
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:52,983
What do you say?
Shall I request for a warrant?

220
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,611
-I just need ten minutes.
-Make it five.

221
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,029
All right.

222
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:41,698
You still visit the scenes
even though you're a lawyer now.

223
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:43,533
Yeah. You're working pretty hard yourself.

224
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:44,910
You taught me all this.

225
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:48,247
As a prosecutor,
you had more experience than me.

226
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:51,875
You taught me not to sit behind the desk
and inspecting scenes

227
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:54,670
-and how to interrogate.
-Your five minutes are almost up.

228
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:59,216
You must know Jung Hyeon-su has been
previously convicted of assault.

229
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:00,467
Yes.

230
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:09,977
It's not just the face.

231
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:12,771
The victim got a few ribs broken
as he was beaten up to a pulp.

232
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:16,650
Had people not stopped him,

233
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:19,236
he would've killed the victim.

234
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:23,156
You used to catch criminals like him.

235
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:24,992
Why would you defend him?

236
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:34,501
Navy is a good color on you.

237
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:38,005
You were wearing a navy tie
the last time you came.

238
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:40,173
I think navy looks great on you.

239
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:41,758
Oh, did I?

240
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:44,428
Does it look okay? Does the color suit me?

241
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:47,431
I actually have heard that many times.

242
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:54,187
All right. Shall we get started?

243
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:58,400
Well, I did some research

244
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:01,111
and found out that... Gosh. You have...

245
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:05,198
beaten someone up to a pulp in the past.

246
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:06,742
Like this.

247
00:22:08,618 --> 00:22:11,913
So? Are you trying to say
that you think...

248
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:16,168
I killed Chef Yang
just because I have a criminal record?

249
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:18,879
No, no.
Not because of your criminal record.

250
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:19,963
It's just...

251
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:24,259
a feeling I'm getting.
I think you might have done it.

252
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:27,179
Mr. Jung.

253
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:31,058
People use the phrase,
"heat of the moment" a lot.

254
00:22:31,224 --> 00:22:34,144
It's used to refer to crimes
that are committed on impulse.

255
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:36,730
If you look at this... Gosh.

256
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:39,441
This wasn't a heat-of-a-moment case.

257
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:42,694
A will is needed for anyone
to beat up someone like this.

258
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:46,490
A murderous intent.

259
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:49,910
An urge to kill that person
or an intent to act on such urge.

260
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:53,622
-That kind of will.
-Right, I wanted to kill him.

261
00:22:58,293 --> 00:23:01,129
Have you ever seen anyone
close to you getting hurt?

262
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:03,799
I have.

263
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:06,218
I should've kept that person safe.

264
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:10,514
There was a kid whom I failed to protect.

265
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:12,557
That's when I had this thought.

266
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:15,519
Right. When I'm a little older

267
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:17,687
and have more power and ability,

268
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:22,150
I shouldn't let anyone fall victim
to such unfairness.

269
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:24,361
That's when I saw this jerk.

270
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:26,988
Have a look.

271
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:28,907
This scum.

272
00:23:40,293 --> 00:23:43,922
This jerk was assaulting a woman.

273
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:48,093
Do you think he had a reason for that?

274
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:52,222
Not at all. Like you just said,
it was a heat-of-the-moment thing.

275
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:55,559
He had no reason whatsoever.
He attacked her randomly,

276
00:23:55,642 --> 00:23:58,395
and I only did what I could do
to help her. Do you understand?

277
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,272
All right. Please calm down.

278
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:03,942
Well... Gosh, I can't get
these photos crinkled up like this.

279
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:06,444
Let's say that everything
you're telling me is true.

280
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:09,281
Yes, you're absolutely right. However...

281
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:15,579
You didn't do this to stop him.

282
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:18,206
You did this as a way of punishing him.

283
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:20,250
Am I wrong?

284
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:31,094
What's wrong with that?

285
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:39,895
Gosh, I'm sorry. My apologies.

286
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:42,939
I'm really sorry.

287
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:46,776
At the time, I was...

288
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:50,780
My gosh. I guess I lost it
for a few minutes.

289
00:24:51,364 --> 00:24:55,535
I was trying to do a good deed,

290
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:58,079
but I think I overdid it a little.
Aren't I right?

291
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:00,624
Gosh. I'm sorry, Mr. Noh.
I got too worked up.

292
00:25:00,707 --> 00:25:01,917
It's all right.

293
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:04,544
But there is one thing
I can say for certain.

294
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:06,922
It's that I didn't kill Chef Yang Jin-wu.

295
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:09,341
There's no reason
why I would do such a thing.

296
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:12,636
I don't hurt people without any reason.

297
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:15,388
I'm sorry.

298
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:42,207
Did something happen?

299
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,251
I...

300
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:48,797
really hate clients.

301
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:51,883
I really hate...

302
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:54,135
guilty clients.

303
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:56,930
But...

304
00:25:58,181 --> 00:25:59,891
I hate innocent clients even more.

305
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:03,395
I'm scared that I might not
be able to set them free.

306
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:09,192
Were you okay
when you were a prosecutor then?

307
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:12,654
Your dad

308
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:14,864
was always worried too.

309
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:18,326
He was worried that someone
he arrested today

310
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,203
might actually be innocent

311
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:22,664
and that someone he released today

312
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:24,874
might actually be guilty.

313
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,963
Dad went through the same thing.

314
00:26:32,048 --> 00:26:33,008
Cheers.

315
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:34,718
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

316
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:46,354
I should have liked Mr. Ji instead.

317
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:49,649
If only you were my type--

318
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:51,693
How awesome would that have been?

319
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:53,486
Thinking about it gives me the thrill.

320
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:56,364
Then I would not be in a one-sided love.

321
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:58,325
Our love would have been reciprocated.

322
00:26:58,408 --> 00:26:59,409
Reciprocated.

323
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:06,833
But why are you not my type?

324
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:08,543
No matter how many times I look at you,

325
00:27:08,626 --> 00:27:09,711
I don't have feelings for you.

326
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,963
None.

327
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:15,759
It's because Cupid is a shitty little...

328
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:18,094
a baby. That's the root of this problem.

329
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:19,929
It's because he can't shoot
his arrows right.

330
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:22,474
-That's exactly right.
-If a Korean archer was Cupid,

331
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:24,768
the success rate
would have been 100 percent.

332
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:28,146
You're right!

333
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:30,065
-Aren't I?
-You're right.

334
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:31,107
I'm right!

335
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:33,443
-It would have been perfect.
-He would've shot like this.

336
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:36,154
I've never thought about that.

337
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:43,536
It's Ji-uk.

338
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,830
Mr. Noh, you are here.

339
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:50,168
What are you all doing?

340
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:52,128
Why did you make her drink so much?

341
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:03,014
Ji-uk, don't worry.
I'll text you when I get home.

342
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:05,016
-I love you!
-Don't worry. I can go home.

343
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,518
Don't worry. I'm going.

344
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:07,936
I can go home.

345
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,481
That's it.

346
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:15,485
My everyday life is a struggle.

347
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:34,671
How can a girl black out...

348
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:37,549
every time she drinks?

349
00:28:53,481 --> 00:28:54,691
Here...

350
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:03,593
We're here.

351
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:06,095
All right.

352
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:10,934
Well...

353
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:13,853
This isn't my place.

354
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:16,314
Really? This is the address you gave me.

355
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:25,240
I'm sorry.

356
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:28,326
Please drop me off
at Royal Apartment in Seongsan-dong.

357
00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:29,452
Sure.

358
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:02,944
CASE REPORT ON THE MURDER OF YANG JIN-WU
SEOUL GANGSEO POLICE

359
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:24,173
Well, I asked you
for a bunch of documents.

360
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:27,176
I see that you only brought me
a few, Mr. Bang.

361
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:31,264
I didn't have time to go through
all the documents--

362
00:31:31,347 --> 00:31:33,349
Yet you had time to go out for drinks?

363
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:36,185
Please go through them all

364
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:38,479
and find everything related to Chef Yang.

365
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:41,024
Go look through his social media
or even his garbage bins.

366
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:43,568
And make sure to find out
what that painting was.

367
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:45,612
And about that restaurant...

368
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:52,577
Yes, you. You do it.

369
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:54,871
-Me?
-Yes, you. Go find it.

370
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:57,498
Why me? I'm already working on many cases.
I don't have time for that.

371
00:31:57,624 --> 00:32:00,376
Yet you also have time
to go out for drinks.

372
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:10,678
Check every frame of that footage
we got from the CCTV

373
00:32:10,803 --> 00:32:12,180
and show me everything you find.

374
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:13,431
What if I don't find anything?

375
00:32:13,514 --> 00:32:16,184
You have to find something no matter what.
You must find something!

376
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:18,519
Keep looking! Keep your eyes peeled
and bring me something.

377
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:19,604
Okay, I will.

378
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:25,777
You brought this case to our firm.

379
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:28,279
You also wanted to take on it,

380
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:31,783
so you should feel more responsible.

381
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:36,287
Got it.

382
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:42,585
You guys...

383
00:32:44,712 --> 00:32:46,631
must've joined this firm
to have drinks all the time.

384
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:09,612
I need to watch the footage
from the store, but it's on your laptop.

385
00:33:23,626 --> 00:33:24,460
NOH JI-UK

386
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:32,135
Thank you.

387
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:50,653
LAWYER JI EUN-HYEOK

388
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:07,670
Hello.

389
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:10,757
-I'm Lawyer Ji Eun-hyeok.
-Oh, hello.

390
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:13,509
I just need to ask you a quick question.

391
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:15,428
Wait, just a second. Excuse me.

392
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:16,804
Excuse me.

393
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:18,598
It must be heavy.

394
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:20,349
-It's fine.
-Let me help. It's okay.

395
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:22,018
Well, this is... Oh, boy.

396
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:24,228
Just five minutes.
Please spare me five minutes of your time.

397
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:28,066
My apologies. I'm not some weird guy.

398
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:31,319
There's not much trash today.

399
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:38,534
It turns out he was a scumbag.

400
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:40,286
Is that all?

401
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:41,662
No way.

402
00:34:41,954 --> 00:34:44,415
All right. When someone does
something bad,

403
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:47,627
there's a person
who just watches and patches it up.

404
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:48,961
It's the chef's sister.

405
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:50,463
Didn't she discover the body?

406
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:51,714
Her name is Yang Ji-yeon.

407
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:01,140
Wait.

408
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:02,767
LAWYER EUN BONG-HUI

409
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:10,191
Mr. Noh, I found him.

410
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:13,319
Let me see.

411
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:15,613
Look at this,

412
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:16,697
and this.

413
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:19,659
-Here.
-Hold on.

414
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:22,912
It's him.

415
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:24,914
Bong-hui, good job.

416
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:26,499
Good...

417
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:39,804
Good job.

418
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:49,939
These are the evidence
left at the scene of the murder

419
00:35:50,022 --> 00:35:51,983
proving the defendant was there.

420
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:53,276
FINGERPRINTS ANALYSIS RESULT

421
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,486
This is the button
found at the crime scene.

422
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:58,656
It's confirmed that the fingerprints
and DNA on this button match

423
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:01,284
to the suspect's fingerprints and DNA.

424
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,329
In addition, these are
the footprints found at the scene.

425
00:36:05,621 --> 00:36:08,457
Can you see them?
These footprints are also identical

426
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:11,711
to the footprints
from the defendant's sneakers, Your Honor.

427
00:36:13,629 --> 00:36:15,756
The button found at the crime scene

428
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,551
is indeed the button
that the defendant dropped.

429
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:19,760
However,

430
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:22,471
he dropped it on the day
before the murder,

431
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:24,473
which was May 19.

432
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:31,439
I can't deliver the package
without your signature.

433
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:32,732
I'm busy. Give it to me fast.

434
00:36:32,815 --> 00:36:34,525
-I'm sorry. Here you go.
-Okay.

435
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:36,527
Leave it there.

436
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:38,321
-Right here?
-Yes.

437
00:36:43,075 --> 00:36:44,327
Do you need some help?

438
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:46,287
-Can you lift it?
-Lift it?

439
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:49,415
Mr. Yang had something under the couch

440
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:52,335
and the defendant
could not turn away from him,

441
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:55,671
so he helped Yang Jin-wu and moved
the furniture together in his house.

442
00:36:55,755 --> 00:37:00,301
Presumably he might have dropped it
when he was helping him.

443
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:02,887
Your Honor, that is a mere assumption.

444
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:05,973
So is the claim that he dropped it
while he killed the victim

445
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:07,516
one the day of murder.

446
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:14,982
WITNESS

447
00:37:17,109 --> 00:37:21,614
You witnessed a man coming out
of the victim's house

448
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:24,325
on the day of murder, May 20
around 7:30 p.m.

449
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:27,453
Of course. I saw him.

450
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:29,997
Because I was looking out the window
the whole evening.

451
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,959
Could you point out who that man was?

452
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:35,878
Oh, he's right there.

453
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:41,717
That's all, Your Honor.

454
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:51,686
Witness,

455
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:54,563
how good is your eyesight?

456
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:55,898
I may be old,

457
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:58,985
but I have 20/20 vision.

458
00:37:59,068 --> 00:38:00,486
Your eyesight is great.

459
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:03,072
If so, can I ask you

460
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:05,783
to describe the scene
you witnessed in detail?

461
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:07,410
Describe?

462
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:12,331
Yes. For example, can you tell us
what the defendant was wearing?

463
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:14,709
I see. He was wearing a black outfit.

464
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:18,421
He wore black clothes, hat,
and even gloves although it was hot.

465
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:20,464
Didn't he have a bag with him?

466
00:38:20,589 --> 00:38:21,966
No, he didn't.

467
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,510
You remember it very clearly.

468
00:38:24,593 --> 00:38:28,431
I'm famous in my neighborhood
for having a good memory.

469
00:38:28,514 --> 00:38:31,559
I see. What about the man's physique?

470
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:34,562
Did he look fatter back then

471
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:35,938
like he was in a winter jacket?

472
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:38,691
No way. He was slim just like he is now.

473
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:43,904
Then how did he move
the valuables he supposedly stole?

474
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:53,748
According to the victim's family,

475
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:56,459
a laptop, gold bars, a trophy,

476
00:38:56,542 --> 00:39:00,046
a DSLR camera, lenses, expensive watches,

477
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:03,549
and a big painting were stolen.

478
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:08,929
This is a bag that I filled with
the items I've just mentioned.

479
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:12,475
All those items put together
will be as big as this bag.

480
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:15,978
On top of that, the big painting
didn't even fit in this bag.

481
00:39:16,812 --> 00:39:17,938
Yet...

482
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,651
the witness who have a perfect vision,

483
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:25,821
testified the defendant didn't have
any bag with him.

484
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:29,033
Seeing that he looked slim,
it implies that

485
00:39:29,408 --> 00:39:31,327
he didn't hide the valuables
under his clothes.

486
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:35,581
Your Honor,

487
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:38,125
please remember the fact

488
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:41,045
that the stolen valuables
from the victim's house

489
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:43,464
didn't resurface at all.

490
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:45,674
The defendant could have returned
to the scene.

491
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:49,970
It's possible he returned after the murder
to take the valuables.

492
00:39:54,141 --> 00:39:55,935
These are the photos of footprints

493
00:39:56,018 --> 00:39:58,854
that the prosecution claims
to belong to the defendant.

494
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:00,773
Following the prosecutor's logic,

495
00:40:00,856 --> 00:40:02,817
if the defendant did return to the scene,

496
00:40:03,275 --> 00:40:05,277
there should have been
duplicate footprints.

497
00:40:06,445 --> 00:40:07,488
Don't you agree?

498
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:20,918
STRATEGY TO REFUTE PROSECUTION

499
00:40:21,043 --> 00:40:24,713
You were the first person
to discover your brother,

500
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:29,009
Yang Jin-wu's body around 1 p.m.
the day after he was murdered.

501
00:40:29,176 --> 00:40:30,177
Is this true?

502
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:31,720
Yes, it's true.

503
00:40:32,054 --> 00:40:33,973
After the discovery,
you reported it to the police

504
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:36,267
and called the ambulance
without any hesitation.

505
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:37,768
Yes.

506
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:47,570
This is the footage of the CCTV
we submitted additionally.

507
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:50,030
Since this was located
in an unnoticeable alley,

508
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:53,200
the prosecution
was unable to acquire these footages.

509
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:58,873
When you look at the screen,
the plate number is 8209.

510
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:01,250
Isn't this your vehicle?

511
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:02,877
Yes, it is.

512
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:06,547
Let me direct you
to the date and the time.

513
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:11,302
It was the day
after the murder at 11:13am.

514
00:41:14,763 --> 00:41:16,098
What is the meaning of this?

515
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:20,895
You testified you were certain

516
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:24,023
that you arrived
at the victim's house at 1 p.m.

517
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,566
That was your testimony, wasn't it?

518
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:27,234
I think it was.

519
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:28,527
WITNESS

520
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:31,113
Was it 11 a.m. or 1 p.m.?

521
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:35,201
I'm asking you the time of your arrival.

522
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:36,702
I don't know.

523
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:39,330
A while ago,
you seemed to remember it clearly.

524
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:41,040
But now you can't.

525
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:44,460
Your Honor, the defense lawyer
is pressuring the witness to testify.

526
00:41:44,543 --> 00:41:47,421
I'm merely questioning her
since there is a reasonable doubt.

527
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:48,672
You may continue.

528
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:50,216
Please answer the question.

529
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:53,219
-Ms. Yang!
-I said I don't know.

530
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:55,137
I don't remember!

531
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,598
Should I refresh your memory?

532
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:00,893
Isn't it true...

533
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:03,103
that you murdered...

534
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:05,231
your brother, the victim?

535
00:42:05,314 --> 00:42:06,815
-Your Honor.
-No, I didn't.

536
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:08,776
You didn't murder him?

537
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:11,111
You'll accuse Ms. Yang of murder?

538
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:14,740
Yes. In order to get
a true testimony out of her,

539
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:16,992
I'm going to pressure her
to make a false testimony.

540
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:19,036
It's called a leading question.

541
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:22,248
No, I didn't.

542
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:26,252
According to the evidence
we have gathered,

543
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:29,838
we were informed that Ms. Yang
and the victim were not on good terms.

544
00:42:30,631 --> 00:42:33,676
Contrary to his reputation in the media,
the victim had

545
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:35,219
a promiscuous love life.

546
00:42:35,302 --> 00:42:39,014
So the witness had to clean up
the mess after the victim.

547
00:42:39,306 --> 00:42:41,100
The witness
couldn't put up with it anymore

548
00:42:41,183 --> 00:42:43,102
and killed her brother.
Isn't this true, Ms. Yang?

549
00:42:43,185 --> 00:42:44,937
-I said I didn't!
-Ms. Yang!

550
00:42:52,861 --> 00:42:54,071
Please speak up.

551
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:02,246
I was just trying to cover it up.

552
00:43:04,206 --> 00:43:06,709
I was just trying to cover up

553
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:09,712
the monstrous acts my brother committed.

554
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:12,881
When I arrived at his house,

555
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:15,009
my brother was already murdered.

556
00:43:16,051 --> 00:43:17,595
On TV, a video was on play,

557
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:20,097
which had the evil things
my brother did to women.

558
00:43:20,889 --> 00:43:24,018
So I tainted every piece of evidence

559
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:26,103
and set it up
to look like a murder by a robber.

560
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:31,275
I was trying to uphold my family
and my brother's reputation.

561
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:33,068
Is that so wrong?

562
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:36,113
Wouldn't you have done
the same thing, Mr. Noh?

563
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:42,953
Then who preserves
the reputation of women...

564
00:43:45,539 --> 00:43:46,957
that your brother trampled on?

565
00:43:55,257 --> 00:43:56,717
Due to the fabricated pieces of evidence,

566
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,886
an innocent man
was unfairly framed for murder.

567
00:44:01,096 --> 00:44:02,723
Who will uphold his rights?

568
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:51,814
You did great, Mr. Noh.

569
00:44:53,273 --> 00:44:54,900
Yes, you too.

570
00:45:58,297 --> 00:45:59,423
Mr. Noh.

571
00:45:59,882 --> 00:46:02,342
There aren't enough bath supplies
on the first floor...

572
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:20,819
He should at least take off his tie
and sleep.

573
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:54,770
Done.

574
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:08,283
I wasn't trying to undress you.

575
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:14,081
I mean, I was just trying to
take off your tie for you.

576
00:47:19,586 --> 00:47:22,256
Why do I always stutter so much?

577
00:47:32,057 --> 00:47:34,601
I promise that I was only
trying to take off your tie.

578
00:47:34,977 --> 00:47:35,978
Please trust me.

579
00:47:37,312 --> 00:47:38,355
Bye, then.

580
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:48,365
Bong-hui, I'm sorry.

581
00:47:53,245 --> 00:47:54,288
But please...

582
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:56,707
Please stay with me for five minutes.

583
00:48:13,015 --> 00:48:14,057
Sleep tight.

584
00:49:03,815 --> 00:49:06,276
Where's Ji-uk?
He should be downstairs by now.

585
00:49:11,573 --> 00:49:12,449
Move out of the way.

586
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:14,534
What's wrong with you?

587
00:49:27,881 --> 00:49:29,091
COURT IN SESSION

588
00:49:29,174 --> 00:49:32,260
Considering the overall story
which was investigated

589
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:34,763
based on the legally selected evidence,

590
00:49:35,013 --> 00:49:38,600
it is difficult to prove
that the defendant

591
00:49:38,684 --> 00:49:41,978
robbed and murdered the victim,

592
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:43,730
Yang Jin-wu.

593
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:46,400
There is also no evidence
to prove otherwise.

594
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:50,654
Thus, the fact of crime
does not meet the burden of proof.

595
00:49:50,779 --> 00:49:54,449
Ergo, under Criminal Procedure Act
Article 325,

596
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:56,118
I find him not guilty.

597
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:35,407
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

598
00:50:35,991 --> 00:50:37,325
The smell of soju is so strong.

599
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:38,869
Thank you.

600
00:50:39,369 --> 00:50:41,037
Everyone, it's a great day.

601
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:42,122
Here.

602
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:44,499
Here's to our first victory--

603
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:46,960
and Jung Hyeon-su's freedom.

604
00:50:47,043 --> 00:50:48,378
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

605
00:50:49,171 --> 00:50:50,088
Congratulations.

606
00:50:50,172 --> 00:50:51,339
-Thank you.
-That's great.

607
00:50:52,841 --> 00:50:53,842
Great.

608
00:50:55,594 --> 00:50:56,636
There's too much soju.

609
00:50:58,013 --> 00:50:59,264
Gosh, the soju is so strong.

610
00:50:59,347 --> 00:51:00,599
Just drink it.

611
00:51:15,781 --> 00:51:16,782
What are you doing?

612
00:51:17,657 --> 00:51:19,284
Nothing. I was just...

613
00:51:19,826 --> 00:51:21,244
I was just enjoying the breeze.

614
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:23,538
It's so gentle.

615
00:51:25,081 --> 00:51:28,210
You feel a bit uncomfortable, don't you?

616
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:32,756
The real culprit didn't get caught yet.

617
00:51:34,007 --> 00:51:35,300
To be exact,

618
00:51:35,592 --> 00:51:37,135
it's only the beginning, not the end.

619
00:51:37,219 --> 00:51:38,345
You're right.

620
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:40,639
But that's the prosecution's job.

621
00:51:41,223 --> 00:51:42,557
Not ours.

622
00:51:45,352 --> 00:51:46,353
You're right.

623
00:52:07,165 --> 00:52:08,625
-Look.
-What?

624
00:52:09,334 --> 00:52:10,418
What's this?

625
00:52:11,419 --> 00:52:12,879
What? A song?

626
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:14,256
Yes.

627
00:52:14,464 --> 00:52:15,632
Ms. Lack of Evidence.

628
00:52:15,924 --> 00:52:18,343
You're the youngest one.

629
00:52:18,426 --> 00:52:20,262
You should do as you're told.

630
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:21,555
Okay, fine.

631
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:23,306
Hey, Bong-hui. Stop it.

632
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:25,225
Don't sing. Just sit still.

633
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:26,393
Why?

634
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:27,644
Why? Why won't you let her sing?

635
00:52:27,727 --> 00:52:29,479
Don't make her sing.

636
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:31,398
Why won't you let me sing?

637
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:34,401
Well...

638
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:36,444
-Don't you know why?
-I don't.

639
00:52:36,528 --> 00:52:39,155
My goodness, what should I do with you?

640
00:52:41,783 --> 00:52:42,868
Fine, go...

641
00:52:43,577 --> 00:52:46,204
Go ahead. Do as you wish.

642
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:49,416
One, two, three, four.

643
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:53,128
My goodness, my goodness, don't do this

644
00:52:53,253 --> 00:52:56,715
A woman's heart is like reed

645
00:52:56,798 --> 00:52:59,426
No, please, don't ask me why

646
00:52:59,509 --> 00:53:01,803
-My goodness.
-You should no longer

647
00:53:01,887 --> 00:53:05,599
Want anything from me

648
00:53:05,765 --> 00:53:09,728
I met you for the first time today

649
00:53:09,811 --> 00:53:12,898
But you are my love

650
00:53:13,189 --> 00:53:16,943
Although we will become strangers

651
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:18,987
If we break up

652
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:20,113
Hello?

653
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:23,366
-Yes, I'm Noh Ji-uk.
-I like you

654
00:53:23,783 --> 00:53:25,493
-That case is over...
-I love you

655
00:53:25,577 --> 00:53:29,331
I love you like it's a lie

656
00:53:29,456 --> 00:53:31,583
-Like a fairy tale
-No, I'll meet you there.

657
00:53:33,585 --> 00:53:35,253
Why? Do you need to go somewhere?

658
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:39,132
Yes, I'll be right back.

659
00:53:40,467 --> 00:53:42,719
I'll give my everything

660
00:53:43,261 --> 00:53:46,306
-If it's for you
-Gosh, she...

661
00:53:47,432 --> 00:53:48,600
Don't drink too much.

662
00:53:50,018 --> 00:53:51,561
PLEASE CALL ME AT THIS NUMBER

663
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:52,812
An alibi?

664
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:55,190
Yes, there was a guy
drinking alone that night.

665
00:53:55,273 --> 00:53:56,775
-You remember, right?
-Yes.

666
00:53:57,525 --> 00:54:00,362
Not many people drink alone,
so I remember him clearly.

667
00:54:00,487 --> 00:54:01,988
-Oh, really?
-Yes.

668
00:54:03,531 --> 00:54:04,658
We have a video.

669
00:54:04,741 --> 00:54:05,992
We took a video that night.

670
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:15,460
One, two, three.

671
00:54:16,962 --> 00:54:18,463
It's a video.

672
00:54:18,546 --> 00:54:19,798
Seriously?

673
00:54:20,048 --> 00:54:21,883
-He got us.
-Did I?

674
00:54:23,718 --> 00:54:24,970
Here it is.

675
00:54:25,261 --> 00:54:26,888
-Happy birthday.
-Thank you.

676
00:54:33,478 --> 00:54:34,938
Well... By any chance,

677
00:54:36,356 --> 00:54:39,359
was there any other guy than this guy?

678
00:54:39,734 --> 00:54:42,362
I'm not sure.
We stayed here for quite a while,

679
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:43,822
but we don't think we saw another guy.

680
00:54:46,032 --> 00:54:47,283
I see.

681
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:53,331
That's strange.

682
00:54:59,671 --> 00:55:01,006
MAY 20, 2017, BIRTHDAY

683
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:13,435
In the afternoon of the incident,

684
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:15,645
since the weather was great,

685
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:17,731
I went for a walk to the park.

686
00:55:17,856 --> 00:55:21,317
Girls were having fun with the balloons
and running about.

687
00:55:21,401 --> 00:55:22,569
They were so cute.

688
00:55:29,451 --> 00:55:32,829
I remembered The Usual Suspects
was being re-released.

689
00:55:32,912 --> 00:55:34,581
So I went to the movies
to catch that film.

690
00:55:34,664 --> 00:55:37,584
I came back
because the schedule didn't fit mine.

691
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:39,002
And...

692
00:55:41,713 --> 00:55:44,758
I had the street food for my lunch
on that day.

693
00:55:44,924 --> 00:55:47,427
I had tteokbokki.
I had good coffee though.

694
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:49,137
I had tteokbokki and cafe mocha.

695
00:55:49,387 --> 00:55:51,306
I added whipped cream
on top of the coffee.

696
00:55:52,682 --> 00:55:55,894
And I had a drink by myself at a bar
that I visit sometimes.

697
00:55:55,977 --> 00:55:57,604
I usually drink alone.

698
00:55:57,896 --> 00:56:01,900
By the way, at the bar, a couple
had a birthday party on that day.

699
00:56:01,983 --> 00:56:04,903
They brought a birthday cake with candles.

700
00:56:06,654 --> 00:56:09,657
This was Jung Hyeon-su's full account
of what he did

701
00:56:09,741 --> 00:56:11,034
on the day of the incident.

702
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:13,870
He actually listed alibis
without making it explicit.

703
00:56:15,747 --> 00:56:17,791
Hello, I'd like fries and beer.

704
00:56:18,792 --> 00:56:22,712
From here on, it's only
my imagination and speculation.

705
00:56:23,922 --> 00:56:28,009
Jung Hyeon-su was here
sometime after the incident

706
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:31,846
and happened to see
the photo as well as the note.

707
00:56:35,016 --> 00:56:36,768
He has a good memory,

708
00:56:37,268 --> 00:56:39,062
so after getting arrested unexpectedly...

709
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:42,607
On May 20, the day of the incident,

710
00:56:43,441 --> 00:56:45,485
you were off duty.

711
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:48,279
We went through all the CCTV footages
from your neighborhood

712
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:51,407
and found out that you left home early
and came back late at night.

713
00:56:52,325 --> 00:56:55,662
Please give me a full account
of what you did that day.

714
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:57,330
Don't leave anything out.

715
00:57:04,045 --> 00:57:05,046
That day, I...

716
00:57:06,172 --> 00:57:08,758
He remembered this photo
and the notes he saw that day,

717
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:12,595
then fabricated a believable story
of what he did that day.

718
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:20,562
He staged himself in busy or crowded areas
so that we can't easily confirm it.

719
00:57:26,901 --> 00:57:29,654
What's he trying to hide
by telling such a lie?

720
00:57:36,828 --> 00:57:41,583
Bong-hui, I heard there are classes
that correct tone-deafness.

721
00:57:41,916 --> 00:57:43,168
Hey, come on.

722
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:47,672
I told you that correcting a thing or two
won't even make a difference.

723
00:57:47,964 --> 00:57:52,760
From head to toe, everything about her
needs to be fixed.

724
00:57:53,052 --> 00:57:56,848
Forget it.
I just need to find out one thing.

725
00:57:57,557 --> 00:57:58,725
What? What is it?

726
00:57:59,017 --> 00:58:01,519
-The melody that the killer sang?
-What?

727
00:58:01,769 --> 00:58:03,855
That can't even serve as evidence.

728
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:06,649
Still, I have to find out.

729
00:58:08,026 --> 00:58:09,068
Listen up.

730
00:58:09,611 --> 00:58:10,695
Again?

731
00:58:37,931 --> 00:58:38,973
How pretty.

732
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:41,142
SHOE REPAIR

733
00:59:52,922 --> 00:59:55,717
If someone can recognize that melody,

734
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:59,304
I swear that person must be a genius.

735
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:03,766
She's pretty good.

736
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:06,019
Hyeon-su, you must be very drunk
right now.

737
01:00:06,102 --> 01:00:10,148
Are you saying you can tell
what song it is?

738
01:00:10,398 --> 01:00:12,775
Well, no. That I don't know.

739
01:00:14,694 --> 01:00:16,738
-I'm doomed.
-I was just kidding.

740
01:00:17,864 --> 01:00:19,157
Mr. Byeon.

741
01:00:19,824 --> 01:00:22,201
-Yes.
-I'll be sure to find him.

742
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:45,016
They say when the guilty goes free,
the judge is guilty.

743
01:00:46,017 --> 01:00:47,435
It means when a criminal is acquitted,

744
01:00:47,518 --> 01:00:50,313
the judge, prosecutor,
and lawyer who set him free

745
01:00:51,022 --> 01:00:52,315
are all guilty.

746
01:01:13,753 --> 01:01:14,837
If I...

747
01:01:16,214 --> 01:01:18,049
helped a criminal get acquitted,

748
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:20,927
it would be you,

749
01:01:22,095 --> 01:01:23,179
Jung Hyeon-su.

750
01:01:36,859 --> 01:01:38,903
If you never find out who I am,

751
01:01:38,986 --> 01:01:41,948
I'll always be good to you.

752
01:01:42,031 --> 01:01:44,033
I've gotten used to seeing him
as only my boss.

753
01:01:44,117 --> 01:01:45,451
I ended my one-sided love as well.

754
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:47,829
Shall I help you? Come a little closer.

755
01:01:47,954 --> 01:01:50,164
I know who bought the shoes.

756
01:01:50,248 --> 01:01:52,500
What if something happened to you?

757
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:54,252
What would you have done?
And what about me?

758
01:01:54,794 --> 01:01:56,045
What could I have done?

759
01:01:58,297 --> 01:02:00,299
