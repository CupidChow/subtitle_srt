1
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,752
Where are you going at this hour?

2
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:50,049
You can't be going to work on a weekend.

3
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:52,469
It's none of your business.

4
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:01,352
-Where are you off to?
-Well,

5
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:04,397
I need to go to my office
to take care of...

6
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:09,360
The guy from the forensic center
called me. The results must be out.

7
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:16,034
Yes, Ms. Eun.

8
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:18,828
I didn't find anything useful.

9
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:33,343
Yes. Would it be possible
to hear the result in person?

10
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,136
Yes.

11
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:36,429
He didn't find anything.

12
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,765
I'll come see you right now.

13
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:41,559
Okay.

14
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:43,770
Please, tell me your location.

15
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:50,944
Hi.

16
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:53,029
It's been a while.

17
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,131
I could tell it right away.

18
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,342
She is his ex-girlfriend.

19
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:16,427
When people find out
they've been cheated on,

20
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:17,637
they start to doubt themselves.

21
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:20,515
They start to wonder
if they did something wrong

22
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:22,976
or if they were cheated on
because they were not worthy of love.

23
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,938
That is not true.
We didn't do anything wrong.

24
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:29,649
Those who betrayed us are at fault.

25
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:35,780
She's the woman who betrayed and left him.

26
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:48,543
How were you?

27
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,339
Aren't you going to ask

28
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:55,008
why I'm here?

29
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:57,927
No.

30
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:01,097
I'm...

31
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:05,685
not really curious.

32
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:09,230
Do you want to yell at me?

33
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:11,399
You can swear at me
and tell me I'm brazen.

34
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,192
You can do whatever you want.

35
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:14,360
I'll take your anger.

36
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:15,486
No.

37
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,322
I don't need to, or even want to.

38
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:19,407
Just tell me what you're here for.

39
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:21,826
We didn't need a reason to see each other.

40
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:25,246
I don't know. I'm not interested in
talking about the past.

41
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:29,709
You're really cold, Ji-uk.

42
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:32,295
What else do you think
is left between us, Yu-jeong?

43
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:40,970
Don't do this, Ji-uk.

44
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:44,933
Let's...

45
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:46,768
You and I...

46
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:51,439
We can't forget each other
and move on so easily like this.

47
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:53,107
Don't be mistaken, Yu-jeong.

48
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:55,693
To me,

49
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:57,570
you already mean nothing.

50
00:03:58,988 --> 00:03:59,989
Ji-uk.

51
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:03,952
What should I do?

52
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:06,663
I know that you're going to feel bad

53
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:08,373
for treating me so coldly.

54
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:09,540
Hey, Yu-jeong.

55
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,334
Honey.

56
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,590
I waited ages for you,
but you didn't come.

57
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:20,426
Who...

58
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:23,346
I'm his present.

59
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:24,389
His present girlfriend.

60
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:25,848
You're his girlfriend?

61
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:29,686
What...

62
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:35,358
We've met before, haven't we?

63
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:38,945
My goodness, you're right. We've met.

64
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:40,822
You guys know each other?

65
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:41,948
Yes.

66
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,117
Yes, honey.

67
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:50,540
Anyway,

68
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:52,292
you should go, Yu-jeong.

69
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:54,294
Bong-hui, come here.

70
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:55,378
Is she...

71
00:04:56,337 --> 00:04:57,672
really your girlfriend...

72
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,841
Ji-uk?

73
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:02,302
That's none of your business.

74
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:07,640
I suddenly got dizzy.

75
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:09,726
I guess it's because

76
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:12,729
we had a wild night yesterday.

77
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:17,150
I guess we took it too far. I'm so dizzy.

78
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:41,716
Bong-hui, what were you thinking?

79
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:44,594
Why did you hold my arm
and act like my girlfriend?

80
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:46,012
And "wild night"?

81
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:50,183
My gosh, Bong-hui.

82
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:54,103
Mr. Noh. Wait, Mr. Noh.

83
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:01,652
I was only trying to repay your kindness.

84
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:04,072
What?

85
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,281
Don't you remember?

86
00:06:05,364 --> 00:06:08,493
You did the same thing
when I was in the same situation.

87
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:09,577
I did?

88
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:11,162
When did I...

89
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:12,955
Bong-hui, you are so...

90
00:06:15,374 --> 00:06:16,375
dirty,

91
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:17,794
but you're also pretty.

92
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:20,546
But you're dirty,

93
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:22,048
and yet very pretty.

94
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:28,346
Give me some wet wipes.

95
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:29,889
My hands suddenly feel dirty.

96
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:31,641
-What? Wet wipes?
-Yes.

97
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:34,185
You remembered it.

98
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,854
You wiped your hands back then too.

99
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:39,315
That's right, I did.

100
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:41,818
I remember very clearly.

101
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:43,820
Me too.

102
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:46,197
You saved my face

103
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,824
in front of my ex-boyfriend
who betrayed me.

104
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,033
I'll never forget that.

105
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:50,201
-Forget it.
-No.

106
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:52,036
-I said, forget it.
-It's my memory.

107
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,539
I don't want to be a part of your memory.

108
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,667
Don't ever repay me by doing this again.

109
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:58,709
-Why not?
-Because

110
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:01,295
if you keep doing this,
I'm scared that you might say--

111
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:02,797
That I'm your wife?

112
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:04,590
Yes.

113
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,467
I could say you're the father of my kids.

114
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:07,927
You'd better not say that.

115
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:09,387
I'll see.

116
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,386
-Ji-uk.
-Hey, you're here.

117
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,471
Yes.

118
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:34,847
Were you reading?

119
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,544
I need to get off...

120
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,215
here.

121
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:36,158
Bong-hui, why are you here?

122
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:37,785
Did you follow me here?

123
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:39,912
Exactly.

124
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:42,164
Why in the world am I here?

125
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:57,847
Ms. Eun.

126
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:00,224
Mr. Ji?

127
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:03,352
What are you doing here?

128
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:05,896
Did you come here to see me?

129
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,691
Am I not allowed to be here?
Is this private land or what?

130
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,985
Why is everyone asking me why I'm here?

131
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:13,154
It's not like I came here
because I wanted to. Gosh.

132
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:17,074
My gosh.

133
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:18,743
I'm sorry.

134
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,078
I shouldn't have taken
my anger out on you.

135
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:23,247
I'm relieved.

136
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:24,248
About what?

137
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:25,833
I'm not the one you're angry at.

138
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:28,377
You're always welcome to vent out on me.

139
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:29,920
I have a lot of experience.

140
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:33,591
I'll keep using you then.

141
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:35,217
Bye.

142
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:46,937
I am

143
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:50,024
the head lawyer of this firm.

144
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:52,693
But these jerks keep excluding me
from every meeting.

145
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:54,612
They say they're trying to be considerate,

146
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:57,323
but do they think I'm stupid or what?

147
00:10:57,698 --> 00:11:00,826
They're looking down on me
because I've gotten old.

148
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,371
Hey.

149
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:06,248
Am I playing squash or something?
Am I talking against a wall?

150
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,958
-Yes.
-"Yes"?

151
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:10,586
-No.
-My goodness.

152
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:14,924
My gosh, did Ji-uk make you mad again,
Mr. Byeon?

153
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:16,175
Shall I scold him for you?

154
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,426
Let me scold you first.

155
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:19,261
Why did you get here so late?

156
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:20,471
Ji-uk, your glass is empty.

157
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:28,354
Why do you look so sad?

158
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:30,106
Did you come to my funeral?

159
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:31,982
This is my birthday party.

160
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:33,317
Birthday.

161
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:37,530
Here you go.
This is your birthday present.

162
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:39,031
It's your favorite wine.

163
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,116
Really?

164
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:42,410
This is nice. All right.

165
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:44,954
What about you?

166
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:46,122
Did you bring anything?

167
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:47,581
Of course, I did.

168
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:53,045
Happy birthday.

169
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,215
My goodness, Ji-uk.

170
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:58,551
Did you even write a letter?

171
00:11:58,717 --> 00:12:00,052
Look at you.

172
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:03,722
Wait a second. My eyesight
has gotten worse these days.

173
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:05,724
You wrote me a letter?

174
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:09,395
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

175
00:12:09,728 --> 00:12:10,855
A letter of resignation?

176
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,899
My goodness, you wrote
a letter of resignation?

177
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,778
Thank you for tonight.

178
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:18,988
-See you tomorrow.
-Okay.

179
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,739
-Bye.
-Goodbye, sir.

180
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:21,824
Thank you.

181
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:24,118
Okay, let's go.

182
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:31,876
Did you call a chauffeur service?

183
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:33,878
Yes.

184
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:35,921
What's with the resignation?

185
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:42,803
Hey, do I need to tell you
every little thing?

186
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,530
CHA YU-JEONG

187
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:03,032
Yu-jeong.

188
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:11,832
You're back.

189
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:22,635
-Ji-hae.
-Yes.

190
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:24,845
By any chance, do you know
a lawyer named Eun Bong-hui?

191
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:28,933
Lawyer, my ass.
She's the disgrace of this field.

192
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:30,851
She's a crazy murder suspect.

193
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:32,353
Eat first. I can't understand you.

194
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:34,772
Just a second.

195
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:40,945
She's the prime suspect
for the murder of Hui-jun,

196
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:42,363
the Chief Prosecutor's son.

197
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:44,698
What?

198
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,119
JUDICIAL APPRENTICE KILLS HER EX

199
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:50,871
That was Lawyer Eun Bong-hui?

200
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,331
Yes.

201
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:54,959
She looks so different in person.

202
00:13:56,835 --> 00:13:58,254
This is who she really is.

203
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,843
I really liked her.

204
00:14:05,844 --> 00:14:07,763
Why do I keep running into her like this?

205
00:14:07,846 --> 00:14:10,849
My goodness. You liked her?

206
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:13,852
You aren't a good judge of character.

207
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:17,231
She's his girlfriend?

208
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:20,192
"Girlfriend"? Who? Her?

209
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:21,986
Does she have a boyfriend?

210
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:25,990
Gosh, for goodness' sake.

211
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,367
What kind of idiot would go out with her?

212
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,379
PROSECUTOR CHA YU-JEONG

213
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:49,263
I've sent my resume to so many
places but haven't heard a word.

214
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:52,391
Don't worry. Everything
will be fine. Best of luck!

215
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:55,895
Okay, good luck to you too.
Don't skip meals.

216
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:57,229
BEST OF LUCK, DAUGHTER!

217
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:01,901
Okay, good night.

218
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:32,765
I've listened to a lot of songs
in the last two years

219
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:35,643
to find the culprit's melody.

220
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:37,937
But the music I'm hearing now

221
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,773
sounds like the saddest music
in the whole world.

222
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:00,626
What's up?

223
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:02,503
Are you hungry?

224
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,338
-Excuse me?
-Shall I make you something?

225
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,132
Sure.

226
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:34,410
By the way, Bong-hui.

227
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:36,870
Why am I doing this now?

228
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:38,747
-Pardon?
-Why am I

229
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,749
always feeding you like this?

230
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:45,004
Because you're the better cook.

231
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:03,313
Don't ask.

232
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:05,024
I didn't say anything.

233
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,277
You're asking me with your eyes now.

234
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:13,532
Then, I'll ask with my mouth.

235
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:15,200
Why...

236
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:17,619
did you two break up?

237
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:35,179
One day...

238
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:37,514
I went to Yu-jeong's...

239
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:40,476
I went over to her place.

240
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:42,519
And...

241
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:50,235
I saw her with another man.

242
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:57,076
-That's all.
-What a bitch.

243
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,330
I knew it.

244
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:05,209
Those who do that with someone else
when they're in a relationship

245
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:08,087
should be swept into one place
and beaten up to a pulp.

246
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:11,673
Gosh, they're total pieces of shit.

247
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:20,682
This must be why people vent to others.

248
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:22,267
To have someone side with me.

249
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,269
Shall I curse at them more?

250
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,689
Those worthless pieces of...

251
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:29,650
Enough. It doesn't suit you.

252
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,780
Come to me when you want to swear
at someone.

253
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:38,117
Don't keep it bottled up inside.
You have an unlimited pass.

254
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,650
-Please say a few words!
-Step back!

255
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:13,402
-Any evidence yet?
-Please say a few words.

256
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:17,739
Next news. Chef Yang,
who become famous from a TV show

257
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:20,742
was found stabbed and dead at his house.

258
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:23,829
Assuming this as a homicide, the police

259
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,957
is investigating people around him
and analyzing CCTV footages

260
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,084
-to track down a suspect.
-Were you there by any chance?

261
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,253
The National Police Agency
and Goyang Police Station...

262
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:32,796
What do you mean?

263
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:35,883
Did you inspect that scene?

264
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,385
CELEBRITY CHEF FOUND DEAD

265
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:40,220
Yes.

266
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,390
What do you think the reason is?

267
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:46,810
Why would someone kill a person?

268
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:49,062
I'm not sure. Well...

269
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,982
I guess everybody has
their own situation and reason.

270
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:53,859
What kind of situation
can justify a murder?

271
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,528
For argument's sake,
let's say there is a situation.

272
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:58,113
Would Hui-jun's killer

273
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,782
who made me the suspect
also have had a reason?

274
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,702
I can't answer that.

275
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:07,039
You're right.

276
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:12,211
What will you do now?

277
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:15,130
We've found nothing from the shoes
or anything else.

278
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:18,967
He even left me a warning note.

279
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:20,969
I'm sure he'll reveal himself eventually.

280
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,138
I'll be sure to catch him
no matter how long it takes.

281
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:26,308
That might put you in danger though.

282
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,852
I'll never give up no matter what happens.

283
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:30,771
You're fearless.

284
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:34,233
What I fear more is living
as the prime suspect

285
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:38,612
for the rest of my life
because I couldn't catch the killer.

286
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:53,252
Here are the shoes.

287
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:56,505
Watch me. I'll be sure to catch him.

288
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:58,423
I should go. Thanks for everything.

289
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,266
I'll give you a ride.

290
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:10,560
It's okay.

291
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:11,895
Get in.

292
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:18,360
Okay.

293
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:34,835
Mr. Noh. You startled me.

294
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:37,212
Why are you here?

295
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:38,880
Mr. Bang told me you'd be here.

296
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:41,925
-Who told you to go alone?
-Excuse me?

297
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:43,719
I said we should catch
the killer together.

298
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:47,139
Hello.

299
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:50,642
I heard that there were no fingerprints
or DNA.

300
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:54,688
That means the culprit is
someone who's pretty meticulous

301
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:58,984
with a good level of knowledge
in forensic science...

302
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:04,489
Catch the culprit.

303
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:06,992
-Of course.
-Together.

304
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:09,578
-What?
-Let's catch him together.

305
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:18,754
Do you realize that you're being
nice to me in a subtle way?

306
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:20,255
I'm explicitly being nice to you.

307
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:22,466
-Why?
-Is that a problem?

308
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:25,177
Well, I just want to know why.

309
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:28,472
By any chance, do you...

310
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:36,646
It's love for humanity.

311
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:43,403
"Love for humanity"?

312
00:22:45,363 --> 00:22:46,656
Humanity as in mankind?

313
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:48,909
LOVE FOR HUMANITY

314
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:51,661
LOVE FOR ALL MANKIND

315
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:05,050
Dad, I'll go ahead!

316
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,846
-Come on!
-Hey, kid.

317
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:15,060
That rude kid also belongs to mankind.

318
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:17,270
The asshole father belongs to mankind too.

319
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:20,899
Those jerks also belong to mankind.

320
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:22,901
You two look great together.
Are you a couple?

321
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:24,069
-Are you nuts?
-Are you nuts?

322
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:26,905
What are you looking at?

323
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:29,950
It's disappointing
that you guys belong to mankind too.

324
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:31,743
That's what I think when I look at you.

325
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:33,078
What do you mean?

326
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,080
Are you implying
that we're not even human?

327
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:39,292
You really get the gist
of what I'm trying to say!

328
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:40,919
Hey, Bong-hui. You are--

329
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:43,296
What? What is it? What?

330
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,803
We were just talking about you.

331
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,179
It's funny how we ran into you.

332
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:53,223
We call this "synchronism".
It's a big word.

333
00:23:53,431 --> 00:23:56,518
In layman's terms, "speak of the devil."

334
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:58,019
Or "badmouthing someone."

335
00:23:58,103 --> 00:23:59,229
We were just sharing facts.

336
00:23:59,312 --> 00:24:00,522
That's right. "Facts."

337
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:03,608
The job interview
you and Mr. Noh messed up.

338
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,279
Why are you bringing Mr. Noh into this?

339
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:08,488
Hey.

340
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:11,575
Besides, it's you guys
who messed things up, not me.

341
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:14,119
Hold on. Can we talk without
you grabbing us by the collar?

342
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:15,328
-I--
-Jeez!

343
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:21,501
Hey, Ji-uk. I heard you are going to quit.

344
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:22,502
You're awesome.

345
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:26,131
You know you'll be let go.
You beat him to it!

346
00:24:27,465 --> 00:24:29,384
-Let's go.
-Gosh.

347
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:30,927
What is it?

348
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:34,598
You know, I'm quite well-informed.

349
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:38,101
I heard you guys
are close to getting sacked too.

350
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:39,895
There are over 20,000 lawyers now.

351
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:41,730
Yet you're worried about other lawyers.

352
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:44,399
You should worry about yourselves.
It's touch-and-go for you.

353
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:48,778
Hey.

354
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:51,323
-Hey.
-That jerk.

355
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:28,944
Mr. Noh isn't respected
at his firm at all.

356
00:25:29,527 --> 00:25:30,737
That was bound to happen.

357
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:33,323
He released the suspect
who killed the Chief Prosecutor's son.

358
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:35,784
On top of that, he had an argument
with the Chief Prosecutor.

359
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:38,203
He's an enemy of the prosecution.

360
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:40,538
There's a rumor he submitted resignation.

361
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:43,416
He practically got fired.

362
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:54,469
If Ji-uk opens his own practice,
he will go bankrupt.

363
00:25:54,552 --> 00:25:56,721
You're cursing him, Mr. Byeon!

364
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:58,765
I'm just worried about him.

365
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:02,852
Ms. Hong, you have to stop him
from resigning.

366
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:05,397
I'll never do a thing
to stand in my son's way.

367
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,983
He's smart and distinguished.

368
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:10,527
I'm sure he can manage everything
on his own.

369
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:11,611
He can't.

370
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:12,696
You're too loud.

371
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:14,781
Don't try to stop him.

372
00:26:14,864 --> 00:26:16,866
Instead, try to support him.

373
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:18,994
What are you going to do
with all of your money?

374
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:21,538
You should use it to help pave
a path for young people.

375
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:23,999
-I think opening a practice--
-Just eat your pizza.

376
00:26:24,624 --> 00:26:27,127
After you finish this,
make sure you eat another box

377
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:28,920
and buy a few more boxes when you go.

378
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:32,674
Goodness.
I don't even like pizza that much.

379
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:33,758
RÉSUMÉ

380
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:37,804
NAME: PARK YEONG-SUN

381
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:39,931
Oh, my goodness.

382
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:41,683
What? What is it?

383
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:44,477
The universe gave me a chance
to take my revenge.

384
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:48,857
Thank you so much.

385
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,108
My pleasure.

386
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:51,776
I'll see you next month.

387
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,570
-Yes. I'll see you next month.
-Okay.

388
00:26:53,653 --> 00:26:54,946
I'll definitely see you.

389
00:26:58,533 --> 00:27:00,410
Bong-hui, I got a job.

390
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:02,037
They want me to start next month.

391
00:27:16,634 --> 00:27:17,927
BONG-HUI, I GOT A JOB

392
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:22,724
Goodness. Congratulations.

393
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:26,394
I will give you 350,000 won
for all the furniture in this office.

394
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:27,479
What?

395
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:31,358
Do you know how much I paid
for all the furniture here?

396
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:32,901
How can you give me such a low price?

397
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:35,612
I actually have to get paid
to take all the furniture.

398
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:37,822
Goodness.

399
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:47,082
I don't have any deposit left?

400
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:48,333
Not even a little?

401
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:55,256
EUN BONG-HUI LAW FIRM

402
00:28:33,336 --> 00:28:35,547
What? How can we meet here?

403
00:28:35,713 --> 00:28:36,798
Goodness.

404
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:38,550
Gosh, this is amazing.

405
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:41,094
This isn't amazing at all.
This store is in my neighborhood.

406
00:28:41,177 --> 00:28:43,930
Oh, my. You actually
go grocery shopping yourself.

407
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:47,892
If I didn't, who do you think
bought food and fed you all this time?

408
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:52,480
I was treated with the utmost care
for all this time.

409
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:53,815
How can I repay you?

410
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:56,234
I'm scared of how you'll repay me,
so you don't need to.

411
00:28:56,776 --> 00:28:57,902
I'll pay for this.

412
00:28:58,278 --> 00:29:00,572
-Buy more if you need to.
-Really?

413
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:02,323
I'll be happy to.

414
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,245
Gosh, I needed so many things.

415
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:08,955
I have to get this one too.

416
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:19,591
Thank you for what you've done
for me all this time.

417
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:23,261
Since I don't have anything
but a grateful heart,

418
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:26,014
I'll return your kindness some other time
in the future.

419
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:46,659
Make sure you eat nuts every day.

420
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:48,244
It's good for insomnia.

421
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:57,712
I heard it's not good to drink
strong liquor to fall asleep.

422
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:00,381
I'm leaving some tea for your insomnia.

423
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:02,217
This tea tastes really bad.

424
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:09,432
I organized the groceries in your fridge.

425
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:12,185
I hate carrots so much.

426
00:30:15,396 --> 00:30:16,940
What a mess.

427
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:55,436
Well.

428
00:30:56,145 --> 00:30:57,188
Goodbye.

429
00:31:03,152 --> 00:31:05,947
She left the room squeaky clean.

430
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:26,467
She always forgets things like this.

431
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:40,375
This is my official letter of resignation.

432
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:42,293
Please, accept it.

433
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:46,214
You...

434
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:49,008
You're opening a practice, right?

435
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:51,427
-Yes.
-I'll invest in your practice.

436
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:53,471
No, I don't accept black money.

437
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:57,266
Hey, you punk.
People might get the wrong idea.

438
00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:00,103
Am I a thug, the triad, or the mafia?

439
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:09,320
Hurry and give me the trial record.

440
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:12,699
I hesitated handing in my resignation
because of you.

441
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:15,618
I know too well
that you all don't want to see me.

442
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:17,578
So, I wanted to come to work every day

443
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:19,789
and show you my face by all means.

444
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,416
I'm disappointed how this turned out.

445
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:43,021
I quit the law firm to open up
my own practice.

446
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:47,191
I need an office manager.
I want someone just like you, Mr. Bang.

447
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:51,195
Are you recruiting me?
Do you want me to quit?

448
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:52,655
No, I never said you should quit.

449
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:56,868
But if I get an office manager,
I want someone like you.

450
00:33:58,036 --> 00:33:59,037
Bye.

451
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:02,832
-It's confidential.
-Confidential.

452
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:11,466
What does he want me to do?

453
00:34:13,509 --> 00:34:14,844
Why is he doing that again?

454
00:34:15,678 --> 00:34:17,055
He seemed to be fine for a while.

455
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:21,142
What am I supposed to do?

456
00:34:59,722 --> 00:35:01,265
SEOUL BAR ASSOCIATION

457
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:05,061
REPORT OPENING TO THE ASSOCIATION

458
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:44,976
Are you really going to quit?

459
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:48,312
How can Ji-uk manage
a law firm on his own?

460
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:51,440
He won't be able to earn a penny
in his entire life.

461
00:35:51,607 --> 00:35:53,985
He'd give out his money
all over the place.

462
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:55,862
This turned out great.

463
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:59,282
Recently, I've heard that
you lost the power struggle

464
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:01,033
-in this firm.
-What did you say?

465
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:03,202
It's great that you have an excuse
for your resignation.

466
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:04,704
Ji-uk is finally doing right by you.

467
00:36:04,787 --> 00:36:05,746
You little punk.

468
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:10,001
Should I come too?

469
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:12,128
Do you want to?

470
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:15,882
There should be at least
one profitable lawyer like you.

471
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:18,509
But do you think Ji-uk would hire me?

472
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:20,261
Why wouldn't he?

473
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:23,472
He said that he was planning to hire
a few more lawyers.

474
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:25,558
I heard he's going to recruit
someone today.

475
00:36:25,641 --> 00:36:27,476
-Really?
-Yes.

476
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,437
TAEKWONDO STUDIO

477
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:36,402
Attention.

478
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,697
Today, we will practice
the third form of tae kwon do.

479
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,616
Jae-won, I want you to give a shout.

480
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:43,826
Here we go. Get ready.

481
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:48,080
One.

482
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:50,124
Two.

483
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:53,252
One.

484
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,421
Two.

485
00:36:56,672 --> 00:36:57,673
One.

486
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:00,009
Two.

487
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:02,094
One.

488
00:37:03,262 --> 00:37:04,263
Two.

489
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,481
-I see.
-Oh, my!

490
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:15,066
-Goodness.
-Hey!

491
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:17,485
-Are you all right?
-You startled me!

492
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:19,487
I didn't know you'd be startled.

493
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,072
-Shoot.
-Are you sure you're okay?

494
00:37:21,155 --> 00:37:22,365
Didn't you get hurt?

495
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:23,407
Oh, no. What shall we do?

496
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:24,784
That's all right. I'm fine.

497
00:37:24,867 --> 00:37:26,661
-Are you sure you're fine?
-Yes.

498
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:28,579
By the way, I'm drunk.

499
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:30,915
-Excuse me?
-I said, I'm drunk.

500
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:36,796
Wait.

501
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:38,839
Excuse me for a minute.

502
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:44,887
I'll give you a piggyback ride.

503
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,348
-Get on.
-Do you think you can manage that?

504
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:48,432
Of course.

505
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:05,783
-Hey, Bong-hui!
-Mr. Noh.

506
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:06,909
Are you all right?

507
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:09,412
Are you all right? Are you okay?

508
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:10,496
One.

509
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:23,509
I'm asking if you are all right.

510
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:32,768
Hey, Bong-hui.

511
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:38,983
Bong-hui. Are you really going to quit?

512
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:40,609
You said you needed a part-timer.

513
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:43,779
It will be great for me
if you help me until my delivery.

514
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:45,823
But are you seriously
going to be okay with this?

515
00:38:46,198 --> 00:38:48,200
Should I continue
when only the debt is piling up?

516
00:38:48,617 --> 00:38:49,869
I have to retreat for now.

517
00:38:49,952 --> 00:38:52,747
See? Getting that instructor license
came in quite handy.

518
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,498
Right? Don't you agree with me?

519
00:38:56,834 --> 00:39:00,004
Hey. Do something about your glasses.

520
00:39:02,214 --> 00:39:03,841
I'm out of contact lenses.

521
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:06,510
I'm also running low on cosmetics
and shampoo.

522
00:39:07,803 --> 00:39:10,639
I ran out of pads I bought in bulk
when they were on sale.

523
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:13,851
It seems everything runs out
at the same time.

524
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:20,399
Hey, I think a parent is here
for a consultation.

525
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:21,484
-Over there.
-What?

526
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:24,612
Hello.

527
00:39:24,987 --> 00:39:27,740
You are too young to be a parent.

528
00:39:27,823 --> 00:39:29,950
Are you here for yourself?

529
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:33,079
No, I would like to consult

530
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:35,206
with that instructor over there.

531
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:36,499
Excuse me?

532
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:53,849
So, are you done being a lawyer?

533
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,561
It's only temporarily.

534
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:02,400
Don't you think
you're giving up too easily?

535
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:06,529
It wasn't easy at all.

536
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:11,117
It's hard to give up on anything,
whether it's work or a relationship.

537
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:14,870
I don't get it. Why would you give it up
when it was such a hard decision for you?

538
00:40:15,162 --> 00:40:17,832
It's time for me to compromise.

539
00:40:25,631 --> 00:40:27,591
Then, are you rejecting my proposal?

540
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:30,010
-Excuse me?
-Are you dumping me?

541
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:31,887
-What?
-I told you before.

542
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:33,931
I told you to be my person
and work for me.

543
00:40:34,223 --> 00:40:35,808
Come back to me.

544
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:38,018
Come work for me.

545
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:40,479
Well, what do you mean...

546
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:47,528
Wasn't that just the alcohol talking?

547
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:48,863
-It wasn't.
-Did you mean it?

548
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:50,614
-Yes, I did.
-Are you messing around with me?

549
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:51,740
No, I'm not.

550
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:53,909
What are you doing?

551
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:55,911
Since I can't read your face,
I can't figure out

552
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:57,413
if this is a joke or not.

553
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:08,966
This isn't a joke.

554
00:41:10,926 --> 00:41:14,013
Anyway, I will pay you in advance.
So, let's go buy contact lenses.

555
00:41:14,096 --> 00:41:15,181
You remembered.

556
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:18,976
I thought you wouldn't remember
because you were drunk.

557
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:22,855
Then, do you remember what happened next?

558
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:35,034
What happened next...

559
00:41:36,118 --> 00:41:37,119
I don't remember that.

560
00:41:38,704 --> 00:41:39,788
I see. You don't.

561
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:42,124
Hey, don't act shy.

562
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:44,001
-Yes, sir.
-Get your things too.

563
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:48,005
I appreciate your offer,

564
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:49,882
but I won't accept it.

565
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:51,592
-What?
-It took me

566
00:41:52,259 --> 00:41:54,094
a lot of courage to give up.

567
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:58,641
If I have to give up again
after going back to you,

568
00:41:59,266 --> 00:42:00,893
then it would be really hard for me.

569
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:03,062
Most importantly,

570
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:06,023
if I go there,
it'll be such a hassle for you.

571
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:09,235
It'll only make me look shameless.

572
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:19,078
Thank you for coming to see me.

573
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:24,959
Bong-hui.

574
00:42:35,177 --> 00:42:37,179
You're unique because you're shameless.

575
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:40,516
But if you decide not to be shameless,

576
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:42,268
you'll be just like the others.

577
00:42:45,312 --> 00:42:47,815
You should think about that.

578
00:42:51,443 --> 00:42:52,736
That was a bit

579
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:54,238
too cool.

580
00:43:15,217 --> 00:43:17,636
I barely mustered up my courage.

581
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:20,222
I barely managed

582
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:23,183
to give up on both work and Ji-uk.

583
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:04,808
That was quicker than I expected.
It took you exactly seven minutes.

584
00:44:06,518 --> 00:44:09,396
Those seven minutes were very long.

585
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:16,070
Get in.

586
00:44:22,034 --> 00:44:23,827
I forgot to tell you this.

587
00:44:25,287 --> 00:44:27,164
Bong-hui, you do tend to be
a hassle at times.

588
00:44:27,956 --> 00:44:29,208
But that's not all.

589
00:44:31,877 --> 00:44:34,004
Hostage. You're also a hostage.

590
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:37,383
In order for me to catch the culprit,

591
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:39,093
you need to be by my side.

592
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:43,430
A hostage.

593
00:44:58,195 --> 00:44:59,196
Aren't you coming?

594
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:01,115
I'm coming.

595
00:45:06,328 --> 00:45:07,413
-Exactly.
-I know.

596
00:45:07,496 --> 00:45:08,997
Hey, you're here.

597
00:45:09,915 --> 00:45:12,418
What are you guys doing here
without my permission?

598
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:14,211
-What are you doing?
-Hello.

599
00:45:14,294 --> 00:45:15,838
-Mr. Ji?
-Hi, Ms. Eun.

600
00:45:15,921 --> 00:45:18,006
Hey, I haven't seen you wear
those glasses in a while.

601
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:20,175
I think I've seen you somewhere.

602
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:22,428
I guess Ms. Eun was the lawyer
he was planning to recruit.

603
00:45:22,511 --> 00:45:23,595
We're doomed.

604
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:25,514
What? I'm going to do my best.

605
00:45:25,597 --> 00:45:27,099
Bong-hui, this is your seat.

606
00:45:27,182 --> 00:45:29,101
-Yes, sir.
-Where did I see you?

607
00:45:29,184 --> 00:45:30,811
I can't seem to remember. Who is she?

608
00:45:30,936 --> 00:45:32,855
Hello, let me introduce myself.

609
00:45:32,938 --> 00:45:34,356
No, don't tell me.

610
00:45:34,481 --> 00:45:36,358
I know you. You're that murderer.

611
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:38,068
She got released due to lack of evidence.

612
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:40,446
She's the one who killed
Mu-yeong's son, right?

613
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:42,156
Who is that man?

614
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:45,409
-Who is he to slander me like that?
-I don't know.

615
00:45:45,492 --> 00:45:47,369
He's the chairman of Byeon and Partners.

616
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:49,163
No, he used to be.

617
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:51,748
But he doesn't even know
the presumption of innocence?

618
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:52,749
Exactly.

619
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:53,834
That's enough.

620
00:45:54,168 --> 00:45:57,296
Hey, what is she doing here?

621
00:45:57,379 --> 00:45:59,465
Mr. Noh came to recruit me himself.

622
00:45:59,548 --> 00:46:02,217
Why would you tell him that?

623
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:04,261
-Are you crazy?
-I'm not crazy.

624
00:46:04,344 --> 00:46:06,597
We'll go out of business
if she works here.

625
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:07,931
That's a big possibility.

626
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:08,974
-Gosh!
-Mr. Bang.

627
00:46:09,057 --> 00:46:10,434
Don't worry, sir. I'll be earning.

628
00:46:10,517 --> 00:46:12,102
Whatever! You guys are so loud!

629
00:46:12,186 --> 00:46:13,228
Everyone, get out of here!

630
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:15,272
I just made up my mind.
I'm going to work on my own!

631
00:46:15,355 --> 00:46:16,565
I'm not working with any of you!

632
00:46:16,648 --> 00:46:17,691
Do you want me to go?

633
00:46:17,774 --> 00:46:19,776
-No, stay.
-I'm going to stay too.

634
00:46:20,027 --> 00:46:22,112
Why are you guys being so loud?

635
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:24,323
My gosh. Don't worry, Ji-uk.
I'll help you.

636
00:46:24,406 --> 00:46:25,324
I love you, Ji-uk.

637
00:46:25,407 --> 00:46:27,451
Hey, Ji-uk. Wait. Stop.

638
00:46:31,997 --> 00:46:33,957
I didn't get hurt. Don't worry.

639
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:36,293
Everything will work out well.
I liked Ms. Eun's seat.

640
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:48,597
-A hostage.
-A hostage.

641
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:50,224
You're also a hostage.

642
00:46:51,683 --> 00:46:54,436
I didn't know the word hostage
could sound so romantic and sexy.

643
00:46:57,439 --> 00:46:58,982
From humanity to hostage.

644
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:01,985
I got upgraded!

645
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:03,862
He said I'm a hostage.

646
00:47:03,946 --> 00:47:05,322
My gosh, what should I do?

647
00:47:05,614 --> 00:47:06,949
I'm a hostage.

648
00:47:07,616 --> 00:47:10,077
He's so cool.

649
00:47:11,203 --> 00:47:12,120
My gosh.

650
00:47:18,877 --> 00:47:20,128
Why? Are you hungry again?

651
00:47:20,879 --> 00:47:23,924
No. I got bored, so I was wondering
if there was anything to eat.

652
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:25,926
-Doesn't that mean you're hungry?
-No.

653
00:47:26,134 --> 00:47:27,386
There's bread and fruits.

654
00:47:28,554 --> 00:47:30,305
By the way, is Mr. Bang working with...

655
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:34,184
That chairman will work
with us too, right?

656
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:36,478
-Probably.
-Gosh.

657
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,568
What about Mr. Ji?

658
00:47:46,488 --> 00:47:48,156
There's ice cream in the fridge.

659
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:04,881
-Let's talk.
-Get out of my way.

660
00:48:05,257 --> 00:48:07,759
-Please, spare me some time.
-No.

661
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:11,013
I'd like to explain myself.

662
00:48:11,096 --> 00:48:12,264
It's too late.

663
00:48:15,058 --> 00:48:16,476
Please, listen to me.

664
00:48:22,941 --> 00:48:23,984
Do you remember...

665
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:27,279
burying a time capsule when we were young?

666
00:48:27,696 --> 00:48:28,989
We were childish.

667
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:31,700
Ji-uk.

668
00:48:33,368 --> 00:48:34,786
Let's open that time capsule.

669
00:48:34,911 --> 00:48:37,581
Stop speaking metaphorically
and get to the point.

670
00:48:37,664 --> 00:48:39,416
You won't ever
get a chance like this again.

671
00:48:41,251 --> 00:48:42,252
Okay.

672
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:45,422
Let me explain why...

673
00:48:49,301 --> 00:48:50,385
Hey, guys.

674
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:52,429
Hey.

675
00:48:55,098 --> 00:48:57,184
You guys are too young to be
smoking in the first place.

676
00:48:57,267 --> 00:49:00,729
But how dare you throw
a lit cigarette butt in front of adults?

677
00:49:00,812 --> 00:49:02,105
Hey, you jerks.

678
00:49:02,898 --> 00:49:05,025
What if this hit his face?

679
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:07,152
You'll get charged of injuring someone.
Do you know that?

680
00:49:07,235 --> 00:49:09,363
Wait, I've heard this voice before.

681
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:11,323
Hey, long time no see.

682
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:12,616
How's your mom doing?

683
00:49:12,699 --> 00:49:14,743
Hey, I told you about

684
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:17,245
that shitty lawyer, didn't I?

685
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:19,206
-You little...
-Hey, you punk!

686
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:21,458
How dare you.

687
00:49:25,337 --> 00:49:26,546
He's tall.

688
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:27,631
Hey, guys.

689
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:30,425
There must be a misunderstanding.

690
00:49:30,884 --> 00:49:32,552
We were just passing by.

691
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:35,514
We had no intention of bothering you.

692
00:49:35,597 --> 00:49:37,391
-Right?
-That's right.

693
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:39,309
You guys should quit smoking.

694
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:41,228
-You'd be a great shot putter.
-You punks.

695
00:49:41,311 --> 00:49:42,562
Hey, stop them.

696
00:49:45,982 --> 00:49:47,609
If we hit first, we'll get charged too.

697
00:49:47,693 --> 00:49:49,277
Right. In order to plead self-defense--

698
00:49:49,361 --> 00:49:51,738
They need to hit us first
and hit us more than we do.

699
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:53,740
They can't get hospitalized
for more than three weeks.

700
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:55,158
Don't hit them too much.

701
00:49:56,368 --> 00:49:58,745
But there's no CCTV to prove any of that.

702
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:00,205
Then, we just have to...

703
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:03,583
Either fight high school students
and get charged or--

704
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:05,585
Be fair and square and run!

705
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:09,131
Get them!

706
00:50:09,548 --> 00:50:10,465
Get them!

707
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:11,842
Don't let them go!

708
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:18,223
Beat them up!

709
00:50:30,819 --> 00:50:31,737
You little...

710
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:33,113
Get over here.

711
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:35,699
Grab his legs.

712
00:50:36,491 --> 00:50:37,868
Hey!

713
00:50:49,755 --> 00:50:52,257
-You little--
-Gosh, my hair!

714
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:54,718
Hey!

715
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:56,845
Hey, I'm good at fighting.

716
00:50:57,471 --> 00:50:59,306
Why are you doing that?

717
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:01,725
Hey, that doesn't hurt. That does hurt!

718
00:51:03,268 --> 00:51:05,228
Hey, stop pinching me!

719
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:19,034
You jerks.

720
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:20,702
Are you okay, Ji-uk?

721
00:51:21,161 --> 00:51:22,329
Ji-uk!

722
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:24,372
Hey!

723
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:26,666
-Hey, I'm older than you.
-Don't pinch me.

724
00:51:45,393 --> 00:51:46,436
All I can say...

725
00:51:47,562 --> 00:51:48,647
is this.

726
00:51:52,108 --> 00:51:53,276
I liked her first.

727
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:54,361
Hey, Yu-jeong.

728
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:57,197
I found this on my way here. You're

729
00:51:57,572 --> 00:51:58,657
in my heart.

730
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:03,495
Ji-uk.

731
00:52:04,162 --> 00:52:06,832
To me, you're more than just a friend.

732
00:52:10,585 --> 00:52:11,628
What will you do?

733
00:52:12,754 --> 00:52:13,880
Will you go out with me?

734
00:52:14,756 --> 00:52:16,383
Or will you never see me again?

735
00:52:21,221 --> 00:52:22,305
Well...

736
00:52:24,766 --> 00:52:27,519
Let's date.

737
00:52:43,118 --> 00:52:44,953
The rest of the story is such a cliche.

738
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:54,880
I thought...

739
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:57,507
I could give up my feelings for her.

740
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:07,392
-Have you eaten yet?
-No, I haven't.

741
00:53:07,475 --> 00:53:09,185
-Me neither. Let's go.
-Shall we eat?

742
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:10,520
Sure, I'd love that.

743
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:11,771
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

744
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:13,523
-Do you want to come too?
-It's okay.

745
00:53:19,237 --> 00:53:20,614
I thought I had given up my feelings.

746
00:53:25,076 --> 00:53:26,077
But...

747
00:53:27,495 --> 00:53:28,580
I failed.

748
00:53:54,356 --> 00:53:55,482
I couldn't give up,

749
00:53:56,733 --> 00:53:57,859
and that's all there is to it.

750
00:54:06,242 --> 00:54:07,577
I thought about it...

751
00:54:17,379 --> 00:54:19,381
and realized I'm in no place
to give any excuses, Ji-uk.

752
00:54:37,816 --> 00:54:38,817
I'll never...

753
00:54:44,155 --> 00:54:45,448
forgive you.

754
00:55:04,175 --> 00:55:05,176
I know.

755
00:55:11,057 --> 00:55:12,726
Despite everything that has happened...

756
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:15,687
I can't cut ties with Eun-hyeok...

757
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:19,190
and...

758
00:55:20,442 --> 00:55:22,610
completely hate Yu-jeong because...

759
00:55:27,782 --> 00:55:29,826
Dad.

760
00:55:31,661 --> 00:55:32,912
-I'm telling you.
-Seriously?

761
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:33,997
Of course.

762
00:55:34,664 --> 00:55:36,291
-Hey!
-Hey, gosh...

763
00:55:36,374 --> 00:55:38,752
Goodness, please, don't do this
so early in the morning.

764
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:40,587
-Oh, my!
-Here, look at this.

765
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:42,505
-Hey, this is how you do it.
-My gosh.

766
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:43,840
You see this, right?

767
00:55:43,923 --> 00:55:46,676
I'll give it a slap
and put it over here for now.

768
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:48,053
Let's start with beer.

769
00:55:48,136 --> 00:55:50,764
-Rock-paper-scissors!
-Rock-paper-scissors!

770
00:55:50,847 --> 00:55:51,848
Gosh!

771
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:54,684
Ji-uk lost.

772
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:56,770
-All right.
-I'm going to drink this.

773
00:55:57,062 --> 00:55:58,855
-Okay, one, two, three. Cheers!
-Cheers!

774
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:01,775
It's because they mean...

775
00:56:03,526 --> 00:56:04,819
a lifetime to me.

776
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:09,074
It's because they were my only friends.

777
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:12,619
-You're back.
-Yes.

778
00:56:13,078 --> 00:56:14,287
Let me see your face.

779
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:15,413
No, it's okay. Go away.

780
00:56:15,830 --> 00:56:18,041
I've been staying up until now
to see your face.

781
00:56:18,124 --> 00:56:19,626
You have to show me...

782
00:56:20,001 --> 00:56:21,002
I got you!

783
00:56:32,847 --> 00:56:34,516
It was a thirty versus two fight.

784
00:56:34,599 --> 00:56:37,477
It was a fierce fight. There were
thirty guys against the two of us.

785
00:56:48,113 --> 00:56:51,908
Gosh, what kind of scums did this to you?

786
00:56:53,159 --> 00:56:54,661
You don't need to know.
They're just jerks.

787
00:56:54,828 --> 00:56:57,789
Call me next time. You know
I'm a fourth-degree taekwondo master.

788
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:04,754
It must sting.

789
00:57:05,004 --> 00:57:06,047
Hold on.

790
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:08,925
Be gentle.

791
00:57:09,801 --> 00:57:10,802
Just a bit more.

792
00:57:13,179 --> 00:57:14,222
The other side too.

793
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:26,734
Sometimes, it doesn't look like
he suffers from insomnia.

794
00:57:38,246 --> 00:57:41,583
I'll cause a big scene
and lie down on the floor.

795
00:57:41,916 --> 00:57:43,793
You should just flip the desk.

796
00:57:44,002 --> 00:57:44,919
Please don't worry.

797
00:57:45,003 --> 00:57:47,714
See how the situation unfolds
and lie on the floor if you have to.

798
00:57:47,797 --> 00:57:49,757
I almost got into the drama department
back in college.

799
00:57:49,841 --> 00:57:51,009
Oh, is that so?

800
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:53,970
I'm glad you didn't go that route.

801
00:58:00,351 --> 00:58:03,980
Hey, you. You better hire Eun-hyeok!

802
00:58:06,649 --> 00:58:10,361
Hey, create a position for him right away.

803
00:58:10,445 --> 00:58:12,489
If you don't, your business will go bust.

804
00:58:12,655 --> 00:58:13,823
Can't you hear me?

805
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:16,117
Hire Eun-hyeok!

806
00:58:16,201 --> 00:58:17,577
-Whatever.
-You little...

807
00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:21,956
What?

808
00:58:23,833 --> 00:58:24,792
That brat...

809
00:58:24,876 --> 00:58:25,835
Next news.

810
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:28,046
The culprit for the murder
of celebrity chef Yang Jin-wu

811
00:58:28,129 --> 00:58:30,215
is yet to be caught.

812
00:58:30,298 --> 00:58:33,801
The police sent fingerprints
and footprints from the scene

813
00:58:33,885 --> 00:58:35,345
to National Forensic Service

814
00:58:35,428 --> 00:58:37,388
and plan to narrow down the suspects.

815
00:58:37,722 --> 00:58:39,516
Recently gaining popularity
as a good-looking chef,

816
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:41,976
-I was a fan of his too.
-the news is shocking many fans.

817
00:58:42,685 --> 00:58:43,686
Why?

818
00:58:44,687 --> 00:58:45,939
He's handsome, you know.

819
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:48,024
-Who?
-Why do you think that?

820
00:58:48,107 --> 00:58:50,109
His acquaintances
continue to give testimonies...

821
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:52,654
Gosh, you have such low standards.

822
00:58:52,737 --> 00:58:55,323
That's what I'm saying.
I can't figure women out.

823
00:59:08,086 --> 00:59:11,256
STAR CHEF'S DEATH SHOCKS EVERYONE

824
00:59:14,759 --> 00:59:16,219
A little while after that...

825
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:20,848
the murder suspect
of Chef Yang Jin-wu gets caught.

826
00:59:24,811 --> 00:59:26,062
Mr. Jung Hyeon-su.

827
00:59:26,604 --> 00:59:29,732
You're under arrest
for the murder of Yang Jin-wu.

828
00:59:30,149 --> 00:59:32,110
You have the right to a lawyer

829
00:59:32,610 --> 00:59:34,445
and to resist an unlawful apprehension.

830
00:59:34,946 --> 00:59:36,155
If you have anything to say...

831
00:59:37,865 --> 00:59:41,286
He could be
another wrongly accused suspect like me.

832
00:59:43,663 --> 00:59:46,249
He's our first client.

833
01:00:08,479 --> 01:00:11,107
This is the definition
of the word, "beginning."

834
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:13,359
The first step
of an act or a circumstance.

835
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:16,613
Or the first step of an emotion.

836
01:00:17,322 --> 01:00:20,783
Make sure you lock your door.
I might accidentally go in.

837
01:00:20,867 --> 01:00:23,828
I'll prosecute you
for robbery and homicide.

838
01:00:23,953 --> 01:00:28,374
Will anyone be able to really
understand and believe me?

839
01:00:28,916 --> 01:00:30,168
How have you been, Ms. Cha?

840
01:00:30,251 --> 01:00:31,586
Let me cut to the chase.

841
01:00:31,669 --> 01:00:32,629
Are you two really dating?

842
01:00:32,712 --> 01:00:34,047
Yes, we are.

843
01:00:34,756 --> 01:00:36,924
I knew it. With me around,
Ji-uk would never--

844
01:00:37,008 --> 01:00:38,134
Right, you are around...

845
01:00:39,344 --> 01:00:40,303
but I chose her.

846
01:00:40,386 --> 01:00:43,473
The suspect, Mr. Jung,
wants me to take on the case?

847
01:00:43,973 --> 01:00:45,683
Why did you choose me?

848
01:00:45,767 --> 01:00:49,354
I thought you might be
my only ray of hope.

849
01:00:49,437 --> 01:00:50,897
How dare you smile?

850
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:54,192
Do you know what day today is?
How could you laugh and smile like that?

851
01:00:54,275 --> 01:00:55,943
Sir, that's...

852
01:00:56,694 --> 01:00:58,321
You can accuse me all you want,

853
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:01,032
but I can't admit
to what I never did, sir.

854
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:03,701
What happened? It's okay. You can tell me.

855
01:01:03,785 --> 01:01:05,119
I don't want to talk about it.

856
01:01:05,286 --> 01:01:07,830
Will you be okay? All right, then.

857
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:11,918
