1
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:33,908
I see.

2
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:38,204
Well... If that's the case,

3
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:39,831
just bring him here.

4
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:43,293
We now know the real culprit anyway.
We should have dinner with him.

5
00:00:43,918 --> 00:00:44,794
All right.

6
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:48,548
Don't make any stops.
Come here right away.

7
00:00:49,924 --> 00:00:52,385
Okay. I got it.

8
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:57,057
What are you planning to do?

9
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:02,437
First of all, he can't slip away
with Bong-hui,

10
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,980
-and...
-And?

11
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,607
We should sound out Jung Hyeon-su.

12
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:09,360
We have no other choice right now.

13
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:16,743
-My gosh.
-Oh, my.

14
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,789
What do you say? How's the food?

15
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:22,707
Everything looks so delicious.

16
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:24,918
-I'm glad to hear that.
-Thank you for the food.

17
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:26,586
You're welcome. I hope you all enjoy it.

18
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:33,468
Right, about the forensic officer,
Go Chan-ho...

19
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:36,554
Do you know that he's now being chased
by the police

20
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:38,598
as the suspect
of the murder of Yang Jin-wu?

21
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:40,141
Yes, I saw it on the news.

22
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:41,643
I see, you saw it.

23
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:43,436
You don't know him personally, do you?

24
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:47,482
No, not at all. I was so surprised to hear
that the killer was a police officer.

25
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:53,947
I came here to tell you this.

26
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:59,536
Bong-hui, I'll be reinvestigating
your ex-boyfriend Jang Hui-jun's case.

27
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,497
I'm not sure if I could find anything now,

28
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:04,707
but I'll try to dig things up.

29
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:08,628
I'll look into the crime scene
and everyone involved thoroughly.

30
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:14,467
Who knows? The killer might be
in this house right now.

31
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:22,058
Anyhow, what do you think
is going on with Go Chan-ho?

32
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:24,144
Would he really be on the run?

33
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:29,858
I'm not sure. I'm really curious too.

34
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:44,747
Hey, Chan-ho.

35
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:46,833
Are you tired already?

36
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:50,461
You look like you're about to die.

37
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:12,525
Did I tell you
that I could have met Go Chan-ho

38
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:14,819
right before his disappearance?

39
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:17,864
The meeting was canceled
rather abruptly, so we couldn't.

40
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:18,907
Right.

41
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,700
-Really?
-Yes.

42
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:25,830
It'd be better if you check
every CCTV footage

43
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:27,999
from Hanmu Park to the spot
where his car was found.

44
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:31,127
Well, it's more likely
that he took the local route

45
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:35,548
instead of the highway,
given the circumstances.

46
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:39,719
Okay. I'll check on it.

47
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:45,016
He's not showing any signs
of agitation. It's not working.

48
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:47,060
The only time...

49
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:50,021
Jung Hyeon-su seemed shaken up was...

50
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,358
Have you ever seen anyone close to you
getting hurt?

51
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:57,695
This jerk was trying to assault a woman.

52
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:00,990
By the way,
check if Go Chan-ho has a crime record

53
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:03,576
regarding a woman or someone.

54
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:08,581
He might have assaulted
or physically abused a woman.

55
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:11,709
This is just my hunch.

56
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:15,922
Hyeon-su, enjoy your food.

57
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:17,966
This is delicious.

58
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:27,475
Wasn't that a boring dinner?

59
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:30,728
Sorry? No, it wasn't.

60
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:36,067
Since you are lawyers and a prosecutor,
you do talk about cases a lot.

61
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,570
The cases weren't good topics for dinner.

62
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:42,740
They weren't.

63
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:45,576
I got a new job.

64
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:48,079
I was going to promote my company,

65
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:49,872
but I didn't get the chance.

66
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,333
I'm a motorcycle messenger now.

67
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,793
-Oh, I see. Really?
-Yes.

68
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:55,586
We use messengers a lot.

69
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:57,088
I can be a loyal customer.

70
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:00,591
By the way,

71
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:03,344
why did you hire Bong-hui as your lawyer?

72
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:08,599
She was famous for being wrongfully
accused. It was similar to my case.

73
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:10,935
Gosh, you are not falling for it.

74
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:15,565
I was curious,
so I was putting feelers out.

75
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:18,651
I heard that there were
many murderers and criminals

76
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:20,862
who approach Bong-hui
with a wrong intention.

77
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,865
Mr. Ji, I think you are very honest.

78
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:25,700
Oh, I'm the opposite.

79
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:26,868
Really?

80
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:44,677
Get home safe.

81
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:45,928
Take care, Hyeon-su

82
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,263
I'll get going. Bye.

83
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:49,640
Bye.

84
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:54,270
You are not going home, Ms. Eun?

85
00:05:54,353 --> 00:05:56,314
Oh, me? He provides me room...

86
00:05:58,483 --> 00:05:59,567
and board.

87
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:01,694
You live here?

88
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,780
No, he's providing me room and board.

89
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:05,990
So you are living here.

90
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,242
Well...

91
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:09,577
Yes, she's living with me.

92
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,873
Why? It's true, Bong-hui.

93
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,794
That's right.

94
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:30,807
I'll help you.

95
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,892
No, there's no need. Go and get some rest.

96
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:35,645
No, you cooked all by yourself.

97
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,066
Give me that, please.

98
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:08,136
The house was crowded a few minutes ago.
Now it's all empty.

99
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:12,890
Don't you think the house feels
so empty now that everyone is gone?

100
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:14,642
Not really.

101
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,103
I like how quiet it is.

102
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:20,481
Don't look at me with those eyes.

103
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:21,566
What?

104
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:25,445
Don't try to charm me with your eyes.

105
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,780
I'm not trying to.
I was just looking at you.

106
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:28,948
Just like this.

107
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:31,826
Get this.

108
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:35,705
Gosh.

109
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:40,710
Do your dishes.

110
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:48,593
Focus on your dishes.

111
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:50,928
I'm completely focused
on washing this dish.

112
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:52,680
-Focus.
-Look, I'm focused.

113
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:53,764
Stay focused.

114
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,822
CLIENT PARK SEONG-EUN

115
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:12,700
Hello, this is Ji Eun-hyeok.

116
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,118
Mr. Ji.

117
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:15,786
Hi. How have you been?

118
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:17,997
My husband...

119
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:20,291
died.

120
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,168
What?

121
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:26,881
I see. Okay.

122
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:29,008
Okay, I'll be right there.

123
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:58,829
Ma'am.

124
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,292
What happened?

125
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:23,813
I'd like to accompany her.

126
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:25,022
Okay.

127
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:34,365
A lawyer has...

128
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:37,952
a legal responsibility to

129
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:40,705
keep the client's secret. Am I correct?

130
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:42,999
Yes.

131
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:45,418
But a lawyer

132
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:47,545
also cannot hide the truth

133
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,297
or make a false statement.

134
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,507
Therefore, we also have
a responsibility to tell the truth.

135
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:53,259
Which one will you choose?

136
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:56,929
Will you tell the truth...

137
00:09:57,888 --> 00:09:59,265
or keep my secret?

138
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:04,437
I...

139
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:07,732
didn't kill my husband.

140
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,191
But...

141
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:12,153
I'm going to confess that I did...

142
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,072
and turn myself in.

143
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:21,037
Will you...

144
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:23,497
keep my secret?

145
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:25,499
A lawyer is

146
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,710
obligated to do two very important things.

147
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:29,920
They're to maintain confidentiality.

148
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:31,881
They also cannot conceal

149
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:35,134
or hide the truth. They're obligated
to tell the truth.

150
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,595
If those two obligations collide
with each other,

151
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:39,513
which one must we choose?

152
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,566
This is the tea you got me...

153
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:52,652
for insomnia.

154
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,281
It tastes very bad,

155
00:10:57,865 --> 00:10:59,867
but I feel like you'll need it today.

156
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:12,546
Bong-hui.

157
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:17,426
You're bothered by Jung Hyeon-su,
aren't you?

158
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,482
What if...

159
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,235
it turns out that...

160
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:39,198
I had asked you to defend a murderer?

161
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:54,338
The presumption of innocence.

162
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:57,174
Have you forgotten that?

163
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,263
He lied about his alibi. That's all

164
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:03,389
that bothers me.

165
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:07,226
Other than that, there's nothing
else I found out about him.

166
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:11,105
You know how I don't like any loose ends.

167
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:12,898
I'm just double-checking.

168
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:15,109
Do you expect me to believe you?

169
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:16,235
Yes.

170
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:17,862
Believe me.

171
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:19,363
You're being serious, right?

172
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:22,658
No.

173
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:24,493
I'm lying.

174
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:30,332
If you find anything,

175
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:33,294
you need to be honest and tell me
about it, okay?

176
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:35,087
Okay.

177
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:37,548
Don't

178
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:39,091
keep anything from me.

179
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:41,635
All right.

180
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:47,892
By the way,

181
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:50,186
that guy, Jung Hyeon-su.

182
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:53,189
I don't care if he's dangerous or not.

183
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:55,232
And I don't care if he's bad or not.

184
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:59,945
I don't want you to meet him
by yourself anymore.

185
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:03,532
Since we're on that subject,
let me tell you this.

186
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:06,410
I want you to always be somewhere

187
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:10,164
I can always keep an eye on you
for 24 hours.

188
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:11,248
I...

189
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:14,293
What I mean is...

190
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:18,422
Twenty-four hours is a bit too...

191
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,466
Well...

192
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:24,345
Isn't that a bit too much?

193
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:29,183
"Twenty-four hours is a bit too much."
Is that what you were going to say?

194
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:34,188
What about 20 hours?

195
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:43,239
How do you drink this?

196
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:44,907
I drink it every day.

197
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:47,535
You bought it for me.

198
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,251
It's so bitter.

199
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:00,047
I drink it every day,
but it's still bitter.

200
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:04,176
It's bitter, but I drink it every day.

201
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:11,392
Jung Hyeon-su reacted to two things.

202
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:14,895
First, when I asked him about the assault
in the reception room.

203
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:17,690
Second, when I asked you
if Go Chan-ho had any issues with women.

204
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:21,151
I'm pretty sure he has an issue
or a trauma regarding women.

205
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:24,154
Should I meet the woman who got assaulted?

206
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:27,575
Yes, but you should be careful.

207
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:29,201
Jung Hyeon-su is not an easy target.

208
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:31,161
I'm not a sloppy investigator either.

209
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:35,749
That's why you're exploiting me
by asking me to do so many things.

210
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,334
It's all because I'm very competent.

211
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:38,794
Yes, I can't argue with that.

212
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:42,047
By any chance,

213
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,341
if we actually end up finding something,

214
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:48,429
I'd still like to keep it to ourselves.

215
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:50,014
You're talking about Ms. Eun, right?

216
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:52,224
If...

217
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,935
Jung Hyeon-su turns out to be guilty,

218
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:57,980
and it turns out we set him free...

219
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:03,652
I shouldn't hide that from Bong-hui,
and I won't be able to anyway.

220
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:08,574
But I just want to help her find out
in a way that she won't get hurt.

221
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:10,659
I want to give her time
to brace herself if possible.

222
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:13,120
Okay.

223
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:22,963
You confessed about your crime yourself.

224
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,635
Her mind was weak due to continuous
domestic violence.

225
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,845
It happened when she was not in her
right mind.

226
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,222
He died because he had a stroke
due to a skull fracture.

227
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,683
To sum up, you pushed him during a fight,

228
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:37,102
and he died because his skull
got fractured after he fell.

229
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,022
After that, you stabbed his stomach
with a kitchen knife

230
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:42,066
even though he was already dead.

231
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:44,276
That's how much I hated him.

232
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:47,404
I couldn't

233
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:49,448
resolve my anger.

234
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,085
I'll be off now.

235
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:13,013
This is an accidental encounter

236
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:14,848
as a prosecutor and lawyer, right?

237
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:16,684
I guess.

238
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:20,229
I noticed that you defended
Eun Bong-hui on her trial.

239
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:21,897
Yes.

240
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:24,566
Do you think she's innocent?

241
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,486
You know that I don't trust
my clients, right?

242
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:31,156
It doesn't matter if I trust them
or if they're telling me the truth.

243
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:33,200
It's just work.

244
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:34,618
But

245
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,537
I trusted Bong-hui.

246
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:39,206
I trusted her when I defended her.

247
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:40,249
Why?

248
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:41,500
I don't know.

249
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:43,794
I just did.

250
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:47,589
Eun-hyeok.

251
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:56,223
Can we have a meal together
once in a while?

252
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:11,447
Park Seong-eun had suffered
from domestic violence for a long time

253
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:13,323
from her husband, Kang Jin-ho.

254
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:14,575
VICTIM: KANG JIN-HO

255
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:15,701
On the day of the incident,

256
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:20,789
her husband was supposed to be gone
for a few days because of work.

257
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,417
But he suddenly came home without notice,

258
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,336
and the two started a fight. In the end,

259
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:29,298
Park Seong-eun pushed her husband,
Kang Jin-ho.

260
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:31,675
Unfortunately, as you can see,

261
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:36,513
her husband ended up dying
of a stroke cause by skull fracture.

262
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:41,351
However, our client, Park Seong-eun,

263
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:44,271
is admitting to her crime
without denying anything.

264
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:46,023
So the defense strategy is

265
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:49,193
that she was weak-minded
because of domestic violence?

266
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:50,819
Exactly.

267
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:53,322
Wait. Just a second.

268
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:56,492
But something's...

269
00:17:57,284 --> 00:17:58,368
strange.

270
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:06,668
It doesn't seem like her husband
assaulted her that day.

271
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:09,671
According to the materials
you've given us,

272
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:13,258
there's no wound on Park Seong-eun's body.
Aren't I right?

273
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:14,343
Yes, you're right.

274
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,554
They just had an argument.

275
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:19,264
It was a spur-of-the-moment thing.

276
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:24,812
All right.
This is their son, Kang Jae-yeong.

277
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:27,731
KANG JAE-YEONG, 24
UNIVERSITY STUDENT

278
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:29,775
I think my mom killed my dad...

279
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,362
out of self-defense.

280
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:36,240
He confessed that his mom
was physically abused by his dad.

281
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:39,576
Well, this is actually a very simple case.

282
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:41,954
I only briefed you on it
because you guys were curious.

283
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:45,207
As always,
I'll figure it all out on my own.

284
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:46,667
Don't worry.

285
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,502
I won't worry. I'll help you instead.

286
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,464
-I'll be fine on my own.
-I'll help.

287
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:54,550
Ms. Eun, let's help him together.

288
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:56,260
Oh, sure.

289
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:57,553
No, Ms. Eun. I'll be fine.

290
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,346
Why not? She'll be able to learn a lot.

291
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:01,598
Then Ms. Eun can help me.
I don't need your help. I decline.

292
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,058
I want to help you too.

293
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,518
Why would you do that?

294
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:06,520
You've asked me for help,

295
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:08,313
but you've never offered help.
What's with you?

296
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:10,482
I didn't want to help you
when you asked me for help,

297
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:12,860
but I'm dying to help you
since you're not asking for help.

298
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:14,862
-Then help me.
-All right, I will.

299
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:16,738
You're supposed to say you won't help me.

300
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:17,990
No, I am going to help you.

301
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:20,742
You don't need to help me.

302
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:21,869
I'll help you.

303
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:25,873
You really don't need to help me.

304
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:27,499
I'm going to help you.

305
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:34,631
Gosh, they're like kids.

306
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:36,008
That's what I'm saying.

307
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:37,718
I'm single,

308
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:40,596
but I feel as if
I'm a father of four kids.

309
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:45,017
-Four?
-Yes, four.

310
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,019
Here comes my eldest son.

311
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:49,563
Hey.

312
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:52,691
Ms. Lack of Evidence,
you walked out during my trial.

313
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:54,484
Hey. My gosh.

314
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:57,696
You better get yourself back here.
Stop right there!

315
00:19:58,864 --> 00:19:59,865
Get back here.

316
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:01,783
Goodness.

317
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:09,708
Your eyes must be exhausted.

318
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,418
Yes, I'm so swamped.

319
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:13,462
I have to dig up
what Go Chan-ho has been up to.

320
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:15,797
Oh, I also have a mountain
of other cases to work on.

321
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:19,593
Gosh, the resolution is so bad.

322
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:23,889
Even the forensic team
won't be able to bump up the resolution.

323
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:25,974
-Right?
-Yes.

324
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:30,604
By the way, I can't believe
that Go Chan-ho is the killer,

325
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:32,356
not Jung Hyeon-su.

326
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:36,610
To be honest,
I don't know what's going on.

327
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:39,613
Same here. I really thought
Jung Hyeon-su was the killer.

328
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:42,366
I know.

329
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:54,920
There's a delivery for you.

330
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:56,880
-Welcome.
-Hello.

331
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:58,882
It's nice to see you
for something work-related.

332
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:02,970
I know, right? Lawyer Ji asked me
to drop off these medical records.

333
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,472
Gosh, hello. I see you working hard.

334
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:06,556
-Hello.
-Hello.

335
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,267
It must be
Park Seong-eun's medical records.

336
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:11,728
I must say, we keep getting
cases nonstop these days.

337
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:13,730
And it's another murder case.

338
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:15,691
-Gosh.
-But this case is different.

339
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,901
The suspect confessed first
that it was her doing.

340
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:20,487
You can get your sentence lightened
by turning yourself in, you know.

341
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:22,656
Oh, really? I see.

342
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:24,574
Everyone knows that.

343
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:26,785
Of course she should get her
sentence lightened. See you.

344
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:42,843
Please.

345
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,888
Please rethink your decision
just once more.

346
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:10,829
Mr. Noh, here you go.

347
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,039
Thanks.

348
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:16,877
Wait, isn't Mr. Byeon
supposed to be in charge of it this week?

349
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:20,213
This sort of just happened.

350
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:24,092
How should I put it? Shall I say
life is about give-and-take?

351
00:22:25,343 --> 00:22:26,636
Do you want to have a seat?

352
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:29,806
What are you reading?

353
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:33,143
Oh, is it the case Mr. Ji took on?

354
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:34,519
Yes.

355
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:39,024
Why are you insisting on helping him,

356
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:41,359
when he keeps saying
he doesn't want your help?

357
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:43,028
Well...

358
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:46,156
Shall I say
it's because he's being weird about it?

359
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:51,036
I don't agree with that.
He's always just weird like that.

360
00:22:51,244 --> 00:22:53,121
You're a pretty good judge of character.

361
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:58,251
I used to think that you're always

362
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:00,087
so obnoxious.

363
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:02,589
Was I like that?

364
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:06,218
Anyhow,

365
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:09,054
I've gone through this document.

366
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:11,306
There's something, isn't there?

367
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:14,935
No, I'm not sure.

368
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:17,229
Gosh, what was that about?

369
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:19,981
But something is bothering me.

370
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:27,656
I think it's possible that someone
was supposed to come by.

371
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:29,783
Well...

372
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:33,620
I think it's odd that his body
was stabbed after he died.

373
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:36,248
Even if she deeply resented him,

374
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:39,835
I don't think there was a need
for such an act.

375
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:41,920
You're right. I agree with you on that.

376
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:45,924
Look at you. You've improved a lot.
You're pretty good now.

377
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:50,971
One more thing. The person
who was supposed to come by

378
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:53,598
could've been their son, don't you think?

379
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:54,683
Their son?

380
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:56,309
He's actually downstairs now.

381
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:58,812
He's preparing for his witness interview
with Mr. Ji.

382
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:19,332
Anyone would think that they're dating.

383
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:22,377
Who?

384
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:24,504
I didn't say anything.

385
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:25,922
I heard something.

386
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:28,717
You were probably imagining things.
Old people can get like that.

387
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,051
That little...

388
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:32,679
What was that about?

389
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:36,808
First,

390
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:40,145
I'll start with questions
that the prosecution might ask.

391
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:42,355
Sure.

392
00:24:43,064 --> 00:24:45,442
For how long has your father been abusive

393
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:47,235
towards your mother?

394
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:50,655
For a long time.

395
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:52,866
For a very long time.

396
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:56,912
He was always violent towards her
for as long as I can remember.

397
00:24:58,205 --> 00:24:59,289
I really...

398
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:03,335
She's my mother, but I pity her so much.

399
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:05,295
If you pity her that much, why did you

400
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:10,592
Let's do it again.

401
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:12,886
All right. Your mother--

402
00:25:12,969 --> 00:25:13,970
Was your father...

403
00:25:15,513 --> 00:25:19,309
only abusive toward your mother,
or did he also abuse you?

404
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:24,522
-Ji-uk.
-Why did you

405
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:26,316
move out of your parents' place?

406
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:28,526
-Lawyer Noh.
-To be fully prepared,

407
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:30,403
you should also be ready
for unexpected questions.

408
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:31,529
Let me handle it.

409
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:35,283
Witness, have you ever thought
that you could get into a fight

410
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:38,954
with your father after you all grew up?

411
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:44,209
I know of someone who's been
through something like that.

412
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:45,961
I should've kept that person safe.

413
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:49,130
There was a kid whom I failed to protect.

414
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:51,925
That's when I had this thought. Right.

415
00:25:52,425 --> 00:25:56,137
When I'm a little older
and have more power and ability,

416
00:25:57,097 --> 00:26:00,725
I shouldn't let anyone fall victim
to such unfairness.

417
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:02,769
How was it for you, Jae-yeong?

418
00:26:06,314 --> 00:26:08,566
All right. I think we can wrap up
the preparation for today.

419
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:11,319
Shall we meet again another time?

420
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:13,571
Yes.

421
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:24,833
Bye.

422
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:34,509
Gosh, what is the matter with you?
Why are you being like this?

423
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:36,011
That's what I want to ask.

424
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:40,056
Hey, Eun-hyeok. Look at me. Come on.

425
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:44,352
I'm always looking at you, Ji-uk.

426
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:46,980
Sure you are. But look at me
in the eye and tell me the truth.

427
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:48,440
What is this about? What truth?

428
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:49,941
Stop joking around.

429
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:56,489
What on earth
are you trying to do now, Ji-uk?

430
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:58,366
You're hiding something. Am I wrong?

431
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,285
-Don't jump to conclusions.
-I want to.

432
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:01,369
What is it?

433
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:03,121
Is he the culprit?

434
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:04,289
Goodness.

435
00:27:08,626 --> 00:27:11,046
Is he? Yes? Tell me.

436
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:17,177
What would you do if he is?

437
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:21,514
Park Seong-eun went out
to get groceries to make dinner

438
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:23,016
for her son who was coming by.

439
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:24,642
But when she got back,

440
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:27,145
she found her husband
collapsed on the floor.

441
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:43,286
Honey.

442
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,789
As soon as she saw her husband
who wasn't supposed to be there

443
00:27:45,872 --> 00:27:47,540
-She got a hunch.
-Honey.

444
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:48,875
"Gosh,

445
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:51,086
my son must've been here."

446
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:52,962
-Honey.
-"The two of them

447
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:54,339
must've had a fight."

448
00:28:26,454 --> 00:28:27,622
So she made a decision.

449
00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:31,084
She decided that she will be
the murderer in place of her son.

450
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:34,129
She decided that she will
take all the blame.

451
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:38,007
Good grief.

452
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:40,009
I see.

453
00:28:41,594 --> 00:28:43,555
-This was the reason?
-So, now you are obligated

454
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:45,974
to confidentiality.

455
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:47,225
Lawyers-at-Law Act, Clause 21,

456
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:49,811
"Lawyers can't disclose information
acquired in line of service."

457
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:51,396
Article 24, Clause 2,

458
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:55,358
"Lawyers can't conceal the truth
while serving their clients

459
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:57,652
or make a false statement."

460
00:28:57,736 --> 00:29:00,071
To me, my client's wish
is the first priority.

461
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:01,781
Which means I'm going
to keep it confidential.

462
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:05,201
You'll put an innocent person in jail
and let the guilty one go? Seriously?

463
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:07,662
I'm trying to persuade her
to make this right.

464
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:09,330
Your persuasion seems to be failing.

465
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:12,208
You have a false confession,
and the trial is around the corner.

466
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:14,586
So what? How and when
are you going to convince her?

467
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:17,505
Even if I can't convince her,
I'm going to comply with her wish.

468
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:19,090
Do you think that's for her own good?

469
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:20,925
Yes, I believe that.

470
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:22,677
Stop being idiotic!

471
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:26,264
Hey, why does she have to sacrifice
for the sake of the criminal?

472
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:27,599
Can't you understand?

473
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:30,101
That's what my client wants.

474
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:33,313
I'm going to give my client
whatever she wants.

475
00:29:33,396 --> 00:29:36,399
So you're going to let
the real murderer go?

476
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:39,736
Hey, Eun-hyeok. Will you be able
to handle the consequences?

477
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:52,540
I must say, that really is a catch-22.

478
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:55,126
He must abide by the code
and keep the client's secret.

479
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:57,962
Who would want to hire a lawyer
who doesn't keep secrets?

480
00:29:58,046 --> 00:29:59,631
No matter what gets decided,

481
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:00,840
just leave them be.

482
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:04,093
All kids fight while growing up.

483
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:17,482
On June 6, 2017, Defendant Park Seong-eun

484
00:30:17,565 --> 00:30:20,819
had an argument with her husband,
Kang Jin-ho, at home

485
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:22,695
and pushed him violently
during the argument.

486
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:26,282
He fell and hit his head hard
on the edge of a stair tread.

487
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:29,369
Eventually, he died of cerebral hemorrhage
and skull fractures.

488
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:32,705
The defendant didn't stop there.
Even after the victim died,

489
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:37,210
she ruthlessly stabbed him
in the stomach with a sharp weapon.

490
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:41,756
Hence, under Article 259, Section 1
and Article 161 of the Criminal Law,

491
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,591
the prosecution moves
to charge the defendant

492
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:45,677
for manslaughter and damaging a dead body.

493
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:49,597
Defense counsel, do you admit
the allegations?

494
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:51,641
Yes, Your Honor.

495
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:54,686
The defendant admits the allegations.

496
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:58,565
However, it was due to her traumatic
stress disorder and depression

497
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:03,528
which she got from being physically
and verbally abused for 20 years.

498
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,446
Please take that into consideration.

499
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:13,621
Are you

500
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:16,541
here to cause a scene by any chance?

501
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:18,418
I am.

502
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:23,923
It's Eun-hyeok's trial,
so I should leave it in his hands.

503
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:25,884
Why would I bother causing a scene?

504
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:27,886
Considering how brutally
the victim was murdered,

505
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:32,098
we cannot accept the counsel's claim
that the defendant was

506
00:31:32,181 --> 00:31:33,683
feeble-minded or mentally defective.

507
00:31:33,766 --> 00:31:35,602
Also, we could not find any evidence

508
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:39,397
or trace that shows
the defendant was physically abused

509
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,107
by the victim on the day of the incident.

510
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:44,110
In other words, what the defendant did
on the day of the incident

511
00:31:44,193 --> 00:31:47,906
was not related to being abused
by her husband.

512
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:52,535
It is true that she wasn't
physically abused that day,

513
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:56,039
but being verbally and physically
abused for 20 years

514
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:58,207
gave her severe depression.

515
00:31:58,499 --> 00:32:02,378
Hence, her mental state
must be taken into consideration.

516
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:33,493
Mr. Kang, just a second.

517
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:38,831
I'd like to ask you something.
Is that okay?

518
00:32:42,251 --> 00:32:45,672
Mr. Bang, get me all the documents
related to the Park Seong-eun case.

519
00:32:47,006 --> 00:32:48,007
All right.

520
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:52,762
LAWYER EUN BONG-HUI

521
00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:57,934
Don't work too hard.

522
00:32:58,559 --> 00:32:59,811
Thank you.

523
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:28,965
By the way,

524
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:30,758
what's the matter with her?

525
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:35,680
I know this because I gave her a lot
of work when I first met her.

526
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:39,559
When she's working on something
challenging or has to use her brain a lot,

527
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:41,811
she gets like that.

528
00:33:41,894 --> 00:33:43,938
Yes, I've seen her like that too.

529
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:45,815
Her hair used to look so messy.

530
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:47,775
Soon, her hair will get all greasy too.

531
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:50,695
When she works, she...

532
00:33:55,658 --> 00:33:56,784
She doesn't really shower.

533
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,289
Gosh.

534
00:34:08,337 --> 00:34:09,881
-Mr. Noh.
-Yes.

535
00:34:10,631 --> 00:34:12,925
Gosh, yes.

536
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:14,802
You're here.

537
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:18,347
I got a lot done in the last three days.

538
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:22,560
Right, I can see that.

539
00:34:22,643 --> 00:34:25,021
I met with Park Seong-eun
and her son, Kang Jae-yeong.

540
00:34:25,104 --> 00:34:27,106
I met the doctor
as well as the autopsy examiner.

541
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:29,192
I went to the scene too.

542
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:32,111
Oh, it does sound like you got a lot done.

543
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:35,364
All right, that's all great.
But I'm just wondering...

544
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:36,908
Your hair and...

545
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:40,036
Have you been walking around like this?

546
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:41,579
Yes. Is there a problem?

547
00:34:41,704 --> 00:34:42,789
No, not at all.

548
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:44,457
It's fine.

549
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:46,793
There's no problem at all. It's great.

550
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:48,711
-Then hear me out.
-Okay.

551
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:52,381
The first thing I thought was strange
took place at the court.

552
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:55,426
I know this because I've been locked
up in the detention center.

553
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:59,097
What I hated the most was that my
mom would be worried about me.

554
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:01,933
Both my mom and I
acted like we were totally fine.

555
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,103
But...

556
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,856
I noticed that Park Seong-eun
and her son were doing the same thing.

557
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:11,567
"I'm okay. Don't worry about me."

558
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:13,486
They were saying that to each other
with their eyes.

559
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,363
Isn't it strange?

560
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:16,989
They clearly love each other.

561
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:20,952
How could the son let his mom
take all the blame for what he did?

562
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:22,995
I couldn't understand.

563
00:35:23,704 --> 00:35:24,914
I regret it so much.

564
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:27,375
I should've just stayed home.

565
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:30,378
Then none of this would've happened.

566
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:32,505
What do you mean by that?

567
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:35,007
Dad, you're always like this.

568
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:37,385
I'd rather have you gone!

569
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:39,053
How dare you!

570
00:35:39,178 --> 00:35:42,849
How could you glare at me like that
and talk back to me?

571
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:45,393
Shall I beat you up
to put some sense into you?

572
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:47,854
Why did you even have me?

573
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:51,357
Why did you bring me into this world
if you can't take responsibility?

574
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:54,360
If you're not going to disappear,

575
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:56,320
I should.

576
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:58,364
On the day of the incident, the son...

577
00:35:58,447 --> 00:36:00,449
-left after arguing with his dad.
-You little...

578
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:03,786
-That was the last time he saw him.
-Hey!

579
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:08,374
On the other hand, when Park Seong-eun
last saw her husband...

580
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:12,503
He was dead.

581
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:16,799
She assumed that it was her son's doing

582
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:18,509
because he was supposed to come by.

583
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:22,346
Hence, she went ahead
and stabbed her dead husband

584
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:25,683
in order to take all the blame,
willfully damaging the body.

585
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:31,522
Then what on earth happened between
the two points in time

586
00:36:31,647 --> 00:36:33,357
for her husband to have been found dead?

587
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:38,905
From robbery to an accident,
I thought of all possible scenarios.

588
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:41,115
This is my dad's medication.

589
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:48,206
Why has no one thought of checking
the husband's medical records?

590
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:49,332
ANTIHYPERTENSIVE

591
00:36:49,415 --> 00:36:52,418
Kang Jin-ho's doctor suspects
that he might have...

592
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:04,805
suffered cerebral hemorrhage
by ruptured cerebral aneurysm.

593
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:09,060
Please request an in-depth postmortem.

594
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:12,897
The examiner might have missed it
due to the visible wounds.

595
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:15,983
The doctor said it'll come out
in an in-depth postmortem.

596
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:28,412
Come here.

597
00:37:28,537 --> 00:37:29,538
Sorry?

598
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:39,215
Don't get the wrong idea. This hug is...

599
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:41,759
from your senior lawyer.

600
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:44,804
-That's an excuse, isn't it?
-Yes.

601
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:46,430
My goodness, come on.

602
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:50,935
Bong-hui, you are...

603
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:58,901
You are dirty, but you are...

604
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:02,405
so pretty.

605
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:09,412
I returned the favor with my hard work.

606
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:12,581
That's right. You did return the favor...

607
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:16,419
You returned the favor with work.

608
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:19,255
You did. You've grown a lot as a lawyer.

609
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:20,506
Good job.

610
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:24,218
Goodness.

611
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:29,223
This is the report of the second autopsy.

612
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,226
AUTOPSY REPORT

613
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:35,479
The cause of death was a brain hemorrhage
by a brain aneurysm.

614
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:40,067
Ergo, the manslaughter charge
of Park Seong-eun will be dropped.

615
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:42,445
We will prosecute her
for abuse of a corpse.

616
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:46,032
I'm glad.

617
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:49,618
I called in Park Seong-eun
because of the autopsy report.

618
00:38:49,952 --> 00:38:51,620
You can go and tell the news personally.

619
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:58,544
Thank you, Prosecutor Cha.

620
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:03,049
Me too.

621
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:06,260
Stop it. I know that you two
aren't really grateful.

622
00:39:16,562 --> 00:39:17,605
Goodness.

623
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:51,931
Bong-hui, what are you doing over there?

624
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:55,976
Where are you going?

625
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:57,937
Let go. Let go of my arm.

626
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:02,108
Why are you being friendly?
What do you want from me?

627
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:04,610
I don't want anything from you.
Come on, Bong-hui.

628
00:40:04,693 --> 00:40:06,737
You are such a hyena.

629
00:40:07,154 --> 00:40:08,197
A hyena?

630
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:12,326
Bong-hui,

631
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:16,205
when did your relationship
with Mr. Noh begin?

632
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:20,126
Hey, relax. Can't I ask you a
question as a colleague?

633
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:22,044
I told you not to mention Mr. Noh

634
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:24,296
or get him involved in
whatever you are trying to pull.

635
00:40:25,881 --> 00:40:28,259
It started at the hotel, didn't it?

636
00:40:29,176 --> 00:40:31,137
-What?
-I mean the hotel...

637
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,304
where you caught Hui-jun.

638
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:34,265
It started right then, didn't it?

639
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:37,268
How do you know that?

640
00:40:37,351 --> 00:40:39,103
What do you mean? I saw...

641
00:40:40,187 --> 00:40:42,565
What? You saw something?

642
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:45,359
No. I mean...

643
00:40:46,193 --> 00:40:47,403
I got confused.

644
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:49,405
I heard. I think I heard it.

645
00:40:49,488 --> 00:40:52,199
The girl in a yellow dress
who was with Hui-jun...

646
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:00,207
It was you, right?

647
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:07,590
Well, why is that important now?

648
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:09,091
-The important thing is...
-Right.

649
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:10,718
It's not important.

650
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:14,138
Cheating is nothing to make a fuss over.

651
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:16,223
It's the least thing
I'm concerned about, but...

652
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:19,226
But you were the one who bullied me

653
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:21,020
and said I was unethical.

654
00:41:21,103 --> 00:41:22,313
How do you sleep at night?

655
00:41:22,396 --> 00:41:24,732
Don't you dare hit me.

656
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:26,984
-I'm going to hit you back.
-What is this?

657
00:41:27,067 --> 00:41:28,736
Hey, let go of my hair.

658
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:30,070
You, let go first.

659
00:41:30,362 --> 00:41:31,780
Let go first. Let go of me.

660
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:34,241
-I told you to let go of me.
-Gosh, let me go.

661
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:36,202
-Hey, Na Ji-hae.
-Hey.

662
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:37,411
Hold on. Hold on.

663
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:39,705
Let go of her. Let her go.

664
00:41:39,788 --> 00:41:41,248
What are you doing?

665
00:41:41,415 --> 00:41:42,791
What about her?

666
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,045
Excuse me? Oh, right.
Bong-hui, let go of her hair.

667
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,129
-Let go of me.
-Do it now.

668
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:48,631
-Let go of her hair.
-Let go of me.

669
00:41:48,714 --> 00:41:50,090
Come on, Bong-hui.

670
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:51,759
-Whatever.
-There you go.

671
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:55,596
Goodness, you... What are you doing?
That was so uncivilized.

672
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:58,224
I guess you two are quite close.

673
00:41:58,307 --> 00:41:59,975
I told you to mind your own business.

674
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:01,352
You little...

675
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:03,896
Gosh, that was so unsophisticated.

676
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:09,693
This is embarrassing.

677
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:13,030
Goodness.

678
00:42:13,113 --> 00:42:15,074
-Shoot.
-Darn.

679
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,372
-Go.
-Unbelievable.

680
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:42,309
Take the next one, please.

681
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:49,483
What's wrong with him?

682
00:42:49,858 --> 00:42:51,193
Why? They look cute.

683
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:55,906
I'm going to take the stairs too.

684
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:03,289
Hey!

685
00:43:21,515 --> 00:43:23,559
Oh, I'm fine. I'm all right.

686
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:27,855
I have a lot of hair. So getting
a few hair plucked is nothing.

687
00:43:28,981 --> 00:43:30,357
I don't like that.

688
00:43:35,195 --> 00:43:36,488
Don't try to flirt with me.

689
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:39,867
Is it working?

690
00:43:40,492 --> 00:43:41,452
Not at all.

691
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:45,331
Then what should I do...

692
00:43:49,251 --> 00:43:50,294
to make this work?

693
00:43:58,594 --> 00:44:00,220
You're not breathing again, are you?

694
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:06,268
Wait, I think it worked.

695
00:44:12,399 --> 00:44:14,401
By the way, I feel so proud of myself.

696
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:16,904
You should be. You deserve it too.

697
00:44:18,405 --> 00:44:20,949
I think moms are amazing.

698
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:25,454
How can they sacrifice
to go to prison for their children?

699
00:44:27,247 --> 00:44:29,333
I agree. They are truly amazing.

700
00:44:31,418 --> 00:44:32,961
I like you,

701
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:35,339
but I want to see my mom more today.

702
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:38,926
Bong-hui, you just said
that you like me. You did, right?

703
00:44:39,259 --> 00:44:40,469
No, I didn't. I don' know.

704
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:45,432
I should go see my mom today
just like you, Bong-hui.

705
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:04,743
My daughter said that
when she makes a lot of money,

706
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:07,204
she'd send me on a trip around the world.

707
00:45:07,329 --> 00:45:12,042
My son sent me on trips countless times.

708
00:45:12,626 --> 00:45:14,837
My daughter is really considerate.

709
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:19,049
That's the important factor,
her love for me.

710
00:45:20,467 --> 00:45:22,386
You think my son isn't considerate?

711
00:45:22,469 --> 00:45:26,432
He cares deeply about me.
You don't know the half of it.

712
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:28,892
My daughter does too.

713
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:29,977
Yeong-sun,

714
00:45:30,644 --> 00:45:34,314
why are you speaking so casually
to me all of a sudden?

715
00:45:35,607 --> 00:45:38,527
I'm sick of her calling me.

716
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:43,866
Mom.

717
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:45,993
My daughter!

718
00:45:47,536 --> 00:45:48,662
Come here.

719
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:51,832
I missed you.

720
00:45:53,667 --> 00:45:56,336
What a sight.
They see each other all the time.

721
00:45:56,503 --> 00:45:58,338
They are putting on a show.

722
00:46:00,382 --> 00:46:01,550
What brings you here?

723
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:04,052
I came here to see you.

724
00:46:04,678 --> 00:46:07,055
I miss my son too.

725
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:20,027
Mom,

726
00:46:21,528 --> 00:46:22,613
I'm here.

727
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:28,494
THE LATE KIM MI-YEON

728
00:46:28,577 --> 00:46:29,661
Your son,

729
00:46:30,704 --> 00:46:32,080
Ji-uk is here.

730
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:39,421
I'm sorry...

731
00:46:41,924 --> 00:46:43,675
for not visiting you more often.

732
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:51,725
Goodness, I miss you more than ever today.

733
00:46:58,357 --> 00:46:59,441
My dear mom.

734
00:47:17,042 --> 00:47:18,085
Hello?

735
00:47:18,961 --> 00:47:20,921
Oh, hi. How have you been?

736
00:47:21,755 --> 00:47:22,756
Yes.

737
00:47:26,593 --> 00:47:27,761
Oh, really?

738
00:47:31,431 --> 00:47:33,433
I got it. Thank you so much.

739
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:35,310
Okay.

740
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:50,075
JUNG HYEON-SU

741
00:48:05,966 --> 00:48:08,969
Do you remember that I have
a criminal record regarding assault?

742
00:48:09,803 --> 00:48:13,181
I just got a call from the woman
I helped back then.

743
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:15,392
She told me that someone came to see her

744
00:48:15,475 --> 00:48:18,854
and asked about me and the incident.

745
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:27,654
My gosh, how did you know?

746
00:48:29,615 --> 00:48:32,659
I'm sorry if I offended you.

747
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:33,744
I'm really sorry.

748
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:38,081
No, you don't need to apologize.

749
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:39,833
But I'd like to ask you something.

750
00:48:40,792 --> 00:48:43,795
Why do you continue to keep an eye
on me and doubt me?

751
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:46,256
What did I do wrong?

752
00:48:46,506 --> 00:48:47,674
What did I do?

753
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:52,846
I really like you guys, but why
do you keep doing this to me?

754
00:48:54,056 --> 00:48:55,474
Because you lied to me.

755
00:48:55,557 --> 00:48:56,642
I lied?

756
00:49:07,402 --> 00:49:08,779
Mr. Noh, have you...

757
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:12,074
Have you never lied in your life?

758
00:49:12,824 --> 00:49:17,621
On average, people lie at least
10 to 200 times a day.

759
00:49:17,704 --> 00:49:20,582
People can't live without telling a lie.
That's the truth.

760
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:21,625
Did you know that?

761
00:49:21,708 --> 00:49:22,751
No, I didn't.

762
00:49:23,251 --> 00:49:25,587
Do people really lie that much?

763
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:27,923
Okay, let's say that's the case.

764
00:49:28,173 --> 00:49:31,218
But don't you think it's important
to differentiate what kind of lie...

765
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:34,888
it is?

766
00:49:35,722 --> 00:49:37,766
What in the world did I lie about anyway?

767
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:40,560
Do you even know what it is?

768
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:41,812
No, I don't.

769
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:46,024
If I knew, I wouldn't be here right now.
Don't you think so?

770
00:49:49,736 --> 00:49:52,864
But seriously, I'm sorry
if I offended you in any way.

771
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:55,534
It's just a habit I had
ever since I was a prosecutor.

772
00:49:55,617 --> 00:49:58,245
If something bothers me,
I need to look into it.

773
00:49:58,328 --> 00:50:00,163
To be honest, I did look into you.

774
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:01,665
But I couldn't find anything.

775
00:50:01,748 --> 00:50:02,874
That was the end of it.

776
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:04,710
It's over.

777
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,336
From now on,

778
00:50:06,753 --> 00:50:10,215
I won't go around and ask people
about you. I promise.

779
00:50:16,972 --> 00:50:18,181
It sounds like you're lying.

780
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:19,182
Yes. How witty.

781
00:50:19,266 --> 00:50:20,684
Gosh, I'm very witty.

782
00:50:20,767 --> 00:50:22,602
It's not very classy though.

783
00:50:26,815 --> 00:50:28,233
Okay.

784
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:31,695
Let's meet again with Ms. Eun one day.

785
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:37,868
I'd love to,

786
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:42,164
but I don't have time these days
because I'm so busy.

787
00:50:42,247 --> 00:50:43,623
I'll think about it though.

788
00:50:43,915 --> 00:50:45,000
Okay, then.

789
00:50:46,168 --> 00:50:47,961
You should hurry up and drink.
The ice will melt.

790
00:50:56,386 --> 00:50:57,637
My drink became cold.

791
00:51:12,694 --> 00:51:13,862
Go Chan-ho.

792
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:16,281
Go Chan-ho is the culprit?

793
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:28,084
Is something wrong?

794
00:51:29,878 --> 00:51:30,879
What?

795
00:51:36,343 --> 00:51:37,344
No.

796
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:41,348
You look like you're concerned
about something.

797
00:51:42,307 --> 00:51:43,350
Not at all.

798
00:51:45,018 --> 00:51:48,063
Do you have anything to tell me?

799
00:51:49,022 --> 00:51:50,065
Not yet.

800
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:51,733
No.

801
00:51:51,817 --> 00:51:52,818
About what?

802
00:51:53,068 --> 00:51:54,319
Well...

803
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:57,864
It also seems like you want to
tell me something.

804
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:02,869
No, I don't have anything to tell you.

805
00:52:09,209 --> 00:52:11,127
In order to hide a big lie,

806
00:52:12,045 --> 00:52:13,088
people sometimes

807
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:15,966
confess a small truth.

808
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:21,263
Bong-hui.

809
00:52:24,432 --> 00:52:26,101
I'd like to talk to you...

810
00:52:27,018 --> 00:52:27,978
about anything.

811
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:37,028
Shall we talk about my family?

812
00:52:58,842 --> 00:53:00,468
I went to see my mom earlier.

813
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:05,098
She must've been happy to see her son.

814
00:53:21,948 --> 00:53:23,158
Just like that.

815
00:53:27,787 --> 00:53:28,705
Spread it evenly.

816
00:53:28,788 --> 00:53:29,873
I'm here, Mom.

817
00:53:30,415 --> 00:53:32,000
My goodness, Ji-uk!

818
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:41,217
-By the way,
-Yes?

819
00:53:41,426 --> 00:53:42,761
I went to see...

820
00:53:43,094 --> 00:53:44,971
my mom today.

821
00:53:45,972 --> 00:53:47,015
You did?

822
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:50,435
I also dreamed about

823
00:53:50,518 --> 00:53:52,479
your mother yesterday.

824
00:53:52,979 --> 00:53:54,105
Really?

825
00:53:55,357 --> 00:53:56,358
Yes.

826
00:53:57,943 --> 00:53:58,818
I...

827
00:53:59,736 --> 00:54:00,904
have two mothers.

828
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:04,366
My current mother...

829
00:54:07,452 --> 00:54:09,871
is my biological mother's friend.

830
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:13,041
My goodness.

831
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:16,711
How can he be so handsome, dashing,

832
00:54:17,045 --> 00:54:20,215
lovely, adorable, and smart?

833
00:54:21,216 --> 00:54:23,009
You can even tell that he's smart?

834
00:54:23,885 --> 00:54:26,554
Of course. I can tell right away.

835
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:30,058
He's my son too, you know.

836
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:34,521
You have two moms.

837
00:54:34,604 --> 00:54:35,855
Okay?

838
00:54:40,235 --> 00:54:41,945
My gosh, he's adorable.

839
00:54:45,865 --> 00:54:47,200
When I was young,

840
00:54:47,826 --> 00:54:49,494
I lost both my parents in a fire accident.

841
00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:52,539
My dad died first.

842
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:56,042
And...

843
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:58,920
my mom got transferred to a hospital.

844
00:54:59,587 --> 00:55:00,880
She died...

845
00:55:02,007 --> 00:55:03,133
not too long after that.

846
00:55:04,926 --> 00:55:05,927
I'm...

847
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:09,222
going to be your mom now.

848
00:55:10,515 --> 00:55:11,975
I'm your mom, Ji-uk.

849
00:55:13,268 --> 00:55:14,477
Okay?

850
00:55:30,076 --> 00:55:31,077
Don't cry.

851
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:37,208
My goodness, my son.

852
00:55:37,292 --> 00:55:39,127
My precious son.

853
00:55:40,086 --> 00:55:42,589
I miss you even when I'm looking at you.

854
00:55:42,964 --> 00:55:46,092
Mom, stop it. People will think that
I'm a mother's boy.

855
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:48,470
Why? What's wrong with that?

856
00:55:48,928 --> 00:55:50,638
It's wrong on so many levels.

857
00:55:53,558 --> 00:55:55,935
Why do you keep coming here, Mr. Byeon?

858
00:55:56,227 --> 00:55:59,105
My gosh, am I not allowed to
come to my wife's restaurant?

859
00:55:59,272 --> 00:56:00,231
What do you think, Ji-uk?

860
00:56:00,315 --> 00:56:02,609
I'm sure she's acting like this for
a reason.

861
00:56:02,692 --> 00:56:05,111
Your mom's taking it too far.

862
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:07,030
She won't even let me come home.

863
00:56:07,113 --> 00:56:08,782
When did I do that?

864
00:56:08,907 --> 00:56:11,201
I just told you to stay out of my
sight. I don't want to see you.

865
00:56:11,284 --> 00:56:14,037
Exactly. Why don't you want to see me?

866
00:56:14,162 --> 00:56:18,124
I don't know what's going on,
but it's all your fault, Mr. Byeon.

867
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:20,835
Why do you keep calling me Mr. Byeon

868
00:56:20,919 --> 00:56:22,420
when you call her Mom?

869
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:24,547
That's because I'm always on Mom's side.

870
00:56:24,714 --> 00:56:25,965
That's a given.

871
00:56:26,049 --> 00:56:27,217
My goodness.

872
00:56:28,802 --> 00:56:31,971
Mr. Byeon, why don't you buy
10 boxes of pizza to go?

873
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:40,313
I see.

874
00:56:41,314 --> 00:56:42,273
Yes.

875
00:56:44,192 --> 00:56:45,193
I'm in a similar situation.

876
00:56:47,362 --> 00:56:48,279
I...

877
00:56:49,531 --> 00:56:50,740
have two dads.

878
00:56:52,992 --> 00:56:53,993
Really?

879
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:02,001
I'll tell you

880
00:57:02,335 --> 00:57:03,378
my story next time,

881
00:57:04,003 --> 00:57:05,004
if I have the chance.

882
00:57:08,633 --> 00:57:09,634
Okay.

883
00:57:23,648 --> 00:57:25,775
Then shall we go sleep?

884
00:57:27,026 --> 00:57:28,027
What?

885
00:57:29,779 --> 00:57:32,699
No, I just meant that we should
both go to our rooms and...

886
00:57:34,325 --> 00:57:36,286
What were you thinking? Are you crazy?

887
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:38,788
-Oh, right.
-Goodness.

888
00:57:39,247 --> 00:57:41,207
What was that about?
You're really something.

889
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:26,169
Good night.

890
00:58:31,216 --> 00:58:32,342
If you...

891
00:58:33,384 --> 00:58:35,553
can't fall asleep,

892
00:58:35,845 --> 00:58:38,139
you should think
that I'm right beside you...

893
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:40,517
It's up to you.

894
00:58:43,436 --> 00:58:45,271
Can you just stay by my side?

895
00:58:46,439 --> 00:58:47,482
No, I can't!

896
00:59:13,508 --> 00:59:15,343
Goodness.

897
01:00:22,327 --> 01:00:23,870
You two look so cute together.

898
01:00:34,839 --> 01:00:36,549
BONG-HUI'S DIARY

899
01:00:38,301 --> 01:00:40,261
MY DEAREST MOM
PARK YEONG-SUN

900
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:42,555
LITTLE BONG-HUI

901
01:00:47,602 --> 01:00:49,979
WITH MY BELOVED DAD

902
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:56,861
Dad.

903
01:00:58,529 --> 01:00:59,572
Sweet dreams.

904
01:01:41,656 --> 01:01:43,658
