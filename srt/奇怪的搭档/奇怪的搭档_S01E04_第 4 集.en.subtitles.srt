1
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:01,686
I MET LAWYER NOH AT COURT.
I THINK HE KNOWS THAT I'M STALKING HIM.

2
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:29,005
I couldn't even date him.

3
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:31,674
How many times do I have to get dumped?

4
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:02,580
"If you keep looking for me,
I'll find you first"?

5
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:22,767
Other than for work-related things
or bumping into you unexpectedly,

6
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:26,521
I'll stay at least 100m away
from you at all times.

7
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:29,524
I have no feelings for you whatsoever.

8
00:02:29,607 --> 00:02:31,526
Really. I'm serious. Please believe me.

9
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:34,654
Gosh, seriously. What is she thinking?

10
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:54,048
LAWYER NOH JI-UK

11
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:57,594
-Mr. Noh.
-You left--

12
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:58,553
Someone

13
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:00,054
was in my office.

14
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,306
What?

15
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:03,099
That guy was in my office.

16
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:05,852
The real culprit who killed Hui-jun.

17
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:09,188
Hey, what did you just say?
Who was in your office?

18
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:15,069
I think...

19
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:17,739
he might...

20
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:22,952
still be here.

21
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:31,586
Hey, Bong-hui. Don't act rashly now.

22
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:32,962
I'm going to be there shortly.

23
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:36,090
So please just be safe. Hello?

24
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:45,558
It's you, isn't it?

25
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:18,132
Hey, Bong-hui!

26
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:20,969
Are you all right?

27
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:23,471
Are you okay?
I'm asking if you are all right.

28
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:26,975
I missed him right in front of my eyes.

29
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:30,270
This is aggravating and maddening.

30
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:50,290
It's too late tonight.

31
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:55,628
Should I ask to send
a forensic team or not?

32
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:56,796
Please do.

33
00:04:57,171 --> 00:05:00,258
But you can't be certain
that he was the real culprit.

34
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:01,718
I'm pretty sure he is.

35
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:05,305
By the way, it's been a long time
since you resigned as a prosecutor.

36
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:08,850
You should quit acting like a prosecutor
investigating a case.

37
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:11,686
You should quit nagging me,
and just have a good night!

38
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:13,021
Please!

39
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,943
-Is the forensic team coming?
-Hey.

40
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:20,903
What was that?

41
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:24,699
The culprit's fingerprints might be here,
and you were sitting on it.

42
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,327
-What about the forensic team?
-My gosh, I don't know.

43
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:30,830
He should know
that criticism is good for him.

44
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,960
Is he still bothered by that case?

45
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:41,716
I was looking around my office like this.

46
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:45,053
But I felt...
It's hard to describe in words.

47
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:47,805
But I suddenly had goosebumps
all over my body.

48
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:52,310
That's when I knew
that either a person or a ghost must be

49
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:53,936
in this office.

50
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,396
Right then, I heard the door close.

51
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:59,025
So I slowly turned around.

52
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:01,235
I had left the door open,
but it was closed.

53
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:03,321
I almost fainted,

54
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:04,655
but I pulled myself together,

55
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:06,074
and quickly

56
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:08,159
chased after him. For goodness' sake.

57
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:11,746
But that jerk had already hidden
himself among the crowd.

58
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:14,791
There were so many people
even though it was a late hour,

59
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:18,628
so I couldn't tell who was whom.
Everyone looked like him.

60
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,089
I was scared that he might
hit me from behind

61
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:22,632
or stab me with a knife.

62
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:24,383
I'm not even joking.

63
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,094
Of course, you're not.

64
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:27,261
Exactly.

65
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:30,181
-But it still seems like a joke.
-Who do you mean?

66
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:34,102
You look really excited right now.

67
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:35,645
-Me?
-Yes.

68
00:06:38,397 --> 00:06:40,942
You don't seem to know
what kind of situation you were in...

69
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:44,320
or how dangerous it was.

70
00:06:44,403 --> 00:06:48,950
You don't seem to realize
you could've seriously gotten hurt.

71
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:50,993
How should I put this?

72
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:53,329
You're talking as if you're watching
a thriller movie.

73
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:56,374
You just seem like an agitated kid.

74
00:06:57,333 --> 00:07:00,336
Are you worrying about me now?

75
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:01,504
Of course.

76
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:07,593
Anyone would be.

77
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:12,140
I'd feel the same way if a stranger
had gone through this kind of thing.

78
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:13,266
Why?

79
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:15,726
Because I used to be a prosecutor
who fights crime.

80
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:19,188
Right.

81
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:20,898
Right?

82
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:24,986
The culprit's sudden appearance
made me totally forget about

83
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,530
the promise I made 30 minutes ago

84
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:31,993
that I would stop liking this man.

85
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:33,119
What?

86
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:35,580
-Why are you staring at me like that?
-Wake up.

87
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:36,581
What?

88
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:39,167
It's nothing. I was talking to myself.

89
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,838
You said I seemed very excited.

90
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:46,716
Yes, you're right.

91
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:47,800
It's true.

92
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:49,844
Isn't it natural?

93
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:54,056
I got to see the culprit
who's been hiding for the past two years.

94
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:56,934
It was a chance to clear my name.

95
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:58,102
You could have died.

96
00:07:58,186 --> 00:07:59,270
I'll die anyway.

97
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:01,731
-Are you kidding me?
-I'm already

98
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:03,816
this close to dying because of hunger.

99
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:05,943
That's different from getting murdered.

100
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:07,987
What's the difference?

101
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,199
Look at the condition of my office.

102
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,951
I'm on the verge of going bankrupt.

103
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:16,913
I'm desperate for a job
because I have to earn a living.

104
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:20,249
But no one wants to hire me.

105
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:21,918
Why?

106
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:25,338
Because I'm a murderer who killed
the son of the prosecutors' office chief.

107
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:27,298
I've been completely ostracized.

108
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,011
When I opened this law firm,
the news headline read,

109
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:35,848
"A Nation-Wide Famous Murderer
Becomes an Lawyer."

110
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:38,684
My mom...

111
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:41,854
pretends like she's fine
when she's with me.

112
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,231
But she cries when I'm not there,

113
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:46,025
because she's upset about
her daughter being blamed.

114
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:53,074
So I have to solve this case
not only for myself,

115
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:54,492
but also for my mom,

116
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:58,329
and you who lost a job because of me.

117
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:05,086
I'm just saying that I'm really happy
that the culprit showed up.

118
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:10,341
Okay.

119
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:13,553
Catch the culprit.

120
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,222
-Of course.
-Together.

121
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:17,473
What?

122
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,142
Let's catch him together.

123
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:25,189
Let's go now. Come on.

124
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:28,985
What? Where are we going?

125
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,195
Your home. I'll give you a ride.

126
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:34,198
This is my home.

127
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:42,206
Why aren't you coming?

128
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,250
I came because you kept on begging,

129
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:46,502
but I don't know if I should.

130
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:48,921
What? When did I beg you?

131
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:52,133
I told you that I'd keep my distance
from you by at least 100m.

132
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:55,511
But you said you can't leave me alone
in such a dangerous place.

133
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,430
What a load of nonsense.
When did I say that?

134
00:09:57,513 --> 00:10:00,808
You're the one who kept insisting
and dragged me here.

135
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:03,102
Don't you think
you're dramatizing it a bit too much?

136
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:06,022
So I won't take responsibility
for whatever that may happen

137
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,398
from now on.

138
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:12,862
Hey. What does that mean?

139
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:15,031
What does that mean, Bong-hui?

140
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:20,411
My goodness.

141
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:23,039
Nothing much has changed.

142
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,374
Was it two and a half years ago?

143
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,210
I came here only once,
but I remember everything.

144
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:32,423
I remember this sofa
and even that display cupboard over there.

145
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:35,384
We were completely
wasted that night, so...

146
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:11,754
By the way,

147
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:13,255
don't you think

148
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:17,134
we have a few things to talk about?

149
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:21,555
-Yes, we do.
-Right?

150
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:23,599
We do need to clarify something.

151
00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:25,101
We need to get things straight.

152
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,353
-We finally think the same way.
-Yes, finally.

153
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:33,567
-To be honest, I--
-Did we sleep together?

154
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:38,322
What are you talking about?

155
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:40,616
-Was this not the topic?
-No, of course not.

156
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:42,660
I guess I was mistaken.

157
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:45,996
I thought this was
the only clarification we needed.

158
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,588
Eat some kimchi.

159
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,476
You overslept?

160
00:12:09,728 --> 00:12:11,856
You overslept? What's your secret?

161
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:13,190
You have insomnia.

162
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:15,818
I found out that when humans
get exhausted beyond their limit,

163
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,945
they end up getting knocked out.

164
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:18,946
Why?

165
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:20,614
What made you so exhausted?

166
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:21,949
You don't need to know. Don't ask.

167
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:23,534
Don't even talk to me. Get lost.

168
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:25,327
Well, anyway,

169
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:28,622
you're probably the only guy
who gets congratulated for being late.

170
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:31,333
You're also probably the only boss
who would congratulate his worker

171
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:32,376
for being late.

172
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,961
Did you just push me?

173
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:37,715
Hey, I actually came here to scold you.

174
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:38,716
Is that so?

175
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:40,926
That's right. You should know that

176
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,304
there are a lot of complaints about you.

177
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:45,347
The employees
don't even want to run into you.

178
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:47,600
They think you look down on them.

179
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:49,602
I guess they're not completely dumb.

180
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:51,896
-I guess so.
-You can't do this.

181
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:53,856
Work on your social skills.

182
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:56,609
And sometimes you need to
take the cases that you don't like.

183
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:58,569
-Okay.
-You'll get fired at this rate.

184
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:00,196
-Okay.
-I'm sitting on pins and needles

185
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,406
-because I actually recruited you.
-Okay.

186
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:04,116
You're not

187
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,285
-listening to me, are you?
-No.

188
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:08,829
My goodness. You little punk.

189
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:11,290
My gosh.

190
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:15,419
Since when have you been
watching me, Bong-hui?

191
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:18,714
Mr. Noh, you're late.

192
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:22,301
The sun will be up and high soon.

193
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,530
You're late for work.

194
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:45,199
You need to wake up.

195
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:50,264
I'm so embarrassed.

196
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:51,807
-Sorry?
-What?

197
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:55,603
No, it was nothing.
I was just talking to myself.

198
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:57,313
Okay.

199
00:14:58,397 --> 00:14:59,982
Thank you so much.

200
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:01,317
Did you get anything?

201
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,653
I'm not sure yet.
A lot of people have visited this office,

202
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:06,071
so I don't know what we'll get.

203
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:07,406
Please do your best.

204
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:11,118
I must get something from this,
whether it's a fingerprint or DNA.

205
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:13,746
Did you check the building's CCTV footage?

206
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:16,540
He wore a hat
and cleverly avoided showing his face.

207
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:18,042
I couldn't see his face on the footage.

208
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:20,002
Then you should at least
make a composite sketch.

209
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:21,670
You must have seen his face.

210
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:25,591
Unfortunately,
I didn't see his face either.

211
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:27,635
Gosh, that's too bad.

212
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:44,276
Is there anything I can help you with?

213
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,322
May I get a glass of water?

214
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:50,324
-Of course. Just a moment, please.
-Sure.

215
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:22,523
Have you found anything?

216
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:23,607
No.

217
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:28,612
-I'm so sorry.
-It's okay.

218
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:30,239
-I'll wipe it.
-No, I'll clean it up.

219
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:31,782
Gosh, don't worry about it.

220
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,320
FORENSIC INVESTIGATION IN THE OFFICE

221
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:17,244
FORENSIC INVESTIGATION IN THE OFFICE

222
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:20,372
Why did the culprit
show up at this timing?

223
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:31,967
-Thank you.
-I'll stop by later if I can.

224
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:38,057
Yes, come in.

225
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:42,936
-Oh, no.
-What?

226
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:46,398
Mr. Bang, it's you!

227
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:49,485
Yes. Mr. Noh asked me to do this,
so I took time

228
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:52,696
out of my extremely busy schedule
to come all the way here.

229
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,199
My gosh, I see. Thank you.

230
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:57,534
By the way, I met your landlord
on my way here.

231
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:59,912
He said your electricity and water
will be cut off as of today.

232
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:01,997
He'll cut off my electricity and water?
Starting today?

233
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:05,584
-That's way too harsh.
-He said he's put up with enough.

234
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:08,003
You're so behind
on your rent and utility bills

235
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:11,799
that your rent deposit is almost gone.
He really wants you gone.

236
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:13,092
That's it.

237
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:18,013
This is the copy of the CCTV footage
from the dates you asked for.

238
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,224
Great. Thank you for your cooperation.

239
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:21,391
Thank you.

240
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:25,854
It's no use checking the footage
because I don't know his face.

241
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,524
We can't get their customers list
without a warrant, right?

242
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:31,401
I'll have to refuse if you ask me
for a warrant. I'll get fired.

243
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:35,614
Of course, I won't.
I'm already beyond grateful for your help.

244
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:37,658
I'm glad that you know.

245
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:42,704
By the way, I feel like
you're being very cold to me today.

246
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,873
It's just a feeling I'm getting.
Am I right?

247
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:49,086
You're right. I'm punishing you
for getting disappointed to see me.

248
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:53,006
Gosh, that was...
I was disappointed in myself.

249
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:55,968
I'm trying to turn off my feelings
for someone,

250
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:58,762
but I'm having a hard time with it
and keep hoping to see him.

251
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:01,640
I'm serious.

252
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:04,768
I think I know who that someone is.

253
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,436
-Sorry?
-It's probably Mr. Noh.

254
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,814
Gosh! How did you know?

255
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:11,650
I saw you stalking him
from afar a few times.

256
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:14,486
I guess I made it too obvious.

257
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,364
Don't worry. He has no idea.

258
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:19,908
He must know. I mean, even you know.

259
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:23,036
When he was a prosecutor,
his assistant clerk

260
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,455
had a crush on him for two years.

261
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:28,500
Everyone knew, but he had no idea.

262
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:31,545
-Are you serious?
-He is very sharp,

263
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:34,548
but when it comes to feelings,
especially women's, he's clueless.

264
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:37,801
Gosh, that's so mean.
I wish he had figured it out.

265
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,511
He would never.

266
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,054
I see.

267
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:43,974
I thought he figured out
that I've been stalking him.

268
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:45,934
I bet 50,000 won he didn't.

269
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:52,024
Make it under 30,000 won,
you'll breach the Kim Young-ran Act.

270
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:53,942
Oh, right. The Kim Young-ran Act.

271
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:13,086
Noh Ji-uk and Eun Bong-hui were together?

272
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:14,546
Yes, sir.

273
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:18,926
From what I heard,
they haven't been in touch

274
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:20,302
for the last two years.

275
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:22,137
That's what I thought too,

276
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:25,515
but they looked pretty close
when I saw them yesterday.

277
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:28,227
That bastard...

278
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:45,285
I've been actually thinking
about asking you to come by.

279
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:47,871
You came to me first.

280
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:50,832
I'll just cut to the chase.

281
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:54,127
I had to visit
Lawyer Eun Bong-hui's office yesterday.

282
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,963
-Did you?
-Yes.

283
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,090
And I spotted a car
in front of her office.

284
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,383
Drive safely.

285
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:00,884
Hey...

286
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:11,103
At first, I just thought
that it was parked in the alleyway.

287
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:12,354
Then,

288
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:15,941
I happened to walk by there a few times...

289
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:20,696
and kept noticing it for some reason.
And I saw its license plate,

290
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:25,075
and it was an official state car.
Is it okay to use it like that?

291
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:27,202
She killed my son.

292
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,037
I checked what she's up to
from time to time.

293
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:31,957
Very occasionally,
I got someone else to do it for me.

294
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:35,585
Can't I even do that when I lost my son?

295
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:39,506
But the problem is
it's considered illegal surveillance.

296
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:40,507
So?

297
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:42,676
Are you here to interrogate me?

298
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:44,136
No, of course not.

299
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,014
I was just wondering if you have
a dashboard camera in that car.

300
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,766
I need footage of that alleyway
at that hour.

301
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:54,688
Your car was the only vehicle
that was parked there.

302
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:56,606
Why do you need the footage?

303
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,692
Someone might have been captured in it.

304
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:03,697
Unfortunately,
there's no dashboard camera in my car.

305
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:07,492
Well, all of you higher-ups
usually like to discuss

306
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:09,077
confidential matters in your cars,

307
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:11,788
so I thought
there might not be any footage.

308
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:15,125
Okay, then. Thank you for your time.

309
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:18,670
What is it that you're looking for?

310
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:24,926
Do you believe Eun Bong-hui's claim?
Are you after the real culprit?

311
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:26,928
-Yes.
-Let me ask you again.

312
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:29,890
Eun Bong-hui claims
that she's not the real culprit.

313
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:32,476
Have you seen the real culprit?

314
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:35,520
Then how can you believe her?

315
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:37,022
It's not her that I believe.

316
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,941
I believe the circumstantial evidence.

317
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:41,234
What if you're wrong?

318
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:45,655
If that's the case,
I'm letting a killer prance around.

319
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:48,617
What would you do if you're wrong?

320
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,327
She's free now anyway.

321
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:52,829
What's the problem?

322
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:56,750
-Free?
-I'm on the verge of going bankrupt.

323
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:59,920
I'm desperate for a job
because I have to earn a living.

324
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:03,131
But no one wants to hire me.

325
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:04,841
Why?

326
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:08,303
Because I'm a murderer who killed
the son of the prosecutors' office chief.

327
00:23:08,678 --> 00:23:10,013
I've been completely ostracized.

328
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:11,932
I thought so too,

329
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:15,852
but she's actually not that free.

330
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:18,730
If she's innocent,

331
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:20,857
we'll have to pay
for what we've done to her.

332
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:22,275
I wrongly charged her,

333
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:25,028
and you even fabricated evidence
to peg her as the culprit.

334
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:29,074
If she's guilty,

335
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,827
you'll have to pay the price too.

336
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:44,089
Hey, Ji-uk.

337
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:46,216
Why are you coming out of there?

338
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:50,929
The chief will tell you about it.
I should go.

339
00:24:00,438 --> 00:24:02,232
Just spread the truth.

340
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,444
Tell everyone that Ji-uk showed up here
and caused a scene,

341
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:09,739
which utterly infuriated me.

342
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:12,325
If the word spreads...

343
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:15,996
Everyone around him
including the lawyers at the firm

344
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:19,958
will blame him whenever they lose a case.

345
00:24:21,459 --> 00:24:24,212
They'll completely forget
about their own incompetence.

346
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:31,261
They'll think they got unfavorable rulings
because of Noh Ji-uk

347
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:33,680
and that's why they lost.

348
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:36,391
Everyone will blame and resent him.

349
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:41,980
You said it's for a gift.
Is it for your husband?

350
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:44,149
I don't have a husband.

351
00:24:44,482 --> 00:24:46,359
Then it must be for your boyfriend.

352
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:48,069
I don't have that either.

353
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:50,155
It's for a lady.

354
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:51,489
For your daughter?

355
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:54,201
I don't have a daughter.

356
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:56,912
Then whom is it for?

357
00:24:57,871 --> 00:25:01,082
I can make a better recommendation
once I have the age and gender.

358
00:25:01,499 --> 00:25:03,043
She's around my age.

359
00:25:03,501 --> 00:25:05,712
She must be a friend of yours.
Then let's look here--

360
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:07,464
She's an enemy, not a friend.

361
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:08,798
Pardon me?

362
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:13,803
She tries to boss around her clients
just because she's a good masseuse.

363
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:16,181
She refuses to book me in
since we had a little argument.

364
00:25:16,264 --> 00:25:18,391
She keeps saying she's fully booked.
Back to back.

365
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:24,022
Do I have to give her flowers,
so I can just get a massage from her?

366
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:26,358
I really hate this.

367
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:27,943
I'll visit often.

368
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:29,402
Please do, Director.

369
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:31,154
This is a gift from all of us.

370
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:32,489
You didn't have to.

371
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:34,074
It's a small gift.

372
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:35,659
How can you give me a small gift?

373
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:37,202
You might as well just give me a big one.

374
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:41,039
-Director! Goodness.
-Director!

375
00:25:46,294 --> 00:25:49,089
I know how hard they try
to save every cent.

376
00:25:49,756 --> 00:25:51,883
This is a living proof
that you led a good life so far.

377
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:54,511
You are so popular. You received a
gift on the day of your retirement.

378
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:55,971
You think so too, right?

379
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:58,556
I guess I'm quite well-liked by others.

380
00:25:58,765 --> 00:25:59,766
You sure are.

381
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:04,312
What are we going to do
with your wrists? They are ruined.

382
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:07,941
At my age,
things start to fall apart anyway.

383
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:09,859
This is the law of nature. What can I do?

384
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:11,194
You should take a rest now.

385
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:13,446
I know I'm not successful yet,
but soon I will--

386
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:14,572
I'm fine.

387
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:17,867
I'm still going to work. I'll find a job
that doesn't require my wrists.

388
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:19,327
Gosh, Mom.

389
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:21,579
I'll work even if you become successful.

390
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:23,915
That's my secret of staying young.

391
00:26:27,585 --> 00:26:28,670
She retired?

392
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:30,171
You didn't get a call?

393
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:32,007
No, I didn't.

394
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:33,258
That's weird.

395
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:37,137
She said she personally gave a call
to every VIP client.

396
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:38,471
What?

397
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:40,515
Why did she forget me?

398
00:26:40,598 --> 00:26:42,559
Why didn't she give me a call?

399
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:44,978
How can this be possible?

400
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:49,024
Ji-uk,

401
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:52,277
I've never been humiliated like this
in my entire life.

402
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:55,280
No one has ever treated me like this.

403
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:57,282
That's nothing to cry about though.

404
00:26:58,742 --> 00:26:59,701
Okay.

405
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:03,038
Have a warm cup of tea
before going to sleep.

406
00:27:03,621 --> 00:27:04,581
Okay.

407
00:27:09,627 --> 00:27:11,171
Did you get into trouble again?

408
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:13,965
I heard you had a big fight
with the chief.

409
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:17,844
-And the CCTV footages from the shoe shop?
-That's not important right now.

410
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:19,512
No, that is the important issue.

411
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:24,351
There were no male customers
in the footages.

412
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:28,396
He could've had someone buy them for him
or bought them at a different store.

413
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,357
Goodness. How are we going to
search every store?

414
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:31,900
I don't think that will be possible.

415
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:33,985
The authorities aren't even helping us.

416
00:27:35,653 --> 00:27:38,031
Well, we have to

417
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,657
find a way.

418
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:44,621
I don't know what has gotten into you
all of a sudden.

419
00:27:44,954 --> 00:27:46,664
You told her to get lost.

420
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:49,167
I don't know why you are still hung up
on a case of two years ago.

421
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:52,962
All of a sudden,

422
00:27:53,546 --> 00:27:55,173
this thought came across my mind.

423
00:27:57,384 --> 00:27:58,676
If I didn't

424
00:27:59,552 --> 00:28:01,471
prosecute Bong-hui--

425
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:03,556
Then another prosecutor
would have prosecuted her.

426
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,058
That's right, but...

427
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:08,520
You know how I have a clear conscience
and am very responsible.

428
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:10,480
-Sure.
-I'm strict to the others, but

429
00:28:10,563 --> 00:28:12,857
-I'm even more strict to myself.
-Of course.

430
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:15,193
-As the conscience of the legal circle--
-Of course.

431
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:17,779
I keep getting this feeling...

432
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:24,536
annoyingly protective feeling
when it comes to Eun Bong-hui.

433
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:29,666
You don't look so annoyed though.

434
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:31,418
You look rather excited and happy.

435
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:32,752
No way.

436
00:28:33,002 --> 00:28:36,297
Why would I be excited?
All my good days are gone.

437
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:39,092
You know I hate getting involved
in anything that concerns Eun Bong-hui.

438
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:40,593
I don't really know about that.

439
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:51,896
You might be annoyed,
but you sure are drinking a lot tonight.

440
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:52,856
It's good.

441
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:57,110
For the last two years
without Bong-hui in my life...

442
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:59,863
Mr. Noh, I can't sleep lately.

443
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:01,865
I have been seriously mistreated!

444
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:03,116
...it was completely safe...

445
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:08,580
and calm.

446
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:12,333
Mr. Noh, can this really happen?

447
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:13,334
How can love be a crime?

448
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:15,086
The line between today and yesterday...

449
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:18,590
and the line between today
and tomorrow were blurry.

450
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:21,593
Yesterday was like today.

451
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:26,431
Today will become tomorrow.
The days were mundane.

452
00:29:32,645 --> 00:29:34,606
No one ever invaded my life.

453
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:46,284
They were peaceful days
on which I also didn't invade

454
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:47,744
other people's lives.

455
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:51,581
After I met Bong-hui, everything...

456
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:54,459
got messed up.

457
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:59,130
I met a stalker.

458
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,551
The real culprit resurfaced.

459
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:06,930
My space...

460
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:09,641
has been invaded.

461
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:26,157
It's dangerous and tiring,

462
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:27,742
but it's never boring.

463
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:29,619
That's a day with Bong-hui.

464
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:38,336
He definitely told me I could stay
until the forensic results come out.

465
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:41,464
No, I can't do this. I'm asking too much.

466
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:44,676
This isn't the time
to think about my pride.

467
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:46,177
I'm about to die.

468
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:48,680
Fine. I should appeal to his sympathy.

469
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:54,352
I had every intention
to stay in my office,

470
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:56,104
but the water and electricity are cut off.

471
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:58,106
I can live with no lights,

472
00:30:58,189 --> 00:31:00,108
but I can't live without water.

473
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:01,359
-I see.
-Oh, my!

474
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:03,361
-Goodness!
-Hey.

475
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:05,572
-Are you all right?
-You startled me!

476
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:07,490
Really?
I didn't know you would be startled.

477
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:09,117
-Shoot.
-Are you sure you're okay?

478
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,493
What if you're not hurt?

479
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:12,537
You did get hurt, didn't you?

480
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:13,705
Oh, no. What shall we do?

481
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:15,123
That's all right. I'm fine.

482
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:16,875
-Are you sure you're fine?
-Yes.

483
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:18,877
By the way, I'm drunk.

484
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:20,211
Sorry?

485
00:31:20,336 --> 00:31:21,337
I said I'm drunk.

486
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:30,638
I think it'd be better
to go to the hospital.

487
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:33,057
I sprained it only slightly.

488
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:34,058
I'm fine.

489
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:36,603
Allow me.

490
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:40,398
Mr. Noh?

491
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:41,733
Are you all right?

492
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:46,654
Yes.

493
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:06,215
I don't think you have insomnia.

494
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:12,096
I can't fall for him again.
Don't fall for him.

495
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:00,645
If she's innocent,

496
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:02,522
we'll have to pay
for what we've done to her.

497
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:05,566
If she's guilty,

498
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:07,944
you'll have to pay the price too.

499
00:33:11,614 --> 00:33:13,449
I thought you would be different
from your dad.

500
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:17,870
I was wrong.

501
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:19,664
What is that supposed to mean?

502
00:33:19,747 --> 00:33:22,375
You probably think you corrected
the prosecution's mistake

503
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:24,752
and brought justice.

504
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:26,754
No, that's where you are wrong.

505
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:28,965
You are the one who made a huge mistake.

506
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:31,551
Just like your father.

507
00:35:14,153 --> 00:35:15,029
RENTAL LISTINGS

508
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:23,704
The room is so small,
but it's so expensive.

509
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:29,085
If only I was shameless enough
to continue living there.

510
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:05,997
What should I do?

511
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:30,188
Here.

512
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:37,069
Put that down.

513
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:40,698
Why are you pretending like
it's yours when it's not?

514
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:43,910
Who does she think she is? Let's go guys.

515
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:48,039
Do you know committing larceny with others
makes it special larceny?

516
00:36:48,122 --> 00:36:49,457
What a laugh.

517
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,666
My gosh.

518
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:52,752
My arm.

519
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:55,546
Let go.

520
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,797
You little...

521
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:10,186
Are they perverts?

522
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:18,486
You perverts!

523
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:47,974
-Get moving.
-Hurry up.

524
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:49,517
So, you were a prosecutor.

525
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:52,979
Yes. Those jerks were unlucky.

526
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:55,231
Exactly. By the way,

527
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,900
-I'm a lawyer.
-Really?

528
00:37:58,067 --> 00:38:00,653
My gosh, what a coincidence.
It's nice to meet you.

529
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:01,821
Me too.

530
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:05,366
You must have injured your leg.

531
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:15,626
You didn't have to
come to the hospital with me.

532
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:17,545
You got hurt because of me.

533
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:19,797
No, it was because of those punks.

534
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:22,008
You're right.

535
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:25,136
Don't worry. They said I'll be fine
in a week or two.

536
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:29,724
I'm sure we'll run into
each other in the future.

537
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:31,100
Maybe in court or some other places.

538
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:32,685
You're right.

539
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:37,106
I feel like I made a new friend.

540
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,859
-Me too.
-I really like

541
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:41,485
people like you.

542
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:44,488
I'm the one who should be saying that.

543
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:46,699
I'll see you again.

544
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:48,117
You should go now.

545
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:52,204
How nice.

546
00:38:54,623 --> 00:38:55,666
How nice.

547
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:03,215
Hey.

548
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:07,553
-What--
-It's nothing serious.

549
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:12,058
You should've gone to the hospital
yesterday when I told you to.

550
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:14,226
That's not it. This is from...

551
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:16,979
How is it? Is your bone okay?
Did you fracture it?

552
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:18,981
-Are you okay?
-Yes, I'm fine.

553
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:20,983
Let me tell you what happened.

554
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:22,276
Let me...

555
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:25,988
Let me sincerely apologize.

556
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:28,157
-Sorry?
-I'm sorry,

557
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:29,867
Bong-hui.

558
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:34,997
Well, it's not exactly because of...

559
00:39:42,004 --> 00:39:44,006
You did hurt me, but I'm fine.

560
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:47,802
You don't need to feel too sorry.
Just enough will do.

561
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,763
Wait.

562
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:52,681
Excuse me for a minute.

563
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:04,985
I'll just give you a piggyback.

564
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:06,612
Get on.

565
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:09,240
-Do you think you can manage that?
-Of course.

566
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:13,702
There we go.
Should I take you to your room?

567
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:14,703
Yes, please.

568
00:40:26,048 --> 00:40:27,675
Are you okay? Do you need anything?

569
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:30,594
-Water?
-Okay.

570
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:46,444
Mr. Noh, can I have that snack over there?

571
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:47,611
Which one?

572
00:40:47,736 --> 00:40:49,113
That strawberry-flavored one.

573
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:54,160
Thank you.

574
00:40:59,915 --> 00:41:00,875
It's hot.

575
00:41:16,223 --> 00:41:18,517
May I sit with you?

576
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:21,103
You've already been following me around.

577
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:25,941
I graduated the same high school
and college as you.

578
00:41:26,025 --> 00:41:28,319
Really? Then I'll just
speak to you comfortably.

579
00:41:28,402 --> 00:41:29,445
Of course.

580
00:41:30,779 --> 00:41:34,950
To be honest, you were always
my role model.

581
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:37,286
I wanted to meet you
right after I became a prosecutor,

582
00:41:37,369 --> 00:41:39,330
but you were away in the US
for your Master of Laws.

583
00:41:39,413 --> 00:41:41,624
I was sad that you weren't here,
but you also seemed so cool.

584
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:43,918
I didn't go to the US
because I wanted to study.

585
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:46,754
I had cheated on my boyfriend,
so I went there as an escape.

586
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:58,724
I was the one who cheated.

587
00:41:59,141 --> 00:42:00,226
Me too.

588
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:11,278
I slept

589
00:42:11,403 --> 00:42:12,613
with my friend's boyfriend.

590
00:42:13,322 --> 00:42:14,698
You were a bitch.

591
00:42:15,449 --> 00:42:16,450
I was, indeed.

592
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:17,910
-Who's the guy?
-Sorry?

593
00:42:17,993 --> 00:42:20,496
You need a partner to cheat.

594
00:42:20,996 --> 00:42:22,289
Well...

595
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:26,335
What about you?
Who was the guy you slept with?

596
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:28,963
I forgot.

597
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:32,675
My gosh, that's so cool.
You forgot about him just like that.

598
00:42:32,758 --> 00:42:34,301
That's the only way I can go back.

599
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:36,971
-To whom?
-To the ex-boyfriend I betrayed.

600
00:42:37,763 --> 00:42:40,307
I'm going to visit him and pretend like
I forgot about what happened.

601
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:45,312
You really are a mean person.

602
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:48,482
That's right. I'm going to beg him

603
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:49,984
for forgiveness.

604
00:42:57,908 --> 00:43:00,536
You made me receive
a disadvantage in court.

605
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:02,580
Do you even know
how serious the situation is?

606
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:04,373
-Hey.
-What?

607
00:43:04,456 --> 00:43:06,166
Do this outside.
Why are you doing this here?

608
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:08,043
I'm talking to him face-to-face.

609
00:43:08,127 --> 00:43:09,378
-Let's go outside.
-Let go of me.

610
00:43:09,461 --> 00:43:11,463
-Come on.
-Let go!

611
00:43:13,465 --> 00:43:14,883
My gosh, seriously.

612
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:17,177
Your trial was a risky one
from the beginning.

613
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:20,014
Everyone's already gone through it.
Don't you agree?

614
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:22,349
It's not just this case.
Everyone's talking.

615
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:24,768
We're getting mistreated
in court because of him.

616
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:26,895
Who's spreading that kind of rumor?

617
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:28,105
Cut it out!

618
00:43:29,231 --> 00:43:30,899
How dare you raise your voice here!

619
00:43:34,486 --> 00:43:37,906
My gosh, Chief Prosecutor Jang...

620
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:39,950
That bastard!

621
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:44,913
People will blame Ji-uk for
every single trial they lose.

622
00:43:44,997 --> 00:43:46,165
I'm sure they will.

623
00:43:46,415 --> 00:43:49,501
They'll also blame me for
their incompetency and lack of effort.

624
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:51,962
They'll also blame me for

625
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:53,547
not having enough evidence or data. Why?

626
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:56,133
Because people find it easier
to blame others

627
00:43:56,258 --> 00:43:58,135
than to acknowledge their own problems.

628
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:01,305
My goodness, you are so smart.

629
00:44:01,388 --> 00:44:03,932
You really are very smart.

630
00:44:04,224 --> 00:44:05,934
But why did a smart guy like you

631
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:09,104
have a fight with the chief
of the District Prosecutors' Office?

632
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:11,523
My gosh, what a headache.

633
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:12,608
Are you okay?

634
00:44:12,941 --> 00:44:15,653
-You are full of anger.
-And why do you think that is?

635
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:18,322
You should try eating temple food.

636
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:22,493
No, thank you. I'm not going to eat
a bowl full of vegetables.

637
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:25,204
Anyway,

638
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:28,248
you guys should go
and reconcile with your co-workers.

639
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:31,251
Get to know them a little.
Have a few drinks with them.

640
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:32,336
Hey.

641
00:44:33,253 --> 00:44:35,130
Don't even try to talk back.

642
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:36,965
I'm already close with the others.

643
00:44:39,259 --> 00:44:41,970
What are you talking about?
They don't like you either.

644
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:44,515
Everyone says that you're pretty arrogant.

645
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:46,100
Good grief.

646
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:48,102
Me?

647
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:55,984
Yes.

648
00:44:57,236 --> 00:44:59,113
I'll vacate the space until next week.

649
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:01,490
Please believe me.

650
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:03,242
Yes.

651
00:45:03,992 --> 00:45:05,452
Okay. Have a good day.

652
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:13,252
I can only turn on my computer
with electricity.

653
00:45:13,335 --> 00:45:16,130
I need to turn on my computer
to look for jobs and places to stay.

654
00:45:16,338 --> 00:45:19,466
I'm on a cheap plan,
so I can't even use my data freely.

655
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:22,886
What does this guy want now?

656
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:24,221
WOO HUI-GYU

657
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:27,015
Hey, I'm totally not excited
to hear your voice.

658
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:28,100
What's up?

659
00:45:29,476 --> 00:45:30,394
What?

660
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:33,981
Are you serious?

661
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:36,316
Yes, okay. Of course.

662
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,695
Hey, thank you so much.
You're such an awesome friend.

663
00:45:56,628 --> 00:45:57,629
What?

664
00:46:20,068 --> 00:46:21,570
Let's order another bottle of soju.

665
00:46:23,572 --> 00:46:24,615
Have a seat, guys.

666
00:46:28,243 --> 00:46:29,286
What now?

667
00:46:33,665 --> 00:46:35,167
-Come have a seat.
-Hurry up.

668
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:36,293
Sit.

669
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:47,471
I've seen you on TV and newspapers,
but you look much better in person.

670
00:46:47,554 --> 00:46:48,514
Isn't she?

671
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:51,725
Yes, she's always so put together.

672
00:46:52,392 --> 00:46:54,353
She sure doesn't look like a killer.

673
00:46:56,021 --> 00:46:57,105
Thank you for the compliment.

674
00:46:57,231 --> 00:47:00,025
I heard this is an interview.
Shall I introduce myself first?

675
00:47:00,108 --> 00:47:02,402
You're already famous,
so there's no need to introduce yourself.

676
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:04,321
Let's chill and talk over a drink.

677
00:47:04,446 --> 00:47:05,697
Sure, that sounds good.

678
00:47:06,365 --> 00:47:09,159
-Let's order right away.
-Okay.

679
00:47:11,453 --> 00:47:13,455
-Show us what you can do.
-Bring it on.

680
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:15,290
Show us.
This is your chance to impress us.

681
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:16,667
Hey! My goodness.

682
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:18,669
Nice. How refreshing.
I showered in alcohol.

683
00:47:18,752 --> 00:47:20,003
Now, it's my turn.

684
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:24,633
-All right, here we go!
-Let's do it.

685
00:47:24,716 --> 00:47:25,759
There!

686
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:28,220
-Nice.
-This is awesome!

687
00:47:28,303 --> 00:47:29,304
All right.

688
00:47:29,638 --> 00:47:31,348
-Give me one.
-Hey.

689
00:47:31,473 --> 00:47:33,767
-Gosh, thank you.
-Thanks.

690
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:35,644
I've been waiting for this day.

691
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:37,604
Let's hit it!

692
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:39,648
-Let's hit it!
-Cheers!

693
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:46,446
Is she trying to get a job there?

694
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:47,698
How would I know?

695
00:47:47,781 --> 00:47:49,199
-You don't?
-No.

696
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:50,492
I don't even want to know.

697
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:54,663
I know a little bit about that law firm.

698
00:47:55,497 --> 00:47:56,748
Last year,

699
00:47:57,332 --> 00:47:58,500
they did something.

700
00:48:00,669 --> 00:48:02,421
-You said you don't want to know.
-Right.

701
00:48:04,339 --> 00:48:05,382
Gosh, I'm...

702
00:48:06,592 --> 00:48:07,634
Shall I tell you?

703
00:48:09,469 --> 00:48:10,554
No, it's all right.

704
00:48:10,762 --> 00:48:12,014
I actually don't know either.

705
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:15,726
You lunatic.

706
00:48:23,984 --> 00:48:24,985
Bong-hui.

707
00:48:30,782 --> 00:48:33,285
Of course, I'd bump into you
as this is a law firm district.

708
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:36,079
This makes me feel like
I've become a successful lawyer.

709
00:48:36,163 --> 00:48:37,414
This feels nice.

710
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:39,249
Likewise.

711
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:41,585
By the way, why are you...

712
00:48:42,794 --> 00:48:45,631
Why are you drinking with those guys?

713
00:48:45,797 --> 00:48:46,757
What do you think?

714
00:48:46,882 --> 00:48:49,009
It's like a preliminary interview.

715
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:52,387
Does that make sense to you?
Who does a job interview at a bar?

716
00:48:52,471 --> 00:48:54,306
Whether it makes sense or not,
I don't care.

717
00:48:54,389 --> 00:48:57,225
No matter what it is,
I must hold onto it and make it mine.

718
00:48:57,351 --> 00:49:00,395
Hey, I get that you're desperate,
but that's like a rotten rope--

719
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:01,772
Even if it's rotten,

720
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:04,608
it's the only thing I got.

721
00:49:04,691 --> 00:49:06,151
It's not the only opportunity.

722
00:49:06,234 --> 00:49:07,110
If you keep looking--

723
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:08,320
Mr. Noh.

724
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:12,282
I don't have time to keep looking.

725
00:49:15,243 --> 00:49:16,745
Look at me now.

726
00:49:17,704 --> 00:49:19,331
I'm trying hard to act like I'm okay,

727
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:24,336
and I'm inconveniencing you
by staying at your place.

728
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:28,507
I can't keep being this shameless forever.

729
00:49:40,727 --> 00:49:43,146
-Right.
-I keep drinking for everyone else.

730
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:46,400
We've...

731
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:48,443
made our decision.

732
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:49,611
Ms. Eun.

733
00:49:50,362 --> 00:49:51,321
You're in.

734
00:49:51,405 --> 00:49:53,365
Seriously? You're giving me the job?

735
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:56,535
Thank you so much. I really appreciate it.

736
00:49:56,618 --> 00:49:57,536
Hey!

737
00:49:57,619 --> 00:49:58,745
-Sit down.
-Okay.

738
00:49:59,621 --> 00:50:02,165
You really owe me one.

739
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:04,292
I helped you out big time.

740
00:50:04,376 --> 00:50:07,087
I know. Thanks so much.
I'm really thankful.

741
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:08,839
You're very personable.

742
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:10,757
You're perfect for visitations.

743
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:15,512
It'd be great if you can wear things
that look classier and sexier.

744
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:17,848
Our clients

745
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:21,852
love short skirts and revealing tops.

746
00:50:21,935 --> 00:50:23,186
Excuse me.

747
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:27,190
I'm sorry, but I don't quite understand
what you're saying.

748
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:29,901
-What?
-Well...

749
00:50:30,402 --> 00:50:32,821
I'm sure you know
what visitation lawyers do.

750
00:50:32,904 --> 00:50:36,616
There's nothing difficult about the job.
You just have to go there.

751
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:40,454
All you need to do is
visit our clients at penitentiaries,

752
00:50:40,537 --> 00:50:43,123
and say things like,
"Gosh, I see. I understand."

753
00:50:43,206 --> 00:50:44,791
That's all there is to it.

754
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:46,960
All right, let's drink up first.

755
00:50:47,419 --> 00:50:49,629
-Okay.
-Let's drink. Come on.

756
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:52,549
-Hey.
-Raise your glass. Let's drink.

757
00:50:52,674 --> 00:50:53,675
Hey.

758
00:50:55,969 --> 00:50:57,471
Why didn't you tell me?

759
00:50:58,930 --> 00:50:59,848
About what?

760
00:51:01,641 --> 00:51:03,226
Why didn't you tell me from the beginning?

761
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:07,397
Why didn't you tell me
that this was for a visitation role?

762
00:51:07,981 --> 00:51:09,232
Bong-hui.

763
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:12,319
I thought you already knew.

764
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:14,571
Short skirts?

765
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:16,782
And revealing tops...

766
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:20,911
What do you think women are?

767
00:51:25,874 --> 00:51:28,043
You don't need to waste your energy
on jerks like them.

768
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:30,337
And you shouldn't waste your drink either.

769
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:34,090
I'll drink this.

770
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:43,600
Let's go, Lawyer Eun.

771
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:46,478
Let's go, Lawyer Noh.

772
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:52,442
Bong-hui, it was... I was just...

773
00:51:53,568 --> 00:51:55,987
"Lawyer Noh." For goodness' sake.

774
00:51:57,948 --> 00:51:59,407
-Gosh.
-What was that about?

775
00:51:59,491 --> 00:52:02,327
Hey, Bong-hui. Where are you going?

776
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:14,589
I'm so humiliated right now,
so don't say anything...

777
00:52:23,473 --> 00:52:24,975
You're not inconveniencing me.

778
00:52:30,856 --> 00:52:32,482
Come back to me.

779
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:47,873
Come work with me.

780
00:52:50,375 --> 00:52:52,419
Well, what do you mean...

781
00:53:07,976 --> 00:53:08,977
Hey.

782
00:53:09,144 --> 00:53:10,770
Did you see her eyes earlier?

783
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:14,357
It looked like
she could really kill someone.

784
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:15,442
I know, right?

785
00:53:15,525 --> 00:53:19,487
But I honestly don't know
why she was being like that.

786
00:53:19,571 --> 00:53:20,906
Anyhow,

787
00:53:21,781 --> 00:53:24,117
she really should know her place.

788
00:53:24,576 --> 00:53:25,577
Exactly.

789
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:27,412
She frustrates me so much.

790
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:34,920
-Goodness!
-Hey, what's your problem?

791
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:36,504
My apologies.

792
00:53:36,755 --> 00:53:38,757
I'm severely anemic.

793
00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:42,010
-I'm sorry.
-Goodness.

794
00:53:44,596 --> 00:53:46,473
Gosh, it's disgusting.

795
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:48,725
Goodness, that piece of...

796
00:54:22,425 --> 00:54:23,802
Gosh, my head...

797
00:54:36,481 --> 00:54:37,399
What...

798
00:54:41,736 --> 00:54:42,737
Gosh.

799
00:54:51,287 --> 00:54:52,497
My gosh.

800
00:55:17,063 --> 00:55:19,607
What? No way. It can't be.

801
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:39,919
Did you sleep well?

802
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:49,012
My gosh, why are you acting
all embarrassed?

803
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:50,180
I don't know.

804
00:55:50,805 --> 00:55:52,766
Hey, stop acting embarrassed.

805
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:54,976
Don't act that way.

806
00:56:00,106 --> 00:56:03,318
Bong-hui, by any chance... last night...

807
00:56:03,985 --> 00:56:07,947
Well, I don't know how I should say this.

808
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:10,325
A man and a woman...

809
00:56:12,744 --> 00:56:13,745
We didn't, did we?

810
00:56:13,953 --> 00:56:14,954
I'm not sure.

811
00:56:15,997 --> 00:56:18,208
Can you tell me anything other than that?

812
00:56:20,627 --> 00:56:21,836
I'm not sure.

813
00:56:24,047 --> 00:56:25,048
We did it.

814
00:56:26,633 --> 00:56:27,884
I'm doomed.

815
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:39,896
It serves him right.
He didn't even tell me either.

816
00:56:40,647 --> 00:56:44,901
He should know what it feels like
to wonder if we did it or not.

817
00:56:53,993 --> 00:56:55,620
Come back to me.

818
00:56:57,831 --> 00:56:58,998
Come work for me.

819
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:04,879
What did that mean?

820
00:57:08,716 --> 00:57:10,802
He was drunk,
so he probably doesn't even remember.

821
00:57:11,052 --> 00:57:12,887
Let's not care about what he said.

822
00:57:14,597 --> 00:57:15,640
Right?

823
00:57:29,821 --> 00:57:31,656
The number you are calling
is not available.

824
00:57:31,739 --> 00:57:33,867
LAWYER EUN BONG-HUI

825
00:57:51,843 --> 00:57:53,344
Where are you going?

826
00:57:57,682 --> 00:57:59,684
You can't be going to work on a weekend.

827
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:02,187
It's none of your business.

828
00:58:03,938 --> 00:58:04,939
What?

829
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:10,236
-Where are you off to?
-Well,

830
00:58:10,695 --> 00:58:12,989
I need to go to my office
to take care of...

831
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:18,036
The guy from the forensic center
called me. The results must be out.

832
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:27,253
Yes. Would it be possible
to hear the results in person?

833
00:58:28,213 --> 00:58:29,130
Yes.

834
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:30,340
He didn't find anything.

835
00:58:30,882 --> 00:58:32,884
I'll go see you right now.

836
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:35,595
Okay.

837
00:58:36,596 --> 00:58:37,764
Please tell me your location.

838
00:58:44,979 --> 00:58:46,022
Hi.

839
00:58:46,898 --> 00:58:48,066
It's been a while.

840
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:39,951
Ji-uk, you and I...

841
00:59:40,034 --> 00:59:42,662
we can't just easily
forget about each other.

842
00:59:42,745 --> 00:59:45,164
What else do you think
is left between us, Yu-jeong?

843
00:59:45,498 --> 00:59:47,917
Yes, Ms. Eun. I'm sorry to tell you this.

844
00:59:48,084 --> 00:59:49,794
I didn't find anything useful.

845
00:59:50,128 --> 00:59:52,880
Hey, Ji-uk. I heard you're going to quit.

846
00:59:52,964 --> 00:59:54,632
This is my resignation letter.

847
00:59:54,716 --> 00:59:56,092
You're opening a law firm, right?

848
00:59:56,217 --> 00:59:57,218
Honey.

849
00:59:57,302 --> 00:59:58,970
Why? Are you hungry?

850
00:59:59,846 --> 01:00:01,097
Why am I doing this?

851
01:00:01,222 --> 01:00:04,350
Why am I always feeding you like this?

852
01:00:04,934 --> 01:00:06,769
Why? Are you worried
I might think I'm your wife?

853
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:10,940
