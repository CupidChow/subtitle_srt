1
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:35,160
There's something I'd like to know
regarding my parents' death.

2
00:00:35,243 --> 00:00:37,954
He's Ms. Eun's father, isn't he?
The suspect, Eun Man-su.

3
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:41,583
Didn't we agree to mind
each other's own business?

4
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:44,169
I'm doing what's right.

5
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:46,838
As you may already know,
the key suspect is Jung Hyeon-su.

6
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:48,298
But he's not an easy fellow.

7
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:49,549
Find it whatever it may be.

8
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:51,760
If there is nothing, we should plant

9
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,262
a murder weapon that has his fingerprints.

10
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:55,513
I have a warrant.

11
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,640
-I found it.
-Gosh, Noh Ji-uk...

12
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:00,185
Jung Hyeon-su!

13
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:09,110
I was going to make sure
that you'd get punished by law.

14
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:11,196
You pegged him as the culprit.

15
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:14,824
You said it yourself
that he killed your parents.

16
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:17,035
What on earth did I see?

17
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:19,162
How could I not have known?

18
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:21,581
I practically memorized
the story of the victim's family.

19
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:23,666
The anniversary date
of both our fathers' deaths.

20
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:24,793
When did you find out?

21
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:29,088
What about you, Mr. Noh?
When did you find out about my dad?

22
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:31,174
Let's break up.

23
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:33,384
I came to give you this.

24
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:35,345
I apologize and thank you for everything.

25
00:01:36,554 --> 00:01:38,181
I'm not sure.

26
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:41,601
I don't remember who it was.

27
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:43,645
I don't know.

28
00:01:43,728 --> 00:01:47,524
It was that man. He's the culprit.

29
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:50,819
What are these two contrasting memories
that popped into my head?

30
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:53,446
Which one is the truth?

31
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,250
Can you recognize him?

32
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:09,003
This man is the one

33
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:11,297
who killed your mom and dad.

34
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:13,258
Okay?

35
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:17,428
This man is the one
who killed your mom and dad.

36
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:19,931
This man is the one
who killed your mom and dad.

37
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:21,808
He killed your mom.

38
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:26,437
I don't remember who it was.

39
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:28,648
I don't know.

40
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:04,475
Yes, Mr. Bang.

41
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:08,271
Yes, he's still the same.

42
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,648
The doctor said
there's been no improvement.

43
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:12,483
Right.

44
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,653
Yes, okay.

45
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:17,614
All right.

46
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:51,731
Mr. Jung Hyeon-su.

47
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:56,069
You know who I am?

48
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:21,219
MR. BANG

49
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:22,679
Yes, Mr. Bang.

50
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:24,806
Jung Hyeon-su has just woken up.

51
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:28,309
Pardon?

52
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:31,437
Okay. I'm on my way.

53
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:35,108
Yes, I got it.

54
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:37,485
I'll be there right away.

55
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:43,032
SEONHO HOSPITAL

56
00:05:59,108 --> 00:05:59,984
Are you okay?

57
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:04,030
Yes, I'm okay.

58
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:07,617
Prosecutor Cha and police officers
just took Jung Hyeon-su.

59
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,285
They said they needed to examine him.

60
00:06:09,368 --> 00:06:12,038
Actually, I did see him on my way here.

61
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:15,666
How did he look to you?

62
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:21,923
He seemed a bit strange to me.

63
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:25,051
Mr. Jung Hyeon-su.

64
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:27,678
You know who I am?

65
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:24,527
I'm here because I thought
you guys might wait endlessly.

66
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,612
The testing will take a long time.

67
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:29,949
Even if it ends early,
you can't see him today.

68
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:34,871
Well, I didn't expect to see him today.

69
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:36,956
Call me as soon as we can.

70
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,124
Okay, I will.

71
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:40,168
-Let's go, Ms. Eun.
-Okay.

72
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:55,057
I'm going to go that way.

73
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:57,935
I'll drop you off.

74
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,814
No, that won't be necessary.
There are a lot of buses I can take.

75
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:06,319
Bye.

76
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,534
It was this man.

77
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:16,537
He's the culprit.

78
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:18,748
Bong-hui.

79
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,762
Do you know which bus
you are supposed to take?

80
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:37,058
Yes, I do.

81
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:39,894
I have the bus route in my head.

82
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,731
Okay, bye.

83
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:05,521
There's no need to be so serious.

84
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:09,025
What's the big deal about a murderer
regaining his consciousness?

85
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:10,735
You're right. Don't worry.

86
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:12,737
I'm going to send him to prison.

87
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,655
He's already being held in custody,
Mr. Bang.

88
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,909
If his physical condition is fine,
he'll get arrested soon.

89
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:20,578
Prosecutor Cha will take care of it.

90
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:21,912
You're right.

91
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,461
Hey, why are you here?

92
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,881
He insists on meeting Mr. Noh
before he leaves.

93
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:33,758
Really?

94
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:36,427
Hey, kid. Hey!

95
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:38,012
I'm talking to you.

96
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:39,972
Are you deaf?

97
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:44,935
Mr. Noh.

98
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,357
He can obviously hear me, right?

99
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:50,941
Hey!

100
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,443
That little punk.

101
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:14,006
My goodness.

102
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:15,966
Hey!

103
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:18,594
You almost gave me a heart attack.

104
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:24,308
I already had one,
so I don't have a heart anymore.

105
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:27,520
What nonsense are you saying?

106
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:28,938
Are you a zombie?

107
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:42,410
Hey, Prosecutor Na.

108
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:45,079
Is it easy...

109
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:47,706
to get amnesia?

110
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:48,916
Is it a common illness?

111
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:52,545
How would I know?

112
00:11:58,426 --> 00:11:59,343
What?

113
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:01,804
Did you make a stew?

114
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:03,222
Yes.

115
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:05,683
What's gotten into you?

116
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:24,952
Hey, what did you put in this?

117
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:28,456
What ingredient did you use
to make a stew taste so horrible?

118
00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:29,623
My gosh.

119
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:32,334
You're completely useless.

120
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:42,178
What? Why?

121
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:50,478
It's not much. Here's my living expense.

122
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,786
My gosh, you should give me more
if you have any conscience.

123
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:10,206
Ji-hae,

124
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:12,708
-I'm really--
-What? Are you sad?

125
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,001
Are you sad again?

126
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:17,004
You're not the only one who's sad.
I'm sad too.

127
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:21,759
But I'm really sad this time.

128
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:40,986
Can you recognize him?

129
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:43,405
This

130
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:45,282
man is the one

131
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,284
who killed your mom and dad.

132
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:48,494
Okay?

133
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,598
PROSECUTOR REAPPOINTMENT APPLICATION

134
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:23,654
You are still here?

135
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:31,036
Are you...

136
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,456
trying to become a prosecutor again?

137
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:39,879
Why are you going through
other people's stuff?

138
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:44,300
I saw it by accident.

139
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,510
Don't be so harsh on me.

140
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:49,013
So...

141
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,641
Working as a lawyer is not right for you?

142
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:01,108
I'm just really frustrated at the fact
that I can't do anything...

143
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:05,613
about criminals like Jung Hyeon-su.

144
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:10,492
I got Jung Hyeon-su acquitted.

145
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,746
I really want to

146
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:16,081
lock him up in prison.

147
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:20,836
But there's really nothing I can do.

148
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:23,964
I guess

149
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:26,383
I enjoy exercising governmental authority.

150
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:30,554
I...

151
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:35,601
didn't like it when you were a prosecutor.

152
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:37,937
Why not?

153
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,648
You always worked overtime
and couldn't sleep properly.

154
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:42,858
You always deal with brutal criminals.

155
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:44,860
Your job

156
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:47,321
was always really tough.

157
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:49,573
I was worried that...

158
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:53,452
you might end up...

159
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:56,246
like your dad.

160
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:04,755
But...

161
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:07,716
if that's what you want to do,
I won't stop you.

162
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:12,137
I don't know.

163
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:14,431
I wonder if...

164
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:17,101
the chief will even allow me to get hired.

165
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:19,103
We'll have to see what happens.

166
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:40,040
I'd like to know more specifically about

167
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:42,042
my parents' accident.

168
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:47,715
So that I can go ask him with confidence
and fix things.

169
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:50,509
I need to ask him why he did such a thing.

170
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:56,056
I'll try to look for the investigator
of that case.

171
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:00,019
I'm always really...

172
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:02,229
You're grateful, aren't you?

173
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:04,648
Gosh.

174
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:09,486
Well, just a little.

175
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:11,864
"Just a little..."

176
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:13,532
I see.

177
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:17,202
No, a lot. I'm very grateful.

178
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:22,416
Let's cheer up.

179
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:27,254
Are you going to visit Jung Hyeon-su?

180
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:28,797
Yes.

181
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:41,268
Prosecutor Cha.

182
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:43,228
You're here.

183
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:45,856
How's Jung Hyeon-su doing?

184
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:49,443
According to his MRI
and brainwave test results,

185
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:51,570
he doesn't show any signs
of abnormal symptoms.

186
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:54,656
That means there was no physical damage
done to his brain.

187
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,827
Wait. Then how does that explain
what I saw?

188
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,748
It definitely seemed
like he didn't recognize me.

189
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:06,085
Then that gives us two possibilities.

190
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:09,379
He's either really suffering
from dissociative amnesia,

191
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:10,506
or...

192
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:12,883
he's lying to us.

193
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,636
I'm saying that he could be acting

194
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:18,931
as if he doesn't remember what happened
or who I am.

195
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:22,309
If that's the case,
why would he even do that?

196
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:26,688
I don't know. Maybe he's trying
to use insanity as an excuse in court.

197
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:28,857
That could be the case.

198
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:31,068
Anyway, the doctor said,

199
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:32,694
he did suffer from cerebral hemorrhage,

200
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,613
but there aren't any damages
done to his brain.

201
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:38,242
And his amnesia may be
a temporary symptom,

202
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:39,952
so we'll have to wait and see.

203
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:42,663
And if it's dissociative amnesia,

204
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:45,958
it may be caused by a trauma or guilt.

205
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:49,586
Jung Hyeon-su isn't exactly the type
to feel a sense of guilt.

206
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:52,589
You're right. I completely agree with you.

207
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:55,551
Pull some strings for me.

208
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:57,928
Let me see him, Prosecutor Cha.

209
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:01,265
I think I need to meet with him.

210
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:10,566
I can only give you five minutes.

211
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,538
My gosh.

212
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:29,877
I wasn't too sure, but you must be
the guy who knows me.

213
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:36,008
Do you...

214
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:38,969
remember me?

215
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:41,555
I ran into you in the hallway yesterday.

216
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:46,059
You have such a good memory.

217
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,521
I guess I used to have a good memory.

218
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:50,606
Yes.

219
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:52,649
A superb one.

220
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,026
Superb...

221
00:19:57,654 --> 00:19:58,655
I see.

222
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:02,534
But I don't remember anything
at the moment.

223
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,621
By any chance, is there anything
you know about what I did?

224
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:08,040
If there is, please tell me.
I implore you.

225
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,751
Well, I must say, this is hard.

226
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:13,921
I'm not sure
if I have the answer you want.

227
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:18,800
Gosh, this is happening again.

228
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:28,185
For goodness' sake.

229
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:31,980
ABSOLUTE REST RECOMMENDED

230
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:38,654
My apologies.

231
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:43,700
I'm frustrated because no one
is telling me anything.

232
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:47,996
People keep coming here

233
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:51,583
and asking me what I remember.

234
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,211
I wouldn't have been diagnosed
with amnesia if I could remember.

235
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:56,088
Aren't I right?

236
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:59,758
Is it that difficult
to tell me what you know?

237
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:02,261
I opened my eyes,
but I couldn't remember anything.

238
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:04,805
This room was filled with cops,
and they wouldn't let me move.

239
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:07,099
Then a female prosecutor comes in
to say what she has to say,

240
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:09,142
but doesn't answer any of my questions.

241
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:11,103
I honestly feel like
I'm going crazy right now.

242
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:13,397
Do you happen to know
about what I did in the past?

243
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,315
No. First and foremost, who am I?

244
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:18,068
And who are you?

245
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:25,200
Even without your memory,
you sure are the Jung Hyeon-su I know.

246
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:27,369
What does that even mean?

247
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:32,207
First of all, I used to be...

248
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:35,669
your lawyer.

249
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:42,718
Lawyer... That means...

250
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:48,724
If you were my lawyer,
that means you were on my side.

251
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:52,602
That's a relief.

252
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,896
I did have someone on my side.

253
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:56,315
Well...

254
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:58,692
Then why aren't you telling me anything?

255
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:01,153
You said you're on my side. But...

256
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:05,240
Why won't you tell me anything?
You can tell me who I am and what I did.

257
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,534
It shouldn't be that hard.
Can't you just tell me?

258
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:08,994
-It's because...
-Yes?

259
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:10,287
You...

260
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:14,583
Time's up, Mr. Noh.

261
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:20,714
How merciless.

262
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,929
It was nice seeing you, Mr. Jung.

263
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:30,807
I'm not done here.

264
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:40,108
How was it? Do you think
he's putting on a show or not?

265
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:44,071
Well, I'm not sure yet.

266
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:46,907
I'd say the chances are half and half.
One thing I'm certain...

267
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:49,743
is that his personality is the same

268
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:51,953
even with the memory loss.

269
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:36,414
My gosh.

270
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:40,127
I apologize. Jae-hong, you little...

271
00:23:40,293 --> 00:23:43,213
Hey, get back here.
Gosh, why are you running away?

272
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:45,549
Hey, come here.

273
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:47,884
I got you.

274
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:51,471
You are at his level.

275
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:54,182
That is not true.

276
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:58,645
You have to go to your aunt's place
straight from your taekwondo class.

277
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:00,188
Why do you keep coming here?

278
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:03,775
I get scared when I'm at my aunt's place.

279
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:07,737
That bad cop
won't be able to get out of prison,

280
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:09,406
so don't worry.

281
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:11,575
I keep having nightmares...

282
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:14,077
like Ji-uk does.

283
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:21,376
Just leave him be. He can hang out here.

284
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:26,464
Ms. Lack of Evidence,
you should come back to work now.

285
00:24:26,923 --> 00:24:29,176
Are you going to be on vacation
forever or what?

286
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:30,302
That's what I wanted to say.

287
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:43,356
He's very independent.

288
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:47,527
He reminds me of Ji-uk as a kid.

289
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:49,988
-Really?
-Yes.

290
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:54,576
Kids spill things
and make mistakes, you know.

291
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:56,703
But he's so self-reliant.

292
00:24:57,495 --> 00:25:00,081
Kids have to be childish,

293
00:25:00,498 --> 00:25:03,001
but he acts maturer than adults do.

294
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:06,296
You're the mature and old one, not me.

295
00:25:06,379 --> 00:25:08,673
And you're just as impudent as Ji-uk is.

296
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:16,181
Mr. Noh!

297
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:20,310
Gosh, get off of me.
It's too hot for this.

298
00:25:20,977 --> 00:25:22,062
You little bugger.

299
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:25,440
Let's go, Jae-hong. I'll take you home.

300
00:25:25,523 --> 00:25:26,399
Just a second.

301
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:30,070
Can we have a quick talk?

302
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:53,468
You should end your vacation now.

303
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:58,056
For personal matters,
I'll give you more time off.

304
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:03,186
I have things to sort out too,
so let's have more time apart.

305
00:26:05,188 --> 00:26:07,065
But it's time for you to get back to work.

306
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:10,777
It'll be harder to come back
if you drag it out for longer.

307
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:16,825
Okay. I'll think about it, Mr. Noh.

308
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:19,452
All right. You can think about it
all you want later.

309
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:20,954
Let's have a meeting first.

310
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:23,164
What... Right now?

311
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:26,001
Then shall we put it off?

312
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:28,295
There's so much work to be done. Come on.

313
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:33,633
Well... Okay.

314
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:39,472
Since this is compensation
for the drop in the property value,

315
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:41,224
I asked to have it evaluated.

316
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:45,020
But as always, it's not easy
to accurately estimate the loss.

317
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:47,480
Right, proving it can be challenging.

318
00:26:47,605 --> 00:26:49,399
Yes. So I think--

319
00:26:49,482 --> 00:26:52,777
Is it true that Jung Hyeon-su has
Alzheimer's disease?

320
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:55,447
Goodness. This meeting
will go nowhere as always.

321
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:58,241
Tell me! Is it true?

322
00:26:58,908 --> 00:27:02,203
It's not Alzheimer's disease.
He's been diagnosed with amnesia.

323
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:03,955
It's the same thing.

324
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:05,623
They're not the same thing.

325
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:06,833
Certainly not.

326
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:09,169
That scum is lying.

327
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:14,507
Yes. He might be putting on a show
as being unfit to stand trial.

328
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:16,551
-But...
-But what?

329
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:19,971
It did look pretty real.

330
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:21,598
You're so gullible.

331
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:22,974
I didn't get fooled.

332
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:24,684
If you were a judge,

333
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:27,937
you would be like,
"He's unfit for trial, Not guilty."

334
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:29,898
You definitely would've acquitted
people like him.

335
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:31,274
That's why I didn't become a judge.

336
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:33,026
I bet you couldn't.

337
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:35,779
You didn't get good grades
at the training institute.

338
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:39,449
Did you even check my grades
from the institute?

339
00:27:39,532 --> 00:27:41,534
It's all on your resume.

340
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:42,660
Right.

341
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:47,457
You didn't have to read
and remember all the details.

342
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:49,376
Hey, go on another vacation.

343
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:51,086
Gosh, stop talking about vacation!

344
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:53,505
What a mess!
This meeting is going nowhere.

345
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:56,216
Gosh, you startled me.

346
00:27:58,468 --> 00:27:59,427
My apologies.

347
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:01,137
Why are you apologizing?

348
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:04,432
We always end up in this mess
because of Mr. Byeon.

349
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:05,433
As always.

350
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:08,269
You guys blame me all the time.

351
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:09,396
Yes.

352
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:11,731
Listen up.

353
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:15,193
Was it back in 1985?

354
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:18,154
There was a precedent for a suspect
who was like Jung Hyeon-su,

355
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:21,032
a precedent regarding amnesia.

356
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:23,243
You'll find it helpful.

357
00:28:23,326 --> 00:28:24,661
-Oh, my.
-Impressive.

358
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,915
Who wants coffee?

359
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:31,751
Put your hands down!

360
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:42,762
SEONHO DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

361
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:46,433
Sir, I need to get the warrant issued.

362
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:47,767
We have concrete evidence.

363
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:51,479
But you said his memory
isn't fully recovered yet.

364
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:52,605
It will be.

365
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:53,815
Are you sure?

366
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:55,942
The public consensus isn't favorable.

367
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:58,987
What if you arrest him and it goes south?
Who is going to take the responsibility?

368
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:01,281
-I will--
-Wait a bit longer.

369
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:03,116
Pay attention to what's going on.

370
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:06,161
You have to see how the wheels
are turning. Okay?

371
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:09,456
You know nothing, and you're a bother.
Good grief.

372
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:38,276
What are you doing? My arm hurts.

373
00:29:44,699 --> 00:29:45,617
What is that?

374
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:49,662
I see. You are studying
Jung Hyeon-su's condition.

375
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:53,082
Yes, I never knew
I'd study this kind of thing in my life.

376
00:29:56,544 --> 00:29:57,879
I get that, but...

377
00:29:58,713 --> 00:30:00,298
You should eat your meals properly.

378
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:03,802
I don't have anyone to eat with anyway.

379
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:05,303
Eating alone is comfortable.

380
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:10,183
Are you

381
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:14,062
being ostracized at work
after the appeal I worked on?

382
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:16,856
You really don't know anything about me.

383
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:19,984
It's not because of that appeal case.

384
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:21,945
I was always an outcast.

385
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:25,615
I always ate alone except for a few times
that I ate with Ji-hae.

386
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:29,244
-Really?
-Yes.

387
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:34,374
Hey,

388
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:38,378
you should either work or eat.
Don't multitask.

389
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:44,133
I will read this and summarize it for you.

390
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:47,679
Okay.

391
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:49,597
Make it a thorough summary.

392
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:50,765
Yes, ma'am.

393
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,687
But that paper is over 100 pages.

394
00:30:58,022 --> 00:30:58,898
Hey.

395
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:02,944
Thank you for your help, my friend.

396
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:09,075
Drink and eat,
or you'll upset your stomach.

397
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:12,871
Okay.

398
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:30,096
It's late. You can continue tomorrow.

399
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:31,890
I see.

400
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:34,183
Let me just wrap this up.

401
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:37,312
You don't have to work so late
on your first day back.

402
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,689
You might exhaust yourself.

403
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:41,858
Okay.

404
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:53,912
I will walk you home.

405
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:56,748
Oh, that's fine.

406
00:31:56,831 --> 00:31:58,207
I know you don't need it.

407
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:02,128
It's just that I was on my way out anyway.

408
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,179
Thank you for walking me home.

409
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:17,977
You should go in.

410
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:21,606
-Okay.
-Mr. Noh.

411
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:24,067
I see you often these days.

412
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:25,360
Right.

413
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:29,447
What's going on?
I thought you guys broke up.

414
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:33,034
-Hey, Ji-hae.
-What?

415
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:36,621
Mr. Noh.

416
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:40,041
You should get going. Get home safely.

417
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:42,085
-All right. Shall I get going?
-Yes.

418
00:32:42,877 --> 00:32:43,920
See you around.

419
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:47,423
-Bye.
-Bye.

420
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:57,100
Oh, what brings the two of you here?

421
00:32:58,726 --> 00:33:00,269
Ji-hae, you're here too.

422
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:04,983
Ji-uk.

423
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:09,362
You guys are coming together?

424
00:33:09,445 --> 00:33:12,156
I asked you first.
Why are the three of you together?

425
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:15,660
I live with her.

426
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:19,998
My gosh, you're more generous
than I thought you'd be.

427
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:22,291
Letting a friend stay at your place
isn't an easy thing to do.

428
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,127
I agree with you.

429
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,671
I thought you two lived together.

430
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,548
Did you guys break up?

431
00:33:33,469 --> 00:33:34,470
What?

432
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:36,305
She's worse than me.

433
00:33:37,056 --> 00:33:38,057
What's gotten into you?

434
00:33:38,224 --> 00:33:40,184
You said you hate Ms. Eun the most
in the whole world.

435
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:41,269
Why do you live with her?

436
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:42,895
Well, you know.

437
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:46,816
She basically barged in
and coerced me to let her stay.

438
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:48,693
Oh, is that what happened?

439
00:33:48,901 --> 00:33:49,777
Pardon me?

440
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:52,822
No, I guess not.

441
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:55,283
What's going on here?

442
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:57,326
Are you trying to act coy?

443
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:58,786
When did I act coy?

444
00:33:58,911 --> 00:34:00,997
Why would she do that? For whom?

445
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:03,249
That's really not what I was doing.

446
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:04,959
When did I do such a thing?

447
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:10,548
I'm off.

448
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,342
I guess you should stay longer.

449
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:15,136
No, I'm leaving too. Wait up.

450
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:17,221
Bye.

451
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:21,142
Bye.

452
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:23,061
Stay for a bit longer.

453
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:24,479
Bye, see you.

454
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,261
I don't think I can do this.

455
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:58,888
You're putting me in a foul mood.

456
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:00,139
Let's sit at separate tables.

457
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:02,517
Why? I like this.

458
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,520
Do you know how long it's been
since we last drank together like this?

459
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:07,480
I don't know, and I'm not interested.

460
00:35:07,563 --> 00:35:10,149
-Just like the old days.
-I don't remember anything.

461
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:33,589
Hey, Ji-uk.

462
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:36,759
Why are you and Ms. Eun having problems?

463
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:39,804
Hey.

464
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:41,973
You're out of line, Eun-hyeok.

465
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:44,308
I think I should cross some lines today.

466
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:47,145
Don't break up with her.

467
00:35:58,156 --> 00:35:59,907
I don't think you'll be okay
if you two break up.

468
00:36:00,032 --> 00:36:01,409
We didn't break up...

469
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:05,163
yet.

470
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:16,757
Well, what's the problem? Tell me.

471
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:19,302
Do you think talking about it...

472
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:22,555
will make me feel better?

473
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,766
Will talking to you about it...

474
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:27,935
take a load off...

475
00:36:30,104 --> 00:36:31,314
of my mind?

476
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:40,281
Since I was a kid...

477
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:43,701
I've always had nightmares.

478
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:45,119
Did you know that?

479
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:47,872
That I know.

480
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:50,166
In the dreams, I always saw
the man who tried...

481
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:55,379
to kill me and my parents
in the arson case...

482
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:58,591
and I remembered his face.

483
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:00,509
Who is he?

484
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:01,802
Bong-hui's dad.

485
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:09,477
Are you sure about that?

486
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:11,229
I don't know. Well...

487
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:16,067
It happened so long ago.

488
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:17,610
And memory isn't

489
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:19,612
always accurate, you know.

490
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:21,572
I have no idea.

491
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:31,582
What about Ms. Eun? Does she know?

492
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:37,296
She wants to break up.

493
00:37:41,008 --> 00:37:42,009
What about you?

494
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:47,723
Hey, talking about it
doesn't make me feel any better.

495
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:51,018
I don't feel better.

496
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:52,812
You are useless.

497
00:37:55,856 --> 00:37:57,858
Sir, check please.

498
00:37:57,984 --> 00:37:59,318
Hey, Noh Ji-uk.

499
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:02,321
Hey,

500
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,824
mind your own business.

501
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:17,169
And I...

502
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:20,589
don't care...

503
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:24,719
about you and Yu-jeong.

504
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:44,196
SEONHO HOSPITAL

505
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:47,491
The doctor said you are healthy enough
to be questioned.

506
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:57,877
Now, it's time for us to get to the point.

507
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:01,213
Mr. Jung.

508
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:04,925
-Yes?
-You're being investigated about

509
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:08,554
Lee Jae-ho's murder case
and attempted murder of Bang Eun-ho.

510
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:25,071
Murder?

511
00:39:26,947 --> 00:39:28,491
I killed a person?

512
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:30,201
Yes.

513
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:35,706
You have the right to remain silent
to anything that maybe used against you.

514
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:37,917
You have the right to consult to a lawyer.

515
00:39:41,837 --> 00:39:43,381
Are you okay, Mr. Jung?

516
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:45,508
What?

517
00:39:46,842 --> 00:39:47,718
I...

518
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:53,432
If I really did murder someone...

519
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:56,727
it's fair that I be punished.

520
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:14,620
Goodness, this crazy meeting
has ended at last.

521
00:40:14,703 --> 00:40:17,498
Jung Hyeon-su still hasn't
regained his memory?

522
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,584
Not yet, but...

523
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:23,129
I'm going to make him regain his memory.

524
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:25,256
What about just leaving him alone?

525
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:27,174
If he gets his memory back,

526
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:29,593
he might be a menace again.

527
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:33,681
No, we ought to make him remember
and be punished justly.

528
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:36,684
The prosecution has to investigate
further crimes...

529
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:39,979
and Bong-hui has to clear her name too.

530
00:40:45,484 --> 00:40:46,652
I'll help too.

531
00:40:47,653 --> 00:40:50,614
I'm going to delve into his past.

532
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:53,117
You might end up like Eun-ho, when he...

533
00:40:58,747 --> 00:40:59,957
I'm sorry, Mr. Bang.

534
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:02,460
No, I'm the one who should be sorry.

535
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:05,171
Jung Hyeon-su is being detained
in the hospital.

536
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:06,338
I will be safe.

537
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:09,175
I'll help as well. I can protect her
if it gets dangerous.

538
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:10,843
Don't worry, Ji-uk.

539
00:41:11,051 --> 00:41:13,512
Okay. For your information,
I might be stronger than you.

540
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:15,264
Come on, Ms. Eun.

541
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:18,726
But this is after your work hours.

542
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:22,938
During your work hours,
please stay in the office.

543
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:24,732
He's bored when he's alone.

544
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:25,858
Why you...

545
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:28,277
Anyway,

546
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,279
be careful.

547
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:33,073
When you meet Jung Hyeon-su,

548
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:34,909
you should be careful too.

549
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:45,169
Hey, are they dating each other or what?

550
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:03,062
Hello.

551
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:09,944
Supposedly, I...

552
00:42:11,153 --> 00:42:12,613
killed a person.

553
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:17,451
Is that why you didn't tell me?

554
00:42:18,827 --> 00:42:19,828
You must...

555
00:42:21,455 --> 00:42:22,748
have been deeply shocked.

556
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:28,796
That's why

557
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:32,716
I gave this a lot of thought on my own.

558
00:42:35,427 --> 00:42:36,512
There must have been...

559
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:40,224
a reason why I killed him, right?

560
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:45,854
You're thinking outside the box.

561
00:42:47,523 --> 00:42:49,608
Oh, am I?

562
00:42:50,317 --> 00:42:52,695
It looks like you don't get it.

563
00:42:55,197 --> 00:42:56,323
Okay, fine.

564
00:42:57,283 --> 00:43:00,327
I'll help you regain your memory.

565
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:04,164
-Will you cooperate?
-Of course.

566
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:05,708
I'd be grateful.

567
00:43:15,384 --> 00:43:16,510
Take a look.

568
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:28,939
All these belonged to me?

569
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:41,910
Do you remember them?

570
00:43:54,923 --> 00:43:55,841
No?

571
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:11,148
VICTIMS RELATED TO JUNG HYEON-SU

572
00:44:11,523 --> 00:44:13,442
FORENSIC OFFICER GO CHAN-HO, DISAPPEARED

573
00:44:13,525 --> 00:44:15,486
CHEF YANG JIN-WU, DEAD

574
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:17,154
HYUNJIN HIGH SCHOOL

575
00:44:19,406 --> 00:44:20,783
Jung Hyeon-su...

576
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:24,578
Both of them were...

577
00:44:26,246 --> 00:44:27,414
Something is off.

578
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,713
Mr. Ji, here you go.

579
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:36,840
SERIAL MURDER CASE IN CHEONAN

580
00:44:37,132 --> 00:44:39,760
They're articles
regarding juvenile crimes of that time.

581
00:44:42,554 --> 00:44:45,265
You should go through them by yourself.

582
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:52,314
You should help me.

583
00:44:56,902 --> 00:44:57,820
Right.

584
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:26,223
Ms. Eun.

585
00:45:26,473 --> 00:45:27,433
Look at this.

586
00:45:29,768 --> 00:45:31,145
Ms. Eun, let me.

587
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:32,688
-They are heavy.
-Let me help.

588
00:45:32,938 --> 00:45:34,815
-Be careful.
-These are really heavy.

589
00:45:34,898 --> 00:45:35,899
They are.

590
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:41,989
Mr. Ji.

591
00:45:43,782 --> 00:45:44,825
Look at this.

592
00:45:45,033 --> 00:45:47,911
ANOTHER HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT
SEXUALLY ASSAULTED

593
00:45:49,163 --> 00:45:50,706
This does seem a bit strange.

594
00:45:51,123 --> 00:45:52,583
Let me look into this more.

595
00:45:52,958 --> 00:45:53,959
Please do so.

596
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:58,380
Yes, is this Midong High School?

597
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:01,341
I just have a few questions to ask.

598
00:46:01,717 --> 00:46:02,593
Yes.

599
00:46:03,677 --> 00:46:06,680
That's right. We are looking for
one of your alumni.

600
00:46:06,763 --> 00:46:08,098
Can you verify for us?

601
00:46:08,348 --> 00:46:11,685
I'd like to ask
if the person I'm looking for

602
00:46:11,768 --> 00:46:13,604
is one of the alumni
of Hyunjin High School.

603
00:46:13,687 --> 00:46:14,688
Can you check it for us?

604
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:15,898
Yes.

605
00:46:17,649 --> 00:46:20,611
Can you recognize any of them
in the photos?

606
00:46:22,404 --> 00:46:25,782
I don't know. They do look familiar.

607
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:28,952
I think they graduated from our school.

608
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:40,839
I think it must be around somewhere here.

609
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:42,841
I think so too.

610
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:44,718
Wait, Mr. Ji. Isn't that it?

611
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:46,136
SANDEUL PORK AND RICE SOUP

612
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:47,971
-I think it is.
-It's the one.

613
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:53,101
SANDEUL PORK AND RICE SOUP

614
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:57,272
-Welcome.
-Hello.

615
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,761
Let's not get our hopes up.

616
00:47:27,886 --> 00:47:30,180
Let's think that we are here
just for a meal.

617
00:47:31,056 --> 00:47:31,974
Of course.

618
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:36,353
Excuse me, we'd like two bowls of gukbap.

619
00:47:36,436 --> 00:47:38,397
-Okay. Two?
-Yes.

620
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:04,775
Hey, Prosecutor Cha.

621
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:06,443
We got the warrant issued.

622
00:49:07,527 --> 00:49:08,445
Oh, really?

623
00:49:11,531 --> 00:49:12,407
Okay.

624
00:49:32,886 --> 00:49:35,472
PARK SO-YEONG

625
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:23,038
It's suffocating to stay indoors
all the time.

626
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:24,623
I'd like to go outside.

627
00:51:32,047 --> 00:51:34,216
You could feel that way.
I completely understand.

628
00:51:35,008 --> 00:51:36,009
By the way,

629
00:51:36,343 --> 00:51:38,345
I think I need to take these.

630
00:51:38,428 --> 00:51:40,055
Prosecutor Cha asked me to.

631
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:43,683
Okay, go ahead.

632
00:51:49,856 --> 00:51:51,233
By the way, you said...

633
00:51:53,318 --> 00:51:55,987
I don't have any friends or family, right?

634
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:00,700
That's what I heard.

635
00:52:00,826 --> 00:52:02,202
Not even a girl I liked?

636
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:04,871
I've always wanted to ask you that.

637
00:52:07,207 --> 00:52:09,000
Do you remember anyone?

638
00:52:12,212 --> 00:52:13,255
I guess not.

639
00:54:23,593 --> 00:54:24,928
I'm going to go to the men's room.

640
00:54:43,321 --> 00:54:44,197
Jung...

641
00:54:44,698 --> 00:54:46,992
Jung Hyeon-su.

642
00:54:47,867 --> 00:54:49,160
Jung Hyeon-su!

643
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,371
Jung Hyeon-su!

644
00:55:54,684 --> 00:55:55,894
You should go first.

645
00:55:55,977 --> 00:55:57,187
I'll be right there.

646
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:45,485
By the way, you said...

647
00:56:46,194 --> 00:56:48,863
I don't have any friends or family, right?

648
00:56:50,532 --> 00:56:52,158
That's what I heard.

649
00:56:53,618 --> 00:56:55,495
Not even a girl I liked?

650
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:58,039
The last thing
Jung Hyeon-su was looking at was...

651
00:57:51,843 --> 00:57:52,886
Yes, it's me.

652
00:57:58,308 --> 00:57:59,267
Mr. Noh.

653
00:58:00,435 --> 00:58:03,396
I think I've found out
why Jung Hyeon-su kills people.

654
00:58:04,772 --> 00:58:07,859
Did that girl go to Hyunjin Middle School
by any chance?

655
00:58:08,276 --> 00:58:09,194
Yes.

656
00:58:11,237 --> 00:58:12,614
All right. Good work.

657
00:58:21,581 --> 00:58:23,666
It's suffocating to stay indoors
all the time.

658
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:25,084
I'd like to go outside.

659
00:58:29,214 --> 00:58:30,465
Darn it.

660
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:24,185
Jung Hyeon-su.

661
01:00:36,674 --> 01:00:38,718
Are you really okay?
Aren't you feeling dizzy at all?

662
01:00:38,801 --> 01:00:40,720
-I'm fine.
-Shall I get you anything?

663
01:00:40,803 --> 01:00:42,096
Is there anything you need?

664
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:44,140
I hope I never wake up from sleep.

665
01:00:44,223 --> 01:00:45,975
How am I supposed to face
the consequences?

666
01:00:46,059 --> 01:00:48,019
Do you think Jung Hyeon-su
will really come here?

667
01:00:48,102 --> 01:00:51,147
This is the one place
he remembers for certain.

668
01:00:51,230 --> 01:00:53,733
After that, he'll go to the places

669
01:00:53,816 --> 01:00:54,984
where he killed people.

670
01:00:55,068 --> 01:00:56,069
Who are you?

671
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:58,738
Mr. Noh.

672
01:00:59,155 --> 01:01:00,239
Mr. Noh.

673
01:01:02,575 --> 01:01:04,744
