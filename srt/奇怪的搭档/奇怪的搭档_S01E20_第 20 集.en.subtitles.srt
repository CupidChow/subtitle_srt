1
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:55,346
Some memories just pop into my head.

2
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:58,892
For this, I indict defendant
Eun Bong-hui for murder

3
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:00,894
under Article 250 of the Criminal Code.

4
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:04,147
You and I faced each other in court

5
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:07,233
as the prosecutor in charge
and a murder suspect.

6
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:10,278
According to Article 250
of the Criminal Code,

7
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:15,241
I ask that she be sentenced
to 15 years in prison...

8
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:17,285
for the first-degree murder.

9
00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:22,332
You demanded that I spend
15 years in prison.

10
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:23,833
Ergo,

11
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:26,586
according to Article 255
of Criminal Procedure Law,

12
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:29,631
the prosecution moves
to dismiss the charge.

13
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:32,091
You rescued me...

14
00:01:33,092 --> 00:01:36,513
and I fell for you.

15
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:48,942
Now that I think about it, after that day,

16
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:53,113
my life has been a series of
me falling for you over and over again.

17
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:58,701
Even at this very moment,
I'm falling for you again.

18
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,706
Hey, you. Can't you wake up
like a normal person?

19
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:45,832
What time is it?

20
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:47,625
You should ask what date it is.

21
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:50,420
You've been lying down on that sofa
for the whole weekend.

22
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:51,629
You didn't even wash up.

23
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:54,966
I see. The weekend is

24
00:02:55,174 --> 00:02:56,634
already over.

25
00:02:56,926 --> 00:03:00,096
Hey, I think the sofa
is going to stink now.

26
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:02,515
Ji-hae, I...

27
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:06,019
am fickle.

28
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:07,395
What the hell are you talking about?

29
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:09,147
I suddenly came to my senses.

30
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:12,150
I wonder

31
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,611
why I was reminded of that day.

32
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,195
Give me a morning kiss then.

33
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,781
What if something happens
between us again?

34
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:21,618
Our relationship is messy as it is.

35
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:23,661
-Can we start again?
-Bong-hui, wait.

36
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:25,288
I suddenly realized that.

37
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:29,417
I forgot that I had a trial to attend to.

38
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:30,752
I'm sorry.

39
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:33,004
Wait.

40
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:37,217
I...

41
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:40,511
I got really scared.

42
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:43,473
Ji-hae, I became a coward
and became timid.

43
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:44,933
What are you talking about now?

44
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,726
It's not even funny now.

45
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,771
Just shower already. Will you?

46
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:54,776
Who is it?

47
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:57,153
Who is it?

48
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:02,659
-Goodness.
-Hey.

49
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:04,202
Hello.

50
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:07,205
Sorry to barge in
and disturb you like this.

51
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,249
Is Ms. Eun inside?

52
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:11,417
Please come and disturb her.

53
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:14,963
Please get her off the sofa.

54
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:16,839
May I?

55
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,508
Please come in.

56
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:22,011
Bong-hui, get up.

57
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:25,640
Why should I?

58
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:27,809
Come outside. We need to talk.

59
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:29,519
Hey, your hair...

60
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:32,188
No, I can't.

61
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:33,773
Why not?

62
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,358
I haven't even washed my face.

63
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:36,442
I've seen it before.

64
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:37,527
I didn't even wash my hair.

65
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:38,695
I've seen that too.

66
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,030
But still.

67
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:43,283
I told you, you're still pretty
even when you are dirty.

68
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:49,747
I'm sorry.

69
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:51,541
That's all right.

70
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,322
I called you during the whole weekend.

71
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:26,117
My cell phone ran out of battery.

72
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,535
You weren't avoiding me?

73
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,288
That's not it.

74
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:32,623
Why are you avoiding me?

75
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,043
Avoiding isn't the right word.

76
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:40,631
I was scared.

77
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:41,674
Scared of what?

78
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:45,428
When I thought about us,
it was always like that.

79
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,556
Something bad always happened.

80
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:53,352
When we started to date,
like each other, and kiss...

81
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:56,022
After these happy moments,

82
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:58,775
some things happened and got messed up.

83
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:00,651
Someone always got hurt.

84
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,570
In the end, we broke up.

85
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:04,614
So you ran away?

86
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:07,992
That's why I ran away.

87
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:12,622
Okay. I get that.

88
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:14,582
Still, let's be together.

89
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,042
Sorry?

90
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:19,462
I just... I mean...

91
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:22,548
Were you even listening? It took
guts for me to tell you the truth.

92
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:25,009
Then what? Do you suggest
we pretend nothing happened?

93
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:29,722
No, that's not what I meant.

94
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,392
Then do we just date?

95
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,311
Just like this?

96
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:36,813
Yes.

97
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:39,732
Then why were you all over me

98
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:41,192
in the sacred court?

99
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,569
No, that was...

100
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:46,614
I did it because someone told me
to follow my heart.

101
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:48,908
I did it without realizing it.

102
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:51,744
You should take responsibility
if you enjoyed your feelings.

103
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,746
What about me? What should I do then?

104
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:57,333
I mean... It was only a kiss.

105
00:06:57,416 --> 00:07:00,128
There's no need
to take responsibility for it.

106
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:02,839
Yes, there is.

107
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,298
Right, there is.

108
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:12,348
Aren't you scared that something bad
might happen again?

109
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:14,559
I don't know.

110
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:16,394
Let it happen.

111
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:17,854
It doesn't matter to me.

112
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:20,064
How can you be so assertive?

113
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:25,319
It's just that...

114
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:28,448
breaking up with you is scarier.

115
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:32,118
To me, that's the scariest thing.

116
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:40,960
So please answer me now.

117
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,128
What do you want to do?

118
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:43,588
Should we be together?

119
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:46,466
Should we not?

120
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:47,717
Let's do it.

121
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:50,970
What the heck?

122
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:54,599
The worst thing that can happen
is breaking up.

123
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:59,187
Let's be together.

124
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:19,749
You said you got cold-feet.

125
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,083
You said you became timid.

126
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,503
He convinced me.

127
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:25,922
He makes a really appealing case.

128
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:29,592
Oh, my. I'm so nervous.

129
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:30,885
I'm going on a date.

130
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:33,638
You guys went out for long time.

131
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:34,639
Right.

132
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:38,100
But when we started dating,

133
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:41,854
someone got stabbed. So we didn't
get to go on many dates technically.

134
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,941
But you guys lived together
throughout the whole time.

135
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:46,859
But we only slept once together.

136
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:47,860
Hey,

137
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,987
I don't want to know the details.

138
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:51,656
Sorry.

139
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:58,204
Should I throw out the blanket or not?

140
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:00,665
-Unbelievable.
-But

141
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:03,084
what should I talk about during our date?

142
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:05,670
Do I have perfume?

143
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:07,380
-No, you don't.
-You'll let me borrow, right?

144
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:08,839
-No.
-Thank you.

145
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:10,132
Hey, I said no.

146
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,259
Sorry.

147
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,929
Hey, how do I look ? Do I look okay?

148
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:15,888
Do I look pretty?

149
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:21,185
-Not really.
-I don't look pretty?

150
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:22,770
-No.
-You lost your eye sight.

151
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:24,021
I'm leaving now.

152
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:25,523
Hey, hey.

153
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:26,941
Sit down.

154
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:27,900
Why?

155
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:35,658
I can't believe you call that makeup.

156
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:40,538
Come closer.

157
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:47,920
This is the trendiest makeup style
these days.

158
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:50,131
This is known as the Drunk Makeup.

159
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:52,216
What? What makeup?

160
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,552
Don't talk. Just sit tight.

161
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:59,765
So you'll let me use your perfume, right?

162
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,309
Okay. Thank you.

163
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:02,768
You little...

164
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:04,520
Please finish up.

165
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:10,860
This is perfect.

166
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,069
-Do I look okay?
-Yes.

167
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:13,362
-You're not lying, right?
-No.

168
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:14,905
-Trust me.
-Okay.

169
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,498
What is it?

170
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,921
It's nothing.

171
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:33,883
Your cheeks look cute.

172
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:38,012
What should we do today?

173
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:40,514
There are so many things I'd like to do.

174
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:42,642
Why don't we have a meal first?

175
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:45,269
Meal? Sure. What do you want to eat?

176
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:47,063
There are so many things I'd like to eat.

177
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:48,439
What should we eat?

178
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:52,109
Instead of eating, how about some drinks?

179
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,236
Drinks?

180
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,326
Sure. I like it. Let's go.

181
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:07,291
What kind of drinks do you want?

182
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:15,466
DEFENDANT

183
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:18,427
It was an excuse...

184
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:27,603
that I wanted to find out
the truth of my son's case.

185
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:30,147
As an officer of the law,

186
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:31,982
who should uphold the law

187
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:34,318
and abide by the law more than anyone,

188
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:39,865
I deeply regret for committing
unlawful acts such as illegal arrests...

189
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:42,618
and wrongful imprisonment.

190
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:44,537
However,

191
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:48,416
I'd like to tell you I didn't attempt
to commit murder.

192
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:51,710
I only took the weapon to the scene

193
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:55,256
as a defensive measure to protect myself

194
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:57,425
against a dangerous individual.

195
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:01,011
I did not intend to kill anyone.

196
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:02,304
I hope

197
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:04,807
the court will acknowledge this fact.

198
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:11,230
How will they rule?

199
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:12,481
I'm not sure.

200
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:15,401
If the attempted murder charge
gets dropped,

201
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:17,361
he'll probably receive probation.

202
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:45,097
Personally, Chief Prosecutor, I mean...

203
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:50,102
you're no longer our chief. Former chief.

204
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:54,607
Shame on you. I hope you know that.

205
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:57,610
See you.

206
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:16,629
-He's coming out.
-There he is!

207
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:20,174
What's your thought on the public's rage

208
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:23,010
that the chief prosecutor
violated the law?

209
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:25,262
Do those with power get off easily?

210
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:27,598
There's a heated controversy
surrounding your personal revenge.

211
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:28,724
What's your thought on that?

212
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:30,518
What about your dishonorable resignation?

213
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:32,811
-Did you have murderous intentions?
-Please say a few words.

214
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:35,022
-What's the truth?
-Please tell us what happened.

215
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:39,068
Chief Prosecutor Jang Mu-yeong
resigned dishonorably from his post.

216
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:40,611
The former chief prosecutor

217
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:42,488
became a suspect of investigation

218
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:45,824
and ended up being convicted
of the charges.

219
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:48,202
He remained silent when
reporters asked him questions...

220
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:51,705
How humiliating.
He's too old to be in that mess.

221
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:57,878
I've never been fond of him,

222
00:13:58,045 --> 00:14:00,464
but I feel really bad for him.

223
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:03,050
Goodness.

224
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:12,226
Seeing the two of you
is upsetting me even more.

225
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:15,479
Do you think you're more upset than I am?

226
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:18,857
Now, it's on me to support the two of you.

227
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:21,735
I'll work hard, Mr. Ji.

228
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:26,323
Me too. I'll work very hard as well.

229
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:31,662
Goodness. I feel like I've become
a daycare teacher.

230
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,834
Don't go anywhere, please.

231
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:39,003
We'll be good to you.

232
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:43,424
When is Jung Hyeon-su's final trial?

233
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,345
Defendant Jung Hyeon-su,

234
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:52,391
in the name of revenge for Park So-yeong,
who was a victim of a gang rape,

235
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,518
not only killed the gang rapists

236
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:57,229
but also killed the witnesses
who got in his way, without reservation,

237
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:58,689
in a brutal manner.

238
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:03,402
Moreover, the defendant continued
to justify his crimes

239
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:05,362
without feeling any guilt or remorse.

240
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:09,658
He actually became enraged
that his murderous acts were stopped.

241
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:11,994
Taking into account...

242
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,915
that he committed a series
of brutal first-degree murders,

243
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:19,793
and that he's not repenting
or regretting at all,

244
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:24,465
the prosecution requests
that he receives a life sentence

245
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:26,926
in order to completely separate him
from the society.

246
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,701
COURT IN SESSION

247
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:56,664
Considering how the defendant
violated the laws and committed

248
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:58,248
a series of murders
in the name of revenge,

249
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:03,545
as well as the ruthlessness
and violent nature of his criminal acts,

250
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,548
I sentence the defendant, Jung Hyeon-su,

251
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:08,801
to lifetime imprisonment.

252
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:26,568
Congratulations, Ms. Eun.

253
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:30,489
You've finally proved your innocence.

254
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:51,885
Congratulations.

255
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:05,107
Thank you.

256
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:17,578
Mom.

257
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:21,498
Bong-hui.

258
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,001
My daughter.

259
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:32,134
Mom, I am now officially innocent.

260
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:34,678
I've finally proved my innocence.

261
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:37,473
Yes, I know too.

262
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:39,308
Your troubles are over.

263
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:42,561
Congratulations, my daughter.

264
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:46,523
I know it's been hard on you as well.

265
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:04,458
Mom.

266
00:18:06,543 --> 00:18:07,878
About Dad...

267
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,924
It'd be really great...

268
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,927
if I could prove his innocence as well.

269
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,395
Bong-hui.

270
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:30,150
I wanted to resolve the issue
about your dad...

271
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:34,488
but there's nothing
that can be done legally.

272
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,615
Since he wasn't actually charged
back then,

273
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:38,492
there's no evidence to correct it.

274
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:42,621
And the statute of limitations
for defaming the dead is only three years.

275
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:50,462
I'm really sorry.

276
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,392
It doesn't matter.

277
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:05,811
What matters is
that the living are well and happy.

278
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:07,563
But still...

279
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:11,441
At least you cleared your name.
That's good enough.

280
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:14,820
I wish for no more.
I'm sure your dad thinks the same.

281
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:18,615
This is good enough.

282
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:20,576
I bet he's thinking that now.

283
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:24,913
Okay.

284
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:29,585
Let's go home. I'll make you
something delicious.

285
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,170
We should celebrate.

286
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:35,132
Oh, actually...

287
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,802
Gosh, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

288
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:41,555
I'm supposed to meet up with someone.

289
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:42,806
You are?

290
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:44,808
Gosh, are you...

291
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:48,353
Are you meeting up
with the handsome Mr. Noh?

292
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:52,566
PROSECUTOR NOH JI-UK

293
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,323
If you just take a wallet left behind,
it's against Criminal Law, Article 360,

294
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:01,116
embezzlement of a lost property.

295
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,993
Why did you take someone else's belonging?

296
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:04,620
I apologize.

297
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:07,164
The victim has agreed to settle,
so please write a formal apology

298
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:08,624
as well as a letter of appeal. Got it?

299
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:10,959
-Yes, sir.
-You may leave now.

300
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,503
-Have a good day.
-Sure.

301
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:19,760
All right. Then I should

302
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:21,970
leave for the day now.

303
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:24,556
Wait, where are you going?

304
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:26,683
We're done for the day, right?

305
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:29,603
No, wait. We got additional cases.

306
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:39,279
Well, when did we get assigned
to so many additional cases?

307
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:40,656
Earlier in the day.

308
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:43,700
I guess you didn't hear it,
being busy with paperwork.

309
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:45,327
It happened earlier in the day.

310
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:51,375
-Damn it.
-Did you just swear at me?

311
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,627
No, I wasn't swearing.

312
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:56,713
Hurry up. Come on.
Tell them to come in right away.

313
00:20:58,382 --> 00:20:59,383
Gosh.

314
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:02,636
Please hurry up.

315
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:07,849
I'm sorry. I'll be a bit late.
Will you be all right?

316
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:10,269
I love waiting.

317
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:13,855
HONEY

318
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:17,901
That sounds so desperate.

319
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:23,073
I'll be fine. Take your time.

320
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:35,585
DATE SPOTS

321
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:38,630
10 BEST DATE SPOTS IN SEOUL

322
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:50,600
I'm really sorry.
It'll take me a bit longer.

323
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,730
It's okay. Take your time.

324
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:11,538
Name, Go Min-su.

325
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:15,208
Date of birth, July 13, 1975.

326
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:18,128
Ilsan, Gyeonggi Province.

327
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:20,881
Look. From the CCTV footage to your DNA,

328
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:22,924
there's so much evidence.

329
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,217
Please just admit it.

330
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:25,886
If you don't, I won't give you a chance

331
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:27,721
to appeal to get your sentence reduced.

332
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:29,973
I don't have time now,
so I feel very rushed at the moment.

333
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:33,351
Hence, I can't be understanding.
I have a very important appointment,

334
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:34,936
so I can give you exactly 30 seconds.

335
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,731
I usually give people two minutes
when I'm not in a rush,

336
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:40,192
but I can't give you more than
30 seconds now. Confess now.

337
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:44,446
All right, here we go.
One, two, three, four,

338
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:45,989
five, come on, six.

339
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:49,993
Just come with me, please.

340
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:53,371
Yu-jeong, do you have no one

341
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:55,749
to eat and drink with besides me?

342
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:56,750
I have nobody.

343
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:58,543
Goodness.

344
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,462
Eat with me.

345
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:02,255
-Please?
-Yes, let's eat together.

346
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:04,800
Gosh, seriously.

347
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:05,884
Let's go.

348
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:10,347
Hey! Wait up.

349
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:16,645
He'll stand you up many times
from now on, Ms. Eun.

350
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:19,981
Prosecutors' workload is crazy,

351
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:21,191
and Ji-uk...

352
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:22,943
can be a workaholic.

353
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:27,072
Are you trying to give me
a piece of advice

354
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:29,658
as his ex-girlfriend?

355
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:32,410
Gosh, is this a scene
from a bad drama or what?

356
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:36,498
Hey, my ex-boyfriend
cheated on me with you.

357
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:41,253
-Oh, right. Ji-hae.
-What?

358
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:43,171
Are you interested in Eun-hyeok?

359
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:46,049
What will you do if I say yes?

360
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:47,425
My gosh.

361
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:49,761
Why do you always fall
for guys that are taken?

362
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:51,304
-Please don't be like that.
-Hey.

363
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:54,558
I had no idea that he was already taken.

364
00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:55,809
I really didn't know.

365
00:23:55,892 --> 00:23:57,811
Hey, does Eun-hyeok like someone?

366
00:23:58,645 --> 00:23:59,521
Who?

367
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,648
Gosh, how obnoxious.

368
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:02,858
Yes, a little.

369
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:06,069
Why? Who is it? Tell me.

370
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:10,949
Gosh, who is she?
You guys have to tell me.

371
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:12,075
Have this.

372
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:14,536
-Who is she?
-Here.

373
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:18,290
Who is it?

374
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:23,295
Hey, Ji-uk!

375
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,339
Why are you here?

376
00:24:27,465 --> 00:24:29,259
Oh, Ms. Eun must've called you.

377
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:32,512
-Are you here because of Yu-jeong?
-What?

378
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:35,682
Yes, and Prosecutor Na.

379
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:38,560
And Prosecutor Na?

380
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:43,315
It looks like you got the wrong idea.
It's not what you think.

381
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:45,817
You did get the wrong idea.
Hey, it's not like that. Ji-uk.

382
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:46,985
Goodness.

383
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:53,491
My gosh.

384
00:24:58,455 --> 00:24:59,664
Mr. Ji.

385
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:03,460
Did you use me?

386
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:04,794
Pardon me?

387
00:25:05,086 --> 00:25:07,881
Hey, Eun-hyeok. Are you seeing someone?

388
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:08,840
What?

389
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:11,384
Gosh, what are you saying?

390
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:15,889
All right. Let's get out of here.

391
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:17,933
Hey, wait. Are you seriously

392
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:19,601
leaving me alone here with these two?

393
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:21,478
-Hi, Mr. Ji.
-Hi.

394
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:24,397
Eun-hyeok, you honestly
shouldn't live your life like that.

395
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:26,650
Got it? Behave yourself, please.

396
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:32,614
This is not right.

397
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:47,087
Are you okay?

398
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,088
Yes.

399
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:56,638
Why? What's wrong?
Do you feel like throwing up?

400
00:25:57,764 --> 00:25:58,890
Goodness.

401
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:01,685
Hey, don't tease me.

402
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:04,354
There! I'm going to cover your eyes.

403
00:26:04,562 --> 00:26:06,231
Don't do that. I can't see anything.

404
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:10,819
Hey, I won't buy it this time.

405
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:12,153
No, it's real this time.

406
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:13,280
Are you serious?

407
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:14,614
I was kidding.

408
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:18,702
Bong-hui, stop messing with me!

409
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:21,246
Be careful.

410
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:25,959
-Take your shoes off.
-Right, my shoes.

411
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:27,043
There.

412
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:32,465
Why did you drink so much?

413
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:35,260
-Eun-hyeok.
-Yes.

414
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:38,305
Ji-hae. Where did Ji-hae go?

415
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:42,142
Yu-jeong, we just took her home
before coming up here.

416
00:26:42,225 --> 00:26:43,518
You remember, right?

417
00:26:44,602 --> 00:26:46,146
That's right. We did.

418
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:49,316
You used to hold your liquor well.
What happened?

419
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:51,609
That was back in the old days.

420
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:53,403
These days, my body changes every year.

421
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:54,904
That is true.

422
00:26:55,613 --> 00:26:57,657
You should wash up and go to bed.

423
00:26:57,741 --> 00:26:58,908
-I'll get going.
-Okay.

424
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:00,327
Good night.

425
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:02,871
Hey.

426
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:19,596
Hey, are you all right?

427
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:21,181
Yes.

428
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:23,516
I'm fine.

429
00:27:26,102 --> 00:27:26,978
Okay.

430
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,857
Hey, you should head off to bed.

431
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:32,025
I'll be off.

432
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:50,668
I'm sorry.

433
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:54,589
I must be really drunk right now.

434
00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:29,499
Sorry.

435
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:00,447
Did you sleep well?

436
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:04,242
-Did you sleep well?
-Yes.

437
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:11,499
What happened?

438
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:15,462
Don't you remember?

439
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:20,592
You don't?

440
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:26,014
Goodness.

441
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:29,184
I'll bring you some water.

442
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:33,104
Last night, did we...

443
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:35,148
What?

444
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:37,942
What I'm asking is...

445
00:29:39,235 --> 00:29:41,321
I can't remember, but did we...

446
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:43,156
What I mean is...

447
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:45,533
You know what I mean.

448
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:50,163
Well, you know. I'm...

449
00:29:51,247 --> 00:29:53,041
not exactly

450
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:54,250
a saint.

451
00:29:57,712 --> 00:30:00,089
Why wouldn't I remember it?
I do, of course.

452
00:30:07,847 --> 00:30:09,599
I got here so early.

453
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:12,185
You are early.
I think I'll be a little late.

454
00:30:12,435 --> 00:30:13,436
Get going. Bye.

455
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,354
Bye.

456
00:30:19,108 --> 00:30:20,902
-There's your morning kiss.
-Morning kiss?

457
00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:29,661
Oh, really?

458
00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:32,247
I love that too.

459
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:37,585
Yes, that's right.
I had such a crazy day today.

460
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:40,129
I had so many out-of-office meetings,

461
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:42,590
then when I got back to the office,

462
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:45,301
I was greeted by a big pile of paperwork.

463
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:09,576
We spent the whole night
talking about pointless things.

464
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:20,378
Why don't you stay here like before?

465
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:22,839
No, then there's no tension.

466
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:25,049
Have a good day at work.

467
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:26,759
Come on...

468
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:36,019
We just can't bear
to be away from each other.

469
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:07,717
-Look at his face.
-Oh, no.

470
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:19,938
I am you,

471
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:21,981
and you are me.

472
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:24,359
Every day is perfect with you.

473
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:46,714
Hey, Eun-hyeok. Mr. Ji.

474
00:32:47,548 --> 00:32:48,466
Hey, Yu-jeong.

475
00:32:48,716 --> 00:32:50,593
The weather today is great.

476
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:52,971
No, it's hot and humid.

477
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:55,890
I see. Really?

478
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:58,559
I guess it's going to be summer soon.

479
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:00,395
It's been summer for quite some time.

480
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:02,563
Is that so?

481
00:33:02,855 --> 00:33:03,815
You're right.

482
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,985
I've been too busy to notice
the change of season.

483
00:33:07,443 --> 00:33:08,778
I'll get going. I'm busy.

484
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:10,029
Yu-jeong.

485
00:33:11,906 --> 00:33:15,118
Let's talk about us already.

486
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:43,104
I'm sorry about the other day.

487
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:45,440
Please consider it as a mistake.

488
00:33:45,773 --> 00:33:48,526
I was sort of feeble-minded at that time.

489
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,453
It was a mistake for you, wasn't it?

490
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:01,205
It wasn't for me.

491
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,875
I meant it.

492
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:05,668
Actually...

493
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:08,463
I had feelings for a long time.

494
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:10,506
Yu-jeong.

495
00:34:11,924 --> 00:34:14,802
You are inside my heart. Jeez.

496
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,900
I tried to stop having feelings for you.

497
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:32,737
I did everything in my power to do that.

498
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:35,782
But...

499
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:40,161
I always end up looking at you
like this, Yu-jeong.

500
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:45,541
So even if it was a mistake

501
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:48,961
and you were feeble-minded, I don't care.

502
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:52,423
Please like me back, Yu-jeong.

503
00:34:59,138 --> 00:35:00,098
Well...

504
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:04,102
I don't know...

505
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:06,854
how I feel about you yet.

506
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:10,108
I really like you,

507
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:15,154
but I'm confused if I like you
as a friend...

508
00:35:15,988 --> 00:35:16,864
or as a man.

509
00:35:19,158 --> 00:35:20,284
Is that still okay with you?

510
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:24,580
That's enough for me.

511
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:27,708
Why don't you want more?

512
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:29,043
What are you talking about?

513
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:32,213
I got more than I deserve.

514
00:35:37,009 --> 00:35:37,927
Eat up.

515
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:47,812
You hit your husband?

516
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:52,567
May I ask why?

517
00:35:55,027 --> 00:35:56,195
That is...

518
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:05,997
Honey, your meal is ready.

519
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,083
Your meal is ready.

520
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:11,002
Okay. I got it.

521
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:12,753
Goodness.

522
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:35,693
You hit your husband
in the back of his head with a bat?

523
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:37,904
Yes.

524
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:40,031
She only struck once.

525
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:43,409
Since bats are included on the list
of dangerous items,

526
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:45,661
according to Clause 2 of Article 258
of Criminal Law,

527
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:47,997
this is considered
as a felony assault charge.

528
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:52,710
With this charge, you may face
a minimum of one year

529
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:54,212
to 10 years in prison.

530
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:56,339
Then do I have to go to prison?

531
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:58,507
You may get probation.

532
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:01,719
That may not happen as well.

533
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:07,475
So what was your reason?

534
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:10,394
My husband cheated on me.

535
00:37:10,811 --> 00:37:14,273
I hit him in the back of the head
impulsively.

536
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:18,527
But still. That doesn't justify your act.

537
00:37:18,694 --> 00:37:19,946
I'm sorry.

538
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:22,531
The injury is minor.

539
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:24,909
He gave her the reason
attributable to her action.

540
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:26,953
His affidavit states
he doesn't want her punished.

541
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:30,081
Don't you think it's enough for her
to get probation, Prosecutor Noh?

542
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:34,418
That's for me to decide, Ms. Eun.

543
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:42,718
When did your husband's affair start?

544
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:44,178
Well...

545
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:47,431
It started in July 1987.

546
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:49,350
It started in July 1987?

547
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:58,276
Did you say it started in 1987?

548
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,279
-Yes.
-It happened 30 years ago.

549
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:04,073
Due to the shock and anger at that moment,

550
00:38:04,156 --> 00:38:06,367
she lifted the bat without realizing
what she was doing.

551
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:09,787
I've been putting up with him
for a long time.

552
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:15,126
I see. The affair happened 30 years ago.

553
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:16,919
You put up with him.

554
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:21,465
30 years?

555
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:26,804
You can't understand her?
I understand her a bit though.

556
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:29,223
I don't know. I don't think
I can understand her.

557
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:32,059
Hear me out. It happened 30 year ago.

558
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:35,563
If his affair traumatized
and hurt her deeply,

559
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:39,317
she should've whether divorced him
or hit him.

560
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,695
She could have wanted to do that,
but perhaps, she wasn't able to.

561
00:38:42,778 --> 00:38:44,238
Maybe for the sake of her children,

562
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,907
or for financial reasons
she had to put up with him.

563
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:49,910
Even if that's true, it was her decision.

564
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:52,538
Come on. That's not her decision.

565
00:38:52,621 --> 00:38:54,915
What? Then whose decision is it?

566
00:38:56,792 --> 00:39:00,379
Anyway, think about how devastated
and sad she must've been

567
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:03,966
to hit him after 30 years.

568
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:06,052
I bet she was miserable.

569
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:11,057
Regardless of her reason, this is
an assault. This isn't right.

570
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:14,477
I don't mean to justify her action.

571
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:18,022
The point is that she must
have felt miserable.

572
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:21,984
Why did she hold a grudge
for 30 years to start with?

573
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:23,736
Say that she couldn't divorce him.

574
00:39:23,819 --> 00:39:25,363
Then she should've been angry at him.

575
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:29,283
It's not as simple as you say.

576
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:31,786
She tried to put up with him,

577
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:33,704
but she couldn't and went berserk.

578
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:36,415
Why did she go berserk?
She should've been up front--

579
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:38,459
Okay. I got it.

580
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:42,546
My client made a mistake.
She did a horrible thing.

581
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:46,884
What I meant to say was

582
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:50,137
it could have developed
into a murder within the family.

583
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:51,639
I think you are jumping to conclusions.

584
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:54,642
You're making my client into a murderer

585
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:57,186
just because she struck the bat once.

586
00:39:57,269 --> 00:39:59,021
No, I wasn't.

587
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:01,399
Hear me out. What I said was...

588
00:40:05,277 --> 00:40:09,198
It's harder for me to understand
why we are fighting over this.

589
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:15,830
Bong-hui, this doesn't concern us.

590
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:20,042
Besides, we don't keep hurt feelings
inside. We never fight due to them.

591
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:22,920
What makes you think that?

592
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:24,630
You do?

593
00:40:24,713 --> 00:40:27,550
The other day, you didn't kiss me.

594
00:40:29,718 --> 00:40:31,345
Give me a morning kiss then.

595
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:37,184
Do you know how hurtful that was?

596
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:40,271
Goodness. You know that day--

597
00:40:40,354 --> 00:40:41,939
By the way, I can understand that.

598
00:40:42,064 --> 00:40:44,066
I understand your feelings at that time,

599
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:48,112
but whenever I think about it,
it still upsets me.

600
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:51,031
Watch your head.

601
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:53,284
My grudges might explode
in 30 years from now.

602
00:40:57,163 --> 00:40:59,540
Bong-hui. Bong-hui, wait.

603
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:09,550
By the way, why is this one
looking so downcast today?

604
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:11,093
He does seem upset.

605
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:13,429
Did you and Ms. Eun have a fight?

606
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:15,431
Why?

607
00:41:17,224 --> 00:41:20,394
Hey, what is it? What did you do wrong?

608
00:41:23,063 --> 00:41:24,148
It's...

609
00:41:25,232 --> 00:41:27,568
I know what I've done wrong,

610
00:41:27,776 --> 00:41:31,363
but at the same time,
I can't fully understand what I did wrong.

611
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:33,991
That's why I can't date anyone.

612
00:41:34,366 --> 00:41:36,243
It's so hard to understand
what women want.

613
00:41:36,368 --> 00:41:38,496
Hey, guys. Stop.

614
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:40,539
When it comes to things like that,

615
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:43,250
you should come to me for advice.

616
00:41:44,376 --> 00:41:45,377
Has any one of you

617
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:48,714
lived longer with a woman than I have?

618
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:50,466
No, right?

619
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:55,554
My experience of living with my wife
for 30 something years taught me

620
00:41:55,721 --> 00:41:57,306
that there's only one right answer.

621
00:41:57,932 --> 00:42:01,477
When your woman seems to be
in a bad mood, just be servile.

622
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:03,771
And say, I'm sorry.

623
00:42:04,104 --> 00:42:06,524
Then you guys will have
nothing to worry about.

624
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:09,193
-In any circumstances?
-Yes, absolutely.

625
00:42:10,444 --> 00:42:11,695
I'm sorry.

626
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:13,906
Okay.

627
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:19,078
-What are you sorry about?
-What?

628
00:42:19,161 --> 00:42:22,873
Be specific. I'm asking
exactly what you're sorry about.

629
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:27,294
It's... I can certainly answer that.

630
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:30,464
I'm sorry about everything.

631
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:33,509
You don't even know what you should
be sorry about, do you?

632
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:37,012
I do. I know, of course.

633
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:41,850
Oh, right.
I drank a little bit last night--

634
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:43,477
You drank?

635
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:45,145
You said you didn't.

636
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:49,400
I just had one drink.

637
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:52,611
Let's talk about that in a bit.

638
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:57,074
I wasn't talking about that.
What else did you do wrong?

639
00:43:00,202 --> 00:43:01,870
See? Look at you.

640
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:03,330
You have no clue.

641
00:43:03,455 --> 00:43:05,958
Do you think saying sorry
will solve all problems?

642
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:08,752
Have you forgotten?

643
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:12,381
You didn't even tell me about my son
getting stabbed in his stomach.

644
00:43:12,464 --> 00:43:14,466
Oh, that? Gosh.

645
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:16,468
That was because

646
00:43:16,552 --> 00:43:19,805
I didn't want to worry you
while you were on a trip for once--

647
00:43:19,888 --> 00:43:21,223
Be quiet!

648
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,434
My trip wasn't a big deal at all.

649
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:27,646
Gosh, seriously... I hate you so much.

650
00:43:29,356 --> 00:43:30,858
The injury wasn't that serious.

651
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:36,030
It's so hot.

652
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:41,535
Why are you making yourself sweat
so much this late? It's so hot.

653
00:43:41,827 --> 00:43:43,704
I'm just so mad.

654
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:44,788
Why are you mad?

655
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:50,836
Mr. Noh and I had our very first fight.

656
00:43:51,211 --> 00:43:53,422
Really? That's good.

657
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:56,258
Indeed. Why is it making me happy?

658
00:44:00,387 --> 00:44:02,348
I just really don't understand it.

659
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:06,935
We cared about each other so much
even while we were going through all that.

660
00:44:07,227 --> 00:44:09,647
Why did we fight over something
so little and insignificant?

661
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:11,315
It's making me so upset and confused.

662
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:14,151
It's because...

663
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:17,237
the mundane can be terrifying.

664
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:21,450
When people around you
are against your relationship,

665
00:44:21,533 --> 00:44:23,160
the love between the two of you deepens,

666
00:44:23,243 --> 00:44:25,162
and you'd be glued to each other.

667
00:44:25,245 --> 00:44:26,580
-Then...
-Then?

668
00:44:26,955 --> 00:44:29,416
Let's say that all problems
and hindrances go away,

669
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:33,170
and people are like, "All right.
Do whatever you two want to do."

670
00:44:33,295 --> 00:44:36,590
That's when couples fight and break up.

671
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:37,883
That's when problems arise.

672
00:44:37,966 --> 00:44:39,677
-Why is that?
-I'm curious too.

673
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:41,970
When there's no external problems,

674
00:44:42,054 --> 00:44:44,098
problems ought to arise internally.

675
00:44:44,598 --> 00:44:46,767
Both of you will start noticing
each other's flaws

676
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:49,186
and discover reasons why
you may not be compatible.

677
00:44:49,269 --> 00:44:51,563
Then you'd get bored
of each other as well.

678
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:53,941
That's

679
00:44:54,316 --> 00:44:56,944
what will happen in your near future.

680
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:01,198
Cut it out.

681
00:45:01,698 --> 00:45:03,826
I'm only stating a fact.
I'm being serious.

682
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:08,497
Can you hit her once more?

683
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:12,042
It's what awaits you in your near future.

684
00:45:12,292 --> 00:45:13,460
What was that about?

685
00:45:28,851 --> 00:45:29,768
Hey, Bong-hui.

686
00:45:35,607 --> 00:45:36,942
I'm sorry.

687
00:45:38,527 --> 00:45:39,862
What are you sorry about?

688
00:45:42,197 --> 00:45:43,073
What?

689
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:46,577
Well, this isn't how it's supposed to go.

690
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:47,953
What do you mean?

691
00:45:49,037 --> 00:45:51,582
I'm sorry about everything.

692
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:52,875
I don't know.

693
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:56,086
Just like the prediction,

694
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:58,005
our peaceful day-to-day life
gave us something

695
00:45:58,422 --> 00:46:00,507
called an internal conflict.

696
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:08,724
Bong-hui, you're back!

697
00:46:08,807 --> 00:46:11,226
You must've missed me so much
and realized you want to live with me.

698
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:12,519
That's why you're back, right?

699
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:13,604
No, it's not.

700
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:16,273
I have an interview with the media today.

701
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:18,442
About how my innocence was proved.

702
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:22,029
I have to take photos,
so I brought all of my clothes.

703
00:46:32,915 --> 00:46:33,916
You look stunning.

704
00:46:35,792 --> 00:46:38,086
No way. I'm not happy with this outfit.

705
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:46,053
Yes, this one is pretty good.

706
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:47,554
You look amazing.

707
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:49,431
You should be honest.

708
00:47:04,404 --> 00:47:05,405
You look...

709
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:09,826
I don't know how I feel about
the bow being right in the middle.

710
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:13,872
The stripes might look
a bit too distracting as well.

711
00:47:13,956 --> 00:47:17,501
This one is my favorite outfit so far.

712
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:21,255
And discovering the unexpected things
about each other came as a surprise.

713
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:28,136
ONE YEAR LATER

714
00:47:31,056 --> 00:47:32,349
Don't blame me.

715
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:34,935
Blame the chief prosecutor who keeps
assigning you all the cases.

716
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:39,606
And blame yourself for getting selected
as the worst prosecutor every year.

717
00:47:46,154 --> 00:47:47,781
This is... Gosh.

718
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:49,741
I have too much work to do.

719
00:47:56,582 --> 00:47:57,624
Darn it.

720
00:47:57,916 --> 00:47:58,959
Bong-hui, I don't think...

721
00:47:59,793 --> 00:48:01,545
I can have dinner with you today.

722
00:48:02,087 --> 00:48:03,255
What should I do?

723
00:48:09,469 --> 00:48:12,097
Whatever.
He prioritizes work over me anyway.

724
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:15,809
My gosh, I apologize. Where were we?

725
00:48:15,892 --> 00:48:17,311
-So I was...
-Yes.

726
00:48:17,477 --> 00:48:19,688
And we fought
about such little, insignificant matters.

727
00:48:19,771 --> 00:48:22,441
It's a little embarrassing
for me to talk about it.

728
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:25,152
It's really okay. You can be open with me.

729
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:26,903
-My husband...
-Yes.

730
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:34,119
That's why I want to divorce him.

731
00:48:34,202 --> 00:48:36,747
My eyes were glued to my phone
on my way to work,

732
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:40,709
but a woman started screaming
suddenly, calling me a pervert.

733
00:48:41,209 --> 00:48:42,711
I can pick out perverts from faraway.

734
00:48:42,794 --> 00:48:43,795
I'm so glad you came to me.

735
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:46,548
Could you please give me
the details of what happened?

736
00:49:01,063 --> 00:49:02,898
How can she do this to me?

737
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:05,192
-What are you talking about?
-This girl

738
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:08,403
has been off the grid for 3 days.
She hasn't called me at all.

739
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:10,072
-Did you two fight again?
-It wasn't a fight.

740
00:49:10,155 --> 00:49:11,823
I'm a victim.

741
00:49:11,907 --> 00:49:14,868
She's not telling me what I did wrong...

742
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:18,872
Hello, Ms. Eun. What brings you here?

743
00:49:19,164 --> 00:49:21,208
I'm here to eat jjajangmyeon, Mr. Bang.

744
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:23,460
Do you think this is a Chinese restaurant
or what?

745
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:24,836
Shall I leave?

746
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:25,962
No. Don't go, Bong-hui.

747
00:49:26,922 --> 00:49:27,923
Sit. Have a seat.

748
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:30,050
Please have a seat.

749
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:31,551
Please come tidy this up.

750
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:34,680
I got it.

751
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:38,684
-Shall I give you a hand?
-No, it's okay. Just relax.

752
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:40,060
It's Golden Gate, right?

753
00:49:40,268 --> 00:49:42,688
We'd like one double portion
jjajangmyeon with seafood...

754
00:49:42,771 --> 00:49:44,648
-I want the regular size.
-and two regular sizes.

755
00:49:44,731 --> 00:49:46,817
Plus sweet-and-sour pork,
spicy chicken, and chili shrimp.

756
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:49,111
We'll get every famous dish
your restaurant is known for.

757
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:51,405
My girlfriend whom I love so much
is here to see me.

758
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:52,989
Just send us everything on your menu.

759
00:49:53,073 --> 00:49:54,157
Thank you.

760
00:49:55,283 --> 00:49:56,827
Yet our peaceful day-to-day life

761
00:49:56,910 --> 00:49:59,705
still goes on as if nothing happened.

762
00:50:11,007 --> 00:50:12,300
Did something happen, Yu-jeong?

763
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:14,052
No.

764
00:50:20,934 --> 00:50:22,060
Eun-hyeok.

765
00:50:22,978 --> 00:50:25,188
You were out drinking last night,
yet you didn't even call me,

766
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:26,648
or answer my calls.

767
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:33,822
You know the company
where I act as an adviser, right?

768
00:50:33,905 --> 00:50:35,782
They had a team dinner last night.

769
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:39,911
It went on until very late.
I thought you'd be sleeping.

770
00:50:40,078 --> 00:50:42,748
And I crashed because I drank quite a bit.

771
00:50:48,503 --> 00:50:50,672
I won't do it again. Please?

772
00:50:51,173 --> 00:50:52,257
Whatever.

773
00:50:52,841 --> 00:50:54,676
Wait. I saw you smile.

774
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:00,098
Don't ever do that again.

775
00:51:00,182 --> 00:51:02,392
Okay. Here you go. Eat up.

776
00:51:03,185 --> 00:51:06,521
I was going to call you,
and I will from now on.

777
00:51:08,815 --> 00:51:10,400
It's not even funny now.

778
00:51:12,068 --> 00:51:16,698
It's better than them laughing loudly.

779
00:51:29,211 --> 00:51:33,006
Do you still get butterflies
and fall for him

780
00:51:33,089 --> 00:51:35,217
when you see Mr. Noh?

781
00:51:35,842 --> 00:51:37,260
What are you talking about?

782
00:51:38,428 --> 00:51:39,471
Are you drunk?

783
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:42,140
You don't, right?

784
00:51:42,224 --> 00:51:45,477
It's crazy if you still have
butterflies and fall for him.

785
00:51:45,602 --> 00:51:46,853
Sometimes, I still fall for him.

786
00:51:52,567 --> 00:51:54,027
She's so annoying.

787
00:51:56,238 --> 00:51:59,199
What's wrong with you?

788
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:06,039
PROSECUTOR

789
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:09,334
DEFENSE COUNSEL

790
00:52:18,343 --> 00:52:20,720
The statement and testimony of the victim
about witnessing

791
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:23,765
defendant Kang Jin-uk's public obscenity
are consistent.

792
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:27,477
Since the statement and testimony
are identical to what happened...

793
00:52:27,894 --> 00:52:31,231
There is no direct evidence
such as the CCTV or dash cam footages.

794
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:34,150
Your Honor, there isn't any
other witness as well.

795
00:52:34,234 --> 00:52:38,363
However, the defendant has
a record of arrest for public obscenity.

796
00:52:38,446 --> 00:52:42,409
The order of how he took off his clothes
is exactly the same.

797
00:52:43,368 --> 00:52:45,662
If I had to tell you the order
how he stripped...

798
00:52:45,745 --> 00:52:48,665
He took off his jacket first
and his pants next.

799
00:52:48,748 --> 00:52:51,459
He took off his shirt after that.
This was the order.

800
00:52:51,751 --> 00:52:53,545
Don't you think

801
00:52:53,628 --> 00:52:57,257
it's cruel to condemn the victim
that he committed the crime

802
00:52:57,382 --> 00:52:59,342
because he has a similar record?

803
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:03,263
Besides, the order how he stripped
can't be used as part of his claim.

804
00:53:03,763 --> 00:53:06,057
The defendant is receiving therapies

805
00:53:06,141 --> 00:53:07,767
since he is an exhibitionist.

806
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:10,353
Your Honor, according to the records,
just like in this court,

807
00:53:10,478 --> 00:53:12,439
the bigger the crowd

808
00:53:12,522 --> 00:53:15,650
and the more attention people give him,

809
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:18,987
his desire for public obscenity
grows stronger.

810
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:21,990
He diligently went to therapies.

811
00:53:22,073 --> 00:53:23,241
Because he did his best,

812
00:53:23,325 --> 00:53:24,451
-Hey!
-today...

813
00:53:28,121 --> 00:53:29,539
It's considered that his condition--

814
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:30,999
-has been fully treated.
-His pants!

815
00:53:32,125 --> 00:53:35,170
Also, the defendant-- Stop it. Don't move.

816
00:53:42,761 --> 00:53:45,055
Goodness, how can he try to strip
in court?

817
00:53:45,138 --> 00:53:46,556
I can't understand him.

818
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,642
I told you not to defend him.

819
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:50,393
I told you that he was a complete pervert.

820
00:53:50,602 --> 00:53:53,188
Mr. Noh, I'm trying to make a living.
That's all.

821
00:53:53,271 --> 00:53:55,774
There are 20,000 lawyers.
I can't be picky about my clients.

822
00:53:55,857 --> 00:53:58,610
Yes, I wish you were picky.

823
00:53:58,818 --> 00:54:02,489
By the way, your father, Mr. Byeon,
accepted this case.

824
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:05,075
Goodness, Mr. Byeon.

825
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:08,411
Oh, right.
Today, the defendant was a pervert.

826
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:12,374
But how can you always come at me hard
every single time, not to lose?

827
00:54:12,457 --> 00:54:15,460
When did I do that?
Hey, what about you then?

828
00:54:15,543 --> 00:54:16,753
You came at me harder than I did.

829
00:54:16,836 --> 00:54:17,921
Let's break up.

830
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:21,049
Bong-hui, why do you always say that
after a trial?

831
00:54:21,132 --> 00:54:22,342
-That's a habit.
-Not true.

832
00:54:22,425 --> 00:54:24,219
-I didn't say that every time.
-Yes, you did.

833
00:54:24,302 --> 00:54:25,762
You said that after the last two trials.

834
00:54:25,887 --> 00:54:27,180
You just exaggerated.

835
00:54:27,263 --> 00:54:28,932
What are you talking about?

836
00:54:30,558 --> 00:54:32,268
-I hope...
-Do you want to have dinner?

837
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:33,353
Noodles or rice?

838
00:54:33,478 --> 00:54:35,605
-I hope...
-Noodles, okay.

839
00:54:35,689 --> 00:54:38,775
our normal and insignificant days would

840
00:54:39,317 --> 00:54:40,610
continue.

841
00:54:48,576 --> 00:54:50,370
We have more applicants than expected.

842
00:54:50,453 --> 00:54:52,372
Let's choose the applicants
for the first round.

843
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:54,499
I will filter out their resumes.

844
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:56,668
You can't.

845
00:54:57,002 --> 00:54:59,295
You will pick the applicants
based on their looks.

846
00:55:01,297 --> 00:55:05,010
She did talk about recruiting
a younger, handsome lawyer.

847
00:55:09,681 --> 00:55:13,768
I wonder why you took
my joke so seriously.

848
00:55:14,769 --> 00:55:15,812
I second that.

849
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:20,567
But why are the people
who aren't part of the firm here?

850
00:55:21,568 --> 00:55:22,569
I know.

851
00:55:24,446 --> 00:55:26,489
This is my house too.

852
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:29,075
Hey, this is an office.

853
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:33,204
That's right. I pay you rent every month.

854
00:55:33,538 --> 00:55:34,664
I'm going to raise the rent.

855
00:55:34,748 --> 00:55:36,458
Gosh, you're so petty.

856
00:55:36,541 --> 00:55:38,418
Come on! Seriously.

857
00:55:39,461 --> 00:55:42,839
Ms. Eun will evaluate the applicants.
What is our next agenda?

858
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:46,301
We got an offer from a radio show
for a legal consultation segment.

859
00:55:46,384 --> 00:55:48,803
-I think--
-The word "radio" jogs my memory.

860
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:51,181
Back in my old days...

861
00:55:51,389 --> 00:55:52,807
There he goes again.

862
00:55:53,266 --> 00:55:58,063
I proposed to my wife
through a radio show.

863
00:55:59,355 --> 00:56:03,193
Who was the DJ of the show?
It's on the tip of my tongue.

864
00:56:03,443 --> 00:56:07,113
At that time, I was quite the romantic.

865
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:09,491
Now she's become a bit weird,
but at that time, she was pretty.

866
00:56:09,574 --> 00:56:11,868
Hey! Where are you going?

867
00:56:12,243 --> 00:56:14,996
-Those punks.
-I'm so lonely.

868
00:56:15,163 --> 00:56:16,414
Why aren't you leaving with them?

869
00:56:17,332 --> 00:56:18,583
Should I leave as well?

870
00:56:19,417 --> 00:56:20,710
Just stay.

871
00:56:24,547 --> 00:56:26,299
Gosh, the weather is great.

872
00:56:26,424 --> 00:56:28,009
Yes, it's great.

873
00:56:33,348 --> 00:56:35,391
How can there be no one here?

874
00:56:52,033 --> 00:56:52,992
Bong-hui.

875
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:54,994
Yes?

876
00:57:12,137 --> 00:57:13,054
I love you.

877
00:57:16,641 --> 00:57:17,767
I love you too.

878
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:37,871
I...

879
00:57:41,541 --> 00:57:42,750
will love you forever.

880
00:57:51,885 --> 00:57:54,762
Are you proposing to me now?

881
00:57:56,973 --> 00:57:57,849
Yes.

882
00:58:01,978 --> 00:58:05,023
Where's your song?
You don't have a song for me?

883
00:58:05,607 --> 00:58:06,524
A song?

884
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:11,321
Well...

885
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:24,542
Even if you don't sing for me...

886
00:58:27,795 --> 00:58:29,380
my answer is yes.

887
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:39,057
I will...

888
00:58:40,391 --> 00:58:41,643
love you forever too.

889
00:58:55,990 --> 00:59:01,913
There are so many reasons

890
00:59:02,163 --> 00:59:05,917
Why I love you

891
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:10,880
-I'm so happy...
-I'm so happy...

892
00:59:12,215 --> 00:59:13,508
-that I met you.
-that I met you.

893
00:59:14,759 --> 00:59:16,594
-I'm grateful I met you.
-I'm grateful I met you.

894
01:00:36,924 --> 01:00:39,218
