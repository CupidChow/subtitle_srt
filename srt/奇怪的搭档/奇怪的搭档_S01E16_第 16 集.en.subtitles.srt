1
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:51,843
What are you trying to do, Bong-hui?

2
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:06,649
Sentencing.

3
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,016
Let's...

4
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:44,979
break up.

5
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:03,081
When...

6
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:08,002
did you find out?

7
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:15,176
What about you, Mr. Noh?
When did you find out...

8
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:17,053
about my dad?

9
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:18,888
Recently.

10
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,557
Then why didn't you tell me?

11
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:23,810
Why did you suffer all alone?

12
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,313
Because it doesn't matter to me.

13
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:28,606
What doesn't matter to you?

14
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,150
Nothing matters to me.

15
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:33,027
To me, it's not important
what kind of person...

16
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:37,157
-your dad was.
-What if it's important to me?

17
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:40,702
I'm asking you a question.

18
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:43,913
What if it matters to me?

19
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:47,542
All right. Let's hear it. Tell me.

20
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:50,295
I want to know what matters to you...

21
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:54,007
and what difference it's going to make.

22
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:00,388
It's painful.

23
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:02,765
What is?

24
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:05,643
Seeing you suffer because of me

25
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:07,228
pains me.

26
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:09,230
Fine. I won't suffer then.

27
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:11,608
What else?

28
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:18,156
My dad isn't the kind of a man
you think he is,

29
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:21,492
but I can't even make that claim.

30
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:36,841
Okay. Let's think about that.

31
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:38,384
And what else?

32
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:43,765
I just don't like
this whole situation we are in.

33
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,436
Don't you get what I'm saying?
I want to break up with you.

34
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:52,106
Don't try to change my mind,
and just let me go.

35
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:54,567
I don't want to.

36
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:58,780
I don't understand
what you are talking about now.

37
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:00,573
No matter what you tell me...

38
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:04,077
I won't ever let you go.

39
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:05,745
I don't want to.

40
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:11,709
It won't work even if you try to stop me.

41
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:18,841
Even if you try to stop me,
I'm going to leave.

42
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:02,302
I did well. I did the right thing.

43
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,682
What if I made...

44
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,020
No.

45
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:15,398
I did the right thing.

46
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,329
Where should I head to?

47
00:06:58,292 --> 00:06:59,293
Who is it?

48
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:01,420
Who is it?

49
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:10,221
What's this?

50
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,014
What are you doing here?

51
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:16,436
Can I sleep over at your house?

52
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:19,439
Hey.

53
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,152
Hey, what are you doing?

54
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:26,070
How did you know where I live?

55
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:29,240
It's not difficult to find out
someone's home address.

56
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:31,951
Gosh, I did hear that you recently moved.

57
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,078
Your place is great.

58
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:40,460
Let me stay here for a couple of days.

59
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:42,503
What are you saying?

60
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,213
What's your problem?

61
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:46,340
This is breaking and entering.

62
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:48,050
I know that.

63
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:50,261
But because of a personal issue,

64
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:52,430
I don't really have a place to stay.

65
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:57,185
There's only one room at my mom's place.

66
00:07:57,518 --> 00:07:59,103
And I've already moved out,

67
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,230
so I can't exactly move back
into her house.

68
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:02,982
I'm too old to do that, don't you think?

69
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:04,066
Yes, you're right.

70
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:06,152
-No. But--
-See?

71
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:08,362
But why do you have to stay at my place?

72
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:12,450
Hey, this is all I need.

73
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:13,784
You can sleep in your own bed.

74
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:16,954
Listen to me. The bed was mine
to begin with,

75
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:18,414
and this sofa's mine too.

76
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:23,002
My gosh, this is nice.

77
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:24,170
Hey.

78
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,256
You hate me, don't you?

79
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,966
Yes, I hate you a lot.

80
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,385
The same goes for me. I really hate you.

81
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:32,345
Yes, I know that.

82
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:34,263
But why do you want to stay at my house?

83
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,349
Go and stay with someone you like.

84
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:43,814
If I go to someone I like and ask them
if I can crash at their place,

85
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:45,399
that would be very ill-mannered.

86
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:47,527
I'm glad you know.
It's totally ill-mannered.

87
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,988
Then why do you think I chose
to stay at your place when I hate you?

88
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:52,073
What?

89
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,579
Hey, are you trying to get back at me?

90
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:00,706
It's my revenge and punishment.

91
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:02,667
You owe me a lot.

92
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,502
-Hey--
-Shall I list

93
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:06,128
all the evil things you did to me?

94
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:08,965
No.

95
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:21,644
But you're really useful.

96
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:25,982
I was very miserable...

97
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:28,109
and distressed.

98
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:33,239
After I hurt him...

99
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:36,242
I was wondering all day...

100
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:39,453
if I had done the right thing or not.

101
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:43,165
I couldn't tell if I was sane or crazy.

102
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,670
I just really...

103
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:51,048
wanted to die.

104
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:55,928
But after seeing you,

105
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:58,180
I really want to start living again.

106
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,517
It's sort of like a will to fight.

107
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:04,979
When someone like you is still living,
so should I.

108
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:07,231
-Hey!
-Don't yell at me.

109
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:11,777
I'm really sad right now.

110
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:23,831
This is crazy.

111
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:27,144
Let's...

112
00:11:28,687 --> 00:11:31,148
never break up, Bong-hui.

113
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:35,611
Even if I tell you to leave me...

114
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:37,905
don't leave.

115
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:33,752
Hey.

116
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:35,463
My gosh, you startled me.

117
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:39,425
Can you put your hand on top
of my forehead and see if I have a fever?

118
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:41,844
You see, I rarely

119
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:44,305
get sick.

120
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:47,433
But I think I have a fever.

121
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,101
Hang on.

122
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:56,150
Here.

123
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:02,323
By the way, Prosecutor Na.

124
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,241
Do you have a car?

125
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:05,951
Why?

126
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:07,786
Don't you need a personal driver?

127
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:10,998
I'm an expert at parking.
I drive really well.

128
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:12,166
I don't need a driver.

129
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:17,838
Hey, it says my temperature
is 37 degrees Celsius. Is this normal?

130
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:21,425
You're making such a big fuss.
That's pretty normal.

131
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:23,302
It's only a mild fever.

132
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:24,720
Really?

133
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:26,430
Are you sure?

134
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:29,016
I don't think so.

135
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:35,564
LAWYER NOH JI-UK

136
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:38,901
The meeting is rescheduled to 10:30 a.m.

137
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:40,903
He wants me to attend the meeting.

138
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:42,363
So?

139
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:44,406
He's telling me to come to work

140
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,367
after all that fuss.

141
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:47,826
That's good news.

142
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,745
It makes no sense.

143
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:54,124
How can I go to work like this?

144
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,881
You're really bold

145
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:02,758
for someone who has nothing.

146
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,386
-What?
-Don't you get it?

147
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:09,014
Do you think you'll be able to get a job
at any other place

148
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:11,559
than that weird, crazy law firm?

149
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:12,643
In your dreams.

150
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:16,438
Just swallow your pride and go to work.

151
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:20,484
I don't care about your love life
nor am I interested,

152
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:22,862
but you'll need money to date anyone
in the first place.

153
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:25,698
Are you going to continue living your life

154
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:27,449
by relying on other people?

155
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:32,538
You're like a crazy bedbug. My gosh.

156
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,039
See you.

157
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,001
My gosh.

158
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:01,418
Follow me.

159
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:11,929
Did everyone else go somewhere?

160
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:21,438
Yes.

161
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,786
I came to give you this.

162
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:36,912
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

163
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:44,545
To be honest, I was so torn...

164
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:49,967
about whether I should submit it or not.

165
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:51,927
But...

166
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:53,679
But?

167
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:57,057
This is the conclusion I've arrived at.

168
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,102
I apologize.

169
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:02,563
And thank you for everything.

170
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:05,399
Agonizing over it
was a total waste of your time.

171
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,154
This is your contract. It clearly states

172
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:12,406
that your contract term is two years.

173
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:14,867
If you want to leave, you can do so
after your contract expires.

174
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:17,536
-But--
-I thought you'd at least

175
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:21,123
separate your personal life from work.
Was I expecting too much?

176
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:22,249
Mr. Noh.

177
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,878
Let's talk only about work today.

178
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:28,756
I'm not ready to talk
about what happened between us.

179
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:39,016
Ms. Eun, do you think this job
is like a joke?

180
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:41,769
No, not at all. But the situation is--

181
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:44,980
I told you to draw the line
between work and personal life.

182
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:47,024
Don't...

183
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,943
give up work so easily.

184
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,740
Your desk over there.

185
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:56,909
Don't think it's easy to get that spot.

186
00:17:57,659 --> 00:18:00,496
Don't betray those whom you trust,

187
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:02,164
and those who have trusted you.

188
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:04,124
Work-wise...

189
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,211
I'm really sorry.

190
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:13,050
But it's not easy to go on with work
as if nothing happened...

191
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:15,719
in a situation like this.

192
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:21,225
It won't be easy for you either.

193
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:24,686
Every time you see me,
you'll think about your father.

194
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:27,773
And you'll feel guilty toward him and me.

195
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:31,068
It'll cause you pain.

196
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:36,323
-So?
-So...

197
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:40,786
I'm telling you that is the reason
I'm quitting.

198
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:43,288
No, you're overstepping your boundaries.

199
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:47,084
That's my problem, and I'll figure out
what to do. So you should...

200
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,461
only worry...

201
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:51,588
about your problem.

202
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:57,511
All right, let's do this.
I'll let you go on vacation.

203
00:18:58,595 --> 00:19:01,306
Try to think rationally
while you're taking some time off.

204
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:02,641
I'll do some thinking too.

205
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:07,271
That's the best compromise I can make.

206
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:10,357
What's your answer?

207
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:14,403
Yes, sir.

208
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:16,572
Good.

209
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:18,365
Get going, then.

210
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,721
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

211
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:52,816
SEONHO DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

212
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:04,745
I came to see you
because I want to know something...

213
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:07,748
about the arson case
that killed my parents.

214
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:12,628
I saw that you were the prosecutor
in charge of the case.

215
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:15,172
Yes, I was.

216
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:21,803
I wanted to figure it out on my own,
but it happened a long time ago.

217
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:25,140
And most of the records
have been lost as well,

218
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:28,268
so I thought I should come
and see you in person.

219
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,188
What is it that you want to ask me?

220
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:34,733
I'll be straightforward with you.

221
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:38,070
Why were my parents...

222
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:42,241
murdered?

223
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:44,534
I thought you'd know that much.

224
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:49,122
It was a revenge murder to retaliate
for getting prosecuted.

225
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:52,125
Right, but I really don't understand
that part.

226
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:54,753
At the time, the suspect, Eun Man-su,

227
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:57,923
was only involved in a small assault case.

228
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,884
Logically, I cannot understand
why he had to get back

229
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:03,929
at the prosecutor for being charged.

230
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,099
How would I know the reason?

231
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:12,229
What I know is the fact that he kept
complaining to the prosecution.

232
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:17,109
Then one day, he was found
as a dead body at the arson scene.

233
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,156
If that was the case...

234
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:27,911
how could you conclude
that he was the culprit?

235
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:31,206
Were there any additional clues
or pieces of evidence?

236
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,291
It was because of you.

237
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:36,378
Pardon me?

238
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:38,839
Can you recognize him?

239
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:45,721
This man is the one who...

240
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,683
killed your mom and dad. Okay?

241
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,772
You pegged him as the culprit.

242
00:21:57,482 --> 00:22:00,902
You said it yourself
that he started the fire

243
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:04,614
and that he killed your parents.

244
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,416
I...

245
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:18,670
I said that?

246
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:21,006
Has your curiosity been answered?

247
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:50,368
It was because of you.

248
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:54,164
You pegged him as the culprit.

249
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:57,876
What on earth...

250
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:00,587
did I see?

251
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:47,050
Gosh, you scared me.

252
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,263
Hey!

253
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:25,547
Shall I watch it just once?

254
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,773
Why isn't it working?

255
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:46,443
Bong-hui, you're taking a video right now.

256
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:48,445
Oh, really?

257
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:52,616
Look at that face. That was funny.

258
00:24:58,997 --> 00:24:59,998
Why isn't it working?

259
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:02,959
Bong-hui, you're taking a video right now.

260
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,712
-Oh, really?
-Yes.

261
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:10,717
Just once more.

262
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:19,017
Bong-hui, you're taking a video right now.

263
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:21,853
-Oh, really?
-Yes.

264
00:25:44,542 --> 00:25:47,712
Where are we with the divorce suit
of Kim Yeong-eun?

265
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:50,257
Well, we can't seem
to come to an agreement.

266
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,635
This week, we are going to ask
for a settlement and property division.

267
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:55,262
-Next--
-Did you two...

268
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:58,390
fight?

269
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:02,852
Did you guys break up?

270
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:07,232
Gosh, I'm not sure
if he can ever take a hint or not.

271
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:08,525
He probably can't.

272
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:12,237
I mean...

273
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:15,115
It's not likely...

274
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:17,575
that Ms. Lack of Evidence would
go on vacation by herself.

275
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:20,578
-Aren't I right?
-You are right.

276
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:22,914
So I'd like you to go on vacation too.

277
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:24,666
Please use your vacation days.

278
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:27,002
It'd be better if you're gone
for a long time.

279
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:28,128
What do you think?

280
00:26:29,879 --> 00:26:31,214
I'll stop talking.

281
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:32,799
I have no place to go.

282
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:42,726
We should use repeated assaults
in terms of the labor law.

283
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:45,228
That's right. I agree too.

284
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:47,814
What about Jung Hyeon-su?

285
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:49,274
Is he getting better?

286
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:51,276
I visited him yesterday,
but there's nothing new.

287
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:52,736
The doctor didn't say much either.

288
00:26:53,653 --> 00:26:56,114
-I see.
-You are not going to...

289
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,533
make up with Ms. Lack of Evidence?

290
00:27:01,077 --> 00:27:02,829
How pathetic.

291
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:05,749
I raised you wrong.

292
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:20,930
I'll make sure he uses his vacation days.

293
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:22,599
Please.

294
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:24,100
For his long leave of absence.

295
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:43,953
It's 37 degrees Celsius.

296
00:27:47,123 --> 00:27:49,417
This falls in the normal range.

297
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,844
Hey, Bong-hui.

298
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:02,972
Are you going to sleep all day long?

299
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:05,350
Wake up. Or I'll kick you out.

300
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:08,186
Hey.

301
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,063
Hey, wacko.

302
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:13,233
Hey.

303
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:17,487
What?

304
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:25,537
What's happening?

305
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:31,459
Was this broken?

306
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:32,836
Hey, Bong-hui.

307
00:28:33,336 --> 00:28:35,171
Hey, wake up.

308
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:36,923
Hey.

309
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,216
Hey.

310
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:40,260
Bong-hui.

311
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:45,849
Prosecutor Na.

312
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:47,434
Hey.

313
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:49,018
How's Ms. Eun?

314
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:52,689
Over there. Her temperature
hiked up as high as 40 degrees Celsius.

315
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,075
Bong-hui.

316
00:29:56,419 --> 00:30:00,882
I wish this wasn't a dream.

317
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:04,469
No, it's not a dream.

318
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:52,141
Does it not suit your taste?

319
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:54,352
Well...

320
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:56,688
It's not bad, but...

321
00:30:57,272 --> 00:31:00,942
The owner of this restaurant
is known to be a great cook.

322
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:04,320
Everyone has a different taste, you know.

323
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:06,990
For goodness' sake.

324
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:10,618
How can your son be nothing like you?

325
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:12,120
What are you talking about?

326
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:15,790
When he was a kid, people used to tell me
that he and I look exactly the same.

327
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:19,669
Whenever I went out with him,
more than a dozen people said that to me.

328
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:21,921
Please, only speak the truth.

329
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:24,048
From his looks to his personality,

330
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:27,927
I don't know how you can have
a son like him.

331
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:30,430
Gosh, did you find him
on the streets somewhere or what?

332
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:37,145
No, I didn't.

333
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:39,981
I'm not his birth mom,
but I raised him with my heart.

334
00:31:41,357 --> 00:31:42,358
Are we good now?

335
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:50,742
I'm really sorry. I was just kidding.

336
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,494
My mouth got the best of me.

337
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:56,289
I sincerely apologize.

338
00:31:57,999 --> 00:32:00,043
Gosh, I wish you didn't apologize.

339
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:01,711
I can't even get mad at you now.

340
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:10,011
Whether you're his birth mother or not,

341
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:11,971
it doesn't change anything.

342
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:16,809
Every mother cherishes her child equally.

343
00:32:18,561 --> 00:32:20,021
Of course.

344
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:24,859
Do you drink soju?

345
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:27,946
I usually drink wine.

346
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:33,952
I'm trying my best
to become friends with her,

347
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:36,245
but we're so different.

348
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:39,457
I know, right?

349
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:43,211
But I do feel bad for her
at the same time.

350
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:45,171
She's actually tender-hearted.

351
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:49,133
As your future mother-in-law, she's...

352
00:32:49,842 --> 00:32:50,969
not too bad.

353
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:52,220
Goodness.

354
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:54,764
Mom, what are you talking about?

355
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:56,557
Don't you worry.

356
00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:59,936
I'll be sure to train her,
so you should...

357
00:33:00,853 --> 00:33:03,606
just keep your grip on Mr. Noh.

358
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:09,278
Mom, the thing is...

359
00:33:10,446 --> 00:33:11,531
Actually...

360
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:13,491
What is it?

361
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:19,497
Just a second.

362
00:33:23,626 --> 00:33:24,544
Hello?

363
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:27,714
Sorry? A police station?

364
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,555
She's my lawyer.

365
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:37,849
Me?

366
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:40,852
Hello.

367
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:49,318
He said his taekwondo instructor
was a lawyer. It was true.

368
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:51,320
Yes.

369
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:53,364
So to summarize it,

370
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:58,202
he witnessed a murder incident,
and he is the only witness, right?

371
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:01,914
Show her the CCTV footage.

372
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:03,082
Yes, sir.

373
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:13,259
I'll have a look.

374
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:36,491
You saw the murderer's whole face,
didn't you?

375
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:39,619
But why won't you tell us?

376
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:44,457
It's all right. You can tell them.

377
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:46,042
He said he's pleading the Fifth.

378
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:49,087
Hey, you. Stop watching TV.

379
00:34:49,545 --> 00:34:53,216
It's not that.
I really don't remember his face.

380
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:02,183
Ms. Eun.

381
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:04,018
Ms. Eun!

382
00:35:05,978 --> 00:35:07,688
Hey, you!

383
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,817
You, Ms. Lack of Evidence.

384
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:13,736
Who told you that you can take
a leave of absence?

385
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:17,198
I'm sorry.

386
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:21,702
But who is the kid?

387
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:25,748
Is he a kid?

388
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,750
Come on. Everyone can see he's a kid.

389
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:29,418
Whose kid is he?

390
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:31,129
Who are you?

391
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:32,880
Well, he is...

392
00:35:34,006 --> 00:35:35,007
Mom.

393
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:37,009
Mom?

394
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:45,685
My dad passed away.

395
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:49,981
I live with an ugly aunt and uncle.

396
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:53,484
I'm a poor kid just like Harry Potter.

397
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:55,403
Why don't you tell them your name first?

398
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:57,530
My name is Kim Jae-hong.

399
00:35:57,613 --> 00:35:58,948
Hi, Jae-hong.

400
00:35:59,448 --> 00:36:00,950
She's my lawyer.

401
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:07,248
Well, that's... It sort of just happened.

402
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:23,848
He witnessed a murder?

403
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:35,795
This is what happened.

404
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:44,512
How dare you lie to us?
You're too young for that.

405
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:48,432
I don't like that old man.

406
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:53,854
I get what you mean.

407
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:59,902
Hey, you. Take your leave
of absence again. Go!

408
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:02,613
Mr. Byeon, you should be the one
taking the leave of absence.

409
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:37,481
Jae-hong asked if there were snacks,

410
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:39,775
ice cream, or anything to eat.

411
00:38:43,195 --> 00:38:44,530
He's just like someone I know.

412
00:38:47,616 --> 00:38:49,035
It's been a while, right?

413
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:54,498
Has it been a while?

414
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:57,418
Have you been well?

415
00:38:58,711 --> 00:38:59,545
Yes.

416
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:03,632
Are you really all right?

417
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:06,552
Of course.

418
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:11,015
It was nothing to me.
You know how healthy I am.

419
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:26,197
Right.

420
00:39:29,116 --> 00:39:30,034
Thank you.

421
00:39:45,674 --> 00:39:47,259
I see. Yes.

422
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:50,096
Then we will take care of him for a while.

423
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:54,016
No, we will visit you.

424
00:39:55,851 --> 00:39:57,395
Okay. Bye.

425
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:07,488
I told you so.
My aunt doesn't care about me.

426
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:13,744
Then he can stay with me
until we take care of his--

427
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:16,705
Oh, right.

428
00:40:21,043 --> 00:40:23,087
You should just stay at your aunt's house.

429
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:28,092
I'm crashing at someone's house
so I can't take you. Sorry.

430
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:31,220
What about Mr. Byeon or Mr. Ji?

431
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:32,930
Mr. Byeon went to golf,
Mr. Ji has a trial.

432
00:40:33,013 --> 00:40:34,098
Gosh.

433
00:40:35,307 --> 00:40:39,145
I can't leave this little kid alone
since he's a witness.

434
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:40,563
I am not little.

435
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:43,941
Whom are you trying to fool?
Just have your snacks.

436
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:47,153
What should we do?

437
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,323
Let's do this.

438
00:40:52,074 --> 00:40:54,660
Let's send him
to either Mr. Byeon or Mr. Ji's house.

439
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:56,662
He's too little to...

440
00:40:59,915 --> 00:41:00,916
Leave already.

441
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:02,585
Go.

442
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:20,895
Hey.

443
00:41:22,104 --> 00:41:23,105
Listen carefully.

444
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:28,319
We are on the first floor, and the floor
above here is the second floor.

445
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:30,488
You can't ever set foot
on the second floor.

446
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:33,657
Don't come upstairs or talk to me.

447
00:41:33,782 --> 00:41:36,243
Don't ask me to do things for you
or walk around on your own.

448
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:39,246
Just don't do anything.
You should just think hard

449
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:41,123
and be by yourself.

450
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:45,127
Make your statement
and leave as fast as you can.

451
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:46,670
Okay?

452
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:54,887
Aren't you grateful
that I'm giving you a ride?

453
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:00,768
I'm grateful, and I like it.

454
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:06,649
Look at you. You look great
now that you're smiling and not sick.

455
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:10,653
I rarely get sick though.

456
00:42:11,153 --> 00:42:13,489
Yet your temperature was
as high as 40 degrees Celsius?

457
00:42:14,281 --> 00:42:16,242
Oh, no. You are right.

458
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:19,620
How did you know that?

459
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:21,872
I was at the hospital.

460
00:42:22,289 --> 00:42:25,042
Wait. I don't remember seeing you.

461
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:28,337
I guess you don't remember
as your temperature soared.

462
00:42:29,004 --> 00:42:31,090
I see. You came to the hospital.

463
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:34,176
Hold on.

464
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:37,346
Did he...

465
00:42:38,472 --> 00:42:39,848
Yes, I went there with Ji-uk.

466
00:42:40,349 --> 00:42:41,642
No way.

467
00:42:42,851 --> 00:42:44,395
No. What?

468
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:45,604
What is it?

469
00:42:46,313 --> 00:42:47,189
Unbelievable.

470
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:48,774
What's unbelievable?

471
00:42:50,776 --> 00:42:54,363
I had a dream.

472
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:58,033
Wait a second. It was a dream.

473
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:01,453
This has to be a dream.

474
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:16,677
Oh, no! That wasn't a dream.

475
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:19,513
Ms. Eun, what's wrong? What is it?

476
00:43:19,638 --> 00:43:21,098
After that...

477
00:43:23,058 --> 00:43:24,602
It's been a while, right?

478
00:43:26,812 --> 00:43:28,230
Has it been a while?

479
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:31,191
Have you been well?

480
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:33,027
Gosh. This is just unbelievable.

481
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:35,904
What? What is so unbelievable?
I'm really curious.

482
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:40,117
After I dumped him, I did that to him.

483
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:43,329
I even had the nerve to tell him
that it's been a while.

484
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:45,205
No.

485
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:49,543
I should just die. I should.

486
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:52,421
Ms. Eun!

487
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:56,800
I'm sorry.

488
00:43:56,884 --> 00:44:01,096
If you are truly sorry, stop it.
We might end up in an accident.

489
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:03,474
Okay.

490
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:49,561
Hey!

491
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:52,689
Didn't I tell you not to come upstairs?

492
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:54,400
Go back down.

493
00:44:57,903 --> 00:44:59,863
What? What are you doing?
Don't come near me.

494
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:02,616
Hey, back off. Go away.

495
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:06,120
What?

496
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:20,300
Hey.

497
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:23,971
What did you see? Tell me.

498
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:30,144
What was so scary that made you

499
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:32,354
come upstairs and into my room?

500
00:45:33,647 --> 00:45:34,690
It's because

501
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:36,733
I had a nightmare.

502
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:44,074
You're just a little kid.
You shouldn't be having...

503
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:46,535
nightmares already.

504
00:45:52,207 --> 00:45:54,334
If I don't testify,

505
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:57,754
will it be impossible
to catch the culprit?

506
00:45:59,214 --> 00:46:02,176
And if the culprit doesn't get caught
because I don't testify...

507
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:06,638
will that be my fault?

508
00:46:09,725 --> 00:46:10,934
It's all your fault.

509
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:17,483
You need to testify in order for us
to find the culprit.

510
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:19,902
If the culprit doesn't get caught,

511
00:46:20,402 --> 00:46:21,570
it's all your fault.

512
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:30,412
You just need to tell me what you saw.

513
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:33,790
You already know what you saw.

514
00:46:34,416 --> 00:46:35,459
Right?

515
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:40,130
Sir?

516
00:46:41,882 --> 00:46:42,758
Yes.

517
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:51,391
No.

518
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:54,478
You don't need to testify.

519
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:57,814
Just do what you want.

520
00:46:58,273 --> 00:46:59,942
Whether you testify or not,

521
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:01,985
nothing will ever be your fault.

522
00:47:02,402 --> 00:47:03,403
Okay?

523
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:18,418
Hey, Detective Park.

524
00:47:20,754 --> 00:47:22,631
Jae-hong says he can't remember anything,

525
00:47:22,714 --> 00:47:25,050
so there's nothing much I can do.

526
00:47:27,636 --> 00:47:30,097
Okay. I'll try talking to him.

527
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:32,182
But don't get your hopes up.

528
00:47:32,933 --> 00:47:35,519
Okay, bye.

529
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:47,114
I told him to wait
in front of the school gate.

530
00:47:59,084 --> 00:48:01,670
Hey, guys. Are you guys in first grade?

531
00:48:01,753 --> 00:48:04,214
Are you in the same class as Jae-hong
in class number three?

532
00:48:04,464 --> 00:48:06,133
-No, we don't know him.
-We don't know him.

533
00:48:07,092 --> 00:48:08,135
Okay, thanks.

534
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:14,558
Where is he?

535
00:48:37,372 --> 00:48:38,373
What's wrong?

536
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:40,334
Is someone chasing after you?

537
00:48:41,376 --> 00:48:42,461
Hey, Jae-hong!

538
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:48,133
I told you to wait for me
at the school gate. Where were you?

539
00:48:48,216 --> 00:48:50,469
Come here. Did you get hurt?

540
00:48:54,973 --> 00:48:55,974
Hello.

541
00:48:56,058 --> 00:48:56,933
Hello.

542
00:48:57,017 --> 00:48:59,645
I just talked to Detective Park just now.

543
00:49:00,687 --> 00:49:02,189
Detective Park can be quite stubborn.

544
00:49:02,272 --> 00:49:04,441
Yes. Jae-hong can't remember anything,

545
00:49:04,566 --> 00:49:07,194
but he keeps forcing things,
which made me feel uneasy.

546
00:49:09,655 --> 00:49:10,656
It's okay.

547
00:49:11,156 --> 00:49:12,908
You don't need to testify
if it's too pressuring.

548
00:49:13,575 --> 00:49:14,451
You know that, right?

549
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:16,953
I can't testify anyway
because I don't remember anything.

550
00:49:22,959 --> 00:49:23,960
Are you okay?

551
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:09,589
By any chance...

552
00:50:11,049 --> 00:50:12,843
are you

553
00:50:12,968 --> 00:50:14,428
and Ms. Eun...

554
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:21,560
Hey.

555
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:23,395
Don't laugh.

556
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:27,441
I said, don't laugh.

557
00:50:28,775 --> 00:50:31,319
You little... Hey, what do you know?

558
00:50:31,403 --> 00:50:32,612
Stop laughing.

559
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:33,864
Don't laugh.

560
00:50:35,907 --> 00:50:37,033
I'm not kidding.

561
00:50:37,617 --> 00:50:38,660
Don't laugh.

562
00:50:38,952 --> 00:50:40,537
Are you going to keep laughing?

563
00:50:54,843 --> 00:50:55,719
Why?

564
00:50:56,178 --> 00:50:58,054
Did you have a nightmare again?

565
00:51:03,685 --> 00:51:05,687
My gosh, it's okay.

566
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:07,147
It's okay.

567
00:51:09,608 --> 00:51:10,776
It hurts.

568
00:51:12,986 --> 00:51:13,987
Okay.

569
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:22,287
What if...

570
00:51:23,288 --> 00:51:24,331
the culprit...

571
00:51:24,831 --> 00:51:26,750
comes to kill me?

572
00:51:27,834 --> 00:51:28,835
No, it won't happen.

573
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:31,588
That will never happen.

574
00:51:33,089 --> 00:51:34,216
I don't know.

575
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:37,928
I don't know who the culprit is.

576
00:51:39,679 --> 00:51:41,056
I don't know if I should testify

577
00:51:41,598 --> 00:51:42,891
or not.

578
00:51:47,813 --> 00:51:48,897
I'll make sure

579
00:51:49,481 --> 00:51:52,776
you're safe regardless
of whatever choice you make.

580
00:51:55,570 --> 00:51:58,281
But there's one thing you need to know.

581
00:51:59,908 --> 00:52:02,494
If you just put a seal
on this problem without solving it,

582
00:52:02,702 --> 00:52:04,246
these nightmares might...

583
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:06,206
continue to haunt you...

584
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:09,918
even when you grow old
and become an adult.

585
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:30,897
I'm going to testify.

586
00:52:51,877 --> 00:52:52,878
Hello.

587
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:55,547
Hey, did you remember anything?

588
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:56,882
Are you here to testify?

589
00:52:57,173 --> 00:52:59,259
Yes, apparently. What a good boy.

590
00:53:00,552 --> 00:53:01,887
What a rude boy.

591
00:53:07,767 --> 00:53:09,686
At the supermarket...

592
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:17,944
Jae-hong, you're here to testify.
You can tell us what you saw.

593
00:53:19,821 --> 00:53:20,989
It's okay.

594
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:30,832
It was him.

595
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:46,306
Me?

596
00:54:11,539 --> 00:54:12,958
Why are you doing this to me?

597
00:54:13,875 --> 00:54:16,419
Everyone knows my ringtone.
Stop joking around.

598
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:19,881
Those shoes.

599
00:54:28,556 --> 00:54:31,184
There was blood on them.

600
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:55,667
I said, I didn't do it.
Why don't you believe me?

601
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:57,544
Hey, why are you doing this to me?

602
00:54:57,627 --> 00:55:00,088
Let go. Gosh, I really didn't do it.

603
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:05,969
Now, we just have to organize
your affidavit.

604
00:55:06,761 --> 00:55:08,013
You did well.

605
00:55:09,764 --> 00:55:11,224
I'm not sure.

606
00:55:12,267 --> 00:55:14,811
I don't remember who it was.

607
00:55:15,437 --> 00:55:17,480
I don't know.

608
00:55:20,442 --> 00:55:21,985
It was that man.

609
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:24,904
He's the culprit.

610
00:55:27,699 --> 00:55:28,575
What are...

611
00:55:29,451 --> 00:55:31,911
these two contrasting memories
that popped into my head?

612
00:55:33,329 --> 00:55:34,330
Which one...

613
00:55:35,331 --> 00:55:36,875
is the truth?

614
00:55:53,141 --> 00:55:55,935
Well, Mr. Bang.
Something urgent has come up.

615
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:57,812
Please take care of the rest for me.

616
00:55:57,896 --> 00:55:58,980
Sure, no problem.

617
00:56:02,233 --> 00:56:05,820
Sorry. Don't be scared.
Mr. Bang is here with you.

618
00:56:05,904 --> 00:56:07,447
Don't worry, okay?

619
00:56:07,947 --> 00:56:09,824
-Please take good care of him.
-Okay.

620
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:18,208
Can you recognize him?

621
00:56:19,834 --> 00:56:22,462
This man is the one

622
00:56:22,962 --> 00:56:24,547
who killed your mom and dad.

623
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:26,466
Okay?

624
00:56:27,342 --> 00:56:30,553
This man is the one
who killed your mom and dad.

625
00:56:30,637 --> 00:56:32,889
This man is the one
who killed your mom and dad.

626
00:56:32,972 --> 00:56:34,474
He killed your mom.

627
00:56:36,851 --> 00:56:39,354
I don't remember who it was.

628
00:56:39,938 --> 00:56:41,981
I don't know.

629
00:57:58,099 --> 00:57:59,184
Yes, Mr. Bang.

630
00:58:01,102 --> 00:58:03,104
Yes, he's still the same.

631
00:58:03,813 --> 00:58:05,398
The doctor said there's been
no improvement.

632
00:58:06,274 --> 00:58:07,150
Right.

633
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:10,403
Yes, okay.

634
00:58:11,446 --> 00:58:12,405
All right.

635
00:59:13,341 --> 00:59:15,468
