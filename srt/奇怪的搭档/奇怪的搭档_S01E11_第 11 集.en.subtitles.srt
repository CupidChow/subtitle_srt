1
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:46,379
Wait, it's Ji-uk.

2
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:48,840
Hey, Ji-uk, I didn't know
you were going for a run today.

3
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:53,553
You should've told me.
I would've joined you.

4
00:00:53,636 --> 00:00:56,014
It's been ages since I jogged with you.
It's nice, isn't it?

5
00:00:57,849 --> 00:01:01,311
But I actually ran a lot today.

6
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:03,313
Let's slow down a bit.

7
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:06,733
Ji-uk? Let's slow down a bit.

8
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:10,403
Hey, go away. Get lost.

9
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:23,541
The day is...

10
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:26,252
already approaching again.

11
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:38,389
Hey, let me join you.

12
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,434
Get lost.

13
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:43,770
-I don't want to.
-Just get lost.

14
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:45,980
No, I don't want to.
I'm going to run with you forever.

15
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:47,315
Get lost forever.

16
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:49,234
Let me be with you.

17
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:50,693
Let go of me.

18
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:53,446
Come on. Give me a piggyback ride.

19
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:56,199
Seriously. Just get lost.

20
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:58,076
Why are you so fast?

21
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:12,632
VISITING DAD

22
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:28,022
Why did you follow me here?

23
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:30,942
I want to have a meal you cook.
It's delicious.

24
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,283
What's that look on your face?
Why are you smiling like that?

25
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:42,203
Two men came home sweating
after their workout.

26
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,414
This sure is a fantasy of all women.

27
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,374
-This is nice.
-It's nice, isn't it?

28
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:50,461
Why is it nice? You just need one man.
Got it?

29
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:52,005
Two is better than one.

30
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:55,675
-Hey, you need to get out. Go.
-Why? Hold on.

31
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:57,135
Should I go?

32
00:02:57,218 --> 00:02:59,137
No, why should you?
Let's have breakfast together.

33
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,931
Hey, this is my house, and that's my food.

34
00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:08,646
Hey, Bong-hui, come here.

35
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,356
Come and help me. Stop smiling at him.

36
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,817
Hold on. Do you think I can be of help?

37
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:16,112
Well... Watch me cook.

38
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:17,322
Okay.

39
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:20,074
Me too. I'll watch you too.

40
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,718
About digging up Jung Hyeon-su's past,

41
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:41,554
I think it'd be best to put it
on the back burner for now.

42
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:42,680
Why?

43
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:43,890
He...

44
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:46,226
found out.

45
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:49,604
Why do you continue to keep an eye
on me and doubt me?

46
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:53,149
What did I do wrong? What did I do?

47
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:58,446
I really like you guys,
but why do you keep doing this to me?

48
00:03:58,696 --> 00:04:01,574
I didn't know he'd find out
this soon. I'm sorry.

49
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:06,454
Don't be. He was bound to find out
if he set his mind to it.

50
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:08,164
It's just that...

51
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,377
I have a bad feeling about this.

52
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,338
Let's stop officially digging up his past.

53
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:18,758
Did you hear me?

54
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:23,096
Yes, I did.

55
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:43,426
That jerk. If that jerk
didn't do what he did...

56
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:44,761
THE LATE NOH YEONG-SEOK

57
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,805
You could have watched your son

58
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,974
growing up into such a fine man...

59
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:53,019
all you want.

60
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,804
Honey. My sweetie.

61
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,180
THE LATE EUN MAN-SU

62
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:31,057
Don't you worry about us.

63
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:33,643
We are doing just fine.

64
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:37,355
That's right, Dad. We are fine.

65
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:43,694
Your daughter is such a cool lawyer.

66
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:45,363
EUN BONG-HUI

67
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:47,115
A lawyer who represents...

68
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,951
wrongfully charged defendants.

69
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:56,415
I'm not a cool lawyer yet,
but I'm planning to become one.

70
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:15,560
Wait. Is she...

71
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,146
-What is it?
-What?

72
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,106
It's nothing.

73
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:22,733
I must be seeing things again.

74
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:25,486
Goodness, I can't believe you're
doing that even here.

75
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:28,531
What did I do, Bok-ja?

76
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:32,243
Come on.

77
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:35,037
-Thanks to you, I'm never bored.
-What?

78
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:39,834
I'll be waiting for you.
Be careful when you come.

79
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:47,633
Enjoy your drink.

80
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:53,139
Don't do that.

81
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:54,807
Who are you?

82
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:56,976
Don't do what you are planning to do.

83
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:58,978
Get out of my way.

84
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:02,648
You jerk.

85
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:07,528
Get up. Have you gone mad?

86
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:13,618
Article 260 of Criminal Law,
first-degree assault.

87
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:18,289
Article 266 of Criminal Law,
personal injury due to negligence.

88
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:21,250
Shoot.

89
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:23,294
Okay.

90
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:28,174
Article 366 of Criminal Law,

91
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,468
damage of property charge.

92
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:34,096
Stop it!

93
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,181
What?

94
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:40,520
Lastly, since you fought in a café,

95
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:43,439
Article 314 of Criminal Law,
obstruction of business is applied.

96
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:45,066
I guess it has come to that.

97
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:49,529
Besides, you are on probation
for the same charges.

98
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:51,948
Yes, I am. It sort of happened that way.

99
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:54,700
When the assault is mutual,
you won't be charged

100
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:56,619
as long as you can settle
with the other party,

101
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:58,913
but you weren't able to settle it.

102
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:01,082
No, I couldn't.

103
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,001
You started the dispute, right?

104
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:06,337
Yes, that sort of happened that way.

105
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,673
Why did it happen that way? Why?

106
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:12,093
Why, Mr. So Jeong-ha? Why do you
keep letting things happen this way?

107
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:13,761
Let me ask you why you let this happen.

108
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:16,681
Mr. Noh, you are a lawyer.

109
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:18,099
You are not a prosecutor.

110
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:19,559
I know that I'm...

111
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,822
I can't work like this.
This is so uncomfortable.

112
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:39,287
All right.
What I'm trying to tell you is...

113
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:43,332
that I need understandable reasons
for me to settle this case

114
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:46,377
and plead for mercy in court.

115
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:50,047
You all know this, don't you?
I'm asking you to tell us

116
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:51,716
why you did this.

117
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,510
I can see what's ahead of me.

118
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:57,471
Yes, we all can see what is
ahead of us as well.

119
00:09:57,555 --> 00:10:01,892
I can see what's going to happen
in the future.

120
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:05,062
It's pizza.

121
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:07,732
Excuse me? Pizza?

122
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:09,859
Guys!

123
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,613
Let's have some pizza!

124
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:20,703
What?

125
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,003
To sum up, this is what he said.

126
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,715
He can sometimes foresee
what will happen in the future.

127
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,091
That's what happened that day.

128
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:46,604
The guy who came in
was going to stab the part-timer.

129
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:51,150
We must be getting crazy clients

130
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:55,529
because the lawyers working here
are crazy too.

131
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:02,078
He mentioned that the man
was about to stab the part-timer.

132
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:03,704
But that's just our client's opinion.

133
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:06,957
We checked the CCTV at the café
and asked the witnesses who were there.

134
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:09,543
There was no evidence to prove
the other man was carrying a weapon.

135
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:11,170
He's right. He had nothing in his hands.

136
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:13,464
But So Jeong-ha suddenly blocked his way,

137
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:14,882
and that's when the fight started.

138
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:18,469
Maybe he's lying or has a mental disease.

139
00:11:18,677 --> 00:11:19,804
Maybe he's delusional.

140
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:21,347
He could be those people

141
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,808
who think they're aliens
or have supernatural powers.

142
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:25,476
He did foresee this pizza.

143
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:27,770
He could've smelled it before we did.

144
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:29,021
I'm going to drop this case.

145
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:30,106
No, you can't.

146
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:33,734
We must take every single client
that comes to us.

147
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:35,694
Of course, you must.

148
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,697
I pay your monthly salary and cost
of maintenance for this office.

149
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:41,575
Do you know how much money
I spend every month because of that?

150
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:42,743
Especially

151
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:44,537
you two.

152
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,042
Our meeting ends here.

153
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:51,460
Thank you for the pizza.

154
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:53,212
Good work, everyone.

155
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:54,296
Wait!

156
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:05,015
This is the same evidence that
the prosecution has.

157
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:08,227
It is. That's because I sent them
the CCTV footage.

158
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:09,603
There really was no knife.

159
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:10,813
There was.

160
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:13,065
There was?

161
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:15,693
A knife? Where?

162
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:17,820
There's no knife.

163
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:20,489
Well, it was inside his jacket.

164
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:23,826
We searched him after arresting him.
That's when we found it.

165
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,332
I'm sure he had a knife.

166
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,461
If I didn't stop him,
he would've taken it out.

167
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,424
The opponent really had a knife.

168
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:39,842
How could he have known that?

169
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:42,803
I think he really can foresee the future.

170
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:44,930
Maybe he's a shaman or something.

171
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:47,349
You know those people
who get possessed by a spirit and stuff?

172
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,268
Maybe he got lucky and saw it.

173
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,603
That's not possible.

174
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:52,771
I've analyzed the CCTV footage.

175
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:56,192
The opponent never took out the knife.

176
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,693
Hey, Mr. Bang.

177
00:12:57,985 --> 00:13:00,196
Do you believe in shamanism?

178
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,614
-My goodness.
-Gosh.

179
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,867
You even believed in monks.

180
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,161
The woman who ruined my life was Eun...

181
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:10,289
A monk? What are you talking about?

182
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:12,124
It's nothing.

183
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:14,335
It doesn't look like it's nothing.

184
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:15,711
-Come on in.
-Thanks.

185
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:18,047
Hey, Ji-uk. Our client's here.

186
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:20,216
-You're here.
-Hello.

187
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:23,677
Be careful with the cup.

188
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:26,013
Our crazy client is here...

189
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:40,486
I was one step too slow.

190
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:52,665
There's a probability

191
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:55,709
that two people will die soon.

192
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:11,350
By the way,

193
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,061
where is everyone?

194
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:16,897
Mr. Byeon thinks

195
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:18,983
he's definitely the one
who's going to die soon.

196
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:20,734
So he went to get a checkup.

197
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,112
Mr. Bang went to get a lucky charm.

198
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,954
You're probably most curious about Ji-uk,

199
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:34,331
but I'm not going to tell you.

200
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:37,084
My gosh.

201
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,963
The day after his dad died

202
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:25,549
is the day Ji-uk and his parents

203
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:28,844
had promised to go on a family picnic.

204
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:33,849
So every year,
Ji-uk goes on a picnic by himself.

205
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:37,144
And every time he does,
I, Mr. Byeon, and Yu-jeong...

206
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:40,940
We...

207
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:44,151
never once disturbed Ji-uk.

208
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,577
I...

209
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:56,413
also have a similar experience.

210
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:58,582
So I know how he must feel.

211
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:02,252
To be honest, it feels really lonely.

212
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:04,922
To be honest,

213
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:06,674
it doesn't feel good to be alone.

214
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:08,842
He could be...

215
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:13,347
waiting for someone to disturb him.

216
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:33,158
I was just passing by,

217
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:37,037
and I thought maybe I should disturb you.

218
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:43,002
Come here and sit down.
I want you to disturb me.

219
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:58,392
Here.

220
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:02,438
Documents on psychiatric evaluation.

221
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:06,442
Read it carefully and see
if So Jeong-ha fits in any category.

222
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:08,777
Okay.

223
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:11,155
You seem a bit dissatisfied these days.

224
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:13,782
Did you come here to slack off
or something?

225
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:15,826
-Of course, not.
-Okay.

226
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:18,412
-Let's work hard.
-Okay.

227
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:52,279
I don't have a lot of memories
about my late dad,

228
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,491
but one of them is related to a bicycle.

229
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:59,036
He said he would buy me one

230
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:01,246
and teach me how to ride it.

231
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:02,956
Then he passed away.

232
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,167
Maybe that's why...

233
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:08,754
I feel happy
whenever I see kids of that age.

234
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:14,968
Let's go.

235
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:16,553
I'll teach you.

236
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:18,222
Pardon?

237
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:21,058
-No, it's okay.
-Don't worry.

238
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:22,142
It's not that hard.

239
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:24,520
That's not it.

240
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:25,604
Here. Come on.

241
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,231
Gosh, wait.

242
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,111
-You just need to go slowly.
-Okay.

243
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:33,821
I'll hold the bicycle from behind.

244
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:35,531
So try pushing

245
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:37,616
-the pedal slowly.
-Should I push it now?

246
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:39,243
-Okay, I'm going to go now.
-Okay.

247
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,161
-Like this?
-I'm holding the bicycle,

248
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:42,704
-so don't be nervous.
-Like this?

249
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,790
-Do it comfortably.
-I'm going to make a left turn.

250
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:46,041
-Okay, try doing that.
-Okay.

251
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,626
Good. You're doing great.

252
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,294
-That's right.
-Like this.

253
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:51,088
-Turn one more time.
-I'll turn left again.

254
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:52,422
-Okay, go.
-Like this?

255
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:53,757
That's right.

256
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,760
You're doing great. Good.

257
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:58,095
Wait a second.

258
00:18:58,178 --> 00:18:59,221
Why? Is it too hard?

259
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:21,368
Why? What's wrong?

260
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:23,412
Excuse me.

261
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:27,332
Could you please report him
to the subway security officers?

262
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,250
Sure.

263
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:30,878
You're disgusting!

264
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,049
Hey!

265
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:39,178
You were the guy who touched
my bottom, weren't you?

266
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:44,850
Hey, he's trying to run away.

267
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:46,226
Don't you dare run away.

268
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:48,228
Don't run away.

269
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:50,397
-Hey!
-Don't you dare escape.

270
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:58,864
I guess she already knew
how to ride a bicycle.

271
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:02,910
My gosh, don't come near me.

272
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:04,244
Go away. Don't come.

273
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:05,370
My gosh.

274
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:08,874
Go away. Don't follow me.

275
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,924
Come over here. Where are you going?

276
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:18,425
-Gosh, no. Stop.
-You little...

277
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:20,719
Give me your camera. Give me that.

278
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:21,845
-No, I can't.
-Gosh!

279
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:23,055
-Give it to me.
-No!

280
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:26,016
My memory card!

281
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,226
It's mine.

282
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:30,145
Good grief, you still haven't
given up your old habit?

283
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:35,108
I don't like living like this either.

284
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:39,571
I bet. You should've been kept
behind bars for longer.

285
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:42,366
Oh, right.

286
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:46,620
You went through such a rough patch.

287
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:49,248
I saw everything in the news.

288
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:51,708
You don't need to bring that up.

289
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:54,211
A few murder incidents

290
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:57,256
have happened in that apartment building.

291
00:20:58,173 --> 00:20:59,967
On the rooftop, you know.

292
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:03,178
That's why I moved
to a different neighborhood right away.

293
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,888
I was scared.

294
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:08,350
Gosh. For goodness' sake.

295
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:33,000
Oh, right. You're actually
better at biking than I am.

296
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:38,630
I taught myself after my dad passed away.
Was I in elementary school?

297
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:42,467
But I had forgotten it all.
I remembered it thanks to you

298
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:44,094
because you were such a good teacher.

299
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:45,262
Cut it out.

300
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:54,146
A few murder incidents

301
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:57,316
have happened in that apartment building.

302
00:21:58,108 --> 00:21:59,818
On the rooftop, you know.

303
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:03,030
That's why I moved
to a different neighborhood right away.

304
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:04,531
I was scared.

305
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:17,961
The rooftop?

306
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:20,964
The rooftop?

307
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:23,508
I think

308
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:26,053
I've witnessed a murder incident.

309
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:27,512
I'm in danger because of that.

310
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:32,517
That day, like any other day

311
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:35,395
I was observing the stars.

312
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:42,736
On the day that Hui-jun got killed,
I was...

313
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:45,238
Well... This is what you told me.

314
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:47,574
Was it around 12:30 a.m.?

315
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:50,577
I looked out the window
because I was feeling a bit hot.

316
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:53,538
I couldn't see anything
because I wasn't wearing my glasses.

317
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:56,541
I just felt the cool breeze,
and that was it.

318
00:22:57,292 --> 00:22:59,544
What if she saw something...

319
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:03,799
but doesn't know what she saw?

320
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:06,426
No way.

321
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:10,222
Let's check. That's the only way
we can find out.

322
00:23:11,389 --> 00:23:12,432
Okay.

323
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:24,444
This neighborhood
hasn't really changed at all.

324
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:27,614
A redevelopment plan
has been in talks since then.

325
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:29,825
Are there still people living here?

326
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:34,454
I'm not sure. I think most of them
were forced out back then.

327
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,835
We should check over there first, right?

328
00:23:40,418 --> 00:23:41,461
Yes.

329
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:54,224
You two are always together, aren't you?

330
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:57,102
-I told you...
-What?

331
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:01,648
to mind your own business,
didn't I? You little...

332
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:03,817
What?

333
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:08,321
You have hair on your face.
Wasn't it tickling you?

334
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:09,489
Goodness.

335
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:12,075
Were you scared?

336
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:14,369
-Me?
-You look scared.

337
00:24:14,452 --> 00:24:16,079
-Not at all.
-Don't lie.

338
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:17,247
I'm not lying.

339
00:24:17,455 --> 00:24:19,207
What's wrong with those two?

340
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,459
-What are you talking about?
-I think you were scared.

341
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:22,836
-You have hair...
-Don't even.

342
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:24,754
Thanks to her, it's never boring.

343
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:26,423
It's fun.

344
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:30,552
I feel like you're trying
to get back at me.

345
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:36,391
Think whatever you want.

346
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:39,686
Are you here for the reinvestigation?

347
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:41,521
Yes.

348
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:43,732
Okay, good luck.

349
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:45,775
Bong-hui, let's go.

350
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:47,194
Okay.

351
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:50,363
Yu-jeong, let's go.

352
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:52,199
All right.

353
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:11,843
Bong-hui.

354
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:15,847
Stay here.

355
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:04,145
If...

356
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:08,692
I witnessed something
without even realizing it

357
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:12,654
and that's why Hui-jun died like that,

358
00:26:13,196 --> 00:26:15,240
and I had to go through
everything I've been through...

359
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:20,912
I think both Hui-jun and I
suffered so unfairly.

360
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:54,529
It'll be okay.

361
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:56,656
I took care of it perfectly.

362
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:11,212
Well, I'll head in.

363
00:27:35,945 --> 00:27:37,947
Can I come in for a second?

364
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:40,325
Well...

365
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:42,869
Sure.

366
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:53,505
I failed to carry out my duties
as a prosecutor.

367
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:56,800
What I mean is...

368
00:27:58,051 --> 00:27:59,594
I should've found it back then.

369
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:02,514
-Had I done that--
-You're so helpless.

370
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:06,559
You always apologize as you can't
keep personal feelings from work.

371
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:08,937
You keep trying to seduce me
by pulling ranks on me.

372
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:11,731
That's not true. I'm keeping
my personal feelings out of this.

373
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:13,191
The apology was purely about work.

374
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:17,570
We're always mixing our personal life
with work. So...

375
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:21,324
I'll change my plan
to play hard to get for a bit longer

376
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:22,409
and give you my answer.

377
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:26,162
I'll give you my answer

378
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:28,289
to your confession.

379
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:45,974
Thanks.

380
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:51,229
Gosh.

381
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:53,398
I haven't given you my answer yet.

382
00:28:53,481 --> 00:28:54,691
Come on. Tell me.

383
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:57,318
-Not today.
-What?

384
00:28:57,402 --> 00:29:00,947
I want to pick a day so that we can
go somewhere and do it properly.

385
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:02,657
Then shall we go out in the evening?

386
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:06,411
Not today.
How about the day after tomorrow?

387
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:08,955
Tomorrow. Let's do it tomorrow, okay?

388
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,415
Tomorrow...

389
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:11,583
Sure.

390
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:13,710
Great. Tomorrow it is.

391
00:29:15,336 --> 00:29:16,212
Tomorrow, right?

392
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:18,590
It's happening tomorrow, right?

393
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:22,510
By the way, you're such a pro at this.

394
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:26,639
I'm using the negotiation skills
I've learned from you.

395
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:30,727
Right, we're certainly failing
to keep our personal feelings away.

396
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:33,563
Bong-hui.

397
00:29:34,647 --> 00:29:35,690
You're great.

398
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,551
All right. Today's agenda is

399
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:07,263
the defense strategy for your cases
and requests regarding--

400
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:08,431
Are you two...

401
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:12,101
together?

402
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:17,357
Are you seeing each other?

403
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:21,402
No, we're not.

404
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:23,905
You know what?

405
00:30:24,697 --> 00:30:26,950
I want you to be together.

406
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:31,204
Mr. Byeon must have
actually been fond of you.

407
00:30:31,287 --> 00:30:32,747
Gosh, this is so unexpected.

408
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:34,249
It's so that I can oppose them dating!

409
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:37,877
They need to date for me
to oppose to their relationship.

410
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:39,796
I'm not going to accept them
until the day I die.

411
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:43,341
I'm going to throw the water glass
and throw money on you too!

412
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:46,761
Then I will dodge the glass quickly
and accept the money gladly.

413
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:49,806
So are you saying that you are going
to date him no matter what?

414
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:52,600
-You told us to.
-That was irony. Don't you know?

415
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:55,478
By the way, what makes this your business?

416
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:56,813
What?

417
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:59,732
Why isn't this my business?

418
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:03,820
You are banned from attending
meetings from now on.

419
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:06,573
Because of you, we can never
get anywhere with our meetings.

420
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:07,574
I second that.

421
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:08,992
Today's meeting is ruined too.

422
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:10,451
Gosh.

423
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:13,746
My head. Good grief, I have a headache.

424
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:29,304
I'll give you my answer

425
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:31,180
to your confession.

426
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:36,728
I want to pick a day so that we can
go somewhere and do it properly.

427
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:11,471
Does this look too formal?

428
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:14,432
Should I change?

429
00:32:20,563 --> 00:32:22,065
-This is it.
-This is it.

430
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:46,714
Ms. Eun.

431
00:32:48,257 --> 00:32:49,384
What a coincidence.

432
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:50,969
I was delivering some packages.

433
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,268
-I'm sorry.
-I'll pick these up.

434
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:00,436
No, I'll do it.

435
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:31,384
Here you go.

436
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:37,557
Oh, no. Do you think it broke?

437
00:33:38,224 --> 00:33:39,392
It'll be fine.

438
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:41,644
Here.

439
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,604
That's a relief.

440
00:34:09,797 --> 00:34:11,632
Don't pressure yourself.

441
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:13,051
Just try to recall.

442
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:17,680
The guy who was going to report
didn't look like him?

443
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:22,810
I'm not sure.

444
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:26,022
Then...

445
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:29,067
what about this guy?

446
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:33,946
Wait! I think it must be him.
He looks familiar.

447
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:36,741
This is the guy?

448
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:39,577
Yes. He looks familiar. I think it's him.

449
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:50,463
Sir,

450
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:53,674
I won't visit you
or cause any harm to you.

451
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:56,010
Just tell me if this is true.

452
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:58,554
The person who supposedly made a report...

453
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:01,682
is the guy I was
with the other day, right?

454
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:04,977
It's the guy in the photo
whom you said wasn't the right guy.

455
00:35:07,396 --> 00:35:08,397
Sir?

456
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:11,234
Sir?

457
00:35:33,422 --> 00:35:34,674
You have three kids, right?

458
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,427
How can all of them be so pretty?

459
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:41,848
How did you...

460
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:44,809
It's a classic blackmailing technique,
but it works every time.

461
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:47,937
Am I scary?

462
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:50,022
Are you scared of me?

463
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:01,159
I'm going to tell you who made the report.

464
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:04,203
It's him.

465
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:10,126
Take a good look at him.

466
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:14,046
-Did you have a good look at him?
-Yes.

467
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:15,548
Give it back.

468
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:17,717
Darn it.

469
00:36:18,634 --> 00:36:19,677
I can't do that.

470
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:26,726
No, it's not.

471
00:36:27,476 --> 00:36:31,230
That doesn't prove
that Jung Hyeon-su is the real murderer.

472
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:34,984
Listening to the same song
doesn't make him a murderer.

473
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:37,862
It could be a mere coincidence.

474
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:56,297
There is no way...

475
00:36:58,007 --> 00:36:59,175
it could be a coincidence.

476
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:01,761
Ms. Eun.

477
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:15,024
Breathe and think clearly.

478
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:21,322
Bong-hui, you have a brain.

479
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:22,949
Use your brain.

480
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:27,203
-This is my conjecture.
-Ms. Eun,

481
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:32,124
I thought that you might be
the only ray of hope I have.

482
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:37,713
He approached me on purpose
as he earned my sympathy.

483
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:46,555
He was checking
if I recognized him or not.

484
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:59,443
If this is all true...

485
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:02,154
Due to fabricated evidence,

486
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:04,407
an innocent man was framed as a murderer.

487
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:07,785
Who upholds the right of such a man?

488
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:10,079
It was me

489
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,373
who got the murderer involved...

490
00:38:17,044 --> 00:38:18,462
and made Ji-uk...

491
00:38:20,589 --> 00:38:22,550
defend a murderer.

492
00:38:57,626 --> 00:38:59,628
You shouldn't recognize me.

493
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:03,174
If you do, I have to get rid of you.

494
00:39:05,384 --> 00:39:06,510
Darn it.

495
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:25,738
It's Ji-uk.

496
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:31,410
Don't say hi to him.

497
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:32,953
He doesn't even like you.

498
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:34,955
But that doesn't mean I shouldn't say hi.

499
00:39:41,962 --> 00:39:43,381
I'm already embarrassed.

500
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:55,226
Do you have business at the court?

501
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:57,686
No, I have an appointment here.

502
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:01,774
-Can I sit down?
-No, you can't.

503
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:05,486
I wasn't planning to do anything.

504
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:07,738
I was just going to talk to you

505
00:40:08,322 --> 00:40:09,865
about work.

506
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:13,786
I see. I'm really sorry, but I have
a very important appointment.

507
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,138
I'm sorry.

508
00:40:32,721 --> 00:40:34,682
But I need to use Prosecutor Cha.

509
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:36,225
I need to use her as an excuse.

510
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:37,518
I'm sorry.

511
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:45,067
We should go too.

512
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:46,402
Okay.

513
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:49,572
Are you okay?

514
00:40:54,743 --> 00:40:55,786
Wait.

515
00:40:59,498 --> 00:41:00,624
Why did you just leave?

516
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:04,587
You didn't misunderstand anything,
did you?

517
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:07,173
No.

518
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:10,134
But I keep seeing you two together,

519
00:41:10,217 --> 00:41:11,844
and it doesn't feel that great.

520
00:41:13,095 --> 00:41:14,972
Okay, I'll be careful from now on.

521
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:18,309
No. You don't need to be careful.

522
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:24,899
I changed my mind.

523
00:41:25,357 --> 00:41:26,650
I'm not giving you my answer today.

524
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:28,611
I'll keep playing hard to get.

525
00:41:30,404 --> 00:41:31,405
Okay, that's fine.

526
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:32,740
I'm okay with that.

527
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,159
But you don't...

528
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:37,411
look so well.

529
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:40,289
I think you should worry about yourself.

530
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:42,082
Bong-hui, what I mean is,

531
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:44,460
I want you to tell me

532
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:46,003
what happened to you.

533
00:41:47,796 --> 00:41:50,216
I just suddenly felt pressured to accept

534
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:51,592
your feelings for me.

535
00:41:52,092 --> 00:41:53,886
I started to feel a bit uncomfortable.

536
00:41:54,136 --> 00:41:55,179
That's all.

537
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,101
You said...

538
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,271
you were going to respect my decision.

539
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:09,485
Please respect my feelings

540
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:11,403
and my decision.

541
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:13,531
Bye, then.

542
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:56,282
Bong-hui.

543
00:42:56,782 --> 00:42:58,325
Mr. Ji.

544
00:42:59,326 --> 00:43:00,369
I'm sorry.

545
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:03,414
I really wanted to talk to someone,

546
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:06,917
but the only person
I could think of was you.

547
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:09,837
Good.

548
00:43:11,505 --> 00:43:12,923
You did a good job by calling me.

549
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:17,595
I'm really scared right now.

550
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:20,806
This is how I felt

551
00:43:21,557 --> 00:43:23,559
when Hui-jun died,

552
00:43:24,184 --> 00:43:26,186
and I got accused of being the murderer.

553
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:29,189
I felt like I did something wrong,

554
00:43:29,523 --> 00:43:32,067
but I couldn't figure out what it was.

555
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:33,277
That was how I felt.

556
00:43:34,528 --> 00:43:36,572
But right now,

557
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:41,952
I'm more scared than when Hui-jun died.

558
00:43:45,831 --> 00:43:48,375
Back then, I just had to handle
the situation by myself.

559
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:52,338
But now, I have precious people around me.

560
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:56,133
I have Mr. Noh.

561
00:43:57,593 --> 00:43:59,428
The more loved ones I have,

562
00:43:59,511 --> 00:44:01,722
the more scared I get, Mr. Ji.

563
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:07,936
You're talking about Jung Hyeon-su, right?

564
00:44:12,566 --> 00:44:14,360
You know I'm quick-witted.

565
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:35,381
A picture of a magpie or tiger
can help us repel bad luck.

566
00:44:35,964 --> 00:44:37,758
It also says that beating a gong
could help,

567
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:40,302
but we can't really do that right now.

568
00:44:42,137 --> 00:44:43,681
He said two people among us will die.

569
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:46,600
One of them is me.

570
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:49,645
Right? It has to be me, right?

571
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:53,440
Do you know you've been saying that
for the past couple of days?

572
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:55,192
Whether it's the age or whatnot,

573
00:44:55,734 --> 00:44:57,444
-it has to be me.
-There's an order in birth,

574
00:44:57,528 --> 00:45:00,030
but that's not the case for death.

575
00:45:00,614 --> 00:45:01,782
I can't just sit here.

576
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:03,325
Where are you going?

577
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:04,368
I'm going to buy a gong.

578
00:45:15,504 --> 00:45:17,464
Is something bothering you?

579
00:45:19,633 --> 00:45:21,385
What could be the reason?

580
00:45:22,511 --> 00:45:23,846
That's what I was thinking.

581
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:25,055
Sorry?

582
00:45:25,764 --> 00:45:27,266
What reason?

583
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:28,767
Well...

584
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:33,439
She's not the type to do such a thing
because of a misunderstanding.

585
00:45:33,522 --> 00:45:34,940
What is going on with her?

586
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:37,526
I wonder what happened.

587
00:45:59,673 --> 00:46:01,341
I'm sure there was an umbrella here.

588
00:46:20,068 --> 00:46:21,445
I know you rejected me,

589
00:46:21,528 --> 00:46:23,489
but at least let me do this for you.

590
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:31,663
Let's go.

591
00:47:02,027 --> 00:47:04,696
Why don't we...

592
00:47:07,616 --> 00:47:10,869
try to be honest with each other?

593
00:47:13,372 --> 00:47:14,456
If there's anything

594
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:18,126
that we couldn't tell each other,

595
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:20,003
let's try telling that today.

596
00:47:20,879 --> 00:47:22,005
If you refuse,

597
00:47:23,382 --> 00:47:24,591
I'll say it first.

598
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:28,929
No.

599
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:36,645
I don't want to do anything right now.

600
00:47:39,398 --> 00:47:41,858
There's a lot on my mind.

601
00:47:44,486 --> 00:47:47,155
Let's talk once my head becomes clear.

602
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:00,627
Okay. I'll give you some time.

603
00:48:02,004 --> 00:48:03,005
Until then,

604
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:05,173
should I treat you as a coworker?

605
00:48:05,799 --> 00:48:06,925
That would be easier, right?

606
00:48:12,806 --> 00:48:13,890
Okay, let's do that.

607
00:48:59,895 --> 00:49:01,063
The melody.

608
00:49:02,064 --> 00:49:03,565
The owner of the banner store.

609
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:07,778
The pervert who witnessed the murder.

610
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:19,206
THE OWNER OF THE BANNER STORE

611
00:49:22,918 --> 00:49:24,252
Let's go meet him first.

612
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:37,265
Why are you so startled?

613
00:49:41,436 --> 00:49:44,189
That's because you suddenly
showed up out of nowhere.

614
00:49:44,356 --> 00:49:46,400
I wouldn't have been startled
had I known it was you.

615
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:50,737
I see. Is that so?

616
00:49:51,571 --> 00:49:52,614
Of course.

617
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:55,158
By the way, what brings you here?

618
00:49:55,242 --> 00:49:58,161
What do you think?
I had a delivery in the area.

619
00:49:58,787 --> 00:50:01,623
I was hoping to see you today.

620
00:50:01,707 --> 00:50:03,208
I'm glad I caught you like this.

621
00:50:03,583 --> 00:50:06,503
Today must be my lucky day,
don't you think so?

622
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:10,132
I'm flattered.

623
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:16,430
Ms. Eun.

624
00:50:19,891 --> 00:50:20,892
Mr. Ji.

625
00:50:22,602 --> 00:50:23,979
Did you call the courier service?

626
00:50:25,313 --> 00:50:27,941
I feel like we've gotten very close
since we see each other so often.

627
00:50:28,024 --> 00:50:29,025
I know, right?

628
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:32,821
Where are you going this late?

629
00:50:32,904 --> 00:50:34,990
Don't work at night.
Just do it tomorrow morning.

630
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:37,117
Let's go in. Give it to me.

631
00:50:40,078 --> 00:50:41,121
Do you want to come in?

632
00:50:41,246 --> 00:50:42,914
No, it's all right. Go on.

633
00:50:43,206 --> 00:50:46,293
Feel free to come by anytime.
Our clients are like family to us.

634
00:51:07,189 --> 00:51:09,733
Do you think he came
to figure out what I'm thinking?

635
00:51:11,777 --> 00:51:12,861
Probably.

636
00:51:14,154 --> 00:51:15,155
By the way,

637
00:51:15,864 --> 00:51:16,948
are you not going to...

638
00:51:18,867 --> 00:51:19,993
tell Ji-uk?

639
00:51:21,536 --> 00:51:22,662
I should tell him.

640
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:25,457
But I can't...

641
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:29,336
I can't bring myself to tell him
that we might have set

642
00:51:29,961 --> 00:51:30,962
a murderer free.

643
00:51:36,218 --> 00:51:37,177
Ji-uk.

644
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:45,727
Hey, guys. Continue your conversation.

645
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:19,845
What is going on?

646
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:26,059
Hence, the prosecution
moves to charge the defendant

647
00:52:26,142 --> 00:52:28,436
-with assault,
-We'll see each other soon.

648
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:31,064
with negligence causing injury
according to Article 266,

649
00:52:31,147 --> 00:52:33,900
with damage to property
according to Article 366,

650
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:37,153
and with obstruction of business
under Article 314 of the Criminal Law.

651
00:52:39,781 --> 00:52:41,825
Defendant, do you admit the charges?

652
00:52:43,785 --> 00:52:46,746
The defendant partially admits
the charges.

653
00:52:47,455 --> 00:52:50,208
As for negligence causing injury,
he and the victim already settled.

654
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:54,296
And the damage to property was
a negligence due to a physical fight,

655
00:52:54,379 --> 00:52:56,089
so we cannot plead guilty.

656
00:52:56,423 --> 00:52:58,675
So has everything been settled
except for the assault charge?

657
00:52:58,758 --> 00:53:02,554
Yes, Your Honor. We're working
on settling that one as well.

658
00:53:02,637 --> 00:53:06,141
However, we cannot get a hold
of the injured party at the moment,

659
00:53:06,224 --> 00:53:08,393
so we're having a hard time
making progress.

660
00:53:08,643 --> 00:53:12,272
We'll do our best to settle
if you can allow us a little more time.

661
00:53:25,076 --> 00:53:26,870
-Let's ask them.
-Okay.

662
00:53:26,953 --> 00:53:28,538
-Hello.
-Excuse me.

663
00:53:28,622 --> 00:53:29,956
This man lives in that house.

664
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:32,375
Have you seen him at all?

665
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:34,169
I've never seen him before.

666
00:53:34,669 --> 00:53:35,587
-Sorry.
-Thank you.

667
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:36,630
Thank you.

668
00:53:40,258 --> 00:53:42,135
Like we expected, he wasn't home either.

669
00:53:42,636 --> 00:53:44,429
He neither has a job nor a family,

670
00:53:44,512 --> 00:53:47,015
so we had to stop our search there,
but I can try to--

671
00:53:47,265 --> 00:53:48,934
You should come and see this.

672
00:53:50,143 --> 00:53:53,271
Next news.
Another random attack took place.

673
00:53:53,521 --> 00:53:56,858
A man in his 30s who attacked people
at a café a little while ago

674
00:53:57,067 --> 00:53:58,944
visited the same café

675
00:53:59,027 --> 00:54:01,821
and tried to attack the part-timer
with a weapon.

676
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:06,284
He claims that the female part-timer
looked down on him

677
00:54:06,368 --> 00:54:08,495
and that he went back to the café
to get back at her.

678
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:11,539
The police have caught
the assailant, Mr. Kim, red-handed.

679
00:54:11,665 --> 00:54:15,543
They will investigate to see
if he is related to other cases.

680
00:54:15,627 --> 00:54:18,296
That's the cafe
where So Jeong-ha had the fight.

681
00:54:19,339 --> 00:54:20,465
That means...

682
00:54:21,883 --> 00:54:23,468
Mr. So's claim that he stopped

683
00:54:23,551 --> 00:54:26,596
the man from taking out the knife
was indeed true.

684
00:54:28,014 --> 00:54:30,100
-It could be.
-That also means

685
00:54:30,308 --> 00:54:33,895
the possibility that two of us will
die like he predicted is...

686
00:54:34,813 --> 00:54:36,982
Stop talking nonsense.

687
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:44,197
This is an announcement.

688
00:54:44,572 --> 00:54:47,158
Japan Airline 271

689
00:54:47,492 --> 00:54:49,494
has departed from Tokyo.

690
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:52,914
Japan Airline 271...

691
00:55:01,339 --> 00:55:04,217
Thank you for everything, Mr. Noh.
I really appreciate it.

692
00:55:04,884 --> 00:55:07,095
You'll probably be sentenced to a fine.

693
00:55:07,262 --> 00:55:08,346
I see.

694
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:11,641
By the way, you kept texting someone
during the trial.

695
00:55:11,725 --> 00:55:13,143
Whom are you waiting for?

696
00:55:14,394 --> 00:55:17,480
My girlfriend, whom I haven't seen
for a long time, is coming back.

697
00:55:17,564 --> 00:55:18,565
I see.

698
00:55:19,607 --> 00:55:22,068
Oh, I was also wondering...

699
00:55:22,944 --> 00:55:25,780
You said you can foresee the future.

700
00:55:25,864 --> 00:55:26,906
Yes.

701
00:55:27,073 --> 00:55:28,199
Is it true?

702
00:55:28,533 --> 00:55:32,328
Or is it more like a prank using
probability and coincidence?

703
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:34,789
It is true.

704
00:55:35,457 --> 00:55:39,961
I get hunches. It only happens
once in a while though.

705
00:55:41,337 --> 00:55:45,133
You said two people at my firm
might die. Was that also true?

706
00:55:45,383 --> 00:55:46,509
Yes, that's true too.

707
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:52,098
I guess you don't believe me.

708
00:55:54,934 --> 00:55:55,977
No, I don't.

709
00:55:57,937 --> 00:55:58,980
I'm not kidding though.

710
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:02,984
I should get going.

711
00:56:03,068 --> 00:56:04,319
-Thank you so much.
-No problem.

712
00:56:04,402 --> 00:56:05,487
-Bye.
-Bye.

713
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:15,413
Gosh, no!

714
00:56:21,544 --> 00:56:23,254
There's a probability

715
00:56:24,005 --> 00:56:26,007
that two people will die soon.

716
00:56:29,969 --> 00:56:31,262
I didn't know

717
00:56:32,305 --> 00:56:34,057
that I'd be one of them.

718
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:40,939
Mr. So!

719
00:56:44,734 --> 00:56:48,113
Mr. So, are you okay?

720
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:29,821
Hello?

721
00:57:30,613 --> 00:57:32,240
Where are you?

722
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:36,453
Well... He's being stubborn and insisting

723
00:57:36,536 --> 00:57:39,038
he won't get surgery before you get here.

724
00:57:39,706 --> 00:57:42,500
Yes. You should get here
as soon as possible.

725
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:47,714
I tried persuading him,
but it didn't work.

726
00:57:48,756 --> 00:57:52,427
Yes, I'm sorry. Please come here
as soon as possible.

727
00:57:53,178 --> 00:57:54,220
Okay.

728
00:58:01,978 --> 00:58:04,814
Mr. So, please don't be like this.
You need to get surgery first.

729
00:58:06,691 --> 00:58:08,776
I've been told that I'm not likely

730
00:58:09,444 --> 00:58:10,612
to come out alive.

731
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:13,656
If that's the case,

732
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:16,493
I'd rather see...

733
00:58:19,037 --> 00:58:20,663
the person whom I've missed so much.

734
00:58:25,293 --> 00:58:26,794
By the way,

735
00:58:28,254 --> 00:58:29,881
I'm not a swindler after all, right?

736
00:58:57,909 --> 00:58:59,160
Mr. Noh.

737
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:02,705
Come closer for a second.

738
00:59:08,002 --> 00:59:09,671
Don't cry too much.

739
00:59:10,421 --> 00:59:11,673
Mr. Noh.

740
00:59:14,342 --> 00:59:16,052
Everything will be okay.

741
00:59:19,597 --> 00:59:21,182
What are you saying all of a sudden?

742
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:26,312
Jeong-ha!

743
00:59:28,064 --> 00:59:29,107
Jeong-ha.

744
00:59:30,149 --> 00:59:31,401
Jeong-ha...

745
00:59:33,736 --> 00:59:34,696
You made it.

746
00:59:34,779 --> 00:59:36,239
Jeong-ha, I'm here.

747
00:59:36,322 --> 00:59:38,533
You need to see me.

748
00:59:38,992 --> 00:59:41,202
Jeong-ha, wake up.

749
00:59:42,287 --> 00:59:44,163
Jeong-ha, open your eyes.

750
00:59:45,039 --> 00:59:48,126
Please open your eyes. Come on, Jeong-ha.

751
00:59:52,046 --> 00:59:53,131
All of us...

752
00:59:54,007 --> 00:59:55,341
have lost someone.

753
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:03,725
Some lost a family member.

754
01:00:04,517 --> 01:00:05,768
Some lost a friend.

755
01:00:06,144 --> 01:00:07,312
Some lost a lover.

756
01:00:08,146 --> 01:00:10,315
Whether the person was kind or evil,

757
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:12,734
there is no one

758
01:00:13,484 --> 01:00:15,278
who didn't lose someone

759
01:00:16,237 --> 01:00:17,739
in their course of life.

760
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:35,590
Yes, Mr. Noh.

761
01:00:39,552 --> 01:00:43,097
Where am I now? I am...

762
01:00:45,058 --> 01:00:46,434
Okay. Stay where you are.

763
01:01:15,463 --> 01:01:17,298
Therefore, life is cruel.

764
01:01:21,427 --> 01:01:22,428
If that's true,

765
01:01:23,137 --> 01:01:25,390
during this cruel, limited period of time

766
01:01:25,973 --> 01:01:29,811
and in a way, in this brief lifetime,

767
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:32,480
the only thing we can do is...

768
01:01:49,330 --> 01:01:50,331
Bong-hui.

769
01:01:55,253 --> 01:01:56,254
Please...

770
01:01:58,548 --> 01:02:00,383
Please like me back now.

771
01:02:07,098 --> 01:02:08,766
I'm sorry I couldn't keep my promise

772
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:11,519
that I would wait for you.

773
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:18,359
Bong-hui.

774
01:02:21,738 --> 01:02:23,823
I want you to like me back now.

775
01:02:45,595 --> 01:02:46,804
Where are you going at this hour?

776
01:02:46,888 --> 01:02:47,722
A friend of mine

777
01:02:47,805 --> 01:02:49,807
had a mishap.

778
01:02:50,308 --> 01:02:51,726
I have to come up with the order first.

779
01:02:51,809 --> 01:02:52,852
Who's going to go first?

780
01:02:52,935 --> 01:02:54,771
It's been a while, my friend.

781
01:02:55,188 --> 01:02:56,481
Bong-hui, are you all right?

782
01:02:57,523 --> 01:02:59,484
Do you want us to go through
this separately?

783
01:02:59,567 --> 01:03:01,611
Or do you want to go through it together?

784
01:03:01,694 --> 01:03:03,905
I want you by my side
when we go through this.

785
01:03:06,866 --> 01:03:08,868
