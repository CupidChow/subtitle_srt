1
00:00:36,786 --> 00:00:38,913
BONG-HUI: I'M ON MY WAY TO HANMU PARK
TO MEET GO CHAN-HO

2
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:48,381
This is what one poet said.

3
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,259
We're likely to know the start of things.

4
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:55,388
But we aren't likely to know
the end of them.

5
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:00,268
In my case, it was the opposite.

6
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:04,773
I had to experience the end of things
many times in my short life.

7
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:08,234
I hesitated to start this
because I was afraid of the end.

8
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:13,698
The moment I realized
my feelings for you...

9
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:18,578
Don't fall for me.

10
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:21,372
I ran away from you...

11
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,333
like a coward.

12
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:27,670
Bong-hui, I'm sorry.

13
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:29,923
Please stay...

14
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:34,010
Please stay with me for five minutes.

15
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:36,429
And I failed...

16
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:38,556
because...

17
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:42,769
I started to have feelings
for you without realizing.

18
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:45,396
I just realized it late.

19
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:49,442
I wonder when and where it all began.

20
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,571
I realized it too late, and I can't
figure out where it all started.

21
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:56,491
Come back to me.

22
00:01:58,451 --> 00:01:59,577
Come work for me.

23
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:28,648
The only thing...

24
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:31,359
that I know now is...

25
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:46,791
I'm sorry.

26
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:49,419
Do you mean it?

27
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:51,713
Yes, I do.

28
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:54,674
Let's see if you are telling the truth.

29
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:03,933
You are telling the truth.

30
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:30,793
Mr. Noh.

31
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,814
I can't get my head around it.

32
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:54,901
I can't stop this new beginning with you.

33
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,362
And it has now begun.

34
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:39,070
Bong-hui.

35
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:22,465
Hey.

36
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:28,304
You little...

37
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:37,438
What was that? My gosh.

38
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:38,898
Where are you going?

39
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:41,901
I told you to pay for your mistake.

40
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:43,152
Do you think I was joking?

41
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:44,779
I can't do this anymore!

42
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:53,454
This is driving me crazy.

43
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,581
My gosh.

44
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,628
My goodness.

45
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:51,012
My gosh.

46
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:00,062
Wait a minute. Let's see.

47
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:05,776
Now...

48
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:13,117
Four people have disappeared,

49
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:16,579
and three people will disappear.

50
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:54,200
I was just about to knock on your door.

51
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:57,954
What a coincidence.

52
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:00,831
I was just about to go see you anyway.

53
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:02,917
Oh, really?

54
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:06,045
Then shall we talk for a while?

55
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:08,256
Okay, let's do that.

56
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,075
This is refreshing and nice.

57
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:39,870
Right.

58
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:48,170
Bong-hui, what...

59
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,715
-What happened earlier was--
-I'm pretty sure...

60
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:55,344
it wasn't our first time.

61
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:58,514
Let's not mull over...

62
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:00,891
something...

63
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:03,811
that we've done several times already.

64
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,690
No.

65
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:09,358
That's not it.

66
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:11,193
I can't just let it go.

67
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:15,865
-Bong-hui, I--
-I'm really...

68
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:20,828
trying my best to get over you,
just like you told me to.

69
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:22,747
No. Actually, I don't like you anymore.

70
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:29,128
I don't want to go back and forth
over a small accident like this.

71
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:31,130
And I don't plan to do so either.

72
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,968
I can't go through this.

73
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:40,806
I'm in a happy place right now.

74
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,934
I'm working at a company
where I can eat and sleep.

75
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:47,188
It feels like a dream to be working
at such a nice place.

76
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,190
I feel so lucky.

77
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:52,068
I really like my coworkers too.

78
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,195
I regret pushing you away.

79
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:58,282
I actually thank you for turning me down.

80
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:01,911
I mean it.

81
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,038
I want to turn back time.

82
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:06,082
That's what I was going to say.

83
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:07,833
I'm happy with our relationship right now.

84
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:11,754
I want it to last for a long time.

85
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:19,970
Goodnight.

86
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:04,140
Good job, Bong-hui.

87
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:41,010
My goodness.

88
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,804
My gosh, this is so tiring.

89
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,558
-There you go. Goodbye.
-Thank you.

90
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:48,851
My goodness.

91
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:54,356
My gosh, why did he park the car here?

92
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,567
Mr. Ham, that little...

93
00:12:57,818 --> 00:12:59,069
My goodness.

94
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:05,451
Let's see.

95
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,330
I need to call for a chauffeur service.

96
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:20,883
Oh, gosh.

97
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:34,813
My goodness.

98
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:42,655
Are you okay?

99
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:46,450
I only did my civic duty.

100
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:50,913
I heard that journalists
even write stories about...

101
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:54,291
these kind of things,
but there's no need for that.

102
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:55,543
What's your name, sir?

103
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:59,755
Me?
I'm the chairman of Byeon and Partners...

104
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:04,552
Well, I used to be the chairman.
Right now, I work at Byeon and...

105
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:07,555
No, wait. It's Noh and Ji...

106
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:09,431
Was it Noh and Ji?

107
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:13,644
Anyway, I'm a lawyer.
My name is Byeon Yeong-hui

108
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:17,398
Why? What are you doing?

109
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:19,900
Sir, I need to measure
your blood alcohol level.

110
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:23,112
I only had two glasses of beer.
I have no problem blowing into this.

111
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:28,033
Are you sure this isn't broken?

112
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:29,952
I knew it. You were drunk driving.

113
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:32,538
My gosh, I only had two glasses.

114
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:33,747
You'll need to come with me.

115
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:36,333
I don't mind going with you,
but I think this is broken.

116
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:44,550
MR. BYEON YEONG-HUI

117
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:22,171
I already decided to forget
about what happened. Don't dwell on it.

118
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,765
Please stop...

119
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:46,528
Gosh.

120
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:34,201
You talked yesterday,

121
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:37,162
so I'll talk now.

122
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:40,207
Sorry? About what?

123
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:43,460
First off,

124
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:45,504
I want to apologize.

125
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:47,506
Pardon?

126
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:51,468
I took too long to realize
how I feel about you,

127
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:53,053
and I was scared too.

128
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:57,224
This will sound like an excuse,

129
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:01,729
but I was afraid that I might not be
good enough for you.

130
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:07,401
Are you done with that?

131
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:10,320
Oh, yes. I'm done.

132
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:11,488
Great, thanks.

133
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:23,083
Because it took me so long,

134
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:25,419
you seem to have given up
your feelings for me.

135
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:29,173
All right. I totally respect that.

136
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:33,635
What I'm trying to say is...
I'm not asking you to change your mind

137
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:36,221
or like me again.
That's not what I'm trying to tell you.

138
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:40,809
Since I respect your decision,

139
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:44,396
you should respect mine as well.
So in other words...

140
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,485
let me like you.

141
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,446
Just leave me be.

142
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:02,539
I won't stress you out.

143
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:05,584
I'll never interfere
with your peaceful life.

144
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:08,504
Things can stay like this. Then one day,

145
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:10,172
if you feel like it,

146
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:13,467
change your mind...

147
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:15,677
and like me again.

148
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:21,600
I'll be waiting.

149
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:23,685
You can take your time.

150
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:29,691
Oh, it looks like you've forgotten
to breathe again.

151
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,151
Breathe.

152
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:34,488
There you go.

153
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:45,415
I left the cup here.

154
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:03,350
Gosh.

155
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:06,770
I'm the one who needs to breathe.

156
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:29,877
What should we do with the adulterer
who's suing for alimony?

157
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:31,670
It's a small case.

158
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:33,797
Right.

159
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:37,718
Actually, I think it'll be good
if Ms. Eun takes it on.

160
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:43,765
Shall we do this meeting
without those two?

161
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:46,476
I wonder what happened
in a matter of a day.

162
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:48,645
Don't you want to dig it up?

163
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:50,564
What happened was--

164
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:52,900
-Not you, Mr. Byeon.
-Gosh, I don't want to know.

165
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:55,986
I became a hero.

166
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:57,070
A hero?

167
00:19:57,738 --> 00:20:00,699
I saved someone's life.

168
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:02,451
But...

169
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,286
But?

170
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:08,999
Are you sure this isn't broken?

171
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,460
I knew it. You were drunk driving.

172
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:13,545
God damn cops!

173
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:16,423
I think it's extremely unfair.

174
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:20,510
I sent my driver home early
because something came up at his home.

175
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:23,597
When I was about to call
a chauffeur service,

176
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,642
the accident happened, and I stopped it.

177
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:27,893
Do you have dash cam footage?

178
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:31,021
It was off. My driver
must have turned the camera off.

179
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:33,357
I'm serious.

180
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,900
Is there a phone record with a chauffeur?

181
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:37,736
Well, that's...
I was about to call the service.

182
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:38,987
So no.

183
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,907
You know DUI
is kind of like killing someone, right?

184
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,242
Hey, Ms. Lack of Evidence!

185
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:45,619
I think it's like an attempted murder.

186
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:49,665
Exactly. You have no right to call
me Ms. Lack of Evidence.

187
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:51,750
Why were you sitting
in the driver's seat to begin with?

188
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:54,628
Because it was hot. I just wanted
to turn on the air conditioning.

189
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:56,338
You were idling the engine too?

190
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,548
You'd be fined
if you do it for over five minutes.

191
00:20:58,632 --> 00:20:59,716
You all know, right?

192
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,886
He said you can call him your son
if he drinks again.

193
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,513
I don't want a son like him.

194
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:05,722
I feel bad for you.

195
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:09,309
I'll file for an administrative appeal

196
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:10,894
and go to trial.

197
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:13,730
Just accept the punishment.

198
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:15,732
-What?
-It's just license revocation

199
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:17,693
and fine, so why would you go to trial?

200
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:19,695
It's just a slap on the wrist!

201
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:22,823
Those with important social status
should receive heavier punishment.

202
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:23,907
As an example.

203
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:25,701
-Someone like him.
-That's what I'm saying.

204
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:27,869
You ungrateful brats.

205
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:30,539
You guys are betrayers.

206
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:33,000
All right. As usual, this is our cue
to wrap up the meeting.

207
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:36,378
Gosh. Hey, you won't help me?

208
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:38,463
Hey. Guys!

209
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:41,383
Gosh, these brats.

210
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:44,469
Goodness.

211
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:45,637
The meeting is over.

212
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:48,849
Gosh.

213
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:51,977
Jeez.

214
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:57,774
Sorry? You want me to find out what
Jung Hyeon-su was up to last night?

215
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:00,360
I keep thinking that it's strange.

216
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:05,449
What...

217
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:14,041
Well...

218
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:23,425
Something urgent came up.
We will have to reschedule.

219
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:25,802
It was weird timing
to receive that text message.

220
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:28,638
The phone is turned off.
Please leave a message...

221
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,266
His phone got turned off right away.

222
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:32,976
And most of all,

223
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,936
the air at the scene was odd.

224
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:36,897
The air?

225
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:39,274
Yes, I can't explain it in words.
It's just this feeling I got.

226
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:41,151
My hunch, you know.

227
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:44,613
Investigations must be based on science.

228
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:46,907
Right, you always go on about science.

229
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:49,743
That's why I'm asking you to see
if you can find evidence.

230
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:53,997
So you're saying something isn't right
with Jung Hyeon-su, right?

231
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:56,583
Yes. Regardless of the reason,

232
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:59,711
he did lie. He lied to me.

233
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:03,757
And he made a fool of Bong-hui
even though she trusted him.

234
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,510
Right. Everything is about
Ms. Eun, isn't it?

235
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:12,724
I hope that this feeling I'm getting
is nothing

236
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:14,601
and that I've been worried for nothing.

237
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:17,104
I hope that Jung Hyeon-su is a good person

238
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:18,855
who was falsely accused.

239
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:22,484
Like how Bong-hui believes.

240
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:23,777
Right, I hear you.

241
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:27,948
Bong-hui.

242
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:33,620
Mr. Bang, look at those two.

243
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:36,206
What could they possibly have
to talk about all the time?

244
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:37,707
Why are they always together?

245
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:39,209
They're always there.

246
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:40,544
Exactly.

247
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:44,297
They're always laughing together
and chatting away.

248
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:47,217
I'm here for today's counseling session.

249
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,844
Aren't you here because you're curious?

250
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:51,179
Well, half and half?

251
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,977
I was totally caught off guard.

252
00:23:57,727 --> 00:23:58,728
By Ji-uk?

253
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:00,689
Yes.

254
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:03,024
It hurts so much,

255
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:06,361
yet it makes me very happy
at the same time.

256
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:09,072
It also makes me so mad.

257
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:11,324
I'm not really following.

258
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:12,701
Love is all about timing.

259
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:14,911
I know that. I know that very well.

260
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:18,790
My timing is good with most things,
but not with that.

261
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,923
What does he want me to do now?

262
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:30,802
What a joke. It's too late.

263
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:34,639
I'm saying I will not be swayed.

264
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:42,647
What a nice day.

265
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:50,197
I'm on my way to meet Go Chan-ho
as I couldn't see him yesterday.

266
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:52,240
So?

267
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,743
I thought you'd be interested.

268
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:58,079
Never mind if you're not.

269
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:06,254
You aren't interested?

270
00:25:06,379 --> 00:25:07,714
I'm very much interested.

271
00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:31,780
Let me like you.

272
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:33,823
Just leave me be.

273
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:37,869
I'll be waiting.

274
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:39,746
You can take your time.

275
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:50,966
Gosh, stop. Stop thinking about that.

276
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:54,135
What did you say?

277
00:25:58,848 --> 00:26:01,810
Why? Did I do something wrong?

278
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:21,955
So you like me? You're sorry
that you realized it late?

279
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:24,207
Yes, Bong-hui.

280
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:26,084
Wait all you want.

281
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:27,711
I won't change my mind.

282
00:26:28,211 --> 00:26:29,546
I won't because it was so unfair.

283
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:34,718
I went through such a hard time.
Now you like me?

284
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:37,804
It's too late.

285
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:39,681
You realized it too late.

286
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:42,309
I'm sorry.

287
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:44,102
I'll make you suffer as much as I have.

288
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:46,646
-Okay.
-Don't even answer me.

289
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:47,939
I hate you so much.

290
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:52,360
I hate you even more
since you are doing as I said.

291
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:56,740
Then what should I do?

292
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:04,205
Anyway,

293
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:06,333
you will have to really wait for me
this time.

294
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:08,710
It will be longer than seven minutes
this time.

295
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:12,505
You might get old and die
while you wait for me.

296
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:15,175
-I understand.
-I'm not joking.

297
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:16,801
I know.

298
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:23,975
Hold on.

299
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:26,728
By the way,

300
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:29,731
starting now, change your attitude.

301
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:32,317
Since this is about work,
I have the upper hand.

302
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:34,319
Did you get that?

303
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:39,115
Yes, Mr. Noh

304
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:41,159
Bong-hui, hurry.

305
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:42,243
I'm going.

306
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:46,414
He's on leave?

307
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:48,458
He said something urgent came up.

308
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:54,214
Call me anytime.

309
00:27:54,589 --> 00:27:57,258
I'll help you if there's anything
I can do for you.

310
00:28:01,429 --> 00:28:04,974
I mentioned that I have to use
some of my unused vacation days.

311
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:08,186
I need to use them right now.

312
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:11,606
I understand.

313
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:13,483
Thank you.

314
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:21,116
Did he expect
he'd need to go on a vacation?

315
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:23,576
It seems like it, right?

316
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:28,540
As expected, Go Chan-ho isn't home.

317
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,041
He isn't.

318
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:33,670
Then...

319
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:38,258
No, it's really hard
to break into that house.

320
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:40,927
We need an excavator
to make a hole to get in.

321
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:46,141
Bong-hui, I think you are capable
of doing anything. Aren't you?

322
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:48,977
-You are.
-Are you here to look at the house?

323
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:51,938
This is my building.

324
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:54,733
You two look like newlyweds.

325
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:57,819
Are you looking for your marital house?

326
00:28:58,945 --> 00:28:59,946
-Yes.
-Yes.

327
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:04,993
The guy who lives here gave me his
permission

328
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:07,328
to look at the house
even when he's not home.

329
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:09,247
Take your time to take a look.

330
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:12,959
When was this unit put on the market?

331
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:18,173
Well, let me think. It was
around May 10th or 20th.

332
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:21,342
It's before the murder of Chef Yang.

333
00:29:21,634 --> 00:29:22,635
Who?

334
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:24,888
No, it's nothing.

335
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:28,391
Can we take a look around it
privately? Just the two of us?

336
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,562
We just need to discuss
some private matters.

337
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:35,523
Since we're newlyweds, we must talk
about where the bed goes and stuff.

338
00:29:36,232 --> 00:29:39,068
You look so intimate with each other
just like newlyweds.

339
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:42,489
Fine. I'll leave you two alone.
Look at it in private.

340
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:55,376
Let's look at it in private.

341
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:01,299
Where on earth could he have gone?

342
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,051
I don't know.

343
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:05,929
Could he have run away or something?

344
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:08,890
Or could he have gone somewhere
to take care of something?

345
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:13,436
If none of these are correct,
could he have gone on a trip?

346
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:15,271
It's plausible. Or...

347
00:30:16,564 --> 00:30:18,441
he could already have disappeared.

348
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:19,943
Sorry?

349
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:22,487
Nothing.

350
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:32,497
What?

351
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:35,291
What is this?

352
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:36,709
Mr. Noh.

353
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:55,103
We went to Go Chan-ho's place, but...

354
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:57,856
There was nothing.

355
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:00,733
You didn't find anything?

356
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:03,319
No. Oh, right.

357
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:06,489
I'm not sure if this would be useful,

358
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:09,033
but I brought it just in case. Here.

359
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,247
It won't be easy, but I'll look into it.

360
00:31:14,497 --> 00:31:15,957
I'd really appreciate it.

361
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,292
Like I said, it won't be easy.

362
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:20,336
I feel like my hands are tied
now that I have no governmental power.

363
00:31:29,178 --> 00:31:30,179
Me too.

364
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:36,352
Will you not tell Ms. Eun
about Jung Hyeon-su?

365
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:41,065
I was going to tell her,

366
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:44,360
but I've decided to wait on it
as nothing has been confirmed yet.

367
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:48,197
SEONHO DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

368
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:53,369
My son.

369
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:56,039
It's a case file on Jang Hui-jun's case.

370
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:02,670
ESTIMATED TIME OF DEATH
MIDNIGHT, MAY 11, 2015

371
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:06,341
I'd like the two of you
to reinvestigate the case.

372
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:08,009
Reinvestigate it?

373
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:11,596
I've tried so hard to come to terms...

374
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:14,849
with the verdict of the trial.

375
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:39,791
I went to the scene numerous times

376
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:42,377
to look for different possibilities.

377
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:46,422
I wondered if someone who was
holding grudges against me...

378
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:50,593
killed my son for revenge.

379
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,889
But it wasn't that.

380
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:56,432
I thought about it over and over

381
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:58,559
and it has got to be her.

382
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:00,895
There's no evidence that tells otherwise.

383
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:02,981
I read the case file.

384
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:05,024
There were two weapons. One was...

385
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:06,109
That's right.

386
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:07,819
I fabricated the evidence.

387
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:11,072
I used tricks
in order to catch Eun Bong-hui.

388
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:13,491
Then what about the other one?

389
00:33:13,908 --> 00:33:15,201
I'm not sure how this will sound,

390
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:19,789
but I think I know
what you're thinking, sir.

391
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:21,582
Prosecutor Noh Ji-uk.

392
00:33:21,874 --> 00:33:24,794
He was the prosecutor in charge
of the case.

393
00:33:24,877 --> 00:33:28,339
You're probably thinking
that he placed it on the scene

394
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:30,508
just like what you did.

395
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:41,019
In order to save Eun Bong-hui,

396
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:43,646
he must've planted
the evidence on the scene

397
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:44,897
just like I did.

398
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:46,441
That's my conclusion.

399
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:49,485
Ji-uk would not do such a thing, sir.

400
00:33:49,652 --> 00:33:50,820
If that's what you think,

401
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:52,822
go ahead and prove it to me.

402
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:57,035
I'm saying you should try to find
something new, no matter what it is.

403
00:34:18,347 --> 00:34:19,390
What?

404
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:20,933
Mr. Byeon.

405
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:22,226
Say it, you brat.

406
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:24,854
Shall I...

407
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:27,065
help you with the trial?

408
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:32,028
Ms. Lack of Evidence, will you?

409
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:34,322
I won't help you
if you keep calling me like that.

410
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:35,573
All right, Eun Bong-hui.

411
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:36,657
Ms. Eun.

412
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:42,413
All right, Ms. Eun. Help me out.

413
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:44,832
I feel that it's so unfair.

414
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:47,585
My insurance won't cover if this is a DUI.

415
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:48,920
Did you know that?

416
00:34:49,545 --> 00:34:50,797
Everyone, please come.

417
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:54,967
CHORE BOARD: DO THE DISHES,
BUY COFFEE, TAKE OUT TRASH

418
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:06,270
This week's designator for dishes,
coffee, and trash is

419
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:07,939
you, Ms. Eun.

420
00:35:22,161 --> 00:35:25,456
I'd like to volunteer.

421
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:27,625
Damn it.

422
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:34,507
Did something happen?

423
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,593
LAWYER EUN BONG-HUI

424
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:40,930
Drink up.

425
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:55,027
Are you done with that?

426
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:56,571
I'll clean it up.

427
00:35:56,946 --> 00:35:58,614
-I'll put it away for you.
-Thank you.

428
00:36:05,913 --> 00:36:07,623
Ms. Eun, are you done?

429
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,208
I'm working on the files.

430
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:11,919
Let me see your hands.

431
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:14,630
My hands?

432
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:19,302
Eat them while you work.

433
00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:21,053
Thank you.

434
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:36,903
LAWYER EUN BONG-HUI

435
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:41,365
Were you running Widmark's formula?

436
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:43,451
-I see.
-Yes.

437
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:45,703
This formula is to calculate someone's

438
00:36:45,786 --> 00:36:48,623
blood alcohol content
after driving under the influence.

439
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:49,957
So...

440
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:13,147
Make sure you check this part.
Can you do it?

441
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:31,582
Drink some soda. You might choke.

442
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:37,088
Mom.

443
00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:39,548
I think I'm in my golden days now.

444
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:40,675
Golden days?

445
00:37:40,883 --> 00:37:43,928
You know how people have their golden days

446
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:45,596
like when they are in their prime.

447
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,098
Really? Why do you think so?

448
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:50,309
Did something spark between you
and the CEO of your firm?

449
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:51,560
Is it going well?

450
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:54,313
It's not that. It's just...

451
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:59,402
I'm so happy
that all of my colleagues adore me.

452
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:01,112
I'm so happy that it sometimes scares me.

453
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:04,657
I'm afraid that
this might all be taken away from me.

454
00:38:05,574 --> 00:38:06,575
Pathetic.

455
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:14,750
When you had something, you didn't
let people take it away from you.

456
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:18,587
It's just that you never had
a lot of things growing up.

457
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:20,006
Really?

458
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:22,049
She looks like it.

459
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:29,682
Mom, by the way, why do I get the feeling

460
00:38:29,765 --> 00:38:31,684
your boss is always eavesdropping
our conversation?

461
00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:33,269
Is it just me?

462
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:37,690
Let her be.
It's because her life is boring.

463
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:39,608
Yeong-sun!

464
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:22,443
The lawyers

465
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,820
made several visits.

466
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:27,114
They also met the couple in the photo.

467
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:28,574
I see.

468
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,994
So did your alibi hold up?

469
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:33,913
Yes.

470
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:35,706
It's all thanks to you.

471
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:37,458
-I'll get going now.
-Bye.

472
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:46,300
What's going on?

473
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:57,311
Am I being suspected?

474
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:17,581
Mr. Noh.

475
00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:21,585
Mr. Noh.

476
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:23,504
Mr. Noh?

477
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:30,803
Mr. Noh, are you all right?

478
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:33,055
I heard you all the way
from the first floor.

479
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:39,603
Bong-hui.

480
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:42,940
Bong-hui, you are okay, right?

481
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:46,360
You are safe, right?

482
00:40:47,069 --> 00:40:48,946
What? What is it?

483
00:40:49,321 --> 00:40:52,533
Did I die in your nightmare or something?

484
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,661
I don't know.

485
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:58,873
I don't know who it was.

486
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:01,041
Someone...

487
00:41:01,917 --> 00:41:03,127
got hurt.

488
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:22,563
I...

489
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:27,526
I'm sorry.

490
00:41:31,405 --> 00:41:32,490
I'll get going.

491
00:41:49,089 --> 00:41:50,132
Get some sleep.

492
00:41:52,301 --> 00:41:54,470
I'll stay with you just for five minutes.

493
00:41:55,262 --> 00:41:56,472
Don't get the wrong idea.

494
00:41:59,141 --> 00:42:00,392
This is love for mankind.

495
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:59,285
I won't fall for you no matter
how cute you look sleeping.

496
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:07,835
COURT IN SESSION

497
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:11,755
The defendant finished drinking at 9 p.m.

498
00:43:11,964 --> 00:43:14,300
The time of the accident

499
00:43:14,383 --> 00:43:17,511
was 9:35 p.m. The police officer
who arrived at the scene

500
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:20,347
conducted the sobriety test at 9:45pm.

501
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:21,849
The sobriety test was conducted

502
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:24,435
at the time when the blood alcohol
content was on the rise.

503
00:43:24,518 --> 00:43:26,645
Hence, it can't be concluded

504
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:29,565
the blood alcohol content when driving
was over 0.05 percent.

505
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:31,900
DEFENSE COUNSEL, DEFENDANT

506
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:41,452
Darn it.

507
00:43:49,501 --> 00:43:50,628
Are you here to see Bong-hui?

508
00:43:52,004 --> 00:43:53,505
I'm here for Mr. Byeon.

509
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:56,050
He's like a father figure to me.

510
00:43:56,925 --> 00:43:58,886
I'm here to see
our youngest lawyer, Bong-hui.

511
00:43:59,428 --> 00:44:01,138
Let's see how good she is. Shall we?

512
00:44:01,388 --> 00:44:04,308
First of all, the grounds of the claim

513
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:07,269
that he finished drinking at 9 p.m.

514
00:44:07,561 --> 00:44:09,104
seem to be lacking.

515
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:12,399
He didn't have any acquaintances
who joined him.

516
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:16,028
Yes, Your Honor, so I've submitted
the affidavit of the bartender

517
00:44:16,111 --> 00:44:19,031
that he finished drinking at 9 p.m.
and his credit card statement.

518
00:44:19,531 --> 00:44:20,532
I see.

519
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:25,704
Do you have evidence
to prove it was a justifiable act?

520
00:44:26,121 --> 00:44:27,122
Well.

521
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:32,127
Unfortunately, due to the malfunction
of the dash cam,

522
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:34,630
we don't have any proof.

523
00:44:34,713 --> 00:44:37,216
However, we are looking
for an eyewitness of the incident.

524
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:40,094
I understand.

525
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:42,388
I have a bad feeling about this.

526
00:44:42,471 --> 00:44:43,472
-Prosecution.
-So do I.

527
00:44:43,555 --> 00:44:44,807
Proceed with your sentencing.

528
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:50,229
Please punish the defendant with
a fine of 3 million won.

529
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:53,273
Lastly, does the defendant have...

530
00:44:53,899 --> 00:44:55,442
any last words he'd like to say?

531
00:44:55,984 --> 00:44:57,027
Yes, Your Honor.

532
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:03,492
I agree that drinking and driving

533
00:45:03,992 --> 00:45:07,204
is a very wrong thing to do.

534
00:45:07,579 --> 00:45:09,790
Therefore, I deeply regret
what I have done.

535
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:13,043
However, it is true

536
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:16,547
that I only had two glasses of beer.

537
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:21,677
And I only drove out of the
good will to save a person's life.

538
00:45:22,302 --> 00:45:25,222
Please take that into consideration.
Thank you.

539
00:45:29,143 --> 00:45:30,602
Here is the verdict.

540
00:45:32,187 --> 00:45:35,691
The defendant will have to pay
a fine of 3 million won.

541
00:45:36,191 --> 00:45:39,945
If the defendant refuses to pay the fine,

542
00:45:40,028 --> 00:45:42,990
every 100,000 won will be
converted into one day,

543
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:46,076
and thus, he will be imprisoned
in a workhouse for 30 days.

544
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,369
What did you say?

545
00:45:51,498 --> 00:45:53,500
Hey, Ms. Lack of Evidence!

546
00:45:55,210 --> 00:45:57,254
You used me like a slave.

547
00:45:57,337 --> 00:45:58,881
And you lost?

548
00:45:59,131 --> 00:46:00,841
You little... Stop right there.

549
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:02,009
Hey!

550
00:46:02,509 --> 00:46:03,719
Gosh, he's really angry.

551
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:06,513
Bong-hui took it too far.

552
00:46:07,556 --> 00:46:09,600
She could've won
if it was a different judge.

553
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:14,229
Ji-hae, I'm sure you already know that

554
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:15,939
I'm quite pretty.

555
00:46:17,691 --> 00:46:18,692
Yes.

556
00:46:19,067 --> 00:46:20,777
That's what I thought
when we weren't so close.

557
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:21,862
What?

558
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:23,280
Never mind.

559
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:29,411
But you see, Ji-uk and Eun-hyeok
were also really handsome.

560
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,163
I see.

561
00:46:31,246 --> 00:46:34,500
I used to feel proud when the three of us
hung out together.

562
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:37,044
People used to stare at us.

563
00:46:37,169 --> 00:46:38,712
Oh, I see.

564
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:41,215
But...

565
00:46:42,382 --> 00:46:44,218
I hurt them both

566
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:45,719
and abandoned them.

567
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:49,640
I must've been crazy.

568
00:46:50,432 --> 00:46:52,476
That's what happens when you have it all.

569
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:55,103
I can't argue with you
because you're right.

570
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,693
Right now,

571
00:47:01,818 --> 00:47:03,862
she must be the one who has it all.

572
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:14,790
You'll only embarrass yourself
if you go out right now.

573
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:16,875
You'll regret it tomorrow.

574
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:19,169
Let go.

575
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:25,509
Gosh, this is so embarrassing.

576
00:47:27,803 --> 00:47:28,929
Hey, you guys.

577
00:47:32,474 --> 00:47:33,392
Ms. Cha?

578
00:47:33,475 --> 00:47:35,435
Don't even talk to me.

579
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:41,567
You guys...

580
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:43,527
You guys are so...

581
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:49,408
Let's go.

582
00:48:09,678 --> 00:48:11,597
She looked really drunk.
Don't you think so?

583
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,181
You don't need to worry.

584
00:48:13,265 --> 00:48:16,602
He's right. She wasn't that drunk.
She has a high alcohol tolerance.

585
00:48:16,685 --> 00:48:19,354
-She can drink for a couple more hours.
-Of course.

586
00:48:24,818 --> 00:48:27,654
Well, what I meant was that...

587
00:48:28,947 --> 00:48:30,616
you don't need to worry about her
too much.

588
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:33,952
That's what I was trying to tell you.

589
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:35,829
He's right. That was the point.

590
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:37,372
He meant nothing else.

591
00:48:37,706 --> 00:48:38,707
I didn't say anything.

592
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:43,295
I was just thinking of hitting
back of her head if she was drunk

593
00:48:43,378 --> 00:48:45,255
because she always glares at me.

594
00:48:55,474 --> 00:48:56,558
Will you be okay?

595
00:48:58,352 --> 00:48:59,478
Go home safely, Yu-jeong.

596
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:00,854
Okay, bye.

597
00:50:11,049 --> 00:50:13,719
It's hard to track where Go Chan-ho
went on the day he disappeared.

598
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:16,263
I'm still checking the dash cams
of the cars

599
00:50:16,346 --> 00:50:18,181
that were parked in the alley
outside of his house.

600
00:50:18,557 --> 00:50:21,435
But there are a few blind spots,
and it's not clear since it was dark.

601
00:50:21,643 --> 00:50:22,936
Oh, I see.

602
00:50:23,895 --> 00:50:25,021
Then

603
00:50:25,397 --> 00:50:29,067
did you look into the people
in this photo?

604
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:32,028
I've started to go through
Go Chan-ho's alumni.

605
00:50:36,408 --> 00:50:37,701
I know...

606
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:39,536
who bought you the shoes.

607
00:50:40,954 --> 00:50:43,707
That's exactly what Go Chan-ho said
to Bong-hui.

608
00:50:44,374 --> 00:50:45,375
Then...

609
00:50:45,917 --> 00:50:47,836
do you think the person
who bought the shoes

610
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:49,755
is in this photo?

611
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:52,090
Or is it Jung Hyeon-su?

612
00:50:54,259 --> 00:50:55,260
Ji-uk.

613
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:56,595
Come over here and look at this.

614
00:51:00,766 --> 00:51:01,725
This just in.

615
00:51:01,808 --> 00:51:05,103
The murder weapon presumably
used to kill Chef Yang

616
00:51:05,187 --> 00:51:09,107
was found last night in a car
parked on a roadside in Chuncheon,

617
00:51:09,357 --> 00:51:11,902
The assumed culprit is Mr. Go,

618
00:51:11,985 --> 00:51:15,614
and it's more shocking
because he used to work in forensics.

619
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:19,034
It seems like he ran away
after abandoning the car

620
00:51:19,117 --> 00:51:20,660
on a remote roadside
along with the weapon.

621
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:23,914
Meanwhile, the fact that
Mr. Go was in charge of the

622
00:51:23,997 --> 00:51:26,166
forensic examination of the scene

623
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:28,502
will shock the public even more.

624
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:32,923
The police say they will do their best
to find and arrest Mr. Go.

625
00:51:33,006 --> 00:51:35,091
The police of Goyang and Chuncheon
are back-tracking

626
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:37,761
the route that Mr. Go used.

627
00:51:37,844 --> 00:51:40,055
They're doing their best
to track his whereabouts.

628
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:41,473
Ms. Eun, you're here.

629
00:51:42,182 --> 00:51:43,475
Have you been well?

630
00:51:43,558 --> 00:51:44,559
Yes, of course.

631
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:55,946
What's with you two?

632
00:51:57,072 --> 00:51:58,740
Is there something I don't know about?

633
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:03,078
Hey, guys.

634
00:52:04,496 --> 00:52:08,041
Where's Ms. Lack of Evidence,
the girl who lost

635
00:52:08,166 --> 00:52:09,251
my case?

636
00:52:10,126 --> 00:52:12,963
She's been slipping out
whenever she has the chance.

637
00:52:13,088 --> 00:52:15,006
I haven't been able to see her
for a while now.

638
00:52:15,423 --> 00:52:17,676
I miss her so dearly.

639
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:20,762
I guess she's not here.

640
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:23,723
Where did she escape to?

641
00:52:24,057 --> 00:52:25,058
My goodness.

642
00:52:25,934 --> 00:52:26,935
Goodness.

643
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:28,103
What?

644
00:52:28,770 --> 00:52:31,022
Where is Bong-hui, really?

645
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:36,653
What is it that you want to tell me?

646
00:52:37,529 --> 00:52:38,572
Well...

647
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:43,618
I actually lied to you about something.

648
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:45,704
You lied to me?

649
00:52:46,037 --> 00:52:46,997
Yes.

650
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:50,417
My alibi.

651
00:52:54,045 --> 00:52:55,755
To be honest,

652
00:52:56,590 --> 00:53:00,010
I couldn't remember exactly
where I was and what I did that day.

653
00:53:00,093 --> 00:53:04,806
But if I didn't tell you
my whereabouts in detail,

654
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:08,101
I felt like you wouldn't believe me. So...

655
00:53:09,644 --> 00:53:10,812
I lied to you.

656
00:53:12,147 --> 00:53:13,481
May I ask

657
00:53:14,274 --> 00:53:16,318
why you're telling me this right now?

658
00:53:20,113 --> 00:53:24,659
When everyone in the world attacked me
and called me a murderer,

659
00:53:25,577 --> 00:53:28,163
you're the only person
who believed in what I said.

660
00:53:29,247 --> 00:53:32,751
I'm telling you this
because I want to be truthful to you.

661
00:53:34,836 --> 00:53:35,712
I'm sorry.

662
00:53:35,795 --> 00:53:38,048
What about Jung Hyeon-su?
What are you looking into?

663
00:53:38,715 --> 00:53:39,716
Well...

664
00:53:41,968 --> 00:53:43,637
You don't need to know about it yet.

665
00:53:45,263 --> 00:53:48,141
What is it? Why are you saying
I don't need to know it yet?

666
00:53:48,266 --> 00:53:51,269
I just feel a little suspicious.
That's all.

667
00:53:53,021 --> 00:53:54,022
Thank you

668
00:53:54,397 --> 00:53:56,232
for being honest with me.

669
00:54:08,328 --> 00:54:09,704
I can go by myself.

670
00:54:09,829 --> 00:54:11,206
I'll escort you to your car.

671
00:54:12,165 --> 00:54:13,166
Okay, then.

672
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:17,379
Sir!

673
00:54:18,338 --> 00:54:19,714
Hey, long time no see.

674
00:54:20,006 --> 00:54:21,132
How have you been?

675
00:54:21,216 --> 00:54:23,593
Good. By the way,
I was planning to call you.

676
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:24,803
Really?

677
00:54:25,136 --> 00:54:27,722
Yes. Until when do you plan to
leave that banner up there?

678
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:29,099
It'll only cost you money.

679
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,142
For just a little bit more.

680
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:34,521
I think that's fine.

681
00:54:34,646 --> 00:54:36,898
Thank you for helping me.
I finished it quickly thanks to you.

682
00:54:38,733 --> 00:54:40,652
Are you the witness by any chance?

683
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:41,903
Are you calling the police?

684
00:54:45,323 --> 00:54:46,866
Thanks anyway.

685
00:54:48,994 --> 00:54:51,329
-Didn't you get the report?
-A report?

686
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:54,749
Yes, someone said he'd report something.

687
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:56,584
Who? Who said that?

688
00:54:56,668 --> 00:54:58,253
I don't know who he is.

689
00:54:58,545 --> 00:55:01,006
It was a young man.

690
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:03,675
When was it?

691
00:55:03,883 --> 00:55:05,427
Was it at the beginning of this spring?

692
00:55:05,677 --> 00:55:07,220
I saw him while switching the banners.

693
00:55:08,221 --> 00:55:10,682
Was it before he sent me the shoes?

694
00:55:11,391 --> 00:55:14,644
By any chance, do you remember
what he looked like?

695
00:55:14,853 --> 00:55:17,313
Anything will help.
Do you remember anything?

696
00:55:17,397 --> 00:55:18,815
I'm not sure.

697
00:55:19,232 --> 00:55:21,818
It's not easy to remember
someone whom you met just once.

698
00:55:22,068 --> 00:55:24,070
I don't even remember
what I had for breakfast today.

699
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:26,239
Then I should test him.

700
00:55:32,454 --> 00:55:33,455
Let's see if he...

701
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:36,791
remembers me or not.

702
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:39,127
If he remembers me...

703
00:55:39,627 --> 00:55:40,712
Is he a friend of yours?

704
00:55:45,383 --> 00:55:46,551
No, no.

705
00:55:47,093 --> 00:55:48,136
Excuse me for a second.

706
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:53,183
Yes, Mr. Noh.

707
00:55:55,518 --> 00:55:57,854
I'm with Hyeon-su now.

708
00:55:58,646 --> 00:56:00,315
Well... If that's the case,

709
00:56:01,441 --> 00:56:02,484
bring him here.

710
00:56:03,443 --> 00:56:06,446
We now know the real culprit anyway.
We should have dinner with him.

711
00:56:07,822 --> 00:56:08,823
All right.

712
00:56:09,365 --> 00:56:12,118
Don't make any stops.
Come here right away.

713
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:14,287
Okay, I will.

714
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:19,959
Mr. Noh. is saying
we should have dinner together.

715
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:21,753
Oh, really?

716
00:56:22,128 --> 00:56:23,546
Sure, let's do that.

717
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:28,134
Sir, please give me a call
if you remember anything.

718
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:30,136
I'll be in touch too. I'll see you soon.

719
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:31,262
All right.

720
00:56:32,847 --> 00:56:34,390
-Have a good day.
-You too. Bye.

721
00:56:52,575 --> 00:56:55,453
CASE REPORT
ON THE 2015 MURDER OF JANG HUI-JUN

722
00:57:03,378 --> 00:57:05,088
I think that the chief's speculation

723
00:57:05,171 --> 00:57:07,924
is actually quite plausible.

724
00:57:08,466 --> 00:57:11,511
Even before they met as a mentor
and a probationary officer,

725
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:15,014
there was something
between Noh Ji-uk and Bong-hui.

726
00:57:16,141 --> 00:57:18,768
I heard they were spotted
meeting at a hotel as well.

727
00:57:19,394 --> 00:57:22,021
There were bad rumors about her. And...

728
00:57:23,148 --> 00:57:25,567
"you're dirty, but you're so pretty."

729
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:28,903
He used to make such
affectionate remarks too.

730
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:30,613
He did?

731
00:57:31,698 --> 00:57:34,284
Then Bong-hui became a murder suspect.

732
00:57:35,702 --> 00:57:38,538
He might have been willing to do anything
to get her acquitted.

733
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:51,468
-We're here.
-Welcome.

734
00:57:51,759 --> 00:57:54,012
-Hello, have you been well?
-Of course.

735
00:57:54,596 --> 00:57:56,514
-Please make yourself at home.
-All right.

736
00:57:58,558 --> 00:58:00,351
-Hello.
-Oh, hello.

737
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:04,147
Can I give you a hand with it?

738
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:06,357
Why? Are you skilled with knives?

739
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:08,067
Gosh, what are you talking about?

740
00:58:09,068 --> 00:58:11,905
You're our guest.
Please make yourself at home.

741
00:58:17,368 --> 00:58:19,078
What's the matter?

742
00:58:20,371 --> 00:58:22,040
-What is it?
-Why didn't you tell me?

743
00:58:22,248 --> 00:58:23,791
-What?
-Jung Hyeon-su...

744
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:27,629
About Hyeon-su. Why didn't you tell me?

745
00:58:28,087 --> 00:58:30,590
Oh, well... That's...

746
00:58:31,049 --> 00:58:32,091
That was because...

747
00:58:33,384 --> 00:58:35,470
Nothing was really confirmed, so--

748
00:58:35,553 --> 00:58:37,514
Something seems off about him,
and he did lie.

749
00:58:38,056 --> 00:58:39,432
You were sure about those things.

750
00:58:40,391 --> 00:58:41,476
Yes, you're right.

751
00:58:42,977 --> 00:58:45,063
Did you want me
to feel like an idiot or what?

752
00:58:45,605 --> 00:58:46,814
I'm so disappointed in you.

753
00:58:46,898 --> 00:58:49,359
Gosh, it's not like that.
That's really not what I intended.

754
00:58:49,484 --> 00:58:53,613
You see, there wasn't really
anything concrete I could tell you.

755
00:58:53,863 --> 00:58:57,325
I was worried
you might beat yourself up like crazy.

756
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:59,369
You kept what I should know from me.

757
00:58:59,452 --> 00:59:01,454
Did you really think
you were doing it for my sake?

758
00:59:03,873 --> 00:59:05,583
I'm sorry. I made a mistake.

759
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:08,169
Yes, you did.

760
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:10,463
Just a second. How...

761
00:59:11,923 --> 00:59:12,924
How did you know?

762
00:59:14,968 --> 00:59:16,803
Hyeon-su beat you to it.

763
00:59:16,886 --> 00:59:18,555
He told me that he lied about his alibi.

764
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:23,851
He beat us to it?

765
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:28,064
All right.

766
00:59:29,148 --> 00:59:32,485
Then what's your thought on him?

767
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:35,405
I don't know. I'll say I'm neutral.

768
00:59:36,739 --> 00:59:38,283
But what's bothering me is...

769
00:59:39,492 --> 00:59:43,162
the fact that there must be a reason
you're suspicious of him.

770
00:59:48,918 --> 00:59:49,919
All right.

771
01:00:03,308 --> 01:00:04,309
Hey.

772
01:00:05,143 --> 01:00:06,561
Is there anything I can help you with?

773
01:00:06,978 --> 01:00:08,021
No.

774
01:00:09,564 --> 01:00:11,024
Just go plate the food.

775
01:00:11,899 --> 01:00:13,443
-That's fine too.
-Yes.

776
01:00:25,788 --> 01:00:27,582
Now, we have another guest.

777
01:00:27,915 --> 01:00:29,334
I'm here for work.

778
01:00:30,585 --> 01:00:31,711
Don't look at me like that.

779
01:00:36,507 --> 01:00:38,051
-My gosh.
-Oh, my.

780
01:00:39,802 --> 01:00:42,680
What do you say? How's the food?

781
01:00:42,930 --> 01:00:44,390
Everything looks so delicious.

782
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:47,852
-I'm glad to hear that.
-I'm good with everything,

783
01:00:47,935 --> 01:00:49,437
but putting tomatoes in bulgogi is...

784
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:50,730
Then don't eat it.

785
01:00:50,813 --> 01:00:51,814
Thank you for the food.

786
01:00:51,898 --> 01:00:53,358
You're welcome. I hope you all enjoy it.

787
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:02,575
Oh, about the forensic officer,
Go Chan-ho...

788
01:01:03,076 --> 01:01:05,662
Do you know that he's now being chased
by the police

789
01:01:05,745 --> 01:01:07,372
as the suspect
of the murder of Yang Jin-wu?

790
01:01:08,247 --> 01:01:09,207
Yes, I saw it on the news.

791
01:01:09,290 --> 01:01:10,708
I see, you saw it.

792
01:01:10,958 --> 01:01:12,543
You don't know him personally, do you?

793
01:01:13,169 --> 01:01:14,128
No, not at all.

794
01:01:14,212 --> 01:01:16,506
I was so surprised to hear
that the killer is a police officer.

795
01:01:19,467 --> 01:01:20,468
Congratulations.

796
01:01:20,885 --> 01:01:23,137
Those who are
acquitted for lack of evidence

797
01:01:23,221 --> 01:01:25,515
continue to look or get treated
like culprits

798
01:01:25,848 --> 01:01:28,476
in the absence of other suspects
or real culprits.

799
01:01:30,937 --> 01:01:32,230
Please don't worry.

800
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:35,024
The prosecution hasn't been able
to catch the real killer...

801
01:01:35,858 --> 01:01:37,985
but I'll be sure to catch him
and bring him to you.

802
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:53,126
I came here to tell you this.

803
01:01:53,543 --> 01:01:58,631
Bong-hui, I'll be reinvestigating
your ex-boyfriend Jang Hui-jun's case.

804
01:01:59,882 --> 01:02:02,176
I'm not sure if I could find anything now,

805
01:02:02,343 --> 01:02:03,720
but I'll try to dig things up.

806
01:02:04,595 --> 01:02:08,015
From the crime scene to anyone involved,
I'll go through them all.

807
01:02:10,143 --> 01:02:13,604
The killer might be
in this house right now.

808
01:02:19,318 --> 01:02:21,320
Anyhow, what do you think
is going on with Go Chan-ho?

809
01:02:21,988 --> 01:02:23,239
Would he really be on the run?

810
01:02:26,534 --> 01:02:29,203
I'm not sure. I'm really curious too.

811
01:02:56,564 --> 01:02:59,567
We should try to sound out Jung Hyeon-su.
That's the only thing we can do now.

812
01:02:59,650 --> 01:03:01,611
Don't you think the house feels so empty,

813
01:03:01,694 --> 01:03:03,112
now that everyone is gone?

814
01:03:03,196 --> 01:03:05,072
Not really. I like how quiet it is.

815
01:03:05,156 --> 01:03:07,700
Mr. Ji, my husband died.

816
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:08,785
What happened?

817
01:03:08,868 --> 01:03:10,411
Please rethink your decision
just once more.

818
01:03:10,495 --> 01:03:12,330
Hey, Eun-hyeok. Aren't you
hiding something from me?

819
01:03:12,413 --> 01:03:14,582
I'm going to give my client
whatever she wants!

820
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:16,334
Will you be able to handle
the consequences?

821
01:03:17,418 --> 01:03:19,420
