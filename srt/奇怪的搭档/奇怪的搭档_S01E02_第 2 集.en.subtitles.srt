1
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:35,160
To Prosecutor Noh Ji-uk.

2
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,959
In the last two months,
I have learned a lot from you.

3
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:45,420
I learned the living spirit of the law.

4
00:00:45,503 --> 00:00:49,758
You gave me practical wisdom and courage
to fulfill that spirit.

5
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,093
Who am I trying to kid?

6
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:54,888
There's a limit to how far I can lie.

7
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:57,599
This is beyond the limit. I went too far.

8
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:08,485
NOH JI-UK

9
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:14,157
NOH JI-UK WAS ANNOYING TODAY
AS ALWAYS

10
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:18,995
That's right. He is annoying.

11
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,999
He's incredibly annoying.

12
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:28,546
Singing a song of curse
is not how you take revenge on your ex.

13
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:32,300
Just ignore him.

14
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:35,428
Be cool and live a good life.

15
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:40,266
But he is cool.

16
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:48,191
Oh, my goodness. I must have gone insane.

17
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:50,151
I wrote that he's cool.

18
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:33,278
What is this? Why can't I remember
what happened next?

19
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:34,904
Why can't I remember?

20
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,703
Gosh, it's hot. It's hot in here.

21
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,126
I'm getting hot.

22
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:50,587
There is always a cause and effect
in every event.

23
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:53,506
It's a known truth to everyone,
but the problem is...

24
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:57,302
I'm hot.

25
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:05,059
Gosh, this is refreshing.

26
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:06,603
The problem is,

27
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:09,314
sometimes we can't find the cause.

28
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:32,712
Something is definitely happening,

29
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,677
but we can't ever find out
the reason why it is happening.

30
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:00,657
Just like how I can't find it out now.

31
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:10,291
Is she sleeping already?

32
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:18,466
I knew it, Bong-hui.
You didn't change the passcode.

33
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:21,594
You may deny your feelings,
but you can't help but wait for me.

34
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:27,785
Beer.

35
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:29,912
Beer.

36
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:34,459
Gosh!

37
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:18,795
An effect happened upon me,
but I don't know the cause of it.

38
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:28,638
It's an unlucky, harsh,
and sudden accident.

39
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:32,725
-Let go of him!
-Be quiet!

40
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:35,394
-Let go!
-You are going to regret this.

41
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:38,689
All right. Ms. Eun Bong-hui,
let's go over this.

42
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,943
Even if it was really dark
because of the blackout,

43
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:43,820
you still went out to buy beer.

44
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:53,746
If you don't pull yourself together
now, you might get in trouble.

45
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:56,582
If there was an accident,
clean up afterwards.

46
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,042
The initial response is important.

47
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:01,254
Get a grip.

48
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:11,055
Hey.

49
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:20,565
I am a suspect, not a witness
right now, aren't I?

50
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:24,068
Well, let's investigate
without any presumptions.

51
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:25,736
I don't want to draw any lines now.

52
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:28,614
I understand, detectives.

53
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:31,742
Usually, the suspect is
someone close to the victim,

54
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:33,995
or the person who discovered the body.

55
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,790
Plus the place where it happened
and the condition I am in now.

56
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:39,292
I may look like a suspect.

57
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:40,376
You just admitted.

58
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,462
I said "may."

59
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:46,549
Please listen to me carefully.

60
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:48,885
If you pinpoint an innocent person
as the suspect,

61
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,887
the initial investigation
will be a total mess.

62
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,973
The real suspect is someone else
and you have to find that person,

63
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:56,017
but if you focus on an innocent person
like me,

64
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,768
what will happen to the real suspect?

65
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:02,899
The suspect will disappear. You will
lose the evidence and witnesses.

66
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,066
Let go. Move aside.

67
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:07,278
You have finally done it.

68
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:08,529
Who are you? Who...

69
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:12,158
Are you the last person
who talked with Mr. Jang Hui-jun?

70
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:13,326
Why did you kill him?

71
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:16,996
Hey, I didn't.

72
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:19,207
All right. Hui-jun did dump you.

73
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:21,918
-Is that something to kill him for?
-It wasn't me.

74
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,504
You kept singing that you will kill him.

75
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:26,964
There are so many witnesses.
Should I call all our classmates?

76
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:31,135
I only said it. I didn't mean any of it.

77
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:33,554
Stop fooling yourself. Bring back Hui-jun.

78
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:35,223
Bring back Hui-jun, you bitch!

79
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:36,349
Don't do this.

80
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:37,892
-Let go of me.
-Let her go.

81
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:39,310
I'm going to kill her.

82
00:08:39,393 --> 00:08:41,229
I'll kill her!

83
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:46,192
I... I really didn't do it.

84
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:48,694
-Let go!
-It's really not me.

85
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:51,531
-I didn't do it. Please believe me.
-I'm going to kill you!

86
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:53,074
If...

87
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:57,745
I can give a spoiler about my life
to myself in the past,

88
00:08:57,828 --> 00:08:59,080
I'll tell her this.

89
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:01,791
"Bong-hui, be careful of men.

90
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,794
They will ruin your life."

91
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:06,837
What do I have to be careful of?

92
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:07,922
Women.

93
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:12,385
When a man meets the wrong woman
and vice versa,

94
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:15,680
his life can be doomed in one blow.

95
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:18,516
But from what I can see,

96
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:21,727
there's one person like that in your fate.

97
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:24,313
You'll get in huge trouble
if you cross paths with her.

98
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:27,650
That woman will completely destroy
your life.

99
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:29,527
Who's that woman?

100
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:36,701
You had your eyes closed
for exactly 17 minutes.

101
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:41,455
You're fighting a war against insomnia,
not against crimes.

102
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:46,127
If someone can help me get a sound sleep,

103
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:49,755
I'd be willing to give my body
and soul to that person.

104
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,925
I heard you can get insomnia
when your bed is too big.

105
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:56,304
You might sleep like a baby
when you meet a nice woman.

106
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:59,807
Don't even. I had a dream about a woman
I shouldn't cross paths with.

107
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:01,642
A woman you shouldn't cross paths with?

108
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:02,727
Yes.

109
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:06,814
When I was a kid, there was
a fake monk in my neighborhood.

110
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:09,984
He told me something ridiculous.

111
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:12,820
I had forgotten all about it,
but he showed up in my dream.

112
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:16,282
What did he say? There was
this woman I shouldn't meet...

113
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:17,658
EUN BONG-HUI

114
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:20,786
-Bong-hui?
-Is Bong-hui that woman?

115
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,413
Did he predict it when you were a kid?

116
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:24,624
Why is she calling at this hour?

117
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:27,668
Hey.

118
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:34,258
Well... Mr. Noh.

119
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,677
What is it? Make it quick.
Just get to the point.

120
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:40,848
I've been arrested without a warrant.

121
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:41,974
You've been arrested?

122
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,018
How much did you drink?

123
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:45,519
I didn't drink at all.

124
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:48,356
Yet you got arrested without a warrant?
What did you do? Assault?

125
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:49,690
-No.
-Theft?

126
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:51,275
-No way.
-Public indecency?

127
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:54,278
-Of course not.
-Then what on earth is it?

128
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:58,032
It's murder.

129
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,084
Goodness.

130
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:12,505
Mur...

131
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:33,776
What should I do?

132
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:13,774
Isn't he District Attorney Jang Mu-yeong?

133
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:16,360
-Pardon?
-The district attorney of Seonho.

134
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:19,196
I heard they've arrested a suspect.

135
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:23,325
Hey, Bong-hui. You're really...

136
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:26,245
What on earth were you thinking...

137
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:29,540
Come here. Hey!

138
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,918
You're so dead. You little...

139
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,257
I think...

140
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:40,551
I got myself in trouble, but...

141
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:43,596
You think? You think you did something?

142
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:48,684
Something must've gone wrong.
I know that much,

143
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,644
but I don't know what I did wrong.

144
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:52,313
I really have no idea.

145
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:54,064
Look up.

146
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:55,608
I don't want to, why?

147
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:58,194
Let me see your shameless face.
Look at me.

148
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:14,960
I never meant for this to happen,

149
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:16,879
but it did happen.

150
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:19,131
So let's say that much is my fault.

151
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:23,886
However, all I did was step out
to pick up beer because I was thirsty.

152
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:26,972
When I got back,
everything had already happened.

153
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:31,060
I have no idea
what would ever lead to this.

154
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:33,812
I can't believe it, and I'm terrified.

155
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,982
But you're the only person I can count on.

156
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:38,484
Why would you count on me? Don't.

157
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:39,610
I will.

158
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:41,987
I will count on you.

159
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:44,990
You're the only person I know...

160
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,660
who knows the law and has power.

161
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:55,376
Hey, take those clothes off first.

162
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:56,460
Pardon me?

163
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:01,924
I'm saying you should wash up.

164
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:04,552
Those clothes should be submitted
as evidence.

165
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,012
Mr. Bang will bring you
a change of clothes.

166
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:10,641
Just wash that off yourself first.

167
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:45,843
That's when it finally hit me.

168
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,388
Hui-jun is dead.

169
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:08,198
Yes, I liked you a lot.

170
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,328
Even though you betrayed me,

171
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:15,456
dumped me, and hurt me,

172
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:19,209
I never actually wished you wrong.

173
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:21,086
Please...

174
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:23,047
rest in peace.

175
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:25,841
I pray for you with all my heart.

176
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:29,720
Praying is one thing,

177
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:33,015
but why did you have to die at my place?

178
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,809
Out of all the places
in this whole wide world,

179
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,187
why did you have to die at my place?

180
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,439
Are you trying to mess up my life?

181
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:43,317
What have I done to you
to deserve this? You jerk.

182
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,903
I'm sorry I swore at you.

183
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:51,742
Why did you...

184
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:54,787
You shouldn't have died.

185
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,500
Why did you die?

186
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:05,005
I really wish you didn't die...

187
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:09,218
Next news. Everyone is shocked
by the murder of a trainee

188
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:13,472
from the Judicial Research
and Training Institute.

189
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:16,558
The fact that the victim
is the son of a district attorney...

190
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,268
has caused a big stir.

191
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:21,563
The prime suspect, Ms. Eun,
who has been arrested

192
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:24,733
could not accept the fact
that the victim broke up with her.

193
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,611
She's been stalking and threatening him
on a daily basis. The victim...

194
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:33,033
This is the prosecutors' office.

195
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:36,078
Pardon me?

196
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:38,288
The chief's office?

197
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:42,668
Ominous premonitions are usually right.

198
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:46,046
The fact that attorneys named him
as the worst prosecutor

199
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:49,133
means that suspects and their counsels
hate him.

200
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:52,302
In other words,
he's always in support of the victims.

201
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,054
Yes, that's right.

202
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:56,807
When it comes to criminal cases,
Mr. Noh is the best prosecutor.

203
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,434
He's the best at dragging out confessions,

204
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,811
and he has the highest conviction rate.

205
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:05,232
Please investigate fairly...

206
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:08,402
and prove that justice is still alive.

207
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:12,531
This is the worst possible situation
I could imagine.

208
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:20,330
-There she is.
-She's coming out.

209
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:22,207
-She's getting off.
-Take photos.

210
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,918
-She's coming out.
-Take photos!

211
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:28,338
-She's out.
-Why did you kill him?

212
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:30,090
Was it planned or accidental?

213
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:31,842
Do you admit it?

214
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:34,261
You should at least say
whether you killed him or not!

215
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:36,138
Did you kill him because he dumped you?

216
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:37,639
Please move your hair out of your face.

217
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:42,895
-We can see her face now!
-Take off your mask!

218
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:44,146
Take it off!

219
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:45,647
Please say a few words!

220
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:48,233
-Did you kill him or not?
-Hey, take photos now!

221
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,515
I'm pretty sure I told you...

222
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:22,476
not to show up before me as a suspect.

223
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:23,560
I...

224
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:26,438
I'm a ruthless prosecutor.

225
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:31,068
Let's get started.

226
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:36,657
You're currently being investigated
for the murder of Jang Hui-jun.

227
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:39,034
You have the right to remain silent...

228
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,078
to any question that might be
be used against you.

229
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,622
Get her to confess and charge her.

230
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:47,251
If you fail to charge her
and get the maximum penalty,

231
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:50,254
you'll be fired, and won't be able to work
even as an attorney.

232
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:53,715
Even if you get lucky, you'll end up
in some far away countryside.

233
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:54,800
Do you understand?

234
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:58,929
Do you admit that
all circumstances point to you

235
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:00,097
as the culprit?

236
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:13,277
This is the statement of the part-timer
at the convenience store.

237
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:15,779
He remembers a customer
coming into the store that night,

238
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:19,366
but he can't remember that person's face.
He doesn't remember you.

239
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:20,492
Excuse me.

240
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:22,452
I can't hear you well.

241
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:29,459
There was a black out that night.
The CCTV was also out of order.

242
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:32,546
That means nothing can prove
you were outside

243
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:34,715
in the middle of the night.

244
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:36,633
Can you still not hear me?

245
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:40,470
To be exact, I can't see you.

246
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:41,763
What?

247
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:45,517
They won't let me wear
contact lenses, and some ass...

248
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:49,313
Some journalist broke my glasses
a while ago.

249
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:50,898
So I can't really see properly.

250
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:54,109
It's weird, but when I can't see,

251
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,153
I can't hear properly either.

252
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:58,363
Probably because
I can't see your facial expressions.

253
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:01,700
It makes it hard for me
to figure out how you're feeling...

254
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:04,453
-or what you're thinking.
-So what?

255
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:15,797
You see, I can totally understand
your situation right now.

256
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:19,176
I also know that Jang Hui-jun
was the one who cheated on you.

257
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:23,847
I totally understand how devastated
you must have felt that night.

258
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,391
-So...
-It's not going to work on me.

259
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,895
I've seen you interrogate people
many times.

260
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:32,648
You're trying to appease me
by sweet-talking to me.

261
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:38,779
Other than the police and paramedics
who were at the site,

262
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:42,407
we couldn't find anyone else's DNA
at the crime scene.

263
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:45,285
There were only yours and Jang Hui-jun's.

264
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:46,370
That was all.

265
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:48,538
Are you still going to deny it?

266
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:50,624
This won't work on me either.

267
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:52,584
Exactly. Darn it.

268
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,546
You're going to get charged anyway.

269
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:58,799
The motive is clear,
and you have no alibi.

270
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:01,260
He got killed at your house,
and there's no other suspect.

271
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:02,594
That's enough to charge you.

272
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:05,305
But I really didn't kill him.

273
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:07,474
-That doesn't even matter.
-Pardon?

274
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:09,810
Whether you're guilty or not,
you're going to get

275
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:11,770
the maximum sentence allowed by law.

276
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:14,189
That's the only way I can save my career.

277
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:16,316
You believe me, don't you?

278
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:19,611
I trust that you believe me.

279
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:22,656
I trust that you're on my side.
You're the only hope...

280
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:24,491
I have right now.

281
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:30,622
But from what I can see, there's
one person like that in your fate.

282
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:33,041
You'll get in huge trouble
if you cross paths with her.

283
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:37,546
That woman will completely destroy
your life.

284
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:41,300
-I've become uncivilized.
-Sorry?

285
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:44,428
I said I've become uncivilized.

286
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:47,472
Because of you, I am about to believe
what that fake monk said.

287
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:48,849
Who's that woman?

288
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:51,059
You'll find out who she is
once you see her.

289
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:53,395
"So this must be her!"

290
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:55,105
He said I'll know when I see her.

291
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:57,941
Now I know I met her.

292
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:00,569
It's...

293
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,367
It's you, Bong-hui.

294
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,918
I'm sure I've seen her somewhere.

295
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:18,503
I've seen her in real life.

296
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:22,132
She looks extremely intimidating.

297
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,134
Really?

298
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:26,553
Yes. She's really something.

299
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:29,890
I wonder if she hired an attorney.

300
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:31,725
The victim is the son
of District Attorney Jang.

301
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:33,393
Who would want to defend her?

302
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:35,979
He'd get on the bad side
of the prosecution.

303
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:37,564
She'll get a public defender.

304
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:42,360
She'll get the most incompetent lawyer
in this country.

305
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:46,073
What's wrong?

306
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:47,365
Ji-uk...

307
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:49,493
Did something happen? What's up?

308
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:51,453
He's calling me.

309
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:52,579
MY JI-UK

310
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,247
So?

311
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:57,667
Ji-uk's calling me.
It's been ages since he called me.

312
00:22:58,376 --> 00:22:59,294
Wait.

313
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:05,842
Hello? Hey, Ji-uk.

314
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:07,344
Yes.

315
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:10,806
Please do me a favor. Okay.

316
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:18,105
I can't believe you called Mr. Ji
when you hate him so much.

317
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:20,899
My gosh! Bugs!

318
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:22,442
It feels like...

319
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,694
bugs are crawling all over my body.

320
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:34,246
Let's go.

321
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:42,921
Thank goodness, I didn't
throw these glasses away.

322
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:44,381
How did you find them?

323
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:47,634
It's not like they have legs.
I found them after a while.

324
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:50,846
I should've gotten you new glasses
that are pretty.

325
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:54,474
I'm only going to use them
for a while. It would've been a waste.

326
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:58,228
Of course. You'll get out of there soon.

327
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:02,440
Goodness.

328
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:06,194
By the way, these glasses
remind me of the past.

329
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:11,741
You studied so hard with those glasses on.

330
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:15,036
And you supported me
throughout the whole journey.

331
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:23,545
Don't you worry about me.

332
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:25,672
It's not even my first time.
Back when your dad...

333
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:31,553
How's the food? Is it okay?

334
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:35,098
Giving massages is tiring, isn't it?

335
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:41,479
Nonsense. Everyone lives a tough life
like I do.

336
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:46,818
Relief patches don't cost that much.
Why do you split them like that?

337
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:50,155
I can use them on different spots
by splitting them like this.

338
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:54,910
By the way, how are your cellmates?
Are they nice?

339
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:58,288
Are there any bullies?

340
00:24:58,705 --> 00:25:02,000
What are you talking about?
I'm the head of the cell.

341
00:25:02,542 --> 00:25:03,835
-Really?
-Yes.

342
00:25:04,544 --> 00:25:06,254
I'm the only one who got
charged with murder.

343
00:25:06,379 --> 00:25:08,548
Everyone else got charged
with theft, embezzlement,

344
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:10,592
fraud, and gambling.

345
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:13,803
But I got charged with murder,
so they're all scared of me.

346
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:17,224
That's great.

347
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:19,017
Your time's up.

348
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:25,607
Why does time fly so fast?

349
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:28,902
Mom, you don't need to
come tomorrow. Okay?

350
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:32,697
Don't worry about me,
and keep your head up high.

351
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:34,574
You can do it, Bong-hui.

352
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:37,494
I can do it. I'll be off then.

353
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:39,037
You should go.

354
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:44,751
Bye, Mom.

355
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:05,146
Why isn't she here yet?

356
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:13,571
My goodness. My gosh.

357
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:15,657
Are you okay?

358
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:18,743
You hit me again.

359
00:26:24,624 --> 00:26:25,834
I'm really sorry.

360
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:31,089
I'm really smart, so it's okay
if my brain cells die a little bit.

361
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:35,552
I see. Okay.

362
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:43,977
I got admitted as your attorney,

363
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:47,814
so the public defender appointment process
will be canceled.

364
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:51,318
I'm sorry.

365
00:26:52,485 --> 00:26:54,237
How... How did this happen?

366
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:58,033
Your glasses...

367
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:01,077
I'm not saying they look funny.

368
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:04,914
But they do seem to neutralize
your intimidating face.

369
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:07,667
It's great. It's a great tactic.

370
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:09,919
-Thank you.
-I should thank you.

371
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:12,088
Why would you thank me?

372
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:14,632
Thanks to you, Ji-uk called me.

373
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:15,967
Sorry?

374
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:17,886
What kind of relationship
do you have with Ji-uk?

375
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:21,306
He was my mentor, and now
he's the prosecutor in charge of my case.

376
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:23,975
No, not that. Is there anything else
in your relationship?

377
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:27,020
Sir, don't you have any questions for me?

378
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:28,104
I do.

379
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:30,607
Did you kill Jang Hui-jun?

380
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:31,941
No.

381
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:38,281
Now I know everything I need to know.

382
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:44,287
The CCTV's broken.

383
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:48,708
This place is under reconstruction,
so there are a lot of empty houses.

384
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:50,877
There was a black out that night.

385
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:56,257
I'm sorry, but this looks like
a great place to commit murder.

386
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:57,967
I don't know about that.

387
00:27:59,677 --> 00:28:03,139
But this place does seem suitable
for Bong-hui.

388
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:06,101
How's the weapon search going?

389
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:08,228
They scanned the whole place,
but nothing turned up yet.

390
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:10,021
What about the other jurisdictions?

391
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:12,357
I've called every police station
in Seoul and Gyeonggi Province.

392
00:28:12,732 --> 00:28:15,235
I asked them to report to us
if they find a weapon

393
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,653
13cm in length and 3.5cm in width.

394
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:18,738
-Okay, you did a good job.
-I did, right?

395
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:21,991
But why are you trying so hard?

396
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:23,952
I'm just open to possibilities.

397
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:27,372
Like Bong-hui said, someone else
could actually be the culprit.

398
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:28,790
By a slim chance, I mean.

399
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:30,834
It'd be great if that were true.

400
00:29:10,331 --> 00:29:12,959
Was it around 12:30 a.m.?

401
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:16,004
I looked out the window
because I was feeling a bit hot.

402
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:19,466
I couldn't see anything
because I wasn't wearing my glasses.

403
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:22,010
I just felt the cool breeze,
and that was it.

404
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:24,804
If she witnessed something,

405
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:29,267
but doesn't know what she saw...

406
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:33,021
That's why...

407
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:35,231
the witness...

408
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:42,572
This can't be.

409
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:47,285
Mr. Bang, you checked all the incidents

410
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:50,163
around this neighborhood
on that night, right?

411
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:51,247
Of course.

412
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:54,876
I looked into all the sex offenders
and ex-convicts around here.

413
00:29:56,252 --> 00:29:57,670
But I couldn't find anything.

414
00:29:57,754 --> 00:30:02,258
Can you check the residents' whereabouts
once more just in case?

415
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:03,218
Yes, sir.

416
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:29,035
Whoever the killer is,

417
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:31,913
he or she definitely entered the house
and stabbed the victim.

418
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,862
I think I might have seen her
from somewhere.

419
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:08,533
She has a typical face.

420
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:11,035
But this feels a bit uncomfortable.

421
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:14,038
Inspecting the house of someone we know
as a crime scene...

422
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:16,666
It makes me feel like I'm prying on her.

423
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:18,960
NOH JI-UK

424
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:22,589
NOH JI-UK WAS ANNOYING TODAY
AS ALWAYS

425
00:31:23,506 --> 00:31:24,549
What is that?

426
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:26,718
It's nothing.

427
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:32,307
Why are we shaking hands? We can do this!

428
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:46,154
I CAN DO IT

429
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:49,949
NOH JI-UK WAS ANNOYING TODAY
AS ALWAYS

430
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:51,659
It looks like...

431
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:52,577
BUT HE'S COOL

432
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:55,914
...she actually wanted to kill you
more than Jang Hui-jun.

433
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:05,757
Hello?

434
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:08,092
Yes, this is he.

435
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:10,887
Please go on.

436
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:13,431
Okay.

437
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:26,402
The murder weapon has been found.

438
00:32:28,404 --> 00:32:31,032
It was found in a place 7km far from here.

439
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:33,242
A passerby who was taking a walk
found it and reported.

440
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:36,454
What is this?

441
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:39,082
The length is 13cm and the width is 3.5cm.

442
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:42,251
The weapon fits the size
of the stab wound on Jang Hui-jun.

443
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,921
What?

444
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:47,632
It must look something like this.

445
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:50,551
That's...

446
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:54,681
Why isn't she indicted yet?

447
00:32:58,059 --> 00:32:59,727
A further investigation is necessary.

448
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:03,481
We currently have no direct evidence
like the murder weapon or witnesses.

449
00:33:03,606 --> 00:33:06,275
And she hasn't admitted to it yet either.

450
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:07,735
The murder weapon...

451
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:10,697
You might find it soon.

452
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:14,283
What needs to turn up always turns up.

453
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:19,706
As both of us know, what's important is
that Eun Bong-hui is the culprit.

454
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:21,332
Am I wrong?

455
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:27,130
This place was searched
multiple times, right?

456
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:29,007
We searched here so many times.

457
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:32,343
You have no idea how many times
we did it to find the murder weapon.

458
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:35,805
It wasn't found in all those times,
yet this ended up in my hand.

459
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:39,809
Plus, we might have found two.

460
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:41,269
Well, the other one...

461
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:43,855
Gosh, I have no idea
what's happening right now.

462
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,398
Let's go to the Forensic Center.

463
00:33:45,481 --> 00:33:47,025
CRIME LAB
IN THE SUPREME PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

464
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:49,193
I need to find out if the blood on these
are Jang Hui-jun's.

465
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:52,363
Please run an analysis as soon as possible
and keep it confidential.

466
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:54,282
-Confidential?
-Yes.

467
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:58,786
This was found on the scene, so
it doesn't have to be confidential.

468
00:33:58,870 --> 00:33:59,871
But this one over here.

469
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:04,250
It was found elsewhere,
so it must be kept confidential.

470
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:07,795
Mr. Ji, what's your IQ?

471
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:11,215
143. It's quite high.

472
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:12,300
Right.

473
00:34:15,344 --> 00:34:16,971
-Aren't you going to ask me?
-Sorry?

474
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:18,347
People usually reciprocate.

475
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:20,767
When someone says hello,
most people say it back.

476
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:21,893
Oh, right.

477
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:26,731
All right. My IQ is 143. What's yours?

478
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:27,857
It's 101.

479
00:34:30,693 --> 00:34:33,112
I passed the bar exam
with that IQ. Isn't it impressive?

480
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:35,698
Also, I used to be an aspiring athlete.

481
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:39,202
How much effort do you think
I had to make to pass the bar exam?

482
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:45,291
I asked myself every single day.
Should I just quit everything...

483
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:47,835
and earn money
so that I can help my family?

484
00:34:48,294 --> 00:34:50,213
I mean, I wasn't even confident
that I'd pass it.

485
00:34:51,714 --> 00:34:53,216
Studying was hard,

486
00:34:53,716 --> 00:34:56,344
but watching my mom having
to support me was even harder.

487
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,805
That's how I came this far,

488
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:02,642
but all the time and effort...

489
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:06,104
are about to go down the drain.

490
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:10,691
So please don't think
of defending me as a joke.

491
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:15,363
Or helping me out as a charity.

492
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:16,864
I don't want that mindset either.

493
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:19,867
My life depends on this,

494
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:23,412
and my family is also at stake.

495
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:29,127
Do we have to see each other?

496
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:33,714
Ji-uk?

497
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:35,383
How's Bong-hui? Have you met her?

498
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:36,884
I have.

499
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:42,473
Oh, and... The reason I asked you
to be her attorney is...

500
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:47,145
It was because her right
to consult with an attorney...

501
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:49,814
wasn't respected. That was why.

502
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:52,942
I know. I bet no attorney
wanted to help her.

503
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:55,319
I'm only doing this for you, you know?

504
00:35:55,444 --> 00:35:57,280
Do you have say that out loud?

505
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:01,701
I'll do my very best as her attorney.

506
00:36:01,784 --> 00:36:02,702
I never told you not to.

507
00:36:02,785 --> 00:36:04,370
I'm saying I'll beat you, Prosecutor Noh.

508
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:05,413
Bring it on.

509
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:08,416
You're not going to give in?
You want to convict her and lock her up?

510
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:10,543
What prosecutor prosecutes
just so he could lose?

511
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:13,296
I see.

512
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:16,549
I'm going if you're done talking.

513
00:36:16,632 --> 00:36:19,343
Hey, wait. Ji-uk!

514
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:21,220
Hey, just a second. Hey!

515
00:36:21,637 --> 00:36:23,806
Hey, you're not going to stay for coffee?

516
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:25,558
I guess you've forgotten.

517
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:28,436
I can't stand the sight of you
even for a second. You know that?

518
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,313
You still can't forgive me?

519
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:32,481
Darn it. That's right. It's too hard.

520
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:35,401
Then I'll beg you for forgiveness.
I'll keep begging.

521
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:37,862
I can't give up on you. You're
the most precious person in my life.

522
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:41,324
Ji-uk, you'll be at the trial, right?
Then I'll see you in court.

523
00:36:41,407 --> 00:36:44,035
See you again soon. Ji-uk, I love you!

524
00:36:53,836 --> 00:36:54,879
Goodness gracious.

525
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:57,298
Hey, Bong-hui. Because of you, I had to...

526
00:36:57,381 --> 00:37:00,343
I had to meet someone
that I never wanted to talk to again!

527
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:04,222
Did I do something wrong again?

528
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:06,474
Everything you do is wrong.
You're the epitome of wrongness.

529
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:07,808
I don't know what it's about,

530
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:10,102
but if I did something wrong
or made another mistake...

531
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:11,270
You are the mistake.

532
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:12,813
Your existence itself is a mistake!

533
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:26,410
What?

534
00:37:30,456 --> 00:37:32,291
Is there any progress?

535
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:33,292
Not really.

536
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:35,795
We haven't eaten yet,
so we were deciding on a menu.

537
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:43,427
Okay. So what did you choose to eat?

538
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:44,553
Jjajangmyeon.

539
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:47,848
Jjajangmyeon.

540
00:38:04,031 --> 00:38:07,785
If both knives have Jang Hui-jun's
blood on them...

541
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:08,911
Yes?

542
00:38:13,207 --> 00:38:14,500
That means...

543
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:17,753
Bong-hui is not the culprit.

544
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:24,593
This will be the last time...

545
00:38:25,886 --> 00:38:27,930
I interrogate you as the suspect.

546
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:36,188
That means you'll soon become
the defendant.

547
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:45,364
I trust you.

548
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:48,617
I trust that you believe me.

549
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:51,954
I really trust you.

550
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:55,416
That's the only choice I have right now.

551
00:38:56,917 --> 00:38:59,503
GOYANG DISTRICT COURT

552
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:26,655
I'm so nervous. What should I do?

553
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:40,044
Defendant Eun Bong-hui planned to murder
her ex-boyfriend,

554
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:43,547
Jang Hui-jun, after he broke up with her.

555
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:48,552
On May 11, 2015, she lured the victim,
Jang Hui-jun, to her place.

556
00:39:49,011 --> 00:39:51,889
Then she brutally murdered him
with a sharp knife.

557
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,559
For this, I indict defendant
Eun Bong-hui for murder...

558
00:39:56,185 --> 00:39:57,686
under Article 250 of the Criminal Code.

559
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:02,858
Attorney Ji, do you admit
to the charge made by the prosecution?

560
00:40:05,694 --> 00:40:08,572
No. I do not, Your Honor.

561
00:40:09,323 --> 00:40:12,368
Defendant Eun Bong-hui pleads not guilty.

562
00:40:15,287 --> 00:40:20,626
Have you witnessed the defendant
threatening the victim to kill him?

563
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:21,752
Yes.

564
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:26,674
I've numerously witnessed her doing so
with my own eyes and ears.

565
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:30,553
In addition, many classmates
also witnessed her threatening him.

566
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:35,224
That scumbag. That jerk.
I was going to dump him first.

567
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:42,606
I'm going to kill you, Hui-jun.

568
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:45,025
My gosh.

569
00:40:46,735 --> 00:40:48,529
-It's delicious.
-Yes, it is.

570
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:01,542
"I could die of hunger.
I'm so upset that I could die."

571
00:41:02,042 --> 00:41:03,502
A common expression, right?

572
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:06,630
Do you think everyone
who used that word actually died?

573
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:09,175
That goes the same for...

574
00:41:09,258 --> 00:41:11,135
"I'm going to kill you."

575
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:15,639
Bong-hui meant every single word she said.

576
00:41:16,056 --> 00:41:18,559
She wasn't just joking around.

577
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:22,188
In my opinion,
she became a potential murderer...

578
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:25,107
as soon as she said those threats.

579
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:33,949
I heard that you also said the same thing
at the police station.

580
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:34,992
Sorry?

581
00:41:35,117 --> 00:41:36,118
Let go!

582
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:37,661
I'm going to kill her.

583
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:40,289
I'm going to kill her!

584
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:43,292
-That was...
-You meant what you said.

585
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:44,668
You weren't joking, right?

586
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:49,715
Then does that also make you
a potential murderer?

587
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:56,138
She always sang a weird song
that showed...

588
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:58,265
a lot of hate and resentment.

589
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:01,644
She would sometimes change the lyrics.

590
00:42:02,102 --> 00:42:03,896
Could you give us an example?

591
00:42:03,979 --> 00:42:05,189
Right now?

592
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:06,649
I'll give it a try.

593
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:08,817
Five, six, seven, eight.

594
00:42:09,151 --> 00:42:12,780
Watch me cursing you

595
00:42:13,322 --> 00:42:15,157
You'd better remember

596
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:17,826
Because I'll be sure to kill you

597
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:18,911
That's all.

598
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:28,796
As soon as Eun Bong-hui
and Jang Hui-jun broke up,

599
00:42:29,129 --> 00:42:31,340
I heard that you asked Eun Bong-hui out.

600
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:34,927
Well, that was just a joke.

601
00:42:35,427 --> 00:42:38,347
Bong-hui, shall I go out with you?
What do you say?

602
00:42:38,764 --> 00:42:41,976
In total, you asked her out three times,

603
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:44,270
-and you got rejected every single time.
-Yes.

604
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:45,896
That's true, but...

605
00:42:47,147 --> 00:42:49,858
If you actually thought
she was capable of killing someone,

606
00:42:50,192 --> 00:42:52,027
do you think you would've asked her out?

607
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:58,534
By any chance, are you giving us
a false testimony

608
00:42:58,617 --> 00:43:00,119
because you have a grudge against her?

609
00:43:00,202 --> 00:43:01,245
No...

610
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:07,668
May I get a witness protection?

611
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:10,963
WITNESS

612
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:16,802
It is true that I sometimes
cursed and threatened the victim,

613
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:20,806
and said that I'd kill him.

614
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:26,145
But I only said those things
momentarily out of anger.

615
00:43:26,478 --> 00:43:28,314
I never really thought of killing him.

616
00:43:29,523 --> 00:43:32,276
If I had really planned to murder him,

617
00:43:32,401 --> 00:43:35,738
I wouldn't have told the whole world
about my plan, don't you think?

618
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:41,035
People don't put everything
in their mind to action.

619
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:44,622
To be honest, I'm pretty sure
a lot of women have wanted to kill

620
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:48,500
their boyfriends or husbands
at a certain point in their lives.

621
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:51,879
What?

622
00:44:09,229 --> 00:44:10,272
Am I wrong?

623
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:16,236
The trial hasn't ended yet.

624
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,697
Did you write that down?

625
00:44:18,781 --> 00:44:20,240
MURDER IS NO BIG DEAL?

626
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:22,409
MURDER OUT OF ANGER
GROTESQUE MURDER CASE

627
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:31,335
Today was the trial
of Eun Bong-hui's murder case.

628
00:44:31,418 --> 00:44:33,003
-What a wench.
-Tell us.

629
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:35,923
What did she say
to cause such controversy?

630
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:39,885
"To be honest, I'm pretty sure
a lot of women have wanted to kill

631
00:44:39,968 --> 00:44:42,179
their boyfriends or husbands
at a certain point in their lives."

632
00:44:42,262 --> 00:44:45,140
She sounded like a psychopath.

633
00:44:45,224 --> 00:44:47,643
What a brazen woman.

634
00:44:47,726 --> 00:44:49,687
My gosh. Every man in this country

635
00:44:49,812 --> 00:44:53,315
better behave around their wives
and girlfriends.

636
00:45:06,078 --> 00:45:07,287
Did you get anything?

637
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:09,915
Yes. Here are the results for the
murder weapon.

638
00:45:10,332 --> 00:45:11,417
Okay.

639

DNA ANALYSIS REPORT

641
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:52,791
She's here!

642
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:54,710
-Step back a little!
-Move!

643
00:45:54,793 --> 00:45:56,003
-Over there.
-She's there.

644
00:45:56,086 --> 00:45:57,754
-How do you feel?
-Please tell us.

645
00:45:57,838 --> 00:46:00,340
-Please look here.
-Why did you murder him?

646
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:02,217
-Please tell us.
-How do you feel right now?

647
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:03,760
-Say something.
-Why did you do it?

648
00:46:03,886 --> 00:46:06,388
-How do you feel right now?
-Move aside.

649
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:09,475
-Do you feel guilty?
-How do you feel?

650
00:46:09,558 --> 00:46:11,393
-Please tell us.
-Hurry up.

651
00:46:11,477 --> 00:46:13,979
-Why did you do it?
-How do you feel?

COURT IN SESSION

653
00:46:17,065 --> 00:46:18,108
Your Honor.

654
00:46:18,817 --> 00:46:20,944
I'd like to submit some extra evidence.

655
00:46:24,364 --> 00:46:26,283
I don't understand why he would
submit extra evidence

656
00:46:26,366 --> 00:46:28,619
when he already completed
interrogating her.

657
00:46:28,744 --> 00:46:32,080
This evidence was found
at the defendant's house

658
00:46:32,164 --> 00:46:34,583
at 3:00 p.m. on May 15.

659
00:46:37,669 --> 00:46:39,254
It's just that...

660
00:46:40,172 --> 00:46:43,008
we needed to fully confirm
whether or not this knife

661
00:46:43,091 --> 00:46:45,302
was the knife used to stab the victim,
Jang Hui-jun.

662
00:46:45,385 --> 00:46:48,013
We were able to receive
the results last night.

663
00:46:48,096 --> 00:46:51,099
Please understand
we couldn't hand it in any earlier.

664
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:55,020
Your Honor,
according to the investigation reports,

665
00:46:55,103 --> 00:46:57,189
the defendant's house was searched
numerous times.

666
00:46:57,272 --> 00:46:58,899
However, nothing showed up.

667
00:46:59,274 --> 00:47:01,944
Therefore, it's very hard to accept
that a weapon suddenly showed up

668
00:47:02,027 --> 00:47:03,570
days after they searched her house.

669
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:05,781
Please postpone accepting it as evidence.

670
00:47:06,406 --> 00:47:08,992
First, I'll admit it as evidence.

671
00:47:09,076 --> 00:47:11,954
However, I'd also like to hear
from the forensic doctor.

672
00:47:14,373 --> 00:47:17,417
You are claiming that the stab wound
found on the victim's body

673
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:20,379
and the shape of the weapon
match perfectly. Is this right?

674
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:22,965
Yes, by examining the length
of the stab wound,

675
00:47:23,048 --> 00:47:25,551
I can roughly find out the shape
of the murder weapon.

676
00:47:25,634 --> 00:47:28,428
The shape of the submitted weapon
is almost identical.

677
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:32,391
The skilled investigators
could not find the weapon,

678
00:47:32,474 --> 00:47:34,351
but one day, it appears out of nowhere.

679
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:36,645
Isn't this a bit suspicious?

680
00:47:37,771 --> 00:47:39,815
All right, this is a mere possibility.

681
00:47:40,148 --> 00:47:43,694
Could it be that the weapon with the DNA
could've been fabricated?

682
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:47,072
For example, someone could've gotten
the blood from the victim's clothes

683
00:47:47,155 --> 00:47:50,033
or belongings, and put it on the weapon.

684
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:52,995
I can't say that your claim
is scientifically impossible,

685
00:47:53,078 --> 00:47:55,539
but at the same time,
you can't prove your claim is possible--

686
00:47:55,664 --> 00:47:57,082
But it is still possible though.

687
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:02,045
That's all.

688
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:06,550
Prosecutor, you may deliver
your closing argument.

689
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:16,602
Yes, Your Honor.

690
00:48:23,025 --> 00:48:26,486
The defendant, Eun Bong-hui,
is charged with first-degree murder

691
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:28,822
after luring the victim, Jang Hui-jun

692
00:48:28,905 --> 00:48:31,491
to her apartment
in Goyang, Gyeonggi Province

693
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:34,494
on May 11, 2015.

694
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:37,998
My dad said he lost his only sister

695
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:40,167
to a criminal.

696
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:41,460
You punk.

697
00:48:41,918 --> 00:48:44,921
Who told you that you could wear my robe
without my permission?

698
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:46,548
-Put your hands in the air.
-Thus,

699
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:49,635
my dad became a prosecutor
as a duck takes to water.

700
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:53,680
He distanced himself from political
and corrupted prosecutors.

701
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:54,681
This robe is important.

702
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:57,768
He only took criminal cases
and fought against crime.

703
00:48:58,727 --> 00:49:00,228
My dad...

704
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:02,439
was my hero.

705
00:49:09,321 --> 00:49:12,699
Just like his sister, my dad
became a victim of a crime.

706
00:49:13,533 --> 00:49:15,243
I wanted to fulfill my dad's dream...

707
00:49:16,244 --> 00:49:17,537
he couldn't fulfill himself.

708
00:49:19,331 --> 00:49:20,374
I...

709
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:24,086
wanted to be just like my dad.

710
00:49:26,254 --> 00:49:28,423
I wanted to fight against crime
just like my dad did,

711
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:30,759
catch as many criminals as I can,

712
00:49:32,094 --> 00:49:33,220
and one day,

713
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:35,681
die as a prosecutor.

714
00:49:37,057 --> 00:49:38,100
However...

715
00:49:38,183 --> 00:49:39,768
Hence, the prosecution
would like to suggest

716
00:49:40,352 --> 00:49:41,728
suitable punishment for the defendant.

717
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:45,399
She premeditated the murder,

718
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:48,777
she didn't repent her crime
as she lied during the whole trial,

719
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:51,488
and the victim's family is asking
for a severe punishment.

720
00:49:51,571 --> 00:49:52,572
Taking these into account,

721
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:55,909
according to Article 250
of the Criminal Code...

722
00:49:59,287 --> 00:50:02,332
I ask that she be sentenced
to 15 years in prison...

723
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:04,710
for the first-degree murder.

724
00:50:18,932 --> 00:50:20,392
Get her to confess and charge her.

725
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:24,604
If you fail to charge her
and get the maximum penalty,

726
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:25,731
you'll be fired.

727
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:27,649
You believe me, don't you?

728
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:31,153
I trust that you believe me.

729
00:50:31,653 --> 00:50:34,656
You are the only hope I have right now.

730
00:50:36,158 --> 00:50:40,370
The prosecution's argument
that the defendant killed the victim

731
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:43,749
is based on circumstantial evidence
and not beyond reasonable doubts...

732
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:49,296
Prosecutor.

733
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:53,175
Are you aware that the attorney is
delivering his closing argument?

734
00:50:53,258 --> 00:50:54,885
-Why are you...
-Your Honor.

735
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:01,892
I'd like to...

736
00:51:02,851 --> 00:51:04,352
submit additional evidence.

737
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:07,397
Did you say you want
to submit additional evidence?

738
00:51:07,939 --> 00:51:08,940
Yes, Your Honor.

739
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:12,611
The truth is...

740
00:51:14,237 --> 00:51:16,698
there was one more weapon...

741
00:51:17,699 --> 00:51:18,700
that was discovered.

742
00:51:29,252 --> 00:51:32,214
These two weapons were found
on the same day at different places.

743
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:42,766
Jang Hui-jun, the victim's blood
was on both of these weapons.

744
00:51:45,352 --> 00:51:46,436
If you look at this slide,

745
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:50,023
there is a map
where the other weapon was found.

746
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:54,903
It's about 7km away from the crime scene.

747
00:51:55,612 --> 00:51:59,115
Considering the time of death and
the response time of the ambulance,

748
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:01,368
it's impossible for the accused
to travel this far...

749
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:05,205
after killing the victim to conceal
the murder weapon.

750
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:11,294
Either she has an accomplice
who could have disposed the weapon,

751
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:14,422
or unless she is a super human
who can teleport,

752
00:52:15,715 --> 00:52:16,842
this is impossible.

753
00:52:18,051 --> 00:52:21,137
Then why are you submitting...

754
00:52:21,263 --> 00:52:23,306
this piece of evidence just now?

755
00:52:33,775 --> 00:52:35,569
I excluded this evidence on purpose.

756
00:52:37,863 --> 00:52:39,573
Going forward with the trial...

757
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:42,784
was more important than the truth to me.

758
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:45,871
If there are two murder weapons,

759
00:52:46,288 --> 00:52:49,791
it means one of them is fabricated.

760
00:52:51,376 --> 00:52:54,754
Which means the weapons
are not admissible in court.

761
00:52:55,964 --> 00:52:57,299
Ergo,

762
00:52:58,466 --> 00:53:00,552
according to Article 255
of the Criminal Procedure Law,

763
00:53:05,223 --> 00:53:06,766
the prosecution moves
to dismiss the charge.

764
00:53:21,781 --> 00:53:25,243
I can't understand a thing.
What's going to happen to Bong-hui?

765
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:28,288
What is he saying? What does that mean?

766
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:31,750
The prosecutor dug his own grave,

767
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:35,420
and he will release the defendant.

768
00:53:35,503 --> 00:53:36,504
Really?

769
00:53:36,588 --> 00:53:39,883
The prosecutor ended the case
with his own hands.

770
00:53:39,966 --> 00:53:44,471
The defendant, Eun Bong-hui,
will be released.

771
00:53:44,554 --> 00:53:47,766
So it means she can go home.

772
00:53:47,849 --> 00:53:49,935
Sir. My goodness. Thank you, sir.

773
00:53:50,018 --> 00:53:51,728
You don't have to thank me.

774
00:53:51,853 --> 00:53:52,938
Oh, right.

775
00:54:11,873 --> 00:54:13,792
-He's coming.
-He's coming out now.

776
00:54:13,875 --> 00:54:16,419
Isn't this an unprecedented case
where the prosecution drops the charges?

777
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:18,964
-Did you obtain the approval?
-Did you run it by the district attroney?

778
00:54:19,047 --> 00:54:21,091
-Isn't this act of rebellion?
-Was this settled in advance?

779
00:54:21,216 --> 00:54:22,592
-Please say a few words.
-She's here!

780
00:54:22,676 --> 00:54:23,969
-She's coming out.
-Here she is.

781
00:54:24,386 --> 00:54:25,345
How do you feel?

782
00:54:25,428 --> 00:54:27,639
-We'll hold an interview later.
-This is not the end, right?

783
00:54:27,722 --> 00:54:30,308
-What are your thoughts on this?
-I'm sorry. Please move aside.

784
00:54:30,392 --> 00:54:32,394
-Tell us how you feel.
-Please share a few words.

785
00:54:32,477 --> 00:54:34,396
-Did you expect this?
-Were you aware of the evidence?

786
00:54:34,479 --> 00:54:37,315
-How do you feel now?
-Hold on a second.

787
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:39,359
What are your thoughts on the result?

788
00:54:39,442 --> 00:54:40,568
Tell us your thoughts.

789
00:55:05,593 --> 00:55:07,554
Bong-hui, let's get going.

790
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:08,763
How do you feel?

791
00:55:08,847 --> 00:55:11,433
-Please answer a question.
-Tell us!

792
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:13,393
Isn't this unprecedented?

793
00:56:03,943 --> 00:56:04,944
I'm fine.

794
00:56:21,711 --> 00:56:23,505
You didn't have to do that.

795
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:25,298
I guess.

796
00:56:25,381 --> 00:56:26,633
You did that in case...

797
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:29,594
the prosecution files an appeal
even if she's acquitted, right?

798
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:32,931
I don't know.

799
00:56:37,185 --> 00:56:38,686
The prosecution won't appeal?

800
00:56:39,729 --> 00:56:43,274
When a prosecutor drops the charges,
they can't prosecute me again,

801
00:56:43,358 --> 00:56:47,570
unless they find another evidence
that proves me guilty.

802
00:56:47,946 --> 00:56:49,364
Put it in layman's terms.

803
00:56:50,615 --> 00:56:51,658
So it means...

804
00:56:52,742 --> 00:56:56,830
the prosecution can arrest me again
only when they find...

805
00:56:57,372 --> 00:56:59,457
a crucial piece of evidence against me.

806
00:57:01,668 --> 00:57:03,378
I'm so relieved.

807
00:57:04,045 --> 00:57:05,421
That sounds about right.

808
00:57:14,389 --> 00:57:16,850
The prosecutor made
a big sacrifice for me, Mom.

809
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:26,025
What's your relationship with her?
Why did you do that for her?

810
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:29,821
It's fate.

811
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:31,614
Fate?

812
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:04,272
THIS IS FATE
I AGREE

813
00:58:06,274 --> 00:58:08,276
BUT HE'S COOL
I THINK SO TOO

814
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:56,324
Your conscience disappointed me.

815
00:58:58,243 --> 00:59:00,578
I thought it'd be easy for you
to disregard the truth.

816
00:59:07,126 --> 00:59:08,545
I'm more disappointed than you are.

817
00:59:08,670 --> 00:59:09,546
PROSECUTOR NOH JI-UK

818
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:13,383
My justness certainly let me down.

819
00:59:23,685 --> 00:59:24,894
PROSECUTOR'S OATH

820
00:59:24,978 --> 00:59:27,105
CODE OF CONDUCT
FOLLOW PRINCIPLES AND THE RIGHT PATH

821
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:30,567
I should go.

822
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:45,373
Being let down and hurt by men,

823
00:59:45,790 --> 00:59:49,294
I thought I'd never be able to trust
anyone ever again.

824
00:59:56,884 --> 01:00:00,305
But I've come to trust
and like someone again.

825
01:00:02,348 --> 01:00:03,725
It's that guy.

826
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:07,020
The man who saved me.

827
01:00:34,756 --> 01:00:38,134
SEONHO DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

828
01:00:54,859 --> 01:00:55,902
I think that we...

829
01:00:57,403 --> 01:00:58,446
met by fate.

830
01:01:02,450 --> 01:01:04,035
I also think you're my destiny--

831
01:01:04,118 --> 01:01:05,244
An ill-fated encounter.

832
01:01:12,418 --> 01:01:13,503
So...

833
01:01:15,421 --> 01:01:16,881
let's never cross paths again.

834
01:01:37,068 --> 01:01:38,861
Dad, I resigned.

835
01:01:38,945 --> 01:01:40,738
I'm sorry I couldn't become like you.

836
01:01:40,822 --> 01:01:43,366
Lawyer Noh! You're no longer a prosecutor.

837
01:01:43,449 --> 01:01:45,451
Welcome, Noh Ji-uk!

838
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:48,830
-Get lost.
-Whenever things got stressful,

839
01:01:48,913 --> 01:01:51,541
I took a little break by peeking at you.

840
01:01:51,874 --> 01:01:53,376
I think I met the real culprit.

841
01:01:53,459 --> 01:01:54,544
I'll find the culprit!

842
01:01:54,669 --> 01:01:57,463
I'll become successful and make sure
to repay your kindness too!

843
01:01:57,547 --> 01:02:00,925
I'm going to change our relationship
from an ill-fated one to a good one.

844
01:02:01,008 --> 01:02:02,885
