1
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:48,441
Mr. Bang, wake up! Please, Mr. Bang!

2
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:49,859
Mr. Bang!

3
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:27,897
Ms. Eun!

4
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:39,242
Ji-uk already notified the police
and called the ambulance.

5
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:41,578
They're probably on their way
to the hospital right now.

6
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:44,205
He'll be okay, right?

7
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:52,839
He'll be fine, right?

8
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:55,800
Of course.

9
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:57,927
He'll be fine.

10
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:19,741
My goodness.

11
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:23,578
Try going a little faster, Mr. Ham.

12
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:24,871
Yes, I'm trying.

13
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,999
I get that you're trying.

14
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:30,460
But speed up a bit more.

15
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:34,005
I'm very impatient right now.

16
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:39,469
PROSECUTOR CHA YU-JEONG

17
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,222
EUN-HYEOK

18
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,433
Hey, Eun-hyeok.

19
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:48,353
What?

20
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:51,981
Okay, I'll be right there.

21
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:56,986
Eun-ho.

22
00:03:58,196 --> 00:03:59,322
I'm sorry, Eun-ho.

23
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:01,616
What a useless apology.

24
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:03,326
If...

25
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:06,663
If only I had come a little earlier...

26
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:08,873
I...

27
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,169
I should've gotten there a bit faster.

28
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,089
What a useless regret.

29
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,341
Please don't die.

30
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:22,011
Please don't die, Eun-ho.

31
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:26,849
Eun-ho.

32
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:28,184
Dad.

33
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,063
Dad.

34
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:37,485
Dad.

35
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:39,279
Please don't die.

36
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:41,531
Eun-ho, I'm sorry.

37
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:42,657
Please.

38
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:55,128
Eun-ho.

39
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:58,339
Eun-ho.

40
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:26,159
Jung Hyeon-su.

41
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:29,620
Jung Hyeon-su.

42
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:31,748
Jung Hyeon-su.

43
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,710
Jung Hyeon-su!

44
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:37,795
Jung Hyeon-su!

45
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:44,677
Jung Hyeon-su.

46
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,265
Ji-uk.

47
00:06:36,395 --> 00:06:38,272
You're... You're here.

48
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:44,278
Did you contact Prosecutor Cha?

49
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:45,530
She'll be here soon.

50
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:47,907
Okay.

51
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:50,910
What happened?

52
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:53,496
Why did Mr. Bang get attacked?

53
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:57,792
It's being investigated by the police,
but don't rely on them.

54
00:06:57,875 --> 00:07:00,586
I'd like you to take charge
and directly investigate what happened.

55
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,964
DIRECT INVESTIGATION:
A DIRECT INVOLVEMENT OF THE PROSECUTION

56
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:04,924
As you may already know,
the key suspect is...

57
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:08,719
Jung Hyeon-su.
But he's not an easy fellow.

58
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:10,179
It won't be easy to find evidence.

59
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:14,100
He used Go Chan-ho and forensics
to get away...

60
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:18,062
with his murders. So I'm sure
he's well informed about

61
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:20,148
forensic science. Therefore,

62
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,775
he probably already prepared an alibi.

63
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:25,862
But he still might have missed something.

64
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:28,239
So it's important to do a proper

65
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:30,741
preliminary investigation.

66
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:32,326
What could there be?

67
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:36,414
We can start from the crime site
and go through all the CCTVs nearby.

68
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:37,498
We also need...

69
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:40,918
an eyewitness testimony,

70
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:43,629
and we need to check Jung Hyeon-su's

71
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:45,131
-whereabouts.
-Just...

72
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:48,259
Just leave everything to me, Ji-uk.

73
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:50,011
She's right.

74
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:52,221
Let's leave the investigation to
Prosecutor Cha.

75
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:55,725
We should worry about Mr. Bang's surgery.

76
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:01,272
Okay.

77
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,139
There are CCTVs nearby, right?

78
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,183
Please collect every single one.

79
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:39,370
UNDER OPERATION

80
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:46,210
The internal bleeding was severe
because he had injured his spleen.

81
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:49,338
But luckily, we managed to stop the
bleeding before he fell into shock.

82
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:52,008
So the worst part is over now.

83
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,551
However...

84
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:56,929
What? However? What else is wrong?

85
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:59,932
Due to excessive bleeding, his brain
didn't get enough blood flow.

86
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,726
So there's a possibility of brain damage.

87
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:04,687
Then that means it's not
for certain, right?

88
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:07,440
Yes, but I'm just letting you know
of all the possibilities.

89
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:09,567
Then you're also saying that

90
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:13,112
he could wake up without
having any problems at all, right?

91
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:15,656
Yes. We'll need to wait and see.
I'll get going.

92
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:23,372
Don't worry. Don't worry.

93
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:27,877
Mr. Bang is a strong man.
He'll wake up soon.

94
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:30,463
Trust me. He'll be okay.

95
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:33,591
My goodness.

96
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:03,579
Did you do everything I told you to?

97
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:04,747
Yes.

98
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:07,458
It must've been tiring.

99
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,551
It's simple, but let me tell you again
just in case you might forget.

100
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,887
First, wear this jacket and the helmet.

101
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:22,431
Don't ever take off the helmet.
I already told you earlier, right?

102
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:24,934
Then you just need to deliver these
to the right person.

103
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:28,354
You're going to become me.

104
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:29,855
Here's the cell phone.

105
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:32,483
Once you arrive, please send
a text message with this cell phone.

106
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:34,735
You must use this cell phone, okay?

107
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:38,489
Don't worry.

108
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:41,158
Starting from this moment until tonight,

109
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:43,369
you're going to be my perfect alibi.

110
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:45,204
Please take care of it well.

111
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:51,210
LAWYER NOH JI-UK

112
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:05,599
It's better if you get caught on camera.

113
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,269
Don't ever take off that helmet,

114
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,312
and try not to talk if possible.

115
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,314
You just need to deliver these.

116
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:17,403
Your delivery is here.
I'm in front of the store.

117
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:19,697
You must remember every single thing.

118
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:23,159
Please make sure to remember
if the receiver was a man or a woman.

119
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:25,911
Take note of that person's age,
appearance, clothing, and characteristic.

120
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,204
Remember everything.

121
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:29,582
You also need to remember
the surrounding environment

122
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:31,542
and any kind of sudden event.

123
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:35,754
On top of the real estate office
that was next to the gimbap place

124
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:37,590
there was a CCTV.

125
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:42,344
And a guy in a pink shirt
who came on a bike

126
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:43,596
went into the shop.

127
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:47,349
And a girl in a white shirt

128
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,935
was walking a brown poodle.

129
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:53,189
A brown poodle?

130
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:55,816
I see.

131
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:59,570
You have a very detailed
memory of the night.

132
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:02,740
You said if I miss a single thing,
you won't pay me.

133
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:04,533
I should give you your pay for the night.

134
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:07,453
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

135
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:14,376
-Contact me if you need my service.
-Okay.

136
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,670
-Have a good night.
-Thank you.

137
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:26,388
-What is it?
-Nothing. Take care.

138
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:37,650
A brown poodle?

139
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:40,319
A pink shirt.

140
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:42,321
A CCTV camera.

141
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:51,098
I'm certain...

142
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:53,893
he will be okay.

143
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,188
Everything will be all right.

144
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:09,074
I thought he was going to die on me.

145
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:16,206
I could neither feel his pulse...

146
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,251
nor his breathing.

147
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,715
I really thought he wouldn't make it.

148
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:38,520
Nothing...

149
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:41,815
will happen to Mr. Bang.

150
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,027
Everything will be fine.

151
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:47,613
It must be.

152
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:50,407
It has to be, and it will be.

153
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,883
How is Mr. Bang?

154
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:10,761
Hopefully, he will recover soon.

155
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,389
How is the investigation going?

156
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:15,641
I have no grounds to summon
Jung Hyeon-su forcibly.

157
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:17,017
I thought so.

158
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:20,896
-But--
-But I still summoned him.

159
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:24,733
I have to see if Jung Hyeon-su
will comply with it or not.

160
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,779
He will definitely come.

161
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:32,825
By the way, it's about Ji-uk.

162
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:36,453
According to the police officers
who were dispatched to the scene,

163
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:41,125
they said the look
on Ji-uk's face was scary.

164
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:44,712
They said he looked
like he might do something.

165
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:27,504
Where are you going?

166
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:30,507
Hey, Ji-uk. Noh Ji-uk.

167
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:32,885
-Where are you going right now?
-Let me go.

168
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:34,053
Hey!

169
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:36,805
What can you do if you meet
Jung Hyeon-su right now?

170
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,348
That's none of your business.

171
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:40,768
Please get yourself together!
Come on, Ji-uk!

172
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:43,353
There is nothing you can do right now.

173
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:45,314
Then do I just sit and watch again?

174
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:48,567
Hey, you know what happened.
Mr. Bang has been stabbed.

175
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:52,237
Then I will have to lose someone.
Should I just watch that happen?

176
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:54,323
No, I can't do that.
I won't just watch him die!

177
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,033
So what is your plan?

178
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:58,911
-What can you do right now?
-I have to do something at least.

179
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:02,664
I'm going to pay back what he did to me.

180
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,167
Jung Hyeon-su?

181
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:08,212
I'll make him regret, just like me.

182
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:20,265
SEONHO DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

183
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:26,230
It doesn't feel so bad

184
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:29,525
to come to the prosecutors' office
without a proper warrant.

185
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:37,616
Thank you for thinking that way.

186
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:40,202
I said it didn't feel so bad,
but I never said it felt good.

187
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:48,085
Since you are here,
I suggest that you cooperate.

188
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:49,920
Sure. I'll do that. Have a seat.

189
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:00,222
So what do you want to know from me?

190
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:05,894
I will be blunt. Your alibi.

191
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:12,025
Well, don't take this the wrong way.

192
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:15,654
I'm asking the same question
to everyone who knew

193
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:17,531
both Lee Jae-ho and Bang Eun-ho.

194
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,451
It's my business if I take it
the wrong way or not.

195
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:26,790
Even if I do take it the wrong way,
what can I do about it?

196
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,293
What did I do on that day?

197
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,462
What did I do?

198
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:37,801
I worked. I have to make a living.

199
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:41,930
We keep a thorough delivery record.
You can get it when you investigate.

200
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:45,642
You can ask the recipients
of the deliveries and go on from there.

201
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:49,271
Goodness, you sure have a good memory.

202
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:52,566
You can present your alibi right away
when you are asked.

203
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:57,029
You know that time I was wrongfully
arrested for Chef Yang's murder?

204
00:19:57,946 --> 00:20:00,991
I try to remember it all
since I don't want to be framed again.

205
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:04,203
I can't be framed again
because the prosecutors are incompetent.

206
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:07,289
Don't you agree? You are
competent unlike others.

207
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:22,221
-Thank you for your time.
-Sure.

208
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:32,189
Are you going to just let him walk,
Yu-jeong?

209
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:36,068
What other choices do I have?
All I have is a hunch with no proof.

210
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:38,987
We have to find something.

211
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,990
We have to find whatever it is.

212
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:11,853
Hello?

213
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:14,356
Hey, Mr. Jung. It's me.

214
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:16,108
Oh, hello, Mr. Noh.

215
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:18,777
I'd like to meet you.

216
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:23,031
Well, it'd be better if we met sooner.

217
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:25,784
Okay, I'll wait for you.

218
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:31,957
Hey, when did you get here?

219
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:55,689
GUKIL MEDICAL CENTER

220
00:21:58,191 --> 00:22:02,612
Everyone, since last night,
I have been talking to you

221
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:04,990
without resting even for a moment.

222
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:08,410
I'm a lawyer.
After all, talking is my job,

223
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:12,039
but talking by myself is

224
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:13,248
quite challenging.

225
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:17,044
It's also challenging for us
to just listen to you.

226
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:19,421
Do you think I'm talking for your sake?

227
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:22,007
I'm talking so that Mr. Bang can hear me.

228
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:25,427
-You're loud. He has to rest.
-You're the loud one.

229
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:28,930
My mom collapsed unconscious
at a late age.

230
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:30,891
She was a bedridden patient.

231
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:34,227
At that time, my dad sat near her bed

232
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:38,523
and talked to her all day long.

233
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:40,150
I'm telling you.

234
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:45,489
Normally, my father would utter
less than three words a day.

235
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:46,948
"Have you eaten?

236
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:48,033
You're awake?"

237
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:49,367
Things like that, you know.

238
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:52,287
My mother used to nag him
so much about it,

239
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:54,456
saying she doesn't even know her
husband's voice

240
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:57,084
even though they lived together
for a long time.

241
00:22:57,584 --> 00:23:01,004
My gosh. That quiet man

242
00:23:01,379 --> 00:23:05,926
became so chatty
after my mother collapsed.

243
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:08,804
Then one day...

244
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:10,013
What happened?

245
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:12,349
My mother regained her consciousness

246
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:13,767
and said this.

247
00:23:14,392 --> 00:23:18,897
"I had to wake up
because that man was being so loud."

248
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:22,984
Goodness. Don't lie.

249
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:24,903
I'm dead serious.

250
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,363
Who knows?

251
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:29,282
Mr. Bang might wake up
because of my chatter.

252
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:32,035
Gosh, my throat is sore.

253
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,751
It must be the nurse.

254
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:41,795
She said she'd change the fluid.

255
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:43,922
Yes, come in.

256
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:47,968
Hello.

257
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:55,517
Our ex-client is here.

258
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,103
How did you know he was here?
We weren't expecting you.

259
00:23:58,186 --> 00:24:03,066
I just wanted to visit as I was so worried
after hearing what happened to him.

260
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:21,710
I didn't know that you'd come
all the way here, Mr. Jung.

261
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:23,920
You told me to come. That's why...

262
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:26,882
Really? I'm pretty sure
I never asked you to meet me here.

263
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:30,719
It looks like I'm intruding again.
Aren't I?

264
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:31,803
Yes.

265
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:34,681
We'll need to talk outside.
You're okay with that, right?

266
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:35,849
Of course. It's fine.

267
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:37,309
Let's go, then.

268
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:42,772
Ms. Eun.

269
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:48,904
What was that about?

270
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:56,703
Where should we go?

271
00:24:56,786 --> 00:24:58,705
We should find a quiet spot.

272
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:00,790
No, we should find a noisy spot.

273
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:01,875
All right, then.

274
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,294
Let's go.

275
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:14,179
I told you that I don't have
a voice recorder or anything like that.

276
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:17,724
Do we really have to talk
at a place that's this noisy, Mr. Jung?

277
00:25:17,807 --> 00:25:21,394
Yes, we do have to talk
in the midst of noise like this, Mr. Noh.

278
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:24,898
I'm going to be honest with you
and tell you something very important.

279
00:25:26,524 --> 00:25:27,943
All right. Go ahead.

280
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:33,281
I killed them all.

281
00:25:34,407 --> 00:25:36,743
Those bodies in the water tank and...

282
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:38,578
You know Ms. Eun's ex-boyfriend, right?

283
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:40,288
That guy and... Who was the other guy?

284
00:25:40,538 --> 00:25:41,623
Right, Chef Yang too.

285
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:43,124
I killed all of them.

286
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:49,005
Well, you don't even seem surprised.

287
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:50,590
I already knew it was your doing.

288
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:53,885
Then why aren't you arresting me?

289
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:55,595
Arrest me. Here.

290
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:00,642
You just wait. I'll be sure
to get you arrested very soon.

291
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:05,063
My goodness...

292
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:11,695
Well, I suddenly remembered that time.

293
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:15,282
I just thought about what happened
with the Chef Yang case.

294
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:18,326
I stabbed him and killed him,
you know. I was the culprit,

295
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:21,288
yet you defended me so passionately.

296
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:23,957
I thought you looked very cool
back then. What did you say?

297
00:26:24,582 --> 00:26:26,334
What... Oh, the fabricated...

298
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:27,919
Due to the fabricated pieces of evidence,

299
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:30,380
an innocent man was unfairly
framed for murder.

300
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:33,800
Who will uphold his rights?

301
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:37,971
That was so cool. You rocked.

302
00:26:38,596 --> 00:26:39,597
Right.

303
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:43,977
I'm deeply regretting
what I did back then.

304
00:26:44,894 --> 00:26:46,229
Don't smirk, you scum.

305
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:49,149
Had I gotten to know you sooner...

306
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:53,236
Had I figured you out a little sooner
and not set you free,

307
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:55,613
neither Lee Jae-ho nor Go Chan-ho
would have ended up like that.

308
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:56,948
And Mr. Bang...

309
00:26:57,907 --> 00:26:59,242
You wouldn't have been able

310
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:01,536
to harm him like that.

311
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:16,509
Are you now beginning
to understand how I feel?

312
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:19,679
Have you ever seen anyone
close to you getting hurt?

313
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:24,059
Think about those who mean a lot to you.

314
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,394
If those people who are so dear to you

315
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:28,813
die or get hurt...

316
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:31,608
Do you now know how it feels?

317
00:27:32,525 --> 00:27:33,777
If you do,

318
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:35,445
you should...

319
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:38,114
try to understand me.

320
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:41,076
Just leave me alone.
Don't meddle in my business, please.

321
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:43,870
Then I'll really leave you guys
alone too. I won't do anything.

322
00:27:43,953 --> 00:27:45,288
I can promise you.

323
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:48,208
Let's promise. Deal? Yes?

324
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:51,211
I don't want to.

325
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:09,145
I guess you still don't really understand
how I feel.

326
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:12,524
I truly want to make you feel this too.

327
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:14,651
What should I do?

328
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:18,988
I should just kill them all.

329
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,611
Ms. Eun, are you going somewhere?

330
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:02,031
I can't just wait here.
Something bad might happen to him.

331
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:03,533
-I should go and--
-Ji-uk

332
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,452
told Jung Hyeon-su to come here
on purpose.

333
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:07,120
Pardon?

334
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:10,457
To give me time to dig up things on him.

335
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:14,252
I hope he doesn't get hurt badly.

336
00:29:14,794 --> 00:29:15,795
Sorry?

337
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:18,590
Hey, Jung Hyeon-su.

338
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:23,720
I was going to just let you go,

339
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:27,348
but I don't think I can
do that today, you scum.

340
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:31,644
Did you just punch me?

341
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:37,859
Come again.

342
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:40,528
Enough is enough.

343
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:41,821
Are you kidding me?

344
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:43,573
Enough, my ass.

345
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:48,787
Gosh, this is crazy.

346
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:50,705
What? Bring it on.

347
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:52,457
Hey, come on.

348
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:15,980
Yes, hello?

349
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:19,609
Pardon me?

350
00:30:23,696 --> 00:30:26,741
Are you two kids or what?
Look at your faces.

351
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:31,496
I'm truly embarrassed as his lawyer.

352
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:34,165
-You're a lawyer?
-Yes.

353
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:36,709
Oh, me too.

354
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:46,636
Please help them resolve this soon.
They just need to settle,

355
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:48,763
but they're insisting that they won't.

356
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:50,974
It's actually this guy
who's refusing to settle.

357
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:53,601
I'd like to settle, but... Sir.

358
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:55,186
Please look at this.

359
00:30:56,062 --> 00:30:58,648
I can't settle because this hurts so much.

360
00:30:58,731 --> 00:31:01,359
-Then I won't settle either.
-Gosh, I don't have time for this.

361
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:03,987
Then I'll need to lock you guys up
in the holding cell.

362
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:32,599
Where are we going right now, Mr. Ji?

363
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:38,897
-If my guess is right--
-I'm going to do something bad.

364
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:41,482
Are you with me
or would you like to stay out of it?

365
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:18,853
Find it whatever it may be.

366
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:21,689
What if there's nothing?

367
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:26,361
You know how meticulous he is.

368
00:32:49,258 --> 00:32:52,679
His house key is in the basket
where our belongings are.

369
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:55,598
It's a finger-sized smart key.

370
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:00,269
Okay.

371
00:33:08,444 --> 00:33:09,821
I'm sorry.

372
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:16,304
I'll look through his desk.

373
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:17,388
Okay.

374
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:30,526
If...

375
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:33,071
If there is nothing,

376
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:35,782
we should plant

377
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:38,284
a murder weapon that has...

378
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:41,329
his fingerprints.

379
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:05,353
Mr. Ji.

380
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:08,439
I don't think there's anything
we can use here.

381
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:11,651
I agree.

382
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:15,863
But we should still look for something.

383
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:17,698
Okay.

384
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:43,766
Hey, Mr. Bang.

385
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:48,563
Everyone is trying their best

386
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,190
to find the culprit who did this to you.

387
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:54,527
Please just wake up already. Okay?

388
00:35:55,444 --> 00:35:58,072
Hey, I don't think I can...

389
00:35:59,448 --> 00:36:01,617
take care of your urine anymore.

390
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:03,786
Wake up.

391
00:36:07,206 --> 00:36:10,042
I think they might have found...

392
00:36:11,794 --> 00:36:13,880
the culprit who stabbed you.

393
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:20,595
AGREEMENT

394
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:23,681
VICTIM: JUNG HYEON-SU
ASSAILANT: NOH JI-UK

395
00:36:30,062 --> 00:36:33,274
If you were going to settle,
you should've done it yesterday.

396
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:35,484
I agree. Goodness.

397
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,529
We're sorry. Can we go now?

398
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:39,989
Then do you plan on living here?

399
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,268
This is a weapon with his fingerprints

400
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:11,145
which I took from his house.

401
00:37:12,146 --> 00:37:15,399
If we put Mr. Bang and
Lee Jae Ho's blood on it,

402
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:18,444
this will be the perfect piece of
evidence that makes him the killer.

403
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:19,946
That's right.

404
00:37:20,696 --> 00:37:24,408
It won't be a problem since the size
is similar to the murder weapon.

405
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:25,701
I get that they are similar.

406
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:28,913
I brought it since you asked, but
are you really going to use this?

407
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:33,918
Maybe.

408
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:36,837
Let me say something
I would normally not say.

409
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:39,799
This is fabricating evidence.
This is an illegal activity.

410
00:37:39,882 --> 00:37:42,885
Clause 1, Article 155, Criminal Law,
tampering with evidence.

411
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:45,638
"He or she may serve a maximum
of five years or pay 7 million won."

412
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:46,806
That's not all.

413
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:49,684
Do you know that you will lose
your license to practice law?

414
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:51,560
-I know.
-And you will still do it?

415
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:52,561
Yes, I will.

416
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:53,646
Hey, Ji-uk.

417
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:56,232
As he disclosed it himself,
he's the culprit,

418
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:58,484
but we have no legal evidence.
Then what should we do?

419
00:37:58,567 --> 00:38:00,695
What should we do?
What am I supposed to do?

420
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:02,154
Should I just watch?

421
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:05,157
Should I watch him murdering
people as he pleases?

422
00:38:05,324 --> 00:38:06,409
We should dig a bit more.

423
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:08,119
What if we still can't find anything?

424
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:09,453
We'll worry about that later.

425
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:10,871
You're right.

426
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:13,291
This is like a leverage we can use later.

427
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:14,959
This is our last card we will use...

428
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:18,004
after trying to do everything
in our power.

429
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:20,756
Fine.

430
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:23,676
Then I will do it.
You should stay out of it.

431
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:24,719
What?

432
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:26,971
If I fabricate a piece of evidence,
it fits my reputation,

433
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:28,180
but yours doesn't.

434
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:30,891
You used to be a righteous prosecutor.
Don't you remember?

435
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:34,812
I asked you to do this.

436
00:38:35,187 --> 00:38:36,814
I'm going to do this. You stay out of it.

437
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:38,399
Then...

438
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:40,401
I should do it.

439
00:38:45,948 --> 00:38:48,034
I have experience of staying in prison.

440
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:49,327
The number of times won't matter.

441
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:51,454
I'll do it.

442
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:55,207
I thought you were at the hospital.

443
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:58,127
I just got here.
Mr. Byeon asked me to go home.

444
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:00,963
-Bong-hui, this is--
-If you need someone to do it,

445
00:39:02,631 --> 00:39:03,799
I'll do it.

446
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:06,385
It's my fault.

447
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:10,931
From the beginning,

448
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:13,642
it has been my fault.

449
00:39:15,811 --> 00:39:17,897
It's because I brought
Jung Hyeon-su into this.

450
00:39:23,986 --> 00:39:25,029
Everyone...

451
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,740
has their own reasons
imputable to the incident.

452
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:39,126
-We will be back.
-Okay.

453
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:41,962
Please go home now. If you do this,
I'll ban you from working overtime.

454
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:45,007
I have to go soon. Mr. Byeon
wants to have a drink with me.

455
00:39:45,132 --> 00:39:45,966
You're drinking again?

456
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:47,093
I know, right?

457
00:39:47,426 --> 00:39:48,427
I'll see you tomorrow.

458
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:49,970
I'll see you tomorrow, Mr. Bang.

459
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:51,097
Goodbye.

460
00:39:57,436 --> 00:39:59,647
MR. BYEON YEONG-HUI

461
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:06,112
Yes, Mr. Byeon. Where should I--

462
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:07,947
I have to cancel our plan tonight.

463
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:11,784
-Pardon?
-My doctor told me not to drink. Darn it.

464
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:15,871
That's right. You ought
to listen to your doctor.

465
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:18,165
Okay. Goodbye then.

466
00:40:18,457 --> 00:40:20,209
You should go home now.

467
00:40:22,294 --> 00:40:23,379
I'm saved.

468
00:40:28,217 --> 00:40:29,427
If I didn't

469
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:33,973
cancel our plan on that night...

470
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:37,977
No.

471
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:42,022
It's my fault.

472
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:52,199
Yes. We have to find out
the identity of this person.

473
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:55,536
Yes. Gosh, I asked you
for so many favors. I'm sorry, sir.

474
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:56,704
Yes.

475
00:40:57,037 --> 00:41:00,291
Mr. Bang, Ji-uk told you
to stop investigating on your own.

476
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:05,004
Okay. I see.

477
00:41:05,087 --> 00:41:06,130
Suit yourself.

478
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:08,132
I see.

479
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:10,926
Yes. And then?

480
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:20,102
Hey, you are here.

481
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,630
If I stopped you that time...

482
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:55,698
Let's stop...

483
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:02,871
blaming ourselves or each other
for what happened.

484
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,669
Let's especially stop blaming
our own selves.

485
00:43:14,883 --> 00:43:17,011
I thought I was the only one who was
full of regret.

486
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:19,763
I thought I was the only one
beating myself up.

487
00:45:56,962 --> 00:46:00,340
Please help them resolve this soon.
They just need to settle,

488
00:46:00,507 --> 00:46:02,551
but they're insisting that they won't.

489
00:46:02,759 --> 00:46:04,636
It's actually this guy
who's refusing to settle.

490
00:46:11,059 --> 00:46:13,812
So that's why Mr. Noh did what he did.

491
00:46:17,774 --> 00:46:18,901
This is fun.

492
00:46:22,654 --> 00:46:26,742
I checked Jung Hyeon-su's alibi
on the day Mr. Bang got attacked.

493
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:29,953
So are you saying that you weren't able to
see his face

494
00:46:30,037 --> 00:46:32,915
because he kept his helmet on?

495
00:46:32,998 --> 00:46:34,583
Yes, that's right.

496
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:36,793
I couldn't see his face
because his helmet was so dark,

497
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,504
and he didn't even say a word.

498
00:46:38,587 --> 00:46:41,548
Sorry? He didn't say anything?

499
00:46:41,757 --> 00:46:42,674
No.

500
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:46,261
Seeing that he never took his helmet off,
and he never spoke out loud,

501
00:46:46,428 --> 00:46:47,846
I think he used a substitute.

502
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:52,476
Even so, the CCTV footage
and his cell phone location show nothing.

503
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:54,645
It's a perfect alibi,
even in a scientific point of view.

504
00:46:54,728 --> 00:46:56,813
That kind of assumption
will get us nowhere.

505
00:46:57,356 --> 00:46:58,398
You're right.

506
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:02,861
What about the autopsy result
of the second corpse from the water tank?

507
00:47:02,945 --> 00:47:03,987
There wasn't anything much.

508
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:07,074
The body was severely damaged
to begin with,

509
00:47:07,407 --> 00:47:10,827
and there was no evidence or DNA
related to Jung Hyeon-su.

510
00:47:11,453 --> 00:47:14,164
Nothing much was found
from Mr. Bang's clothes either.

511
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:18,835
I almost forgot.

512
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:21,630
I found this.

513
00:47:21,713 --> 00:47:24,007
JANG HYEON-JAE, KIM SEONG-JUN

514
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:27,177
I found this on Mr. Bang's desk.

515
00:47:27,844 --> 00:47:30,305
I looked into all the names on this list.

516
00:47:31,223 --> 00:47:33,850
And I found out that they have
something to do with Go Chan-ho.

517
00:47:34,142 --> 00:47:37,187
They either went to the same school
or lived in the same town as him.

518
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:39,773
Really? Let's look into this together.

519
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:43,026
Don't do that. Just pass all the
information to me.

520
00:47:43,235 --> 00:47:44,528
You're all civilians.

521
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:47,531
You're working with civilians right now.

522
00:47:50,325 --> 00:47:53,203
I wonder if we'll ever get
any solid evidence.

523
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:56,540
I wish a weapon or something
would suddenly appear.

524
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:24,359
UNKNOWN NUMBER

525
00:48:38,915 --> 00:48:39,916
Shit.

526
00:48:47,007 --> 00:48:48,091
Mr. Noh.

527
00:49:06,151 --> 00:49:09,529
You're a lawyer.
Why are you always so violent?

528
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:12,741
Well, I just wanted to see you
from up close.

529
00:49:14,993 --> 00:49:15,952
Let go.

530
00:49:16,828 --> 00:49:17,663
Okay.

531
00:49:22,584 --> 00:49:23,585
Hey.

532
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:28,674
Hey. Didn't we agree to mind
each other's own business?

533
00:49:28,757 --> 00:49:29,591
Didn't we?

534
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:39,935
Is that why you came into my house
and went through my stuff?

535
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:42,229
Who? Me? When?

536
00:49:46,274 --> 00:49:47,693
Gosh...

537
00:49:49,861 --> 00:49:50,862
Hey.

538
00:49:51,863 --> 00:49:55,367
I told you that I won't bother you
if you don't bother me first.

539
00:49:56,952 --> 00:50:00,080
I'm already so busy. Why do you keep
challenging me?

540
00:50:00,706 --> 00:50:01,915
I wouldn't have come this far

541
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:06,670
if people like you had done your job
properly in the first place.

542
00:50:07,629 --> 00:50:09,673
I'm only becoming like this
because you guys keep

543
00:50:09,756 --> 00:50:13,760
locking up the innocent
and letting the guilty ones free.

544
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:24,938
Mr. Noh.

545
00:50:26,481 --> 00:50:27,566
I'm...

546
00:50:29,067 --> 00:50:31,027
doing what's right.

547
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:36,324
I'm only doing what I must do.

548
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:38,285
Don't you understand?

549
00:50:48,795 --> 00:50:50,505
I only know him. I don't know the others.

550
00:50:51,965 --> 00:50:53,049
What about...

551
00:50:54,593 --> 00:50:55,761
this guy?

552
00:51:03,018 --> 00:51:05,061
To sum up,

553
00:51:05,353 --> 00:51:08,190
Chef Yang went to study abroad
when he was in high school.

554
00:51:08,315 --> 00:51:11,109
And he went there because he had caused
trouble here in Korea.

555
00:51:11,276 --> 00:51:12,778
That's what the rumors said.

556
00:51:13,445 --> 00:51:16,031
Do you remember what the rumors were

557
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:18,784
and exactly when did he go abroad?

558
00:51:19,451 --> 00:51:21,244
No, I don't know that much.

559
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:34,341
Do you really not know anyone?

560
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:37,928
No. It's been too long,
so I can't remember much,

561
00:51:38,094 --> 00:51:39,221
whatever that may be.

562
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:41,973
Thank you for your cooperation.

563
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:46,394
But what's going on? Why are you

564
00:51:46,478 --> 00:51:49,022
asking people about the past?

565
00:51:51,316 --> 00:51:55,612
Well, it's just that I've also been
getting calls from Mr. Bang.

566
00:51:55,695 --> 00:51:59,115
And now, I even got a visit
from a lawyer. So I was just curious.

567
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:16,341
That's right. I fabricated the evidence.

568
00:52:17,259 --> 00:52:19,886
I used tricks
in order to catch Eun Bong-hui.

569
00:52:28,687 --> 00:52:30,772
You didn't do this to stop him.

570
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:33,358
You did this as a way of punishing him.

571
00:52:34,526 --> 00:52:35,485
Am I wrong?

572
00:52:35,569 --> 00:52:37,028
What's wrong with that?

573
00:52:38,613 --> 00:52:39,656
I'm...

574
00:52:40,448 --> 00:52:42,659
doing what's right.

575
00:52:45,245 --> 00:52:47,789
I'm only doing what I must do.

576
00:53:02,804 --> 00:53:04,055
I'll discard this.

577
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:13,064
So...

578
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:18,111
I'm saying

579
00:53:18,653 --> 00:53:20,447
we will never use this.

580
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:34,294
It's a bit frustrating, but we should
deal with this the right way.

581
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:37,380
Otherwise, we'll become just like them.

582
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:41,092
All right. Let's take our time.

583
00:53:41,927 --> 00:53:43,428
I agree with you too.

584
00:53:43,595 --> 00:53:46,848
Jung Hyeon-su must be planning
something else now.

585
00:53:46,932 --> 00:53:48,975
We don't exactly know whom his target is,

586
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:51,019
but we're sure he's getting his revenge,
one at a time.

587
00:53:51,102 --> 00:53:52,103
It means

588
00:53:52,604 --> 00:53:54,940
there was a case where the accuser
evaded law enforcement

589
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:58,026
or got a slap on the wrist
for what he did.

590
00:53:58,234 --> 00:54:01,321
That's right. Someone among those
whom Mr. Bang looked into

591
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:03,198
keeps popping up in my mind.

592
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:04,908
Reach out to Prosecutor Cha
for cooperation.

593
00:54:05,659 --> 00:54:06,910
What I'm trying to say is...

594
00:54:08,536 --> 00:54:10,455
that we should remember
what happened to Mr. Bang...

595
00:54:12,123 --> 00:54:14,668
and be careful. Got it?

596
00:54:14,918 --> 00:54:15,919
Of course.

597
00:54:42,028 --> 00:54:43,029
Well done.

598
00:54:44,447 --> 00:54:46,408
You made the right decision, Mr. Noh.

599
00:54:49,202 --> 00:54:50,453
I'm proud of you.

600
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:15,311
Chef Yang died,

601
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:18,732
and Chan-ho has gone missing.

602
00:55:20,692 --> 00:55:22,360
Jae-ho died too.

603
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:26,031
What if...

604
00:55:28,241 --> 00:55:29,367
Darn it.

605
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:19,876
I got a text message.

606
00:56:20,001 --> 00:56:21,961
I'm certain
that Jung Hyeon-su is the culprit.

607
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:23,213
There is evidence.

608
00:56:23,296 --> 00:56:24,172
So what?

609
00:56:24,255 --> 00:56:25,507
Help me get a warrant issued.

610
00:56:25,924 --> 00:56:27,634
We must search his place
to secure the evidence.

611
00:56:27,717 --> 00:56:30,303
We can only get a search warrant
issued when there is evidence.

612
00:56:30,386 --> 00:56:31,638
Chief.

613
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:34,099
Shall I resign if I'm wrong?

614
00:56:34,182 --> 00:56:35,350
Will you approve it, then?

615
00:56:35,433 --> 00:56:36,768
You'll resign?

616
00:56:36,851 --> 00:56:39,187
You think your job is a joke or something?

617
00:56:39,437 --> 00:56:41,314
Do whatever you want! Goodness.

618
00:56:41,397 --> 00:56:42,524
Sir, please.

619
00:56:51,991 --> 00:56:53,326
CHA YU-JEONG

620
00:56:56,538 --> 00:56:57,497
Hey, Yu-jeong.

621
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,794
Wait, what are you talking about?

622
00:57:05,421 --> 00:57:06,381
All right.

623
00:57:34,576 --> 00:57:35,618
Darn it.

624
00:57:52,927 --> 00:57:54,429
What brings you here, Prosecutor Cha?

625
00:57:58,057 --> 00:57:59,267
I have a warrant.

626
00:58:00,101 --> 00:58:01,436
You must've seen this in the news.

627
00:58:02,103 --> 00:58:03,354
A search and seizure warrant.

628
00:58:03,521 --> 00:58:05,398
What's the warrant for?

629
00:58:05,523 --> 00:58:07,275
On what grounds?

630
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:11,321
-Let us in.
-Excuse me, Prosecutor Cha.

631
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:13,865
Wait, Prosecutor Cha.

632
00:58:15,283 --> 00:58:17,911
Take your shoes off, Mister.
Do you think this is your...

633
00:58:20,538 --> 00:58:21,581
This is crazy.

634
00:58:24,542 --> 00:58:26,336
Hey, that's expensive!

635
00:58:28,129 --> 00:58:29,130
Excuse me.

636
00:58:29,672 --> 00:58:32,842
Does the warrant let you barge in
and go through my stuff like this?

637
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:02,205
I found it.

638
00:59:13,508 --> 00:59:14,717
Gosh, Noh Ji-uk...

639
00:59:16,844 --> 00:59:17,887
Well, that's...

640
00:59:18,888 --> 00:59:20,974
-Jung Hyeon-su!
-Stop right there!

641
00:59:28,064 --> 00:59:29,315
Jung Hyeon-su!

642
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:28,875
Goodness, what's wrong with me?

643
01:00:37,216 --> 01:00:39,302
Hey, Mr. Bang!

644
01:00:39,594 --> 01:00:41,929
Hey, Mr. Bang!

645
01:02:20,528 --> 01:02:22,238
How incompetent do you have to be

646
01:02:22,321 --> 01:02:24,615
to humiliate me like this?

647
01:02:25,074 --> 01:02:26,826
Mr. Bang.

648
01:02:28,244 --> 01:02:30,913
