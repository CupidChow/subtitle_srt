1
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:46,212
I can write this
just like my cover letter, right?

2
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:47,589
EUN BONG-HUI

3
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:51,176
I have seen people writing it
but this is my first time writing one.

4
00:00:57,682 --> 00:01:00,602
When I was young...

5
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:24,250
Oh, goodness. My back hurts.
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

6
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:25,752
Come here. This way. Excuse us.

7
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:27,712
-Excuse me.
-I'm sorry.

8
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:29,130
-I'm sorry.
-Goodness.

9
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:31,591
-Hurry.
-I'm glad we got a seat.

10
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:33,176
Goodness.

11
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:15,552
I'm sorry.

12
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:18,763
It was you, wasn't it?

13
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:23,685
Excuse me?

14
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:27,480
There's always someone like you
on the subway one out of ten times.

15
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:30,775
It's nice to meet you.

16
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,653
We have met before?

17
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:36,156
-Do you know me?
-Oh, I know guys like you very well.

18
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,366
Thanks to you,
I developed PTSD on perverts.

19
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:39,409
-What?
-He's a pervert?

20
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:41,161
-Gosh, seriously?
-A pervert?

21
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:42,829
-I can't believe him.
-What a shame.

22
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:46,916
You don't really believe
I'm a pervert, right?

23
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:48,543
-Look.
-I'm looking.

24
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:49,836
Who are you calling a pervert?

25
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,129
I'm calling you a pervert.

26
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:53,923
-Why on earth am I--
-You touched my butt.

27
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,384
You grabbed and rubbed it disgustingly.

28
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:58,011
Why would I touch your butt?

29
00:02:58,094 --> 00:03:00,346
I should ask you that.
Why would you touch my butt?

30
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,848
I didn't touch your butt.

31
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:03,808
I never touched anything.

32
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:06,853
What I'm saying is, do you have proof?
Why do you think I--

33
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:10,773
I've seen many white-collar perverts
in clean suits like you.

34
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:12,984
You don't fool me!

35
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:14,444
I'm a pervert assessor.

36
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:17,614
"Pervert assessor," my ass.

37
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:19,991
-Look.
-You know what?

38
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:22,619
Article 13, Act on Special Cases
Concerning Sexual Crimes,

39
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,704
classifies this as sexual harassment
in public spaces.

40
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:27,624
You may face up to a year in prison
or up to 3-million-won fine.

41
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,208
It's Article 11, not 13.

42
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:31,002
Get it right before you speak.

43
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:33,004
See? I totally caught you.

44
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:34,130
This isn't your first time.

45
00:03:34,213 --> 00:03:36,841
Hey, I wasn't going to tell you
who I am, but--

46
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:38,176
What is wrong with men?

47
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:40,136
Does it feel good to touch
a random woman's butt?

48
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,095
When did I touch--

49
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:43,598
Do you enjoy disrobing in public?
Why take off your underwear?

50
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:44,807
What are you talking about?

51
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:47,185
Why would you go to a hotel
with another woman?

52
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:48,436
Hotel? When did I go to a hotel?

53
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:51,064
-What on earth is wrong with you guys?
-Why are you doing this to me?

54
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:53,566
Next stop is Sangsu Station.

55
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,777
-Excuse me. Could you...
-Doors will open on the right.

56
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,071
report him
to the subway security officers.

57
00:03:58,154 --> 00:03:59,614
-What?
-Sure.

58
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:03,243
-How disgusting!
-I'm not disgusting.

59
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:04,327
Why are you avoiding me?

60
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,621
Get out of my way! I have to get off.

61
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:07,789
Hey...

62
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,124
You don't need to report me.

63
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,709
Why are you poking me?

64
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:14,254
I didn't do it.

65
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:15,546
I really didn't do it.

66
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:17,465
For goodness' sake.

67
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:20,843
Gosh, I have to get off too.

68
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,523
Doors are closing.

69
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:36,901
Please, step back.

70
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:05,930
I forgot all about it for a few minutes
thanks to that pervert.

71
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:08,099
The reason I came here.

72
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:23,906
An anonymous text message I got
an hour ago.

73
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,283
YOUR BOYFRIEND IS IN THE JUNO HOTEL

74
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:26,409
What is this about?

75
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,084
It's very likely to be just a prank.

76
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:40,882
I should just go in
since I came all the way here.

77
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:42,777
Bong-hui.

78
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:04,799
I'm sorry I'm late.

79
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,093
It's rush hour, isn't it?

80
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:10,930
Don't take Sangsu-bound subway
on Line Six at this hour if possible.

81
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:13,683
You could meet a crazy woman there.

82
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:16,102
-"A crazy woman"?
-She's totally crazy.

83
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:19,272
Gosh, she made me look like a pervert.

84
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:21,315
"Pervert"? Who?

85
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,400
Me.

86
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:24,610
I had no idea.

87
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:27,029
I didn't know you were into those things.

88
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,948
I was wrongly accused of being a pervert

89
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:30,616
because of that crazy woman.

90
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,909
How did that happen?

91
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:35,496
I don't even know. She said
she can identify perverts right away.

92
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,999
-She can identify them?
-Why would she do that to me?

93
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:39,041
I'm not sure.

94
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,961
Here. Drink up.

95
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,107
Explain. What happened?

96
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:04,859
There's not much to explain.

97
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:07,320
I caught you with another woman
at a hotel,

98
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:08,905
and you have nothing to explain?

99
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:10,656
It's not what you think.

100
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,658
-Then, what is it?
-This is what's important.

101
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,244
I still love you a lot, Bong-hui.

102
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:17,455
I did make a mistake.

103
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:20,166
But my feelings for you haven't changed
at all.

104
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:21,709
-That's what matters.
-How many times?

105
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:23,294
-What?
-What you did today.

106
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:24,629
How many times have you done it?

107
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:27,924
You won't buy it if I say "first time,"
and if I say "many times," you'll be hurt.

108
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:29,967
Why would you ask such a question?

109
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,846
Frankly, I already knew

110
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:35,932
that something was up.

111
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:40,603
WHERE ARE YOU? ARE YOU BUSY?

112
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:43,105
It took longer and longer
for him to check my messages.

113
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,074
-Was someone else in your car?
-What?

114
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:57,411
Oh, was there? I can't really remember.

115
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,793
One day, I had a strange feeling
sitting in your car.

116
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:09,006
HUI-JUN

117
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:17,056
-Hey.
-Did you call me?

118
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:19,684
And he started taking longer
to call me back.

119
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:24,063
I knew that you've changed,
and that you got another girl.

120
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:27,650
I was aware of the fact
that you're a total jerk and a womanizer,

121
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,402
but I pretended not to notice.

122
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:32,488
I voluntarily let you fool me.

123
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,657
Anyway, I made a mistake.

124
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,367
I admit it. I'll never do it again.

125
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:40,037
-Shall I make a vow?
-Do you think this is a joke?

126
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:41,622
What do you want me to do?

127
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:44,417
At least take it seriously
and be honest, you jerk.

128
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:49,338
-I'm still young, Bong-hui.
-So?

129
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:51,841
Let's say that a nice girl is seducing me.

130
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:54,510
Not many men can resist such temptation.

131
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:56,262
That's why I made such a mistake.

132
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,973
It was just a one-night thing.

133
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:01,851
So, you're saying
that you couldn't help it

134
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:03,311
because you're a young man, right?

135
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:05,187
I'm saying I'll never repeat
the same mistake--

136
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:06,772
You mean you'll never get caught again.

137
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:09,775
That you'll be more careful next time,
you scum.

138
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,242
I said I'm sorry.

139
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:20,578
Am I supposed to let it go
because you're apologizing?

140
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:22,038
Is that it?

141
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:23,831
-Then, what? Shall we break up?
-No.

142
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:24,915
-You wait.
-What?

143
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:27,168
I'll decide whether we break up or not.

144
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:28,794
So, just wait for my verdict.

145
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:31,756
-Hey, Bong-Hui.
-Oh, right.

146
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:33,799
Let's make things equal first.

147
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,968
I'm still young too, just like you.

148
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:38,054
I should have one-night stands too.

149
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:41,057
Let's get even
before we talk about breaking up.

150
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:44,143
-You're a woman--
-What does that mean?

151
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:45,603
-What I'm saying is--
-Hey.

152
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:48,981
I'll sleep with the first guy
I run into on my way home.

153
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:50,566
-Bong-hui.
-Just watch.

154
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:51,817
I'll show you.

155
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:03,537
Goodness.

156
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:58,259
Stop being ridiculous, Eun Bong-hui.

157
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:05,975
Do you...

158
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:07,810
want to sleep with me?

159
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,231
Sure.

160
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:14,150
Let's do that.

161
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:22,241
Thank goodness.
You're young and good-looking.

162
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:25,828
Am I?

163
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:41,010
When did I touch...

164
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:42,094
What are you talking about?

165
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:44,096
"Hotel"? When did I go to a hotel?

166
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:45,806
The pervert from the subway?

167
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:48,225
What are you waiting for? Let's go.

168
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:51,729
Gosh, wait. Just a second.

169
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:53,606
Hey, wait! Stop!

170
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:56,317
Hey, wait. Stop right there, Bong-hui.

171
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,945
If you leave,
I'm really going to break up with you.

172
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,661
Let's go.

173
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,122
Wait.

174
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,544
That little...

175
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:28,015
I'm going to warn you
in case you thought I was serious.

176
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,558
I have a black belt in tae kwon do--

177
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,143
I'm seriously warning you, too.

178
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:32,811
-About what?
-I'm not...

179
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:34,939
a pervert.

180
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:36,649
-You're not?
-I'm not!

181
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:39,944
-You dragged me here to tell me that?
-You thought I wanted to sleep with you?

182
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:41,820
-Didn't you?
-Then I would've gotten a room.

183
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:43,948
Why would I come outside?
Can't you use your brain?

184
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:46,534
That was a bit too mean.
How could you say that?

185
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:48,369
Who's being mean right now?

186
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:51,664
You called me a pervert without any proof.

187
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:54,291
For the first time in my life,
I felt so embarrassed,

188
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,043
disgraced, and falsely accused!

189
00:13:57,878 --> 00:14:00,339
If I could have things my way,

190
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:02,925
I would love to do
the exact same thing to you.

191
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:07,471
But I'm a gentleman,
so, consider yourself lucky.

192
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:09,515
You really didn't touch me?

193
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:11,725
How many times do I have to tell you
that I didn't?

194
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:16,772
Anyway, stop accusing
innocent people from now on.

195
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:24,989
What's wrong with me?

196
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,787
And just for your safety,

197
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:35,624
don't run into random men from now on.

198
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,002
Some of them
might actually want to sleep with you.

199
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:43,966
Gosh, was I too cool?

200
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:48,387
Bong-hui!

201
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:53,058
Wait.

202
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:01,150
What? What are you doing?

203
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:03,903
-What's wrong with you?
-My gosh.

204
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:05,487
-What do you mean?
-What the--

205
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,406
Please, help me out a little more.

206
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:17,124
Let's go, sir.

207
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:39,438
I'm really sorry for everything.
And thank you.

208
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:40,522
Whatever.

209
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:43,776
I don't want to accept your apology
or gratitude.

210
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:44,902
I understand.

211
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:48,447
By the way, about earlier...

212
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:54,161
I don't normally ask random men
to sleep with me.

213
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:56,246
But I had to show him.

214
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,623
You don't need to explain.

215
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:03,212
Do you want to have a drink with me?

216
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:09,051
I don't mean anything by it.
You just seem very trustworthy.

217
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:12,012
I just want to apologize
and thank you for today.

218
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:13,389
-No, thank you.
-Okay.

219
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:20,980
Sir, please drop me off

220
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,190
anywhere over there.

221
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:30,299
Don't sit down.

222
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,010
I already did.

223
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:35,220
Stand up.

224
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:38,974
I feel bad for you drinking alone,
so I'm keeping you company.

225
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:40,350
Why do you play hard to get?

226
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:43,562
When did I ever tell you
that I'm in need of charity?

227
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,648
Normally, I'd be the one
feeling sorry for you.

228
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:47,858
You little...

229
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:49,735
TAE KWON DO LICENSE

230
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:52,738
Why aren't you leaving?

231
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:54,114
Should I leave?

232
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:06,418
I think...

233
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:10,756
you left this on purpose.

234
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:14,885
My gosh.

235
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:19,681
I'm so glad to see a familiar face.

236
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:26,105
Not a single person called or texted me.

237
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,566
I was so lonely, feeling like an outsider.

238
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:33,904
I only met you today,
but I'm so glad to see you.

239
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:38,575
I guess you really did leave this behind
on purpose.

240
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:40,285
Perhaps.

241
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,877
I was just going to give you this and...

242
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:53,173
What? Wait.

243
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,136
Cheers.

244
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:01,890
Jeez.

245
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,917
Do you want to sleep with me?

246
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,253
Sure.

247
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:33,130
Let's do that.

248
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,433
No, wait.

249
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:47,519
You said your limit was one bottle.
You're on your third bottle.

250
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:49,104
It is one bottle.

251
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:51,565
Not soju, but hard liquor.

252
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:01,408
My goodness, what is this?

253
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:03,035
Wait.

254
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:29,728
Do you live here?

255
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:33,398
Of course, not. I'm just taking a rest.

256
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:36,485
Just tell me where you live.

257
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:39,488
I don't have a house.

258
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:41,782
It's so expensive to buy a house in Seoul.

259
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:43,158
I'll buy one later.

260
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:53,752
Wait.

261
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:02,761
Let's go.

262
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:04,805
My gosh, let go of me.

263
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:10,852
Damn it.

264
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:31,999
Did I make the first move?

265
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:31,975
What should I do? What do I do
in this kind of situation?

266
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:41,777
Should I say hi? Apologize? Or thank him?

267
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:17,604
Oh, my.

268
00:23:19,397 --> 00:23:20,899
I really hate myself.

269
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:26,488
I'M SORRY

270
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,424
No missed calls.

271
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:47,926
No messages.

272
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:53,682
How could you not call me even once?

273
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:56,351
Even if we weren't in a relationship,

274
00:23:56,434 --> 00:23:59,104
you should've been worried about me
in a situation like yesterday's.

275
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:04,734
What good will it do?

276
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:07,320
He is the worst.

277
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:11,908
Did you sleep with her?

278
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:13,577
Thirty-one missed calls.

279
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:14,786
You slept with her, didn't you?

280
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:18,498
I had 31 missed calls
from one particular person.

281
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:19,624
Hey.

282
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,793
I really wanted to know.

283
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,546
I was wondering what happened
after you two left like that.

284
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:26,339
I couldn't get a wink of sleep.

285
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:28,717
Did you spend a passionate night?

286
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:32,888
Did you know her from before?

287
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:35,557
I don't think it was your first time
meeting her.

288
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,518
Well... That's a bit hard to say.

289
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:41,646
So, did you sleep with her?

290
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:42,731
I don't know.

291
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:46,776
Hey, I'm just really curious.

292
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:51,698
You have never had any physical
or emotional interaction with women

293
00:24:51,781 --> 00:24:53,825
ever since Yu-jeong.

294
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:55,952
Goodness. Look at you now.

295
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:57,829
You slept with her, right?

296
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:00,081
I think it's time we hang up. Bye.

297
00:25:00,707 --> 00:25:02,000
END CALL

298
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:31,089
That feeling...

299
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:35,552
I'll decide whether we break up or not.

300
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:37,345
So, just wait for my verdict.

301
00:26:38,638 --> 00:26:40,098
-Hey, Bong-hui.
-Oh, right.

302
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:42,434
Let's make things equal first.

303
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:45,562
I'm still young too, just like you.

304
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:47,689
I should have one-night stands too.

305
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:50,817
Let's get even
before we talk about breaking up.

306
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:54,779
-Bong-hui.
-Just watch.

307
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:56,239
I'll show you.

308
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:12,714
Whoever it is,
someone please take me away from here.

309
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:15,967
No, I want to disappear forever.

310
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:17,302
At that moment,

311
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:20,472
I knew how desperate she felt.

312
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:35,070
Do you...

313
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:36,821
want to sleep with me?

314
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:38,156
Sure.

315
00:27:38,948 --> 00:27:40,200
Let's do that.

316
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:41,826
I did something stupid.

317
00:27:43,244 --> 00:27:45,872
This is bothersome. Gosh.

318
00:27:52,295 --> 00:27:53,338
You are here early.

319
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:54,464
Hey.

320
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:56,925
Did something happen?

321
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:58,301
What? No.

322
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:01,012
Oh, I met Ji-uk yesterday.

323
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:03,098
He won't resign his job as a prosecutor.

324
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:04,766
His dream is to die as a prosecutor.

325
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:07,268
Besides, I work here. He won't work here.

326
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:09,896
Are you still not friends?

327
00:28:11,689 --> 00:28:13,483
I'm taking a few more pro bono cases.

328
00:28:13,566 --> 00:28:16,236
PRO BONO: PROVIDING FREE LEGAL SERVICES
FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD

329
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:20,031
Eun-hyeok.
Are you trying to be a politician?

330
00:28:21,991 --> 00:28:24,828
By the way, we should congratulate Ji-uk.

331
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:26,204
For what?

332
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:30,125
Korean Bar Association conducted
an evaluation of prosecutors.

333
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:34,295
Reviewing this year's investigations
and trials, the association released

334
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:36,965
a list of ten best prosecutors

335
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:39,175
and also the worst prosecutors.

336
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:40,343
This list will be sent

337
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:43,638
to the Minister of Justice
and the Public Prosecutor General.

338
00:28:44,305 --> 00:28:46,182
Prosecutors are reviewed
by a standardized criteria

339
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:48,476
divided into six categories.

340
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,644
Each category was

341
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:52,605
-graded on a scale of one to five.
-Mr. Noh, you are the best.

342
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:55,108
What are you doing this early morning?

343
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:56,776
Chief and Deputy, sirs?

344
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:59,320
Gosh, you are the pride of our office.

345
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:00,572
-Am I?
-No.

346
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,032
You are the worst prosecutor.

347
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:07,579
-That's great.
-What?

348
00:29:07,662 --> 00:29:09,289
-What?
-That little...

349
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:13,251
It's an honor.
The fact that lawyers hate me

350
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:15,837
proves that I do my job well
as a prosecutor.

351
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,213
You are clueless.

352
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:18,840
You're missing the point.

353
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:20,842
You are a prosecutor
who ignores human rights,

354
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:23,094
and uses coercive measures
with great bias.

355
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:25,764
It means you're a prosecutor
associated with every negative word

356
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:27,348
you can think of.

357
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:30,351
I really hate criminals

358
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:33,688
and I despise the lawyers who defend them
and claim their human rights.

359
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:35,231
And those people don't like me?

360
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:37,609
That's the best form of honor.

361
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:40,320
-It's not just the lawyers.
-We don't like you as well.

362
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:43,072
Hey, look.

363
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:48,036
How come there is not a single letter
of gratitude for your service on the wall?

364
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:50,997
Other prosecutors receive
so many of those letters.

365
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,207
"Thank you, Prosecutor.

366
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:54,751
Thanks to you, I can lead a new life."

367
00:29:54,834 --> 00:29:57,378
But how can yours be so clean?

368
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:59,964
Did you put up a new wallpaper yesterday?

369
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:03,468
Dear Prosecutor Noh Ji-uk.

370
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:05,553
Thank you so much.

371
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:10,141
This is my first time writing a letter
in my 70 years of life.

372
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:15,021
I am Jang from Jincheon,
North Chungcheong Province.

373
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:17,732
"Last time, you stuck a drill
in my land..."

374
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:18,983
PROSECUTOR NOH JI-UK

375
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:29,911
BELOVED MOM

376
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:31,830
When did she change this?

377
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:35,124
-Hello?
-Ji-uk.

378
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:37,460
Mr. Byeon told me.

379
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:39,504
You were selected as the worst prosecutor?

380
00:30:39,587 --> 00:30:40,588
I'm hanging up now.

381
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:46,427
Gosh, he's so cold and stubborn.

382
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:51,349
He was selected as the worst prosecutor
because he plays by the book.

383
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:53,351
I heard that's not how they're selected.

384
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:55,520
What would you know about that?

385
00:30:57,105 --> 00:31:01,818
My daughter is in a legal profession too,
so I saw and heard a few things.

386
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:03,945
Your daughter is in a legal profession?

387
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:06,155
Didn't I tell you?

388
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:09,659
She's a rookie at the Judicial Research
and Training Institute.

389
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:11,411
Why are there so many of them these days?

390
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:14,122
Prosecutors, judges, and lawyers.

391
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:17,250
Even insignificant people
can be in the law profession.

392
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:20,253
How insignificant is he?

393
00:31:20,336 --> 00:31:22,755
-What?
-You said insignificant people.

394
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:25,341
-So, how insignificant is your son?
-Hey.

395
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,845
My name isn't, "Hey." It's Director Park.

396
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:31,180
People with manners call me that.

397
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:33,892
I don't care what your title is.

398
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:37,353
Hey, you can't compare my son,

399
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:40,148
Prosecutor Noh,
to those insignificant people.

400
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:44,569
He was special from birth, you know.

401
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:47,363
Even before his first birthday,
he walked and ran.

402
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:48,656
He even rode on a horse.

403
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,867
He learned Korean all by himself
from watching TV shows

404
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:54,203
when he was about three years old.

405
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:57,832
When he was five years old,
he played musical instruments perfectly.

406
00:31:57,916 --> 00:32:00,001
-My goodness.
-Gosh.

407
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:02,462
Hey!

408
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:11,262
Hui-jun, that jerk,
didn't even call me once.

409
00:32:14,557 --> 00:32:16,351
Everything is a total mess.

410
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:20,730
I can't even remember if I slept
with the guy from the subway.

411
00:32:20,813 --> 00:32:22,023
I heard you slept with someone.

412
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:25,068
You had a steamy night with a stranger.

413
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:26,319
How did you know?

414
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:29,113
Is it obvious?

415
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:31,449
I heard Hui-jun dumped you
because you had a one-night stand.

416
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:34,285
I didn't. Hui-jun is the one who--

417
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:36,788
The word has already spread
via the group chat.

418
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,502
THAT'S WHY BONG-HUI'S DUMPED?
HOW PATHETIC

419
00:32:42,585 --> 00:32:43,544
WAN-HUI: HUI-JUN CAUGHT HER

420
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:45,004
HO-JIN: IS THAT WHY?

421
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:47,507
DID SHE GET DUMPED?

422
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:49,300
SHE CHEATED ON THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S
SON?

423
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:54,222
Gosh, this is crazy.

424
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:58,559
We're practically public officials
as we get paid with tax money.

425
00:32:58,851 --> 00:33:02,730
Instead of being a role model for others,
you're enjoying a promiscuous sex life.

426
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:04,941
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

427
00:33:05,441 --> 00:33:07,819
Anyway, those who have one-night stands,

428
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:11,406
or those who frequent brothels
should all be dismissed.

429
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:15,368
How did she know
that we went to those places?

430
00:33:15,451 --> 00:33:18,454
-She's not talking about us, so be quiet.
-It wasn't about us?

431
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:20,498
You have no shame.

432
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:23,835
Why is it that I have to feel ashamed
for you?

433
00:33:23,918 --> 00:33:25,336
Stop it, Ji-hae.

434
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:28,214
Why? Do you feel guilty?

435
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,049
It's not like that.

436
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:32,218
Don't talk about things
you don't really know about.

437
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:33,219
I can do whatever I want.

438
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:43,479
-Pork bulgogi with rice.
-That's the best.

439
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:14,153
Hui-jun, it's really over--

440
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:16,823
Remember that day at the hotel?

441
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:18,324
I dumped you.

442
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:20,409
Things between us ended that day.

443
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:23,204
Well... I was going to say it first--

444
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:26,249
I'm so disappointed in you, Bong-hui.

445
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:29,377
Gosh.

446
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:36,801
Goodness, did he just make me
the bad person?

447
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:40,721
Hey, you asshole!

448
00:35:42,765 --> 00:35:43,808
What on earth…

449
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:10,918
It's so dark, just like my life.

450
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:14,964
Hey, this is why your boyfriend
dumped you. Do you know that?

451
00:36:15,047 --> 00:36:17,008
You're such a moron!

452
00:36:17,091 --> 00:36:19,969
Life is a real game, you idiot!

453
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:21,387
Hey!

454
00:36:25,224 --> 00:36:26,475
I think he hit me.

455
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:29,061
You got hit? By who? Who hit you?

456
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:32,565
Well, I had a dream and...

457
00:36:32,648 --> 00:36:35,443
No. I can't figure out
whether it's a dream or not.

458
00:36:36,485 --> 00:36:39,572
I knew it. I'd believe you more
if you say you hit someone.

459
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:43,075
When did you get home?

460
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:44,952
Let me see.

461
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:50,082
You were burning up with a fever.

462
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:52,460
I woke you up and gave you medicine.

463
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:53,586
You did?

464
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:56,130
I'm fine now.

465
00:36:58,382 --> 00:36:59,425
Mom.

466
00:37:00,968 --> 00:37:01,969
What happened?

467
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:05,556
Nothing happened.

468
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:08,893
You can't fool me.

469
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:11,854
I did very badly on the exam.

470
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:15,024
That's why you got sick? You?

471
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:17,735
When other kids went to the hospital
a dozen times,

472
00:37:17,818 --> 00:37:19,654
you didn't see a doctor even once.

473
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:23,282
Everyone in our neighborhood told me
that you're as strong as steel.

474
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:27,119
What are you talking about?
Studying is really hard.

475
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:29,664
I thought I just had to pass the bar exam,

476
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:31,874
but I have to study even harder now.

477
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:33,042
It's never-ending.

478
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:35,711
You're right.

479
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:40,216
Nothing has a definite end.
Everything is never-ending.

480
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:43,886
Is Hui-jun giving you a hard time?

481
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:49,642
I dumped him.

482
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:56,065
Good. It's only right to dump guys
if they bring tears to your eyes.

483
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:03,948
Mom.

484
00:38:06,158 --> 00:38:09,078
I'm going to focus on studying
and working hard.

485
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:13,541
I'll become a high-rolling lawyer,
so that you can live a better life.

486
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:16,585
I should make you write a pledge.

487
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:19,171
Shall I notarize it for you?

488
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:21,048
That'd be great.

489
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:22,550
"That'd be great."

490
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:25,636
Gosh, this is nice.

491
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,731
THREE MONTHS LATER

492
00:38:37,189 --> 00:38:38,566
Yes, it's probationary.

493
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:40,943
Yes, I told you I'll receive
two-month training

494
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:43,654
as a prosecutor, judge and lawyer.
I'm starting as a prosecutor.

495
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:47,533
Yes. Right.

496
00:38:48,242 --> 00:38:50,286
Okay. You too, Mom.

497
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:56,917
SEONHO DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

498
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:58,836
It's too good a day to be here!

499
00:38:58,919 --> 00:39:01,255
-Did you even sober up?
-Do I reek of alcohol?

500
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:03,382
-Alcohol isn't what's important--
-Hello.

501
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:04,467
Hey, you.

502
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,804
Look at that. They're always together now.

503
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:11,682
They're testing the waters.
That's what they said.

504
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:14,435
You guys didn't know?
They've been like that for a while now.

505
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:16,103
What are you going to do?

506
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:19,607
Bong-hui, shall I go out with you?
What do you say?

507
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:21,233
Hey, I'll see you later.

508
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:31,619
Just like that, I became a girl who got
dumped after having a one-night stand.

509
00:39:32,161 --> 00:39:35,247
It was almost impossible to stop the rumor
once it spread.

510
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:38,084
Hence, I decided to rather
be the crazy woman.

511
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:39,960
-Isn't it so funny?
-Yes.

512
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:42,671
Excuse me!

513
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:50,054
Watch me cursing you

514
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:52,181
You'd better remember

515
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:55,518
Because I'll be sure to kill you

516
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:14,453
PROSECUTOR NOH JI-UK

517
00:40:18,707 --> 00:40:21,377
It's time to forget being the crazy woman.

518
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:23,796
As of this moment, I'm starting fresh.

519
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:34,056
It's nice to meet you all.

520
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:36,350
I'm the new probationary
judicial officer, Eun Bong-hui.

521
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:37,893
I look forward to working with you.

522
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:40,980
The new probationary officer
is very enthusiastic.

523
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:55,995
Do you want to sleep with me?

524
00:40:56,078 --> 00:40:57,079
Let's do that.

525
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:59,206
The world is a scary place!

526
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:02,001
Get your act together, seriously!

527
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:03,669
Hey!

528
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:09,717
So, you're new.

529
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:15,764
You look familiar though.

530
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:19,977
Well, I'm not sure
what you're talking about.

531
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:22,313
Do you take the Line Six subway often?

532
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:25,483
No, I usually take buses, walk or bike.

533
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:27,818
I see. Do you go to hotels
from time to time?

534
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:29,403
No, I usually go to motels.

535
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:31,238
Motels, yes.

536
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:32,364
She says, motels.

537
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:35,493
Why did you run off in the morning?

538
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:37,995
Then, was I supposed
to stay for breakfast?

539
00:41:39,371 --> 00:41:41,999
I'm not sure. I don't know
what you're talking about.

540
00:41:42,082 --> 00:41:43,125
Stop being so brazen.

541
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:45,836
You're worse than the suspects
I've interrogated.

542
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:50,049
Then, is it okay to fool me like that
when you already know everything?

543
00:41:50,132 --> 00:41:51,300
I was just testing you.

544
00:41:51,383 --> 00:41:54,178
I was testing your honesty,
transparency, memory, and so on.

545
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:58,140
-I do remember one thing.
-What is it?

546
00:41:58,224 --> 00:42:00,017
There was this pervert who touched--

547
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,602
I told you that it wasn't me.

548
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:04,146
My goodness. I never said it was you.

549
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:12,071
I've never seen someone
so ungrateful like you.

550
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:13,781
I do feel grateful,

551
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:16,700
but you don't really need to talk
as if you did something so grand.

552
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:19,245
I'm actually wondering if you know
that I'm your mentor

553
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:21,038
and that you're my mentee.

554
00:42:21,121 --> 00:42:23,707
Yes, I already know that I'm done for.

555
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:26,752
Since I'm already done for,

556
00:42:26,835 --> 00:42:28,170
let me ask you a question.

557
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:29,255
Go ahead.

558
00:42:33,342 --> 00:42:35,261
I'd like to ask you in private.

559
00:42:37,012 --> 00:42:38,055
Just ask me.

560
00:42:38,138 --> 00:42:41,016
Unlike you, I'm an honest person
who doesn't hide anything.

561
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,185
Did we sleep together or not?

562
00:42:50,859 --> 00:42:52,611
Don't be mistaken.
She's not talking about us.

563
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:53,904
Don't write this down.

564
00:42:54,863 --> 00:42:56,115
Yeah, you're really honest.

565
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:58,367
One more thing. You hit me, didn't you?

566
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:00,869
-You hit me on both cheeks.
-I never hit you!

567
00:43:07,167 --> 00:43:09,211
-Let's not spread rumors.
-I'll try my best.

568
00:43:12,464 --> 00:43:13,507
What rumor?

569
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:15,551
You must be mistaken.
I never said such a thing.

570
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:18,429
-Did something happen to Ji-uk?
-No.

571
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:19,972
My gosh.

572
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:22,808
I told you. Nothing happened to him.

573
00:43:22,891 --> 00:43:24,810
Plus, you're not allowed to enter

574
00:43:24,893 --> 00:43:26,729
unless you have any serious business.

575
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:30,983
My gosh, I'm sorry. Are you okay?

576
00:43:31,066 --> 00:43:32,651
Don't ever apologize to him.

577
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:34,653
What? Of course, I should apologize.

578
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:36,864
Aren't you supposed to listen
to your mentor?

579
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:40,367
It's been a while.

580
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:43,287
Do we have any cases that needs Lawyer Ji?

581
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:45,831
But why is he in front of me right now?

582
00:43:45,914 --> 00:43:49,001
My goodness.
This is why you're so unpopular.

583
00:43:49,084 --> 00:43:52,588
By the way, I voted you
as the best prosecutor, not the worst.

584
00:43:52,671 --> 00:43:53,839
I'm being serious.

585
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:56,550
I'm going to introduce her
to the chief and deputy.

586
00:43:57,301 --> 00:43:58,302
Follow me.

587
00:43:58,969 --> 00:43:59,970
See you later, sir.

588
00:44:03,932 --> 00:44:05,017
You got us in trouble.

589
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:17,029
Apparently, I was the craziest girl
at our training institute.

590
00:44:17,112 --> 00:44:19,990
People think I'm crazier now because
they think I seduced my mentor.

591
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:21,700
This is all thanks to you.

592
00:44:21,784 --> 00:44:24,203
I was already assessed
as the worst prosecutor.

593
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:29,333
But now, I became a violent pervert
who slaps his mentee across the face.

594
00:44:29,416 --> 00:44:30,626
Is that so?

595
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:33,170
So, tell me. Did we sleep together or not?

596
00:44:33,253 --> 00:44:35,005
I really can't remember anything.

597
00:44:37,424 --> 00:44:39,593
A woman throws herself at me.

598
00:44:40,886 --> 00:44:43,180
On top of that,
I had a couple of drinks that night,

599
00:44:43,263 --> 00:44:45,349
and I'm not exactly a saint.

600
00:44:45,474 --> 00:44:47,059
-I guess we slept together.
-I'm not a saint,

601
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:48,936
but I do have eyes
that work perfectly fine.

602
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:52,648
To me, you're not really that attractive.

603
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:54,358
So, what happened?

604
00:45:01,615 --> 00:45:02,616
I don't know.

605
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:04,952
It's not heavy, right?

606
00:45:10,457 --> 00:45:11,917
Of course, not.

607
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:13,460
It's not heavy at all.

608
00:45:14,503 --> 00:45:18,966
Let me tell you.
There are two kinds of mentors.

609
00:45:19,299 --> 00:45:22,469
The first kind is a fair mentor
who only gives his or her mentee

610
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:24,805
just the right amount of workload.
It sounds nice right?

611
00:45:25,472 --> 00:45:28,100
The second kind is the worst
you could ever imagine.

612
00:45:28,183 --> 00:45:32,062
They dump all sorts of work
on their mentees.

613
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:35,274
They dump all sorts of work on you,
as if you're their personal assistant.

614
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:37,568
They ask their mentees to do everything.

615
00:45:40,654 --> 00:45:42,906
Bong-hui, where are you looking at?

616
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:45,451
Listen to me. Don't worry, okay?

617
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:48,245
Most of the mentors are pretty normal
like the first kind.

618
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:50,706
The worst ones are really rare.

619
00:45:50,789 --> 00:45:52,458
I just wanted to tell you this.

620
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:08,265
I can do it!

621
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:21,695
Hello.

622
00:46:21,778 --> 00:46:24,031
This is
Seonho District Prosecutors' Office.

623
00:46:24,698 --> 00:46:27,075
No, I'm not voice phishing.

624
00:46:28,744 --> 00:46:31,330
You need to come
to the District Prosecutors' Office.

625
00:46:38,086 --> 00:46:40,839
But keep in mind that the worst ones
are still very logical.

626
00:46:42,799 --> 00:46:43,800
Love.

627
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:46,970
I'm showing my love and care for you

628
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:49,515
to let you broaden your experience.

629
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:55,270
-Thank you.
-Of course, you should thank me.

630
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:57,940
From now on, you'll be working
not only on suspect interrogation,

631
00:46:58,023 --> 00:46:59,733
but also on the criminal mediation.

632
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:01,151
How about it?

633
00:47:01,818 --> 00:47:03,445
-All right.
-Are you happy?

634
00:47:04,071 --> 00:47:05,113
Do your best.

635
00:47:12,246 --> 00:47:15,290
Why did you enter the women's bath naked?

636
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:18,377
I don't know. I can't hear you.
I don't remember.

637
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:20,379
I know you can hear me,
and you remember everything.

638
00:47:20,462 --> 00:47:22,965
I don't know. I can't hear you.
I don't remember.

639
00:47:23,048 --> 00:47:24,550
-Sir!
-I don't know.

640
00:47:24,883 --> 00:47:26,134
I can't hear you. I don't remember.

641
00:47:26,218 --> 00:47:27,386
Please.

642
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:30,013
Are you even human?
How can you do this as my friend?

643
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:32,182
How can you secretly date
my younger sister?

644
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:34,226
Why can't I date her? I love her.

645
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:36,019
Excuse me.

646
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:38,230
-You guys both got charged with assault.
-You bastard.

647
00:47:38,313 --> 00:47:40,357
You shouldn't be fighting here!

648
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:41,483
Let go of me!

649
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:44,653
-You little...
-Let go.

650
00:47:44,736 --> 00:47:46,113
-Let go of me.
-You let go.

651
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:47,948
-I grabbed you first.
-Let go!

652
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:49,992
You should let go of me first! Let go!

653
00:47:50,075 --> 00:47:52,035
Excuse me. You shouldn't be
doing this here.

654
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:53,120
-You little...
-Excuse me.

655
00:47:53,203 --> 00:47:55,372
-Please, stop!
-Get out of my face!

656
00:47:56,081 --> 00:47:58,375
-Let go of my hair!
-My goodness.

657
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:17,019
I'm not done yet.

658
00:48:18,645 --> 00:48:19,563
Hello.

659
00:48:26,028 --> 00:48:28,405
Thank you for admitting to your crime.

660
00:48:29,615 --> 00:48:33,577
But then again, you got caught in the act,
and you have priors.

661
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:36,830
-Yes.
-What is wrong with everyone?

662
00:48:37,289 --> 00:48:39,207
What good comes from being a pervert?

663
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:45,672
-But haven't we...
-I'm sure...

664
00:48:48,216 --> 00:48:49,509
I've seen you somewhere.

665
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:50,636
Excuse me.

666
00:48:50,927 --> 00:48:54,556
Could you please report him
to the subway security officers?

667
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:56,058
Sure.

668
00:48:56,975 --> 00:48:59,978
It was you. You're the one
who touched me, aren't you?

669
00:49:04,107 --> 00:49:06,234
I didn't know you were a prosecutor.

670
00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:08,612
What a coincidence.

671
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:12,407
My gosh, because of you...

672
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:14,117
This is all because of you!

673
00:49:15,952 --> 00:49:18,914
You're a habitual offender,
so you're going to go to prison.

674
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:23,418
But the judge never really sent me
to prison.

675
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:25,629
I always got fined instead.

676
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:27,673
Let's see about that.

677
00:49:30,425 --> 00:49:33,428
I don't mind going to prison.

678
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,892
To be honest, I think...

679
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:43,230
I witnessed a murder incident.
I'm in danger because of that.

680
00:49:44,314 --> 00:49:45,565
I'm serious.

681
00:50:01,873 --> 00:50:06,294
That day, like any other day,

682
00:50:06,795 --> 00:50:09,005
I was observing the stars.

683
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:10,382
Sure you were.

684
00:50:10,465 --> 00:50:11,466
But...

685
00:50:12,718 --> 00:50:14,386
That's it.

686
00:50:15,095 --> 00:50:16,138
Go on.

687
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:43,540
Ever since that day, I can't sleep
at night because I'm worried

688
00:50:43,665 --> 00:50:45,375
that he might come to kill me.

689
00:50:47,794 --> 00:50:49,296
-Mr. Bang.
-Yes?

690
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:51,214
Take him out of here.

691
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:55,677
If you ever get arrested again
for touching anyone

692
00:50:55,802 --> 00:50:58,805
or peeking through other people's
windows, I won't let you go.

693
00:51:01,641 --> 00:51:02,642
Get out of here.

694
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:11,651
My goodness.

695
00:51:20,869 --> 00:51:22,162
Goodness gracious.

696
00:51:23,997 --> 00:51:25,874
What an ugly sight.

697
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:32,422
Watch me cursing you

698
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:38,470
You'd better remember
Because I'll be sure to kill you

699
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:44,017
-Would you stop it?
-Why?

700
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:46,478
Is singing banned in this country?

701
00:51:46,561 --> 00:51:49,481
I know that you are singing this
on purpose, so that we hear you.

702
00:51:49,815 --> 00:51:50,774
By the way, I heard that

703
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:53,985
you threw yourself on the prosecutor
to make a good impression.

704
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:56,488
What right do you have to criticize us?

705
00:51:57,364 --> 00:52:00,283
That's enough. Her trick didn't even work.

706
00:52:01,409 --> 00:52:03,245
Try to wash your hair regularly though.

707
00:52:05,497 --> 00:52:06,498
Let's go.

708
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:09,918
Ms. Eun, I've been looking for you.

709
00:52:10,001 --> 00:52:12,045
I was about to go in. Give me a minute.

710
00:52:14,881 --> 00:52:17,342
I... I missed you.

711
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:29,980
It's only been a couple of minutes.

712
00:52:31,106 --> 00:52:32,148
Excuse me?

713
00:52:35,026 --> 00:52:37,904
Ms. Eun, you are...

714
00:52:38,446 --> 00:52:39,698
How should I say this?

715
00:52:41,283 --> 00:52:43,285
You are dirty, yet beautiful.

716
00:52:44,536 --> 00:52:45,537
Pardon me?

717
00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:50,375
Do people know...

718
00:52:51,459 --> 00:52:52,460
that...

719
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:54,796
I...

720
00:52:56,089 --> 00:52:57,674
fell for you at first sight?

721
00:52:57,841 --> 00:52:58,967
What?

722
00:53:16,401 --> 00:53:18,403
You are pretty.

723
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:21,531
But you're dirty, and yet so pretty.

724
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:26,453
Let's go.

725
00:53:33,793 --> 00:53:34,920
Gosh.

726
00:53:36,922 --> 00:53:38,548
You are so dirty.

727
00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:40,717
Goodness.

728
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:44,179
I don't know what I'm doing.

729
00:53:49,935 --> 00:53:53,104
Singing a song of curse
is not how you take revenge on your ex.

730
00:53:56,232 --> 00:53:57,609
Just ignore him.

731
00:53:58,234 --> 00:54:00,570
Be cool and live a good life.

732
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:04,407
Chew it.

733
00:54:12,707 --> 00:54:13,708
What is it?

734
00:54:16,002 --> 00:54:17,003
Why...

735
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:20,757
Why are you suddenly so good to me?
You're scaring me.

736
00:54:22,801 --> 00:54:24,678
Did you really fall for me at first...

737
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:26,429
I'm sorry. Of course, you didn't.

738
00:54:26,513 --> 00:54:29,140
Eun Bong-hui. At least, wash your face.

739
00:55:01,589 --> 00:55:02,716
Wake up.

740
00:55:04,259 --> 00:55:06,136
Hey, wake up!

741
00:55:07,762 --> 00:55:09,556
When people find out
they've been cheated on,

742
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:10,849
they start to doubt themselves.

743
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:13,977
They start to wonder
if they did something wrong

744
00:55:14,310 --> 00:55:16,646
or if they were cheated on
because they were not worthy of love.

745
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:18,606
They even wonder
if they contributed to what happened.

746
00:55:19,524 --> 00:55:22,652
I understand what you are going through.
I was in your place once.

747
00:55:23,069 --> 00:55:24,070
But...

748
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:28,199
That is not true.
We didn't do anything wrong.

749
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:30,827
Those who betrayed us are at fault.

750
00:55:49,971 --> 00:55:53,058
He didn't slap me after all.

751
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:11,951
He was betrayed just like I was.

752
00:56:12,535 --> 00:56:14,079
That's why he was nice to me.

753
00:56:15,705 --> 00:56:16,706
Ms. Eun.

754
00:56:17,165 --> 00:56:18,833
I wasn't looking at you.

755
00:56:18,917 --> 00:56:21,920
I know. You can go home
and sleep at your house tonight.

756
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:24,214
-I'm fine.
-Go take a shower.

757
00:56:24,547 --> 00:56:27,300
I'd like to work in a clean environment
free of odors.

758
00:56:28,093 --> 00:56:29,344
I see.

759
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:33,765
Sometimes...

760
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:38,603
I find you so annoying
that I want to get rid of you, you know?

761
00:56:38,686 --> 00:56:40,105
The feeling is mutual.

762
00:56:46,361 --> 00:56:49,155
If I get through this period...

763
00:56:50,115 --> 00:56:52,951
as a probationary judicial officer,

764
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:56,579
without you getting killed by me,

765
00:56:56,704 --> 00:56:57,580
I'll treat you to a meal.

766
00:56:57,664 --> 00:57:00,208
Get through this without killing anyone.
Then, I'll compliment you.

767
00:57:01,126 --> 00:57:02,710
Can't you take a joke?

768
00:57:02,794 --> 00:57:04,504
I meant your ex-boyfriend, not me.

769
00:57:04,587 --> 00:57:07,674
You went around and sang a song
about how you will kill him.

770
00:57:07,757 --> 00:57:09,509
Stop singing that song
and threatening him.

771
00:57:10,635 --> 00:57:12,804
-Yes.
-I am a ruthless prosecutor.

772
00:57:13,513 --> 00:57:15,807
Please, just don't come to my office
as a suspect.

773
00:57:15,890 --> 00:57:17,892
-Yes.
-You're good at following orders.

774
00:57:23,606 --> 00:57:27,610
Thank you for helping me
get back at my ex-boyfriend.

775
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:29,404
Work hard if you want to return the favor.

776
00:57:30,196 --> 00:57:31,531
Sure.

777
00:57:45,378 --> 00:57:47,464
-Are you going home now?
-It's none of your business.

778
00:57:50,675 --> 00:57:52,427
Is it hard to get over me?

779
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:53,970
-What?
-You...

780
00:57:54,345 --> 00:57:57,474
You are flirting with the prosecutor
to get back at me.

781
00:57:57,557 --> 00:57:58,766
What are you talking about?

782
00:57:58,850 --> 00:57:59,934
Hey, Bong-hui.

783
00:58:00,018 --> 00:58:03,146
You know what? That's right.
I did it to get back at you,

784
00:58:03,229 --> 00:58:05,023
but I am not doing that now.

785
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:08,651
You are just a drag
of my numerous past memories.

786
00:58:08,776 --> 00:58:10,069
So, stop being so full of yourself.

787
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:14,782
Right, I have some of your stuff at home.

788
00:58:14,866 --> 00:58:17,744
Should I throw them out
or will you pick them up? Think about it.

789
00:58:20,288 --> 00:58:22,499
Don't deny your feelings, Bong-hui.

790
00:58:23,666 --> 00:58:24,876
Bullshit.

791
00:58:28,713 --> 00:58:32,217
When I was young,
I wanted to be someone greater.

792
00:58:32,842 --> 00:58:33,843
However...

793
00:58:35,428 --> 00:58:36,471
It's getting hot.

794
00:58:50,443 --> 00:58:53,071
Gosh, this is refreshing.

795
00:58:59,786 --> 00:59:03,456
I don't think I turned out that bad.

796
00:59:07,919 --> 00:59:10,880
My opinion will change soon though.

797
00:59:27,855 --> 00:59:30,441
What is this? A blackout?

798
00:59:37,782 --> 00:59:38,783
How much is it?

799
00:59:39,367 --> 00:59:41,786
Since the power is out,
you can only pay with cash.

800
00:59:42,537 --> 00:59:43,538
All right.

801
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:46,708
It's 17,000 won, please.

802
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:50,837
This cash transaction that left no record.

803
00:59:51,546 --> 00:59:54,132
The surveillance cameras
that stopped due to the blackout.

804
00:59:54,924 --> 00:59:56,968
The part-timer who doesn't remember me.

805
01:00:00,638 --> 01:00:03,474
No one will remember me.

806
01:00:06,561 --> 01:00:09,939
Beer.

807
01:00:13,526 --> 01:00:14,527
Gosh!

808
01:00:18,906 --> 01:00:19,907
Hui-jun?

809
01:00:23,036 --> 01:00:25,204
Hey, Hui-jun. Hey!

810
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:53,775
What...

811
01:01:15,588 --> 01:01:18,466
Therefore, my alibi...

812
01:01:18,925 --> 01:01:20,009
has disappeared.

813
01:01:23,388 --> 01:01:25,348
JANG HUI-JUN, MY EX-BOYFRIEND, WAS...

814
01:01:36,484 --> 01:01:38,277
I'm pretty sure I told you

815
01:01:39,153 --> 01:01:41,155
not to show up before me as a suspect.

816
01:01:41,239 --> 01:01:42,240
I...

817
01:01:43,825 --> 01:01:44,951
I'm a ruthless prosecutor.

818
01:01:45,284 --> 01:01:46,536
I grew up

819
01:01:47,078 --> 01:01:48,621
and became a murder suspect.

820
01:02:01,217 --> 01:02:02,468
You have finally done it.

821
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:03,761
Come here. Hey!

822
01:02:03,845 --> 01:02:04,846
Did you kill him?

823
01:02:04,971 --> 01:02:07,390
What's important is
that Eun Bong-hui is the culprit.

824
01:02:07,473 --> 01:02:08,683
I really didn't do it.

825
01:02:08,766 --> 01:02:09,976
Things like that don't matter.

826
01:02:10,059 --> 01:02:12,562
You're not going to give in?
Do you want to convict her?

827
01:02:12,645 --> 01:02:14,647
What's your relationship with her?

828
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:16,691
-It's fate.
-I trust you.

829
01:02:16,774 --> 01:02:18,276
The fact that you trust me,

830
01:02:18,359 --> 01:02:19,694
and that you're on my side.

831
01:02:19,777 --> 01:02:21,946
I would like to suggest
suitable punishment for the defendant.

832
01:02:22,029 --> 01:02:24,657
According to Article 250
of the Criminal Code,

833
01:02:24,741 --> 01:02:28,202
I ask that she be sentenced to 15 years
in prison for the first-degree murder.

834
01:02:30,455 --> 01:02:32,457
