1
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,320
The same goes for me.

2
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:36,197
I have...

3
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:37,991
two dads.

4
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:39,117
Really?

5
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:42,036
I'll tell you my story next time

6
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:43,496
when I have the chance.

7
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:49,544
I'm not so comfortable either...

8
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:54,424
My dad also passed away
due to a fire accident.

9
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:16,589
It smells nice.

10
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:21,010
Did you sleep well?

11
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:23,012
Yes.

12
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:24,430
Did you sleep well?

13
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:25,556
Yes.

14
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:34,983
But why are you cooking so much food?

15
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,111
You're right.

16
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,049
Hey.

17
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:03,845
Are you two trying to kill me
or something?

18
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:07,890
Ms. Eun must've cooked this. Am I right?

19
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:10,059
I'm sure it wasn't Mr. Noh
who cooked this.

20
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:12,228
No, it wasn't me.

21
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,732
But it looks delicious. Does it taste bad?

22
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:21,654
You lack in so many ways.

23
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,907
I already heard everything.

24
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:27,118
I wasn't going to oppose
to your relationship,

25
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:29,704
but I really can't approve of you.

26
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,000
I really didn't cook this.

27
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:55,396
I started a fire in Dobu-dong
two years ago,

28
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,106
and someone died.

29
00:05:57,648 --> 00:06:00,693
But someone else got arrested
as the culprit,

30
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:03,821
so I confessed everything
to the police as I felt too guilty.

31
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:09,744
You made a confession last time.

32
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:12,997
You said you were the one
who caused a fire and killed someone.

33
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:14,665
And?

34
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,627
You just told me to leave back then.

35
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:18,878
I changed my mind.

36
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:21,672
I don't think I should let that go.

37
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:22,757
I also...

38
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:25,134
changed my mind.

39
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,011
I'm going to take back...

40
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:28,930
my confession.

41
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:34,977
Mr. Lee, wait.

42
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,453
Hello, Mr. Ji.

43
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:54,122
Hello, Prosecutor Na.

44
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:56,707
Can I ask you something?

45
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,584
Of course.

46
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,253
Go ahead.

47
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:03,297
That guy who was
with Prosecutor Cha just now...

48
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:05,466
Do you know who he is?

49
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:10,513
He's an arsonist.

50
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,597
An arsonist?

51
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:13,599
Yes. My heart caught fire because of...

52
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:19,188
He apparently started a fire
at someone's house

53
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:20,731
or a car.

54
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,733
He's a serial arsonist.

55
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:29,657
PROSECUTOR NA JI-HAE

56
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:33,202
An arsonist?

57
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:42,670
Yes, Mr. Noh. What's going on?

58
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:49,010
I have a favor to ask.

59
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:50,803
It's a personal issue.

60
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,722
A personal issue?

61
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:56,017
Are you two going to register
your marriage already?

62
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:58,644
I'm sorry. It was lame, wasn't it?

63
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:07,028
There's something I'd like to know
regarding my parents' death.

64
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:11,866
I'd like to know the circumstances
of the incident...

65
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:14,577
or...

66
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:19,624
who the culprit was.

67
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:20,708
Things like that.

68
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,126
Why all of a sudden?

69
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:26,797
I just suddenly became curious.

70
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:30,051
Okay. I'll look into it as quickly as--

71
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:31,761
No.

72
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:34,931
You don't need to rush.

73
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:37,099
It's nothing urgent.

74
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:41,354
It might be a better idea to take it slow.

75
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:42,480
Just...

76
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:45,024
take it slow.

77
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:48,945
You can slowly...

78
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,030
look into it.

79
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:54,492
Okay. I'll do that.

80
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:06,897
LAWYER JI EUN-HYEOK

81
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:11,652
What?

82
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:12,945
I'm just looking at...

83
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:15,031
what you're up to.

84
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:16,907
I'm working. What else would I be doing?

85
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:18,951
Oh, I see.

86
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:20,369
I'll help you.

87
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:22,622
You said you needed help.

88
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:25,041
I don't care if it's complicated
or simple.

89
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:27,543
I want to get rid of
all these useless thoughts in my head.

90
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,671
I'm up for anything
that can help me focus. I'll help you.

91
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:32,298
What's with this sudden kindness?

92
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:35,593
Thank you for the offer,

93
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:37,094
-but I don't have anything.
-Nothing?

94
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:40,181
No. I had some paperwork to do,
which you hate,

95
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:42,725
but I'm almost done with that.

96
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:44,143
And the only criminal case...

97
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,105
I'm in charge of right now

98
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:51,108
is that appeal trial of the fire accident.

99
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:54,654
Thanks for offering,
but you don't need to help.

100
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:56,989
-I'll do it.
-What?

101
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,199
I'll take that case.

102
00:10:58,282 --> 00:11:00,576
But Ji-uk, it's a fire incident.

103
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,662
No. No, it's fine.

104
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:06,290
It's not like I never worked
on arson cases as a prosecutor.

105
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:09,460
Yes, I think I can do it.

106
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:11,587
It'll be doable. I'll be all right.
I'll help you.

107
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:13,214
Will you really be okay?

108
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:15,341
Yes.

109
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:18,761
Let's do it together, Mr. Noh.

110
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:20,846
I'll help too.

111
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:27,353
Will you be okay with it?

112
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:32,983
All right, then.

113
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:55,464
He's Kang Seon-il, the man who was
sentenced to 10 years in jail

114
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:58,259
for the arson case in Dobu-dong.
He's preparing for an appeal now.

115
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,637
I looked through the case files
from that time.

116
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:04,306
DOBU-DONG ARSON CASE, 2015

117
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:09,103
Kang Seon-il was ruled guilty because

118
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:10,855
there were motive,
circumstantial evidence,

119
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:12,440
and the witness statement.

120
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:16,026
You said that Chae Seong-wu
hit Kang Seon-il's daughter

121
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,904
with his car, right?
It was a DUI hit-and-run.

122
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,407
That's correct. After the accident,

123
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,451
Kang Seon-il visited
Chae Seong-wu often and said

124
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:26,078
"You won't get away with this,"
"I'll get my daughter's revenge,"

125
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:27,455
threats like these.

126
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:30,082
He was even taken to a police station
because of it.

127
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:33,461
Then one day, the fire broke out.

128
00:12:33,752 --> 00:12:36,046
And Chae Seong-wu died due to the fire.

129
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:38,924
But Kang Seon-il is insisting
that he was wrongly accused

130
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:41,051
and that he's innocent.

131
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,472
Well, that's right.

132
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:50,186
So what are you saying, Yu-jeong?

133
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,897
Do you want to keep digging this up?

134
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:59,487
Are you out of your mind?
The DA wants us to just bury it.

135
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:03,824
Whoever publicly admits
the prosecution's mistakes or errors

136
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:06,076
can't survive in the organization.

137
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:09,997
Just like what happened to Mr. Noh
because of the Eun Bong-hui case.

138
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,083
You know what happened.

139
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:59,296
Mr. Noh...

140
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:10,034
I can't believe...

141
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:12,494
that you're my man now.

142
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:06,382
-You were out?
-I'm back now.

143
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:57,141
ARSON CASE VICTIM PERSONAL RECORDS
NAME: EUN MAN-SU

ARSON CASE REPORT

PROSECUTOR IN CHARGE: JANG MU-YEONG

147
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:20,998
PROSECUTOR AND HIS WIFE
KILLED IN A REVENGE ARSON

148
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:58,535
I'm sorry, but...

149
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:02,206
I read that file.

150
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:05,918
I see.

151
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:09,463
You read it?

152
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:12,508
He's Ms. Eun's father,

153
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:15,594
isn't he? The suspect, Eun Man-su.

154
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:22,643
Yes. But it doesn't matter.

155
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:25,312
It's not like Bong-hui did it herself.

156
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:29,483
It's not like back in the days.
Guilt-by-association isn't valid.

157
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:31,860
It has nothing to do...

158
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,781
with Bong-hui, don't you think?

159
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,122
Bong-hui...

160
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:46,834
really has...

161
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,461
nothing...

162
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:52,673
to do with it, Mr. Bang.

163
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:54,633
Aren't I right?

164
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:09,022
Everyone is waiting.

165
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:11,984
Oh, right. I'll come down right now.

166
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:37,593
-Here.
-Thanks.

167
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,553
-Please have this piece.
-Gosh, it's hot.

168
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,598
It tastes even better
with the dipping sauce.

169
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:43,724
That's right.

170
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:45,851
It's spicy.

171
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:49,730
It's sort of like bindaetteok, isn't it?

172
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,106
-You can say that.
-Right?

173
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,816
It's American-style bindaetteok.

174
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:56,695
I haven't heard bindaetteok
in such a long time.

175
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,491
Yes, totally.

176
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:03,911
-Try the original.
-It's good.

177
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:05,704
Yes, it's delicious.

178
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:38,695
No...

179
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:57,089
Are you okay?

180
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:09,810
I...

181
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:14,022
I'm all right.

182
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:22,489
For how long have you been standing there?

183
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:24,950
For a while.

184
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:27,286
For a while?

185
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:43,010
What is that for?

186
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:46,013
Don't get the wrong idea.

187
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:47,764
I was worried about you, Mr. Noh.

188
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:52,602
You kept having nightmares
and had trouble sleeping, Ji-uk.

189
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:53,812
I didn't have any other agenda.

190
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:56,189
I didn't have an ulterior motive.
Don't misunderstand me. Okay?

191
00:21:58,734 --> 00:21:59,776
I don't know.

192
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,238
I still don't know
even if you glare at me like that.

193
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,242
Fine. I get it.

194
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:13,915
You are really okay, right?

195
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:18,128
Yes, I'm all right.

196
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:25,135
Ji-uk...

197
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:27,554
why did you become a prosecutor?

198
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:30,766
My dad...

199
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:32,934
was a prosecutor.

200
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:36,521
You wanted to be like your dad.

201
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:40,817
Yes.

202
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:42,611
Your dad

203
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,613
must be proud of you.

204
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:49,618
I don't know.

205
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,121
I'm not sure about that.

206
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:02,923
Why wouldn't he be?

207
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:08,637
What about you, Bong-hui?

208
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:09,846
Sorry?

209
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:12,099
Why did you become a lawyer?

210
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:16,394
I...

211
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:20,273
became a lawyer
because of one perverted judge.

212
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:22,067
I quit my career as an athlete

213
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,985
and started studying to become a lawyer.

214
00:23:25,403 --> 00:23:26,738
As I studied more and more,

215
00:23:27,405 --> 00:23:30,408
I began to think
that I was destined to become one.

216
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:33,411
I think...

217
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:36,540
I became a lawyer to defend people

218
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:38,750
like my dad.

219
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:44,422
What kind of people are they?

220
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:48,635
People like me.

221
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:53,265
Innocent people who were
misunderstood by the world...

222
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:55,767
and wrongfully framed.

223
00:23:56,893 --> 00:23:58,603
Every criminal in the world...

224
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:00,647
Excuse me?

225
00:24:06,027 --> 00:24:06,862
Nothing.

226
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:08,697
It's nothing.

227
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:29,968
I'm sorry.

228
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:36,183
I'm sorry, Bong-hui.

229
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:16,241
I put all the healthy ingredients in this.

230
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:21,246
I can see that.

231
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:24,457
-The color--
-Doesn't it look healthy?

232
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:25,834
Exactly.

233
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:27,210
That really looks healthy.

234
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:35,468
Did you put the tea
for the insomnia in this?

235
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:37,012
No, I didn't.

236
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:49,524
Thank you for this.

237
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,320
Then give me a morning kiss.

238
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:05,123
I sweated a lot from exercise
and probably stink.

239
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:06,458
Let me wash up.

240
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:14,924
But that's the good part.

241
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:19,054
What's going on?

242
00:27:32,525 --> 00:27:34,361
Goodness, darn it.

243
00:27:41,659 --> 00:27:42,702
Is he

244
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:44,245
upset because it tastes horrible?

245
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:50,502
Gosh, this tastes terrible.

246
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:53,046
I can see why he got upset.

247
00:27:58,551 --> 00:27:59,886
That's understandable.

248
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:03,765
This is probably why.

249
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:22,492
Ji-hae.

250
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:23,868
Yu-jeong.

251
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:25,829
What? Why are you here?

252
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:28,039
Then why are you here?

253
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:29,707
I live in this building.

254
00:28:29,999 --> 00:28:30,875
I do too.

255
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:31,918
Since when?

256
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:33,086
Since last week.

257
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:34,879
Did you move here then?

258
00:28:35,004 --> 00:28:36,047
I did.

259
00:28:37,757 --> 00:28:39,467
You followed me all the way here.

260
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,136
Pardon? What did you say?

261
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:43,763
I'm glad I'm your role model
and everything.

262
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:45,932
You followed me
and moved into this building.

263
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:47,684
That's a bit creepy.

264
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:50,770
The more I get to know you,
my opinion of you is changing more.

265
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:53,064
You were putting on makeup
in the elevator,

266
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:55,233
which is a public space
like a bus or train.

267
00:28:55,942 --> 00:28:57,068
I find it a bit out of line.

268
00:28:58,278 --> 00:28:59,904
This is understandable nowadays.

269
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:01,448
It's not like I do this every day.

270
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:03,867
See one and you've seen them all.

271
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:06,286
How can you see all after seeing just one?

272
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:09,122
It's hard to truly figure out a person
after seeing him or her once.

273
00:29:09,205 --> 00:29:10,373
We call this

274
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:13,460
the fallacy of a hasty generalization,
Yu-jeong.

275
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:19,799
Hey, Ji-hae.

276
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:21,551
You are very disrespectful these days.

277
00:29:21,634 --> 00:29:22,802
Do you know that?

278
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:30,852
Mr. Lee, wait.

279
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:41,029
I definitely saw him from somewhere.

280
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:42,322
Where did I see him?

281
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,658
I can't seem to remember him. Gosh.

282
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:55,043
Mr. Ji, you are distracting me.

283
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:58,421
He's been like this for the last few days.

284
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:00,423
He's looking for someone
whom he doesn't know.

285
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:04,761
That guy who was with Prosecutor Cha
just now...

286
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:06,805
Do you know who he is?

287
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:11,017
He's an arsonist.

288
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,686
He's an arsonist? An arsonist...

289
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:18,274
The witness who testified
for Kang Seon-il's case--

290
00:30:18,566 --> 00:30:19,776
-Ms. Eun.
-Yes?

291
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:21,736
I really like you.

292
00:30:24,697 --> 00:30:26,032
Yes, that's it.

293
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:28,409
All right.

294
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:35,041
I found him.

295
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:37,293
His name is Lee Jun-hae.

296
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:40,755
May I approach the witness, Your Honor?

297
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:43,383
TWO YEARS AGO

298
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:46,594
Witness.

299
00:30:47,762 --> 00:30:49,556
At the time of the incident,

300
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:52,058
you saw the person
who got out of the victim's house

301
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:54,143
during the fire and ran away, right?

302
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:55,395
Yes.

303
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:57,564
I did.

304
00:30:57,647 --> 00:30:58,690
The witness

305
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:01,818
who stated that he saw Kang Seon-il
on the scene

306
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:04,320
-was Lee Jun-hae.
-He's sitting right there.

307
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:06,823
It was that man.

308
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:11,828
He even attended the trial as a witness.

309
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:15,582
But he turned out
to be an arsonist himself.

310
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:17,917
Was it really a coincidence?

311
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:19,836
So to summarize it all,

312
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:24,257
an arsonist witnessed an arson
and reported it to the police.

313
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,633
It could've been a coincidence.

314
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:27,802
-However--
-It's possible that it wasn't.

315
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:30,179
If I was the prosecutor in charge,

316
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:31,848
he'd have been one of the suspects--

317
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:32,974
You probably would have.

318
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:35,435
I say that because many of those
who commit arson

319
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:37,604
seek heroism,
and that's why they start fires.

320
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:40,815
"I'll start a fire and call the police
to become a hero."

321
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:42,317
-Something like that.
-That's right.

322
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:44,777
I've seen some of them
acting as if they're witnesses

323
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:46,279
in the news.

324
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:49,073
That's right.
I've heard of such cases too.

325
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,869
That's why the police make sure
to film the scene for arson cases.

326
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:55,204
It's highly likely that the arsonist
is one of the spectators.

327
00:31:55,788 --> 00:31:58,291
Then we should try to find
videos from the arson scene

328
00:31:58,374 --> 00:32:00,209
or news clips related to the case.

329
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:04,380
We should also go through the list
of petty arson cases in the area.

330
00:32:04,547 --> 00:32:07,550
If our guess is right,
his name will very likely be on the list.

331
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,093
Mr. Bang, please take care of it.

332
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:12,847
Yes, you know a lot of people
in the police and the fire department.

333
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:14,265
Please help us out.

334
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:19,437
-What's wrong?
-The stab wound is achy and itchy.

335
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:21,064
I'm all right now.

336
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:23,942
-Just take it easy, then.
-We'll take care of it.

337
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:25,276
No, what are you talking about?

338
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,987
It's my job to take care of
such laborious tasks. I'll...

339
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:32,575
I'm not getting
a personal secretary, driver,

340
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:34,953
or an office manager, but I'll...

341
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:37,372
-Let's find it ourselves.
-Okay.

342
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:38,539
-All right.
-I'll be back soon.

343
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:39,916
-Okay.
-Take it easy, Mr. Bang.

344
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:41,584
-Get some rest.
-I'm really okay.

345
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:42,835
See you guys soon.

346
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:54,806
There are a lot of people who committed
or attempted arson, more than I thought.

347
00:32:57,892 --> 00:32:58,851
I know, right?

348
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:01,479
If Lee Jun-hae really was the arsonist,

349
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:04,399
Kang Seon-il, who's behind bars
right now, must be

350
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:06,734
extremely upset about
being falsely accused.

351
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:09,696
He didn't even set the fire,

352
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:11,948
yet he became an arsonist and murderer.

353
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:15,827
I'm not sure what to say. So far,

354
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:19,247
there's no evidence that can prove
his innocence.

355
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,915
We should dig more.

356
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:25,294
I know. But now, there's a possibility

357
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:27,630
that he may have been falsely accused.

358
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:32,677
I know that, but I don't think
you should empathize too much.

359
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:35,179
I'm not empathizing with him.

360
00:33:35,471 --> 00:33:38,975
I'm just trying to be fair
and keep all possibilities open.

361
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:41,019
Well, from the way I see it,

362
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:44,188
it looks like you're overly
empathizing with him.

363
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:48,860
As a lawyer, I don't think
this much empathy is excessive.

364
00:33:48,943 --> 00:33:50,611
-This is why lawyers--
-I know.

365
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:53,114
You don't like them.

366
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:03,207
I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings.
I apologize.

367
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:07,628
Me too.

368
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:34,781
Where's the next fire station?

369
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:36,240
Haein Fire Station.

370
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:46,375
Prosecutor Cha isn't here at the moment.

371
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:51,297
CHA YU-JEONG

372
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:53,591
My gosh.

373
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:57,970
Hello, Mr. Ji.

374
00:34:58,387 --> 00:34:59,847
Hello, Prosecutor Na.

375
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:02,100
We've been running into
each other a lot lately.

376
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:03,643
Yes, we have.

377
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:07,063
By the way,
have you seen Prosecutor Cha today?

378
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:09,440
Why do you need to see her?

379
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:11,109
Why do you think?
It's for work, of course.

380
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:15,822
Even if you don't emphasize
that it's for work,

381
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:17,907
I won't get the wrong idea.

382
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:19,867
Pardon me?

383
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:22,120
You have her number, right?

384
00:35:22,411 --> 00:35:24,122
Yes, of course.

385
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:27,416
Yet, you're making a point
of asking me about her.

386
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:35,383
Well... I have to take care of something,
so I should get going.

387
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:37,260
All right. See you.

388
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:38,886
See you.

389
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:58,865
You had a long day today.

390
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:00,575
You should get some rest.

391
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,201
Actually...

392
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:07,707
is there something you're hiding from me?

393
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:12,712
What?

394
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:15,631
So there is.

395
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:19,135
No, I'm not hiding anything.

396
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:23,264
I'll believe you.

397
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:26,225
Bong-hui.

398
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:32,106
I keep wondering if I've done
something wrong. Have I?

399
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:35,985
No, it's nothing like that.

400
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:39,322
It's about me, not you.
It's something I need to work out myself.

401
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:43,201
And I'm not allowed...

402
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:45,953
to ask you what it's about?

403
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:54,962
All right.

404
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:38,339
Is this another coincidence?

405
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:41,467
No, it's not. I tried calling you,
but you didn't pick up.

406
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:43,094
Oh, you did?

407
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:47,014
I don't check my phone often
because I rarely get calls.

408
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:48,224
What's up?

409
00:37:48,557 --> 00:37:50,351
There's something I'd like to check.

410
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,436
What is it?

411
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:54,063
It'll only take five minutes.

412
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:57,024
I'm tired, and my feet are killing me.

413
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:59,944
I want to take these heels off right now.

414
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:04,156
-You can follow me if you want.
-What?

415
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:06,826
Hey.

416
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,687
What is it that you want to check?

417
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:38,983
Oh, right.
I'm working on an appeal case now.

418
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:41,110
-The witness of the case is--
-Lee Jun-hae?

419
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:46,032
Yes.

420
00:38:46,532 --> 00:38:48,617
He's the one
who attempted the arson, isn't he?

421
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:51,871
And he's the culprit
of the case you're working on.

422
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:54,206
-What?
-He confessed.

423
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:56,542
But the higher-ups want me to bury it.

424
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:58,377
That is complete nonsense.

425
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:05,092
Here.

426
00:39:07,094 --> 00:39:07,970
What is this?

427
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:09,764
I dug up some intel on Lee Jun-hae.

428
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:12,558
You can use it
for the trial if you'd like.

429
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:17,980
Can you do this though?

430
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:19,398
I don't even know.

431
00:39:20,983 --> 00:39:23,319
It's getting late.
You should get going if you're done.

432
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,073
All right. Thanks for this.

433
00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:28,699
You can stay overnight if you want.

434
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:30,785
What?

435
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:32,328
I was joking.

436
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:34,205
How can you make such a joke?

437
00:39:34,288 --> 00:39:36,248
I'm a bitch no matter what I do.

438
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:38,250
Doesn't the joke suit me perfectly?

439
00:39:38,584 --> 00:39:39,585
No.

440
00:39:40,669 --> 00:39:43,672
Hey, Yu-jeong. Stop beating yourself up.

441
00:39:44,965 --> 00:39:46,008
It's not good for you.

442
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:53,349
Anyway...

443
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:57,103
why didn't you tell Ji-uk

444
00:39:57,436 --> 00:39:58,562
that nothing

445
00:39:59,021 --> 00:40:00,231
happened on that night?

446
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:04,151
Whether it was a mistake or not...

447
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:08,447
it is true that something
could have happened that night.

448
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:12,326
I see.

449
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:15,538
Then what about you?

450
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:18,374
Why didn't you tell him?

451
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:23,254
Because it is true that I...

452
00:40:24,171 --> 00:40:25,214
hurt him.

453
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:55,327
Yes, Mr. Bang.

454
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:10,968
I'm still a bachelor.

455
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:14,054
I can't believe I have a stab wound
on my stomach.

456
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:19,226
I'm so worried
that I wouldn't be able to meet someone.

457
00:41:24,106 --> 00:41:25,691
What do you guys think about this?

458
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:29,320
Well, I think...

459
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:31,614
it's great.

460
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:32,865
I love it.

461
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:34,533
Right.

462
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:36,368
I think it's going to be okay.

463
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:38,871
What's great?

464
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:41,081
What is so great and will be okay?

465
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:45,002
I'm sorry.

466
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:46,837
Me too.

467
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:51,258
What are you two so worried about?

468
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:55,179
I'm not married, and yet I'm raising
four adults. I'm drinking soda

469
00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:58,307
because I was stabbed in the stomach.

470
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:01,519
Why do you look so down?
Your lives are not that bad.

471
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:06,482
I think I made a mistake.

472
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:08,776
Everything is my fault.

473
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:13,322
It's my fault too.

474
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,199
Gosh.

475
00:42:16,325 --> 00:42:18,327
Why are you apologizing?

476
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:22,164
To be honest, you two are in a bind.

477
00:42:22,289 --> 00:42:25,376
Then, what should I do?

478
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:28,128
It seems like I'm out of options.

479
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:31,340
Mr. Bang, you should tell me
what I should do.

480
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:32,550
-Goodness.
-Please?

481
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:34,635
Give me advice for me first.

482
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:37,429
I can't figure this out.

483
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:07,001
Unbelievable. Mr. Bang!

484
00:43:07,167 --> 00:43:10,129
You got your stitches only recently.
How can you drink like this?

485
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:11,630
Goodness.

486
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:14,091
Why are you crying? Are you that drunk?

487
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:17,177
I drank soda.

488
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:19,346
Do you think I'd believe that?

489
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:21,473
What kind of person cries
after drinking soda?

490
00:43:21,557 --> 00:43:23,142
-Goodness, you are in trouble.
-Wait.

491
00:43:23,225 --> 00:43:26,353
It's Bong-hui. Hey, Bong-hui. Bong-hui!

492
00:43:28,188 --> 00:43:29,231
Have a glass.

493
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:30,858
It is soda.

494
00:43:31,483 --> 00:43:33,193
-Have two glasses.
-No, have only one.

495
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:34,403
Bong-hui, have one.

496
00:43:35,237 --> 00:43:36,989
-Take two glasses.
-No, have just one.

497
00:43:37,072 --> 00:43:38,490
Since she's late, take two glasses.

498
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:40,326
Since she's late, take one glass.

499
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:41,660
Fine. Take three then.

500
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:44,788
Goodness.

501
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:45,873
Gosh.

502
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:47,499
-Let's go.
-Okay.

503
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:48,626
-We're going.
-Another round?

504
00:43:48,917 --> 00:43:51,045
-No, no.
-Don't do that.

505
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:52,504
-This way.
-It's my fault.

506
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:54,423
Be careful.

507
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:56,592
I'm all right.

508
00:43:57,384 --> 00:44:00,346
Hold on. Just sit here for a while.

509
00:44:00,512 --> 00:44:01,930
Let me bring you some water.

510
00:44:14,693 --> 00:44:15,694
We...

511
00:44:17,529 --> 00:44:19,698
should never break up, Bong-hui.

512
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:24,745
Even if I tell you to leave me...

513
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:26,705
don't leave.

514
00:44:30,876 --> 00:44:31,877
We...

515
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:35,964
should only think about ourselves.

516
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:42,221
Don't leave me.

517
00:44:43,555 --> 00:44:44,640
Please?

518
00:44:51,146 --> 00:44:52,147
I won't.

519
00:44:52,606 --> 00:44:53,607
Don't worry.

520
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:37,818
Mr. Byeon hid those
because he wanted to have them to himself.

521
00:45:42,531 --> 00:45:44,283
I can eat them all in secret

522
00:45:44,366 --> 00:45:45,993
and pretend that I didn't eat them.

523
00:45:55,377 --> 00:45:57,045
If that's the case...

524
00:45:59,548 --> 00:46:00,757
I'll be an accomplice.

525
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:10,809
All right.

526
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:12,769
I'm ready for my session.

527
00:46:13,645 --> 00:46:14,771
Tell me anything.

528
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:20,611
I...

529
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:23,197
won't consult you about my relationship.

530
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:27,242
It's only between me and Mr. Noh.

531
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:30,662
I won't talk about it.

532
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:34,750
You have a problem with Ji-uk.

533
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:36,877
No, I don't.

534
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:39,713
Ji-uk...

535
00:46:40,714 --> 00:46:42,132
is a bit weird these days, right?

536
00:46:42,549 --> 00:46:43,425
Yes.

537
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:45,969
No.

538
00:46:51,433 --> 00:46:52,351
You're right.

539
00:46:52,851 --> 00:46:53,852
To be honest,

540
00:46:54,686 --> 00:46:55,521
he's a bit strange.

541
00:46:57,356 --> 00:46:59,525
I think the case he's working on now...

542
00:47:00,526 --> 00:47:03,946
reminds him of his parents' incident.

543
00:47:05,697 --> 00:47:06,740
By the way,

544
00:47:07,282 --> 00:47:08,951
the same applies for you too, Ms. Eun.

545
00:47:10,827 --> 00:47:13,997
My dad also passed away in a fire.

546
00:47:14,581 --> 00:47:15,666
But Ji-uk...

547
00:47:16,416 --> 00:47:18,335
was in the fire with them.

548
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:21,129
So he might have been traumatized deeply.

549
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:23,674
Whether he still remembers it or not,

550
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:26,677
he witnessed the whole scene
with his own eyes.

551
00:47:28,136 --> 00:47:29,137
Besides,

552
00:47:29,805 --> 00:47:31,306
he was the lone survivor.

553
00:47:32,224 --> 00:47:33,892
He must feel guilty about it.

554
00:47:38,063 --> 00:47:39,064
I see.

555
00:47:39,856 --> 00:47:41,066
Looking back,

556
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:43,819
how could I have not figured it out?

557
00:47:49,783 --> 00:47:51,493
On the list of the arsonists
in the district,

558
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:53,870
Lee Jun-hae is only registered
for attempted arsons.

559
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:57,249
Lee Jun-hae was in the video

560
00:47:57,332 --> 00:47:59,334
filming the scene of the fire that day.

561
00:47:59,418 --> 00:48:00,502
That's right,

562
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:03,880
but it can't be used as evidence
to prove his guilt.

563
00:48:04,798 --> 00:48:05,674
No.

564
00:48:06,383 --> 00:48:08,594
Lee Jun-hae is the arsonist.

565
00:48:09,845 --> 00:48:11,179
I have an informant.

566
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:13,515
That's great, but until the end,

567
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:16,518
we shouldn't conclude
whether he's guilty or not.

568
00:48:16,935 --> 00:48:18,061
Let's take a look first.

569
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:20,981
I have the photos of the scene.

570
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:22,691
Will you be okay?

571
00:48:25,485 --> 00:48:26,486
Yes, I'll be.

572
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:40,876
There were countless clues.

573
00:48:41,627 --> 00:48:42,461
Why...

574
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:44,963
hadn't I figured it out?

575
00:48:45,964 --> 00:48:47,841
COURT IN SESSION

576
00:48:57,684 --> 00:49:00,854
Witness, I believe you know
quite a lot about xylene.

577
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:04,024
Excuse me? What is that?

578
00:49:05,067 --> 00:49:06,193
According to my research,

579
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:09,279
I'm aware that your occupation
is related to producing

580
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:12,032
paints, varnish, and adhesives
at Seonho Chemicals.

581
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:13,116
Am I mistaken?

582
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:15,285
In the process of producing
these chemicals,

583
00:49:15,577 --> 00:49:16,953
xylene is used.

584
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:19,081
Oh, that.

585
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:21,124
I think so.

586
00:49:22,709 --> 00:49:26,588
Xylene is considered to be
a very strong inflammable material.

587
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:28,131
Moreover,

588
00:49:28,215 --> 00:49:30,801
it was also used to cause a fire
in Dobu-dong two years ago

589
00:49:30,884 --> 00:49:32,135
by the arsonist.

590
00:49:34,012 --> 00:49:36,181
By any chance, were you
aware of this fact?

591
00:49:36,682 --> 00:49:38,725
No, I didn't know that.

592
00:49:39,101 --> 00:49:40,143
Is that so?

593
00:49:41,728 --> 00:49:43,647
Then how should I explain this?

594
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:50,862
Mr. Lee Jun-hae

595
00:49:51,113 --> 00:49:56,076
recently got arrested by the police
for attempted incendiarism.

596
00:49:56,535 --> 00:50:01,164
But a female prosecutor
just told me to leave back then.

597
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:04,418
The police confiscated
the flammable material from Mr. Lee,

598
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:06,420
and they requested a component analysis.

599
00:50:07,212 --> 00:50:10,632
According to the analysis,
it contained a mixture of xylene.

600
00:50:11,341 --> 00:50:12,843
They also did a comparative analysis

601
00:50:13,093 --> 00:50:16,930
with the material that caused
the fire two years ago.

602
00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:20,767
The result showed that the two flammables
were almost identical.

603
00:50:26,064 --> 00:50:29,443
There are times
when you come to a sudden realization.

604
00:50:47,753 --> 00:50:49,796
Excuse me. I have to go somewhere.

605
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,203
Hey, Mom.

606
00:51:24,122 --> 00:51:25,916
I attended a trial today.

607
00:51:28,126 --> 00:51:29,294
There was this man...

608
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:33,256
who was falsely accused of
murder and arson.

609
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:37,969
Fortunately, it looks like

610
00:51:38,637 --> 00:51:41,264
the appeal trial will lead
to a positive result.

611
00:51:42,098 --> 00:51:44,017
So I think it'll all turn out well.

612
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:45,602
Really?

613
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:48,647
Yes. Really.

614
00:51:50,649 --> 00:51:52,400
So I feel great right now.

615
00:51:55,487 --> 00:51:57,239
I just wanted to tell you this.

616
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:03,245
But...

617
00:52:05,121 --> 00:52:06,331
But Mom...

618
00:52:06,873 --> 00:52:08,208
Yes? What is it?

619
00:52:12,128 --> 00:52:13,129
Well...

620
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:15,549
Never mind.

621
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:19,261
I'm busy right now,

622
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:23,181
so I'll call you again later.
I'm going to hang up now.

623
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:38,864
How could I not have known?

624
00:52:54,921 --> 00:52:58,800
PROSECUTOR AND HIS WIFE
KILLED IN A REVENGE ARSON

625
00:53:06,474 --> 00:53:10,729
I read the article on my dad's accident
so many times

626
00:53:11,229 --> 00:53:13,815
that I practically memorized
the story of the victim's family.

627
00:53:13,899 --> 00:53:15,150
EIGHT-YEAR-OLD SON

628
00:53:16,735 --> 00:53:18,153
Ji-uk and his parents...

629
00:53:19,154 --> 00:53:21,072
were supposed to go on a family picnic...

630
00:53:21,948 --> 00:53:24,200
on the day after his dad had passed away.

631
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:27,871
The anniversary date
of both our fathers' deaths.

632
00:53:27,954 --> 00:53:29,831
THE LATE NOH YEONG-SEOK, JUNE 15, 1994

633
00:53:29,915 --> 00:53:31,917
THE LATE EUN MAN-SU, JUNE 15, 1994

634
00:53:32,125 --> 00:53:36,004
I lost both my parents
in a fire accident when I was young.

635
00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:38,965
My dad passed away first.

636
00:53:39,591 --> 00:53:40,508
And...

637
00:53:41,176 --> 00:53:43,136
my mom got transported to a hospital,

638
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,096
but she passed away...

639
00:53:46,097 --> 00:53:47,599
not too soon after that.

640
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:52,729
Ji-uk, why did you become a prosecutor?

641
00:53:54,147 --> 00:53:55,231
My dad...

642
00:53:56,232 --> 00:53:57,317
was a prosecutor.

643
00:53:58,568 --> 00:54:00,445
I guess you wanted
to become like your dad.

644
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:04,824
Yes.

645
00:54:23,134 --> 00:54:24,302
Good work, today.

646
00:54:24,678 --> 00:54:26,388
-Thanks. See you.
-Okay.

647
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:35,105
Thank you. I think I'll win
this case thanks to you.

648
00:54:35,271 --> 00:54:36,564
Of course.

649
00:54:38,692 --> 00:54:39,985
Will you be okay?

650
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:43,780
Well, I didn't let go of the case
like they told me to,

651
00:54:43,863 --> 00:54:45,323
so I'm guessing I'll just get chewed out.

652
00:54:47,826 --> 00:54:50,996
But I'm never going to quit my job

653
00:54:51,705 --> 00:54:53,373
because you guys refused to take me in.

654
00:55:05,301 --> 00:55:06,302
Hey, Bong-hui.

655
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:08,888
I can't find you. Did you already leave?

656
00:55:09,222 --> 00:55:11,099
I was reminded of something urgent.

657
00:55:12,434 --> 00:55:15,103
I see. It's nothing serious, right?

658
00:55:15,854 --> 00:55:18,857
Okay. I'll wait for you at home.

659
00:55:30,285 --> 00:55:31,453
Some people think...

660
00:55:32,537 --> 00:55:35,540
they've achieved justice
through such petty cases like this.

661
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:39,586
But you see, in this world...

662
00:55:40,211 --> 00:55:42,213
In this world, there's an order.

663
00:55:43,381 --> 00:55:45,508
In order for this world
to keep that order in place,

664
00:55:46,384 --> 00:55:50,472
there must be small sacrifices
made by people like you.

665
00:55:53,058 --> 00:55:55,226
All I need is
for you to become a murderer.

666
00:55:58,646 --> 00:56:00,190
I'm not wrong.

667
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:03,276
That means it is unacceptable
to make any kind of mistake

668
00:56:03,943 --> 00:56:06,196
that could harm
the order of an organization,

669
00:56:06,279 --> 00:56:08,990
the order of the law,
and the order of power.

670
00:56:09,824 --> 00:56:13,203
We cannot afford to make
a single prosecution mistake whatsoever.

671
00:56:13,661 --> 00:56:14,662
Do you understand?

672
00:56:45,276 --> 00:56:47,278
Excuse me. I have to go somewhere.

673
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:49,239
Okay.

674
00:57:07,882 --> 00:57:08,842
Hey, where are you?

675
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:12,428
Oh, really? Then I'll go to where you are.

676
00:57:12,846 --> 00:57:15,306
I'll be right there. Okay.

677
00:57:22,313 --> 00:57:23,648
I want to eat tteokbokki.

678
00:57:24,983 --> 00:57:26,359
Tteokbokki?

679
00:57:27,318 --> 00:57:28,403
Do you want to?

680
00:57:29,070 --> 00:57:30,488
-Here?
-Of course.

681
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:33,408
Just wait here.

682
00:57:33,491 --> 00:57:36,327
I'll buy you tteokbokki, sundae,
gimbap, and everything else.

683
00:57:36,411 --> 00:57:38,621
-I can--
-Wait here. I'll be right back.

684
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:53,511
How is it? Is it delicious?

685
00:57:53,595 --> 00:57:54,596
It's delicious.

686
00:57:55,513 --> 00:57:56,431
Eat up.

687
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:16,117
It's delicious,
but it's a little too spicy.

688
00:58:16,576 --> 00:58:18,203
I almost cried.

689
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:41,684
Let's take a photo with that cat.

690
00:58:41,976 --> 00:58:42,977
Shall we do that?

691
00:58:48,233 --> 00:58:49,234
Here we go.

692
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:52,570
One, two, three.

693
00:58:55,281 --> 00:58:56,324
Why isn't it working?

694
00:58:57,617 --> 00:58:59,118
-Bong-hui.
-Yes?

695
00:59:00,119 --> 00:59:01,371
You're taking a video right now.

696
00:59:02,121 --> 00:59:03,581
-Oh, really?
-Yes.

697
00:59:04,582 --> 00:59:05,583
My gosh.

698
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:11,256
You were right.

699
00:59:11,339 --> 00:59:12,382
You dummy.

700
00:59:21,182 --> 00:59:22,308
Is it good?

701
00:59:56,718 --> 00:59:58,052
Postponement.

702
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:06,102
My futile effort

703
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:08,521
to postpone it a moment longer

704
01:00:09,230 --> 01:00:10,565
and a step later.

705
01:01:06,746 --> 01:01:07,664
Let's...

706
01:01:11,626 --> 01:01:12,627
break up.

707
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:39,862
