1
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:35,535
There was one more.

2
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:38,038
Was his name Jang Hui-jun?

3
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:42,333
Well... Initially,
I had no intention of killing that dude.

4
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:45,170
I ended up stabbing him with a knife,

5
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:48,465
and he collapsed, crying.

6
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:52,886
"Dad.

7
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:58,266
Dad, save me. Dad, help me.

8
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:01,603
I'm terrified."

9
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:52,570
I'm calling from the HR department
at the Ministry of Justice.

10
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:56,241
You are recruited
as an experienced prosecutor.

11
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:11,673
Yes, Prosecutor Cha.

12
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:14,259
I just wanted to let you know
that Jung Hyeon-su confessed.

13
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:19,222
Hold on. What did you just say?
He confessed?

14
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:20,974
Yes, he didn't confess
to all the murder cases.

15
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:23,059
He only confessed
to Jang Hui-jun's murder case

16
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,435
and the water tank case.

17
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:29,399
-Are you there?
-By the way...

18
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:34,070
Was Chief Jang Mu-yeong present
when he made the confession?

19
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,322
Yes, he was watching the interrogation
from outside.

20
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:38,908
Where is the chief?
What about Jung Hyeon-su?

21
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:44,455
Hey.

22
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:46,875
You're here.

23
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:48,251
Did something happen?

24
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:52,130
I just need to check something
at the prosecutors' office.

25
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:54,465
There's something
that's been bothering me too.

26
00:02:57,385 --> 00:02:58,595
I'm sorry.

27
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:06,978
The chief apologized to you?

28
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:09,647
-Isn't that strange?
-Yes, definitely.

29
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:13,484
I was going to check something
about the chief, too.

30
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:16,654
Let me go with you then.

31
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:19,115
Okay, let's go.

32
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,950
Please check the chief's parking spot

33
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:03,952
and the entrance
of the prosecutors' office.

34
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:05,286
All right.

35
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:07,247
Excuse me.

36
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:09,540
Hello?

37
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:13,169
Did you meet with the guard
who transported Jung Hyeon-su?

38
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:16,547
Someone took him an hour ago
under the chief's order.

39
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:21,302
Please show me the footages
from an hour ago.

40
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:22,387
Yes, ma'am.

41
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,020
Hold on.

42
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:36,067
Right there.

43
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:55,503
Get off.

44
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:04,637
Okay, I got it.

45
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:06,556
Thank you, Prosecutor Cha. Okay.

46
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:10,018
What did she say?

47
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:14,022
She said both Chief Jang Mu-yeong
and Jung Hyeon-su disappeared.

48
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:15,523
I knew it.

49
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:19,277
The chief disappeared
after taking Jung Hyeon-su.

50
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:23,740
Do you think he wants to take his revenge
on Jung Hyeon-su personally?

51
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:25,783
That's what I think he's up to.

52
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:31,331
Where could the chief have taken
Jung Hyeon-su?

53
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:34,542
We know nothing about their whereabouts?

54
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:38,379
Yes, right now, the chief's phone
is turned off.

55
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:41,215
We're tracking the location
of his driver's cell phone.

56
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:43,259
Hopefully, it might get us somewhere.

57
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:48,556
If I were him, where would I have gone?

58
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:57,523
What are you doing all of a sudden?

59
00:05:58,149 --> 00:06:00,651
Oh, it helps me when I'm trying to think.

60
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:04,447
Seriously? Are you sure about that?

61
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:05,990
It probably makes it worse.

62
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,578
Oh, maybe...

63
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,791
It's just a thought.

64
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,502
It could be where Hui-jun got killed.

65
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:19,295
You know, my old place.

66
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:22,131
It's empty at the moment
because of the redevelopment.

67
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:23,341
They might be there.

68
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:30,556
Hey, Prosecutor Cha.
Do you have the location?

69
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,484
Get up, you scum!

70
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:50,701
This is where...

71
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:53,621
my son, Hui-jun, collapsed.

72
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:56,833
This is where...

73
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:59,710
you brutally killed my innocent son!

74
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,798
Innocent?

75
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:04,882
What?

76
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,468
Your son may be innocent,

77
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,303
but you're not.

78
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:10,680
What are you saying?

79
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:13,850
Because of you...

80
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:17,019
So-yeong...

81
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:26,654
So-yeong died because of you,

82
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:30,366
and I've turned out like this
because of you.

83
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:35,163
It's all because you acquitted
those scumbags

84
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:37,540
who trampled all over her.

85
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,292
Do you know that?

86
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:41,752
Do you?

87
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:50,803
Stabbing your son...

88
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:53,556
was really a coincidence.

89
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:54,640
But...

90
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:58,686
Everyone is shocked
by the murder of a trainee

91
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:01,564
from the Judicial Research
and Training Institute.

92
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:04,984
The fact that the victim is
the current chief prosecutors' son

93
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:06,777
has caused a big stir.

94
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:08,488
The chief prosecutor, Jang Mu-yeong,

95
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:10,948
has been hiding the fact
his son was training at the institute.

96
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:15,244
It was because he wanted to prevent
any special treatment and ensure fairness.

97
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:17,622
Ms. Eun, who has been arrested,

98
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:19,332
could not accept
the victim broke up with her.

99
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:20,416
Jang Mu-yeong?

100
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:24,754
I see, Jang Mu-yeong.

101
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:30,885
His father was the man
who made So-yeong die 13 years ago.

102
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:32,762
I...

103
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:37,433
I...

104
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:45,900
I realized that

105
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:49,487
killing your son was a fair revenge,
not a coincidence.

106
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:51,781
That's bullshit!

107
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,331
Don't act like you don't remember it.

108
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,416
You're disgusting me.

109
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:04,919
Shall I help you remember it?

110
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,672
13 years ago...

111
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:10,508
there was a girl.

112
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:12,343
That girl...

113
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:17,223
got severely injured by some beasts,

114
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:19,767
and you were the prosecutor
in charge of that case.

115
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,813
You got those scumbags acquitted
as if it was no big deal,

116
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:26,315
and buried the case itself.

117
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:27,692
Can you remember that?

118
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:30,778
You...

119
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:33,573
didn't side with the injured girl
who was in pain.

120
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:37,243
Those jerks...

121
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:39,328
You sided with those jerks

122
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:41,998
and their parents instead.

123
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:44,083
You still don't remember it?

124
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:46,752
Answer me.

125
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:48,838
Do you still not remember it?

126
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:50,673
Answer me!

127
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:22,496
Sir.

128
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:33,883
Bong-hui, stay here with him.

129
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:35,343
Okay.

130
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:40,973
Sir, are you all right?

131
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:47,563
Jung Hyeon-su.

132
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:49,357
Jung Hyeon-su!

133
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:52,360
Hey, Jung Hyeon-su!

134
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:57,239
Hey, Jung Hyeon-su. Gosh.

135
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:08,751
Why are you doing this to me?

136
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,712
Are you being like this
because I stabbed you?

137
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:13,506
You didn't die.

138
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:15,508
That guy, Mr. Bang, didn't die either.

139
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:17,009
So what the hell's your problem?

140
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:20,179
-What's the problem?
-I'm the problem.

141
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:23,766
It's all my fault. I got you acquitted,
you piece of trash.

142
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:26,727
So I should fix that. Aren't I right?

143
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:29,230
Try running away
thousands of times if you want.

144
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:31,440
I'll be sure to catch you each time.

145
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:36,821
Gosh, you're one tenacious jerk.

146
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:41,450
By the way, will you be all right?

147
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:45,121
That hole my knife made in your stomach
probably hasn't healed yet.

148
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:48,416
What about you? Will you be all right?

149
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:49,792
Are you okay with getting cuffed?

150
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:26,162
-Are you all right?
-Wait, Jung Hyeon-su...

151
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,590
Did you do that?

152
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:10,539
Sir, you're under arrest
for unlawful apprehension, confinement,

153
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:11,790
and attempted murder.

154
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:21,300
I'll leave this to you.

155
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:46,575
AMBULANCE

156
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:57,670
This is where Jung Hyeon-su's case began,

157
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:01,715
and it came to an end here.

158
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:04,426
You're right.

159
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:08,639
Can we talk?

160
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:23,529
I've been doing some thinking
on what you told me about my dad,

161
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:26,198
and what I did was wrong.

162
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:27,950
I was too harsh on you.

163
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,662
You didn't do anything wrong.

164
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:34,415
Chief Jang who brainwashed
and used a child

165
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:36,458
was the bad guy.

166
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,087
You were a victim in it too.

167
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:43,048
Knowing all of that,

168
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,801
I took it out on you.

169
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:47,845
I'm sorry.

170
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:50,639
It's okay.

171
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:53,434
Don't be sorry.

172
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,648
Your father...

173
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:03,193
saved my life.

174
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:06,322
After rescuing me...

175
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,910
he tried to save my parents...

176
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:14,872
but it didn't go well.

177
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:18,125
That's no one's fault.

178
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:24,757
You know that I'm hugely indebted to you.

179
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:27,301
I made you leave your job

180
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:29,303
and got involved with Jung Hyeon-su.

181
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:31,680
I also got you stabbed. You gave me a job,

182
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,515
and you gave me food and a place to stay.

183
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,185
The list is endless.

184
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:42,232
So...

185
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:44,526
we should just...

186
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:46,445
call it even.

187
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:48,739
Let's just...

188
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:51,408
go back to before all this happened.

189
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:53,953
Let's go back

190
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:55,704
to when we first met.

191
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:58,707
Great, that sounds good.

192
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:01,377
Okay.

193
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:03,837
Let's do that.

194
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,256
Yes, let's do that.

195
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,811
SEONHO DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

196
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:28,237
PROSECUTOR NOH JI-UK

197
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,374
Congratulations on your first day of work,
Prosecutor Noh.

198
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:46,088
Goodness. Thank you all for coming.

199
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:51,760
But there isn't a single person
I've wanted to see.

200
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,263
PROSECUTOR NOH JI-UK

201
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:56,432
Sir, I told you that it was
no use coming here.

202
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:59,101
I forgot what a jerk he was.

203
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:00,769
So did I.

204
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:02,771
I handed over Jung Hyeon-su's case to him.

205
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,898
So what, you punk?

206
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,608
Who is it that you wanted to see?

207
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:11,697
This is a difficult decision.

208
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,323
Out of the two, whom should I see first?

209
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:03,874
You may wait outside.

210
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:04,958
Yes, sir.

211
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:13,383
I was your lawyer, and now,
I'm the prosecutor of your case.

212
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:18,347
Don't you think that
we have a long history?

213
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,890
You seem happy about it.

214
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:22,434
I guess you like it, but I don't.

215
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:25,354
Get used to it. You'll face
a number of things you won't like.

216
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:29,691
There's a thing called protocol here,
so let me cover the bases first.

217
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,443
Your name is Jung Hyeon-su.

218
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:35,322
You are being investigated for escape,
attempted murder of Bang Eun-ho,

219
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:40,077
and for murders of Jang Hui-jun
and Yang Jin-wu. Do you understand?

220
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,453
No, I don't.

221
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:48,127
Mr. Jung Hyeon-su, you have the right
to remain silent to anything that--

222
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,045
May incriminate myself.

223
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,381
I have the right to consult to a lawyer.

224
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:54,967
Aren't I right?

225
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:58,637
Oh, my. You know it so well.
You're an expert.

226
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:01,014
I was informed that you confessed

227
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:03,934
to Prosecutor Cha
before she gave me this case.

228
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:05,102
I did?

229
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:08,605
That's news to me.

230
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:18,157
First off, I killed them all.

231
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:20,033
Whom shall I start with?

232
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:22,578
We first met in Chef Yang Jin-wu case,

233
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:23,871
so shall I start with him?

234
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:26,456
No. I take that back. Supa Apartment.

235
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:30,085
You've managed to confirm the identity
of only one body

236
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,545
found in the water tank there, right?

237
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,505
Shall I tell you who the other one is?

238
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:36,091
There's no reason for me to say no.

239
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:38,677
His name is Seong Jae-hyeon.

240
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:39,887
He and Jin-wu

241
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,972
went to the same high school.
Go ahead and check it.

242
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,769
What is it? I guess your memory
didn't fully recover, Mr. Jung.

243
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,232
I was recently in a car accident.

244
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:53,692
My memory isn't fully recovered.

245
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:55,694
In legal terms, they say that
I'm feeble-minded

246
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:57,738
and that I'm not of sound mind.

247
00:19:58,113 --> 00:19:59,239
-You know?
-No one knew

248
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:01,074
the identity of the body
in the water tank.

249
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:04,411
You were the only one who identified
the body. How do you explain that?

250
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:06,872
Well... I see.

251
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,792
I think I heard it when I was passing by.

252
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:13,170
Did I hear it in the toilet?
I think I heard it there.

253
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:18,133
Gosh, you are scary.

254
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:22,471
Jung Hyeon-su.

255
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:25,807
Hey, Jung Hyeon-su.

256
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:29,269
Hey, you. You are so cool.

257
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:32,439
You did your hair perfectly.
Do you have a lot of time on your hands?

258
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:34,149
Yes, we do have a lot of time
on our hands.

259
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:36,235
Let's see it through.

260
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:39,196
I am going to make you remember.

261
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:40,489
Got that?

262
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,218
Are you doing okay?

263
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:05,138
Well... I'm okay as you can see.

264
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,557
How about you, Mr. Ji?

265
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:09,601
You know.

266
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:13,522
I guess you're not doing well.

267
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:18,151
So what's going on with you?

268
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:24,449
Everything is blurry.

269
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,286
Is it about Ji-uk?

270
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:32,332
What about your feelings?
Are your feelings blurry too?

271
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,130
Don't overthink it.

272
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:40,382
Just follow your heart.

273
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:45,178
Mr. Ji, are you doing
what your heart tells you?

274
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:49,099
Yes.

275
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:53,729
I constantly fall in love
with this person...

276
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:56,606
as I follow my heart.

277
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,667
SEONHO DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

278
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:25,469
Me too, Mr. Ji.

279
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:28,722
I think I am like you.

280
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:32,726
I constantly fall in love with him.

281
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:43,945
What brings you here?

282
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:46,698
What do you mean? I'm here to work.

283
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:49,367
My client will be questioned as a suspect.

284
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:52,079
Really? Which case is it?

285
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:53,288
Who is the prosecutor in charge?

286
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:55,624
I will take care of it on my own.

287
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:58,418
Besides, I can't tell you.

288
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:00,337
It's a matter of my client's privacy.

289
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:03,882
You're right. Gosh, now you're
talking like a lawyer.

290
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:05,967
That's right. I am a lawyer.

291
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:08,303
Okay. Good luck.

292
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,514
You too, Mr. Noh...

293
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:12,974
I mean, Prosecutor Noh.

294
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,564
Bong-hui.

295
00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:29,491
Let's...

296
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:31,952
catch Jung Hyeon-su together.

297
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:35,497
Regardless of our positions,

298
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,665
we should...

299
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,835
catch him together. I need your...

300
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:43,547
No, I need everyone's help.

301
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:54,808
Mr. Bang, you will be reinstated
in the prosecutors' office?

302
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:57,185
Yes, the prosecution recruits
experienced investigators

303
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:59,271
whenever there's a vacancy.

304
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:01,773
Mr. Noh... I mean...

305
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:04,317
Since Prosecutor Noh returned,
I should too.

306
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:05,402
Twenty percent.

307
00:24:06,027 --> 00:24:08,613
I will increase your annual
salary by 20 percent.

308
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:13,827
You can't buy me with money.

309
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:16,746
-Fifty percent.
-What a thief.

310
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,206
-Then what about forty?
-Thirty.

311
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,749
-No way.
-Hey,

312
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:21,960
don't think about scouting him,

313
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:24,045
or distracting us in the meeting.
Concentrate.

314
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:25,172
Let's focus. Please?

315
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:26,840
Mr. Byeon, please focus!

316
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:29,718
Exactly. We are all here
because of Jung Hyeon-su.

317
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:32,262
Thanks to Mr. Byeon,
our meeting isn't going anywhere.

318
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:35,182
Now she's scolding me too.

319
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:43,690
All right. As of now, Jung Hyeon-su
just changed his confession.

320
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:45,859
We have the evidence, don't we?

321
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:48,862
He's right. The murder weapon
I found at his house.

322
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:54,326
We will disregard

323
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:56,578
-the murder weapon.
-Why?

324
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:59,206
Because it's fabricated. In other words,

325
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:01,666
it's illegally acquired evidence.
Any evidence from there

326
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:02,918
is a fruit of the poisonous tree.

327
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:06,338
FRUIT OF THE POISONOUS TREE:
ILLEGALLY OBTAINED, INADMISSIBLE EVIDENCE

328
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:08,965
We don't have any other evidence?

329
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:12,761
Even if he didn't take back
his confession,

330
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:14,554
according to the admissibility
of confessions,

331
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:17,098
we must find corroborating evidence
to get a conviction.

332
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:18,892
Hey,

333
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:21,603
he can be charged
with attempted murder though.

334
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:26,233
You two almost lost your lives
by Jung Hyeon-su's hands.

335
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:28,485
The charge for attempted murder
is too little.

336
00:25:28,568 --> 00:25:29,945
He might get probation.

337
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:32,030
In addition to that,
he will claim he's feeble-minded

338
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:33,073
and not of sound mind.

339
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:35,200
Gosh, what a scumbag.

340
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:39,454
That's why we have to find out more
about Jung Hyeon-su.

341
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:41,623
We have to find out more about his past.

342
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:44,042
We have to catch the driver
who hit Jung Hyeon-su and ran.

343
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:45,752
I'm on that.

344
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:49,631
He's one of the people
on the list I got from Mr. Ji.

345
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:51,341
His name is Min Yeong-hun.

346
00:25:51,841 --> 00:25:55,053
He's on the run now, but I found
the mistress he's seeing.

347
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:57,472
I have officers on stakeout to catch him.

348
00:25:57,555 --> 00:25:59,432
They will arrest him soon.

349
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:02,227
Yes, let's keep up the hard work
for just a bit longer.

350
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:25,834
It feels like I haven't seen you
in quite a while.

351
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:28,086
Does it?

352
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:30,839
It's not true though.
It's only been a few days.

353
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:33,550
Really? Is that right?

354
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:35,176
Maybe it's just the way I feel.

355
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:40,640
I'll pour it for...

356
00:26:56,072 --> 00:26:58,325
It's okay. I'll do it myself.

357
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:00,702
All right. Go ahead.

358
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:05,749
I'll get going.

359
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:07,709
Okay.

360
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:18,863
Hello?

361
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:21,199
Yes.

362
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:23,535
What's going on? Gosh.

363
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:26,579
Okay. Thank you. Bye.

364
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:29,290
I found him.

365
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:32,001
The police officer who was in charge.

366
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:35,380
Seriously?

367
00:28:35,713 --> 00:28:37,882
That's amazing. You rock, Mr. Bang.

368
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:39,926
It wasn't that much work.

369
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:42,929
I think I only had to reach out
to about 20 people.

370
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:54,941
Do you remember this girl?

371
00:28:58,486 --> 00:29:00,655
You oversaw her case, didn't you?

372
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:05,785
I do remember the case,
but I don't want to do it.

373
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:08,872
Why not, Detective?

374
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:12,167
I caught those jerks
and sent them to the prosecution,

375
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:14,878
but the case was dismissed
for non-prosecution.

376
00:29:15,336 --> 00:29:16,379
Non-prosecution?

377
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:20,425
Would we be able to find out
who the prosecutor in charge was?

378
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:33,605
How's it going in here? Is it tolerable?

379
00:29:34,397 --> 00:29:36,024
Just cut to the chase.

380
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:38,651
Okay, I will.

381
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:42,906
Please apologize...

382
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:45,992
again.

383
00:29:46,826 --> 00:29:49,913
I don't want an insincere apology
like the last time.

384
00:29:50,246 --> 00:29:52,999
I want a proper, formal apology.

385
00:29:56,169 --> 00:30:00,298
Looking at you sitting there
in that uniform

386
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:02,759
doesn't make me pity you at all.

387
00:30:03,676 --> 00:30:04,552
When I

388
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:06,387
think about what you did...

389
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:11,309
to me, my dad, and Mr. Noh
when he was a little boy,

390
00:30:12,101 --> 00:30:13,520
I think that this punishment

391
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:16,022
is way too light for you.

392
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:25,031
Will an apology...

393
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:26,866
be enough?

394
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,326
Yes, it will be.

395
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:31,287
But I won't make it that easy for you.

396
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:34,916
I found out that you were
in charge of the old case

397
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:36,918
Jung Hyeon-su was involved.

398
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:39,963
You acquitted guys who gang-raped a girl

399
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:42,674
and set them free.

400
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:46,386
Tell me about that case.

401
00:30:53,142 --> 00:30:54,185
Come in.

402
00:31:11,327 --> 00:31:12,328
Hey, you're back.

403
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:16,541
I just visited Chief Jang.

404
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:18,167
Oh, I see.

405
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:21,838
I was about to have dinner.
Do you want to join me?

406
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,214
What are you having?

407
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:24,299
Jjajangmyeon.

408
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:27,594
-Sounds good.
-Get the one with seafood.

409
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:28,928
-Double portion.
-Double portion.

410
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:49,699
Why do you think it is?

411
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:52,368
Jjajangmyeon always tastes the best here.

412
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:54,162
It never tastes this good anywhere else.

413
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:57,206
Then you should come here
whenever you crave jjajangmyeon.

414
00:31:57,749 --> 00:31:59,000
Shall I?

415
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:10,303
By the way, why did you visit

416
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,930
Chief Jang?

417
00:32:13,514 --> 00:32:15,892
I found out that he was the prosecutor

418
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:18,227
in charge of the case
Jung Hyeon-su was involved in.

419
00:32:20,813 --> 00:32:23,566
That case was just as we assumed.

420
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:25,568
It was a special rape case.

421
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:57,266
A few of the assailants

422
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,811
were from rich, well-connected families,

423
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:02,814
and their parents obviously wanted
the case to go away.

424
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:04,524
I'm sure they did.

425
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:06,734
They actually blamed the victim,
Park So-yeong,

426
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:09,612
for trying to ruin their sons' future.

427
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:13,032
A little while after that, she...

428
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:16,327
took her own life.

429
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:21,874
The prosecutor who dismissed
the case for non-prosecution is

430
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:23,668
chief prosecutor Jang Mu-yeong.

431
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:29,340
Jung Hyeon-su avenged her death
by killing the guys who got away with it.

432
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:37,015
Mr. Noh.

433
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:40,476
Still here?

434
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:43,187
I told you.
We have a lot of time on our hands.

435
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:44,856
Take your time.

436
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:50,319
Gosh.

437
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,199
Well...

438
00:33:55,658 --> 00:33:59,120
I didn't kill Yang Jin-wu and Lee Jae-ho,

439
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:01,122
but I do know those guys.

440
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:04,417
Those scumbags are really horrible people.

441
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:06,461
But...

442
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:09,172
one of those horrible scums

443
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:11,424
became a famous chef
that appears on TV regularly,

444
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:14,427
and others became a doctor
and a police officer.

445
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:17,805
They were living great lives,
and they even got married.

446
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:22,101
Guys like them shouldn't be allowed
to live good lives, don't you think?

447
00:34:23,686 --> 00:34:25,980
I don't know who killed them.

448
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:29,025
But whoever it was,
I think the killer did the right thing.

449
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:31,110
We should be grateful. Aren't I right?

450
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:34,197
What will you do...

451
00:34:35,114 --> 00:34:36,949
about the trial now?

452
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:42,246
I'll charge Jung Hyeon-su...

453
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:45,333
with rape.

454
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:49,378
What did you say? With what?

455
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:56,177
You're going to prosecute me for what?

456
00:34:57,011 --> 00:34:58,554
I'm going to prosecute you for

457
00:34:58,721 --> 00:35:00,681
raping an adolescent and gang rape.

458
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:08,064
Do you remember the hit-and-run driver?

459
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:09,357
His name is Min Yeong-hun.

460
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:13,361
He made a statement.

461
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:16,656
You were in on it too.

462
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:21,035
You bought him off, didn't you?

463
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:22,912
Did you give them money?

464
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:28,709
Gosh, can a prosecutor buy off a witness?

465
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:31,462
I don't know.

466
00:35:34,006 --> 00:35:37,009
I'll see you in trial, Mr. Jung Hyeon-su.

467
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:56,362
COURT IN SESSION

468
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:05,037
The defendants, Min Yeong-hun
and Jung Hyeon-su,

469
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:07,748
with the deceased Yang Jin-wu, Lee Jae-ho,

470
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:09,500
Kim Min-gu, Sung Jae-hyeon,

471
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:11,961
and Go Chan-ho who is missing,

472
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:14,630
lured the victim, Park So-yeong
to a warehouse in Hyeonjin-dong, Goyang,

473
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:17,258
around 5 p.m. on July 11, 2003.

474
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:18,968
After they lured the victim,

475
00:36:19,218 --> 00:36:21,262
they physically suppressed her resistance

476
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:22,597
and sexually assaulted the victim.

477
00:36:23,097 --> 00:36:25,766
Ergo, the prosecution moves to indict
Jung Hyeon-su and Min Yeong-hun

478
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,226
for the sexual assault charge

479
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:30,396
and for violation
of the law for the victim.

480
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:35,902
Defense counsel of Min Yeong-hun,
does he plead guilty of the charge?

481
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:40,448
Yes, Your Honor.
The defendant pleads guilty.

482
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:43,701
Defense counsel of Jung Hyeon-su,
does he plead guilty?

483
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:48,706
No, Your Honor.
The defendant pleads not guilty.

484
00:37:08,976 --> 00:37:11,395
WITNESS

485
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:14,482
Defendant, you admitted
that you sexually assaulted the victim

486
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:18,319
in a private warehouse
located in Hyeonjin-dong

487
00:37:18,527 --> 00:37:22,448
in July 2003 with your accomplices
in a gang rape.

488
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:24,909
Yes.

489
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:28,412
Moreover, Defendant,
during the questioning,

490
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:31,415
you pointed out seven individuals
as the violators of the victim.

491
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:33,918
-Is this correct?
-Yes, it is.

492
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:36,254
You first pointed yourself,

493
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:38,422
a famous chef, Yang Jin-wu,

494
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:40,341
Lee Jae-ho who was recently murdered,

495
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:42,927
Kim Min-gu and Sung Jae-hyeon
who were discovered in the water tank,

496
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:44,720
and Go Chan-ho who went missing.

497
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:45,930
And lastly...

498
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:50,142
you said the last accomplice...

499
00:37:51,143 --> 00:37:53,354
who was involved in the crime...

500
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:55,314
is here.

501
00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:58,484
Yes, he is here.

502
00:37:58,859 --> 00:37:59,902
Who is he?

503
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:02,280
Please point him out. Who is the violator?

504
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:16,544
Defendant Jung Hyeon-su.

505
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:18,504
What do you say,

506
00:38:19,046 --> 00:38:21,048
to Defendant Min Yeong-hun's testimony

507
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:24,427
that you were an accomplice?

508
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:25,720
I say it is absurd.

509
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:28,347
I believe a prosecutor fabricated evidence

510
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:31,392
and manipulated the witness.
The prosecutor is breaking the law.

511
00:38:37,773 --> 00:38:39,984
If so, how will you explain this?

512
00:38:44,071 --> 00:38:47,825
Your Honor, this is the incident report
from the victim

513
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:50,536
which I obtained from the detective
in charge of the case at that time.

514
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:55,124
As you can see here,
on the list of the seven violators,

515
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:58,544
Jung Hyeon-su's name is
clearly written here.

516
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:05,343
That's the report So-yeong
filled out 13 years ago?

517
00:39:06,635 --> 00:39:09,347
Even if the report still remains today,

518
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:13,100
don't you think
someone could've easily fabricated that?

519
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:15,186
Don't you agree, Prosecutor?

520
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:20,441
Or is that what you'd like to believe?

521
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:27,114
All right. Now, let us revisit
the day of the crime.

522
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:30,868
Defendant Jung Hyeon-su, at that time,

523
00:39:31,118 --> 00:39:33,829
you were quite close
to the rest of the six violators.

524
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:36,123
It is known that you went
to different schools.

525
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:39,502
You met often and spent time together.

526
00:39:40,002 --> 00:39:41,754
On July 11,
which was the day of the crime--

527
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:43,756
We weren't close.

528
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:47,885
Do you know how much I despised
and loathed them?

529
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:49,595
You're saying we were friends?

530
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:51,555
That's bullshit.

531
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:55,559
Defendant, only speak
when you are spoken to.

532
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:56,727
-I mean--
-Defendant.

533
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:59,480
Defendant, only speak
when the prosecutor asks you a question.

534
00:40:03,275 --> 00:40:04,527
Let us start again.

535
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:08,197
According to the report, on July 11, 2003,

536
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:11,033
around 5 p.m. to 6 p.m.,

537
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:13,244
Yang Jin-wu, one of the assailants,

538
00:40:13,327 --> 00:40:15,371
lured Park So-yeong

539
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:18,749
and brought her to a private warehouse
in Hyeonjin-dong.

540
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:19,917
Is this true?

541
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:23,421
It wasn't Yang Jin-wu. It was Lee Jae-ho.

542
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:24,422
Lee Jae-ho?

543
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:27,216
Was it Lee Jae-ho? I see.

544
00:40:27,883 --> 00:40:31,137
After Lee Jae-ho brought
Park So-yeong into the warehouse,

545
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:33,681
the victim wasn't in danger
in the beginning,

546
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:36,892
but Go Chan-ho who consumed alcohol
built up the atmosphere.

547
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:41,063
It says that Park So-yeong
tried to escape.

548
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:42,022
Is this true?

549
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:43,691
No, you have it all wrong.

550
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:46,485
It wasn't Go Chan-ho. It was that jerk.

551
00:40:49,321 --> 00:40:50,948
Min Yeong-hun and Yang Jin-wu

552
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:54,076
ran after So-yeong when she tried
to escape and dragged her back.

553
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,412
After that, Kim Min-gu--

554
00:40:56,495 --> 00:40:57,788
Gosh, you keep getting it wrong.

555
00:40:58,164 --> 00:41:00,374
It wasn't Kim Min-gu.
At first, Lee Jae-ho--

556
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:03,419
Defendant, you seem to know exactly
what happened on the scene

557
00:41:03,502 --> 00:41:05,629
as if you were there.

558
00:41:06,046 --> 00:41:07,256
It's because...

559
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:14,388
It's because...

560
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:18,559
I heard everything
from other people later on.

561
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:19,727
Fine.

562
00:41:20,352 --> 00:41:22,897
Then how many assailants
were on the scene?

563
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:25,107
There were seven.

564
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,281
That makes...

565
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:36,660
four people disappeared.

566
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:40,164
Now three more people have to disappear.

567
00:41:41,123 --> 00:41:42,041
Seven?

568
00:41:42,541 --> 00:41:44,960
Then can you tell me the names
of the seven violators?

569
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:46,545
You're pissing me off.

570
00:41:47,379 --> 00:41:49,006
Do I have to tell you the names?

571
00:41:49,131 --> 00:41:51,717
Yes, please. Tell me the names.

572
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:56,805
Lee Jae-ho, Yang Jin-wu, Min Yeong-hun,

573
00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:59,391
Kim Min-gu, Sung Jae-hyeon, Go Chan-ho...

574
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:02,603
And?

575
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:09,109
Let me try again.

576
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:15,866
Lee Jae-ho, Yang Jin-wu, Min Yeong-hun,

577
00:42:16,283 --> 00:42:18,702
Kim Min-gu, Sung Jae-hyeon, Go Chan-ho...

578
00:42:20,454 --> 00:42:21,288
And?

579
00:42:22,581 --> 00:42:23,624
And then...

580
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:25,584
You can't remember?

581
00:42:26,335 --> 00:42:27,253
Defendant.

582
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:29,421
Could it be...

583
00:42:30,172 --> 00:42:32,174
Who is the last assailant?

584
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:35,219
Defendant, answer the question.

585
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:38,806
Tell me who...

586
00:42:40,474 --> 00:42:41,642
the last assailant...

587
00:42:42,851 --> 00:42:43,894
is.

588
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:48,023
Hey, Jung Hyeon-su.

589
00:42:50,192 --> 00:42:51,110
It's you.

590
00:42:59,868 --> 00:43:01,161
Hey, it's you.

591
00:43:17,344 --> 00:43:19,013
It's likely that...

592
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:21,932
Jung Hyeon-su was the violator too.

593
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:28,814
HYUNJIN-DONG GANG RAPE CASE, 2003

594
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:32,234
This is the list of the assailants
the detective was keeping.

595
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:33,944
Jung Hyeon-su's name is on it too.

596
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:36,739
When I visited the victim's mother,

597
00:43:36,822 --> 00:43:39,283
she confirmed the same thing.

598
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:42,703
As soon as she saw
Jung Hyeon-su's old picture,

599
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:46,248
she remembered him
to be one of the violators.

600
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:47,666
What on earth...

601
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:49,960
happened?

602
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:53,047
I...

603
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:57,718
thought about it over and over.

604
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:00,596
When people are in great misery,

605
00:44:00,929 --> 00:44:03,807
sometimes, they get rid of their memories
or distort them.

606
00:44:04,099 --> 00:44:06,101
That's true. Just like my memory
of the fire accident.

607
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:09,897
Is it possible that he distorted
his own memory?

608
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:15,027
He couldn't stand the fact
that he was one of the attackers.

609
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:17,237
That's why he distorted his memory.

610
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:31,543
You jerk. What are you implying right now?

611
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:34,004
I wasn't one of them.

612
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:36,340
-You were.
-No, I wasn't.

613
00:44:37,549 --> 00:44:39,468
Do you think I'm a rapist
just like they are?

614
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:41,762
In the end, you are just like them.

615
00:44:42,429 --> 00:44:44,640
You are one of those jerks, aren't you?

616
00:44:45,474 --> 00:44:48,185
Prosecutor, ask your questions loudly

617
00:44:48,268 --> 00:44:49,645
so that the court can hear you.

618
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:54,691
I apologize, Your Honor.

619
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:56,318
I will continue.

620
00:44:58,278 --> 00:45:00,656
Defendant Jung Hyeon-su,
who was one of the assailants--

621
00:45:00,739 --> 00:45:02,157
I said I didn't do it!

622
00:45:03,575 --> 00:45:05,077
With six co-assailants,

623
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,995
he lured the victim, Park So-yeong,
to the warehouse

624
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:08,622
and violated her, as she resisted--

625
00:45:08,705 --> 00:45:09,790
How dare you!

626
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:10,874
Defendant!

627
00:45:12,292 --> 00:45:13,335
Let go of me!

628
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:20,676
You know me.

629
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:23,470
I'm not like those scums.

630
00:45:24,471 --> 00:45:25,806
Let me make it clear.

631
00:45:26,432 --> 00:45:28,767
I judged and punished them.

632
00:45:29,476 --> 00:45:30,394
You think so?

633
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:32,813
I killed all of those trashy scumbags.

634
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:34,231
You know that.

635
00:45:36,108 --> 00:45:37,067
Is that right?

636
00:45:40,028 --> 00:45:41,029
Is there evidence?

637
00:45:43,115 --> 00:45:44,533
Do you have evidence, Defendant?

638
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:47,995
Is there any evidence?

639
00:45:54,626 --> 00:45:55,502
You little...

640
00:45:57,463 --> 00:45:58,547
This was your plan, wasn't it?

641
00:46:02,885 --> 00:46:05,846
"Do you want to become one of them?
Or will you

642
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:08,599
just admit that you killed them all?"

643
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:09,850
That must've been your strategy.

644
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:13,437
What the defendant is saying
has no relevance to the trial.

645
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:14,480
Moving on.

646
00:46:14,563 --> 00:46:17,983
In violation of the Sexual Offenses Act
and Victim Protection Act,

647
00:46:18,066 --> 00:46:20,694
Jung has been charged with gang rape--

648
00:46:20,819 --> 00:46:21,820
Hyunjin-dong.

649
00:46:28,994 --> 00:46:30,370
The underpass in Hyunjin-dong.

650
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:40,672
If you go to the underpass
in Hyunjin-dong,

651
00:46:41,089 --> 00:46:44,092
you'll find all the evidence you're after,

652
00:46:44,176 --> 00:46:45,219
so stop now.

653
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:51,016
I'll go with you.

654
00:47:03,111 --> 00:47:05,656
I'll charge him with rape
so that I can provoke him.

655
00:47:06,406 --> 00:47:09,159
Judging from his patterns of behavior,

656
00:47:09,368 --> 00:47:13,080
being charged with rape
would gravely insult him.

657
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:15,832
When that happens,
I'll keep provoking him.

658
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:18,126
If we're lucky,
he might confess what he did

659
00:47:18,627 --> 00:47:19,920
and provide us with

660
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:21,922
corroborating evidence.

661
00:47:34,851 --> 00:47:37,104
That'd be all, Your Honor.

662
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:49,783
Defendant, please go back to your seat.

663
00:47:51,743 --> 00:47:52,619
Defendant.

664
00:49:26,963 --> 00:49:28,715
Yes, Mr. Bang.
Thank you for all of your work.

665
00:49:29,257 --> 00:49:32,260
Yes, please let Prosecutor Cha know
as well.

666
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:33,261
All right.

667
00:49:34,262 --> 00:49:35,263
Did they find it?

668
00:49:36,598 --> 00:49:38,975
Yes, they did. Both Go Chan-ho's body

669
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:41,228
and the murder weapon have been found.

670
00:49:41,895 --> 00:49:42,771
That's good news.

671
00:49:43,021 --> 00:49:45,524
That means we can charge him
with murder now, right?

672
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:47,192
Yes.

673
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:01,832
-Here you go.
-My gosh, thank you.

674
00:50:01,915 --> 00:50:03,500
-Thank you.
-Here.

675
00:50:06,002 --> 00:50:09,047
So? What's the truth about Jung Hyeon-su?

676
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:11,341
Was he really one of the assailants?

677
00:50:14,761 --> 00:50:16,346
He was a spectator.

678
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:17,389
What?

679
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:18,640
A spectator?

680
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:23,520
You know.

681
00:50:24,187 --> 00:50:25,313
Those helpless boys

682
00:50:25,397 --> 00:50:28,358
who neither stop his friends
nor join them.

683
00:50:29,234 --> 00:50:31,862
I know that Hyeon-su
has killed all the other guys,

684
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:33,488
but back then,

685
00:50:34,114 --> 00:50:35,323
he was a total loser.

686
00:50:36,032 --> 00:50:37,409
He couldn't even talk back to me.

687
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:41,037
We only found out later that...

688
00:50:41,997 --> 00:50:43,498
he had a crush on So-yeong.

689
00:50:47,502 --> 00:50:49,087
In summary, this must be what happened.

690
00:50:49,379 --> 00:50:51,965
He couldn't protect the girl he liked.

691
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:53,967
Whether it was because
he was cowardly or scared,

692
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:56,762
he took part in the crime and spectated.

693
00:50:57,179 --> 00:50:58,722
Because he couldn't come to terms with it,

694
00:50:58,847 --> 00:51:01,016
he distorted his own memories
and retaliated. Aren't I right?

695
00:51:01,141 --> 00:51:04,352
That's called cognitive dissonance.

696
00:51:04,603 --> 00:51:06,021
That is true,

697
00:51:06,104 --> 00:51:08,565
but it doesn't mean he deserves pity.

698
00:51:08,648 --> 00:51:10,484
What he did was wrong, period.

699
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:12,527
You're absolutely right.
Retaliating is one thing,

700
00:51:12,652 --> 00:51:15,655
but he also killed innocent people
who witnessed him

701
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:17,407
or got in his way.

702
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:21,661
Then what will happen with the trial now?

703
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:25,123
I think it'll be merged
with the trial for the original case.

704
00:51:25,207 --> 00:51:28,418
The confession he made during the trial
about killing the victims

705
00:51:28,502 --> 00:51:30,253
is recorded in the trial report.

706
00:51:30,378 --> 00:51:32,964
And we secured enough
corroborating evidence,

707
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:35,175
so getting him convicted of murder
won't be hard.

708
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:37,928
If that happens, will he...

709
00:51:38,637 --> 00:51:42,849
also be convicted of the murdering
Chief Jang's son, Jang Hui-jun?

710
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:47,604
That means...

711
00:51:47,813 --> 00:51:48,897
Ms. Lack of Evidence.

712
00:51:49,147 --> 00:51:51,775
Does it mean I should start calling you
Ms. Full of Evidence now?

713
00:51:53,109 --> 00:51:54,319
Why are you glaring at me?

714
00:51:54,402 --> 00:51:57,948
I'm just saying you are now
full of evidence of your innocence.

715
00:51:58,031 --> 00:51:59,115
You're right.

716
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:01,743
You can finally prove your innocence.

717
00:52:03,912 --> 00:52:05,205
Congratulations in advance, Ms. Eun.

718
00:52:06,164 --> 00:52:08,208
You put up a good fight, Ms. Lack of...

719
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:11,711
I mean, Lawyer Eun.

720
00:52:14,756 --> 00:52:17,259
Gosh, seriously.
Why are you guys being like this?

721
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:18,510
You're making me blush.

722
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:20,637
Is it making you itchy?

723
00:52:20,762 --> 00:52:21,805
Yes, it is.

724
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:23,557
You've been too focused on work.

725
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:25,350
Don't get the wrong idea, Mr. Bang.

726
00:53:05,515 --> 00:53:06,641
Wash these, too.

727
00:53:08,226 --> 00:53:11,104
I hadn't lost the ladder game
for a long time.

728
00:53:11,396 --> 00:53:14,065
With Ji-uk gone, the chances of losing
have gone up.

729
00:53:14,149 --> 00:53:15,650
I can definitely feel the change.

730
00:53:16,109 --> 00:53:17,068
I know, right?

731
00:53:17,152 --> 00:53:19,195
Shall we suggest hiring another lawyer?

732
00:53:19,279 --> 00:53:20,697
Someone who's handsome and young.

733
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:24,659
My gosh, aren't I enough?

734
00:53:26,494 --> 00:53:28,955
Then are you not satisfied
even with Ji-uk?

735
00:53:34,294 --> 00:53:35,378
How are things these days?

736
00:53:35,921 --> 00:53:38,924
Are things still awkward with Ji-uk?

737
00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:41,384
Yes, a little bit.

738
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:52,020
That's why I told you
to follow what your heart tells you.

739
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:15,335
Hurry. Go on.

740
00:54:26,596 --> 00:54:27,597
What's going on?

741
00:54:29,474 --> 00:54:32,602
Dude, even you are worse than I am. Gosh.

742
00:54:36,356 --> 00:54:37,440
What did I do? You jerk.

743
00:54:37,524 --> 00:54:38,566
What did you say?

744
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:39,651
-You little--
-Don't do that.

745
00:54:43,238 --> 00:54:44,614
That milk has gone bad.

746
00:54:46,157 --> 00:54:47,325
Darn it.

747
00:55:40,712 --> 00:55:42,630
Some memories just pop into my head.

748
00:55:59,606 --> 00:56:03,443
Defendant Eun Bong-hui planned to murder
her ex-boyfriend,

749
00:56:03,526 --> 00:56:05,695
Jang Hui-jun, after he broke up with her.

750
00:56:05,945 --> 00:56:10,533
On May 11, 2015, she lured the victim,
Jang Hui-jun, to her place.

751
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:13,870
Then she brutally murdered him
with a sharp knife.

752
00:56:14,913 --> 00:56:18,583
For this, I indict defendant
Eun Bong-hui for murder

753
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,376
under Article 250 of the Criminal Code.

754
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:23,463
You and I faced each other in court

755
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:26,674
as the prosecutor in charge
and a murder suspect.

756
00:56:26,925 --> 00:56:28,426
She premeditated the murder.

757
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:31,763
she didn't repent her crime
as she lied during the whole trial,

758
00:56:32,347 --> 00:56:34,474
and the victim's family is asking
for a serious punishment.

759
00:56:34,557 --> 00:56:35,892
Taking these into account,

760
00:56:35,975 --> 00:56:39,187
according to Article 250
of the Criminal Code,

761
00:56:42,357 --> 00:56:45,568
I ask that she be sentenced
to 15 years in prison...

762
00:56:46,486 --> 00:56:48,029
for the first-degree murder.

763
00:56:49,322 --> 00:56:50,907
You demanded that...

764
00:56:51,991 --> 00:56:53,618
I spend 15 years in prison.

765
00:56:54,619 --> 00:56:55,537
And...

766
00:56:55,954 --> 00:56:57,205
If there are two murder weapons,

767
00:56:57,914 --> 00:57:01,334
it means one of them is fabricated.

768
00:57:03,044 --> 00:57:06,464
Which means the weapons
are not admissible in court.

769
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:08,591
Ergo,

770
00:57:10,051 --> 00:57:12,303
according to Article 255
of Criminal Procedure Law,

771
00:57:15,515 --> 00:57:17,058
the prosecution moves
to dismiss the charge.

772
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:21,062
You rescued me...

773
00:57:22,063 --> 00:57:25,567
and I fell for you.

774
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:38,746
Now that I think about it, after that day,

775
00:57:39,414 --> 00:57:42,917
my life has been a series of
me falling for you over and over again.

776
00:57:44,252 --> 00:57:48,798
Even at this very moment,
I'm falling for you again.

777
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:28,982
-Who is it?
-Is Ms. Eun inside?

778
00:59:29,148 --> 00:59:30,817
-Bong-hui, get up.
-No, I can't.

779
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:32,068
I haven't even washed my face.

780
00:59:32,151 --> 00:59:34,153
I told you, you're still pretty
even when you are dirty.

781
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:36,823
Hey.

782
00:59:37,448 --> 00:59:39,284
I must be really drunk right now.

783
00:59:44,289 --> 00:59:46,624
-I got here so early.
-I think I'll be a little late.

784
00:59:46,708 --> 00:59:47,542
Bye.

785
00:59:50,295 --> 00:59:51,212
There's your morning kiss.

786
00:59:57,510 --> 00:59:59,512
