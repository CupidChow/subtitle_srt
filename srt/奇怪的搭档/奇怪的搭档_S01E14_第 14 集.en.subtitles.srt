1
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:24,602
Yes.

2
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:26,729
Yes, I understand.

3
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:29,357
And please brief me

4
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:32,110
about the status report
on the hit-and-run vehicle.

5
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:35,446
Okay.

6
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:41,995
Jung Hyeon-su is being transported
to Seonho Hospital.

7
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:44,956
He's going to arrive shortly
and get a surgery soon.

8
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:46,374
So?

9
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:48,793
Who was the informant?

10
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:55,675
Did I bring up a difficult subject?

11
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,510
What I'm asking is who tipped off

12
00:02:58,052 --> 00:03:01,180
about the knife in Jung Hyeon-su's house
with Mr. Bang's blood on it?

13
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:04,475
You wanted me to ride with you
to ask this question.

14
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:08,229
Prosecutor Cha, answer me.

15
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:11,524
It was an anonymous informant.

16
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:14,319
Even if I knew who it was,
I have to protect his or her identity.

17
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:17,739
You searched his house
with a warrant that was issued

18
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:19,616
based on a tip-off
by an anonymous informant?

19
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:21,367
Do you want me to believe that?

20
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:23,369
It doesn't matter if you do or not.

21
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:26,080
It's illegally obtained evidence.
The fruit of the poisonous tree.

22
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:29,208
No, I searched his house
with a properly issued warrant.

23
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:30,627
For me, this is legitimate evidence.

24
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:31,753
Cha Yu-jeong.

25
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:34,339
Whatever. I can't hear a word
you are saying right now.

26
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:37,217
To get the warrant, I put my job
on the line and searched his house.

27
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:38,801
But this is what has happened.

28
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:42,263
I'm in a tight spot now, Ji-uk.

29
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:43,806
I--

30
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:48,186
Yes?

31
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:52,315
What?

32
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:55,151
Okay. I'm on my way now.

33
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,281
I really saw it.

34
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:02,116
-Are you sure?
-Hey, punk.

35
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,619
Do you think I only see hallucinations?

36
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:07,705
Mr. Bang.

37
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:09,499
Mr. Bang...

38
00:04:12,126 --> 00:04:13,127
What is this?

39
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:16,673
You said he moved his finger.

40
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:19,217
That's what I wanted to say.

41
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,219
What did the doctor say?

42
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,554
Well, the doctor...

43
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:26,766
said that I might have been mistaken.

44
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:32,647
He really moved. Listen to me.

45
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:33,773
His finger--

46
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,442
Hey! It moved again! Look!

47
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:38,194
Look! It moved!

48
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:49,497
Hey, just wait a bit more. Okay?

49
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:52,709
His finger is going to move again.
Keep looking. My goodness.

50
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:03,469
It really moved.

51
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:05,138
Mr. Byeon.

52
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:07,765
Take a seat.

53
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:09,309
You should get some sleep.

54
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:12,729
Goodness.

55
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,357
GUKIL MEDICAL CENTER

56
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,374
ARRAIGNMENT

57
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:50,975
No, no way. That can't be.

58
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:52,351
Pardon?

59
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:54,145
-What?
-What did you say?

60
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:56,481
I didn't say anything.

61
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,987
If you are behind this, Eun-hyeok,
I'm going to

62
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:04,906
put you in prison. I mean it.

63
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,702
Why? Did I do something wrong?

64
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:12,205
What?

65
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,916
Why? What is it about?

66
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,377
I always wondered when we would be
friendly to each other again.

67
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:20,213
Is today the day?

68
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:22,215
Are we going to hold hands today?

69
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:24,217
How dare you.

70
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:32,725
We all know that all of us
are not in a good mood.

71
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:36,687
But we must still smile. That's how
good things will come to our way.

72
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:38,898
That's right.

73
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:45,154
Eun-hyeok, it's been a while
since you said something that made sense.

74
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:48,950
He's right. We must stay positive
for the good fortune to come

75
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,744
and that's how Mr. Bang
will wake up as well.

76
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,746
-You think so too, right?
-Of course.

77
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:57,416
Well, I agree with you guys on that.

78
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,229
I should tell you something
about Jung Hyeon-su.

79
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:21,107
Did he do something again?

80
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,945
-Well, that's--
-Ji-uk.

81
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:34,787
Mr. Bang.

82
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:36,873
Mr. Bang, are you awake now?

83
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:39,375
Can you see me? It's me, Ji-uk.

84
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:40,418
Ji-uk.

85
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:42,420
Yes, that's right. It's me, Ji-uk.

86
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:49,135
Mr. Bang.

87
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:52,013
Mr. Bang, it's me, Eun-hyeok.
Can you recognize me?

88
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,348
Of course, I can.

89
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:56,767
Eun-hyeok.

90
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:58,102
Hey.

91
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:02,064
Hey, what about me? Do you recognize me?

92
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,691
Mr. Bang, it's me!

93
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,735
-Yeong-hui.
-That's me!

94
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:08,779
My name is Yeong-hui. I'm Yeong-hui.

95
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:12,408
My goodness. But how dare you speak
to me informally? You jerk.

96
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:16,204
Gosh, I'm so happy that you're awake.

97
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:18,498
Good job. Good job for waking up.

98
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:21,417
My gosh. I'm so proud of you, Eun-ho.

99
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:22,960
My gosh, I can't believe this.

100
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:24,712
My goodness.

101
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:27,465
See? What did I tell you?

102
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:28,716
I told you so.

103
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:30,843
Wait here. I'll call the doctor.

104
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:41,270
Thank you. Thank you so much, Mr. Bang.

105
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:43,105
Thank you.

106
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:48,861
I'm so relieved.

107
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:58,538
My gosh, you startled me.

108
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,456
It's okay.

109
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:03,793
I'm so relieved.

110
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:07,463
Here's a breaking story.

111
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:10,550
The prosecution was pursuing
a murder suspect this afternoon.

112
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:13,803
The suspect, Mr. Jung, was escaping
with his motorcycle.

113
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:16,597
But he got hit by a hit-and-run vehicle
and is now in a coma.

114
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:20,518
Mr. Jung got transferred
to a hospital right after the accident,

115
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:24,438
and the police are currently trying
to trace the hit-and-run vehicle.

116
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:27,400
Some people are criticizing
if the prosecution carried out

117
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:32,113
a pressed investigation
or unreasonable chase.

118
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,091
Is he...

119
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:54,594
unconscious?

120
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:57,680
How ironic.

121
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:01,976
Now that one person is okay,
the other person falls into a coma.

122
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:05,021
If this happened during the arrest,

123
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:06,606
that means something was going on.

124
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:09,442
Does that mean they found evidence?

125
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:13,904
Well, I guess so.

126
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:19,994
What's going to happen to...

127
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:22,788
Jung Hyeon-su now?

128
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:26,167
He fell into a coma
in the process of getting arrested.

129
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,419
Therefore, we have to wait
until he wakes up.

130
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:33,007
If he's unconscious for a long time,
there will be a stay of indictment--

131
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,467
I'm sure he'll wake up.

132
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:43,184
No. He must wake up no matter what.

133
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,064
Did you trace the hit-and-run vehicle?

134
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:49,774
Yes, we found the car.

135
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:51,859
But the driver has disappeared.

136
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:54,111
What did the doctor say?

137
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:57,490
I don't know. Head injury this,

138
00:10:57,573 --> 00:10:59,533
internal bleeding in the abdomen that.

139
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:02,328
He said it might take some time
for him to regain consciousness.

140
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,748
There's also a risk of brain damage.

141
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,002
Are you okay?

142
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,045
No.

143
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:14,256
I got chewed out by the chief and deputy.

144
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:17,843
Hey, if I end up losing my job
as a prosecutor,

145
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:19,053
will you guys take me in?

146
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:22,056
I could go work at your firm.

147
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:26,310
Forget it. I won't go even if you beg me.

148
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:37,696
Prosecutor Cha, wait.

149
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:40,032
I have something for you.

150
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:43,744
Mr. Bang got this list

151
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:46,330
while he was looking into
Go Chan-ho and Jung Hyeon-su.

152
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:49,875
We both think the guy
who hit Jung Hyeon-su could be

153
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:50,960
on that list.

154
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:52,586
What do you mean?

155
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:53,754
That means

156
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:57,133
Jung Hyeon-su was planning to get revenge
on one of those guys.

157
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:58,676
And when that person found out,

158
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:01,178
he could've hit Jung Hyeon-su
with his car.

159
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:02,263
So are you saying that

160
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:05,141
he hit Jung Hyeon-su because he knew
Jung Hyeon-su was after him?

161
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:08,727
Yes. The most suspicious person
is on the top of the list.

162
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:11,147
I actually met him in person.

163
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:15,860
Okay. I'll look into these people.

164
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:35,337
I had...

165
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:38,549
so many questions to ask you,

166
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,634
and I was angry at you for so many things.

167
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:45,014
I was going to make sure that you'd get...

168
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:48,309
punished by law.

169
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,462
I'm sure it was Jung Hyeon-su,

170
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:18,255
but I wasn't able to see his face

171
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:20,132
because I failed to take off his mask.

172
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:23,385
I see.

173
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:26,096
Jung Hyeon-su's unconscious anyway.

174
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,015
He's practically got a stay of indictment.

175
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,391
So just focus on getting better.

176
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,268
It'd be better for you to testify

177
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,312
once Jung Hyeon-su wakes up.

178
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:35,022
Okay.

179
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:36,941
But...

180
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:39,818
why are they always here?

181
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:44,073
We're holding a meeting right now.

182
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:48,494
It's a small case,
but I think it's very meaningful.

183
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:49,954
So I think we should take this case.

184
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,789
No way.

185
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:53,791
We'll make no money out of this.

186
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:55,960
Cases like this
turn into a bigger lawsuit later on.

187
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:56,961
Be quiet.

188
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:58,879
You're the one who should be quiet.

189
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:01,048
Can you do something about this, Mr. Noh?

190
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:03,717
Just a few days ago,

191
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:06,345
you were calling him, "Ji-uk."

192
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,306
And Mr. Noh said, "Eun-ho."

193
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:12,518
Hey, you even called me, "Yeong-hui."

194
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:14,895
How dare you speak to me informally?

195
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:18,774
I want to get discharged.

196
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:21,110
No, Eun-ho. You can't.

197
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:23,612
No one's on my side.

198
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:49,680
Congratulations
on getting discharged, Mr. Bang.

199
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:51,223
Thank you, Ms. Eun.

200
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:52,683
I sincerely congratulate you.

201
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:55,060
But I really look forward to leaving.

202
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:56,228
I'm sick of this place.

203
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:57,897
Me too. Let's go.

204
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,148
I'm so sick of here.

205
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:00,316
We're finally getting out!

206
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,319
You barely managed to live.

207
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:04,737
SEONHO DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

208
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:05,696
Here's the next news.

209
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:09,158
The suspect who got into an accident
and fell into a coma during the arrest

210
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:11,911
turned out to be the defendant
accused of Chef Yang's murder

211
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:14,246
who was acquitted.

212
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:17,416
This sparks controversy on the possibility
of a vindictive investigation.

213
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,835
The new government have
already criticized the prosecution

214
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,462
for violating people's human rights.

215
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:24,965
This incident sure is embarrassing
for the prosecution.

216
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,759
During the investigation process...

217
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:33,474
The press is having a field day.

218
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:37,061
Why did this have to happen
at such a bad time

219
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:39,188
when everything has gotten out of hand?

220
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:41,565
Why did you

221
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:43,859
even think about risking your job?

222
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:46,278
You should never do
something like that so thoughtlessly.

223
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:47,821
You can't gamble with your life.

224
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:49,114
Stop it already.

225
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:51,033
I might as well just sew your mouth.

226
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:04,254
I'm sorry, sir.

227
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:08,342
Unfortunately, similar cases have occurred
continuously recently so--

228
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:10,302
You've stained
the prosecution's reputation.

229
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:12,304
I'm sorry, sir.

230
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:14,056
But...

231
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:17,142
Call the correspondents.

232
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:18,310
Yes, sir.

233
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:27,444
-He's here.
-Look, he's here.

234
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:28,862
-Over there.
-Look.

235
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:35,953
Was this a vindictive investigation
because Mr. Jung got acquitted?

236
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:38,914
Are you not catching Mr. Go on purpose,
or have you failed to catch him?

237
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,500
Do you plan to punish the prosecutor
who was in charge of the arrest?

238
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:44,503
People think you're only visiting
the hospital for publicity.

239
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:46,213
What's your opinion?

240
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:48,465
Are you aware that the people wish
to reform the prosecution?

241
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:51,301
Once the investigation
on the prosecutor in charge is done,

242
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,137
we'll carry out a punishment.

243
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:56,724
But it is hard to tell
what level of punishment it will be.

244
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:17,077
I still think Jung Hyeon-su

245
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:19,038
is the real culprit, sir.

246
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:23,333
Not only did he kill Chef Yang
and Lee Jae-ho,

247
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:24,918
but he also killed--

248
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:26,879
Be quiet. Shut that mouth!

249
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,634
How incompetent do you have to be...

250
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:36,388
to humiliate me like this?

251
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:44,438
Don't ever...

252
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:47,566
stain the prosecution's reputation again.

253
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:50,402
Do you understand?

254
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:20,516
My gosh, I don't even remember
the last time

255
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,726
I was able to come home
feeling relaxed like this.

256
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:26,563
Same here. We also haven't had
a relaxed conversation like this

257
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:27,940
in such a long time, right?

258
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:31,985
And talking and smiling like this,
just the two of us.

259
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:33,445
That's right. Just the two of us...

260
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:44,665
Just the two of us.

261
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:49,002
I guess it is just the two of us here now.

262
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:53,465
Is there... I don't think
anyone else is here.

263
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:59,179
Shall I make you something to eat?

264
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:01,181
No, I'll go take a shower first.

265
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:05,102
You'll take a shower?

266
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,607
All right, go ahead.

267
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:12,651
Okay.

268
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:55,986
Well... Do you want some beer?

269
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:00,324
Come here.

270
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:03,619
This is only our second day.

271
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:05,829
Our second day?

272
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:09,166
We should exclude the days
Mr. Bang was bedridden

273
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:11,084
because we couldn't do anything.

274
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:13,879
You're right.
We actually weren't able to do...

275
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:15,714
anything.

276
00:20:16,506 --> 00:20:17,507
So come here.

277
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:23,096
Come here!

278
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,681
Here.

279
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:32,314
Look at all this foam.

280
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:33,941
Cheers!

281
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:46,411
You must have been so stressed out.

282
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:54,086
Yes, I have been very stressed out,

283
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:57,422
because of my girlfriend
who keeps calling me Mr. Noh.

284
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:02,469
Then what should I do?

285
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:05,138
Am I supposed to change the way
I address you overnight?

286
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:06,098
Yes.

287
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:08,475
Shall I give it a try?

288
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:12,354
Darling.

289
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:15,649
You almost cracked up.

290
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:17,734
No, I didn't.

291
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:19,611
Then should I keep doing it? Darling.

292
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:22,864
You cracked up. Goodness.

293
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,324
No, I was just teasing you.

294
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:25,450
I'll never do it again.

295
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:27,744
-I was teasing you. Come on.
-Don't make me do it. I won't.

296
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:30,539
You're better at it than I am.

297
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:32,541
Say darling.

298
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:33,959
-No, you say it.
-Darling.

299
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:35,794
I want you to call me like that.
Just once.

300
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,587
-Just one time, please.
-I don't want to.

301
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:39,548
-Do it for me.
-I'll never say it.

302
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:40,924
You cracked up.

303
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,680
About Jung Hyeon-su's accident...

304
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:48,974
It's quite complicated.

305
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:53,228
Prosecutor Cha left with a warrant
after getting an anonymous tip

306
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:55,063
and told me about it.

307
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:58,567
Then Jung Hyeon-su fled.

308
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:00,610
Shortly after that,

309
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:03,280
he got into an accident.

310
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:11,621
Then...

311
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:15,375
has the hit-and-run driver who hit him...

312
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:18,128
not been caught yet?

313
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:20,422
The vehicle was found,
but no one was inside.

314
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:22,924
The car was rented with a fake ID,
and the driver...

315
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:24,634
has taken to the hills.

316
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:26,511
I see.

317
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:33,435
-Are you sleepy?
-No.

318
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:34,519
I'm fine.

319
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:37,898
I'm really okay.

320
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:24,778
I'm here.

321
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:26,613
Welcome back!

322
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,909
Congratulations on your first day back!

323
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:33,870
-Thank you.
-We're so glad to have you back!

324
00:23:35,413 --> 00:23:39,000
What are you guys doing right now?
Who's going to clean up this mess?

325
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:41,461
I'll clean it up. I'll...

326
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:43,338
What was that about?

327
00:23:43,421 --> 00:23:45,298
Goodness. You should clean it up, Mr. Noh.

328
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:46,550
Hey, you clean this up!

329
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:47,801
What's the matter with him?

330
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:49,803
Congratulations!

331
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:51,429
-Thank you!
-Welcome back!

332
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:55,183
It is clearly a violation
of the franchise law.

333
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:57,811
However, proving the losses caused by it
won't be easy.

334
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,021
It will be very tricky indeed.

335
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:03,441
Soon, punitive damages will be
introduced to the system as well.

336
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:07,904
If this happened in the US,
the amount would have been huge.

337
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:11,366
Speaking of which, people there

338
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:15,453
always make sure to strictly punish
companies in such cases.

339
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:19,499
I'll tell you what happened
when I first went to the US.

340
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:22,836
My wife used to be very pretty.

341
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:25,422
Some blond jerks started hitting on her,

342
00:24:25,505 --> 00:24:28,383
calling her a pretty girl or a cutie.

343
00:24:28,466 --> 00:24:30,051
Gosh, here he goes again.

344
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:33,471
What? What did you just say?

345
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:35,765
Nothing. I didn't say anything.

346
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:37,434
I should put up with it. He's the father.

347
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:39,477
I'm not your father.

348
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:44,107
I didn't say you're my father.
You have great hearing.

349
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:46,484
Get her out of here.

350
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:48,486
Gosh! It's a complete mess here!

351
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:50,947
It's a total mess!

352
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:54,576
Can we please have a proper meeting
at least once?

353
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:57,495
-Excuse me.
-Great! Just like him, okay?

354
00:24:57,579 --> 00:24:59,289
Please go ahead, Mr. Bang.

355
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:01,708
It's actually not about work.

356
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:04,044
Something seems a bit off to me.

357
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:09,674
Shall I say something is missing?

358
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:12,761
As you know, I was in a coma.

359
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:17,182
Oh, that's right. Did you have
an out-of-body experience?

360
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:18,808
I heard it happens to some people.

361
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:21,478
I heard some people
go to the underworld and come back.

362
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:22,729
Gosh, are you serious?

363
00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:24,189
Bong-hui.

364
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:26,524
I hope you end up in the fiery pit.

365
00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:31,363
I didn't experience any of that.

366
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:36,409
But I think I had some dreams.

367
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:41,289
I remember a few of them.

368
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:45,585
Wake up already, will you?

369
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:50,674
If you wake up,
I'll donate all of my assets.

370
00:25:51,424 --> 00:25:54,719
No, let me correct that.
I'll give them all to you.

371
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:56,805
You can have it all, okay?

372
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:58,932
I'll even change the name of our firm.

373
00:25:59,015 --> 00:26:02,727
I'll take out my surname
and include yours.

374
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:05,438
Noh, Ji, and Bang.

375
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:07,274
I remember it vividly.

376
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:12,028
I never said such a thing.

377
00:26:15,448 --> 00:26:17,242
If you ever lose the ghost leg game,

378
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:18,952
I'll do it for you.

379
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:21,538
You can count on me every single time.

380
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:25,000
So please wake up, okay?

381
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:33,508
Mr. Bang.

382
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:36,928
Please wake up already.

383
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:40,849
Why did you have to end up like this
after working so hard?

384
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:43,184
Please just wake up.

385
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:47,230
Then I'll hire an office manager
as well as a secretary for you.

386
00:26:47,605 --> 00:26:51,109
You can have
your own secretary and driver.

387
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:55,613
I earn a lot of money, you know.
I don't have anywhere to spend it.

388
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:03,580
What a fun, imaginative dream.

389
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:30,607
Oh, right. Mr. Bang's medication.

390
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:36,821
If I pass by a pharmacy, remind me
to pick up Mr. Bang's medication.

391
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:41,159
SEARCHING

392
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:57,759
I've forgotten about it,
but who could it have been?

393
00:27:58,468 --> 00:28:01,179
The person who left the knife
at Jung Hyeon-su's house.

394
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:04,474
Then...

395
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,394
the culprit must be one of them--

396
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:08,645
Culprit of what?

397
00:28:15,318 --> 00:28:17,362
I've been reading...

398
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:21,699
a detective novel lately.
I'm trying to figure out the culprit

399
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:23,576
in the novel.

400
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:25,703
My mom once told me

401
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:28,540
that the one who appears
at the very moment is the culprit.

402
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:30,542
He's the culprit.

403
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:36,172
You two, get out of my way.

404
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:40,260
It's my turn to do the dishes.

405
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:22,635
You know that weapon
which is the fabricated evidence?

406
00:29:25,054 --> 00:29:26,055
I...

407
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,268
I decided not to use it after all.

408
00:29:31,394 --> 00:29:32,312
But...

409
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:37,609
I don't know if I have made
the right choice or not.

410
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:41,237
He's definitely the culprit.

411
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:43,907
He even admitted the crimes himself.

412
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:50,205
But I don't know if taking the high road,
acting all righteous...

413
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:54,584
Is this okay? Am I doing the right thing?

414
00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:58,213
You are supposed to teach me these things.

415
00:29:58,296 --> 00:30:01,424
You are supposed to scold me
when I do something wrong.

416
00:30:05,678 --> 00:30:07,055
So please...

417
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:13,394
Please wake up soon.

418
00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:15,623
As an officer of the law, I am ashamed.

419
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:19,377
But sometimes,

420
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:21,880
I ought to use my fists than the law.

421
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:39,397
Mr. Lee.

422
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:41,149
Yes.

423
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:43,776
You're suspected of starting a fire

424
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,862
at a house at 746, Haein-dong.
In other words,

425
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:48,323
you're under investigation
for attempted incendiarism.

426
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:50,158
You're aware of it, right?

427
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:51,242
Yes, I am.

428
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:53,828
I've already told the police everything.

429
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:58,249
Even if you did, you still need
to tell me everything again.

430
00:31:59,792 --> 00:32:00,793
I see.

431
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:02,086
Yes.

432
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:04,589
Then shall we begin?

433
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:08,885
I started a fire in Dobu-dong
two years ago, and someone died.

434
00:32:08,968 --> 00:32:11,930
But someone else got arrested
as the culprit,

435
00:32:12,847 --> 00:32:15,558
so I confessed everything
to the police as I felt too guilty.

436
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:19,604
But you're saying
I have to tell you again, right?

437
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,522
That's correct.

438
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:25,526
What did you just say?

439
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:29,656
We, at the prosecution,

440
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:32,700
cannot make any more mistakes.

441
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,495
What I'm saying is...

442
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:38,581
we can no longer betray
the people's trust.

443
00:32:39,582 --> 00:32:40,750
Do you understand?

444
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:47,090
How have you been, Mr. Kang?

445
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:50,385
Not bad, thanks to you.

446
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:54,305
Why are you thanking me?
You're locked up here because of me.

447
00:32:56,766 --> 00:32:59,352
I'd like to ask you to defend me
for my appeal.

448
00:32:59,435 --> 00:33:02,313
Well, you lost the first trial
because of me.

449
00:33:02,605 --> 00:33:03,940
Why would you want me?

450
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:05,233
You're the only one

451
00:33:05,858 --> 00:33:07,568
I can count on.

452
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:08,653
I...

453
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:12,448
really can't stand
being falsely accused like this.

454
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:16,119
I never started any fire.

455
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:18,746
So please

456
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:21,249
help me just this once.

457
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:23,209
Please?

458
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,461
Please...

459
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:33,136
Two years ago, Kang Seon-il

460
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:35,805
was arrested as the culprit
of the Dobu-dong arson case.

461
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:37,140
The victim was...

462
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:39,642
this man.

463
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:41,728
His was Chae Seong-wu,
who was sleeping at home.

464
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:43,312
He suffocated to death at the scene.

465
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:46,607
Kang Seon-il was sentenced
to ten years in prison at his first trial.

466
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:47,775
What about motive?

467
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:50,570
The prosecution insisted
that it's a revenge crime.

468
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:54,282
Kang Seon-il's daughter got hit
by Chae Seong-wu's car and died.

469
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:56,659
Chae Seong-wu, who was drunk
and didn't have a driver's license,

470
00:33:56,784 --> 00:33:59,579
got released without any punishment
due to diminished capacity.

471
00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:00,705
Goodness.

472
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:03,750
From the forensics report alone,

473
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:06,711
I don't think it can be concluded
that Kang Seon-il

474
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:08,504
is the arsonist.

475
00:34:08,963 --> 00:34:09,881
I know, right?

476
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,967
The incompetent lawyer
who lost that first trial

477
00:34:13,676 --> 00:34:14,677
was me.

478
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:17,513
But the trial on appeal
will take place soon.

479
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:19,849
He wants me to defend him once again.

480
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:23,019
But I've already lost once,

481
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:25,354
so I'm feeling unsure and not confident.

482
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:26,606
Help me.

483
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:28,357
Ji-uk, help me out.

484
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:30,443
Ms. Eun and Mr. Bang,
please help me with this.

485
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:32,904
I don't want to.

486
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:36,199
Last time, you insisted on helping me
when I asked you not to.

487
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:38,868
I only helped you
because you begged me not to help you.

488
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:41,412
Okay. Then don't help me.

489
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:42,622
All right, I won't.

490
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:45,166
You should offer help
if I tell you not to help me.

491
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:47,418
He doesn't seem so bright, does he?

492
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:48,377
No, not really.

493
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:50,421
He said his IQ is very high.

494
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:51,464
I'm not sure if it's true.

495
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:54,008
I really think Kang Seon-il is innocent.
I'm serious.

496
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:55,093
With Jung Hyeon-su...

497
00:34:58,179 --> 00:34:59,597
we thought the same.

498
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:03,851
And...

499
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:06,938
I'm sorry...

500
00:35:08,981 --> 00:35:10,566
but I don't want to work on...

501
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:15,530
arson cases.

502
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:23,287
My apologies.

503
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,499
I totally forgot about that, Ji-uk.
I'm sorry.

504
00:35:30,169 --> 00:35:32,255
Ms. Eun, how about you take the lead
on this one?

505
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:34,006
We'll give you the support you need.

506
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:38,261
Well, I'm not so comfortable
with it either.

507
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:41,848
My dad

508
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:44,183
also passed away in fire.

509
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,942
But I'll think about it.

510
00:36:02,201 --> 00:36:04,078
A mistake with the prosecution.

511
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:05,204
A fire.

512
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:10,251
And it's a revenge crime.

513
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:13,045
Revenge.

514
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:21,137
Can you recognize him?

515
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:27,226
This man

516
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,603
is the one who

517
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:30,938
killed your mom and dad.

518
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:33,399
Okay?

519
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:55,296
Did you sleep well?

520
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:57,131
Yes.

521
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:03,012
Come on.

522
00:37:03,137 --> 00:37:05,264
Go take a shower and get dressed up.

523
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:09,310
-What?
-We're going out on a date today.

524
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:18,027
A date?

525
00:37:56,899 --> 00:37:58,734
You really wanted to come here?

526
00:37:58,943 --> 00:37:59,944
Yes!

527
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:07,618
All right. I guess
you are good at these games?

528
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:09,453
All right.

529
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:13,082
Getting a stuffed doll
out of the claw machine isn't so easy.

530
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:16,085
People don't think it'd be hard
because the stuffed dolls are cute.

531
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:17,295
They will be in trouble then.

532
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,714
You have to be circumspect. Look at this.

533
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:22,216
Do it just like this. All right.

534
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:29,640
Here I go.

535
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:41,694
-Can I give it a try?
-Sure.

536
00:38:41,777 --> 00:38:42,945
Give it a shot.

537
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:03,049
Mr. Noh?

538
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:07,136
Bong-hui, do you want to try this?

539
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:08,971
-Shall we?
-Okay.

540
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:10,389
Here we go.

541
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,727
It's beside you. No, no.

542
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:16,062
No, I'm in trouble.

543
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:17,313
Hold on.

544
00:39:18,397 --> 00:39:19,607
No, no.

545
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:24,487
Oh, no. What do I do?

546
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:26,364
Mr. Noh, hold on.

547
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:27,990
Wait.

548
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:37,500
There you go.

549
00:39:41,587 --> 00:39:42,588
You fool.

550
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:44,507
Darn. It's ruined.

551
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:49,845
Gosh, I won.

552
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:55,434
Mr. Noh? Mr. Noh!

553
00:40:32,304 --> 00:40:34,432
How can you get upset
because of those games?

554
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:36,976
No, I'm not upset. I'm not upset at all.

555
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:38,477
Mr. Noh.

556
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:43,816
It's not that you are bad, honey.
I'm just that good.

557
00:40:43,899 --> 00:40:45,901
You were really good though.

558
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:47,445
I'll let you win next time.

559
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:49,071
No, that's okay. Don't ever let me win.

560
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:51,157
The next time we play
will be the game that counts.

561
00:40:52,324 --> 00:40:53,951
This is nothing to get serious about,

562
00:40:54,034 --> 00:40:55,286
but I'm in.

563
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:56,579
Bring it on. Okay!

564
00:41:08,757 --> 00:41:09,925
Hold on.

565
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:14,346
BUY MEDICATION FOR MR. BANG

566
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:16,765
That's right, Mr. Bang's medicine.

567
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:20,144
Let me go to a pharmacy for a second.

568
00:41:20,227 --> 00:41:21,103
Okay.

569
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:29,737
Goodness, son!

570
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:32,364
-What's this?
-Ji-uk!

571
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:33,449
Mom.

572
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:36,494
Mom, why are you here?

573
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:40,039
Mr. Byeon insisted on having dinner today.

574
00:41:40,122 --> 00:41:42,500
He said there's a good sundaeguk place
around this area.

575
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:43,584
Really?

576
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:45,044
Why are you here, Ji-uk?

577
00:41:47,254 --> 00:41:48,839
Well, I...

578
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:51,091
This is perfect.
Let's have dinner together.

579
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:53,052
Come on.
Join us and let's have a meal today.

580
00:41:53,135 --> 00:41:55,304
Mom, the truth is I have...

581
00:41:56,555 --> 00:41:58,140
someone with me.

582
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:01,018
You do? Who is it?

583
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:03,354
Well...

584
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:06,732
Is it your girlfriend?

585
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:10,945
Yes.

586
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:12,279
Goodness.

587
00:42:15,407 --> 00:42:17,117
What's wrong, Mom?
You are not happy about that?

588
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:19,161
-No, I am happy.
-Hold on.

589
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:20,913
I'm happy to hear that.

590
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:24,625
What's going on? What is this?

591
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:26,710
He called her Mom.

592
00:42:27,628 --> 00:42:28,671
Mom?

593
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:30,673
Is she your daughter?

594
00:42:30,756 --> 00:42:33,259
I didn't know anyone could become
a lawyer these days.

595
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:38,722
Mom. Recently, there was a verdict
that workplace harassment

596
00:42:39,181 --> 00:42:41,267
can be considered
an industrial accident as well.

597
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:42,393
Just keep that in mind.

598
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:47,106
Mom, why do I get the feeling your boss
is always eavesdropping on us?

599
00:42:47,189 --> 00:42:48,649
Or is it just me?

600
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:49,942
It's because her life is boring.

601
00:42:50,025 --> 00:42:51,193
Yeong-sun!

602
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:56,282
Goodness.

603
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:58,033
What do I do?

604
00:42:58,117 --> 00:43:01,245
You got a girlfriend, Ji-uk.

605
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:03,289
Wait a second, Mom.

606
00:43:03,372 --> 00:43:04,373
Okay.

607
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:13,591
Why?

608
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:15,426
I can't.

609
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:32,818
Gosh.

610
00:43:38,741 --> 00:43:40,409
Bong-hui, hold on. Bong-hui!

611
00:43:40,492 --> 00:43:41,619
-Bong-hui, wait!
-Ji-uk!

612
00:43:41,744 --> 00:43:44,413
Ji-uk!

613
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:46,874
Gosh.

614
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:48,626
What is it?

615
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:51,211
Why is she running away?

616
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:54,381
Exactly. Why is she running away?

617
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:05,601
I'm doomed.

618
00:44:06,226 --> 00:44:07,478
I'm completely doomed.

619
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:19,156
Gosh.

620
00:44:19,239 --> 00:44:22,159
You brought us kimchi
and side dishes on this hot day.

621
00:44:22,242 --> 00:44:23,827
Thank you so much.

622
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:28,248
I'm sorry I didn't get to visit earlier
when you took in my daughter.

623
00:44:29,291 --> 00:44:31,919
Anyway, we will enjoy
the kimchi and pizza, Ms. Park.

624
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:35,089
Goodness, you didn't have
to address me like that.

625
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:41,512
I didn't know that

626
00:44:41,595 --> 00:44:46,392
you had a bright halo around your head.

627
00:44:46,475 --> 00:44:47,476
Excuse me?

628
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:52,731
Sure, it's shining.

629
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:54,274
Thank you for your compliment.

630
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:56,360
It's bright.

631
00:44:56,485 --> 00:44:58,445
Thank you for the pizza.

632
00:44:59,321 --> 00:45:00,656
Gosh, you are so loud.

633
00:45:00,739 --> 00:45:02,741
Don't laugh so loudly. You should go home.

634
00:45:03,575 --> 00:45:04,576
Say hello.

635
00:45:06,787 --> 00:45:08,705
Who is she?

636
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:13,669
You are the prosecutor
who saved Bong-hui, right?

637
00:45:14,628 --> 00:45:15,754
Are you Bong-hui's--

638
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:17,214
I'm Bong-hui's mom.

639
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:18,966
Goodness.

640
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:21,677
There's another one around his head too.

641
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:24,972
Who is it between you two?

642
00:45:28,308 --> 00:45:32,104
I haven't formally introduced myself.
I am Noh Ji-uk.

643
00:45:32,187 --> 00:45:34,231
Hello.

644
00:45:34,481 --> 00:45:35,649
Yeong-sun?

645
00:45:39,945 --> 00:45:41,196
Ms. Hong.

646
00:45:43,532 --> 00:45:47,119
The CEO your daughter talked about is...

647
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:49,163
my son?

648
00:45:51,665 --> 00:45:55,252
No way. Is he your son?

649
00:45:58,464 --> 00:46:01,800
Ji-uk, you are not dating her daughter,

650
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:03,260
right?

651
00:46:03,343 --> 00:46:05,554
I think it's a bit rude to say that.

652
00:46:05,679 --> 00:46:06,722
Ms. Hong.

653
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:08,223
What is it, Yeong-sun?

654
00:46:08,891 --> 00:46:10,976
Since we are about the same age,

655
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:13,270
I'd appreciate if you'd show me
some respect like I do.

656
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:15,189
Pardon?

657
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:17,483
We should leave them
to handle their own businesses.

658
00:46:17,566 --> 00:46:19,860
We should go out and talk.

659
00:46:21,236 --> 00:46:24,990
Goodness, how can a mother
with a daughter be so confident?

660
00:46:25,699 --> 00:46:28,577
You're so old-fashioned.
Are you bragging because you have a son?

661
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:29,912
She's lame.

662
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:32,080
So what?

663
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:35,250
What are you going to do
if I don't approve of their relationship?

664
00:46:35,334 --> 00:46:37,252
Mom, that was out of line.

665
00:46:37,794 --> 00:46:39,379
I don't approve either.

666
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:41,840
Sure. Go ahead
and don't give your blessing.

667
00:46:42,591 --> 00:46:43,842
What's wrong with my daughter?

668
00:46:43,926 --> 00:46:45,302
Having you as her mother!

669
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:49,014
I'm scared of her.

670
00:46:54,853 --> 00:46:56,271
Ms. Eun.

671
00:46:57,773 --> 00:46:58,857
Bong-hui!

672
00:47:13,789 --> 00:47:14,873
Mom.

673
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:16,375
We're dating.

674
00:47:18,752 --> 00:47:20,420
Ji-uk!

675
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:23,882
Act surprised.

676
00:47:24,466 --> 00:47:25,801
-My gosh!
-My goodness!

677
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:29,429
Smile, Bong-hui.

678
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:45,487
SEONGBUK-DONG ASSAULT INCIDENT

679
00:47:54,496 --> 00:47:55,497
Sir.

680
00:47:55,831 --> 00:47:57,207
It really wasn't me.

681
00:47:57,332 --> 00:47:58,792
I drove my taxi during the day.

682
00:47:58,875 --> 00:48:01,920
It was the driver on the night shift
who fought with the customer.

683
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:04,673
Please check the work history.

684
00:48:04,756 --> 00:48:05,757
Sir.

685
00:48:06,675 --> 00:48:09,428
I've never once hit anyone in my life.

686
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,847
I've never even
gotten into an argument before.

687
00:48:12,806 --> 00:48:14,224
The victim already stated that

688
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:16,935
you're the assaulter.

689
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:19,104
He said he can't remember anything
because he was drunk.

690
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:22,149
He's mistaking me with another driver.

691
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:23,984
Then get your indictment suspended.

692
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:31,533
Because of this incident,
I got fired from the taxi company.

693
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:33,368
I can't even do any physical labor...

694
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:35,787
because I'm always busy coming to court.

695
00:48:36,204 --> 00:48:37,789
I barely make a proper living right now.

696
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:39,541
So please...

697
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:43,295
save me and my family.

698
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:47,591
Sir.

699
00:48:48,634 --> 00:48:49,885
Sir!

700
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:51,928
Sir!

701
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:56,850
I wasn't wrong.

702
00:49:02,648 --> 00:49:03,857
SEONGBUK-DONG ASSAULT INCIDENT

703
00:49:15,827 --> 00:49:18,705
Dad, I got on the bad side of...

704
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:23,210
my boyfriend's parents.

705
00:49:26,713 --> 00:49:29,341
My gosh, what should I do?

706
00:49:41,436 --> 00:49:44,356
First, let's do the laundry.

707
00:49:54,366 --> 00:49:56,243
Bong-hui, please take this.

708
00:50:07,003 --> 00:50:08,130
Mr. Noh?

709
00:50:08,213 --> 00:50:09,214
Yes?

710
00:50:11,425 --> 00:50:12,759
Are you going somewhere?

711
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:14,177
What's that?

712
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:15,721
It's my laundry.

713
00:50:16,596 --> 00:50:19,224
I feel uncomfortable to dry it here,

714
00:50:19,307 --> 00:50:21,184
so I'm going to go to a laundromat.

715
00:50:33,029 --> 00:50:34,239
I'll be...

716
00:50:37,743 --> 00:50:38,744
Let's go.

717
00:50:49,629 --> 00:50:51,965
Don't worry too much about...

718
00:50:55,135 --> 00:50:56,595
my mom and Mr. Byeon.

719
00:50:58,263 --> 00:51:00,015
How can I not worry?

720
00:51:03,059 --> 00:51:04,603
They'll both give in.

721
00:51:06,188 --> 00:51:07,189
I also...

722
00:51:07,939 --> 00:51:10,567
never lose to neither of them.
That's the problem.

723
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:13,320
Yes, you're right.

724
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:19,659
Let's go meet your dad next time.

725
00:51:28,835 --> 00:51:29,836
But...

726
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:32,130
when are you going to give it to me?

727
00:51:35,675 --> 00:51:36,676
What?

728
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:39,054
That thing you've been hesitating
all day to give me.

729
00:51:42,098 --> 00:51:43,099
Jeez.

730
00:51:45,852 --> 00:51:46,853
Here?

731
00:51:47,103 --> 00:51:48,230
Yes. Here.

732
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:03,495
What do you think? Do you like it?

733
00:52:04,371 --> 00:52:05,372
It's pretty.

734
00:52:06,039 --> 00:52:07,290
Would you like to try it on?

735
00:52:23,181 --> 00:52:24,182
It's pretty.

736
00:52:24,724 --> 00:52:26,142
-Is it pretty?
-Yes.

737
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:35,151
Thank you.

738
00:53:23,199 --> 00:53:25,160
It was definitely you, Jung Hyeon-su.

739
00:53:28,955 --> 00:53:30,206
I think it still hurts.

740
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:35,045
To be honest,

741
00:53:35,128 --> 00:53:37,422
I think it'd be better
if you never wake up.

742
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:06,201
Yes.

743
00:54:07,535 --> 00:54:10,330
It's the final trial soon. I'll tell you
as soon as I get the results.

744
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:12,582
Yes.

745
00:54:12,958 --> 00:54:13,959
Okay.

746
00:54:15,126 --> 00:54:18,213
Ji-hae, I'm drunk,
but I can still see the sun.

747
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:21,800
I can't believe you're drunk
in the middle of the day.

748
00:54:22,384 --> 00:54:24,135
Yes, okay. Bye.

749
00:54:28,974 --> 00:54:29,975
Ji-hae.

750
00:54:30,225 --> 00:54:31,309
I need to go to the restroom.

751
00:54:32,602 --> 00:54:34,187
Go ahead. It's over there.

752
00:54:34,521 --> 00:54:35,814
You're going to wait for me, right?

753
00:54:35,981 --> 00:54:37,107
Let's go for another round.

754
00:54:39,192 --> 00:54:41,194
Another round? No way.

755
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:45,407
They say you can't recognize your parents
once you get drunk during daylight.

756
00:54:45,490 --> 00:54:48,284
I can't believe I'm spending
my precious weekend like this.

757
00:54:52,664 --> 00:54:53,665
Are you okay?

758
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:57,711
Yes. Thank you, Mr. Ji.

759
00:54:59,045 --> 00:55:00,422
You must've had some drinks.

760
00:55:01,548 --> 00:55:03,258
Yes. A little.

761
00:55:03,758 --> 00:55:05,093
You shouldn't have drunk too much.

762
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:07,804
-Sorry?
-It's bad for your health.

763
00:55:08,013 --> 00:55:11,141
Around 50 percent of Koreans
can't decompose acetaldehyde.

764
00:55:11,224 --> 00:55:13,643
That means their body
is incapable of breaking down alcohol.

765
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:16,271
Oh, I see.

766
00:55:17,856 --> 00:55:20,025
I guess I should've minded
my own business. I'm sorry.

767
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:22,360
Well, okay.

768
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:23,653
By the way,

769
00:55:24,279 --> 00:55:25,488
may I have your number?

770
00:55:26,364 --> 00:55:27,282
Sorry?

771
00:55:27,824 --> 00:55:29,492
Actually, never mind.

772
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:32,328
This is my business card.

773
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:34,998
Please call me if anything happens.

774
00:55:36,374 --> 00:55:37,917
Okay, I will.

775
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:39,002
Bye, then.

776
00:55:52,307 --> 00:55:53,558
I feel better now.

777
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:55,435
-Let's drink.
-Let's go.

778
00:56:03,068 --> 00:56:04,486
-Ji-hae.
-What was that?

779
00:56:05,487 --> 00:56:06,488
Ji-hae.

780
00:56:06,654 --> 00:56:07,989
Come on. Let's go.

781
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:26,841
Good night.

782
00:56:33,389 --> 00:56:34,349
Good night.

783
00:59:57,969 --> 01:00:00,013
