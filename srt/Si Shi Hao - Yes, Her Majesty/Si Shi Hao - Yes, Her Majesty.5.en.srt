1
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:25,740
=Yes, Her Majesty=

2
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:28,740
=Episode 5=

3
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,200
Tell me.

4
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,800
You faked this gorgeous maid

5
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,160
to stop me from going to court.

6
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,560
What's your intention?

7
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,000
I have no bad intention.

8
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:41,480
Your Majesty, I'm just worried that

9
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,920
you'd expose your identity

10
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,200
if you go to court like this.

11
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,320
What do you mean?

12
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,120
Actually, Your Majesty

13
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,640
is fake,

14
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,760
just like the maid.

15
00:00:59,120 --> 00:00:59,740
I'm fake?

16
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:00,040
Get up.

17
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:02,640
Hurry.

18
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,980
- A year ago, the usurper,
- You...

19
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:07,180
(Usurper Cheng Nian)
Cheng Nian, who had the military power

20
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,360
(Late Emperor and Empress)
came to the palace and rebelled.

21
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,320
He's killed the late Emperor
and Empress mercilessly.

22
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,520
Usurper!

23
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,040
Give it to me!

24
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,640
(Crown Prince)
Cheng Nian was chasing after

25
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,760
the Crown Prince, Yue Lizheng,
who was running away from the palace.

26
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,520
Yue Lizheng was shot by arrows
and died on the cliff.

27
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,440
(General Li Xiao)
In that critical moment,

28
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,680
General Li Xiao came

29
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,760
and killed Cheng Nian.

30
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,800
General Li, guard the nation.

31
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,560
Yue Lizheng is the only child
of the late Emperor.

32
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,200
(General Li Xiao)
As soon as the news of him

33
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,200
being killed spreads out,

34
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,680
the foreign kings that
are after the throne

35
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,120
will surely rebel.

36
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,400
So, in order to stabilise the nation,

37
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,920
General Li asked you, the Princess,

38
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,800
to replace the Crown Prince.

39
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:07,420
(Princess)

40
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,240
Of course.

41
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,360
To hide Your Majesty's identity
as a woman,

42
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,920
we always let you go to court
behind the veil.

43
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,320
We'll let the eunuch to pass your word.

44
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,400
We tell others that

45
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,160
Your Majesty is weak after you got shot.

46
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,400
You're having short of breath
and your face was injured.

47
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,440
You can't face the ministers.

48
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,560
(Ministers)
Your Majesty said, get up.

49
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,440
And I

50
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,440
am General Li's nephew.

51
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,440
I replaced General Li's daughter,
Li Shihao,

52
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,840
and married into the palace.

53
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:48,520
Actually, I'm here to protect
and assist Your Majesty.

54
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,760
Let's go.

55
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,400
You're saying that

56
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,760
none of them knows

57
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,040
that the Emperor is a woman
in the past one year?

58
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:00,880
Yes.

59
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,920
Only the ones serving you
from close range know.

60
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:07,040
After all, no woman is allowed
to lead a nation from ancient time.

61
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,480
Ever since I woke up
after I was drowned,

62
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,600
I've forgotten a lot of things.

63
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,360
I thought that being a woman

64
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,880
in this nation

65
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,280
can also become ambitious

66
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,280
and even become the Emperor.

67
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,600
But, I didn't expect that

68
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,160
I'm just a fake

69
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,320
Crown Prince replacing someone else
to the throne.

70
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,080
No matter you're a man or a woman,

71
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,600
I know

72
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,160
Your Majesty is my only Lord.

73
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,160
No matter when,

74
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,040
I'll be by Your Majesty's side.

75
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,080
I trust Your Majesty and
I'm loyal to Your Majesty.

76
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,680
Time can prove that.

77
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,360
I'm so moved.

78
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,480
I have yet to even the score with you.

79
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,560
Who are you to humiliate me?

80
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,920
You said that my beauty

81
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,320
is nothing compared to the maid.

82
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,120
I was being flexible.

83
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,800
Just wait and see.

84
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:44,800
Lantern?

85
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,680
I'll let him know how great I am.

86
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,240
Hit his head.

87
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,160
My jinxed mouth

88
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,800
is not working on him.

89
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:07,200
His Majesty is in the court!

90
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,400
Greetings, Your Majesty.

91
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,600
Everyone, rise.

92
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,400
I heard that Your Majesty
has just recovered from the fall

93
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,040
and your body is not well.

94
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,720
We're all very worried about you.

95
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,960
No worries. Everything is well.

96
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,240
Your Majesty,
after you fell into the water,

97
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,080
we feel that things are unpredictable.

98
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,000
Your Majesty has no son.

99
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,680
It worries us a lot.

100
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,680
Your Majesty, please think about

101
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,440
having a child to pass on the legacy.

102
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,840
Why does it sound different
from what I thought?

103
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,560
They're asking me to give birth.

104
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,920
Sir Liu is right.

105
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,960
The Empress has entered the palace
for a year

106
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,280
and no children was born.

107
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,200
I hope that Your Majesty
will put the nation

108
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,200
and the royal offspring first.

109
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,600
Please give birth as soon as possible.

110
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,480
You said it so easily.

111
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,200
I'm giving birth, not him.

112
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:13,960
We hope Your Majesty will
give birth as soon as possible.

113
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,520
All of you...

114
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,280
Well...

115
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,480
Well...

116
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:27,240
His Majesty knows that you're concerned.

117
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,160
Everyone,

118
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,280
His Majesty has just recovered.

119
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,000
(General Li Xiao)
Giving birth is not what we can rush.

120
00:06:35,273 --> 00:06:37,593
(This should be General Li Xiao.)

121
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,000
Yes.

122
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,280
We should stop asking.

123
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,680
When we come to court
in five days,

124
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,440
we'll remind Your Majesty again.

125
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,760
His Majesty said

126
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,320
that from now on,

127
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,840
the court will become daily.

128
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,840
Your Majesty is diligent at
managing the nation.

129
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,440
We're all thrilled!

130
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,840
Your Majesty is wise!

131
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,240
Your Highness.

132
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,360
Did something fun happen
in the court this morning?

133
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,080
No.

134
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,560
It's just that...

135
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,560
It's just that the ministers

136
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,240
were asking Her Majesty
to think about the royal offspring

137
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,360
and quickly give birth to a son.

138
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,280
These old men

139
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,520
are finally doing something right.
