=Episode 8=

3
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,480
Do you know about

4
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:35,080
the matters between men and women?

5
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,080
Your Majesty, do you mean

6
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,920
the romance between men and women?

7
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:51,460
I mean, the thing after
the romance between men and women.

8
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,360
After that?

9
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,080
Your Majesty wants His Highness
to serve you in bed?

10
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:07,360
I think the Empress is virtuous, kind,
well-mannered and with upright conduct.

11
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,960
It's time for me to take the ministers'
opinion into consideration

12
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,480
to give birth to royal offspring.

13
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,580
Yes, Your Majesty is right.

14
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,200
It's just that...

15
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,240
Your Majesty is nervous
because of lack of experience.

16
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,280
Ridiculous.

17
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,160
I'm the Lord of a nation.

18
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,260
Why would I be nervous?

19
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,920
I'm just worried about the Empress.

20
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,920
I might need to guide him.

21
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,760
Your Majesty, this is simple.

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,120
What's your opinion?

23
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,720
How? Did you bring the thing?

24
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:00,400
Yes.

25
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,160
But...

26
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:03,800
There's a situation?

27
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,600
I've only found the limited edition.

28
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,960
It's 30% more expensive
than the agreed price,

29
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:08,840
20 taels.

30
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:09,960
Forget it.

31
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,060
20 taels it is.

32
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:11,920
Here.

33
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:17,380
(The Good Concubine)

34
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:19,840
What's this?

35
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:20,960
What's wrong?

36
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,120
This is the book you want.

37
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,680
All the men in the city
like to read this.

38
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,680
It's hard to even get a copy.

39
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,760
You're so stupid.

40
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,480
I want the one

41
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,160
between men and women.

42
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:37,760
It's...

43
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,160
It's...

44
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,480
It's...

45
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,560
You're not married.

46
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,880
How can you be so frivolous?

47
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:51,600
It's not me.

48
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,300
Her Majesty wants it.

49
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,200
Forget it.

50
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,040
I'll ask someone else.

51
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:56,760
Wait.

52
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,240
Return it to me once you've read it.

53
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,440
I didn't expect you
to read this kind of book.

54
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,840
I'm so disappointed in you.

55
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,560
Didn't you ask for the book?

(Bailing Great Yan)

57
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,320
Bailing.

58
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,000
Your Highness, there's good news.

59
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,680
No matter it's good news or bad news,

60
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,880
I was already frightened by you.

61
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,240
I heard that Her Majesty is preparing
to get you to serve her.

62
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:44,840
What?

63
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:54,880
This...

64
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,160
This is too hard.

65
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,320
Your Majesty, are you looking for me?

66
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,720
Your Majesty, you're holding
the memorial upside down.

67
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,120
Well, I'm busy with
the official affairs lately.

68
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,520
I haven't seen the Empress for a while.

69
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,240
I wonder what he's doing now.

70
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,380
His Highness knows that
Your Majesty is summoning him.

71
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,520
He's been exercising lately.

72
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,560
Let's go!

73
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,280
He said he wants Your Majesty
to remember it forever.

it takes a lot of stamina.)

(I can't lose to the Empress.)

79
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,280
I wonder what he's been practising.

80
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,720
Can you teach me?

81
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,680
It's my pleasure.

an exercise that Her Majesty can do?

A bit easier and more lively.

This is easy.

Okay.

- Your Majesty.
- You're back.

90
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:47,880
Your hands have to be straight.

Don't be lazy.

Her Majesty said she's become stronger.

100

She wants you to train her now.

101
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,040
I can't.

102
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,440
If this goes on,

103
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,500
