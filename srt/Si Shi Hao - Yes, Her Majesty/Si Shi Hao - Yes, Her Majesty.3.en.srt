1
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:25,740
=Yes, Her Majesty=

2
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:28,740
=Episode 3=

3
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,520
Yue Lizheng, give me your life!

4
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,440
It's not Lan Ruo.

5
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,120
He's taking poison.

6
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:49,560
Stop him.

7
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,100
Okay.

8
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,440
He's dead.

9
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,000
Your hand is injured.

10
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,320
I...

11
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,720
It hurts!

12
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:13,960
What's wrong?

13
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,640
Stop wrapping him with the bandage.

14
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,840
Tell me what's happening to him?

15
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,080
Your Majesty fell into
the river the other day.

16
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,200
His Highness exhausted himself
to save you.

17
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,520
He's drunk too much water

18
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,680
and this is the sequelae.

19
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,760
He fainted because
he's lost too much blood.

20
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,400
He'll be fine after resting for a while.

21
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,240
Okay, go back now.

22
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,040
Yes.

23
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,800
(So he has really jumped into
the water and saved me.)

24
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,720
(Could I have misunderstood him?)

25
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,680
Empress, your wound is deep.

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,360
Don't touch water in the next few days.

27
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:10,600
Take a good rest.

28
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,040
I'll listen to Your Majesty.

29
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,040
You're recovering fast.

30
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,640
Your Majesty helped me with the bandage.

31
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,080
It's like drinking the magical medicine.

32
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,240
I've never heard of that

33
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:27,080
you're skilled in martial arts.

34
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,640
If I were that great,

35
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,360
I wouldn't have been injured.

36
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,640
How was the assassin defeated?

37
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,760
Maybe he has hematophobia.

38
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,160
An assassin with hematophobia?

39
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,200
Doesn't he have work ethic?

40
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:44,840
I got it.

41
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,600
He must have been shocked
by my true love.

42
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,560
Maybe the assassin didn't expect that

43
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,360
in the verge of life and death,

44
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,920
someone would love Your Majesty

45
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,400
more than his own life.

46
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,760
His sincerity

47
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,440
has been witnessed by the stars.

48
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:05,800
Empress,

49
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,480
I can sense your sincerity.

50
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,720
My sincerity

51
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,840
didn't get Your Majesty's love

52
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,320
back in return.

53
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,680
Don't do that.

54
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,840
Okay, I promise you

55
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,080
that I'll not marry any concubine now.

56
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,480
I don't believe that.

57
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,160
You...

58
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,840
Your Majesty will only comfort me.

59
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,200
Tell me

60
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,600
what I should do that you'll believe me?

61
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,960
I want Your Majesty to kiss me.

62
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,960
Empress, rest and recover first.

63
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,920
Once I've found out who the assassin is,

64
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,560
I'll give you an explanation.

65
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,120
Your Majesty!

66
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,320
I'll waiting for Your Majesty!

67
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,120
Guard.

68
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:26,920
Yes.

69
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,240
Bring the assassin's body here.

70
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,720
I want to check on it.

71
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:32,600
Yes.

72
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,600
Stop crying.

73
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,920
I've jinxed it and
brought the real assassin here.

74
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,160
If something had happened
to Your Majesty...

75
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,640
Shut up!

76
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,360
Your mouth

77
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,720
is really horrible.

78
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:58,860
(Silence order)

79
00:04:59,220 --> 00:04:59,940
(Silence order)

80
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:00,920
(Silence order)
I'll give you a silence order.

81
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,040
Don't talk if you don't need to.

82
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,000
I've promised the Empress.

83
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,360
I have to delay taking Kong Gu
as my concubine.

84
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,800
What a shame.

85
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,280
What sound is that?

86
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,040
You can talk now.

87
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,800
Kong Gu is waiting at the door
to ask for Your Majesty's punishment.

88
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,560
Let him come in.

89
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:32,760
Come in.

90
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,120
I didn't protect Your Majesty well!

91
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,080
Your Majesty, please punish me!

92
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,880
(You'll be punished by Her Majesty.)

93
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,560
(Who told you to throw me on the floor?)

94
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,240
(It's a waste if I cannot take him)

95
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,400
(as my concubine.)

96
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,280
What happened today was an accident.

97
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,880
Kong Gu, get up.

98
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,000
I'm guilty.

99
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,460
Your Majesty, please punish me.

100
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:34,080
I'll recall your Commander position.

101
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,640
You and Lan Ruo

102
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,880
will serve me by my side.

103
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,600
Thank you, Your Majesty.

104
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,080
Get up.

105
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,240
Your Majesty.

106
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,720
This is the evidence
we found on the assassin.

107
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,760
Based on the assassin's
accessory and dagger,

108
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,420
he should be the subordinate

109
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,060
of the traitorous minister, Cheng Nian,

110
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,560
in the rebellion a year ago.

111
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,240
Your Highness,

112
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,200
combined with the clue from yesterday,

113
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,860
he was really Cheng Nian's subordinate.

114
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,840
But his nails are filled with green mud

115
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,720
and centiana scabra clippings.

116
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,400
What's the problem, Your Highness?

117
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,720
Green mud and centiana scabra

118
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,880
are from the vassal state, Bailing.

119
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,280
I'm afraid the assassin
comes from the vassal state.

120
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,980
If the assassin was ordered
by someone else,

121
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:45,860
should we inform Her Majesty?

122
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:46,540
No need.

123
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:47,780
Don't get her worried.

124
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:49,380
Ask your secret guards

125
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,140
to find out Bailing's movement.

126
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,000
I'm afraid it's not as simple
as it seems.

127
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:53,960
Yes.

128
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,920
Were you punished
because of your negligence?

129
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,160
Yes.

130
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,720
Don't worry.

131
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:07,980
I'll look for Your Majesty and talk...

132
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:10,180
Your Majesty has recalled
my Commander position.

133
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,540
I'm now her bodyguard.

134
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:14,880
What?

135
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,240
Bodyguard?

136
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,440
Your Majesty.

137
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:26,840
It's you.

138
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,120
What's the matter?

139
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,640
His Highness' wound has a relapse.

140
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:30,760
He's been having a high fever.

141
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,500
A relapse?

142
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,280
She shows others forgiveness and care.

143
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,420
I think she'll get anxious
when she finds out

144
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:39,000
that I have a relapse.

145
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,680
I want to see

146
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,400
if she still cares about me.

147
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,120
She's here.

148
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,440
Your Majesty.

149
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,840
Why is it you?

150
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,400
Didn't I ask you to get
Her Majesty here?

151
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,480
Why are you here?

152
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:07,840
Where's Her Majesty?

153
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,800
Her Majesty will be here soon.

154
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,840
Why are you here then?

155
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,880
Her Majesty will be here soon.

156
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,600
So, I'm here to inform Your Highness.

157
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,200
Why can't I untie this?

158
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:22,760
Come here.

159
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:24,920
Hurry.

160
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,800
I want to take it off.

161
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:30,880
Why?

162
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,760
Don't bother.

163
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,200
- Her Majesty will be...
- Take it off. Don't you understand?

164
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,120
Her Majesty will be here soon.

165
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:36,920
Like this.

166
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:37,800
Come on.

167
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,600
Since you're fine, I'll go back now.

168
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,160
- Your Majesty!
- Your Highness!

169
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,280
