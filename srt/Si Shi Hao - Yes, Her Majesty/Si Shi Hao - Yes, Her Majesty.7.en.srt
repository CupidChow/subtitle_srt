1
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:25,740
=Yes, Her Majesty=

2
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:28,700
=Episode 7=

3
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,480
Jiangnan is having great harvest
this year.

4
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:36,160
I wonder who will become
the Censor of Jiangnan

5
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,960
which I think is a rewarding job.

6
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:39,840
General Li,

7
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,680
His Majesty summoned you alone
a few days back.

8
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,560
Do you have any news?

9
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,360
How can I simply guess
His Majesty's thoughts?

10
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,400
His Majesty likes to eat
Jiangnan snacks.

11
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,820
So I sent some snacks to His Majesty.

12
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:55,780
(Local magistrate, Zhou Xun)

13
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,240
As soon as General Li spreads the news,

14
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,600
everyone is sending
Jiangnan snacks over.

15
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,640
A lot of them are having bad intentions.

16
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,760
Lan Ruo, let's eat.

17
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:13,680
What's wrong?

18
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,120
Your Majesty,

19
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,600
I'm having a stomach ache.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,160
I've been vomiting and having
diarrhea for the whole morning.

21
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,760
Your Majesty, let me do it.

22
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:22,960
You?

23
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,160
Can you differentiate
the taste of Jinling rice?

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,480
Isn't it the taste
of honeysuckle flower?

25
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,120
I'm good at gardening for a reason.

26
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,880
Can you taste all of them?

27
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,840
Sharing burdens with Your Majesty

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,560
is my pleasure.

29
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,680
Okay, I'm counting on you.

30
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:40,720
Let's go.

31
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:42,840
Let's go.

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,440
(Why didn't I realise that)

33
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,960
(he looks good when he's quiet?)

34
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,160
Stop crying.

35
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,320
Take this.

36
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,160
This is Jinling rice cake.

37
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,640
I brought it here from my hometown.

38
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,360
It's made of Jinling rice.

39
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,080
Try it.

40
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,560
Is it tasty?

41
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,000
Yes.

42
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,200
Your Majesty!

43
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,400
I've found Jinling rice!

44
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:25,960
Which one?

45
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,000
This one.

46
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,160
Kong Gu, check who sent this.

47
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:29,760
Yes.

48
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:30,600
Go quickly.

49
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,560
Your Majesty,

50
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,960
do you think god is hinting at us?

51
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,400
About what?

52
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Not to eat and drink too much?

53
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,520
Hinting at

54
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,120
having a prince.

55
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,640
Empress, you're getting
more and more ridiculous.

56
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,240
Your Majesty,

57
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,120
the local magistrate, Zhou Xun,
took bribery and made exception.

58
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,160
The rice supplier found the chance

59
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,200
and used the cheap fragrant rice

60
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,320
to swap with the tribute Jinling rice.

61
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,040
He's too daring.

62
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,600
Does law mean nothing to him?

63
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,880
General Li, send my order.

64
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,960
Punish Zhou Xun and
the officers involved heavily.

65
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,160
Also, punish all the officers who

66
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,120
sent in all the Jiangnan snacks.

67
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,920
Your Majesty, please think twice.

68
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,720
General Li, do you have any opinion?

69
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:46,320
Zhou Xun is the nephew of
King of Bailing, Zhou Jie.

70
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,640
Bailing is located at the border.

71
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,000
King Zhou Jie has powerful influence.

72
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,080
The battle at the border has just ended.

73
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,080
If we punish Zhou Xun now,

74
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,400
I'm afraid that Zhou Jie
will be offended.

75
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:03,200
Your Majesty, please minimise the harm.

76
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,320
General Li, go back first.

77
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,480
Let me think about it.

78
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,040
Your Majesty, please think twice.

79
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,480
What's this?

80
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,640
Gastrointestinal medicine for you.

81
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,200
This way.

82
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,760
Your Majesty, are you troubled?

83
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,800
- I...
- Let me guess.

84
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,080
It's hard to achieve multiple goals

85
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,040
or satisfy all the conflicting demands.

86
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,000
If we punish Zhou Xun,

87
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,240
King Zhou Jie will be offended.

88
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,480
If we go easy on Zhou Xun
who is breaking the rules,

89
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,020
no one would practise righteousness.

90
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,720
There will be more and more
of them in the imperial court.

91
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,160
If you were in my shoes,

92
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,920
what will you do?

93
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,080
Your Majesty is the king of the nation.

94
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,120
Actually, Your Majesty
already has the answer.

95
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,280
Just follow your heart and do
whatever you think is right.

96
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,800
You don't think that
I should be afraid of Zhou Jie?

97
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,960
If Zhou Jie hates Your Majesty

98
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,440
because of Zhou Xun,

99
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,760
it's better for us

100
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,480
to know about it earlier and
we can do something in advance.

101
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,640
Your Majesty

102
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,120
has to know that you can do well,

103
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,560
but you'll offend someone
along the journey.

104
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,280
But

105
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,720
no matter what decision
Your Majesty will make,

106
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,640
I'll stand on Your Majesty's side.

107
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,000
Your Majesty.

108
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,240
The moon tonight is so appealing.

109
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,080
Do you think

110
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,440
god is hinting at us?

111
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:47,960
I...

112
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,640
I have something on.

113
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:55,680
Your Majesty.

114
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:57,600
Let's go.

115
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:02,780
(Imperial study)

116
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,480
Send my order.

117
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,480
Punish Zhou Xun and the rest heavily.

118
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,340
From now on, everyone in the palace
has to live a frugal and simple life.

119
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,020
Cancel the tribute rice from Jinling.

120
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,560
I want to go through this
with the people.

121
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,440
Your Majesty is wise.

122
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:29,400
Your...

123
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,080
How did the investigation go?

124
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,040
The secret guards have reported that

125
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,880
the assassin was sent by King Zhou Jie.

126
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,400
Besides,

127
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,200
Bailing has been expanding their army

128
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,640
in the name of fostering their border.

129
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,480
First, they sent an assassin.

130
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,560
Now, they're expanding their army.

131
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,840
Could it be that King Zhou Jie
is trying to rebel?

132
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,000
The coming days are
not going to be peaceful.

133
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,680
Kong Gu, expand the secret guards.

134
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,960
We must protect Her Majesty.

135
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:07,840
Yes.

136
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,920
No matter what decision
Your Majesty will make,

137
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,880
I'll stand on Your Majesty's side.

138
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:51,960
Lan Ruo.

139
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:54,960
Lan Ruo.

140
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,800
Do you know about

141
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,360
the matters between men and women?
