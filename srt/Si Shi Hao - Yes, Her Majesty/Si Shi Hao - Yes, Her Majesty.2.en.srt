00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:25,740
=Yes, Her Majesty=

00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:28,740
=Episode 2=

3
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:35,040
Lan Ruo,

4
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,600
why does the Empress adore me?

5
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,240
Kong Gu,

6
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,840
why doesn't Her Majesty adore me?

7
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,480
There's only His Highness in the harem.

8
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,440
Of course His Highness
wants to serve Your Majesty well.

9
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,720
There's only Your Highness in the harem.

10
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,120
Why would Her Majesty not adore you?

11
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,080
He's having the exclusive possession.

12
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,080
He's trying to rebel.

13
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,320
She rejected me from serving her
at night.

14
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,280
I'm afraid she's sick of me.

15
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,720
The best way to keep him under control

16
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,100
is to balance up his authority.

17
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:00,760
If this goes on,

18
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,200
my position in the harem
is getting more unstable.

19
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,080
Send my order.

20
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,280
I want to marry a concubine.

21
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,520
Your Highness, help!

22
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,960
Her Majesty wants to marry a concubine!

23
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,120
This is a good day.

24
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:22,800
Thanks to god that Her Majesty
is marrying a concubine.

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,080
The first man

26
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,920
is Prince Xiao of Dongyun's son,
Xiao Baichuan.

27
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,480
Okay, I'll choose...

28
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,120
You can't choose me.

29
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,200
Why?

30
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,040
Your Majesty,

31
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,000
I may look smart,

32
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,040
but

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,920
I'm actually very sick.

34
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,220
I only looked good on the outside.

35
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,160
I'm afraid I can't give birth
for Your Majesty.

36
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,360
No way.

37
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,940
The nation is more important.

38
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,160
How can we get a sick concubine

39
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,520
to have the royal offspring?

40
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,680
That's right.

41
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,760
Next.

42
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,640
Prince of Lian Commandery, Yun Ni.

43
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,440
Such a handsome face.

44
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,600
It's fake.

45
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,360
Your Majesty,

46
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,040
my master is a great man.

47
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,560
I've learned from him
how to change my face.

48
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,160
I've changed my faces
more than 100 times

49
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,640
to get this face.

50
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,640
The face is good,

51
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,760
but it can't be touched.

52
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:04,600
It will break as soon as we touch it.

53
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,760
So you can only be viewed,
but not to be played with.

54
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,800
Next.

55
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,680
The Lord of Dawei City, Zhuang Youlang.

56
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,720
Wait.

57
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,000
Zhuang Youlang,

58
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,880
let me ask you first.

59
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,960
Are you sick?

60
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,280
Of course not.

61
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,440
Can your face be touched?

62
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,600
That's great.

63
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,240
Just tell us what's your problem.

64
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,240
Your Majesty,

65
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,680
I was raised up by my mother.

66
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,880
I only have one request
if I'm going to the palace.

67
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,880
Can I get my mother to stay with me?

68
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,840
An Xin, what's going on?

69
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,720
Who are these people that you've found?

70
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,500
They're not even as good as my guard.

71
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,840
Which guard?

72
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,760
Greetings, Your Majesty.

73
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:22,640
Your Majesty.

74
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,120
Your Majesty.

75
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,160
Your Majesty.

76
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,120
Wait.

77
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,400
What's your name?

78
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,080
Your Majesty,

79
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,280
my name is Kong Gu.

80
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,040
Kong Gu is such a beauty.

81
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,680
Your skin is as fair as jade.

82
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,080
Your Majesty, not him!

83
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,800
He's my bodyguard!

84
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,720
Since you're skillful,

85
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,200
come to my side and be the Commander.

86
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,440
I'm counting on you

87
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,680
for my safety.

88
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,440
No.

89
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,440
No?

90
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,160
No.

91
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,760
No.

92
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,360
No problem, Your Majesty.

93
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,000
This is the reward for you
to expose your weaknesses.

94
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,120
This is to cover your mouth.

95
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,040
If anyone says anything about yesterday,

96
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,840
be careful with your head.

97
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:31,800
Yes.

98
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,000
Go now.

99
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,320
Your Highness.

100
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:45,920
Commander.

101
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,240
Your Highness, it's not official yet.

102
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,120
You...

103
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:51,960
It's my fault.

104
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,480
I've caused you to be in trouble.

105
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,600
Your Highness, don't blame yourself.

106
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,600
It's my honour to

107
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,000
protect Her Majesty.

108
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,160
Her Majesty is not easy to serve.

109
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,160
Her personality is terrible.

110
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,160
Why not you consider about it?

111
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,120
Your Highness, don't worry.

112
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,840
Since I've taken the salary,

113
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,320
I'll do my best.

114
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,680
Actually, there's no need to rush.

115
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,560
Rest...

116
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,080
Your Highness, don't worry.

117
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,200
The responsibility is huge.
I'll move in there right away.

118
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:21,840
I...

119
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:26,760
Your Majesty,

120
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,960
are you really interested in Kong Gu?

121
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,640
It's not that I'm interested in him.

122
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,600
Keeping him near me has its advantage.

123
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,320
Since you're suspecting that
His Highness will rebel,

124
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,960
what if he's His Highness' spy?

125
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,360
Spy?

126
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,960
Just let him try.

127
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,680
I also want to see
if His Highness is trying to rebel.

128
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,200
What's Her Majesty thinking?

129
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,560
She asked me to pretend
as an assassin to test Kong Gu.

130
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,160
What if I jinx it and
a real assassin comes here?

131
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,720
Let go of me!

132
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,320
Be quiet!

133
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,920
Help! Assassin!

134
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,800
(Such a handsome face.)

135
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,040
(No wonder Her Majesty can't resist it.)

136
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,000
I should get back to work.

137
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,960
How could you do that?

138
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,960
How come they're not here yet?

139
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:37,960
They're coming.

140
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,560
Yue Lizheng, give me your life!

141
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:45,880
It's not Lan Ruo.
