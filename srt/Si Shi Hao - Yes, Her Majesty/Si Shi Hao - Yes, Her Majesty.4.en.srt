00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:25,740
=Yes, Her Majesty=

00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:28,740
=Episode 4=

3
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,080
Lan Ruo, give me a glass of water.

4
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,560
Your Highness.

5
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,000
Your Highness.

6
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,120
It's time to work.

7
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,600
(Her Majesty went to court
every five days before the accident.)

8
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,120
(Memorial)
(Now, she's not even going anymore.)

9
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,160
(Put those that are asking her
to the court on the right.)

10
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,760
(Put those that are not asking her
to the court on the left.)

11
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,920
Your Highness, you need to change
the medicine for your hand.

12
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,520
No.

13
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,840
Her Majesty wrapped this for me.

14
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,960
Your Highness, you should wash up.

15
00:01:59,160 --> 00:01:59,920
No.

16
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,480
I almost kissed Her...

17
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,360
You won't understand.

18
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,560
Your Highness,

19
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,680
you need to hurry.

20
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,680
I need to send the memorials back
to Her Majesty

21
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,680
before she wakes up.

22
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,440
I know.

23
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,520
All the old ministers

24
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,160
are asking Her Majesty to go to court.

25
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,480
Her Majesty was drowned

26
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,640
and she's yet to recover.

27
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,520
Why the rush?

28
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,240
I have yet to have a baby prince.

29
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,200
I'm more anxious than them.

30
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,400
Why are you taking so long to come?

31
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,320
Her Majesty is about to wake up.

32
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,000
If something happens to the memorials,

33
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,200
you'll be beheaded.

34
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:46,620
(Imperial study)

35
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,040
(Your Majesty, take care.)

36
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,600
(Your Majesty has
yet to come to court.)

37
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,880
(All of us are not happy.)

38
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,400
(The citizens might be affected.)

39
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,640
(Your Majesty has taken a long rest)

40
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,120
(and the ministers didn't
get to see you.)

41
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,000
(We wonder if Your Majesty
is doing well or not.)

42
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,760
(Your Majesty, please show up
so that we won't be worried.)

43
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,280
(Your Majesty only came to court
once in every five days.)

44
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,000
(Now, Your Majesty is
not coming anymore.)

45
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,320
(Your Majesty,
please put the nation first.)

46
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,920
(Your Majesty, please come to court.)

47
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,440
(Please come to court.)

48
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,520
Ridiculous!

49
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,560
(Something has really
happened to the memorials.)

50
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,640
(I've jinxed it again.)

51
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,200
What's going on?

52
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,080
Don't mix it.

53
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,320
This is for Her Majesty.

54
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,520
Oh no.

55
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,440
I only went to court
once in every five days?

56
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,840
Was I that lazy before?

57
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,200
No.

58
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,520
Tell me the truth.

59
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:54,840
Yes.

60
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,160
I wake up early every day
in the imperial study

61
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,000
and hardly sleep at night.

62
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,360
I'm never lazy in handling
the official matters.

63
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,560
Although I don't remember the past,

64
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,520
I'm still the same person.

65
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,120
How can I be so different?

66
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,160
I'm asking you.

67
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,480
Your Majesty has really changed
after you fell into the river.

68
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,200
We are not sure why, either.

69
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:25,280
Could it be a blessing in disguise

70
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,720
after I fell into the river

71
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,040
and I've changed

72
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,440
to become a great Emperor
that's good at managing a nation?

73
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,000
An Xin, send my order.

74
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,760
I want to go to court this morning.

75
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,980
Yes, Your Majesty.

76
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:01,720
Your Highness!

77
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,960
Can't you greet me first?

78
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:07,920
This is urgent.

79
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,840
Her Majesty wants to go to court
this morning.

80
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,400
Didn't I keep all the memorials that are

81
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,600
asking her to go to court?

82
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,640
Your Highness, please punish me.

83
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,000
I'm incapable.

84
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,160
I've mistakenly given the memorials
asking Her Majesty to go to court

85
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,080
to Her Majesty.

86
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,280
What?

87
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,640
I've asked Lan Ruo to buy time for us.

88
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,440
What should we do, Your Highness?

89
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,160
As soon as Her Majesty goes to court,

90
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,560
everything will be exposed.

91
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,960
We must not let her go.

92
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:41,920
Your Majesty,

93
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,120
I'm afraid it will rain soon.

94
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,360
I'll let you know what it means
that I'm not afraid of any obstacles.

95
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,480
If the rain can't stop you,

96
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,160
what if the road is blocked?

97
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,840
Your Majesty, the Yushi Bridge
for us to go to court

98
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,680
was washed away by the storm.

99
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,280
What?

100
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,400
Your Majesty, if we take another route,

101
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,720
it will take too long.

102
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,360
Also, the court would've been dismissed
when we get there.

103
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,720
Why not...

104
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,920
Dig the mountain to open the path
and take a boat on the river.

105
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,460
This must be the test from god

106
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:48,560
to see if I'm determined to go to court.

107
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,280
Oh no.

108
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,440
It seems like we will be there soon.

109
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:52,920
Your Majesty, this is bad!

110
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,040
Why are you here?

111
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,360
His Highness is eloping

112
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,480
with a palace maid!

113
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,640
What?

114
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,720
The Empress is getting more
and more ridiculous.

115
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,240
Don't bother!

116
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,460
Why is Her Majesty not coming yet?

117
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,040
Your Highness, Kong Gu told us that

118
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,400
Her Majesty said you eloping
with a palace maid is hilarious

119
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,320
and went straight to the court.

120
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,200
Come down quickly.

121
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,800
She doesn't care that I'm eloping
with a palace maid.

122
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,280
She really doesn't care about me.

123
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,360
Empress!

124
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:42,840
Your Majesty!

125
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,120
Don't be reckless!

126
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,200
Your Majesty, hold me tight!

127
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,480
Your Majesty!

128
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:26,880
Your Majesty,

129
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,240
drink a cup of mind-clearing tea.

130
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:35,320
Your Majesty, didn't you go
to court this morning?

131
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,160
Why did you come here suddenly?

132
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,320
How dare you ask that?

133
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,600
(Two hours ago)
Kong Gu,

134
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,200
(Two hours ago)
the Empress has been served

135
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,520
(Two hours ago)
by male servants.

136
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,400
Where did the maid come from?

137
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,120
She was just sent here by
the Imperial Household Department.

138
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,560
She's there to serve Your Majesty

139
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,600
when you go to His Highness' place.

140
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,040
She hasn't yet to serve me

141
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,560
and she's serving the Empress already.

142
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:53,760
How does she look?

143
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:54,920
Who?

144
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,160
Are you silly?

145
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,480
The maid that's serving the Empress.

146
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:58,920
It's hard to say it.

147
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,800
What's so hard to say?

148
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,680
Compared to me...

149
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,920
How does she look
compared to our beautiful Lan Ruo?

150
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,040
Kong Gu, use your limited imagination.

151
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,000
Just say something to make
Her Majesty nervous,

152
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:16,920
do you understand?

153
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,040
There's no comparison.

154
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,280
The maid is gorgeous

155
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,120
and many would fall for her.

156
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,120
There's such a beautiful maid
in the Empress' harem?

157
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,040
Just wait and see!

158
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,040
What are you doing?

159
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,000
What are you doing?

160
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,800
I... Let go!

161
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:32,920
Let go!

162
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:34,640
Tell me.

163
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,240
You faked this gorgeous maid

164
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,040
to stop me from going to court.

165
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,760
What's your intention?

166
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,440
