00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,180
(Imperial study)

4
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,200
Li Xiao is here to greet Your Majesty.

5
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,680
General Li, please rise.

6
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,160
(Why do I feel like
I'm close to General Li?)

7
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,400
Your Majesty.

8
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:49,640
General Li.

9
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,200
The Empress has told me about

10
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,680
how I'm replacing the Crown Prince.

11
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,180
General Li,
you're the pillar of the nation.

12
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,080
I hereby thank you for that.

13
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,840
Your Majesty, don't say that.

14
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,880
Being loyal and serving the nation
is my duty.

15
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,480
The imperial court is not stable yet.

16
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,440
I'll be more diligent and careful.

17
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:05,680
I hope you'll assist me.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,360
Your Majesty has that realisation,

19
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,560
it's a blessing to the nation.

20
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,160
I'll do my best.

21
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,080
Your Majesty, your real birthday
is coming soon,

22
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,040
but we can't celebrate openly.

23
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,960
My wife has made some Jiangnan snacks
for your birthday celebration.

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,040
That's so kind of you.

25
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,920
I've almost forgotten
about Her Majesty's real birthday.

26
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:40,880
Your Highness.

27
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,360
This is the most trendy lipstick.

28
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,360
It's good, moisturising,
and won't make our lips dry.

29
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,280
It can fulfill our everyday needs.

30
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:53,360
Your Highness,
this is foreign sea pearl.

31
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,320
Every man can only customise
once in his lifetime.

32
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,880
What about this?

33
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,760
I bought one and got one free.

34
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:04,640
Your Highness.

35
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,280
Look at this.

36
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,720
This is the scarce
morelia viridis leather bag.

37
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,120
The skin is rare.

38
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,520
It's exclusive in Great Yan.

39
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,520
Put it down.

40
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,280
How can your taste be so bad?

41
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,000
This is my birthday gift to Her Majesty.

42
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,720
How can it be these lousy goods?

43
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,640
It's such an important event.

44
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,880
Can't you all be more serious?

45
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,360
Whether I can...

46
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:35,760
Whether I can give birth to a prince
with Her Majesty or not

47
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,240
depends on

48
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,320
this birthday gift.

49
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,520
Your Highness, what gift do you think

50
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,480
is not lousy?

51
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,480
Empress...

52
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,360
Close your eyes.

53
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,320
Listen.

54
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,880
The bug's chirping is loud.

55
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:25,540
♪A flower blooms before the rain falls♪

56
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:28,860
♪A moon could be full or in half♪

00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:48,340
♪You couldn't reach the entire dream♪

00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:07,580
♪Stopping at the other side going
through the mountains and rivers♪

♪Stopping at this moment where
you are the whole world♪

67
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,880

Autumn moon.

69
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,040
Summer bugs.

70
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,860
Winter snow.

71
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,280
Your Majesty, the natural scenery
is beautiful in all four seasons.

72
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,680
How many people in the world
are truly at leisure?

73
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,560
This is the first birthday gift

74
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,840
I've prepared for Your Majesty.

75
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:29,880
Great four seasons.

76
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,360
Great four seasons?

77
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,160
You've once told me that

78
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,400
you're always trapped in the palace.

79
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,600
You haven't seen any four seasons.

80
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:39,700
So,

81
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,200
I've brought four seasons to see you.

82
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:47,420
♪Stopping at the beginning of the story
and at the innocence♪

83
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:51,420
♪Stopping at the end of the story for
our temples turning white with snow♪

84
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:54,700
♪Stopping in the pages of history
described in just a few lines♪

85
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,640
Happy birthday,

86
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:56,880
Your Majesty.

87
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:06,220
♪Flowers and leaves♪

88
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,160
Come with me.

89
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,480
Your Majesty,

90
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,080
this is the second gift
I've prepared for your birthday.

91
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:23,840
Do you like it?

92
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,180
What is this?

93
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,760
This is a cake.

94
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,440
It's made of Jinling rice
and Nantian flour.

95
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,000
It means breaking of a new day.

96
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I used up a whole day to make this.

97
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,000
It's tough.

98
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,840
What about this fat doll?

99
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,280
It's the sugar dough doll that I made.

100
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,200
Your Majesty, don't you think
she looks like...

101
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:00,440
May Great Yan be prosperous!

102
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,920
Empress, this is auspicious.

103
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:03,720
Here.

104
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,040
Look here. The rice, the shell

105
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,280
and the Doll of Prosperity.

106
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,640
Doll of Prosperity?

107
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,640
Look at the doll.

108
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,240
She's short and fat. That's a blessing.

109
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,680
Isn't she the God of Prosperity?

110
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,040
Yes.

111
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,200
She's the God of Prosperity.

112
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,360
If Her Majesty found out that
this is her,

113
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,600
she might vomit blood.

114
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,480
My jinxed mouth was not working on him.

115
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,120
Let me try again.

116
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,080
Blow the flour onto his face.

117
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,200
Three, two, one, blow.

118
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,200
Are you okay?

119
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:52,960
I'm okay!

120
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,280
His Highness and I were making cakes.

121
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,720
I made one too.

122
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,160
See if it looks like you.

123
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,880
It does look like me.

124
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,000
It's quite tasty too.

125
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,040
Do you want to try?

126
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,480
You can eat it all.

127
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,360
Wait.

128
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,480
How does it taste?

129
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:51,840
Is it nice?

130
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,620
It's not too bad.

131
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:08,960
Wait.

132
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,700
What rice did you use to make this?

133
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,600
Jinling rice.

134
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,520
There's something wrong with the rice.

135
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,120
Your Majesty, this is not Jinling rice.

136
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,880
This is only the normal fragrant rice.

137
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,080
Are you sure?

138
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,400
The tribute item for the imperial palace
is Jinling rice.

139
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,080
Jinling rice and fragrant rice's texture
is similar.

140
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,360
But Jinling rice

141
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,320
has the special fragrance
of honeysuckle flower in Jinling.

142
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,280
I grew up in Jinling.

143
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,320
I came into the palace at 16.

144
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,440
I'll never recognise it wrongly.

145
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,440
Yes.

146
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,360
It's the smell of honeysuckle flower.

147
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,040
This is weird.

148
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,920
Have I been to Jinling?

149
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,840
Why is the taste so familiar...

150
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,960
Your Majesty's favourite was
Jinling rice before you were drowned.

151
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,040
Right, Lan Ruo?

152
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,080
Yes.

153
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,280
Your Majesty used to eat
Jinling rice every day.

154
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,160
Your Majesty, the most urgent matter

155
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,040
is to find out the truth of
Jinling rice being swapped.

156
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,120
How could someone use
fragrant rice to replace Jinling rice?

157
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,000
It's too daring.

158
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,560
Kong Gu, you'll be
in charge of this matter.

159
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,640
You must investigate thoroughly.

160
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,200
Yes.

161
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,600
Your Majesty, swapping the tribute rice
is a serious matter.

162
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,680
Many people will be involved.

163
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,120
I think we should act quietly.

164
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,920
Empress, do you have any idea?

165
00:10:25,216 --> 00:10:28,896
