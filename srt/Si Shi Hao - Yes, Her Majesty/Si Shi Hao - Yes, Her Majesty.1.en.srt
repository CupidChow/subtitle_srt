00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,120
Your Majesty,
there are a lot of people here.

4
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:32,120
We should go back.

5
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:33,240
Your Majesty,

6
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,400
the palace gate will be closed
in an hour.

7
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,240
All right.

Ruo Lan.

9
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,520
Your Majesty, my name is Lan Ruo.

10
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,240
Lan Ruo.

11
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,280
Did I fall into this river?

12
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,040
Yes, Your Majesty.

13
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,480
Xin An.

14
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,640
Your Majesty, my name is An Xin.

15
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,160
An Xin.

16
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,880
How long have I been fainted
after I fell into the river?

17
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,240
Your Majesty, around three days.

18
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,560
Look at that gentleman!

19
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,200
Yes.

20
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:11,880
Who is that?

21
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,860
He looks so handsome.

22
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,340
Your Majesty,
he's your beloved in this life.

23
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,560
There's nobody that can compare...

24
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,240
Your Empress.

25
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,120
Li Shihao.

26
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:38,320
My Empress, Li Shihao?

27
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,260
Your Majesty!

28
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:50,140
=Yes, Her Majesty=

(Imperial Study)

30
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,200
Your Majesty, you should take a rest.

31
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,080
You have yet to recover from
falling into the river.

32
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,160
You've been reading memorials
for four hours.

33
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,940
(I fell into the river three days ago)

34
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,720
(and I was unconscious.)

35
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,480
(I woke up yesterday and
I've lost all my memory.)

36
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:20,160
(They said I'm the Emperor
of Great Yan, Yue Lizheng.)

37
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,560
(I've accepted the setting)

38
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,760
(after a while.)

39
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,240
(After all, being the Emperor)

40
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,740
(is like my specialty.)

41
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,800
(It's a shame that my Empress,
Li Shihao,)

42
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,240
(is a beauty when he doesn't speak.)

43
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,380
(But when he speaks...)

44
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:36,000
Your Majesty!

45
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,320
(He doesn't look smart.)

46
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,920
(He's really not my favourite.)

47
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,480
Your Majesty, it's time to
choose your companion tonight.

48
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,720
I didn't know that I have
so many husbands in the harem.

(Slash, Stroke, Zag, Horizontal.)

50

(Zag, Horizontal.)

53
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,060
Was I uneducated before fainted?

54
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,360
(Slash, Stroke, Zag, Horizontal.)
I only used a radical

55
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,600
(Slash, Stroke, Zag, Horizontal.)
to name them?

56
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,680
I'll meet Mr. Slash tonight.

57
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,020
Yes, Your Majesty.

58
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,120
Mr. Slash.

59
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,280
Mr. Slash is indeed majestic

60
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,240
and well-mannered.

61
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,960
Thank you for your compliment,
Your Majesty.

62
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,560
Empress?

63
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,240
How come it's you?

64
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,440
I've made a mistake.

65
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:47,800
Do it again.

66
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,160
Mr. Stroke.

67
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,040
Mr. Stroke is a gentleman.

68
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,960
It's indeed true.

69
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,320
Your Majesty.

70
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,680
How come it's you again?

71
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,280
I don't believe this.

72
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,760
Am I in a maze?

73
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,000
Do it again.

74
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,200
Mr. Zag.

75
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,240
Mr. Zag.

76
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,440
Are you the Empress?

77
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,680
Your Majesty,

78
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,640
how did you know it's me?

79
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,040
There's only you alone in my harem?

80
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,360
Yes.

81
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,800
Your Majesty and I are getting along.

82
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,680
You'll never take in another concubine.

83
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,280
What about the tablet An Xin

84
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,360
was holding?

85
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:44,880
Your Majesty,

86
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,400
read all the radicals together.

87
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,480
Slash, stroke, zag, horizontal.

88
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,540
(Empress)
Empress?

89
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,280
That's right.

90
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,120
You...

91
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,360
Empress,

92
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,840
it's getting late.

93
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You should go back and take a rest.

94
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,000
I...

95
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,600
Your Majesty, do you dislike me?

96
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,640
Empress, you've been taking care of me
and you must be tired.

97
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,240
I'm doing this for your own good.

98
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,080
Your Majesty, you're kind to me.

99
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,440
I'm leaving now.

100
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,340
What's wrong?

101
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,280
My head hurts.

102
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,640
The imperial physician said

103
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,800
this is the sequelae

104
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,560
of saving Your Majesty in the river.

105
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,040
You saved me?

106
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,880
I was resting in the room that day.

107
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,560
When I heard that Your Majesty
fell into the river,

108
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,120
I rushed there like a loosen horse

109
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,400
and jumped into the river
like a green dragon.

110
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,920
You can see the waves.

111
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,800
I saved Your Majesty.

112
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,720
My head hurts.

113
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,120
Feel it.

114
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,720
Am I having a fever?

115
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,420
Empress.

116
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,240
It's in the middle of summer.

117
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,560
You're wearing too many clothes.

118
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,200
Your Majesty, please help me
to take them off.

119
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,160
(I think I smelled this)

120
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,800
(before I fell into the river,)

121
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,200
(but he said)

122
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,120
(he only arrived after
I fell into the river.)

123
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,440
The night is beautiful.

124
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,440
Let me serve Your Majesty in bed.

125
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,360
Your Majesty!

126
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:48,960
Your Majesty!

127
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,960
Your Highness,
you finished it so quickly?

128
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,860
Is there a special scent on my body?

129
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:04,800
Smell of the fragrance...

130
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:05,920
And?

131
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,200
Sweat.

132
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,120
And?

133
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,200
A man's smell.

134
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:16,880
Forget it.

135
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,360
You're getting more and more ridiculous.

136
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,360
Tell me.

137
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,320
Why did the Empress save me
the other day?

138
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,440
As soon Your Majesty
fell into the river,

139
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,600
His Highness rushed there
as quick as he could.

140
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,160
He rushed there like a loosen horse

141
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,000
and jumped into the lake
like a green dragon.

142
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,680
You can see the waves everywhere
and he saved Your Majesty.

143
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,440
(It's the same as
what the Empress said.)

144
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,640
Tell me.

145
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,840
Why did the Empress save me?

146
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,360
His Highness

147
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,440
rushed there like a loosen horse.

148
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,040
Enough.

149
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:47,480
You tell me.

150
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,240
Are you all bought off by the Empress?

151
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,440
If I ever speak lies, let the thunder...

152
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,640
How dare you quibble?

153
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:06,920
Your Majesty, please forgive me.

154
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,080
The thunder strikes me
not because I'm telling lies.

155
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:09,760
It's because

156
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,800
I'm born with a jinxed mouth.

157
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:12,840
If Your Majesty doesn't believe me,

158
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,080
let the thunder...

159
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,040
Something bad happened!

160
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,600
Your Majesty's bedroom has been struck
and is on fire now!

161
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:21,480
Your Majesty...

162
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,360
Shut up!

163
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:24,900
Hurry up!

164
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,920
Hurry up!

165
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,560
- Hurry up!
- Water!

166
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,280
Hurry up!

167
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:28,760
This way!

168
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,640
Water! Take the water here!

169
