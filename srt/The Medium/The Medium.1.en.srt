1
00:00:56,541 --> 00:00:59,083
The locals here have believed in spirits
for ages.

2
00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:02,333
Maybe even before there was any religion.

3
00:01:09,666 --> 00:01:13,875
But the meaning of spirits for Isan people

4
00:01:13,958 --> 00:01:16,458
might not be the same as for most.

5
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:37,125
We believe everything
that goes beyond nature

6
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,791
is all called spirits,

7
00:01:41,041 --> 00:01:44,000
not just the souls of dead people.

8
00:01:52,958 --> 00:01:56,083
We believe spirits are
in every single thing.

9
00:02:01,583 --> 00:02:02,875
In houses,

10
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:05,875
in forests, in mountains…

11
00:02:10,416 --> 00:02:11,625
in trees,

12
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:15,333
in rice fields.

13
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:18,750
Every area has spirits. All of them.

14
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:26,666
IN 2018,
A DOCUMENTARY TEAM TRAVELED

15
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:30,333
ALL OVER THAILAND
TO STUDY THE LIVES OF SHAMANS.

16
00:02:31,875 --> 00:02:35,333
AFTER INTERVIEWING MANY SHAMANS,

17
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:39,291
THE TEAM DECIDED TO STUDY
THE LIFE OF NIM,

18
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:43,625
THE SHAMAN OF "GODDESS BA YAN."

19
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:50,958
For Isan people, spirits have many types,

20
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:54,875
such as Phee Fah, Phee Tan,

21
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:58,875
Phee Sua, Phee Ban, Phee Muang…

22
00:02:58,958 --> 00:03:00,041
They're all spirits.

23
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:02,625
NIM, "BA YAN" SHAMAN

24
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:05,291
There are good spirits that protect us

25
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:07,125
and evil spirits

26
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:12,250
that haunt us and make us sick.

27
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:14,625
And the spirit within you? Who is that?

28
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:18,125
Let me say it in a central dialect.

29
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:20,875
They call it "possessing."

30
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:23,583
In Isan, they call it "Ma Tiam."

31
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,916
I'm the shaman for Goddess Ba Yan.

32
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,625
Ba Yan is an ancestral spirit.

33
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:15,250
She's a good spirit

34
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:18,958
who has protected the villages
for a long time.

35
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:25,166
Actually, no one knows who she is
or where she's from,

36
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:28,291
but they've paid respect to her
for many generations.

37
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,375
"SHAMAN BLOODLINE"

38
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:44,291
A DOCUMENTARY ABOUT THE SHAMAN
INHERITANCE IN A FAMILY.

39
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:50,250
My family has been Ba Yan's shaman
for many generations.

40
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:54,041
Ever since I was born,
I saw my grandmother as her medium.

41
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:58,625
Ba Yan only chooses women
to be her medium.

42
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:01,625
Lots of locals would come to see us.

43
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:06,000
Every year we do a ceremony.
A very big one.

44
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:09,083
The locals will ask

45
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:12,083
how the village will fare
for the coming year.

46
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:14,708
After my grandmother died,

47
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:18,875
the next person to inherit Ba Yan
was my aunt.

48
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:26,875
After my aunt, the next shaman was
supposed to be Noi, my elder sister…

49
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:28,458
NOI - NIM

50
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:30,833
…but Noi declined the inheritance.

51
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:32,875
Ba Yan then chose

52
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:36,458
me instead.

53
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:45,083
Don't shamans have to shake their bodies
or change their voices?

54
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:49,333
You might have watched too much TV.
It doesn't have to be like that.

55
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:54,458
As you've seen,
people come see me every day.

56
00:05:54,541 --> 00:05:57,000
Some come to heal their sickness.

57
00:05:57,083 --> 00:06:00,416
Some ask for blessings or wishes.

58
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:05,375
Some repay their wishes with offerings
of a jar of liquor and a chicken.

59
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:07,625
Tell me what happened.

60
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:10,541
My husband found this cobra
and made liquor out of it.

61
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:12,541
I told him not to drink it,
but he didn't listen.

62
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:14,958
His arms and legs went numb.
He doesn't have any strength.

63
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,375
Where did you get it from?

64
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:19,750
I got it from the cemetery.

65
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:23,291
This is the cause of your misery,
paying for your bad karma,

66
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:26,750
because you're drinking the soul
that resided in this animal.

67
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:38,416
Can you treat every illness?

68
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,666
If someone has cancer
and they come to see me,

69
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:43,208
they will die for sure.

70
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:50,666
I can only treat illnesses
that happen from the unseen,

71
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,583
such as black magic,

72
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:55,958
or if a spirit has harmed you,
I can cure it.

73
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:59,166
But if it's a normal illness,
I advise you go see a doctor.

74
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:06,833
I never thought of being a shaman before.
Actually, I didn't want to be one.

75
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:10,000
There was a period when I was always sick.

76
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:12,541
No matter what, I couldn't get better.

77
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,916
It was so painful,

78
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,041
to the point that I wanted to run away
to get away from it all.

79
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:23,541
Why does it have to be me?
But I didn't succeed.

80
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:26,541
So I agreed to let her take me.
Actually, it is great.

81
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:29,666
Now I get to pray every day
and do ceremonies.

82
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:34,375
And people come to see me,
asking for help when they have troubles.

83
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:38,458
Now I consider it to be very good.

84
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,041
I'm at ease.

85
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:44,708
I can't even remember why I first
didn't accept her, why I was mad at her.

86
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:57,666
THE SEAMSTRESS

87
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:29,833
We're going to Wiroj's funeral. Who is he?

88
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:31,583
Wiroj is…

89
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:36,916
the husband of my elder sister, Noi.

90
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,500
He found out last year that he had cancer.

91
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:41,875
I'm sorry for your loss.

92
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:45,833
I don't know why
all the men in the Yasantia family…

93
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:47,250
WIROJ YASANTIA

94
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:49,166
…die under bad circumstances.

95
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:53,666
Wiroj's grandfather was stoned to death
by laborers.

96
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:57,750
Wiroj's dad,
when his factory went belly-up,

97
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:00,458
burned the factory for insurance money.

98
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:04,250
When he was caught,
he poisoned himself to death.

99
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:06,875
As for Mac, Wiroj's eldest son,

100
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,833
he died in a motorcycle accident
several years ago.

101
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:35,708
How have you been?

102
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:39,541
Haven't seen you for so long.
You've forgotten your family?

103
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:42,125
If no one died, we'd never see each other.

104
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:44,958
-Is this tray ready?
-Yeah, you can take it inside.

105
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:50,208
-You always forget your relatives.
-Can you stop nagging?

106
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,791
He's the pastor
from the church Noi goes to.

107
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:00,125
Thank you for coming.

108
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:04,916
Mink, please get a chair for the pastor.

109
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,750
Mink.

110
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:16,083
How are you?

111
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:19,583
Your mom told me you were
the first one to find his body.

112
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:20,791
I'm okay.

113
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:29,250
I have three siblings in my family.

114
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:30,875
There's Manit, the eldest.

115
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:34,208
If you smoke a lot,
you can't tell one thing from another.

116
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:37,250
Water? Some water?

117
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:40,041
Noi is the middle child,
and I'm the youngest.

118
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:41,375
See,

119
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:44,708
Wiroj, Noi's husband, just died.

120
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:50,208
Before this, Mac, Noi's son, passed away.

121
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:55,125
Now Noi is left with Mink,
her only daughter.

122
00:11:56,083 --> 00:12:01,458
Actually,
Noi and Wiroj married a bit late.

123
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:03,000
Once they married,

124
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:08,041
Noi took over the dog-meat shop
from her mother-in-law,

125
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:10,375
Wiroj's mother.

126
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:12,916
I don't know why she did that.

127
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,333
The government doesn't allow it,
but Noi still secretly does it.

128
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:16,625
MANIT - PANG

129
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:17,916
NIM'S BROTHER - MANIT'S WIFE

130
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,750
My sisters don't get along very well.

131
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:23,500
They have had some kind of disagreement
ever since who knows when.

132
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:29,916
I've tried to talk to them
to get them to reconcile, to make up.

133
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:33,375
Make sure they're yours.

134
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:36,958
I won't take someone else's.

135
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:38,708
Thank you for coming.

136
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:42,083
Auntie.

137
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:46,708
Mom wants you to get stuff from my house.

138
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:49,541
She wrote it all down
and where everything is.

139
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:11,333
Hello, Auntie Nim.

140
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:21,875
Here.

141
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:24,000
-You already closed the door, right?
-Yes.

142
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:26,416
-Lucky won't go outside, right?
-It won't.

143
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:32,041
You brought the wrong cloth.
I wanted the thicker one.

144
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:34,125
Why don't you go get it yourself then?

145
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:42,458
Uncle, what the hell are you saying?

146
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:45,500
No one said anything, Mink.

147
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:49,125
-What the fuck did you say? Say it!
-I didn't say anything.

148
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:52,666
Just mind your own business.
Are you talking shit about me?

149
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,791
Who? No one's said anything.

150
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,875
-He cursed at me.
-I haven't done anything…

151
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:59,375
-You called me a whore!
-Mink! Stop it!

152
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:01,166
Mink, don't!

153
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,208
I didn't call you that!

154
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:07,833
-Get him out of here, Mom!
-Mink, let's go.

155
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:11,458
-Mink, go. Leave first.
-I'm not leaving. He cursed at me!

156
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,708
No one's said anything at all.

157
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:18,458
-Damn it! Get out of here!
-Mink, calm down.

158
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:21,875
-Mom, let go of me!
-Calm down, Mink.

159
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,166
He cursed at me.

160
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:27,166
He didn't.

161
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:31,250
Does Mink usually drink a lot?

162
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:35,583
I know she drinks,
but I didn't know it was this much.

163
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:38,041
This is the first time
Mink's caused a scene.

164
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:40,125
-I see.
-Go ahead.

165
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:41,875
See you around.

166
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:45,500
Drive safely.

167
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:12,750
Mink.

168
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Mink.

169
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:20,750
Mink.

170
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:52,791
Mink.

171
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:17,875
Who died?

172
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:21,125
The blind old woman
whose house is behind the temple.

173
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,041
How did she die?

174
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,125
I don't know.

175
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:51,208
Mink.

176
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:53,750
Mink!

177
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:30,125
WIROJ YASANTIA

178
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:12,375
Nim, what are you doing here?

179
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,541
What are you doing in Mink's room?

180
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:21,458
Why are you going through her things?

181
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:25,208
I asked you a question.
Why don't you answer?

182
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:27,166
Why aren't you saying anything? Gosh!

183
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:29,333
What are you looking for? Tell me…

184
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:36,375
Here.

185
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:38,125
See?

186
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:42,708
Do you know what this is?

187
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:43,791
What?

188
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:47,083
What are you doing? Both of you get out.

189
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:49,375
-Mink, hold on.
-Mom, leave.

190
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:52,583
Mink, you've started to have nightmares
and hear strange things, right?

191
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:54,166
No! Nothing! Mom, get out.

192
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:56,000
-Mink…
-Get out.

193
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:57,416
Get out!

194
00:18:58,041 --> 00:19:00,000
Must you film everything? Seriously?

195
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:09,333
You know what the turmeric is for, right?

196
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:16,750
You must tell me if Mink shows
any strange symptoms.

197
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:22,166
Noi!

198
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:25,541
She's my child.
I can take care of her. You should leave.

199
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:31,875
What is it that Mink hangs in her closet?

200
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:33,458
It's a turmeric called Pa Ta Ba.

201
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:37,041
We believe it can protect us from spirits

202
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:39,333
and other evil things.

203
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:43,666
Why the hell did they come into
other people's rooms?

204
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:46,416
They went through my stuff too. Damn it!

205
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,916
It's so freaking lame.

206
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:49,875
Right?

207
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:54,916
Why did you put the Pa Ta Ba in your room?

208
00:19:58,416 --> 00:20:02,000
What they did, it's so childish.
They're supposed to be the adults here.

209
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:08,291
At the funeral the other day,
why were you staring at that blind lady?

210
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,333
What blind lady?

211
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:22,125
Do you see someone standing over there?

212
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:36,375
Yes. I see someone there.

213
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:38,458
Why?

214
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:51,916
THE TEAM WENT OVER THE FOOTAGE

215
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,166
AND FOUND MINK SHOWING
SOME STRANGE BEHAVIOR.

216
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:04,458
What do Mink's recent symptoms mean?

217
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:10,750
From what I've gathered,
they can be several things.

218
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:14,375
Does that mean Ba Yan will move into Mink?

219
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,750
I don't know.

220
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:29,333
THE TEAM HAD AN IDEA.
IF A SHAMAN INHERITANCE IS REAL,

221
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:35,166
THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO RECORD
THE MANIFESTATION.

222
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:40,291
THEY DECIDED TO FILM MINK
AND HER FAMILY TOO.

223
00:21:48,958 --> 00:21:51,541
Hey.
Are you going to film me all the time?

224
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:55,791
Most of the time.
Just make yourself comfortable.

225
00:21:58,291 --> 00:22:00,125
Tell me about your job.

226
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:03,250
Sure. I work at the recruitment center.

227
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:04,333
MINK
NIM'S NIECE

228
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:07,041
RECRUITMENT CENTER

229
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:10,166
All day I assign work for people to do.

230
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:16,791
Number 6.

231
00:22:20,208 --> 00:22:21,500
Hello.

232
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:26,958
I wake up at 5:00 a.m. I wake up early.

233
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:29,625
Eat and get into work
around 7:00, 8:00 a.m.

234
00:22:32,458 --> 00:22:35,250
In the afternoon there aren't many people.
So I have some free time.

235
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:39,041
I'm not that tired from my work.

236
00:22:40,458 --> 00:22:42,333
And do you like your job?

237
00:22:42,416 --> 00:22:45,833
Yeah. I think I'm happy
helping others find jobs.

238
00:22:47,208 --> 00:22:49,416
-You're telling the truth, right?
-Of course!

239
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,708
I sound like a beauty queen, huh?

240
00:22:51,791 --> 00:22:55,333
How do you feel towards people
who are shamans, like your aunt?

241
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:57,000
Shamans?

242
00:22:57,708 --> 00:23:00,916
To be honest, I think it's nonsense.
I don't think it's real.

243
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,708
Out of the blue, they do odd dance moves.
Acting like Hanuman. It's so weird.

244
00:23:05,791 --> 00:23:09,666
I've also heard people say that
there's a Doraemon shaman.

245
00:23:11,666 --> 00:23:12,916
Hilarious!

246
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,708
What's a Doraemon shaman?

247
00:23:14,791 --> 00:23:16,333
Well, it's a Doraemon shaman.

248
00:23:16,416 --> 00:23:18,875
I guess when they're taken over,
they sing the theme song.

249
00:23:18,958 --> 00:23:20,833
I can speak in tongues too.

250
00:23:20,916 --> 00:23:22,083
I'll show you.

251
00:23:26,541 --> 00:23:27,541
See?

252
00:23:27,625 --> 00:23:30,916
Anyone can do it. Have you seen
those clips? This is how they speak.

253
00:23:40,083 --> 00:23:41,083
HEAVENLY MEAT

254
00:23:41,166 --> 00:23:42,666
-What would you like?
-100 baht of meat.

255
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:43,750
Thank you.

256
00:23:43,833 --> 00:23:46,250
I don't know why
they won't let us sell it.

257
00:23:46,333 --> 00:23:48,541
People around here have eaten
dog meat for ages.

258
00:23:48,625 --> 00:23:52,458
Oh, but you sell dog meat
and also have a pet dog.

259
00:23:52,541 --> 00:23:55,458
-Doesn't it feel strange?
-I don't find it strange at all.

260
00:23:55,541 --> 00:23:57,083
NOI - MINK'S MOTHER

261
00:23:57,166 --> 00:24:00,000
Those who raise goldfish and carp,
don't they also eat fish?

262
00:24:00,833 --> 00:24:02,875
May I ask about Ba Yan?

263
00:24:02,958 --> 00:24:08,125
When Ba Yan tried to enter into you,
can you remember how you felt at the time?

264
00:24:08,833 --> 00:24:11,833
Back then, I remember I was in my 20s.

265
00:24:12,458 --> 00:24:15,583
I started to have weird symptoms.

266
00:24:15,666 --> 00:24:18,000
Locals call it "shaman fever."

267
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:20,625
At the time, I had severe headaches,

268
00:24:21,625 --> 00:24:25,250
and my period came every day straight
for five full months.

269
00:24:25,333 --> 00:24:27,083
My aunt was already a shaman.

270
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:30,625
She advised me to do
an acceptance ceremony to be a shaman.

271
00:24:31,208 --> 00:24:34,000
But I didn't want to.
I didn't like the idea of being a shaman.

272
00:24:34,625 --> 00:24:37,583
So I converted to Christianity.

273
00:24:38,291 --> 00:24:41,750
I prayed to God
that I would not become a shaman.

274
00:24:41,833 --> 00:24:44,750
For if you forgive others
their trespasses,

275
00:24:44,833 --> 00:24:47,791
your heavenly father
will also forgive you.

276
00:24:47,875 --> 00:24:50,708
But if you do not forgive others
their trespasses,

277
00:24:50,791 --> 00:24:53,791
neither will your father forgive
your trespasses.

278
00:24:53,875 --> 00:24:57,083
But something happened with Nim,
my younger sister.

279
00:24:57,666 --> 00:25:01,083
Nim went to study dressmaking in the city.

280
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:04,958
They said that she fainted and blacked out

281
00:25:05,041 --> 00:25:06,458
without knowing the cause.

282
00:25:07,333 --> 00:25:09,750
We had to go get her
and bring her back home.

283
00:25:10,416 --> 00:25:14,500
After that,
Ba Yan entered into Nim instead.

284
00:25:14,583 --> 00:25:16,666
No one knows what happened.

285
00:25:17,791 --> 00:25:20,583
Thinking about it now, I do feel guilty

286
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:24,708
that Nim took my place as the shaman.

287
00:25:24,791 --> 00:25:26,625
And what if now…

288
00:25:26,708 --> 00:25:29,666
Ba Yan wants to move to Mink.
What will you do?

289
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:33,166
If you're going to ask me stupid
questions, then you can stop asking.

290
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:34,500
And stop filming.

291
00:26:02,083 --> 00:26:05,333
Whoa, Mink. You're beautiful.

292
00:26:05,416 --> 00:26:07,291
Why are you wearing baby shoes?

293
00:26:09,666 --> 00:26:12,208
Girl, on the parade day,
you're gonna be the prettiest.

294
00:26:12,291 --> 00:26:13,541
Is it comfortable?

295
00:26:13,625 --> 00:26:16,541
It's fine. But it's a bit loose.
They'll take it in for me.

296
00:26:16,625 --> 00:26:17,750
Oh, I see.

297
00:26:27,708 --> 00:26:31,500
Lisa, have you noticed Mink
acting strange lately?

298
00:26:31,583 --> 00:26:33,583
Recently,
I guess you could call it strange.

299
00:26:33,666 --> 00:26:34,791
LISA
MINK'S BEST FRIEND

300
00:26:34,875 --> 00:26:38,041
It's like she's faking or something,
like she's not her real self.

301
00:26:38,125 --> 00:26:39,875
Here, just a sec.

302
00:26:40,791 --> 00:26:42,333
Mink, where are you going?

303
00:26:44,125 --> 00:26:46,250
Girl, it's for kids. You can't play.

304
00:26:47,125 --> 00:26:48,958
I want to.

305
00:26:49,041 --> 00:26:51,083
Are you out of your mind? Get out.

306
00:26:53,958 --> 00:26:56,000
Mink. Cray-cray.

307
00:27:03,333 --> 00:27:06,291
Mink! What the hell is wrong with you?

308
00:27:19,708 --> 00:27:20,833
Mink!

309
00:27:26,333 --> 00:27:27,750
What are you doing?

310
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,500
Hey.

311
00:27:42,041 --> 00:27:43,041
Hey.

312
00:27:55,833 --> 00:27:58,166
Can you not film me all the time?

313
00:27:58,916 --> 00:28:00,416
I'm a mess right now.

314
00:28:01,958 --> 00:28:03,041
Stop filming.

315
00:28:24,125 --> 00:28:26,125
RECRUITMENT CENTER

316
00:28:40,416 --> 00:28:42,083
Mink, you bitch.

317
00:28:42,166 --> 00:28:44,000
You ditched me to go with some guy again?

318
00:28:44,083 --> 00:28:46,583
If you get messed up again,
don't come to me for help.

319
00:28:47,833 --> 00:28:48,916
Mink?

320
00:28:59,583 --> 00:29:00,916
I'm here.

321
00:29:10,625 --> 00:29:11,875
Oh, Mink.

322
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,708
Mink. Why are you sleeping here?

323
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:19,125
Wake up. Go wash your face and start work.

324
00:30:40,375 --> 00:30:42,458
Mink? Mink?

325
00:30:42,541 --> 00:30:43,958
What's wrong?

326
00:30:44,458 --> 00:30:45,500
Mink?

327
00:30:48,833 --> 00:30:51,958
Where did you sleep last night?
I called, but you didn't pick up.

328
00:30:52,041 --> 00:30:53,625
It's time you stop drinking.

329
00:30:56,416 --> 00:30:57,416
Mink?

330
00:30:58,666 --> 00:30:59,875
What's with you?

331
00:31:01,166 --> 00:31:03,333
It's just my period.
What's with the nagging?

332
00:31:03,416 --> 00:31:05,500
Wait, talk to me first. For how long?

333
00:31:06,458 --> 00:31:07,458
Mink!

334
00:31:08,083 --> 00:31:11,333
Talk to me.
Has it been long since you've had it?

335
00:31:12,833 --> 00:31:16,250
-Pang, where's Manit?
-He went out to meet friends.

336
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:18,541
-Do you know who?
-No idea.

337
00:31:32,083 --> 00:31:34,750
Manit! What are you doing here?

338
00:31:34,833 --> 00:31:37,375
Don't you give a shit
about your wife and kid?

339
00:31:37,458 --> 00:31:40,375
Get up and come with me.
I need to talk to you about something.

340
00:31:40,458 --> 00:31:41,458
Now!

341
00:31:44,541 --> 00:31:48,875
Right now, Mink's symptoms are
like yours and Nim's back then, right?

342
00:31:49,666 --> 00:31:50,916
That's right.

343
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,583
You must have Nim do
the acceptance ceremony for Mink.

344
00:31:53,666 --> 00:31:55,791
You know I don't want my child
to be a shaman.

345
00:31:56,666 --> 00:32:00,500
But if Ba Yan really wants Mink,
what can you do?

346
00:32:03,958 --> 00:32:06,500
I don't know what I have to do.

347
00:32:06,583 --> 00:32:08,458
Think it over.

348
00:32:46,958 --> 00:32:48,708
What the hell is it with you?

349
00:32:49,583 --> 00:32:51,791
Calm down, sweetie.

350
00:32:52,958 --> 00:32:55,333
-Stop being nosy, hag!
-Hey! Why are you doing that?

351
00:32:55,416 --> 00:32:57,333
-What are you doing?
-Stop the car!

352
00:32:58,333 --> 00:33:00,416
-Get off!
-No!

353
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:05,083
-Stop!
-I said I'm not getting off!

354
00:33:05,166 --> 00:33:07,666
-Have you lost it?
-Damn all of you!

355
00:33:10,208 --> 00:33:13,541
-You! Get lost!
-Come on. Let's go.

356
00:33:13,625 --> 00:33:14,750
Damn you!

357
00:33:17,125 --> 00:33:18,916
Damn all of you.

358
00:33:19,958 --> 00:33:20,958
Shit.

359
00:33:25,458 --> 00:33:26,541
Damn it.

360
00:33:27,208 --> 00:33:30,666
Why the hell did they chase me off?
Assholes.

361
00:33:43,291 --> 00:33:44,708
I hope you all die.

362
00:33:57,708 --> 00:33:59,833
I hope all of you die.

363
00:34:09,791 --> 00:34:11,583
Is this all you got?

364
00:34:11,666 --> 00:34:12,666
Yes.

365
00:34:13,875 --> 00:34:17,541
Has Mink ever acted strange,
like she's someone else?

366
00:34:18,625 --> 00:34:22,541
Well, she sometimes acts like a kid.

367
00:34:23,875 --> 00:34:27,000
Anything else,
aside from acting like a kid?

368
00:34:27,791 --> 00:34:31,000
From our footage,
there isn't anything else.

369
00:34:38,875 --> 00:34:42,250
Have you seen my beaded bracelet?

370
00:34:43,458 --> 00:34:47,041
It might have fallen off here
when I came to get things for Noi.

371
00:34:47,125 --> 00:34:49,916
-What bracelet?
-My brown bracelet.

372
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,958
-The one you always wear, right?
-Yeah.

373
00:34:52,041 --> 00:34:53,333
Where did you go that day?

374
00:34:53,416 --> 00:34:56,833
I came to get the meds here, and I went
up to Noi's room to get the scarf.

375
00:34:56,916 --> 00:35:00,166
It might have fallen off there.
Noi, go up and take a look for Nim.

376
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:01,750
It isn't around here.

377
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:04,708
I really need it.
Could you please look for me?

378
00:35:05,291 --> 00:35:06,916
Look thoroughly.

379
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:16,250
Mink?

380
00:35:17,041 --> 00:35:18,875
-Mink?
-Mink?

381
00:35:22,166 --> 00:35:23,500
Mink.

382
00:35:23,583 --> 00:35:24,583
Mink?

383
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:28,541
Mink, are you okay?

384
00:35:29,958 --> 00:35:33,583
Recently have you heard
someone calling you?

385
00:35:34,458 --> 00:35:36,458
And did you happen to answer them?

386
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:43,250
-There has been, right?
-Nim! What are you talking to her?

387
00:35:43,333 --> 00:35:46,416
They're not talking about anything.
Just small talk between aunt and niece.

388
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,500
-What did you say to her?
-Nothing.

389
00:35:48,583 --> 00:35:51,000
-You told her to come, didn't you?
-What are you talking about?

390
00:35:51,083 --> 00:35:54,833
She came looking for her bracelet. It fell
off the day she came to get your stuff.

391
00:35:54,916 --> 00:35:56,958
-Mink?
-Fine. I'm leaving now.

392
00:35:58,041 --> 00:35:59,125
Mink, what is it?

393
00:36:01,333 --> 00:36:02,833
What did Auntie say?

394
00:36:07,208 --> 00:36:08,833
What did she talk to you about?

395
00:36:12,333 --> 00:36:13,541
What is it?

396
00:36:16,291 --> 00:36:17,375
Mom.

397
00:36:21,291 --> 00:36:22,625
Tell me.

398
00:36:22,708 --> 00:36:25,375
Mom, I don't want to be a shaman.

399
00:36:28,791 --> 00:36:31,708
I won't let you be one.
I won't let it happen.

400
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:36,041
-Don't be afraid.
-You have to help me.

401
00:36:36,125 --> 00:36:39,666
-Don't be afraid.
-Mom, you have to help me.

402
00:36:40,375 --> 00:36:42,875
Why do you think Nim came to see Mink?

403
00:36:43,458 --> 00:36:46,250
She wants Mink to replace her as a shaman.

404
00:36:47,166 --> 00:36:48,666
She doesn't have any children.

405
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:53,333
But no matter what,
I won't let my child be a shaman.

406
00:36:55,541 --> 00:36:59,583
Ms. Kanda Yasantia,
receive your medicine at counter two.

407
00:36:59,666 --> 00:37:01,583
I'll get it for you. Wait here.

408
00:37:01,666 --> 00:37:05,416
I've got headaches.
It feels like my head's gonna explode.

409
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:08,000
Stomachaches. Backaches.

410
00:37:08,083 --> 00:37:10,083
And that part also hurts.

411
00:37:11,791 --> 00:37:13,083
When it hurts,

412
00:37:14,416 --> 00:37:17,166
it feels like it's going to rip apart.

413
00:37:19,375 --> 00:37:21,708
The doctor said he doesn't know
what's wrong either.

414
00:37:21,791 --> 00:37:23,291
He doesn't know the cause.

415
00:37:23,375 --> 00:37:26,458
Have you dreamed
of anything strange lately?

416
00:37:27,666 --> 00:37:31,000
I have the same dream repeatedly
almost every night.

417
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:36,458
In my dreams, I see a huge man.

418
00:37:37,166 --> 00:37:42,375
He's wearing a red loincloth and red vest
with some kind of talisman all over it.

419
00:37:44,833 --> 00:37:46,125
In my dreams,

420
00:37:47,875 --> 00:37:49,583
he's holding a long sword.

421
00:37:50,875 --> 00:37:52,541
He stomps his foot

422
00:37:53,875 --> 00:37:55,958
and licks the blood from the sword.

423
00:37:58,500 --> 00:37:59,541
And…

424
00:38:01,541 --> 00:38:05,250
there's a decapitated head
and blood all over the floor.

425
00:38:09,916 --> 00:38:13,708
It's like the head is trying
to tell me something.

426
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:18,916
And what is the head saying?

427
00:38:21,958 --> 00:38:24,750
I try to listen to what it's saying,

428
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:28,208
but there isn't any sound that comes out.

429
00:39:36,166 --> 00:39:37,166
Mink.

430
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:38,958
Mink?

431
00:39:40,375 --> 00:39:41,375
Mink?

432
00:39:44,541 --> 00:39:46,583
-Are you okay?
-Leave me alone!

433
00:39:47,625 --> 00:39:49,166
Mink, can you get up?

434
00:39:49,833 --> 00:39:51,208
Can you get up?

435
00:39:51,291 --> 00:39:52,333
Come on.

436
00:39:52,416 --> 00:39:54,000
Get out!

437
00:39:54,083 --> 00:39:56,666
I think we should go to the hospital.
Let's go.

438
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:58,583
Leave me alone. Get out!

439
00:40:03,791 --> 00:40:05,583
Kanda, may I have a word with you?

440
00:40:13,708 --> 00:40:15,083
You can't film anymore.

441
00:40:34,291 --> 00:40:35,958
What the fuck are you saying?

442
00:40:37,375 --> 00:40:39,166
How can you fire me? Asshole!

443
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,166
Screw you!

444
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:11,250
Mink?

445
00:41:12,083 --> 00:41:14,833
-Did you take your meds this morning?
-Mink!

446
00:41:14,916 --> 00:41:17,125
-Will you be okay?
-Mink, come change.

447
00:41:20,708 --> 00:41:22,375
I'll be outside.

448
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,041
Done. Wait for us to do your hair.

449
00:42:08,333 --> 00:42:09,333
Mink?

450
00:42:10,041 --> 00:42:11,041
Mink?

451
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,041
Hey!

452
00:42:35,625 --> 00:42:36,875
GOD REMAINS WITH US

453
00:42:36,958 --> 00:42:37,958
Mink!

454
00:42:39,333 --> 00:42:40,500
Mink!

455
00:42:40,583 --> 00:42:43,125
Whoa, she's so gorgeous.

456
00:42:43,208 --> 00:42:45,000
-Mink.
-Mink?

457
00:42:45,083 --> 00:42:46,958
-Mink.
-Mink.

458
00:42:47,458 --> 00:42:48,916
Mink.

459
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,291
Mink.

460
00:42:50,375 --> 00:42:51,750
-Mink.
-Mink.

461
00:42:52,291 --> 00:42:53,583
-Mink.
-Mink.

462
00:42:54,333 --> 00:42:55,875
Why doesn't she look at us?

463
00:42:56,708 --> 00:42:57,708
Mink!

464
00:43:38,416 --> 00:43:40,458
BORDER CROSSING POINT

465
00:43:59,041 --> 00:44:00,791
Where are you going now?

466
00:44:01,833 --> 00:44:03,083
To work.

467
00:44:21,458 --> 00:44:23,375
What are you doing here? Get out!

468
00:44:24,416 --> 00:44:27,083
Security! Get her out of here.

469
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:36,375
The thing is,
stuff in our office went missing.

470
00:44:36,458 --> 00:44:39,041
SUMETH
RECRUITMENT CENTER DIRECTOR

471
00:44:39,125 --> 00:44:41,458
So I took a look at the CCTV
and found this.

472
00:44:41,541 --> 00:44:42,750
As you can see…

473
00:44:43,958 --> 00:44:45,333
Look.

474
00:44:45,416 --> 00:44:46,583
Disgusting.

475
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:49,125
This woman is shameless.

476
00:46:58,291 --> 00:46:59,333
Mink?

477
00:47:04,375 --> 00:47:05,416
Mink?

478
00:47:07,916 --> 00:47:09,375
Are you taking a shower?

479
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Mink?

480
00:47:14,875 --> 00:47:16,125
Mink!

481
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:19,500
-Noi!
-Manit!

482
00:47:19,583 --> 00:47:21,666
-What is it, Noi?
-Oh, God!

483
00:47:21,750 --> 00:47:22,833
Shit!

484
00:47:25,625 --> 00:47:28,000
Go get some towels. Noi, call the doctor!

485
00:47:28,083 --> 00:47:31,375
Hurry, call an ambulance.
Get me some towels.

486
00:47:31,458 --> 00:47:33,875
Shit! Noi! Be careful.

487
00:47:34,666 --> 00:47:37,375
It's the hospital, right?
Send an ambulance right away.

488
00:47:38,125 --> 00:47:39,166
What happened?

489
00:47:39,750 --> 00:47:41,125
Why?

490
00:48:03,791 --> 00:48:04,833
Nim.

491
00:48:07,916 --> 00:48:10,166
Nim. I now surrender.

492
00:48:11,083 --> 00:48:13,333
I'll let Mink do the acceptance ceremony.

493
00:48:14,291 --> 00:48:16,375
Please hold the acceptance ceremony
for Mink.

494
00:48:19,416 --> 00:48:21,583
I don't want to see my child like this.

495
00:48:22,833 --> 00:48:24,500
Mink can't do the acceptance ceremony.

496
00:48:26,541 --> 00:48:27,791
Why not?

497
00:48:30,166 --> 00:48:32,875
Because what's taken hold of Mink
isn't Ba Yan.

498
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:36,541
How come it's not?

499
00:48:36,625 --> 00:48:39,458
Mink's symptoms are like
what you and I had.

500
00:48:41,250 --> 00:48:44,791
If Mink agrees to become a shaman,
her symptoms will disappear too, right?

501
00:48:45,875 --> 00:48:47,750
I can't let Mink do the ceremony.

502
00:48:49,375 --> 00:48:51,291
You have to do it for Mink.

503
00:48:51,375 --> 00:48:52,666
Manit, come with me.

504
00:48:53,666 --> 00:48:55,166
Nim.

505
00:48:55,250 --> 00:48:57,250
I'm gonna go with Nim then.

506
00:48:57,333 --> 00:48:59,208
Nim, you have to do it for her.

507
00:48:59,291 --> 00:49:02,958
She's your niece. Don't you pity her?

508
00:49:12,416 --> 00:49:13,541
Open the door.

509
00:49:15,708 --> 00:49:17,083
Open what door?

510
00:49:17,166 --> 00:49:19,958
-This door.
-What are you going to do?

511
00:49:20,041 --> 00:49:21,250
Hurry, will you?

512
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:24,000
Are you sure?

513
00:49:30,666 --> 00:49:32,541
Tell me first, what are you gonna do?

514
00:50:00,625 --> 00:50:03,458
Tell me the truth. How did Mac really die?

515
00:50:03,541 --> 00:50:05,875
Everyone knows that
his motorcycle flipped over.

516
00:50:06,916 --> 00:50:08,333
Tell me the truth.

517
00:50:22,208 --> 00:50:23,250
I know

518
00:50:24,375 --> 00:50:26,958
Mink and Mac had something going on.

519
00:50:33,916 --> 00:50:35,333
Do you know

520
00:50:35,416 --> 00:50:38,666
what the soul of someone
who commits suicide becomes?

521
00:50:38,750 --> 00:50:39,958
Do you?

522
00:50:43,166 --> 00:50:45,166
Tell me where Mac killed himself.

523
00:50:59,625 --> 00:51:03,250
THE TEAM IS CERTAIN
MINK'S SYMPTOMS

524
00:51:03,333 --> 00:51:05,958
AREN'T RELATED TO INHERITANCE,

525
00:51:06,041 --> 00:51:10,458
BUT THERE IS "SOMETHING ELSE"
POSSESSING MINK.

526
00:51:13,666 --> 00:51:14,833
Sit down slowly.

527
00:51:14,916 --> 00:51:17,375
Now that Nim won't do
the acceptance ceremony for Mink,

528
00:51:17,458 --> 00:51:19,208
do you know what you're going to do next?

529
00:51:19,291 --> 00:51:21,666
If she won't help me,

530
00:51:21,750 --> 00:51:23,416
I'll find my own way.

531
00:51:29,375 --> 00:51:30,500
Even if

532
00:51:31,208 --> 00:51:33,375
it may go against my religion.

533
00:51:36,208 --> 00:51:37,416
I must do it.

534
00:52:12,458 --> 00:52:13,458
Mac!

535
00:52:14,250 --> 00:52:17,458
Tell me. All of this is your doing, right?

536
00:52:18,750 --> 00:52:21,625
I know that you love her,
but you can't take her.

537
00:52:23,416 --> 00:52:24,708
Do you hear me?

538
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:49,541
Are you really going to do this, Noi?

539
00:52:49,625 --> 00:52:51,208
Yeah. Just drive.

540
00:53:17,541 --> 00:53:20,083
-Get the stuff and come upstairs.
-All right.

541
00:54:09,250 --> 00:54:10,666
Stop right now!

542
00:54:10,750 --> 00:54:12,458
Stop! I said stop!

543
00:54:12,541 --> 00:54:14,083
-Stop!
-Nim!

544
00:54:14,166 --> 00:54:15,791
-Stop it!
-Why are you doing this?

545
00:54:16,458 --> 00:54:19,083
How could you do
a random ceremony like this?

546
00:54:19,166 --> 00:54:20,875
What if she receives some evil spirit?

547
00:54:20,958 --> 00:54:23,041
What do you expect me to do?
She is about to die.

548
00:54:23,125 --> 00:54:24,625
-You won't help me.
-You don't understand.

549
00:54:24,708 --> 00:54:25,958
Why wouldn't I help you?

550
00:54:26,041 --> 00:54:27,958
-I have my own way.
-When are you gonna help me?

551
00:54:28,041 --> 00:54:30,333
-Why did you do the ceremony with him?
-You want me to watch my child die?

552
00:54:30,416 --> 00:54:32,625
Do you know who he is? Mink.

553
00:54:32,708 --> 00:54:34,875
When are you going to help?
Are you going to let her die?

554
00:54:34,958 --> 00:54:36,416
Mink?

555
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:38,583
Mink! Mink! Stop it, Mink!

556
00:54:40,458 --> 00:54:42,791
Mink! Mink, stop!

557
00:54:42,875 --> 00:54:44,958
Stop! Mink!

558
00:54:59,291 --> 00:55:00,666
Mink.

559
00:55:00,750 --> 00:55:01,875
Mink?

560
00:55:01,958 --> 00:55:03,083
Mink?

561
00:55:03,958 --> 00:55:05,000
Mink?

562
00:55:06,333 --> 00:55:07,333
Mink!

563
00:55:08,750 --> 00:55:09,791
Mink!

564
00:55:12,041 --> 00:55:13,041
Mink!

565
00:55:38,458 --> 00:55:39,791
-Mink!
-Mink!

566
00:55:39,875 --> 00:55:41,458
-Mink!
-Mink!

567
00:55:42,458 --> 00:55:44,708
Mink? Mink?

568
00:55:44,791 --> 00:55:46,958
-Mink?
-Mink!

569
00:55:47,041 --> 00:55:48,041
Mink.

570
00:55:49,333 --> 00:55:50,333
Mink?

571
00:55:51,250 --> 00:55:52,541
-Mink?
-Mink!

572
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:54,291
Mink?

573
00:55:57,375 --> 00:55:58,375
Mink!

574
00:56:30,666 --> 00:56:31,750
Nim.

575
00:56:31,833 --> 00:56:33,541
What about Mink?

576
00:56:33,625 --> 00:56:34,708
Mink.

577
00:56:34,791 --> 00:56:38,000
-Where's Mink, Nim?
-Lie down. Lie down first.

578
00:56:39,625 --> 00:56:42,458
What about Mink?
Did you find Mink? Did you find her?

579
00:56:47,708 --> 00:56:51,500
Mink! Why is she like this, Nim?

580
00:56:54,208 --> 00:56:56,250
You have to help Mink.

581
00:56:56,333 --> 00:56:58,416
You have to help her, Nim.

582
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:02,083
The only way to find her is
to hold a ceremony.

583
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,500
But first things first.
Noi must open her heart

584
00:57:08,583 --> 00:57:10,708
to accept Ba Yan

585
00:57:11,625 --> 00:57:13,625
and beg for her forgiveness,

586
00:57:14,708 --> 00:57:18,166
even if she once shunned Ba Yan,

587
00:57:18,250 --> 00:57:20,541
which is a serious matter.

588
00:57:21,458 --> 00:57:23,958
But I believe she will have mercy on Noi.

589
00:57:24,041 --> 00:57:25,708
Lift it above your head.

590
00:57:27,625 --> 00:57:29,875
If Noi really opens her heart to her,

591
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:32,500
Ba Yan will definitely forgive her.

592
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:37,166
Give the offerings to her.

593
00:57:51,875 --> 00:57:53,166
What's that smell?

594
00:57:53,250 --> 00:57:54,583
Go through it all.

595
00:57:56,541 --> 00:58:01,166
We have to gather all the foul things
Mink's collected from various places

596
00:58:01,250 --> 00:58:02,416
and do a ceremony.

597
00:58:04,750 --> 00:58:06,500
What is this? Take a look.

598
00:58:06,583 --> 00:58:13,208
Because in these things, there are traces
of the spirits Mink came in contact with.

599
00:58:13,291 --> 00:58:16,750
Nim. Look here.
She even kept this under the bed.

600
00:58:25,083 --> 00:58:26,583
She has baby shoes too.

601
00:58:31,666 --> 00:58:32,916
Nim.

602
00:58:35,833 --> 00:58:38,916
Take everything out of here.
Take it all away.

603
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,708
And we must do the ceremony
where Mac killed himself.

604
00:58:49,750 --> 00:58:53,041
I'll have to pray to Mac not to harm Mink.

605
00:58:54,958 --> 00:58:56,416
I have to let Mac know,

606
00:58:57,375 --> 00:59:02,791
even if he loved Mink, or was mad
and seeking revenge on this family,

607
00:59:03,375 --> 00:59:05,416
I won't let him do anything to her.

608
00:59:31,791 --> 00:59:37,208
Actually, I don't even know
how much longer I have to pray.

609
00:59:37,958 --> 00:59:40,166
No matter how long it takes,
I'll just keep doing it

610
00:59:40,250 --> 00:59:43,916
until I know where Mac took Mink.

611
00:59:51,458 --> 00:59:53,458
A taxi saw the announcement,

612
00:59:54,250 --> 00:59:56,958
so he gave the clip from his dash cam
to the police.

613
00:59:57,041 --> 01:00:00,291
The driver said that he picked Mink up
around 3:00 a.m.

614
01:00:01,666 --> 01:00:02,916
When she got in,

615
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,416
he asked her questions,
but she didn't answer.

616
01:00:06,333 --> 01:00:08,375
After that, you can see
what happened in the clip.

617
01:00:11,916 --> 01:00:12,916
Hey.

618
01:00:13,750 --> 01:00:14,958
Where are you going?

619
01:00:16,416 --> 01:00:17,416
Hey!

620
01:00:18,541 --> 01:00:20,041
Hey!

621
01:00:20,125 --> 01:00:21,791
What the hell?

622
01:00:21,875 --> 01:00:23,500
Fine, I'm gonna leave now.

623
01:00:33,750 --> 01:00:34,750
Shit!

624
01:00:35,916 --> 01:00:36,916
Damn it.

625
01:00:40,666 --> 01:00:42,750
Maybe this clip is edited?

626
01:00:42,833 --> 01:00:44,625
I had someone take a look at the scene.

627
01:00:45,416 --> 01:00:47,625
There hasn't been any other leads on Mink.

628
01:00:48,875 --> 01:00:52,083
If there is any more news,
I'll let you know.

629
01:01:12,375 --> 01:01:14,708
I'm worried for my daughter.

630
01:01:14,791 --> 01:01:18,083
I don't know where she is now,
alive or dead.

631
01:01:18,166 --> 01:01:19,791
All I can do is pray

632
01:01:20,708 --> 01:01:22,333
to the Lord

633
01:01:22,416 --> 01:01:25,500
and any other gods out there.

634
01:01:26,541 --> 01:01:28,875
Please bring my daughter back to me.

635
01:01:49,083 --> 01:01:50,958
I already went everywhere.

636
01:01:51,041 --> 01:01:54,458
Everyone's house--
all her friends' houses, all her exes'.

637
01:01:54,541 --> 01:01:56,666
I went everywhere, but no one's seen her.

638
01:01:56,750 --> 01:01:59,000
I've prayed and done everything I could.

639
01:01:59,583 --> 01:02:01,708
If it had worked, she'd be back by now.

640
01:02:01,791 --> 01:02:03,791
HEAVENLY MEAT

641
01:02:06,208 --> 01:02:09,875
SEAMSTRESS TEMPORARILY CLOSED

642
01:02:11,750 --> 01:02:15,041
Ever since Mink disappeared,
everyone in the family is miserable,

643
01:02:15,708 --> 01:02:17,083
especially Noi.

644
01:02:18,250 --> 01:02:20,583
She can't eat or sleep at all.

645
01:02:20,666 --> 01:02:24,125
A month has already passed.
We haven't received any news.

646
01:02:24,208 --> 01:02:25,958
Are you wasting taxpayers' money?

647
01:02:26,041 --> 01:02:27,958
-It's not like that.
-Police are all the same!

648
01:02:28,041 --> 01:02:29,500
No matter which station.

649
01:02:29,583 --> 01:02:31,583
It's been a month.
All I see is you sitting around.

650
01:02:31,666 --> 01:02:33,166
You guys just sit around.

651
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:34,833
-I don't see you doing anything.
-They're working.

652
01:02:34,916 --> 01:02:39,250
I just see you with your eyes open,
that's all. Is this what you call working?

653
01:02:39,333 --> 01:02:41,000
There hasn't been any more news.

654
01:02:41,916 --> 01:02:43,041
Nothing.

655
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,291
No news, no leads from anywhere at all.

656
01:03:09,583 --> 01:03:11,541
I've been completely tricked so far.

657
01:03:12,958 --> 01:03:16,083
It's done by the ones that have
nothing to do with Mac.

658
01:03:16,166 --> 01:03:18,208
Then who are they?

659
01:04:39,083 --> 01:04:42,250
YASANTIA THREAD FACTORY

660
01:05:54,083 --> 01:05:55,083
Mink?

661
01:05:58,416 --> 01:05:59,416
Mink?

662
01:06:00,833 --> 01:06:02,500
Mink? Mink?

663
01:06:04,125 --> 01:06:05,125
Mink?

664
01:06:06,666 --> 01:06:09,916
Mink? Mink? Mink?

665
01:06:10,708 --> 01:06:12,958
Mink? Mink, wake up.

666
01:06:16,125 --> 01:06:18,583
Right now the patient is safe,

667
01:06:18,666 --> 01:06:21,083
but she might be malnourished.

668
01:06:21,166 --> 01:06:24,875
She has bruises and scratches,
but they're not so bad.

669
01:06:24,958 --> 01:06:28,500
Will my daughter go back to normal again?

670
01:06:29,208 --> 01:06:32,500
When the patient regains consciousness,
we'll reevaluate her symptoms.

671
01:06:34,875 --> 01:06:38,208
Right now, things are becoming clearer.

672
01:06:40,666 --> 01:06:43,125
It's a good thing
that it didn't kill Mink.

673
01:06:43,875 --> 01:06:45,833
I'm going to go up the mountain again.

674
01:06:49,208 --> 01:06:52,000
I have to pray and beg Ba Yan once more.

675
01:07:23,333 --> 01:07:25,166
Who did this to you, Ba Yan?

676
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,958
Where did you go?
What did you do? Tell me.

677
01:08:02,833 --> 01:08:04,875
Try to take at least one bite.

678
01:08:08,750 --> 01:08:10,541
It didn't even go in her mouth.

679
01:08:13,750 --> 01:08:20,708
MINK IS COMPLETELY
POSSESSED NOW.

680
01:08:30,250 --> 01:08:31,333
Who are you?

681
01:08:35,333 --> 01:08:37,083
I asked, who are you?

682
01:08:48,583 --> 01:08:50,208
I'm Ba Yan.

683
01:08:52,833 --> 01:08:54,708
I asked, who are you?

684
01:08:55,416 --> 01:08:59,000
Why don't you guess who I am?

685
01:09:00,375 --> 01:09:01,791
Try guessing.

686
01:09:08,583 --> 01:09:11,083
Hey! What's with you?

687
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,000
Mink?

688
01:09:14,583 --> 01:09:16,916
Have you lost it? You're crazy!

689
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,208
Why is she like this?

690
01:09:20,208 --> 01:09:21,750
-Mink?
-Mink!

691
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:26,708
Don't you like young girls' pussies?
Don't you like it?

692
01:09:26,791 --> 01:09:28,666
Why are you doing this? Mink!

693
01:09:28,750 --> 01:09:30,875
Mink, why are you doing this?

694
01:09:30,958 --> 01:09:32,458
-Get her off.
-Let go of me!

695
01:09:32,541 --> 01:09:34,958
-Get her off.
-Let me go!

696
01:09:35,583 --> 01:09:36,958
-Hold her down.
-Let go!

697
01:09:37,625 --> 01:09:40,166
-Why are you like this?
-Let go!

698
01:09:40,250 --> 01:09:43,791
Hold her down. Quick.
Put her index finger in the glass!

699
01:09:44,458 --> 01:09:45,458
Mink.

700
01:09:59,208 --> 01:10:00,291
You know,

701
01:10:01,458 --> 01:10:03,083
the reason you're like this

702
01:10:03,791 --> 01:10:06,166
is because of your beloved sister.

703
01:10:07,291 --> 01:10:10,458
She planned to get you to wear
her clothes every day.

704
01:10:11,375 --> 01:10:13,916
She put talismans in your shoes.

705
01:10:14,833 --> 01:10:19,458
She did everything to get you
to be the shaman instead of her.

706
01:10:20,750 --> 01:10:21,916
Did you know?

707
01:10:45,208 --> 01:10:47,791
Go find something to tie her up with.
Hurry!

708
01:10:47,875 --> 01:10:49,041
Tie her up tightly.

709
01:10:52,125 --> 01:10:53,125
Hurry up.

710
01:10:53,791 --> 01:10:55,541
Hurry! When you're done, get out.

711
01:10:56,166 --> 01:10:58,000
Get out first. Stop filming already.

712
01:10:58,916 --> 01:11:01,416
Get out! Out!

713
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:03,041
Everyone, get out.

714
01:11:20,166 --> 01:11:21,875
I need to find someone to help me.

715
01:11:23,541 --> 01:11:24,875
Nim.

716
01:11:24,958 --> 01:11:26,500
About what Mink just said…

717
01:11:29,500 --> 01:11:30,958
I'm sorry.

718
01:11:32,250 --> 01:11:34,625
It's fine. I'm going to help her anyway.

719
01:13:26,208 --> 01:13:27,583
Santi.

720
01:13:27,666 --> 01:13:30,083
Are you still involved with these clowns?

721
01:13:32,416 --> 01:13:34,166
I still have to make a living, you know.

722
01:13:41,875 --> 01:13:42,875
Mink.

723
01:13:43,791 --> 01:13:44,791
Hey, wait.

724
01:13:45,750 --> 01:13:46,958
You guys

725
01:13:48,166 --> 01:13:50,625
took her to do some random
acceptance ceremony, right?

726
01:13:57,291 --> 01:13:58,958
Mink's condition right now

727
01:14:00,625 --> 01:14:03,791
is like a car that has the key left in it.

728
01:14:04,541 --> 01:14:06,250
Anyone can drive it anywhere.

729
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:09,250
And who is this spirit?

730
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,000
It's not just one.

731
01:14:12,958 --> 01:14:14,625
I don't know who they are.

732
01:14:15,791 --> 01:14:18,583
If you want me to count how many,
it's also impossible.

733
01:14:19,666 --> 01:14:20,958
All I know is that

734
01:14:22,625 --> 01:14:26,125
they're all in it together
because they're vindictive.

735
01:14:36,583 --> 01:14:38,083
And it's this vengeance

736
01:14:39,291 --> 01:14:43,833
that attracted all the wandering ghosts
as well as the lost spirits of beasts…

737
01:14:49,333 --> 01:14:54,750
such as snakes, dogs, centipedes, spiders,

738
01:14:56,083 --> 01:14:58,041
and those of plants and grass.

739
01:15:00,291 --> 01:15:05,625
All of them have gathered together
to become a very powerful, evil demon.

740
01:15:12,791 --> 01:15:15,416
Right here. This is where I found Mink.

741
01:15:19,250 --> 01:15:21,041
We'll conduct the ceremony right here,

742
01:15:22,791 --> 01:15:24,791
where all the evil spirits
originated from.

743
01:15:25,791 --> 01:15:30,083
If we can get rid of them all,
their slivers in Mink will also disappear.

744
01:15:31,041 --> 01:15:32,833
And why does it have to be Mink?

745
01:15:34,291 --> 01:15:38,708
Do you know about the ancestors
of your husband's family?

746
01:15:41,583 --> 01:15:45,833
Wiroj's ancestors beheaded
thousands of people.

747
01:15:48,250 --> 01:15:52,291
The last wishes of those dying people
were to curse the family,

748
01:15:53,875 --> 01:15:57,500
and their children and offspring
never stopped making bad karma.

749
01:15:59,625 --> 01:16:00,625
And Wiroj

750
01:16:01,750 --> 01:16:02,833
married you.

751
01:16:04,708 --> 01:16:06,291
The one who rejected Ba Yan.

752
01:16:15,083 --> 01:16:16,708
From then on…

753
01:16:18,875 --> 01:16:20,875
everything was destined to be that

754
01:16:22,750 --> 01:16:25,500
the one who has to pay redemption is Mink.

755
01:16:38,541 --> 01:16:40,500
Do you think it's reasonable?

756
01:16:42,875 --> 01:16:45,458
About what Santi said,
that everything was destined.

757
01:16:47,750 --> 01:16:51,166
You don't have to worry.
We'll get the auspicious date soon.

758
01:16:51,250 --> 01:16:52,791
Destined by who?

759
01:16:54,583 --> 01:16:55,583
God?

760
01:16:56,458 --> 01:16:58,083
Buddha?

761
01:16:58,166 --> 01:16:59,708
Other deities?

762
01:17:02,625 --> 01:17:05,666
If it's the ancestors
that created bad karma,

763
01:17:05,750 --> 01:17:07,833
why does Mink have to pay for it?

764
01:17:07,916 --> 01:17:09,750
Why not me?

765
01:17:17,875 --> 01:17:19,375
Go sit over there first.

766
01:17:22,750 --> 01:17:24,416
You don't have to think too much.

767
01:17:25,958 --> 01:17:28,750
Once the ceremony is done,
Mink will get better.

768
01:17:28,833 --> 01:17:30,458
Ba Yan will help us.

769
01:17:32,916 --> 01:17:35,375
Back then, when I was sick,

770
01:17:35,458 --> 01:17:38,125
everyone said Ba Yan
was going to possess me.

771
01:17:39,375 --> 01:17:41,125
But I didn't feel anything.

772
01:17:41,958 --> 01:17:43,416
I was just sick.

773
01:17:46,875 --> 01:17:48,375
Let me ask you something.

774
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:52,083
Have you ever seen Ba Yan?

775
01:17:54,291 --> 01:17:56,041
Is there really a Ba Yan?

776
01:17:57,375 --> 01:17:58,583
Of course there is.

777
01:18:00,166 --> 01:18:01,958
Have you ever seen her?

778
01:18:04,875 --> 01:18:05,875
No.

779
01:18:08,125 --> 01:18:09,708
Then how do you know?

780
01:18:11,166 --> 01:18:12,416
I can feel it.

781
01:18:17,083 --> 01:18:18,208
I can feel her.

782
01:18:25,708 --> 01:18:27,625
You have to believe in Ba Yan,

783
01:18:28,833 --> 01:18:30,208
and she will help us.

784
01:18:49,041 --> 01:18:50,458
To perform this ceremony,

785
01:18:50,541 --> 01:18:54,416
the more evil and dangerous the spirits
are, the more I have to be prepared.

786
01:18:55,291 --> 01:18:59,208
I have to make lots of talismans
and consecrate them all,

787
01:18:59,291 --> 01:19:01,708
including a sacred wand.

788
01:19:05,583 --> 01:19:08,000
I consecrate them over and over
with all the power I have.

789
01:19:11,750 --> 01:19:14,625
And I also have to prepare holy water,
candles and incense.

790
01:19:14,708 --> 01:19:16,166
It's really an extravagant affair.

791
01:19:17,208 --> 01:19:20,208
Most importantly,
I have to do the ceremony with Nim.

792
01:19:21,333 --> 01:19:26,583
Nim and I have to be united as one.
It's really tough, but it's challenging.

793
01:19:26,666 --> 01:19:29,875
Although I've been doing this for
a long time. Let's see how tough they are.

794
01:19:29,958 --> 01:19:31,166
SANTI
CEREMONY LEADER

795
01:19:38,583 --> 01:19:40,625
She won't eat anything.

796
01:19:41,333 --> 01:19:44,291
When I talk with her, she's not receptive.

797
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:47,583
I'm really stressed out.

798
01:19:50,166 --> 01:19:51,708
Nim hasn't come either.

799
01:19:51,791 --> 01:19:55,291
She's been busy
with the ceremony preparations.

800
01:19:55,375 --> 01:19:56,791
One other thing.

801
01:19:57,875 --> 01:20:02,000
Every morning when I come down,
the house is a total mess.

802
01:20:04,041 --> 01:20:07,333
It must be Mink. She does it every night.

803
01:20:07,416 --> 01:20:08,958
I don't know what she does.

804
01:20:10,583 --> 01:20:14,041
THE TEAM DECIDES TO INSTALL
CAMERAS INSIDE THE HOUSE

805
01:20:14,125 --> 01:20:18,208
TO OBSERVE MINK'S BEHAVIOR
AT NIGHT.

806
01:20:25,625 --> 01:20:29,000
6 DAYS BEFORE THE CEREMONY

807
01:21:10,958 --> 01:21:11,958
Lucky.

808
01:21:13,291 --> 01:21:14,291
Lucky.

809
01:21:15,666 --> 01:21:16,666
Lucky.

810
01:21:19,041 --> 01:21:20,458
What's wrong, Lucky?

811
01:22:01,958 --> 01:22:04,958
5 DAYS BEFORE THE CEREMONY

812
01:22:54,541 --> 01:22:57,708
4 DAYS BEFORE THE CEREMONY

813
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,833
3 DAYS BEFORE THE CEREMONY

814
01:23:28,916 --> 01:23:31,375
If you set up cameras everywhere
like this, then no more filming.

815
01:23:31,458 --> 01:23:33,833
-Manit…
-Pack your stuff and go! I won't allow it!

816
01:23:33,916 --> 01:23:35,833
I'm asking you,
please watch till the very end.

817
01:23:36,666 --> 01:23:37,666
-Please.
-What?

818
01:23:48,458 --> 01:23:49,833
Why is she like this?

819
01:23:58,708 --> 01:24:01,916
If she's become crazy like this,
how can we keep living together?

820
01:24:05,375 --> 01:24:07,250
You can go live wherever you want.

821
01:24:08,250 --> 01:24:09,916
I'm staying here with my child.

822
01:24:12,791 --> 01:24:14,000
I admit that

823
01:24:14,958 --> 01:24:16,416
it looks scary.

824
01:24:18,750 --> 01:24:20,750
But she's still my child.

825
01:24:22,791 --> 01:24:25,041
It won't be long till she gets better.

826
01:24:26,250 --> 01:24:27,708
Nim will help her.

827
01:24:29,458 --> 01:24:32,708
Nim is an expert.
She's helped lots of people.

828
01:24:32,791 --> 01:24:34,291
She can definitely help Mink.

829
01:24:34,875 --> 01:24:35,916
Don't you think?

830
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:43,833
AFTER SEEING MINK'S BEHAVIOR,

831
01:24:43,916 --> 01:24:49,458
THE FAMILY MEMBERS ALLOWED THE
TEAM TO INSTALL MORE CAMERAS.

832
01:26:10,333 --> 01:26:11,500
My stomach hurts.

833
01:26:27,291 --> 01:26:30,166
2 DAYS BEFORE THE CEREMONY

834
01:26:34,166 --> 01:26:35,708
Done.

835
01:26:35,791 --> 01:26:37,416
She can't get out anymore.

836
01:26:39,333 --> 01:26:43,041
She can only dream of getting out.
That's it. Let's go. All done.

837
01:27:18,250 --> 01:27:19,250
Mink!

838
01:27:22,250 --> 01:27:23,250
Mink!

839
01:27:24,708 --> 01:27:27,958
Guys, wake up! You need to get up!

840
01:28:02,083 --> 01:28:03,458
Holy shit.

841
01:28:40,125 --> 01:28:41,125
Pong!

842
01:28:44,333 --> 01:28:46,708
Pong! Mink! Mink!

843
01:28:47,916 --> 01:28:48,916
Mink!

844
01:28:55,166 --> 01:28:56,208
Pang!

845
01:28:56,875 --> 01:28:57,875
Pang!

846
01:28:59,291 --> 01:29:01,166
-Pong! Pong!
-What is it, Manit?

847
01:29:02,083 --> 01:29:05,541
-Where is Pong? What is it?
-Mink took Pong!

848
01:29:05,625 --> 01:29:07,708
-Huh?
-Mink took my son!

849
01:29:07,791 --> 01:29:10,083
-Where did she take him?
-Let's go look.

850
01:29:10,166 --> 01:29:13,166
-She took my son.
-Where did she take Pong?

851
01:29:13,250 --> 01:29:14,541
Mink.

852
01:29:14,625 --> 01:29:16,875
Let's go find him.

853
01:29:16,958 --> 01:29:18,541
Pong!

854
01:29:19,875 --> 01:29:21,708
Where did she take him?

855
01:29:21,791 --> 01:29:23,833
Come on. Let's go search.

856
01:29:23,916 --> 01:29:25,666
Mink! Why did you take my kid?

857
01:29:25,750 --> 01:29:28,208
Have you lost it?

858
01:29:28,291 --> 01:29:29,291
Mink.

859
01:29:29,375 --> 01:29:30,500
Mink?

860
01:29:31,333 --> 01:29:32,583
Mink!

861
01:29:33,291 --> 01:29:34,500
Mink!

862
01:29:36,375 --> 01:29:37,375
Mink!

863
01:29:37,458 --> 01:29:39,666
-Have you seen Mink?
-No.

864
01:29:39,750 --> 01:29:40,750
Mink!

865
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:44,125
Mink!

866
01:29:45,833 --> 01:29:46,833
Mink!

867
01:29:48,541 --> 01:29:51,791
Damn it! Why are you doing this?

868
01:29:51,875 --> 01:29:54,833
Mink! Where are you?

869
01:29:54,916 --> 01:29:55,916
Mink!

870
01:30:01,583 --> 01:30:02,583
Pong.

871
01:30:05,791 --> 01:30:06,791
Pong!

872
01:30:07,916 --> 01:30:08,916
Pong!

873
01:30:11,708 --> 01:30:12,708
Pong!

874
01:30:13,708 --> 01:30:14,708
My boy.

875
01:30:22,250 --> 01:30:23,250
Pong!

876
01:30:24,125 --> 01:30:25,208
Pong!

877
01:30:35,333 --> 01:30:36,833
It's all right now, baby.

878
01:30:39,666 --> 01:30:40,666
Mink?

879
01:30:42,208 --> 01:30:43,208
Mink!

880
01:30:44,958 --> 01:30:46,208
Mink!

881
01:30:46,291 --> 01:30:47,333
Mink!

882
01:30:48,333 --> 01:30:49,333
Mink!

883
01:30:53,500 --> 01:30:54,500
Mink!

884
01:31:32,625 --> 01:31:33,625
Mink.

885
01:31:43,333 --> 01:31:44,958
Mink! What the hell?

886
01:31:48,083 --> 01:31:49,333
Mink!

887
01:31:49,416 --> 01:31:50,791
Mink.

888
01:31:50,875 --> 01:31:52,291
Let go of him.

889
01:32:01,916 --> 01:32:07,125
1 DAY BEFORE THE CEREMONY

890
01:32:14,333 --> 01:32:15,333
Nim.

891
01:32:18,791 --> 01:32:20,166
Is something wrong?

892
01:32:21,583 --> 01:32:25,041
I've been calling her since last night,
but she hasn't answered.

893
01:32:25,125 --> 01:32:28,375
I can hear her phone ringing inside.
Why won't she answer it?

894
01:32:28,458 --> 01:32:31,208
I'll go get help. Okay.

895
01:32:35,958 --> 01:32:36,958
Nim.

896
01:32:37,916 --> 01:32:38,916
Nim?

897
01:32:40,208 --> 01:32:41,458
Nim!

898
01:32:41,541 --> 01:32:42,875
Where are you?

899
01:32:43,750 --> 01:32:44,791
Nim?

900
01:32:55,791 --> 01:32:57,583
Why are there so many maggots?

901
01:32:59,541 --> 01:33:01,666
Nim? Nim?

902
01:33:04,291 --> 01:33:05,791
Nim!

903
01:33:05,875 --> 01:33:07,916
Nim! Nim!

904
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,291
Wake up. Why are you sleeping like this?

905
01:33:11,083 --> 01:33:12,166
Nim!

906
01:33:12,250 --> 01:33:14,125
Nim! Nim!

907
01:33:14,208 --> 01:33:16,250
Hurry! Come help me!

908
01:33:16,333 --> 01:33:18,375
I don't know what's with her! Quick! Nim!

909
01:33:18,458 --> 01:33:20,958
NIM DIED WHILE ASLEEP.

910
01:33:21,041 --> 01:33:27,333
ISAN PEOPLE CALL IT "LAI TAI."

911
01:33:28,041 --> 01:33:33,166
DOCTORS COULD NOT CONCLUDE
THE CAUSE OF DEATH.

912
01:33:40,083 --> 01:33:42,208
Nim died because of me.

913
01:33:44,541 --> 01:33:47,208
Mink is like this because of me.

914
01:33:48,625 --> 01:33:50,625
I have no one left in my life.

915
01:33:53,458 --> 01:33:57,750
From now on, I'm going to do everything
to protect my daughter from harm.

916
01:33:58,916 --> 01:34:00,500
I'm even willing to die.

917
01:34:02,958 --> 01:34:05,458
Why did Nim die?
The spirits did it, right?

918
01:34:08,375 --> 01:34:09,875
There's no way we can know.

919
01:34:10,708 --> 01:34:12,333
What's that supposed to mean?

920
01:34:14,833 --> 01:34:16,333
Why are you saying such things?

921
01:34:16,416 --> 01:34:18,708
Master, what are we supposed to do now?

922
01:34:19,750 --> 01:34:21,541
Don't worry.

923
01:34:21,625 --> 01:34:24,541
Tomorrow we will conduct the ceremony
as planned.

924
01:34:33,791 --> 01:34:38,375
DAY OF CEREMONY

925
01:34:56,875 --> 01:34:59,500
-Put it here?
-Yeah, put it over there.

926
01:34:59,583 --> 01:35:03,166
Master Santi,
please tell us about today's ceremony.

927
01:35:04,416 --> 01:35:07,083
The ceremony will take place
on the fifth floor.

928
01:35:07,166 --> 01:35:08,625
The first thing I have to do is

929
01:35:09,958 --> 01:35:13,541
summon the evil spirits to gather
into Mink's body.

930
01:35:34,666 --> 01:35:37,375
Then I'll expel the spirits

931
01:35:38,833 --> 01:35:41,375
into the cursed pot.

932
01:35:42,125 --> 01:35:44,958
And I'll take the pot to the ground floor,
bury it,

933
01:35:45,875 --> 01:35:47,958
and perform a spell-binding ritual.

934
01:35:48,833 --> 01:35:51,208
Based on what happened to Nim,

935
01:35:51,291 --> 01:35:54,416
will it be too risky to let Mink still be
a part of the ceremony?

936
01:35:55,416 --> 01:35:56,541
Well, yeah.

937
01:35:57,958 --> 01:36:01,833
But have you noticed
the back of Manit's car?

938
01:36:02,500 --> 01:36:04,333
It has a sticker that says,

939
01:36:05,375 --> 01:36:06,791
"This car is red."

940
01:36:06,875 --> 01:36:09,041
THIS CAR IS RED

941
01:36:10,833 --> 01:36:13,416
What does that have to do
with the ceremony?

942
01:36:38,041 --> 01:36:41,916
Don't let anyone
leave the area of the ceremony at all

943
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:43,666
until the ceremony is over.

944
01:38:14,583 --> 01:38:16,041
Come and eat!

945
01:39:07,541 --> 01:39:10,458
Come on! Come and get it! Come!

946
01:39:25,541 --> 01:39:26,833
Why did she scream?

947
01:39:30,583 --> 01:39:31,583
I don't know.

948
01:40:14,791 --> 01:40:16,000
Noi!

949
01:40:16,083 --> 01:40:17,333
Noi!

950
01:40:17,416 --> 01:40:18,458
Noi!

951
01:40:19,125 --> 01:40:20,125
-Noi.
-How is she?

952
01:40:20,208 --> 01:40:22,458
-She's just blacked out.
-Take her to rest up.

953
01:40:23,125 --> 01:40:24,875
Noi! Noi!

954
01:40:25,875 --> 01:40:26,875
Noi!

955
01:40:28,041 --> 01:40:29,333
How are you, Noi?

956
01:40:29,875 --> 01:40:31,208
Can you hear me?

957
01:40:42,166 --> 01:40:43,916
Is there anyone out there?

958
01:40:46,083 --> 01:40:47,583
Why am I being locked up?

959
01:40:49,041 --> 01:40:51,458
Mom? Are you outside?

960
01:40:51,541 --> 01:40:53,416
Please open the door.

961
01:40:53,500 --> 01:40:54,833
Did the spirit leave already?

962
01:40:56,166 --> 01:40:57,375
I don't know.

963
01:40:58,041 --> 01:40:59,458
Pang?

964
01:40:59,541 --> 01:41:00,708
Mink?

965
01:41:00,791 --> 01:41:02,541
Pang, open the door for me.

966
01:41:02,625 --> 01:41:03,666
Mink?

967
01:41:03,750 --> 01:41:05,250
You're better now, right?

968
01:41:06,333 --> 01:41:07,583
Open the door.

969
01:41:07,666 --> 01:41:09,291
She's well now, right?

970
01:41:09,375 --> 01:41:11,958
Pang, I'm in here. Open the door, please.

971
01:41:12,041 --> 01:41:15,416
I don't know. The master told us not to
open the door if the ceremony isn't over.

972
01:41:15,500 --> 01:41:17,916
-Please open the door.
-Mink?

973
01:41:18,458 --> 01:41:22,541
Open the door for me, please.
I'm locked up in here.

974
01:41:22,625 --> 01:41:23,625
Hold on.

975
01:41:23,708 --> 01:41:26,041
-Pang, please open the door.
-Mink.

976
01:41:26,125 --> 01:41:28,458
No one has called to let us know yet.

977
01:41:28,541 --> 01:41:31,875
Pang. Where are all of you? Pang?

978
01:41:31,958 --> 01:41:34,583
-Mink?
-Pang, open the door.

979
01:41:49,333 --> 01:41:50,875
Mink, are you okay?

980
01:41:53,250 --> 01:41:54,250
Mink?

981
01:42:23,250 --> 01:42:24,291
Pong.

982
01:42:27,375 --> 01:42:29,083
Open the door. My son is in there.

983
01:42:29,166 --> 01:42:30,333
-We can't.
-Open it!

984
01:42:30,416 --> 01:42:32,125
Open it! My son is in there!

985
01:42:32,208 --> 01:42:34,125
We can't.
No matter what, we can't open it.

986
01:42:34,208 --> 01:42:36,250
He's in there! Can't you hear him? Huh?

987
01:42:36,333 --> 01:42:39,583
How can that be?
I just saw your son in the crib.

988
01:42:39,666 --> 01:42:42,208
He's in there! Are you deaf?

989
01:42:52,208 --> 01:42:53,958
My son is in there. Pong!

990
01:42:54,041 --> 01:42:56,583
Master Santi ordered us not to open it.

991
01:42:56,666 --> 01:42:59,541
-Take a look in the crib.
-Mink! Please don't do anything to Pong!

992
01:43:00,291 --> 01:43:01,291
Open the door.

993
01:43:01,375 --> 01:43:02,708
-I can't.
-Open it right now!

994
01:43:02,791 --> 01:43:06,541
-Go look in the crib for me.
-Open it! Open it, damn it!

995
01:43:06,625 --> 01:43:08,791
-Go look in the crib!
-Okay!

996
01:43:09,916 --> 01:43:11,208
Open it!

997
01:43:11,291 --> 01:43:13,250
Pang! Pang!

998
01:43:16,041 --> 01:43:17,208
You can't go in!

999
01:43:19,291 --> 01:43:20,291
Pang!

1000
01:43:21,375 --> 01:43:23,000
-Pong!
-Pang!

1001
01:44:04,708 --> 01:44:06,375
Master, why do you stop here?

1002
01:44:13,958 --> 01:44:14,958
Master?

1003
01:44:21,833 --> 01:44:22,833
Master?

1004
01:44:23,708 --> 01:44:25,458
-What the hell?
-Master?

1005
01:44:26,583 --> 01:44:27,625
Master?

1006
01:44:29,416 --> 01:44:30,416
Master?

1007
01:44:40,333 --> 01:44:41,333
Master?

1008
01:44:44,416 --> 01:44:45,416
Master?

1009
01:44:47,125 --> 01:44:48,125
Master?

1010
01:44:52,833 --> 01:44:54,166
Master, what's wrong?

1011
01:45:06,458 --> 01:45:07,791
No! Master!

1012
01:45:11,750 --> 01:45:12,750
Pong!

1013
01:45:16,125 --> 01:45:17,125
Pong!

1014
01:45:20,416 --> 01:45:22,041
Mink, where is Pong?

1015
01:45:28,208 --> 01:45:29,208
Mink?

1016
01:45:43,958 --> 01:45:45,000
Mink?

1017
01:45:48,666 --> 01:45:49,666
Mink?

1018
01:45:51,458 --> 01:45:52,458
Mink?

1019
01:45:58,625 --> 01:45:59,666
Shit!

1020
01:46:15,791 --> 01:46:17,416
-Shit!
-Open up!

1021
01:46:18,166 --> 01:46:20,208
Open the door! Help!

1022
01:46:20,958 --> 01:46:22,291
Help me!

1023
01:46:22,375 --> 01:46:23,416
Help!

1024
01:46:24,916 --> 01:46:25,916
Help!

1025
01:46:30,625 --> 01:46:31,750
I can't open it.

1026
01:46:33,541 --> 01:46:34,541
Don't.

1027
01:46:35,666 --> 01:46:36,666
No!

1028
01:47:10,500 --> 01:47:11,500
Shit!

1029
01:47:17,458 --> 01:47:19,666
Why did the lights go out?

1030
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,250
Turn on the camera's light.

1031
01:47:24,333 --> 01:47:25,333
Okay.

1032
01:47:29,625 --> 01:47:31,833
Shit. Where did everyone go?

1033
01:47:38,041 --> 01:47:40,833
Hey. What happened? Where is everybody?

1034
01:47:55,500 --> 01:47:57,208
Let's get the hell out of here.

1035
01:48:18,541 --> 01:48:19,791
Fuck this!

1036
01:48:23,458 --> 01:48:25,208
Shit, so damn dark…

1037
01:48:53,500 --> 01:48:54,666
Holy shit.

1038
01:49:33,250 --> 01:49:34,250
Oh, hell.

1039
01:50:04,291 --> 01:50:05,291
Manit!

1040
01:50:06,375 --> 01:50:07,375
Manit!

1041
01:50:10,375 --> 01:50:11,375
Noi.

1042
01:50:16,416 --> 01:50:17,416
Noi.

1043
01:50:18,916 --> 01:50:19,916
Manit.

1044
01:50:21,083 --> 01:50:22,333
Are you all right?

1045
01:50:23,833 --> 01:50:25,000
Are you okay?

1046
01:50:26,041 --> 01:50:27,375
I can feel it now.

1047
01:50:29,166 --> 01:50:31,000
Ba Yan is with me now.

1048
01:50:35,166 --> 01:50:37,083
Ba Yan is with me now.

1049
01:50:38,541 --> 01:50:40,750
Ba Yan is here to help me.

1050
01:51:02,291 --> 01:51:03,916
The ceremony must be continued.

1051
01:51:05,333 --> 01:51:07,541
Go get the potsherd.

1052
01:51:09,208 --> 01:51:12,708
We'll perform the spell-binding ritual
once again.

1053
01:51:15,375 --> 01:51:16,666
Go! Hurry!

1054
01:52:25,541 --> 01:52:26,791
Give me the incense.

1055
01:53:56,833 --> 01:53:59,041
Can I film you instead?

1056
01:54:25,291 --> 01:54:27,166
Why did she put them in that way?

1057
01:54:45,708 --> 01:54:47,250
No, no, no!

1058
01:55:39,708 --> 01:55:42,041
Manit, don't! No!

1059
01:56:29,583 --> 01:56:30,791
You, evil spirit,

1060
01:56:31,458 --> 01:56:33,041
leave my child's body now.

1061
01:56:33,125 --> 01:56:37,125
You're going to surrender now
to the mighty power of Ba Yan!

1062
01:56:49,458 --> 01:56:50,458
Mom.

1063
01:56:52,583 --> 01:56:53,583
Mom.

1064
01:56:59,291 --> 01:57:00,333
Mom.

1065
01:57:01,833 --> 01:57:02,958
Mink?

1066
01:57:04,375 --> 01:57:05,458
Mink?

1067
01:57:07,500 --> 01:57:09,083
Mink, it's you, right?

1068
01:57:09,166 --> 01:57:10,250
Mink?

1069
01:57:12,458 --> 01:57:14,083
It's you, right?

1070
01:57:14,166 --> 01:57:15,291
Mink?

1071
01:58:17,500 --> 01:58:19,083
Please return my child.

1072
01:58:20,416 --> 01:58:22,000
Give me back my child.

1073
01:58:23,875 --> 01:58:24,958
Return her…

1074
01:59:02,541 --> 01:59:05,083
Mink? Can you hear me?

1075
01:59:05,750 --> 01:59:07,750
Mink, are you still in there?

1076
01:59:07,833 --> 01:59:08,833
Mink…

1077
01:59:10,458 --> 01:59:14,333
Don't-- Don't do it. Don't do this to me.

1078
01:59:15,625 --> 01:59:16,791
Mink.

1079
01:59:16,875 --> 01:59:18,333
Can you hear me?

1080
01:59:18,833 --> 01:59:21,083
Mink! I'm sorry.

1081
01:59:23,125 --> 01:59:24,666
I'm sorry.

1082
01:59:25,833 --> 01:59:29,083
Come back to me, Mink. Mink?

1083
01:59:31,333 --> 01:59:34,833
God, please help Mink.

1084
01:59:37,750 --> 01:59:39,541
God, please help Mink.

1085
01:59:57,333 --> 02:00:00,666
Mink, don't give up hope.

1086
02:00:02,916 --> 02:00:05,250
Don't do this.

1087
02:00:06,500 --> 02:00:08,750
Don't do this to me.

1088
02:00:26,250 --> 02:00:29,208
"YASANTIA"

1089
02:00:42,250 --> 02:00:48,958
NIM'S LAST INTERVIEW

1090
02:00:58,166 --> 02:01:00,291
What just happened in front of the altar?

1091
02:01:05,541 --> 02:01:07,375
I was just thinking of

1092
02:01:09,041 --> 02:01:11,833
the day of the ceremony.
I don't know what will happen.

1093
02:01:13,291 --> 02:01:14,833
Why?

1094
02:01:14,916 --> 02:01:17,208
Any problems with the preparations?

1095
02:01:20,208 --> 02:01:22,375
It might mean nothing at all.

1096
02:01:24,166 --> 02:01:26,458
What do you mean?

1097
02:01:45,875 --> 02:01:47,208
Honestly…

1098
02:01:52,958 --> 02:01:54,833
I've never really known…

1099
02:01:56,500 --> 02:01:58,625
I was never really sure…

1100
02:02:01,125 --> 02:02:03,666
if Ba Yan actually possessed me or not.

1101
02:02:05,250 --> 02:02:07,208
What do you mean?

1102
02:02:09,583 --> 02:02:11,208
I don't know anymore.

1103
02:10:31,500 --> 02:10:36,500
