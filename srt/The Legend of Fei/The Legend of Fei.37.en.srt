00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,800

85
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,310

86
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:15,590

87
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:17,630

It’s been years.

00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:23,590
It’s your first time to speak of her.

90
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:25,720
Do you hate her?

91
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:29,150
She’s just a borrowed weapon.

92
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,870
When someone is hurt,

93
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:33,280
he won’t waste time to hate a weapon.

94
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:37,310
You suddenly bring her up.

95
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,520
Is there anything on your mind?

96
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:42,240
I’m just curious.

97
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,720
After Shen Tianshu was defeated
in the Fortress of the Forty-Eight,

98
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:47,560
could she still stay

99
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,590
in Demons Manor?

100

103
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:11,350

the Color of Ocean and Heaven appeared,

104
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:13,150
the Demons are coming out
more frequently.

105
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,310
I’m an off-staff disciple

106
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:27,150

108

What are those Demons doing?

109
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,750
They’re heading
for Cloud Ravine in the south.

110
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,720
Looks like

111
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,240
they’re after someone.

112
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,240
Bonehead.

113
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,750
Drink the water
and let’s get into the town.

114
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:00,750
Someone is there?

115
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,680
A thief, I guess!

116
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:07,520
He ran away so fast.

117
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,680
He must be a spy,

118
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,590
instead of a martial master.

119
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:10,750
I must run after him, too!

120
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,520
Or he will think I’m scared of him.

121
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,280
Our priority is

122
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,030
to deliver Flaming Sage to Lingling.

123
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:16,120
Don’t ask for extra trouble.

124
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:18,840
Fine, then.

125
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,400
Let’s go.

126
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:22,910
Wait.

127
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,680
We won’t ride the horses.

128
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,030
There’ll be loud tramping hoofs.

129
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:27,840
Get the horses that way.

130
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:29,310
We will walk.

131
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,070
You sound

132
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:33,720
much more like your cousin.

133
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,150
What’s the problem with that?

134
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:37,350
We risked our lives
to get the Flaming Sage.

135
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:38,070
If we lose it,

136
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:39,400
we’ll be sorry to Ying Hecong!

137
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,240
Hurry!

138
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,070
Okay.

139
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:57,030
Have we got rid of them?

140
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:59,070
They must have followed the horses

141
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:00,840
and won’t come back.

142
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,660
Let’s go.

143
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:05,870
Someone is here.

144
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,680
Sheng?

145
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,000
Why is it you?

146
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,000
Oh, Li Sheng!

147
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,680
Finally, you’ve come!

148
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,520
At last, I can give her to you

149
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,280
without any wound!

150
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,280
We had such a hard trip.

151
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,520
So hard!

152
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,910
Sheng, you have no idea.

153
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:27,840
I asked you to go back home, didn’t I?

154
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,720
Why did you mess up with the Demons?

155
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,800
If you don’t
practice martial arts carefully,

156
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,590
you will regret!

157
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:34,200
Didn’t Aunt say so?

158
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,200
Didn’t I say so?

159
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,470
You have good luck today.

160
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:38,200
But can you have good luck every day?

161
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,910
Can you have good luck all your life?

162

Li Sheng.

163
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,910
Yan suffered quite a lot.

Stop complaining about her.

165
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,240
Yeah.

166
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,200
Yeah.

167
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,150
She saved our sect.

168
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:51,120
She isn’t that weak.

Sorry to have bothered you.

173
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,800
It... It doesn’t matter.

174
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,640
Oh,

175
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,830
what about the medicine

176
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:08,590
you looked for Fei?

177
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,120
Here.

178
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:17,350
This is precious.

179
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:18,880
We must give it to Fei right away.

180
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,440
Hyah!

181
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:25,950
Hyah!

182
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:28,390
Hyah!

183
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:35,800
A timely arrival is better
than an early one.

184
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,270
You’re all here.

185
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,150
Chuchu.

186
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,910
Take Yan to find Fei.

187
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:47,080
We’ll stop him.

188
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,030
Okay.

189
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:52,150
Yan, let’s go.

190
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,950
Wanna run away?

191
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:54,830
Don’t run after them.

192
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:57,830
They’re not who Lord wants.

193
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,350
Don’t waste our time.

194
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,910
Li Sheng.

195
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,120
I know you have the Flaming Sage.

196
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,640
Give it to me.

197
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,080
Give it to me!

198
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,240
Shoot it.

199
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:35,800
Take them down.

200
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:40,680
Yan, we have to count on you.

201
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,030
Chuchu, I can just do poses.

202
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,150
You should have told me earlier.

203
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:46,390
What do we do, then?

204
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:47,760
Do you think we can convince them?

205
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,950
Let me do it.

206
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:50,080
Hold your breath.

207
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,560
Hurry!

208
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,560
Yan.

209
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:14,910
Chuchu.

210
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:16,270
What powder did you use?

211
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:18,030
It wasn’t powder, but flour.

212
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,080
Go!

213
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:37,510
Li Sheng.

214
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,560
Did you send the signal

215
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,320
because you knew
I was just on my way to the south?

216
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,080
I didn’t!

217
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,950
I didn’t know you could come so quickly.

218
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,910
Where is the Flaming Sage?

219
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,760
Where are Li Yan and Chuchu?

220
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,910
They left before us.

221
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:00,880
Chuchu, I’m too tired to run.

222
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:06,080
Hold your breath.

223
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:09,350
This is true powder.

224
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,880
Are you using the same trick

225
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,270
to sprinkle some flour?

226
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,880
Do you think
we’ll fall into the trick again?

227
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,680
Go!

228
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:16,270
Go!

229
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:21,200
Chuchu.

230
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,710
What was that?

231
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:24,560
The sleeping drug your brother gave me.

232
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:26,760
So,

233
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:30,120
you’re Zhou Fei,
the heiress of the South Blade

234
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,470
my Lord mentioned?

235
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:33,830
Lord Tong.

236
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:35,510
Long time no see.

237
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:37,350
You still look strong.

238
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:39,080
Why are you greeting each other?

239
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,350
We should, of course.

240
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:43,120
Lord Tong and I are destined to meet.

241
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,830
We’re also old acquaintances.

242
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:46,240
When I was little,

243
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,470
he tried to snatch the Bracelet from me
in the Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

244
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:49,390
I poked one of his eyes.

245
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:51,030
Lord Tong.

246
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,270
For the sake of our acquaintance,

247
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:55,390
please turn a blind eye

248
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:57,640
if my cousin has offended you.

249
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,240
I’ll pay you with the other eye.

250
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,030
Very well.

251
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:03,640
Chuchu and Li Yan may be in danger.

252
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,270
Go help them.

253
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:06,470
I’ll hold him back.

254
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,950
No way.

255
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:09,560
He can turn a blind eye,

256
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,200
but I can’t!

257
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,000
He’s my enemy!

258
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,470
So,

259
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,560
he’s your cousin?

260
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,880
Go.

261
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,150
Can you handle him alone?

262
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:18,680
He’s a mere Demon.

263
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,030
Just go.

264
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,000
Lord Tong, the other day,

265
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,510
Lord Lu tried to snatch
a Fire Lotus from me.

266
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:27,390
Now you want
to snatch the Flaming Sage from me.

267
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,150
Why do you people

268
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:29,830
always want medicinal materials?

269
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:31,830
Shame on you.

270
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,390
Does Lord Shen want to run a pharmacy?

271
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:36,880
How arrogant you sound!

272
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:38,680
My Lord wants

273
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,270
to exchange the Flaming Sage

274
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:42,760
for the Seal of Cautiousness!

275
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,270
You’re not too stupid.

276
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:49,760
Unfortunately, I don’t have the Seal.

277
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,910
You can’t get it even if you kill me.

278
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:54,080
Not to mention you can’t kill me.

279
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,080
Think about it carefully.

280
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:58,390
Lord, Mr. Shen received a secret letter.

281
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:00,760
Phoenix Master had
the Seal of Cautiousness.

282
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:05,910
Very well.

283
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,390
You have good luck today.

284
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,150
Let’s go!

285
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,510
I’m too busy to kill you today.

286
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:13,150
It’s your luck.

287
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:25,060
(Demons Manor)

288
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,680
Since when was my sister so strong?

289
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:42,200
Sheng? Bonehead.

290
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:44,150
Are you alright?

291
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,080
We are fine.

292
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,440
Fei came to handle those guys.

293
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:48,000
But you...

294
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,830
Since when were you so strong?

295
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:51,200
You defeated so many Demons.

296
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,270
I didn’t defeat them.

297
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:53,760
Chuchu did.

298
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,640
Don’t look at me.

299
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,440
I don’t have martial arts.

300
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,880
I just used the sleeping drug
you gave me.

301
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,510
Are you idiots?

302
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:10,470
So,

303
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:13,880
Zhou Fei gave Phoenix Master
the Seal of Cautiousness?

304
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:14,950
Yes.

305
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:19,680
Who?

306
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,510
My Lord.

307
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:23,030
People with Xingnan Sect are coming.

308
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:24,320
Very good.

309
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:26,470
They’re just in time.

310
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,590
Young Master.

311
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:31,910
In my opinion,

312
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:34,470
we shouldn’t interfere

313
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:36,080
with strangers.

314
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,640
Miss Zhou isn’t a stranger.

315
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,440
She saved us.

316
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,150
Do you want my brother

317
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:42,240
to be ungrateful?

318
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,640
Young Master.

319
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:50,560
We’re a small sect.

320
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,880
After we annoyed the Demons

321
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,000
and Qinghui, the Immortal
with Four-guardian Mountain,

322
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:56,880
I’m afraid there’ll be constant trouble.

323
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,270
It’s okay, Mr. Lin.

324
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:00,030
We’ll just leave Lingling overnight.

325
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:01,950
Did I allow you to leave?

326
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,830
Kill them!

327
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,440
Sir, you...

328
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
It’s okay.

329
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,440
Let’s go to Liu’s Manor.

330
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,320
Aye!

331
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:56,640
Ying!

332
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:02,120
Ying!

333
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,870
Last night, I heard

334
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:11,910
someone was fighting against the Demons
in the suburb.

335
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:14,110
I didn’t know it could be you.

336
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,800
Do you want to take revenge?

337
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:20,440
Then you must be strong.

338
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,720
I can help you with that.

339
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,480
Take it.

340
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,680
Wait.

341
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:57,080
After you swallow it,

342
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,750
put it on.

343
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,360
When will your lord come?

344
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,870
Please wait a moment.

345
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:11,750
Mr. Li.

346
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:12,750
I’m terribly sorry

347
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,080
to have kept you waiting.

348
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:15,840
Where’s your lord?

349
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,680
I’ve been so busy in the forecourt
the whole morning

350
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,890
that I didn’t know he was sick.

351
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:19,560
Sick?

352
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,910
How was he sick?

353
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,270
He caught a cold, I guess.

354
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,080
Since we’ve come,

355
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,390
I’ll go check on him.

356
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:35,270
No, no, no.

357
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:36,720
He’s nearly fine.

358
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,270
You don’t need to go.

359
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:39,360
He said

360
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,600
when he got better,

361
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,600
he would visit you personally.

362
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,320
I don’t think he’s sick.

363
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,320
He’s just scared of Qinghui, I guess.

364
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:50,560
He’s getting old.

365
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,680
He just wants as much peace

366
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,030
as he can have.

367
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:55,360
So, Mr. Li,

368
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,870
please leave

369
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,800
and ask someone else for help.

370
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,390
Mr. Chen.

371
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,320
Here I am!

372
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,560
Where is he?

373
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,440
Inside the cave.

374
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,080
Go check on him.

375
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:32,680
He can barely hold on.

You’re really a great girl.

The Flaming Sage, for example,

481
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,800
isn’t an ordinary thing.

482
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,600
You flatter me.

483
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,960

484
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:27,200

What can he do?

487
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,110
Think about other people.

488
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:43,840
Some go uphill.

489
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,360
Some go downhill.

490
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:48,480
Some remain where they are.

491
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,560
They take steps on the ground.

492
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:53,960
But you’re different.

493
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,840
You don’t go up the slope,
but the cliff.

494
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,870
There’s no path between stone steps.

495
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:03,910
Every time,
you must jump up desperately.

496
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:07,150
When you just seize the rock
on the cliff,

497
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:09,560
you must struggle up again.

498
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,910
If you fall instead of climbing up,

499
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:14,560
you will be smashed into pieces.

500
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,990
You’re going a way

501
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:18,180
where there’s no turning back.

502
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,000
Tell me.

503
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:22,150
Did you fear?

504
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:27,150
I did, of course.

505
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:28,680
What did you do

506
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,990
when you feared?

507
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:33,910
Fear?

508
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:38,030
Fear is a common feeling.

509
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:43,480
Whenever I’m in danger,

510
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:46,270
I feel like being stuck
in the crack of rocks.

511
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:50,990
If I don’t want to remain stuck,

512
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:53,270
I must move on.

00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:09,640
What do you think?

680
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,430
What are you laughing at?

681
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,800
I’m laughing

682
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,160
because it’s such a good name.

683
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,160
Sounds glorified.

684
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,160
Do you want it?

685
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:22,990
If you don’t, give it back to me.

686
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:25,670
I want it. It’s your gift for me.

687
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:29,430
-You girl...
-Thank you.

688
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,230
(Liang’s Mansion)
We’re terribly sorry.

689
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:40,560
Our chief isn’t in lately.

690
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,800
Where...? Where has he gone?

691
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,120
We’re not sure.

692
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:54,510
In a few days,

693
00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:56,560
it will be the birthday
of Lord Liu’s mother.

694
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,470
Did he invite you?

695
00:39:57,470 --> 00:39:59,710
He did. But I’m not going.

696
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:01,160
(Tea)
When Lord Liu invited you,

697
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,670
it was your great honor.

698
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,880
You don’t understand.

699
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:08,190
A friend of mine works at Liu’s Manor.

700
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:09,800
He told me

701
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,990
Qinghui asked Lord Liu for money

702
00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:13,560
the other day.

703
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,560
Unexpectedly,

704
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,950
Lord Liu didn’t respect him at all.

705
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:17,670
I’m afraid

706
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:19,710
if we meet Qinghui that day,

707
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:21,560
we’ll suffer.

708
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:22,600
You’re right.

709
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,030
(Lord Liu)
Mr. Liu.

710
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,190
I asked nearby martial artists.

711
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:28,670
No one wants to help us

712
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:31,880
deal with Qinghui,

713
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,510
We have few men.

714
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:35,400
I’m afraid we can’t kill him.

715
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:38,880
Since we’ve decided to kill him,

716
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,710
we must do it,

717
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:42,840
no matter how many men we have.

718
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,990
Look at the martial world.

719
00:40:44,990 --> 00:40:47,320
Huo’s Manor is ruined.

720
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,030
Yin Wenlan is dead.

721
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:51,510
Qi School has disappeared.

722
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,840
Even people
with the Fortress of the Forty-Eight

723
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:56,230
are busy fighting against the Demons!

724
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:59,640
If we can’t unite as one,

725
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:02,400
how can we kill Qinghui?

726
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:06,430
A lot of people are enemies of Qinghui!

727
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:08,270
As long as we unite,

728
00:41:08,270 --> 00:41:09,990
we will kill him.

729
00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:11,640
Good point!

730
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:15,840
Master.

731
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,190
A Mr. Li asked to see you out there.

732
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:19,470
He said he was Li Sheng
with the Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

733
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:20,750
Li Sheng?

734
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:23,080
Grandson of Li Zheng?

735
00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:28,800
I’m Li Sheng
with the Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

736
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:32,920
Greetings, everyone.

737
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:37,600
Mr. Li, what brings you here?

738
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,750
I come here,

739
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:41,640
for Qinghui.

740
00:41:42,990 --> 00:41:44,600
Qinghui?

741
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:49,030
Lord Liu, you must know

742
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:51,400
what Qinghui has done.

743
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,710
The longer he lives,

744
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:55,080
the more people will suffer.

745
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:57,880
I want to unite everyone

746
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:01,030
to kill him once for all.

747
00:42:01,470 --> 00:42:04,600
What’s your plan, Mr. Li?

748
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:07,400
I’ve got a plan.

749
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:12,560
To be honest, we do want to kill him.

750
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,270
But we’re worried

751
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:17,360
if we have enough men.

752
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:20,670
I’ve travelled around, asking for help.

753
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:21,800
I didn’t get as much support
as I expected.

754
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:25,510
But still a lot of martial masters
are willing to help.

755
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:27,510
Today, I come to you.

756
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:28,560
If we can cooperate,

757
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,670
we’ll stand a big chance.

758
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:34,640
I’d like to set a trap in a few days.

759
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:37,670
As for the place...

760
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:42,640
Your yard looks good.

761
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,560
As long as we can kill Qinghui,

762
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:47,710
I won’t care for a mere yard!

763
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:50,800
Good!

764
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,160
Fei didn’t come?

765
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,030
Miss Zhou Fei arrived yesterday.

766
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:04,840
She was wandering around this morning.

767
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:06,030
I don’t know

768
00:43:06,030 --> 00:43:08,270
where she is now.

769
00:43:08,270 --> 00:43:11,950
I had thought she wouldn’t stay

770
00:43:11,950 --> 00:43:14,360
and I would miss her
when I went for the herbs.

771
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:15,990
She probably knows

772
00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:19,840
Xie Yun is getting weaker and weaker

773
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:21,880
and she won’t see him for many times.

774
00:43:22,510 --> 00:43:25,230
She’s stayed for a few more days.

775
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:27,270
I put the thing she brought

776
00:43:27,270 --> 00:43:29,600
on your bedside.

777
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,130
It’s the Flaming Sage.

778
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:36,580
She must have suffered a lot

779
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:40,160
to collect these things.

780
00:43:53,990 --> 00:43:55,880
You’re lucky enough.

781
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:57,150
I’ll let you go

782
00:43:57,710 --> 00:44:00,920
to pray for Xie Yun.

783
00:44:28,510 --> 00:44:30,990
I feel he’s waking up.

784
00:44:30,990 --> 00:44:32,470
How long has he been asleep?

785
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:33,320
It’s about time.

786
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:34,920
Yeah. Yeah.

787
00:44:38,990 --> 00:44:41,430
Anzhi, you’re awake?

788
00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:42,670
Junior Master.

789
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:43,800
Come on.

790
00:44:44,670 --> 00:44:47,320
Be careful. Slow down.

791
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:49,560
Get up slowly.

792
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:53,560
Anzhi, I guess you’re waking up.

793
00:44:54,990 --> 00:44:55,990
Master.

794
00:44:55,990 --> 00:44:58,080
Come on. Take the decoction.

795
00:45:03,190 --> 00:45:04,430
Oh,

796
00:45:04,990 --> 00:45:06,800
how long were I asleep?

797
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:08,320
Not very long.

798
00:45:11,190 --> 00:45:12,560
Where’s Fei?

799
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:15,510
You really are a couple.

800
00:45:15,510 --> 00:45:17,400
No wonder you like each other.

801
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:19,470
When you woke up, she fell asleep.

802
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:21,080
She’s next door.

803
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:24,230
Come on. Take it when it’s hot.
