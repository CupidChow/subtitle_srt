17

I am just afraid

18
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,370
she may worry about
what is even more valuable to her.

19
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,610
The liquor

20
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:52,250
is fresh and good.

21
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,430
But I prefer the liquor my dad made.

22
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,780
The beauty is gorgeous.

23
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:32,910
Whenever I see her,

24
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:34,220
I fall for her.

25
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:11,150
Fei.

26
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,470
Fei?

27
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:25,460
Liquor is

28
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,320
to be tasted.

29
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:29,020
You drank too fast.

30
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,000
Are you drunk?

31
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:55,080
Here, put on the blanket.

32
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:58,530
Go away.

33
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:27,790
Sir,

34
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:30,230
do you have a blade this long

35
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:32,000
with a narrow back

36
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,390
and a sharp edge?

37
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,480
May I ask

38
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,670
why you need a blade?

39
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:37,640
As a gift to a girl.

40
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,200
Sir, to be blunt,

41
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,640
this isn’t the way
of getting a girl’s heart.

42
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,640
Girls prefer make-up products

43
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,510
like rouge, foundation.

44
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:47,580
But she…

45
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:49,390
She prefers blade.

46
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:52,110
But the price is...

47
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,090
Name your price.

48
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,600
Well...

49
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,790
Deal.

50
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,760
Okay, okay, okay.

51
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,670
Sir, please wait.

52
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:04,790
I’ll get it for you.

53
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:06,600
I’ll get it for you.

54
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,270
Please wait a second.

55
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:09,110
I’ll be back soon.

56
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:15,620
Sirs, welcome.

57
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:22,830
Blade is nice.

58
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:24,060
I like girls wielding a blade.

59
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:57,180
What did I do last night?

60
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,910
I can’t remember anything.

61
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,950
Where should I hang it?

62
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:33,520
There’s no place to hang it.

63
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:49,850
Who is it?

64
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:52,250
Fei.

65
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,190
Fei.

66
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,480
Chuchu.

67
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,620
What... What’s the matter?

68
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:07,900
My...

69
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:09,810
My stomach hurts.

70
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:19,870
Well...

71
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,880
On our way here,

72
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,390
I saw a clinic on the street.

73
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:24,950
Let me take you to the doctor.

74
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:26,790
Sure.

75
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:27,740
Wait for me.

76
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:32,220
Let’s go.

77
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,030
Please don’t run into Mr. Xie.

78
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:40,900
He may ask about it again.

79
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,470
I saw him went out

80
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:44,350
already an hour ago.

81
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:45,440
He’s out again?

82
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,400
Where to?

83
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,670
I don’t know.

84
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:48,270
Fei.

85
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:51,110
Hurry.

86
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:52,910
Wait, wait.

87
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:56,980
Where are you going?

88
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:58,710
Just hang out.

89
00:08:58,710 --> 00:08:59,520
Hang out?

90
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,350
It’s a mess out there.

91
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:02,790
Plus, you’re bringing Chuchu with you.
It’s improper.

92
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:03,910
Chenfei,

93
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,630
I wanted to go out.

94
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,840
You look bad.

95
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,880
Are you not feeling well?

96
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,080
I’m okay.

97
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:11,670
It’s fine.

98
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:12,640
Let’s find you a doctor.

99
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,790
Chenfei.

100
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,550
We girls want to go out.

101
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:16,790
What’s wrong with it?

102
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:18,400
Nothing wrong.

103
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:20,040
Or you want to join us?

104
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,690
Chuchu.

105
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,590
Leader asked me
to keep an eye on you.

106
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:26,000
If you want to go out,

107
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,880
let me join you.

108
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,110
Now I’m here.

109
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,790
I can protect her.

110
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:30,420
Wait.

111
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,200
Fei.

112
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,400
You are a junior apprentice.

113
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,320
As a senior one, I should protect you.

114
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,880
No, I have to go with you.

115
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,960
Chenfei.

116
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,150
Wu Xiaodi is here, too.

117
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:41,840
You stay here and protect him.

118
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,200
I’ll go out with Chuchu.

119
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,150
We’ll be back soon.

120
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:46,080
Fine.

121
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:46,960
You can go then.

122
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,470
But come back before it gets dark.

123
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:50,000
Don’t go too far.

124
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:55,000
The man behind Huo Liantao

125
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,370
is the Third Prince Chen Zichen.

126
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,950
As for The Color of Ocean and Heaven...

127
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,290
Lord, there’s an emergency.

128
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,550
What’s wrong?

129
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:14,110
Third Lord has taken actions.

130
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:39,710
I’ll fill the prescription.

131

A bird of prey follows him everywhere.

137
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,790
It must be Qiu Tianjin.

138
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:38,230
Emergency! Emergency!

139
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,790
What happened

140
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:44,280
with all the strangers carrying weapons?

141
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,710
Emergency! Help!

142
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:47,790
Run!

143

Run! Run!

145
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:56,080
It caught fire over there.

It’s on fire! Fire!

Sir, I’m closing.

150
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:06,350
Do you want this blade?

151
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:08,030
Yes, yes.

152
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,880
Okay, okay.

153
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:13,550
Run!

154
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:15,080
Hurry and go.

155
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,840
Hurry up.

156
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:23,520
Go and run!

157
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,230
What’s happening out there?

158
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:25,470
Let’s go and see.

159
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:27,200
Let’s go.

160
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:31,200
What’s wrong? What happened?

161
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,230
Check it out, go.

162
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:35,000
Hurry up, run!

00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,910
-Help, help!
-Go, go!

164
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:38,440
It’s too dangerous.

165
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,150
Where should we go?

166
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,640
Hurry.

167
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:45,640
Mr. Bai?

168
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,400
(Mr. Bai)

169
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,760
-Run!
-Run!

170
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:59,670
What a tragedy.

171
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:02,200
The fire has burned it all.

172
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,400
What a tragedy.

173
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,670
A nice hotel

174
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:06,110
was burnt to ashes.

175
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,150
Yeah, yeah.

176
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:09,350
I heard there were many people in it

177
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:10,790
who got burned to death.

178
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:13,710
What happened

179
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,080
with the hotel?

180
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,400
What a tragedy.

181
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,400
(Umbrella)
What a crime.

182
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,280
(Peach Blossom Liquors)
It’s so sad for all these people.

183
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,440
The fire has burned it all.

184
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:26,590
Yeah.

185
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:27,960
Who died here?

186
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,470
What?

187
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,150
Why would it catch fire?

188
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:33,520
Who knows?

189
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,030
The Demons did it.

190
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,520
My brother...

191
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,110
Chuchu.

192
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:01,280
Let’s find a place to hide.

193
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,000
Let’s go.

194
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:24,940

(Animal characters made by CG)

196
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:29,790
(Animal characters made by CG)
What happened with those people inside?

197
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:31,440
(Animal characters made by CG)
Looks like they were burned alive.

198
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:33,050
(Animal characters made by CG)
What a big scene.

199
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:34,140
(Animal characters made by CG)
I’ve never seen it.

200
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,670
I know, right?

201
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,350
The County Leader is here.
The County Leader is here.

202
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,110
He’s here.

203
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:43,960
The County Leader came with people.

204
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,520
It’s huge.

205
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:49,740
(Animal characters made by CG)

206
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,910
(Animal characters made by CG)
They can’t just die like that.

207
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:51,710
(Animal characters made by CG)
The County Leader is here.

208
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:53,000
(Animal characters made by CG)
I am the local county leader.

209
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,440
Who are you?

210
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,670
Why did you do evil for no reason?

211
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,470
(Mr. Zhu)

212
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:00,150
(Mr. Zhu)
Do you know...?

213
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:02,020
(Animal characters made by CG)

214
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,580
(Zhi)

215
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,240
You are one of them?

216
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:15,320
How come the two of you came?

217
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:21,030
You talk too much.

218
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:24,000
Have you forgotten

219
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,670
whose possession it is?

220
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:34,350
Just follow my order.

221
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:36,200
Step aside.

222
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:46,660
(Animal characters made by CG)

223
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,360
Why doesn’t the county leader
do anything?

224
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:58,830
Third Lord.

225
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,200
Yes.

226
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,670
Mr. Zhu.

227
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:06,320
I need your soldiers.

228
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,700
Please.

229
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,150
They...

230
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:15,790
You guys,

231
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:16,670
bring them in and search.

232
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:17,520
Yes.

233
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:19,840
All burned just like this.

234
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:26,840
What a crime. Nothing left here.

235
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,400
Isn’t him

236
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,280
the contact person at the hotel?

237
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,790
How could it be him?

238
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,640
Make way.

239
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,230
Make way.

240
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,640
Move.

241
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:51,200
Third Lord.

242
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,190
The Lord is here.

243
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:10,670
Brother.

244
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:20,870
Mr. Zhu.

245
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:22,290
It’s

246
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,360
my bad

247
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,880
for causing you all these troubles.

248
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,790
It’s okay.

249
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:48,100
(Umbrella)

250
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,750
Tianjin,

251
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:53,850
couldn’t you hold it any longer?

252
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:57,020
I had to do it.

253
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,570
People of the Wu family has appeared.

254
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:02,160
They’re coming for us.

255
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,190
If we don’t act fast,

256
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,540
whose fault is it

257
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:07,140
if they run away?

258
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,800
Besides, I just

259
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,520
did what I was told to do.

260
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,840
I wonder if you

261
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,080
have different ideas?

262
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:20,950
Now the guy we wanted
has pleaded guilty.

263
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:23,520
I still have a lot to deal with.

264
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,340
I won’t trouble you then.

265
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:39,000
Thank you in advance.

266
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,830
I’m going now.

267
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:42,710
Take care.

268
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:44,590
Let’s go.

269
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,800
Take care, Brother.

270
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,310
Lord.

271
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:57,880
What’s our plan now?

272
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,430
Go find the county leader.

273
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:01,310
Ask him to put the city in lockdown

274
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:03,070
and set block at the entrance.

275
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:04,590
Pay more attention.

276
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:07,680
Don’t let the old dog Qiu Tianjin
ruin our plan.

277
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:08,950
Yes.

278
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:23,620
(Huarong Hotel)

279
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:02,570
Sir.

280
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,670
This is a guy from
Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

281
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,820
I have to find a way
to bring Chuchu out of here.

282
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:32,210
I’ve just found out

283
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,160
what the Fortress of the Forty-Eight is
which was guarded by Mother.

284
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:38,320
And why Father said

285
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:40,450
that it needed him down here.

286
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,730
Third Lord,
a woman and a kid are missing.

287
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:54,590
My guess is right.

288
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:56,060
Some of them escaped.

289
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:01,230
Now search the whole city.

290
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:01,830
Yes.

291
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,310
Fellas, attention please.

292
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:07,000
Recent days have not been peaceful.

293
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,430
There were gangsters
who pretended as merchants

294
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:10,800
blending in the city.

295
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,180
They are up to no good.

296
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:15,040
Luckily, some people
were smart and alert.

297
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,560
They reported it in time.

298
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,830
Now the evils are in control.

299
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:22,110
In case someone escaped,

300
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:25,280
I’m asking you
to close the doors at night.

301
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,590
Don’t take in strangers at home.

302
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:28,430
Now the gate is closed.

303
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:29,660
We don’t have vehicles.

304
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,430
It’d be conspicuous

305
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:32,640
to go out now.

306
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,760
Recent days have not been peaceful.

307
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:37,800
There were gangsters
who pretended as merchants.

308
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,640
But we don’t know

309
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,040
how many of them are here.

310
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,710
Maybe when we go out,

311
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:43,400
there’s a trap for us.

312
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,230
The safest way would

313
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:48,000
be to find a place to hide.

314
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:51,190
But they just

315
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:52,520
gave an order

316
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:54,640
to search the whole city.

317
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,590
It’d be in an uproar.

318
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:03,560
Where…

319
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,760
Where should we hide?

320
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:11,390
I think of a place.

321
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,780
We can go hide
inside the county government.

322
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,750
Inside the county government?

323
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,430
Inside the county government

324
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:23,380
is where the county leader’s family
live.

325
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,470
The Demons

326
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:27,920
wouldn’t search there

327
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,070
no matter what.

328
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:34,110
Okay, then.

329
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:35,520
Where...

330
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,640
Where should we go?

331
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:37,760
Right there.

332
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:46,470
Mr. Zhu.

333
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:49,400
Ask your guys to follow us

334
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,160
as assistance.

335
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:54,590
Yes, yes.

336
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,040
Hold on.

337
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,560
Block the city’s gate.

338
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,430
Block it.

339
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:12,040
Okay.

340
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:14,520
What are you two doing?

341
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:15,310
(West Gate)

342
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:15,940
(West Gate)
Go back.

343
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:17,060
(West Gate)

344
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,560
You.

345
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,110
-Go.
-Go.

346
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,950
Listen up.

347
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:24,000
Nobody comes in or out.

348
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,400
(West Gate)
You, what do you want?

349
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:25,920
I...

350
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,710
Go!

351
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:30,000
Mom.

352
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,640
Hurry and go.

353
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:33,680
Go.

354
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:34,400
Go.

355
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,350
You, come here.

356
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:36,680
Come.

357
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:38,070
Go.

358
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:39,560
Come.

359
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,350
Go.

360
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,280
Hurry.

361
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,630
Looks like they are looking for Chuchu.

362
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:56,890
There’s no way for us to pass.

363
00:23:58,950 --> 00:23:59,830
Hide here now.

364
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:01,110
I’ll go and check.

365
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,500
Get in.

366
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,400
Come on.

367
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:10,520
Don’t be afraid.

368
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,680
Don’t panic.

369
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,950
No matter what happens later,

370
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:23,190
don’t come out.

371
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:25,360
I have to go and see what they’re doing.

372
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:29,880
Though it’s just me,

373
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,470
I’d definitely send you

374
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:31,950
back to the fortress safely.

375
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:32,490
Trust me.

376
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:38,640
From now,

377
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,400
count from one to one hundred.

378
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:41,920
Never mind.

379
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,840
Count to one thousand.

380
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,340
Wait for me.

381
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,590
I know it’s a hard thing to do.

382
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:58,520
But

383
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:00,920
you’re terrific.

384
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,920
Fei.

385
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:05,560
Don’t forget

386
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,350
about my little brother.

387
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:09,920
I’ve promised to send you back.

388
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,520
I’ll fulfill my promise.

389
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,760
Even if I die,

390
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,760
my soul will float back here.

391
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:23,130
Be careful.

392
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:00,960
Blessed Dog?

393
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,350
-Come here.
-Go.

394
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:09,070
-Search this family, too.
-Go.

395
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:10,040
You.

396
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:11,920
What are you doing? Stop there.

397
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,430
Any discovery?

398
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:14,430
No.

399
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,310
Shen Tianshu?

400
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:34,950
Lord.

401
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,350
Yeah?

402
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,230
They said some people escaped.

403
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:40,110
They probably haven’t found

404
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:41,310
what they’re looking for.

405
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,310
It’s just for some old and weak,

406
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:46,400
or some silly kids out there.

407
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,310
No need to make such a fuss.

408
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:50,920
Qiu Tianjin has been lagging behind

409
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:53,520
for all these years.

410
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,560
Blessed Dog thought that we wanted
to take credits from them.

411
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,680
Once we search the east,

412
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,190
they follow us.

413
00:26:58,190 --> 00:26:59,520
It’s troublesome.

414
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,230
They look for those escaped.

415
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:05,800
We look for our important figures.

416
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,010
So Timber Wolf and Blessed Dog...

417
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:07,920
After they search it,

418
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,070
-are not looking for the same person?
-search again.

419
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:11,590
I got it.

420
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:14,280
Hou You.

421
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,710
Take a team to the east side.

422
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,190
You take one to the west.

423
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:19,520
The rest come with me.

424
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,680
Blessed Dog’s people are searching
both the south and north.

425
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,400
Try not to mess with them.

426
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,000
So there’s no trouble.

427
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,470
Yes.

428
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,920
Follow me.

429
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:52,540
Nine hundred.

430
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,680
Nine hundred and one.

431
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,640
Nine hundred and two.

432
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:05,870
Nine hundred and three.

433
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:28,000
It’s me.

434
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:30,230
Fei.

435
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:33,470
Fei.

436
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:34,760
You’re finally back.

437
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:35,900
Change it.

438
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:39,640
It’s from a dead person.

439
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:41,000
It’s not too bad.

440
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,040
Let’s find another place after changed.

441
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:44,110
I’ve checked

442
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,110
inside the county government.

443
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:48,140
There aren’t Demons guarding.

444
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:49,950
But,

445
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:51,170
I’m afraid my disguise
isn’t good enough.

446
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,160
It doesn’t matter.

447
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,660
It’s in darkness everywhere anyway.

448
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,930
But they can still find out
if getting close to us.

449
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,240
How can we get in?

450
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:03,300
We don’t get in.

451
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,110
We fight our way in.

452
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:10,660
(Tea House)

453
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,330
It’ll blow off.

454
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,280
Let’s go.

455
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,930
Lower your head.

456
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:53,400
Have you searched this side?

457
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,070
Stop there.

458
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:12,280
He’s dead?

459
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:14,140
Hide him.

460
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,260
Brother.

461
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:46,020
(Chen Zichen Third Prince)

462
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,430
Zichen.

463
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:49,560
Brother.

464
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,340
What are you doing here?

465
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:52,560
Long story.

466
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,820
Brother, are you okay?

467
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,430
Seeing Mr. Bai show off suddenly,

468
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:59,000
I thought something happened.

469
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,000
I’m relieved to see you’re fine.

470
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:02,640
By the way.

471
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,800
Lend me some good soldiers.

472
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,310
I need to deal with something.

473
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:06,680
I’ll come back to you later.

474
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,590
It’s a mess out there.

475
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:09,190
You can’t go out no matter what.

476
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:10,430
Just hold it for a while.

477
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:12,950
No, I have to.

478
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,400
Is it for your friends
who stayed in the hotel?

479
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:20,160
If you know it, don’t stop me then.

480
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:25,200
Leave it to Mr. Bai to find out.

481
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,770
I’ll update you once there’s news.

482
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,620
The hotel is seriously burned.

483
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:35,840
You’ve got no...

484
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,310
If Mr. Bai comes back with nothing,

485
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,320
you’d only alert the enemy.

486
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,560
What’s the point?

487
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,230
Yeah.

488
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,110
My force is all gone.

489
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:07,730
What can I do?

490
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:26,520
Third Lord.

491
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,230
Many of our guys

492
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:28,640
were murdered.

493
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,310
Two of them lost their clothes

494
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:31,800
and tokens.

495
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,640
One of them

496
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,850
belongs to the Lord.

497
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:48,560
Somebody is protecting

498
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,040
those who escaped.

499
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,230
Third Lord.

500
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:55,190
When the Wu’s come into town,

501
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:57,560
Fortress of the Forty-Eight
protected them.

502
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:01,160
Their leader’s daughter Zhou Fei

503
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,220
was with them, too.

504
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,680
Zhou Fei?

505
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,760
Yes.

506
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,070
I heard that this girl

507
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:16,040
has learned the martial arts
of Li Jinrong.

508
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,370
She’s highly skilled.

509
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,920
It’s not that easy for her

510
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,240
to sneak in and out.

511
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:32,800
In fifteen minutes,

512
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,710
check on all the tokens.

513
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:36,400
Five as a team.

514
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,210
Anyone without a token,

515
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,710
kill him.

516
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:41,440
Yes.

517
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,190
Third Lord.

518
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:46,510
As for the Timber Wolf...

519
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,310
Doesn’t he want to

520
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:50,950
block the city and check with me?

521
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:54,980
I’d like to see

522
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:58,850
what he can find out eventually.

523
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,730
How’s your father?

524
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,650
He’s great. Thanks.

525
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:34,760
But you always

526
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,420
disappear without notice.

527
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:37,730
We all care about you a lot.

528
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,020
Father always talks about you.

529
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,660
It’s my bad.

530
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,430
I’ll make time to visit him.

531
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,470
Brother.

532
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:52,320
How long are you planning

533
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,350
on wandering around?

534
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,290
There’s chaos everywhere.

535
00:34:55,870 --> 00:34:57,360
There’s no one to take care of you.

536
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:06,020
I don’t care about any business
in the court.

537
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:08,670
My life with freedom now

538
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:09,590
suits me well.

539
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:11,710
It’s not a solution.

540
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:12,810
Is living in bad conditions a solution?

541
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,030
Your Highness.

542
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:25,520
Mr. Xiao.

543
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,150
Don’t call me that, Mr. Bai.

544
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:28,770
My name is Xie Yun, now.

545
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:29,930
How are things going on?

546
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:31,140
During the day,

547
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:33,560
Qiu Tianjin brought people to the hotel

548
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,760
to arrest someone for no reason.

549
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:37,670
There were plenty of good fighters,

550
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:39,460
but too many of them came.

551
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:43,280
The fighters could have
fought their way out.

552
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,000
But it’s said there were

553
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,080
women and kids.

554
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,180
They had to return to their rooms
to protect the weak.

555
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,360
Sending people to ask for help
was useless, too.

556
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,000
Qiu Tianjin has asked his fellows

557
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,800
to surround the hotel in advance.

558
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,470
They set a few blocks too

559
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:58,190
to seal the way out.

560
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:00,310
Then set a fire.

561
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:05,860
And then?

562
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,230
This is what the Demons missed

563
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:10,520
in the site.

564
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:32,910
You like blades, don’t you?

565
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:34,800
You can hang this on the hilt.

566
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,120
This is the jade pendant
Chenfei gave to Zhou Fei

567
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,960
when we just arrived at Huarong.

568
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,890
Don’t say that I don’t care about you.

569
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,290
Depends on what you do.

570
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:01,320
Over the wall is the
inside of county government.

571
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,080
I’ve been here at day, there’s no guard.

572
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,430
Only two people are living here.

573
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:06,780
But how can we get in there?

574
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,210
I’ll take you to climb over the wall.

575
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,400
Let’s take off those clothes first.

576
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:27,820
(Huarong County Government)

577
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:32,860
(Impartiality and Integrity)

578
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:45,040
Fei.

579
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,630
We’d be temporarily safe staying here.

580
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:50,080
But people walk by inside.

581
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,280
What if they notice us?

582
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,340
What’s the next step?

583
00:37:56,870 --> 00:37:57,680
Let’s hide for a few days.

584
00:37:58,670 --> 00:37:59,700
Let’s see after that.

585
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:02,280
I’ll take you back
to the fortress after that.

586
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,900
My mother would come to our aid.

587
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,490
Sorry for getting the Fortress involved.

588
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,910
Time for lunch. Come and get the dishes.

589
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:23,560
I’ve asked but you wouldn’t come.

590
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:26,640
Don’t talk back with the master again.

591
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,460
What are you murmuring about?

592
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,840
The pastry you sent was stiff.

593
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,230
Listen carefully.

594
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:34,520
If you don’t do your work well.

595
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,000
I’ll report you.

596
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,630
Who’d believe you?

597
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,970
Our master rarely comes here
for once a year.

598
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,710
Let alone the county leader and madam.

599
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:44,390
Don’t see yourself as a real madam.

600
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:47,150
You stupid.

601
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:48,360
Don’t act like a snob.

602
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,320
What are you talking about?

603
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,080
How dare you!

604
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:50,470
It hurts, it hurts.

605
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,330
Ma... Madam.

606
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:01,600
You again?

607
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:03,920
You got beaten again?

608
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,080
Does it hurt?

609
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,000
-Let me check.
-I’m okay.

610
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,190
It doesn’t hurt. I...

611
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:11,710
I’m going. I’m going.

612
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,660
Madam, are you a cat?

613
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:21,280
You walk so softly without any sound.

614
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:24,380
Let’s go. Time for lunch.

615
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,190
It’s a room piled up with rubbish.

616
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:43,350
Don’t care about it.

617
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:47,930
Let’s go.

618
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:57,870
(Huarong)
The Demons split up into two teams

619
00:39:57,870 --> 00:39:59,560
(Huarong)
to search the city in rows.

620
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:00,520
(Huarong)
Their strongholds

621
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,870
are right here and there.

622
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:03,600
Searching?

623
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,390
Yes.

624
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:06,560
It’s said after they count the people,

625
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:07,950
it’s confirmed some people escaped.

626
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:11,780
Burning the hotel.

627
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,020
Blocking the city.

628
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:14,650
Some escaped.

629
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,130
Mr. Xie, what’s your point?

630
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,210
Please don’t worry.

631
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:28,080
The Demons have lost many fellows.

632
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:28,910
Until now,

633
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:30,900
they haven’t figured out who did it.

634
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,120
There’re fighters

635
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,840
who the Demons don’t even know?

636
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:43,470
I believe that you all remember

637
00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:46,670
there were a group of gangsters here.

638
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:48,150
Now they’re all under control.

639
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,280
Even some of Wu Fei’s evil fellows

640
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:54,080
escaped and remained impenitent.

641
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,120
Why would you arrest me?

642
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,280
-Shut up.
-They joined the gangsters.

643
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:03,470
I believe that you all remember

644
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,870
there were a group of gangsters here.

645
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,560
Now they’re all under control.

646
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,120
Even some of Wu Fei’s evil fellows

647
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:15,870
escaped and remained impenitent.

648
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:18,080
They joined the gangsters.

649
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,040
I wonder

650
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,230
how my little brother is now.

651
00:41:29,870 --> 00:41:31,670
He’s so young.

652
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,760
If anything happens to him,

653
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:38,790
how can I explain to my parents?

654
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,760
There are civilians exiled in Huarong.

655
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:55,470
They don’t know the situation.

656
00:41:55,470 --> 00:41:57,000
After hearing this made-up speech,

657
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,600
they might think it was the people died

658
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,800
in the hotel who ruined their families.

659
00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:03,560
The Demons recklessly burned it all.

660
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,870
Many innocent people died in the hotel.

661
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:07,240
Aren’t they afraid of raising wrath?

662
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:10,390
The Demons are just a bunch of losers.

663
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:13,040
They raised such a rumpus.

664
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:14,560
There must

665
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,170
be a power supporting them behind.

666
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:18,600
Now they’re inciting the people.

667
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:20,630
It’s because there’s a solid proof

668
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:22,140
of the people they wanted have escaped.

669
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:25,320
Searching doesn’t work

670
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,400
anymore at this moment.

671
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:27,990
But how did they

672
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,220
make sure of it?

673
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:32,430
They burned the hotel.

674
00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:33,680
The bodies were scorched.

675
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:36,790
How can they say we are missing?

676
00:42:37,470 --> 00:42:39,430
Qiu Tianjin set the fire,

677
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:41,020
intending to kill them all.

678
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:42,950
It means that

679
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,040
they are not looking for people

680
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,080
but some objects.

681
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,950
The Color of Ocean and Heaven?

682
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:53,840
Do you have something

683
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,490
that your parents asked you to preserve?

684
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:02,480
The missing guy not only has an object

685
00:43:02,910 --> 00:43:03,750
but also a good fighter beside

686
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:06,280
who the Demons didn’t expect.

687
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:08,620
Judged from Chenfei’s personality,

688
00:43:09,470 --> 00:43:12,600
if he did have a chance to save

689
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:14,290
one of them or one of Wu’s children,

690
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:16,430
the one saved must

691
