=Episode 3=

17
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,260
My late father established Fortress of
the Forty-Eight here

18
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:41,170
to provide those who come down

19
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,880
with a place to stay.

20
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:48,000
The Fortress is isolated.

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,590
We have no friends and allies.

22
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,050
The ancestral will shall not
be disobeyed.

23
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,800
You are of no exception.

24
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:25,440
When you step out of the gate tomorrow,

25
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,080
you’ll have nothing to do with
Fortress of the Forty-Eight anymore,

26
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,480
be it dead or not.

27
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:04,640
But you have everything to do with me.

28
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:19,540
(Six Months Later)

29
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,140
Father told me

30
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,830
that only the strong have a choice.

31
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:27,470
Fei.

32
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:30,080
I’ll have to break
Spinning Wire Formation today!

33
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,640
The mountains and waters will never
fade away.

34
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:37,110
Let’s see when you’ll cross them freely.

35
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:59,800
You’d have been a piece
of minced meat now

36
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,110
if I hadn’t turned it off.

37
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,190
But that intruder

38
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:06,200
passed the formation easily, didn’t he?

39
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,330
He was just being good
at the flying skill.

40
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:12,750
Had I been better at the flying skill…

41
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:13,970
It wouldn’t change anything.

42
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,920
You were like a monkey somersaulting.

43
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,760
You think you can just somersault

44
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,720
and break the formation?

45
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,790
Then…

46
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:24,670
Is there any trick to break it?

47
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:27,230
The formation is changing
from time to time,

48
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:28,530
following no law at all.

49
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,200
Living in this world,

50
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,180
you won’t find tricks easily,

51
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,850
nor will you find shortcuts.

52
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,830
But everything follows a certain rule.

53
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:41,060
If you find the rule,

54
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,670
then you’ll be able to break it.

55
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,830
It’s about your brain.

56
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,720
Treat everything with heart.

57
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,720
Calm down.

58
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:55,230
Empty the trivial thoughts in your mind.

59
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:57,800
Close your eyes.

60
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:00,340
Feel things with heart.

61
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:04,930
Then you’ll know where to go next,

62
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,870
what to do,

63
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:09,340
and where

64
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:12,380
you should put your sword.

65
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:15,780
You know what this method is called?

66
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:19,010
“Eye-shutting Skill”.

67
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,200
How’s everything going?

68
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,480
Scouts informed us

69
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,880
that General Wu Fei had been caught.

70
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,860
General Wu Fei used
to be a martial artist,

71
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,460
a fate-sharing friend
of my father-in-law’s.

72
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,230
If Demons didn’t intervene,

73
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:51,320
no one could stop him

74
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:53,620
given his skills and Kungfu.

75
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:57,720
He might not make it through this time.

76
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:05,180
(Demons Manor)

77
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,880
General Wu Fei.

78
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,650
Stop!

79
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:22,060
(Qiu Tianjin, Blessed Dog of Demons
Manor)

80
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,260
(Shen Tianshu, Timber Wolf of Demons Manor)

81
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:34,040
Leave it to me.

82
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:37,000
I don’t think so.

83
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
True that you are the leader of Demons,

84
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,880
but I was the one who caught him.

85
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:45,200
You disagree with a
commander-in-chief?

86
00:06:56,670 --> 00:07:01,230
I can’t believe Demons are now
the henchmen of Yu Wenzhi.

87
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:04,990
Let’s get to the point.

88
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:10,640
Hand out the ripple-shaped thing
you have.

89
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,960
I don’t know what you’re talking about.

90
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:21,020
(To General Wu Fei)

91
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:24,050
These are the letters between you
and Wang Lin.

92
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,750
It is mentioned in these letters

93
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,980
that there’s a ripple-shaped object

94
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,550
and you are the one who’s keeping it.

95
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,580
As long as you hand it out to me…

96
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,720
Don’t you see me as a coward.

97
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:44,230
I heard that Zhou Yitang

98
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:46,110
has helped to transport your family

99
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,090
to the south.

100
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:49,250
But,

101
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,270
do you really think they can escape?

102
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:51,900
You…

103
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,450
Take them here.

104
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:54,810
Honey.

105
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,200
My lord.

106
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:56,880
Honey.

107
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:58,750
I’ll give you one more chance.

108
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,790
Where’s the ripple-shaped object?

109
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:03,350
The kids have all left successfully.

110
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,670
Don’t worry.

111
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:05,910
Don’t you ever tell him.

112
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,390
Honey.

113
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:23,630
Honey.

114
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,960
Honey.

115
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,480
Chuchu, I can’t go any further.

116
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,590
Hang in there.

117
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,480
Chenfei,

118
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:42,260
my little brother is running
out of energy.

119
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:42,860
(Wu Chuchu, General Wu Fei’s Daughter)

120
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,270
(Wu Chuchu, General Wu Fei’s Daughter)
Can we take a break?

121
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:47,550
Are you OK, boy?

122
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:49,150
I’m fine.

123
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,470
Miss Chuchu,

124
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:53,590
how about this?

125
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:55,910
There should be someone coming to
pick us up several feet ahead.

126
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:56,960
Can you carry on for just a while?

127
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,840
OK.

128
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,790
Chuchu.

129
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:01,520
Why aren’t Father and Mother not here
yet for us?

130
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,840
They will come

131
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,780
when we reach the Fortress of
the Forty-Eight.

132
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,180
Don’t worry, General Wu.

133
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:20,960
Your kids…

134
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,110
I’ll take good care of them.

135
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,590
Chuchu, how far are we
from the Fortress?

136
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:30,640
Not far, I think.

137
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,280
Just follow Chenfei.

138
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:39,670
Demons!

139
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,520
Search.

140
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,440
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

141
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:48,020
Qiu Tianjin?

142
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,300
Who is he looking for?

143
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,080
Continue.

144
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,200
Lord,

145
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,150
the two kids of Wu Fei

146
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:21,030
are fleeing towards Jingzhou.

147
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,590
All his letters

148
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:26,550
have been delivered
via Jingzhou as well.

149
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:28,740
This doesn’t seem to be a coincidence.

150
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:32,710
The object we want

151
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,080
is right with the kids.

152
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:45,030
Fortress of the Forty-Eight?

153
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,350
They will encounter Demons, won’t they?

154
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:59,200
I owe them from last time.

155
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:01,950
I should give them some hints.

156
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:09,830
How fast can they flee when they are
with a little kid?

157
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:11,880
My apologies, Lord.

158
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:18,200
You idiot!

159
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:22,350
Seems like they are protected
by the Fortress.

160
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:25,080
We should just go along this path

161
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,060
and send more of our people
to intercept them.

162
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,540
Heaven forbids

163
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,560
if I can’t catch up with them.

164
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,430
Protect Miss Chuchu.

165
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,270
It’s you.

166
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,520
I saw you from afar.

167
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,390
And I guessed that my friends of the
Fortress were in trouble.

168
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,020
How can I help you?

169
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,600
Who’s there?

170
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,790
Sir,

171
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:28,320
all my family members have caught sores

172
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,960
We are heading to Jingzhou
for medication.

173
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:33,920
Look.

174
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:36,540
What the hell is this?

175
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:38,570
You see?

176
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,390
Stop.

177
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:49,840
Bloody sick bastards.

178
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,910
Get out.

179
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,470
Thank… Thank you, sir.

180
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:57,910
Thank you.

181
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,550
-Lord.
-Lord.

182
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,470
We will be reaching the boundary of
Huo’s Manor soon.

183
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,000
The Huos are friends with the Fortress.

184
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,200
If those people enter the Huo’s area

185
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,670
and the latter is determined to
cover them up,

186
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,580
then things will become complicated.

187
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:22,880
Don’t act rashly without my command.

188
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,020
Yes, sir.

189
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,550
You, ask your people to nose around.

190
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:33,110
See if the Timber Wolf has made
any move here.

191
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:33,880
Yes, sir.

192
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,670
Thank you for your rouge, Miss Wu.

193
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:41,670
Otherwise I could not have faked

194
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:42,900
the sores myself.

195
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:44,410
You’re welcome, sir.

196
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,150
We should be the ones to thank you

197
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:47,610
for helping us out.

198
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,550
But this little trick won’t hold them
for long.

199
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,150
You should reach the Fortress

200
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:54,140
without further ado.

201
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,340
Hey, what are you up to

202
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,940
by following us up all the way?

203
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:01,880
I have been a professional kidnaper
for years.

204
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,110
Lord Gantang alone is not enough for me.

205
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,270
That’s why I’m here for you.

206
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:09,390
Who are you?

207
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,640
Excuse me,

208
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,640
are you with the Huo’s Manor?

209
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,730
They are our friends.

210
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,320
Their old master

211
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,130
is a sworn brother of Old Master Li’s.

212
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,080
We are with the Fortress.

213
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,760
Passing by Jingzhou,

214
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,080
I wonder if we can stay in the Manor
for a day or two.

215
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,010
Could you please pass my message?

216
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,420
Friends with the Fortress!

217
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:34,400
Of course we should receive you
in a nice manner.

218
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,030
It happens that the old master just
celebrated his birthday.

219
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:39,040
Many martial artists are still staying
at the Manor.

220
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:41,670
We sincerely invite you to join us
at the party.

221
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:42,390
That will be great.

222
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,530
Mr. Xie,

223
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,000
your help along the way

224
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:47,980
is very much appreciated.

225
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:49,850
As you see,

226
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,280
we are in a safe hand.

227
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:54,520
Since you’re home now,

228
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,160
I should stop from further intervention.

229
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,020
Take care.

230
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:58,500
You’re here.

231
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:09,190
Girl,

232
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,230
today,

233
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:12,880
we’re gonna turn Spinning Wire
into full gear.

234
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:14,590
Be serious.

235
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,590
Did you hear me?

236
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:22,690
Be serious!

237
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,910
Put away the stick.

238
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:26,550
Get a nicer piece of weapon.

239
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:29,420
Fine.

240
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:30,840
OK. OK.

241
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,440
You know-it-all.

242
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,960
Stop it.

243
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,110
The other day

244
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:41,110
the intruder crossed Ximo River
with Spinning Wire at full gear,

245
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:42,360
totally unarmed.

246
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:53,260
Ready.

247
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,680
Bai Neng,

248
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,880
these are from Chenfei

249
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,560
to Aunt, from outside.

250
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,920
Not many of them are left.

251
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,070
See,

252
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:33,260
I’ve managed to keep some for you.

253
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:34,920
Can I

254
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,590
spend some time by the side of
Ximo River?

255
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:39,350
Just for a second.

256
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,120
You can take a look by the cliff.

257
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:44,890
But if you want to go to Ximo River,

258
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,740
you’ll need Leader’s permission.

259
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:49,110
But Fei goes there every day.

260
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,140
Are you discriminating against me?

261
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,040
What’s your problem?
You scared me.

262
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,590
You want to try Ximo River out?

263
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:59,350
I can throw you in it now.

264
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:00,520
Don’t badger the poor man.

265
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,430
What are you doing?

266
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:03,190
Sheng.

267
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:05,000
Sheng, Sheng. Sorry. Sorry.

268
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Forgive me, please.

269
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I’m sorry.

270
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,070
I’m sorry.

271
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:14,040
Stop yelling.

272
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,760
I’m not really going
to throw you into it.

273
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:20,040
What’s that?

274
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,230
Fei?

275
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,480
Sheng, come here.

276
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:40,680
Careful!

277
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,470
Sheng, go save Fei!

278
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:07,160
I… I can’t save her.

279
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,480
Not bad.

280
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:50,110
Aren’t those preserved peaches from
Leader?

281
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:50,940
She was here?

282
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,790
Two days ago.

283
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,000
Too sweet. I don’t like them.

284
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:08,180
What are you doing?

285
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:24,590
You…

286
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,110
What on earth are you doing?

287
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:30,310
Listen to me.

288
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,160
As a person,

289
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,640
you should care about others’ feeling

290
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:36,040
no matter what you’re doing.

291
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,230
For example,

292
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:38,430
you just ate a preserved peach.

293
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:40,350
You had a bite of it,

294
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:42,680
and then you put the rest back.

295
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:45,880
That’s not nice.

296
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,040
It tastes bad.

297
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,880
Then why did you have a bite of it?

298
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,000
How can I know it’s not good
if I don’t try it?

299
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:56,710
Fine. OK.

300
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:58,800
You have come here

301
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,470
not to learn martial arts,

302
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:02,230
but to torture me.

303
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:03,800
Very well.

304
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,520
Now that you’ve broken
the Spinning Wire Formation,

305
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:07,820
you can get out of here.

306
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:09,430
I don’t want to

307
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:10,660
see you again.

308
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:13,510
Get out.

309
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,190
Hey, old man.

310
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,560
Don’t be so mean.

311
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:17,830
Get out. Get out.

312
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:20,430
We’re not friends anymore.

313
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,140
Silly girl.

314
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:27,230
Oh, my.

315
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:31,910
You’ll need your mother to fix you
before you learn how to behave yourself.

316
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:33,950
Mr. Xie is to blame.

317
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:34,760
If he had not come,

318
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,950
then Uncle would not have left.

319
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:36,760
If so,

320
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,230
Fei wouldn’t have been so sad.

321
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:39,950
In the past six months,

322
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:42,040
she has been practicing sword skills
over Ximo River day after day.

323
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,460
We seldom manage to see her.

324
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,650
If he had not come,

325
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:49,400
we wouldn’t have known that

326
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:51,200
there are excellent people like him
in this big world.

327
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:55,610
Time to leave here for the bigger world.

328
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,830
This

329
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:06,090
is where

330
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:08,060
(Blessings)
we test the candidate disciples,

331
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:09,470
(Blessings)
the Flower-Picking Pavilion.

332
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:15,920
You need to get no less than
two paper-cut flowers

333
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,560
within the given time

334
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,400
in order to graduate

335
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,350
and leave the school.

336
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,400
One of the two flowers

337
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,310
must be

338
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:30,400
from that tall timber pile.

339
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,310
Meanwhile, you will have to challenge
one of the chiefs here,

340
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:36,060
who will guard the piles.

341
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:38,230
You can get

342
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:39,590
the other flowers

343
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:41,640
by challenging the elder disciples,

344
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,190
who will be guarding

345
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:44,260
the short piles.

346
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,950
Try to get more flowers.

347
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:47,140
The more, the better.

348
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,110
Disciples of the Fortress,

349
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:50,440
come up to the pavilion.

350
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,590
Sheng always uses double swords.

351
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:04,350
Why does he change to a spear?

352
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:06,040
They’ll use the weapon of the school

353
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,590
they wish to challenge.

354
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,400
They can only

355
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,400
use their own weapon

356
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,860
when trying to get the flower
on the piles.

357
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,760
Skillful.

358
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:00,350
Years ago,

359
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:03,230
Jinfeng got 12 flowers in one shot.

360
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:04,790
(Ms. Wang, An Elder of the Fortress)
Sheng’s spirit

361
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,310
resembles that of his father.

362
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,720
Just like that? Good job.

363
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:28,230
Judging from his performance,

364
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:29,690
I say he’ll get 20.

365
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:31,310
Given the current situation,

366
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:32,410
I say it’s possible.

367
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:34,800
Fei,

368
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,920
see Sheng?

369
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:36,960
How many flowers can you get?

370
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,760
Maybe one.

371
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,520
One?

372
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:45,640
My dear,

373
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,160
if so,

374
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,310
your mother will be more than happy

375
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:51,160
because you’ll spend the rest of
your life studying here.

376
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,600
Exactly, Fei.

377
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:54,910
Then two.

378
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,880
To get the flower on the pile,

379
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,220
I would like to challenge the chief
of Mingfeng Building.

380
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:02,460
(Kou Dan, An Elder of the Fortress)

381
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,430
It’s Spinning Wire.

382
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,110
Thank you for pulling your punches.

383
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,710
Mr. Ma, have a look.

384
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:27,420
See if it’s broken.

385
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,230
If you ask,

386
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:32,640
then it must be very much intact.

387
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,110
Li Sheng gets

388
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:38,830
15 paper-cut flowers.

389
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:45,880
I’ll go straightly to the flowers
on the piles.

390
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:46,800
I would like to challenge

391
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,880
Leader.

392
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:55,100
(Blessings)

393
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:48,100
(Zhao Qiusheng,
An Elder of the Fortress)

394
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:49,160
(Zhang Bolin, An Elder of the Fortress)
The girl is really something.

395
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,350
Exactly.

396
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,680
Fei has got something

397
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,590
similar to Mingfeng.

398
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:56,520
Does it have something to do with
Ximo River?

399
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:59,220
Fei was introduced to the school
by Leader.

400
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,920
How could she learn Mingfeng’s
martial arts?

401
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,640
What a girl, Fei!

402
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,310
She grasped the essence
of Mingfeng Trick

403
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:09,470
and combined it
with her own sword skills.

404
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:11,190
This is the optimal choice of move

405
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,840
to fight against Leader.

406
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:26,360
Fei,

407
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:29,230
your father has a letter for you.

408
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,710
It reads that he wants
to tell you something.

409
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,880
If you can pass Xiushan Hall,

410
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,190
I’ll give you the letter.

411
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:36,590
If you can’t,

412
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:37,680
then you’ll spend the rest of your life

413
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,740
studying here.

414
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:33,880
Snow-breaking Blade?

415
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:39,470
If it’s the real Snow-breaking Blade,

416
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:41,590
it won’t be broken

417
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:42,740
even when you have nothing but
a metal plate.

418
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:47,830
Because

419
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:49,970
it is not a fire that knows no moral.

420
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,110
She did it! Unbelievable.

421
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:28,300
(Blessings)

422
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:51,710
There you go.

423
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:55,110
Fei,

424
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:56,110
you’ve still got much time left.

425
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:57,160
Why do you just come back?

426
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,900
Two will be enough, right?

427
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:01,280
Well, that’s right.

428
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:01,680
But…

429
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,040
Every disciple of the Fortress only has

430
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,450
one chance to be
on the Pavilion in their life.

431
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:08,160
Your result will be recorded
onto Xiushan Hall.

432
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,350
When the future disciples see it,

433
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:11,000
they’ll think you’re bad at martial arts

434
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:11,920
and will laugh at you.

435
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,240
Two will be enough.

436
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,300
No big deal.

437
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,800
About the badge,

438
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,030
I’ll leave it to Mr. Ma.

439
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:28,590
Fei, Sheng,

440
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:30,240
follow me to the Hall of Elders.

441
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,160
Ms. Wang needs you there.

442
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:35,140
(Hall of Elders)

443
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:36,030
Mother,

444
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:39,190
what did Father say in the letter?

445
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:39,880
Listen.

446
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,760
Leader. Sorry for the trouble

447
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,070
caused by my miserable grandson.

448
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:48,180
Ms. Wang, no trouble at all.

449
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,350
Chenfei was running an errand

450
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:51,070
for the Fortress in the first place.

451
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:51,790
What

452
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:53,640
did you ask him to do?

453
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:58,040
A while ago, your father told us that
some distinguished guests were coming,

454
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:00,100
and that we should pick the guests up.

455
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:03,430
Chenfei wanted to see the world

456
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:04,980
so he volunteered to take the job.

457
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:08,540
Last month, he told us
that he had arrived

458
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,430
but that was the last time we heard
from him.

459
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,040
Chenfei is good at martial arts

460
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,280
but even he was put into danger.

461
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:18,950
Shouldn’t we

462
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:20,540
send more skillful experts to him?

463
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:23,230
I wonder how distinguished
the guests are

464
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:25,110
to make such a fuss

465
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:26,830
out of a simple action of picking-up.

466
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:27,360
Mind your words.

467
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:31,530
I will leave this place

468
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,860
to figure things out in person.

469
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,520
Fei, Sheng,

470
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:48,310
look carefully.

471
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:49,920
The distinguished guests mentioned

472
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,400
are the family members of General Wu.

473
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:54,840
General Wu was persecuted by
the invaders from the North.

474
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:57,460
His son and daughter
are now homeless.

475
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:58,880
Your father felt sympathetic

476
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,040
and turned to me for help.

477
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,310
We sent 13 people from the Fortress

478
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:03,370
to pick them up

479
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,850
but we’ve not heard
from them ever since.

480
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,400
With the bunches of bandits out there,

481
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,660
travels are already treacherous enough.

482
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:13,950
Let alone they have two kids with them.

483
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:16,040
Maybe they had to slow down.

484
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,620
They must be already close
to this place.

485
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,060
If you feel worried,

486
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:21,950
bring some people with you to
pick them up.

487
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:27,510
You two shouldn’t have come,

488
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:29,830
but I was so shameless

489
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:30,880
that I begged Ms. Wang

490
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,610
to bring you along to see the world.

491
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,520
When you are out there,

492
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,430
don’t try to be smart

493
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:39,520
and mess around.

494
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:41,920
Otherwise I’ll beat you up.

495
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,230
Just now,

496
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:49,760
you didn’t show fear

497
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,040
when you knew your sword would
be broken.

498
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,780
Because you knew I wouldn’t hurt you.

499
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,590
This is not Snow-breaking Blade.

500
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:57,630
It’s a trick.

501
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:03,750
But a trick requires wisdom.

502
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,710
It’s working

503
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:08,320
if it helps you reach the goal.

504
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,350
Did you just praise me?

505
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,600
When you are at a real fight,

506
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,780
you can’t help showing fear

507
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:17,080
if you know the sword will be broken.

508
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:19,940
Don’t deny that.

509
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:21,370
Death is fearful to all.

510
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,520
Fear, however subtle it is,

511
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,500
is fear anyway.

512
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,560
But no matter what I think about,

513
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,320
the sword will be broken anyway, right?

514
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,520
Are you saying

515
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,760
that Snow-breaking Blade is
a set of techniques

516
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:35,150
that tells people to be overconfident?

517
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,000
To be all-conquering.

518
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:43,340
Fei,

519
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,870
you know how many experts

520
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:48,120
are out there in this world?

521
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:49,660
Countless.

522
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:50,980
Right.

523
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,740
Countless.

524
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,570
There’s always someone better.

525
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,600
No one dares to claim to be No.1.

526
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:00,340
But everyone is given birth

527
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:02,120
by their parents.

528
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:03,940
They are made of flesh and blood.

529
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:06,600
They all started from babbling,

530
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,530
and tottering.

531
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:10,410
The current grit

532
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,640
is the future mountain.

533
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,350
Your present is our history.

534
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:18,600
Fei,

535
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,430
the immortals are beyond our discussion.

536
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:22,040
Every person in the world

537
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,870
is mortal.

538
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:25,670
Why can’t you believe

539
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:27,880
that the blade you have is invincible?

540
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:32,620
Look carefully.

541
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:34,570
I’ll only teach you once.

542
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,150
There are nine moves for
Snow-breaking Blade.

543
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:48,560
Your grandfather compiled it in person.

544
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,030
It is extremely aggressive.

545
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:00,140
Mr. Yutai.

546
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:02,190
Stop.

547
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:03,640
Get away from me.

548
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:10,560
You always call me “terrible old man”.

549
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,910
And just now you called me Mr. Yutai?

550
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:15,150
Are you after something?

551
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:16,800
How can that be?

552
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,000
I don’t call you Mr. Yutai every day.

553
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,520
You should’ve just enjoyed it.

554
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:23,000
Don’t tell me you prefer
“terrible old man”.

555
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:26,670
That sounds more like it.

556
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:28,390
I can rest assured now.

557
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:29,610
Have a seat. Come here.

558
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:36,470
Wait a minute.

559
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,080
Comfy, comfy.

560
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,950
What’s wrong?

561
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,630
I’m going out.

562
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:54,410
Good.

563
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:01,200
You?

564
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,270
You?

565
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,070
You’ve passed Xiushan Hall?

566
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:10,100
Good job.

567
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:13,730
Come.

568
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,320
Brag it to me.

569
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,150
Which chief

570
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:20,370
did you defeat today?

571
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:23,000
Leader.

572
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:31,980
Well done, you!

573
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:35,840
There you go. Have some tea.

574
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:40,200
Did she pull her punches?

575
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,980
I think so.

576
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:55,600
Mother passed Snow-breaking Blade

577
00:38:57,230 --> 00:38:58,020
on to me.

578
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,190
What kind of heroine

579
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:07,150
would you like to become?

580
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:15,040
I don’t want to be a heroine.

581
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,670
To me,

582
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:18,710
being a heroine

583
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:20,150
is not about

584
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:22,150
how many people

585
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:23,950
she has defeated

586
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:25,720
or killed throughout her life.

587
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,430
It’s about

588
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:28,780
how many people

589
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:31,760
she’s helped

590
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,360
or saved in this world.

591
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,500
So that she won’t become those who

592
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,500
become bullies

593
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:40,620
after gaining a little bit
of skills and powers.

594
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,420
But don’t worry,

595
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,020
in this world,

596
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,600
people like them

597
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:50,320
will lose

598
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,060
the hell out of them someday.

599
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,940
Years ago, Mingfeng Building

600
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,430
sold information for living.

601
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:05,320
We’ve made ourselves enemy to
too many people.

602
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:12,190
At the end, Demons

603
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,000
drove us up to the wall.

604
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:27,420
(Hu Tianying, Pathetic Clam of
Demons Manor)

605
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,750
Bone-chilling is not an average poison.

606
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:42,120
If you are poisoned by it,

607
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:44,600
you’ll soon turn stiff and die.

608
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,840
Just wait for the call.

609
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:50,230
They are just a bundle
of merciless spies.

610
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:51,320
Cut the crap.

611
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:51,940
(Lu Tiankuang, Hearing Ox of Demons Manor)
Just kill him.

612
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:52,300
(Lu Tiankuang, Hearing Ox of Demons Manor)

613
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:53,810
At that moment,

614
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:56,170
someone showed up.

615
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:25,800
That was

616
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:28,090
your grandfather.

617
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:31,800
(Li Zheng, Founder of Fortress)
I am Li Zheng.

618
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:33,060
(Li Zheng, Founder of Fortress)

619
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:50,150
You are
at Fortress of the Forty-Eight now.

620
00:41:51,870 --> 00:41:53,420
You’ve had some Reborn Pills

621
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,680
and have been detoxicated.

622
00:41:57,470 --> 00:41:59,600
You won’t be in danger

623
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,100
as long as you never leave a damp place

624
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:03,800
