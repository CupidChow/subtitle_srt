=Episode 6=

17
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,900
So, I sang it

18
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,440
completely wrong

19
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,170
from the very beginning.

20
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:55,860
Winter comes again at home.

21
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,020
Winter comes again

22
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,240
at home.

23
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,670
I have performed Crying for so long

24
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,540
but it is completely wrong.

25
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,960
What’s up?

26
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:22,080
Is he possessed?

27
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,360
Winter comes again at home.

28
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,780
Leave him alone. Let’s go right away.

29
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:27,460
Go, go, go.

30
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,160
Winter comes again at home.

31
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,360
I injured Mu Xiaoqiao seriously.

32
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,680
It is enough for you

33
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,160
to go to Huo’s Manor.

34
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,190
Remember,

35
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,160
don’t alert them.

36
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,080
Okay.

37
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,360
If you get any message,

38
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,760
come to Huarong and report.

39
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:49,440
Huarong?

40
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:56,000
Look, safe and sound, right?

41
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,750
Come on,

42
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,960
if you have any problem,

43
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,800
how can I excuse myself with our leader?

44
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,520
Enough.

45
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,550
It is very faraway here.

46
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:04,670
It must be safe.

47
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:07,880
Chenfei,

48
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,630
we are all poisoned now.

49
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:11,270
I suggest we take a rest here

50
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:12,630
and set out tomorrow.

51
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:17,830
It is just one day’s walk

52
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:19,520
to the nearest Huarong.

53
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,800
Why not take a rest there

54
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,270
and contact with our family and friends?

55
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,410
Good idea.

56
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:25,600
Fei,

57
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,270
come with me.

58
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:30,430
Let’s talk about the affairs
between you and Li Sheng.

59
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:37,960
Go.

60
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,960
I didn’t mean to ask for your opinions.

61
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,630
It is none of my business, Chenfei.

62
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:03,240
It is Li Sheng’s fault.

63
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,800
He wanted to leave home half a year ago.

64
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,360
He must have planned it for long.

65
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,750
After I get him back,

66
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,630
my mother won’t be able to
find an excuse for him.

67
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,960
Both of you

68
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,270
have been troublemakers since childhood.

69
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:20,390
I have told you everything.

70
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:21,480
You have to handle it all

71
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,830
from now on.

72
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:26,950
Are you going to dump it on me again?

73
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,110
Fei,

74
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,600
go check on Miss Wu.

75
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,160
I don’t think

76
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,270
she feels good after all the troubles

77
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:36,480
along the way.

78
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,390
Why not go and have a talk with her?

79
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:40,120
Me?

80
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,320
What can I talk to her?

81
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:44,710
Well…

82
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:47,000
You are girls.

83
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
As a man,

84
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,720
how can I know
what you should talk with her?

85
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,440
Find a topic. Hurry up.

86
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,400
Hurry up, go!

87
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:57,550
Fei!

88
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,200
What is this?

89
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,230
Little wooden knife?

90
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:02,600
You are too old for this!

91
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:04,110
If you really like it,

92
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:05,040
I will find a real one for you

93
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,270
in Huarong tomorrow.

94
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,200
You don’t have to.

95
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,400
It is for you.

96
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,170
Why did you give me this?

97
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:19,360
What is the use of it for me?

98
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,160
Hey…

99
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,840
Chenfei asked me to talk to you.

100
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,110
May I know

101
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:10,910
your name?

102
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,070
My name is Chuchu.

103
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:21,320
I am Zhou Fei.

104
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,720
Just call me Fei.

105
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,320
Fei.

106
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:31,130
Where is your younger brother?

107
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:33,790
He is having a rest now.

108
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:36,950
Mr. Xie found such a quiet place for us.

109
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:38,490
Please express my thanks to him for me.

110
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,040
You are welcome.

111
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:43,200
He loves quiet things

112
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,230
like these.

113
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:45,900
Fei,

114
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:48,900
are you an acquaintance of Mr. Xie?

115
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,270
I met him some time ago.

116
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:53,250
It is the second time for me to see him.

117
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,920
As the old saying goes,

118
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,830
some people remain strangers even if
they have known each other for long;

119
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,510
some people are old acquaintances
even if they have just met each other.

120
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:03,400
Do you mean

121
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,280
we share the same rotten tastes?

122
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,510
No.

123
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:23,320
My father put this lock
on me personally.

124
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,440
When I was young,

125
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,200
they said I was destined
to die young and

126
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,720
needed something
to counter the ill fate.

127
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:29,270
I shouldn’t take it off

128
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:30,720
before marriage.

129
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,260
What is this?

130
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:03,220
It is a gift from others.

131
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:05,640
It isn’t easy to carry,
nor can I throw it away.

132
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:08,670
It is easier to wear it this way.

133
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:17,880
Do you know

134
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,200
any pendant on a girl’s neck

135
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,210
is certainly…

136
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:23,030
What?

137
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:24,910
Don’t you wear it, too?

138
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:27,600
Mine is different.

139
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,960
It is a gift from my parents.

140
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:30,920
It doesn’t matter.

141
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,150
Just wear it

142
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,030
if you like it.

143
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,670
Chenfei said

144
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:43,270
it wasn’t easy for you
all the way along.

145
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:48,000
It doesn’t matter.

146
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,030
When you reach my home,

147
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,400
you won’t feel scared anymore.

148
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,080
Your home?

149
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,520
Fortress of the Forty-Eight?

150
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,910
What is it like there?

151
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,880
There…

152
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,200
I believe it is the happiest

153
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,120
and the best place there.

154
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,200
It is beyond my words.

155
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,470
You will know it when you get there.

156
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:10,110
How is your family?

157
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:11,800
My family…

158
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:15,550
My family…

159
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:20,930
My father

160
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,920
is a sick person.

161
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:25,680
My mother is a tigress.

162
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:28,110
My elderly male cousin
is a troublemaker.

163
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:29,880
My younger female cousin
is a silly girl.

164
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:31,760
But they

165
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,690
all have their strong suits.

166
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,710
For instance, my younger female cousin

167
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:37,690
never stops crying easily.

168
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,670
Even my stringent mother

169
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:40,550
is incredibly amicable

170
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:41,890
to her.

171
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,280
It is enough to have just

172
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,410
a handful of people like her.

173
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:49,210
Wherever there is a fighting,

174
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:51,640
just dispatch them there

175
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,200
and the two opposite rivals

176
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:56,470
will become pacified right away.

177
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,270
May I learn martial arts

178
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:01,200
after arriving at your home?

179
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,780
I can protect myself
in the future if so.

180
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:08,530
It seems impossible.

181
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:11,220
I know you started
to learn it as a child.

182
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,770
I am afraid I am too old for it.

183
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:15,830
Not at all.

184
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:17,350
You may not be comparable

185
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,470
with those who start
to learn it as a child.

186
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:20,470
But

187
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:21,740
you will at least be stronger than now.

188
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,640
My mother is a topnotch martial artist
at the Fortress.

189
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,640
But she is too busy normally.

190
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:28,990
Moreover,

191
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:31,330
she is a tough lady.

192
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:36,600
I recommend Ms. Wang.

193
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,710
She is kind and good-tempered.

194
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,090
She must wish to teach you.

195
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,550
She is maternal great grandmother

196
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:45,400
of Chenfei
who has escorted you all the way along.

197
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,470
Run slowly.

198
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,200
I am

199
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,590
an accurate stargazer.

200
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:23,960
Look, we have escaped smoothly.

201
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,910
Your definition of “smoothly”

202
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:26,840
must be different

203
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,080
from what it means usually.

204
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,320
Don’t be too demanding.

205
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,760
Look,

206
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,320
isn’t it good

207
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:36,350
to live healthily,

208
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:38,230
have full limbs,

209
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:40,280
eat and drink well

210
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,910
and go wherever you like to go?

211
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,880
It has nothing to do with you.

212
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:46,230
If I had followed your advice,

213
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:48,200
I would have fled at the very beginning.

214
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:50,470
It is a wise decision to flee then.

215
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:51,880
As I told you,

216
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,670
there must be some incidents soon.

217
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:56,350
If you had left as I had told you,

218
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:58,550
you wouldn’t have met
Shen Tianshu and others.

219
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,350
Although I would

220
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:05,350
have died earlier in that case,

221
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,710
it would be

222
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:09,840
a great merit on my part

223
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,910
to see a flower in blossom there.

224
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,740
I am too short

225
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:21,800
to be the flower in the tree.

226
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,070
Are you so petty?

227
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:32,760
Although the flower

228
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,860
is gone now,

229
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:37,110
I still have an imprudent bosom friend.

230
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:41,200
As the old saying goes,

231
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:43,260
it is much easier to get money

232
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:45,640
than a bosom friend.

233
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:47,910
It is still a good bargain for me.

234
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,470
Fei!

235
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,910
Meal time now!

236
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:38,110
Come on, sit here.

237
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,230
Fei, have some fish.

238
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:48,280
Wait, wait, wait!

239
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,370
Sit here, Fei.

240
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:52,110
Come and sit here.

241
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:54,470
I will have a good talk with Xie.

242
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:57,320
Okay? Come here.

243
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,350
Xie!

244
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:04,840
Come on, eat something.

245
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:06,200
Thanks.

246
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,800
Come on, Fei, have this.

247
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,170
I have a question.

248
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:17,200
It is great luck that

249
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:19,150
we survived this battle
between Demons Manor and Phoenix.

250
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,710
I wonder if there will be

251
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:21,820
another disaster in the future.

252
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:23,890
You have a point.

253
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:26,790
What disaster

254
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:29,110
do you think we will encounter?

255
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:32,880
Huo’s Manor.

256
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,620
Exactly!

257
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:39,080
Demons come ferociously

258
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:39,970
and kill everybody in the way.

259
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:41,960
They want to kill Phoenix

260
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,280
certainly not for justice.

261
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,320
Only Huo’s Manor

262
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,790
deserves the personal trip

263
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:49,030
of Timber Wolf.

264
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:51,470
Listen,

265
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:52,280
Xie.

266
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,030
Thank you for your help this time.

267
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:56,370
I owe you my life.

268
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,320
May I know

269
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,640
your master?

270
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,440
Sure.

271
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,030
I am just a sword maker.

272
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:05,840
I came to Huo’s Manor with my employer

273
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,910
but suffered this disaster accidently.

274
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,790
Sword maker?

275
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,470
It is just a way to make a living.

276
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:15,760
I have just changed my trade.

277
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,320
What is your previous trade then?

278
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:19,910
I used to be

279
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:21,990
a song writer.

280
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:23,990
Frankly,

281
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,910
the song sung by Phoenix

282
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:28,280
was composed by me.

283
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,760
Its name is

284
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,350
Departure Sorrow Pavilion.

285
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:37,230
It includes

286
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:38,280
nine chapters.

287
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,110
The Crying performed by him

288
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:40,320
is one of the chapters.

289
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,110
As one of my best works,

290
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,280
it used to be highly popular.

291
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,840
People of all ranks, from famous singers

292
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,470
to street performers,

293
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:51,760
can sing my song

294
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,080
in order to gain customers’ favor.

295
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:57,590
That sounds really marvelous!

296
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:58,820
Of course!

297
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:02,590
Xie!

298
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:05,120
Departure Sorrow Pavilion

299
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:07,160
was composed by Qian Suiyou,

300
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:08,350
wasn’t it?

301
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,880
But it is said

302
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:14,790
Qian Suiyou is a pretty girl.

303
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:15,500
But you…

304
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:19,160
I am good-looking indeed.

305
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:20,150
But I am absolutely

306
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:20,860
not a girl.

307
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:22,710
Some people even said

308
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:23,670
Qian Suiyou was an old man.

309
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:36,520

Qian Suiyou,

317
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:17,160
I didn’t expect to meet you here.

318
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:20,190
-I like you so much.
-Great!

319
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:21,280
I like you.

320
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,050
Chenfei!

321
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:24,510
Where did you hear this song?

322
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:40,990
Fei!

323
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:42,830
It is yours.

324
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:48,770
Fei!

325
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:58,490
Fei!

326
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:05,010
What are you doing?

327
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:08,060
What were you thinking about?
You just forgot yourself.

328
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:13,610
I wonder

329
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,760
when I can be strong enough

330
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,120
to battle against

331
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,560
either Demons or Phoenix,

332
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,560
like my mother.

333
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:30,710
It will come true one day.

334
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,210
You are the successor to South Blade
anyway.

335
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:34,900
No kidding.

336
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,070
When my mother was at my age,

337
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:39,050
she was already the leader
of Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

338
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:43,020
Her nine moves of Snow-breaking Blade
was invincible indeed.

339
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:44,340
Just think about me.

340
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,310
What can I do now?

341
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:52,310
People have

342
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:53,880
different life experiences

343
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,430
and different opportunities.

344
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:58,430
You have just started your career.

345
00:18:58,430 --> 00:18:59,680
It is just a matter of time and chance

346
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,190
to be a lady like your mother.

347
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,870
Do you feel embarrassed

348
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:15,400
about the battle today?

349
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:18,180
Yes.

350
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:22,160
We have just left home

351
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,190
and we can move freely
in and out of the entrance.

352
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:25,800
But I’ll leave the sect someday.

353
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:33,190
Witnessing the battle between
Shen Tianshu and Mu Xiaoqiao,

354
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:35,200
I finally got the meaning
of a real master.

355
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:39,050
I am a far cry from the master

356
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,540
that my father told me.

357
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,150
I think

358
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,010
a free strong will

359
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,480
originates from heart

360
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:54,040
instead of civil

361
00:19:59,070 --> 00:19:59,870
or martial virtues.

362
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,310
Of course,

363
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:09,440
you must firstly have
self-defense ability

364
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:12,470
against all the chaos
in the world of martial arts

365
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,010
before you can protect others.

366
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,690
The greater martial arts you have,
the better.

367
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,390
I think you are…

368
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:32,170
so much like my father.

369
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:35,880
Lord Gantang?

370
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,370
With excellent literary talents

371
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,190
and profound knowledge?

372
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,380
Nagging!

373
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:52,110
Okay, it is late.

374
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:52,790
Have a rest.

375
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,590
Thanks to brothers of
Fortress of the Forty-Eight for rescue.

376
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:41,710
I owe you my life
and I will pay you back in the future.

377
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:43,560
Chief Qin, you are welcome.

378
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,520
Dear brothers,

379
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,100
things won’t change despite time.

380
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:49,810
See you in the world
of martial arts again. Good-bye.

381
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:50,710
Good-bye.

382
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,420
Miss Zhou,

383
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,200
I have something to talk to you.

384
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,420
Sir, what are you doing?

385
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:12,560
I am from the Qi School

386
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,310
and my Taoist name is Chongxiaozi.

387
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:16,400
Sorry for what I did just now.

388
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:18,830
Mr. Chongxiao,

389
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,160
what are you going to…?

390
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,350
Have you received any education?

391
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:27,070
I used to receive some education.

392
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:28,950
I have almost forgotten what I learned

393
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:30,180
but I can still read.

394
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:32,590
I have nothing special on me.

395
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:34,830
But they haven’t taken one thing
from me.

396
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,870
I think you have great intelligence.

397
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,850
So please accept this gift
upon departure.

398
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:43,040
Departure?

399
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,350
Sir!

400
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:45,590
See you!

401
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,200
See you, sir!

402
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,700
Thank you for your book.

403
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:01,310
This old Taoist is really a strange guy.

404
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:02,350
He has excellent martial arts which are

405
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:04,520
comparable with my grandmother.

406
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,040
I just don’t understand

407
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:06,950
why he

408
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:08,880
was put in the dungeon with us.

409
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,700
I am afraid he was

410
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,970
intentionally caught
and put in the dungeon.

411
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:13,520
Intentionally?

412
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,190
Do you want to know the secrets

413
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:16,520
behind it?

414
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,520
He must be heading towards

415
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,470
Huo’s Manor now.

416
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:25,590
Why is he going there again
since he has just returned from there?

417
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:27,760
I think he has gone there

418
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,560
as he is afraid
Huo’s Manor may be in danger.

419
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,590
Many people here

420
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:35,040
have been detained by Mu Xiaoqiao
because of Huo’s Manor.

421
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:36,880
He is a great martial artist.

422
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,110
But Huo’s Manor

423
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:39,560
has numerous people.

424
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,670
Will he be in danger?

425
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,280
Mr. Chongxiao is a great master

426
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,280
and has everything under control.

427
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:45,980
Okay,

428
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,740
forget it.

429
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,230
Keep it carefully.

430
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:53,070
Am I too ignorant?

431
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:55,050
Mr. Chongxiao gave me a book
as a gift upon departure.

432
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,330
What is the use of Tao Teh King?

433
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:02,560
Being ignorant isn’t a big deal.

434
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,110
What really matters is self-awareness.

435
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:05,310
Nonsense!

436
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:08,230
Miss Chuchu,

437
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:09,680
well…

438
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,070
Huarong isn’t far away from here.

439
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:13,190
Why not rush over there and have a rest?

440
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:14,950
Let’s set out.

441
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:16,190
Okay.

442
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:18,590
How about you?

443
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:21,160
I am used to roaming

444
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:21,950
with no plan.

445
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,770
I have a good idea.

446
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,470
Xie,

447
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:29,230
I suggest

448
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:30,660
you go to Huarong with us. Alright?

449
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:36,880
Okay,

450
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,650
thank you for your invitation.

451
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:41,920
But I wonder

452
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,220
if Miss Zhou is fed up with my babbling.

453
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,880
It is okay with me. I am used to it.

454
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,430
I don’t mind having a chatterbox
with me.

455
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:53,980
How can you say that, Fei?

456
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,350
She is always like this.

457
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:59,310
On the way, we can talk about…

458
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:00,310
Qian Suiyou!

459
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:02,160
Exactly! Okay?

460
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,520
(Huarong)

461
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,470
Good!

462
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:07,690
Flower umbrella.

463
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:09,680
Good!

464
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:11,320
Flower umbrella.

465
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:12,680
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

466
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,760
Good!

467
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:17,520
-Please!
-Please!

468
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,350
Give me some food.

469
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:21,590
It is strange

470
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:23,520
why there are so many migrants

471
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,900
among the crowd.

472
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,910
Has anything happened unexpectedly

473
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,820
other than the misconducts
of Huo’s Manor?

474
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:35,800
Boss!

475
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:36,800
What would you like?

476
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,800
Give me some pancakes.

477
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:38,580
Okay.

478
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:40,960
Come on, here you are.

479
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:44,880
Mr. Xie.

480
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,950
Thanks.

481
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,250
Miss Chuchu.

482
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:51,180
Come on, here you are.

483
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,270
What’s up, Fei?

484
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:04,950
I wonder

485
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,070
if Li Sheng the scamp

486
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:08,310
has returned.

487
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,470
If I encounter him again,

488
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:14,400
I will tie him up and deliver him back
to Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

489
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:22,540
(Fortress of the Forty-Eight)

490
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:24,230
(Insightful and Open-minded)

491
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:27,350
Ma’am, this is my report for you.

492
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,200
I shouldn’t have allowed

493
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:31,470
the two troublemakers
to leave the Fortress.

494
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,000
Ma’am,

495
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,620
just take it easy.

496
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:41,880
Fei and Sheng

497
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,190
have excellent martial arts

498
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:44,650
among their peers.

499
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,280
I think they
are still adapting themselves

500
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,680
to the new world around them

501
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,720
as it is their first trip outside.

502
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:52,710
Maybe Ms. Wang

503
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:54,830
has found them both.

504
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:57,940
Notify our secret agents near Jingzhou
to assist in the search.

505
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:00,450
I will punish them seriously

506
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:02,650
when they are back.

507
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:04,140
Yes.

508
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,360
Your generation

509
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:11,310
is actually

510
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:12,800
well protected

511
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,520
by the leader.

512
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:16,950
But

513
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:18,520
it is never so easy as you imagine

514
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:21,410
to make a career in the world
of martial arts.

515
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,070
Actually,

516
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:28,520
you are making competitions
with Fei inside.

517
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:30,700
I…

518
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:32,230
Tell me,

519
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:33,830
would you still run away

520
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:35,760
if you were chased

521
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,190
by other brothers that day?

522
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,560
Maybe I haven’t reached

523
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,620
the level you said.

524
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,140
I know.

525
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:46,620
My aunt thinks that she owes me

526
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,400
for my father’s death.

527
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,170
Frankly,

528
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:51,690
I blame Fei.

529
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:54,920
But after I grow up

530
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,020
and become more reasonable,

531
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:57,780
I don’t hate Fei anymore

532
00:28:58,590 --> 00:28:59,900
actually.

533
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,000
You are cousins.

534
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,020
There shouldn’t be any hatred
between you.

535
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,130
But what I just can’t tolerate is that

536
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:10,030
Fei’s moderation

537
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:11,830
to me

538
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:12,950
for my father

539
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:14,640
is actually a contempt of me.

540
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,470
She always complains about
Aunt’s favor for me.

541
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:17,880
Is that really kind of favor for me?

542
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,560
Has she taught me
the Snow-breaking Blade?

543
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:23,560
Leader will teach you sooner or later.

544
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,460
Come on,

545
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:27,470
you are the elderly cousin.

546
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:28,820
You shouldn’t envy your cousin,
should you?

547
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:30,710
Moreover,

548
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,640
the Fortress

549
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,560
will be passed down to you
in the future.

550
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,000
Hey, check this one.

551
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Do you like it?

552
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:41,880
Chuchu.

553
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,920
Fei.

554
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,230
What are you checking now?

555
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:46,590
Nothing special.

556
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:48,000
Where is Chenfei?

557
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,230
He is over there.

558
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,350
Let’s go.

559
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,400
They are all so beautiful!

560
00:29:58,230 --> 00:29:59,430
Which one do you want?

561
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:00,000
I want to have them all.

562
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,350
Chenfei!

563
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:02,350
What are you looking at?

564
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:03,560
You have come just in time.

565
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,520
Help me check

566
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,920
which one is more beautiful.

567
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:09,680
Chenfei,

568
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,470
do you plan to give it

569
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:11,710
to a girl as a gift?

570
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:14,590
Actually, I plan to give it

571
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:16,470
to my fiancée.

572
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:18,520
Are you going to be married?

573
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,950
Congratulations!

574
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:20,800
Thanks, thanks!

575
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,190
Congratulations, Chenfei!

576
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:24,050
No more congratulations.
Just pick the right one for me.

577
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,190
Can you find the difference?

578
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,230
Yeah,

579
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:35,620
I know it is useless to ask you.

580
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,680
I suggest

581
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,040
you buy this one.

582
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:44,230
I think

583
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:46,520
all of us at the Fortress
are martial artists.

584
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,760
This one

585
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,790
looks modest

586
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:51,590
with delicate details.

587
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:53,520
I wonder if Chenfei’s fiancée

588
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,510
would like it.

589
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:56,390
Let me check it carefully.

590
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:03,520
It is a good one.

591
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,350
Chuchu really has a good eye.

592
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:10,170
Okay, this is the right one.

593
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:12,920
Boss,

594
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:14,350
also this one.

595
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:15,040
Okay.

596
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:15,800
How much?

597
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,560
Ten bucks in total.

598
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,560
Come on, here you are.

599
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,070
Okay, here you are.

600
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:20,680
Thanks.

601
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,470
Fei,

602
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:25,100
this is for you.

603
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:27,830
I know you like blades.

604
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:29,210
You can hang it on the handle.

605
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,640
Because I hope to be your good brother.

606
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,770
It depends on your performances.

607
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,700
Treat me better in the future.

608
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:44,620
(Huarong Inn)

609
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:53,260
(Huarong Inn)

610
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:03,350
(Huarong Inn)
Long time no see.

611
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:04,120
(Huarong Inn)
How are you?

612
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:04,620
(Huarong Inn)

613
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:06,950
Dear all,

614
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:07,720
this way, please.

615
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:17,670
Fei,

616
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:20,900
can you be my master?

617
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,760
I can teach you every day

618
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:24,890
after we return to the Fortress.

619
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,390
Boy,

620
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,920
this lady is a tough girl.

621
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:30,850
I hope you won’t…

622
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:33,010
Look,

623
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:34,720
she never hesitates to bully others.

624
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:36,040
Ouch!

625
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:37,880
I won’t cry

626
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,220
because I am a man.

627
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:47,170
Okay, okay.

628
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:49,320
You are already a man.

629
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:52,490
Dear all,

630
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:54,870
the guestrooms are ready
on the second floor.

631
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:57,310
Take the guests upstairs for a rest.

632
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:57,820
Yes.

633
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,880
This way, please.

634
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:03,940
Please.

635
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,980
(Liquor)

636
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,160
I will prepare

637
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,760
carriages for you.

638
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:15,370
Xie,

639
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:16,950
frankly,

640
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:18,190
this inn

641
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:19,520
is our secret station.

642
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,070
It has done a good job.

643
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:22,700
I see.

644
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,800
I don’t think Huarong is safe enough.

645
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,000
After the preparations,

646
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:27,700
let’s set out as soon as possible.

647
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,350
Let go of me.

648
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:32,800
Come here.

649
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:43,430
Let go.

650
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:47,470
How dare

651
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:48,520
you rascal do this

652
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,630
in public!

653
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:51,800
Fei,

654
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,000
don’t make things worse.

655
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,470
Give him to me. I will drive him away.

656
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:55,830
Do you know who I am?

657
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,230
Give some convenience, bro.

658
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:01,830
Just calm down.

659
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:02,680
I suggest

660
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,960
both of you make a compromise.

661
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,600
It is no use talking
to such a rascal.

662
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,560
I will punish him.

663
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,120
Wait, stop.

664
00:34:13,390 --> 00:34:13,840
Let go of him.

665
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,280
Wait, wait.

666
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,360
Are you of the same gang?

667
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,080
Dear all,

668
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,800
he is the son of Governor Zhu.

669
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:21,800
Can the son of the county governor
do anything he wants?

670
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,080
Isn’t there any rule of law?

671
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,950
I am the law.

672
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:28,630
You are really strong

673
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:30,360
and pretty.

674
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,800
Let go of me.

675
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,360
We can have a good chat.

676
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,600
She is really pretty.

677
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,150
You have a good eye indeed.

678
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,470
Calm down, calm down.

679
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:47,520
Please calm down first.

680
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:52,060
Calm down, calm down.

681
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,360
Are you okay?

682
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,280
Never mind.

683
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,710
I am not familiar with them.

684
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:03,670
Sir,

685
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:05,700
I don’t think you have seen
the real beauty.

686
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:07,670
I have

687
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:09,370
pretty girls from Wangchun Brothel.

688
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:10,960
Do you have any interest?

689
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:12,920
Go.

690
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:23,520
Let’s meet at

691
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,160
Long Time No See Winery.

692
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:37,000
Go and get him.

693
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,360
Don’t let them go away.

694
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,840
Don’t let them go away.

695
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:47,630
-Stop!
-Don’t go away!

696
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:48,390
Go get him.

697
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:49,320
Sorry.

698
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,320
Stop.

699
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,760
-Catch him.
-Stop.

700
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:53,600
Hurry up.

701
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,360
Don’t let him go away.

702
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,560
-There.
-Hurry up.

703
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,040
(Huarong Inn)

704
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,470
-Don’t run away.
-Catch him.

705
00:35:58,470 --> 00:35:59,840
Go get him.

706
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:00,800
Sorry.

707
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,630
Catch him.

708
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:04,630
Return it to me.

709
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:10,190
Boss, sorry.

710
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:14,840
Thanks.

711
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,190
-Catch him.
-Hurry up.

712
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:16,830
Don’t go away.

713
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,190
Go get him. Hurry up and catch him.

714
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,180
Go get him.

715
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,950
Don’t go away. There.

716
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:30,360
Catch him right away.

717
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,000
-Excuse me.
-Don’t go away. Stop.

718
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,430
-Don’t go away.
-Stop.

719
00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:36,080
Catch him.

720
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:00,080
Lord.

721
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:03,360
(Huarong Mansion)

722
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,910
I have dispatched someone to notify

723
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:06,430
the governor
with the token of the superior.

724
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:08,560
Governor Zhu is afraid the migrants

725
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,360
in Huarong may disturb you here and

726
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,040
he has allocated this mansion for you.

727
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:11,970
Check if you are satisfied with it.

728
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:28,300
(Blossoms and Fruits)

729
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:29,710
Lord,

730
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,530
the Third Lord is also in Huarong now.

731
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:35,390
Qiu Tianjin?

732
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:36,280
Yes.

733
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:38,000
Immediately after our arrival
in Huarong,

734
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,080
he, Blessed Dog and other people

735
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,420
also arrived here.

736
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:41,780
(Blossoms and Fruits)

737
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:48,710
Where are they?

738
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:51,150
I lost them in Jingzhou.

739
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:51,720
(Stable as Mount Tai)

740
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:54,430
(Stable as Mount Tai)
Why did you come here, Lord?

741
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:55,800
I wonder what deserves

742
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,800
your personal care.

743
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:02,470
Do I need to

744
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:04,510
report to you?

745
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:08,800
Sorry, Lord.

746
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,000
Since you are here,

747
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,230
I must provide my due services to you.

748
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:16,560
Just tell me what I can do for you.

749
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:18,000
I am afraid

750
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,430
you don’t want to let me know.

751
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,450
Impossible.

752
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:24,160
(Stable as Mount Tai)
We have to take order in what we do.

753
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:25,210
(Stable as Mount Tai)

754
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:26,380
(Stable as Mount Tai)
After it is done,

755
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,780
you can do whatever you like in Huarong.

756
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,360
I trust you, Lord.

757
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:36,820
(Stable as Mount Tai)

758
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:37,640
Tianjin.

759
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:43,090
Be reasonable whatever you do.

760
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:58,280
I am always reasonable.

761
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:11,940
Go.

762
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:19,990
(Huarong Mansion)
Lord is always so arrogant

763
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:20,650
(Huarong Mansion)
as leader

764
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:22,120
(Huarong Mansion)
of the Demons.

765
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,360
He even came to Huarong to grab our…

766
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,710
Shut up!

767
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:26,230
No more nonsense!

768
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:27,630
Go and find the Wus

769
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:29,000
and inquire about the whereabouts
of the Color of Ocean and Heaven.

770
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:29,670
Yes.

771
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:31,770
Go and order them

772
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:35,140
to make searches home by home.

773
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:37,470
Is the Third Lord

774
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:38,600
looking for the same people as we are…?

775
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,330
He is searching
for the dependants of Wu Fei.

776
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,830
We must have our priorities.

777
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,670
It is beyond my control.

778
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:49,950
So long as he doesn’t make
a big fuss with it,

779
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:51,800
just forget him.

780
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:53,500
-Yes.
-Yes.

781
00:39:56,540 --> 00:40:00,020
(No See)

782
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:04,700
(Long Time No See Winery)

783
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:07,040
Long Time No See Winery.

784
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,420
It should be here.

785
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:11,630
Where is he?

786
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:17,340
(No See)

787
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:32,270
Girl!

788
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:35,640
Are you looking for me?

789
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,480
Why did you ask me here?

790
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:42,560
(No See)

791
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:43,870
(No See)
It is certainly to buy liquors

792
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:45,950
at a winery.

793
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:54,020
(Long Time No See Winery)

794
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:06,360
This guy doesn’t need
to pay for the liquors.

795
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,810
What did he say?

796
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:22,270
What did you pay for it?

797
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,100
I paid it with some songs.

798
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:31,630
Honor a bosom friend with liquors.

799
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:33,440
It is hard to find
a bosom friend and good liquors.

800
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,190
With a beauty and good liquors here,

801
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:40,040
we must also find good scenes.

802
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:42,140
Go.

803
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:57,300
(No See)

804
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:07,320
Fei,

805
00:42:07,950 --> 00:42:09,890
liquors deserve our careful appraisal.

806
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:13,670
(Liquor)

807
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:14,280
Good drinking capacity.

808
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:21,640
Is this a good scene to you?

809
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:26,890
What are you thinking about?

810
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,320
I was really too silly then.

811
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:34,160
I thought my father would take me out.

812
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:39,190
But he left alone

813
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:40,340
soon after that.

814
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:43,870
Considering your mother’s personality,

815
00:42:43,870 --> 00:42:45,360
it must have taken you great efforts

816
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,440
to leave the Fortress.

817
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,600
It is much harder
than asking your father

818
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:52,410
to take you out directly.

819
00:43:02,190 --> 00:43:03,280
But I didn’t expect

820
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,910
the world was so different outside.

821
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:12,960
Yesterday I was upset

822
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:15,920
for a long way to go
to be a true master.

823
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:18,490
But I was more deeply impressed by

824
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:21,480
so many homeless migrants
in the city today.

825
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:24,910
It is really a tragic world

826
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:27,150
that is beyond the control of my father,

827
00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:28,560
General Wu Fei and other warriors.

828
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,880
You know it well.

829
00:43:34,470 --> 00:43:35,570
So the world of martial arts

830
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:37,550
needs our new generations of people

831
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:39,190
and you are one of them.

832
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:42,290
I finally realize

833
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:44,180
the missions and burdens

834
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:46,380
imposed on a hero.

835
00:43:56,430 --> 00:43:57,620
Who on earth are you?

836
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:03,150
What is

837
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,500
your relation with

838
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:08,640
General Wang Lin?

839
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:16,110
Why does he trust you so much?

840
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:18,630
Why did he invite you

841
00:44:18,630 --> 00:44:19,710
into the Fortress

842
00:44:19,710 --> 00:44:20,710
even if you knew nothing

843
00:44:20,710 --> 00:44:21,940
except footwork?

844
00:44:24,190 --> 00:44:26,060
How do you know I know nothing?

845
00:44:27,470 --> 00:44:28,320
I can also

846
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:29,600
make swords.

847
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:30,670
I also know…

848
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:32,230
I know.

849
00:44:32,230 --> 00:44:33,760
You can also compose songs

850
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,060
and help with the makeup
of a pretty girl.

851
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:37,200
Sure.

852
00:44:38,430 --> 00:44:39,540
As the old saying goes,

853
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,230
jewelries at a time of prosperity

854
00:44:41,230 --> 00:44:42,300
and songs at a time of chaos.

855
00:44:43,390 --> 00:44:44,700
The harder it is to make a living,

856
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:46,950
the more money a song composer

857
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:47,910
can make.

858
00:44:48,430 --> 00:44:49,910
When it comes to martial arts,

859
00:44:49,910 --> 00:44:51,630
I don’t have a great ambition

860
00:44:51,630 --> 00:44:52,660
because I don’t want to rule the world.

861
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:54,280
(Liquor)

862
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:55,630
(Liquor)
I didn’t expect

863
00:44:55,630 --> 00:44:56,950
(Liquor)
your ambition was limited only to

864
00:44:56,950 --> 00:44:58,950
(Liquor)
escaping skills.

865
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:02,550
It is of course an ambition.

866
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:05,320
Look.

867
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:07,000
I can escape
the Fortress of the Forty-Eight

868
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,430
and the dungeon smoothly.

869
00:45:08,430 --> 00:45:09,460
It is a big ambition already.

870
00:45:25,710 --> 00:45:26,380
But Fei,

871
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:27,960
I wonder

872
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:29,630
if your mother will kick me out again

873
00:45:29,630 --> 00:45:30,790
if I go to the Fortress

874
00:45:31,470 --> 00:45:33,050
with you this time.

875
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:35,870
I don’t think so.

876
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:38,960
I don’t have another father
for you to take away.

877
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,160
I am just afraid

878
00:45:48,910 --> 00:45:51,020
she may worry about
what is even more valuable to her.
