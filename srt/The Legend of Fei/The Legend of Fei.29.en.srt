-The Mountain Sword?
-and

the South Blade
my grandfather practiced.

00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,680
Sounds like

24
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,950
a collection

25
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,310
of all sects, right?

26
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:57,160
Manuals.

27
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,510
Your grandfather’s blade.

28
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,510
A collection of all sects.

29
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:01,760
Where are they?

30
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,120
The Demon-Extermination Assembly

31
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:06,950
held by Huo Liantao.

32
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:08,390
Let’s go.

33
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:09,600
Sure.

34
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,160
Go ahead.

35
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,240
Alright. I’ll go pack up.

36
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,830
He can be a hired muscle.

37
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,270
Only Yang Jin

38
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:23,670
would buy such nonsense.

39
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,320
Food is ready.

40
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:27,270
Looking good.

41
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,340
Why is everything cold?

42
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,340
I’ve checked.

43
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:01,340
You’d better eat cold food,

44
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:02,570
because anything hot

45
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:04,090
may lead to a quicker death
by poisoning.

46
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:08,560
Which quack told you that?

47
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:11,230
Poisoner Ying Hecong.

48
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:16,710
Why?

49
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:19,010
Was he wrong?

50
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:21,090
What else did he say?

51
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:26,130
Reborn Pill of
the Big Medicine Valley...

52
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:27,530
That’s useless to me.

53
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:29,820
You knew that already?

54
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,540
Hey,

55
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,100
do you think
I’m after that Bracelet

56
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,690
for the Reborn Pill?

57
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,900
I’m only doing it

58
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,760
as per my ancestor’s will.

59
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,010
Think about it.

60
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:47,690
That valley was gone a long time ago.

61
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:49,060
Pills Mr. Yutai took

62
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,660
were the ones

63
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:52,500
found outside.

64
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,220
You weren’t even born

65
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,780
at that time.

66
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,660
Since then,

67
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:59,060
so many years have passed.

68
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:02,780
Those pills would’ve gone bad.

69
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:05,250
And they weren’t the elixir of life,

70
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,500
right?

71
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,420
You have a point.

72
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,900
Bring me something hot next time.

73
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,060
These are as bad

74
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:21,540
as the buns I had

75
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,170
in the dungeon.

76
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:26,170
Would you rather die sooner?

77
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:27,840
No.

78
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:32,220
But I would

79
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,820
if you feed me these every day.

80
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:40,290
I’ll eat them with you.

81
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:51,620
Fei, you don’t need to do this.

82
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:53,850
I don’t regret

83
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:55,410
what happened to me.

84
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:57,000
It has nothing to do with you.

85
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,620
Aren’t you curious

86
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,540
why I own so much energy?

87
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:08,010
I’ve never seen anyone

88
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:09,970
with more energy than you.

89
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:16,730
So far,

90
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:18,380
I only know two people

91
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,620
that might be your match.

92
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:23,130
Yellow and Green Palm, Duan Jiuniang

93
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:26,940
and the head of Demons Manor,
Shen Tianshu.

94
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,660
You must think I’m too young

95
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,340
to have reached this level,

96
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:33,340
right?

97
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,730
I’m sure you’ve figured it out.

98
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:39,660
Technically speaking,

99
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,540
that’s not my energy.

100
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,540
My uncle forcibly expanded

101
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,060
my meridian channels

102
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,130
and transfused

103
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:47,960
all his energy to me.

104
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:51,380
You must’ve learned

105
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,850
at home

106
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:54,410
once the energy

107
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:55,970
was drained,

108
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:59,210
one would only end up dead.

109
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:04,940
Basically, that’s a life for a life.

110
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:07,100
Correct. I’m a murderer

111
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,030
because someone died to save me.

112
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:11,400
As long as I’m alive,

113
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,410
General Wang Lin’s Anping Army

114
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:15,010
won’t stop the fight

115
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:16,450
because they believe

116
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:18,410
the Xiaos’ offspring

117
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:19,340
is the hope

118
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:21,170
to restore the reign.

119
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:22,250
So

120
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,970
I’m also a threat to the state.

121
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:26,780
As a murderer and a threat,

122
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,730
I’m living on borrowed time,

123
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:29,410
don’t you agree?

124
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:30,660
Who the ruler is

125
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,170
doesn’t matter to the masses

126
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:34,620
as long as they can live well.

127
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,010
Back in the dungeon,

128
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:38,060
if you hadn’t come,

129
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:40,170
I would’ve gotten myself out.

130
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:42,380
Thanks to you,

131
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:44,130
I’ve lived one more year.

132
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,340
Consider what I did for the Fortress

133
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:51,690
a thank-you gift.

134
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:53,060
Don’t feel guilty.

135
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:57,540
So you’ve said all that

136
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:59,660
to relieve my guilt?

137
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:01,410
Would I turn a blind eye to you

138
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:03,290
if you weren’t poisoned because of me?

139
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:05,130
Your business is also mine!

140
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,820
What are you looking at?

141
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,130
Stop talking,

142
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:15,850
and start eating now or never.

143
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:35,980
I believe there’s always a way out.

144
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,740
Without the Reborn Pill,

145
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,690
there must be something else.

146
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:40,900
If I were you,

147
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,340
whether it’s the Big Medicine Valley

148
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,250
or that Bracelet,

149
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,860
I won’t give up any hope.

150
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:53,740
Even if I fail eventually,

151
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:54,980
I’ll die with no regrets

152
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:58,540
and rest in peace.

153
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,660
Don’t ever

154
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:05,740
say that again,

155
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:06,570
or I’ll whack you!

I haven’t had a good night’s sleep

175
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:53,860
since I arrived in Lingling.

176
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,420
And I was too busy
hiding from the Route Gang

177
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,370
to bathe over the past few days.

178
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:01,220
Smell it.

179
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:04,100
I’m sweaty and stinky.

180
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:06,220
You smell fine.

181
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:10,490
I’m a renowned figure

182
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:13,130
after all.

183
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:16,220
Please do me a favor

184
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:19,100
and bring me some bathwater.

185
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:33,980
Alright.

186
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:36,610
Well...

187
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:41,300
The lock...

188
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:45,780
You can bathe with it.

189
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:48,050
Don’t worry.

190
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:50,490
It won’t rust.

191
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,540
The quality of Madam Nichang’s product

192
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,740
is guaranteed.

193
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:55,250
She runs an honest business.

194
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,570
You know that, don’t you?

195
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,180
My hand...

196
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:07,010
One hand is inconvenient.

197
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:08,450
Inconvenient how?

198
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:09,490
It’s...

199
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,250
It’s hard to do things with one hand.

200
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:20,010
You can use extra hands.

201
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:24,250
Won’t that be too much trouble?

202
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,180
Not at all.

203
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:28,490
I don’t want to be a bother.

204
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:30,900
I’ll ask Li Sheng to help you.

205
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:36,250
Fei! Fei!

206
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:38,930
Fei, I can’t bathe in front of him!

207
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:52,490
No peeking,

208
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:54,220
or I’ll tell Chuchu

209
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,200
you’re a pervert.

210
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:57,180
Why would I peek?

211
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:58,900
And what’s that

212
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,050
to do with Chuchu?

213
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:01,050
Why would you tell her?

214
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:05,740
So you two are like sisters.

215
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,130
Sisters?

216
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,370
When did I...?

217
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,180
Are you crazy?

218
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,250
Where are you going?

219
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,980
Unlock me.

220
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:23,050
It just came to me

221
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:25,420
that Fei had told me repeatedly

222
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:27,450
you’d try everything

223
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:28,300
to drive me away.

224
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:31,860
I won’t fall for your tricks.

225
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:33,980
Let’s go.

226
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:35,810
I won’t drive you away.

227
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:46,810
Make it quick.

228
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:56,130
What... what are you doing?

229
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:12,570
I can’t bathe like this.

230
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,780
Give me a hand.

231
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,450
What are you? A mandarin duck?

232
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:27,300
Stop dabbling!

233
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,690
Don’t you bathe like this?

234
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:31,050
I can only use one hand.

235
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:32,180
It’s inconvenient.

236
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:35,540
Give me yours,

237
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:36,900
or I can’t do this.

238
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:40,740
Feels good!

239
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:45,180
Hey, isn’t this awkward?

240
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:47,010
Don’t forget I’ll have to get dressed.

241
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,490
Hold... Hold on.

242
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:53,660
I’ll go to the back

243
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:54,740
and wait for you behind the screen.

244
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:57,300
How could I get dressed with one hand?

245
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:01,660
I’ll unlock you.

246
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:02,930
Really?

247
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:04,340
Yes, I will.

248
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:06,220
Alright. Thanks.

249
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,420
Mr. Xie,

250
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:28,540
Zhou Fei is more stubborn

251
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:30,100
than she seems.

252
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,660
She’s stubborn as a mule.

253
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:33,810
Everyone in our Fortress

254
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:35,610
knows that.

255
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:38,490
You can say that again!

256
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,930
It’s fine

257
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:44,300
if she’s just stubborn.

258
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:45,980
But ever since she met you,

259
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:48,450
she’s become evil.

260
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,660
What’s that supposed to mean?

261
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,010
Seeing that

262
00:15:56,010 --> 00:15:57,930
she tied your hand

263
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:00,450
with your feet yesterday,

264
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:02,570
I’ve been wondering

265
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:05,010
if the disciple has outsmarted

266
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:06,540
the master

267
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:09,050
and if he’s digging his own grave.

268
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:19,250
Mr. Xie.

269
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:20,810
Are you mad?

270
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,690
What’s taking you so long?

271
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,660
Are you done?

272
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,330
Crap!

273
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,780
What are the odds?

274
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,010
Are you also out to see the moon?

275
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,340
When you were bathing,

276
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,660
I knew

277
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:53,060
I’d find you here.

278
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:00,420
Your cousin is right.

279
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,690
I am

280
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:04,290
digging my own grave.

281
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:11,960
Don’t move!

282
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:16,330
Fine. I won’t.

283
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,460
Behave yourself.

284
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:32,250
Good night.

285
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:36,300
Good night.

286
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:39,330
Take care.

287
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:40,630
Get some rest.

288
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,660
Have a sweet dream.

289
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:43,640
See you tomorrow.

290
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:45,660
Good night.

291
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,490
What about me?

292
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:50,850
You?

293
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:52,460
I’m going to bed.

294
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:56,730
Don’t.

295
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:58,730
I’m not done serving you.

296
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:00,970
-What are you doing?
-Come on.

297
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:02,180
I’m sorry, Mr. Li. I was wrong.

298
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:03,250
-I’m sorry.
-How could you be wrong?

299
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,460
Stop, please. I’m sorry.

300
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,970
I really am.

301
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,240
Behave yourself.

302
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:56,890
Miss Zhou.

303
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:02,610
Miss Zhou?

304
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:05,970
Miss Zhou, are you in?

305
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,540
Miss Zhou?

306
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:12,490
Are you there?

307
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:17,180
Sir,

308
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:19,900
are you looking for Miss Zhou?

309
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:29,730
You’re awake.

310
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:32,060
You know me?

311
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:34,330
We all saw you when Miss Zhou

312
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:35,940
carried you back yesterday.

313
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:39,410
Oh, that.

314
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:42,330
That was a prank.

315
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:43,460
Sorry about it.

316
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,300
One of my friends is a foodie

317
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,130
from Jiankang.

318
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:53,730
Fei, do you mean Mr. Xie?

319
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:56,490
May I ask

320
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:58,180
if you’re surnamed Xie?

321
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:00,970
You know that, too?

322
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:04,250
Are you from Jiankang?

323
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:06,490
You aren’t

324
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:07,460
some fortuneteller, are you?

325
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:09,850
No. I’m Zhu Chen with Xingnan Sect.

326
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:12,940
Miss Zhou once did me a favor.

327
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:15,250
I know you

328
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,130
because she told me a lot

329
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:18,900
about a friend of hers surnamed Xie.

330
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:26,970
Is that duck stuffed with sticky rice

331
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,090
Jiankang’s specialty?

332
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:31,700
Yes.

333
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,820
Jiankang is also my hometown.

334
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:35,700
Miss Zhou said

335
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,780
she’d like to try the specialties there,

336
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:39,710
so I made this for her.

337
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:42,970
Mr. Xie,

338
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:45,540
would you like some?

339
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:49,210
No, I’m good.

340
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:50,750
Thank you.

341
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:00,610
From now on,

342
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:01,580
serve all his food cold

343
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:02,460
and bring it to my room.

344
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,540
I’ll give it to him.

345
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:04,220
Yes.

346
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:12,280
What’s up?

347
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:13,970
Miss Zhou,

348
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:15,820
is Mr. Xie

349
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,610
in poor health?

350
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:19,240
He seems unwell.

351
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:20,420
I’ve seen rarities

352
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,900
when traveling with others.

353
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,180
I can keep

354
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:25,730
fine herbs for you

355
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:26,780
if you need.

356
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:27,660
Thank you,

357
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:28,370
but no need.

358
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:30,370
I...

359
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:30,850
This...

360
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:53,180
I can explain.

361
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:56,760
I didn’t run away.

362
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:58,540
I left to cook

363
00:21:58,540 --> 00:21:59,940
duck stuffed with sticky rice for you.

364
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:00,800
Try it.

365
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:43,040
What do you think?

366
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:44,320
Is it good?

367
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:49,970
Which one is better?

368
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:51,970
Mine

369
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:53,660
or Mr. Zhu’s?

370
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:57,420
I don’t know.

371
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:58,820
I didn’t eat his.

372
00:22:58,820 --> 00:22:59,900
Li Yan did.

373
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,100
You can ask her.

374
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:11,510
It’s tasty, right?

375
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:17,130
Just because you cooked this for me

376
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:19,490
doesn’t mean I’m going to unlock you.

377
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:23,370
I won’t run away again.

378
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:27,690
I swear.

379
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:31,480
What game are you playing now?

380
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:36,840
I should ask Madam Nichang

381
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:41,820
if there’s a way to shorten the chain

382
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,730
to stop you from escaping forever.

383
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,730
I couldn’t even stand her

384
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:52,090
eating someone else’s dish.

385
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:56,370
How could I leave her?

386
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:42,850
What do you want?

387
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:46,060
After you die,

388
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:48,370
may I keep your body?

389
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:51,250
Look,

390
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:52,700
the Bone-chilling poison

391
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,970
didn’t kill you

392
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:57,130
and you could give yourself
the Soul-searching Needle.

393
00:24:57,130 --> 00:24:59,580
You’re one of a kind

394
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:01,090
and too valuable to be buried.

395
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:01,580
Don’t you agree?

396
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:03,610
Who the heck is he?

397
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:05,900
I promise

398
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:06,580
that I’ll

399
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:08,490
preserve your body well

400
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:09,940
for future studies.

401
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:10,740
Do we have a deal?

402
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:12,090
By the way,

403
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:13,970
did Hu Tianying

404
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:15,580
poison you?

405
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:16,540
I’ve been looking for her.

406
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:17,180
Can you let her know

407
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,300
you’re still alive

408
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,660
to lure her out?

409
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:21,210
Then I’ll be able to...

410
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:28,300
What’s wrong with them?

411
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:31,010
Don’t they have manners?

(Auspicious Cranes

(Lingling Inn)

414
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:48,820
Today, Huo Liantao is holding

415
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:51,420
the Demon-Extermination Assembly
at this place.

416
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:53,090
Chuchu and I will go have a look

417
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:54,730
and ask around

418
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:56,010
about Old Master Huo

419
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:57,940
for Taoist Priest Chongxiao.

420
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:59,250
Do as you see fit.

421
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:00,970
Take care of Chuchu.

422
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:03,600
Take me with you.

423
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:06,250
If I continue lying in bed,

424
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:07,580
I won’t be able to walk again.

425
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,090
You can’t go.

426
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:10,440
Just stay put.

427
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:18,300
I agree.

428
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:20,940
Mr. Xie, you’re still weak.

429
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:22,780
Better stay here with Fei

430
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:24,740
and keep an eye on Li Yan.

431
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:27,700
Once Chuchu and I get back,

432
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:29,660
I’ll take her home.

433
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:31,370
Too late.

434
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:32,500
She’s long gone.

435
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:35,730
She’s gone?

436
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:36,540
My egg!

437
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:38,350
When did she leave? How did you know?

438
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:42,060
This morning, I was up early

439
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:44,010
and I saw your sister

440
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:45,180
dragged Mr. Yang out

441
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:47,180
to some Assembly.

442
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:50,300
Why didn’t you stop her?

443
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,300
I...

444
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,180
Sheng,

445
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:54,540
you know Yan well.

446
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:56,210
Who could make her stay?

447
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:58,490
What if she’s in danger?

448
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:00,420
She’s with that bonehead.

449
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:04,730
That guy will only make things worse.

450
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:06,460
I must get her back.

451
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,610
I’ll go with him.

452
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:18,540
Excuse me.

453
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:19,300
Coming.

454
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,660
Excuse me.

455
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:21,730
Sir.

456
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:22,850
Miss Zhou here

457
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:24,090
can’t stop eating your pine nuts.

458
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:25,090
Can we have more, please?

459
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:26,320
Sure. Coming right up.

460
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:37,340
Here you are.

461
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:41,660
Do you also want to go there?

462
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:45,730
It’s a pity to miss it.

463
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,700
Besides,

464
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,660
despite what you said,

465
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:51,700
I guess

466
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:54,060
you can’t help worrying about them,

467
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:55,130
can you?

468
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:56,940
Don’t pretend you know me so well.

469
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:58,850
I know you came all the way

470
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:00,420
for the Assembly.

471
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:07,010
You can attend it only under my watch.

472
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:09,590
But I’m warning you.

473
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:11,540
Do not try to escape

474
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:13,850
or engage in a fight again.

475
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,120
Sure. We have a deal.

476
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:17,650
And

477
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:22,780
can you

478
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:24,920
unlock me, please?

479
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:30,030
Alright.

480
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,010
No problem.

481
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:34,180
Thanks.

482
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:36,010
I swear I won’t run away.

483
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,970
Miss Zhou,

484
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:51,700
didn’t you say you’d unlock me?

485
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,490
I did say that,

486
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:54,660
but I can

487
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:56,210
lock you again in another way.

488
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:58,700
You win.

489
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:00,540
What happened to them?

490
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:02,330
Are they escaped prisoners?

491
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:04,210
A man and a woman.

492
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:12,330
Have a look.

493
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:15,210
-Take a look.
-Are you sure to walk around like this?

494
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:17,250
We might get arrested

495
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:19,540
before arriving at the Assembly.

496
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:20,850
I dare them!

(Luojin Ready-to-wear Clothes)

498
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:29,250
How about

499
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:31,370
we get changed first?

500
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:32,140
This way.

(Luojin Ready-to-wear Clothes)

502
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:39,370
May I have a look at that one?

503
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:40,210
That one?

504
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:44,490
Looking good.

505
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:46,610
Sir, how much is it?

506
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:48,610
That one is a bit pricey.

507
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:51,460
I like this one.

508
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:57,610
-You have good taste, ma’am.
-Let’s take this one.

509
00:29:57,610 --> 00:29:59,970
It suits your husband perfectly.

510

Sir, you’re mistaken.

512
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:07,460
It’s great. I love it.

513
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:08,180
Right,

00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:08,900
dear...?

515
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:12,850
It’s made of the finest cotton.

516
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:14,250
The price is a bit...

517
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:16,130
That’s fine. We can afford it.

518
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:19,210
I understand.

519
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:30,540
Are you done?

520
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:33,190
We got a problem.

Fei, you...

522
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:44,640
Could you unlock me?

523
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,780
I can’t get changed like this

524
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:47,900
on my own.

525
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:49,850
I promise

526
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:51,420
I won’t escape.

527
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:54,700
Fei,

528
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:55,850
I swear to heaven.

529
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:57,900
Please. I mean it.

530
00:30:58,250 --> 00:30:59,970
Unlock me now.

531
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:09,900
I’ll trust you this once.

532
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:21,610
What are you doing?

533
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:23,090
Do you want to be seen

534
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:25,850
with me like this?

535
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:37,250
No peeking.

536
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:38,130
Close your eyes.

537
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,820
Is it open?

538
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:59,250
It’s taking longer than I thought.

539
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:03,250
Didn’t Li Sheng open it at once?

540
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:05,420
How come?

541
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,300
I’ve studied

542
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,730
this Eight-trigram Lock.

543
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:10,490
One must know Eight Trigrams

544
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:12,330
and the tips

545
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:13,490
to open it easily.

546
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:14,450
Think again.

547
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:17,630
You’ve studied it?

548
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:25,120
Is this what they call

549
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:30,250
to hold hands

550
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:31,760
and grow old together?

551
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,080
Are you alright?

552
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:05,430
I’m fine.

553
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:16,740
(Luojin Ready-to-wear Clothes)

554
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:24,700
Hadn’t I heard them talking about

555
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:26,660
a locked couple in the street,

556
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:29,420
I wouldn’t have known you are out.

557
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:31,970
Mr. Xie,

558
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:34,330
you’ve got changed quickly.

559
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:35,700
But how,

560
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:37,480
I wonder?

561
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:49,850
Let’s go.

562
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:54,980
(Luojin Ready-to-wear Clothes)

563
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:56,330
(Huo’s Manor)

564
00:33:56,330 --> 00:33:57,120
Stop.

565
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:58,850
Do you have an invitation?

566
00:33:58,850 --> 00:33:59,970
Yes.

567
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:01,540
May I have a look?

568
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:13,610
Please.

569
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:17,370
The invited can go this way.

570
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:23,770
Stop.

571
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:25,700
Do you have an invitation?

572
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:26,220
No.

573
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:27,180
Hold on.

574
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,500
No invitation.

575
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:30,550
Please.

576
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:34,330
The uninvited go this way, please.

577
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:41,420
Stop. Do you have an invitation?

578
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,290
Yes.

579
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:53,050
Please.

580
00:34:53,770 --> 00:34:55,220
Bonehead,

581
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:57,020
what to do?

582
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:59,980
They all have invitations.

583
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:00,940
How about

584
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:02,460
we steal one?

585
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:03,740
No.

586
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:05,290
The one Mr. Zhu received

587
00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:06,460
has his name on it.

588
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:08,330
Others’ must be the same.

589
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:09,700
We can’t use

590
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,260
any of them.

591
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:13,770
Since when did you become so smart?

592
00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:16,050
I always am.

593
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:21,810
Follow me.

594
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:28,430
Lord asks for you.

595
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:39,610
Excuse me, do you have invitations?

596
00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:40,650
Of course!

597
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,660
Where are they?

598
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:48,570
Bonehead,

599
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:49,900
do you have them?

600
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:51,770
You didn’t give them to me.

601
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:53,610
I did back in the inn.

602
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:54,810
Find them.

603
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:56,530
You didn’t.

604
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:00,330
Yes, I have them.

605
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:01,530
Give me a minute.

606
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:03,770
I’m sorry.

607
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:04,700
My friend here

608
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,180
is a bit slow.

609
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:07,500
Please bear with him.

610
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,570
It’s fine if you don’t have them.

611
00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:10,320
This way, please.

612
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:22,460
I’m sorry

613
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,570
but seats at
the waterside pavilion are limited.

614
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:25,570
As per Lord’s order,

615
00:36:25,570 --> 00:36:28,130
the uninvited go this way, please.

616
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:30,510
You’ll be seated over there.

617
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:32,460
Alright.

618
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:33,660
We aren’t picky.

619
00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:38,920
Please.

620
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:50,200
Take it away.

621
00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:56,020
I’ve had better food in the palace.

622
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:57,810
How dare you serve me such trash!

623
00:36:57,810 --> 00:36:58,940
I’m sorry.

624
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:00,130
On my way to Lingling House

625
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:01,220
to pick up braised seedpod-shaped pork,

626
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:03,180
I overheard

627
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:06,130
the Third Prince,
Chen Zichen, is also in town.

628
00:37:07,370 --> 00:37:08,980
And that concerns me how?

629
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:10,420
I’m not his mother.

630
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:12,020
His whereabouts aren’t my business.

631
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:14,050
Yes. I understand.

632
00:37:14,810 --> 00:37:16,030
Wait.

633
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:20,980
What’s he doing here

634
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:22,560
at this moment?

635
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:26,040
He can’t be here

636
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:30,260
for the Assembly, can he?

637
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:31,940
Lord Chu,

638
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:33,980
Lord Huo and the Third Prince

639
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:35,810
go way back.

640
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:41,290
Very well.

641
00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:42,260
Let’s go

642
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,660
pay His Highness a visit

643
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:47,530
and invite him over.

644
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:49,330
Lord Chu,

645
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:50,660
that won’t be necessary.

646
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:51,660
Lord Huo has promised

647
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:52,980
to give you the Seal of Cautiousness.

648
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:54,700
In case he changes his mind

649
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:56,700
and gives me a fake one instead,

650
00:37:57,220 --> 00:38:01,500
I’m going to need His Highness

651
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:07,090
as leverage.

652
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:09,020
After all,

653
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:12,090
the last thing Huo Liantao wants

654
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:15,810
is to see a prince die at his place.

655
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:18,500
He’s made enough enemies.

656
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:22,370
If the court is also on to him,

657
00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:24,180
I’m afraid

658
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:28,980
the Huo family will stop at him.

659
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:44,940
Your Highness,

660
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:46,980
I agree with Mr. Xie.

661
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:48,460
We’d better

662
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:50,400
stay away from the Assembly.

663
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:52,570
We’re already here.

664
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:55,500
So are talents across the state.

665
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,130
We can take this chance

666
00:38:56,130 --> 00:38:59,020
to hire the best ones to work for us.

667
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:01,530
If we miss it,

668
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:03,530
who knows when such

669
00:39:03,530 --> 00:39:05,220
a once-in-a-lifetime chance
will come again?

670
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:06,180
But...

671
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:07,570
Your Highness.

672
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:11,420
Your Highness, Lord Huo

673
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:12,850
has sent a carriage to pick you up.

674
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:15,130
How did he...?

675
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:17,420
He’s made the gesture.

676
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:18,460
If we refuse to go,

677
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:19,910
won’t that be disrespectful?

678
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:21,370
Let’s go.

679
00:39:31,290 --> 00:39:32,770
Do you have invitations?

680
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:33,390
No.

681
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:36,610
(Huo’s Manor)
This way, please.

682
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:41,180
This way, please.

683
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:44,290
Do you have invitations?

684
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:46,810
I have.

685
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:48,460
They’re with me.

686
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:04,430
This way, please.

687
00:40:06,090 --> 00:40:07,810
The invited go this way.

688
00:40:09,850 --> 00:40:11,370
-This way, please.
-Do you have invitations?

689
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:12,570
What?

690
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:15,660
I can’t go in without one?

691
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:16,370
You can.

692
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:17,770
This way, please.

693
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:21,610
It’s been a while.

694
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:24,040
Indeed, Mr. Zhuang Bi.

695
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:27,180
So invitations aren’t necessary.

696
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:29,770
The uninvited go that way.

697
00:40:29,770 --> 00:40:32,020
Are the guests divided into two groups?

698
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:34,540
Maybe they’re seated separately.

699
00:40:35,090 --> 00:40:37,050
Are there two sessions?

700
00:40:37,050 --> 00:40:38,790
One for each group?

701
00:40:39,810 --> 00:40:41,660
(Huo’s Manor)
The waterside pavilion isn’t big enough.

702
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:42,570
As per Lord’s order,

703
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:44,700
the uninvited go this way, please.

704
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:47,090
Your seats are over there.

705
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:48,630
Fine.

706
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:50,290
I’ll

707
00:40:50,290 --> 00:40:51,850
see you later.

708
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:02,700
Guests are separated by invitations?

709
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:04,900
Miss Zhou, Mr. Xie,

710
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:08,420
we can go together.

711
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:10,260
No, thanks.

712
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:12,260
My cousins should be over there.

713
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:13,940
We’ll join them.

714
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:16,500
Thank you, Mr. Zhu.

715
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:17,660
Thank you.

716
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:21,810
Please.

717
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:26,020
Let’s go.

718
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:39,570
What is Huo Liantao up to?

719
00:41:40,090 --> 00:41:41,260
Be quiet.

720
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:42,100
I’m memorizing the direction.

721
00:41:43,290 --> 00:41:44,570
This forest

722
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:45,550
is a maze.

723
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:48,300
It’s hard to get out once we’re in.

724
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:06,370
Don’t you think something is odd?

725
00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:07,370
Odd?

726
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:13,220
These trees look fine to me.

727
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:13,810
How are they odd?

728
00:42:13,810 --> 00:42:14,940
I mean,

729
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:16,960
isn’t this place...

730
00:42:29,610 --> 00:42:30,770
Over there.

731
00:42:31,370 --> 00:42:32,100
Li Yan.

732
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:35,210
What are you doing?

733
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:37,530
There might be a snake.

734
00:42:37,530 --> 00:42:38,740
Snake!

735
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:39,720
Where is it?

736
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:45,780
(Animal characters made by CG)

737
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:52,260
(Animal characters made by CG)

738
00:42:53,050 --> 00:42:54,370
It’s gone.

739
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,290
Wait... wait for me!

740
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:00,620
(Animal characters made by CG)

741
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:01,260
Stop!

742
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:06,220
(Animal characters made by CG)

743
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:06,660
Stop!

744
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:07,740
(Animal characters made by CG)

745
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:09,330
Don’t touch me,

746
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:11,090
or there will be dire consequences.

747
00:43:11,090 --> 00:43:12,370
What is he doing here?

748
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:14,050
Who is it?

749
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:16,500
He seems to be
that Poisoner with Mr. Xie.

750
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:18,420
How dare you

751
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:20,700
release a snake!

752
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:21,180
I did that

753
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:23,360
to punish Ding Kui
for bullying a waitress.

754
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:26,130
It’s the master’s order

755
00:43:26,130 --> 00:43:27,500
to separate the invited
and uninvited guests.

756
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:29,450
Go to him if you have a problem with it.

757
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:31,700
Why bully a girl?

758
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:33,700
You’re playing the hero.

759
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:35,810
Let’s see

760
00:43:35,810 --> 00:43:36,980
how tough you are!

761
00:43:51,770 --> 00:43:53,180
Who are you?

762
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:56,090
Yang Jin from the Cloud Ravine.

763
00:43:56,090 --> 00:43:57,530
And me,

764
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:00,090
Li Yan from the Fortress
of the Forty-Eight.

765
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:01,810
Wait for it.

766
00:44:01,810 --> 00:44:03,260
This isn’t over!

767
00:44:03,530 --> 00:44:05,570
I’ll report to Tortoise Master

768
00:44:05,570 --> 00:44:06,850
to teach you a lesson.

769
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:08,020
Let’s go.

770
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:14,810
I learned that move from your cousin.

771
00:44:14,810 --> 00:44:15,770
Didn’t I do it faster

772
00:44:15,770 --> 00:44:16,850
and better than her?

773
00:44:16,850 --> 00:44:18,420
How are your hands?

774
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:20,500
Am I more skilled than her?

775
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:22,900
Thanks for your help.

776
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:27,700
Step back, please. Thanks.

777
00:44:30,770 --> 00:44:31,900
Are you from the Small Medicine Valley?

778
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:32,730
Yes.

779
00:44:33,530 --> 00:44:36,020
But he knows nothing about medicine.

780
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:37,770
Must you add that?

781
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:42,740
Hey, why didn’t you

782
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:44,460
attack them with your snakes?

783
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:45,940
My snakes?

784
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:47,980
They’re my babies

785
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:49,260
and worth much more

786
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:51,020
than their lives.

787
00:44:55,090 --> 00:44:56,080
My snake!

788
00:44:57,530 --> 00:44:58,330
Hongyu.

789
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:00,420
Hongyu.

790
00:45:01,090 --> 00:45:02,260
Hongyu.

791
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:03,770
Hongyu.

792
00:45:04,370 --> 00:45:05,770
Hongyu.

793
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:07,260
Hongyu.

794
00:45:07,530 --> 00:45:09,740
-Hongyu?
-Hongyu.

795
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:12,570
-Hongyu.
-Hongyu.

796
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:14,660
-Hongyu.
-Hongyu.

797
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:17,130
-Hongyu.
-Hongyu.

798
00:45:17,610 --> 00:45:19,420
-Hongyu.
-Hongyu.

799
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:20,500
Hongyu.

800
00:45:20,770 --> 00:45:23,130
Hongyu. Hongyu.

801
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:26,020
We’ve already saved him.

802
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:27,850
Why help him find his snake?

803
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:30,020
Hey,

804
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:31,700
is a big man like you

805
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:33,530
afraid of snakes?

806
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:34,940
I’m not. I...

807
00:45:38,130 --> 00:45:39,490
What is that?

808
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:43,420
I raised those snakes.

809
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:45,220
They can recognize
the sound of my flute.

810
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:46,740
But right after

811
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:48,130
entering in the woods,

812
00:45:48,130 --> 00:45:49,810
they ran wild

813
00:45:49,810 --> 00:45:50,920
as if something scared them.
