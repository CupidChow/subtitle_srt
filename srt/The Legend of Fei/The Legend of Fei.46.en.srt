17
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,760
Li Sheng, Zhou Fei,

18
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,720
Lord Gantang is back safe and sound.

19
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,590
Cousin.

20
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,230
She’s... All yours.

21
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:03,160
I heard you need medicine

22
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,870
to suppress the poison in your system.

23
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,110
Killing you would be too easy.

24
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,240
So many people died of your poison.

25
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,670
It’s time for you

26
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:13,520
to taste it yourself.

27
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:26,910
When Shen Tianshu left,

28
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,520
we should’ve known

29
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,320
that he had decided

30
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,080
to sacrifice others if necessary.

31
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,600
You never would’ve guessed

32
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,080
that’d be you, right?

33
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:45,080
He wouldn’t.

34
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:48,390
Tianshu would never abandon me.

35
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,440
He’d come to get me out.

36
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:54,470
He’d be here soon.

37
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,960
Grandfather, Aunt,

38
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:33,800
she’s finally paid

39
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,960
for what she had done to you.

40
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,830
“I go to Wuzhou to see you

41
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:46,470
where mountains appear at dusk.

42
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:48,470
Climb the mountain to
overlook the north of the river.

43
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:50,720
Send stones and Ganoderma.

44
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,960
The valley is splendid

45
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,800
where birds sing beautifully.

46
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,720
Music comes everywhere

47
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,470
when four songs are played”.

48
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:13,320
Lord, is this poem

49
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,520
the key to finding
The Color of Ocean and Heaven?

50
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:19,480
Liu Youliang guarded it with his life.

51
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,790
It must be useful.

52
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:26,550
The tokens are irregular

53
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:28,270
and suspicious.

54
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:30,600
Were they not,

55
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,440
The Color of Ocean and Heaven
would’ve been long gone.

56
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,350
What should we do next?

57
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:39,110
Tiankuang can go with you.

58
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:40,320
-Lord.
-Lord Shen is occupied.

59
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,550
-Move!
-Do not disturb.

60
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,600
Lu Tiankuang.

61
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,670
-Go away!
-You...

62
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,320
How did my sister die?

63
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,160
Are you blaming Lord Shen for her death?

64
00:04:58,670 --> 00:04:59,830
It was her fault

65
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:02,440
that she was weaker than others.

66
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,880
Gu Tianxian.

67
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,950
Are you accusing me of murder?

68
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:20,950
Hadn’t you sent her to
the Fortress of the Forty-Eight,

69
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:22,760
she wouldn’t have died.

70
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,350
When did I send her there?

71
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,640
All she cared about

72
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,270
was you.

73
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:30,880
She only listened to you.

74
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:32,420
(To Tianshu)

75
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,270
After she lost the Seal of Cautiousness,

76
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:40,480
(Dear Tianshu)
I asked her to come back in the letter.

77
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,670
That was her response,

78
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:44,480
saying she had promised
Commander-in-chief

79
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:47,480
to retrieve the five tokens.

80
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,720
You recognize her handwriting.

81
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,230
Read it yourself.

82
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:55,140
(I won’t come back
until I have all five tokens.)

83
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:01,230
Stop wasting your time on me.

84
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:04,230
Save your strength to avenge her death.

85
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,920
How did she die?

86
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:11,000
The Snow-breaking Blade killed her.

87
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,670
Zhou Fei!

88
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:36,230
Lord,

89
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,320
I’m going to

90
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,230
fulfill her lifetime wish

91
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,110
to obtain Book of Almighty Medicine.

92
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,320
Please help me

93
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,950
get revenge for her.

94
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:56,950
In that case,

95
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,920
you must obey my orders.

96
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:12,600
All the sacrifice is worth it

97
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:17,270
for The Color of Ocean and Heaven.

98
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,440
What do you think?

99
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,600
You’re indeed skilled, Mr. Deng.

100
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,480
I’m not half as good as my master.

101
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:39,480
That’s too modest of you.

102
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,000
Few are as capable as you.

103
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,110
I’m not.

104
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:47,110
I once read a book at my master’s,

105
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,920
titled Refinement of Iron,

106
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,000
in which skills of refining and smelting

107
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,040
are top-notch.

108
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,920
They can make weapons

109
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,830
100 times better than those in use now.

110
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:58,510
I’m nothing compared with my master.

111
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,280
You don’t believe me?

112
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:11,800
Have a look.

113
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,350
My master made this blade

114
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:17,910
according to that book.

115
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:19,400
Hold it.

116
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,310
Cut this one.

117
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:28,560
Go ahead.

118
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,270
See? It’s true.

119
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,590
Incredible!

120
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,680
I wish

121
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:52,150
I could have a glance at that book.

122
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,120
I know. Me too.

123
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:57,950
But it’s gone with my master.

124
00:08:57,950 --> 00:08:59,590
I don’t think we can read it again.

125
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,150
You certainly can

126
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,880
when he’s back, can’t you?

127
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,800
It’s not that easy.

128
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,510
I heard

129
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:11,640
he had presented it to His Majesty.

130
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,200
It’s almost impossible to have it back.

131
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:21,270
Is there someone else who’s read it?

132
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:26,080
I mean if there is,

133
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,120
I can ask around for you.

134
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:35,390
I’ve never told anyone about it

135
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:37,080
except you.

136
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,560
It was a spur of the moment.

137
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,710
This Iron Hand

138
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:41,390
is the best I’ve ever made.

139
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:46,680
I’m in luck.

140
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,830
With that book

141
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:51,080
in my hand,

142
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:54,320
I’ll become unstoppable.

143
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:32,120
Fei, Lord Gantang is back.

144
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:39,440
Father, there you are!

145
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,350
Fei.

146
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:45,910
Mother...

147
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:51,270
I should’ve come back earlier.

148
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:58,510
She’s poisoned with Worry-burying.

149
00:10:58,510 --> 00:10:59,710
According to Pathetic Clam,

150
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:01,640
the antidote is inside

151
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,710
The Color of Ocean and Heaven.

152
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,950
Unfortunately,

153
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:08,200
the tokens are now
in Shen Tianshu’s hand.

154
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:10,910
Don’t worry too much.

155
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,760
Perhaps

156
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:20,390
Abbot Tongming on Penglai Island

157
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,350
can remove her poison.

158
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:26,000
Really?

159
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,760
Yes.

160
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:12,140
(True self)

161
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,830
Fei,

162
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,200
what you’re holding

163
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,240
isn’t Unbreakable, is it?

164
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,830
Father,

165
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,510
that one is broken.

166
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,200
This is...

167
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,950
A gift from Xie Yun, right?

168
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:37,470
It must’ve taken him

169
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:39,560
a lot of effort

170
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:42,910
to find such a fine blade.

171
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:44,800
He owed me one

172
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,120
and he was obligated to pay me back.

173
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:58,000
Fei,

174
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,640
the so-called heaven’s will

175
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:04,000
or fate

176
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,030
is merely an excuse made by the weak.

177
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,710
We can’t run away from everything.

178
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,760
I know you

179
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,150
too well.

180
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,470
You aren’t a quitter.

181
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:23,880
You’ll fight to the end

182
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:26,200
with your blade

183
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,830
against the enemy.

184
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,560
Remember,

185
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:41,950
stay calm, be brave and you’ll win.

186
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:47,150
I understand.

187
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,270
I’m leaving with your mother

188
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,510
for Penglai.

189
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,200
Here.

190
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,590
Have a drink to warm up.

191
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:55,680
Thank you, Lord Gantang.

192
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:01,150
It can keep you warm for now.

193
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:09,270
Ever since Fei left home,

194
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:13,360
I’ve been watching you.

195
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:18,390
General Wang Lin once told me

196
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:22,390
you’re sentimental by nature.

197
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,600
You’re wise

198
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,230
but not cruel enough to be a ruler.

199
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:30,600
So you might not live long.

200
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,230
I was naive.

201
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:38,630
I tried so hard to prove him wrong

202
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:41,840
but I failed.

203
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,990
Lord Gantang, I...

204
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:52,750
I know.

205
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:55,360
You’ve been

206
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:58,030
running away from the name.

207
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,030
“Xiao Chuan”.

208
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:04,990
You want to be “Xie Yun”.

209
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:07,750
So when you came to deliver the badge,

210
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,560
I accepted it.

211
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,840
I didn’t force you to go back.

212
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,320
I’m always grateful to you for that.

213
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:21,680
Masters of two generations

214
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,750
have gone for that treasure.

215
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,360
Jinrong’s life is also at risk.

216
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:36,270
As the owner of it,

217
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:38,960
you still won’t shoulder
your responsibility?

218
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,720
I thought

219
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:50,390
we can put an end to everything

220
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:53,360
when we had all five tokens.

221
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:56,870
To prevent future trouble,

222
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:58,960
I consulted Madam Li

223
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:01,630
about destroying the tokens

224
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:03,480
once and for all.

225
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:09,390
I know her.

226
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:12,750
She’d never agree to that.

227
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:19,720
I’m sorry.

228
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:23,750
Don’t be.

229
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:26,320
She didn’t keep them

230
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,510
for you,

231
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:30,480
but for the greater good.

232
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,600
So

233
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,080
I’m the one

234
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,480
who should apologize.

235
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:44,990
I’m leaving for Penglai with Jinrong

236
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:48,510
to have Abbot Tongming treat her.

237
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,990
All that started with me.

238
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:57,270
I knew

239
00:19:57,270 --> 00:20:00,110
you wouldn’t agree
to have them destroyed.

240
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:03,990
So

241
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:05,510
from now on,

242
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,030
I’ll try to locate the treasure

243
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,800
to draw an end

244
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,110
to everything.

245
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:19,230
Your Majesty, that’s not what I mean.

246
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:24,200
Think about it.

247
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:28,320
If it fell into the Demons’ hands,

248
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,440
a catastrophe would rise.

249
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:33,320
If it was found by ambitious schemers,

250
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,840
blood would be shed.

251
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:40,030
But if the right people got hold of it,

252
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:42,800
it could save the world.

253
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,480
All that

254
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,960
is up to you.

255
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:00,320
Your Majesty.

256
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:04,750
I’ve entrusted Anping Army to Wen Yu.

257
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:08,110
Please look after Fei for me.

258
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,080
You know,

259
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:50,230
you aren’t alone in this.

260
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:51,600
You’ve made tons of

261
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:55,600
like-minded friends along the way,

262
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,600
right?

263
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:00,150
I know

264
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:02,630
whatever happens,

265
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:04,680
Fei will always have my back.

266
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,510
Lord Gantang,

267
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:23,840
I swear

268
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,230
I’ll protect her

269
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:30,360
until the very last moment.

270
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,110
And I’ll

271
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:37,600
pave the way ahead of her.

272
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:23,560
Fei, take care of yourself.

273
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,720
Your mother will be fine.

274
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,870
Yan,

275
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:04,320
it’s time to eat.

276
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:19,360
You barely had anything yesterday.

277
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,800
I’ll practice hard

278
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,720
to impress Aunt when she gets back.

279
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,680
Enough.

280
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,680
Be good.

281
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,320
Take a break.

282
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,080
Alright.

283
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,960
Chuchu.

284
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:49,800
You know,

285
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:52,030
Aunt is always strong.

286
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:54,230
She’ll be fine, right?

287
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:55,910
Don’t worry too much.

288
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,390
She wouldn’t leave us behind.

289
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,480
Chuchu,

290
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,360
I’ve been thinking

291
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,560
if I had practiced hard

292
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,270
instead of slacking,

293
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:11,800
I would’ve been as skilled as Fei

294
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:14,030
and I could’ve protected others.

295
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:15,390
That way, Aunt wouldn’t have...

296
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:17,960
I know you’re upset

297
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,440
and eager to improve your skills,

298
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:23,480
but what happened isn’t your fault.

299
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,270
Don’t beat yourself up.

300
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:26,630
I used to believe

301
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:29,230
there were no good or bad people,

302
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:30,750
only their stands

303
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:32,990
and views were different.

304
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:34,680
But I was wrong.

305
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:37,800
Some are born evil.

306
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,870
They mean to destroy

307
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:42,910
what others cherish
by fair means or foul.

308
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:45,200
I admit that I’m less skilled

309
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,720
and talented than others,

310
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,480
but other than martial arts,

311
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,990
there are other weapons I can use

312
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,080
just like those in this book.

313
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,910
I want to be like Ying Hecong

314
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:58,110
and kill those Demons myself!

315
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:01,150
Gentlemen know what to do

316
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:02,440
and what not to do.

317
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,030
Is it wrong

318
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:06,910
to kill bad people?

319
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:09,230
Take poison

320
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:11,230
as an example.

321
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:12,910
Both Ying Hecong

322
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:14,800
and Pathetic Clam use it.

323
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,080
Do you know

324
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,150
the difference between them?

325
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:20,560
I do, Chuchu.

326
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,870
The last thing we want

327
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:25,680
is to see you drown yourself in hatred.

328
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,680
I’m more worried about Fei.

329
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,600
Ever since Pathetic Clam died,

330
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,110
she’s locked herself in the room.

331
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:33,480
Mr. Xie is there with her.

332
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,910
He’ll comfort her.

333
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:38,360
I know how she feels,

334
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:40,230
but

335
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:43,680
that woman’s death
couldn’t repair the damage.

336
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:46,840
Xie Yun and Aunt

337
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:49,270
are dying because of her,

338
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:50,320
but

339
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,080
the mastermind got away with it.

340
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,510
Nobody can handle

341
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:56,960
such pain.

342
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,480
Fei can.

343
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,560
Everyone,

344
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:05,080
remember how Old Master took you in?

345
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:07,840
I could never repay him
for his kindness.

346
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,600
We all know how bad the situation is.

347
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,630
No one can help us.

348
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:12,630
That’s right.

349
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:15,440
What if the Demons raided us again

350
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,360
just like the last time?

351
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,680
Look,

352
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,200
we must stay together

353
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,270
in times like this.

354
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:22,960
We can’t fall apart

355
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,840
from inside.

356
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,680
Fei is here. You can tell her

357
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,320
what you think.

358
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:33,960
We never force people to do anything.

359
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,720
You’re free to stay or leave.

360
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,600
Fei,

361
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,510
don’t get me wrong,

362
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:40,390
but other than Madam Li,

363
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:42,360
who can take charge of the Fortress?

364
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,560
We’re old

365
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,750
and almost got killed
by the Demons more than once.

366
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:47,560
It’s probably too much

367
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,230
to ask for a peaceful retirement.

368
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:50,510
Leader Niu,

369
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:53,840
we’re grateful for your service

370
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,480
all these years.

371
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:58,230
If you ever wish to come back,

372
00:27:58,230 --> 00:27:59,720
our Fortress

373
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,870
is always open to you.

374
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:03,990
Elders,

375
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:06,230
I’m here to tell you

376
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:07,360
that I’m leaving

377
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,110
to look for
The Color of Ocean and Heaven.

378
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:11,390
And I’m entrusting you

379
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:13,680
with things here.

380
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,910
You can’t, Fei.

381
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:16,840
I know how much you hate them.

382
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,440
But don’t act on impulse.

383
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,360
What if something happens...?

384
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,510
Trust me. I know what I’m doing.

385
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:24,630
As long as the Demons

386
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:26,480
are after The Color of Ocean and Heaven,

387
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,910
we’ll always

388
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:29,800
be in danger,

389
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,150
and so will

390
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:33,230
the rest of all sects.

391
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:35,270
We can’t run away from them.

392
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:41,560
“I go to Wuzhou to see you

393
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,840
where mountains appear at dusk.

394
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,080
Climb the mountain to
overlook the north of the river.

395
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,800
Send stones and Catalpa branches”.

396
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:50,960
Lord Gu,

397
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,360
where’s the entrance of
the Big Medicine Valley?

398
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,510
It’s right in this poem.

399
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,910
“Where mountains appear at dusk”.

400
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:03,720
We’re surrounded by mountains.

401
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,510
“Climb the mountain to
overlook the north of the river”.

402
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:12,320
“The north of the river”?

403
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,230
What’s there to look?

404
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,390
Open your eyes

405
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,320
and check carefully.

406
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:23,960
Let me know

407
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,230
if there’s anything matching the poem.

408
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:25,960
Yes.

409
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,720
Lord Gu!

410
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:29,960
Lord Gu!

411
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,800
There’s a strange place

412
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,200
where irregular rocks pile on.

413
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,110
“Where mountains appear at dusk”.

414
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:03,200
Is this it?

415
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:08,510
Check the surroundings
for anything unusual.

416
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:09,480
Yes.

417
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,750
Anything?

418
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:21,840
What did you see?

419
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:22,840
Lord Gu,

420
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,910
there’s nothing strange.

421
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,480
“Send stones and Catalpa branches”.

422
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:36,840
Did you see Catalpa trees

423
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,360
on our way here?

424
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,630
Trees are many,

425
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:41,510
but not of that species.

426
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:44,480
That can’t be!

427
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,510
The entrance

428
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:49,560
must be nearby.

429
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:54,630
Hurry up.

430
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:55,270
Yes.

431
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,800
Be careful.

432
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:58,080
Don’t drop anything.

433
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:58,960
Got it.

434
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,320
-Be careful. Slowly.
-Leader Niu.

435
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,680
These are all from Miss Zhou.

436
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,030
What are they?

437
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:08,960
Knowing that we’re heading to the north,

438
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,200
she’s prepared
thick clothes and food for us.

439
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:11,910
And

440
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:13,440
herbs, too.

441
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:16,110
She said you practice a lot

442
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:17,720
and suffer from leg pain.

443
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,840
Apply the herbs to your injury

444
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,440
and you’ll feel better.

445
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:23,230
She’s considerate.

446
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:24,440
Where is she?

447
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,680
On the training field.

448
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,680
You may leave.

449
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:29,390
Put it over there.

450
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:30,630
Got it.

451
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:34,080
Li Zheng’s granddaughter

452
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:37,360
wouldn’t dare to lie to me.

453
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,990
Then...

454
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,150
Then I must’ve

455
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:43,600
missed something in the poem.

456
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,270
But I swear

457
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,910
I’ve done my best.

458
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:51,270
Never mind.

459
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:56,230
What should we

460
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:58,680
do next?

461
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,560
A jade ox.

462
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:16,110
When I came across it months ago,

463
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:18,360
I thought it’d be to your taste,

464
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,680
so I kept it for you.

465
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,680
That’s

466
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,480
too kind of you.

467
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,560
As you know,

468
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,870
my brother and I...

469
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:36,630
I work under him

470
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:38,510
and dare not to offend him.

471
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:39,910
Hold on.

472
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:42,870
Just hear me out.

473
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:45,030
What I’m saying is

474
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:48,480
he’s above you now,

475
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,080
but might not be forever,

476
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,800
right?

477
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,840
We’re friends.

478
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:01,270
If one day, I take his place,

479
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:03,360
this kind of accessory

480
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:06,630
might be too cheap for you.

481
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:14,030
This jade piece is spotless

482
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:15,870
as if it were a masterpiece of nature.

483
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,030
It’s a rare treasure.

484
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:22,440
No one deserves it other than you.

485
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,270
I’m glad you like it.

486
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:25,840
Report!

487
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:29,510
Commander,

488
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:31,150
you have a visitor.

489
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:32,630
Who is it?

490
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:34,200
A man surnamed Shen.

491
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,680
It’s time

492
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,800
for me to leave.

493
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:44,390
Thanks for your gift.

494
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:46,840
If you need anything from me,

495
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:49,080
just let me know.

496
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:14,400
Have a seat, Lord Shen.

497
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,670
To what do I owe

498
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:29,600
the honor?

499
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,360
The Color of Ocean and Heaven.

500
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,160
I heard the tokens

501
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,920
are all in Zhou Fei’s hand.

502
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:45,880
I can’t do anything about it.

503
00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:49,510
Not anymore.

504
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:51,880
They belong to me now.

505
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,190
Congratulations!

506
00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:01,030
There’s a confusing poem

507
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:03,670
about the treasure,

508
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:05,800
and I couldn’t figure it out.

509
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:09,160
I understand you own tons of talents...

510
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,920
Lord Shen,

511
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:17,430
they’re useless

512
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:23,160
compared with your people.

513
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,920
Besides, you’ve warned me to stay away

514
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,950
from what’s inside the treasure.

515
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:32,600
Why should I help you?

516
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:39,270
I’ve seldom asked others for favors

517
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:41,880
and I won’t take back

518
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,800
what I’ve said.

519
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,950
You may be a deterrent

520
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:48,160
to other sects,

521
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,950
but compared with

522
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:52,990
my formidable troops,

523
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:54,990
you’re nothing.

524
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:57,950
So what

525
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,160
if I turn you down?

526
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,990
Your troops

527
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:16,080
may be formidable,

528
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:19,920
but they can’t stop me

529
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,710
from taking a person’s life.

530
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:24,360
Trust me,

531
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:27,950
or go back to your tent

532
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:30,230
and wait for it.

533
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:42,950
I’m not

534
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:45,950
an ingrate.

535
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:48,800
Once I obtain that treasure,

536
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:52,120
I’ll do my utmost

537
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:55,750
to help you fulfill your wish.

538
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,360
Tiankuang,

539
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:30,160
I can find the entrance

540
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:33,160
on my own.

541
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,750
That treasure concerns our future.

542
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:38,990
We can’t be too careful.

543
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:47,800
Lords,

544
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,430
the poem shows

545
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:50,560
the entrance

546
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,670
is most likely to be here.

547
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:56,470
But some of the lines are wrong.

548
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,270
Really?

549
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:08,190
No wonder I didn’t find it.

550
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:09,030
The good news is

551
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:10,510
we can use the surroundings

552
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:11,600
to locate it.

553
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,670
How long will it take?

554
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:13,950
About two hours.

555
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:15,120
Make it quick.

556
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:24,990
Sheng,

557
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:27,670
have some food.

558
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,950
What’s on your mind?

559
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:36,600
Fei says she’s going to get
The Color of Ocean and Heaven

560
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,800
but the Demons have all the tokens.

561
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,230
As skilled as she is,

562
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:41,470
she’s still

563
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:42,880
not Shen Tianshu’s match.

564
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:46,640
Sheng,

565
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:47,950
are you saying

566
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:49,640
Fei is looking for
The Color of Ocean and Heaven?

567
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:53,560
I know where it is.

568
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,990
It’s in the Big Medicine Valley.

569
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:59,320
Who told you that?

570
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:02,270
Pathetic Clam and Shen Tianshu said it.

571
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:03,950
It’s true.

572
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:08,430
Li Sheng, I was just told

573
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:09,950
Demons Manor had dispatched a squad

574
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:11,120
to the north.

575
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:13,270
Their destination is unknown yet.

576
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,230
Go tell

577
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:21,430
Zhou Fei and Xie Yun
to meet me at the Hall of Elders

578
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:22,880
for an emergency.

579
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,880
Yes.

580
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:25,840
Yan,

581
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,270
ask Yang Jin to come over, too.

582
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:28,320
Got it.

583
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:30,510
Let’s go.

584
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:35,990
It’s in the Big Medicine Valley?

585
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:37,120
That’s right.

586
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:39,270
Shen Tianshu and Pathetic Clam said so.

587
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:42,510
Lyu Run’s disciple founded
the Big Medicine Valley.

588
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:44,710
And he himself wrote
Book of Almighty Medicine.

589
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:47,120
That book

590
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,840
is highly likely to be there.

591
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,710
General Huang, Huang Shenbian,

592
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:53,710
was the son of Lyu Run’s disciple.

593
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:55,080
It makes sense

594
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,880
that he’d keep the treasure

595
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,800
at that secluded valley.

596
00:39:58,800 --> 00:39:59,670
Besides,

597
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:00,880
Pathetic Clam and Shen Tianshu

598
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,270
had all the tokens then.

599
00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:04,190
Why would they lie to a girl?

600
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:05,840
It’s said the entrance

601
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:08,320
is trapped and concealed.

602
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:10,670
The poem Liu Youliang left behind

603
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:14,120
must be the clue.

604
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,160
Anything new about the Demons?

605
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,400
All we know is

606
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,510
they’re heading to the north,

607
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:22,030
probably in the direction of
the Big Medicine Valley.

608
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:23,800
If so, let’s go.

609
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:24,510
Yes.

610
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:25,840
Hold your horses.

611
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:28,750
That poem is still a mystery.

612
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:30,470
If we leave unprepared...

613
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:31,800
Stop dragging your feet.

614
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:34,670
Instead of pondering over

615
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:36,800
those words such as
“mountains” and “dusk”,

616
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,510
why don’t we go there and have a look?

617
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:41,270
I agree.

618
00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:43,430
But...

619
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:44,430
Sheng,

620
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:45,950
Fei is right.

621
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:47,360
It’s better than

622
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,320
sitting here and doing nothing.

623
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,710
If you’ve made up your mind,

624
00:40:58,710 --> 00:41:00,400
I’ll go with you.

625
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:02,560
I can

626
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,920
deal with traps there.

627
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:05,510
I meant

628
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:07,640
to have you stay

629
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,190
and take care of things here.

630
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:12,560
It’s imperative to find that treasure.

631
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,120
We need all hands on deck

632
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:15,230
and end things once and for all.

633
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:16,120
Besides,

634
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:19,560
the risk is high this time.

635
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,640
The more the help, the better.

636
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:24,120
Li Sheng is right.

637
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,710
We can’t let you two go there alone.

638
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:28,160
We aren’t too skilled,

639
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,510
but we can still be of help.

640
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:31,510
Yang Jin,

641
00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:33,320
this is

642
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,120
our family matter

643
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:36,160
and I hate to drag you into it.

644
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,750
It’s just...

645
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:39,030
If...

646
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:40,640
things go wrong,

647
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:41,880
I hope

648
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,920
you can take care of my sister.

649
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:47,160
I’m officially

650
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:49,230
entrusting her to you.

651
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:53,880
You...

652
00:41:55,990 --> 00:41:57,710
What are you doing?

653
00:41:57,710 --> 00:41:59,840
I can take care of myself.

654
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,270
And

655
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:02,950
I don’t need him.

656
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:05,840
Now isn’t the time for this.

657
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:08,080
I’m not afraid of death.

658
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:10,160
Yang Jin,

659
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,080
what about your valley?

660
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:15,120
The Small Medicine Valley

661
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:17,320
is built to triumph over evil.

662
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,640
If I could get hold of

663
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,950
rare medical books,

664
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:24,120
those elders would be thrilled.

665
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:26,560
They’d trade me for them if necessary.

666
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:32,270
Is there such a rule in their sect?

667
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:35,710
Yang Jin,

668
00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:37,750
I know I can’t stop you,

669
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:38,920
but think about it.

670
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:41,600
Only two girls are left here.

671
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,190
What if...

672
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:45,670
Sheng, you don’t know anything.

673
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:47,160
Chuchu and I have decided

674
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:48,470
to join you.

675
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:52,920
I thought you knew better than her.

676
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,750
How come you’re on her side?

677
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:56,230
Yan,

678
00:42:56,230 --> 00:42:58,320
you’d better stay at home.

679
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,670
We’ll get things done.

680
00:42:59,670 --> 00:43:01,080
What are you talking about?

681
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:02,230
That poem

682
00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:03,600
started with me.

683
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:04,880
I must go with you.

684
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:06,600
Li Yan!

685
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:07,990
Sheng,

686
00:43:07,990 --> 00:43:09,670
I’m no longer a kid.

687
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:10,750
I can do

688
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:11,710
as much as you do.

689
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:13,080
This isn’t a game.

690
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:13,990
It’s different.

691
00:43:13,990 --> 00:43:15,800
That’s why I’m coming with you.

692
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,270
Aunt treated me so well.

693
00:43:17,270 --> 00:43:18,840
I must do something for her.

694
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:20,400
Enough. I’ve made up my mind.

695
00:43:20,990 --> 00:43:21,920
Sheng,

696
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,270
I know you want to protect her,

697
00:43:24,270 --> 00:43:26,670
but can you do that forever?

698
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:27,640
So

699
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:29,640
you should respect her decision.

700
00:43:30,990 --> 00:43:32,840
Are you sure about this?

701
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,400
Since my parents were killed,

702
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,400
I’ve decided

703
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:41,800
to not run away from anything.

704
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,510
I’ll fight side by side with you

705
00:43:43,510 --> 00:43:45,800
to the end.

706
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:53,880
Zhou Fei,

707
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,430
say something!

708
00:43:56,950 --> 00:43:58,470
I was weak

709
00:43:58,470 --> 00:44:00,230
when I first left home

710
00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:02,920
and I was near death more than once.

711
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:04,920
Masters I met along the way

712
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,510
never told me to give up.

713
00:44:07,510 --> 00:44:09,600
They all trusted me instead.

714
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:11,710
Cousin,

715
00:44:11,710 --> 00:44:13,430
none of us wants to quit.

716
00:44:13,430 --> 00:44:15,120
Stop wasting your time.

717
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:16,430
Let’s go.

718
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:20,320
Alright. It’s settled.

719
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:21,190
Whatever comes our way,

720
00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:22,880
we’ll handle it together.

721
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:28,030
Please!

722
00:44:28,430 --> 00:44:29,510
Fine.

723
00:44:30,270 --> 00:44:31,670
Enemies are still out there.

724
00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:33,320
Damage can’t be undone.

725
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:36,600
Let’s end everything with us.

726
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:38,230
-Yes!
-Let’s go!

727
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:42,900
(Hall of Elders)

728
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:46,620
(Fortress of the Forty-Eight)

729
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:53,670
Fei,

730
00:44:55,230 --> 00:44:56,640
We’re ready

731
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,600
to go anytime.

732
00:45:00,510 --> 00:45:02,270
Fei,

733
00:45:02,270 --> 00:45:05,270
this trip is full of danger

734
00:45:05,270 --> 00:45:06,670
and the unknown.

735
00:45:06,990 --> 00:45:08,080
Listen,

736
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:10,160
whatever happens,

737
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:11,190
I’m always here with you.

738
00:45:11,190 --> 00:45:12,990
You aren’t alone.

739
00:45:14,030 --> 00:45:16,320
I’ll kill

740
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:18,400
whoever gets in my way.

741
00:45:21,230 --> 00:45:23,230
Look at you.

742
00:45:23,230 --> 00:45:24,750
When you’re quiet,

743
00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:26,230
you’re pretty

744
00:45:26,230 --> 00:45:28,270
and lovely.

745
00:45:28,270 --> 00:45:29,710
Once you speak,

746
00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:32,710
others will be in awe of you.

747
00:45:33,270 --> 00:45:35,560
You sure can be trusted.

748
00:45:36,190 --> 00:45:37,750
They say

749
00:45:38,270 --> 00:45:40,800
the Demons are a never-ending nightmare.

750
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:44,640
But I believe however long it lasts,

751
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:47,160
the ray of light will tear it apart.

752
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:51,670
Of course.
