=Legend of Fei=

16
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:32,940
=Episode 27=

17
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,000
There was a meritorious talent.

18
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:51,490
When he was little,
enemy troops invaded his hometown

19
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:53,410
and his hometown was occupied.

20
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,170
He had no choice,
but to wander from place to place.

21
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:00,770
One day, he strayed
into a fairy mountain.

22
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:04,130
Because of his extraordinary body,

23
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:06,020
a Taoist priest took him
as an apprentice

24
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:08,810
and even taught him invincible skills.

25
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:10,340
Years later,

26
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:13,620
the young man came back

27
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,340
in the hope of reviving his state,

28
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:17,860
and joined the army.

29
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:20,450
He was incomparably brave.

30
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:22,650
He led the army,
fighting wars across the state

31
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,500
and being in the limelight.

32
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,930
Unfortunately,

33
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:27,730
he had bad luck.

34
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:30,780
He fell in the trap of evil men

35
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,900
and was poisoned on the battlefield.

36
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:38,170
He could do nothing, but run away.

37
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:41,060
When he was dying,

38
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,060
he saw a flock of crows flying to him!

39
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,810
He then knew his master sent the crows

40
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:47,650
to save him.

41
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:52,570
He gave up his battle achievement,

42
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:56,290
went away with the crews
and became a monk.

43
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:58,860
-Good story.
-Good story.

44
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,700
Why does it sound

45
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,060
like the Caw?

46
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:05,220
Yuyi Troupe hasn’t
visited Chunhui Town yet.

47
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,730
The story has already come.

48
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:08,780
Old rocks by the bridge.

49
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,290
There’s much frost.

50
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,420
A travelling man has gone on a journey.

51
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:15,650
Why doesn’t he come back?

52
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:17,700
It’s your new play?

53
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,340
My new play tells a story

54
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:21,420
about a deserter.

55
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,450
Bone-chilling is

56
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,530
the No.1 poison.

57
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:27,060
Poisoned people die with chilled faces.

58
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,170
That’s how it was named.

59
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,930
Reborn Pill is said to detoxify it.

60
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:33,260
Whoever takes it will always need water.

61
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:34,340
All his life,

62
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,260
he must live
where there’s rich water vapor.

63
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:40,060
Fei.

64
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:41,900
What’s on your mind?

65
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:47,480
Don’t you find this story weird?

66
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:51,370
I think I once read about it

67
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:52,780
on the comment of a martial book.

68
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:55,170
About Penglai.

69
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:56,140
Immortals in Penglai?

70
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:57,650
What’s the comment about?

71
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,620
There’s a sentence.

72
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,860
Old dreams die down in Penglai

73
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:05,530
and sunset impels clouds with no trace.

74
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:07,650
But I don’t understand

75
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:09,570
what that means.

76
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:13,010
Sunset impels clouds with no trace?

77
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,850
Excuse me.

78
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:37,900
Miss Zhou.

79
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:38,820
Have you seen Xie Yun?

80
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,010
Mr. Xie?

81
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:40,570
Yes.

82
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:42,660
He has left with Madam Li’s badge.

83
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:45,130
Fine.

84
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:47,780
Madam.

85
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:49,970
Disciples down the mountain reported

86
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:51,780
Junior Master Huo Liantao of Huo’s Manor

87
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,380
was sending out invitations

88
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,170
for the Demon-Extermination Assembly.

89
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:57,660
Let him be.

90
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,690
He printed the ripple pattern

91
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:00,540
on the invitations.

92
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,540
Huo Liantao.

93
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,730
He has weak skills,
but strong ambitions.

94
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:07,100
If I weren’t too busy with
rebuilding our fortress

95
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,250
to go there,

96
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:09,940
I would like to challenge him.

97
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:12,060
Aunt! Aunt!

98
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:16,500
You’re too busy to go,
but I can go for you.

99
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,730
Li Yan, don’t add trouble.

100
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:21,290
You?

101
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:22,730
Before you can fully perform
the blade artistry

102
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:24,250
I’ve taught you,

103
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,690
I won’t let you leave.

104
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:27,410
-Aunt.
-Aunt.

105
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:32,540
I think I can go on behalf of you.

106
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,450
Old Master Huo is a close friend
of Mr. Chongxiao.

107
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:38,940
Knowing he was ill,

108
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:39,620
Mr. Chongxiao travelled all the way

109
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:41,850
to see him one last time.

110
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,620
Old Master Huo died
in front of me.

111
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:47,220
And before he died,
he chattered about the pattern.

112
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,170
Why don’t we figure out how he died

113
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:51,340
by attending the Assembly?

114
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:54,250
We can also tell Mr. Chongxiao about it.

115
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:59,010
What do you think?

116
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:00,450
How much does it look alike?

117
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,660
70% alike, at most.

118
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,290
If you want it better,

119
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:07,820
I’m afraid I need to see the real one.

120
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:13,170
It’s a sticky business.

121
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:15,450
I can only take it out secretly.

122
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:16,690
If he has the real scabbard,

123
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:18,220
others will cast greedy eyes.

124
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:22,060
He won’t have me keep it for him.

125
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:24,340
I can only send out fake ones.

126
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,060
Otherwise,

127
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,500
he would be in trouble sooner or later.

128
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:32,730
Junior Master.

129
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,060
Master.

130
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:36,010
Shoot.

131
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:38,970
Martial artists keep coming
to take revenge.

132
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:40,380
But they’ve been stopped

133
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,540
by Qi Men Dun Jia Formation
Mr. Chongxiao set up.

134
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:44,660
Good.

135
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:46,620
We’re in troubled times.

136
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:49,450
Since we have the precious thing,

137
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:51,970
we must be very cautious.

138
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:53,940
We should prevent martial artists
from making trouble

139
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,170
as well as the Demons.

140
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,380
(Auspicious Omen and Luck)
I heard they had already attacked

141
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:59,130
the Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

142
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:01,290
Looks like Shen Tianshu is dying

143
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:03,780
to get the Color of Ocean and Heaven.

144
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,010
Now,

145
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:06,690
he can’t take down
the Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

146
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,500
My guess is

147
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,340
he will come here to look for trouble.

148
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,340
Our men patrol day and night.

149
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:14,450
Elite disciples take turns
to guard the gate.

150
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:15,780
Without your permission,

151
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,570
we won’t let anyone suspicious in.

152
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:18,570
Good.

153
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:42,410
You were born weak.

154
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:43,620
And you had internal injury.

155
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:46,940
You’re not strong enough
for martial arts.

156
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,060
Chongxiao!

157
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:01,620
Chongxiao!

158
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,290
Chongxiao!

159
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:10,130
Phoenix Pill?

160
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:17,450
This is Phoenix Pill,

161
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:20,290
helping to rebuild your body.

162
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,250
What happened to you?

163
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:53,780
You swallowed the pill directly?

164
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:55,660
Are you crazy?

165
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:12,710
Mr. Yang.

166
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:22,370
Lately, I’ve been too busy

167
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:24,050
to say thanks to you.

168
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:27,100
During the trouble we had,

169
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,660
thank you for helping us.

170
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:30,660
We’re very grateful.

171
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:32,100
See you!

172
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:39,930
Bonehead!

173
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:47,180
Li Yan?

174
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:49,010
Why is it you again?

175
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,300
You look hasty.

176
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,490
Where are you going?

177
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:56,010
I’m going to find Zhou Fei

178
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:56,970
for a competition.

179
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,810
Fine, since you want a punch.

180
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,340
Let me take you there.

181
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,780
Only I know where she is.

182
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:08,010
Let’s go.

183
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:11,980
Sir.

184
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:15,250
You... You get me wrong.

185
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,860
We can’t just let Huo Liantao

186
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:20,370
hold the Demon-Extermination Assembly.

187
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,610
Ask Mr. Chu to go.

188
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:31,930
Tell him I’m still badly wounded
after the fight in the Fortress.

189
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:34,780
Under such dangerous circumstances,

190
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:37,340
I have no choice,
but to ask him to go.

191
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:39,180
Mr. Chu.

192
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,740
Shen Tianshu wants you
to take back the Seal of Cautiousness.

193
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,180
I’m not going.

194
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:48,860
Commander-in-chief asked me

195
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,740
to spend the rest of my life comfortably

196
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:54,340
in Demons Manor,

197
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:56,610
instead of being ordered about
by Shen Tianshu.

198
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:58,780
But Shen Tianshu failed
in the Fortress of the Forty-Eight

199
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,810
and didn’t get back the token
for the Color of Ocean and Heaven.

200
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:03,180
He nearly got Commander-in-chief killed.

201
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,570
(Sparrow Chu Tianyu with Demons Manor)
Commander-in-chief has been angry.

202
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:06,930
(Sparrow Chu Tianyu with Demons Manor)
If you help him

203
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:08,810
to get back the Seal of Cautiousness,

204
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:10,930
he will think more highly of you.

205
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,540
By then,

206
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,980
I guess you may take charge

207
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,280
of Demons Manor.

208
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,930
(Noodles)
Griddle cakes.

209
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,220
Griddle cakes.

210
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:30,740
Miss.

211
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:33,300
Would you like a griddle cake?

212
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:39,450
Steamed stuffed buns.
Hot steamed stuffed buns.

213
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:43,570
You must be Zhou Fei
from Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

214
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:46,980
The man you’re after is too sly.

215
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:50,010
Our men all keep an eye on him.

216
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:51,690
We even named him,

217
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:52,690
uh...

218
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:53,900
Mink.

219
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:56,420
He’s heading for Lingling Town, I guess.

220
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:57,660
In Lingling Inn,

221
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:00,540
men with Blue Bat are watching for him.

222
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:04,540
Thanks.

223
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,860
Mother, be careful.

224
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:17,340
Be careful.

225
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:22,900
Let’s have a rest over there.

226
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,050
Okay.

227
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:25,300
Let’s walk a bit further.

228
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:52,130
Mother, I’m hungry.

229
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,930
Don’t cry, baby.

230
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:58,780
Have some sleep in my arms.

231
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:01,420
Then you won’t be hungry.

232
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,930
Mother! Mother!

233
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,490
Mr. Chongxiao?

234
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:07,570
A secret tunnel?

235
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:27,100
(Phoenix Pill)

236
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,690
Isn’t it...?

237
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,780
Don’t touch it!

238
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:40,180
You can’t take it improperly.

239
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:42,200
You just don’t want me to eat any!

240
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:44,450
Liar!

241
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,900
You said it was the last one.

242
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,100
The Phoenix Pill is a kind
of evil medicine

243
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:52,900
made by our ancestor Lyu Run.

244
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:55,370
Taking it will give you great strength.

245
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:58,250
But a master must bring its property

246
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,900
into your body with his force

247
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,130
and dissolve it.

248
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:04,300
Or you’ll be in great danger!

249
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,300
Ordinary men

250
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,370
can’t stand such effects.

251
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:09,740
Soon, they will lose their mind

252
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:13,980
and die of blood explosion.

253
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:16,220
A disciple with Big Medicine Valley

254
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:18,690
once stole the pills and ate them.

255
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:20,810
He turned into a demon,

256
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:22,860
and killed many men!

257
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,930
Two years later,
he died of body explosion.

258
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:26,160
Two years?

259
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:44,690
It’s not me. Not me!

260
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:52,980
Where’s my scabbard?

261
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,220
Where is it?

262
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:01,130
I want my scabbard.

263
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:02,930
Chongxiao!

264
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:06,950
You lied to me, too!

265
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:17,050
Chongxiao!

266
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:18,370
Come out!

267
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:20,300
Give my scabbard back to me!

268
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,780
Chongxiao!

269
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,300

Chongxiao!

274
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:01,540
How dare you come back!

275
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:16,700
What happened to you?

276
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:19,060
Did you take Phoenix Pills again?

277
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:22,250
Don’t panic. Let me help you.

342
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:45,460
I ran after him all the way here.

343
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:47,210
He took my whisk

344
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:48,850
and hid in the mountains.

345
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:51,490
Finally, he went down the mountain

346
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:53,090
and visited the blacksmith’s shop

347
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:54,850
to forge scabbards.

348
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:56,780
He forged a dozen scabbards.

349
00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:59,850
He’s the chief of Qi School.

350
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:02,460
But he did such a stupid thing

351
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,580
just for a young man.

352
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:06,010
Isn’t it funny?

353
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:14,900
Psychopath!

354
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:21,700
You killed him?

355
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:31,210
I did.

356
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:36,130
I punched him and he died.

357
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:46,900
(Lingling)

358
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:21,130
Young Master.

359
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:22,610
My Lady.

360
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:23,940
When we’re in Lingling Town,

361
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,490
we’re within the territory
of the Huo family.

362
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:27,060
At the Demon-Extermination Assembly
in a few days,

363
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:29,090
you must be very cautious
with your words and actions.

364
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:31,300
Don’t offend Junior Master Huo.

365
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,700
Don’t worry, Mr. Lin.

366
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,420
I hear everybody else goes there,

367
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:36,660
for the ripple pattern.

368
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:38,660
(Zhu Chen, Xingnan Sect)
We’re not interested in that.

369
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:40,420
We’ll be fine.

370
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,700
Brother.

371
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,610
Then why did you leave
all business behind

372
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:45,540
and come here
after receiving the invitation?

373
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:47,210
(Zhu Ying, Xingnan Sect)
We don’t have great martial arts.

374
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:49,610
(Zhu Ying, Xingnan Sect)
We can’t help much to fight the Demons.

375
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:51,250
Why must we come?

376
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:52,940
Ying, don’t talk nonsense.

377
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:56,010
Old Master Huo’s been nice to us.

378
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:57,180
Thanks to them,

379
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:59,580
we have no problem
doing business in the south.

380
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,180
We received the invitation.

381
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:01,940
Anyway,

382
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:04,090
we should come
and support Junior Master Huo.

383
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,970
What are you looking at?

384
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:28,900
It’s summer.

385
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,820
But that man is shivering with cold.

386
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:32,180
Is he sick?

387
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,610
Ying, go.

388
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:35,490
Take out a robe from our luggage

389
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:37,130
and give it to that man.

390
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,060
You’re trying to help people again.

391
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,010
My brother asked me to give this to you.

392
00:23:58,610 --> 00:23:59,540
Thank you.

393
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:02,850
Thank you.

394
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:03,900
You’re welcome.

395
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:29,660
(Lingling Inn)

396
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:44,700
Why are the coins so cold?

397
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:46,890
What are you doing? Robbing?

398
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:49,420
(Animal characters made by CG)

399
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:51,830
Go back.

400
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:52,660
(Animal characters made by CG)

401
00:24:55,620 --> 00:25:02,220
(Lingling Inn)

402
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:19,580
(Poisoner Ying Hecong)

403
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:29,060
(Lingling Inn)

404
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:47,060
Miss, how many of you are there?

405
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:48,010
Just me.

406
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:49,300
Come in, please.

407
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,010
Come on. This way, please.

408
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:19,180
Come in, please.

409
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:20,300
Young Master.

410
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:21,820
That girl killed people before.

411
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:23,010
Don’t stare at her.

412
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:31,460
Miss, are you with Cloud Ravine?

413
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,090
I’m with Blue Bat.

414
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:36,490
You’re just in time.

415
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:37,820
There was a customer,

416
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:40,330
looking like the man you’re after.

417
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:42,180
He left the coins.

418
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:47,610
They’re not special.

419
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:49,300
But when he gave them to me,

420
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:50,700
they were cold as ice.

421
00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:56,370
Where has he gone?

422
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:57,580
I’m sorry,

423
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:59,420
but I don’t know.

424
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:00,900
These days, people come and go

425
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:03,330
for the Demon-Extermination Assembly.

426
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:06,370
I’m afraid you can’t catch up with him.

427
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:08,090
But since he’s in town,

428
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:10,540
he needs accommodation and traffic.

429
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:13,660
Our business covers half of
the basic needs.

430
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:15,090
The man you’re after...

431
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:17,540
He could be negligent,
however careful he is.

432
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:20,130
Why don’t you stay in our inn

433
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:21,490
and wait for more news?

434
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:23,850
Fine.

435
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:25,370
Thanks, then.

436
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,820
Isn’t he supposed

437
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:34,460
to be in the south for sunlight?

438
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:38,210
Why did he come here?

439
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:49,400
Let’s sit there.

440
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:50,850
Waiter...

441
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:01,130
Get up. Get up.

442
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:03,250
I don’t like the food in this inn.

443
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:04,460
You tried any before?

444
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:06,060
I don’t like it.
Let’s try another restaurant.

445
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:08,300
Miss, our food tastes good.

446
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,460
Shut up!

447
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:13,130
I... I mean...

448
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:14,330
We’ll discuss about it

449
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:16,090
and order the dishes later.

450
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:17,210
Fine. Fine.

451
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:20,010
Sit down.

452
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,210
Who?

453
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:28,060
No one.

454
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:34,970
Zhou Fei!

455
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:36,940
What are you doing?

456
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:38,130
What are you doing?

457
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:39,820
I want to challenge her.

458
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:41,130
We come for
the Demon-Extermination Assembly.

459
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:42,130
If you challenge her,

460
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:42,970
she’ll see us!

461
00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:44,130
Bonehead!

462
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,180
We?

463
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:47,660
You come for it, right?

464
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:49,970
I only come to challenge Zhou Fei!

465
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:53,300
Don’t go.

466
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:58,060
(Lingling Inn)

467
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:30,900
Who are they?

468
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:33,090
They’re with Four-guardian Mountain.

469
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:35,420
I met them once.

470
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:37,940
They’re with Tortoise Master.

471
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:42,940
They look strange.

472
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:45,210
Why are they wearing the mourning?

473
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:48,940
I hear Tortoise Master Ding Kui

474
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:51,210
isn’t a good man.

475
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:11,610
Are you from Xingnan Sect?

476
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:13,850
We have something important to tell you.

477
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:16,130
Give us the invitation

478
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:17,420
for the Demon-Extermination Assembly.

479
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:21,700
Robbing in the inn in broad daylight?

480
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,090
How lawless you are!

481
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:25,780
We want the invitation,

482
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:27,370
just because we don’t like it

483
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:30,730
when you run errands
for Huo Liantao, the hypocrite.

484
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:34,730
When he’s holding
the Demon-Extermination Assembly,

485
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:37,130
you even bring a cart of gifts to him.

486
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:39,580
Will your cousin

487
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:41,970
help those people?

488
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:44,940
She’s here looking for Xie Yun,
instead of fighting.

489
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:46,660
They’re having a dog-fight.

490
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:48,060
Why must she interfere?

491
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:51,210
You want to interfere?

492
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:52,180
You...!

493
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:55,580
We’re just passing by

494
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:58,010
and teasing Huo Liantao’s dogs.

495
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:00,570
What?

496
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:03,370
Our sect is famous
for martial arts, too.

497
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:04,940
Stop slandering us!

498
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:07,420
Young girl.

499
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:09,180
Who are you?

500
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:11,210
When Old Master Zhu was in charge,

501
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:14,460
your family could barely
be a famous sect.

502
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:17,610
Since he was paralyzed in bed,

503
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,660
you’ve failed to do martial arts

504
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:23,180
and have even done business for living.

505
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:26,210
How can you still say
you’re martial artists?

506
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:28,090
Oh, look at the invalid.

507
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:29,820
He could never practice martial arts.

508
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,900
He’s as weak as a girl.

509
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:33,850
I mean, not even as weak as a girl.

510
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:36,370
No wonder you must ingratiate yourselves
with Huo Liantao.

511
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:38,540
Without his help,

512
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:41,820
your family would have disappeared.

513
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:43,380
Ying.

514
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:49,490
I don’t care when you slander me.

515
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:51,420
But when you slander Junior Master Huo

516
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:53,850
in Lingling Town,

517
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:55,490
don’t you fear you’ll cause problem?

518
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:57,180
Problem?

519
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:59,660
Don’t you know

520
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:01,370
how he became the master of Huo’s Manor?

521
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:03,060
Even before

522
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:04,330
the Demons arrived,

523
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:07,610
Huo Liantao ran away with fear,

524
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:10,090
leaving his huge properties behind.

525
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:13,130
How shameless he is!

526
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:14,900
And he dares

527
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:18,300
to send out invitations?

528
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:21,330
You’d better give us the invitation,

529
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:22,300
so that we can challenge Huo Liantao

530
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:26,540
on your behalf.

531
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:34,420
Young man, don’t be nervous.

532
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,900
I won’t eat your young master.

533
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:41,970
Since you’re Junior Master Huo’s enemy，

534
00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:43,460
you can fight with him.

535
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:45,210
We are mere businessmen.

536
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:46,900
And we haven’t offended you.

537
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,420
When you don’t dare
to fight him directly,

538
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:49,460
you give vent on us.

539
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:50,660
What do you think you’re doing?

540
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:52,900
Bullying the weak
and being scare of the strong?

541
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:56,460
You think you can bully
whoever you want?

542
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:58,250
Let me say it again.

543
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:00,250
Give me the invitation,

544
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:03,250
and I’ll let you go.

545
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:05,820
The invitation is for my family.

546
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:06,970
Even if you kill me,

547
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:08,010
I won’t give it to you

548
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:09,700
in case you deceive others!

549
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:10,730
Evil!

550
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:11,940
You defamed my family

551
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,610
and hurt our men so brutally!

552
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:20,940
Mr. Zhu.

553
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:24,130
Which matters more,
your sister or the invitation?

554
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:26,210
Think carefully about it.

555
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:27,730
Let go of my sister!

556
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:35,740
(Wealth and Fortune)

557
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:40,300
(Wealth and Fortune)

558
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:51,130
On my way here, I heard a lot

559
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:52,580
that the Demon-Extermination Assembly

560
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:54,660
was exactly for treasure-grabbing.

561
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:57,180
Huo Liantao printed the ripple pattern

562
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:58,460
on the invitations,

563
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:00,780
calling on people to grab the treasure.

564
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:02,090
How come?

565
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:04,900
How does Huo Liantao
have the ripple pattern?

566
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:06,780
If he has it,
why doesn’t he keep it to himself?

567
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,330
Cousin.

568
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:09,940
Then why did those men
with Tortoise Master

569
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:11,770
snatch the invitation?

570
00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:13,460
Go ask the master of Xingnan Sect

571
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:16,130
if there’s the ripple pattern
on the invitation.

572
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,290
You’re the master of Xingnan Sect?

573
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:27,220
No, no, no.

574
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:29,370
I’m from the Zhu family.

575
00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:30,610
I’m Zhu Chen.

576
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,810
My father is the master of our sect.

577
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:34,900
He was a great man.

578
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:37,810
But he suffered a sneak attack
on his way to business.

579
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:40,220
So far, he’s been paralyzed in bed.

580
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:45,050
So you’re the young master
of Xingnan Sect?

581
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:49,370
Huo Liantao sent you an invitation?

582
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:50,180
Yes.

583
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:51,370
Yes.

584
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:54,770
I’ve been weak since I was born
and don’t have martial arts.

585
00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:57,610
For my father and sister,
I must reply on Huo’s Manor

586
00:34:57,610 --> 00:34:59,850
and do business within their territory.

587
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:00,570
This time,

588
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:03,130
I come to support Master Huo.

589
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:04,810
Oh,

590
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:07,810
thank you for saving us.

591
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:10,260
May I know your name?

592
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:12,290
Zhou Fei,
with the Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

593
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:14,220
Li Yan,
with the Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

594
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:17,530
Don’t be scared.

595
00:35:17,530 --> 00:35:19,420
I just want to have a look.

596
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:20,810
I won’t snatch your invitation.

597
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,220
It’s okay.

598
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:23,090
Mr. Lin.

599
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:43,060
(From Huo Liantao with Huo’s Manor)

600
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:45,460
He’s really after this.

601
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:46,460
Who?

602
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:50,700
Thanks.

603
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:52,570
Miss.

604
00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:55,180
Sorry for disturbing your meal.

605
00:35:55,850 --> 00:35:58,020
I’ve prepared some snacks from Jiankang

606
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,610
just to show our gratitude.

607
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:01,260
No, thanks.

608
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:02,290
I’m not hungry.

609
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:04,740
I’m hungry.

610
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:06,420
Thank you for this.

611
00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:10,260
Waiter.

612
00:36:10,570 --> 00:36:11,330
Be right there.

613
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:26,050
Mr. Qian Suiyou, why are you here alone?

614
00:36:34,850 --> 00:36:36,570
Madam Nichang?

615
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:40,420
Long time no see. What a coincidence!

616
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:41,700
It is?

617
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,740
We come here for the same purpose,
don’t we?

618
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:45,020
It can’t be a coincidence.

619
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:49,220
Don’t say it out,

620
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:50,810
or it’ll be boring.

621
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:56,460
I just come to see the fun.

622
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:04,090
He’s here
for the Demon-Extermination Assembly.

623
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:06,500
Can you find him asap?

624
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:08,810
Lately, martial artists from all places
have come into Lingling Town

625
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:11,290
for the Demon-Extermination Assembly.

626
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:13,900
Even if you know he’s also going for it,

627
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:16,220
I’m afraid it’ll take much time

628
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:18,130
to find him among so many people.

629
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:20,130
The man you’re after is sly.

630
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:21,940
He keeps hiding himself from us.

631
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:24,050
I’ve exhausted my tricks.

632
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:28,500
-Well...
-Miss, if you’re anxious,

633
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:30,290
I’ll ask our elders

634
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:31,570
to think of a way

635
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:33,050
and send more men for help.

636
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:34,700
Thank you.

637
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:51,610
How delicious!

638
00:37:57,330 --> 00:37:59,220
Fei, come over!

639
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:01,660
Famous snacks in Jiankang
are true to their names!

640
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:03,020
Come over. Come.

641
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:07,770
Among all great restaurants,

642
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:09,050
half are in Jiankang.

643
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:14,130
Miss Zhou, you know this saying.

644
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:15,850
Have you visited Jiankang before?

645
00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:18,020
When there’s a chance,

646
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:19,940
I’ll invite you to Jiankang.

647
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:21,460
Among all great restaurants,

648
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:22,980
half are in Jiankang.

649
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:26,090
I haven’t gone there before.

650
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:29,740
I have a friend fastidious about food.

651
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,130
He’s from Jiankang.

652
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:33,770
Fei.

653
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:35,900
Do you mean Mr. Xie?

654
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:38,700
Mr. Xie?

655
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:44,090
Focus on your food.

656
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:48,900
Why are you alone now?

657
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:51,180
Where is Fei?

658
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:55,980
I’m used to travelling alone.

659
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:57,460
Well,

660
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:00,020
it’s troublesome to bring a girl.

661
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:01,980
Hurting my cool image.

662
00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:12,260
Really?

663
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:16,130
Denying true thoughts

664
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:18,330
isn’t a good habit for young men.

665
00:39:18,330 --> 00:39:20,050
You will miss her,

666
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:21,330
perhaps.

667
00:39:21,330 --> 00:39:23,220
How come?

668
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:24,700
I’m just busy avoiding her.

669
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:25,570
Avoiding?

670
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,810
Speaking of avoiding,

671
00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:32,050
you’re avoiding
only when she looks for you.

672
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:34,090
Are you sure she’s looking for you?

673
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:39,180
What?

674
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:42,810
You always have a glib tongue.

675
00:39:42,810 --> 00:39:44,260
Now you can’t argue?

676
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:49,700
Young man.

677
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:51,740
Don’t deceive yourself.

678
00:39:58,260 --> 00:39:59,660
When we’re fated
to have no happy ending,

679
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:01,740
what else can I do

680
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:03,940
except avoiding her?

681
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,020
Madam Nichang.

682
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,610
I’ve got something else to do. See you.

683
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:17,130
If I have new lyrics,

684
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:18,700
I’ll go see you in Yuyi Troupe.

685
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:27,020
Qian Suiyou.

686
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:32,180
Don’t always bother about the ending.

687
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:34,850
The ending you want
may not be what others want.

688
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:37,770
Why don’t you just follow your heart?

689
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:03,500
Go.

690
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:12,260
Miss Zhou has also
come to Lingling Town.

691
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:13,330
What a coincidence!

692
00:41:13,330 --> 00:41:14,420
It’s not a coincidence.

693
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:17,570
All martial artists have come here

694
00:41:17,570 --> 00:41:19,460
for the Demon-Extermination Assembly.

695
00:41:20,570 --> 00:41:23,220
Our young master also...

696
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:25,180
You have the nerve to say that?

697
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:28,900
Unfortunately, Miss Zhou is
also looking for Mr. Xie.

698
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:33,700
Why is Zichen in Lingling Town?

699
00:41:41,570 --> 00:41:43,740
She isn’t staying with him?

700
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:45,700
Since Mr. Xie isn’t with her,

701
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:47,220
why do you need to meet her?

702
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:49,130
What if she knows something?

703
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:51,330
Oh,

704
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:53,290
when you see her,

705
00:41:53,290 --> 00:41:54,420
show some respect.

706
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:57,260
If she hadn’t helped us out,

707
00:41:57,420 --> 00:42:00,370
we wouldn’t have run away from Huarong.

708
00:42:00,370 --> 00:42:01,130
Aye.

709
00:42:23,530 --> 00:42:24,660
Who is it?

710
00:42:50,050 --> 00:42:50,850
Xie Yun?

711
00:42:53,570 --> 00:42:54,770
You freaked me out.

712
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:57,570
Zichen.

713
00:42:57,740 --> 00:42:59,180
I waited for a long time.

714
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:00,090
I can finally come in,

715
00:43:00,090 --> 00:43:01,420
when Mr. Bai is away.

716
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:03,810
Time is running out. I’ll be brief.

717
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:06,130
Why must you come in

718
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:07,660
when Mr. Bai is away?

719
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:11,610
Because he’s with Route Gang.

720
00:43:11,610 --> 00:43:13,420
He’s looking for me
throughout the town.

721
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:14,740
If Mr. Bai sees us,

722
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:16,220
I’ll be biting the hook.

723
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:18,050
Why are they...

724
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:20,090
Don’t ask why they’re looking for me.

725
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:23,330
Tell me. Why do you come here?

726
00:43:23,330 --> 00:43:25,290
Did Huo Liantao invite you?

727
00:43:29,330 --> 00:43:31,050
Not really.

728
00:43:31,050 --> 00:43:33,700
Junior Master Huo is holding
the Demon-Extermination Assembly.

729
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:36,130
I’d like to take this chance

730
00:43:36,130 --> 00:43:38,050
to learn from Lord Mengchang
in the ancient time

731
00:43:38,050 --> 00:43:40,220
so that I can unite
righteous martial artists

732
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:41,900
and win their trust.

733
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:43,610
It won’t do harm, anyway.

734
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:46,770
There aren’t many righteous men.

735
00:43:46,770 --> 00:43:48,020
Even if there were some,

736
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:50,180
they wouldn’t come to such an assembly.

737
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:51,180
Why?

738
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:52,810
Stop asking why.

739
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:55,090
There’s much trouble in Lingling Town.

740
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:56,260
When Mr. Bai comes back,

741
00:43:56,610 --> 00:43:57,660
leave right away.

742
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:01,260
Why can you come

743
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:02,530
and why can’t I?

744
00:44:02,530 --> 00:44:02,980
Why...?

745
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:04,290
Stop.

746
00:44:04,290 --> 00:44:06,050
Why do you have so many questions?

747
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:07,980
Anyway, this is all I can tell you.

748
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:10,290
I’ll ask no more, then.

749
00:44:13,810 --> 00:44:14,810
Xie Yun.

750
00:44:15,050 --> 00:44:17,330
Why don’t you go with us?

751
00:44:17,330 --> 00:44:18,700
When you and Mr. Bai go with me

752
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:20,610
and Junior Master Huo is an old friend,

753
00:44:20,610 --> 00:44:21,740
I don’t need to be scared.

754
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:22,570
Look.

755
00:44:22,850 --> 00:44:24,370
I’ve stayed in your room for a while.

756
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:26,260
But no men with Mr. Bai have found me.

757
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:28,260
You really think you’re safe?

758
00:44:29,050 --> 00:44:30,660
Mr. Bai just told me

759
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:32,900
Miss Zhou was in Lingling Town.

760
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:33,940
He has gone to pick her up.

761
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:35,090
When they’re back, I’ll be safe.

762
00:44:35,090 --> 00:44:36,260
What?

763
00:44:36,370 --> 00:44:37,700
Fei has come?

764
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:38,810
Yeah.

765
00:44:38,810 --> 00:44:39,980
Xie Yun, you know what?

766
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:41,570
She’s the heir of South Blade.

767
00:44:41,570 --> 00:44:42,700
Mr. Bai said

768
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:44,050
when we were in Huarong,

769
00:44:44,050 --> 00:44:45,740
Miss Zhou helped us

770
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:47,090
and held back the Demons.

771
00:44:47,090 --> 00:44:48,420
Otherwise, we wouldn’t have...

772
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:52,500
Xie Yun?

773
00:44:57,770 --> 00:44:58,810
This way, please.

774
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:00,700
Elder Bai has come.

775
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:02,260
He said you saved him

776
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:04,180
and he’d like to visit you personally.

777
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:05,330
Elder Bai?

778
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:16,940
Miss Zhou, thank you
for helping us last time.

779
00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:18,290
You’re welcome, Mr. Bai.

780
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:19,570
I wonder

781
00:45:19,570 --> 00:45:21,500
what you want me for.

782
00:45:22,130 --> 00:45:25,020
I hear you’re looking for Mr. Xie.

783
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:26,940
Well, we’re looking for him, too.

784
00:45:27,130 --> 00:45:29,770
But he’s too mysterious to be found.

785
00:45:29,770 --> 00:45:31,850
We only know
he has come to Lingling Town.

786
00:45:31,850 --> 00:45:32,660
Yes.

787
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:35,660
I was just informed

788
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:38,130
that he would go
to the Demon-Extermination Assembly.

789
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:39,980
You’re also looking for him?

790
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:40,610
Yes.

791
00:45:40,610 --> 00:45:42,180
Why do you want him for?

792
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:44,290
To tell the truth, Miss Zhou,

793
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:47,810
Prince Zichen heard
of the ripple pattern

794
00:45:47,810 --> 00:45:48,900
and insisted on coming to Lingling Town

795
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:51,370
for the Demon-Extermination Assembly.

796
00:45:51,850 --> 00:45:53,940
None of us managed to stop him.

797
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:55,570
We think

798
00:45:55,570 --> 00:45:56,980
if Mr. Xie could help to persuade him,

799
00:45:56,980 --> 00:45:58,260
that would be great.
