=Episode 17=

17
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:44,800
Why are you so nervous?

18
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,170
Aren’t you a hunter?

19
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,420
It hurts!

20
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,440
Your hands are really strong.

21
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,180
-Your hands are really strong.
-Lord.

22
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,040
There are seven to eight obvious traps

23
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,870
within a hundred paces ahead.

24
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:58,400
As for the hidden ones…

25
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,680
See?

26
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,040
I didn’t lie.

27
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,180
Change to another path.

28
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:05,220
Don’t delay our important matter.

29
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:11,510
How dare you say it’s a short cut
to Hengyang?

30
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,080
Bastard.

31
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,390
Let’s go.

32
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:25,540
Thanks.

33
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:28,910
See you.

34
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:40,560
Miss Wu, come out now.

35
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:52,880
Thanks for your help.

36
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:57,530
Is your injury all right?

37
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,620
Yes, it’s OK.

38
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:02,950
Miss Wu!

39
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,120
General.

40
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,550
Who are you?

41
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:11,670
General, he helped me to hide

42
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:12,910
from the Demons.

43
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:15,000
Demons?

44
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,830
Thanks for your help.

45
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:20,270
May I have your name?

46
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,820
Not at all.

47
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:24,660
Miss Wu, where is your family?

48
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,830
Why is there only one man escorting you?

49
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:30,630
You know it?

50
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,340
General, don’t worry.

51
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,320
Since he knows me,

52
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,800
he must know the ropes.

53
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,860
He should be on our side.

54
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:40,390
I have to thank him for saving me.

55
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,600
Sir,

56
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,440
let me give your sword back.

57
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,910
Don’t say that.

58
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:51,670
It’s my duty.

59
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,000
I’m from the Fortress
of the Forty-Eight.

60
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,000
Our elders ordered us

61
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,440
to reinforce your family.

62
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,720
So I saw your portrait
before I came here

63
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,080
and recognized you.

64
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,550
I see.

65
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:03,980
Do you know Fei?

66
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:05,280
Of course!

67
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:08,060
You have met her?

68
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:10,120
Where are she and other people?

69
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:12,910
It’s a long story.

70
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:15,110
Fei is now in Hengyang city.

71
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:16,670
She asked this general

72
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:18,230
to send me back to Lord Gantang.

73
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:20,620
Lord Gantang?

74
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,600
You’re going to my uncle,

75
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,760
Zhou Yitang?

76
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,700
So, you’re Fei’s cousin?

77
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:29,730
Yeah.

78
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,880
Then, that’s to say,

79
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,600
you are

80
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,790
the nephew of Leader Li of the Fortress,

81
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:36,300
and the grandson of
the South Blade Li Zheng?

82
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:37,630
Yes.

83
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,480
That’s great! Mr. Li.

84
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,670
I’m Wen Yu,

85
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:44,130
vice-general of Lord Gantang.

86
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,040
Wen Yu, General Feiqing?

87
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,200
General Wen, just now

88
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,350
Gu Tianxian from the Demons Manor
appeared here.

89
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:00,510
We need to leave here now

90
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:02,230
or we may be in trouble.

91
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,550
The one who came was Gu Tianxian?

92
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:06,880
Yes, I saw the token.

93
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,050
They came with unknown purposes.

94
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:14,040
Mr. Li, please come back with me

95
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,970
and tell this to Lord Gantang.

96
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,720
No, General Wen,

97
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,830
I heard that they were going to Hengyang.

98
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:25,110
I’m afraid
they will cause trouble there.

99
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:26,880
I think you have to tell this

100
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,320
to my uncle first

101
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,710
and ask them to get prepared.

102
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:32,880
What about you?

103
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,720
It’s not far from the Fortress.

104
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,830
I can take Ms. Wu to hide while walking.

105
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,230
We can be back there soon.

106
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:39,110
It’s not proper.

107
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:40,670
One of you is General Wu’s daughter,

108
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:42,270
the other is Lord Gantang’s nephew.

109
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:44,790
I can’t put you in danger.

110
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:45,720
General Wen.

111
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,070
Our safety or the safety of people
in Hengyang,

112
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:48,870
which is more important?

113
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,550
General Wen,

114
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:55,410
Mr. Li is right.

115
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,830
We can’t let them have the chance.

116
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:01,350
If they want something in Hengyang,

117
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:02,990
the people there will be
in great danger.

118
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,460
What’s more,

119
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,790
Fei is also in Hengyang.

120
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,670
In this case,

121
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:10,480
you have to go back as soon as possible.

122
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,790
Be careful on the way back.

123
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:14,930
Miss Wu,

124
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:16,290
here you are.

125
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,230
Thank you, General.

126
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,830
See you. Take care.

127
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:27,680
Miss Wu, please.

128
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:33,020
(Hengyang)

129
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:41,470
Xie,

130
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:44,160
where are we?

131
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,600
Fei, we are in Hengyang now.

132
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,000
Hang in there.

133
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,440
Sir, if you don’t need anything else,

134
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,670
I’m leaving.

135
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:54,640
Wait. Sir.

136
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,000
Have you ever heard

137
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,830
that there is a troupe in Hengyang?

138
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,350
Troupe?

139
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:00,620
I haven’t heard about it.

140
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:07,160
Why don’t you think carefully

141
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,330
if anyone once talked about it?

142
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,760
Come to think of it,

143
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,980
it really reminds me of something.

144
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:14,600
Days ago,

145
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,790
I heard some customers talking about it.

146
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:17,950
They said

147
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:19,350
there is an opera troupe,

148
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:20,070
which is originally

149
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:22,040
a native one here in Hengyang.

150
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,200
But they always perform out of the city.

151
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,440
Even though, they are still

152
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,510
so famous.

153
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:30,160
If you are not from a noble family,

154
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,510
you can’t even see their backs.

155
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:35,040
Do you know where they are now?

156
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:35,950
Look,

157
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:37,390
I’m just a waiter.

158
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,040
How could I know that?

159
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:40,650
Alright.

160
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:42,600
Help me find it out.

161
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,750
If you get any information,

162
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,480
I will give you a double.

163
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:47,530
OK! Thank you, sir.

164
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:04,670
Fei, are you alright?

165
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:06,510
Do you want to eat something?

166
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:08,670
Or you want some more sleep?

167
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:10,950
Why are you looking for that troupe?

168
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,880
Only the leader of the troupe,
Madam Nichang,

169
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,830
can help you with your injury.

170
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:24,600
You took the trouble to bring me here

171
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,040
just because only she can help me?

172
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:31,200
Alright. Don’t worry.

173
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,740
I’m not worrying.

174
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,730
I’m not the one looking for her.

175
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:40,470
I guess Yun must be thinking

176
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:42,000
why such a mysterious person

177
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,390
should save you.

178
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:47,550
That’s a terrible name.

179
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:48,670
Stop calling me that.

180
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:53,440
You can still get angry?

181
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,150
That means you’re not really worrying.

182
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,470
Don’t forget that

183
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:04,510
I’m the famous Qian Suiyou.

184
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,320
Later

185
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,710
I will go meet them.

186
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,280
What’s your relationship with

187
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,410
that leader?

188
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,830
Why are you so sure that

189
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,440
she can help you to save me,

190
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,030
a person she doesn’t even know?

191
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,230
Of course it will cost me a lot,

192
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:32,670
but they are just a bunch of opera girls

193
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:34,440
and they can’t do anything to me.

194
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,390
That’s right.

195
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:47,350
Yun is worrying that

196
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:48,510
to save you,

197
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:51,080
I would be forced

198
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,330
to marry those girls?

199
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,710
Go now.

200
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:56,520
Hurry up and return the name of Yun

201
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,350
to its rightful owner.

202
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:01,450
You’re still so fierce.

203
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,810
Alright, I will go find them right now.

204
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,710
Fei?

205
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,320
Fei.

206
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,400
Are you alright?

207
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:16,790
I’m OK.

208
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:18,700
Just go.

209
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,570
OK.

210
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:28,820
Wait for me. I’ll be back soon.

211
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:48,770
Wait.

212
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:52,330
I can’t get in there like this.

213
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:10,340
(Chunsheng Rouge Shop)

214
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:17,840
This is the Qian Suiyou they know.

(Chunsheng Rouge Shop)

216
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,690
Mr. Wang.

217
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:34,280
Qian Suiyou?

218
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,180
Did you write any new script?

219
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:41,190
The price I can give you

220
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,010
is still the same.

221
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,590
I haven’t written any new scripts.

222
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:48,110
Please wait for a few more days.

223
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:50,110
I will come to you then.

224
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:51,840
I won’t break the rules.

225
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:54,790
Then, why are you here today?

226
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,880
I heard Yuyi Troupe has come back.

227
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,200
Where are they?

228
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,960
They are not in Hengyang.

229
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,670
You… You should go now.

230
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:06,670
Leave. Just leave.

231
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:07,840
Leave now! Go!

232
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,710
Mr. Wang…

233
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:10,110
-Don’t ask about them again.
-Mr. Wang…

234
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:11,230
(Chunsheng Rouge Shop)
Go now!

235
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,030
Mr. Wang!

236
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:27,550
Lord.

237
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,880
Did you hear anything from Second Lord?

238
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,110
They are on the way.

239
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,150
We’ve been kept in touch.

240
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:34,840
Please don’t worry.

241
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,820
OK.

242
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Waiter,

243
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,670
have you cleaned up the room upstairs?

244
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:41,880
They are still cleaning.
It will be ready soon.

245
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:42,550
By the way, is there

246
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:45,080
any troupe performing in Hengyang?

247
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,030
Troupe?

248
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:48,020
Why are people all asking about it?

249
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,640
Recently, there is a troupe

250
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,150
which was always out of the city

251
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:52,080
came back to Hengyang.

252
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:54,100
But no one knows where they are.

253
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,430
Wait.

254
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,150
Sir, what can I do for you?

255
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,030
You just said

256
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:05,550
that people all asked you that?

257
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:07,000
Who else

258
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,470
asked you about the troupe?

259
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,110
No. No one.

260
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:14,110
OK. I will tell you.

261
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,280
Lingyu.

262
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:32,710
There is no blood on Li’s body.

263
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:35,230
He died when someone broke his neck.

264
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,000
Who is that bold?

265
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,550
Daring to hurt our people?

266
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:41,790
The Demons came to the city.

267
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:44,670
We have lost two secret services.

268
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:45,960
That’s why Master asked us

269
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,080
(Lingyu Yuyi Troupe)
to keep an eye on the other two.

270
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,590
Didn’t I tell you not to

271
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:51,550
slack off for a moment?

272
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,200
Li went into the room

273
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,470
to get some water.

274
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:57,440
We didn’t care about it at first.

275
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,880
Later we found something wrong

276
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,790
and came to the back alley,

277
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:00,640
but he had already…

278
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,150
Where is the Yuling Token?

279
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,020
It’s lost.

280
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:06,350
Go to report this to our master.

281
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:07,990
You can do this, can’t you?

282
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,280
Come back to me after
you deal with the body.

283
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,000
Yes.

00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:06,400
Didn’t I tell you to keep an eye
on the Rouge Shop?

294
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,670
Something bad must have happened.

295
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:15,760
Come on.

296
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,290
Weird. Why is the door open?

298
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:46,440
It’s all my fault. I got him killed.

It’s not the right time to say that.

300

Same cause of death with Li.

301
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,600
And all their tokens are missing.

302
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,190
Why are you here?

303
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:19,040
I came to give Mr. Wang

00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,190
my new scripts.

00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,560
But I got knocked out

307
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,230
right after I came in.

308
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:30,920
And then I found I was tied up
after I woke up.

309
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,220
Who is it? Did you see it?

No.

Please untie me first.

Wait.

313
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,110
Keep his hands tied. Untie his feet.

314

Why…

315
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,680
Why is that?

316
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,880
Come back to Qiaoyun House with me

to see Madam Nichang.

321

Why in such a hurry?

It’s only a few blocks away.

323

But I don’t have enough strength.

324
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,390
Qian Suiyou,

325
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,400
what’s your new script about?

326
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,950
A story happened on a battlefield.

327
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:23,110
Did you take it with you? Show me.

328
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:26,800
It’s with me.

329
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,040
Please take it yourself.

330
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,520
Nothing.

331
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:42,110
Nothing?

332
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,400
How could it be?

333
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,830
It’s impossible!

334
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:50,520
I haven’t even made

335
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,800
a copy of it yet.

336
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,680
Did I

337
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,520
drop it in the rouge shop?

338
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,640
How about

339
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,680
I go to find it with you?

340
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:04,760
Well…

341
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,590
It will be

342
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:09,350
a waste of time.

343
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,800
How about this?

344
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,110
Let me tell Madam Nichang

345
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:13,800
about the story first

346
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,760
to see if she likes it.

347
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,520
Now you

348
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,490
don’t worry about your new script?

349
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,320
Qian Suiyou, you can go now.

350
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,990
You’re not an old man at all.

351
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,640
Stop pretending.

352
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,950
Ouch! It hurts!

353
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,110
I…

354
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,760
I just make a living by this.

355
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,310
If it’s really like what you said,

356
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:37,880
the murderer couldn’t keep you alive.

357
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,040
So, when you got in there,

358
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,710
Mr. Wang had already died.

359
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:42,350
You hid in the corner

360
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:44,280
just to let the two of us find you

361
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,800
so you can go with us.

362
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,570
Say it! What’s your intention?

363
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:52,790
You don’t suspect me of killing him?

364
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:55,760
First,

365
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,640
you’re Madam’s old acquaintance.

366
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,880
I don’t think you have any motive
to kill him.

367
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,520
Second,

368
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,110
I checked your pulse.

369
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:05,040
You have no inner force at all.

370
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,830
Mr. Wang is

371
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,040
stronger than you.

372
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,760
Say it.

373
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,180
What do you want to do?

374
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:18,210
Since you’re from the Yuyi Troupe,

375
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:20,160
I will tell you the truth.

376
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:23,540
One friend of mine got seriously ill.

377
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:26,110
What does it have to do with us?

378
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:27,640
Only the Floating Palm of Madam Nichang

379
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,920
can save my friend.

380
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,470
Why should we save your friend?

381
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:32,060
I have the thing Madam Nichang wants.

382
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,950
Then, give me that.

383
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:36,800
I can give it to Madam for you.

384
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,180
You can’t go to our troupe.

385
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:42,280
Forget it.

386
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,400
Since you have nothing with you,

387
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,190
I will take the message for you.

388
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:46,480
Lingbo, let’s go.

389
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:49,120
Miss…

390
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,500
Lingbo!

391
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:53,590
Lingyu, it’s OK.

392
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:55,910
I just don’t want him to follow us.

393
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:57,400
In this case,

394
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,590
please forgive us for being rude.

395
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:02,040
Qian Suiyou, don’t pester us.

396
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:11,680
Figured cloth.

397
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,760
New cloth, have a look.

398
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:24,310
Figured cloth.

399
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,100
Please come and have a look.

400
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,180
(Qiaoyun House)

401
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,280
Qiaoyun House.

402
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:38,920
Thanks to you,

403
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,430
that knockout drop didn’t work on me.

404
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:42,760
But, please don’t cause trouble

405
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,380
at such a critical time.

406
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:02,710
Qian Suiyou?

407
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:03,840
That’s right.

408
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,060
There is no time for him now.

409
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:10,230
This time we found the track

410
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:12,310
of the Demons in advance.

411
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:14,630
But we still lost four secret services.

412
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:17,020
Looks like they

413
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:20,110
just came here for us.

414
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:22,280
These days we will check the guests

415
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:24,370
with Yuling Token strictly.

416
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:27,160
The Demons did that

417
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:30,780
only to show us

418
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,830
they have come.

419
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:36,400
Lord.

420
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,240
Any news of the troupe?

421
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:42,980
Lord,

422
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:44,880
we destroyed four secret services
of them

423
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,470
and got three Yuling Tokens.

424
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:48,560
And we caught three of their scouts.

425
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,360
But…

426
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:51,400
They all died?

427
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:54,470
They refused to say anything

428
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:56,070
and then committed suicide.

429
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:57,350
I’m incompetent.

430
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:58,720
I beg your pardon.

431
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,520
An opera actress

432
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:07,250
can even earn their loyalty like this.

433
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,910
Madam Nichang deserves her fame.

434
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,240
If I guessed it right,

435
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,460
only the leader of the Demons,
Shen Tianshu,

436
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:22,310
has the style to do things in this way.

437
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:23,710
Then, Master,

438
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:26,560
let’s cancel the performance today.

439
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,280
I’m afraid.

440
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,230
Don’t.

441
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:31,330
Just hold it as usual.

442
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,920
Yes, Master.

443
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:40,920
It’s all you can do.

444
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:43,820
Thank you, Lord.

445
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:45,580
But we lost the clue.

446
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:47,330
What should we do next?

447
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,730
Hengyang is such a big city.

448
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,810
If Nichang is on her guard,

449
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,180
it’ll be harder to find her.

450
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:06,230
Any flower?

451
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:07,520
No, thanks.

452
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,020
Have a look. Fresh flowers.

453
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:44,470
Fei.

454
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:46,760
Fei.

455
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,760
Why did you get up?

456
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,760
I’m waiting for you.

457
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:54,190
Don’t worry.

458
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:56,160
I’m always lucky. I won’t die.

459
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:57,710
OK.

460
00:24:57,710 --> 00:24:59,520
Let me take you to Madam Nichang now.

461
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:11,460
(Hengyang)

462
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:15,050
Lord, should we take actions now?

463
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,640
Keep an eye on them

464
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,590
to see where they are going.

465
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:23,210
Don’t alert them.

466
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,380
Yes.

468
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,520
It’s OK with me.

469
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,170
But Fei can’t waste any time.

470
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:42,200

any other entrance.

Yes, of course.

00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:39,610
Come with me.

517
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:41,010
Thank you.

You can come over only when
Madam calls you.

Miss,

524
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
how long will she keep singing?

525
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:28,950
Why in a hurry?

526
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:30,280
It’s not finished yet.

527
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,350
Just wait.

Madam!

00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,280
Madam!

My sister and I got hunted down
by the Demons.

Guys, the Demons are here.

Please escape now.

534
00:28:58,470 --> 00:28:59,640
-Hunted down by the Demons?
-The Demons are here?

535
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,710
-The Demons?
-Oh, no!

536
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:03,280
Madam!

Thanks for your coming.

00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:14,160
This is all for today’s

540
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,430
performance.

541
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:16,510
Welcome next time.

542
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:21,830
-Come on, let’s go.
-What a wet blanket.

543
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:31,050
Sir, you can come with me.

544
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:40,660
(Elegant and quiet courtyard)
Madam,

545
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,920
sorry for driving away your guests.

546
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,400
I had no other choices.

547
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,510
Please forgive me.

548
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:50,190
If not for the new scripts,

549
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:52,350
I will never let you go.

550
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:53,880
Am I right?

551
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,680
Qian Suiyou.

552
00:29:58,190 --> 00:30:00,280
Madam, you do have sharp eyes.

553
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:02,190
I came today

554
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:04,640
for a life and death matter.

555
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:08,590
My sister got Yellow and Green Spirit
from Duan Jiuniang,

556
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:10,390
which can’t stay with her own power
in peace.

557
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:13,660
Only your Floating Palm can save her.

558
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:19,530
Qian Suiyou, I think you got confused.

559
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:22,320
Why should I save someone I don’t know?

560
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,680
As long as you can save her,

561
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,560
I can take any price.

562
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,560
Any price?

563
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:40,470
I’m afraid she is not your sister.

564
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:46,230
I didn’t expect you to be such
a spoony man.

565
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:50,000
Alright, I will just tell you directly

566
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,430
that no matter what you do,

567
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:52,620
I will never help her.

568
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:56,230
See them out.

569
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:59,030
Please.

570
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:01,880
Madam.

571
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:03,880
She is the heir of the South Blade.

572
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:21,380
Heir of South Blade?

573
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,010
Miss, let me ask you.

574
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,020
What’s your relationship with Li Zheng?

575
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:30,710
What’s your relationship with Li Zheng?

576
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:31,280
Fei.

577
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:35,660
He is my grandpa.

578
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:41,710
Master, if you want to save her,

579
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:43,680
if will cost most of your power.

580
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,280
It’s too dangerous!

581
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,470
Yeah, Master.

582
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:47,760
Now the Demons

583
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,000
are also after us.

584
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,760
You shouldn’t be in danger.

585
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,160
Enough.

586
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,920
Take them to the guest room.

587
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:57,950
Go now.

588
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:01,280
Please come with me.

589
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:04,000
Thank you, Madam.

590
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,880
Heir of South Blade.

591
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,520
The South Blade got an offspring!

592
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:44,120
Thank you.

593
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:49,640
I don’t want to be here.

594
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,040
Let’s leave.

595
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:58,710
It’s so cold.

596
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:00,780
No. Your inner forces are getting
messier and messier.

597
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:02,710
How do you feel?

598
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:03,760
So cold.

599
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:07,340
Do you feel better now?

600
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,040
Come in, please.

601
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,910
My master can’t save her.

602
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,020
Is this what your master said?

603
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,520
Miss, what are you doing?

604
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:38,810
Please spare Yuyi Troupe.

605
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,760
If my master

606
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,670
lost most of the power to help her,

607
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:45,710
what should we do if the Demons

608
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:47,230
come to us?

609
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:52,280
Miss.

610
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:55,880
Please get up.

611
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:04,950
Miss.

612
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:08,630
Sorry to disturb you today.

613
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:10,840
I apologize.

614
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:14,660
My illness

615
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,300
is not that serious.

616
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:20,110
I will recover after some rest.

617
00:34:21,950 --> 00:34:22,740
Thank you.

618
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:24,600
Fei!

619
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,230
Thank you, Miss.

620
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,080
We should go now.

621
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:49,930
Fei!

622
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:52,190
Since Madam said she would consider,

623
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:53,610
maybe she is willing to help you!

624
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:55,530
Why don’t we wait for a little longer?

625
00:34:56,950 --> 00:34:58,840
You have seen that

626
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,120
the girls from Yuyi Troupe

627
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:02,600
tried to stop it several times.

628
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,950
It must be a risk for Madam Nichang

629
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:07,060
to save me.

630
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,120
We shouldn’t disturb her.

631
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,520
I know how you feel now.

632
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,080
I will also blame myself

633
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,320
if Madam gets into any trouble.

634
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,360
But you have to know that

635
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,890
ordinary injuries can be healed.

636
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,910
But nothing can help

637
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:23,880
if you lose your life.

638
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:27,180
Then…

639
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,660
No matter what,

640
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,250
let’s make the decision
after we talk with Madam Nichang.

641
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:32,880
Before that,

642
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:35,280
you can think carefully.

643
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,810
I will respect your decision.

644
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,390
Miss, I have some great medicine,

645
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:49,470
which is always used by Master.

646
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:51,080
If you like it,

647
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,540
Mr. Qian Suiyou can come with me
to take it.

648
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:55,870
Thank you.

649
00:35:57,470 --> 00:35:58,600
Have some rest first.

650
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,490
I will be back soon.

651
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:06,450
Please.

652
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:21,330
Please.

653
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,230
Lingyu asked me to take them

654
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:29,940
all here for you to choose.

655
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:35,280
This is all I can do.

656
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,910
As the heir of the South Blade,

657
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:39,280
Miss Zhou has a heart of righteousness.

658
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,640
I really admire it.

659
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:44,960
I hope Miss Zhou can be safe and sound.

660
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,150
Where is that injured girl?

661
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:58,790
Take her to me.

662
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,600
Master,

663
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,910
for yourself

664
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:04,800
and the safety of the whole troupe,

665
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,190
please think twice!

666
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:07,840
This time is different.

667
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:09,870
Do you know

668
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:12,230
who the South Blade is?

669
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,630
I know.

670
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:16,120
It’s the famous master, Li Zheng.

671
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,530
Do you know that

672
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:20,840
if he didn’t save my life that year,

673
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,090
I would have already died?

674
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,450
Then our troupe wouldn’t exist,

675
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:27,180
let alone you.

676
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:29,520
But, Master…

677
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,230
Enough.

678
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:32,970
It’s fated that he saved me

679
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:37,140
and it’s also fated that I could save
her granddaughter.

680
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,190
That’s great.

681
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:43,780
Great.

682
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:53,540
Lingyu,

683
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,230
you’re my first apprentice.

684
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,030
You never let me down.

685
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,230
You are always the most obedient

686
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:04,870
and reasonable one.

687
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,950
I know you feel sad

688
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:10,830
and worry about the troupe.

689
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,770
But, Lingyu,

690
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:18,270
when you’re at my age,

691
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,340
you won’t

692
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,790
live for the

693
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:29,120
unknown future which may end
at any time you don’t know,

694
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:33,180
but for the past

695
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,430
and the concern in your mind.

696
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,560
No matter how tall the tree is,

697
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:47,220
its leaves will be withered and yellow
in late autumn.

698
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,170
Instead of struggling,

699
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:53,660
I’d rather fall to the ground and
become the mud early.

700
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:58,330
The future of the world

701
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,260
is up to you youngsters.

702
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:05,950
Lingyu,

703
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,030
stand up.

704
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,860
I have something to ask you.

705
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:20,120
Lingyu.

706
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:23,130
If without my protection,

707
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:26,320
can you take care

708
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:30,080
of the troupe alone?

709
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,360
Master,

710
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,800
I don’t want you to do this.

711
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:39,930
Don’t worry.

712
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,820
This is the worst case.

713
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,590
Alright.

714
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:49,560
Go to the secret chamber

715
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,940
and get that elixir out.

716
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:54,470
Master, are you going to give it

717
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:56,010
to Miss Zhou Fei?

718
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,580
Her illness is about the
two inner forces.

719
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,840
The elixir won’t work.

720
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:04,270
Then… you’re going to use it?

721
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:11,080
Master!

722
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:13,150
That elixir can recover your power

723
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:14,760
in a limited time,

724
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:15,800
but it’s just a temporary relief

725
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:18,280
which will result in disaster!

726
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:25,700
My master gave it to me.

727
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:29,040
Of course I know it.

728
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,850
I know the difficulty of Madam Nichang.

729
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:54,470
But Fei is in danger now.

730
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,120
I have no choice.

731
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,800
Fei,

732
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,940
I bring back the medicine for you.

733
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,200
Fei?

734
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,520
Sir, what happened?

735
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,390
Miss Zhou is gone.

736
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:15,120
Did you see her?

737
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,360
How could she be gone?

738
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,840
Isn’t she waiting in the room for you?

739
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:18,840
She is not.

740
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:19,910
No more waste of time.

741
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:21,760
Master!

742
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:24,180
What’s wrong? Why so anxious?

743
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,920
Miss Zhou is missing!

744
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:31,950
She is really unyielding.

745
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:33,930
She even left by herself.

746
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,910
She is exactly the same as Li Zheng

747
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:40,320
with her stubborn temper.

748
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:42,950
Master, since she left by herself,

749
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:44,430
it’s not our blame.

750
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,430
You two,

751
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:52,840
go to help Qian Suiyou in secret

752
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,160
to find Miss Zhou.

753
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,370
It’s up to us whether to save her.

754
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,860
But it’ll be different if she is
missing in our place.

755
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,020
-Yes.
-Yes.

756
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:11,350
She left by herself?

757
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:13,660
Interesting.

758
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,360
Fei!

759
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,180
I’m here.

760
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,230
Why are you here?

761
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:26,000
Can’t you just stop risking

762
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,050
your life?

763
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,710
People die every day in this world.

764
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:32,560
Maybe your life means nothing.

765
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:34,520
But if anything bad happens to you,

766
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:35,910
what will your family do?

767
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:38,080
What will I do?

768
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:41,600
I… I just don’t

769
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,710
want to bother them.

770
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,100
Sorry.

771
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:49,400
I was too anxious.

772
00:42:50,010 --> 00:42:51,330
I shouldn’t have yelled at you.

773
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,080
It’s OK since you are safe.

774
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:57,120
Let’s go.

775
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:57,680
I…

776
00:42:58,800 --> 00:42:59,450
Fei!

777
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:05,760
Madam.

778
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,150
How is she?

779
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:14,650
Come in with me.

780
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,380
Madam Nichang.

781
00:44:13,230 --> 00:44:16,640
I’m afraid the healing
has to be delayed.

782
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,760
Sorry that

783
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,470
I came tonight without an invitation.

784
00:44:55,470 --> 00:44:58,120
I have long yearned for watching

785
00:44:58,120 --> 00:44:59,980
the performance of your troupe.

786
00:45:01,470 --> 00:45:03,180
This is really not a good time.

787
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:05,910
Mr. Shen, you’re too late.

788
00:45:05,910 --> 00:45:08,360
If you want to watch performance
in the future,

789
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:11,800
I will deliver the Yuling Token to you
in person.

790
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:13,230
No. No. No.

791
00:45:13,230 --> 00:45:14,910
It’s just the right time,

792
00:45:14,910 --> 00:45:16,490
I think.

793
00:45:24,230 --> 00:45:26,750
I’d like to ask you.

794
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:30,320
Yuyi Troupe never had anything
to do with the Demons.

795
00:45:30,950 --> 00:45:33,170
Why did you kill my people?

796
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:34,800
Speaking of that,

797
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,040
I really admire it.

798
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:39,430
You had a bunch of loyal dogs

799
00:45:39,430 --> 00:45:40,710
which have tight mouths

800
00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:41,710
that I can’t open.

801
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:44,680
If they had told me your whereabouts
earlier,

802
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:47,910
they wouldn’t have died.

803
00:45:48,870 --> 00:45:49,920
Luckily,

804
00:45:50,670 --> 00:45:53,880
I met two people to lead me the way.
