Yitang stole the commander’s tally

so that we were rescued.

00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:09,650
in such danger.

25
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:29,780
Lord Gantang.

26
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,780
You’re just in time.
I was looking for you.

27
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,570
I’ve arranged military affairs.

28
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:39,090
Jinrong’s birthday is coming.

29
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:41,340
I’ll leave tomorrow for home.

30
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,860
What a coincidence! Look.

31
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,700
Here’s a letter from your home.

32
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,500
My daughter has been back home,

33
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,730
with all the tokens
for the Color of Ocean and Heaven.

34
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:12,090
Go back home.

35
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:13,220
I’ll get the horse ready for you.

36
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:14,980
Okay.

37
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:17,540
I’ll leave tonight with light luggage.

38
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:21,940
General Wen knows me very well.

39
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,130
I stole

40
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:26,660
the commander’s tally.

41
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:30,410
I sent troops illegally
and broke the military law!

42
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:34,130
I’m sorry to General Wang
for his care and instruction.

43
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:37,130
I’m sorry to the whole Anping Army!

44
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:40,130
I’m guilty!

45
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,340
Yitang!

46
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,060
Yitang! Yitang!

47
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:07,500
What did you do?

48
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:21,060
You miser.

49
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:27,410
You don’t need to buy me drinks anymore.

50
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:37,620
I’ve destroyed my martial arts.

51
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:40,130
Wen Yu.

52
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,820
I’ll leave Anping Army

53
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,250
to you.

54
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:03,780
Hyah!

55
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:05,900
Hyah!

56
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,220
Hyah!

57
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:22,690
Assassins! Protect Lord Gantang.

58
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:34,820
We’re trapped! Go!

59
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:36,620
Don’t run after them!

60
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,570
Lord Gantang, it’s foresighted of you.

61
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:55,290
The assassins did attack us tonight.

62
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,570
Right ahead us is the territory
of the Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

63
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,820
If they didn’t attack me,

64
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,620
they wouldn’t have a chance.

65
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:09,290
What have you got?

66
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:12,850
The blade looks like a weapon
from the court.

67
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:15,570
There are always disguises
in the art of war.

68
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:17,380
We used a trick.

69
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:19,570
They might have used one, too.

70
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:21,130
What do you mean, Lord Gantang?

71
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:32,010
They were very meticulous,

72
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:35,060
leaving no clue to us.

73
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,660
I’m not sure who they are.

74
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:38,250
But...

75
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:41,690
I’m afraid
something terrible may happen.

76
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:48,500
The world has been in peace
for merely two years.

77
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:52,250
People can no longer suffer.

78
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:55,380
The Fortress of the Forty-Eight
is right there.

79
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,940
I’ll travel all night to get home early.

80
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,660
There won’t be any problem.

81
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:08,780
General Wen.

82
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:11,820
Please go back with Anping Token.

83
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,100
Remember.

84
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,170
No matter what rumors you hear,

85
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:18,850
make sure not to take any rash action.

86
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:20,660
I can’t leave.

87
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:22,660
Lord Gantang.

88
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,540
If I leave,

89
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,780
you’ll be alone.

90
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,250
I’m afraid...

91
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,900
What are you afraid of?

92
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:35,100
Compared to

93
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:39,010
several hundred thousand people
on the border,

94
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:42,300
I’m insignificant.

95
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:46,570
The order cannot be disobeyed.

96
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:47,740
General Wen.

97
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:50,010
Take the order.

98
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:56,570
I...

99
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,690
I take the order.

100
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,220
Bravo!

101
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,220
You moved so swiftly,

102
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:43,300
like a graceful flying bird.

103
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,340
Don’t flatter me.

104
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:49,180
Have some hot wine to warm up.

105
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:53,740
Here.

106
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:00,860
Your craftsmanship is getting better.

107
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,250
You’ve made so many lanterns.

108
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,810
Are you going to sell them?

109
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:05,740
No.

110
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,300
We’ll fly them.

111
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:11,900
Which do you like? Pick one.

112
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:22,370
That one.

113
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:24,180
This one?

114
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:27,690
I painted it very carefully.

115
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,450
Look at the mountain.

116
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:30,780
You see the details?

117
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:33,340
The river and the pavilion.

118
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:35,420
Look. We’re here.

119
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,250
We’ll fly only one lantern?

120
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,180
I’ll pick one, too.

121
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:44,780
Which one would you like?

122
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:47,010
This one.

123
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:50,900
I heard

124
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,180
the lantern would fly

125
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:53,860
to the heaven.

126
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:57,930

151
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:04,900
Wen Yu was the strongest martial artist

152
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,340
working for Wang Lin.

153
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:08,490
I didn’t expect losers like you

154
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:10,220
to kill him.

155
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,980
He doesn’t have martial arts.

156
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:19,540
But he’s more thoughtful

157
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:21,300
than most people.

158
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:25,980
We cannot defeat him,

159
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:28,180
unless Shen Tianshu goes personally.

160
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:34,100
I just gave him a lesson,

161
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:35,540
telling them

162
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:38,420
we’re not pushovers.

163
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:41,570
It’s been years,

164
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:44,370
but Shen Tianshu had no breakthrough
on his martial arts.

165
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:48,300
Seems like he has
his own inner demon, too.

166
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:51,980
I will make him

167
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,340
help us.

169
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:03,340
Why is there such a weird disease?

170
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:07,300
The pulse is so weird.
I’ve never seen any before.

171
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:11,860
I’m a doctor for the Third Prince.

00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,780
May I have your name?

173
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:21,740
You use the martial art
of Route Gang,

174
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,250
Chong Vessel.

175
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:26,250
Chong Vessel sets in your body
with wrong circulation of vital energy.

176
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:30,180
When you practice rashly,
you have a bellyache.

177
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,010
The weakness of your martial arts

178
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:33,930
lies in Qichong.

179
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:35,690
Am I right?

180
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,490
I really underestimated you.

181
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:41,220
My respects.

182
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:43,010
Come in, please.

183
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:47,250
The Third Prince vomits sometimes.

184
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,540
Looks like he has disharmony
of spleen and stomach

185
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,130
-and lower adverse-rising energy.
-Come in, please.

186
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:52,570
Nonsense! Nonsense!

187
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:53,900
There’s no heat in his stomach

188
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,810
so that he can’t digest any food.

189
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:58,100
That’s why he vomits
every time he eats something.

190
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,370
He just needs heat-clearing pills.

191
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:18,130
He’s got lovesickness.

192
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,570
Nonsense! Ridiculous!

193
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:22,900
This is nonsense!

194
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,220
He just needs some heat-clearing pills.

195
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:24,690
Yes.

196
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:25,690
There’s no heat in his stomach.

197
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:27,370
It can’t be lovesickness.

198
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:29,010
No way.

199
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:30,450
She’s talking rubbish!

200
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:31,860
His pulse feels...

201
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:37,450
What is she doing?

202
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:39,130
How careless she is!

203
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:46,610
How... how dare she!

204
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:47,610
What is she writing?

205
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:48,900
Seriously?

206
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:51,300
Isn’t...

207
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:53,130
Isn’t she giving a casual prescription?

208
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:57,450
Get what’s in the prescription

209
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:59,300
and put it in the censer.

210
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,610
The Third Prince
will wake up immediately.

211
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:03,610
But I’m afraid

212
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:05,940
it’s not easy to cure him completely.

213
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:23,900
How was it going, Madam?

214
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:27,660
Such stupid doctors want
to detoxify my poison?

215
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:30,010
What a fool’s talk!

216
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:33,370
Doctor! Doctor! Please stay.

217
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:35,730
Doctor.

218
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,820
When we put the medicine in,

219
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:39,850
the Third Prince woke up immediately.

220
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,660
You have miraculous medical skills!

221
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,180
You flatter me.

222
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:45,060
I just restrained the disease

223
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:47,610
in the body of the Third Prince.

224
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:50,540
If you want him to get recovered,

225
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:51,490
I’m afraid

226
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:54,420
you need to cure him of lovesickness.

227
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:57,660
Please instruct us, Doctor.

228
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:03,490
Commander-in-chief, let me go
and tell Lord.

229
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:05,580
It’s okay. Don’t bother.

230
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:06,940
I’ll just wait.

231
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:12,850
Commander-in-chief,
sorry to have kept you waiting.

232
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:15,940
Lord invited you in.

233
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,540
Lord.

234
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:21,730
Here comes Commander-in-chief.

235
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:26,420
Lord Shen, you’ve locked yourself here.

236
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:31,420
What a comfortable life you live!

237
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:34,580
I don’t think you allowed me in

238
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:38,090
only because I waited
for such a long time.

239
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:40,420
I heard

240
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:44,010
the assassins you sent
to kill Zhou Yitang

241
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:45,970
failed their mission.

242
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:47,330
Without you,

243
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:50,250
they could do nothing.

244
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:55,010
You won’t easily give up.

245
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:57,250
I guess you’ve got a backup plan.

246
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:02,060
You know me very well, Lord Shen.

247
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:04,460
I had someone sneak into
the Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

248
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:07,940
I must get
the Color of Ocean and Heaven.

249
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,490
It would be better

250
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:11,940
if we could kill Li Jinrong

251
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:14,250
when the Third Prince was there.

252
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:26,780
We can only get fish in troubled waters.

253
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:30,250
Kill two birds with one stone?

254
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:34,490
It’s greedy of you, Commander-in-chief.

255
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:38,180
Aren’t you curious

256
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:40,490
about who I have sent to the Fortress?

257
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:45,610
Don’t you worry about her safety?

258
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:49,420
She’s risking her life for you.

259
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,540
You have the greatest talent

260
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:55,330
to identify and use people.

261
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,700
If you asked me to kill Li Jinrong,

262
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,580
I might not succeed

263
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:05,010
even after a desperate fight.

264
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:08,130
But everything has its vanquisher.

265
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:11,720
Since Pathetic Clam poisoned Li Zheng,

266
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:15,010
she can also poison Li Jinrong.

267
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:18,330
Why must I worry about her?

268
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:22,820
You don’t worry about her.

269
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:26,780
But you’re still willing to meet me.

270
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:31,180
Could you be moved by my sincerity?

271
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:34,580
Last time, you visited me

272
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:38,180
and asked me to kill Zhou Yitang.

273
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:41,540
You didn’t give a good reason,

274
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:44,850
so that I didn’t feel
any killing intent.

275
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:48,900
Now you tell me Pathetic Clam went
to the Fortress of the Forty-Eight for you.

276
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:51,460
Commander-in-chief.

277
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:54,300
I know her best.

278
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,900
In the past few years,

279
00:20:55,900 --> 00:21:00,010
she only cares about flowers
in the manor.

280
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:02,060
If it weren’t for
the Color of Ocean and Heaven,

281
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,300
I couldn’t even ask her to do anything.

282
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,090
What did you

283
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:10,330
give her?

284
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:13,250
You’d better not know.

285
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:22,130
I don’t think I can get anything today.

286
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:23,130
I’d like to go.

287
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:27,300
She went there for you, Lord Shen.

288
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:35,850
Your people failed many times.

289
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:38,180
I told Tianying

290
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:39,540
I would withdraw everything

291
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:42,060
for supporting the Demons these years.

292
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:49,330
She went there, to keep your prestige
among the Demons.

293
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:52,730
She’s such a good woman.

294
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:55,780
Do cherish her.

295
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:01,250
I’ve thought about this.

296
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:03,060
Seems like

297
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:06,300
you have no more news to tell me.

298
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:09,330
Will you really look on and do nothing?

299
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:15,460
Commander-in-chief.

300
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:17,730
I’m no longer

301
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:21,820
a kindhearted young man

302
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:22,730
who would help people

303
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:24,820
if he knew they were in trouble.

304
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:27,700
Pathetic Clam worked for you.

305
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:30,250
If you want me to help her,

306
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:34,130
you should at least
give me something attractive.

307
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:36,820
How much money or grain
do you want this time?

308
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:39,700
None.

309
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:44,970
A powerful man like you

310
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:49,210
lives such a poor life.

311
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:53,180
You’re either too thrifty,

312
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:54,460
or

313
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:58,370
too heartless.

314
00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:00,820
What exactly do you want?

315
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:03,730
I want you to send troops to help me
get the Color of Ocean and Heaven.

316
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:06,580
Sure. We promised to join hands

317
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:09,210
and get it.

318
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:12,700
Yes, we promised.

319
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:16,330
Now you want me to kill someone for you.

320
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:21,900
You need to give me something more.

321
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:33,250
After we find
the Color of Ocean and Heaven,

322
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:36,730
do not

323
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:38,660
touch anything

324
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,300
in it.

325
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,540
Stop!

326
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:09,130
Your Highness.

327
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:10,700
We’ve walked a long way.

328
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:11,820
Shall we take a rest?

329
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:12,780
Okay.

330
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:18,730
Mr. Bai.

331
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:19,610
How long will it take?

332
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:21,730
Don’t be anxious, Your Highness.
We’re arriving soon.

333
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:26,300
Your Highness, you’ve grown up.

334
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,610
You’re going to propose to a girl.

335
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:29,970
Hope we’ll succeed

336
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:32,010
and you can get the girl you love.

337
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:35,420
But Miss Zhou doesn’t look

338
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:37,410
like Xie Yun’s good friend only.

339
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:39,370
How shall I propose to her?

340
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:40,420
Your Highness.

341
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:41,660
Marriage is usually made

342
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:44,060
by parents’ order
and match-maker’s word.

343
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:46,610
Just go propose to Miss Zhou.

344
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:49,210
If Mr. Xie wants the same thing,

345
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:51,970
he will do it in his own way.

346
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:54,850
You won’t be stealing her girl.

347
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:00,060
Before we left,

348
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:02,580
most people in the palace knew

349
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:04,490
you came to propose to her.

350
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:06,060
If you failed and went back,

351
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:09,460
I’m afraid you would be laughed at.

352
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:12,490
Your Highness, before you try,

353
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:14,420
how do you know you will fail?

354
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:17,300
Try, as if getting rid
of your inner demon.

355
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,180
Anyway,

356
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:21,700
you must get rid of your lovesickness.

357
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,420
She’s right.

358
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:25,970
It’s also for the sake of your health.

359
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:31,850
Okay. Let’s move on.

360
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:33,090
Aye.

361
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:49,900
(Token)

362
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:52,850
Without me,

363
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:57,460
Fei would have lived a carefree life.

364
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:06,460
Madam, we’ve got a visitor.

365
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:09,210
Didn’t I tell Sheng

366
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:10,660
to stop all visitors?

367
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:13,300
Maybe he can’t stop this one.

368
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,180
Who is it?

369
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:15,820
The Third Prince.

370
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:40,700
Stop!

371
00:26:57,370 --> 00:26:58,540
Today, I’ve finally realized

372
00:26:58,540 --> 00:26:59,900
how vast this place can be.

373
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,460
It took us great trouble
to walk halfway.

374
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:02,660
We could hardly move on.

375
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:04,210
Luckily, you sent men to help us.

376
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:05,850
We came up alive, at last.

377
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:09,490
Your Highness, I heard
you’re seeking talents.

378
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:11,660
For your marriage,

379
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:13,780
you’ve racked your brains.

380
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:14,940
Sure.

381
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:16,660
This is a heroic place.

382
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:18,330
If I weren’t sincere to propose,

383
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:20,060
how could I convince other heroes?

384
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:21,060
Very well.

385
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:25,180
We don’t support
either your court or the other.

386
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:27,010
We have our own rules.

387
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:29,970
Sorry to have offended you.

388
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:31,700
Good point.

389
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:32,700
Mr. Li.

390
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,940
Oh, no, Master Li.

391
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:37,820
With a heroic cousin like you,

392
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:39,180
no wonder

393
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,900
Miss Zhou is also a heroine

394
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,210
and an outstanding girl.

395
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:44,540
Miss Zhou?

396
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:47,210
Aren’t you going to...?

397
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:50,610
You want to marry Zhou Fei?

398
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:54,460
Why do you want to marry her?

399
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,060
To guard your house?

400
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:17,490
Doctor, are you all right?

401
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:18,180
She’s alright.

402
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:19,420
After walking the whole day,

403
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:21,540
she’s so weak that she needs some rest.

404
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:23,970
How about this?

405
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:24,940
I’ll take you to your rooms

406
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:26,540
for some rest.

407
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,490
Mr. Li.

408
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:29,900
I’d like to take His Highness

409
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:32,010
to meet Madam Li.

410
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:36,660
Your Highness, it’s our honor

411
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:38,130
to welcome you.

412
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:40,060
Thank you, Madam Li.

413
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:42,250
This is the first cup of tea
I’ve had today.

414
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:44,370
Sorry for the poor condition.

415
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:46,700
Please forgive us.

416
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:48,820
Your Highness, I wonder

417
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:50,250
what you come for.

418
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:52,730
Lately, I was in danger a few times,

419
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:54,180
and Miss Zhou saved me.

420
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:56,580
I heard it’s your birthday.

421
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:57,940
I bring some gifts

422
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:59,580
to express my gratitude.

423
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:05,700
This is the Mountain-River Jade
I’ve treasured.

424
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:06,900
Seen in the candlelight,

425
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:09,210
the pattern looks
like the mountain and river.

426
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:12,250
Take it.

427
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:17,300
(Insightful and Open-minded)
I heard martial artists are easy-going.

428
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:18,300
Madam, you really behave

429
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,580
like departed heroes.

430
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:22,540
I’ll accept the Jade.

431
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:24,010
But please take away

432
00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:26,060
the rest of the gifts.

433
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:31,540
These are...

434
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:34,540
Madam.

435
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:36,330
These are betrothal presents

436
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:38,820
to propose to Miss Zhou Fei.

437
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:46,900
Your father sent you?

438
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:51,540
His Highness

439
00:29:52,010 --> 00:29:53,130
likes Miss Zhou.

440
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:57,300
He came here
with the approval from His Majesty.

441
00:29:58,090 --> 00:29:59,090
Cousin!

442
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:00,660
Cousin, bad news!

443
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:04,580
Cousin!

444
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:06,250
The Third Prince...

445
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:07,420
He came to propose to you

446
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:08,900
with a lot of gifts!

447
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:10,130
What?

448
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:11,940
The Third Prince?

449
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:13,730
Propose to me?

450
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:15,820
Where’s Xie Yun?

451
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:17,730
Did he know the Third Prince came?

452
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:19,210
I didn’t see him.

453
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:20,700
Shall I go find him?

454
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:31,090
Tell him the Third Prince wanted
to marry me.

455
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:32,490
See how he responded.

456
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:49,730
Mr. Xie.

457
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:50,660
Look what a condition you’re in!

458
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:51,660
Why are you still here?

459
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:53,210
I was looking for you everywhere!

460
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:54,900
What do you mean?

461
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,060
Forget it.

462
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:58,090
Your sworn brother, the Third Prince...

463
00:30:58,090 --> 00:31:00,660
He has come
and is now in the Hall of Elders.

464
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:02,660
Zichen has come?

465
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:03,610
That’s great.

466
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:04,700
That’s not great!

467
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,970
He came to propose to Fei!

468
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:14,780
You met my daughter?

469
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:17,490
A couple of times.

470
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:18,330
Unfortunately,

471
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:20,300
we met by chance
and we weren’t very close.

472
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:25,940
You came to propose to her
after meeting by chance?

473
00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:28,490
It’s so romantic of you, Your Highness.

474
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:33,580
She met me by chance.

475
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:34,940
But to me,

476
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:36,850
I couldn’t forget her
for even one glance.

477
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:38,960
Your Highness.

478
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,630
This doesn’t work in this place.

479
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:43,030
Zhou Fei has grown up.

480
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:45,390
I can’t make decisions for her.

481
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:47,750
Talk to her personally.

482
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:16,080
Miss Zhou, what do you think?

483
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,720
Xie Yun?

484
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,910
I heard you were here. This is great.

485
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:29,510
What are you coming for?

486
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:30,870
I...

487
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,360
I want to...

488
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:34,200
I want to marry Miss Zhou.

489
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:36,960
Father has agreed.

490
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,150
Xie Yun, what do you think?

491
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:49,270
Are these all for me?

492
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:50,960
Miss Zhou.

493
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,800
These are betrothal presents

494
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,600
His Highness prepared for you.
Do you like them?

495
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,110
She...

496
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:02,960
I don’t think

497
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,910
she likes any of this.

498
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,800
This blade looks good.

499
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,390
You have sharp eyes, Miss Zhou.

500
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:16,390
Mount Kunwu is said
to be sixty miles east

501
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:17,870
from the Yi River.

502
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:20,360
On the mountain is lots of copper
as red as fire.

503
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,600
Made of it,

504
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,840
the blade will cut jade like mud.

505
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:24,910
This is Kunwu,

506
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:27,800
the famous blade made of such copper.

507
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,750
What?

508
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:30,990
You’re also interested in this?

509
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:32,630
No.

510
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:34,150
I...

511
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:34,800
I just...

512
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,560
I just want to have a look.

513
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,960
Sorry, Xie Yun.

514
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:56,080
I should have told you.

515
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,390
After all,

516
00:33:57,390 --> 00:33:59,990
you’re Miss Zhou’s close friend.

517
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:02,080
But if you don’t want us

518
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,800
to get married,

519
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:05,630
I will...

520
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:06,510
Zichen.

521
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:08,560
You want to marry me, don’t you?

522
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,990
Why did you ask him for permission?

523
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,950
You only need to ask me.

524
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:14,120
Come with me.

525
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:16,920
Wait!

526
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:18,470
Don’t follow up.

527
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,360
Tired?

528
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,880
Don’t push yourself.

529
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,510
I’m not tired. For you,

530
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:41,880
I would do anything impossible.

531
00:34:43,430 --> 00:34:45,470
We just met a few times.

532
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:47,560
Why do you like me so much?

533
00:34:48,470 --> 00:34:51,430
We grew up
under totally different conditions.

534
00:34:51,430 --> 00:34:53,670
I must behave carefully
since I was little.

535
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:55,190
I can do nothing wrong.

536
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:58,190
But you’re always free and bighearted.

537
00:34:58,190 --> 00:35:00,430
You’re the most special girl I’ve met.

538
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:00,920
So...

539
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,880
How passionate you sound, Your Highness!

540
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,600
But since I was little,

541
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,360
I’ve made a rule for myself.

542
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,120
Whoever wants to marry me

543
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:10,190
must have better martial arts.

544
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:11,990
Your Highness, would you like
to compete with me?

545
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,400
I...

546
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:17,400
I’ve seen your martial arts.

547
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,800
Miss Zhou,

548
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,360
you’re forcing me.

549
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,560
If you don’t want to compete, fine.

550
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,320
Leave as early as possible.

551
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,750
No.

552
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,400
Well,

553
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,840
Miss Zhou,

554
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,840
sorry for the offense.

555
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:40,360
Fei is great.

556
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:44,160
She tried to scare him away.

557
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,270
Bonehead, watch and learn.

558
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:47,640
Learn what?

559
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,710
It doesn’t work on him. Look.

560
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:55,190
Well, it doesn’t work on an idiot.

561
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:07,920
Nice move!

562
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,640
Are you alright?

563
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,430
You used great martial arts, Miss Zhou.

564
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:15,990
Do you get me wrong

565
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:17,880
or do you get yourself wrong?

566
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:19,750
Even if I’m fighting someone stronger,

567
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:21,160
I must have a try.

568
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,750
Or you couldn’t feel my loyalty.

569
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,400
Show your loyalty in our place?

570
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,320
You’ve overestimated yourself.

571
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,750
Everyone in your place is loyal.

572
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:35,320
I’ve never underestimated you.

573
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,670
Fine. How about this?

574
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,560
I’ve seen the betrothal gifts
you gave me.

575
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,120
I don’t like them.

576
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:49,510
I want the wild flower in the crevice

577
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:51,920
in the middle of Ximo River.

578
00:36:58,190 --> 00:36:59,360
If you get it for me,

579
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,840
I’ll marry you.

580
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,990
If you fail,

581
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,430
leave in the way you come.

582
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:05,710
What do you think?

583
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:08,920
Fine. It’s a deal, then.

584
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,670
Doomed.

585
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:12,950
The Spinning Wire Formation
over Ximo River is still on.

586
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:15,600
The Spinning Wire Formation?

587
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,400
What is that?

588
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,400
What’s this?

589
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:29,270
The Spinning Wire Formation.

590
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:31,120
It’s as fast as the wind
and as sharp as a blade.

591
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:32,920
It’s made against robbers.

592
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,160
With this on,

593
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,560
who can get the wide flower
from the middle of the river?

594
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:54,190
I first met her

595
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:56,120
in the Ximo River.

596
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,400
I thought

597
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,640
she was the Weed Spirit in the river.

598
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:03,670
Your Highness,
would you still like a try?

599
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:04,600
I...

600
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:10,190
I’ll have a talk with him.

601
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,950
You’re no longer kids.
Could you stop eavesdropping?

602
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,800
In this world,

603
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,190
seems like only you can do it.

604
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:32,270
Xie Yun.

605
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,080
You...

606
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:35,160
You and Miss Zhou...

607
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,080
Did I... did I do something wrong?

608
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:45,640
Zichen, did your father really
allow you to come?

609
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,840
He ordered you to come?

610
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:55,470
I insisted on coming.

611
00:38:55,470 --> 00:38:57,360
Father didn’t agree at first.

612
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,120
We even quarreled.

613
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:05,670
Zichen, you always say
you’re inferior to me.

614
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:07,950
But I can’t propose to my beloved girl

615
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:10,470
like you do.

616
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:12,360
If you really like her,

617
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,400
why don’t you tell her?

618
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:22,400
I’m dying. Even if I told her,

619
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,920
nothing would change.

620
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:30,670
I’m living a good life already.

621
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:32,800
Staying with her every day

622
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,400
makes me satisfied.

623
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:41,560
I want to be married to her.

624
00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:44,750
Unfortunately, I...

625
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:47,470
But Xie Yun...

626
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:49,470
You’re a prince. How can you...

627
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:50,840
It doesn’t matter.

628
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:54,800
I should have been dead
in the war years ago.

629
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:57,190
I lived for extra years,

630
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:59,840
which was already a blessing.

631
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:02,840
I’ll certainly live in the way I like.

632
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,880
I prefer to teach students in this place

633
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,670
under her prestige,

634
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:08,360
and be a rent collector.

635
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,120
I feel my life satisfied, then.

636
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,750
Pretend I was married to her for peace.

637
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:17,510
What do you think?

638
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:26,080
Xie Yun, have you made up your mind?

639
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:29,190
Yes. The fiercer Fei is, the better.

640
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:30,230
In this way,

641
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:32,600
no one but me dares to marry her.

642
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:40,990
Fei?

643
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:47,510
Your Highness, did you understand?

644
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:49,190
You may leave us.

645
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:50,190
I...

646
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:58,880
Fei, you heard us?

647
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:15,230
I’m fierce?

648
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:18,390
Not really.

649
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:19,640
Not really?

650
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:23,080
No, no, you’re not fierce.

651
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,670
Zichen is young and naive.

652
00:41:25,770 --> 00:41:27,700
Don’t take it seriously.

653
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:31,180
I don’t care what he said.

654
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:32,940
But...

655
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:35,770
I just heard someone said

656
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:38,220
he would like to be married to me.

657
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:42,810
Fei, you know that.

658
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:46,260
I was born with bad luck
and I won’t live long.

659
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:47,090
Bah!

660
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:49,570
What bad luck?

661
00:41:49,570 --> 00:41:51,050
I haven’t despised you.

662
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:53,330
How can you despise yourself?

Man.

688
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:10,950
You used such a great move
on the training ground.

689
00:43:10,950 --> 00:43:12,710
Nice move. Let’s have a competition.

690
00:43:12,710 --> 00:43:14,560
-Mr. Yang, I’ve got work to do.
-Just one competition.

691
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:15,600
-Just once.
-Man.

Thank you, Mr. Xie.

695
00:43:31,990 --> 00:43:32,710
What I asked you to do...

696
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:34,470
How is it going?

697
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:38,920
Rest assured. I’m sure
Fei will be surprised

698
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:40,080
so that she’ll forget

699
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:41,600
the martial art thing.

700
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:45,840
Oh, there’s some vintage wine

701
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:46,750
in Hanshui Town near here.

702
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:48,160
It’s her favorite taste.

703
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:50,470
Could you

704
00:43:50,470 --> 00:43:51,840
get one pot for me?

705
00:43:55,710 --> 00:43:57,080
Hanshui Town?

706
00:43:58,230 --> 00:44:00,430
Where the best dough figurines are sold?

707
00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:01,360
Precisely.

708
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:03,470
You’re most familiar with this area.

709
00:44:04,190 --> 00:44:06,360
Your problem is mine, Cousin-in-law.

710
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:08,160
Don’t worry. I’ll take care of it.

711
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:09,430
Thanks.

712
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,360
Bonehead, go down the mountain with me.

713
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:27,430
Go.

714
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:29,400
Man.

715
00:44:30,470 --> 00:44:32,030
What you did on the training ground

716
00:44:32,030 --> 00:44:33,400
was a nice move.

717
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:34,990
No. No. You used a better one.

718
00:44:34,990 --> 00:44:35,710
No.

719
00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:37,400
-If only Bonehead...
-Let’s teach each other.

720
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,270
-could be half as romantic as Mr. Xie.
-What do you think?

721
00:44:39,270 --> 00:44:40,560
Let’s go. Go.

722
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:42,560
Let’s compete. Go.

723
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:45,470
I’ll go alone, then.

We’re busy up here.

725

You must tell our men

726
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:57,800
to strengthen the patrol
in and out of the Fortress.

727
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:59,190
Tomorrow,

728
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:01,950
we’ll celebrate Aunt’s birthday.

729
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:03,840
We mustn’t be careless on the patrol
outside the mountain, either.

730
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:05,640
We must be very cautious. Got it?

731
00:45:05,990 --> 00:45:07,030
Aye!
