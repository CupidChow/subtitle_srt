you must live well

174
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:46,590
with or without me.

175
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:50,030
Understand?

176
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:57,910
Has Zhou Fei talked to you recently?

177
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:01,320
No.

178
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:02,960
Not at all.

179
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:05,080
She’s only asked me

180
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,960
to work on your antidote.

181
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:11,590
Stop hiding it.

182
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:13,000
I already know.

183
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,520
You know she’s going to
test the antidote?

184
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,590
That silly girl.

185
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,350
I... I... I...

186
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:25,840
Hecong,

187
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:27,870
I can’t allow her to do that.

188
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,520
You two are making me...

189
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,230
No!

190
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:39,550
My life is hanging by a thread.

191
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:41,110
There are two antidotes.

192
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:42,470
One will cure me
while the other will kill me.

193
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:43,640
It’s 50-50.

194
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,640
I’ll pick one and live with it.

195
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,590
If it’s the right one,

196
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:47,790
that’s great.

197
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,230
If it’s not,

198
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:50,790
a dying man like me

199
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:52,440
has nothing to lose.

200
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,280
But Zhou Fei already...

201
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,400
As the heiress to the South Blade

202
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,350
and the new Head of All Sects,

203
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:02,400
she shoulders heavy responsibility.

204
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,520
She can’t take such a risk.

205
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,960
It’s said,

206
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,550
“life isn’t a joyride
and death isn’t torture”.

207
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:14,200
Can’t I choose to live or die?

208
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,790
What do you think?

209
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,520
I’m a physician.

210
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:29,150
A life for a life
is against my principle.

211
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,440
Alright.

212
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,520
If you’ve made your decision,

213
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,150
I’ll respect that.

214
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:37,790
Thank you.

215
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:38,790
Don’t worry.

216
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:40,670
I know what to do with Fei.

217
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:41,880
All I need

218
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,840
are the antidotes from you tomorrow.

219
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,080
Sure.

220
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,150
Oh,

221
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,520
one more thing.

222
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,670
What is it?

223
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,280
I also need knockout drops

224
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,350
that will last an entire night.

225
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,760
This one is colorless and odorless.

226
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,760
Even Zhou Fei

227
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,670
is unable to detect it.

228
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:22,670
Thanks.

229
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:31,980
(Jichun Fabrics)

230
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,470
Fei,

231
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,240
I couldn’t have lived this long

232
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:13,800
without you.

233
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:19,120
If the antidote proves to be wrong,

234
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:26,000
I wish

235
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,760
I could stop being
Xiao Chuan in my next life.

236
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,030
I’d rather

237
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:42,760
be a weed in the Ximo River

238
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:48,150
to guard the Fortress
of the Forty-Eight day and night

239
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:49,590
as well as you.

240
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:56,440
Granduncle once said

241
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,890
death is simply

242
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:02,560
one of the eight pains.

243
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,730
Fei,

244
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:09,740
thanks to you,

245
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,880
my life,

246
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,580
however short it is,

247
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,460
is meaningful

248
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:23,680
without any regrets.

249
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,470
I’ve narrowed down

250
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:42,680
the last herb of your antidote

251
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,560
to Dry Grass or Dry Sprout,

252
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,320
but I’m not sure which one it is.

253
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,800
The wrong herb will kill you.

254
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:49,860
Fei.

255
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:33,440
Xie Meimei!

256
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,510
Fei,

257
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:41,560
see you

258
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:45,590
in 20 years.

259
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,350
I promise.

260
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:52,600
My blade can become

261
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,630
the most unpredictable through practice,

262
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,080
but what about my life?

263
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,720
In the end,

264
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,110
nothing is left.

265
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:11,030
Nothing helps.

266
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,320

349
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,240
Alright,

350
00:28:57,990 --> 00:28:59,140
this is far enough.

351
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:02,390
After all that we’ve been through,

352
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:04,630
I’m used to having you around.

353
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:06,840
He’s leaving to rebuild
the Big Medicine Valley

354
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,110
to save more lives.

355
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:09,270
We should support him.

356
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,110
I suppose.

357
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:14,630
I’m lucky

358
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:16,910
to have met all of you.

359
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,370
And I’ve spent

360
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,990
the happiest

361
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:23,390
and most meaningful days

362
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:25,220
with you.

363
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:27,150
Thank you

364
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,150
for helping me

365
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:32,630
find the purpose of my life.

366
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,270
Bonehead,

367
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:39,840
cherish the girl next to you.

368
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,720
Yan,

369
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,230
if he upsets you,

370
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:43,630
just let me know.

371
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:45,510
“Snake girl” will teach him a lesson.

372
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:47,960
Sure. It’s a deal.

373
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:51,230
Well,

374
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:52,960
time to go.

375
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,630
See you.

376
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,630
See you.

377
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,870
Goodbye!

378
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:38,680
Take care.

379
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:48,490
Check the ruins of the Forbidden Hall

380
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:49,300
for hidden treasures.

381
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,730
Seize all of them.

382
00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:53,420
Oh, no! Demons are here to catch us!

383
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:55,490
Go with your son Xiaohu.

384
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:02,180
Xiaohu.

385
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:05,900
Come here. Come. Get in. Do it.

386
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,250
Stay here. Don’t make a sound.

387
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:10,490
Go, go, go!

388
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:11,370
Run!

389
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:01,780
Anyone?

390
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:11,820
Xiaohu?

391
00:33:12,370 --> 00:33:13,540
Ms. Chun?

392
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:15,540
Mr. Lyu?

393
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:25,820
Xiaohu, are you alright?

394
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:27,490
What happened?

395
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:30,850
They... They got my parents.

396
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:43,780
Report!

397
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:47,300
Go ahead.

398
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,780
Zhou Yitang’s tally

399
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:50,370
is in General Wen Yu’s hand.

400
00:33:50,370 --> 00:33:52,210
They’ve camped 10 kilometers ahead.

401
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:55,900
Well done.

402
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:08,940
General,

403
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:11,770
a message from
Shen Tianshu of Demons Manor.

404
00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:13,220
What is it?

405
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:14,610
He asks

406
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:16,420
to see you outside our camp

407
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:18,900
for the Color of Ocean and Heaven.

408
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,700
What?

409
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:21,500
General,

410
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,330
he’s ferocious.

411
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:24,260
This might be a trap.

412
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:26,900
You’d better not go.

413
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:34,980
That man is scheming.

414
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:38,290
He’d never bring up
the Color of Ocean and Heaven

415
00:34:38,290 --> 00:34:39,810
for no reason

416
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,330
unless

417
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:45,290
he did find it.

418
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:47,370
Whatever it is,

419
00:34:47,370 --> 00:34:49,460
I have to go.

420
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:20,370
General Wen,

421
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:22,180
long time no see.

422
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:24,220
How have you been?

423
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:25,460
Let’s get down to business.

424
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:27,900
I’m here to catch up.

425
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:29,810
You traitor!

426
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:31,770
Had I stayed,

427
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:34,260
Wang Lin would’ve
ruled the state long ago.

428
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:36,610
You’re so full of yourself!

429
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:39,420
Do I need to remind you

430
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:41,130
how you lost that hand?

431
00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:44,370
If I hadn’t,

432
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:46,570
I wouldn’t have found out

433
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:49,500
from the blacksmith,
who made my Iron Hand,

434
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,180
about that amazing book,

435
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:54,700
Refinement of Iron.

436
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:56,610
Weapons made with techniques in it

437
00:35:56,610 --> 00:35:58,770
are the sharpest and toughest.

438
00:35:58,770 --> 00:36:01,500
And that book

439
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:04,180
is included in
the Color of Ocean and Heaven.

440
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:06,290
Wen Yu,

441
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:08,370
I come to you for cooperation.

442
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:11,420
I own the best weapons

443
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:14,220
while you command crack troops.

444
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:15,540
If we join hands...

445
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:18,700
We’re different.

446
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:25,530
What a shame!

447
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:04,500
Wen Yu,

448
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:07,370
a smart man should choose wisely.

449
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:37,420
Why did Ying Hecong write to me?

450
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:39,500
Yes, why you alone?

451
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,020
Why didn’t he write to me?

452
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:42,290
How would I know?

453
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:43,460
Why you?

454
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:45,020
It should be us.

455
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:47,340
(To Zhou Fei)

456
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:51,770
I guess it’s to all of us.

457
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:54,850
“Fei,

458
00:37:54,850 --> 00:37:56,740
I meant to return to the Valley

459
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:59,050
to practice medicine,

460
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:00,290
but once I arrived,

461
00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:02,220
it was hell.

462
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:04,850
Hundreds of houses were burned.

463
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:09,090
Villagers were all abducted by Demons.

464
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:11,180
When I found Xiaohu,

465
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:12,660
he was desperate...”

466
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:15,980
Shen Tianshu!

467
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:18,050
That animal!

468
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:19,130
In that case,

469
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,660
he must’ve taken away

470
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:23,220
the treasure as well.

471
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:26,180
Report!

472
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:27,500
News came in

473
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,180
that Shen Tianshu killed General Wen Yu

474
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:31,980
and took the Tally of Anping Army.

475
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:32,770
General Wen Yu?

476
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:33,370
That’s right.

477
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:36,260
Even he...

478
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:43,180
Right now,

479
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:45,130
Anping Army is leaderless.

480
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:49,090
Shen Tianshu and Yu Wenzhi
are allies for long.

481
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:52,260
I’m afraid

482
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:54,090
he’s building his own power

483
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:55,740
to rule the state eventually.

484
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:57,500
If those two

485
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:58,770
launch attacks against each other,

486
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:01,700
countless civilians will suffer.

487
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:04,570
We must stop them.

488
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:06,660
That’s right.

489
00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:09,900
It’s time to settle a score with them.

490
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:12,260
Ask Ying Hecong to come here.

491
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:13,770
I’m sure he’ll help us.

492
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:16,290
Sheng and I

493
00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:17,940
will take care of Yu Wenzhi.

494
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:20,330
What about me?

495
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:22,050
You should...

496
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:23,130
Stay and watch the house.

497
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:24,420
That’s right.

498
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:27,090
We need someone we trust
to hold the fort.

499
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:33,330
Sure.

500
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:35,050
I won’t let you down.

501
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:37,980
Time is running out.

502
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:39,330
Let’s go get ready.

503
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:41,220
I hope the Fortress is still intact

504
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:42,460
when we get back.

505
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:45,530
Alright.

506
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:47,050
Let’s go.

507
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:06,940
Officials have agreed

508
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:08,530
to meet with me at the inn in two days.

509
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:09,810
We’d better hurry up.

510
00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:11,570
I’m sorry for the trouble, Chuchu.

511
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:12,530
No trouble at all

512
00:40:12,530 --> 00:40:14,050
as long as you’re here with me.

513
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:16,180
Let’s go.

514
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,330
Sure.

515
00:40:17,330 --> 00:40:18,290
-Hyah!
-Hyah!

516
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:51,050
Weapons you made are sharp

517
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:55,220
but fragile.

518
00:41:02,850 --> 00:41:03,740
Hey, you,

519
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,460
did you follow

520
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:10,260
Xie Yun’s method to the word?

521
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:12,500
We did, Lord Shen,

522
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:14,420
and the weapons

523
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:15,940
ended up like this.

524
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,130
I believe

525
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:20,570
he made a wrong demonstration

526
00:41:20,570 --> 00:41:22,500
deliberately for us to copy.

527
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,810
So weapons we made aren’t durable.

528
00:41:24,810 --> 00:41:26,940
Aren’t you an expert?

529
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:31,020
Couldn’t you tell what’s wrong?

530
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:37,530
Show me the new blade.

531
00:41:37,530 --> 00:41:38,220
Yes.

532
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:44,330
Hold it.

533
00:42:07,810 --> 00:42:09,500
If you

534
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:12,050
can’t be of use,

535
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:15,900
join your useless ancestors

536
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:18,180
in hell.

537
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:19,700
Lord Shen, Lord...

538
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:23,370
Lord Shen, Lord Shen,

539
00:42:23,370 --> 00:42:24,900
I think

540
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:26,260
I know

541
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:27,900
what he did wrong.

542
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:30,050
I’m listening.

543
00:42:30,570 --> 00:42:31,660
Crumbles

544
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:33,900
he added

545
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:36,940
weakened the blade,

546
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:38,940
so it broke

547
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:40,460
soon after being used.

548
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:42,420
Fix it now.

549
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:43,770
Yes. Yes.

550
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:56,660
How’s the investigation going?

551
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:58,050
Lord Lu,

552
00:42:58,050 --> 00:42:59,740
I’ve checked with those

553
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:00,660
who went to Hanshui Town that day.

554
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:01,940
They said

555
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:03,020
Lord Shen seemed to

556
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:04,660
left Lord Hu behind

557
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:06,660
to cover the rest of them.

558
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:07,770
So...

559
00:43:07,770 --> 00:43:09,610
So she got killed by Zhou Fei.

560
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:16,370
Shen Tianshu,

561
00:43:17,530 --> 00:43:20,370
we were always obedient

562
00:43:20,370 --> 00:43:21,900
and loyal,

563
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:25,370
but you

564
00:43:25,370 --> 00:43:27,850
threw us away like trash.

565
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:31,100
(Notes on Making Weapons)

566
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:10,370
I did it!

567
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:12,810
I did it!

568
00:44:13,570 --> 00:44:15,500
I succeeded!

569
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:18,740
Finally!

570
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:21,370
Yes! I nailed it!

571
00:44:21,370 --> 00:44:23,740
What’s the good news?

572
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:24,810
Lord Lu,

573
00:44:24,810 --> 00:44:28,020
I’ve cracked the Refinement of Iron.

574
00:44:28,770 --> 00:44:30,370
The newly made blade

575
00:44:30,370 --> 00:44:31,370
is sharp

576
00:44:31,370 --> 00:44:32,980
and unbreakable.

577
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:35,610
It’s the king of blades!

Yesterday, I was on patrol

581
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:18,180
and found that blacksmith
packing up to escape.

582
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:19,700
Turns out he had cracked
Refinement of Iron

583
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:21,610
and prepared to leave with it.

584
00:45:21,610 --> 00:45:23,420
