(Li Jinfeng, Fortress of the Forty-Eight)

Uncle!

00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:20,600
Brother-in-law,

24
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:23,100
please tell my sister

25
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:25,000
to keep this bracelet well.

26
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:26,570
Please…

27
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:29,510
Don’t let it

28
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:31,710
show up again.

29
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:49,970
Uncle!

Dad!

31

Jinfeng’s death

32
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,990
saved you and
Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

33
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:05,510
Now you don’t even

34
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:06,690
know who the guy is

35
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:08,310
and you just let him go,

36
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,790
putting the whole
Fortress of the Forty-Eight in danger!

37
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,340
Do you want us to experience

38
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,620
what happened ten years ago again?

39
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,030
I should just kill you now!

40
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,260
-Auntie!
-Auntie!

41
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,220
-Please don’t!
-None of your business! Stay aside!

42
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:24,990
Aren’t you having a recuperation
in Repenting Hall?

43
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,500
Which brat disturbed you?

44
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,620
Jinrong,

45
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:32,610
you have already

46
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,040
scolded and punished her.

47
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:35,680
Could you please listen to my opinion?

48
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:37,040
Dad.

49
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,040
Fei,

50
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,670
don’t speak.

51
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:52,880
Guys,

52
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,580
actually what she said

53
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,290
was not unreasonable.

54
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:00,030
We have always believed in

55
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:00,960
the sense of morality.

56
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:03,170
Of course we can’t return evil for good,

57
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:03,500
right?

58
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,040
Yeah.

59
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,030
Right.

60
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,170
That’s right.

61
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:09,410
What’s more, Fei and Sheng

62
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,800
grew up together with our protection.

63
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,550
They have never walked out of here.

64
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:15,840
Of course we know

65
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,260
that it’s impossible for them

66
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:19,180
to collude with outsiders.

67
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,640
-Yeah.
-Right.

68
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:24,050
Ms. Wang is totally right.

69
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,250
But even so,

70
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,740
Fei thought the trespasser was not evil.

71
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:33,960
It’s just her one-sided view.

72
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,750
We still have to catch that trespasser.

73
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:39,460
Jinrong,

74
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,760
here is my advice.

75
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,390
You can interrogate him yourself

76
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,530
after we catch him.

77
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,680
-Yeah. Right.
-That’s right.

78
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:51,440
Yeah. Right.

79
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,180
Leader,

80
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,810
now the key point is

81
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:57,000
to discuss how to catch the intruder.

82
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:58,310
That’s right, Auntie.

83
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:59,560
Yeah. Right.

84
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,920
Let’s go back to the room first.

85
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:15,660
OK.

86
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:17,100
Fei.

87
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:27,380
(To be self-effacing)

88
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,060
On my shoulder is

89
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:34,010
the whole Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

90
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:37,420
Fei

91
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,160
and Sheng

92
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,360
are coming of age.

93
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:44,110
There are many

94
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,020
capable masters here.

95
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,730
You don’t have to put all the

96
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:51,240
pressures on yourself to protect here.

97
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,890
You’re just trapped in the shell
made by yourself.

98
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:01,820
My Lord,

99
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,270
our people failed to sneak into
the Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

100
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:06,820
It’s fine.

101
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:10,750
This trip is just to explore
the condition of Ximo River.

102
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:14,160
It’s OK that the boy got into there.

103
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,240
Zhou Yitang must be about to come
out of seclusion.

104
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:21,040
Tell Tong Tianyang

105
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,180
to take action now.

106
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:24,090
Yes.

107
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:02,320
Does it still hurt?

108
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,080
I won’t die.

109
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,100
What a bad temper.

110
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,160
Just like your mother.

111
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,930
I’m not like her.

112
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:12,420
It’s her hobby to beat me.

113
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:14,490
That’s rude.

114
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:16,010
She is your mother.

115
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:19,980
(True self)

116
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:21,540
Dad,

117
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,950
do you know how dangerous it was
in the Spinning Wire Formation?

118
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,680
That guy saved our lives!

119
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:29,360
Shouldn’t I save him?

120
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,580
Why am I wrong to help him?

121
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:36,520
Li Sheng broke into

122
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,510
the Spinning Wire Formation
without permission.

123
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,200
He didn’t get punished.

124
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:41,910
She only punished me.

125
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:45,760
He is the eldest grandson of the Li’s.

126
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:47,910
Was I found at a wild grave?

127
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:50,170
Who taught you to speak like that?

128
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,540
Everything I did was wrong
since childhood.

129
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,260
He lost his parents when he was little.

130
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:00,200
You shouldn’t have said that about him.

131
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:03,120
The three of us cause troubles together.

132
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:04,970
Li Sheng is always the chief plotter.

133
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,300
But I’m the one who always
took the blame.

134
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,270
We practiced martial arts together.

135
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,380
He could only beat me once in a while.

136
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,740
But Mom just kept praising him.

137
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:17,720
I have never got even

138
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,220
a recognition from her.

139
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:22,410
Fei,

140
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:23,940
in the future,

141
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:27,460
you can tell me your thoughts.

142
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:29,860
You will feel better after that.

143
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:31,130
I…

144
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:34,060
I’m clumsy of speech.

145
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,660
I don’t want to explain.

146
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,380
It’s all passed anyway.

147
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:40,470
Every time I feel wronged,

148
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,750
as long as I think of my uncle,

149
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:45,130
nothing will be a big deal.

150
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:52,060
Dad, he saved me and Li Sheng.

151
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:53,410
Why can’t I

152
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:55,380
help him?

153
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:56,930
Why am I wrong?

154
00:08:58,900 --> 00:08:59,810
Of course you’re not wrong.

155
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:01,600
But…

156
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:02,750
-But what?
-I…

157
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:41,460
Luckily, the injury is not so serious.

158
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:43,600
Let her have a good rest.

159
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,800
Let’s get out.

160
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,840
It’s scary to think about it.

161
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,300
Fei and I

162
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,510
almost died at Ximo River.

163
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,450
Can you just stop trying to leave here?

164
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,680
If you do that again,

165
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,220
I will jump down from here.

166
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,140
Let me help you.

167
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:19,510
Sheng! Sheng! Sheng!

168
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:20,700
-Go ahead.
-Sheng. Sheng.

169
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,220
My bad. I was wrong.

170
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:23,520
Don’t worry.

171
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:25,530
I’m still trying to leave.

172
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,600
But I won’t go through Ximo River.

173
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,830
I’ll take the school exam of

174
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,530
Xiushan Hall and leave here
through the gate aboveboard.

175
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:37,340
(Repenting Hall)

176
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:42,030
This is the last game of chess

177
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,550
I played before I came here.

178
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:47,790
It happened to become

179
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:49,640
an ingenious one.

180
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,210
There are many traps in it

181
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:56,670
and it’s totally complicated.

182
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:01,380
Once the piece is put,

183
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:03,420
it’s hard

184
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:04,990
to tell

185
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:06,810
if it’s alive or dead.

186
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:09,360
I have been stuck in a rut

187
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,860
and don’t know what to do.

188
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,700
I think you’re just trapping yourself.

189
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:17,340
Over the years,

190
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,180
I have been limiting myself.

191
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:27,820
If you figure out how to play the next,

192
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:32,380
will you go on or will you stop?

193
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:09,840
How could

194
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,760
Leader Li be so cruel?

195
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,870
Is it because

196
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:23,980
she let me go?

197
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:57,510
Come out.

198
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,040
Weed Spirit!

199
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:06,700
I knew you would come.

200
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:08,980
What are you doing here?

201
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:16,720
What’s this?

202
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:18,600
I always take this with me.

203
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:19,440
It’s for your injury.

204
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:24,860
You saw all of it?

205
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:26,810
No.

206
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:27,810
I guessed it.

207
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,510
By the way, I asked you last time…

208
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,420
Hush!

209
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,160
It’s not a good place to talk.

210
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:38,710
Let me take you to another place.

211
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:45,260
Come here. This way.

212
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:47,320
Get in there.

213
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:01,860
What’s your goal to be in our place?

214
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,170
Don’t try to come out if you don’t
make it clear.

215
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:10,750
This is such a good place.

216
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:11,700
I don’t really

217
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:13,920
want to go out for now.

218
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:19,410
Do you have any food?

219
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:28,870
Thank you.

220
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,020
I take it with me to feed dogs.

221
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:48,800
Even the dogs here

222
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:51,500
can have such good food?

223
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:57,690
Say it!

224
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:00,440
What are you here for?

225
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:07,530
I have told you everything I know.

226
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,790
Do you have any grudges with my mom?

227
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:17,910
How could it be?

228
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,050
I was still a kid

229
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:21,070
when your mom was making her living.

230
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:24,180
But maybe your mom

231
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:26,230
has some grudges with the man

232
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:27,530
called Wang Lin who sent me here.

233
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:30,940
Who is Wang Lin?

234
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:33,460
And who is Lord Gantang?

235
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,410
I didn’t expect Lord Gantang’s daughter

236
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:38,600
to be

237
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,680
so simple and naive.

238
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:46,520
I won’t feed the dog anymore.

239
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,790
Lord Gantang is my father.

240
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:57,790
What’s your relationship with Wang Lin?

241
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:00,300
General Wang,

242
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:02,590
is it worth this?

243
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,880
Do we have to do this?

244
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:08,240
(Loyal and Brave Wang Lin’s Grave)
It would be a dangerous trip.

245
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:10,520
I made myself a grave with no regrets.

246
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,830
(Wang Lin Anping Army)
You will go back to normal

247
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:17,800
after one hour.

248
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,340
At that time, the war should start.

249
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:22,170
Please don’t forget

250
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:23,530
what I entrusted you.

251
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:30,350
Hope you can deliver this token

252
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:31,720
to Zhou Yitang

253
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,140
and invite him to lead Anping Army.

254
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:05,730
No relationship.

255
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:07,840
I just think he is a poor

256
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:08,610
old man.

257
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:10,180
So I promised to do him this favor.

258
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,570
You just feel sorry for an old man?

259
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:15,700
And…

260
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,300
You risked your life to break into

261
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,620
the Fortress of the Forty-Eight?

262
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,340
Not because of him.

263
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,630
It’s because of the poor Wang Lin.

264
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,580
He had contributed all his life.

265
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,640
He is kind of

266
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:36,340
a hero.

267
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,060
The hero comes to a dead end.

268
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:40,620
Isn’t it a pity?

269
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:43,630
Since I can do nothing but

270
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:44,780
run fast,

271
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:47,270
it’s OK for me to do him this favor.

272
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,730
A hero like Wang Lin

273
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,880
has such a regrettable end.

274
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:55,700
If a pretty girl like you

275
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,640
who loses her youth

276
00:17:57,970 --> 00:17:58,800
and gets grey-haired,

277
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,600
it’ll also be a pity.

278
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,520
Since I saw this,

279
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,150
I ought to help.

280
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,540
But you still haven’t told me

281
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:18,210
why my mom doesn’t allow you
to meet my dad.

282
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:22,690
(To be self-effacing)

283
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:24,020
(To be self-effacing)
Repenting Hall is far.

284
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:25,670
(To be self-effacing)
But you like to come here.

285
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,780
Uncle, what are you repenting for?

286
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,450
I will tell you if you

287
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,280
can promise me one thing.

288
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:45,580
Go ahead.

289
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:49,850
Don’t get angry in the future

290
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:50,860
no matter what I do.

291
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:54,490
Why should I be angry?

292
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:57,540
Alright.

293
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:58,990
Since you said that,

294
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,080
I can rest assured.

295
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:03,500
Are you insane?

296
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:07,240
Xie Yun!

297
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,400
Don’t let me catch you again!

298
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:13,750
Why are there always assassins

299
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:16,800
who keep venturing to assassinate you?

300
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:22,990
And why is there someone

301
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:25,880
risking his life to deliver
the message to you?

302
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:31,400
Why does Auntie ask most of the guards

303
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,260
to protect you?

304
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,530
You overheard what your auntie said?

305
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:41,900
Fei got punished

306
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,400
because of me.

307
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,980
I don’t want this at all.

308
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:45,640
Sheng,

309
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:47,010
everyone

310
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,270
has his strong points,

311
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,400
and also

312
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:53,350
weak points.

313
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,940
You just haven’t found

314
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:56,740
the right place for yourself.

315
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,120
Just like

316
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:02,700
you?

317
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:14,290
I heard Lord Gantang is living
a secluded life

318
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,550
in the Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

319
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:18,440
He is rarely out of the place.

320
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:20,480
You want him to come out?

321
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:22,400
Don’t you worry about this.

322
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:24,470
But this time you go there,

323
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,380
don’t alert

324
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:27,840
the leader, Li Jinrong.

325
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,840
Having the ability but not being in
the right position.

326
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:39,200
That’s what the mistake is.

327
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,380
I have been away from the position
I should be

328
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,620
for so long.

329
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:46,750
Dad.

330
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:49,550
Fei.

331
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:53,380
It’s OK. I’m here to stay with you.

332
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:03,970
Leader.

333
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,650
This song has disappeared

334
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:07,520
for so many years.

335
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:27,770
What should come will always come.

336
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:33,790
You can never avoid it.

337
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:35,090
Uncle,

338
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,180
have you heard of this song?

339
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,600
This song is called “Anping Song”.

340
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:42,480
I’m so familiar with it.

341
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,890
This song to me

342
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,460
is like an old friend.

343
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:51,910
It’s written when I was

344
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:55,480
following the uprising under Wang Lin.

345
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,550
Leader Li,

346
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,560
sorry to have kept you waiting.

347
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,000
I’m not as fast as your flute.

348
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,650
This is Anping Token.

349
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,960
Prosperous and flourishing country?

350
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,340
What a lie.

351
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,720
It didn’t help me relax here
a while longer.

352
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:41,220
(Prosperous and flourishing country)

353
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:42,660
Didn’t you say

354
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:44,230
you wouldn’t allow it to leave you?

355
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:47,150
I came a long way here

356
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,750
just to deliver the message.

357
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:51,800
This is just a small token.

358
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,560
Now the message has arrived.

359
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:55,580
It’s just a waste iron now.

360
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:57,060
Isn’t it to put the cart
before the horse

361
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,760
if I risk my life for it?

362
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,590
The message has arrived?

363
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:04,130
You really think you can

364
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:04,980
survive by only playing that song?

365
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:08,580
What should come will always come.

366
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:10,500
I think, Leader Li,

367
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,200
you must know the truth in mind.

368
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:14,800
Or, how could you even not dare

369
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,290
to let Lord Gantang come?

370
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,110
You think I don’t dare to kill you?

371
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:18,700
Jinrong.

372
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:26,630
You brat!

373
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:27,520
How dare you follow me?

374
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:29,220
So rude.

375
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:30,620
Come back here.

376
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:38,000
Greetings, Lord Gantang.

377
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,180
Spare it.

378
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:55,100
(Prosperous and flourishing country)

379
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:57,480
I have already paid a debt

380
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,790
of gratitude.

381
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,300
I’m just an errand boy.

382
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,030
I know nothing of your old grudges.

383
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,350
But,

384
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,620
if Lord Gantang doesn’t want to see me,

385
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:10,130
you don’t need to show up,

386
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,110
do you?

387
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,320
If I didn’t

388
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:17,310
hear your song at all,

389
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:18,950
what would you do?

390
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:20,910
That doesn’t matter.

391
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,710
The one who can’t hear my flute

392
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,090
is not the one I want to see.

393
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:27,730
The Fortress of the Forty-Eight got
really a beautiful view.

394
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,140
Even if I failed to meet you,

395
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,260
it’s still worth a trip here.

396
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:33,980
Now I’m just a loser out of touch
with reality.

397
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,160
Why bother coming to me?

398
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:44,230
It’s like a whale that beached

399
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:45,950
and a phoenix that lost its wings.

400
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,210
A small potato like me can’t understand.

401
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,760
Lord Gantang, please don’t ask me
about what I don’t know.

402
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:53,560
Young man,

403
00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:55,600
you’re really good at talking.

404
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:58,230
I feel flattered.

405
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,930
A man like me

406
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:01,630
only has two strengths.

407
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:03,020
Running fast, and talking well.

408
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:06,420
Or, why should General Wang
send me here?

409
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:08,840
Don’t need to waste time with him.

410
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,000
(Repenting Hall)
Guards!

411
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,300
(Repenting Hall)
Take down this jerk!

412
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,180
Wait.

413
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:15,700
Jinrong.

414
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:26,560
Fei,

415
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:27,810
go ahead

416
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:31,210
and help me get the Anping Token.

417
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:35,580
(Prosperous and flourishing country)

418
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:41,250
Just go.

419
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:01,860
(Prosperous and flourishing country)

420
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:14,740
(Repenting Hall)

421
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:21,920
You have already decided, right?

422
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:31,990
I should have known it.

423
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:34,640
How could people like you

424
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,380
be willing to live in seclusion for
all this life

425
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,890
far away from the outside world?

426
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:46,270
Give it to your dad.

427
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:06,580
(Prosperous and flourishing country)

428
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,960
Jinrong! Jin…

429
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:24,130
Mr. Xie…

430
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,610
I think this is not your original name.

431
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,510
Where are you from?

432
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:32,200
I was born in troubled times with no
fixed residence.

433
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:33,260
Just an ordinary person.

434
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:37,080
What’s the point that whether it’s
my original name or not?

435
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,290
Hometown is also a foreign land.

436
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:41,930
Sheng,

437
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:44,270
Mr. Xie

438
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:46,330
is my guest.

439
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:48,700
Please take good care of him for me.

440
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:51,290
Thank you, Lord Gantang.

441
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,150
Have you arranged all the receptions
along the way?

442
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:57,960
Yes, General.

443
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,320
But Chunhui town is under the
Fortress’s management.

444
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:01,540
It’s hard for us to complete.

445
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:02,180
(Wen Yu Anping Army)

446
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,060
(Wen Yu Anping Army)
Tomorrow, we will go to the Fortress

447
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,390
to greet Lord Gantang.

448
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:06,440
Yes.

449
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,460
What did he tell you?

450
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:15,750
He said he would pass the Fortress
onto me.

451
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,790
I’m not asking you that.

452
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:19,930
What do you want to know?

453
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,260
Is he really leaving?

454
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:29,800
Didn’t you give him the token yourself?

455
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,290
So what?

456
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:34,170
It must be the token

457
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:35,660
which means he agrees to go out.

458
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,160
Since he has taken it,

459
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:38,850
he has to leave.

460
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,350
That’s because he is shy and

461
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:44,000
felt embarrassed to refuse in person.

462
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:45,130
So he accepted it temporarily

463
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,340
and said he would consider it.

464
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:48,950
He won’t leave.

465
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:01,040
Don’t tell my mom about this.

466
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,260
Why is the wine so sour?

467
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:12,970
It’s not like what I imagined.

468
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:16,660
Why do I think

469
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:18,140
the wine is sweet?

470
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,160
And that…

471
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:30,290
That man surnamed Xie.

472
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:32,290
He said here in our place,

473
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:33,950
even the dog could have good food.

474
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:36,120
The Mr. Xie you said

475
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:38,430
saved your life at Ximo River.

476
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,740
You even disobeyed your mom’s order

477
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:43,020
to save his life.

478
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:46,140
You can gratefully
tell right from wrong.

479
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:47,830
I really like that.

480
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:52,410
Dad,

481
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:55,760
are you really leaving?

482
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:58,720
Can you take me with you?

483
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:03,240
Every time when Mom beat me harshly,

484
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,580
I hope you can come to save me.

485
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,150
Your mom never beat you too harshly.

486
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:13,070
She already has shown mercy.

487
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:11,620
What a brat.

488
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,880
I just want to be a carefree person

489
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,340
with no worries.

490
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:18,680
I didn’t expect that

491
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,880
once in a while I was kind enough to

492
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:22,230
help General Wang Lin to send a message,

493
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:24,970
I still broke someone’s heart.

494
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,250
Little girls always have to grow up.

495
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:35,890
It’s weird.

496
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:37,850
I, as a passerby,

497
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:39,600
don’t want to leave now.

498
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:41,540
But, Lord Gantang,

499
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,630
you’re leaving with no cares.

500
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:49,930
People always part.

501
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:51,780
Rises and falls have no regulations.

502
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,100
Looks like you still haven’t
seen it through.

503
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:57,820
Childe, you are knowledgable,

504
00:31:58,340 --> 00:31:59,190
good at martial skills,

505
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:01,230
and also keep your promise.

506
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:02,840
I wonder who your master is.

507
00:32:06,810 --> 00:32:07,990
I still got other things to do.

508
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,050
Let’s just part here.

509
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:11,040
It’s a long way to the south.

510
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,400
Please take care.

511
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:40,820
I have been waiting for you
for more than ten years.

512
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:42,880
Finally, you are here.

513
00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:48,340
Do you remember the money

514
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,010
you owed me for wine?

515
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:55,180
You haven’t paid back the money

516
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:56,010
I lent you for the songs as well.

517
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,160
I still remember it.

518
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:31,960
Dad,

519
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,860
please don’t leave here, OK?

520
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:39,450
What I have to do

521
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:41,970
is really important.

522
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:44,660
Is it more important than my mom?

523
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:46,000
Is it more important than me?

524
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:51,540
Stop her.

525
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:51,900
Yes.

526
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:53,440
Stop her.

527
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:10,900
Ms. Zhou,

528
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:13,500
I’m not a careful person.

529
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:15,140
I may hurt you.

530
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:17,860
Don’t make it hard for me.

531
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:20,300
Step aside.

532
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:43,520
Dad!

533
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,650
Take me with you!

534
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:45,710
I can protect you!

535
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:24,930
Fei,

536
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:27,120
stop fighting.

537
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,840
I have told you before that

538
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:35,840
you couldn’t have it both ways.

539
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:40,080
But today I just want to tell you

540
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,920
what is taking

541
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:44,220
and what is giving up.

542
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,460
To take or to give up doesn’t depend

543
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:51,290
on whether you admit

544
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:53,810
or not.

545
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:56,980
Because it’s the truth of the strong.

546
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,030
You should succeed in the civil

547
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,950
or the military.

548
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,920
Or you will just be a nobody

549
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:12,180
who has to live a life with no choices.

550
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:13,770
You won’t have the right to decide
whether to take or to give up.

551
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:17,600
It will be a shame.

552
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,950
You said you could protect me.

553
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:23,500
But you haven’t even tried

554
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:24,640
to step out of this gate.

555
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,190
Is it your turn to

556
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,450
decide whether to

557
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:32,570
go with me or stay?

558
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:38,000
Grow up.

559
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:41,740
We will meet someday.

560
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:44,560
The world is always there.

561
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,120
It depends on when you can come
and go freely.

562
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:51,590
Fei,

563
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:55,920
I’m leaving.

564
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:58,450
Dad…

565
00:36:58,450 --> 00:36:59,290
Take care.

566
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,260
Dad…

567
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:07,750
Dad!

568
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:31,200
My mom was right.

569
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:34,660
I shouldn’t have saved you.

570
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:49,280
Get lost!

571
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,710
I didn’t expect that

572
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:19,910
you’d come in person.

573
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:23,280
It’s still in the boundary
of the Fortress.

574
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:25,330
Do you dare?

575
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,290
It’s been more than ten years.

576
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:33,950
My feud with the Fortress
of the Forty-Eight is so deep.

577
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,770
Now Lord Gantang comes out
of the seclusion.

578
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,800
Of course I should come to greet him.

579
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:44,100
Then you should ask whether my sword

580
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,060
can allow you or not.

581
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,320
Li Jinrong,

582
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,640
we’ll see each other soon.

583
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,340
