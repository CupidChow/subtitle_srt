=Episode 36=

17
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:42,310
You heard what that Elder said.

18
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,230
There’s miasma in the woods.

19
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:45,510
Guards are outside all year round

20
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:47,680
and must have something
to protect themselves.

21
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:50,510
If we went in without their sachets,

22
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:51,870
the miasma

23
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,550
could knock us out

24
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:55,550
and kill us eventually.

25
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,760
Really?

26
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:00,310
-Let’s go.
-Let’s go.

27
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:01,270
Come on.

28
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:05,510
Slow down.

29
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,750
Who are you?

30
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,030
Is this the Cloud Ravine?

31
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:24,910
No entry for strangers.

32
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:25,880
You should go.

33
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,440
You traitor!

34
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,720
As the chief,

35
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,030
you disregarded

36
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:47,440
the rules.

37
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,720
Now that

38
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,830
you’re resigning from your post,

39
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:52,800
I’ll remove you from it.

40
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,090
But we can’t be leaderless.

41
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,910
I’ve invited you over

42
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:00,190
for discussion.

43
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,830
I think we should select

44
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:04,110
a new leader

45
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:05,720
from the younger generation.

46
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,170
We’ve been practicing
medicine for generations.

47
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:10,290
As per the tradition,

48
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:12,270
we’ll have a medicine competition.

49
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,190
The winner

50
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,390
will lead us in the future.

51
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,240
Report!

52
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,240
Bad news.

53
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,190
Those two have poisoned the guards

54
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,390
to break into the Forbidden Forest.

55
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:26,910
The miasma in the woods could kill them

56
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:29,110
if we didn’t get them out quickly.

57
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:30,910
Go!

58
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,190
Yes.

59
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:56,190
Would that bonehead be in trouble?

60
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,240
He would

61
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,390
with us there.

62
00:03:58,390 --> 00:03:59,360
His own people

63
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,670
wouldn’t kill him.

64
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:01,750
Were he safe,

65
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,080
why didn’t he come to join us?

66
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,080
He’d better not.

67
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,270
We only have two sachets.

68
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:06,390
There’s no more for him.

69
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:10,960
There you are.

70
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,390
Aren’t you looking for the Flaming Sage?

71
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:13,390
This way.

72
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:14,320
Let’s go.

73
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,320
Wait.

74
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,200
The forest ahead is filled with miasma.

75
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,790
There are only two sachets.

76
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,670
We’re running out of time. Let’s go!

77
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:21,640
-Let’s go.
-Let’s go.

78
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:24,200
Hey...

79
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,640
Come on!

80
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,350
Yang Jin

81
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:34,320
is a handful.

82
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,950
Shame on him!

83
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,000
Don’t worry too much.

84
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,550
There’s an easy fix.

85
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:46,390
If you’re to select the most skilled one

86
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:48,350
in medicine to be the new chief,

87
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,950
I can be that person.

88
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:54,000
That’s bold.

89
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,600
Who are you

90
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,880
to brag to us?

91
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:01,070
Let’s see

92
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:02,920
whether I’m bragging or not.

93
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,920
I can’t go any further.

94
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,760
Don’t pant

95
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,550
unless you want more
miasma in your system.

96
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:27,270
-Bonehead!
-Bonehead!

97
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,200
You’re weak!

98
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:38,950
No wonder the Elders say

99
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,720
this place is off-limits

100
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,230
and heavily guarded.

101
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:43,920
What should we do?

102
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,440
We can get another sachet.

103
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,720
No.

104
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,320
I can’t rob my own people.

105
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,390
But we only have two.

106
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:51,040
How about this?

107
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,670
Give me the sachet.

108
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:54,670
We’ll go.

109
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:56,270
You know the Valley well.

110
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:58,670
Just go outside

111
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:00,040
and find a place to hide.

112
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,320
We’ll join you

113
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,440
once we’re out with that herb.

114
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,440
No.

115
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,600
You don’t know

116
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,510
how dangerous this place is.

117
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:11,550
Neither of you is skilled enough

118
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:13,510
to protect yourself.

119
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:14,720
Look,

120
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:16,670
Yan and I will go.

121
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:18,040
You can hide somewhere.

122
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,070
Sure.

123
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,510
Just one question.

124
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:25,070
Do you know

125
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:26,320
what the Flaming Sage looks like?

126
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:33,230
In that case,

127
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:34,390
let’s go get it.

128
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:35,390
Yan,

129
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:37,000
you go hide.

130
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,950
Look at you.

131
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:38,920
You don’t recognize the herb,

132
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,070
nor do you have enough skills.

133
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:40,550
You...

134
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:41,230
You...

135
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:44,920
Your skills are fine,

136
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,390
but not as good as his,

137
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:47,230
right?

138
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:49,110
We’ll be right back.

139
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,350
No.

140
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:51,070
How could you two

141
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,440
leave me here alone?

142
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,720
You can’t!

143
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,880
You can’t.

144
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,230
I won’t leave without you.

145
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:03,760
Fine.

146
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,550
You are

147
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:08,070
the heiress to the Big Medicine Valley?

148
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,480
All their members

149
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,720
were killed 20 years ago.

150
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,230
Where did you get their prescriptions

151
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,230
and what’s your history with us?

152
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,480
All that can wait

153
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,270
after the competition.

154
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:28,950
Alright?

155
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:44,600
Elder!

156
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,350
Stop it!

157
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:49,440
You people

158
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,510
don’t deserve your reputation.

159
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,670
We’ve agreed

160
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,200
that the loser must admit defeat,

161
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:01,000
alive or dead.

162
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,270
But I don’t understand

163
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:05,880
how I lost.

164
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,040
I’ll tell you.

165
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:12,230
I knew what antidote you’d use

166
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:14,920
to remove my poison

167
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,440
and the herbs you used

168
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,600
to make that antidote.

169
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,110
One of them could cure you,

170
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:23,230
but if taken with liquor,

171
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:24,670
it’d become poisonous.

172
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:28,440
Herbs can kill or heal people.

173
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,950
How did you forget that?

174
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,200
Don’t worry.

175
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:38,080
That poison

176
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:39,880
won’t kill you,

177
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,710
but will only make you too weak

178
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:44,320
to move.

179
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:47,670
You drank my liquor.

180
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,350
How come nothing happened to you?

181
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,670
(Animal characters made by CG)

182
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:55,150
Do you mean this?

183
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:59,230
You meant to poison me

184
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:00,760
with this spider while I wasn’t looking.

185
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,080
Too bad,

186
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:06,320
I grew up with things like that.

187
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,640
They can’t hurt me at all.

188
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:12,910
As poisonous as your spider is,

189
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:14,440
it wouldn’t go

190
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,320
anywhere near me.

191
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,150
Who are you?

192
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:21,590
The only heiress to
the Big Medicine Valley.

193
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:23,320
Don’t you know?

194
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:28,350
Your ancestor

195
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:30,250
rose from a quack.

196
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,710
He couldn’t have founded this sect

197
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:35,030
without our Book of Almighty Medicine

198
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:38,470
he peeked.

199
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:39,790
Am I right,

200
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:41,470
Elder?

201
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:43,440
We’ve been living in seclusion for years

202
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,080
and never crossed paths with you.

203
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:49,470
Why are you coming at us?

204
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,030
It’s good that you admit it.

205
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:54,640
You aren’t as excelled at poison

206
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,520
as you are at medicine.

207
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,910
And you’ve been holing up here

208
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:01,080
in an attempt to escape from the chaos.

209
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,880
Keeping your sect is a waste of space.

210
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,760
The world only needs one sect,

211
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,030
that is, Demons Manor.

212
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,710
You’re that traitor

213
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:19,760
who set the Big Medicine Valley on fire!

214
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,230
Pathetic Clam!

215
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,470
Bonehead,

216
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,960
slow down.

217
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,550
I got it!

218
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:34,960
If one of you carries me,

219
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,520
I’ll put the sachet near the neck

220
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,520
and we can share it.

221
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,520
Good idea.

222
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,400
-You do it!
-You do it!

223
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,440
Bonehead,

224
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,910
do you know where to go?

225
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,880
Flaming Sage

226
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,840
is poisonous,

227
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:58,110
so it must be where
the miasma comes from.

228
00:10:58,110 --> 00:10:59,880
Go to the source of this miasma

229
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,880
and we’ll find it.

230
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,790
Right.

231
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:02,880
Go straight.

232
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,970
We’ll find it there.

233
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:06,710
Why did you ask that bonehead

234
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:08,030
instead of me?

235
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:09,590
This is his place after all.

236
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:10,710
Maybe Chief Yang

237
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:12,640
knows something we don’t.

238
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,840
What’s wrong?

239
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:19,200
I’m no longer their chief.

240
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,880
After you left,

241
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,590
they deposed me.

242
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,230
Really?

243
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:26,440
That bad?

244
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:29,030
I’m sorry.

245
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:31,880
I didn’t expect the consequence

246
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,880
would be so severe.

247
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,590
It’s my fault.

248
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:37,110
Never mind.

249
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:39,400
I don’t want it anyway.

250
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,590
I was thinking about

251
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,030
battling others every day

252
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:43,760
and I was seldom here.

253
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,960
I failed them.

254
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,200
This gives me a sense of closure.

255
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:48,520
Let’s go.

256
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:02,520
The miasma is getting stronger ahead.

257
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:05,080
We’re going in the right direction.

258
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,550
But we’re no longer safe

259
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:07,640
even with

260
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,790
the sachets.

261
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,840
What should we do?

262
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:14,280
Remember.

263
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,880
Stay calm and focused.

264
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,880
Do not run or fight.

265
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,150
Inhale

266
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:20,670
as little miasma as possible.

267
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:24,520
Let’s go.

268
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:26,030
Let’s go.

269
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,000
Elder,

270
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,200
if you work with me,

271
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,230
I may consider

272
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,110
letting your disciples go.

273
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,640
What do you want?

274
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,030
Have people come here lately

275
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:47,550
for the Flaming Sage?

276
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,320
No.

277
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,570
It’s the most poisonous herb.

278
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,910
What would others need it for?

279
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:56,640
Snake keeper,

280
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,230
are we there?

281
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,760
Almost there.

282
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:01,790
Almost there.

283
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:03,880
What’s the white thingy?

284
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,110
Flaming Sage’s poison

285
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:07,880
attracts other poisonous creatures

286
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,550
to nest around it.

287
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:11,080
They must’ve laid

288
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,110
those white eggs.

289
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:16,280
I’m not sure what they are,

290
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,200
but I know for sure

291
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,230
that if one is broken,

292
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:23,110
we’ll be attacked by all of them.

293
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,150
That’s the Flaming Sage.

294
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:41,840
Elder,

295
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,440
you seldom lie, do you?

296
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,760
Tell me the truth, or I’ll kill him

297
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,960
and the rest of them one by one

298
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,030
until you speak.

299
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,350
Chief is back with his friends.

300
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:57,640
Shut up!

301
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,710
Please spare me!

302
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,200
Be... Be careful.

303
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,760
If I accidentally step on the eggs,

304
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,350
I’ll toss the herb to you.

305
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:18,880
Watch your step.

306
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,080
You’re back, Miss.

307
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,150
May I have

308
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:48,000
some hot water?

309
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,640
Sure. Just a minute.

310
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,340
(Liquor)

311
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:43,670
Aren’t you with the Xingnan Sect?

312
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,350
What are you doing here?

313
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,470
Is Miss Wu with you?

314
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:52,710
No... no... she isn’t.

315
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:54,030
We parted long ago

316
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:56,760
and we’re here to
deliver Mr. Li’s message.

317
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,790
What message?

318
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,030
Where are you going?

319
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:02,440
I’m not done yet.

320
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,880
I... I can’t stay.

321
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,320
My brother is waiting for me.

322
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,640
Mr. Zhu is also here?

323
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:10,280
Ying’er.

324
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:15,790
Sir,

325
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,640
what can I do for you?

326
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,280
Sir?

327
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,230
You’re born too weak

328
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:25,760
to practice martial arts,

329
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:28,080
and you’re doomed

330
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,590
to become a failure.

331
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,230
What can you do for me?

332
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,000
So what if I don’t
practice martial arts?

333
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:41,350
Without them,

334
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:46,230
you’ll only get bullied.

335
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,320
Actually, I can use a few dogs.

336
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:54,030
If you bark for me,

337
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:57,080
I’ll teach you some skills
to protect yourself.

338
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:59,080
That way,

339
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,840
you can be the bully
instead of being bullied.

340
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,880
As the heir to Xingnan Sect,

341
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,400
I’d never allow such degradation.

342
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:06,760
Degradation?

343
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:10,190
Do you mean taking orders from me

344
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:12,880
or the way I look?

345
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:16,470
Do unto others
as you would have them do unto you.

346
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:17,800
Mr. Yin,

347
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,680
you stepped forward

348
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,800
and beat back the evil ones
of the Four-guardian Mountain.

349
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,430
Everyone appreciated that.

350
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:27,040
But look what you’re doing now!

351
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,800
How are you different
from Zheng Luosheng?

352
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,040
Miss Zhou,

353
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,040
there you are!

354
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,830
Mr. Zhu is attacked by someone inside.

355
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:39,920
He needs your help.

356
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:40,710
I see.

357
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,830
Enough of

358
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,110
your lies!

359
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:47,000
You’re crazy!

360
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:58,230
Zhou Fei?

361
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:04,800
Yin Pei!

362
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,920
Yes,

363
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,880
it’s me.

364
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,110
It’s been a while.

365
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,590
Why are you dressed up like this?

366
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:16,800
You didn’t learn your lesson

367
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,800
back at Sanchun Inn, did you?

368
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,760
I should’ve asked Mr. Ji

369
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,760
to slap you more.

370
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,430
Mind your own business!

371
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:44,520
What now?

372
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:46,310
Trying to escape?

373
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:48,070
After all that you’ve done,

374
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:49,280
are you still afraid?

375
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:52,830
I’m done wasting my time on you.

376
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:04,040
Are you alright?

377
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:08,470
Miss Zhou,

378
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:11,190
thanks for saving me again.

379
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:12,230
-I...
-Don’t mention it.

380
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:20,040
Miss Zhou,

381
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,310
finally!

382
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:23,640
Anything about Yang Jin and Poisoner?

383
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:26,070
They left for

384
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:27,040
the Cloud Ravine with Miss Li

385
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,470
for some herb

386
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:30,560
upon receiving your letter.

387
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:32,560
Got it.

388
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:33,760
Sir,

389
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,430
may I borrow the pigeon
of the Route Gang?

390
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,190
Of course.

391
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:39,310
I’ll go get it.

392
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:46,160
Miss Zhou,

393
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,880
how’s your injury?

394
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,310
I’m fine. Thanks for asking.

395
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:54,040
Where’s...?

396
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:55,590
Where’s Mr. Xie?

397
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,110
He went back to see his master.

398
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:01,830
I...

399
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:04,280
Is there anything else?

400
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,430
Mr. Li has a message for you.

401
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:09,950
He and Miss Wu

402
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:12,400
are with Madam Nichang at Qiaoyun House.

403
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,000
They’re fine.

404
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,230
You don’t need to worry.

405
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:18,830
Message received.

406
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:21,590
One more thing.

407
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,310
I mean...

408
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:26,680
I haven’t got to

409
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,920
thank you properly.

410
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,520
If you...

411
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,710
No need.

412
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:31,880
Don’t take it to heart.

413
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:34,830
Miss Zhou,

414
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:36,110
the pigeon is ready.

415
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:36,920
Please.

416
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:18,310
Is that from Miss Zhou?

417
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:23,920
Fei

418
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:24,590
has decided

419
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:26,470
to give the Seal of Cautiousness
to Mu Xiaoqiao.

420
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:28,160
If Wang Lin knew that,

421
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,760
he’d dig a way out of his grave.

422
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:35,350
Few can

423
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:38,160
overcome their obsession and greed.

424
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,710
I’ve seldom seen people

425
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:42,830
with a pure mind like Zhou Fei.

426
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:43,490
Anzhi,

427
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:46,520
you’re lucky.

428
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,920
I can’t say the same to Fei.

429
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,350
She’s already suffered so much

430
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:54,470
ever since she met me.

431
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,310
And

432
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:59,470
I’ll let her down again eventually.

433
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:03,470
She hasn’t given up

434
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:05,400
and she’s been doing her best

435
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,280
to collect all the herbs you need.

436
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,640
So

437
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,040
in the meantime,

438
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,470
you should take care of yourself.

439
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:15,400
Without the third herb,

440
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,350
you’ll become weaker and weaker.

441
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:21,710
I won’t give up.

442
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,800
But

443
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,520
I can’t bear to think

444
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,310
if all her efforts

445
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:29,040
turn out to be in vain,

446
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,040
won’t that

447
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:33,400
hurt her even more?

448
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:35,680
Whether we succeed or fail,

449
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,160
we only wish to live
with a clear conscience.

450
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,310
Anzhi,

451
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:41,560
you should know that.

452
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:50,640
Yes.

453
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,160
That’s how Fei is.

454
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,110
Sheng.

455
00:23:59,230 --> 00:23:59,950
Sheng.

456
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:02,760
Who is it?

457
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:04,470
It’s me.

458
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:05,470
Chuchu,

459
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:07,520
you finally woke up!

460
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,520
How long did I sleep?

461
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,830
You...

462
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:15,560
You look all haggard and worn.

463
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:17,680
Really?

464
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,470
Yin Pei killed Mr. Chongxiao.

465
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:26,040
I’ve been

466
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:28,400
gathering help to eliminate him

467
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,190
without taking enough rest.

468
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:35,640
I shouldn’t have bothered you with that.

469
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,640
Do you feel better?

470
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:39,400
Let me go get

471
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,310
Madam Nichang.

472
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:46,070
Wait.

473
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,520
I just woke up.

474
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,400
Can you stay with me for now?

475
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:56,920
Sure. No problem.

476
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,680
Why did you ask

477
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,640
to see me, Madam?

478
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:10,760
I heard

479
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:13,680
you’ve been planning to

480
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,350
eliminate Qinghui.

481
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:16,310
Yes.

482
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,950
That won’t be easy.

483
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,400
Can you make it?

484
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,310
You might think

485
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:25,400
I’m young and naive,

486
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,470
but after seeing what he’s done,

487
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:29,880
I cannot just stand by

488
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,190
and turn a blind eye to it.

489
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,640
Whether I’ll succeed

490
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,920
or not,

491
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,880
I’ll have to

492
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,000
try it first.

493
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:38,110
Well said!

494
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:40,760
Youngsters

495
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,160
are indeed brave.

496
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,070
So

497
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:46,310
how’s it going?

498
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,760
At this point, few are willing to

499
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,680
stick their necks out.

500
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,560
Tell them

501
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,760
you aren’t alone.

502
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,190
Yuyi Troupe

503
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:01,160
is your ally in this matter.

504
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,680
I know what’s on your mind.

505
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,230
We’ve been protecting ourselves

506
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:12,070
from the secular world

507
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:15,040
and we always stay away from trouble.

508
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,280
But this time is different.

509
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:20,430
Qinghui is Mountain Sword’s son.

510
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:22,230
I must do something

511
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:24,000
to stop him from ruining

512
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,110
his father’s reputation!

513
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:32,400
Wake up.

514
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:36,140
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!

515
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,740
Finally!

516
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,920
You’re too weak!

517
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,640
You passed out just now.

518
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:47,920
Did you come from the Cloud Ravine?

519
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:49,230
Why ask?

520
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:51,430
What are you up to?

521
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,950
Many have gone in
and out of there lately.

522
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,800
I mean...

523
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,040
Well,

524
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,350
we heard of the Cloud Ravine

525
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:01,070
and came for treatment,

526
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:03,040
but we got lost in the mountain.

527
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,520
You said many have gone in?

528
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,470
Who are they?

529
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:10,000
Maybe they can take us along.

530
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:12,470
Just now, a woman

531
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:13,310
and her followers

532
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:14,680
asked the way to the Cloud Ravine.

533
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:16,190
Before leaving,

534
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:18,280
she fed fruits to a dog at the gate.

535
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,040
It died instantly.

536
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:21,830
Where is it?

537
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:23,350
Next to the tree.

538
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,070
It’s her.

539
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:45,880
Who is it?

540
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,190
This is the fruit of
the Worry-burying Flower

541
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,070
of the Big Medicine Valley.

542
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,800
Only one person knows

543
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:53,950
how to grow it.

544
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,040
Is everything alright?

545
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:01,760
Who is it?

546
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,180
A traitor who defected to Demons Manor,

547
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:06,470
Pathetic Clam.

548
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,680
According to my observation,

549
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:38,070
they’ve already taken over the entrance.

550
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:40,470
Things could only be worse inside.

551
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:48,070
We have no other choice.

552
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,640
Let’s go. Follow me.

553
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,950
We’re poisoned by Pathetic Clam

554
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:48,950
without knowing the cure.

555
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:50,470
-Go find the antidote.
-Don’t move.

556
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:51,430
Go!

557
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:53,110
Go!

558
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:53,950
Trust me.

559
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,640
I’ll come back to save you.

560
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,680
Is Yang Jin

561
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:16,280
acting on impulse again
and engaging in a fight?

562
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,350
You’d better leave, Yan.

563
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:20,520
I didn’t stop you

564
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,400
from interfering in others’ business,

565
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,760
but this time isn’t the same.

566
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,310
Didn’t we agree

567
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:26,640
to come and go together?

568
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,590
You know...

569
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:32,590
That woman isn’t like other Demons.

570
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:34,040
You don’t know how capable she is.

571
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,040
Even if she...

572
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:39,430
Pathetic Clam poisoned
everyone inside.

573
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:40,920
They can’t move.

574
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:41,950
I don’t know how to make the antidote.

575
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:43,230
What to do?

576
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,560
She must’ve

577
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,810
had the antidote with her

578
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:48,020
just in case.

579
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,470
What can you do?

580
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:50,590
Rob her?

581
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,680
She’s occupied our place

582
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,280
and she’s staying at the Hall of Elders.

583
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,310
I have an idea.

584
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:02,950
I’ll

585
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:04,310
distract them

586
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:05,920
while you sneak in to get the antidote.

587
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,940
(Chestnut Shells)

588
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:16,280
Those fools

589
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,830
keep so many rare herbs

590
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:19,230
without using them. What a waste!

591
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,190
Congratulations!

592
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:22,350
We’re one step closer

593
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,680
to unifying all sects.

594
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,350
Still no sign of that girl?

595
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,640
Bad news!

596
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,830
The front is on fire.

597
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:34,800
Fire?

598
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:54,880
She’s left.

599
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,040
We must find the antidote

600
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,160
before she’s back.

601
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,950
Let’s go!

602
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,590
You’re our only hope.

603
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:16,470
Smell this. Is it the antidote?

604
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,070
Is it this one?

605
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,070
She wouldn’t have put it

606
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:25,590
somewhere so easy to spot.

607
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,430
Then where is it?

608
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,310
Someone’s coming.

609
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,520
How come she’s back so soon?

610
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,710
Did rats sneak in?

611
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,000
No wonder

612
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,920
there was a fire.

613
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:04,640
Some rats

614
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:07,280
set it to lure me out

615
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,710
so that they could steal things from me.

616
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,280
I always hate thieves.

617
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:17,230
When I was little,

618
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:20,430
a girl stole my hairpin.

619
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,230
Then I stabbed her eye

620
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,520
with it.

621
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,110
That way,

622
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,560
she could keep it forever.

623
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:38,920
Master,

624
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,760
where is The Color of Ocean and Heaven?

625
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,560
I don’t know what you’re talking about.

626
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:51,110
You’re evil-minded.

627
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:53,760
You’ve spent all your time on poison

628
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,070
instead of medicine.

629
00:33:56,070 --> 00:34:00,190
Now, you can only watch me die

630
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:03,000
and will never know where that thing is.

631
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,710
Take that as my last lesson to you.

632
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,800
I know who you are looking for.

633
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:34,710
You must be their escaped chief.

634
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:35,910
I’m their chief

635
00:34:35,910 --> 00:34:37,430
but I didn’t escape.

636
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,150
Listen,

637
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:41,040
I know where the people
you’re looking for are.

638
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:43,360
In the cabinet

639
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:46,800
which has been poisoned.

640
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,040
Don’t try to fool me.

641
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,800
They can’t go anywhere.

642
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,080
Enough!

643
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,150
Wait.

644
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,040
There’s poison

645
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:03,710
outside.

646
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,870
These are the antidote.

647
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:24,910
I made them.

648
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:25,910
They might not work,

649
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:26,710
but

650
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:28,950
we have nothing else.

651
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:30,390
Take this, too.

652
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:32,320
I made that powder.

653
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,950
Throw it into the fire,

654
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:35,520
then the smoke will blind others

655
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,230
and make their eyes tear.

656
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:38,150
I’ll have to deal with

657
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:39,560
that evil woman sooner or later.

658
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:43,080
Leave through the tunnel bonehead took

659
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,760
and bring the antidote to the Elders.

660
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,320
You won’t be able to

661
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,800
get out alive.

662
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,080
Really?

663
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,840
I’ll finish you here and now.

664
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:56,840
Bring it on!

665
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:03,280
I’d rather die

666
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,560
than relive that nightmare.

667
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:33,630
What?

668
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,070
Who are you?

669
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,320
The heir,

670
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:48,360
the sole heir to
the Big Medicine Valley!

671
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,230
Impossible!

672
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:57,080
You’re that boy?

673
00:36:57,970 --> 00:37:00,400
Ever since Master died of your poison,

674
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:03,340
I’ve been working
day and night to remove it.

675
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,710
You rat!

676
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:05,910
Hu Tianying,

677
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:06,760
you were

678
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,410
the most talented disciple.

679
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:10,670
Master meant to give you
Book of Almighty Medicine

680
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:12,430
and make you the next chief.

681
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:13,670
But what did you do?

682
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:15,190
You could only poison others

683
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:16,710
instead of curing them.

684
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:19,390
That’s why master changed his mind

685
00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:20,520
to keep the Big Medicine Valley

686
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:23,000
away from poison.

687
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,600
All these years,

688
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,520
I’ve been studying poison

689
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,600
to use it to save lives.

690
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,870
So I’m known as a physician.

691
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,760
Unlike you,

692
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:35,230
a despicable

693
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:37,910
poisoner all along!

694
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:39,390
Guards!

695
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,470
Guards!

696
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,430
Elder, you...

697
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:54,560
I’m fine.

698
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,320
She saved us.

699
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:01,760
Hongqu! Hongqu!

700
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:06,280
My lady,

701
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,390
their smoke

702
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:08,560
has blinded us.

703
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:17,840
Let’s go.

704
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:24,840
Are you alright?

705
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,190
Are you also poisoned?

706
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,630
Back then...

707
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:35,430
it was just like this.

708
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:37,040
I was in the cabinet

709
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:38,840
while she was outside.

710
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:42,210
I saw how she killed my master.

711
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,800
Finally,

712
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,020
I could

713
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:50,280
stand up to her.

714
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:55,640
You’re of great help.

715
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,350
Thanks.

716
00:38:58,630 --> 00:38:59,870
Back at the Fortress,

717
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:02,120
Uncle once said

718
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,520
those who attempt the impossible

719
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,040
are heroes.

720
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:09,000
Thank you.

721
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:15,870
Thank you both.

722
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,670
Take it back.

723
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:27,910
Don’t throw it away again.

724
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:29,190
Elder,

725
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,190
you should keep it.

726
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:32,560
I’m always away,

727
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,870
devoting myself to martial arts.

728
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:37,600
I’m not fitted to be the chief.

729
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,950
Weren’t you selecting a new one?

730
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:40,600
Choose a better one.

731
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,470
No.

732
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:43,190
We were wrong.

733
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,520
When the former chief

734
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:48,040
made a martial artist

735
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,840
instead of a physician his successor,

736
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,800
we thought he was partial towards you

737
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:54,470
and didn’t understand him.

738
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,760
But this incident

739
00:39:56,950 --> 00:39:59,280
has proved him right.

740
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:02,040
He picked you

741
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:05,120
to protect us

742
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,810
so that we wouldn’t end up
being like the Big Medicine Valley.

743
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:09,340
(Chestnut Shells)

744
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:12,710
Elder,

745
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:14,390
well...

746
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:16,600
about the Flaming Sage...

747
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:19,950
We didn’t give it to you.

748
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:23,000
The miasma is harmful.

749
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:25,390
Since you managed to get through it

750
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:26,320
and find that herb,

751
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,600
why bother asking me?

752
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:28,670
You can have it.

753
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,430
Really?

754
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:31,390
Thank you!

755
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:33,150
Let’s go see Fei.

756
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:34,320
I’ve got the herb she needs.

757
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,910
She can no longer call me useless.

758
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:36,840
Come on!

759
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,870
Thank you.

760
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,710
Let’s go.

761
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,470
I’ve warned Tianying

762
00:40:58,470 --> 00:41:00,870
not to underestimate those kids,

763
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:03,670
but she didn’t listen.

764
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:04,910
Yes.

765
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:06,320
News came in

766
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,710
that Zhou Fei is found near Lingling.

767
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:09,760
She seems to be

768
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,470
waiting for Phoenix, Mu Xiaoqiao.

769
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:15,120
That girl is really something.

770
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:18,230
Will Li Yan

771
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:21,000
get into trouble
at the Small Medicine Valley?

772
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,000
Hey, beauty,

773
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,630
you’re here early.

774
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,150
You’re late, Phoenix.

775
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:33,360
Where is it?

776
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,040
All yours.

777
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:41,080
Others would die

778
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,430
for this thing,

779
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:44,280
and you’re giving it to me so easily?

780
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,360
A promise is a promise.

781
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,670
I’ll certainly keep it.

782
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,390
I don’t need it anyway.

783
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:55,150
What are you going to do next?

784
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:57,520
I think Pathetic Clam has reappeared.

785
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,600
She could be the one

786
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,760
who poisoned Mr. Huo.

787
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:03,360
I’ll get to the bottom of it.

788
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,710
Pathetic Clam?

789
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:07,800
If there’s anything new about her,

790
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,120
let me know.

791
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:12,280
I won’t.

792
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,430
She’s my prey.

793
00:42:14,430 --> 00:42:15,870
No one else can take her away.

794
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:17,840
Fine.

795
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,040
I should go.

796
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,150
Good day.

797
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,560
She isn’t just your enemy.

798
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:30,870
If you can’t handle her alone,

799
00:42:30,870 --> 00:42:32,000
just say the word.

800
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:33,930
Don’t be shy.

801
00:43:09,230 --> 00:43:11,040
Hey, wait.

802
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:13,040
Is that Beggar’s Chicken?

803
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:15,910
Hey,

804
00:43:15,910 --> 00:43:17,000
you’re still too weak

805
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,670
to digest meat.

806
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:20,280
I’m healthy.

807
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:21,430
I’ll eat it for you.

808
00:43:21,430 --> 00:43:22,630
Consider that a favor.

809
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:23,710
Let me help you.

810
00:43:23,870 --> 00:43:24,910
No, no, no!

811
00:43:28,670 --> 00:43:30,630
Who knows how much I’ll suffer?

812
00:43:30,630 --> 00:43:32,000
I’m finally up

813
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,470
to eat something good.

814
00:43:33,470 --> 00:43:33,950
How could you take it from me?

815
00:43:33,950 --> 00:43:35,800
You get me wrong.

816
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:44,150
Alright. Fine.

817
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:45,190
Let’s share it.

818
00:43:46,950 --> 00:43:48,120
Hey,

819
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:50,080
I had my doubts
when you said you were a beggar.

820
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:50,910
So

821
00:43:50,910 --> 00:43:52,430
was that true?

822
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:54,670
Why would I lie?

823
00:43:54,670 --> 00:43:56,710
I’ve tried all walks of life.

824
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:58,520
I have to say

825
00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:00,280
being a beggar

826
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:01,800
is quite free.

827
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:07,360
Fei’s life is not bad, either.

828
00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:10,430
She dashes around all day

829
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,710
without worrying too much.

830
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:14,120
Listen,

831
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:15,280
just relax yourself

832
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:16,280
and stop thinking too much.

833
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:18,120
Finish this chicken,

834
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:19,390
and you’ll feel good.

835
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:21,190
Let’s eat it together.

836
00:44:22,670 --> 00:44:23,870
Come on.

837
00:44:27,190 --> 00:44:27,870
Eat it.

838
00:44:27,870 --> 00:44:28,710
Have a drumstick.

839
00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:29,600
Eat up.

840
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,280
Snake keeper,

841
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:38,390
we’ve obtained the Flaming Sage,

842
00:44:38,390 --> 00:44:40,390
helped bonehead get reinstated

843
00:44:40,390 --> 00:44:41,760
and beat back Pathetic Clam.

844
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,120
Aren’t we good?

845
00:44:43,870 --> 00:44:44,630
Yes.

846
00:44:49,710 --> 00:44:51,080
I’ve decided to stay at
the Small Medicine Valley.

847
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:02,910
How long will it take to
get to the Small Medicine Valley?
