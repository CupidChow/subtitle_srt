17
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,380
Found it!

18
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:57,910
It’s planted there on purpose,

19
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:58,950
but I can’t move it.

20
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,630
There must be something else.

21
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:01,990
I believe

22
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:03,380
the plant here

23
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:05,630
is the “Catalpa branch” in the poem.

24
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,550
Could it

25
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:09,630
be the water?

26
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:10,460
Water?

27
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:11,830
Check it out.

28
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:41,190
Let me try again.

29
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:45,220
It’s moving!

30
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,020
Lu Tiankuang,

31
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,350
Lord Shen assigned you

32
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:04,940
to assist me.

33
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:07,100
Don’t cross the line.

34
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:18,460
Fine.

35
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,020
By “assist you”,

36
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,910
he means he doesn’t trust you.

37
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:34,150
I don’t trust you.

38
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,430
So?

39
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:42,710
Aren’t you always eager to battle me?

40
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:44,550
Wait until

41
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:46,740
we find the treasure.

42
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:48,020
Bring it on.

43
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,150
Report!

44
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:54,740
Lord, we found a village ahead.

45
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,100
Bad news!

46
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,030
A bunch of...

47
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:20,900
A bunch of martial artists are outside.

48
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:21,940
How did they get in?

49
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,150
What’s happening?

50
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:24,550
Why are they here?

51
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:25,620
No idea.

52
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,340
They look scary.

53
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:28,990
Guard our village!

54
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:30,620
-Let’s go!
-Gear up!

55
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:34,100
-Let’s go!
-Go, go, go!

56
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,380
Come on. Let’s go.

57
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:38,310
Let’s go!

58
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:54,220
Calm down.

59
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:57,100
I’m Gu Tianxian,

60
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,100
also known as Giant Leopard.

61
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,430
He... he’s a Demon!

62
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:03,180
Demon?

63
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,030
I thought no one could recognize me

64
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:07,620
in this remote village.

65
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,620
Now that you do,

66
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:11,470
you’ve spared me the trouble.

67
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:12,780
What... what do you want?

68
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:13,900
We’re farmers.

69
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,340
We... we have no money.

70
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:17,030
-Yes.
-We don’t have anything.

71
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:19,380
I need nothing from you,

72
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:22,030
only some information.

73
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,310
Are you aware of
The Color of Ocean and Heaven?

74
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:25,940
Why bother asking them?

75
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,060
Just seize them all.

76
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:30,830
What is this?

77
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,180
What to do?

78
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:08,990
Lord Shen,

79
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:10,060
I was told

80
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,220
that Lord Gu and Lord Lu

81
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,060
had located the entrance of
the Big Medicine Valley.

82
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,270
Very well.

83
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:20,830
Let’s go join them.

84
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:21,990
Yes.

85
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:34,870
Mr. Xie,

86
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:36,470
I’m here waiting for you

87
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:37,780
under the Third Prince’s order.

88
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:38,830
Zichen?

89
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:39,430
What’s up?

90
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:40,270
It’s important.

91
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:42,030
Can we talk somewhere else?

92
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:52,990
This is His Highness’s letter to you.

93
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:00,420
(Gathering troops...)

94
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:05,180
What’s wrong?

95
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:08,620
Zichen said

96
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:11,500
enemies have gathered
troops at the border.

97
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,550
Their intention is unknown yet.

98
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:17,750
But once they launch attacks,

99
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,590
chaos will arise.

100
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:22,550
So he needs my advice.

101
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:28,310
Forget that.

102
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:29,620
I can’t leave now.

103
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,990
Go ahead.

104
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:34,870
He needs your help

105
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,750
or he wouldn’t have asked you.

106
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:39,590
Anyway, it’ll take us a while

107
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:41,780
to find the entrance to
the Big Medicine Valley.

108
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:43,900
Just go.

109
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,100
Fine.

110
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,100
I’ll make it quick.

111
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:52,870
Take care of yourself.

112
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:56,620
See you soon.

113
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,470
Yes!

114
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:02,060
Please, Mr. Xie.

115
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,870
Lord Gantang,

116
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:14,780
how’s your wife?

117
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:18,870
Thanks for your help,

118
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,550
Jinrong is still

119
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:23,590
in a coma

120
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:25,590
because of the residual poison,

121
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:27,310
but

122
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:29,470
her pulse has become steadier.

123
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:35,670
If you’re worried about the Fortress

124
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:39,110
and can’t wait to go back,

125
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:42,670
we can take care of her.

126
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:45,590
No need.

127
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:47,940
I’ve asked those kids

128
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:50,470
to handle things at home.

129
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:52,470
Aren’t you concerned?

130
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:55,420
It’s their responsibility after all.

131
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:59,740
They can’t avoid it.

132
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:03,910
I admire you for knowing to let go.

133
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:06,860
And...

134
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,540
what about the Anping Army?

135
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:12,740
It’s also fine.

136
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:16,030
Then why are you frowning?

137
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:23,150
If we don’t sacrifice ourselves
to save others, who will?

138
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:30,670
Thank you for enlightening me.

139
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:46,380
Stop.

140
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:47,300
Stop.

141
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,300
Is everything alright, sir?

142
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,060
What was that noise?

143
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,790
This area is a war zone.

144
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:01,380
Such noise is common.

145
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:04,860
By the way,

146
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,670
is General Wen Yu stationed nearby?

147
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:07,470
Yes.

148
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:09,630
After the Demons raided Huxiang,

149
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,470
General Wen

150
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:13,620
has been battling enemies in this area.

151
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:16,110
Cities have changed hands repeatedly.

152
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:18,180
I see.

153
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,620
I need to see him.

154
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,910
Let’s visit him first.

155
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:22,740
Sir,

156
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,620
considering the situation here,

157
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,300
His Highness asked us specifically
not to hang around.

158
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,470
So

159
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:28,860
would you rather let me go there alone

160
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:29,860
or sneak out

161
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,270
when you aren’t looking?

162
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:32,620
I’m sorry.

163
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:34,830
Alright. Let’s go.

164
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:37,670
Let’s go.

165
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,110
Heard something over there.

166
00:10:58,740 --> 00:10:59,830
Me too.

167
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:08,350
It’s a boy.

168
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:10,380
Fei, put away your blade

169
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:11,740
or he’ll be scared.

170
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:16,420
Sweetie,

171
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:17,790
come here.

172
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:19,620
Careful. Don’t get hurt.

173
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:20,670
Come.

174
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:26,830
Their wounds

175
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:27,830
are still fresh.

176
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:29,060
Sword wounds.

177
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:31,710
The victims seemed to be farmers.

178
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:34,110
They might be villagers in
the Big Medicine Valley.

179
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:37,030
Who would kill them?

180
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:40,500
This is the south of the state.

181
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,350
Does the court have no control here?

182
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:44,620
It’s close to the frontline
where the war never ceases.

183
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,270
Anyone can occupy this place.

184
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:48,180
Locals have suffered a lot.

185
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,710
This is strange, though.

186
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,110
Stop!

187
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:13,940
Sweetie,

188
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:15,180
where are you going?

189
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,670
I’m going home.

190
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,590
Going home?

191
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,910
If he lives in the Big Medicine Valley

192
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:23,790
and tries to go back,

193
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:24,830
he may

194
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:27,030
lead us there.

195
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:29,620
Off you go.

196
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,540
General, His Majesty has arrived.

197
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:53,590
-General Wen.
-Your Majesty.

198
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,380
Skip the formality.

199
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:58,910
You may leave.

200
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:00,350
Give us a minute.

201
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:01,470
Yes.

202
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:07,940
General Wen,

203
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:09,380
You must’ve learned about

204
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:11,230
Lord Gantang’s situation.

205
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:15,470
He had asked me to get prepared

206
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:16,980
before his departure.

207
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:19,500
I’ve also heard about

208
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,420
your condition.

209
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:24,180
Do take care of yourself.

210
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:27,350
Thanks to Fei,

211
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:30,180
I’ve taken three herbs
to suppress the poison.

212
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,150
I’m fine for now.

213
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:34,420
She’s done so much

214
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:36,230
for you.

215
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:39,110
That’s all the more reason
to look after yourself.

216
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:41,350
I wonder

217
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:43,500
how Lord Gantang is.

218
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:48,110
He’s left the Fortress

219
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:50,030
for some reason.

220
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:55,540
Everything will be fine.

221
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:57,860
I can manage things here.

222
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,670
Don’t worry.

223
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,110
Your Majesty,

224
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:03,670
do you

225
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:05,790
have any future plans?

226
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:10,060
That’s

227
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,830
what I’m here for.

228
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:15,110
I’m all ears.

229
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,910
Aside from your stance,

230
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:20,590
how is the state overall

231
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:23,350
during the reign of the Chens?

232
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:26,150
I’m only a soldier.

233
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:28,670
It’s not my place to judge.

234
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:31,300
Relax, General Wen.

235
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,500
It’s just small talk.

236
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:38,740
Take this area as an example.

237
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,470
It’s relatively peaceful

238
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:42,350
despite occasional conflicts.

239
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:44,270
Locals have roofs over their heads.

240
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:49,180
I once said to Fei

241
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,590
all sects will end eventually.

242
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:52,910
So will

243
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:54,710
dynasties.

244
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:57,710
New ones are built

245
00:14:57,710 --> 00:15:00,230
at the cost of innocent lives.

246
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:01,910
At this point,

247
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:03,830
are we going to inflict

248
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:05,790
such suffering on the masses again?

249
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,350
If you ask me,

250
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:14,110
like I said,

251
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:16,350
people come first,

252
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:18,030
followed by the state

253
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:19,830
and the one ruling it.

254
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:23,860
If I could

255
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:26,110
bring peace to people,

256
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:29,910
I’d die

257
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:31,500
with no regrets.

258
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:35,380
Your Majesty,

259
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:38,670
back then,

260
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,060
I chose to join this army

261
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:42,710
for returning a favor

262
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:44,270
and for friendship.

263
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:46,420
Your ambition has made me realized

264
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:49,830
what I should do in the future.

265
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,710
Your Majesty, General Wen.

266
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:56,540
What’s up?

267
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,860
We’ve spotted Yu Wenzhi’s troops here.

268
00:15:58,860 --> 00:15:59,830
How many are they?

269
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:00,980
Only a few.

270
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:03,980
But what brings them here is unclear.

271
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,710
General Wen,

272
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:08,740
when was the last time you battled him?

273
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:13,060
15 days ago.

274
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,470
About two weeks.

275
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,710
And nothing happened

276
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,500
since then?

277
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,620
No.

278
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:22,380
I also

279
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:24,470
find that odd.

280
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:28,940
I was a commander years back,

281
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:30,380
but you’ve gained more experience

282
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:33,300
through battles with General Wang.

283
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:36,830
I dare not to jump to conclusions.

284
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:37,710
Your Majesty,

285
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:40,910
you’d better leave with the Chens.

286
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:42,180
It’s too dangerous here.

287
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:44,420
I don’t want to get you in danger.

288
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:51,180
The terrain here is complex.

289
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:55,060
Why don’t you dispatch scouts

290
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:57,230
to check again
within a 10-kilometer radius

291
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:00,980
in case Yu Wenzhi is
plotting against us?

292
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:03,300
Go ahead.

293
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,590
Yes.

294
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:11,020
They must be

295
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,230
up to something.

296
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:44,420
What’s wrong?

297
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:09,750
He must’ve

298
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,540
learned how to do all that

299
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:13,020
from his parents.

300
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,390
The rocks

301
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:16,110
may be the keys.

302
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:19,750
Push that.

303
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:20,780
What?

304
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:21,180
What did you say?

305
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,870
Push that.

306
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:33,750
It’s open!

307
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:35,140
It’s open!

308
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:38,660
Fei,

309
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:40,660
what are you doing?

310
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,110
Leaving a sign for Xie Yun.

311
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:47,140
Let’s go.

312
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:18,260
So many people

313
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:20,060
are living here.

314
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,060
Watch out for the Demons!

315
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,060
Lock men and women separately.

316
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,140
Move!

317
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:27,020
What are you looking at? Go!

318
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:29,350
This place is filled with
the Demons and troops.

319
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:31,060
The Demons here are even more

320
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,470
than those sent to the Fortress.

321
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:33,990
-Looks like they’re
-Go!

322
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:35,420
gathering the villagers together.

323
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:36,300
Move!

324
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,110
Hey, you, stop dawdling!

325
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:40,940
Fei, could we be wrong?

326
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:43,420
This place doesn’t look like a vault.

327
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:44,420
Open your eyes!

328
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,660
It must be important,

329
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,110
or the Demons wouldn’t be here.

330
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:49,470
Follow them

331
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:51,020
and see how things go.

332
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:08,060
Go! Hurry up!

333
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:10,420
-Keep up!
-Move!

334
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:11,780
Go!

335
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:15,590
-Go!
-Go inside!

336
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:16,710
Hurry!

337
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:19,260
They’ve caged so many people.

338
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:22,140
Women and kids are locked up separately

339
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:22,830
as hostages

340
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:24,470
to better control men.

341
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:28,260
Lords,

342
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:28,940
villagers of the Big Medicine Valley

343
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:31,060
are kept in the caves in this area.

344
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:32,710
Have our grains been put away?

345
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:34,470
Yes. They’re safe.

346
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:39,870
What do you

347
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:41,470
need those villagers for?

348
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:43,180
I don’t need to

349
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:44,780
explain it to you.

350
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:47,180
Do you think

351
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,780
you can handle them alone?

352
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,630
Let’s see.

353
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:52,020
Vulgar!

354
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:54,590
You think you’re better than me?

355
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:57,750
You and your sister

356
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,140
have brought shame

357
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:01,590
on Demons Manor.

358
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:05,660
Excuse me?

359
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:09,420
What do you mean?

360
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:15,590
Your sister hooked up
with Yu Wenzhi in secret.

361
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:17,750
Who knows how much

362
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,940
dirty business you two have done

363
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:22,060
behind Lord Shen’s back.

364
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:23,420
Nonsense!

365
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:25,180
All that she did

366
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:27,110
was for Demons Manor,

367
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:29,900
or she wouldn’t have
been killed by Zhou Fei!

368
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:33,260
Our loyalty is unquestionable.

369
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:43,140
Have you found the entrance
to The Color of Ocean and Heaven?

370
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,110
Not yet, Lord Gu.

371
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:45,900
Our men have been looking for it.

372
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:46,660
Hurry up.

373
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:47,420
Yes.

374
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:49,020
Follow me.

375
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:53,140
Both Lu Tiankuang

376
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:55,020
and Gu Tianxian are here.

377
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:57,140
They haven’t found the entrance yet.

378
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:58,780
I’m afraid

379
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,300
they’ve caged the villagers to...

380
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:02,230
Do you mean

381
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:04,630
they’re using them

382
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:06,260
to find the treasure?

383
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:08,020
Those Demons

384
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:10,540
will do anything for it.

385
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:23,470
-Spare us!
-Spare us!

386
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:24,780
Hey, you!

387
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:25,630
Brother!

388
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:27,110
Where’s The Color of Ocean and Heaven?

389
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:28,260
-I don’t know.
-Don’t kill me, please!

390
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,230
Speak!

391
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:31,710
Spare me, please.

392
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:33,750
Listen up.

393
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:36,590
Tell us where
The Color of Ocean and Heaven is,

394
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:38,340
or all of you will be dead.

395
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:50,780
We’re outnumbered.

396
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:51,470
Let’s go.

397
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:52,990
Sheng!

398
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:54,830
I’ll hold him and walk behind you.

399
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:56,940
We can’t leave them there.

400
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:58,870
Yan,

401
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:00,300
there’s only a few of us.

402
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:02,140
We aren’t their match.

403
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,350
And

404
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:05,350
don’t forget about our mission.

405
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:09,230
We need help

406
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:10,780
to get them out.

407
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:12,750
Are you saying...?

408
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:14,180
Ask General Wen Yu for help.

409
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:17,230
I heard he and his troops are nearby.

410
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:20,060
Send him a message

411
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:21,710
and ask him to come over.

412
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:23,420
Then we can continue the search.

413
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:24,390
How long

414
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:25,990
will that take?

415
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:26,900
By the time we’re back,

416
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,870
all those villagers are already dead.

417
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:32,300
Fei,

418
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:34,350
say something!

419
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:39,780
Back then,

420
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:42,300
when my skills were poor,

421
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:45,510
I dared to challenge Dragon Master.

422
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:48,180
Now, they’re much better,

423
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:50,380
but I feel as if they tied me up.

424
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:53,990
Everyone has burdens.

425
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:55,750
Even if people aren’t afraid of death,

426
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:58,780
there are things more important than it.

427
00:23:58,780 --> 00:23:59,750
Should I

428
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:01,940
stick my neck out for strangers?

429
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:03,470
Fei,

430
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:05,870
what’s on your mind? Fei!

431
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:09,750
Are we...

432
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:12,540
giving them up?

433
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:13,780
Not exactly.

434
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:15,590
But we need a plan.

435
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:20,900
Tell me

436
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:23,110
where The Color of Ocean and Heaven is

437
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:24,630
if you want to live.

438
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:26,110
Otherwise,

439
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:27,060
I’ll take one of you

440
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:29,020
every hour

441
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:32,870
until you cough up the answer.

442
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:38,110
Li Sheng,

443
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:39,630
you’re hesitating

444
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:41,750
because you don’t want to
take risks or feel guilty.

445
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:42,900
I have no choice.

446
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,510
Do you have better ideas?

447
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:47,630
No.

448
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:48,590
Zhou Fei,

449
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:49,990
just say the word.

450
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:52,350
I need to find
The Color of Ocean and Heaven,

451
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:55,260
the cure to Bone-chilling

452
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,590
and go back to the Fortress.

453
00:24:57,990 --> 00:24:59,260
But none of them

454
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:01,060
sounds justified.

455
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:02,470
They’re important

456
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:04,420
to me,

457
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,140
but once I say them out loud...

458
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:07,870
Chuchu, let’s go.

459
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:11,230
-Fei.
-Get up.

460
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:12,260
Fei,

461
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,390
come on!

462
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:14,900
Sheng,

463
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:17,750
if we left like this,

464
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:19,830
once we got back,

465
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:21,750
would you dare to tell my mother

466
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:24,180
that we left those people to die?

467
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:25,830
Yes, Sheng.

468
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:29,780
Fei,

469
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:34,350
two Demons and their lackeys are there.

470
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:35,940
If you acted recklessly

471
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,990
and got killed,

472
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:39,260
what would happen to Mr. Xie?

473
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:41,710
Who’d save him?

474
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,660
What about the others?

475
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:46,540
And your mother and father.

476
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:48,710
Would you rather
break their hearts again?

477
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,870
I believe my parents

478
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:53,750
and Xie Yun

479
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,710
will understand.

480
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,060
Fortress of the Forty-Eight

481
00:25:58,060 --> 00:25:59,660
doesn’t raise cowards.

482
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:01,260
If we back down,

483
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:04,470
they’ll be more disappointed.

484
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:05,390
Zhou Fei,

485
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:06,750
although we’ve battled more than once,

486
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:08,510
I support you this time.

487
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:10,590
Are we going to rescue them now?

488
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:13,110
Sheng,

489
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:14,940
I agree with them.

490
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:15,710
That’s great.

491
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:17,060
Let’s go.

492
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:20,260
Fine.

493
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:21,940
We need a strategy

494
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:23,420
to get them out

495
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:24,590
successfully.

496
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:28,350
That’s the best we can do at the moment.

497
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:30,350
One more thing.

498
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:31,390
We need someone

499
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:32,830
to send a message to General Wen.

500
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:34,300
Who will do it?

501
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:38,630
I won’t.

502
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:39,470
Sheng,

503
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:40,470
let me stay

504
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:42,140
and help you.

505
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,350
I have an idea.

506
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:45,350
What is it?

507
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:46,830
What idea?

508
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:47,900
Close your eyes.

509
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,510
-Why?
-What for?

510
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:50,990
Do it.

511
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:03,870
Alright.

512
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:09,590
Draw a stick.

513
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:11,630
What is this?

514
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,510
We’re taught to respect all beings.

515
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:14,390
Every year during festivals,

516
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:16,140
we’ll have our fortune told.

517
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:18,390
I don’t get how the rituals work,

518
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:20,870
but basically, we follow heaven’s will.

519
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:22,060
Let’s each draw a stick.

520
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:24,180
Whoever gets the longest one
will be the messenger.

521
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,540
Deal?

522
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:27,300
Are you insane?

523
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,300
If it’s us, who will fight the enemies?

524
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:34,060
Never mind.

525
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:35,830
There are no other ways.

526
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:44,350
Not me.

527
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:46,940
Not me, either.

528
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,260
Not me.

529
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:53,780
It’s me.

530
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:01,020
Chuchu,

531
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,900
I know you’re worried about us,

532
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:05,060
but sending the message
is equally important.

533
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,110
Without General Wen,

534
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:06,940
we won’t be able to

535
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:08,470
get out on our own.

536
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:12,870
I see.

537
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:14,540
I’ll go.

538
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:19,260
The Demons outside are many.

539
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:20,590
Be very careful.

540
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:23,470
Chuchu, come here.

541
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:30,420
Chuchu,

542
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:31,420
do you know where our nearest

543
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:32,940
secret service is?

544
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:34,990
I do.

545
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:36,660
I paid attention to that

546
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:37,750
when you checked them.

547
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:38,390
But

548
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:39,990
I need to see General Wen first.

549
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:44,470
You may have to enter the war zone.

550
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:46,900
How are you going to find him?

551
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:50,180
He’s traveling with a large troop.

552
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:51,660
They must’ve left tracks along the way.

553
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:53,420
They can be my guide.

554
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:56,660
No.

555
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:58,260
That’s too dangerous.

556
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:04,260
Relax. I hate to leave, too,

557
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:06,300
but I must

558
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,350
send the message to him

559
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:09,110
for the safety of the villagers.

560
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:10,590
Everything will be fine.

561
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:29,630
This soft armor,

562
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:31,180
made by the one

563
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:32,830
who crafted Mrs. Yin’s Muyun Gauze,

564
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:34,780
is impenetrable,

565
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:35,780
but

566
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:38,780
not able to withstand strong force.

567
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:40,350
Don’t battle those

568
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:42,060
with powerful palms head-on.

569
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,750
Just run as fast as you can.

570
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:44,900
I see.

571
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:47,140
This is another gadget he made.

572
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:48,510
I’ve never used it before.

573
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:50,830
It’s said to be a hidden weapon

574
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:53,660
to protect you in danger.

575
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:54,710
If the target is within 10 meters,

576
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:56,020
stay calm

577
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:57,060
and shoot.

578
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:58,140
Even Yang Jin

579
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:00,630
and Li Sheng can’t dodge the hit.

580
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:03,140
Got it.

581
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,630
Take these, too, if you can.

582
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:07,900
What are they?

583
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:10,750
Snake poison

584
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:12,060
and knockout drops our people made.

585
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:12,750
I’m not sure which is which,

586
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:14,420
but they’re all here.

587
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:15,230
Come on!

588
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,510
Can you be more irresponsible?

589
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:17,900
Still, they’re better than nothing.

590
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:18,830
I’ll take them.

591
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:21,870
Be careful.

592
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:26,540
This boy will go with me.

593
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:28,420
It’s dangerous for him to be here.

594
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:29,990
Let’s go.

595
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:30,990
Come on.

596
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:37,230
Take care.

597
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:48,510
Sheng,

598
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:50,180
you should go back.

599
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:52,350
Take care.

600
00:30:57,630 --> 00:30:59,470
Keep this

601
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:01,230
and take care as well.

602
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:37,590
What?

603
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:38,300
You’ll take both of them?

604
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,830
Lower your voice.

605
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,390
Yes.

606
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:42,780
Or will you do it?

607
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:45,020
Who is it

608
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:46,510
to battle two enemies?

609
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:48,510
Sheng,

610
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:49,590
here’s what I think.

611
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:50,900
I can propose a challenge

612
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:53,180
to battle Gu Tianxian and Lu Tiankuang.

613
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,020
Perhaps they’ll

614
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:58,060
follow the rules
and take up the challenge.

615
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:59,540
That’ll buy you some time

616
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:00,870
to get the villagers out.

617
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:01,830
Rules?

618
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:03,390
Would those animals care about rules?

619
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:04,350
What if they come at you together?

620
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:05,300
What will you do?

621
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:07,390
I’m not stupid.

622
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:09,140
They aren’t exactly friends.

623
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:10,350
I’ll stall them

624
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:11,660
for a while.

625
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:13,180
I’ve got these.

626
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:17,540
What are they?

627
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:20,020
Our pharmacists made these, too.

628
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,870
Drop them on the ground,

629
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:23,230
and they’ll produce smoke

630
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:24,630
enough to paralyze others.

631
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:26,110
Then we can get in

632
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,390
to rescue the hostages.

633
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:30,180
I’ve brought whistling arrows with me.

634
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:32,140
Seeing sparks they create,

635
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:34,900
they may think
we’re setting the valley on fire.

636
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,660
That’ll be our chance to escape.

637
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:38,110
What about those women and kids?

638
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:40,470
They should be kept nearby.

639
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:43,350
I... I’ll get them out.

640
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:44,230
Yan,

641
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:45,540
are your three moves

642
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:46,630
enough to do that?

643
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:47,830
Sheng said

644
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:49,870
they’re loosely guarded.

645
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:50,830
And

646
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:52,350
I’ve mastered more than three moves.

647
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:55,110
Those Demons aren’t my match.

648
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:56,180
-Yan,
-Alright.

649
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:58,300
take them all.

650
00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:00,420
Be very careful.

651
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:01,750
Once Li Sheng and I are done,

652
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:02,900
we’ll join you.

653
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:03,900
I see.

654
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:04,750
Remember,

655
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:05,780
if things look bad,

656
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:06,590
just run away.

657
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:07,350
Stay away from danger.

658
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:08,510
Safety matters the most.

659
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:17,060
Let’s go.

660
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:28,390
Lords,

661
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:29,300
the heiress to the South Blade,
Zhou Fei,

662
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,940
is here to challenge you.

663
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:31,590
The South Blade?

664
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:32,540
What?

665
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:34,020
Why is she here?

666
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:37,230
How many are they?

667
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:38,420
Just her alone.

668
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:43,630
That girl

669
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:45,510
is a cunning fox.

670
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:48,180
There must be a trap.

671
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,830
It’s just a girl.

672
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:52,710
Don’t be paranoid.

673
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:55,870
Now that she’s here,

674
00:33:55,870 --> 00:33:58,710
I’ll avenge my sister’s death on her.

675
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:02,830
Let’s go.

676
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:04,020
Lu Tiankuang!

677
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:13,060
Tell the guards to stay alert.

678
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:14,500
Let me know

679
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,740
if anyone breaks in.

680
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:16,700
Yes.

681
00:34:54,430 --> 00:34:55,150
Let’s go.

682
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:58,430
Who are you?

683
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:01,740
Anping Army.

684
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,500
Do you serve under General Wen Yu?

685
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,740
Who exactly are you?

686
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:07,260
How do you know our general?

687
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:10,390
They must be General Wen’s men.

688
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:11,950
I’m with the Fortress
of the Forty-Eight.

689
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:13,590
I have a message for General Wen

690
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:15,260
and I need to see him.

691
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:21,980
It’s urgent.

692
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:23,220
Please trust me.

693
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:36,060
Zhou Fei,

694
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:38,020
I’m here.

695
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:43,540
It’s been a while,

696
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:44,630
Lord Lu.

697
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:45,910
I’m

698
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:47,980
going to kill you

699
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,590
to avenge my sister’s death.

700
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:09,060
Brace up!

701
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:09,980
Check carefully!

702
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:10,740
Yes.

703
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:49,350
Report! Report!

704
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:51,190
Lord Gu,

705
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:52,220
the cave is under attack.

706
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:53,950
They’re trying to rescue villagers.

707
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:58,390
How many are they?

708
00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:00,060
Not too many.

709
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:02,430
Only two or three.

710
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:03,670
But they’re highly skilled.

711
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:06,020
That’s a distraction.

712
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:13,590
Let us out!

713
00:37:14,350 --> 00:37:16,390
Move! Get in!

714
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:18,870
Hurry!

715
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:20,780
Bonehead is right.

716
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:23,150
Women and kids are kept in the back.

717
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:27,350
Let us out! Let us out!

718
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:29,220
Please let us go.

719
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:36,260
Step back! Step back!

720
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:37,300
Be quiet!

721
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:52,870
Calm down. I’m here to get you out.

722
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:57,060
How did you sneak out?

723
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:58,540
I...

724
00:37:58,540 --> 00:37:59,630
Get in.

725
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:03,110
Stay inside,

726
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:04,950
or I’ll break your legs.

727
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:13,110
What are you doing here?

728
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:14,910
Zhou Fei’s sudden appearance

729
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:16,980
and sneak attack on the cave

730
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:18,870
are clearly distractions.

731
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:20,260
Don’t lecture me.

732
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:27,590
What are Li Sheng

733
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:28,980
and Yang Jin doing?

734
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:31,350
What’s taking them so long?

735
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:58,670
Oh, no!

736
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:00,830
Yu Wenzhi’s troops are here.

737
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:13,950
Go!

738
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:15,390
We’re here to help you.

739
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:16,780
It’s them!

740
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:17,700
Seize them!

741
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:19,110
What to do? We’re doomed.

742
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:20,460
I’ll stall them for you.

743
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:29,060
A stranger

744
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:30,740
is risking his life for you.

745
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:32,430
How could you give up?

746
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:33,830
Even if you don’t care about your lives,

747
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:35,460
think about your parents

748
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:36,430
and wives.

749
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:37,670
Your boys are little.

750
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:39,390
Do you want to see them die?

751
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:41,390
He’s right.

752
00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:42,500
We can’t give up.

753
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,110
Yes. We still have a chance to live.

754
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:45,110
We can’t die.

755
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:46,060
Don’t be scared.

756
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:47,390
I’m here to get you out.

757
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:49,260
Trust me.

758
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:51,020
There will be a mess outside.

759
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:54,260
Carry the seniors and kids.

760
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:55,870
We can get out.

761
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:57,780
It’s bad.

762
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:59,220
There are so many of them,

763
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:01,020
including seniors.

764
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:07,430
Snake keeper!

765
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:13,740
I’ve killed them all.

766
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:14,300
Let’s go.

767
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:16,060
Okay. Let’s go.

768
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:18,830
I won’t leave without my elder sister.

769
00:40:18,830 --> 00:40:19,700
Where is she?

770
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:20,740
She’s locked up in the northwest cave

771
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:22,190
by those bad people.

772
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:22,910
Lead the way.

773
00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:24,630
We’ll get her out.

774
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:25,780
-Thanks.
-Let’s go.

775
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:27,870
Let’s go.

776
00:40:27,870 --> 00:40:30,910
Go, go, go.

777
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:32,060
Let’s go.

778
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:36,150
(Animal characters made by CG)

779
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:37,670
Snakes! Snakes!

780
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:41,820
(Animal characters made by CG)

781
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:43,060
Let’s go. Come on.

782
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:47,700
(Animal characters made by CG)

783
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:48,950
Why are there snakes?

784
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:50,460
Let’s go!

785
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:52,390
(Animal characters made by CG)
Sheng! Yang Jin!

786
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:53,460
We’re here!

787
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:54,460
Great.

788
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:56,350
Yan, are you alright?

789
00:40:56,350 --> 00:40:57,740
Open it, Yang Jin.

790
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:03,830
This “snake girl” helped us.

791
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:07,300
Ying Hecong!

792
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:09,260
What... what are you doing here?

793
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:10,500
I said I’d go back to
the Big Medicine Valley.

794
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:11,540
Didn’t you listen?

795
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:13,110
Once I arrived,

796
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:14,980
the Demons were
holding villagers hostage.

797
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:16,700
Hadn’t I dressed up like this,

798
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:17,670
how could I’ve saved them?

799
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:18,390
Fine, fine, fine.

800
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:19,390
Let’s go.

801
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:20,670
My snakes can only hold the Demons

802
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:22,670
for a while.

803
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:23,870
This powder will keep snakes away.

804
00:41:23,870 --> 00:41:25,060
Let’s line up

805
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:26,190
and keep the snakes on one side.

806
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:26,980
Be careful.

807
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:28,190
(Animal characters made by CG)
Watch it.

808
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:29,300
Be careful. Mind your step.

809
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:30,220
Go.

810
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:31,630
Watch out for the snakes.

811
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:35,460
-Let’s go. Come on.
-Slow down, Father.

812
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:36,950
Be careful.

813
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:39,260
Come on.

814
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:44,300
Let’s go.

815
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:45,460
Where are you going?

816
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:46,540
You are...

817
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:47,300
Don’t be scared.

818
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:48,060
I won’t harm you.

819
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:49,590
We were locked up by the Demons

820
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:51,460
and two young men got us out.

821
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:54,220
We’re leaving this place.

822
00:41:58,300 --> 00:41:59,980
Two young men?

823
00:42:09,950 --> 00:42:10,870
You almost killed me.

824
00:42:10,870 --> 00:42:11,950
Are you blind?

825
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:13,060
Stay out of the way!

826
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:16,110
Dog-eat-dog.

827
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:33,500
Did the Demons and Yu Wenzhi’s men

828
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:34,880
store up grains here?

829
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:38,500
If they’re on fire,
that’ll mess things up

830
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:39,980
and buy villagers
more time to leave.

831
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:01,110
Why is it all sand under the rice?

832
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:02,740
How come the door is open?

833
00:43:07,590 --> 00:43:09,870
Someone must’ve laid eyes on the barn.

834
00:43:09,870 --> 00:43:11,830
Let’s go check.

835
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:17,300
This isn’t the real barn.

836
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:27,100
(Animal characters made by CG)

837
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:31,780
It’s her!

838
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:32,860
(Animal characters made by CG)

839
00:43:34,630 --> 00:43:35,670
Go on.

840
00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:36,630
Where do you think you’re going?

841
00:43:36,630 --> 00:43:38,110
Aren’t you a runner?

842
00:43:47,630 --> 00:43:49,350
Where are Ying Hecong and Li Yan?

843
00:43:49,350 --> 00:43:50,110
I’ll go find them.

844
00:43:50,110 --> 00:43:50,980
No need.

845
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:51,950
They’ll be fine

846
00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:52,910
with the help

847
00:43:52,910 --> 00:43:54,220
of the snakes.

848
00:43:55,830 --> 00:43:57,500
I’m sorry to trouble you again,

849
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:59,980
but my uncle is still
in the northeast cave.

850
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:02,630
Could you... could you get him out, too?

851
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:04,700
There must be an ambush in the back.

852
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:05,830
They wouldn’t put all eggs
in one basket.

853
00:44:05,830 --> 00:44:08,150
Their grains and supplies

854
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:09,220
must be stored there.

855
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:11,060
Let’s go and see what we can do.

856
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:12,220
Maybe we can make some noise there

857
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:14,060
to help Fei out.

858
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:15,540
Yes. We can help you.

859
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:16,910
-Let us help you.
-We’ll join you.

860
00:44:16,910 --> 00:44:17,430
-This way.
-Take us with you.

861
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:18,830
General,

862
00:44:18,830 --> 00:44:20,980
you have a visitor from
the Fortress of the Forty-Eight

863
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:22,780
who asks to see you urgently.

864
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:23,830
Who is it?

865
00:44:23,830 --> 00:44:25,060
It’s a girl.

866
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:26,950
Let her in.

867
00:44:26,950 --> 00:44:27,910
Yes.

868
00:44:29,830 --> 00:44:30,390
Miss,

869
00:44:30,390 --> 00:44:31,670
please.

870
00:44:32,150 --> 00:44:33,300
General Wen.

871
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:34,630
Miss Wu!

872
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:39,260
Miss Wu?

873
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:40,500
What are you doing

874
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:41,780
in this middle of nowhere?

875
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:43,460
By the way,

876
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:44,630
where’s Miss Zhou and the others?

877
00:44:44,630 --> 00:44:45,500
Is everything alright?

878
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:46,540
We have an emergency.

879
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:49,150
Could you send troops to help them?

880
00:44:49,150 --> 00:44:50,190
What’s wrong?

881
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:51,980
We entered a valley,

882
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:53,060
but found people there

883
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:55,430
locked up by the Demons and Yu Wenzhi.

884
00:44:55,430 --> 00:44:57,590
We meant to rescue them

885
00:44:57,590 --> 00:44:59,630
but we were outnumbered.

886
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:01,780
Please give us a hand.

887
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:02,910
It’s too risky

888
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:03,740
for you guys

889
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:06,110
to rescue them

890
00:45:06,390 --> 00:45:07,630
from Yu Wenzhi’s men.

891
00:45:08,430 --> 00:45:09,350
Guard!

892
00:45:09,350 --> 00:45:11,150
-Yes.
-Gather our crack troops

893
00:45:11,150 --> 00:45:12,430
and set out with Miss Wu.

894
00:45:12,430 --> 00:45:13,350
Yes.

895
00:45:14,430 --> 00:45:15,830
Thank you, General.

896
00:45:15,830 --> 00:45:17,060
Be careful.
