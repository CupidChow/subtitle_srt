My lord,

19
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,090
these two blades

20
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:40,210
are made with the new technique.

21
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:01,660
Lord.

22
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,140
With the help of such a technique,

23
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:19,570
our victory can be expected.

24
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:38,700
Well done.

25
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:45,220
Lord Shen,

26
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:47,010
it’s been confirmed

27
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:48,860
that Chen Zichen will go hunting soon.

28
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:58,900

You’re in a good mood, Your Highness.

32
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:29,630
You...

33
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:31,730
Protect His Highness!

34
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:32,420
Go, Your Highness!

35
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:40,500
Don’t move!

36
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:49,220
You should

37
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:51,530
hire better guards.

38
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:53,010
I didn’t do anything to you.

39
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:54,170
What are you up to?

40
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:56,700
You, Chen Zichen,

41
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,880
are the perfect leverage

42
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,320
to wipe out the Chens.

43
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:53,870
Shen Tianshu,

44
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:55,800
what do you want?

45
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,030
Me?

46
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,350
I want

47
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:04,000
everything you have.

48
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,870
That small sect of yours

49
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:08,960
is no match for thousands of our troops.

50
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,870
Bring it here.

51
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,910
Watch carefully.

52
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:26,720
This is your armor.

53
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:38,960
Just so you know,

54
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,560
this blade is crafted

55
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,150
according to Refinement of Iron

56
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:44,840
in the Color of Ocean and Heaven.

57
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:47,350
How is that possible?

58
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,000
Not just that.

59
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,670
Yu Wenzhi’s force
will set out from the north.

60
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:55,600
You can’t win

61
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,550
a two-fronted war.

62
00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:00,350
The Chens cut the Xiaos off.

63
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:01,550
Now,

64
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:02,920
I’m the one

65
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,670
to cut you off.

66
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,790
My lord,

67
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:27,670
Nanling Prefecture

68
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:29,950
is to the south of Jiankang.

69
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:31,350
Once we take it,

70
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:32,550
it’s only a matter of time

71
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:33,720
before we occupy Jiankang.

72
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,920
Send scouts there

73
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,320
immediately.

74
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,200
Yes.

75
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,110
Report!

76
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:42,000
Lord Shen,

77
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,350
Lord Lu had them make you this Iron Hand

78
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:44,880
with the new technique.

79
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:07,600
How’s the production

80
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,510
of weapons going?

81
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:10,480
My lord,

82
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,480
we’ve been remaking them

83
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,390
according to
that blacksmith’s original note.

84
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,390
After multiple tests,

85
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:18,480
we’ve corrected the technique

86
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,550
and been expediting the production.

87
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:38,000
Lu Tiankuang can no longer be trusted.

88
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Hadn’t you ordered me

89
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,270
to interrogate that traitor

90
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:42,350
who claimed to have killed
that blacksmith,

91
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:43,600
I wouldn’t have discovered

92
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,640
Lu Tiankuang’s plot.

93
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,160
Then I quickly searched

94
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,720
the blacksmith’s room

95
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,760
and found the original note.

96
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,200
After comparison,

97
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,160
the amount of metal

98
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,920
in our note had been altered.

99
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,510
That’s why blades made previously

100
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:58,760
were fragile.

101
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:01,760
Lu Tiankuang tampered with the note

102
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:06,920
in an attempt to kill me.

103
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,480
Should I

104
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:11,550
call him naive or stupid?

105
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:13,950
My lord,

106
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,160
what should we do about him?

107
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:22,230
Pay him in his own coin.

108
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:24,670
Use

109
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,270
what he gave us

110
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:30,550
to make him an iron hook

111
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,790
and send it to him secretly.

112
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,840
Yes.

113
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:41,400
May I ask

114
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,030
what this secret meeting is about?

115
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:45,440
We’re here to warn you

116
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,710
that Yu Wenzhi is about to revolt.

117
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,610
Who told you that?

118
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:52,100
Is there any proof?

119
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,860
Please have a look.

120
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,370
It includes

121
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:57,220
all Yu Wenzhi’s secret meetings

122
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,130
with General Zhao of Yongzhou.

123
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:00,220
We also heard

124
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:02,220
he and Head of Demons Manor,
Shen Tianshu,

125
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,540
would take action together soon.

126
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:04,370
We believe

127
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:06,130
they’re about to start a war.

128
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,370
How dare

129
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:10,900
that Yu Wenzhi

130
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,900
rebel against us!

131
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:16,420
He’s evil.

132
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:19,130
He accused my father of treason

133
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:21,610
and slaughtered my whole family.

134
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:25,050
He’s my mortal enemy.

135
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:27,540
Please help us.

136
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:30,780
General Wu was loyal.

137
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:33,050
He would die for the state.

138
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:35,660
He shouldn’t have ended up like that.

139
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:38,980
Rest assured, Miss Wu,

140
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,340
I’ll go back

141
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,980
and report everything to His Majesty

142
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,300
to bring him to justice.

143
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,300
Thank you.

144
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,180
Thank you, Vice Censor Guo.

145
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,010
Take the antidote

146
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:25,860
to my knockout drops.

147
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,300
You won’t be affected

148
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,810
by it for four hours.

149
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:36,500
(Demons Manor)

150
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:58,260
(Demons Manor)

151
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,660
Deliver the weapons to the South Gate.

152
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:21,860
Go!

153
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:39,300
Shen Tianshu,

154
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:42,250
never would you’ve guessed

155
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:45,370
that I’d become

156
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:47,540
the Head of Demons Manor in the end!

157
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:55,900
(Demons Manor)

158
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:27,300
Kill!

159
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,020
(Demons Manor)

160
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:38,930
-Charge!
-Charge!

161
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:47,540
(Demons Manor)

162
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,740
(Demons Manor)

163
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:10,100
Lord Shen,

164
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,980
they’re breaking in.

165
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:47,180
Xie Yun!

166
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:49,930
-Zichen, this again?
-This again?

167
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,420
Xie Yun,

168
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:03,300
I’m sorry.

169
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,860
Oh, save it!

170
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:08,220
You must pay a bigger price

171
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:10,220
for killing my sister!

172
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:11,450
In your dreams!

173
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:22,300
Fei,

174
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:25,250
don’t waste your time on him.

175
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:26,450
I’ll take care of things here.

176
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:57,450
Back in the dungeon,

177
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:59,780
I kept you alive for
giving me half of that bun,

178
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:02,420
but never did I

179
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,300
see this coming.

180
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,570
Cut it out.

181
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,570
That won’t postpone your death.

182
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:11,660
What a joke!

183
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:14,810
Even the top masters

184
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:17,740
have died in my hand.

185
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:21,220
I’ll soon have my own empire.

186
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,540
Young lady,

187
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:24,050
you can’t stop me.

188
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:27,340
What empire?

189
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:31,370
More like an evil gang.

190
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:32,930
Shen Tianshu,

191
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:34,370
you’re a shameless sinner,

192
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:35,810
a joke!

193
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:38,450
And you wish to rule the state?

194
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:40,300
In your dreams!

195
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,050
Who do you think you are?

196
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:46,180
You’re a rare talent,

197
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:47,860
but

198
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:49,690
if I can’t have you,

199
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:52,450
I’ll have to get rid of you.

200
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:19,610
Xie Yun!

201
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:04,980

203
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:44,660
Shen Tianshu, you bastard!

204
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:50,620
(Youhuang)

205
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:18,420
He’s dead.

206
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,010
Look at you.

207
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,820
As fairylike as you are,

208
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:30,970
you’ve been near death more than once.

209
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,090
I can

210
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:35,780
try harder

211
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:37,130
and make you

212
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:38,660
my consort.

213
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,540
No.

214
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:46,300

what are you doing?

237
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,920
Didn’t Abbot Tongming say

00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:17,710
you can’t get out of bed alone?

239
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:19,000
Have a seat.

240
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,760
I’m here for tea.

241
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,070
How do you feel?

242
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:27,040
I know my condition.

243
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,400
I’m strong enough

244
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,680
to walk around.

245
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,400
You still need more rest.

246
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,160
I miss the kids

247
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:35,040
and I want to go home.

248
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:37,350
That won’t be a problem.

249
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:39,070
Sir.

250
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:39,880
Sir.

251
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,230
Sir,

252
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:42,350
am I healthy enough

253
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:43,710
to leave?

254
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:45,350
Of course.

255
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,190
When you get back and see my disciple,

256
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:52,710
tell him

257
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:54,400
to visit me whenever he can.

258
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:57,190
I’m old.

259
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:58,880
He’s been gone for a while.

260
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,590
I miss him.

261
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:02,830
I’ll tell him.

262
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,950
Sir,

263
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:09,280
thank you

264
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,710
for saving Jinrong’s life.

265
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,880
We won’t be able to

266
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,110
meet again anytime soon.

267
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:16,640
Allow me to bow to you.

268
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,860
This is too much. Please rise.

269
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,680
The world is small.

270
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,950
Someday,

271
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:27,040
we’ll see each other again.

272
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:35,580
(Hall of Elders)

273
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:41,260
Say it.

274
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:48,020
You say it, Yan.

275
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:52,570
Sheng,

276
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,330
I want to go to the South.

277
00:26:57,170 --> 00:26:58,100
Really?

278
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:01,530
What the hell are you thinking?

279
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:03,290
Why travel that far?

280
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:06,740
We’ve made a decision.

281
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:09,410
No!

282
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:10,740
You’re young,

283
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:11,620
inexperienced

284
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:12,740
and ignorant.

285
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:13,690
It’s not safe.

286
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:16,140
Sheng,

287
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:20,290
I’m not as capable as you and Fei,

288
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:21,810
but I’m no longer a kid.

289
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:23,170
I’m skilled enough

290
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:25,290
to protect myself.

291
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:27,980
And I have company.

292
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,290
Everything will be fine.

293
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:30,020
Yes.

294
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:31,020
I won’t let anyone

295
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,210
or anything hurt her.

296
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:33,690
I promise.

297
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:38,330
Fine.

298
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:40,050
You’re a big girl.

299
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:41,410
If that’s what you want,

300
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:42,780
just go ahead.

301
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:44,530
Remember.

302
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:46,050
Don’t forget to write to us.

303
00:27:47,050 --> 00:27:48,380
I will.

304
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:56,980
Eat well.

305
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,290
Keep yourself warm.

306
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:06,530
Take good care of my sister.

307
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:07,620
If anything happens to her,

308
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,380
I’ll stuff that blade

309
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:10,740
into your stomach.

310
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,900
Well then, I’m busy.

311
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:15,660
I’m off.

312
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:16,740
Sheng,

313
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:21,410
I’ll miss you, Sheng.

314
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:24,780
He’s agreed?

315
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,660
You chicken!

316
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:31,900
You said you’d tell him, didn’t you?

317
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:34,810
I’m shy.

318
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:47,780
Chuchu,

319
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:49,740
what are you doing?

320
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:51,380
I’ve been

321
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:52,900
organizing martial arts manuals.

322
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,810
It’s safe now.

323
00:28:54,810 --> 00:28:56,450
So I’m thinking to go out

324
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:57,900
to bring back manuals I missed

325
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:00,330
to complete my collection.

326
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:01,950
You’re leaving, too?

327
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:04,010
Who else is also leaving?

328
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:07,260
Yan

329
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:09,650
insists on going to
the South with Yang Jin.

330
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,910
What are you thinking?

331
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:23,260
Are you mad?

332
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:30,290
You’re clearly upset.

333
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:31,980
I lied.

334
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:36,050
Masters of all sects have agreed

335
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:37,690
to deliver the manuals here

336
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:39,620
to spare me the trip.

337
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:40,930
Really?

338
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:47,780
Stop hanging out with Li Yan

339
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,620
or Zhou Fei.

340
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:50,140
You’ve...

341
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:51,210
No way.

342
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:53,140
I enjoy spending time with them.

343
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:54,900
Choose between me or them.

344
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,140
Which one is it?

345
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:02,380
I’m going to dry books.

346
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,570
Pieces on the board were messed up.

347
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:53,260
It took me a while

348
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:54,900
to reposition them,

349
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:58,290
but some are still

350
00:30:58,290 --> 00:30:59,810
not the same as before.

351
00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:08,450
I racked my brain to solve it

352
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:10,980
but the solution is quite simple.

353
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:15,810
Do you mean

354
00:31:15,810 --> 00:31:18,210
it had been solved?

355
00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:27,290
The game isn’t wrong.

356
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:31,930
It’s me

357
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:33,930
who insist on

358
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:36,860
clinging on to the past.

359
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:41,570
I should

360
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:44,380
learn from you in that regard.

361
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:54,140
I should’ve let go of the past

362
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:55,660
and moved on long ago.

363
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:08,020
What about the Anping Army?

364
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:10,860
The war is over, so they can go home.

365
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:14,480
It’s good that the masses are safe

366
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,490
and peace is restored.

367
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:18,980
Yu Wenzhi has been executed

368
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,980
for rebellion.

369
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,780
His evil nature would lead him

370
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:24,660
down that road sooner or later.

371
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:27,570
By the way,

372
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:30,110
what about Shen Tianshu’s men

373
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:31,560
and villagers

374
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,040
in the Big Medicine Valley?

375
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,350
While the latter

376
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:36,280
have returned home safe and sound,

377
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:39,110
the former have been given amnesty.

378
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,570
I hope the heard-earned peace

379
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:47,900
will last long.

380
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:55,980
My daughter is stubborn.

381
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:57,690
Please bear with her.

382
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:04,780
(One Year Later)

383
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:06,380
I’ve long heard about his reputation.

384
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:08,690
-Be patient. Keep in line.
-I came all the way for treatment.

385
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:16,330
Don’t worry.

386
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:19,330
Take enough rest.

387
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,100
Thank you.

388
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:44,410
Excuse me, do you often
gather herbs here?

389
00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:45,690
Does a famous physician Sun Simiao

390
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:48,530
live in Taibai Mountain?

391
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:51,660
Go uphill along the way,

392
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:52,900
pass the bamboo forest

393
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:55,450
and you’ll see his cottage.

394
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:57,740
Are you sick?

395
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:59,050
Not exactly.

396
00:33:59,050 --> 00:34:00,860
I have something for him.

397
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,570
Thanks for your information.

399
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:41,140
Excuse me, are you Qiwu Huaiwen?

400
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:43,490
I am.

401
00:34:43,490 --> 00:34:44,570
Finally!

402
00:34:44,570 --> 00:34:46,700
You’re well-known.

404
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:51,180

(Refinement of Iron)

406
00:34:53,810 --> 00:34:54,970
I’ve heard

407
00:34:54,970 --> 00:34:56,730
it includes advanced techniques

408
00:34:56,730 --> 00:34:59,100
that can produce
better and tougher ironware.

409
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:00,900
With this book,

410
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:03,220
many problems at hand can be solved.

411
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:04,500
This is great! Wonderful!

414
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:34,900
I know

415
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,970
General Wang

416
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:37,860
dedicated his life

417
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:39,730
to building a peaceful
and prosperous state.

418
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:41,100
Now that peace has been achieved

419
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,730
and rejuvenation can be expected,

420
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:45,810
he can rest in peace.

421
00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:52,460
I hope people can forever

422
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:54,250
live a happy and peaceful life.

423
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:38,380
Let’s go.

424
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:40,330
Yes.

425
00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:41,970
Thank you, Miss Wu.

426
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:42,900
This is really good!

427
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,220
We’re leaving. Good day.

428
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:45,050
Take care.

429
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:48,330
-Take care.
-Goodbye.

430
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:48,970
Let’s go.

431
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:50,180
-This is a good thing.
-I agree.

432
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:53,250
-That’s right.
-So good.

433
00:36:57,730 --> 00:36:58,860
Miss Wu,

434
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:00,660
here are some martial arts manuals

435
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:02,660
for you to have a study.

436
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:07,860
(Cherish the Memory of the Ancestors)

437

00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:32,420
(Cherish the Memory of the Ancestors)

440
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:33,860
Li Sheng,

441
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:35,250
news came in from our men in Sichuan

442
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:36,900
that there are bandits

443
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:39,660
robbing others in the south.

444
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:42,420
It’s our duty

445
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:44,530
to protect out there.

446
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:46,730
Tell them in the letter

447
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:49,010
that I’ll send our men

448
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:51,100
to teach those bandits a lesson.

449
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:52,100
Yes.

450
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:54,970
Sheng.

451
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:56,300
(Cherish the Memory of the Ancestors)

452
00:37:56,810 --> 00:37:57,730
Chuchu.

453
00:37:57,730 --> 00:37:58,700
It’s hot outside.

454
00:37:58,700 --> 00:37:59,860
What brings you here?

455
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,490
To check on you.

456
00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:03,380
I heard you had sent out invitations

457
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:04,620
to gather martial artists together

458
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:06,770
on Mid-Autumn Festival.

459
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:08,770
That’s right.

460
00:38:08,770 --> 00:38:11,490
Your collection of manuals of all sects

461
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:13,010
is almost complete.

462
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:14,220
I’d like to

463
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:16,180
invite them over

464
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:18,490
to patch things up.

465
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,290
So,

466
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:22,290
half of all sects will be here?

467
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:25,010
It’s quite peaceful

468
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:27,140
in the state,

469
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:29,810
so they’re free.

470
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:31,730
Why didn’t you give me a heads-up?

471
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:32,860
Some of the manuals

472
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:34,620
are still undone.

473
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:36,140
What to do?

474
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:39,660
I can help you.

475
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:41,180
I’m not busy

476
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:43,140
with any trouble lately.

477
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:44,380
You said that yourself.

478
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:45,970
(Cherish the Memory of the Ancestors)

479
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:48,530
Carry them to Li Sheng’s study.

480
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:49,460
-Yes.
-Yes.

481
00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:56,100
Thanks for your help.

482
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:07,730
Fei.

483
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:11,010
Here’s a letter from your cousin.

484
00:39:15,290 --> 00:39:17,290
He’s holding a gathering

485
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:20,180
at Liu’s Manor for Chuchu.

486
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,460
It’s a big event.

487
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:25,290
He’s probably nervous,

488
00:39:25,290 --> 00:39:26,810
so he wants you there

489
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:28,290
to support him.

490
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:31,050
Will you go, Fei?

491
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:35,050
I have to be there for them.

492
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:37,420
It’s not too far anyway.

493
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:42,330
It’s time for all sects
of Central Plains

494
00:39:42,330 --> 00:39:43,860
to march into a new phase.

495
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:46,330
Li Sheng ticks all the boxes

496
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:47,810
in terms of intelligence, ability
and background.

497
00:39:47,810 --> 00:39:49,730
Most importantly, he’s humble

498
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:51,620
instead of self-conceited.

499
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:52,700
He’s quite popular

500
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:54,010
among seniors.

501
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:55,460
They all favor him.

502
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:57,970
I bet

503
00:39:57,970 --> 00:39:59,460
all sects are using this chance

504
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:01,290
to take things up a notch.

505
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:02,460
Him?

506
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:05,050
He isn’t

507
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:07,570
as skilled

508
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:08,970
as senior masters,

509
00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:10,530
but he’s a rare talent

510
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:12,570
in the younger generation.

511
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:14,330
How come he’s a weak nerd

512
00:40:14,330 --> 00:40:16,770
in your eyes?

513
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:20,330
No wonder

514
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:22,530
a young and passionate man

515
00:40:23,010 --> 00:40:24,660
like him

516
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:27,460
is always so modest.

517
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:30,620
All because he grew up

518
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:33,050
in a tough environment.

519
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:41,140
I’d better get more help

520
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:42,570
for him.

521
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:44,970
He never gives me a break.

522
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:47,290
I know, right?

523
00:40:47,290 --> 00:40:49,100
Miss Zhou, you’re an unparalleled

524
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:50,290
and invincible talent.

525
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:59,450
Had I known I’d be so lucky to have you,

526
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:02,220
back at the Ximo River,

527
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:05,180
I would’ve dressed up

528
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:06,570
and looked better

529
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:08,180
with my Footwork.

530
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,700
There was just a Weed Spirit.

531
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:13,220
Why would you dress up?

532
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:20,420
To seduce other girls.

533
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:25,220
I’ve proposed six times

534
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:26,420
but only got rejected

535
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:28,460
by your parents
with all sorts of excuses.

536
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:30,770
I’m tough enough

537
00:41:30,770 --> 00:41:32,180
to bite through steel now.

538
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:35,010
What a world!

539
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:36,460
Fei,

540
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:37,570
stop bullying me,

541
00:41:37,570 --> 00:41:38,530
or

542
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:41,140
I’ll write a play about the South Blade,

543
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:42,570
telling the world

544
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:44,970
that you’re a bully.

545
00:41:44,970 --> 00:41:46,180
I dare you!

546
00:41:47,050 --> 00:41:48,010
Fei,

547
00:41:48,010 --> 00:41:49,050
how about this?

548
00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:51,220
Let’s swing by Liu’s Manor for the event

549
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:53,490
and then head to Jiankang.

550
00:41:54,290 --> 00:41:55,290
Once the winter is over,

551
00:41:55,290 --> 00:41:57,290
let’s go to the grassland to see sheep.

552
00:41:57,290 --> 00:41:59,570
Do you have anything else to do

553
00:41:59,570 --> 00:42:01,250
other than having fun?

554
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:02,380
We can buy lambs

555
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:04,460
and roast them. Money isn’t a problem.

556
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:05,860
The skin will taste crispy
and meat tender.

557
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:07,620
No need to add other spices.

558
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:09,940
A little bit of salt is enough.

559
00:42:13,810 --> 00:42:16,250
I’ll write to my mother

560
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:17,570
and let her know.

561
00:42:18,810 --> 00:42:19,460
Sure.

562
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:20,730
Let’s go.

563
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:33,810

569
00:42:43,810 --> 00:42:46,460
It’s won a few times
without losing once.

570
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:47,460
Don’t scare me.

571
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:49,860
If you lose,
you’ll have to buy me candy.

576
00:43:08,010 --> 00:43:09,100
Mr. Xie,

577
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:10,190
where did you get this?

578
00:43:10,430 --> 00:43:11,280
It’s huge!

579
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,840
Is this a rare tiger-head cricket?

580
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:15,870
It looks so strong.

581
00:43:16,850 --> 00:43:18,460
You’re sharp.

582
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:19,900
It is a tiger-head cricket.

583
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:22,900
Only a good student

584
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:24,570

585
00:43:24,570 --> 00:43:26,940
There’s only one.

586
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:28,980
Whoever has a higher score can have it.

587
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:30,850
-I want it.
-Give it to me.

588
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:32,420
What did I say?

589
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:33,130
Sit back.

590
