17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,680
Let’s get some rest here.

18
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,870
Once Dragon Master and the troops leave,

19
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:40,190
we can get out and escape.

20
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:41,210
Escape?

21
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,800
Dragon Master is onto you.

22
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,800
Don’t even dream about escaping.

23
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,310
Dragon Master will hunt you down

24
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:50,060
no matter where you are.

25
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:52,760
You think this crappy hideout

26
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,340
can keep him away? Don’t be ridiculous!

27
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:57,040
Aren’t you his follower?

28
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,120
Wouldn’t he save you?

29
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,550
If he arrives,

30
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:01,850
I’ll be his first target of murder.

31
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:06,900
Others take in disciples

32
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:09,730
while Dragon Master has adopted 18 kids.

33
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,880
I heard others call you “Young Master”.

34
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:15,320
Don’t flatter me. I’m ashamed of it.

35
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,880
Don’t you know

36
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,480
even dogs

37
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:20,800
have names, too?

38
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:23,440
Each time we see him,

39
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,530
we can only speak in prostration.

40
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,270
He’s also

41
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,980
marked all of us.

42
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,080
Where’s your mark?

43
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:38,830
Didn’t you see that big mark?

44
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:40,680
You should be ashamed.

45
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:43,720
You can say that again.

46
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,050
Be that as it may,

47
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:47,510
I’m the smartest and most obedient

48
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,830
people pleaser.

49
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,500
So he always takes me with him.

50
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,800
Old Dragon was too dull

51
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:00,690
to be anywhere near Master,

52
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:04,030
so he could only swallow his pride

53
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,300
and suck up to me.

54
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:07,540
That’s why I took him

55
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,600
to take care of that old fart.

56
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:16,030
Supposedly,

57
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,680
it wouldn’t take him too long.

58
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,370
But we didn’t expect

59
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,740
the North Blade

60
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:23,710
had help.

61
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,710
You’re good!

62
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,760
You killed Old Dragon.

63
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,360
Were it before that I bullied others

64
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,750
and made mistakes,

65
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,420
I’d be whipped and let go.

66
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,040
But this time,

67
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:48,140
whipping alone wouldn’t be enough.

68
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,210
You’re going to get beaten up.

69
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,040
The South and North Blades
were the Top Two.

70
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:16,350
Li Zheng was in the south

71
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:17,820
while Guan Feng was in the north,
hence the titles.

72
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,800
Old Master Li was
well-connected.

73
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:22,920
He became

74
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,950
a household name

75
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:25,940
because of the Fortress
of the Forty-Eight.

76
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,440
On the contrary,

77
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,440
Mr. Guan, Guan Feng,

78
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,200
was less engaged

79
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,450
although he was ten years older.

80
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,280
There were stories
about him in the past,

81
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,950
but ever since that armed rebellion,

82
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,080
he never came to Central Plains again

83
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,130
and only existed in stories.

84
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,070
My mother once told me about them.

85
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,520
The South Blade was cold

86
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,970
as the snowstorm

87
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:58,980
while the North Blade
could cut off water.

88
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:01,610
The North Blade was fierce.

89
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:03,830
Yes, he was,

90
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,870
fierce and shameless.

91
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,640
At that time,

92
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,660
I believed I was skilled enough

93
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:16,260
to leave for Central Plains.

94
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,800
My master didn’t want me to,

95
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,170
but I thought he was timid

96
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:23,960
and old.

97
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,820
I didn’t listen to him.

98
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,680
Seeing that he couldn’t change my mind,

99
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:35,440
he told me over and over before I left

100
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,540
to always think twice.

101
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:39,820
He said,

102
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:41,800
“look,

103
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:44,880
your blade

104
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,330
is similar to a farmer’s hoe

105
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,830
and an accountant’s abacus.

106
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:56,120
Both are to get things done,

107
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:58,510
not to gain fame and wealth.

108
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,530
Do not mistake it”.

109
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:07,090
How is a blade equal to
a hoe or an abacus?

110
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,780
I didn’t get it either,

111
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,920
so I ignored it.

112
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,490
I thought

113
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,390
a blade is a weapon.

114
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:19,990
It has a soul

115
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,390
that connects mine

116
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:26,220
as if it were part of my body.

117
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,750
How could it be compared
with a lifeless tool?

118
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,900
After I arrived in Central Plains,

119
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:46,260
soon,

120
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,350
I made a name of myself

121
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:51,600
by this blade.

122
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,940
I was proud

123
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:54,700
and I planned

124
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,970
to start my own sect

125
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,670
to revitalize the North Blade.

126
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:03,030
Within six months,

127
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,110
I challenged seven masters

128
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:06,790
and beat them all

129
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,190
until...

130
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,390
Soon after the North Blade,
Ji Yunchen, arrived,

131
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:16,920
he defeated seven masters in a row.

132
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,480
So far, he hasn’t lost once.

133
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,670
He’s really something!

134
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:21,830
He hasn’t challenged Mr. Yin.

135
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,920
You know what?

136
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:26,270
His master holed up

137
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:28,390
far away from Central Plains for so long

138
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:29,070
because

139
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,970
he had lost to the Mountain Sword,
Yin Wenlan.

140
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,510
Obviously,

141
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:34,550
water cutting is nothing.

142
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:36,320
It doesn’t deserve to be
one of the two Blades

143
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,010
as the Snow-breaking Blade does.

144
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:40,600
Those rumors can’t be trusted.

145
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,910
I agree.

146
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:45,300
Where are you going next, Mr. Yan?

147
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,080
Not sure yet.

148
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,510
Please enjoy.

149
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:51,580
Please.

150
00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:10,460
(Yin’s Mansion)

151
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,460
Sir,

152
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,600
you’d better leave.

153
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,240
Yin Wenlan!

154
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,220
(Yin Wenlan, the Mountain Sword)

155
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:26,940
Are you not up for the challenge?

156
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,580
Fine.

157
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,480
I’ll wait here for three days.

158
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,110
If you don’t come out,

159
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:34,590
I’ll tell the world

160
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:37,150
the Mountain Sword is
inferior to the North Blade.

161
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:40,880
Yin Wenlan!

162
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:49,590
When my mother was about my age,

163
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:51,520
she broke into Demons Manor

164
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,200
and battled the top three Demons

165
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,700
together with Duan Jiuniang.

166
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:57,590
The latter was well-known for her Palm

167
00:08:57,590 --> 00:09:00,140
in her early 20s.

168
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,670
And Mr. Ji

169
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:04,940
quickly made a name of himself,

170
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,550
planning to set up his own sect.

171
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:11,100
But what about me?

172
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,060
What’s on your mind?

173
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,520
I think

174
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,880
my weapon is no different

175
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,080
from a blunt tool.

176
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:27,080
Mr. Ji,

177
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,910
then what happened?

178
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:41,300
(Yin’s Mansion)

179
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:45,820
What are you doing here?

180
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:49,080
Beat it, kid.

181
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,770
I’m not any kid.

182
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:53,520
The Mountain Sword,

183
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,120
Yin Wenlan, is my father.

184
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:57,660
You’re Yin Wenlan’s son?

185
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,350
Good. Go home

186
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:01,110
and tell your father to come out.

187
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:01,840
No.

188
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,760
Why?

189
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,080
I sneaked out

190
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,430
because I didn’t want to study.

191
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:08,670
What do you want to do?

192
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:09,360
Play games.

193
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,450
Alright.

194
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,280
Let’s go

195
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,210
play games.

196
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:19,760
Once you have enough fun,

197
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,930
I’ll bring you back.

198
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,150
Alright?

199
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,350
This will be

200
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,630
our secret.

201
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,200
Let’s go.

202
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:28,960
That day,

203
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:32,640
Guan Feng charged at
Mr. Yin with his blade.

204
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,760
The two fought for 300 rounds.

205
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:35,870
Everyone,

206
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:40,060
can you imagine that?

207
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:42,590
They fought so hard

208
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:46,000
that the world seemed to
fall apart in darkness.

209
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,080
All that could be seen
were gleaming blades.

210
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:53,790
Still, Mr. Yin’s skills

211
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:57,560
were unparalleled, one of a kind.

212
00:10:58,350 --> 00:10:59,720
The Mountain Sword

213
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,180
crushed the North Blade

214
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:03,080
who lost terribly

215
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,990
and made a fool of himself.

216
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,030
-Yes! Great!
-Good!

217
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:09,110
Sir,

218
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:10,640
who’s the North Blade

219
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,150
that lost terribly to my father?

220
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:16,280
I can’t wait to see that loser.

221
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:19,000
Everyone, that coward Guan Feng

222
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:22,400
was so scared of Mr. Yin...

223
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,180
What are you doing?

224
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,400
That he...

225
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,550
What are you doing?

226
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:27,320
-Wet his pants.
-I want to hear more!

227
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,910
And he shivered in his sleep.

228
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:31,400
Hadn’t I heard

229
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,830
the made-up story,

230
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,800
I wouldn’t have lost control of myself.

231
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,040
You lost control

232
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,020
so you held that boy hostage

233
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,970
to force his father to battle you.

234
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:55,140
(Shanchan Temple)

235
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,570
Father.

236
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:26,850
Are you that boy?

237
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:31,620
Master,

238
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,000
bad news!

239
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:52,340
(Your son Yin Pei is in my hands...)

240
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:54,020
(Ji Yunchen)

241
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:01,170
Bring me the sword.

242
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,550
Yes.

243
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:06,090
My father could destroy you

244
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:08,880
even if he was injured.

245
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:16,920
That’s right.

246
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,670
I wasn’t his match.

247
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:50,830
Mr. Ji,

248
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:52,590
I didn’t expect

249
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:54,960
you’d go so low

250
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:55,800
just to challenge me.

251
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:59,390
My master’s reputation can’t be ruined.

252
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:00,840
Today,

253
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:04,080
I’m here to defend the North Blade.

254
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:58,910
I didn’t know until later

255
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:00,580
that he just drove those Demons away

256
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:04,230
before I picked a fight.

257
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:05,720
He was already injured

258
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:08,110
but had to come

259
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:09,670
under my threat.

260
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:10,930
When we fought,

261
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:14,100
he could’ve killed me.

262
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,400
I’d accept

263
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,960
whatever the result was.

264
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,470
I could start over

265
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:26,960
in ten years.

266
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,760
But

267
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,280
by breaking your sword,

268
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,260
you’re insulting me!

269
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,850
Mr. Ji,

270
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,220
you’ll have to go through thick and thin

271
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,560
in the years to come.

272
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,500
I simply don’t want

273
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,410
young men like you

274
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:49,980
to die in my hands for nothing.

275
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:53,300
Master, Master!

276
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,520
Help!

277
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,840
We’re under attack!

278
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,590
What?

279
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:59,230
While you lured my father out,

280
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:00,460
those monsters broke in

281
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,640
and slaughtered my whole family!

282
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,000
A hundred of them

283
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,600
were killed!

284
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,690
Why are you still alive?

285
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:12,350
Why aren’t you dead?

286
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,260
Father!

287
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:16,690
Father!

288
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,480
Father! Father!

289
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:26,070
Father!

290
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:32,910
Father! Father! Father!

291
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:48,150
Father! Father! Father!

292
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,560
So when you brought Yin Pei back,

293
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,190
his entire family had been killed.

294
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,720
How could a little boy

295
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:15,710
handle the sudden loss of his family?

296
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,370
Not to mention seeing them
dead right in front of him.

297
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,470
Mr. Ji,

298
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,000
there are all kinds of words.

299
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,380
Some are inspiring,

300
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,400
while some are poisonous

301
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,520
and misleading.

302
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,590
People can say whatever they want.

303
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:33,570
It’s up to you to listen to them or not.

304
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:35,950
Once you do,

305
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:37,700
you’ll be manipulated by them.

306
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,350
You don’t know

307
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,770
how evil people can be.

308
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:44,230
Not everyone

309
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,380
is as honest as you.

310
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:47,710
Back then, you were young

311
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:48,940
and gullible.

312
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:50,390
Don’t be too hard on yourself.

313
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:55,320
What do you know?

314
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,230
Do you know how it feels

315
00:17:58,230 --> 00:17:59,800
to lose your entire family overnight?

316
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,560
Mr. Yin,

317
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,540
justice must be done.

318
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:11,360
But you’re targeting the wrong person.

319
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,110
Others don’t blame you

320
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:14,070
out of pity.

321
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,420
Do you really think you’ve won?

322
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:18,820
If so, the real culprit
is still out there

323
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,180
gloating over your stupidity.

324
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,640
Mr. Xie,

325
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,870
you don’t need to speak for me.

326
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:32,040
I made a mistake.

327
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,350
I owe him.

328
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:35,660
I won’t deny it.

329
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,830
The one who raised me

330
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,880
caused the death of my family.

331
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:01,470
You found out about that

332
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:04,110
by accident

333
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:05,960
and left in a rage

334
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:09,160
before running into Dragon Master

335
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,250
who took you in.

336
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,710
Everyone,

337
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:22,020
it’s almost time.

338
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,220
I’ll walk you out.

339
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:30,660
General.

340
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:32,920
Found anything?

341
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,190
Finding His Majesty

342
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:36,230
is like finding a needle in a haystack.

343
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:37,310
This time,

344
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:39,040
he’s with Miss Zhou and Miss Wu.

345
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,230
The three of them

346
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:40,880
make a bigger target than one.

347
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,900
Should I search again?

348
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,540
Don’t bother.

349
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,590
We can’t stop

350
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:48,690
His Majesty anyway.

351
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:50,950
Just go back

352
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:52,560
and report everything to Lord Gantang.

353
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:53,940
-Yes.
-Yes.

354
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:56,910
Yah!

355
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,830
Master,

356
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:04,680
General Wen seems to have left

357
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,470
and gone south.

358
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:07,830
Very well.

359
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:18,020
(Animal characters made by CG)

360
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:24,700
(Animal characters made by CG)

361
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,460
(Animal characters made by CG)

362
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,660
(Animal characters made by CG)

363
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:39,340
(Animal characters made by CG)

364
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:42,440
Mount Heng is in that direction.

365
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,330
Let’s go.

366
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:56,800
We’re out.

367
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:59,500
Thank you, Mr. Ji.

368
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:00,880
Don’t mention it.

369
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,800
Mr. Xie, where are you going next?

370
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,880
Any place is fine

371
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,110
for an idler like me.

372
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:07,310
After all that happened

373
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:08,430
between you two,

374
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:09,200
where are you heading to?

375
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,680
If you want,

376
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,170
you can all go to our Fortress.

377
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:22,510
Is that an invitation?

378
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,550
Yes. Are you going or not?

379
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:30,640
That boy toy could be a burden.

380
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:35,490
It’s not like we can kill him.

381
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:38,120
Should we leave him in the woods?

382
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:39,840
Excuse me?

383
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,750
That you’re the South Blade’s
granddaughter

384
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:44,220
doesn’t mean you can be disrespectful.

385
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,070
Without your grandfather,

386
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:47,640
you’re nothing.

387
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,520
Are the Two Blades together

388
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,920
the Mountain Sword’s match?

389
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,040
Enough.

390
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:52,830
Alright!

391
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:54,350
Show me your swordsmanship!

392
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:55,520
-Sure. Bring it on!
-Fei!

393
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,290
Come on!

394
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,980
Fei, ignore him.

395
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,280
Relax.

396
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,160
He doesn’t know

397
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,680
how to use

398
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,880
the Mountain Sword.

399
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:11,230
I’m not as good as
my mother or grandfather,

400
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:13,920
but at least, I didn’t
bring shame on them

401
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,560
to be someone else’s dog.

402
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,310
What did you say? Shut up,

403
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:20,000
or I’ll silence you!

404
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:22,310
Dragon Master has come!

405
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,430
Didn’t you say
we could depend on General Wen?

406
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:27,590
How come those clowns

407
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:28,640
caught up with us so soon?

408
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,920
He lost me in the middle of the fight.

409
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,040
Of course, he wouldn’t

410
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,220
waste more time on them

411
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,460
but left in a hurry.

412
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:42,000
What’s that about?

413
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,160
What did I do wrong?

414
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,000
You’re a pain in the neck.

415
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:49,020
We should go.

416
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:52,640
This place is isolated.

417
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,920
They wouldn’t have come this far.

418
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,100
(Animal characters made by CG)

419
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:16,140
(Animal characters made by CG)

420
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,690
A dog wearing a collar

421
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:24,060
can’t be taken freely.

422
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:26,840
What’s that supposed to mean?

423
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:32,740
The pills we take every day

424
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:34,530
give us certain scent

425
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:36,800
that can only be detected

426
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,350
by that sniffer mouse

427
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:39,460
in his hand.

428
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:44,090
Wherever I am,

429
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,400
he can track me down.

430
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,520
Why didn’t you

431
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,070
tell us earlier?

432
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,880
Now is too late.

433
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,110
You might as well shut up.

434
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:57,680
Give me

435
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,710
my dog back,

436
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:03,040
and you can die with dignity.

437
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:09,100
Really?

438
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:11,800
This is the first time

439
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,830
that I’ve been told

440
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:15,820
to die with dignity.

441
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,110
I wasn’t too sure at first,

442
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:34,980
but seeing that you’re
going to such great lengths,

443
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:37,900
that thing

444
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:39,800
must be true.

445
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,080
Hand over the Mountain Sword

446
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,360
if you want to live.

447
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:55,070
A dog like you

448
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:57,560
can be abandoned or killed anytime.

449
00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:00,310
Why is Dragon Master after you?

450
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,110
Is that his style?

451
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:06,700
Young man,

452
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:09,640
those lies you told

453
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,870
don’t make sense at all.

454
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:13,430
Try harder and use your brain

455
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:15,740
next time.

456
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,750
So

457
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:20,430
he’s after you

458
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:22,020
because you stole something from him

459
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,590
and tricked that old fool

460
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:25,860
into covering you.

461
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:27,230
Hadn’t it been

462
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:28,900
for that sword,

463
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:31,590
I wouldn’t have

464
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:32,800
lifted a finger to save you.

465
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:34,580
Am I that stupid?

466
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,350
No wonder

467
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:40,760
General Wen showed up out of nowhere.

468
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,080
May I know

469
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,160
who you are?

470
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:52,190
A little help here!

471
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,440
His Majesty is a member
of the imperial family.

472
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:06,560
Correct.

473
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:08,680
I’m of noble birth.

474
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,520
Wen Yu’s responsible for my safety.

475
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:13,670
I don’t like being followed around,

476
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:16,350
so he gave me a whistling arrow

477
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:17,530
in case of emergency.

478
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,090
Once it’s released,

479
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,680
wherever I am,

480
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:23,590
they’ll come to protect me.

481
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:32,160
Dragon Master,

482
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,920
you know whether that sword

483
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,130
belongs to you or not.

484
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,520
Only the original owner

485
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,160
can claim it back.

486
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,550
Others don’t deserve it.

487
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,680
Unfortunately,

488
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,470
that person is long gone.

489
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:45,940
We’re only two thieves

490
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:47,510
trying to steal that sword.

491
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,310
I don’t think

492
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:54,430
a renowned figure like you

493
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:56,760
would stoop this low, would you?

494
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,310
Let’s go.

495
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:17,950
Mr. Xie saved us again.

496
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:22,230
Look how smug he is!

497
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,160
Will this really work?

498
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:51,780
We can only try our luck.

499
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,860
Did you see his leg?

500
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:55,630
Was he injured?

501
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,400
General Wen must’ve

502
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,100
injured him.

503
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:02,120
Otherwise,

504
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,460
I wouldn’t take such a risk.

505
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,760
Wen Yu alone

506
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,730
might not be that devil’s match,

507
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:10,000
but his troops are many

508
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,470
and they’re well-disciplined.

509
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:13,060
Together, they taught him a lesson.

510
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,040
Had he been unharmed,

511
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,680
my trick

512
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,760
wouldn’t have worked.

513
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:21,000
Even if we had backups,

514
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,460
he wouldn’t

515
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:25,690
be afraid.

516
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:29,350
This place only seems to be peaceful.

517
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:30,630
The more fearless I look,

518
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:33,590
the more cautious Dragon Master is.

519
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:38,980
My lord, are we letting them go?

520
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:44,590
The important figure
General Wen mentioned

521
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:46,980
must be that young man.

522
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,760
We already

523
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:51,040
lost once to Wen Yu

524
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,200
and suffered a huge loss
outside Sanchun Inn.

525
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,430
Can’t you tell

526
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:57,560
why Wen Yu left all of a sudden?

527
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,880
If that man is related
to the imperial family,

528
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:05,070
things will become tricky.

529
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,000
Yes, my lord.

530
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,110
We’d better not challenge the court.

531
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:21,190
Will Dragon Master come again?

532
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,470
Take a guess.

533
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:26,830
Stop joking around. I’m serious.

534
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:28,400
He’ll soon see through my lie.

535
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,860
Let’s hide ourselves first.

536
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:30,920
Come.

537
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:41,700
(Animal characters made by CG)

538
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,000
(Animal characters made by CG)
Sniffer mice are sensitive.

539
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,590
They’ll hide

540
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:50,920
from the crowd.

541
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,280
Look.

542
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,830
That mouse

543
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:56,950
(Animal characters made by CG)
is going uphill freely.

544
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:58,800
That only means one thing.

545
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:01,190
No one else

546
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,000
is here.

547
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:13,230
Oh, no!

548
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:14,310
We’re exposed.

549
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:15,110
Let’s go!

550
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:16,760
Let’s go.

551
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:27,230
That stinky mouse!

552
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:29,000
Go ahead. I’ll cover you.

553
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:29,400
Let’s go.

554
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:34,740
(Animal characters made by CG)

555
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:04,640
Go get her!

556
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,470
-Yes.
-Let’s go.

557
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:08,470
Where’s Fei?

558
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:10,800
She stayed to buy us time.

559
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,230
Buy us time?

560
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:14,070
She’s killing me!

561
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,350
Look, Mr. Ji,

562
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:20,520
leave with Miss Wu.

563
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,430
I’ll go find Fei.

564
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:21,920
Sure.

565
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,190
We’ll catch up with you later.

566
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:24,400
If you don’t see us

567
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,310
in one hour…

568
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:27,470
I’ll take them into the secret tunnel
in Mount Heng,

569
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:29,870
and then escort Miss Wu to the Fortress.

570
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,110
Alright. Thanks.

571
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:08,710
Crap!

572
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:09,470
My energy is drained

573
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:11,640
after the attack earlier.

574
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,710
One more strike

575
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:15,340
can probably end me now.

576
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:16,560
Heck!

577
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:19,710
I can only bluff like Xie Yun.

578
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,000
You’re a Guardian, huh?

579
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,880
I bet

580
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,400
even Mu Xiaoqiao is better than you.

581
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:33,770
Who are you?

582
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:37,760
Take a guess.

583
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:42,340
I guess you’re about to meet your doom!

584
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:50,830
Watch it!

585
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:52,800
I can cut off the heavenly river.

586
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,640
Don’t blink.

587
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,470
Seize her!

588
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,800
A one-on-one with Dragon Master?

589
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,000
What were you thinking?

590
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,840
Didn’t you pull me up?

591
00:34:34,470 --> 00:34:36,150
Hadn’t it been for his palm,

592
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:37,100
you wouldn’t have

593
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,000
had such strength.

594
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,910
Should I thank him for that?

595
00:34:45,390 --> 00:34:47,180
My skills have improved a lot.

596
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,520
Stop laughing!

597
00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:01,050
As odd as he seems,

598
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,830
I still trust him for no reason.

599
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,120
Is it because of his look?

600
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:14,950
Are you messing with me?

601
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:17,040
Wait after we get out of here.

602
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,390
What are you looking for?

603
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:31,330
The secret tunnel should be nearby.

604
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:33,370
It’s concealed though.

605
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,630
Fei! Fei!

606
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:41,760
Come here!

607
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:21,390
Should I call you bold or stupid?

608
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:25,950
Where’s your blade?

609
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,360
None of your own business.

610
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:34,950
You fought against Dragon Master
barehanded.

611
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:35,600
That’s...

612
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,000
I’ve got nothing

613
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,520
other than this.

614
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,470
Make do with it.

615
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,560
Where did you get this?

616
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:48,760
Is it to brace yourself up?

617
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:50,870
I found it just now.

618
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:53,950
You can think up

619
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:54,800
all kinds of ways

620
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,600
to mock your own people.

621
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,390
But when it comes to

622
00:36:58,390 --> 00:36:59,950
life and death,

623
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:01,190
you can only talk with your fists.

624
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:03,190
Can you think first next time?

625
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:07,040
-You... You...
-Fei.

626
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,320
Stop arguing.

627
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:12,000
Don’t act rashly again.

628
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:13,280
But...

629
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,150
We’re worried about you.

630
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:15,910
I...

631
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,430
Isn’t he safe and sound?

632
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:18,870
So am I.

633
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:21,760
Yes, you returned intact,

634
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,630
but not your blade.

635
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:29,390
Once I’m back,

636
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:31,840
I’ll make you a bag

637
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:36,230
with multiple pouches around

638
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:37,360
for blades.

639
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:39,080
You can carry it

640
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,800
like a peacock spreading its tail.

641
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,450
How nice and convenient that is!

642
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:44,630
You won’t be short of weapons again.

643
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:48,630
Where are you going?

644
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:54,500
I’m going to...

645
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:00,870
to... The Fortress
of the Forty-Eight with you.

646
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:06,150
Let’s go.

647
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,840
Come on, Fei.

648
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:35,120
There are signs of struggle.

649
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:42,520
Dragon Master must be badly injured.

650
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,920
We can rest inside for now

651
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,840
until he leaves.

652
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,800
Is this the Forbidden Hall
of the Qi School?

653
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,890
Go get some clean water.

654
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,090
What for?

655
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,020
You don’t need to know.

656
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:55,560
No one

657
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,120
can get in or out

658
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,470
without filling that bowl

659
00:39:58,470 --> 00:39:59,680
with water.

660
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:01,720
Impressive!

661
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:04,080
Follow me.

662
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,390
-Miss Zhou. Miss Wu.
-Mr. Ji.

663
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:21,360
And Xiao...

664
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:24,320
I lied to them.

665
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,440
Call me Xie Yun.

666
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:27,870
Mr. Xie,

667
00:40:27,870 --> 00:40:30,000
what is it about the Mountain Sword

668
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:30,780
that you told Dragon Master?

669
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:32,990
He probably made that up.

670
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:39,470
Sorry.

671
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:41,670
I lied to him.

672
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:46,080
But I did hear things

673
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:47,930
that might or might not be true.

674
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:49,370
What do you know?

675
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:52,520
It’s said that

676
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,520
when the South Blade
was hunted by Demons,

677
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,870
he fought and ran

678
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:00,650
but was almost caught more than once.

679
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,690
Then unexpectedly,

680
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,170
he destroyed his weapon.

681
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,760
Is that true?

682
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:15,980
Why did I hear nothing from my father?

683
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:19,150
I don’t

684
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:20,790
get that, either.

685
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:22,560
Think about it.

686
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,190
When someone is

687
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,330
after you,

688
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:27,360
will you destroy your weapon

689
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:30,190
instead of trying to escape?

690
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:31,240
Of course not.

691
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,070
Then those blabbermouths

692
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,110
spread rumors

693
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,360
about some evil magic

694
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:43,190
that as long as

695
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:45,630
one obtained a master’s weapon,

696
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:48,150
he could gain that person’s skills.

697
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,040
That’s bullcrap.

698
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:55,440
Utter nonsense.

699
00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:58,910
Mr. Ji is unsuspecting.

700
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:00,060
He seems to be convinced.

701
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:03,520
Don’t look at me, Mr. Ji.

702
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,000
That’s just what I heard.

703
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,800
But I did learn to cast swords

704
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,300
to dig deep into it.

705
00:42:09,950 --> 00:42:11,490
How could that be possible?

706
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,790
It’s baseless.

707
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:15,710
Are you saying

708
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:18,130
Dragon Master plotted
against Mr. Yin Wenlan

709
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:21,110
because of such hogwash?

710
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:23,040
About that,

711
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:25,660
you need to ask Mr. Yin.

712
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,560
Mr. Yin.

713
00:42:49,390 --> 00:42:50,950
Now, can you tell us

714
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:52,700
why Dragon Master insists on
having you back?

715
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,100
It makes sense

716
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:09,050
that you fell out
with your foster father

717
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:11,630
after knowing the truth

718
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:12,540
about your family’s murder.

719
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:14,840
What doesn’t make sense is

720
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:16,280
you’d come all the way

721
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:18,070
to kill a feeble man

722
00:43:18,950 --> 00:43:20,760
at the cost of exposing yourself

723
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:22,100
after enduring years of humiliation.

724
00:43:24,390 --> 00:43:26,710
He seemed to come to stir up trouble

725
00:43:26,710 --> 00:43:28,560
with Old Dragon,

726
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:31,470
but actually, he wanted Old Dragon dead.

727
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:36,120
When he pretended to kill others

728
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:38,190
but got stopped

729
00:43:38,190 --> 00:43:39,720
by your chopstick,

730
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:41,340
he didn’t leave

731
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,110
but went straight into the Sanchun Inn

732
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:45,720
and came at you.

733
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,760
He was picking a fight on purpose.

734
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:48,160
Exactly.

735
00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:50,950
Then, of course,

736
00:43:50,950 --> 00:43:52,710
you caught him.

737
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:54,950
Other than that,

738
00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:56,350
he kept fanning the flames

739
00:43:57,150 --> 00:43:58,350
to incite you to kill Old Dragon.

740
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,080
No wonder

741
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:01,590
he’s been clinging on to us

742
00:44:01,910 --> 00:44:03,000
without any attempt to escape.

743
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:05,420
Later, when Dragon Master arrived

744
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:06,980
and encountered Wen Yu,

745
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:09,000
he managed to get out

746
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:12,960
and planned to kidnap Miss Wu.

747
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:15,020
That way,

748
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:17,020
he could take advantage
of Wen Yu’s power.

749
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:18,990
Although he failed,

750
00:44:19,470 --> 00:44:20,630
he still got out

751
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:21,680
with us.

752
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:25,430
Miss Zhou.

753
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:30,670
You’re smart enough
to figure out everything.

754
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:32,360
Why are you asking me?

755
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:34,360
I’m not half

756
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:35,950
as smart and calculative as you are.

757
00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:39,840
He can’t fight anymore.

758
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:40,950
What if

759
00:44:40,950 --> 00:44:43,040
no one in the Inn could stop Old Dragon?

760
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:43,870
Did that ever occur to you?

761
00:44:48,430 --> 00:44:49,720
Not everyone

762
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:51,810
is as lucky as you, lass!

763
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:55,260
You have family support and fine skills.

764
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:57,080
You’re so spoiled

765
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:59,040
and ignorant.

766
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:00,840
Is that

767
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:03,320
a complaint or a compliment?

768
00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:06,000
Without Ji Yunchen,

769
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,080
I would’ve become the heir

770
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:09,330
to the Mountain Sword.

771
00:45:10,190 --> 00:45:12,470
You wouldn’t even get to lick my boots!

772
00:45:12,470 --> 00:45:13,190
What did you say?

773
00:45:13,190 --> 00:45:14,320
You heard me!

774
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:15,130
You...

775
00:45:16,910 --> 00:45:18,450
Don’t mind it.

776
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:25,120
Yes, what could’ve happened?

777
00:45:25,950 --> 00:45:28,080
The worst case would be Ji Yunchen

778
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:29,710
and some unlucky man

779
00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:31,870
died in Old Dragon’s hands.

780
00:45:31,870 --> 00:45:33,180
What was that to do with us?

781
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:36,370
So you could easily tell him

782
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:38,140
that Ji Yunchen was your enemy.

783
00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:40,120
That wouldn’t raise any suspicion

784
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:41,560
as the good and the evil

785
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:42,910
were born to be foes.

786
00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:44,800
Old Dragon wouldn’t suspect a thing.

787
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,670
If he killed Ji Yunchen,

788
00:45:46,670 --> 00:45:48,580
that’d only boost his ego.

789
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,410
Because never did he know

790
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:51,480
that you’re a Yin,

791
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:52,850
nor would he ever expect

792
00:45:53,230 --> 00:45:54,320
that you wouldn’t

793
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:56,310
go back after this.
