17
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,400
Alright.

18
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,190
Get some rest while you still can.

19
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:07,550
Miss Wu,

20
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,320
you’re safe here.

21
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,720
Wait for me.

22
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,030
I’ll be back soon.

23
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,550
Li Sheng,

24
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:16,600
Demons are heartless and cruel.

25
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,080
Don’t put yourself

26
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,460
in danger.

27
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:23,030
Don’t worry.

28
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:24,520
Members of the Fortress

29
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,640
are the best of the best.

30
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,810
And we know this place the best.

31
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,100
Those Demons

32
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,960
aren’t our match.

33
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,080
I know.

34
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,030
I’m sure Fei is more than capable

35
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,960
to capture Yu Wenzhi

36
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,910
and put an end to everything.

37
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,330
I’m sorry

38
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:44,550
that you still have to live in fear

39
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:45,810
even in the Fortress.

40
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,650
I’m fine.

41
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,320
I have no fear

42
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,630
as long as I’m with you.

43
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,680
Nothing will happen to you

44
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,010
or the Fortress.

45
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:05,650
Sheng...

46
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,300
I have faith in you.

47
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:26,190
Chuchu,

48
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,920
wait for me.

49
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:54,860
(My dear wife...)

50
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:02,470
Fei.

51
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:03,880
Mr. Ma.

52
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:04,620
(My dear wife...)

53
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,550
Coming.

54
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,110
Come in, Fei.

55
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,270
Mr. Ma,

56
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:15,720
are the ten top talents

57
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,980
I asked for ready?

58
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:20,500
Oh, that.

59
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:26,460
Fei,

60
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,790
are you sure about what you’re doing?

61
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:30,700
I'm sure.

62
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:37,370
Mr. Ma, I know you care about me,

63
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,040
but

64
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,160
I’m not a little girl anymore.

65
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:45,030
It’s time for me to pitch in.

66
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:49,370
Look,

67
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,620
I’m not nagging you,

68
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,480
but you know, most talents

69
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,880
were just like you

70
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,270
who believed they could save the world

71
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:02,440
on their own

72
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,830
but only got themselves killed

73
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,940
eventually.

74
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,070
I watched you grow up

75
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:11,510
and the last thing I want

76
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:13,600
is to see you end up like them.

77
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,550
You know?

78
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:16,600
I do.

79
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,270
Although they were brave,

80
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,640
they lost their lives

81
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,000
for nothing.

82
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,270
I’m not that kind of person.

83
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,760
And

84
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,380
I’m not going to die.

85
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,920
That’s why I need the others

86
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,320
to guard the Fortress with me.

87
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:35,380
Alright.

88
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:38,210
You’ve made your decision.

89
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:41,140
I understand that.

90
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:42,700
I’m counting on you

91
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,880
for information

92
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,360
later.

93
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,320
People you asked for

94
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,640
are in the Hall of Elders.

95
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:57,050
Thank you, Mr. Ma.

96
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,270
Fei.

97
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,270
One more thing.

98
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:09,860
I believe

99
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:11,300
Mingfeng must’ve

100
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,160
betrayed us long ago.

101
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:16,220
It’s better not

102
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,300
get involved

103
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:25,790
with the court.

104
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:28,820
Alright.

105
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:30,590
I see.

106
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,510
Luckily, Fei and I

107
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:57,350
always took this path

108
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,440
to sneak out when we were little.

109
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:00,880
Check the front.

110
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,920
Yes.

111
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:09,370
How did they get here?

112
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:11,540
Someone is there.

113
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:14,200
Go! Go!

114
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,320
Stop!

115
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:18,290
Stop!

116
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,200
Stop there!

117
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:23,920
Stop! Go!

118
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,320
Stop!

119
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,720
Stop!

120
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,910
Weed Spirit is coming downhill.

121
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:40,000
Two Demons and their lackeys are there.

122
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:42,500
They outnumber her.

123
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,640
Zhang.

124
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:26,550
We’ll hold the fort and give orders.

125
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:27,830
Yes.

126
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:28,760
Ma,

127
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,000
check all posts.

128
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,760
Arrange them for defense.

129
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,110
Yes, I’m on my way.

130
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:37,760
Deng Zhen,

131
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,760
you and Li Sheng take our men

132
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:45,030
to guard every entry.

133
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:45,630
Yes.

134
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:48,250
Deng Zhen,

135
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,400
we’re shorthanded.

136
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,840
What to do?

137
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,230
The first gate is the key

138
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:57,200
and must be heavily guarded.

139
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,230
If we lose it,

140
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:01,080
Feihong Bridge is the next.

141
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,710
That should be

142
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:04,320
our second line of defense.

143
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,560
What if we lose that, too?

144
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,280
What to do then?

145
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,330
In that case,

146
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:16,470
Demons can charge into our Fortress.

147
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:19,390
We’ll be in grave danger.

148
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,590
How dare Demons and Yu Wenzhi

149
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:35,030
raid Chunhui Town and harm the innocent

150
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:36,590
in the name of suppressing bandits!

151
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:37,990
That’s unforgivable!

152
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,290
I think there’s more to it.

153
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:46,150
Yu Wenzhi is calculating and scheming.

154
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:48,370
If he intended to isolate the Fortress,

155
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:51,760
he wouldn’t need those civilians.

156
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,280
Are you saying

157
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,350
they’re up to something else?

158
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,660
You aren’t that stupid.

159
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:05,780
Fortress of the Forty-Eight is renowned.

160
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,080
Attacking it

161
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,670
without a cause

162
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:13,000
will raise condemnation.

163
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,350
I believe

164
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:15,670
he needs a proper excuse

165
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:17,250
at this point.

166
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,620
So

167
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:21,520
he’s trying to pin the abduction

168
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,110
on our Fortress,

169
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:24,350
portraying us as bandits.

170
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:26,050
Correct.

171
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:27,300
That will justify

172
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,500
their raid.

173
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:34,980
You aren’t too dull.

174
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:53,980
Where is she?

175
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:55,130
She was here just now.

176
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,050
Go.

177
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:58,490
Take that way.

178
00:10:58,740 --> 00:10:59,660
Yes.

179
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:00,610
Let’s go.

180
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:01,810
Go!

181
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:04,740
Come!

182
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,450
Xie Meimei,

183
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:38,250
where do you think Yu Wenzhi will camp

184
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,930
as the Commander in Chief?

185
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:48,180
It should be easy to organize defense,

186
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,780
such as a walled-in enclosure.

187
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:54,530
Crowded dwellings
in the southwest are ruled out.

188
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:56,780
And

189
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:58,450
it should be at a convenient location

190
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:00,250
for supplies

191
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,580
and retreat.

192
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:06,220
The northwest leads to mountains

193
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,430
with blocked roads.

194
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:11,060
So that won’t be it.

195
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,910
If he isn’t in any of those places,

196
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,090
where exactly is he?

197
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:20,530
If you ask me.

198
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:22,450
the official’s residence in the east

199
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,100
ticks all the boxes.

200
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:26,300
Yu Wenzhi is most likely to be there.

201
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,490
What about the hostages?

202
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:30,450
Where are the civilians he captured?

203
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,420
Civilians?

204
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,100
There’s an ancestral hall

205
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,420
with enough space.

206
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,610
They’re probably kept there.

207
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:53,010
Fei, stick to the priority.

208
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:55,050
Track down Yu Wenzhi first.

209
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:57,340
I understand.

210
00:12:57,930 --> 00:12:59,500
But I can’t
turn a blind eye to the others.

211
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,050
Can you

212
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:04,490
check the ancestral hall

213
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:06,930
while we look for Yu Wenzhi?

214
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:08,100
Keep me updated.

215
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:08,710
Yes.

216
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,610
We haven’t recovered

217
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:24,690
from the huge loss

218
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:26,500
brought by the previous attack.

219
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:29,570
It’s too soon

220
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:31,220
to go back,

221
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:33,610
don’t you think?

222
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:36,450
Your troops are well-trained, Commander.

223
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:39,340
Why don’t you ask them

224
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:41,690
to finish the job?

225
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:44,050
Lord Shen,

226
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:46,220
your members have been there once.

227
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:48,900
They know that Fortress

228
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:51,690
better than my people,

229
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:53,990
hence the best fit
for the second attack.

230
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:03,420
Lord.

231
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,690
What’s up?

232
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:06,450
They’re out as expected.

233
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:08,860
What do we know?

234
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:10,610
I received a tip-off,

235
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:13,010
saying those of the Fortress

236
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:15,820
are out to capture you.

237
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:18,100
They’re highly skilled.

238
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,450
We must stay alert.

239
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:21,610
Commander,

240
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:24,080
security should be tightened.

241
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:26,570
No need.

242
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:29,050
Let them in.

243
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:30,090
What?

244
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,780
Let them in.

245
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:36,600
We can play along

246
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,070
and catch them once and for all.

247
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:42,450
Commander,

248
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:43,450
what do you say

249
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:45,930
about the deployment

250
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:48,870
of our forces?

251
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:54,930
You and your men

252
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:58,310
should lead the attack.

253
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:02,120
If you mean to preserve your strength,

254
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:06,160
I don’t think I can still trust you.

255
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,160
Alright.

256
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:13,420
If so,

257
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,340
I’ll attack

258
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:17,300
from Ximo River with my troops

259
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,300
while you take the gate.

260
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:21,860
They’ll be caught in the middle.

261
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:25,540
Deal.

262
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:28,100
Deal.

263
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,740
I’ve finally got them off my tail.

264
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:44,180
That was so close.

265
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:58,610
Let us out! Let us out!

266
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:00,220
Help!

267
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:02,930
Help!

268
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:05,810
-Let us out!
-Let us out!

269
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:07,660
Stop!

270
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,810
Let us out!

271
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:12,300
Let us out!

272
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,130
Enough!

273
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:19,450
-Let us out!
-Let us out!

274
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,660
Don’t look at them.

275
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,340
The dead can’t be brought back to life.

276
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,900
Focus on the living ones.

277
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:45,180
We must do something

278
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:46,420
or the town will be ruined

279
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:47,660
before we catch Yu Wenzhi.

280
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:51,540
Zhou Fei,

281
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,690
civilians are caged
in the ancestral hall.

282
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:54,690
And...

283
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:57,180
And some have been tortured.

284
00:16:57,930 --> 00:16:58,980
Fei,

285
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,860
calm down.

286
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,300
Don’t forget what we’re here for.

287
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,340
Saving them now

288
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:04,940
will only alert the enemies.

289
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:11,940
Yu Wenzhi,

290
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:14,850
I’ll find you, bastard!

291
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,580
Fei.

292
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,900
Change of plans.

293
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,540
Both Yu Wenzhi and the civilians

294
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:23,970
are important.

295
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,660
Let’s split up.

296
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:28,730
You guys

297
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:30,610
hide in houses near the ancestral hall.

298
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:31,180
People there know

299
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:32,660
you’re with the Fortress

300
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:33,960
and will surely help you.

301
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:36,650
Wait for my order.

302
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:39,540
Once Yu Wenzhi is captured,

303
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:41,060
get the civilians out

304
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,660
when you hear the whistle.

305
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:43,260
Yes.

306
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:44,730
Follow me.

307
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:45,560
-Yes.
-Yes.

308
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:51,300
Xie Meimei,

309
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,900
let’s go get Yu Wenzhi.

310
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:55,610
You’ve got the look

311
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:57,000
and the brain.

312
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:59,630
Knock it off!

313
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:06,370
I can’t help growing fond of you.

314
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:07,700
What to do?

315
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:09,660
Hold it.

316
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:20,260
(Tian’s Mansion)

317
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:25,210
Tianxian,

318
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:26,780
while I’m out,

319
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:28,330
you stay here.

320
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:29,580
Lord,

321
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,580
may I ask...?

322
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,700
I don’t believe

323
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,520
a word Yu Wenzhi says.

324
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:38,740
Stay with him in the name of protection.

325
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:42,540
Watch his every move.

326
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:44,710
Yes.

327
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:47,330
Pass my order.

328
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:50,780
We wait until Shen Tianshu

329
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:53,900
breaks into the Fortress.

330
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,850
Those inside

331
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:58,470
will flee to Ximo River.

332
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:02,490
Then we can attack

333
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:04,940
to reap what others have sown.

334
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,380
(Tian’s Mansion)

335
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:15,780
(Tian’s Mansion)

336
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,660
(Tian’s Mansion)

337
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:21,730
Xie Meimei.

338
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:23,180
Hey,

339
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,940
can you teach me Footwork?

340
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:26,820
It can be useful to me.

341
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,820
We’re going to need it

342
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:30,330
to seize Yu Wenzhi anyway.

343
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:34,940
The highest level of the Footwork

344
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,210
is about integration.

345
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:38,090
It’s untraceable and invisible.

346
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:40,900
First, imagine yourself
as the wind, water

347
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,540
and shadow.

348
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:44,580
That kind of skill

349
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,010
is usually practiced by assassins.

350
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:47,850
The South Blade

351
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:49,970
is too noble

352
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:51,780
to learn that skill.

353
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:54,060
All that is an excuse to turn me down.

354
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,210
Fine. I won’t force you.

355
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:33,300
Let go!

356
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,300
Hey,

357
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:50,540
what does Yu Wenzhi look like?

358
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,820
Why ask?

359
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:57,660
Do you want to be
a concubine in the palace?

360
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,160
I’m sorry.

361
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:21,250
That’s Yu Wenzhi.

362
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:27,250
He’s most concerned about his safety.

363
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:29,850
How come he’s out
with only a few guards?

364
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:39,660
Something is off.

365
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:53,940
Fei,

366
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:56,330
where are we?

367
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:58,210
At the foot of the mountain.

368
00:21:58,210 --> 00:21:59,420
Technically,

369
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:00,970
it still belongs to your Fortress

370
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:02,660
and houses tons of skilled members.

371
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:04,300
Were you the Commander in Chief,

372
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,180
would you

373
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:07,130
send all Demons away

374
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:08,580
and hang out in the street

375
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,310
with a few guards?

376
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,930
Yu Wenzhi is luring us out.

377
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:44,150
Fortress of the Forty-Eight

378
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:48,310
could only catch me in their dreams!

379
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:51,700
You’re wise, Commander,

380
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:53,420
by misleading them into thinking

381
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:55,400
you’re still at the base camp.

382
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:06,170
This place must be a trap.

383
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,540
We cannot rush in.

384
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:11,660
Fei,

385
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:13,420
get out of here with your men.

386
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:14,600
What do you mean?

387
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:16,720
What about the civilians

388
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:18,780
and that villain?

389
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:21,020
Are all your people trustworthy?

390
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:23,850
What makes you think
there are rats among us?

391
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:26,210
I don’t have the proof yet,

392
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:28,610
but I have a feeling in my guts.

393
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:30,300
Your guts tell you to trust no one?

394
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,420
Fei,

395
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:33,370
betting on trust is risky.

396
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:35,820
You could lose everything,

397
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:36,770
you know?

398
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:38,850
I know.

399
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:40,670
I can’t afford it.

400
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,580
Neither can I act

401
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:45,700
simply based on your hunch.

402
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:46,660
I don’t think

403
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:47,890
I can do that either.

404
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:50,580
Think about it.

405
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:51,940
If we leave now,

406
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:53,180
both the Fortress

407
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:54,780
and the civilians will be in danger.

408
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:56,550
All our efforts will be in vain.

409
00:23:58,540 --> 00:23:59,690
You have a point.

410
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:04,550
Hey,

411
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:06,480
I propose a compromise.

412
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:09,330
Let’s first get the civilians out.

413
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:11,460
That’ll probably mess up their plan.

414
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:12,420
In that case,

415
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:14,700
we can lie in wait

416
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,290
to catch Yu Wenzhi off guard.

417
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:18,630
Look,

418
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,540
we can split up.

419
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:22,300
I’ll distract those guards

420
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:24,410
while the rest of you
go rescue hostages.

421
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:26,680
Sure.

422
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:30,130
Protecting me is your only task.

423
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:33,420
What happened to Spinning Wire

424
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:34,940
cannot happen again.

425
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:41,700
You should know

426
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:45,490
which side you’re on.

427
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:11,460
Go, go, go!

428
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:12,780
(Ancestral Hall)
Thanks! Thank you!

429
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:13,140
(Ancestral Hall)

430
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:19,850
Don’t be scared.

431
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:21,900
We’re sent by the Fortress
of the Forty-Eight to save you.

432
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:22,900
Mother!

433
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:25,130
We’re safe now.

434
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:28,700
(Ancestral Hall)
Escort them to a safe place.

435
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:29,250
Yes.

436
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:31,540
(Ancestral Hall)
-Thanks. -Thank you so much.

437
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:33,260
(Ancestral Hall)

438
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:34,700
Let’s go.

439
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:53,240
Array!

440
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:55,610
-Array!
-Array!

441
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:58,820
Let’s go.

442
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,090
Strike again!

443
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:26,540
Kill them!

444
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:11,900
Who’s that?

445
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:15,210
Shen Tianshu.

446
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:17,540
Lord,

447
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:18,700
I’m sorry

448
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,110
that I failed to break in.

449
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:25,130
Change the position!

450
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:29,850
Now, you little cowards

451
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:32,970
are holing up in there.

452
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:36,010
Do you remember
what happened in Huarong?

453
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:39,420
Many were burned to death in the inn.

454
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:42,430
Although I saved one of your members,

455
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:46,250
you had him killed.

456
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:47,370
Eventually,

457
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:49,130
that old hen Wang died

458
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:51,460
to cover you.

459
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:53,310
Ms. Wang?

460
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:00,040
Didn’t you say

461
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:03,940
she and Chenfei

462
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:05,590
are on their way back?

463
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:22,180
They’ve passed away.

464
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:24,180
I’m sorry, Deng Zhen.

465
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:57,420
Do you expect me

466
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:59,930
to clean up your mess?

467
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:04,940
Deng Zhen!

468
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:19,460
Shen Tianshu,

469
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,970
I’ll kill you!

470
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:51,090
Guard the gate!

471
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:55,940
Yun Xiao,

472
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:58,010
retreat to Feihong Bridge!

473
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,180
Let’s go!

474
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:33,460
Open the gate!

475
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:35,970
Charge!

476
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:08,900
Let’s go!

477
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:11,850
Let’s go!

478
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:27,700
That brat

479
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,970
has got some skills.

480
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:32,330
Cover us!

481
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:33,490
Release the whistling arrow!

482
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:37,060
Be careful.

483
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:43,210
What’s going on?

484
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:47,370
Li Sheng and Deng Zhen failed.

485
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:05,660
Guard the Fortress.

486
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:08,250
Hang in there, Deng Zhen!

487
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:11,820
Leader,

488
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:13,250
I’m sorry.

489
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:16,940
Archers,

490
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:18,250
follow me.

491
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:24,180
I failed in my duty.

492
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:25,250
No,

493
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:26,180
Deng Zhen.

494
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:38,660
There was

495
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:41,900
a massacre in my village.

496
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,280
Ms. Wang

497
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:47,290
saved me

498
00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:49,330
and treated me

499
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:53,540
as her own grandson.

500
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:54,600
Otherwise,

501
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:57,940
I wouldn’t have

502
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:59,210
come here

503
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:03,190
and met all of you.

504
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:07,230
I’m lucky enough

505
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:09,630
to have you

506
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:13,820
as my sworn brother

507
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:15,820
and Ms. Wang as my grandmother.

508
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:17,180
My life is worth it.

509
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,610
Deng Zhen! Deng Zhen!

510
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:44,300
Shields!

511
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:49,460
Charge.

512
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:02,540
Stay in line.

513
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,330
Once the smoke is gone,

514
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:07,250
they’ll be exposed.

515
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:10,570
Li Sheng,

516
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:11,260
no arrows!

517
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:12,500
Escort Deng Zhen back for treatment.

518
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:14,610
Go back, all of you.

519
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,220
What about you?

520
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,220
We won’t leave you here alone.

521
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:18,330
-Listen to me.
-Yes.

522
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,610
That’s to protect the Fortress.

523
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:21,260
Go!

524
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,260
-Li Sheng!
-Go!

525
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,610
Leave!

526
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:24,980
Go back!

527
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:27,180
-Go!
-Li Sheng!

528
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,850
The first gate is the key.

529
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:30,740
Once we lose it,

530
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:32,530
Feihong Bridge is the next.

531
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:34,740
That should be

532
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:35,770
our second line of defense.

533
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:41,980
(Kerosene)

534
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:46,300
(Kerosene)

535
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:49,060
(Kerosene)

536
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:51,980
We can’t lose the second gate.

537
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:54,300
(Kerosene)

538
00:34:55,290 --> 00:34:56,420
Kerosene!

539
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:59,660
(Kerosene)

540
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:05,420
Line the bridge with kerosene.

541
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:06,850
Set it on fire

542
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:08,610
when necessary.

543
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:13,260
Go back!

544
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:14,020
Retreat!

545
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:15,330
Get out of here!

546
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:16,700
Go! Go!

547
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:35,740
-Retreat!
-Go!

548
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:57,570
Sheng!

549
00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:10,570
Let him be.

550
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,220
We can use some rest.

551
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:15,570
Stay alert.

552
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:18,570
Anything from Gu Tianxian?

553
00:36:18,570 --> 00:36:19,770
Yes.

554
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:21,220
Lord Gu said

555
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,980
Yu Wenzhi was quiet.

556
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:26,020
He didn’t go to the designated location.

557
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:31,500
Just as I expected.

558
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:37,570
Tell Ma Jili

559
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:39,850
to send more archers

560
00:36:39,850 --> 00:36:41,770
to the southeast, southwest

561
00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:43,090
and northwest posts.

562
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:44,050
-Yes.
-Yes.

563
00:36:44,810 --> 00:36:45,900
Zhao,

564
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:47,130
let me go out.

565
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:48,290
Report!

566
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:49,770
We’ve lost the first gate

567
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:52,020
and treated to the Feihong Bridge.

568
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:54,090
It’s time for me

569
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:55,500
to join the battle.

570
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:56,770
Fetch me my spear.

571
00:36:56,770 --> 00:36:57,770
Zhang,

572
00:36:57,770 --> 00:36:59,770
now isn’t the time to be hot-tempered.

573
00:36:59,770 --> 00:37:01,290
Other than the first gate,

574
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:03,610
we have people
at the Bridge and the inner gate.

575
00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:06,180
How long

576
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:09,020
can they hold?

577
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:10,530
The enemies have broken in

578
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:12,020
as if they’re unstoppable.

579
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:13,570
Yet you’re telling me to hide here.

580
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:15,810
Deng Zhen, Li Sheng and Yun Xiao

581
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:17,900
are our own members.

582
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,700
-Don’t you trust them?
-I...

583
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:21,900
If you leave for the front,

584
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:24,460
who will give the command?

585
00:37:48,370 --> 00:37:49,170
Fei,

586
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:51,810
do what you have to.

587
00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:52,770
The blade

588
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,090
is still in your hand.

589
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:08,500
Guys,

590
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:09,500
don’t you know

591
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,830
what we are here for?

592
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:17,270
That is to capture Yu Wenzhi alive.

593
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:20,290
Ignore what’s happening in the Fortress.

594
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:21,460
Think about it.

595
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:23,020
Our members

596
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:24,180
and Elders are all there.

597
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:26,110
Aren’t they stronger than us?

598
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:28,610
Hasn’t Shen Tianshu come before

599
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,670
and got kicked out?

600
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:34,090
That’s right.

601
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:36,610
Divide yourselves into three groups.

602
00:38:36,610 --> 00:38:39,370
Take the civilians to safe places

603
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:40,940
and protect them

604
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:43,610
until we repulse Yu Wenzhi
and Demons’ attacks.

605
00:38:43,610 --> 00:38:44,530
-Yes.
-Yes.

606
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:47,180
Follow me.

607
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:48,610
This way. Let’s go.

608
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:50,810
This way.

609
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:54,940
How’s the Fortress?

610
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:10,610
Sweetie,

611
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:11,770
where are you going?

612
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:13,220
I can join my elder brother

613
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:15,290
to kill bad people and protect everyone.

614
00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:18,290
You’re brave.

615
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:20,980
Can you promise me something?

616
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:22,570
Yes.

617
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:23,570
Come.

618
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:28,130
Sit.

619
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:29,420
Can you wait here?

620
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:30,810
Your brother will pick you up

621
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:32,500
once he wins the battle.

622
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:33,420
Alright.

623
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:34,220
From now on,

624
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:35,770
you should practice hard

625
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:38,260
to be a hero like him.

626
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:41,260
Why haven’t we heard anything?

627
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:43,020
How are they?

628
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:44,770
Have they

629
00:39:44,770 --> 00:39:46,810
all been killed?

630
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:49,090
What should we do?

631
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:52,900
We’re doomed this time,

632
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:55,090
aren’t we?

633
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:56,980
We won’t surrender no matter what.

634
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:58,610
If those bastards break in,

635
00:39:58,610 --> 00:40:01,420
I’ll kill them at all costs!

636
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:05,610
Yes. Kill them at all costs!

637
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:07,810
-Please bless us.
-Kill them at all costs!

638
00:40:07,810 --> 00:40:09,130
Calm down, everyone.

639
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:10,900
Attention, please.

640
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,370
Settle down.

641
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:13,940
Look,

642
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:16,420
others are outside
putting their lives on the line.

643
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:18,660
How could we go out

644
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:21,740
and distract them?

645
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:23,610
We’d only be a burden.

646
00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:26,740
-That’s right.
-She’s right.

647
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:33,610
Merciful Buddha.

648
00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:44,570
Fei,

649
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:46,610
are you giving Yu Wenzhi up?

650
00:40:51,810 --> 00:40:52,850
I see.

651
00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:55,900
You’ve driven the others away.

652
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:57,810
If there are moles among them,

653
00:40:57,810 --> 00:40:59,220
they’ll send wrong messages

654
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:00,330
to buy us more time.

655
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:04,180
We still have to try our best

656
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:05,560
to seize Yu Wenzhi.

657
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:08,290
Are there other ways

658
00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:09,610
to find him?

659
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:13,710
Given the chaos we’ve caused,

660
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:17,220
if my guess is correct,

661
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:18,980
he’ll

662
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:20,340
tighten the security.

663
00:41:21,330 --> 00:41:22,080
So

664
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:24,700
he should be somewhere

665
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:26,630
heavily guarded.

666
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:33,850
Commander,

667
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:35,850
they’ve got

668
00:41:35,850 --> 00:41:37,910
the civilians out.

669
00:41:40,810 --> 00:41:43,140
How come they didn’t rise to the bait?

670
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:44,900
I think

671
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:46,920
that’s only part of their plan.

672
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:57,330
I guess

673
00:41:57,610 --> 00:41:59,050
they must’ve known

674
00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:01,130
that I’m somewhere else.

675
00:42:03,610 --> 00:42:05,740
Get Tianxian back.

676
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:06,570
And

677
00:42:06,570 --> 00:42:09,120
tighten the security here

678
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:12,460
for my safety.

679
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:14,090
I’ll arrange the best members

680
00:42:14,090 --> 00:42:15,250
of Mingfeng to protect you.

681
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:27,270
Go south.

682
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:30,770
Hey,

683
00:42:30,770 --> 00:42:31,760
that’s north.

684
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:34,940
Just tell me left or right, can’t you?

685
00:42:45,330 --> 00:42:46,290
While we patrol,

686
00:42:46,290 --> 00:42:47,460
you take care of master,

687
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:47,980
understand?

688
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:48,770
(Stationery)
Yes.

689
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:49,700
Let’s go.

690
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:08,850
Our men

691
00:43:08,850 --> 00:43:10,980
have tightened the security here.

692
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:12,380
No one can get in.

693
00:43:13,570 --> 00:43:14,480
Good.

694
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:22,280
Anything about
the Fortress of the Forty-Eight?

695
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:25,840
Not yet.

696
00:43:26,610 --> 00:43:28,700
According to the spy sent previously,

697
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:30,180
the South Blade’s granddaughter Zhou Fei

698
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:33,220
is in charge of the squad outside.

699
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:34,740
And she’s

700
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:36,020
with a young man

701
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:38,220
whose footwork is excellent.

702
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:45,150
A young man with excellent footwork.

703
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:47,550
What’s wrong?

704
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:51,020
Nothing.

705
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:51,850
That reminds me

706
00:43:51,850 --> 00:43:53,670
of one of my old opponents.

707
00:43:55,530 --> 00:43:57,290
This seems

708
00:43:57,290 --> 00:43:59,290
to be the best-guarded place.

709
00:43:59,290 --> 00:44:02,770
I bet Yu Wenzhi has moved here.

710
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:17,500
Kou Dan must’ve had skilled members

711
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:19,850
of Mingfeng to protect him.

712
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:21,700
Fei,

713
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:22,610
stay calm.

714
00:44:22,610 --> 00:44:24,180
Let’s wait and see first.

715
00:44:56,980 --> 00:44:57,910
Where are you going?

716
00:44:59,810 --> 00:45:00,770
Sir,

717
00:45:00,770 --> 00:45:02,900
I’m going back to the village.

718
00:45:09,330 --> 00:45:10,200
Hold on.

719
00:45:11,610 --> 00:45:12,900
I’ve been told

720
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:14,330
that someone is
walking downhill sneakily.

721
00:45:14,330 --> 00:45:16,260
Speak! Where were you?

722
00:45:18,370 --> 00:45:19,840
I...

723
00:45:21,770 --> 00:45:22,580
I...

724
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:28,630
Stop!
