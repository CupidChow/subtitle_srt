Does anyone not suffer?

19
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,480
Those with great luck.

20
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:46,360
Only when their parents
have suffered for them

21
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:49,830
can they be born free.

22
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:52,870
It’s their luck accumulated
in the previous life.

23
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,510
Neither you nor I have such luck.

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,910
Your Highness! Your Highness!

25
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,550
Your Highness!

26
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:12,480
Your Highness, where are you?

27
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,390
Your Highness! Your Highness!

28
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,390
Your Highness!

29
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:22,390
Don’t be mischievous, Your Highness!

30
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,110
If you become a monk,

31
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:26,360
how can you take care of the court

32
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,960
of your family, Your Highness?

33
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,910
Your father,

34
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,080
and the late emperor...

35
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,000
They’re watching you in the heaven!

36
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,820
Come out, Your Highness!

37
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,000
Come out, Your Highness!

38
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,630
Finally, he’s tired

39
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,000
and he has stopped shouting.

40
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,720
I win, at last.

41
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:55,600

I’ve brought you some wild fruit
to moisten your throat.

43
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,160
Eunuch Wang?

44
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,960
I barely live with my emasculated body,

45
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,800
failing what His Majesty entrusted me.

46
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,440
I can’t be forgiven.

47
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,140
If you have pity on me,

48
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:24,190
-Eunuch Wang!
-do not make a tomb for me

49
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:26,800
in case of weakening my luck
after death.

50
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,750
-Please burn me into ashes,
-Eunuch Wang!

51
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,520
-and scatter it into the East Sea.
-Eunuch Wang, I know I was wrong!

52
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,160
In this way,

53
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,750
I can flow all the way north

54
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,080
-to my hometown.
-Eunuch Wang.

55
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:42,270
Eunuch Wang, I’m sorry!

56
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:44,440
I’ll no longer hide anymore.

57
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,680
Come out.

58
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:00,080
Don’t scare me.

59
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,080
Come over, okay?

60
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,320
Master, please save him.

61
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,880
Merciful Buddha.

62
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,760
All people suffer.

63
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:28,070
Hope he’ll get rid of misery.

64
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:39,720
Since then,

65
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,110
he has completely changed.

66
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:45,850
He worked attentively
on literature and martial arts.

67
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:15,110
We had thought

68
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:18,880
he wouldn’t come back
after he left Penglai.

69
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,070
Unexpectedly, we saw him
shortly after his leaving.

70
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:23,200
At that time,

71
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,210
he was poisoned with Bone-chilling.

72
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,040
If I knew it,

73
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,550
I would have allowed your master
to make you a monk.

74
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:38,720
Junior Master, don’t be sad.

75
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,350
I feel relaxed, instead.

76
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:45,480
I’m going to lock Bone-chilling
inside your body

77
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:48,200
with my force

78
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,320
so that you can live!

79
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,550
But promise me.

80
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:54,840
(Junior Master, Immortal of Penglai)
Do not use martial arts anymore!

81
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,200
No wonder

82
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,200
he always says

83
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,760
he lives with others’ sacrifices.

84
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:07,460
But he can’t decide anything

85
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:09,560
about this.

86
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:11,800
Miss.

87
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,850
We do need your help.

88
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:16,730
But...

89
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:19,570
After experiencing the most pain
and the most pleasure today,

90
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:21,410
you must be restless.

91
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:22,940
Why don’t you have some rest?

92
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,010
Anyway,

93
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:25,650
we’re not in a hurry for the moment.

94
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:34,730
Since I got out of the secret tunnel
of Mount Heng,

95
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:36,820
I’ve never met Yin Pei again.

96
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,340
According to you,

97
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:41,100
Yin Pei didn’t have
such fierce martial arts before.

98
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:44,730
Last time I met him,

99
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:46,340
he was in a sorry plight.

100
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:48,170
I don’t know why,

101
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:49,690
but when I met him this time,

102
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:51,540
he looked weird.

103
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,220
Speaking of martial arts,

104
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:00,290
some people practice for years

105
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:01,710
before they achieve something.

106
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:04,580
Some others take shortcuts.

107
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,060
But no matter what shortcut he takes,

108
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,070
he must pay a big price.

109
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:12,410
People risk if they want
to achieve something great.

110
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:15,620
Looks like he has a meteoric rise.

111
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:17,850
But he must have paid a lot

112
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:20,060
that no one can imagine.

113
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:21,940
In contrast,

114
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,690
making efforts

115
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:24,900
to practice martial arts carefully

116
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,220
can be the safest way.

117
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,250
But...

118
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:34,340
But what?

119
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,850
After hearing what you said,

120
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:45,220
I feel you had much grievance.

00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:05,010
It’s getting late.

124
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:06,250
Go to bed early.

125
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:10,250
It’s... It’s getting late?

126
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:15,660
Fine, then.

127
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,010
I’ll go to bed early.

128
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,130
Aren’t you going?

129
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:31,420
I want to stay alone for a bit longer.

130
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:34,900
All right.

131
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,340
I’m going to sleep, then.

132
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:58,180

Why do you read such useless books?

00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,610
You?

137

Where’s the girl always with you?

138
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:30,860
What are you coming for?

139
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:34,450
In the secret tunnel of Mount Heng,

140
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:37,340
you were nice to me.

141
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:39,180
I think

142
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,390
I should return something to you.

143
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:48,560
Scared of me?

144
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:50,180
I just feel

145
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:52,050
you’re different.

146
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:54,490
Oh, yes.

147
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:55,300
At that time,

148
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,450
I was a dog of Dragon Master.

149
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:59,100
To take revenge,

150
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,720
I used all dirty tricks.

151
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,100
I’m sorry

152
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:06,050
to have you see that.

153
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:07,900
Luckily, it’s over.

154
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,060
I’m the new master
of Four-guardian Mountain.

155
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,420
It’s Mr. Chongxiao’s whisk.

156
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,780
Why are you having it?

157
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:38,340
Chongxiao told me

158
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,860
he had taken in a young man.

159
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,980
The young man was very clever

160
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:44,180
and he learnt formations very quickly.

161
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:46,930
Unfortunately, he was from the Li family
of Fortress of the Forty-Eight

162
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:49,220
and he couldn’t be a disciple
of Qi School.

163
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,860
What a surprise!

164
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,100
You are

165
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,690
the favorite pupil

166
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:55,180
he always talked about.

167
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:57,490
Yes, it’s me.

168
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:59,300
Give the whisk back to me.

169
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,420
Stop!

170
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:21,250
Let go of him!

171
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:25,740
Looks like you have poor martial arts.

172
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:28,100
You must be studying on formations

173
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,130
instead of practicing martial arts,

174
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:30,900
just like Chongxiao!

175
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,010
In the end, you can’t even
protect yourself.

176
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:34,780
Mr. Yin.

177
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,660
Calm down.

178
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,490
Let go of him.

179
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,900
Chuchu, don’t worry about me.

180
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:50,830
All right.

181
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53,290
I’ll listen to you.

182
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,220
Chongxiao asked me

183
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,490
to give this to him.

184
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:58,280
Now, I’m giving it
to its rightful owner.

185
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,840
If something isn’t mine,

186
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,400
I don’t want it.

187
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:10,900
Sheng. Sheng.

188
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,300
Sheng.

189
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:30,340
Is your neck okay?

190
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:07,250
Master!

191
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:14,220
Master, he’s in a critical condition.

192
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:16,180
Can we really do nothing to help?

193
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:22,130
Bone-chilling is the No.1 poison.

194
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:24,450
Since the day he was poisoned,

195
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:29,250
we’ve been working on the solution.

196
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:32,420
But we’ve got nothing yet.

197
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:36,420
People make poison

198
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,930
with something!

199
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:40,660
Pathetic Clam who poisoned him
has been missing.

200
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:43,130
I’ll go find her master.

201
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:44,780
If her master is also dead,

202
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:46,690
I’ll go find her sect.

203
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:48,340
I don’t believe she made the poison

204
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,860
out of nothing!

205
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:54,220
You’re right.

206
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,610
Bone-chilling is made of something.

207
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:58,130
Something great.

208
00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:00,570
After checking some uncertain records,

209
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:03,420
I knew Bone-chilling was the No.1 poison

210
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,690
in the Book of Almighty Medicine
of Big Medicine Valley.

211
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:10,740
If we can find this book,

212
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:15,100
we may find the formula
for the antidote.

213
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:18,130
Who has the book?

214
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:19,540
Where can I find it?

215
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:24,690
I’m afraid

216
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:28,010
this book no longer exists.

217
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,220
What?

218
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:54,540
What are you doing?

219
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:57,810
Excuse me.

220
00:16:57,810 --> 00:16:58,570
Did you see a girl

221
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:00,250
like this?

222
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:02,570
She’s this tall,

223
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:04,420
carrying a blade behind her back.

224
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,700
She’s beautiful,

225
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:08,370
but tough-looking.

226
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:09,850
No. I didn’t see her.

227
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:11,430
Thank you.

228
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:15,850
You can’t find Zhou Fei in this way.

229
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,250
You’re not worried, but I am!

230
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:20,250
You don’t know how strictly
she keeps her promise.

231
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:21,780
We agreed to meet.

232
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,730
If she were safe, she would have come.

233
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:24,580
But she hasn’t come.

234
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:26,010
Could she be in danger?

235
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:28,370
No! She’s not like you.

236
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:30,580
She has great martial arts
and she’s fierce.

237
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:33,900
There’s a saying that people can
always land on their feet.

238
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,210
I’m sure she’s alright.

239
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:37,300
What do you mean she’s not like me?

240
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,730
At the Demon-Extermination Assembly,

241
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:40,210
the condition was so dangerous!

242
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:41,610
There’re so many bad men

243
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:42,660
and they’re treacherous.

244
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,780
Did she run into bad men?

245
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:48,010
No. People with you are sly.

246
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:50,300
What are you talking about?
Go look for her!

247
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,460
It’s a long story.

248
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:58,180
Lyu Run wrote

249
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:00,130
the Book of Almighty Medicine.

250
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:02,490
He was a great talent.

251
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:06,820
He spent his life writing this book

252
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:09,210
with all his poisoning skills
and medical skills.

253
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:12,330
It’s the treasure
of Big Medicine Valley.

254
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:13,820
Unfortunately,

255
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:18,060
it was ruined in that calamity.

256
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:21,080
We must reap what we have sown.

257
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,660
There’s karma for everything.

258
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:27,060
It’s not your fault.

259
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,850
It’s Anzhi’s fate.

260
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:31,210
He shouldn’t suffer it.

261
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:34,090
I don’t accept such karma.

262
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:36,370
Look at you.

263
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:39,490
You were so sad.

264
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:41,210
You’ve calmed down so quickly?

265
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:47,730
Since you try to help,

266
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:49,610
there must be hope.

267
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:54,540
Or you wouldn’t have told me so much.

268
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:55,700
Right?

269
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:58,130
You’re a pure girl.

270
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:00,580
But you aren’t greedy,

271
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:02,090
angry or crazy.

272
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:06,060
You flatter me, Master.

273
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:07,660
I’m just not greedy

274
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:09,580
for the same thing

275
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:11,490
others want.

276
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,850
He always says he isn’t lucky.

277
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:20,820
But I...

278
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:23,210
I don’t think so.

279
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,580
Master.

280
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:29,610
You made a detour.

281
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:31,300
Now, you should tell me

282
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,300
what you want me to do?

283
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,300
Within the next few days,

284
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:40,330
I will take Anzhi back to Penglai.

285
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:43,370
To save him,

286
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:45,780
I must use Three-kind Decoction

287
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,730
to keep him alive for the moment.

288
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:49,660
Three-kind Decoction?

289
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:54,420
There are three doses.

290
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:58,300
I’ve been travelling around these years,

291
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:02,250
just to find the treasure
warding off the cold.

292
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:05,250
Now, I’ve made the first dose.

293
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:07,420
After he’s taken back to Penglai,

294
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:09,010
I’ll feed him with it.

295
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:12,610
It will keep his heart
from being frozen.

296
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:18,250
If he can take the last two doses
within three months,

297
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,940
maybe he could wake up.

298
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:24,580
But we need the hottest poison

299
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:26,660
to fight Bone-chilling.

300
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:30,090
This is extremely elusive.

301
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:33,090
I wonder if you can find it.

302
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:35,460
We can only leave it to luck.

303
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:37,580
Will he be alright
after taking the Decoction?

304
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:39,420
Three-kind Decoction

305
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:41,460
is a temporary medical relief.

306
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:43,330
I really don’t have enough knowledge.

307
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:44,610
After reviewing all medical books,

308
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:46,970
I’ve got the only temporary solution.

309
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,130
After taking the Three-kind Decoction...

310
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:50,250
I see.

311
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:52,730
Master, just tell me

312
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:55,370
where I can find these treasures
warding off the cold?

313
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,580
As estimated,

314
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:01,370
the Fire Lotus in the northwestern
extremely cold place

315
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:03,540
is going to blossom soon.

316
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:05,730
It’s a decennial chance.

317
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:08,180
A lotus has nine flowers.

318
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:12,490
When nine flowers all blossom,
it’s the best time to pick the lotus.

319
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:13,540
If you miss it,

320
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:15,610
you’ll wait for another decade.

321
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:19,130
It depends on whether you can
get it in time.

322
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,460
I will get it back.

323
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:32,370
Ask him to wait for me.

324
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:35,300
Girl.

325
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:37,820
Have you thought about it?

326
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:40,370
Even when you travel
throughout the world,

327
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:43,370
you may not find it.

328
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:46,210
You’ll get nothing at last.

329
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:56,940
I walked, carrying him on my back.

330
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:58,970
At that time,

331
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:01,820
I thought he was dead.

332
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:04,780
I was desperate.

333
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:11,130
But...

334
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:13,700
Now I know a way to save him.

335
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,700
It’s hard.

336
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,330
But there’s hope,

337
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:18,610
isn’t there?

338
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:23,900
It’s really sensible of you.

339
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:26,300
Girl.

340
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:29,090
Go and see Anzhi.

341
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:34,660
No.

342
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:37,730
I’ll come back and see him
after I get the Fire Lotus.

343
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,580
Oh...

344
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,540
You forgot this.

345
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:05,940
So many people risked their lives

346
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:07,610
to snatch it.

347
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:08,660
But look at you.

348
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:10,300
You dumped it by the roadside

349
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,820
and even forgot it.

350
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:15,420
It’ll be a burden when I travel.

351
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:16,940
Keep it for me.

352
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:18,360
I’ll come and get it when I remember.

353
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:36,020
The young girl is really extraordinary.

354
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:12,610
Weird.

355
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:13,900
Didn’t he just die?

356
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:16,060
Why is he like an ice cube so quickly?

357
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,580
Mr. Xie.

358
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:33,090
When you were alive,

359
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:34,300
I failed to save you.

360
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,420
Now you’re dead.

361
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:37,300
I’ll use your body
to study on Bone-chilling,

362
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,940
just like doing good deeds for you.

363
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:41,370
You won’t blame me, huh?

364
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:43,540
If you don’t reply,

365
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:45,060
I’ll take it as a yes.

366
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:51,060
Merciful Buddha.

367
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:59,090
Master, don’t get me wrong.

368
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:00,700
Young man.

369
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:04,780
I’d like to take care
of my own disciple.

370
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:09,250
You can even take care of a dead man?

371
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:14,630
He isn’t dead?

372
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,970
Yan, it’s such a desolate place

373
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:30,180
and no other people come around.

374
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,090
Shall we go back first?

375
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:32,820
Go if you want it!

376
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,370
How can I leave you alone?

377
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:35,420
You have poor martial arts...

378
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:37,780
Poor what?

379
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:40,130
No... Nothing.

380
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:41,420
I mean.

381
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:43,330
I don’t know how
to explain to your brother.

382
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:44,700
None of your business!

383
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,370
I don’t need you
to explain to my brother, either.

384
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:48,580
He stays in the inn,

385
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,580
waiting for Fei.

386
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:50,210
He doesn’t even think about it.

387
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:52,330
What if Fei met the Demons?

388
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:54,010
You heartless men!

389
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:54,830
Go over there.

390
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:58,250
It hurts!

391
00:25:58,250 --> 00:25:59,210
I’m sorry! I’m sorry!

392
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:00,780
I didn’t mean it!

393
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:03,730
The handkerchief. Take it.

394
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,610
I wonder how Fei is doing.

395
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:07,730
If she meets the Demons,

396
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:09,900
is it bad luck for her or the Demons?

397
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,850
Fei has better martial arts than us.

398
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:13,090
So what?

399
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:15,460
No one helps if she’s in danger.

400
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:18,490
I must find her.

401
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:20,010
Or I won’t go back.

402
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:27,300
Why is there a man?

403
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,300
Ying Hecong?

404
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,730
Why is he up here?

405
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:43,010
Go lift him.

406
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:43,730
Okay.

407
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:04,970
Sheng, don’t worry too much for Fei.

408
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:07,370
She’s a clever girl
with great martial arts.

409
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:08,440
She’ll be alright.

410
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:13,580
I worry about her?

411
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:16,300
It’s been over a year
since she came down the mountain.

412
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:19,130
She’s been much crafty.

413
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:20,210
Besides,

414
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:21,850
very few martial artists

415
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:22,970
can defeat her.

416
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:24,490
Even fewer men

417
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:26,090
can deceive her.

418
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:29,330
Xie Yun is also staying

419
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:30,580
with her.

420
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:32,210
She’s showing mercy
when she doesn’t bully others.

421
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:36,300
You’re right.

422
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:38,330
Yan has gone to look for Fei
early this morning.

423
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:40,180
She hasn’t come back yet.

424
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:43,580
You don’t look worried at all?

425
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:47,540
Yan is still young.

426
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:49,460
After experiencing so much,

427
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:51,900
maybe she hasn’t recovered yet.

428
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:53,210
But at least,

429
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:55,010
she began to understand

430
00:27:55,010 --> 00:27:56,540
how evil people were.

431
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:09,540
You’re worried about Mr. Chongxiao?

432
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:14,900
He always takes the whisk with him.

433
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,480
Yin Pei shouldn’t have got it easily

434
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:20,540
even if he stole it.

435
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:22,300
What do we do?

436
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:30,180
Sheng! Chuchu.

437
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:32,380
Come and check on Ying Hecong.

438
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:41,580
(Lingling)

439
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:44,780
(Lingling Inn)

440
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:50,300
Wake up. Wake up!

441
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:57,780
What are you doing?

442
00:28:58,090 --> 00:29:00,130
What are you asking?

443
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:02,130
I got you back!

444
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:05,130
Tell me. Why did you pass out?

445
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:06,210
Who knocked you out?

446
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:08,420
After the Demon-Extermination Assembly,

447
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:09,970
why did you leave without telling us?

448
00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:11,090
Did you go personally

449
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:13,010
or did anyone kidnap you?

450
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:15,850
Yan, don’t be anxious.

451
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:18,180
Yeah, calm down. Let him relax.

452
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:20,250
Maybe he’s silly
after being knocked out.

453
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:21,300
You’re silly!

454
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:22,900
See? He’s silly.

455
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:23,660
I...

456
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:25,090
Tell us. Tell us.

457
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:26,090
Did you see Fei?

458
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:27,610
Did you see Mr. Xie?

459
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:29,180
No.

460
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:32,900
I left early.

461
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,010
Alone.

462
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:36,490
That’s weird.

463
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:38,010
Who knocked you out?

464
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:42,540
You were strong, weren’t you?

465
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:46,460
Fine, stop asking.

466
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:47,540
Maybe he met someone

467
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:49,210
he didn’t want to tell us.

468
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:51,780
Yan, don’t push him.

469
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:54,700
Why can’t he tell us?

470
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:58,540
Are you a confederate of the Demons?

471
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:00,660
You are their confederate!

472
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:01,900
Could you stop bothering me?

473
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,420
Zhou Fei is alright. She’s a tough girl.

474
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:05,010
Don’t worry.

475
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:06,370
Didn’t you just say

476
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:07,900
you met neither of them?

477
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:11,900
How do you know she’s alright?

478
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:18,900
Oh, you lied to me!

479
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:21,970
I just want to have some snake soup.

480
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:22,540
I’ll smash it. Don’t you believe?

481
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:23,540
Don’t. Don’t. I’ll tell you.

482
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:25,090
I met your cousin and her man
in the forest.

483
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:26,700
They fought Chu Tianyu.

484
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,300
She met the Demons?

485
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,370
Was she hurt?

486
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:31,940
Chu Tianyu is dead.

487
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:33,940
Zhou Fei is alright. She’s safe.

488
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:38,730
How did she kill Chu Tianyu?

489
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:39,330
She didn’t do it alone.

490
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:41,660
Xie Yun was there. I helped, too.

491
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:42,700
This doesn’t matter.

492
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:43,660
Stop crowding in on me.

493
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:44,300
Go, go, go away.

494
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,700
Just tell me.

495
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:47,130
Stop crowding in on me!

496
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:50,180
Just tell me! I’m so curious!

497
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:51,660
Go, go, go away.

498
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:53,180
Did Zhou Fei use any new martial art?

499
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:55,130
She didn’t. Stop asking...

500
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:56,730
-Tell me. Tell me.
-How is she?

501
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:57,780
How did she kill Chu Tianyu, then?

502
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:59,370
-Give me some space, will you?
-Tell me!

503
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:00,540
Go away!

504
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:45,940

(Animal characters made by CG)

506
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:27,330
Leave such a small thing
to your servants.

507
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:29,730
Why do you need to do it personally?

508
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:31,970
Servants can’t do this well.

509
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:35,090
Back in Big Medicine Valley,

no one could grow

511
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:38,970
this plant.

512
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:42,610
(Animal characters made by CG)
I had studied on it for a dozen years

513
00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:44,120
(Animal characters made by CG)

514
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:46,130
before I finally naturalized it.

515
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,900
(Animal characters made by CG)

516
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:53,100
(Animal characters made by CG)

517
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:01,700
Madam.

518
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:02,540
Waiter.

519
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:04,970
Did you see Mr. Li leaving this morning?

520
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:06,580
I came down early this morning,

521
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:08,330
but saw no one out.

522
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:09,900
Where has he gone?

523
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:11,330
Don’t worry, Miss.

524
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:12,780
Maybe he’s gone out so early

525
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:13,970
that I didn’t see him.

526
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:16,090
Perhaps he’s coming back soon.

527
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:20,180
Chuchu.

528
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:27,010
Chuchu, where are you going?

529
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:29,490
Yan, did you see your brother?

530
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:31,940
My brother? What did he do again?

531
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:33,730
I looked for him, but he’s gone.

532
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:35,250
His belongings are gone, too.

533
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:39,250
Has he left without telling us again?

534
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:42,730
He looked weird yesterday.

535
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:43,820
He stared at the whisk

536
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:45,330
and told me he worried
about Mr. Chongxiao.

537
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:48,460
I guess he has left
to look for Mr. Chongxiao.

538
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:50,330
Well, I must go and find him.

539
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:51,660
Chuchu.

540
00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:53,460
It’s too dangerous out there.

541
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:54,820
You can’t go out.

542
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:58,610
Yan, your brother kept protecting me.

543
00:33:58,610 --> 00:33:59,780
Now he’s in danger.

544
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:01,490
I must get over it with him.

545
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:04,540
Moreover, he’s likely to run into...

546
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:08,850
Yan.

547
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:10,370
Wait here until we come back.

548
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:11,770
I know the location.

549
00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:13,130
I think I’ll find him.

550
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:21,940
Who will my brother run into?

551
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:34,130
Master.

552
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:35,770
Miss Wu you asked us to keep an eye on

553
00:34:35,770 --> 00:34:37,290
has left the inn.

554
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:39,900
Is she really going back
to the Fortress of the Forty-Eight

555
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,370
with Li Sheng?

556
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:45,260
She left alone.

557
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:47,940
Alone?

558
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:51,090
She doesn’t even have martial arts.

559
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:53,020
How will she travel alone?

560
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:55,460
Our men saw that clearly.

561
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:56,130
But looks like

562
00:34:56,130 --> 00:34:58,500
she isn’t heading
for the Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

563
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,740
Ask our men to follow her closely.

564
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:01,290
Get me a horse. I’ll be right there.

565
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:02,130
Aye.

566
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:09,100
(Wu Chuchu)

567
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:16,290
Without the eunuch,

568
00:35:16,290 --> 00:35:18,420
flowers blossom more beautifully.

569
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:20,130
Do you think so?

570
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:22,530
They do?

571
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,610
When you’re in front of me,

572
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:28,260
I’ve never paid any attention
to other flowers.

573
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:30,220
Don’t interrupt.

574
00:35:30,770 --> 00:35:32,700
You know what I mean.

575
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:36,610
You used others to kill Chu Tianyu.

576
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:39,980
Even commander-in-chief can’t
have anything on you.

577
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:41,980
You get me wrong.

578
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:45,020
I didn’t use others to kill Chu Tianyu.

579
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:47,330
I tried to kill two birds
with one stone.

580
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:51,370
If I had wanted to kill Chu Tianyu,

581
00:35:51,370 --> 00:35:53,420
he would have been dead long ago.

582
00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:55,770
I kept him alive,

583
00:35:56,130 --> 00:35:58,740
as a bait for someone else.

584
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:04,290
Sorry to have made you aggrieved.

585
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:06,980
You mean

586
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:09,130
the Color of Ocean and Heaven?

587
00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:13,020
If I guess correctly,

588
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:17,610
the Color of Ocean and Heaven
will come out soon.

589
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:28,610
Your old wound can’t
be delayed anymore.

590
00:36:28,610 --> 00:36:30,130
We must open
the Color of Ocean and Heaven asap

591
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:31,570
and find the Book of Almighty Medicine

592
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:33,020
to heal you.

593
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:40,420
You’re so good at making me happy.

594
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:46,530
If the rumor is right

595
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:49,420
that someone used
the Cloud-impelling Palm again,

596
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:51,570
I’m sure

597
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:52,530
I can help you find the girl

598
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:54,940
who took away the Seal of Cautiousness.

599
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,770
You always stay indoors,

600
00:36:57,770 --> 00:36:59,570
but you’re well-informed.

601
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:03,700
I poisoned Xiao Chuan

602
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:06,290
with Bone-chilling.

603
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:08,980
He used martial arts recklessly.

604
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:10,700
He’ll die soon.

605
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:13,700
If he wants to survive,

606
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:15,850
he needs the hottest poison

607
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:17,180
to fight against Bone-chilling.

608
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:21,180
It’s a decennial chance
for the Fire Lotus to blossom.

609
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:23,420
I guess the girl is on her way

610
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:25,740
to pick the Fire Lotus.

611
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:30,020
Tianying.

612
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:32,050
It’s so clever of you.

613
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:34,700
You’re as useful as a thousand soldiers.

614
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:38,290
Since so,

615
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:39,660
I’ll go personally.

616
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:40,940
No!

617
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,460
You nearly went wrong
when practicing martial arts.

618
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:45,570
And you were wounded
in the Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

619
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,050
You can’t go.

620
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:49,740
Zhou Fei can already use
the Snow-breaking Blade

621
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:51,260
in a strong way.

622
00:37:52,290 --> 00:37:53,610
I don’t think

623
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,500
others can deal with her.

624
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:02,180
Ask Tiankuang to go.

625
00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:05,090
No way.

626
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:07,180
I said

627
00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:10,020
Lu Tiankuang would only be responsible
for your own safety.

628
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:11,770
It’s not time

629
00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:14,770
to give him any mission.

630
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:17,740
The Color of Ocean and Heaven
has been hidden for a dozen years.

631
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:20,220
It’s finally coming out.

632
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:21,850
I don’t want to miss it.

633
00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:22,610
But...

634
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:25,370
Tiankuang came from the cold place.

635
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:26,610
I don’t think Zhou Fei can defeat him

636
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:28,130
on the snow mountain.

637
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:31,460
You make sense.

638
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:32,980
Before coming to us,

639
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:35,290
he was known as Snow Wolf.

640
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:01,900
Dried tangerine peel.

641
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:05,530
Ginger.

642
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:09,460
Medlar. Red dates.

643
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:13,460
What else in the prescription
against the cold?

644
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:15,740
Ginger, red dates and medlar

645
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:17,260
can detoxify Bone-chilling?

646
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:18,940
Stop kidding!

647
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,090
Give the medical book back to me.

648
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:21,220
No! No!

649
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:22,130
You don’t look for the antidote for him.

650
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:23,850
Why can’t I do it?

651
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:25,370
You don’t even let me review the book?

652
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:28,420
Before you find the antidote,

653
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:31,330
Mr. Xie may be reincarnated a few times.

654
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:33,090
What are you talking about?

655
00:39:33,090 --> 00:39:34,180
He’s still alive.

656
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:35,740
Does any doctor give up on him like you?

657
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:36,810
Go away. Don’t disturb me.

658
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:40,940
What are you doing?

659
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:42,900
Looking for the antidote for Mr. Xie.

660
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:44,570
But he gave up on Mr. Xie.

661
00:39:45,570 --> 00:39:47,900
You’re the only heir
of Big Medicine Valley.

662
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:50,500
We all depend on you for the antidote.

663
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:51,700
You have poor medical skills, fine.

664
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:52,770
But why do you even give up?

665
00:39:52,770 --> 00:39:53,500
Anyway, I’m better than you,
the heir of Small Medicine Valley,

666
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,610
who know nothing about medicine.

667
00:39:55,850 --> 00:39:56,700
You!

668
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:03,530
Besides, Big Medicine Valley is gone.

669
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:10,700
Give Hongyu to me
and I’m leaving right away.

670
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:13,810
No way!

671
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:15,810
Fei is looking everywhere

672
00:40:15,810 --> 00:40:17,020
for the antidote to Bone-chilling.

673
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:18,260
Mr. Xie is dying.

674
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:19,810
You mustn’t go
until you find the antidote.

675
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:21,180
How many times have I told you?

676
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:22,700
I can’t make the antidote.

677
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:23,660
Give it to me.

678
00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:25,700
Leave if you want.

679
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:26,770
Hongyu will not go with you.

680
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:31,610
Fine.

681
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:34,130
Let’s see who Hongyu will follow.

682
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:47,260
What’s wrong with you?

683
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:49,260
We used to stay happily together.

684
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:51,020
Now Mr. Xie is dying.

685
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:52,370
Fei has left.

686
00:40:52,370 --> 00:40:54,570
My brother and Chuchu have left, too.

687
00:40:54,570 --> 00:40:57,530
Even you’re leaving.

688
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:04,570
Leave if you want.

689
00:41:04,570 --> 00:41:06,700
I’ll find the antidote for Mr. Xie
even if I do it alone.

690
00:41:17,370 --> 00:41:18,740
Do something.

691
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:20,900
Solve the trouble you made.

692
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:21,530
I...

693
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:23,500
I don’t know what to do.

694
00:41:28,290 --> 00:41:30,290
Stop... Stop crying, will you?

695
00:41:30,290 --> 00:41:32,180
No.

696
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:35,420
I won’t leave, all right?

697
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:38,020
Help me to find the antidote.

698
00:41:38,770 --> 00:41:40,900
I’ll... I’ll try my best.

699
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:42,220
Give Hongyu to me.

700
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:43,740
No way!

701
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:45,530
Don’t cry!

702
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:47,660
I saw the waiter coming back

703
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:49,020
with a few kilos of bullfrogs.

704
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:50,900
Hongyu... Hongyu will love them.

705
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:52,770
Well, go downstairs and have a look.

706
00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:54,850
Or other customers will eat them.

707
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:55,660
Really?

708
00:41:56,290 --> 00:41:57,500
Hongyu, let’s go.

709
00:42:03,330 --> 00:42:03,900
Is she

710
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:06,700
always like this?

711
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:34,820
(Liu Youliang, Anping Army)

712
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:41,570
-Miss.
-Waiter.

713
00:42:41,570 --> 00:42:43,530
I hear you have fresh bullfrogs.

714
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:44,700
You haven’t killed them, huh?

715
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:46,290
You’re so well-informed.

716
00:42:46,290 --> 00:42:47,420
They’re still alive.

717
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:49,330
Wait a minute. I’ll bring them to you.

718
00:42:49,330 --> 00:42:50,020
Okay.

719
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:53,980
(Animal characters made by CG)

720
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:56,660
Hongyu, you’ll enjoy the bullfrogs soon.

721
00:42:56,660 --> 00:43:01,060
(Animal characters made by CG)

722
00:43:34,090 --> 00:43:36,660
I asked Chu Tianyu to go

723
00:43:37,330 --> 00:43:40,220
so that he would confront
the Color of Ocean and Heaven.

724
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:42,810
We were ordered
to keep an eye on Chu Tianyu.

725
00:43:42,810 --> 00:43:43,940
We found that he asked his men

726
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:45,220
to stop an old man secretly,

727
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:45,980
named Liu Youliang.

728
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,580
(Lingling Inn)

729
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:55,770
Sir, are you hurt?

730
00:43:55,770 --> 00:43:57,340
-Are you alright?
-Piss off!

731
00:43:57,810 --> 00:43:58,770
Stay away from me!

732
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:01,770
Sir, don’t be so ungrateful.

733
00:44:01,770 --> 00:44:03,850
I just think your wound needs
to be dressed.

734
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:05,330
My friend is a great doctor.

735
00:44:05,330 --> 00:44:06,260
He’s right upstairs.

736
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:07,420
Let me take you up for a check.

737
00:44:10,370 --> 00:44:11,940
Shut up and sit down.

738
00:44:15,370 --> 00:44:18,220
How did you mess up with the Demons?

739
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:23,770
Cloud-impelling Palm
or Snow-breaking Blade don’t matter.

740
00:44:23,770 --> 00:44:25,570
Because their owners
don’t know the secret

741
00:44:25,570 --> 00:44:27,940
of the Color of Ocean and Heaven.

742
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:29,020
The key point

743
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:31,660
lies on Liu Youliang.

744
00:44:34,090 --> 00:44:35,850
How many of you? Come in, please.

745
00:44:35,850 --> 00:44:38,420
We’re looking for someone. Go away!

746
00:44:40,050 --> 00:44:41,290
Sit tight.

747
00:44:41,330 --> 00:44:42,530
If someone asks you about me,

748
00:44:42,530 --> 00:44:44,020
tell them you don’t know me.

749
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:48,860
(Animal characters made by CG)

750
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:49,850
Go find Ying Hecong.

751
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:53,180
(Animal characters made by CG)

752
00:44:54,290 --> 00:44:57,050
It’s okay. They’re my enemies, too.

753
00:44:57,050 --> 00:44:58,940
You’re their enemy.
You must be a nice man.

754
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:00,460
I will save you. Don’t worry.

755
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:16,610
What a surprise! You’re old.

756
00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:19,420
But you move fast.

757
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:20,610
To look for you,

758
00:45:20,610 --> 00:45:23,050
we ran throughout the whole town.

759
00:45:25,530 --> 00:45:26,810
Why did you stop?

760
00:45:26,810 --> 00:45:28,330
Too weak to keep running, huh?

761
00:45:29,770 --> 00:45:31,020
What are you talking about?

762
00:45:33,570 --> 00:45:36,570
You found a girl as your assistant?

763
00:45:37,770 --> 00:45:39,530
I’m not an assistant!

764
00:45:39,530 --> 00:45:41,770
Shame on you, Demons!

765
00:45:41,770 --> 00:45:43,090
In broad daylight,

766
00:45:43,130 --> 00:45:44,810
you bully an old man
with so many people!

767
00:45:44,810 --> 00:45:45,940
And you want to hurt a weak man!

768
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:47,460
If others know, don’t you feel ashamed?

769
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:50,130
Won’t you bring shame on Lord Shen?

770
00:45:50,130 --> 00:45:50,770
