Will your master also go to
Demon-Extermination Assembly?

18
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:37,590
Yes.

19
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,000
They’re close friends.

20
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,000
If your master is in danger,

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,910
he definitely won’t just stand by.

22
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:47,120
Where is your master?

23
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,550
I’ll take you there now.

24
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:51,270
Mr. Xie said that
you’re one of us.

25
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:53,190
Jiachen.

26
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:53,440
Yes.

27
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,680
Go inside to report first.

28
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:55,630
Yes.

29
00:01:58,230 --> 00:01:59,720
-This way, please.
-Okay.

30
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:05,950
Xie Meimei. Xie Meimei.

31
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:07,720
Why didn’t you go to
the southern border?

32
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,550
Why must you come to Lingling Town?

33
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:22,800
Miss Zhou.

34
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:24,110
What’s wrong?

35
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,000
It’s nothing.

36
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:31,240
Let’s go.

37
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,320
What are you looking at?

38
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:51,470
Thank you for saving my life.

39
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:54,320
I’m willing to be your servant
in my next life to repay your help.

40
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,320
Quit it, Qian Suiyou.

41
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,320
Save those useless fancy words
you learned from books to yourself.

42
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:03,440
Let me put it this way.

43
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,720
Thank you so much.

44
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,910
You saved me from my misery.

45
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:08,110
What you did was like

46
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,800
giving me a second life.

47
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:12,030
That’s more like it.

48
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,830
Last time I saw you,

49
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,630
you were so intimate with Miss Zhou.

50
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:18,350
Being with her is miserable now?

51
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:21,760
It’s always like this.

52
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,480
When they meet new people,
the old ones become unimportant.

53
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:27,350
Miss Lingyu,
haven’t you seen enough?

54
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:30,320
What a pity!

55
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,790
For what?

56
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:35,510
How could a nice man like you

57
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:37,550
get abandoned?

58
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:41,040
Not abandoned.

59
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:43,270
Fei is a nice girl.

60
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:45,640
I’m not worthy of her.

61
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,070
Why do you always dress up

62
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:49,830
like Qian Suiyou?

63
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:54,160
Yuyi Troupe has many ladies.

64
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,160
It’s inconvenient for
a young man like me

65
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,670
to come in and out.

66
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:59,600
It’s better to stay away from troubles.

67
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:03,440
And I have to say it again.

68
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,950
Thank you so much.

69
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:07,070
I’m willing to be your servant
in my next life to repay your help.

70
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:08,510
But today I have
important matters to attend to.

71
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:09,350
I have to say goodbye for now.

72
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,480
See you again in the future.

73
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,200
What?

74
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,000
What is he hiding from?

75
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:50,070
Xie Meimei,

76
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:54,230
deep in your heart,
you want her to come.

77
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,510
But when you see her,
you turn around and flee.

78
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:59,950
When she’s not after you, you...

79
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:02,830
This is hilarious.

80
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,880
I’m fine. I’m fine.

81
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,480
Sir.

82
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,230
You’re quite tough.

83
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:18,390
You don’t get hurt easily.

84
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,550
I’m fine.

85
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:26,880
Why did you get into the carriage?

86
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:29,110
Young girl.

87
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:31,440
You’re very impolite to the elders.

88
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,440
Excuse me.

89
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:42,070
Why are you afraid to look at me?

90
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:49,200
Why don’t you keep running?

91
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:53,160
How am I supposed to run
when you’re holding me?

92
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,550
So you indeed want to flee?

93
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:55,830
You sent those

94
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:57,720
Route Gang members?

95
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,390
Yes.

96
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,350
But it’s not easy to catch you.

97
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:02,790
It took Route Gang so long

98
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:04,480
before they could find you.

99
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,950
That’s pretty bad for their reputation.

100
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:07,950
But I’ve thought it through.

101
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:10,110
If this doesn’t work out,
I’ll go to Huo Liantao’s assembly

102
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:11,640
to find you.

103
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:13,110
How do you like that?

104
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,270
Did you know it was me the moment

105
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:19,390
I got in the carriage?

106
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:24,110
So you followed me all the way here.

107
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,230
Fei.

108
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:31,070
That broke the rules.

109
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:32,270
How about this?

110
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,920
Let’s do this again?

111
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,160
I haven’t seen you for days.

112
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,760
Why are you trying to fight me
the moment we meet?

113
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:15,880
Amazing.

114
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,550
You are playing Goose-breaking Blades
crazily.

115
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,440
Are you really this mad?

116
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:36,470
Fei.

117
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,550
How’s your injury?

118
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,520
You told me when you were
at Fortress of the Forty-Eight

119
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,030
that Bone-chilling is

120
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:58,080
the deadliest poison in the world.

121
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,150
Those who are poisoned

122
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:08,080
will start to chill from their bones.

123
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,440
When they die,

124
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,670
their whole body will be frozen.

125
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,840
How do you know that?

126
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,150
I’ve been traveling around the world.

127
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,320
Well...

128
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:23,760
Cut it out.

129
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:26,030
I won’t believe you anyway.

130
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:31,030
Maybe it’s because I’m knowledgeable.

131
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:33,670
I know all about
the world and its history.

132
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,440
The other day, I asked you
where you learned your martial art.

133
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,110
You hit my lethargy point.

134
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:41,280
You put me to sleep.

135
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,910
Why?

136
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,200
You were injured.

137
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,150
Fei.

138
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:50,000
You need to rest when you’re injured.

139
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,440
Why can’t you just let go of
those trivial questions?

140
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,520
You are always asking about
this and that.

141
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,350
No one can put up with that.

142
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:58,000
I had to put you to sleep.

143
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:12,550
Fortress of the Forty-Eight
is still recovering from the incident.

144
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,710
Why do you have time to

145
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,760
have fun at Lingling Town?

146
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:27,640
I haven’t seen my mom for a while.

147
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:32,200
I just met her briefly.

148
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,440
Then I sneaked out of the mountain.

149
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:36,200
I followed the ambiguous information

150
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,000
Route Gang has given me.

151
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:40,400
I pursued.

152
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:44,590
I searched.

153
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,000
How dare you say that

154
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,110
I’m here to have fun?

155
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,470
She came for me?

156
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,960
Of course, I came because of
the ripple-shaped object

157
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,350
on Huo Liantao’s invitation.

158
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:11,790
What do you think
I am here for?

159
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:22,000
No one was talking about the Color of
Ocean and Heaven a few months back.

160
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,280
But now so many forces

161
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,790
are after it.

162
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,880
Huo Liantao’s invitation is determined

163
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,910
to make every household
know about this.

164
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:34,440
Even the Demons know that

165
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,550
Fortress of the Forty-Eight
has two important objects.

166
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:37,880
If I don’t try to figure it out myself,

167
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,520
I will get dragged into

168
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,790
this mess anyway, won’t I?

169
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:45,440
Are you satisfied with this answer?

170
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,030
Fei.

171
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,640
I...

172
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:00,230
Tortoise Master comes!

173
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,440
Run!

174
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:28,180
(Ding Kui, Tortoise Master
of Four-guardian Mountain)

175
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:33,030
I already have one foot in the grave.

176
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:34,790
Why do I have to drag her down?

177
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:37,760
What?

178
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,200
Say it.

179
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:48,790
Look that way.

180
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:59,230
Tortoise Master
of the Four-guardian Mountain

181
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:01,230
made such a big entrance in town.

182
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:03,520
It seems that he’s here
to stir up trouble.

183
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:07,550
You know who Tortoise Master
of the Four-guardian Mountain is,

184
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:09,470
don’t you?

185
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,590
I know.

186
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,000
Of course, I do.

187
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,030
I not only know him,
but I’ve also beaten up

188
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,400
some of his pawns.

189
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,200
You!

190
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,110
You don’t always get into trouble.

191
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:24,150
But once you do,

192
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:25,670
you mess around with
those who’re big and mighty.

193
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:27,000
So what?

194
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,760
Just some of his pawns.

195
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,470
Do I have to make a report

196
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:31,000
in advance for beating them?

197
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,320
You!

198
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,590
You are...

199
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:46,200
You sneak attacked me in
Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

200
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:48,080
Now I sneak attacked you.

201
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,710
We’re even now.

202
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,960
What’s the use of these long legs?
Might as well cut them.

203
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:12,670
(Lingling Town)

204
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:13,520
Look.

205
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,080
This is Lingling Town.

206
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:38,030
Why did Ding Kui

207
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:40,520
rob my invitation?

208
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:44,560
The four masters of
Four-guardian Mountain.

209
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,030
Dragon Master, Zheng Luosheng,
is deceitful.

210
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:50,590
Phoenix Master, Mu Xiaoqiao,
is eccentric.

211
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:54,200
White Tiger Master, Feng Feihua,
can’t distinguish right or wrong.

212
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,640
Tortoise Master, Ding Kui,
is capricious.

213
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:59,200
Our Xingnan Sect is small and weak.

214
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,200
Of course, they’re going to pick on us.

215
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,910
He wants to find an invitation

216
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:04,950
and rightfully walks into
Demon-Extermination Assembly.

217
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,640
But I didn’t expect them

218
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,950
to make such a scene.

219
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:11,000
It seems that things are going to change

220
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,320
in Lingling Town.

221
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,910
Is that Zhou Fei?

222
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:26,950
That seems to be her.

223
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,350
What is she pushing?

224
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,800
Miss Zhou.

225
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,800
I picked up an old opera writer.

226
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,680
Zhou Fei.

227
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,560
Fei.

228
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,080
Where have you been?

229
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,880
Chuchu.

230
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,510
You came right on time.
Come help me.

231
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:47,510
Let me help you.

232
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:48,390
No need.

233
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:51,240
My cousin said no.

234
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,150
Well.

235
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,120
Sir.

236
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,680
Can we have one room, please?

237
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,440
Why is this old man so heavy?

238
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:30,440
Isn’t this Mr. Xie?

239
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,440
What’s going on?

240
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,390
What’s wrong with his face?

241
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,030
That’s a long story.

242
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,270
Fei.

243
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:42,350
Have you disabled him?

244
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:43,470
Li Yan.

245
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:44,950
Stay there.

246
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:46,200
Come back.

247
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:51,440
Why are you here?

248
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,560
No.

249
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,150
How did you escape?

250
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:54,510
I...

251
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:55,640
I don’t want to listen to your excuses.

252
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,680
You must find the secret service

253
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,000
and go back home immediately.

254
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,240
Go back to
Fortress of the Forty-Eight right now.

255
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:03,320
You’re her brother.

256
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,440
Can’t you be nicer to your own sister?

257
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,480
People from Fortress of the Forty-Eight

258
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,360
are all so mean.

259
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,800
Can’t you be gentler
to your own sisters?

260
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:16,320
Li Yan, you’re tough now.

261
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,200
You even have the full support of
those you’ve cheated.

262
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:20,990
-That’s enough.
-Bonehead.

263
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:22,030
In all these years of my life,

264
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:24,320
this is the first time
someone stood up for me.

265
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:27,030
Sheng.

266
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:30,230
I heard that Yuyi Troupe is
in Lingling Town.

267
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:31,150
Can you invite Madam Nichang

268
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,910
for me?

269
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,440
Sure. No problem.

270
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,320
What are you doing?

271
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,870
Go ahead.

272
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:18,460
(Huo’s Manor)

273
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:28,680
Our master said that

274
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:30,230
he won’t see any visitors today.

275
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:32,320
Go tell your Master Huo that

276
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,440
I know he has information about
the Color of Ocean and Heaven.

277
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,680
But the Demons have their eyes on him.

278
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:40,600
So he needs to find alliance
to fight against the Demons.

279
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:44,030
I, Ding Kui, want to put aside
the grudges and work with Master Huo.

280
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:45,870
Huo Family is respectable.

281
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:48,560
We won’t work with scums
from Four-guardian Mountain.

282
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,030
Bastard Ding.

283
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:53,320
You can’t go inside today
even if you kill me.

284
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,480
The trees behind this wall

285
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,560
are arranged according to
Qi Men Dun Jia Formation.

286
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,270
It was designed for our Master

287
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,360
by Chongxiaozi
from Qi School years before.

288
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:03,150
If you’re in it, you can never
come out of it in this life.

289
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,750
Great.

290
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,600
Go back and tell your Master Huo,

291
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,560
I’ll have my chance to kill him.

292
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,030
But this time…

293
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:19,910
Master, you want to
kill them all together?

294
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:21,030
Yes.

295
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:22,750
Let them kill each other.

296
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,600
I’ve planted kerosene in the formation

297
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,990
Chongxiaozi has set up.

298
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:30,960
When these martial artists step inside,

299
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,800
I’ll burn them all.

300
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:37,750
Great. Great.

301
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:46,200
Rumor has it that

302
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,560
Master Huo is stupid and reckless.

303
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:52,200
But it turns out that

304
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:55,390
you’re not so stupid after all.

305
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:21,870
Come out.

306
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,750
With you here,
the Color of Ocean and Heaven

307
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:33,960
already belongs to us,
Four-guardian Mountain.

308
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:38,480
Ding Kui, why are you

309
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,200
talking nonsense to yourself?

310
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,840
You and I can rule

311
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:43,990
Demon-Extermination Assembly.

312
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:45,270
No.

313
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:47,510
Mu Xiaoqiao.

314
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,910
I know Huo Changfeng has given you
a meal that saved your life.

315
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:53,630
But you risked your life for him
for years.

316
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:55,440
The debt has been paid.

317
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,990
Besides, the Huo’s Manor is
in a different person’s hand now.

318
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:00,390
Huo Liantao is a joke in the underworld.

319
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:03,110
Even so, are you still
trying to defend him?

320
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:05,560
That’s my own choice to make.

321
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,150
I’m here to give you a present.

322
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:20,440
This person ran out
when the old Huo’s Manor fell.

323
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,960
I happened to have caught him.

324
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,720
He knows many interesting affairs
about Huo’s Manor.

325
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,630
Phoenix Master,
why don’t you hear his story first

326
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:31,030
before you decide whether you’re going
to defend Huo Liantao

327
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:33,400
on Demon-Extermination Assembly or not?

328
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,110
Breeze lifted up the cloth.

329
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,750
Moonlight shined on the earth.

330
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:09,140
(Qinghui)

331
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,700
(Qinghui)

332
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:14,740
(Qinghui, the Immortal)

333
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:24,180
(Qinghui, the Immortal)

334
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:42,960
Master, this way.

335
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,870
Madam, you finally came.

336
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:56,840
Ever since I met you two kids,

337
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,030
I’ve never had an easy day.

338
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:01,600
Where is he?

339
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,750
He’s inside.

340
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:27,510
How come?

341
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:30,440
Madam, what’s wrong?

342
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:35,320
I’ve seen this poison before.

343
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,270
This is the deadliest poison
in the world.

344
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:42,010
Is this Bone-chilling?

345
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:48,080
How’s this possible?

346
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,910
Madam, is there anything we can do?

347
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:56,720
Reading from his pause,

348
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,390
I think he can still live a year or two

349
00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:00,630
if he doesn’t use his force.

350
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:02,150
I might not be the best doctor,

351
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:03,750
but I can tell that

352
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:06,960
his force is suppressing the poison.

353
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,390
If he doesn’t use the force,

354
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:10,510
he’ll be safe.

355
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:18,110
You must keep a close eye on him.

356
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:22,480
Madam!

357
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,270
Madam, there’s another thing that

358
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,480
I need your help with.

359
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,320
Master.

360
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:53,080
Master, I find it really odd.

361
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,600
This is the first time I’ve seen

362
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,230
to keep a man that way.

363
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:59,320
Hasn’t she realized that Mr. Xie
is avoiding her like she’s evil?

364
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:03,720
Maybe Qian Suiyou tried to
keep himself hidden from her

365
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,440
because his love for her is too strong.

366
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:08,680
That Tianmen Lock is a treasure itself.

367
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:11,080
Master, can we really give it

368
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,800
to others so casually?

369
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,440
What’s the use of us having it?

370
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,230
It’s just a piece of junk for us.

371
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:20,510
But for the lovers,

372
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,750
it’s the matchmaker’s red string of fate

373
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:25,630
which wealth can’t buy.

What are you here for?

395
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,800
That man wore this earlier.

396
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,270
You dropped it at the door.

397
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:08,440
I accidentally spilled tea on it.

398
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,680
The smoke of boiling tea
immediately dissipated.

399
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,560
Then I touched the hat.

400
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,270
The inside is freezing.

401
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:15,150
I want to see the man
who’s poisoned with Bone-chilling.

402
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,600
What Bone-chilling?

403
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:28,390
I’ve never heard of it.

404
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:30,150
Who are you?

405
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,510
My name is Ying Hecong.

406
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:33,990
I’m known as the Poisoner.

407
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,840
The man you carried into the hotel today

408
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,720
was poisoned with
Pathetic Clam’s Bone-chilling.

409
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,910
I can take a look at him for you.

410
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,870
Come in.

411
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:52,360
Thank you.

412
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,030
What are you doing?

413
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:46,320
This man’s days are numbered.

414
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,800
Listen. Bone-chilling can
freeze a man to death

415
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,630
in less than three months.

416
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:51,600
Isn’t that incredible?

417
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,360
It seems that
he was poisoned a month ago.

418
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,290
That’s weird.

419
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,440
Pathetic Clam had been missing

420
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,390
for years.

421
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:02,810
Who poisoned him?

422
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:04,280
A month?

423
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,440
What again?

424
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,360
How can this man have such strong force?

425
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,230
It’s too strong for a man of his age.

426
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:30,150
How did he do that?

427
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,870
How?

428
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:47,560
It still doesn’t make sense.

429
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:55,960
I see.

430
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:03,800
Soul-searching Needle.

431
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,840
Tanzhong point, Baihui point...

432
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,230
And...

433
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:12,630
And... And... And...

434
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,840
Fengfu point, Lingtai point,
Tianchuang point, Dazhui point.

435
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,390
Tianchuang point.

436
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:25,320
Look! This is the mark left
by Soul-searching Needle.

437
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,840
This silver needle itself

438
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,200
won’t leave a mark.

439
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,110
Even if you’re hit,

440
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:43,680
the wound should heal
in two or three days.

441
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:46,480
But those poisoned with Bone-chilling
have special health conditions.

442
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,870
Any small fracture would cause

443
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:49,080
the blood to clot under the skin.

444
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:51,320
And the clot will stay for months
because it’s frozen.

445
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,840
Marks left by Soul-searching Needle

446
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,320
will be even deeper.

447
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,480
Isn’t it true that
people will be energized again

448
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,030
for 45 minutes
after Soul-searching Needle?

449
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:04,990
You are right.

450
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,800
Soul-searching Needle.

451
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:19,110
I see.

452
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:20,390
The poison has been in him

453
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:21,750
for a long time.

454
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:22,750
But when he was poisoned,

455
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:24,480
someone put strong force

456
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,510
in him

457
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:27,440
to suppress the poison.

458
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,390
And they used secret methods
to seal his vessels.

459
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:32,270
Let me put it this way.

460
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:33,680
His vessels became

461
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,480
a prison.

462
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,560
Bone-chilling is the prisoner.

463
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,990
And the strong force is the guard.

464
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:39,870
As long as the guard
does its job diligently,

465
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:41,230
the prisoner can’t go anywhere.

466
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:42,510
But I don’t know

467
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:44,080
what’s wrong with him.

468
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,720
He pushed out Soul-searching Needle
with his force.

469
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,320
The vessels of those
poisoned with Bone-chilling

470
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,990
function very slowly.

471
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,990
So the effect of Soul-searching Needle

472
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:55,440
was slowed down.

473
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,750
Do you understand?

474
00:32:58,270 --> 00:33:01,230
Haven’t I explained everything clearly?

475
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:05,750
He told me that Fisherman recovered

476
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:08,630
because he ate
Big Medicine Valley’s Reborn Pill.

477
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:10,630
If I get Reborn Pill
from Big Medicine Valley,

478
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:12,510
can I help him recover?

479
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,080
For those who just get poisoned,

480
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,560
one Reborn Pill

481
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,390
and spending the rest of their lives

482
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:20,680
at a place that’s humid

483
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,870
are enough to make sure
they make into their 70s or 80s.

484
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:24,960
But... He... Well...

485
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,390
We don’t even know how long

486
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:28,320
he’s been living with Bone-chilling.

487
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,870
Bone-chilling is the seed.

488
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:32,320
It has long been planted and
has flourished inside his body.

489
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,440
Forget about Reborn Pill.

490
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,510
Even if you have two magic pills
from Lord Lao Zi,

491
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:36,320
you still can’t save him.

492
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,840
You can’t save him. You can’t.

493
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,720
You...

494
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,230
Haven’t you said that
you know how to save him?

495
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:43,980
There’s really no other way?

496
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,200
His life can’t be saved.

497
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,110
But...

498
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,200
Tell me.

499
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:53,910
If you want to make the rest of his time

500
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:54,910
more comfortable,

501
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:56,910
don’t let him eat any warm food.

502
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:59,360
It will cause the poison
to get stronger.

503
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,750
Most importantly,

504
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:03,200
he must not use his force anymore.

505
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,680
If he uses it one more time,

506
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,990
I can guarantee with my life that

507
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,600
he will be dead.

508
00:34:10,470 --> 00:34:12,230
You’re the Poisoner.

509
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:13,640
And this is all you can do?

510
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,670
That’s just a name they call me.

511
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:19,600
I only like to

512
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:22,270
collect all the poisons
in the world.

513
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:24,080
I don’t know how to treat patients.

514
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,320
How about this?

515
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,920
I’ll give you a snake.

516
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:51,950
Don’t be scared.

517
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:54,990
Calm down. Calm down.

518
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,750
Don’t be scared. It’s all right.

519
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,190
I came with good intentions.

520
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:13,920
Why did you hit me?

521
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,800
I won’t give you my snake anymore.

522
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:24,400
You repaid my kindness with enmity.

523
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:27,430
Oh! No!

524
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:30,080
I forgot to ask who poisoned him.

525
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,030
Maybe next time.

526
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,950
Who asked you to meddle with
my business?

527
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:36,840
When you were done with
meddling with my business,

528
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,640
you just turned around and ran away.

529
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,470
And you’re gonna die

530
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:41,490
in a corner where no one knows.

531
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,270
Do you think you’re a hero?

532
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:47,920
Do you think you’re a hero?

533
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,160
Aren’t you just touched by yourself?

534
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,710
Xie Yun.

535
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,320
Did you do this?

536
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,400
This lock is called Tianmen Lock.

537
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,750
The key has two layers.

538
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:11,190
The first layer is the cap.

539
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:12,430
A special way is needed to

540
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:14,160
open the cap.

541
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:16,160
When the cap is opened,

542
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,400
the keyhole can be seen.

543
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,320
So,

544
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,560
it’s impossible for Qian Suiyou
to break free.

545
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,030
Even if Li Zheng is
locked on one side

546
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:25,840
and Yin Wenlan is
locked on the other side,

547
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,750
without knowing the right method,

548
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:29,920
they’re never gonna
break free from this.

549
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,920
Thank you, Madam.

550
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:32,950
You’re welcome.

551
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:36,400
What on earth is this thing

552
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,360
Madam Nichang gave you?

553
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,160
What are you doing?

554
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:21,230
I’ll buy you a new one someday.

555
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:22,320
No, no, no!

556
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:25,160
How dare I?

557
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:27,670
I should be grateful

558
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:29,430
you didn’t draw the tortoise
on my face.

559
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:33,190
You don’t have other good qualities.

560
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:34,710
But, at least,
you know when to behave yourself.

561
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:40,320
Beauty... This...

562
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,840
Well.

563
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:49,230
How did you come up with

564
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:51,030
this new position?

565
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:54,470
At least, I’m a handsome guy.

566
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:56,560
When I go out like this,

567
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:59,190
I have to either
bend down or lift my leg.

568
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:01,230
When I use the bathroom,
I have to stand on one foot.

569
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:04,920
Well...

570
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,160
I mean...

571
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:09,600
Look at this.

572
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,560
I’m standing like
I’m kicking a shuttlecock.

573
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:13,270
Isn’t this hideous to look at?

574
00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:16,750
Blame Li Sheng for this.

575
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,670
Don’t tell anyone else.

576
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:26,950
Where should I chain him to?

577
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:33,160
Not to this bed, of course.

578
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:35,800
This bed can’t keep him chained.

579
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,400
How about locking him with you?

580
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,600
No.

581
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,320
He’s a man and you’re a woman.

582
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:42,990
It’s not convenient.

583
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:48,230
It’s indeed inconvenient.

584
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:03,840
Put the lock on his foot.

585
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:09,840
That one.

586
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:34,750
Perfect.

587
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,640
He escaped my notice for a moment.

588
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,470
And he just put
the other end of the lock

589
00:42:40,470 --> 00:42:41,800
on your wrist.

590
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:45,160
Otherwise,
I would’ve put it on your neck.

591
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:46,470
Then you don’t have to stand like this.

592
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:47,640
You can stand with your feet
in your mouth.

593
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:52,640
Fine.

594
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:54,670
You’ve grown up.

595
00:42:57,990 --> 00:43:00,990
As your master, I feel relieved.

596
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,270
I’m hungry.
Is there anything I can eat?

597
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:08,190
I spent a whole day
in the chase with you.

598
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:10,560
I haven’t had any water or food.

599
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:14,160
Sure. I’ll get you something to eat.

600
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:50,160
Sir.

601
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,800
From now on, the dishes for Mr. Xie

602
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,510
must be as light as possible.

603
00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:54,510
And the food must be cold,

604
00:43:54,510 --> 00:43:55,840
not even warm.

605
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,190
Miss, the weather is hot.

606
00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:00,670
But when the dishes are cold,

607
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:03,230
the taste will be bad.

608
00:44:03,230 --> 00:44:04,640
Just do as I say.

609
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:06,710
Thank you.

610
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,230
It’s better than losing your life
for this.

611
00:44:11,670 --> 00:44:14,710
Miss.
There’s a Mr. Yang in the backyard.

612
00:44:14,710 --> 00:44:15,920
He’s been waiting for you for a while.

613
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:19,360
Yang Jin?

614
00:44:46,670 --> 00:44:47,840
A contest is a contest.

615
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:49,400
Why are you cheating again?

616
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:50,640
Is this cheating?

617
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:51,320
Come on.

618
00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:52,400
Wait! Wait! Wait!

619
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:55,230
What?

620
00:44:55,750 --> 00:44:56,750
Are you scared?

621
00:44:58,030 --> 00:44:59,840
When Yang Jin

622
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:01,320
hears the word blade,

623
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:03,800
he’ll get so excited.

624
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:04,840
He will become

625
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:06,120
very gullible.

626
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,160
To get rid of him,

627
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:08,670
I need to trick him.

628
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:11,270
Do you know why I come to town?

629
00:45:11,270 --> 00:45:12,670
To joust.

630
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:15,080
No.

631
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:17,510
I came here for
the Color of Ocean and Heaven.

632
00:45:17,510 --> 00:45:18,600
What color?

633
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:21,120
The Color of Ocean and Heaven.

634
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:22,640
It’s a legacy.

635
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:25,640
It has collected the legacies
of the sects

636
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:27,360
that have fallen because of
natural or man-made disasters.

637
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:28,710
And…

638
00:45:28,990 --> 00:45:31,190
Have you heard of Reborn Pill?

639
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:33,080
It can boost people’s force.

640
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:34,190
Really?

641
00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:35,950
Of course, it’s true.
