Have a try.

18
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:42,340
Madam Li has given me

19
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:44,580
Mr. Li Zheng’s note of martial arts.

20
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:45,940
I’m going to compile the note

21
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:49,210
and give her
the Book of Snow-breaking Blade.

22
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:51,730
Snow-breaking Blade?
You want to learn it?

23
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:53,620
I don’t.

24
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,210
Madam Li said

25
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:56,730
when it’s compiled into a book,

26
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:57,980
it can be passed to others.

27
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:00,260
Whoever wants to learn it can learn it.

28
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:05,450
But Aunt looks weird lately.

29
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:07,530
Feels like she’s leaving everything

30
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:10,170
to us all at once.

31
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:12,340
I feel a bit worried.

32
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,090
Well, we’ve grown up.

33
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:16,900
Time to take over her responsibilities

34
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,900
so that she can have a good rest.

35
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,340
I hear Zhou Fei has gone

36
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:35,170
to handle the Third Prince.

37
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:37,620
You don’t need to worry.

38
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,810
Under such circumstances,

39
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:46,730
we can allow nothing to go wrong.

40
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:48,650
Tell them not to let down their guard.

41
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:49,900
Aye.

42
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,700
Also,

43
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:54,730
you asked me to gather intelligence
about the Demons.

44
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:55,730
What have you got?

45
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:57,530
We were just informed

46
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:00,010
that Yu Wenzhi visited the Demons Manor.

47
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:01,170
No one was in the Manor,

48
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:03,620
except Shen Tianshu.

49
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:07,810
Yu Wenzhi.

50
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:10,810
Why did he suddenly
visit the Demons Manor?

51
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,900
Have they already known

52
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:17,290
about the Color of Ocean and Heaven?

53
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,340
Madam, you don’t feel well.

54
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,290
Why don’t you have a rest first?

55
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:27,860
No rush to think of a solution now.

56
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,340
Okay.

57
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:27,170
Commander-in-chief.

58
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:29,220
We’ve been hunting down Zhou Yitang.

59
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,220
Seems like

60
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:33,340
he isn’t heading
for the Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

61
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,620
That’s not surprising.

62
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:39,500
If he took an established route,

63
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,130
you would have easily found him

64
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:43,250
on his way there.

65
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:47,380
He will certainly make a detour.

66
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:50,900
After getting rid of you,

67
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:53,220
he will head
for the Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

68
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,850
Shall we

69
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:57,730
get our men back first?

70
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:02,820
Ask them to search along the route

71
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,570
down the Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

72
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:08,540
Even if they can’t catch Zhou Yitang,

73
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,780
they can put pressure on him,

74
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:13,380
holding him back from going back home.

75
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:16,010
If Zhou Yitang goes back
to the Fortress of the Forty-Eight

76
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:18,730
before I get
the Color of Ocean and Heaven,

77
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:20,250
he will interfere
with Pathetic Clam’s action!

78
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:23,060
She’ll have trouble
framing Chen Zichen up!

79
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:28,170
Madam Li.

80
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:33,380
Shen Tianshu.

81
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:36,130
Give me the tokens

82
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:37,850
you’re holding.

83
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:41,010
Shen Tianshu, come out!

84
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:43,820
Don’t try to be mysterious!

85
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:46,380
Come out and fight me!

86
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:51,690
Don’t forget.

87
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:53,290
Your father

88
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:54,850
and your brother

89
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:58,170
were both killed by me.

90
00:05:58,170 --> 00:05:59,900
Do you think

91
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:02,660
you can defeat me?

92
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:10,970
Madam Li.

93
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:13,220
If you don’t give them to me,

94
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:15,250
I’ll kill

95
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,500
all you men.

96
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:19,900
Come out!

97
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:27,540
Li Jinrong.

98
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:29,820
Do you want all your men

99
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,520
to die for you?

100
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:52,380
Yitang?

101
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:55,900
Yitang, no... no way!

102
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,250
-Jinrong.
-Yitang!

103
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,220
Jinrong, listen to me.

104
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,290
No!

105
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:02,250
Put away the tokens.

106
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:05,900
Don’t show them to anyone.

107
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:14,010
Yitang, no! No!

108
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:16,690
No! No!

109
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:30,220
Madam, what happened?

110
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:46,220
I had a bad dream.

111
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,060
It was a dream.

112
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:54,850
It’s okay.

113
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:02,940
What happened? Tell me.

114
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:08,450
Our secret service caught a furtive spy

115
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:10,690
down the mountain.

116
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:14,940
He said he came...

117
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,220
What did he say?

118
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:22,220
He came to hunt down Lord Gantang.

119
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:25,620
Lord Gantang was missing

120
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,060
after he was assassinated

121
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,130
and hasn’t been found yet.

122
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:30,730
Bring the spy to me!

123
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:32,180
Aye.

124
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:41,250
Why did you tell the Demons?

125
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:42,930
We’re short-handed.

126
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,250
When did I tell you
to ask the Demons for help?

127
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,780
You said we couldn’t kill Zhou Yitang

128
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:49,900
and then you asked Lord Shen for help.

129
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,570
Just because you failed to catch him,

130
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:55,370
I had to be insulted by Shen Tianshu!

131
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:56,810
Even his guard

132
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:58,740
dared to give me that attitude!

133
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:02,370
Yes. It’s so incapable of us.

134
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:04,810
A minister dies
when his lord is insulted.

135
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:06,250
Do you understand?

136
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,250
I’m sorry! Please tell me what you want.

137
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,420
Zhou Yitang!

138
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:12,130
I want Zhou Yitang! Got it?

139
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:13,570
I see.

140
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:14,310
Get out!

141
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:15,640
Aye.

142
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,450
Kneel!

143
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:25,130
Commander-in-chief asked Lord Shen

144
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:27,540
to catch Lord Gantang alive

145
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:28,530
on his way back
to Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

146
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,740
Just catch him alive?

147
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,810
They...

148
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:35,780
They wanted him.

149
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:37,780
We were ordered to kill him
if failing to catch him alive.

150
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,220
But we failed.

151
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:40,660
He ran away.

152
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:42,960
We’ve been looking for him lately.

153
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,900
When was the order given?

154
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,050
Who gave it?

155
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:48,690
I don’t know!

156
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:50,340
A couple of days ago,

157
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,300
Commander-in-chief visited Lord Shen.

158
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,130
Madam, I’ve told you

159
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:55,450
all I know.

160
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:57,930
No one told me anything else.

161
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:01,540
Take him away. Keep him under guard.

162
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:02,860
-Madam!
-Aye. Take him away.

163
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,570
-Aye. Aye. Go.
-I’ve told you all I know.

164
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:06,100
Madam!

165
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,100
Madam! Madam!

166
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:10,220
I’ve told you all I know!

167
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:12,490
I’ve actually told you.

168
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:13,980
Madam!

169
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:17,540
I’m sure the Demons have known
about the Color of Ocean and Heaven.

170
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,130
Apparently, they want to threaten me

171
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:22,900
with Yitang’s life.

172
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,930
They haven’t assembled men yet.

173
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:28,610
But soon they’ll attack us.

174
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,660
Madam.

175
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:39,610
Madam, I bring you the book.

176
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:43,980
-Madam.
-Madam. Madam.

177
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,780
Get her in.

178
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:46,690
Come in!

179
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:50,980
Madam.

180
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,420
What happened to you?

181
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,220
Let me check on you.

182
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:11,900
Your Highness.

183
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,490
What’s wrong?

184
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:16,490
Your Highness.

185
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,860
Since I failed to propose to Miss Zhou,

186
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,540
let’s go back home.

187
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:27,980
Your Highness, since you came

188
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:30,100
in the name
of celebrating Madam Li’s birthday,

189
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,660
you shouldn’t leave

190
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:33,860
before the birthday party tomorrow.

191
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:37,100
Or you couldn’t explain to His Majesty.

192
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,420
Miss Zhou is

193
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:40,490
with Xie Yun.

194
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:44,740
I should give them blessings, right?

195
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:49,610
Your Highness.

196
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:53,420
You come to such a humble place.

197
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:55,300
But they thought you were weak

198
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,570
and gave you a cold-shoulder.

199
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:59,610
Since you have been turned down,

200
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:01,810
why do you bother to stay
for the birthday party

201
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:04,610
and bring honor to them?

202
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:05,490
Madam.

203
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:06,980
I had an idle dream

204
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,250
and one-sided wish.

205
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:09,930
Don’t bring it up again.

206
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:32,490
Why does he have a fever?

207
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,180
I’m afraid he’s sick again

208
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,780
because he hasn’t recuperated well

209
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:37,930
in recent days.

210
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:41,540
I’m fine.

211
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,540
Your Highness.

212
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,130
Your Highness, are you alright?

213
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:50,420
Madam, he...

214
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:51,780
If His Highness stays,

215
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:54,340
he will feel sad.

216
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,980
He’d better have a good rest

217
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,340
and leave as soon as possible.

218
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:59,340
Your Highness, let’s leave.

219
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:09,540
(To Be Self-effacing)

220
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:16,130
(To Be Repenting)

221
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:18,420
Madam, you had a serious wound
on your heart.

222
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:19,930
Without a timely cure,

223
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:21,900
there’s a lingering problem.

224
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:24,340
But there’s no better way

225
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:27,010
to cure you of your heart.

226
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:29,050
You should just rest for recuperation.

227
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,540
I just know a few medical skills.

228
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:33,810
Shall I

229
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:35,570
get you a doctor?

230
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:39,420
No. Don’t tell others.

231
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:43,540
Miss Chuchu, Madam has kept it secret.

232
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,570
Only Doctor Luo knows it.

233
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:48,340
Even Miss Zhou and Mr. Li don’t know.

234
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:50,340
Please keep the secret for her.

235
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:52,340
Like you said,

236
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:54,660
I need to rest for recuperation.

237
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:56,900
It will take a year or two.

238
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,250
If I tell them,

239
00:13:58,250 --> 00:13:59,980
they’ll worry about me.

240
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:00,810
But Madam...

241
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:02,690
It’s concerning your health.

242
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:05,220
If you don’t have timely recuperation,

243
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,660
the problem will get worse.

244
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:08,860
Chuchu.

245
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:11,180
Ask Doctor Luo to give me the medicine

246
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:13,610
she used last time.

247
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,660
I know why you keep it secret.

248
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:23,300
Don’t worry.

249
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,300
I’ll keep the secret for you.

250
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,720
I’ll go get the medicine.

251
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,860
Lord, how is it going?

252
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:45,300
The Third Prince
will possibly leave tonight.

253
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,570
I think

254
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:48,340
it’s when we should take action.

255
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:49,120
Aye.

256
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:55,450
You mean you’ll go
and kill Shen Tianshu now?

257
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:56,490
Yes.

258
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:58,340
Madam.

259
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:01,130
You’re still wounded.
You shouldn’t act rashly.

260
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:04,130
Shen Tianshu is vicious and crafty.

261
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:06,490
If you fail to assassinate him...

262
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,250
If I don’t go because of my wound,

263
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,100
when the Demons come to attack us,

264
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,930
Fei and Sheng can’t defeat them.

265
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:14,610
Won’t there be more danger?

266
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:16,660
Shen Tianshu and I

267
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:18,490
will certainly have a desperate fight.

268
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:21,810
I’d like to strike first.

269
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,220
Madam, since you insist on going,

270
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,780
I’ll go with you.

271
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:29,180
No.

272
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:32,570
I’m afraid I can’t come back alive.

273
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:40,980
I’m Xie Yun.

274
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,690
May I speak to Madam Li?

275
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:53,810
Come in, please.

276
00:15:58,860 --> 00:15:59,980
Madam.

277
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,660
What are you coming for?

278
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:06,780
I come to ask

279
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,780
about the Color of Ocean and Heaven.

280
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,780
Madam, what are you doing to do

281
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:12,980
with the five tokens?

282
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:16,180
I told you not to interfere.

283
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,690
My point is...

284
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:20,490
Since we have all the tokens,

285
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:22,130
why don’t we destroy the clue
of the Color of Ocean and Heaven

286
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:25,420
so that there won’t be more trouble?

287
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:27,780
This is our own problem.

288
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:30,130
You shouldn’t interfere!

289
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:33,450
The Color of Ocean and Heaven
is important without doubt.

290
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:34,740
So many martial artists

291
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,490
have died to protect it.

292
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:38,570
Two generations of my family

293
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:40,660
have sacrificed themselves for it.

294
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,690
How could it just be destroyed

295
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:44,420
as easily as you imagine?

296
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,570
I’m sorry.

297
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:50,370
The problem of my dynasty

298
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:52,010
have got you involved.

299
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,200
To tell you the truth,

300
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:57,560
I’m dying.

301
00:16:58,450 --> 00:16:59,860
Keeping such treasure

302
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:02,690
has no more meaning to me.

303
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:04,850
All rumors
about the Color of Ocean and Heaven

304
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:06,820
bring nothing, but disaster.

305
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:09,180
I don’t want you

306
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,610
or your men

307
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:12,330
to keep dying for it.

308
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:18,250
Lately, I often see Fei
practicing her blade

309
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:20,010
in the middle of the river.

310
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:21,490
I guess she’s doing that

311
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:24,010
in case of any accident.

312
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:27,010
When I see her work so hard,

313
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:30,010
I feel heartbreaking.

314
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:33,580
Madam.

315
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:37,300
This problem was caused
by my grandfather.

316
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,250
It has brought so many bloodsheds

317
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,090
to the martial world.

318
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:43,060
I don’t want to get Fei involved.

319
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:47,270
After I die,

320
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:50,000
everything will be over.

321
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:52,000
No one else will be involved.

322
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:54,250
Mr. Xie.

323
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,970
I’m not qualified

324
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:58,790
to destroy what my ancestors died for.

325
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:03,580
You’re also not qualified to decide it.

326
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:06,060
It doesn’t matter

327
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,300
what the Color of Ocean and Heaven is.

328
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,130
But it must be a very important thing

329
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:11,370
to the whole world.

330
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:17,730
Well,

331
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:20,540
I have no more reason to persuade you.

332
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:23,160
I understand what you mean.

333
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:26,130
But for a dying man like me,

334
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:27,880
neither righteousness nor responsibility

335
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:29,710
matters more

336
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,970
than Fei’s safety and happiness.

337
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:38,580
I don’t have much to give her.

338
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,460
I just want to clear out
all hidden trouble for her.

339
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:47,420
Mr. Xie.

340
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:50,610
I can’t decide for her.

341
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:51,940
Neither can you.

342
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,940
Let her make her own choice.

343
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:57,780
No matter if she chooses

344
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:59,700
to take the responsibility

345
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,850
or to live a safe and happy life,

346
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,250
I’ll support her.

347
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,130
Thank you, Madam.

348
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:14,660
You’ve brought her more trouble

349
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:15,900
than the Color of Ocean and Heaven

350
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,250
or the dispute of two courts.

351
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:21,730
There’s more behind them.

352
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:25,250
I talked to her.

353
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:27,850
I told her she would suffer all her life

354
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:30,250
just for a short period of happiness.

355
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:31,060
Is it worth it?

356
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:37,650
But she said

357
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,630
she wanted you only.

358
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:52,000
Don’t worry, Madam.

359
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:54,290
I’m actually dying.

360
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:56,130
But...

361
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:58,090
Before I die,

362
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:00,180
I’ll stay with her
until the last second.

363
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:07,700
The poison on Fisherman

364
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,330
could be relieved.

365
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:11,900
There’s no way to relieve yours?

366
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:19,560
The Bone-chilling on me

367
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:21,660
has been sealed.

368
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:25,210
But when I used
the Soul-searching Needle,

369
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:26,700
I released it.

370
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:30,210
Now the poison

371
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:33,250
is right in my passages.

372
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,470
Soul-searching Needle
from outside the pass?

373
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:39,700
Why did you have it?

374
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:43,460
When killing Dragon Master,

375
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:45,250
the North Blade Mr. Ji used some.

376
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:47,090
I picked the rest.

377
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,970
I’m sure you know

378
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:51,820
the Soul-searching Needle
gives people energy.

379
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,580
Whoever uses it will be forcibly strong,

380
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:54,890
but die in three quarters.

381
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:01,060
Thanks to the freezing effect

382
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:03,010
of Bone-chilling,

383
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:04,580
I managed to live longer.

384
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:06,780
With the medicine Fei got for me,

385
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:08,300
I’m still living.

386
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,010
It’s already a miracle.

387
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:12,900
I don’t know when,

388
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:15,700
but I’ll die.

389
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,250
Soul-searching Needle.

390
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:22,820
I only read about it.

391
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,940
I’ve never seen any before.

392
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:26,730
Do you have any with you?

393
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,700
I’m very interested.

394
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,660
May I keep it for some study?

395
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:24,540
Sir.

396
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:45,970
Dan.

397
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:48,300
We’re leaving right away.

398
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,180
Go get some available men.

399
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:52,210
Get packed and come to me.

400
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,580
Time is limited.

401
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:57,730
They’re already hunting down Yitang.

402
00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:00,180
They’ll come to us at any time, I guess.

403
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:02,660
Now,

404
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:04,130
I stand a higher chance to win.

405
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:05,090
Aye.

406
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:20,730
How do you know

407
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:22,900
my mother likes wonton
filled with radish leaves?

408
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:26,210
I’ve got a glib tongue.

409
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:28,010
Not to mention
your mother’s favorite food,

410
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:29,330
I can even get to know

411
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:30,580
all gossips and secrets

412
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:31,900
in your place.

413
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:36,230
Just because our men are honest.

414
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,780
You said you didn’t know

415
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:42,850
what gift to give your mother tomorrow.

416
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:44,460
I had to

417
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,730
give you advice,

418
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:47,850
ask about your mother’s favorite
and teach you.

419
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:49,700
I did hard work at least.

420
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:52,180
Why don’t you

421
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,820
even praise me?

422
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:56,940
You’re right.

423
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,460
Mr. Xie.

424
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:00,940
It’s so virtuous of you.

425
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:05,730
But I don’t think

426
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:07,420
you can make them tomorrow.

427
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:10,300
Shall I make them for you?

428
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,820
You can boil them.

429
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:13,060
Okay.

430
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:17,490
Oh, no. This is my gift to my mother.

431
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:19,420
I’ll do it myself.

432
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:21,010
I’ll try many more times.

433
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,410
Fine, then.

434
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:27,210
Look at the wonton.

435
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:29,010
Your mother will know you made them.

436
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:32,660
Look what you’ve made.

437
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:34,250
Isn’t it a rice dumpling?

438
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,370
It doesn’t look like a rice dumpling.

439
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:38,210
It’s not the way to make the wonton.

440
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:39,370
You should do like this.

441
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:40,780
You sound experienced.

442
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:42,460
But you’re not doing it
very well, either.

443
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:45,330
I’m doing it very well.

444
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:47,010
You’re doing it poorly, all right?

445
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:48,060
Look at this.

446
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:51,330
Fei, I’m relieved, then.

447
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:55,010
Before those things happen,

448
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:57,820
I want you to enjoy more peace.

449
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:02,210
When I left my room,

450
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:03,900
I met Dan.

451
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:07,370
She said you went to see my mother.

452
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:08,420
She looked hurried.

453
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:10,300
I didn’t ask much, then.

454
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:12,580
Why did you go to see my mother?

455
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:14,750
You know

456
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:17,420
she doesn’t like you.

457
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:19,840
But she said

458
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:23,610
she wanted you only.

459
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:30,010
I talked with Madam Li

460
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:32,460
about our future plan.

461
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:38,420
The water is boiling.
I’ll go boil the wonton.

462
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:53,940
Oh,

463
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:54,970
then,

464
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:57,060
your mother asked about Bone-chilling.

465
00:25:57,060 --> 00:26:00,040
She also asked me
for the Soul-searching Needle.

466
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:02,820
Soul-searching Needle?

467
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:05,580
Why did she ask you for it?

468
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,090
I didn’t dare to ask.

469
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:08,900
It was her first time
to ask me for something.

470
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,660
I gave her the rest I have.

471
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:12,580
All?

472
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,940
What an idiot!

473
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:17,180
Is that a good thing?

474
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,820
Why did you give it to her
just because she asked?

475
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:20,580
I...

476
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:25,780
I’ll go ask her.

477
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:31,060
Looks good.

478
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:33,490
Not bad.

479
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:39,820
I’ve thought of what gift
I can give your mother.

480
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:42,900
What is it?

481
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:45,490
I’m going to draw
a Longevity Painting for her.

482
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:46,490
What do you think?

483
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:50,010
Good.

484
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:51,700
Sounds like an ingenious gift.

485
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,460
Only you can think

486
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:55,300
of such a bookish gift.

487
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:57,580
She’ll know it’s from you.

488
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:00,330
Sure.

489
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:01,700
My painting

490
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,730
is worth a lot of money.

491
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:05,700
Since I’ll give it to her tomorrow,

492
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,900
I must paint it today.

493
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:10,460
You’re right.

494
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:12,330
It’ll take a long time.

495
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:14,060
Go ahead.

496
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:15,820
If I go,

497
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:17,970
can you finish it alone?

498
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:20,540
I can. Go ahead.

499
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:22,850
Fine. I’ll wait for you in the pavilion
in the middle of the river.

500
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:24,540
Go ahead.

501
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:40,130
I’m sure the wonton will be perfect.

502
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:20,300
Sheng.

503
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:23,420
Aunt.

504
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:25,780
What brings you here?

505
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:27,820
You’ve been handling our business.

506
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:30,090
Are you used to it?

507
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:35,490
Aunt, you’ve been in the Repenting Hall.

508
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:38,250
We worried about you
when we didn’t see you.

509
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:40,010
Don’t bother.

510
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:43,250
How are you doing with the business?

511
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:46,010
Personnel, elite disciples,
provisions, and defenses.

512
00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:48,540
Are you clear about them?

513
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:50,250
Aunt.

514
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:53,700
I kind of know about them.

515
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,330
What do you mean kind of?

516
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:57,090
If you don’t know very well

517
00:28:57,090 --> 00:28:59,540
about our gates and defenses,

518
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:01,420
when the Demons come to attack us,

519
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:03,010
what can you do?

520
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:05,460
I see.

521
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:07,370
Tell me

522
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:09,060
what you’ve known now.

523
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:13,460
There’re a thousand dan of grains.

524
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,660
Fifteen thousand men of all sects.

525
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:17,850
I’ve made arrangements

526
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:19,660
for our Fortress.

527
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:21,900
I put more men to each gate.

528
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:29,820
Mr. Xie.

529
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:30,700
Mr. Bai.

530
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:33,900
Mr. Xie.

531
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:36,300
His Highness is leaving tonight.

532
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:38,700
He asked me to say goodbye to you.

533
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,460
He’s leaving so quickly?

534
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:42,900
His Highness failed his plan.

535
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:45,010
He wants to go back to Jiankang
as soon as possible

536
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:47,010
and tell His Majesty about it.

537
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:50,780
Is Zichen alright?

538
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:53,250
Shall I see him off?

539
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:56,090
His Highness said he wouldn’t like
to bother anyone when he left.

540
00:29:56,090 --> 00:29:58,210
You don’t need to see him off.

541
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:02,940
His Highness feels depressed

542
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:05,250
and he’s guilty for you.

543
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:07,330
The doctor asked him
to leave for recuperation.

544
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:08,160
So,

545
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:12,730
he wrote a letter to you.

546
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:17,250
Mr. Xie.

547
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:19,540
See you, then.

548
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:37,060
Xie Yun, sorry for disturbing you

549
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:39,060
and proposing to Miss Zhou.

550
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:40,460
She doesn’t like me.

551
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:42,700
I know I shouldn’t have bothered her.

552
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:44,780
I also know you’ve loved her
for a long time.

553
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:47,460
I feel myself more ridiculous.

554
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:49,270
I don’t dare to disturb her again.

555
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:51,120
I want to leave
as soon as possible.

556
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:54,730
Wish you would live a harmonious life

557
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:56,780
and understand each other.

558
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:59,300
Since you and Miss Zhou love each other,

559
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:02,460
I feel happy for you, too.

560
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:04,370
Don’t worry about me.

561
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:10,300
Sheng, you should also know

562
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:12,940
which disciples you can use,

563
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:14,700
which external forces we can draw over

564
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,700
and what you should guard against.

565
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:18,900
In this way,

566
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:21,300
I’ll feel relieved.

567
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:39,900
Aunt, isn’t this our seal?

568
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:42,090
I’m giving it to you.

569
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:44,900
I’m getting old

570
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:47,090
and far weaker.

571
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:49,660
I can’t take care
of such business all my life.

572
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:51,460
It’s time to let young men like you

573
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:53,700
take the heavy responsibility.

574
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:57,300
Aunt, what are you talking about?

575
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:59,900
You’re just forty. You’re not old.

576
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:03,460
Take... take it back.

577
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:08,580
Sheng, your grandfather and father

578
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:10,730
made painstaking efforts

579
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:12,900
to build our Fortress.

580
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:16,330
I’ll leave it to you.

581
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,340
Greetings, Madam.

582
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:49,850
Why isn’t it cooked yet?

583
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:02,330
Doctor Luo.

584
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:04,370
I’ve got something urgent to tell you.

585
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:05,490
What is it, Miss Chuchu?

586
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:06,540
You look hurried.

587
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:09,420
You’ve been treating Madam Li.

588
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:12,250
You know it best, so I’m coming to you.

589
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:14,460
What happened to Madam?

590
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:17,540
There was a serious wound on her heart.

591
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:20,420
She has a relapse out of anxiety.

592
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:22,090
She even spat out blood.

593
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:23,730
That’s screwed.

594
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:25,010
Thank you, Miss Chuchu.
I’ll go right away.

595
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:26,660
Let me finish.

596
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:29,210
Madam said we shouldn’t let others know.

597
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:30,970
You don’t need to check on her.

598
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:33,490
Just fill the prescription
you used last time

599
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:35,780
and I’ll take it to her secretly.

600
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:40,610
My mother is sick?

601
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:42,580
Why was she wounded?

602
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:45,250
If she’s badly wounded,

603
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:46,820
why does she keep it

604
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:48,900
from everyone else?

605
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:52,490
She also asked
for the Soul-searching Needle.

606
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:03,140
(Heavy Responsibilities)

607
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:30,530
Why are you standing here?

608
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:31,130
Where’s my mother?

609
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:32,660
Aunt isn’t in.

610
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:35,900
And the Repenting Hall is locked.

611
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:37,810
I feel something weird.

612
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:39,050
Today, Aunt even gave me the seal

613
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:41,900
she always carried with her.

614
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:43,330
Screwed!

615
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,260
Something is gonna happen.

616
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,330
What is it?

617
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:48,810
My mother was wounded.

618
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:49,940
Seriously.

619
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:51,420
She has kept it from us.

620
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,050
She also asked Xie Yun
for the Soul-searching Needle

621
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:55,220
and said she would study on it.

622
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:57,370
Come on.

623
00:34:57,370 --> 00:34:59,740
Even if Aunt is wounded,

624
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:02,290
few martial artists can defeat her.

625
00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:03,660
Who does she

626
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:05,260
need the Soul-searching Needle for?

627
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:12,260
-The Demons!
-The Demons!

628
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:17,810
I’ll break into the Demons Manor alone.

629
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:20,460
You just need to help me on the way.

630
00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:23,130
Hope you can all come back safely.

631
00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:24,460
Aye.

632
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:25,810
Let’s go.

633
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:31,090
Mother.

634
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:34,020
Fei? Sheng?

635
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:36,220
What are you coming for?

636
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,940
You’re wounded.

637
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:41,220
Where are you going this late?

638
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:43,570
Such a slight injury isn’t a problem.

639
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:47,050
I’ll go handle something urgent
down the mountain.

640
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:48,900
Tomorrow is your birthday.

641
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:50,420
What kind of urgent thing

642
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:52,330
needs you to handle personally?

643
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:55,290
Aunt, you even
shut the Repenting Hall.

644
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:56,610
It’s my own business.

645
00:35:56,610 --> 00:35:58,050
Stop asking!

646
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:01,810
Then why do you need
the Soul-searching Needle for?

647
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:07,020
I’ve got my reason.

648
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:08,260
None of your business.

649
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,850
Get out of the way!

650
00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:12,810
Mother.

651
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:14,700
Aunt.

652
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:17,610
Mother, is it
for the Color of Ocean and Heaven?

653
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:20,330
Are you going

654
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:21,660
to the Demons Manor?

655
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:23,660
Aunt.

656
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:25,130
You’re the backbone of our Fortress.

657
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:26,900
What do we do if you’re away?

658
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:29,370
If you worry the Demons will attack us,

659
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:30,290
you should stay

660
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:32,260
and make concerted efforts with us.

661
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:34,460
Let’s think of another way, shall we?

662
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:37,740
If you insist on going,

663
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:39,700
take us with you.

664
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,570
Fei, what are you talking about?

665
00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:43,130
We brought back the tokens.

666
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:44,610
We should be responsible.

667
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:45,610
I said

668
00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:47,330
no one could interfere!

669
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:48,260
Get out of the way!

670
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:49,530
No!

671
00:36:49,850 --> 00:36:51,050
Mother.

672
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:54,020
You’re taking a great risk.

673
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:55,610
If you insist on going,

674
00:36:55,610 --> 00:36:57,260
defeat us first.

675
00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:01,290
You’re fledged, huh?

676
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:02,940
You dare to stop me?

677
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:08,810
Fine.

678
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:11,050
I’ll see

679
00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:13,090
if you’re capable to stop me.

680
00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:53,500
Madam, show some mercy!

681
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:14,220
Fei, give in!

682
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:16,980
I won’t!

683
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:25,290
If you give in, I’ll stop.

684
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:26,460
I won’t!

685
00:38:52,850 --> 00:38:54,180
You’ve lost.

686
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:04,220
Mother.

687
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:05,050
Here you are.

688
00:39:10,370 --> 00:39:11,720
You practice the blade very well.

689
00:39:13,570 --> 00:39:14,900
You’ve grown up.

690
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:18,180
And you can take charge.

691
00:39:21,850 --> 00:39:23,180
Well done.

692
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:35,530
Is my mother angry?

693
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:38,700
Why do I think

694
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:41,660
Aunt feels happy

695
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:43,130
for that?

696
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:05,100
(To Zhou Fei)

697
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:11,620
(To Zhou Fei)

698
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:14,340
(Nine Moves of the Snow-breaking Blade)

699
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:35,940
(Wish Madam Li longevity!)

700
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:45,420
Wake up! Wake up!

701
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:46,130
Wake up!

702
00:40:46,130 --> 00:40:47,530
Wake up! What happened to you?

703
00:40:54,570 --> 00:40:55,530
What happened to you?

704
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:01,660
Screwed!

705
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:02,900
The gift from the Third Prince

706
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:03,570
is gone!

707
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:04,610
What?

708
00:41:04,610 --> 00:41:05,850
I’ll go tell Madam.

709
00:41:05,850 --> 00:41:07,020
And you’ll look for it.

710
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:08,020
Go.

711
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:08,700
Go.

712
00:41:11,810 --> 00:41:12,770
What are you doing?

713
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:14,090
Madam is feeling unwell.

714
00:41:14,090 --> 00:41:15,570
She’s resting and won’t see anyone.

715
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:16,740
This is very urgent.

716
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,020
The Mountain-River Jade
in the Hall of Elders is gone.

717
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:19,220
There was a thief!

718
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:20,700
How is it possible?

719
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:22,330
We haven’t lost anything
within a dozen years.

720
00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:23,570
Did you get it wrong?

721
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:24,610
Dan.

722
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:26,500
We’ve searched the Hall of Elders,
but haven’t found it.

723
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,050
We need Madam to give instructions.

724
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:29,660
Let me in.

725
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:32,090
What’s the noise?

726
00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:40,700
Madam.

727
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:43,370
Why was the disciple on duty asleep?

728
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:44,460
I don’t know.

729
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:45,810
But it was very weird.

730
00:41:45,810 --> 00:41:47,330
Let’s go have a look.

731
00:41:47,850 --> 00:41:49,420
What, Madam?

732
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:52,900
Dan.

733
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:53,810
Here.

734
00:41:53,850 --> 00:41:55,050
Go with him.

735
00:41:55,050 --> 00:41:57,900
Lock the gate and let no one in or out.

736
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:58,980
I’ll catch up.

737
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:00,130
Aye.

738
00:42:00,570 --> 00:42:01,460
Aye.

739
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:29,570
Who?

740
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:34,460
Madam.

741
00:42:34,770 --> 00:42:37,050
I heard you don’t feel well today.

742
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:44,330
Who are you?

743
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:53,370
I’m a doctor
working for the Third Prince.

744
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:55,700
He knew you felt unwell

745
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:57,740
and sent me to bring you some medicine.

746
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:00,090
Take off your veil.

747
00:43:00,090 --> 00:43:02,130
I’ve caught a cold.

748
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:03,460
If I take it off,

749
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:04,980
I may pass it

750
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:07,810
on to you.

751
00:43:08,570 --> 00:43:10,180
Come over.

752
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:11,660
Aye.

753
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:23,030
It’s you?

754
00:43:24,570 --> 00:43:25,900
Madam Li.

755
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:28,020
Here we meet again.

756
00:43:28,290 --> 00:43:30,330
You poisoned my father.

757
00:43:30,330 --> 00:43:32,020
I haven’t taken revenge yet.

758
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:33,850
How dare you come again!

759
00:43:35,090 --> 00:43:37,050
You mean Li Zheng?

760
00:43:37,050 --> 00:43:38,500
You’re even worse

761
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:40,020
than your father.

762
00:43:48,370 --> 00:43:49,980
How dare you annoy me!

763
00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:52,850
I know you’re wounded.

764
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:54,810
Fighting in this way,

765
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:57,090
you can’t hold for a long time.

766
00:43:57,090 --> 00:43:58,290
Long enough to kill you!

767
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:16,850
You’re stalling for time?

768
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:21,180
Yes. I put poison in the candle.

769
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:23,090
You found it.

770
00:44:23,090 --> 00:44:24,810
But it’s too late.

771
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:27,900
Madam, the medicine is ready.

772
00:44:40,570 --> 00:44:41,460
Who is it?

773
00:44:47,330 --> 00:44:48,500
Madam!

774
00:45:02,330 --> 00:45:03,770
Repenting Hall?

775
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:11,260
(Wish Madam Li longevity!)

776
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:13,130
Madam.

777
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:16,420
Fei.

778
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:19,850
What happened to my mother?

779
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:21,180
Your mother...

780
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:22,700
She’s poisoned.
