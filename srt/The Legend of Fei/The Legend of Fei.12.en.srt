(Sanchun Inn)
Don’t miss it. Take a look here.

20
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:39,630
Sir.

21
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:40,800
Do you have candies?

22
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,360
Yes, yes.

23
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,000
Here.

24
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:43,950
Thanks.

25
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:44,800
Sir, we here have

26
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,480
yummy crispy jujube
from Hengyang BESTORE.

27
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:47,830
Sure, I’ll have one pack.

28
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:49,080
We want a pack, too.

29
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,760
-Okay. Thanks.
-A pack for you.

30
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,190
Okay.

31
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:53,270
Here you are.

32
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,160
Why are you sitting on the floor?

33
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,160
Are you okay?

34
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,120
I’m fine.

35
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,270
I dreamed about Duan Jiuniang.

36
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,830
Any information of her?

37
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:13,440
No rush.

38
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,080
We are at Mount Heng now.

39
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,320
Tens of miles around,

40
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,600
there’s only one place to stay at.

41
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,720
I believe

42
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,230
that we’ll hear from her soon.

43
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,720
Okay.

44
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,080
Let’s wait for three more days.

45
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,030
If we still don’t know where she is,

46
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,140
I’ll take you back to Huarong.

47
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,270
Really?

48
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,720
Really.

49
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,110
Maybe we can

50
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:48,830
go down to eat.

51
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,830
This inn stands out

52
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:54,820
for its chef’s cooking skills.

53
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,400
And their beef paste, too.

54
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,600
Believe me.

55
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,670
Dip the paste with a pastry.

56
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:07,030
You’ll know what heaven tastes like.

57
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:09,440
Before I leave,

58
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,390
I have to take a jar with me.

59
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:13,030
Or I can’t enjoy a single meal

60
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:15,000
in the future half a year.

61
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,190
Fine.

62
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:23,910
You’re drooling all over.

63
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:24,960
Let’s go.

64
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:27,470
Here it comes.

65
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:30,630
Smells great.

66
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,630
You lazy bones.

67
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:36,670
Go and do your work.

68
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:37,830
Hurry.

69
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:40,880
Sir,

70
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,080
one pastry, please.

71
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:46,160
And,

72
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:47,470
serve it with the

73
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:49,030
best beef paste for sure.

74
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,670
Okay, don’t worry.

75
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:53,420
(Liquor)

76
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,520
This lady looks worried.

77
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,960
Allow me to say.

78
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,510
You see,

79
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,320
when you turn my age.

80
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,670
You won’t worry about anything.

81
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:11,800
To you,

82
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,790
no matter how big a thing is,

83
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:14,800
after it passes,

84
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,220
it no longer troubles you.

85
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,390
I’ll ask the waiter

86
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:21,350
to prepare something warm for us.

87
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:22,950
We’ll feel a lot better

88
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:24,600
after eating something.

89
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:30,950
Come here.

90
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:32,760
Beef paste, pastry.

91
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,320
Hurry.

92
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,200
Okay.

93
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,760
Sir, check please.

94
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,000
I’m coming.

95
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,000
Okay. Thank you.

96
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,830
Take care.

97
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,960
Xie Meimei.

98
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,100
See, even

99
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,600
running business like they do

100
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,110
needs to socialize with people.

101
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:55,880
It’s not easy.

102
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:00,160
I used to think

103
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,810
once I step across the Ximo River,

104
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,160
I’ll be pure free

105
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,810
and nothing can stop me.

106
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,990
However I now find,

107
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,730
based on my insufficient talent,

108
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,230
let alone huge deals,

109
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:21,000
I can’t even handle the little favor

110
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,480
my mom asked me to do.

111
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:26,790
I only

112
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:27,970
have one wish now.

113
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:30,950
It’s to find Chuchu

114
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,350
and send her back to the Fortress.

115
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:38,720
Didn’t you hand her to

116
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,720
Mr. Bai?

117
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,950
Don’t worry.

118
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:43,110
Mr. Bai comes from Xingjiao Gang.

119
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:45,190
He’s got various skills.

120
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:47,390
You can trust him

121
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:48,950
with escorting Miss Wu.

122
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:50,110
Sir.

123
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,980
Here are the pastry and paste.

124
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,630
Enjoy.

125
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,020
What’s Xingjiao Gang?

126
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:05,160
Carter, boatman, waiter,
porter and middleman.

127
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,040
These five occupations

128
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,370
are called by a joint name,
Xingjiao Gang.

129
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:09,670
The Gang supports each other

130
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:10,860
in this particular route.

131
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:13,440
Those who run business

132
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,940
can be legal or illegal.

133
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:17,480
What?

134
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,490
Let’s eat first.

135
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,110
Don’t let it get cold.

136
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:20,920
You can listen

137
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,720
while eating.

138
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,070
Carter, boatman,

139
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:31,510
waiter, porter and middleman.

140
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,230
These are the five

141
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:34,170
occupations they do.

142
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,720
Driving a carriage.

143
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,600
Poling a boat.

144
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,480
Running a shop.

145
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,670
Delivering goods.

146
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:40,650
Buying and selling.

147
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,440
These people

148
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,640
travel extensively.

149
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,450
They are not necessarily bad.

150
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:46,690
Only that

151
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:49,920
among them,

152
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,110
things can be complicated.

153
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:53,350
Rules matter the most.

154
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:00,040
If an innocent freshman meets them,

155
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,920
he may get unlucky.

156
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,110
That means

157
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:04,400
Chuchu is not safe now.

158
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:06,320
No.

159
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,080
That’s not true.

160
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,800
They are like the Beggar Gang,

161
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:12,070
a bunch of poor people trying
to make a living.

162
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:12,720
However,

163
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,560
they can be moral and friendly.

164
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:16,240
Rules matter the most.

165
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,920
Mr. Bai works

166
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,920
for one of my friends.

167
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,950
He’s got

168
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:22,690
multiple routes which belong
to Xingjiao Gang.

169
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:24,320
As long as she’s with him

170
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,210
and doesn’t encounter the Demons,

171
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,070
Miss Wu is probably

172
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:29,780
a lot safer than you are now.

173
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:33,360
Can I ask them to send letters for me?

174
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,260
Let me tell you.

175
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:38,690
First,

176
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,230
I went downhill following Ms. Wang.

177
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,760
Ever since I was got in the dungeon,

178
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,390
I split up with them.

179
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:47,820
I don’t know where they are now.

180
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,230
As for my cousin,

181
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:51,350
he fled, too.

182
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:53,070
I don’t know where he is, either.

183
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:54,510
He disappeared.

184
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:55,270
How can Ms. Wang

185
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:57,110
explain to my mom when she’s back?

186
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:59,050
They must be very worried now.

187
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,480
Plus,

188
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:06,180
with secret service’s betrayal

189
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,490
and what happened to Chenfei,

190
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,860
I gotta send them a letter

191
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,350
to inform the elders in family.

192
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:17,320
There are too many people involved.

193
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,110
Your head looks small but

194
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:25,310
it can remember a lot.

195
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:33,520
Have you heard?

196
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,590
The crazy lady at Huarong died
so tragically.

197
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:37,790
The way she died was...

198
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:40,850
Yeah, I heard.

199
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:42,400
So scary.

200
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,550
What did you say?

201
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,230
Don’t you know?

202
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:51,470
Huarong county governor’s concubine
got caught by the Demons.

203
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,770
The head of them killed her ruthlessly.

204
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:57,640
Luckily someone took her body.

205
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,840
She’s probably buried now
after these days.

206
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,590
It scares me just talking about it.

207
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:02,470
It’s crazy.

208
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:03,440
I know.

209
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,910
Drink.

210
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:06,710
Fei.

211
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,350
The dead is gone.

212
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:14,790
Even if you go back,

213
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:15,780
what can you do?

214
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:51,980
I need alcohol.

215
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,070
Sir.

216
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,060
A bottle of liquor, please.

217
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,320
Coming.

218
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,320
Here.

219
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:17,460
(Liquor)

220
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:21,340
Drink slowly.

221
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,240
My grandpa has gone for long.

222
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:41,710
But

223
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:43,440
Ms. Duan has always borne him

224
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:45,970
in mind.

225
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:52,840
If grandpa has reincarnated,

226
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,730
he must be

227
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:56,780
a grown-up now.

228
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:03,050
If Ms. Duan

229
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:05,110
can meet him in the next life,

230
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,780
the years they missed

231
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,020
require several lifetimes to compensate.

232
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,780
More importantly,

233
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,200
there’s no successor
of the Yellow and Green Palm.

234
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,050
It’s probably gonna be a lost art.

235
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:39,340
(Liquor)

236
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,470
Stop there.

237
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:55,840
Who is it?

238
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:57,440
General Wen.

239
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,940
I’m a disciple of Mingfeng Building.

240
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:04,150
Is Miss Wu at your camp now?

241
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:06,440
Why? What’s the matter?

242
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,520
Under the order of Leader Li,

243
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,780
I’m here to escort Miss Wu
back to the Fortress.

244
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,240
Thank you for taking care
of her along the way.

245
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,410
Here’s Li’s personal letter.

246
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,340
Please take a look.

247
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,550
Okay.

248
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:27,840
Bringing Miss Wu

249
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,320
while marching can be inconvenient.

250
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,970
It’s considerate of Leader Li.

251
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,860
General Wen.

252
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,550
If it’s for my cause
that has delayed your schedule,

253
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:46,110
I’ll ride the horse instead.

254
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:49,400
It’s not because of you, Miss Wu.

255
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,710
You see,

256
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:52,760
we’re all men in the troop.

257
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,350
I’m afraid we may bother you.

258
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:55,710
So it’s better for you

259
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:57,100
to go back to the Fortress sooner.

260
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,200
But you’ve promised me

261
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,540
to bring me to find Fei.

262
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:01,880
Miss Wu.

263
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:03,280
It’ll be a long and difficult journey.

264
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:05,230
Please follow us to the Fortress.

265
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:11,820
Lord.

266
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:18,840
(To inform Mr. Shen)

267
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,340
(Wu Chuchu insisted)
Miss Wu has become clever.

268
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:21,200
(on going with Wen Yu.)

269
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,010
(We failed to bring her back.)
The Color of Ocean and Heaven

270
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:26,860
of her is the easiest thing we can get.

271
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:34,920
Fei.

272
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,780
I’ve got something nice.

273
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:47,520
It must be something weird again.

274
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,600
No.

275
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:51,150
What I have

276
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:52,830
is called Easing Your Pain.

277
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:54,820
Try it.

278
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,030
Candy?

279
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,750
One lump can choke children to death.

280
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:11,760
You had the time to buy candies.

281
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,420
Why didn’t you do proper business?

282
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,190
People have different standards.

283
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,760
Some see fighting for wealth
and fame as proper business.

284
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:22,860
To me,

285
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,640
making pretty girls happy
is the proper business.

286
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,730
What’s the difference?

287
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,070
I even think

288
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,290
that mine is nobler.

289
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,340
Xie Yun.

290
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,060
Your footwork still needs practice.

291
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,830
At least be as good as your flirting.

292
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:44,200
Otherwise,

293
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,550
you may encounter bloodshed.

294
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,650
Trust me and my Easing Your Pain.

295
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:49,820
Try it.

296
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,350
I promise you’ll be too

297
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,620
happy to do anything after it.

298
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:53,670
Do you believe it?

299
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:56,730
Let me see then.

300
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,640
Good, right?

301
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,520
Oh no.

302
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,520
The monster is coming again.

303
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:14,800
What should we do?

304
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,080
Please stay here, guys.

305
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:34,400
(Yin Pei)

306
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,110
(Dragon Master’s Subordinate)
Who’s meddling here?

307
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,140
What a crappy candy that Xie Yun bought.

308
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,460
It sticks on my tooth.

309
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,760
Many people no matter at what age

310
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,080
can’t control their mouth.

311
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,520
A young girl like you

312
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,170
actually can control your mouth.

313
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:58,760
It’s rare.

314
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:04,280
Who is it?

315
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:33,960
Stupid girl.

316
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,590
Gentleman,

317
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:40,350
you look like an extraordinary man.

318
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:43,980
Don’t lower yourself to argue
with a normal person.

319
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,880
Our young master has a bad temper.

320
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,950
We are hurrying on our journey.

321
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:01,980
Please forgive us.

322
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,830
My apology.

323
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,760
It’s fine, it’s fine.

324
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,520
Excuse me

325
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,680
for blocking your way.

326
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,760
Forgive me.

327
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,950
Hua Zhenglong.

328
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:20,830
I kept you alive.

329
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:24,580
How dare you to be disrespectful?

330
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:28,250
Who are they?

331
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:33,800
(Dragon)
I kept you alive

332
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,830
purely because

333
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:36,920
you hid the stupid useless

334
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,160
thing.

335
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:41,140
(Dragon)

336
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,850
The Dragon Master?

337
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:49,300
Can’t be.

338
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:51,070
If it was him,

339
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,190
how come I could flick his whip away

340
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:54,070
by using just a chopstick?

341
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,830
He’s probably just

342
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:57,710
a subordinate.

343
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,190
I find you cleverer now.

344
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,460
Silly girl.

345
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:07,760
I’m always generous with women.

346
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,620
You’ve got luck.

347
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,080
After I finish my business.

348
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:14,010
Kneel down and kowtow to me.

349
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,920
I’ll let it pass.

350
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:18,270
Don’t forget.

351
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:21,310
Go check the kitchen.

352
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,560
You’ve searched here

353
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,310
three times already.

354
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:27,690
We don’t have the person you want.

355
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:29,430
Shut up.

356
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,250
Did you hear him?

357
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:38,750
He sounds like he’ll punch me.

358
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:43,540
Can’t you stop eating?

359
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,890
I just said that you’re calmer now.

360
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:48,400
But you are not.

361
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:51,430
I’m trying to eat more.

362
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,160
So that when you fight him later,

363
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,760
I can get up and

364
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,710
cheer for you.

365
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:06,760
What a ruffian

366
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:09,060
that dares to make a scene
at normal inns.

367
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,040
Innocent girls like you who grew

368
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,640
up in a carefree environment

369
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,230
have never seen ruffians

370
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:20,320
like Four-guardian Mountain before.

371
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:23,090
Look at you, standing out for justice.

372
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,670
The old man

373
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,730
didn’t look like he’s strong.

374
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,280
Fei.

375
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:45,470
His moves are normal.

376
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:46,350
But,

377
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:48,190
he’s nearly top-notch.

378
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,110
Because he’s good at using dirty tricks.

379
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:53,060
Based on his practical experiences,

380
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,160
he can beat ten of you.

381
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,470
Even your mom is here,

382
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:58,520
she wouldn’t take him lightly.

383
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,100
He’s that good?

384
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,280
Little guy.

385
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,040
Hold on to it.

386
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:16,430
Your body isn’t strong enough.

387
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:17,880
We’ve been walking for long.

388
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,760
Where on earth is the Qi School?

389
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,920
Don’t tell me it’s the shabby temple.

390
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,430
No, it’s not.

391
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:23,800
Qi School’s strategic points

392
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,430
are covered by multiple formations
and traps.

393
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:27,680
It’s well defensed.

394
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,880
It can’t be found by just anybody.

395
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:32,640
This temple is merely

396
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,280
an Eight-diagram Formation

397
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,560
used for disciples’ daily training.

398
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,000
Before entering the forbidden area.

399
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,640
There’s a Mystery Forest.

400
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:42,470
You can only see it
after solving the formation.

401
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:44,520
Okay, put me down.

402
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,830
We’ve got Mystery Forest.

403
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,160
I think you’re tired.

404
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,070
Let’s get into the temple and rest.

405
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:53,880
I can teach you some basic

406
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,590
tactics of Qi School, too.

407
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:58,640
Let’s see if you got talents.

408
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,560
I’ve heard that Qi School’s tactics

409
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,000
are widely appreciated
and got many disciples.

410
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,230
It’s also said that they hide
themselves in the city,

411
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:07,280
and don’t mind
about the worldly matters.

412
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:11,350
Now I see, that’s how they retire
from the world.

413
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:13,880
Living in this world,

414
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:17,560
trouble eventually comes
to you though you try to avoid it.

415
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,640
No matter how subtle the tactics are,

416
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:22,190
Qi School still suffered from disasters,

417
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:24,430
and I’m the only one left.

418
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:27,280
Sir.

419
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,710
You, you...

420
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,310
Let’s go.

421
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:38,160
Sir.

422
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,310
I’ve never heard so many

423
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:41,310
rumors when living in the Fortress.

424
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:42,560
But don’t worry.

425
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,280
I’ll send you back

426
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,770
to your shelter safe and sound.

427
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:45,880
Okay.

428
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:49,830
I trust you with it.

429
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:51,430
You’re finally here.

430
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:55,070
Following your traces,

431
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,350
(Learning Tao)
I knew you’d come here.

432
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:59,860
(Learning Tao)

433
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,710
I’ve been waiting for you.

434
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:07,280
(Still Waters Run Deep)

435
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,620
(Feng Wuyan, Black Judge)
Long time no see, Senior.

436
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:12,400
Feng Wuyan.

437
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,760
You’ve been evicted from the school.

438
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,170
Why did you come back?

439
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:21,010
I’m here to visit you, of course.

440
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:23,390
I saw him

441
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:25,030
carrying you on the back.

442
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:26,960
Senior,

443
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:28,730
are you wounded?

444
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:32,190
No one can hurt me

445
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:33,920
in this world,

446
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,290
right?

447
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,710
Right, right.

448
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,350
As long as you’re fine.

449
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:45,190
So they won’t say
that I take advantages from you.

450
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,110
I was supposed

451
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:51,920
to be the chief.

452
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:58,110
It’s time to give it back to me.

453
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:01,040
Nonsense.

454
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:03,950
The former chief has entrusted
me with it.

455
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,000
When has it become yours?

456
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,560
You don’t even know the basic

457
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,110
Qi School tactics.

458
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:11,830
You wouldn’t pass a single

459
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:13,110
Eight-diagram Formation.

460
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:15,590
Let alone being the mainstay
of Qi School.

461
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:18,540
Who knows why that old bone

462
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:21,720
passed you the chief whisk.

463
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,470
But, no matter what

464
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:26,120
magical tricks you know,

465
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,920
now, Qi School

466
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,710
has declined, hasn’t it?

467
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:32,700
Feng Wuyan.

468
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:36,510
How dare you talk
about the former master?

469
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,520
Old time stories.

470
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:41,110
I can’t argue with you ungrateful soul.

471
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:41,940
Go away.

472
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,760
I don’t want to hurt you

473
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:47,160
for the former chief’s sake.

474
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,110
You’re being silly.

475
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,310
Nowadays, you’re the

476
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:53,190
only one left in Qi School.

477
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,190
If you die,

478
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:56,350
wouldn’t the whisk

479
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:59,070
eventually belong to me?

480
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,830
Stop dreaming.

481
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:04,160
I’d rather pass it to this young man

482
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,650
than to you.

483
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,280
So you’ve already made up your mind.

484
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,880
I have nothing to do

485
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,720
with Qi School.

486
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,710
I have to go back
to Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

487
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:27,250
Li Sheng.

488
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:28,980
I’m here.

489
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:30,640
Don’t be afraid of him.

490
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,160
I’d like to give it a try.

491
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,350
I’ve been out of Qi School for years.

492
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:55,560
I practiced my skills hard.

493
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,780
They call me Black Judge now.

494
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,960
After these years, you’re still

495
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,400
as good as before.

496
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,590
Feng Wuyan.

497
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,830
You’re no longer a disciple.

498
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:08,740
If you keep trying to get the whisk,

499
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:11,040
I won’t be nice anymore.

500
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:16,080
His name is Li Sheng, right?

501
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,830
I’ll get you off the picture eventually.

502
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:23,110
No, no, no. I’m really not a disciple.

503
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:23,600
Li Sheng.

504
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:24,970
Let’s go.

505
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:30,380
(Learning Tao)
(Deep Waters Run Deep)

506
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:33,820
(Sanchun Inn)

507
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,400
There’s nothing here.

508
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:45,430
See.

509
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:47,000
I told you.

510
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,710
What you want isn’t here.

511
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:50,950
No matter how many times you search.

512
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:53,000
Impossible.

513
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,800
I haven’t revenged yet.

514
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,120
I have to find him.

515
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:12,960
Beef paste.

516
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:21,160
Don’t use fingers.
We’ve got pastries here.

517
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,190
Come on. Have some more, sir.

518
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:23,960
It’s still warm.

519
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:27,500
This is the paste that only he can make.

520
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:29,890
Who?

521
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,830
He never leaves here.

522
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:37,230
You lied.

523
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,880
Arrest these two immediately.

524
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,430
If you don’t hand out Ji Yunchen,

525
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:46,640
I’ll kill this girl.

526
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:51,430
Fellows, we can settle
through discussion.

527
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:53,310
Let’s discuss about it.

528
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:55,430
Old Dragon.

529
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:57,760
Your tricks are undefeatable.

530
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,710
When do you start

531
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:00,950
to listen to a young boy?

532
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:02,800
I’m under orders, I can’t disobey.

533
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,110
Sir, Miss.

534
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:05,560
Excuse me.

535
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,000
Watch out for his hilt.

536
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,310
What an aggressive old man.

537
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:45,470
Beating up the onlooker.

538
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:46,680
Stop it.

539
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:20,880
Hero, take a rest.

540
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,660
Give them some time to talk.

541
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,030
Sorry

542
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:32,000
for causing you trouble again.

543
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,190
Pei.

544
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,870
A wrong has a source,
a loan has a lender.

545
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,900
Don’t get others involved.

546
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:48,790
Good.

547
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:54,040
You finally stand out.

548
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:58,560
Decided to repay your debt?

549
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:02,930
Tell me,

550
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,090
how do you want me to repay?

551
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,050
I don’t want your life.

552
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:14,430
I want you to break your vessels
in front of me.

553
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:18,830
Kneel down to kowtow
for eight hundred times.

554
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:21,800
Then let me stab you couple of times.

555
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,180
Our old time stories

556
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,760
can end then.

557
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:29,140
It’s not hard to do.

558
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,580
I’ll go with you.

559
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:33,370
You can do

560
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,220
whatever you want to me.

561
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:36,580
But,

562
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:41,140
don’t drag others down.

563
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,300
Wait.

564
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:01,260
Wait a second, take your time.

565
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:04,310
You see, we only have

566
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:05,800
one cook at this little place.

567
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,880
(Hua Zhenglong, Lotus Palm)
If you take him,

568
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,760
where should I find another one?

569
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,310
Step away from this.

570
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,040
Blocking my entrance early
in the morning.

571
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,920
How should I run business?

572
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:25,800
There are all kinds of people

573
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,250
at the foot of Mount Heng.

574
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,310
Do you think just a pretty mouth

575
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:30,290
can handle everything?

576
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,480
Fei.

577
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,940
Do you see the boss’s hands?

578
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:42,830
Help me.

579
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:54,790
Oh no.

580
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:02,110
With Dragon Flag stabbed
on the door,

581
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:05,950
people can come in but not out.

582
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:07,310
Only dead here,

583
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:08,800
no people alive.

584
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:17,190
This guy brings bad luck.

585
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:19,040
Whoever supports him gets unlucky.

586
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,600
Plus, you’re still here.

587
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:23,280
I’m afraid we can’t get off easily.

588
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,520
What should we do now?

589
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:27,110
Well,

590
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:30,760
I’m not good at handling this anyway.

591
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:34,230
I just don’t want to die here.

592
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,640
Let’s go.

593
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,590
No one can leave.

594
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:45,040
Hold it.

595
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,920
Is it...?

596
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,190
The Snow-breaking Blade?

597
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:42,520
I didn’t know you are a successor
of the South Blade.

598
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,280
Sorry for offending you.

599
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:47,280
Our problem doesn’t concern you.

600
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,350
Sorry for interrupting.

601
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:52,590
You can leave with your friend now.

602
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,570
I’ll see you next time

603
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:57,710
and apologize.

604
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,040
What?

605
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,070
You old bone

606
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:12,800
heard about Snow-breaking Blade

607
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,710
and changed your mind like this?

608
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:16,560
You couldn’t beat her

609
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,350
so could only say

610
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:21,230
something about South Blade successor.

611
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,190
And your laugh?

612
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,640
It’s even worse.

613
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,640
I’ve never heard

614
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,680
anyone speaking so much nonsense

615
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,040
within one single sentence.

616
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,810
It’s a miracle.

617
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,560
Miss, since Old Dragon has said it,

618
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,590
just go while you can.

619
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:40,100
You were involved because of me.

620
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:42,310
I’m sorry.

621
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,880
These are my own legs.

622
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,190
I can either go or leave at my own will.

623
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:48,770
It’s not his place to tell.

624
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:52,310
My friend is indeed

625
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:54,350
a little bit rude.

626
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,010
She even bullies me sometimes.

627
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:59,260
But I just love the way she talks.

628
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,280
Fine.

629
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,430
I gave you a chance

630
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:06,160
but you wouldn’t cherish it.

631
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,670
Today, both the South
and North Blades are here.

632
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:11,670
The Dragon faction would like
to give it a try.

633
00:34:13,950 --> 00:34:15,340
South and North Blades?

634
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:29,760
Is this incense poisonous?

635
00:34:30,390 --> 00:34:31,390
No.

636
00:34:31,390 --> 00:34:32,190
It’s just like

637
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:34,630
the whistle arrows of your fortress.

638
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:35,840
I’m afraid

639
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,870
it’s their way to deliver messages.

640
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:40,230
Different from Mu Xiaoqiao
who doesn’t care about the subordinates,

641
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:41,470
Dragon Master
doesn’t fight personally.

642
00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:42,670
He loves group fights.

643
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:43,280
He designed a massive formation

644
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,320
which requires many people
fighting together.

645
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:48,420
It may not win in a war.

646
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,800
But it’s effective
when fighting a single fighter.

647
00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:54,170
When Dragon Master arrives here,

648
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,100
probably none of us can go.

649
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,550
I’m scared of them.

650
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,560
It’s just

651
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,580
he mentioned South and North Blades.

652
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:06,100
Who, who is the North Blade?

653
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:11,420
(Ji Yunchen, the North Blade)

654
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:15,000
May I ask, are you

655
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,680
really the successor of North Blade?

656
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:19,260
Ji Yunchen?

657
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:20,720
Mr. Ji?

658
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,560
Well,

659
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,710
my surname is indeed Ji.

660
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:29,390
But I can no longer fight.

661
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:31,320
I don’t want to ruin
my teacher’s reputation.

662
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,870
I can’t bear the name of

663
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:37,520
the successor of North Blade.

664
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,910
Do you have shame?

665
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:40,360
Just ask him if

666
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,660
he dares to use the blade again.

667
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:46,000
Yeah.

668
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,360
I made a serious promise

669
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,340
to abolish my skills.

670
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,360
Never use the blade again.

671
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,620
Never fight with people for life.

672
00:35:57,950 --> 00:35:59,560
Never fight with others for life?

673
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,110
What if others want to kill you?

674
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,430
I’ll just let them do it.

675
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,160
If all the people

676
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:18,470
here today died,

677
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:20,840
it’d be because of you.

678
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:22,810
Why don’t you just die?

679
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:44,920
Wait.

680
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:49,840
Even if you die now,

681
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,640
Old Dragon won’t go easy on us.

682
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:55,230
Plus,

683
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:57,700
Four-guardian Mountain
never fulfills their promises.

684
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,720
That’s true.

685
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:03,000
Talking about strength,

686
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,470
Old Dragon isn’t good enough.

687
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:08,250
But no one can be

688
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,150
more wicked and merciless than he is.

689
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:13,180
Let alone one man died in front of him.

690
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,610
Even if it’s a thousand or ten thousand,

691
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:17,870
it won’t stop him from

692
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:19,100
killing people at his will.

693
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:21,080
So do you want him to die

694
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,120
or to live?

695
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,240
What’s wrong with people
of Four-guardian Mountain?

696
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:27,180
Your ideas shift all the time,

697
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,150
always smacking yourself in the face.

698
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,710
Now the Dragon Incense is lit.

699
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,080
Dragon Flag is on.

700
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:50,000
Whether you die or not,
it’s not up to you.

701
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,670
What, what can we do?

702
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:56,510
What’s done is done.

703
00:37:56,950 --> 00:37:58,280
We can only kill him

704
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,120
before their master arrives.

705
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,000
Then we run.

706
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:00,560
I know.

707
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,970
I’m asking how to kill him.

708
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,710
We rush forward together.

709
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:06,410
Win by numbers.

710
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:08,600
What a lame idea.

711
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,150
Look at them,

712
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:10,870
few of them can still move.

713
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:11,580
If you can, you do it.

714
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:13,040
Me?

715
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,600
No.

716
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,470
I don’t have a blade.

717
00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:16,950
How, how can I fight him?

718
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:17,870
Mr. Xie.

719
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:20,190
You can either be tough
or weak, right?

720
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:21,230
Go!

721
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:38,520
Where’s your Bone-melting Powder?

722
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:42,080
Bone-melting Powder?

723
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:48,910
You’ve got a sharp blade.

724
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:50,360
I’ve got my mouth sharp like a blade.

725
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,320
We’re really

726
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,110
a good match.

727
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:01,840
True master of Lotus Palm,
Hua Zhenglong.

728
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,080
Snow-breaking Blade

729
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,520
on Mr. Li’s hands,

730
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,390
the essence was being edgeless.

731
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:28,190
While it’s on Leader Li’s hands,

732
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:30,080
the essence was being incomparable.

733
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:32,160
The moves are designed beforehand
while the user is not.

734
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:34,600
Don’t rigidly adhere to the moves.

735
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,760
Yeah.

736
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,520
When my grandpa passed away,

737
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:43,000
my mother was about my age.

738
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,470
Who knows if

739
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:46,840
her moves were good or not?

740
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:49,230
She said the Snow-breaking Blade
is all-conquering.

741
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:51,080
Who knows if it’s ancestral

742
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,790
or she made it up by herself?

743
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:54,990
Why would I see it as the standard?

744
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,180
I want to be myself.

745
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:13,460
Forgive me, please. Forgive me.

746
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,610
Forgive me. Forgive me, please.

747
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:22,880
Watch out.

748
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:30,630
It’s poisonous!

749
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:38,710
Mr. Hua!

750
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:55,080
It’s been twenty years.

751
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:57,350
Can’t believe someone still
remembers my old bone.

752
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,560
What a shame.

753
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,660
When my Lotus Palm

754
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:04,190
appears again,

755
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:06,060
the palm

756
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,110
is gone.

757
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:13,150
Guys,

758
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:15,610
though the incense only burned a half,

759
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,760
I’m afraid it still worked.

760
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,550
Dragon Master must be around.

761
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:21,170
We need to go as soon as possible.

762
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,980
The great successor of North Blade.

763
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,710
Though you’re already useless,

764
00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:27,800
you still got a bunch of followers

765
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,650
helping you.

766
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,280
If you say that again,

767
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,320
I’ll kill you.

768
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,760
Come on, go ahead.

769
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:35,280
Shut up.

770
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,640
She meant it.

771
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:39,950
-Everyone.
-It’s fine.

772
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:41,710
You got involved because of me.

773
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:42,760
I can’t

774
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,910
compensate to you.

775
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,190
It’s useless to hold me.

776
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:47,800
I’m just a dog of

777
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,520
Dragon Master.

778
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,600
But you’ve ruined the Flag

779
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,360
and blew off the Incense.

780
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,710
It’s a snap in my master’s face
in public.

781
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:57,470
All of you

782
00:41:57,470 --> 00:41:58,840
who are here today

783
00:41:58,840 --> 00:41:59,800
can’t escape it.

784
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:00,870
You will all die.

785
00:42:00,870 --> 00:42:01,600
Pei.

786
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,170
If your parents

787
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:06,360
see the way you are today,

788
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,940
how terrible they’d feel.

789
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,020
Stop ruining yourself.

790
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,750
You said all the good words.

791
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:16,750
How dare you to mention my parents?

792
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:17,760
You...

793
00:42:22,430 --> 00:42:24,640
Is Dragon Master really here?

794
00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:29,300
We can’t lose our dignity.

795
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:31,080
Let’s go out.

796
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,230
Miss, see you next time.

797
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:47,410
General Wen.

798
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:50,360
Wait a second, please.

799
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:56,360
Greetings to Your Majesty.

800
00:42:58,390 --> 00:43:01,390
Your, Your Majesty?

801
00:43:08,950 --> 00:43:09,600
Fei.

802
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:14,790
Are you okay, Fei?

803
00:43:15,190 --> 00:43:16,120
I was really worried.

804
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:17,000
Don’t worry about me.

805
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:17,960
As long as you’re okay.

806
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:19,700
General Wen.

807
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:31,900
Miss Wu.

808
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:44,230
He’s the Emperor?

809
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,390
I heard from General Wen

810
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:48,230
that he’s the Emperor
of previous dynasty.

811
00:43:55,870 --> 00:43:56,900
This is...?

812
00:43:58,950 --> 00:43:59,890
Miss Zhou, right?

813
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:01,480
General Wen.

814
00:44:01,950 --> 00:44:03,410
Is my father alright?

815
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:06,000
Lord Gantang is good.

816
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,430
He misses you a lot.

817
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:11,230
I broke a blade

818
00:44:11,230 --> 00:44:13,280
of you before.

819
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,130
Miss, you didn’t hold grudges, right?

820
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:20,620
I heard that

821
00:44:21,470 --> 00:44:22,730
at Huarong,

822
00:44:23,230 --> 00:44:24,910
His Majesty met with the Demons.

823
00:44:24,910 --> 00:44:26,320
After I sent help,

824
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:27,660
Huarong was already in lockdown.

825
00:44:28,430 --> 00:44:29,820
Luckily you’re safe.

826
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:36,670
I’m okay.

827
00:44:36,670 --> 00:44:38,000
A wealthy and honorable man

828
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:38,890
shouldn’t go through dangers.

829
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:42,710
It’s too dangerous for you
to experience the world alone.

830
00:44:42,710 --> 00:44:44,080
No, I’m fine.

831
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:46,150
Please tell Lord Gantang for me

832
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:47,520
that I’m not on my own.

833
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:48,910
I have...

834
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:54,230
I don’t know any emperor.

835
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:05,150
Miss Zhou.

836
00:45:05,150 --> 00:45:07,630
Miss Wu has been worrying
about you along the way.

837
00:45:07,630 --> 00:45:09,080
You two haven’t seen each other
for long.

838
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:10,120
Go and catch up.

839
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:11,800
I’ll prepare you a ride

840
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:12,840
to go back to the Fortress.

841
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:14,340
No.

842
00:45:14,950 --> 00:45:16,670
We’ve messed with Dragon Master.

843
00:45:16,670 --> 00:45:17,910
If we leave,

844
00:45:17,910 --> 00:45:19,500
bad things would happen
to the whole inn.

845
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:22,760
The monster of Four-guardian Mountain
is here, too?

846
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:25,190
Yeah.

847
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:26,430
Just now,

848
00:45:26,430 --> 00:45:27,950
I blew off the Dragon Incense,

849
00:45:27,950 --> 00:45:29,800
broke the Dragon Flag.

850
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:31,030
It may not end well.

851
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:33,670
General Wen comes just in time.
