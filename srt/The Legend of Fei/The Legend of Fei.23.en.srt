17
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,400
Where are Ms. Wang and Chenfei?

18
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:38,230
If I tell him now...

19
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,720
What’s wrong?

20
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:41,550
Nothing.

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,270
Ms. Wang and Chenfei

22
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:47,440
travelled a bit slower than us.

23
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,000
They’re on their way, I guess.

24
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,950
Why didn’t they come back with you?

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,680
When they protected us,

26
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,120
they were wounded.

27
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,630
Wounded? Was it serious?

28
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,680
Not serious.

29
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,510
That’s fine, then.

30
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:08,720
Time is running out.

31
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,270
Let’s go to the Fortress.

32
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,600
We must defend our Fortress.

33
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,240
Only in this way

34
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,080
can Ms. Wang and Chenfei

35
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,030
come back safely.

36
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:26,110
Did you travel all the way

37
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:29,000
and sneak into our fortress

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,320
just for sightseeing?

39
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,750
You’re wrong.

40
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,600
We come here

41
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,910
to offer amnesty.

42
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:41,270
As long as you abandon this place

43
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:43,080
and work for commander-in-chief,

44
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,520
you will be

45
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,600
treated very well.

46
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,800
What commander-in-chief?

47
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,670
Yu Wenzhi, isn’t he?

48
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:54,190
You think he’s a powerful man.

49
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,910
But we don’t care about him.

50
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:58,800
And you, as a martial artist,

51
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,800
you work for local authorities

52
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,550
and kill other martial artists!

53
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,830
Don’t you fear you’ll be mocked?

54
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,600
And Kou Dan.

55
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,390
She suddenly betrayed us.

56
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,390
What does she want?

57
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,550
Me?

58
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,720
I want nothing special.

59
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:18,720
I just want the token

60
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,800
for the Color of Ocean and Heaven.

61
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:24,190
You know what?

62
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:26,190
If Mr. Gu hadn’t told me,

63
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:28,750
I wouldn’t have known

64
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,000
our sect was close to him

65
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
and our token was right in the fortress.

66
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,960
You ignorant woman.

67
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,880
What the hell are you talking about?

68
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,080
What Color of Ocean and Heaven?

69
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,240
To hide it,

70
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,630
the previous head of Mingfeng

71
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:47,470
sent Fisherman personally.

72
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:48,440
Because of that,

73
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,880
Fisherman was poisoned
by Pathetic Clam with Bone-chilling.

74
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,320
Bone-chilling is

75
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,960
one of the eight evilest poisons.

76
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,750
Fisherman was supposed

77
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,320
to be dead now.

78
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,800
But to keep him alive,

79
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,550
the previous head took him here.

80
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:07,520
That old dog.

81
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,360
I didn’t expect him to live

82
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,910
until he got old.

83
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,960
If he hadn’t been killed,

84
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,160
he would live forever!

85
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,070
Fei.

86
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:40,160
Earlier,

87
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,550
news came from our secret services,

88
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:44,920
saying that we had

89
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:48,200
a great heir of the South Blade

90
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,600
who killed Zheng Luosheng.

91
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,350
I wondered

92
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:55,880
who the great heir would be.

93
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,510
Seems like

94
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:59,110
you must be

95
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:00,880
the great heir.

96
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,230
What?

97
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,040
You killed Zheng Luosheng?

98
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:10,880
What’s your point?

99
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,320
You know exactly

100
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,070
what I mean.

101
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,160
It’s farsighted of Leader Li.

102
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,720
In the name of helping people,

103
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,510
she’s been satisfying her own desire.

104
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:27,830
Shut up!

105
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,550
If you keep misleading people,

106
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:31,830
I’ll cut you into pieces!

107
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,110
Elders.

108
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:37,670
How innocent you are!

109
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:39,550
If my guess is right,

110
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:41,880
there are tokens
for the Color of Ocean and Heaven.

111
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,320
Leader Li has one.

112
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,830
General Wu Fei has one.

113
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:50,200
I’m sure Yin Wenlan had one, too.

114
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,670
That one was very likely

115
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:55,070
to be taken away by Zheng Luosheng.

116
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,670
Leader Li first got back
General Wu’s daughter

117
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:01,640
and sent her own daughter

118
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:04,160
for a random reason

119
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,000
to find Zheng Luosheng.

120
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,230
She killed her enemy and built prestige.

121
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,480
Now,

122
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,480
she must have three tokens.

123
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:16,880
She may have found more.

124
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,390
What a good plan!

125
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:19,830
Nonsense!

126
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:21,160
Ask her

127
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,830
and you’ll know if it’s nonsense.

128
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,010
It’s nearly time.

129
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:27,950
Our main force

130
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:30,070
are coming up soon.

131
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:37,390
Hurry! Drag them in!

132
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,920
Sheng!

133
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:40,600
Everybody.

134
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,070
The Demons
in the Forbidden Forest have left.

135
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:42,830
No enemies have been found

136
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,270
in other places.

137
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,920
But, many subordinates of Timber Wolf
are coming up,

138
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,510
getting closer to the outer gate.

139
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:49,720
Where are Fei and other elders?

140
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,000
They are

141
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,920
confronting Kou Dan and Gu Tianxian

142
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,600
in the forest by Ximo River.

143
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,160
This may be the enemies’ plot.

144
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,390
First, they pin down the Elders

145
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:58,480
and our elite men

146
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,110
by Ximo River.

147
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:01,640
Then they break through the outer gate

148
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:04,320
when we have weak defense.

149
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,760
Under such circumstances,

150
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:08,270
we will have enemies

151
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:10,200
front and rear.

152
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:13,670
We must take a risk.

153
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,230
Bai.

154
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:17,110
Go inform the Elders and Fei.

155
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,600
Remember to bluff.

156
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,040
Tell them loudly

157
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,760
that we have eliminated all enemies

158
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,040
and took control of the outer gate.

159
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,640
Aye!

160
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:29,270
Deng.

161
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:31,230
We must take back the outer gate asap.

162
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,590
Yun Xiao.

163
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:34,640
Get our men

164
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,110
to defend this place.

165
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:37,230
Aye.

166
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:38,470
The rest of you.

167
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:39,790
Take up your weapons

168
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:41,880
and let’s take back the outer gate!

169
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,030
Aye!

170
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:52,550
Whether you die or live

171
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:54,440
depends on yourselves.

172
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,790
Let me tell you.

173
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:59,550
First, put down your weapons

174
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:00,960
and surrender.

175
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,080
Second,

176
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:03,760
Miss Zhou,

177
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,960
give me the things

178
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,470
you got from the Wu family
and Zheng Luosheng.

179
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:09,640
Third,

180
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,000
please write a letter

181
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,030
to Leader Li

182
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:14,790
and ask her to come back early

183
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:17,440
and give me the token

184
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,910
she has kept.

185
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,760
Not harsh conditions, huh?

186
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,080
No.

187
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,910
Not harsh at all.

188
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:27,000
Hey, you!

189
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,710
I can get everything done for you,

190
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:31,350
as long as you kneel down
and call me Father,

191
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:34,550
and kowtow to us ten times.

192
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,200
We’ll get you everything

193
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,450
you expect.

194
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,110
Report!

195
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,470
Elders,

196
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:37,520
the defense in Forbidden Forest
is ready.

197
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,320
The Demons there have been killed.

198
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,440
Report!

199
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,790
Disciples of Mingfeng
have been eliminated.

200
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:46,960
Spinning Wires have been removed.

201
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,520
Report!

202
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:51,880
We’ve taken back the outer gate!

203
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,910
The men with Timber Wolf were stopped.

204
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:54,320
The defense is ready.

205
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,760
That’s what they’ve got?

206
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,280
So weak!

207
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:03,230
They seem to be in a bad condition.

208
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:05,200
Wrong. It’s not bad.

209
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,880
but very bad.

210
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,320
Shoot!

211
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,550
Mr. Gu.

212
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:28,320
You travelled all the way here.

213
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,670
Why don’t you get in and have some tea?

214
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:32,710
Let’s sit down and talk.

215
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:33,790
You...!

216
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,350
Miss Zhou.

217
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:38,910
You sound sharp!

218
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:39,840
I like that!

219
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,790
Ready to leave.

220
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:48,670
Hurry if we’re leaving.

221
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:50,350
Why?

222
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:52,280
Fisherman had a backup plan.

223
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,470
After being shut down,

224
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:55,520
the Formation will restart in two hours.

225
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,280
Why didn’t you tell me earlier?

226
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,710
I thought we would win.

227
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:01,030
I never expected to leave
from Ximo River.

228
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:05,000
Everybody.

229
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,790
They’re trying to run away.

230
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:06,350
Besiege them!

231
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:07,840
Don’t let them run!

232
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,670
Stop!

233
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:09,670
I haven’t had enough fun of fight yet.

234
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:11,030
Stop!

235
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,110
Mr. Zhang, the condition isn’t clear.

236
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:16,960
Don’t run after the tottering foe.

237
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,200
Don’t?

238
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,230
Then we won’t run after them?

239
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:21,150
We’ll watch the traitor running away?

240
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:23,200
Mr. Deng takes charge of the defense.

241
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,440
In case of emergency,

242
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,000
he could have kept a low profile.

243
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,030
He didn’t need to declare the condition

244
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:28,960
in such a big way.

245
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,200
So, I guess,

246
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,320
they were just bluffing.

247
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,470
Right?

248
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:34,000
Yeah.

249
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,590
Li Sheng sent us here.

250
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:37,200
How bold you are!

251
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,320
Zhang.

252
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,960
You’re getting old,

253
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,440
but you haven’t made any progress.

254
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,550
You can only bark or bite.

255
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:45,670
You aren’t even as sensible
as a young girl.

256
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:49,110
I didn’t know they were bluffing.

257
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:50,200
Somebody!

258
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,960
Leave twice as many people
to defend Ximo River.

259
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,440
Search the mountain

260
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,790
and don’t miss anyone of Mingfeng.

261
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:57,380
Aye.

262
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,280
Fei, come with me to the Hall of Elders.

263
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,880
Your mother is away.

264
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,880
We should treat you as an adult.

265
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:07,670
I want to check the pavilion
in the middle of the river.

266
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,840
Kou Dan and her men
stopped the Spinning Wire Formation.

267
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:13,230
I want to make sure it will restart

268
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:15,750
and take Fisherman back.

269
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,000
There’s the sound of fight.

270
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,880
Everybody, listen.

271
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,840
Rush in immediately!

272
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,470
Shut the gate!

273
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,910
Hold on! Hold on!

274
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,470
Shut the gate!

275
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:05,960
Hurry. Shut the gate!

276
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:14,790
Are you alright?

277
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:15,670
Yes.

278
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:17,320
The gate has been shut.

279
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,760
What do we do now?

280
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,760
Put up defense again for the outer gate.

281
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:23,640
They’re colluding with inside enemies.

282
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,150
When the latter know

283
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:25,790
we have repelled the outer enemies,

284
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:29,520
they won’t take rash action.

285
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:31,520
Well, Sheng.

286
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,910
I’ll take care of this place.

287
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:33,910
Take the wounded disciples away

288
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:35,080
for treatment

289
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,220
in case of their sneak attack.

290
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:39,200
Okay.

291
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:01,030
Chuchu.

292
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:03,880
Would anything happen

293
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,400
to Fei or my brother?

294
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,840
Yan.

295
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,840
Do you know

296
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,230
where the wounded men are kept?

297
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:16,670
The injured area, I guess.

298
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,320
Take me there, then.

299
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,440
I know some medical skills.

300
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,880
Maybe I can help.

301
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,000
But...

302
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,520
Fei asked us to stay here.

303
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,520
Yan.

304
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,110
Everybody is doing

305
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:29,350
whatever they can.

306
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:31,030
No one is unoccupied.

307
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:32,840
You used to protect me.

308
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,790
Now the Fortress is in danger.

309
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:37,200
I should help, too.

310
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,150
Fine, then. Let me take you there.

311
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:10,310
Fei.

312
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:12,230
We’ll all have the day.

313
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:13,590
It’s his destiny.

314
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,400
You freaked me out!

315
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,830
What are you doing?

316
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:51,110
Why are you coming again?

317
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:53,280
How annoying!

318
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:59,560
His hands are still warm.

319
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:03,310
Maybe he can make it.

320
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,760
Go get someone to save him!

321
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:07,960
Go!

322
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,790
Bone-chilling is

323
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,940
the No.1 poison.

324
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,920
Poisoned people die with chilling faces.

325
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:16,900
That’s how it was named.

326
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,590
Why did you tell me this?

327
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:42,490
Reborn Pill is said to detoxify it.

328
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,970
But whoever takes it
will be easily short of water.

329
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,640
All his life,

330
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,690
he must live
where there’s rich water vapor.

331
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:11,190
So?

332
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:14,570
After he died,

333
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,700
you would find his hands still warm
within a short time.

334
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,350
Calm down.

335
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:31,230
Take distracting thoughts
out of your mind

336
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,710
one by one

337
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:35,160
and throw them away.

338
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,160
Then you’ll feel

339
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,470
the direction.

340
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:42,110
Close your eyes,

341
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:45,520
feel it with your heart,

342
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:49,280
and calm down.

343
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:17,070
Lord, report from the mountain.

344
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:18,230
Mingfeng’s spies failed.

345
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:20,040
They’re coming down with Mr. Gu.

346
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,560
Both gates
of the Fortress of the Forty-Eight

347
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,560
have been taken back.

348
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,880
Leave.

349
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,420
Aye.

350
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:28,720
Lord, what do we do now?

351
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:31,100
Don’t be anxious.

352
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:36,780
Against such strong enemies,

353
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:39,730
I must have a backup plan.

354
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,800
Besides,

355
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,950
commander-in-chief is helping us.

356
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,950
From now on,

357
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,920
(Yu Wenzhi)
to put an end to resistance,

358
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:05,270
lock everyone up,

359
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:07,560
male or female, strong or weak!

360
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:19,150
Send more men to defend
the granary of Chunhui Town.

361
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:21,510
And make sure all families

362
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:23,440
hand in all their grain.

363
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:26,320
Leave not even a single grain of rice
to the Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

364
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,230
Aye!

365
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:29,360
You, search one family after another!

366
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,200
Aye.

367
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:37,910
Without the granary of Chunhui Town,

368
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:41,120
I’ll see how long they can last.

369
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:52,440
There’s really something wrong
with the Spinning Wire Formation.

370
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:02,440
Zhou.

371
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:04,230
A message from down the mountain

372
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:05,440
that Yu Wenzhi is suppressing bandits

373
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,680
with his private soldiers.

374
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,510
He wants to shift the blame to us.

375
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:09,870
Many people are locked up.

376
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:11,030
Suppressing bandits?

377
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,480
Only ordinary people live in the town.

378
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,840
Who can be bandits?

379
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,150
I’m right.

380
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:16,630
Seems like

381
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:18,510
they won’t easily leave.

382
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:21,110
Demons Manor colludes
with Yu Wenzhi’s private soldiers.

383
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:22,200
This time,

384
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,320
they must be fully prepared.

385
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,390
There will be a desperate fight.

386
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:27,870
It is serious.

387
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:29,510
Will you send a message to Leader

388
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:31,270
so that she’ll come back soon?

389
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:35,840
I don’t even know where my mother is,

390
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,390
not to mention sending her a message.

391
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:39,510
Demons Manor is attacking us

392
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:41,390
with Yu Wenzhi’s private soldiers.

393
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:43,230
Such news spreads very quickly.

394
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:45,270
My mother will hear of it soon.

395
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:47,150
Fei.

396
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:49,390
Time is running out.
Restart the Spinning Wire Formation

397
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:51,150
to keep this place safe.

398
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:53,110
Then, we’ll discuss the solution.

399
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,110
Bai.

400
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:56,720
Go and call our disciples together

401
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,030
to gather in the Hall of Elders.

402
00:23:58,030 --> 00:23:59,230
I’ll meet you

403
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:00,630
after restarting the Formation.

404
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:01,910
Aye!

405
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,660
(Fortress of the Forty-Eight)

406
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:35,440
Sit down for some rest.

407
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,390
Excuse me!

408
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:37,510
Come over.

409
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,360
Take care of him.

410
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:44,560
Yan, are you alright?

411
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,200
Miss Chuchu.

412
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:53,990
What happened to Yan?

413
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:55,390
She isn’t used to the smell

414
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:56,510
and goes out.

415
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:57,750
Why are you here?

416
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:59,080
I know some medical skills.

417
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,840
I want to come for help.

418
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,360
You’re wounded?

419
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,800
Sheng, come and sit down.

420
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,390
Let me cleanse your wound.

421
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:16,440
I’m fine.

422
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,230
It’s someone else’s blood, I guess.

423
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:20,080
It should be cleansed, too.

424
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:30,990
Sorry.

425
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,720
I thought you would be safe

426
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,990
when you came here.

427
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,230
I didn’t expect this.

428
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:37,750
Don’t say that.

429
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:39,320
It’s not your fault.

430
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:43,930
In Huarong,

431
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:47,110
Fei killed Qiu Tianjin for me.

432
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:50,490
But it didn’t satisfy me.

433
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,840
I know

434
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:56,110
he wasn’t the only man

435
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:57,440
who killed my parents.

436
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,390
His whole sect did that.

437
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:01,750
Now your home is in danger, too.

438
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:03,800
I will never forgive them.

439
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,110
Miss Chuchu.

440
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,270
You should have stayed away,

441
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:15,680
instead of living in hatred.

442
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,600
The whole world is in chaos.

443
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:21,270
Who can live a stable life?

444
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:28,440
Fei told me not to be scared

445
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,630
when there were troubles.

446
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:32,680
Responsibility matters more than life.

447
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:36,440
I must be responsible
for my families and friends.

448
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,910
I’ll also be responsible for myself.

449
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,750
I’ll go check the wounded disciples.

450
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,800
Let me check on you.

451
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,390
Lord.

452
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:05,840
I had meant to attack them by surprise!

453
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,150
Unexpectedly,

454
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:09,300
they successfully defended the outer gate!

455
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:12,150
Otherwise,

456
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:13,820
I would have taken over
the Fortress of the Forty-Eight!

457
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:16,480
(All Respect)

458
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,080
It’s easy to defend it
but hard to attack it.

459
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:22,150
We can’t easily take it down.

460
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:24,080
We’ve got other plans.

461
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,560
Don’t be anxious.

462
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:31,200
And you...

463
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,440
Ms. Kou.

464
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:35,150
The Spinning Wire Formation
wasn’t destroyed

465
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:37,750
and it would restart in two hours?

466
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,150
I didn’t expect that, either.

467
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:42,800
The Spinning Wire Formation
could still work

468
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,870
after it was destroyed.

469
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,110
It’s not all her fault.

470
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:50,320
If someone had got up the mountain

471
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,440
with private soldiers,

472
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:55,200
we would have taken down

473
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,630
the Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

474
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,360
Mr. Shen,

475
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:04,440
you were also radical.

476
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,200
Before my soldiers arrived,

477
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,030
you attacked anxiously.

478
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:11,480
You alerted them,

479
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,510
didn’t you?

480
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:19,600
Fine.

481
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,320
Then,

482
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:24,710
please kindly instruct us.

483
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,360
Focus.

484
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,150
Imagine what Fisherman would do

485
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:41,270
if he were here.

486
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:44,800
It works?

487
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:26,990
Don’t be too sad.

488
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:28,990
Or Fisherman would be sad, too.

489
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,600
He had taught me

490
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,150
a lot of things.

491
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,030
Everyone thinks

492
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:12,510
Fisherman used to be a greedy spy

493
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:14,400
who only worked for money.

494
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:17,270
But since I knew him,

495
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:20,160
he has been kind and fair.

496
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:22,750
I think,

497
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:25,400
after he was poisoned,

498
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,190
he must have regretted

499
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:29,750
for what he did.

500
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:31,840
That’s why he decided to stay here,

501
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,470
turn over a new leaf

502
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:35,270
and live a new life.

503
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:41,320
He has guarded the Formation

504
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:44,270
all his life.

505
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:46,470
When the Formation stays,

506
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:49,750
he stays, too.

507
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:56,200
Fei.

508
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,920
The Fortress of the Forty-Eight

509
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,190
matters a lot to you, right?

510
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:01,990
Of course.

511
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,080
But I’m too weak.

512
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,400
Everyone treats me like a kid.

513
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,990
In case of any danger,

514
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:12,920
they only ask me to leave.

515
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,190
When you grow up,

516
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:20,920
those who support you

517
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,800
will gradually leave you.

518
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,430
You will suffer countless hardships.

519
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,800
You will find your life always at risk

520
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,560
and you can’t slacken off at any moment.

521
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,320
But do you know

522
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:37,470
that’s already the luckiest thing

523
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:38,970
in this world?

524
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:41,470
You have the sharp blade.

525
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:43,360
When you fight,

526
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,950
you can break through obstacles

527
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:46,990
and go anywhere you want.

528
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,640
Aren’t you lucky enough?

529
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,270
In such a world,

530
00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:58,510
a lot of people
have lost their families.

531
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,800
But you know what?

532
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,560
Most of them could do nothing

533
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,080
but drift with the current,

534
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:06,120
because of their poor background

535
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,750
or poor qualification.

536
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:10,020
But you...

537
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:12,390
You can choose.

538
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:22,860
I’ve made a choice.

539
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,560
Heroine.

540
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,230
Look forward,

541
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:29,710
care for the living men

542
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:30,850
and find a way out.

543
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,360
Miss Zhou.

544
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,880
Don’t be impulsive!

545
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,510
We’re going to the Hall of Elders.

546
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,670
Yes.

547
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:45,160
After I cut off the murderer’s head,

548
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,120
I’ll bury it with Fisherman.

549
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:51,990
(Insightful and Open-minded)

550
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:54,560
Now, we must send more men

551
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:57,360
to defend all posts.

552
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,190
Demons Manor and Yu Wenzhi

553
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:01,400
are hurting people in the town.

554
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:04,120
But it may be a bait.

555
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:06,430
Now we should stand still

556
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:08,800
and do nothing.

557
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,470
What are you talking about?

558
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:13,400
I’m so fed up with the way you think!

559
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,800
They’re already encamping themselves

560
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,880
at the foot of our mountain!

561
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,840
Right near us!

562
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,560
But we are hiding here as cowards

563
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,510
and do nothing!

564
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:23,880
Who do you mean cowards?

565
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:24,600
You!

566
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,640
We don’t know
what our enemies are up to.

567
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,430
Rash actions will lead to more losses.

568
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:31,950
Don’t find excuse for your cowardice.

569
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:33,800
Elder Zhang. Elder Zhao.

570
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,230
Quarreling is useless.

571
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:37,270
It doesn’t help at all.

572
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:42,360
All right. All right. I’ll stop.

573
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,080
Don’t get angry.

574
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,600
Let’s calm down

575
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,400
and figure out what to do.

576
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,560
I think

577
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,400
they must be up to something

578
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:54,230
when besieging Chunhui Town.

579
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,840
Think about it.

580
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,600
Chunhui Town is a mere pass

581
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:01,470
for our communication.

582
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:03,030
Or more importantly,

583
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:05,230
we transfer provisions through it.

584
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:07,160
Do they want to

585
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,080
cut all our provisions

586
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,950
so that we don’t have anything to eat?

587
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:12,360
Then we’ll be in big trouble.

588
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,400
Yes. But don’t forget.

589
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,230
People in Chunhui Town

590
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:18,800
have been suppressed as bandits.

591
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,920
Some were caught

592
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,160
and some were killed.

593
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,950
Will we just let that happen

594
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:24,230
and do nothing?

595
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:25,510
How cruel we are!

596
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:26,470
Uh...

597
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:28,470
I’ve got a plan.

598
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,470
You’re a girl.

599
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:33,230
Why do you always...

600
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:34,320
Fine. Fine.

601
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,750
Show us your good idea, then.

602
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:38,350
Tell us about it.

603
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:41,230
Elder Zhang.

604
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:42,430
In my opinion,

605
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:44,560
our stored grain

606
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,560
can hold out for a moment

607
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,670
if we defend our place to the last.

608
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:49,670
But people in Chunhui Town

609
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:51,160
will suffer.

610
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,950
We can’t help, then.

611
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:56,080
We can’t have our sect destroyed.

612
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:58,160
We must defend our place

613
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,510
before getting any supply.

614
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:02,560
We have no choice,

615
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,710
but to ignore the people
in Chunhui Town.

616
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,270
We can’t do that, Elder Zhao.

617
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:10,230
If people in Chunhui Town

618
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:12,800
hadn’t lived with us as families,

619
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,710
we wouldn’t have built our fortress

620
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:16,400
into such a wonderful land.

621
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:17,990
In case of danger,

622
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:19,840
how can we leave them alone?

623
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:20,990
So,

624
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,600
I will go

625
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,920
and save them.

626
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,190
Good point!

627
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:27,320
Fei.

628
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,320
I trust you.

629
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,230
You decide

630
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:31,670
when to save them.

631
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:34,030
I’ll call on our men

632
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:35,950
to teach those bad guys a lesson!

633
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:36,710
Wait.

634
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:37,800
Elder Zhang.

635
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,840
There’re many enemies down the mountain.

636
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:43,840
If we all go down now,

637
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,510
we’ll have a weak defense up here.

638
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:47,510
I’m afraid they’ll attack us then.

639
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:48,640
Fei.

640
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,880
Neither of the options works.

641
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,560
What do we do, then?

642
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,470
I’ll go.

643
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:55,230
We should catch the leader first.

644
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,990
I’ll go catch Yu Wenzhi

645
00:39:57,990 --> 00:40:00,600
and threaten others with him.

646
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,470
Then I’ll protect the local people

647
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:04,320
and our fortress.

648
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:07,120
Demons Manor is guarding the town

649
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:09,270
with Yu Wenzhi’s soldiers.

650
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:10,950
I really wonder

651
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:13,190
how you can catch Yu Wenzhi.

652
00:40:13,470 --> 00:40:17,030
There’re men with Mingfeng,
Demons Manor and soldiers.

653
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:18,710
They aren’t from the same place

654
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:20,510
and they’re pulled together.

655
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:23,710
I believe they’ll quarrel.

656
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:25,920
Fei, you want to...

657
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,670
I don’t know what’s exactly happening.

658
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:29,270
But I can take actions accordingly.

659
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,840
Fei, you can’t go.

660
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:32,990
That’s too dangerous.

661
00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:34,120
If your mother knows,

662
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,400
she will not let you go.

663
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:38,400
Mr. Ma, don’t use my mom as an excuse.

664
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,750
She’s away from here.

665
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:43,120
Who knows where she is?

666
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,270
I’m afraid it’s too late

667
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:46,270
if we wait until she comes back.

668
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:48,670
Mr. Ma.

669
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:50,750
Prepare ten elite disciples

670
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:53,470
who can go catch Yu Wenzhi with me.

671
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:54,990
Okay.

672
00:40:54,990 --> 00:40:56,160
We’ll use the whistling arrow

673
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,030
for communication.

674
00:40:58,030 --> 00:40:59,430
All right.

675
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:01,600
Let’s stick to our plan.

676
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:05,560
Everybody,

677
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,160
take care.

678
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,030
Fei.

679
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,880
I heard you were going
to catch Yu Wenzhi.

680
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,600
Who told you?

681
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,840
Who’s got a loose tongue?

682
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,270
Keep it.

683
00:41:38,270 --> 00:41:39,160
Chuchu.

684
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:41,670
It’s your treasure.

685
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:43,920
I...

686
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:45,800
When I go,

687
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,400
I may not come back.

688
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,950
If I keep it, it may be more dangerous.

689
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:52,750
Fei.

690
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:54,950
This is precious.

691
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:56,880
But if you can’t come back,

692
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,840
we’ll lose the fortress, too.

693
00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:02,360
It’ll be in bigger danger.

694
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:11,350
Fei.

695
00:42:12,270 --> 00:42:13,660
You’re the only one I trust.

696
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:23,840
Don’t worry.

697
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,470
I won’t let you down.

698
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:57,990
Brother.

699
00:42:57,990 --> 00:42:59,510
I hear Yu Wenzhi colludes
with Demons Manor,

700
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:01,080
and is trying to fight us.

701
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:03,120
Fei went down to catch him.

702
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,270
I want to defend our fortress

703
00:43:04,270 --> 00:43:06,270
with you!

704
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:10,670
Stop it.

705
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:13,320
Are you trying to stop me again?

706
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:14,640
No.

707
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:15,880
This time,

708
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:18,920
I’ve got a more important secret task

709
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:20,190
for you.

710
00:43:20,190 --> 00:43:21,750
Secret task?

711
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:23,400
Do you remember the path

712
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:24,600
we usually went to

713
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:26,640
when going downhill for fun?

714
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,840
The one where Fei took us back.

715
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,190
Go that way

716
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:31,270
and send this letter
to the secret service

717
00:43:31,270 --> 00:43:33,430
near Hanshui Town.

718
00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:35,190
Ask them to deliver it to Uncle.

719
00:43:35,190 --> 00:43:36,470
I’ve explained what happened

720
00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:38,430
in the letter.

721
00:43:38,430 --> 00:43:39,920
I believe he’ll send troops to help us

722
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:42,400
as soon as he receives it.

723
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,990
Why do you want me

724
00:43:43,990 --> 00:43:45,360
to do such a small thing?

725
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:46,640
Let someone else do it.

726
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,640
I want to defend the fortress with you!

727
00:43:49,990 --> 00:43:53,750
Yan, this is a very important letter.

728
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:56,400
I must entrust it to someone I trust.

729
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,920
Our fortress is at stake.

730
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:00,600
Whether we can survive

731
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:02,270
depends on you.

732
00:44:03,950 --> 00:44:08,430
Everyone is fighting desperately
for our fortress.

733
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,710
Okay, Brother.

734
00:44:14,710 --> 00:44:16,160
I will deliver the letter.

735
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:19,920
You must be very careful.

736
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:25,510
I believe you won’t let me down.

737
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:09,950
Go thirty meters south.

738
00:45:09,950 --> 00:45:11,840
Here are all houses.

739
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:13,430
(Ancestral Hall of the Li Family)
Then go north.

740
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:23,840
Miss Zhou.

741
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:26,360
You can’t even distinguish directions.

742
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:27,750
When you arrive in Chunhui Town,

743
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:29,190
can you really find Yu Wenzhi?

744
00:45:29,190 --> 00:45:30,510
Give me one night.

745
00:45:30,510 --> 00:45:33,470
I will figure out the map.

746
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:37,950
Let me go with you.

747
00:45:37,950 --> 00:45:38,990
I promise I won’t talk much.

748
00:45:40,190 --> 00:45:41,190
You don’t need to thank me.

749
00:45:41,190 --> 00:45:42,710
Just marry me, if you’re grateful.
