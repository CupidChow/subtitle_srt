Who are you?

19
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,100
Just a passerby.

20
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:45,990
Thank you.

21
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,270
Where are you going?

22
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:54,620
Go back to them.

23
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,950
I managed to get you out.

24
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:57,920
But you still want to go back there?

25
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,640
I… I can’t

26
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,810
leave them there.

27
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,300
Ms. Duan,

28
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:33,140
when will Fei wake up?

29
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:35,660
Weird.

30
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:38,410
It’s really weird.

31
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,100
People who meet
the Yellow and Greed Spirit

32
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,110
can’t hang in there for more than
six hours usually.

33
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,670
But it’s been a day.

34
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:50,180
She is still like this.

35
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,600
She was in normal condition.

36
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:58,600
If not for you,

37
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,040
she wouldn’t have become like this.

38
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:06,910
By the way, Ms. Duan,

39
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,110
why doesn’t your master

40
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:10,410
teach you the Yellow and Green Palm?

41
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:16,360
He doesn’t have good intentions.

42
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,030
He just wants to practice on us.

43
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,280
He won’t teach us anything.

44
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:23,040
Isn’t he afraid that you will
teach each other?

45
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:26,240
Of course we can’t.

46
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,270
The Yellow and Green Palm

47
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:29,080
is the most

48
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,110
bullying martial art in the world.

49
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:32,720
Once you start to practice it,

50
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,720
it can’t be compatible with
other martial arts,

51
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,680
including the Yellow and Greed Spirit.

52
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:40,910
But Fei also has been practicing other

53
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:41,870
martial arts for years.

54
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,130
I don’t think her skills are good.

55
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,300
It’s useless.

56
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,160
If they really do repel each other,

57
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:53,890
just scrap her former martial arts.

58
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,100
The new should replace the old.

59
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:08,270
The key to be a free strong person

60
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:09,920
lies not in the success of civil,

61
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:11,680
nor in the force,

62
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,020
but in your heart.

63
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,320
Fei.

64
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,200
If you are still alive,

65
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,590
please hang in there

66
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,040
until I find you.

67
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,830
Someone gave it to me.

68
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,410
I don’t know where to put it.

69
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:48,720
It will be easy to wear it.

70
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:04,810
Mr. Xie,

71
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:06,880
my heelers found that

72
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,790
the people of Blessed Dog are still
searching the city.

73
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,920
They are still searching?

74
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,430
Yes.

75
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:15,600
That means

76
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:18,480
they haven’t found the survivor in

77
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,430
the Wu’s.

78
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:21,820
They also didn’t get what they want.

79
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:25,290
He must be helped by a master

80
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:27,400
to be able to hide for so long.

81
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,820
Could it be…?

82
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:49,940
Fei, you’re awake.

83
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,670
Why can’t I feel any of my force?

84
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,000
I’ve blocked two of your
internal forces for now.

85
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,580
How do you feel?

86
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,900
For now?

87
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,210
Yeah. Just for now.

88
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,380
After you have enough rest,

89
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,320
I will get rid of your force.

90
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,250
Then you can join my sect successfully.

91
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:26,440
I never said I’ll be your student.

92
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,600
Yellow and Green Palm is unparalleled
in the world.

93
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,420
Isn’t it good to be my student?

94
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,200
What’s more, with your condition now,

95
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:34,450
if you don’t get something new,

96
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,100
you will be dead.

97
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,170
Yellow and Green Palm is nothing!

98
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,350
You don’t even deserve to carry
the shoes of our South Blade!

99
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,590
I don’t want any of your things.

100
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,200
Do you dare say it again?

101
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,640
What if I say it ten times?

102
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,320
Madam! Madam!

103
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,120
Young Master is waiting for you.

104
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:57,470
Please go now.

105
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,500
Fei, don’t worry.

106
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,550
She won’t come back

107
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:09,140
after she heard that.

108
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:11,350
Ms. Song,

109
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:13,000
who is the young master you mean?

110
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:15,560
It’s the son of Ms. Duan’s sister.

111
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:17,900
Also, the young master of this mansion.

112
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,440
After she went crazy,

113
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,620
these are the only things and people
she concerns about.

114
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,760
Sister! Sister!

115
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:30,600
Sister!

116
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:33,310
Baoshan, Baoshan…

117
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:39,540
Baoshan is OK.

118
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:43,400
Jiuniang,

119
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,740
I have two things to entrust to you.

120
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,950
I’m willing to

121
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,400
no matter how many they are.

122
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,330
These things

123
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,980
may hurt you.

124
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:57,700
But you are the only

125
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:01,910
family I have in this world.

126
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,250
First,

127
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,410
take good care of this kid

128
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:12,430
and watch him grow up.

129
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,650
Second,

130
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,660
never go to disturb Zhu.

131
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,810
I have written a letter to him.

132
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,830
He will take care of you

133
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:28,440
and the kid.

134
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:41,230
Sister! Sister! Sister!

135
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:48,350
Ms. Zhou,

136
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:50,110
Madam gave you the spirit

137
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:51,180
is for your own good.

138
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,940
Why do you…

139
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,320
Where… Where was

140
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,550
Ms. Wang buried?

141
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,060
Just behind you.

142
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,520
The walking stick was broken.

143
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,250
I fixed it.

144
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:37,810
Ms. Wang, don’t stop me.

145
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,080
My father was killed by him.

146
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,880
The rebellion that year was because
of the Demons Manor.

147
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,960
The Reason why Jinrong

148
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,030
never mentioned the rebellion

149
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,590
before you

150
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:52,410
is that she doesn’t want you to grow up
with hatred.

151
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,800
Don’t grow up with hatred.

152
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,630
Ms. Wang,

153
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:17,740
I got you killed.

154
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,960
It’s not for you to drink.

155
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,070
It’s for the memorial ceremony.

156
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:46,350
Only this little?

157
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:47,340
It’s far from enough.

158
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:49,590
Just to show your sincerity.

159
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,610
Boy,

160
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:58,520
where are you from?

161
00:11:59,400 --> 00:11:59,960
I…

162
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,480
Wait. Don’t say it now.

163
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:03,180
Let me guess.

164
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,930
Well, I can’t.

165
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:11,000
-I…
-Wait!

166
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,670
Give me another chance.

167
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:15,670
I think you are…

168
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:18,640
Forget it. Just tell me.

169
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,790
Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

170
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,520
I’m… Li Sheng.

171
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,140
Fortress of the Forty-Eight again?

172
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,640
What do you mean by “again”?

173
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,910
Have you ever met any other people

174
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:31,350
from there?

175
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:33,030
Any?

176
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:34,400
I met a lot of you guys!

177
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,790
I even gave a girl

178
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,800
of your sect a “Tao Teh King”.

179
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:45,880
A girl?

180
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:48,350
Yeah, a girl,

181
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:50,470
who seems to be at the same age as you.

182
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:52,710
But her martial art
is better than yours.

183
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:56,080
Could it be Zhou Fei?

184
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,790
She is really called Zhou Fei!

185
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,700
Young boy,

186
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,310
you’re not as strong as her,

187
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,280
but you

188
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,400
are righteous

189
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,190
and from a famous sect.

190
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,280
I think you can come back with me
to Qi School.

191
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,320
We have a lot of treasures for you.

192
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:19,540
Thanks for saving me.

193
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:21,910
But I have been outside for long

194
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:23,130
and so many things happened.

195
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,150
I have to go back to the Fortress

196
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,610
to report to Auntie.

197
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,280
And wait for

198
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:30,450
her disposal.

199
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:35,150
Are you really not going with me?

200
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:42,960
I do have good things for you.

201
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,710
No.

202
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:47,670
I need to go back first.

203
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:49,640
I’ll come to you later.

204
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,910
You know where Qi School is?

205
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:53,320
No.

206
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,200
Then how will you come to me?

207
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:58,550
But,

208
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:00,590
I still have to go back first.

209
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:06,690
Sir, what’s wrong?

210
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:10,910
My leg got hurt

211
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:12,910
while I was helping you.

212
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:14,200
Let me have a check.

213
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:14,840
No.

214
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,150
Don’t bother.

215
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:17,740
I know what’s wrong with me.

216
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:22,880
I can tell that you value righteousness

217
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,200
and are grateful.

218
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,150
But my leg…

219
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,200
Go. Just go.

220
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,800
You should go back now.

221
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:49,880
Well, let me send you back first.

222
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:59,200
How could I do that?

223
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,470
Thank you then.

224
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:05,590
Sir.

225
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:07,190
I will go to Huo’s Manor.

226
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,110
(Tao Teh King)

227
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:15,940
I didn’t expect that this is

228
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:17,660
still with me.

229
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,490
What’s this?

230
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,810
It’s given by Mr. Chongxiaozi.

231
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:28,150
Tao Teh King.

232
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:32,200
The handwriting is so terrible.

233
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,530
It’s even worse than mine.

234
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:37,880
This is like a big goat.

235
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,480
This is like a leaf.

236
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,960
This… is like

237
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,520
a chicken standing on only one leg.

238
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,230
Why did he give me this?

239
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,350
Dot stroke, short vertical stroke.

240
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:55,400
Dot stroke to step forward.

241
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:56,840
Short vertical stroke to step backward.

242
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,560
Walk around the stone,
with more than one enemy.

243
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:08,720
Mayfly Formation?

244
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:17,110
The formation can be drawn.

245
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:17,960
But the movements

246
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,790
can’t be stated clearly with
only some strokes.

247
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:25,350
Could it be…?

248
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,400
What’s wrong?

249
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,300
This…

250
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:36,640
This seems to be…

251
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,400
Can you read it?

252
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:48,210
Of course I know the characters on it.

253
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,270
But, what’s the meaning
of these patterns?

254
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:51,780
These patterns…

255
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,830
It’s Mayfly Formation.

256
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,680
It’s internal force.

257
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,390
Be careful.

258
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,120
It will be dangerous
if anything goes wrong.

259
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,090
Don’t act rashly. Don’t!

260
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:08,190
What if I just give it a try?

261
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:09,680
Anyway, if things go on like this,

262
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,110
I will be either dead in Huarong

263
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,520
or lose my martial arts

264
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,110
only to survive.

265
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:15,780
It can’t go any worse.

266
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,520
Fengfu,

267
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,310
through Lingtai

268
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,570
to Mingguan.

269
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:28,900
Fei,

270
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,430
what’s wrong?

271
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:34,800
Let me help you.

272
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:43,900
My force is sealed up.

273
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:45,610
But why do I feel that

274
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:48,300
it’s being pulled out little by little?

275
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,910
The two forces are like having a fight.

276
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:59,580
(Restrain Yourself Return to Propriety)

277
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:04,900
(Huo’s Manor)

278
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:30,520
Have you found it?

279
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:32,310
Junior Master, we have
searched everywhere.

280
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:33,350
Nothing was found.

281
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:33,980
Good-for-nothing!

282
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:34,460
Get lost!

283
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,070
Yes.

284
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:53,000
Where is the Seal of Cautiousness?

285
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:58,190
(Huo Changfeng Huo’s Manor)
What on earth do you want?

286
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,470
Brother,

287
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:03,830
give me the Seal of Cautiousness

288
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:05,000
and I’ll take you away.

289
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,470
It’s not safe here.

290
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:08,230
Let me take you to hide.

291
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,190
This is my house.

292
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,560
I won’t go anywhere.

293
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,800
The time for me to be awake

294
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:19,950
throughout the day is
getting less and less.

295
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:22,120
Brother,

296
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,740
the poison of Pathetic Clam is hard
to be dealt with,

297
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:27,700
but if you come with me

298
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:29,700
and after I become the leader,

299
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,410
I will find every antidote
in the world for you.

300
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,850
A loser like you is dreaming

301
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,140
of becoming the leader?

302
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:44,450
How arrogant!

303
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,950
I’ve had enough, too.

304
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:53,070
In the last days of my life,

305
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:57,000
I just want to stay with Huo’s Manor

306
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:00,880
and my roses.

307
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,190
My roses…

308
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:21,640
I do have one thing to ask

309
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:23,350
this time I come here.

310
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,710
Days ago,

311
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:26,560
Zheng Luosheng showed off to me

312
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,760
a scabbard that he treasured.

313
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,230
It was said to be

314
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,950
related to a secret treasure

315
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:33,380
and something with ripple pattern.

316
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,400
It occurred to me that the

317
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,710
Seal of Cautiousness with you
has that pattern.

318
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:43,710
So I came here especially to tell…

319
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:44,300
Xiaoqiao,

320
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:49,560
it’s been years.

321
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,710
But you mentioned
the ripple pattern directly.

322
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:56,300
Are you here just for the seal?

323
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,380
Please don’t get me wrong.

324
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:01,480
I am here because

325
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:04,350
Zheng Luosheng once said that

326
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,430
there is a shocking secret

327
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,990
behind that thing with ripple pattern.

328
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,190
I’m worried that you will

329
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:13,850
be in trouble because of the seal.

330
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:16,900
So I came by to remind you.

331
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,870
-Brother!
-Just leave.

332
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,590
You’d rather stay with the stupid roses

333
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:23,560
than leave with me?

334
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,710
Seal of Cautiousness!

335
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,280
Seal of Cautiousness!

336
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,000
I have been finding it for years.

337
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,400
But it’s just right here!

338
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,230
No wonder you stay with the roses
all the time.

339
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:54,430
You’re afraid that you will forget

340
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:57,280
where the seal is
after a long time, right?

341
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:00,350
It’s useless for you to take it.

342
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:03,040
-Give it back to me!
-Well, Brother…

343
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,190
Give me that!

344
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:06,280
I wonder where the ripple pattern

345
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,400
is on the seal.

346
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,430
None of your business!

347
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:12,400
As long as I have the seal,

348
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,400
I will find the pattern one day!

349
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,350
Liantao,

350
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:18,950
both of us can’t know that secret!

351
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:26,820
(Cautiousness)

352
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,400
Many things are involved!

353
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,680
Go away!

354
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:35,470
The seal

355
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:37,920
can’t be touched by ordinary people.

356
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:41,350
Don’t make a huge mistake!

357
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,070
Seal of Cautiousness!

358
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:46,560
Come back!

359
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,110
Come back…

360
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,430
Seal of Cautiousness…

361
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,710
Changfeng!

362
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,350
Come here.

363
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:13,180
Changfeng, what happened?

364
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,200
You are too late.

365
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,070
The Seal of Cautiousness

366
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:22,640
was taken away by my

367
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:23,860
evil brother.

368
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,040
We can find it back later.

369
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:29,280
Right.

370
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,110
You have to find it back.

371
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:33,950
It’s really important.

372
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:34,920
OK.

373
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,470
It’s

374
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:40,520
up to you now.

375
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,520
Don’t worry,

376
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,710
I won’t let you down.

377
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,590
What are you finding?

378
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:52,160
Where are my roses?

379
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:54,880
Here.

380
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,130
Look.

381
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:57,430
Over here.

382
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:58,880
My roses.

383
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,520
-My roses.
-Here.

384
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,000
You saved my life.

385
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,660
No matter how you scold me
and drive me away,

386
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,710
I’ll never complain.

387
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:19,790
As long as you give me the words,

388
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:21,380
I, Mu Xiaoqiao,

389
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:24,060
will always

390
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,130
be at your disposal.

391
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,640
I don’t need that.

392
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:29,980
Leave now!

393
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:51,470
Changfeng!

394
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:54,380
Changfeng!

395
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:01,830
Sir…

396
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,870
He has been poisoned for long

397
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:05,820
and got too excited.

398
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,840
I’m afraid no one can save him.

399
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:10,860
Changfeng!

400
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:13,970
My buddy.

401
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:17,380
Changfeng!

402
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,200
Master!

403
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,260
Almost everyone in the Huo’s Manor
has left!

404
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,580
(Huarong Granny Cao’s Incense Shop)

405
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:51,040
The two forces stopped fighting…

406
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:53,310
-…and blended together!
-Fei,

407
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:54,760
how do you feel?

408
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,190
But…

409
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:58,350
The Yellow and Green Spirit
is too bullying.

410
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:00,070
I still need some time.

411
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,680
Mr. Bai,

412
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,920
we will start our next plan.

413
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:14,280
Spread out all hands in Demons Manor.

414
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,920
Mr. Xie,

415
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:26,640
you’re drawing…

416
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:29,760
General Wu Fei’s daughter.

417
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:35,590
We use Miss Wu’s face

418
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:36,800
to distract Qiu Tianjin,

419
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,680
take advantage of the chaos

420
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,760
to help the one they are finding escape

421
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,280
and annihilate them at one stroke.

422
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:45,160
Mr. Xie,

423
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,680
you really have many good ideas.

424
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,160
Thank you.

425
00:26:57,580 --> 00:27:02,420
(Huo’s Manor)

426
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:14,470
Master,

427
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:15,430
it’s not in the room.

428
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,230
Lord,

429
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:20,680
we have searched everywhere here.

430
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,830
We found nothing.

431
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:31,680
Where are you from?
You look like a mess.

432
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,520
Sixth Lord, Head Lord,

433
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:36,310
the people we left in Huarong

434
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:37,100
are all dead.

435
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,430
All dead?

436
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,860
The big shot hidden in Huarong
took actions?

437
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:45,110
No.

438
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:47,070
It was Blessed Dog.

439
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:50,830
Qiu Tianjin?

440
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,280
Why?

441
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,190
When did you offend him?

442
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:54,830
I have told you…

443
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:55,640
No!

444
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,470
We obeyed your order

445
00:27:57,470 --> 00:27:59,830
and only searched in secret in and
out of the city.

446
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:01,510
We’re never in the way of Third Lord.

447
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,250
Go back to Huarong.

448
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:10,230
I’d like to see what Qiu Tianjin

449
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,400
is going to do.

450
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,710
Brother, I…

451
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:14,760
Let me go back with you.

452
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:15,830
Don’t bother.

453
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:18,830
Qiu Tianjin can’t cause big trouble.

454
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:20,950
You go back to report first.

455
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,280
Lord,

456
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:23,950
what about Huo Liantao?

457
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,760
Since the thing is gone,

458
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,440
it must be taken away by Huo Liantao.

459
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:33,390
Catch him.

460
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:34,990
Yes.

461
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:57,940
Who is that?

462
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,110
She is just a bandit.

463
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,260
I will go.

464
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:34,410
It’s so cold.

465
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:38,940
Come here.

466
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,550
Do you feel better now?

467
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,880
No. It’s still cold.

468
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,190
So cold.

469
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,800
Let me get you some fire.

470
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,640
Wait for me.

471
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:56,540
There is no charcoal.

472
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:01,160
I have to go out so get some.

473
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,260
Fei,

474
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,110
if you are still alive,

475
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:12,020
where are you hiding?

476
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:16,910
The places haven’t been searched.

477
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,640
One

478
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,940
is the place where dead bodies are.

479
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:25,310
Homeless bodies are usually placed

480
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:26,860
in temples.

481
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:38,310
Puning Temple?

482
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:40,930
The other is

483
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:44,000
the place their own people will be.

484
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,860
(Puning Temple)

485
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:49,760
House of the county government.

486
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:55,040
Third Lord.

487
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:56,920
How is it going?

488
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,520
We searched the houses and shops,

489
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,920
but we didn’t find the people we want.

490
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:01,400
Bastards!

491
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,300
Third Lord!

492
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,380
Third Lord!

493
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:11,590
Everything goes bad.

494
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:13,070
He still comes to disturb.

495
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:13,770
Let him leave.

496
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,520
You must have had a tiring day.

497
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,680
I asked the cooks

498
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:24,110
to prepare you some snacks and drinks.

499
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:25,350
It will quench your thirst.

500
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:27,560
Mr. Zhu, Third Lord doesn’t need that.

501
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,830
But I prepared that especially for you.

502
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:32,430
Our cooks all have good cooking skills.

503
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:34,280
I said we don’t need it.

504
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,400
Please go.

505
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:36,900
Wait.

506
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:46,450
Third Lord.

507
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:55,470
Turns out

508
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,710
we missed one place.

509
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,520
Come here.

510
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:28,280
Why are you running?

511
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,650
Didn’t you hear me?

512
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:33,210
Young Master!

513
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,120
Mr. Zhu’s son

514
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,730
is also the kid of Ms. Duan’s sister.

515
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,280
We can’t stay here any longer.

516
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:52,990
What should we do?

517
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,280
Why is she running?

518
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,640
Young Master, we got a new
batch of maids.

519
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,800
They don’t know the rules.

520
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:05,160
Don’t get mad at them.

521
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,110
She has a pretty face

522
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:07,640
but is so impolite.

523
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,360
Young Master!

524
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:11,470
Young Master!

525
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:13,040
The Third Lord of Demons Manor

526
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,280
is at the gate,

527
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,880
saying he has something to do.

528
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:16,640
Third Lord?

529
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,520
I don’t want to meet him.

530
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,520
Young Master,

531
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,950
we can’t offend him.

532
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:22,800
Even Master is adulatory to him.

533
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,230
I think you have to meet him.

534
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:26,310
My dad is also there?

535
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:42,140
(No reserve in majesty)

536
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:45,560
Third Lord.

537
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,230
All the people here
have been summoned.

538
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:48,350
They will be here soon.

539
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:50,160
Please wait a moment.

540
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:53,880
Would you care for some tea?

541
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:56,160
No need.

542
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:04,940
(No reserve in majesty)

543
00:34:21,910 --> 00:34:24,280
Fei,

544
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:30,670
are you ready?

545
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:33,430
Let me take you out together.

546
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,150
Fei,

547
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:42,280
-Snow-breaking Blade has nine movements.
-Wufeng?

548
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,000
Everyone has his own understanding.

549
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:44,760
You are…

550
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,360
Mine is Wufeng.

551
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,360
Your mother’s is Wupi.

552
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,430
Grandpa?

553
00:34:49,430 --> 00:34:50,760
So is yours.

554
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:54,080
Don’t be limited to only one movement.

555
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,430
Follow the force in your body

556
00:34:56,430 --> 00:34:59,280
then you can use the sword freely.

557
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:02,760
Fei, have a try.

558
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:05,300
Follow the force in my body.

559
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:08,620
Don’t be limited to only one movement.

560
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:25,730
Again!

561
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:28,940
Draw!

562
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:33,880
Close!

563
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:39,540
Combine!

564
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,390
Point!

565
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:43,770
In!

566
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,060
It’s been two hours.

567
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,500
They must have found Miss Chuchu
in disguise.

568
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:52,260
Then the information will be spread out.

569
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,440
Fei,

570
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:56,470
if you can hear me,

571
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:58,260
remember to reply.

572
00:35:59,280 --> 00:35:59,980
Stop!

573
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,710
Get her!

574
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:05,000
Get her!

575
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,000
-Stop there!
-Make a way!

576
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,670
Stop running!

577
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:14,340
(No reserve in majesty)

578
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,120
Third Lord,

579
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,430
we found them.

580
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:22,910
Everyone, assemble in the front yard.

581
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:25,190
Hurry up. You two, be quick.

582
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:26,910
You! Don’t be slow.

583
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:28,040
-Hurry up!
-Be quick!

584
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:29,150
Sir.

585
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:31,080
People from Demons Manor?
It’s not a safe place now.

586
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,280
I have to tell Fei.

587
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,040
Sir, we found something ahead.

588
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,390
Everyone, withdraw!

589
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:39,520
Why do they leave suddenly?

590
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,190
Oh, no, I have to tell Fei.

591
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:41,870
What’s going on?

592
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:42,670
I don’t know.

593
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:44,560
Are they the people from Demons Manor?

594
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,710
Why are they in our mansion?

595
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,150
Third Lord.

596
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,190
Let’s go.

597
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:54,360
Yes.

598
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,560
Take care. Have a good day.

599
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,760
You! What are you doing?

600
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,950
I’m a new comer.

601
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:10,150
Come over here.

602
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:16,080
How could you walk around?

603
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:17,520
You,

604
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,950
take this new maid

605
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:19,710
to bring back Madam’s

606
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:21,710
new clothes outside the mansion.

607
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:22,910
If there is any delay,

608
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:24,150
watch out for your life!

609
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:26,890
-Yes.
-Yes.

610
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:28,950
Go now.

611
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,670
Are you sure it’s Ms. Wu?

612
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:36,560
It can’t be wrong.

613
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,390
Then go get her!

614
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:39,120
Yes!

615
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,360
You two, come with me!

616
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,190
Yes!

617
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,560
Sis,

618
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:58,520
I… I heard the city is in chaos now.

619
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,320
How about

620
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,430
we ask for some servants

621
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:01,560
to go with us?

622
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,360
Look at you!

623
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,630
Why bother to be afraid?

624
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:06,280
We’re from the county government.

625
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,390
No matter how messy it is,

626
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:08,910
it has nothing to do with us.

627
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:09,950
Just go.

628
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,710
What are you doing?

629
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:27,950
Come on.

630
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:29,760
You’re so dilatory.

631
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:36,670
Stop there!

632
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:38,760
Don’t run!

633
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,520
Stop!

634
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,360
Get her!

635
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:44,320
-Don’t run!
-Stop!

636
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:48,950
Stop running!

637
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:50,040
Step aside!

638
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,560
Step aside!

639
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:14,470
Third Lord.

640
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:15,760
Third Lord.

641
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:16,950
Third Lord.

642
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:18,470
The girl ran along the houses

643
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:19,760
to the wine workshop!

644
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,120
Get her!

645
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:24,910
Yes!

646
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:34,150
What’s the matter in such a hurry?

647
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,520
I thought carefully

648
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:39,390
and found something weird.

649
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:40,430
What is it?

650
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:43,280
A maid looked strange just now.

651
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,470
It occurred to me

652
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:46,290
that I have never seen her.

653
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,390
Is she the one

654
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:49,900
those people are looking for?

655
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,390
Where is she?

656
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,230
I asked her to go to the cloth shop.

657
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,150
-Young Master.
-Young Master.

658
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:00,560
What are you talking about?

659
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,950
Sir, have a look.

660
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:07,280
These are the superior clothes.

661
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:10,430
Yeah.

662
00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:12,520
(Yunxiang Cloth Shop)
Your wife will like it.

663

665

(Yunxiang Cloth Shop)
You can pick some.

666
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,280
There are more patterns.

667
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:19,870
Go get it.

668
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:24,710
Come on. Go.

669
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:26,040
Go now.

670
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,950
What are you waiting for?

671
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:30,040
Have a look!

672
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,080
-So stupid.
-Figured cloth!

673
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,470
I’ll be waiting for you here.

(Yunxiang Cloth Shop)

675
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,560
Figured cloth!

676
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,320
Superb figured cloth!

677
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:47,630
Just like before,

678
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:49,080
our people were taken to a remote place

679
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,120
and got killed while following.

680
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:53,360
He was killed in the same way.

681
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:55,150
Third Lord,

682
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:56,910
Childe Zhu has something to report.

683
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,150
Third Lord,

684
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,840
there is a strange maid in my home,

685
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,560
which looks like the one you want.

686
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:06,840
Where is she now?

687
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,840
The steward said

688
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,910
she went to the cloth shop.

689
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:09,470
Guan Shen.

690
00:41:09,470 --> 00:41:10,280
Yes.

691
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:12,360
Take some people to the cloth shop.

692
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,080
Yes.

693
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:13,580
This way.

694
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:25,430
Boss,

695
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:27,080
are the clothes ready?

696
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,710
Madam is still waiting.

697
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:29,870
There is still a little bit.

698
00:41:29,870 --> 00:41:31,380
Stop urging me.

699
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:39,950
It’s still not ready?

700
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:41,190
Almost. Wait a moment.

701
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:51,910
Sir,

702
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:52,950
I need to use the toilet.

703
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:54,710
In the back yard.

704
00:41:55,230 --> 00:41:56,760
I will put the things here.

705
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:00,360
Here is it.

706
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,360
No. I know her. She is Cui.

707
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,280
Where is the girl with you?

708
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,080
Inside the shop.

709
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:13,040
Where is she?

710
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:13,670
Who do you mean?

711
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:14,040
You…

712
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,470
The girl to get the clothes!

713
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:17,800
In the back yard.

714
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:19,150
In the back yard!

715
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:19,950
Get her!

716
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:35,150
Stop there!

717
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:37,470
Don’t run!

718
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:39,190
Stop there!

719
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:47,470
Step aside!

720
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:48,710
Stop running!

721
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:53,600
Someone pretended to be me
to distract them.

722
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:55,720
I see!

723
00:42:56,190 --> 00:42:57,570
It must be Xie.

724
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,910
Lord ordered days ago

725
00:43:02,910 --> 00:43:04,710
to make more food for Madam.

726
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:07,390
She is in a good state lately

727
00:43:07,390 --> 00:43:08,670
and can eat a lot.

728
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:09,910
Please make more food for her meals.

729
00:43:09,910 --> 00:43:11,230
More food?

730
00:43:11,230 --> 00:43:13,760
-I wondered where the girl was hiding.
-Call me anytime if you need help.

731
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,470
Something must be wrong.

732
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:16,300
I should go have a check.

733
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:55,670
Isn’t she the fierce girl

734
00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:57,910
in the Inn?

735
00:43:57,910 --> 00:44:00,230
She is the one they are looking for?

736
00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:12,470
Why is a girl missing?

737
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:17,910
Get up! How dare you steal things.

738
00:44:17,910 --> 00:44:19,870
Madam, what’s up?

739
00:44:25,950 --> 00:44:27,800
I got a thief.

740
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:29,980
Madam, this is Baoshan.

741
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:52,340
Mr. Xie.

742
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:53,690
Where is Fei?

743
00:44:55,390 --> 00:44:56,720
Let’s go first. I will tell you later.

744
00:45:16,670 --> 00:45:17,320
Stop there!

745
00:45:21,670 --> 00:45:23,600
Ms. Duan! Please wait!

746
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:24,760
This is Mr. Xie.

747
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:25,780
He is Fei’s friend.

748
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:29,760
Ms. Duan, sorry for being rude.

749
00:45:30,190 --> 00:45:31,760
Chuchu, where is Fei?

750
00:45:32,470 --> 00:45:34,740
Fei got hurt. She is in the room.

751
00:45:39,150 --> 00:45:41,210
Is he… her lover?
