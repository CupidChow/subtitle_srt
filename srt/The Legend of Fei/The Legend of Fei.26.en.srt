-Pull back!
-Pull back!

Here he is!

72
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,220
Be careful.

73
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:10,780
Pull.

74
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:11,730
Pull.

75
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:20,380
Sheng.

76
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:22,250
Are you all right?

77
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,850
Aunt.

78
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:25,570

The Fortress.

80
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:29,780
Are the enemies repelled?

81
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:31,660
Yes.

82
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:40,850
I’ll take some sleep.

83
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:47,500
Go ahead.

84
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,620
Take good care of Sheng.

85
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:59,820
I’m going to find things out.

86
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,050
My father always said

87
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:44,400
this blade was a legacy.

88
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:47,740
It means to be.

89
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:58,300
Mother.

90
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,780
Don’t move.

91
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,930
You injured internally.

92
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:12,690
You’ll be fine soon.

93
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:16,930
Certainly Ma Jili won’t hit you hard.

94
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:25,570
What happened with your inner power?

95
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:28,740
Who did you meet before?

96
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:31,100
I... A long story.

97
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,250
I met Duan Jiuniang at Huarong.

98
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:37,100
She transfused Yellow and Green Spirit
into my system,

99
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:40,420
and told me about her past with Grandpa.

100
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,390
She is a true master.

101
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:46,900
You were lucky to meet her.

102
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:49,610
Mother.

103
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:50,900
Li Sheng...

104
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:51,780
He’s fine.

105
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:55,040
Chuchu found him

106
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:57,280
hanging under the Feihong Bridge.

107
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:02,250
Just mind your own business.

108
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:05,010
Mother.

109
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:10,340
Where is Xie who came back with me?

110
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:14,220
Do you know who he is?

111
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,690
I do.

112
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:18,570
He travels around in the world,

113
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:20,860
and makes a living by selling songs.

114
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:23,180
With two mustaches,

115
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:25,130
he’s nicknamed Qian Suiyou.

116
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:28,900
Back then

117
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,690
he trespassed Ximo River

118
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:32,150
and was supposed to be punished,

119
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,020
but he was ordered to do so.

120
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:38,050
-Thanks to him, we could...
-Save it.

121
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:39,810
Leave his matters aside.

122
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,250
Take a good rest

123
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,740
and get recovered first.

124
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:46,980
Then explain to me

125
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,220
what you have done during your travel.

126
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:24,310
Time is running out.

127
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:57,010
Aren’t you dead?

128
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:58,370
I am not that easy...

129
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:00,130
to get killed.

130
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,130
You...

131
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:17,130
Nice blade.

132
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:18,660
Do you like it?

133
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,080
But you can’t take it.

134
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,810
I mean,

135
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:27,490
you are more talented
and have better understanding

136
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:28,860
in martial arts.

137
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,130
Over so many years,

138
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:34,980
I’ve been trying to catch up with you,

139
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:37,540
but I can’t.

140
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:39,570
I’m reluctant to fall behind.

141
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:47,570
Don’t gloat.

142
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:52,050
Listen to me.

143
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:53,740
The saying has that

144
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:54,660
he who laughs last,

145
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:57,010
laughs best.

146
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:58,780
You’re better than me now,

147
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:01,660
but soon I’ll surpass you.

148
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:05,690
Alright.

149
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:06,930
Wait and see.

150
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:14,930
Have... Have some tea.

151
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,610
It’s hot.

152
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:50,050
Thank you, Brother.

153
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:01,660
Who was talking with me?

154
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,490
I didn’t hear it clearly.

155
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:09,610
Brother.

156
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:15,370
Take a good rest.

157
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:20,570
I’ve got goose bumps.

158
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:10,450
What is Cloud-impelling Palm?

159
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:13,010
He is so powerful.

160
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:15,780
But why did he follow me
all the way here?

161
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:40,130
What is the tune?

162
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:43,250
Depart in Departure Sorrow Pavilion.

163
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:47,370
You’ve heard it a lot along the way.

164
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:48,810
Why asking again?

165
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:57,250
I come to see you.

166
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:58,660
Can I come into

167
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,180
your room?

168
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,540
You can’t.

169
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:06,340
Something is wrong with my ears.

170
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,250
I can’t hear some words clearly.

171
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,860
Since you say I can,

172
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,740
I’ll come in.

173
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,930
Thanks. Come on.

174
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:18,100
Come on in. Be seated.

175
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:20,220
We are not strangers.

176
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:21,810
No need to receive me outside.

177
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:22,860
Sit.

178
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,220
Miss.

179
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:36,340
Why are you staring at me like that?

180
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:40,930
I’m handsome.

181
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:42,250
You should pay money

182
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:43,780
if you keep watching.

183
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:44,980
No money.

184
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,450
You can watch me, too.

185
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:47,610
You...

186
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:56,220
What?

187
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,570
I find that

188
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,940
the more worried you are,

189
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,610
the happier you look.

190
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:09,330
Yet you talk in a serious way

191
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,540
when you feel relaxed.

192
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:21,580
Is there

193
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:23,120
anything you want to ask me?

194
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:27,250
Shen Tianshu said
you used Could-impelling Palm.

195
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,760
What is that?

196
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,370
You have top martial arts.

197
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:33,850
How come you were bullied

198
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:35,900
by a gang of rascals?

199
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,730
Moreover,

200
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:39,850
what is the Color of Ocean and Heaven
that you are after?

201
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,460
Xie Yun.

202
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,420
Why do you have

203
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:46,010
so many secrets?

204
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:51,420
Judging from your look,

205
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:53,250
you must be thinking

206
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,940
how to fool me with your lies.

207
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:57,490
I won’t ask.

208
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,010
No.

209
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:07,850
OK.

210
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:09,060
I’m leaving

211
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,330
if you don’t.

212
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:17,940
By the way.

213
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,580
Take this back.

214
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:38,580
Things are done.

215
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,210
You can take it back.

216
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:44,300
When Miss Wu asks about it,

217
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,610
you can explain.

218
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:58,130
What is it?

219
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:17,320
Xie Yun.

220
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:21,050
Are you pretending nothing happened?

221
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:25,900
You...

222
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:27,820
You...

223
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:31,970
Where will you stay?

224
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,250
The guest room here.

225
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:39,130
This place is indeed a wonderland.

226
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:41,490
It’s cool and pleasing in summer.

227
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:42,720
I want to stay a while longer.

228
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:45,300
Get yourself recovered.

229
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,180
Then

230
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:48,490
take me to have a tour around.

231
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:50,850
You know the scenes here

232
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:52,540
better than me, don’t you?

233
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:54,250
You are acting.

234
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:03,890
That’s not like what you would say.

235
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:06,780
What should I say then?

236
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:09,130
Should I say you may
put on some weight

237
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:10,490
and be my princess?

238
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,180
Are you all right?

239
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:32,730
Of course.

240
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:34,090
I’m absolutely fine.

241
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:37,210
Why are you after
the Color of Ocean and Heaven?

242
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:43,210
I don’t want it to fall into
the wrong hands.

243
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:49,490
Since you’ve known it,

244
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:51,610
I can tell you the truth.

245
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:57,090
Chuchu’s Longevity Lock,

246
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,530
the Mountain Sword’s scabbard.

247
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:00,810
And your family’s gold bracelet.

248
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:02,730
These are

249
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:04,690
important items to open
the Color of Ocean and Heaven.

250
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,370
Alright.

251
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:10,460
Stop asking.

252
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:12,580
You have so many questions.

253
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:15,700
Xie Yun.

254
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:37,900
I...

255
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:43,970
I won’t be so impulsive again.

256
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:50,450
I’ll tell you wherever I go.

257
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:53,660
I’ll talk to you first.

258
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:58,850
How is it?

259
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:04,180
Sure.

260
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:05,940
Anything else?

261
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:09,200
And...

262
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:24,460
No more.

263
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:26,570
I thought you’d hold back for some days.

264
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:54,660
I knew you couldn’t help asking me

265
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:55,780
and caring about me.

266
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:01,730
But in this way,

267
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:03,330
I’ll know, in your heart,

268
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:05,300
I mean something to you.

269
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:15,210
I’m just meddlesome, maybe.

270
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:23,270
Why bother to come here?

271
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:05,550
Chuchu.

272
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:06,870
Sheng.

273
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,300
I... I come to see

274
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:18,730
if you get better.

275
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:20,900
I... I’m much better.

276
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:25,090
Sorry

277
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:26,660
to let you worry.

278
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:34,830
Now

279
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:37,970
you are safe here.

280
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:40,030
Your brother

281
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:43,010
is out alone.

282
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:44,540
It’s worrisome.

283
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:46,420
Why don’t you get him here

284
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:48,180
to be with you?

285
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:49,730
You can take care of each other.

286
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:57,900
It’s fine if you don’t agree.

287
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:58,930
I agree.

288
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:07,820
Are you back alive shamelessly?

289
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:09,820
He’s my man.

290
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:12,850
You have no right to punish him.

291
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,660
Tianxian.

292
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:18,580
Rise.

293
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:28,780
Lord Shen.

294
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:31,010
How do you explain it?

295
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:37,540
My men were about to break through
the gate.

296
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:39,580
Who ordered

297
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,780
to pull back?

298
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:44,060
I didn’t expect,

299
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:46,730
Shen Tianshu, a top master,

300
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:48,850
the Head of the Demons,

301
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:50,700
could be defeated by a gang of boys

302
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,700
from the Fortress.

303
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:57,090
Who do you mean the boys?

304
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:10,180
I found it weird in Chunhui Town.

305
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:14,180
He should have died.

306
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:15,850
Yet he was alive and kicking,

307
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:19,370
and played the Cloud-impelling Palm.

308
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:22,300
The power of the Palm

309
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:25,240
is impossible for people of his age.

310
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:29,200
No way.

311
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:33,060
He got hit by Bone-chilling
ten years ago.

312
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:35,210
That was the fiercest poison
in the world.

313
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:37,020
It’s incurable.

314
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:40,090
How could he survive?

315
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:42,210
If a great master

316
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:44,700
used his own energy

317
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,090
to resist the poison in his body

318
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:50,060
and save him one life for another,

319
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:53,640
he could have a chance to survive.

320
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:02,600
Xiao Chuan.

321
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:06,020
Are you really so lucky?

322
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,560
Not really.

323
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:15,900
Xiao Chuan survived,

324
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,700
but he couldn’t use his own energy.

325
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:19,920
Once he uses,

326
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:23,610
the poison in his system
will be let loose.

327
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:26,370
His life

328
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:27,780
can only last for months.

329
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:30,500
He used Cloud-impelling Palm
against you.

330
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:34,130
Didn’t he know he’d die?

331
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:35,830
If that’s the case,

332
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:40,370
the attack to the Fortress

333
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:43,250
is worth something.

334
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:50,080
Although we lost some men,

335
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:53,680
Xiao Chuan will die soon.

336
00:27:54,850 --> 00:27:55,970
It’s not bad.

337
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:59,300
Why did he risk his life

338
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:02,540
to protect the Fortress?

339
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:07,370
Is he also after
the Color of Ocean and Heaven?

340
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:11,250
It’s hard to tell.

341
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:13,090
If it’s true,

342
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,730
his men will surely

343
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:18,580
go after other

344
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:20,180
Ripple-shaped objects.

345
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:26,820
Lord Shen.

346
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:29,210
You’re hurt badly.

347
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:32,970
Yet we don’t have much time.

348
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:36,330
I wonder if you can get
the Ripple-shaped objects

349
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:41,010
before then.

350
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:43,540
All my lords are

351
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:46,730
top-notch masters in the world.

352
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:49,420
If you don’t trust us,

353
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:53,060
you can have others do it.

354
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:54,730
Lord Shen.

355
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:57,060
Lord Shen. I’m joking.

356
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:01,300
Wish you a quick recovery.

357
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:04,730
I’m waiting for good news from you.

358
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:31,860
(Tomb tablet)

359
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:37,660
(Mourn)

360
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:06,860
Which is Fisherman’s tomb?

361
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:10,900
He liked to be neat and tidy.

362
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:15,250
(Feng Yuping’s tomb)

363
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:17,540
(Feng Yuping’s tomb)
I’ll come often to see him

364
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:19,490
and weed for him.

365
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:51,700
(Mourn)

366
00:30:58,370 --> 00:30:59,460
Everyone.

367
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:02,250
My fortress survived the attack.

368
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:04,300
It is you who helped us

369
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:05,730
and defended it with your lives.

370
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:07,090
(Tomb tablet)

371
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:08,540
We will never forget

372
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:10,780
what you did for us.

373
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:12,300
Today,

374
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:14,820
the disciples and I

375
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:17,090
pay our last respects to you.

376
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:21,440
The world is full of danger.

377
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:24,940
No one is immune to it.

378
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:27,540
As the code of our sect says,

379
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:30,780
may we live with no regret.

380
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,820
We vow to

381
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:34,940
wipe out the evil.

382
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:37,610
-Save the people,
-Save the people,

383
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:40,060
-and bring justice to the world.
-and bring justice to the world.

384
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:42,580
-We don’t have to be remembered,
-We don’t have to be remembered,

385
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:45,420
-and don’t have to be fairly treated.
-and don’t have to be fairly treated.

386
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:48,250
-We will never fail the Heaven,
-We will never fail the Heaven,

387
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:51,940
-the Gods, and the Fortress.
-the Gods, and the Fortress.

388
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:54,370
-All the sects, together,
-All the sects, together,

389
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:57,940
-we unite as one.
-we unite as one.

390
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:01,540
-All the disciples shall keep the vow.
-All the disciples shall keep the vow.

391
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:22,090
The view here is stunning,
people extraordinary.

392
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:24,700
In a turbulent time,

393
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:27,660
there should be no wonderland like this.

394
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:28,820
Wait, Young Master.

395
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:35,490
Madam asks for you.

396
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:38,250
What’s the matter?

397
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:39,490
You’ll know

398
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:41,010
when you meet her.

399
00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:41,850
Please.

400
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:43,490
Please.

401
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:01,780
Madam. Mr. Xie comes.

402
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:03,850
Please, Mr. Xie.

403
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:12,580
Greetings, Mr. Xie.

404
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:15,180
The Fortress got attacked.

405
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:18,090
The injured are being treated around.

406
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:20,060
It’s inconvenient to talk.

407
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:21,660
So, I ask you to be here.

408
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:23,900
Please don’t mind it.

409
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:25,490
Not at all, Madam.

410
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:27,730
I’m no longer a stranger here.

411
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:30,940
Mr. Xie, you helped us

412
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:33,780
repel the Demons.

413
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:35,180
I’m grateful.

414
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:37,180
My pleasure, Madam.

415
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:38,940
I was just escorting Miss Wu

416
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:41,090
back to the Fortress.

417
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:42,330
We encountered the battle.

418
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:44,300
Given my friendship with Lord Gantang,

419
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:46,420
and also for the righteousness,

420
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:48,490
that’s what I should do.

421
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:51,820
You are young and highly skilled.

422
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:54,730
Who is your master?

423
00:33:57,370 --> 00:33:59,940
I’m nobody.

424
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:01,940
My background doesn’t matter.

425
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:03,610
I just lead a free life

426
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:05,010
as I please.

427
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:10,530
Alright.

428
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:12,130
Where a hero comes from matters not.

429
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:16,050
You saved my daughter.

430
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:17,220
I keep that in mind.

431
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:19,570
If you need help someday,

432
00:34:19,570 --> 00:34:22,530
the Fortress will help you as we can.

433
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:24,050
Thank you, Madam.

434
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:25,610
Miss Zhou fought gallantly

435
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:28,980
to defend the Fortress with the elders.

436
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:31,130
I was afraid to hold her back.

437
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:35,770
Madam.

438
00:34:35,770 --> 00:34:38,050
Please pardon me.

439
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:40,290
Miss Zhou has been
following your example,

440
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:41,460
because she wants to

441
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:43,570
be recognized by you.

442
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:44,610
I suggest

443
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:46,220
you may praise her

444
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:47,480
more often.

445
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:50,530
Thank you, Mr. Xie.

446
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:54,290
By the way,

447
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:56,260
you look kind of pale.

448
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,130
Are you unwell?

449
00:34:58,130 --> 00:34:59,330
Were you injured

450
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:01,610
by the Demons in the battle?

451
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:04,330
No. No. I’m fine.

452
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:05,500
The Fortress

453
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:08,770
is kind of humid. I’m not used to it.

454
00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:10,130
Glad to hear.

455
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:15,020
Take good care of yourself anyway.

456
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:17,290
You are going to leave here.

457
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:19,130
Be safe.

458
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:24,050
Madam Li is kicking me out.

459
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:30,020
This is the token to leave.

460
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:30,660
(Fortress)

461
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:33,810
Have a safe journey.

462
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:40,260
(Fortress)

463
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:43,290
Take care, Madam.

464
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:45,260
I’m leaving.

465
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:11,850
She’s kicking me out.

466
00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:14,020
Time to say goodbye.

467
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:27,180
Chuchu.

468
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,570
Li Yan.

469
00:36:30,850 --> 00:36:32,290
Chuchu.

470
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:34,980
These cakes are from my brother,

471
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:36,980
as a gift for you to move here.

472
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:38,770
You may take here

473
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:40,260
as your home.

474
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:43,570
Thank you.

475
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:45,130
You’re welcome.

476
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:46,610
Chuchu.

477
00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:51,420
My brother said

478
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:54,290
your brother would come here, too.

479
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:56,610
Tell me your childhood stories.

480
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:58,610
Nothing special, actually.

481
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:00,460
I’m serious.

482
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:01,330
Chuchu.

483
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:03,180
I only dare to tell you this.

484
00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:06,050
I want a brother as well.

485
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:07,130
When he comes,

486
00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:09,370
I’ll take him to tour
all over the Fortress.

487
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:11,850
Keep yourself busy.

488
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:21,700
Brother.

489
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:23,610
We can be reunited soon.

490
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:42,090
That guy hit my drowsy acupoint.

491
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:44,570
Did he want to run away?

492
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:07,610
What are you doing?

493
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:11,220
The friends here are so hospitable.

494
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:13,370
I eat too much and take a walk here

495
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:15,420
to digest.

496
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:18,220
And see the moon.

497
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:19,980
There is no moon tonight.

498
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:20,860
What are you looking at?

499
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:23,750
Are you avoiding me?

500
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:25,980
No. No. Absolutely not.

501
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:28,980
Fei. You’re seriously injured.

502
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:31,090
Go back and rest now.

503
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:34,570
I’ve slept the whole day.

504
00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:36,370
My injury is not serious.

505
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:39,050
Come. Let’s go somewhere.

506
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:41,180
Where to?

507
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:01,980
Xie Meimei.

508
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:03,500
I’ve made up my mind.

509
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:06,110
I’ll go with you to look for
the Color of Ocean and Heaven.

510
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:09,130
Why?

511
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:10,900
Because that item is evil.

512
00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:14,460
A rebellion occurred here ten years ago.

513
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:17,980
Now it got the Fortress devastated
again.

514
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,730
The Color of Ocean and Heaven
was the cause.

515
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:22,810
I have to destroy it

516
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:24,530
before I can feel at ease.

517
00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:26,980
Fei.

518
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:28,130
There’s no clue

519

to look for it.

520
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:33,090
For the Lock, Demons burnt the inn.

521
00:39:33,090 --> 00:39:36,050
For the scabbard, Dragon Master
was after us.

522
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:38,770
The Fortress suffered great casualties.

523
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:40,640
Even you nearly got killed.

524
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:42,850
Why bother to do this?

525
00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:44,660
I still have you.

526
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:48,810
You are not a jinx.

527
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:50,440
You are a mascot to me.

528
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:53,290
You got me out of danger so many times.

529
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:54,980
What am I afraid of?

530
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:03,130
What’s wrong?

531
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:04,810
You are numb today.

532
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:06,460
It’s not like you.

533
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:09,810
Nothing.

534
00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:13,530
Maybe it’s too pleasing to live here.

535
00:40:13,530 --> 00:40:14,710
I get idle and lazy.

536
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:17,940
It’s indeed a good place

537
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:19,850
