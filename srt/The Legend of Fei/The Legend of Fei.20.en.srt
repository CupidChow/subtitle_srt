What are you doing?

18
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,910
I have principles!

19
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,310
Help!

20
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,160
No one would pay for your body.

21
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:45,080
Listen.

22
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,480
I want to defeat Yang Jin.

23
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,980
And I want to be the God.

24
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,120
You can tell the defect

of Mr. Chongxiaozi in one glimpse.

26
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,440
You must know it well

27
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,510
how Yang Jin’s
13 Goose-breaking Blades works.

28
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,720
I have no idea.

29
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,550
I heard it from some storytellers.

30
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:07,680
No idea.

31
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:28,160
Please.

32
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:36,440
What did you just say?

33
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,890
I’m begging you.

34
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,880
What’s the point of begging me?

35
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,160
I can’t make you a grand master

36
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,720
overnight.

37
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,600
If I were that capable,

38
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,320
I wouldn’t be a song writer

39
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,450
but a sect founder.

40
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:56,420
You must have got a way.

41
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,670
Tell me all the details

42
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:00,080
about Yang Jin’s blades.

43
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,600
Maybe I should reason with her.

44
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,850
She might shrink back from difficulties.

45
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:10,240
Actually, 13 Goose-breaking Blades

46
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,000
is not that profound.

47
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:14,110
Speaking of which,

48
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:16,700
in fact,

49
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,540
it’s not that scary.

50
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:32,110
There are differences

51
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:33,160
between it and the broadsword play

52
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,630
practiced by you people

53
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,180
from famous schools.

54
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:40,910
If you have great perception,

55
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:42,270
Goose-breaking Blades

56
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:44,680
won’t be your match in ten years.

57
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:50,830
Listen.

58
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:53,570
Go ask Qian Suiyou

59
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:57,080
what Miss Zhou’s plan is.

60
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:57,690
Yes.

61
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:22,160
His blade

62
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,850
is both fast

63
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,270
and heavy.

64
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:26,510
Heavy?

65
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,230
One wave of his blade

66
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,170
is much more faster than my hand.

67
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:36,940
A mediocre martial artist
would parry in a haste

68
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:39,030
when being attacked.

69
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,480
You saw Yang Jin’s blade as well.

70
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,720
It’s extremely heavy.

71
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,750
If he suppresses you with such force,

72
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:47,280
no one can tell if you can hold it.

73
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:49,380
Moreover, you’re injured now.

74
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,570
I can train my speed these days.

75
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:56,600
I know you’re trying
to protect South Blade’s reputation.

76
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,640
That’s why

77
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,950
you should avoid the fight.

78
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:03,640
Now you’re on the right side.

79
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,110
You can take the initiative.

80
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:11,000
Even if your avoidance of fights

81
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,390
gets out,

82
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:14,920
rumors will only have it
that Yang Jin uses indecent tricks.

83
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,200
Everyone might get hurt in a fight.

84
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,230
Why do you have to pick one now?

85
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,670
You’ll have other chances later.

86
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,390
Even if I escape this time,

87
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,110
can I continue my journey

88
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:25,760
with a bubble reputation

89
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,060
as the South Blade?

90
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,790
Then people like Yang Jin

91
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:32,050
will line up to compete with me.

92
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,230
I won’t defeat them even with tricks.

93
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:40,000
But I can still lose with dignity,

94
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,490
which is better than tucking away.

95
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:48,350
Seems like she will go for it.

96
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,350
You’re not as concentrated as Yang Jin,

97
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,550
nor do you have solid skills as he does.

98
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:10,790
Also, you lack the fast broadsword play

99
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:12,980
hammered out with commitment.

100
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,950
Speed is the core of all martial arts.

101
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:17,850
Tell me,

102
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,070
how will you break his blade?

103
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:23,880
Yang Jin has been training himself
for years

104
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:28,940
only for one thing, speed.

105
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,980
But you’re in a different situation.

106
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:35,760
The Lis are profound in broadsword play.

107
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,230
If you lack basic skills,

108
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,350
you won’t even be able to imitate it.

109
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,920
When you studied martial arts
from your parents as a kid,

110
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,670
you must have learned more
than that, right?

111
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:48,880
They taught you other subjects,

112
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,950
didn’t they?

113
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:53,510
You’re well-informed.

114
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:55,390
If you’re observant enough...

115
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:05,760
Can my Snow-breaking Blade

116
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,720
be faster than Yang Jin’s?

117
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,000
I don’t care if I can defeat him.

118
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,510
Xie Yun is right.

119
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:17,320
Being unpredictable is my focus.

120
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,110
I won’t defeat him by speed,

121
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:20,640
but by being unpredictable.

122
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,200
Come with me.

123
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,070
Show me what you said yesterday.

124
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:29,040
Wait.

125
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,670
Are you still studying
Goose-breaking Blades’ defects?

126
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,110
I haven’t had enough sleep.
I’ll sleep for another while.

127
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:39,200
Show me one more time.

128
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,830
I’ll sleep for another while.

129
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:42,160
Just a while.

130
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:56,270
How fast is “faster”?

131
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,070
How heavy is “heavier”?

132
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:07,720
Dig in.

133
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,510
Fei.

134
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:14,000
What’s bothering you?

135
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,950
Fei.

136
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:29,920
Let go.

137
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:32,080
Let go!

138
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:32,790
What are you doing?

139
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:43,550
Pretty.

140
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:45,940
Are you obsessed with the blade?

141
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,210
You are not eating?

142
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:48,510
I’ll have it.

143
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:01,300
(Fenghe Stall)

144
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,520
Sorry for letting you suffer.

145
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,670
This is a chaotic world.

146
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,470
Girls’ dresses would draw attention.

147
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:07,910
It’s more convenient to wear men’s wear.

148
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,520
You’re quite thoughtful.

149
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,670
But it never occurred to me

150
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:14,230
that you look

151
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:15,200
quite handsome

152
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,410
in men’s wear.

153
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:19,320
I’m flattered.

154
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,710
Sir, your pancakes.

155
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,820
This place is undergoing a famine.

156
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,840
Pancakes are the only available food.

157
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,030
Please have it, Miss Chuchu.

158
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:34,840
When we return to the Fortress,

159
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,640
I’ll ask Aunt

160
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,490
to make you some decent food.

161
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:40,050
Sorry for all the sufferings.

162
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:41,760
Mencius said

163
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,550
“thrive in calamity
and perish in pleasure”.

164
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:46,840
The calamity I suffered

165
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,790
made me aware of

166
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:50,110
how hard-won food is.

167
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:51,640
This pancake

168
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,960
would suffice me.

169
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,880
Then have more.

170
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,320
We still have an arduous journey ahead.

171
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,790
God knows

172
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:01,520
where the next meal will be.

173
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:06,640
It’s so hard to make a living.

174
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,200
See, wars never cease these years.

175
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,210
Plus, there are villains robbing grains.

176
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,880
You’d better finish and leave.

177
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,440
Thank you for your tips.

178
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,760
Please have more food.

179
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,030
Mr. Xie.

180
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,880
What martial art is she practicing?

181
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,280
Looks weird.

182
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,910
Why does she close her eyes?

183
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:37,110
It’s odd.

184
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:38,960
This is

185
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,590
called Eye-shutting Skill,

186
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:42,440
meaning, use your imagination

187
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,030
to practice the moves in your head.

188
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,760
Eye-shutting Skill?

189
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,840
Leave her alone.

190
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,640
Please teach us this song.

191
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,400
Yes. Yes.

192
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,110
Okay.

193
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:53,400
I returned to the capital.

194
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,280
A pretty appeared
at the winding corridors.

195
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:57,200
Who is this pretty?

196
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,880
-Could it be someone you admire?
-Who is it?

197
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,910
Admire?

198
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,960
I have no one to admire.

199
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,230
If I did,

200
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,640
I’d fail all my lady friends

201
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,320
worldwide?

202
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,230
If you don’t tell us,

203
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:12,960
we’ll detain you as a storyteller
in the troupe.

204
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,910
You’ll have to stay.

205
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:16,590
-Yes.
-Stay. Yes.

206
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:19,230
Miss Zhou, what do you say?

207
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,760
Ask him.

208
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,320
Don’t ask me.

209
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,590
You’re his apprentice.

210
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:27,760
If he stays,

211
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,400
then you’ll have to.

212
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:32,910
That’s right.

213
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Okay. Forget it.

214
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,280
My dear apprentice

215
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,280
is a martial art addict

216
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,150
with nothing but broadsword play
in her head.

217
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:41,670
She knows nothing about romance.

218
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:43,440
Stop teasing her.

219
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,280
-She left like that?
-Miss Zhou.

220
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:51,880
-Forget it.
-Yeah.

221
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,110
Let’s continue.

222
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:54,670
Teach us this line, Mr. Xie.

223
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:56,400
-How to sing it?
-Mr. Xie, teach us.

224
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,710
Master.

225
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:03,910
It’s all because you insisted on

226
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:05,790
saving Miss Zhou.

227
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:09,200
It’s okay.

228
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,590
I’ll recover gradually.

229
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:12,790
Don’t worry.

230
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:17,710
Madam Nichang saved my life

231
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,400
by using half of her energy.

232
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,550
She wouldn’t like me to take the fight.

233
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,910
I can’t make her sad

234
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:28,960
since she treats me
as her own apprentice.

235
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,470
Bad news.

236
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:37,400
The grain robbers are here.

237
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,440
Watch out.

238
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,350
Please give me two more days.

239
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:41,710
Please, wait for two more days.

240
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,150
-I have no money.
-Give me that, quickly!

241
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:45,520
Cut your crap.

242
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:50,590
You have no money
but run a stand?

243
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:51,880
Close it if you have no money.

244
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,230
Stop eating. Let’s leave.

245
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,320
You’ll see the consequence
if you don’t give me money.

246
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,550
Li Sheng.

247
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:59,230
Don’t act rashly.

248
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:00,200
Do you have money?

249
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:03,150
-But I can’t stand their evil deeds.
-Stop the nonsense!

250
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:03,910
Give me money!

251
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:05,840
Cut the crap. You!

252
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:08,440
You can’t defeat them

253
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,880
on your own.

254
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:11,350
It’ll be worse

255
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:12,910
if you get the locals involved.

256
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:13,760
What’s more,

257
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,880
the Demons are after us.

258
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,030
We should stay put.

259
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:20,840
We need to figure out a thorough plan

260
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,400
to escape.

261
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,280
And you,

262
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,030
listen up!

263
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:28,080
-Listen up!
-Hand in today’s quota

264
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,320
as promised.

265
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,440
Do you hear me?

266
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,470
Do you hear it?

267
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,400
What are you doing?

268
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,590
You fail at your training

269
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:09,080
and vent your anger at a mere stick?

270
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,080
Are you done with the new play?

271
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,430
I am.

272
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,030
I’m done with a story about escape.

273
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:17,780
Now, it’s time for a story

274
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:19,670
about me risking my life
with you for justice.

275
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,230
These words sound

276
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:25,000
so sarcastic.

277
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:27,760
Good for you, Yun.

278
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,150
You can tell it now.

279
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,200
I am being sarcastic to myself, okay?

280
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,150
There is a heroine
obsessed with martial arts.

281
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:36,280
That’s to say,

282
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,150
I’m risking my life with you.

283
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,320
Are you jealous?

284
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:48,200
I am not.

285
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:50,840
Now,

286
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,400
are your heartbeats accelerating?

287
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,640
Are you sweating?

288
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,590
Are you blushing?

289
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:55,960
And you dare not
look at my eyes?

290
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:00,520
I... I am not.

291
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,280
See?

292
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,640
I look straight at your eyes.

293
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,840
Do you buy it?

294
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,470
Why did you beat me?

295
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:34,930
You...

296
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:36,910
You ask for it.

297
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:41,790
Fei, are you alright?

298
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:43,350
None of your business.

299
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:43,910
Do you have any idea

300
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,760
about your situation?

301
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,030
You had to use your wits

302
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,110
to defeat Yang Jin normally.

303
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:50,550
Now you just recover
from the inner injuries

304
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,080
with your strength being damaged.

305
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,350
How can you compete with him?

306
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:56,030
-I...
-I know you think that I look down on you

307
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:57,840
and assert your loss.

308
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,840
That’s why I never bring it up
these days,

309
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,280
but only focused
on your broadsword play.

310
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,880
You saw it.

311
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,760
A mere punch

312
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,870
pained you greatly.

313
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,700
If you fight with Yang Jin,

314
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,420
the result...

315
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:16,560
I think you know how it’ll end.

316
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:18,370
It didn’t pain me.

317
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,350
I know you’re stubborn

318
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:23,990
and keep everything to yourself.

319
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:32,160
Are you crying? Why?

320
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,610
Where are you going?

321
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:38,590
You don’t want your blade?

322
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:39,670
No.

323
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,030
Then will you fight him?

324
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:50,350
No.

325
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:51,710
I’d rather

326
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:54,230
train myself more with my blade.

327
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:58,790
Then I’ll keep your blade.

328
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,350
Follow my hints.

329
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:10,560
Damn it.

330
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,110
Someone is approaching.

331
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:15,110
Let’s go.

332
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:16,070
If any of you refuses to hand it in,

333
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:17,760
I’ll make you suffer.

334
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,680
And you!

335
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,310
Take out your money.

336
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:22,350
Not a penny less. You!

337
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:24,560
Hand in your money. Do you hear me?

338
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,400
Hurry.

339
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,400
It’s mine. Don’t rob it.

340
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,190
So much money.

341
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,190
Sheng. Sheng.

342
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,470
You deserve it.

343
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:50,560
Beat him.

344
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:58,190
Turns out you’re a beauty.

345
00:17:58,190 --> 00:17:59,680
Catch her. Catch her.

346
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:04,760
Beat him.

347
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:22,640
Punk.

348
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,070
I’ll let you go

349
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:26,070
for the sake of money.

350
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:27,760
Never mess up with me.

351
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,710
Let’s go.

352
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:30,070
Let’s go.

353
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:34,590
Sheng.

354
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,280
Sheng.

355
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:07,520
Sheng.

356
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,100
You’re bleeding a lot.

357
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,290
It’s burning.

358
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:24,950
Miss Chuchu. Miss Chuchu.

359
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,190
Miss Chuchu.

360
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:28,240
I’m here.

361
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:40,040
Wait a second.

362
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:10,470
Take a break.

363
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:12,000
I’ll put a compress on your forehead.

364
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,560
You must be starving.

365
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,860
Luckily we still have a pancake.

366
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,540
Eat it.

367
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,790
Stop looking at me. Have it.

368
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:01,000
Here.

369
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,540
Eat it so that you’ll have energy
for the trip.

370
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:09,810
We can’t stay here anymore.

371
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:12,240
Have it now.

372
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:20,040
Does it taste awful?

373
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,920
Annoying!

374
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,680
Bonehead!

375
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,920
I need to sleep!

376
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,680
Stop the noise. Do you hear me?

377
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:24,070
It’s so annoying!

378
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,190
Are you deaf?

379
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:27,830
I’m talking to you.

380
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,430
You’re playing dumb?

381
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:32,460
Fine.

382
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,830
Wait and see.

383
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:45,640
Stop the noise. Stop the noise.

384
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:47,920
Stop it!

385
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,560
Fine, Bonehead.

386
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,830
If you don’t stop, I’ll...

387
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:20,950
What are you doing?

388
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:24,350
Can’t you see? I’m crying!

389
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:25,560
What for?

390
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,560
You don’t know?

391
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,430
The cracking of your blade

392
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:30,950
awakes me from my sleep.

393
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:33,160
I’m so sleepy.

394
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:36,590
So sleepy.

395
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:38,470
That’s it?

396
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,760
Eating and sleeping are vital
to a person.

397
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,430
What do you mean “that’s it”?

398
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:44,310
The most vital thing

399
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:45,640
should be defeating
all the martial artists worldwide

400
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,070
and being a grand master, right?

401
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:49,110
That’s your goal, not mine.

402
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:50,470
You can’t let me sacrifice

403
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:51,760
just because you want
to be a grand master.

404
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,510
What kind of master will it be?

405
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,870
You make sense.

406
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,060
What do you want, then?

407
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:03,400
First,

408
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,040
put away your lame blade

409
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,410
and don’t make any noise.

410
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,160
Agree.

411
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:08,920
Second,

412
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:12,350
I’m hungry.

413
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:13,800
Buy me some food.

414
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,710
Okay.

415
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,230
Wait a second.

416
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:18,400
What again?

417
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,560
I want the best food
in the entire city.

418
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:24,070
It’s the middle of the night.

419
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:25,560
Where can I get it?

420
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:27,640
I don’t care. I want it.

421
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,370
Any good news?

422
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:41,880
We haven’t found her.

423
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,040
We’ve searched everywhere nearby.

424
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:45,800
What a troublemaker.

425
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,230
Where can she be?

426
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:48,800
We’ve turned the whole city upside down

427
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:50,520
but found nothing about her traces.

428
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:54,070
If we lost her,

429
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:55,780
how am I supposed to explain to Madam?

430
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,680
Mr. Ma.

431
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,830
Should we go on with the search

432
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:01,920
or do our business?

433
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,640
Well, the priority

434
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,830
is to find Yan.

435
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:09,880
Inform all our men
to keep on looking for her.

436
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,420
Yes, let’s go.

437
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,880
All the possible places were searched.

438
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,470
Where could she be?

439
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:32,000
Yuyi Troupe has arrived in Hengyang.

440
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:37,090
Could she...?

441
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:42,060
(BESTORE)

442
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,560
Wait, wait.

443
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,160
Sir, you came just in time.

444
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,680
We’ll be closed
if you’re one second late.

445
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,040
Come on in.

446
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,580
Sir, what would you like?

447
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,640
This one...

448
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:57,830
This one...

449
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:59,800
I have no idea what girls like.

450
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,110
Pack some of every kind.

451
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:03,190
No problem, sir. Just a minute.

452
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,280
What is it?

453
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,470
Sir, this is our special offer.

454
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:12,760
Crispy and sweet winter jujubes.

455
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:16,400
This is dried yellow peach,
which is luscious and fragrant.

456
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,800
I strongly recommend it.

457
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,800
I’ve put them in it.

458
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,880
A variety of everything.

459
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:25,400
Here you are.

460
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:25,950
Thanks.

461
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:26,880
Okay.

462
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,310
Sir, see you.

463
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,560
It’s tasty.

464
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,640
The food in Hengyang

465
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,470
really lives up to its fame.

466
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:35,520
Would you like some?

467
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,640
I’m good.

468
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,590
I have to practice
martial arts tomorrow.

469
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:40,470
You can only do it when you’re full.

470
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:42,100
I can’t when I’m full.

471
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,070
You are just like Fei.

472
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:48,590
When she crossed the Ximo River,
she did the same.

473
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:51,280
She skipped meals and sleep,

474
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,110
spending every day in that damn river.

475
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:55,110
Ximo River?

476
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:57,160
She crossed it?

477
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,310
Yes.

478
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:00,350
Everyone who tries
to cross it got killed.

479
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:01,920
How did she do that?

480
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,160
Isn’t she amazing?

481
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,110
Listen,

482
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:07,000
you’ll be like an egg thrown to a rock

483
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,400
when competing with her.

484
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:08,920
You...

485
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,430
For your information, learn from me.

486
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:12,560
Eat and drink like it’s your last meal.

487
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,110
How comfy life would be.

488
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:16,040
Why do you have to make your life hard?

489
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,680
What are you doing?

490
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,430
I’m pondering over it.

491
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,140
(Secret Book on Martial Arts)

492
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:36,520
Get up! Get up! Get up!

493
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,470
Why are you sitting on my book?

494
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,040
What is the fuss about?

495
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,590
He bullies me.

496
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:50,000
I didn’t.

497
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,640
You...

498
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:08,590
Chief Xu, what’s the matter?

499
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,710
Jin.

500
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,230
I’ve heard of something.

501
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,230
If we want the heiress of South Blade
to take the challenge,

502
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:19,640
it would be difficult.

503
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,610
Why?

504
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:23,950
Relax, hear me out first.

505
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:27,400
Miss Zhou had been badly injured

506
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,280
before she arrived in Hengyang.

507
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,040
She was almost dying.

508
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,110
I guess

509
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:34,400
in Yuyi Troupe,

510
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:37,230
she’s just got better
after taking a rest.

511
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:39,160
How can she

512
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,850
take your challenge now?

513
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:44,000
Badly injured?

514
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Yes.

515
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:56,310
If she is forced to take the challenge,

516
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:57,250
eventually

517
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:01,230
this is an unfair contest.

518
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:13,560
I wonder how Li Yan is now.

519
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:17,000
With her shrewdness,

520
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,680
who can pick on her?

521
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,280
You should worry more about yourself.

522
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:30,880
Fei!

523
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:37,710
Fei, you don’t know

524
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:39,160
what I’ve suffered these days.

525
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,520
Fei,

526
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:43,520
this is Mr. Li’s...

527
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,530
Granddaughter.

528
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:49,080
Fei, this is...

529
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,880
Where’s my brother?

530
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,400
Probably taken to get married.

531
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,230
Step aside.

532
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:54,520
I will tell you later.

533
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:56,070
Fei.

534
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:57,920
This Bonehead, he is so mean to me.

535
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,810
You still have time to beg for my mercy.

536
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,220
Mister.

537
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:10,100
As for the challenge...

538
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,190
Miss Zhou.

539
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:14,190
I’ve brought you one thing today.

540
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,160
You must need it.

541
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:19,310
This is a special medicine
made by Small Medicine Valley.

542
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:20,310
It can help people
who ran out of inner forces

543
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:22,400
recover at the fastest speed.

544
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,470
I know you won’t take the challenge

545
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:25,160
because you are badly injured.

546
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,220
Take it and you will be fine.

547
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,230
Right.

548
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:30,590
Small Medicine Valley is the best at

549
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:31,710
making medicines.

550
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:34,190
I can give that to Madam Nichang.

551
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,600
Fei, are you hurt?

552
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,210
Now you start to worry about her?

553
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,110
If it weren’t for Madam Nichang,

554
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:46,340
you would never see your cousin.

555
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:49,680
Fei, I was wrong.

556
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,280
Let’s not compete with him.

557
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,230
Bonehead, this isn’t fair!

558
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:53,710
We won’t take it!

559
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:54,560
Yan, stay out of it.

560
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,760
It’s between me and him.

561
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,070
I gave her this medicine.

562
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:58,160
She can fight me after taking it.

563
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,400
Why is it unfair?

564
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,680
Fair.

565
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:06,050
Madam.

566
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,420
Do you have a blade?

567
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,600
Come with me.

568
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,430
Fei, I was wrong.

569
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:22,830
Don’t fight him.

570
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,590
The well-known martial artists

571
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:27,880
may have a weapon
more famous than themselves.

572
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,470
But you borrow a blade to fight me.

573
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:31,160
You are despising me!

574
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,920
She does despise you.

575
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,640
Fei will take you down!

576
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,830
-You stupid.
-You...

577
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,470
You are stupid.

578
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:38,400
You are stupid.

579
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,070
Stupid, stupid, stupid!

580
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:53,700

This city is ancient old.

589
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:33,070
But it’s ruined by the savage soldiers!

590
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:35,680
What are you saying?

591
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,710
Get out if you want.

592
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:38,110
We’re enjoying the music.

593
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:40,280
Now this world

594
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,040
is full of war.

595
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,400
How can you still drink wine

596
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,800
and enjoy the music?

597
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:46,520
You...!

598
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,880
Sirs.

599
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,710
Sorry, my friend is drunk.

600
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:54,470
He spoiled your enjoyment.

601
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:55,520
Please excuse him.

602
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,430
Let’s drink.

603
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:58,190
Drink.

604
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,310
What do you care?

605
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:10,040
Floating Palm?

606
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:50,160
Try if it suits you.

607
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,590
If you like it,

608
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,640
take it to fight.

609
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:05,830
After I compete with Yang Jin,

610
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:07,190
I will return it to you.

611
00:34:09,910 --> 00:34:10,910
Let’s go.

612
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:16,580
(Elegant and quiet courtyard)

613
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:38,600
Blades are heartless.

614
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:40,360
Excuse me.

615
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,470
He is indeed fast.

616
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,040
Her blade is not out yet.

617
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,000
This is...

618
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,360
There is an irreconcilable gap

619
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,190
between their martial arts.

620
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,040
Fei hasn’t attacked.

621
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,800
Because she knows if she does,

622
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:04,720
the gap will be exposed,

623
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:07,360
and she will lose her pace.

624
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,390
He shows her a head-on blow
from the start.

625
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:15,910
Looks like he will win for sure.

626
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:16,800
Nonsense.

627
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,710
How can Fei’s martial art

628
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:19,040
worse than Bonehead’s?

629
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,760
Fei, beat him down!

630
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,470
Qi School?

631
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,470
Why she uses Mayfly Moves of Qi school?

632
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:29,710
That’s her winning move?

633
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:30,800
No.

634
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,320
Fei is wearing out his patience.

635
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,430
She’s really smart.

636
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:45,000
She wants to test how powerful

637
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,670
13 Goose-breaking Blades is,

638
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:48,280
so she is deliberately stalling.

639
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,390
Fei is not a spinner.

640
00:35:52,870 --> 00:35:54,000
She cannot always avoid

641
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,560
without being exhausted.

642
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,570
Unless Yang Jin exposes his weakness.

643
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,240
Yang Jin is rash

644
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,770
and dull.

645
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:04,040
He might get impatient

646
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,090
and lose it.

647
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:07,230
Why hasn’t she attacked?

648
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:14,600
Yang Jin repeated his move?

649
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,080
Yang Jin is not a master

650
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,980
like Dragon Master and Qiu Tianjin.

651
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,150
He can’t beat me

652
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:22,280
within one move.

653
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,760
He is not as fast as

654
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,910
the blade of Ximo River,

655
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:27,150
and not as strong as

656
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:29,890
the spinning wire
that can pull a huge stone.

657
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,760
He hesitated.

658
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:43,120
A fast blade

659
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,190
allows no moment of hesitation.

660
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,090
You see my blade?

661
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:10,710
She is much brighter

662
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:12,710
than before.

663
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:15,040
One moment of hesitation

664
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,840
finally got him lost.

665
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:20,120
Fei!

666
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:23,120
Good job, Miss Zhou.

667
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,600
Today is an eye-opener for me.

668
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,080
Really?

669
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,360
Wait, wait.

670
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:34,190
You’ve lost. What do you want?

671
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:35,710
If Fei is not injured,

672
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:37,230
she would beat you sooner.

673
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:38,860
Fei, impressive.

674
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,230
Wait.

675
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,670
Don’t call me

676
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:54,080
the heiress of South Blade again.

677
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,950
My name is Zhou Fei.

678
00:37:58,670 --> 00:37:59,840
Yang Jin.

679
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,190
I will fight you if there’s a chance.

680
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:12,430
Unbelievable.

681
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:14,000
-I might have offended you.
-Indeed.

682
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,150
Please forgive me.

683
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:17,000
If there’s anything Route Gang can do,

684
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,870
feel free to tell me.

685
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,630
Thanks, Chief Xu.

686
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:22,840
Goodbye.

687
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:27,150
You’re really the heiress
of South Blade.

688
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:28,710
Formidably intelligent.

689
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:30,040
You flattered me.

690
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:33,710
I want to give this medicine to you

691
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:35,600
as a thank you gift.

692
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:44,120
You won this for me?

693
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,230
If Mr. Li could have seen this,

694
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,710
he would be very pleased.

695
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,800
Fei, you are awesome.

696
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,430
I didn’t realize you are that awesome.

697
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:21,430
Of course.

698
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:23,150
You’ve improved a lot.

699
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:24,910
It’s good to be young.

700
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:26,000
Here you are.

701
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,190
In this big world,

702
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:30,390
endless young people are hoping

703
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:31,430
to achieve something big.

704
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:33,710
-Let Li Yan accompany you.
-Forget it.

705
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:36,280
Five or ten years.

706
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,950
How many can manage

707
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:40,950
to endure the sufferings in life?

708
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:42,280
You are young

709
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,630
but you can sing well.

710
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,840
Just now I forgot to tip you,

711
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,150
it was my fault.

712
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:50,230
You are...?

713
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:51,390
Me?

714
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:53,360
I am just a disciple of Yuyi Troupe.

715
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,950
I saw you take down the bookish man

716
00:39:55,950 --> 00:39:57,430
by using moves of our sect.

717
00:39:57,430 --> 00:39:59,520
So I came to ask you.

718
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,470
Where did you learn Floating Palm?

719
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:05,710
What’s your relationship
with Yuyi Troupe?

720
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:08,910
I once met Master Nichang

721
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:11,190
when I was young.

722
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:13,040
I’ve learned something from her

723
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,190
by seeing her performing martial arts.

724
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:17,760
But it was a parody.

725
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,040
It’s not the real Floating Palm.

726
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,000
I think so.

727
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:24,120
I don’t think you can learn the essence.

728
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,950
But when you are out,

729
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:27,760
don’t use other sect’s martial arts.

730
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,430
If someone sees it,

731
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:30,800
they will think Yuyi Troupe

732
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,950
is afraid of some stupid soldiers.

733
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,540
We will be a joke.

734
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,120
You are right.

735
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,710
But throughout history,

736
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:42,230
common people don’t fight officials.

737
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:44,560
The less trouble, the better.

738
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,470
Fighting

739
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:47,800
isn’t the only way to help others.

740
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,280
Floating Palm is created

741
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:53,520
by Master and Mr. Li of South Blade.

742
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,890
We don’t have a chance to learn it.

743
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,080
How can a loser like you

744
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,000
use it for showing off?

745
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,320
South Blade?

746
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,800
The famous South Blade

747
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,710
from Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

748
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:06,190
Mr. Li.

749
00:41:09,470 --> 00:41:12,430
It’s such a big title.

750
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:13,840
Big title?

751
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,430
You don’t have it.

752
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:23,800
I think so.

753
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,230
You were so amazing.

754
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:30,420
Miss Zhou really uses your brain.

755
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:33,560
I saw you at the window,

756
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,470
thinking of something.

757
00:41:35,470 --> 00:41:38,000
So this is what you’ve thought of.

758
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,190
Yes.

759
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,280
That’s a dangerous move.

760
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,630
Aren’t you afraid you will lose?

761
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:47,080
So what if I lose.

762
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,800
I am not afraid of being laughed at.

763
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,630
The worst case is to humiliate myself.

764
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,670
Besides, I’m injured.

765
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:54,840
His moves are flawless.

766
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:56,800
But his personality is not.

767
00:41:56,870 --> 00:41:58,710
So I took advantage of it.

768
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:01,600
That’s smart.

769
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:03,560
Fei!

770
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:05,600
Fei, finally I found you.

771
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:07,470
Stay away.

772
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:09,040
You started the challenge.

773
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,800
Bonehead is one-track minded.

774
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:11,910
It’s easy for you to win him.

775
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:13,470
That’s for sure.

776
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:15,120
I haven’t asked you.

777
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,710
How did you get here?

778
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:18,150
Leader permitted me.

779
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:20,560
What was she thinking?

780
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,630
It’s... It’s true.

781
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,910
She asked Mr. Ma to come with me.

782
00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:29,910
He got something to do halfway.

783
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,670
So he left.

784
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:32,600
Then

785
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,710
I ran into that Bonehead.

786
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:36,630
Fine.

787
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:38,280
I will take you to the Fortress

788
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,040
and see how Leader will deal with you.

789
00:42:41,470 --> 00:42:42,800
Excuse me.

790
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,870
Madam asks to have a chat with you.

791
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,670
This way, please.

792
00:42:58,280 --> 00:42:59,560
What are you nervous about?

793
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:01,950
You don’t know.

794
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,950
The blade Madam Nichang gave me

795
00:43:03,950 --> 00:43:05,670
seems old.

796
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:07,120
And

797
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:09,330
I can tell from her look

798
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,260
that it’s precious.

799
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,520
So I guess

800
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:14,950
she might be another one

801
00:43:14,950 --> 00:43:16,730
wishing to be my grandmother.

802
00:43:25,910 --> 00:43:28,320
Madam, they are here.

803
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:33,290
Madam.

804
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:37,260
You may leave.

805
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:38,760
Yes.

806
00:43:40,230 --> 00:43:40,930
Madam.

807
00:43:47,950 --> 00:43:49,410
Little girl.

808
00:43:50,470 --> 00:43:52,230
Who taught you Snow-breaking Blade?

809
00:43:53,910 --> 00:43:54,750
My mom.

810
00:43:55,950 --> 00:43:56,910
Good.

811
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:02,520
Li Zheng got a great heiress.

812
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:05,600
I’m afraid

813
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:08,150
Grandpa will appear in my dream
to scold me.

814
00:44:08,950 --> 00:44:10,200
I played some tricks.

815
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:12,150
My martial art is not excellent.

816
00:44:16,950 --> 00:44:18,950
When I close my eyes,

817
00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:20,800
I feel like I can see Li Zheng

818
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,760
being serious and calm.

819
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:24,520
And

820
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:27,230
he is wearing faded clothes,

821
00:44:27,230 --> 00:44:28,670
talking to a girl

822
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:30,000
respectfully

823
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,670
within a distance.

824
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,080
I can’t imagine

825
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:35,470
a girl at your age

826
00:44:35,470 --> 00:44:36,910
to call him Grandpa.

827
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:41,080
It’s hilarious.

828
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:44,000
Madam.

829
00:44:44,630 --> 00:44:45,970
Thanks for the blade.

830
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:49,430
It must be a matching pair

831
00:44:49,430 --> 00:44:51,040
with the sword

832
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,630
hung on the wall.

833
00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:06,210
We two are

834
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:07,900
evenly matched.

835
00:45:08,430 --> 00:45:09,730
It is hard to tell

836
00:45:10,470 --> 00:45:11,700
who’s the clear winner.

837
00:45:12,390 --> 00:45:14,520
Since we can’t decide that on drinking,

838
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:15,950
how about

839
00:45:15,950 --> 00:45:17,550
we compete on martial arts?

840
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:26,670
Here’s the wine.

841
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,760
The blade and the sword were made

842
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:32,000
by me for two old acquaintances.

843
00:45:32,670 --> 00:45:34,600
The blade is named snow.

844
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:36,080
The sword is named mountain.

845
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:37,330
That two old acquaintances,

846
00:45:37,950 --> 00:45:39,670
one was your grandpa,

847
00:45:40,390 --> 00:45:41,630
Mr. Li.

848
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:45,260
The other was...

849
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:47,970
Yin Wenlan, the Mountain Sword.
