Sounds bustling out there.

19
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:39,040
Shall we go have a look?

20
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,720
Not interested.

21
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:43,680
Fine.

22
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,190
A trip always ends.

23
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,440
When you’re nearly home,

24
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,910
I’ve kind of finished my mission.

What does your hometown look like?

28
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,670
My hometown?

29
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,600
It’s cold.

30
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,880
Unlike this place

31
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,190
where trees are green
throughout the year.

32
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:32,750
Every winter in Jiankang,

33
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,640
red leaves outside the palace fall.

34
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,160
Even a thin layer of ice forms
over Qinhuai River.

35
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:42,000
The barren ferry falls silent at once.

36
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:46,390
Only the palace isn’t cold

37
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:48,800
where there’s always charcoal fire.

38
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:49,520
And...

39
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,160
Well, I don’t remember much.

40
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,670
Anyway, I’m not cold or hungry there.

41
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:06,270
Nothing else is fun.

42
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,960
There are many rules.

43
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,800
When I grew up,

44
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,190
I loved to travel to south.

45
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,880
To save money, small inns don’t

46
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,160
make a fire for you.

47
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,880
So,

48
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,630
I prefer to bask
in the sun in the south.

49
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,360
Do you remember...?

50
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,910
What happened when I was little?

51
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:35,910
I don’t.

52
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,160
I was too little

53
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,670
to remember many things.

54
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:42,830
So, I’m not as miserable as you imagine.

55
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,550
Don’t always keep everything
to your heart,

56
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:49,800
making you mysterious.

57
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:55,550
Girl.

58
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,030
Do you know

59
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:58,960
what being curious about someone

60
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,190
means?

61
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,630
What?

62
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,190
It means

63
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:05,800
you like him.

64
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:08,110
You want to know what he does every day

65
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:09,600
and what he is going to do.

66
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,670
You even wonder

67
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:12,910
what he thinks of every day.

68
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,110
The lovesickness begins

69
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:17,320
from being curious about someone.

70
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,350
What’s wrong with you?

71
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:22,790
I’m talking seriously!

72
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:24,390
What do you mean lovesickness?

73
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,390
I’m just

74
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:28,350
near my home already.

75
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:30,920
I think you’re wandering alone

76
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,640
and have nowhere to settle down.

77
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,790
Then I worry about you.

78
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,550
Don’t bother.

79
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,440
I lead a wandering life.

80
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,950
And I’m used to that.

81
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:45,440
If you ask me to stay somewhere
and don’t move,

82
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,230
I’ll feel bored and suffocated.

83
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:53,950
You will not stop?

84
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,160
Not really.

85
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:03,040
If I go to your home

86
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:03,830
and your mother asks me

87
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:06,350
to be her son-in-law,

88
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:07,920
I can’t run away.

89
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,270
In your dream!

90
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,320
Fei! Fei!

91
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:17,550
Why are you up there?

92
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,670
You know what? Bad news!

93
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:21,200
Yan is gone!

94
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,350
What?

95
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,670
Yan is gone!

96
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:26,670
I knew she wouldn’t be obedient!

97
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:27,600
When I went upstairs,

98
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,040
I visited her room,

99
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,790
only to find it empty

100
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:32,110
with the windows open.

101
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,320
Could she

102
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,790
run out again?

103
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:37,440
Her room is high.

104
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:40,110
Did she dare to jump?

105
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,880
You’re right. She didn’t dare.

106
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,480
Fei, what do we do?

107
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:48,830
Jili, don’t worry.

108
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:50,760
I’ll go get her back.

109
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,830
I’m going, too.

110
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:53,830
No! You can’t.

111
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,920
You’ve just recovered.

112
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,550
You had fights
and travelled all the way.

113
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:59,320
You need more rest.

114
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,510
None of your business!

115
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,270
Don’t follow me.

116
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,480
Give me back the Five-bat Token.

117
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,830
Why?

118
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:13,640
I’ll get in
the Fortress of the Forty-Eight anyway.

119
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,200
One day,

120
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,600
I’ll get it back from Zhou Fei!

121
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:17,070
You’re really going
to the Fortress of the Forty-Eight?

122
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:18,320
A man always keeps his promise.

123
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,480
Fine, for the sake
you helped me sneak out,

124
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,000
let me tell you.

125
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,670
You can’t get in
the Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

126
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:23,600
How about this?

127
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,480
I’ll ask Fei to give it back to you.

128
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,320
What do you think?

129
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,230
If so,

130
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:30,390
I’ll give the token to you.

131
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,270
But I’m still going to
the Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

132
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:34,320
Are you really an idiot?

133
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,040
Look at you.

134
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,950
What else do you know,
except martial arts?

135
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,270
Stop.

136
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,390
Why are you still following me?

137
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:40,350
When I helped you,

138
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:41,230
you didn’t say that.

139
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:43,040
Why are you still following me?

140
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,720
If I don’t follow you,

141
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,230
I won’t know how to get there.

142
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:46,720
How annoying!

143
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:56,550
Are you looking for me?

144
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:58,880
Seems like we’re on the same wavelength.

145
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,760
Who is on the same wavelength with you?

146
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,950
The moon is clear tonight.

147
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:13,110
Go. Let me take you to a place.

148
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:17,900
(Affluence and Prosperity)

149
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,480
The Fortress of the Forty-Eight
is right ahead.

150
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,760
We’re at Chunhui Town.

151
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,270
Let’s settle down for a moment.

152
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,790
You had a hard trip.

153
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:26,950
Don’t say that.

154
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:28,480
I was your burden.

155
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:37,000
The inn is just over there.

156
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,390
Stop following me.

157
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:40,270
Who is following you?

158
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:42,510
I’m just walking this way, too.

159
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:48,550
Sheng! Sheng!

160
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:56,550
Be careful. He’s wounded.

161
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:58,070
It hurts.

162
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,640
You must be Miss Wu.

163
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,440
Sheng.

164
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,040
Seems like she cares for you.

165
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:08,160
Could she...?

166
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,040
What are you talking about?

167
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,550
Talk politely and don’t be rude.

168
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:14,830
Call me Yan.

169
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,110
I’m his sister.

170
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:17,040
Yan.

171
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:21,270
Who is this man?

172
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,160
I’m Yang Jin with Cloud Ravine.

173
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:26,510
You must be Li Sheng,
grandson of the South Blade.

174
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,200
What Ravine?

175
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,790
Cloud Ravine in the south.

176
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:32,520
Known as Small Medicine Valley!

177
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,550
Mr. Yang.

178
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:35,110
Sorry I didn’t recognize you.

179
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:37,470
Why are you with my sister?

180
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:38,710
Shall we fight?

181
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:43,150
He keeps asking Fei for a fight!

182
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:44,280
But he was defeated.

183
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,590
Right, loser?

184
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,910
I’m just passing by.

185
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:52,760
I’ve got something else to do. See you.

186
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:56,470
Oh, Sheng,

187
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:57,910
how were you hurt?

188
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:01,000
Now you care for me?

189
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
But you...

190
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:04,710
Why are you coming down alone?

191
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:05,880
I’m not alone.

192
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,590
Fei and Mr. Xie are here.

193
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:08,910
Fei is also here?

194
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,150
Who is Mr. Xie, then?

195
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,320
He’s the man

196
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,790
who asked Uncle to leave the mountain.

197
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,200
It’s hard to explain.

198
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,550
Let’s get back to the inn first.

199
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:18,670
Let’s go.

200
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,150
Mr. Ma!

201
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,440
Look who’s back.

202
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,670
Sheng?

203
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,400
Good boy.

204
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,910
You didn’t let me down.

205
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:30,710
You must be Miss Wu.

206
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,880
Great. When you come back safely,

207
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,840
I can finally stop worrying

208
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,400
about you.

209
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,080
Thank you for your concern.

210
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,520
Speaking of this,

211
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,550
thanks to Fei.

212
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,150
Miss Chuchu said

213
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:45,200
her trip started dangerously.

214
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,550
Without Fei’s help,

215
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:48,550
we wouldn’t have come back safely.

216
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,550
Oh,

217
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:51,550
where’s Fei?

218
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,350
Yan.

219
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:56,910
Where are Fei and Mr. Xie?

220
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,030
And Mr. Yang.

221
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:00,590
Fei and Mr. Xie are taking a walk.

222
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:02,440
As for Bonehead,

223
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:04,470
I pissed him off and he ran away.

224
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,350
Look at you.

225
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:08,150
You always make troubles.

226
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,710
Get upstairs and go to bed!

227
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:10,590
Don’t run about again.

228
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:13,280
Mr. Ma, don’t be angry.

229
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:15,760
My brother is wounded.

230
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,960
I’ll heal him.

231
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:18,710
It hurts!

232
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,840
Just go to bed.

233
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,000
-How rude you are!
-Sheng.

234
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,230
How were you wounded?

235
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,030
Mr. Ma.

236
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:26,880
Secret Service betrayed us.

237
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,910
We came all the way back,
being hunted down.

238
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:31,760
So, we shouldn’t stay for long.

239
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,230
We must get back soon.

240
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,350
Okay.

241
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:00,790
Seems like it’ll be two hours

242
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:02,760
before the Spinning Wire Formation stops.

243
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,280
Mr. Yutai.

244
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:16,080
I’ve been waiting for this day
for too long.

245
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,520
Sir.

246
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:42,080
There comes some noise of fight
near the pavilion.

247
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,960
Please send men to check.

248
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:45,840
Let’s go!

249
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,760
Look.

250
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:14,440
That’s my home.

251
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,320
The Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

252
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,760
It looks the brightest

253
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:22,280
only when the moon shines
over Ximo River.

254
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,550
I went there before.

255
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:37,080
Oh, yes. You did.

256
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,670
Yeah.

257
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:41,760
But I was too busy netting the weeds

258
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,470
to enjoy the moon.

259
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,200
Now I realize

260
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,880
the moon really looks great.

261
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,030
What’s the difference

262
00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:00,520
between this moon
and that in your hometown?

263
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:05,350
I’m asking you. Why do you stare at me?

264
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,470
The moon looks the same

265
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,790
no matter where we look at it.

266
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,470
But people who enjoy it are different.

267
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:33,760
Fei.

268
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,350
People come and go

269
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:37,880
in your place.

270
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:39,640
Patrols are everywhere.

271
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:42,280
Can birds still be highly strung?

272
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:46,710
Is there

273
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:48,230
something happening?

274
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:50,710
Let’s get back to the inn.

275
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:51,400
Okay.

276
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:04,550
-Chief.
-Chief.

277
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:13,110
He is dead.

278
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,760
The mission to restore our sect

279
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:18,080
counts on us!

280
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,150
We used to be famous spies.

281
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:27,400
Now, we’re restrained
in the Forbidden Forest.

282
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:30,760
We’re not free

283
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:33,670
and even subordinate to
the Fortress of the Forty-Eight!

284
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:36,860
From today on,

285
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,910
we will restore our sect

286
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:44,000
and no longer disgrace ourselves!

287
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:47,150
-We all take your order, Chief!
-We all take your order, Chief!

288
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,840
-We all take your order, Chief!
-We all take your order, Chief!

289
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:12,110
Lord, according to Mingfeng spies,

290
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:14,030
it’ll be two hours
before the Spinning Wire Formation stops.

291
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,080
Give my order.

292
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:24,840
Ask everybody to get ready.

293
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,280
We’ll cross the river and attack
in two hours.

294
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:29,230
Aye.

295
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,550
Fine. We’ll get up the mountain
tomorrow morning.

296
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:37,400
Mr. Ma!

297
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:38,760
Fei!

298
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,200
Are you getting better?

299
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:42,910
Yes.

300
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,350
You’re finally back?

301
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:46,470
Fei, where did you go?

302
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:47,790
What took you so long?

303
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:48,550
Mr. Ma.

304
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:50,230
Something happened
in the Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

305
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:51,110
What happened?

306
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,230
Mr. Xie and I saw startling birds

307
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:54,790
from that direction.

308
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,840
There’s more bad news.

309
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,880
Our Secret Service across the state...

310
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,520
Some have betrayed us.

311
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,910
Miss Chuchu and I came all the way back,

312
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:04,640
being hunted down.

313
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,760
In Huarong,

314
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,430
the Secret Service betrayed us, too.

315
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:10,760
They were bribed by Demons Manor

316
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:13,160
so that our disciples died

317
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,520
including Chenfei.

318
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,920
Demons Manor?

319
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:20,110
Tong Tianyang with Demons Manor
killed Ms. Wang.

320
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:22,470
If someone hadn’t helped us,

321
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:24,400
I would have died, too.

322
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,880
Demons Manor?

323
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,810
Secret Service?

324
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:32,070
Something...

325
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,800
Something dangerous has really happened.

326
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,000
Sheng, I want to go home.

327
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,070
Mr. Ma.

328
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:40,640
We’ll certainly go home!

329
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,640
Fei.

330
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:46,430
I’ll go with you.

331
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:51,640
Mr. Ma, time is running out.

332
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,950
Let’s get up to the mountain.

333
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:55,160
Fine.

334
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,800
But I don’t think

335
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,400
Miss Chuchu and Yan should go.

336
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,680
They don’t have martial arts.

337
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,230
If something happens,

338
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:04,310
they’ll be in danger.

339
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:05,000
Yes.

340
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,160
No.

341
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,280
There’s trouble up the mountain.

342
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,520
They may not be safe down it.

343
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,830
We must go together.

344
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:15,160
Fine.

345
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,710
Let’s get packed.

346
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,830
We’ll go up to the mountain asap.

347
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:30,190
Chief.

348
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:31,830
Giant Leopard is ready.

349
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:33,350
Guards at the gate
of the Fortress of the Forty-Eight

350
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:34,640
have been wiped out.

351
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:40,190
It is time

352
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:42,880
for winner-take-all!

353
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,830
Ask people down the mountain to act.

354
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,070
Something is wrong!

355
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:06,280
Strike the gong in the outpost
to warn others!

356
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:30,190
Report!

357
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,680
Mr. Zhang.

358
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,230
There’s sound of gong
from down the mountain.

359
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:35,710
I’ve heard it.

360
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:36,590
Well,

361
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:38,110
go give my order.

362
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:40,040
Send men to support at the gate.

363
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:40,470
Aye.

364
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:41,640
The rest of you, come with me!

365
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,070
-Aye!
-Aye!

366
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,640
Lord Gantang.

367
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:55,710
According to spies,

368
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:57,760
Yu Wenzhi left with private soldiers
three days ago.

369
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,470
Do you know where he has gone?

370
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:02,560
Not sure yet.

371
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,760
I’m afraid

372
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:08,920
he’s up to something else.

373
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,280
I must head for the battalion
in the north of the city

374
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,680
for something important.

375
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,110
Okay.

376
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:15,350
-Let’s go.
-Aye.

377
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:39,430
Fei, something is wrong!

378
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:41,230
We can’t get in through the outer gate.

379
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,430
I know a pathway.

380
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:44,430
Let’s go this way.

381
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,350
The Formation has stopped.

382
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,160
All of you, go!

383
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,110
-Aye.
-Aye.

384
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:29,880
Master.

385
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,190
This pathway leads
to the Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

386
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:33,830
If you worry,

387
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:35,150
go up there and have a look.

388
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,430
No.

389
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,560
We’ll head for the north

390
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,790
as planned.

391
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:43,880
Hyah!

392
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:45,640
Hyah! Hyah!

393
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:14,800
Judged from their wounds,

394
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,950
people with Mingfeng killed them.

395
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:19,430
No wonder their Secret Service

396
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:21,430
all betrayed us.

397
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,000
Fei.

398
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,430
You’re strong enough
to protect yourself.

399
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:33,280
Well, run away

400
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,800
with Miss Chuchu and Yan.

401
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,400
Stop treating me like a kid!

402
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,680
I’ll go with you!

403
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,020
Mr. Ma.

404
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,680
I want to help, too.

405
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,470
No way!

406
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:43,590
It’s too dangerous.

407
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:45,070
If you’re in danger,

408
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:46,680
how can I explain to your mother?

409
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,230
Mr. Ma.

410
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:49,350
This is her home.

411
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:50,780
She can’t leave it alone.

412
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:56,110
I’m not running away this time.

413
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:57,160
I’ll fight with you.

414
00:22:58,710 --> 00:22:59,350
Mr. Ma.

415
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,880
No matter what the rebels want,

416
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,400
Aunt isn’t home now.

417
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,800
It counts on me...

418
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,950
On us.

419
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:08,830
Individuals don’t survive
when losing their homes.

420
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:10,110
When it’s dangerous here,

421
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:11,800
so will be other places.

422
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,070
Mr. Ma!

423
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,020
Fine, fine.

424
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,190
But remember,

425
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:19,950
if you’re in real danger,

426
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:21,190
you must escape immediately.

427
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:22,110
Understand?

428
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:28,950
Mr. Ma, when the third elder rebelled,

429
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:29,470
how did my mother defend the Fortress

430
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:31,120
all by herself?

431
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,230
At that time,

432
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:35,230
your mother was already

433
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:37,230
the leader.

434
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:40,190
But without the help of other elders,

435
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:42,190
she wouldn’t have united everyone

436
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:43,360
and fought the enemies.

437
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,880
Other elders?

438
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:46,720
Precisely.

439
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:48,640
But now,

440
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,640
your mother isn’t here.

441
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,280
We don’t have a leader.

442
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,590
I can even imagine that.

443
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:53,880
Those stubborn elders

444
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,070
don’t convince each other.

445
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:57,350
Let’s go to the Hall of Elders

446
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:58,920
and ask them to unite.

447
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,070
Okay.

448
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:02,450
Fei.

449
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,680
I’m not going with you.

450
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,560
We’re not sure about other places.

451
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,640
I’ll go check it.

452
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,880
Let’s take separate action.

453
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:10,760
Okay.

454
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,110
Fine. That’s it.

455
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:14,040
Follow me.

456
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,110
Yan.

457
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:17,520
I’ll leave Chuchu to you.

458
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:19,690
Don’t worry. I’ll take care of her.

459
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:21,760
Li Sheng.

460
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,430
Be very careful.

461
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,350
See you.

462
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,760
Fei, you need tricks

463
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,000
to unite those elders.

464
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,830
Use your brain instead of strength.

465
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:56,430
The Spinning Wire Formation stops,

466
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:59,100
but it doesn’t mean Fisherman did it.

467
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:00,880
You two.

468
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,710
Calm down. Calm down.

469
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:05,350
(Zhao Qiusheng, An Elder of the Fortress)
Only Fisherman can stop the Formation.

470
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:08,190
Stop making a veiled abuse.

471
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:09,470
You sound like

472
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:11,110
you’re complaining about Deng Zhen.

473
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:12,640
(Deng Zhen, An Elder of the Fortress)
I can make out what you mean.

474
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,070
Deng Zhen is the elder of defense.

475
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:15,920
(Zhang Bolin, An Elder of the Fortress)
He has the responsibility

476
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,120
(Zhang Bolin, An Elder of the Fortress)
to explain to us

477
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,400
about what is happening.

478
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,680
Why are you still quarrelling?

479
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,160
The longer you quarrel,

480
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,760
the more men die.

481
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:26,470
Ma, what’s going on?

482
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:27,880
Why are you back?

483
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,160
With strangers?

484
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,230
Mr. Ma, do me a favor.

485
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:33,640
When we get in the Hall of Elders,

486
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,800
let Fei talk to the elders first.

487
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,710
If you say something for her first,

488
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:39,830
they’ll certainly think

489
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:41,160
she’s a follower.

490
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:45,070
There’s a reason.

491
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:46,160
It’s a long story.

492
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,230
Our priority is

493
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:49,160
to solve the rebellion of Mingfeng.

494
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:49,920
Now,

495
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,400
the outer gate may be broken through.

496
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:54,540
Even the outer gate...?

497
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:57,130
How do you know
it’s the rebellion of Mingfeng?

498
00:25:57,950 --> 00:25:59,590
When we got up the mountain,

499
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:01,920
we saw many disciples killed

500
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,710
by Mingfeng people.

501
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,280
Sounds like

502
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,190
we’re under attack

503
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:07,700
from all directions.

504
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:10,850
Deng.

505
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:14,230
The Spinning Wire Formation
has been stopped.

506
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:16,040
Enemies will come over Ximo River.

507
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,680
Li Sheng has gone to check other places.

508
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,980
Could you give me some disciples
for support?

509
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:23,760
Young girl.

510
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,620
How dare you give orders now!

511
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,590
Yun Xiao!

512
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,350
Here.

513
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:40,680
Order standby posts
to be used immediately.

514
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,830
Send more men for defense.

515
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:42,680
Ask the remaining disciples

516
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,310
to come here

517
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:46,230
and get ready to check Ximo River.

518
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:48,040
If there’s any problem,

519
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,190
shoot to warn us.

520
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:50,850
Aye.

521
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,250
Whether it’s too late depends

522
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:56,560
on how strong our enemies are.

523
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:01,160
Talk firmly to them.

524
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,920
You can’t convince anyone

525
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,880
before you fully trust yourself.

526
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,350
When you take charge,

527
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:08,110
don’t force them.

528
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:09,280
Don’t go too far.

529
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,230
Remember, you’re a junior.

530
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:12,430
You come to solve problem,

531
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:13,160
instead of making trouble.

532
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,760
Elders.

533
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,830
Mr. Zhang. Mr. Zhao.

534
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:20,520
I was so anxious

535
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,710
that I behaved a bit rudely.

536
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,480
Please forgive me.

537
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:27,020
Forget it.

538
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,160
I’ll see

539
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,520
what kind of enemies

540
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,110
those traitors can get!

541
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,640
What if

542
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,760
those elders do their own duties

543
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,880
and unite with each other?

544
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,070
Your mother keeps the elders

545
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:41,920
so that they restrain each other.

546
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,400
So, what we should do

547
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,200
is to take them down one by one.

548
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:47,830
My mother told me

549
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:49,520
you two were the most reliable elders

550
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,520
in our place.

551
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,350
We depend on you

552
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:55,350
to defend our fortress.

553
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,950
Your mother is right.

554
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:02,400
Leave it to us. Don’t worry.

555
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,230
Everyone, how about this?

556
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:05,590
Li Sheng and I will take care

557
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:07,680
of the gate and posts.

558
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:10,000
As for the enemies over Ximo River,

559
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:14,400
I’ll leave it to you all.

560
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:23,800
I didn’t teach you

561
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,110
to flatter them.

562
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:26,350
Good.

563
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,000
It’s wise of you.

564
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,430
Ms. Kou.

565
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:54,590
Lord.

566
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,430
This is the map
of the Spinning Wire Formation.

567
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,280
Keep it.

568
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,860
Very good.

569
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:09,200
Let’s stick to the plan.

570
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:12,000
Our men are ready to attack

571
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,680
from the root of the mountain.

572
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,430
Let’s make a sudden attack

573
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:16,640
through the Forbidden Forest.

574
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:37,060
(Hall of Elders)

575
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,710
This is the Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

576
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:46,010
My home.

577
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,470
Fight and I’ll live.

578
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:49,760
Retreat and I’ll die.

579
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,760
I would die, at most.

580
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:55,000
In a brave way.

581
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:55,680
Everybody.

582
00:29:57,470 --> 00:29:59,120
We all live here.

583
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,090
We’re brothers

584
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,500
and families.

585
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:06,210
(Hall of Elders)
Now, the Fortress is at stake.

586
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:08,640
Whatever,

587
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,280
I want you to get rid of prejudice

588
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,710
and defend our home together.

589
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:16,110
-Yes! Yes! Yes!
-Yes! Yes! Yes!

590
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:20,680
She looks like a leader.

591
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:28,940
(Fortress of the Forty-Eight)

592
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,540
(Forbidden Forest)

593
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:32,140
(Forbidden Forest,
walk in and you’ll die)

594
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:37,100
(Forbidden Forest,
walk in and you’ll die)

595
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:38,810
Yan.

596
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:43,350
Stay here with Chuchu.

597
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,760
Fei, I also want to go.

598
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,520
I know you’re great.

599
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,640
So,

600
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,250
I have an important task for you.

601
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,650
Protect Chuchu.

602
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:07,260
(Walk in and you’ll die)

603
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:12,660
(Map of the Spinning Wire Formation)

604
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:13,860
(Ximo River)

605
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:16,760
Go!

606
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,710
Everyone, follow me.

607
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:40,850
Stop!

608
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,640
Go!

609
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:50,760
We’re right.

610
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:52,400
Posts of the Forbidden Forest
have been broken through, too.

611
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,560
Senior.

612
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,430
Sheng, are you alright?

613
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:57,560
I’m fine.

614
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,710
Men in black keep coming in.

615
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,760
They look like

616
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,470
they’re with Demons Manor.

617
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:06,640
Spinning Wires keep changing.

618
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,430
And they’re covert.

619
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:09,830
How can they avoid them

620
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:11,480
so easily?

621
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:15,280
Seems like

622
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,800
people in Mingfeng collude with them

623
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,150
so that they know
where the Spinning Wires are.

624
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:22,740
They come this way,

625
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,920
possibly because they want
to reach the center place

626
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,840
in small groups.

627
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:30,850
Once they get there and cooperate

628
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,740
with enemies coming over Ximo River,

629
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:35,920
they’ll besiege us.

630
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:41,130
Senior.

631
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:43,640
I’ve got an idea.

632
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:36,260
(Fortress of the Forty-Eight)

633
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:15,360
Who are you?

634
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:22,720
Demons Manor.

635
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,710
You know him?

636
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:25,270
No.

637
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,120
Cold breeze.

638
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,040
He’s very likely to be Gu Tianxian,

639
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:31,540
Giant Leopard with Demons Manor.

640
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,000
They don’t have many men.

641
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,840
They don’t stand a chance to defeat you.

642
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:38,870
Gu Tianxian especially comes

643
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:41,080
when my mother is away.

644
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,190
They won’t fight an uncertain battle.

645
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:44,840
Could they

646
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,840
have a backup plan?

647
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,190
Whatever!

648
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:49,320
I’ll rush up,

649
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,320
kill him and roast him

650
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,870
for celebration party.

651
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:18,560
I’m Gu Tianxian.

652
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,870
I come without invitation.

653
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,390
Hope you will

654
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,360
forgive me.

655
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:27,130
Giant Leopard with Demons Manor?

656
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:31,710
You come uninvited.

657
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:33,840
We’ll kill you to eliminate the evil.

658
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,770
What do you think,

659
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:45,550
Ms. Kou?

660
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,360
Kou Dan.

661
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:59,190
You ungrateful shrew!

662
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,080
You have no idea.

663
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,800
We have a rule.

664
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:06,770
When a new chief wants power,

665
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:09,680
he must kill the former one.

666
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:16,870
You and my master retired. Fine.

667
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:18,360
In case no one else gets the map

668
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,430
of the Spinning Wire Formation,

669
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:23,150
you even caught me back!

670
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,670
Leave if you want.

671
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:28,230
I won’t stop you.

672
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:32,500
You!

673
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:43,230
I don’t think I can get information

674
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:45,360
about the Bracelet from you.

675
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,670
Mr. Yutai died a natural death.

676
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:52,470
Compared to former chiefs,

677
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:55,390
I’m merciful enough.

678
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:01,280
Kou Dan!

679
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,000
We kept you

680
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,630
and protected you.

681
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:10,430
But you betray us!

682
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:13,800
Our sect was taken in by Li Zheng.

683
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,630
To show our sincerity,

684
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:18,710
we used the Spinning Wire Formation
over Ximo River.

685
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:20,430
It’s such an important formation

686
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:22,710
that all core disciples involved

687
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:24,870
have never left this place.

688
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:26,630
From then on,

689
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:29,250
we dwelled in the Forbidden Forest

690
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:33,150
as your gatekeepers.

691
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:36,530
What’s big deal of being decent?

692
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,370
Mr. Zhang.

693
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,490
Why don’t you ask Madam Li

694
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:44,120
if she’s fair

695
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,430
to you?

696
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:47,760
I heard the former chief

697
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,840
caught his youngest disciple

698
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,910
who wanted to escape

699
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:53,910
just for the Spinning Wire Formation.

700
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:55,520
After years,

701
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,950
she’s finally cultivated

702
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:58,910
into a qualified spy.

703
00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:00,230
Seems like

704
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:01,600
you’re too qualified.

705
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:04,150
Young man.

706
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:07,190
You know too much.

707
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:15,390
Tell me.

708
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:16,840
Where is Fisherman?

709
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:20,040
Fei.

710
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,150
Calm down.

711
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,080
I’ll fight her.

712
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:25,630
She has fighting experience of decades.

713
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:26,870
You’re not as strong.

714
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:29,080
But I know the way she fights.

715
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,160
Cut the crap.

716
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:37,870
We’re separating from you.

717
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:40,040
I don’t think Madam Li will give me

718
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,950
what I want.

719
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:45,150
I guess I need more hostages

720
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:46,840
to make a deal with her.

721
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,560
Zhou Fei.

722
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,560
You’re back just in time.

723
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:53,270
Wait.

724
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,560
When I’m here,

725
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:58,080
you don’t need to fight.

726
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,320
Wait and see

727
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:01,120
how I’ll teach her a lesson.

728
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,080
You shrew!

729
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,910
How arrogant you sound!

730
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,150
Ms. Kou.

731
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:07,470
I’ll fight you.

732
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:53,000
Zhou Fei.

733
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,710
I haven’t tried
your Snow-breaking Blade yet.

734
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:57,520
You can try now.

735
00:41:58,230 --> 00:41:59,470
Interesting.

736
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:05,600
Watch out!

737
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,470
That’s Rain Needle.

738
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:15,520
You’re fast.

739
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,040
That’s Rain Needle.

740
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:32,540
Luckily, it’s thick enough.

741
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:39,600
Be careful with the hook!

742
00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:53,760
This is Snow-breaking Blade?

743
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:55,280
Precisely.

744
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:05,190
Miss Fei has great marital arts!

745
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:25,870
Report!

746
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:29,120
Mr. Zhao.

747
00:44:30,470 --> 00:44:33,150
A large number of people are attacking
from the root of the mountain.

748
00:44:33,150 --> 00:44:34,040
From all directions.

749
00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:44,360
I’ve fought masters

750
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:46,600
with Qianzhong Sect and South Blade.

751
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:47,670
Today,

752
00:44:47,670 --> 00:44:50,080
my trip isn’t for nothing.

753
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:54,760
You’re heroes.

754
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:58,000
But to be honest,

755
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,760
when we were fighting,

756
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:04,190
elite men of Timber Wolf
came all the way up.

757
00:45:04,190 --> 00:45:06,080
When he comes,

758
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:08,080
he kills people.

759
00:45:10,870 --> 00:45:12,430
But I don’t want

760
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:15,290
to be sacrificed.

761
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:18,040
Why don’t we sit down

762
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:20,670
and figure everything out?

763
00:45:20,670 --> 00:45:22,710
Isn’t it a good thing

764
00:45:22,710 --> 00:45:25,000
to make peace?

765
00:45:29,470 --> 00:45:30,390
Go!

766
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:37,040
You’ve got a good idea.

767
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,390
Or we wouldn’t have fought

768
00:45:38,390 --> 00:45:39,800
so many enemies.

769
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:41,470
Our gate and outer gate

770
00:45:41,470 --> 00:45:43,870
have been taken by Mingfeng Sect.

771
00:45:43,870 --> 00:45:45,480
Our next step is

772
00:45:46,150 --> 00:45:47,410
to get our gate back.

773
00:45:48,670 --> 00:45:50,040
Oh, Sheng,

774
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:51,430
when we were in the Hall of Elders,

775
00:45:51,430 --> 00:45:53,150
I didn’t have the chance to ask Fei.

776
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:54,420
