=Episode 38=

17
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:35,140
(Wang)

18
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,870
This is your face print.

19
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:45,830
Miss Zhou Fei is a handful.

20
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:46,870
A naughty troublemaker.

21
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:47,870
(Wang)
Other things aside,

22
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:49,590
she wrote “Wang” on your forehead

23
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:52,440
and mustaches on two sides
like the character “Ba”.

24
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,400
Together, she’s calling you a turtle.

25
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:57,950
You’re right.

26
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,400
I’ll let her know what you say about her

27
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,080
once she wakes up.

28
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,360
You’ve taken

29
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,230
the Three-kind Decoction.

30
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:09,240
There’s nothing else I can do.

31
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,210
What do you mean, Tongming?

32
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:16,630
He means

33
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:18,390
I’ll soon bite the dust.

34
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:27,600
Be careful.

35
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,880
Slowly.

36
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,520
After your last treatment,

37
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,830
I could barely walk.

38
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:57,630
Now, I feel much better.

39
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:00,800
The Three-kind Decoction

40
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,430
can stimulate your remaining energy

41
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:06,760
to keep you from dying silently.

42
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,270
But they can’t cure you.

43
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:10,240
Each time your life is prolonged,

44
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,320
your energy reduces.

45
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,270
After taking the three herbs,

46
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:18,910
without the antidote...

47
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:20,070
That’s it?

48
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:21,550
Is there anything else we can do?

49
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:24,910
Bone-chilling is suppressed
by his energy,

50
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,400
but I can’t stop him

51
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,350
from weakening.

52
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:31,990
There’s only so much I can do.

53
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:34,120
I checked all the medical books

54
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,800
and came up with such an expedient.

55
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,990
Master Chen,

56
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:44,430
our fate is predestined.

57
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:45,710
Few could be as energetic

58
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:47,070
as me

59
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:48,400
with Bone-chilling.

60
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:52,120
I’ve been brought back
to life three times.

61
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,710
That’s unprecedented.

62
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:56,470
I’m more than content.

63
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,960
How could you?

64
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,880
You haven’t got married.

65
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,760
Neither have you.

66
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,120
I... I...

67
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,070
At least, she’s accepted
my token of love.

68
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,990
I have an idea.

69
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:10,990
Why don’t you get a cat

70
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,630
to keep you company?

71
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:14,990
What... what are you talking about?

72
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:17,630
-You punk! How dare you!
-Master.

73
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:19,840
I’m done wasting my time on you.

74
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,190
Where are you going?

75
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:48,800
Master,

76
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,350
I want to go out

77
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:53,030
with Fei.

78
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,030
Are you

79
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:59,190
sick of us around?

80
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:03,520
Master, you took me in.

81
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,030
I’d never be sick of you.

82
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,520
Take good care of yourself.

83
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,620
By the way,

84
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:19,030
where’s the blade I made years back?

85
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,860
Already melted,

86
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,010
without getting sharpened.

87
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:28,440
Chen said it was poorly made

88
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,350
and would only be an embarrassment.

89
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,190
I see.

90
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,800
I’ll ask him to teach me

91
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,190
to make a new one.

92
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,410
You’re free to leave.

93
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:44,070
And Zhou Fei...

94
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:47,120
No need to tell her.

95
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:49,870
What will come will come.

96
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:51,470
Rushing her is of no use.

97
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:53,910
Once I can’t hold it any longer,

98
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:56,000
you can tell her to bid me farewell.

99
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:09,460
(Take a guess.)

100
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,870
You made me a turtle.

101
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:00,560
It’s payback time!

102
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,150
Your Majesty.

103
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,200
General Wen.

104
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,470
Long time no see.

105
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,120
My respects to you, Your Majesty.

106
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,560
Stop. Don’t call me that.
I don’t deserve it.

107
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,350
What makes you say that?

108
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,120
The coming battle is life and death.

109
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,200
We need your command.

110
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,590
You’ve been out for so long.

111
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:30,560
It’s time to go back with me.

112
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:33,240
Go back to do what?

113
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,150
Lead the troops to fight.

114
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:36,780
It’s a significant battle.

115
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,640
So what if we win?

116
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,150
They don’t care

117
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:44,440
who sits on that chair.

118
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,680
Victory costs lives.

119
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,350
Whatever the result is,

120
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:54,200
people will suffer.

121
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,880
So long.

122
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:01,610
Your Majesty...

123
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:04,270
General Wen,

124
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:09,030
that’s no longer who I am.

125
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:10,380
I’m not Xiao Chuan anymore.

126
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,910
Call me Xie Yun.

127
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:28,760
Are you alright?

128
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,800
Thank you.

129
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,080
What’s going on?

130
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,910
The war zone is right ahead.

131
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:42,950
Soon, this place will be occupied, too.

132
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,680
How come there’s no sign of it?

133
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,710
To buy us time to leave,

134
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:50,390
General Wang

135
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,270
has got himself besieged.

136
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,120
Once this place falls to the enemies,

137
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,120
the war will spread here.

138
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,200
General Wang.

139
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,830
You mean Wang Lin of the Anping Army?

140
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:02,560
Yes.

141
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,800
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

142
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:11,680
Your Majesty.

143
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Who is it?

144
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:22,030
(Wang Lin Anping Army)
You may leave.

145
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,270
Yes.

146
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,150
Your Majesty.

147
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,270
Your Majesty.

148
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:34,640
General Wang.

149
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,030
Call me Xie Yun.

150
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,000
It’s dangerous outside.

151
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,030
Why are you here?

152
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:43,320
I happened to pass by

153
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,760
and was told

154
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,560
you’re cornered.

155
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,350
So here I am.

156
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,680
Are your skills...?

157
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:55,200
All gone

158
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,860
except for the Footwork.

159
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,200
I can still

160
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,270
get one person out.

161
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:06,320
I appreciate that,

162
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,470
but I can’t

163
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:10,760
leave all my men behind

164
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,240
in face of the battle.

165
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,200
I can’t do that.

166
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,140
General Wang,

167
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,320
I understand you care about them,

168
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,760
but there are people outside

169
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,270
waiting for you.

170
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,800
You don’t trust my skill?

171
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,680
Don’t worry.

172
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,030
I wouldn’t be here

173
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:36,880
if I weren’t sure enough.

174
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,560
I’ve never doubted you.

175
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,800
But

176
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,760
I’ve made

177
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,680
my decision

178
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,710
regarding the coming battle.

179
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:56,200
Let me show you something.

180
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,880
I hope that’ll help you

181
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,270
understand me.

182
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:07,860
(Graves of the Loyal)

183
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:30,510
(Gravestone)

184
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:33,910
(Gravestone)
It’s a tough battle.

185
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,320
We’ve lost too many lives.

186
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:40,620
(Loyal and Brave Wang Lin’s Grave)

187
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,030
(Loyal and Brave Wang Lin’s Grave)

188
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,120
(Loyal and Brave Wang Lin’s Grave)
General Wang,

189
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:55,470
you’ve prepared one for yourself?

190
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:57,150
Yes.

191
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,830
My mistake

192
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:02,800
led to our difficulty.

193
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,080
Men should die on the battlefield

194
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:08,080
and fight to the end.

195
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,590
General Wang,

196
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,080
is it worth it?

197
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,240
Must you go this far?

198
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,470
Why is it not?

199
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:20,680
I promised your father

200
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,640
to guard his state.

201
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,000
(Loyal and Brave Wang Lin’s Grave)
This is to honor my promise

202
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,440
even at the cost of my life.

203
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,830
My wish will be fulfilled

204
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:32,560
without any regrets.

205
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,320
There’s one last problem

206
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,000
that’s been troubling me,

207
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,880
but you’re

208
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,830
just the solution I need.

209
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,350
Don’t get me wrong.

210
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:57,950
I’m not burdening you with anything.

211
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:00,440
I hope you can bring this badge

212
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,390
to Zhou Yitang

213
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:04,830
to command the Anping Army.

214
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:16,780
(Peace and Prosperity)

215
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,590
I heard he’s been living in seclusion

216
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,270
in the Fortress of the Forty-Eight

217
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:28,150
and he’s seldom come out.

218
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,240
You want him to leave there to...

219
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,710
No worries.

220
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,640
Just give him the badge

221
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,870
and play the Song of Anping.

222
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:44,000
But remember,

223
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,560
do not alert

224
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,320
Leader Li Jinrong,

225
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,030
or mention my name.

226
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:53,750
Feud can’t be forgotten.

227
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:57,060
I don’t want to get you
in unnecessary trouble.

228
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:11,860
(Graves of the Loyal)

229
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,440
General Wang...

230
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,950
I’m sorry, Your Majesty.

231
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:28,000
You can move again in one hour.

232
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,680
I’ll be on the battlefield then.

233
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:33,590
Don’t forget about your task.

234
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:52,540
Farewell, Your Majesty.

235
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,320
Rebels destroyed the state.

236
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,080
The capital was lost.

237
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:27,150
Mountains collapsed

238
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,980
in the national crisis.

239
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,630
Seasons changed

240
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:36,570
amid homesickness.

241
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,230
All that

242
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:44,240
is probably fate.

243
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,450
Now, I’m all alone

244
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,280
living on borrowed time

245
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,970
with nothing but bones to leave behind.

246
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:03,550
Anzhi.

247
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,080
How do you feel today?

248
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,200
Much better.

249
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:21,560
You don’t seem so.

250
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,720
No big deal.

251
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,960
Even life and death

252
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,670
aren’t that important to me.

253
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,080
Anzhi,

254
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,290
do you have...

255
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,580
Do you have no resentment at all?

256
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:43,910
Who doesn’t?

257
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:45,840
Everyone has it,

258
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,360
so no need to

259
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,800
make a fuss about it.

260
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:52,150
But you carry the royal bloodline.

261
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,630
Amitabha.

262
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:55,600
Abbot,

263
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,870
what do you mean?

264
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,110
Not all the founders of dynasties

265
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:03,390
rose from the nobility.

266
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,750
We only claim

267
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:08,200
we’re the chosen ones

268
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,480
to fool the ignorant.

269
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,840
What’s this?

270
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:19,720
Some light reading.

271
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:22,440
It’s about someone dead

272
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,800
who comes back to life.

273
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,360
He wakes up

274
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,680
but finds himself

275
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:29,750
not in the grave built for him.

276
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,800
He’s confused,

277
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:33,030
so

278
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:34,150
he crawls out

279
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:35,840
to find it.

280
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,200
It’s called

281
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,800
Legend of Bones.

282
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,580
What do you think?

283
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,990
I’ll have it

284
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:45,150
send to

285
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:47,480
Madam Nichang’s troupe later.

286
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,270
Maybe,

287
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:52,870
it’ll become another epic play.

288
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,800
Anzhi,

289
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:58,440
you’re too intelligent.

290
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,840
Master Chen.

291
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,080
Master Chen,

292
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:14,360
I want to make a fine blade.

293
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:16,630
Like what?

294
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,840
What a fine one should be like?

295
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,030
Can you explain it to me

296
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:23,440
in plain words?

297
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,720
What do you think?

298
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,390
I think...

299
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:29,600
Well, I think

300
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,030
good materials

301
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,910
and skills are necessary

302
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,910
to make a blade with a sharp edge

303
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:40,740
and a steady back.

304
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:42,680
It can go against the wind

305
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,000
but not too light to fly away with it.

306
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:47,910
And it must be durable as well.

307
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:50,320
That’s a fine blade to me.

308
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,440
If the owner

309
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,910
makes a name of himself with it,

310
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:58,630
it’ll become a masterpiece of all times.

311
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,680
What’s wrong?

312
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,960
You sound like a swordsmith

313
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,320
because you don’t use blades.

314
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,480
If Fei heard what you said,

315
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,800
she’d laugh at you.

316
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:11,630
I wouldn’t mind

317
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:13,110
because she’s the expert.

318
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:18,270
What do you say as a non-swordsmith?

319
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,600
Just tell me

320
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,360
what kind of blade you want.

321
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:29,730
I’ve been wondering

322
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:33,030
what being born at the wrong time means.

323
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,440
That’s a good question.

324
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,750
What is

325
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:41,270
your take on it?

326
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:45,750
If people are born

327
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:47,230
in peaceful times,

328
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:49,840
they can support themselves

329
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,800
and enjoy their lives.

330
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,990
But those in troubled times

331
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:55,480
don’t even have a roof over their heads.

332
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,720
Are they destined

333
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,720
to be inferior to those living in peace?

334
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,750
The sun

335
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,910
goes up and down.

336
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:09,720
The moon waxes and wanes.

337
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,840
People live and die.

338
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:16,230
Of course, there are good and bad times.

339
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:18,840
We can’t decide

340
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,320
our births.

341
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,480
Whoever born before the sunrise

342
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,080
must be the luckiest

343
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,960
because they can always

344
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:33,910
watch the day come to light.

345
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:35,440
Do you mean Fei?

346
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,560
No.

347
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,080
I mean myself.

348
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,960
Master Chen,

349
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,990
I’ve got an idea

350
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:49,360
for the name of my blade.

351
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,560
What is it?

352
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,960
Tell me.

353
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:55,030
Dim.

354
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:57,320
Dim?

355
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,630
Isn’t there an old saying

356
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:02,030
that the morning light is too dim?

357
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,510
The sun would soon rise

358
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:04,630
and drive away the darkness.

359
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:06,360
What’s there to complain about?

360
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,440
Don’t be too greedy.

361
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,560
The sutra chanted by Master says,

362
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,630
“all that exists on certain conditions

363
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:37,840
are as temporary

364
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:39,870
as dew and thunder.

365
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,200
That’s the way to look at this world”.

366
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:47,390
If I can follow such a way

367
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:52,080
and withstand changes in life,

368
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,200
won’t I be similar

369
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,930
to the morning dew?

370
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,050
That’s eternity in some way.

371
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:07,110
Leader Li of the Fortress
of the Forty-Eight,

372
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:08,910
the son of the Mountain Sword,

373
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:10,360
the daughter of General Wu Fei

374
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,510
and Huo Liantao of Huo’s Manor.

375
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:14,750
Some are martial artists

376
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:15,890
while some are not.

377
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:17,550
Some are good

378
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:19,660
and some are bad.

379
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,870
But none of them knows

380
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,370
what the ripple pattern stands for.

381
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,260
Perhaps

382
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,990
those who buried
The Color of Ocean and Heaven

383
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:34,990
decided to end everything with them.

384
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,330
Or maybe

385
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:39,890
they intended to protect their children.

386
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,730
Anyway, that pattern is passed down,

387
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,570
but The Color of Ocean and Heaven
remains a mystery.

388
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:52,070
Master,

389
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:56,280
I’ve taken the third herb.

390
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:00,910
Do I have a few more months to live?

391
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:04,910
A year at most

392
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:07,360
without using your energy.

393
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:10,630
Otherwise...

394
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:13,870
Life and death are inseparable.

395
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:15,960
All roads lead to the inevitable

396
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,510
as we can only live 100 years tops.

397
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,390
Death is only a matter of time.

398
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:21,680
No need to bother ourselves with it.

399
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,510
I’m glad you can think like that.

400
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,360
Master.

401
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,360
I’m thinking

402
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,050
to go out for a trip.

403
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:42,910
Is there something else
you’d like to do?

404
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:45,560
I haven’t got to

405
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,080
take Fei to Jiankang

406
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,870
to introduce my hometown to her.

407
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,690
It’s now

408
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:58,870
or never.

409
00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:00,480
This isn’t like

410
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,270
any other trips before.

411
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:03,840
Do not

412
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:07,110
push yourself too hard.

413
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,870
I understand.

414
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,200
Weed Spirit.

415
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:34,080
Let’s go.

416
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:07,270
You’re back, Sheng.

417
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:10,110
I’m here. Isn’t that obvious?

418
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:13,200
Are you leaving again so soon?

419
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,270
I’m needed

420
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:15,800
for some business outside.

421
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,150
What business?

422
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:18,030
I heard

423
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:20,320
you’re taking others with you.

424
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,030
It’s about the secret service.

425
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:26,030
Nothing serious.

426
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,440
Fei has just left,
and you will leave, too.

427
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,200
No.

428
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,680
Let me go with you.

429
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:34,360
Look,

430
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,990
Fei is already out

431
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:37,270
and I’ll be leaving soon.

432
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:39,870
Someone needs to hold the fort.

433
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:41,840
You should stay

434
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,360
and watch the house.

435
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,510
It’s boring.

436
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:47,990
I’m not a watchdog, am I?

437
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:51,100
(Liu’s Manor Invitation)

438
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,750
What is this?

439
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:54,460
(Liu’s Manor Invitation)

440
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:01,720
Lord Liu of Liu’s Manor

441
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:04,150
is celebrating his mother’s birthday.

442
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:06,270
I’ll drop a visit to them.

443
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,600
No big deal.

444
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,910
Really?

445
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,750
Why are there so many invitations?

446
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,230
Is there also one for me?

447
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:17,030
Lord Liu

448
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:18,480
loves making friends.

449
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,840
All the invitations

450
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,480
are for our members.

451
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,030
They’ve already been taken.

452
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:25,480
Fine.

453
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:27,110
By the way,

454
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:30,320
how’s Chuchu been lately?

455
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,390
She’s been at home

456
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:34,630
studying martial arts manuals.

457
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:36,840
That’s even more boring.

458
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,750
Chuchu.

459
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,230
Madam.

460
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:57,510
I’ve read the manual

461
00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:58,270
of the Xiaoxiang Sect you put together.

462
00:29:58,270 --> 00:29:59,440
It’s well-organized.

463
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,990
I’ve also clarified

464
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:02,200
a few vague descriptions.

465
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,390
You can have another look.

466
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:04,840
Thank you.

467
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:05,870
I thought Yan

468
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:08,150
showed it to seniors
of the Xiaoxiang Sect.

469
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:09,960
I didn’t mean to trouble you.

470
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,630
We’re a family.

471
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:13,720
No trouble at all.

472
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,800
I’ve handed all my work

473
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,230
to the younger generation

474
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:18,870
and have more free time now.

475
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:22,600
I’m surprised

476
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,480
that a delicate

477
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,560
well-bred girl like you

478
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,030
would do such an amazing job

479
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:29,200
in compiling martial arts manuals.

480
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,630
I’m flattered.

481
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:33,560
Members of the Fortress
all have their duties.

482
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,480
I can read

483
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,200
and write,

484
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,800
and I’m interested in martial arts,

485
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,630
so I’m only trying to

486
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:42,840
put all I have into good use.

487
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,800
That’s too modest of you.

488
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,150
Organizing such manuals

489
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:47,990
requires profound knowledge,

490
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:49,360
persistence

491
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,200
and selfless dedication.

492
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,910
Few can be

493
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:53,600
a better fit than you

494
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,910
for the job.

495
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:58,510
Chuchu,

496
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:02,360
my father devoted himself
to the Snow-breaking Blade.

497
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,320
He only accomplished

498
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,440
Edgeless out of the three moves

499
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,630
and failed to master the nine skills,

500
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:10,800
so he didn’t leave any manuals behind.

501
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,390
I was with him all the time

502
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:14,150
and picked up a few things.

503
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:15,910
I want you

504
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:17,630
to sort them out.

505
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,110
Can I?

506
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,600
You won’t be disappointed.

507
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,630
I’ll do my best

508
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:23,630
and get it done soon.

509
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:25,030
But

510
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:27,110
it may take a while before I can begin

511
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:28,870
as I have an appointment with Lord Liu

512
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:30,360
to consult him

513
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,080
about certain skills
on the Double Ninth Festival.

514
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,720
Go ahead. No problem.

515
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,840
As long as you don’t pick a fight,

516
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,870
skills you’ve learned

517
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:40,870
are enough to protect yourself.

518
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:42,360
Just be careful.

519
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,440
I will.

520
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,800
Thank you.

521
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,910
I’m leaving.

522
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,600
Sheng.

523
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,510
Aunt.

524
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:00,810
What are you doing here?

525
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,150
To go to the library.

526
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,360
For books or the person there?

527
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:16,030
Sheng,

528
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,960
Miss Wu’s father was a warrior.

529
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,030
After he left, she stays with us alone

530
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:22,910
but she’s tough

531
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:24,480
and strong.

532
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,360
If you like her,

533
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,630
don’t ever hurt her, understand?

534
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:32,440
You have my word.

535
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:35,030
I’ll always cherish her

536
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:38,230
and won’t bring shame on our Fortress.

537
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:40,990
Come with me.

538
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:42,360
We need to talk.

539
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:07,270
(Virtuous and Noble)

540
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:08,360
Sheng,

541
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:10,870
are you sure about this?

542
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:11,870
Aunt,

543
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:13,870
Yin Pei has caused too much damage,

544
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:15,510
including the death
of Taoist Priest Chongxiao.

545
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:16,630
I cannot

546
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:18,560
let him go for what it’s worth.

547
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,990
Yin Pei

548
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:22,230
is a strong rival.

549
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,360
Be extra careful.

550
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,080
I will.

551
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,750
I’ve taken your advice

552
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:28,840
and arranged everything.

553
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:29,560
And

554
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:32,110
Madam Nichang
and the others will help me.

555
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:33,440
Everything will be fine.

556
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:36,270
Eliminating him

557
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:38,390
is the right thing to do.

558
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:41,840
Have you seen Fei?

559
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:44,750
Not recently.

560
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:46,800
She’s probably in Penglai

561
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,320
with Xie Yun.

562
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:54,200
You kids are old enough

563
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,230
to leave the nest.

564
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:38,640
Chuchu.

565
00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:40,640
You startled me.

566
00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:42,510
Chuchu,

567
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:43,990
do you know

568
00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:44,930
Sheng’s leaving?

569
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,120
Why?

570
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,670
He seems to be invited to some banquet.

571
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:54,320
And he won’t take me with him.

572
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:59,840
The host is Lord Liu of Liu’s Manor.

573
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,190
Lord Liu?

574
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:05,360
The one of Mount Tai Sect?

575
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,750
How do you know?

576
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:09,230
I’m going to consult him
about martial arts.

577
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:10,400
Hey,

578
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,230
is Sheng really going to his manor?

579
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:15,070
Yes. Why?

580
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:16,770
Nothing.

581
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:30,360
(Jiankang)

582
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,780
(Jiankang)
Hurry. There’s a long away ahead of us.

583
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:36,060
(Jiankang)

584
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,270
I assumed

585
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,470
as long as I didn’t come back,

586
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:45,600
the past wouldn’t haunt me.

587
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,380
Yet here I am.

588
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:50,100
(Jiankang)

589
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,430
Jiankang

590
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:55,880
is colder than I remembered.

591
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,120
Do you feel warm this way?

592
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,120
Fei,

593
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,750
thank you.

594
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:38,080
Remember I once told you

595
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,470
Jiankang is home to

596
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:41,190
half of the delicacies in the state?

597
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:43,400
Of course.

598
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,990
As you ate the drugged bun,

599
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:47,750
you bragged

600
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:50,430
that you’d take me to
the best restaurant here.

601
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:52,030
Let’s go then.

602
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:56,580
(Jiankang)

603
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:58,540
Nice!

604
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:01,690
Wonderful!

605
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:03,430
So beautiful!

606
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:11,360
See that small shop?

607
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,260
Which one?

608
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:14,580
(Sky Lanterns Shop)

609
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:17,510
The name sky lantern

610
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:19,030
comes with a story.

611
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,670
Decades ago,

612
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:23,320
a rich young man

613
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:25,710
bought thousands of sky lanterns

614
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,320
to please a beauty.

615
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,270
They lit up the sky

616
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:31,080
over the Huai River
for seven days and nights.

617
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:33,710
In the end,

618
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:35,430
his effort paid off

619
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:37,230
and they lived happily ever after.

620
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:39,560
Later generations

621
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,190
only sold lanterns here

622
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:43,560
in memory of

623
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,950
(Sky Lanterns Shop)
their fairy-tale love.

624
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:54,600
How come your beauty has grown with age

625
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,710
but not your feelings?

626
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,880
I’m not beautiful

627
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,840
and I don’t need such feelings.

628
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:04,030
Before hearing your story,

629
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:04,920
I thought

630
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:07,030
that was our secret service.

631
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,690
Someone used to mistake

632
00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:16,360
a pharmacy for a snack shop.

633
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,270
I assumed people of your Fortress

634
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:20,230
eat herbs as snacks.

635
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:23,880
Eat my fist!

636
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:24,840
No.

637
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:27,270
-Thanks.
-Have a nice day.

638
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:30,990
Welcome.

639
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:34,080
Are you two lovebirds here for lanterns?

640
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,270
You two make a perfect couple.

641
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:37,600
Hey,

642
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,710
they’re ready

643
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:40,030
to be used at your wedding. This way.

644
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:40,880
No, no, no.

645
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,920
We aren’t a couple.

646
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,230
We are,

647
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:45,160
except that we haven’t got married.

648
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:54,900
(Badge)

649
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,950
Zhou Fei, Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

650
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:58,060
Zhou Fei?

651
00:38:58,060 --> 00:38:59,180
(Badge)

652
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,270
Miss Zhou!

653
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:04,670
I’m so sorry.

654
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:05,670
My bad.

655
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:07,160
How could I not recognize

656
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,400
the heiress to our Fortress?

657
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,670
It’s wildly spread

658
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:12,710
that the heiress to the South Blade

659
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:14,710
had wiped out Demons and restored peace.

660
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:17,160
You’re invincible.

661
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:19,030
All of us

662
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:20,370
are proud of you.

663
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:22,670
Why are you laughing?

664
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:23,540
Stop it.

665
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:27,840
That’s an exaggeration.

666
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,840
You’re flattering me.

667
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,840
And this is...

668
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,750
Surnamed Xie.

669
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:36,640
Greetings, Mr. Xie.

670
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,400
Make yourself at home.

671
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:40,750
Well...

672
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:42,160
Don’t worry about us.

673
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,030
We can look around on our own.

674
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:44,470
Sure. I’ll go make arrangements.

675
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:45,640
Take your time.

676
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,430
What is this lantern?

677
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,190
It looks special.

678
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:09,840
It’s for the Double Seventh Festival.

679
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:26,600
Do you like it?

680
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,190
Take it.

681
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:36,600
What else do you like?

682
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,080
You can have them all,

683
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,950
including this shop.

684
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,600
Look, Xie Meimei.

685
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,920
A girl is hitting on you!

686
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:49,990
Thanks.

687
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:52,750
I’ll take this token of love.

688
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,190
Aren’t you going to

689
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:02,710
take me to your favorite restaurant?

690
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:04,750
Let’s go.

691
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:13,920
-Good! Well done!
-Once more!

692
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,120
Incredible!

693
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:27,650
Amazing!
